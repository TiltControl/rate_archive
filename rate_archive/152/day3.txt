**skargardin** (10): Dare I say robbed?! Thank god this made it into Day 3 at least. This just kept falling as the rate progressed, we hate to see it! I just think this is so much fun and an absolute 00s classic. submitted by u/frajer

**CarlieScion** (4): more like 4 thing am I right

---

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): winner energy teabh

**qazz23** (11): more like 11 Thing :) One of the best songs of the '00s, it's really fun and has a strong hook, the strings that come in near the end are a nice touch

**amr** (10): empress of blasia fr

**anothertown** (10): yes

**awry** (10): bjork once said this is the best song ever and she was right

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i wonder how many people out there have no idea this isn't a beyoncé song

**fadedblue09** (10): The way this was almost my submission. Thank you for whoever submitted this! Lowkey a crime that Indieheads rated this years before we did

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I can’t remember if she was a 5G conspiracist or an antivaxxer but either way she snapped here!

**imtotallyfine\_jpg** (10): One of the absolute best pop songs of all time in my humble opinion

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): I'm still salty for missing this Heardle because I kept typing One Thing

**MrMoodle** (10): was just hit by a wave of nostalgia of running over cops to this song in gtav

**nt96** (10): This girl really had the potential to out-Beyonce Beyonce herself

**PAHC** (10): no bc the SLAYYYYY

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this bitch dropped the song of the decade then dipped

**WaneLietoc** (10): "It's good to know that during the dark reign of Crazy Frog, a human being pretending to be a doorbell still rocks harder. Okay, so some called it "Crazier In Love", whining that producer Rich Harrison only has "1 Thing" going on: but if that thing is building bulletproof r&b out of crazily canted tumbledown breaks and tightly coiled guitar stabs, I don't see the problem." - Drew Daniel of MATMOS writing for p4k in 2005. so true drew daniel, an undeniable pop star and collaborator of Bjork's early 00s "winner time" era. anyways, shout out to GTA 5 for introducing pop music to kids who didn't know they were gay. this song is still precise and a true slab of real music.

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): This song was so good Beyonce turned it into a whole album

**bridgemoney** (9): And it's fucking disgusting.

**DirtyRat583** (9): should be the version featuring eve but this still slays

**imbaby122** (9): such a banger. it’s a damn shame it’s so impossible to sing bc i fear the gods will strike me down for even attempting to sing along.

**ReallyCreative** (9): My Amazon cart when I purchase every Grammy won by Katy Perry and a new rice cooker

**vayyiqra** (9): a jam

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Idk who Amerie is but I liked this better than like 85% of the songs in the RnB rate

**welcome2thejam** (9): Love the bridge and how much the tracks evolves afterwards

**starla\_** (8.9): I used to dislike this song because it was SO overplayed at the time, but revisiting it now it absolutely smashes

**afs** (8.5): I wanted to be funny and give this a 1 but it popped so

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): this song almost went to j lo and i'm very glad it didn't

**babadork** (8.5): The production hasn’t really held up over the years, but I really fondly remember when everyone was obsessed with this song on the ’05 equivalents of popheads.

**BasedButta** (8.5): song that makes you go HOG with the rhythm

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Jennifer Lopez heard this song and tried to steal it from Amerie but I can’t blame her for it, this is a smash… unclear how JLo thought she was gonna hit these notes though.

**synyyy** (8.5): ouch I guess

**shipperondeck** (8.2): my sis is with me and she approves

**camerinian** (8): i swear this song was way more present on Non-Stop Pop in GTA V than like any other song on that station, and now it just sounds empty without Michael yammering some bullshit about Hollywood liberals and his whore wife over the top of it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): someone’s gonna give this a 1 to try and be funny and i hope they trip and fall

**frogaranaman** (8): absolutely ICONC chorus

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The strings during the final chorus??? Hello?!? Rich Harrison honestly snapped with this beat. Also gotta give props to Zigaboo Modeliste (what a cool name) for the killer drums on this one!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): her voice cracks in the chorus bug me, I feel like a slightly stronger vocalist would eat this up

**itsabop** (7.8): What a throwback

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): I haven't heard this song in years! Thank you for submitting, stranger!

**seanderlust** (7.5): I hear the critique that this is crazy in love 2 but like...crazy in love slaps so

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): slightly overrated amongst the poptimists but it has good components

**TiltControls** (7.2): I'm happy someone submitted hangar, but I kinda wanted 1 Thing and Sprawl II to be 1 and 2 on the playlist for jokes

**1998tweety** (7): this song is great except for that awful beat

**celladonn** (7): Girl stop being vague... what is the 1 thing

**runaway3212** (7): I wanted to give this a 1 and be funny but it's kinda hitting now so I guess I need to reference LADN due in like a month

**yearofthesoup** (7): what's w the gobble tho

**ricki** (6.8): you’ll never be one direction

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Mixed thoughts on this cute song about a woman falling in love with a man's turkey impression. I think the beat is very good but Amerie’s vocals and hook are the weak poins.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): The one thing is the chorus repeated over and over again.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): her voice is kinda annoying im sorry

**throwaway-7650** (6): I have no nostalgia for this song + chorus is annoying af

**Stryxen** (5): this song makes me a little uncomfortable. It sounds like it could fall apart at any moment. It’s also SO repetitive, but the slow build up in the back makes me not dislike it tho

**SmileAndTears** (4): what in the Crazy In Love is this?

**jsonphile** (3): what is with this melody? It just keeps jumping up and down awkwardly. Amerie might be a good singer, but this song does not show it, I don’t think anyone could pull this off. Drum beats pretty good though

**Uberpigeon** (3): i feel like ive heard this song just in the wild 1000 times and i dont really care for this y2k sound... sorry to darjeelingdarkroast

**rslashpoopheads** (1): whew this is messy and grating as hell

**flavasavavandal** (0): im gonna get labelled a rate villain again, but everything sounds wrong in this song from the pots and pans style drums to Amerie's vocals being slightly pitched too high. This is just grating from start to finish

**skargardin** (10): We YAAASED. Prior to me starting to receive ballots I had no idea that this had been so prominently used in shaving commercials, is that what led to its somewhat early downfall? I hope not tbh :skull: I mean you can't deny that this is catchy as hell. Submitted by u/ImADudeDuh

**CarlieScion** (7): I’m sorry I can’t listen to this without thinking of shaving commercials

---

**1998tweety** (10): women's shaving commercial bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): music peaked when this dropped

**anothertown** (10): one of the best hooks ever let's go

**astrologicalangelel** (10): also a certified classic in an entirely different way

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): i'm your penis

**DirtyRat583** (10): YEAH BABEY SHES GOT IT 💃

**ignitethephoenix** (10): they put their whole bananramussy into this that it became a shaving stick anthem

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I fucking snapped with this pick

**MrMoodle** (10): my 5 year old nephew obviously heard this or a parody somewhere and keeps yelling “i’m your penis i’m vagina your desire”

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Loooove the killer synth solo in the bridge!! Such a banger

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ugh every time i listen to this it’s even better than i remember it being!

**vayyiqra** (10): I love 80s music

**WaneLietoc** (10): where's the banana phone? idk man this one really good rock on.

**babadork** (9.8): The real reason I buy dollar store razors is because they remixed the song to be not as cool. It has nothing to do with me being cheap or lazy about shaving.

**itsabop** (9.2): That's a classic yup

**starla\_** (9.2): I prefer the Shocking Blue version but this also slaps hard. Stream Cruel Summer (Bananarama's Version)

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (9): classic

**jsonphile** (9): if I had a nickel for every great 60s song that had a almost equally good 80s cover I’d have, like, a lot of nickels because it seems like that just happened a lot

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): Not quite Cruel Summer but almost as good

**ricki** (9): just got this sudden urge to shave my legs, not sure what that’s about

**shipperondeck** (9): BANANARAMA FOR THE ROCK AND ROLL HALL OF FAME

**steelstepladder** (9): Makes me want to shave my legs

**throwaway-7650** (9): the live version >

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): I can't be the only one who thought they were singing penis as a kid right

**celladonn** (8.5): I fear that this is forever associated with ads for women's razors but that doesn't mean it doesn't bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i never realised how good the synths are in this song

**afs** (8): this album was released in 1986, shading Madonna fifteen-twenty years before she released

**awry** (8): thank you gilette ads for introducing this song to me as a 6 year old. been bopping to it ever since

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a bop but I can’t dissociate it with cutting my legs shaving.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oldphobia please dont get this one

**fadedblue09** (8): some people say this was overplayed in commercials….well glad that isnt the case for me

**frogaranaman** (8): absolutely iconic cover

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): my legs feel hairy all of the sudden

**gwykiki** (8): commercial classic

**jman457** (8): Taylor’s cruel summer cant hold a candle to Banamarama’s Cruel Summer

**nt96** (8): I'm in the mood for shaving my legs

**PAHC** (8): i think she's got it potentially

**qazz23** (8): i slightly prefer the original, but this is a good cover which improves its danceability

**rslashpoopheads** (8): eye cawns

**runaway3212** (8): yass I love the recent disco revival

**seanderlust** (8): when these girls form a supergroup with chumbawumba called bananarambawumba it's over for us all

**slimboyfriend** (8): Love the mystical chaos of the instrumental

**synyyy** (8): gonna play this at my (parents') wedding

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Have so much history with this song. Can't rate it any higher or lower.

**imbaby122** (7.5): this song is good but like most old songs (kate bush excluded) i don’t think i would ever listen to it by my own volition. sorry oldheads.

**NecroDolphinn** (7.5): The post chorus instrumental rocks my entire body

**krusso1105** (7): This would be higher if not for that overplayed commercial

**static\_int\_husp** (7): why are we doing shampoo-commercial-core songs

**welcome2thejam** (7): Left my legs feeling silky smooth!

**camerinian** (6): this song is… very loud

**imtotallyfine\_jpg** (6): I like the song but the Venus commercials has also ruined it for me.

**pig-serpent** (6): This is just a New Order song with a worse singer.

**plastichaxan** (6): eh a classic but… :shrug: i don’t care for it

**Uberpigeon** (6): :deadbananarama:

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Tom Breihan said that Bananarama improved on Shocking Blue's original but I'm gonna have to hard disagree here, this honestly sounds really lifeless and mechanical

**yearofthesoup** (6): CHore desire

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): this song just bullied me for my hairy arms??

**hikk** (5): razor commercials

**SmileAndTears** (5): its probably good but they play this every day at work and i just cant listen to it anymore im sorry

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): this poor song forever being associated with feminine product commercials

**ReallyCreative** (4): one of the best instrumentals to ever grace music with one of the most lackluster hooks/vocal performances... Give this to Donna Summer and people would be killed!

**TiltControls** (3.5): Sorry - all I can think of when I hear this are beaches and razor commercials

**skargardin** (8): Honestly the only reason I didnt' score this higher was because I kept comparing it to Whirlpool, but I should've just gone ahead and given it a ten in hindsight. Also I can't belivee that we got two songs from the same band in the rate. Regardless if it was coordinated or not, pretty iconic! Submitted by u/DefaultPophead

**CarlieScion** (7): not as good as the other Kinoko song

---

**DefaultPophead** (11): Did I really give my 11 to the song I sent in? Yes. And I’d do it again.

**1998tweety** (10): omg this sounds incredible

**NecroDolphinn** (10): This song is such a gentle and calming combination of dream pop and J Pop resulting in a song that feels like a warm hug. Its glitter grows in warmth and depth too and really fills out the entire musical landscape. I love Kinoko Teikoku so much and they really knocked it out of the park with this song. One of their best late career songs.

**wavingwolves** (10): WOW............... this slayage.... i wasn't ready........... thanks to whoever submitted it.....

**welcome2thejam** (10): Both these songs got me irenenotes-ing like crazy rn

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): lovely

**TiltControls** (9.2): I love how sentimental this feels!!

**fadedblue09** (9): Pleasantly surprised by this, one of my favorite discoveries so far

**flavasavavandal** (9): I need to thank the person who gave permission to the Charity Rate to start slaying this hard because it was getting dire for a bit

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): But where are th—shot

**Stryxen** (8.9): VOCALS

**afs** (8.5): kinoko kinoko beikoku

**imbaby122** (8.5): there’s something very nostalgic about this song… maybe because the last time i listened to a non-pop song was like 2016 😵‍💫

**PAHC** (8.5): god i love the chord progression, such a bittersweet sound

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): it's like alvvays released a song in japanese

**jman457** (8.2): sounds like a good early 2010’s indie pop song

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): the weaker of the kinoko teikoku songs for me but still very good

**gwykiki** (8.1): love getting exposed to new things through rates i really liked this!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): see this one is fine what the fuck happened on the other one

**frogaranaman** (8): how did we get two submissions of this J-rock band in the same charity rate, which of y'all coordinated this

**pig-serpent** (8): I love the texture of this song.

**qazz23** (8): the other track was better, this one has a decent pop sound but not as shoegazey

**rslashpoopheads** (8): thank u to whoever got her in here twice

**runaway3212** (8): this is better actually

**synyyy** (8): this is fine

**vayyiqra** (8): I love dream pop

**BasedButta** (7.5): nice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): lets go shoegazeheads

**slimboyfriend** (7.4): After listening to their first song here, I was like “I wonder what their other songs sound like” and now I don’t have to!

**WaneLietoc** (7.4): love dinosaur jr great band. no this doesn't sound like dino jr im just shocked 2 ditties from this act were chosen. the other was better and this feels like a sirius xmu ditty.

**DirtyRat583** (7.3): as much as i hate bands this is actually quite good

**awry** (7): not as great as the other song but i'm biased towards anything with distorted echoey guitars

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I’m not blown away but I do love those doo doo doo’s.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): this is pretty cool, the Japanese vocals work pretty well

**starla\_** (6.5): this is lovely

**Verrem** (6): Mass of the Fermenting Dregs outsold

**camerinian** (5): I literally didn't have a single thought about either song from this band pass through my brain. It was like listening to the PA at a dive bar while waiting for the actual band to show up.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): did the members of this band donate or something

**CarlieScion** (10): SLAY! Mayhaps my 11????

**skargardin** (10): It's pretty iconic and ironic that the one band that has a double submission in this rate has their songs go out back-to-back. This was one of the greatest discoveries in the rate for me, I'm absolutely obsessed with this and I'm so glad that it seemed to resonate with more of you too. When shoegaze hits right it's just so impossible to resist. Submitted by u/NecroDolphinn

---

**jman457** (11): Just a perfect shoegaze song. One of the best surprises from the rate, and therefore gets my top score.

**NecroDolphinn** (11): This is probably my second favorite song (Run Away With Me is first) and for good reason. In my opinion, it's the best shoegaze song ever made. The lead guitar line is one of the most gorgeous sounds I’ve ever heard and Chiaki Sato’s voice is such a beautiful deadpan with just the right amount of emotion. Speaking of emotion, despite not knowing a lick of Japanese, this song is dripping with so much emotion. It is simultaneously sad and nostalgic and gorgeous and everything in between. The entire song makes me feel nostalgic for a time and a place I’ve never met and listening to this song while riding the tram into the city is one of the best moments of my whole life. I love this song so much. All this doesn’t even scratch the surface of the song. The background instrumentation is so dense (it's a shoegaze song after all). There are squalls of feedback, thick drapes of distortion, and incredibly loud and frantic drumming (the hi hats are beat with a frenzy worthy of the song’s intensity). The entire song is an intersection of noise, beauty, emotion, and songcraft and just a truly perfect product (kind of like RAWM’s mechanical perfection but with a totally different set of musical building blocks). This song is just perfect and if anybody reading this likes it, listen to the entire album it's from (Uzuninaru) because man the whole thing is amazing.

**agentofscranton** (10): winnie the pooh out of body experience gif

**awry** (10): okay yes japanese shoegaze wins me over

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): great song but considering what popheads did to the shoegaze artists in indieheads exchange i'm afraid this is gonna get robbed

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Okay now I’m seeing why this group got two songs submitted.

**DefaultPophead** (10): the second best Kinoko Teikoku song in the rate and it's still a 10.

**Gonza\_90** (10): poohascend My favorite first listen in the rate

**nt96** (10): oh this is just gorgeous

**steelstepladder** (10): Discovery of the rate. Absolutely fantastic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): been meaning to listen to them for a while now and now's my opportunity! and yeah this is incredible

**throwaway-7650** (10): this isn't the best japanese song in the rate !?

**WaneLietoc** (10): love when the japanese shoegaze band does the radio

**wavingwolves** (10): WOWWWW i can already see myself disassociating to this in the future!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Staring at your shoes and slowly shuffling truly transcends the language barrier

**PAHC** (9.5): i love shoegaze!!!!!

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): ik everyone else has been talking about this being their favorite discovery and you know what, they were all right, this is amazing

**1998tweety** (9): this is the opposite vibes as their other song but still immaculate

**afs** (9): shoegaze my beloved

**pig-serpent** (9): Shoegaze needs a good riff to hook me and this song has it.

**qazz23** (9): love the shoegaze feel and the alternating vocals

**seanderlust** (9): "I looked up at the blue sky, it was so blue that I forgot how lost at sea I was" ooooof

**vayyiqra** (9): so pretty

**starla\_** (8.9): love!!

**synyyy** (8.5): pach and afs say it's top 5 lock... Let's see

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): I can't not read this as whirlpool

**BasedButta** (8): i started kinda hating this but it’s really good if you’re in the right mindset

**imbaby122** (8): i love indie rock when men aren’t singing it!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this is slaying

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): from one Kinoko track to another… I like this one a little bit more than Sweet Osmanthu, but both tracks are really good honestly

**rslashpoopheads** (8): oh this is right up my alley

**TiltControls** (7.7): I feel like I'm floating on a cloud

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Shoegaze isn't normally my thing but some parts come together here

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s a vibe

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i would love it if didn’t blow out my eardrums

**runaway3212** (6): im so sorry to all my weeabooheads but I must say I dont get it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): it’s loud and noisy but it also doesn’t really go anywhere?

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): this isn’t bad but I’d rather be listening to something else

**MrMoodle** (2): I ended up loving the other Kinoko song in this rate, but this is just so reverby and muddy, which is obviously intentional but I kind of hate it lol

---

**hikk** (11): whoever sent this is so hot and sexy

**1998tweety** (10): pop excellence

**2dina3dworld** (10): they’re so wacky 🤪

**agentofscranton** (10): don't kill me orbits but i fear loona have never reached the heights that odd eye circle have

**anothertown** (10): something shifted when this album came out

**awry** (10): I DONT REALLY CARE NOW!!!!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): is it wrong for me to call this RYM-core

**DirtyRat583** (10): one of loonas best songs iktr

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I miss when being an Orbit was exciting rather than excruciating

**MassiveThief** (10): Kpop perfection.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SMASHA

**PAHC** (10): was really conflicted on this being my 11. adore it to bits but its just not the best loona song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): where is this loona sound I miss her

**ricki** (10): nothing i hate more than a “loona fell off” bitch, but in their favor when this is where loona set the bar before the whole lineup was even revealed i dont blame people for expecting a lot from them

**runaway3212** (10): loona iconic

**seanderlust** (10): stan loona

**Stryxen** (10): all time fav, literally on my top 50 all time favs list, so close to getting my 11

**synyyy** (10): watch me hate this to hell and beyond in the rate reveal

**thedoctordances1940** (10): YASSSSSSSSSSSSSS

**throwaway-7650** (10): the english version doesn't exist

**vayyiqra** (10): This is better than Girl Front you heard me

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Maybe if we rated more LOONA songs like this my average for them wouldn’t be 5.8

**TiltControls** (9.5): This is just so cheery and so much fun

**wavingwolves** (9.1): whoever sent this is so cold and unsexy

**MrMoodle** (9): if anyone sees this can someone give me some kpop recommendations that sound like this for someone who doesn’t really listen to kpop otherwise

**NecroDolphinn** (9): This song is pretty good but also this one of the highest rated pop albums on RYM and like I’m surprised but this song bangs.

**qazz23** (9): love how energetic yet dreamy this is, really sweet chorus too

**afs** (8.5): Night Shift Vs LOONATIC... who will be the new theme of phcj?

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Loona got me back into girl groupsa few years ago ty ty

**imbaby122** (8.5): this song shifted my brain chemistry a bit and now i’m a loonatic.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): she's no girl front but she'll do

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): you dont understand how much it hurts my soul to enjoy a fucking loona song. this is so embarassing...

**CrimsonROSET** (8): stan loona

**rslashpoopheads** (8): why's this better than literally any loona title track

**welcome2thejam** (8): "I am not insane" Rarely a good sign having to clarify that

**WaneLietoc** (7.5): wow. loona really is a psyop. both an 11 and a 0 because I can't quite dissect the vid's gaze. when I played in my laptop I though "majestically mid", but on the hi fi the whole sonic package is here and delivering. great shit; that video still evil though. anyways def would be the funniest signee to sacred bones imaginable https://twitter.com/raveonyou/status/1430052049140338692?s=20&t=AmHCqps_9uarxaRSbVICTg

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I’m afraid this failed to live up to the discord hype but it’s still very nice!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The mixing in this song is kinda crowded and a bit too overcompressed imo but otherwise it's a decent song.

**babadork** (6.8): I do like this live, but the production on the studio version doesn’t work for me.

**jsonphile** (6): I don’t know anything about LOONA do their voices always sound like that?

**slimboyfriend** (6): I can barely hear the vocals but I guess they’re good?

**starla\_** (5.5): decent

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): the production in this highkey kinda sucks

**skargardin** (10): Tinashe losing Superlove before *333* album-cut The Chase? It's more likely than you think! This had me pretty gagged. Obviously Tinashe is well-loved around here, but this seems to be the one case where single-bias didn't win and honestly, love that for her. Submitted by runaway3212

**CarlieScion** (7): I must say that Charlis superlove is better

---

**DaHumanTorch** (11): an easy 11 choice for me. tinashe is my favorite artist ever and this song is just INCREDIBLE and definitely top tier in her discography. this stays on repeat every summer

**runaway3212** (11): when I did a black nuzlocke I named my starter Super11ove cause I care more about this song than my own personal health

**1998tweety** (10): DIA blatantly copying both this song and the video concept are so funny. You can get away with maybe one but don't push it and do both.

**akanewasright** (10): This song makes me want to go to the beach, and I hate the beach sob that’s a big achievement

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I know every word to this song and whenever it comes on I will sing the entire thing no matter what the situation.

**nt96** (10): I heard Freestyle beats, it's a 10

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): and fuck DIA!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): DIA could never

**shipperondeck** (10): this was destined to be in a charity rate

**Stryxen** (10): not saying mother for an entire minute challenge

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): remember when the tiktok sound of this mashed up with unlock it went viral and both her and charli tried to claim it as their own song

**welcome2thejam** (10): Such a joy that it makes me wanna find someone that makes me feel like this does

**BasedButta** (9): i LOVE the guy performing a fighting game combo in the background

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the best argument for sex i’ve ever heard

**ignitethephoenix** (9): twerk

**qazz23** (9): production on this is amazing - good bass and backing vocals

**anothertown** (8.5): DIA comment

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): man I went through a lot of boring Tinashe songs before popheads actually hyped one up that’s actually good

**PAHC** (8.5): sos! is it me or is this dangerous?

**ricki** (8.5): tinashe wanted to sue DIA because they outdid her

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): aw she looks like a baby in this cover art

**apatel27** (8.1): Gains a point for the MV

**wavingwolves** (8.1): dia in fact did it better but this slays still

**agentofscranton** (8): woo woo woo baby woo baby baby

**pig-serpent** (8): This is just a kpop song that’s missing 2 or 3 layers of bullshit.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): we need the unlock it mashup on spotify NOW, what's taking so long

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's fun but it really doesn't sound like a Tinashe song, even when she does more synthpop oriented stuff it's SO different from this

**synyyy** (8): ok

**throwaway-7650** (8): DIA (WooWoo) paved the way for everglow (la di da)

**TiltControls** (8): It's been brought up so many times as a possible submission and then gets outshined by a better Tinashe song in the rate. Still a great track though

**vayyiqra** (8): Fun song and video

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Why do I feel the inexplicable urge to break out into the running man

**awry** (7.8): i just realized how similar this is to superbass

**afs** (7.5): Charli outsold

**camerinian** (7.5): God this production is so good, I just wish Tinashe did more to stand out over it

**imbaby122** (7.5): this could’ve got a higher score but lyrics about having someone’s babies and being impregnated turn me offfff.

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Got that l-l-l-l-l-l-l-l-love got that superlove

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this would be a boring winner ngl but it wouldn’t be entirely underserved

**2dina3dworld** (7.3): this is cute but Tinashe has a lot better than this slightly better Fifth Harmony cut

**jman457** (7): my least favorite of the two tinashe songs here

**starla\_** (6.5): this is one of those Tinashe songs that has never quite clicked for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Was definitely expecting a little more with this one tbh…

**gwykiki** (6): she has a lot better songs

**Uberpigeon** (6): tinashe is a gaslight experiment on me. everyone talks about a tinashe song and tells me its the greatest pop song to ever exist and then its the most average thing ive ever heard. also how is there so many songs called superlove its not even a good name for a song

**MassiveThief** (5.5): I love Tinashe but this one never did it for me

**fadedblue09** (5): This is embarassingly generic.

**MrMoodle** (5): every tinashe song i’ve heard i didn’t really like at first but then i’ve had it grow on me until i’m totally in love with it, so last time there was a tinashe song is in a rate i listened to it early because i knew my score was gonna increase like 4 points at minimum, and it did. but i’m within like 2 hours of the deadline for this rate so sorry tinashe stans lmao this is mid gonna regret this later

**DefaultPophead** (3): Don't worry, I gave "The Chase" a 10.

**CarlieScion** (8): okay and fun!

**skargardin** (8): I was intrigued to see how this Carly-esque synthbop would do (to be fair, we've had quite a few of them in the rate so far), and a top 20 placement seems about right for one of the standout tracks on her latest album. Submitted by u/berober04

---

**imbaby122** (11): song of the year. beyond euphoric. i’m in a trance-like state whenever i listen to this song that’s just telling me to dance. it’s so powerful that it could genuinely bring world peace.

**agentofscranton** (10): foxes main pop girl soon pls i've been manifesting it since 2014

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Vastly outsold the banana album band.

**hikk** (10): sister slay sister rayte winner

**jman457** (10): one of my fav discoveries from this. Wanted to eleven in so badly but thought id go with a more interesting pic in the spirit of charity rate

**PAHC** (10): the bridge is so yass

**runaway3212** (10): I love creme brulee it's my favourite french meal

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is a bop but also an incredibly welcome reprieve from Halloween Puppet Show

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I mean like it's already a classic, simple as

**throwaway-7650** (10): me when the prompt is iconic food network personality

**vayyiqra** (10): This album rules

**welcome2thejam** (10): Didn't really like the album, but this track stuck in my head for sure. That's a gawddamn catchy chorus

**plastichaxan** (9.8): ugh huge bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the way I keep forgetting to actually check out this album

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): that chorus is MAGNIFICENT

**1998tweety** (9): pop perfection

**awry** (9): very carly-goes-eurodance and i love it!

**DefaultPophead** (9): Guess I have a new album to check out!

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (9): this is what I was hoping for more of when I signed on for this rate

**afs** (8.5): wrong foxes song... stream sky love

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): i'm a bit disappointed that this isn't a full cover of the velvet underground song but it still slaps pretty hard

**itsabop** (8.5): She literally always serves

**TiltControls** (8.2): I always forget how good Foxes is until I'm listening to yet another track from her that kills it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): why does everyone hate geminis

**just\_thonking** (8): Most 8/10 8/10 I've ever 8/10-ed

**MrMoodle** (8): the halloween puppet show is a tough act to follow but yeah this is ok

**rslashpoopheads** (8): outserved their fleet counterparts

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): All these dance songs sound the same after a while… but that doesn’t mean they’re bad!

**slimboyfriend** (7.8): Is this about the Velvet Underground song about sex and drugs and murder

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Very run of the mill but still decent

**pig-serpent** (7): I’m enjoying this song on the playlist but I struggled to make it four songs on this album. I have a feeling that if a second song from this album was in this rate I would give this song a 3.

**qazz23** (7): sorry, The Velvet Underground is better (original comment lololol)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): dedicated side c

**2dina3dworld** (6.7): okay so this isn’t a cover of a Velvet Underground song?

**wavingwolves** (6.1): sing it girl

**akanewasright** (6): I’m not pretending this isn’t something that would make me move a little in an H&M, but I’ve heard this a few times and have never felt any urge to relisten to it

**flavasavavandal** (6): generic synthpop

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Sometimes a gay person will say “why isn’t everyone streaming _____ it’s pop perfection!” and then they’ll link it and it’s yet another synthpop song that sounds exactly like this.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's cute but i'm still kinda reeling from the previous song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): popheads is gonna overrate this song so much

**WaneLietoc** (4.2): purgatory

**skargardin** (10): And thus we've finally cracked the 8 average! And what a deserving song and artist to do it with! We love to see that balladphobia didn't stop Selena's classic from placing in the top 20. I fully understand if this type of dreamy ballad isn't everyone's cup of tea, but Selena's gorgeous vocals really elevate this to make it more than the sum of its parts. Submitted by u/LesApfels

**CarlieScion** (7): this is so nice

---

**itsabop** (11): Choosing an eleven from this rate with such diversity of songs was difficult, but there's nothing quite like THIS masterpiece. We love you forever Selena. Popheads better not rob this one!

**2dina3dworld** (10): I miss her

**anothertown** (10): 🤺🤺🤺 stay back balladphobia 🤺 back i say

**CrimsonROSET** (10): immaculate

**DefaultPophead** (10): Deserves nothing less.

**fadedblue09** (10): Hold on I actually recognize this???

**frogaranaman** (10): god I love her

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): RIP :pensive:

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I FUCKING HATE YOU YOLANDA

**MrMoodle** (10): shit like this just makes me smile, i crave this. also that spoken part around the middle of the song is MWAH

**nt96** (10): VOTE FOR 90S LATIN DIVAS!

**ricki** (10): selena created madre lake with her bare hands

**SmileAndTears** (10): ooooh this is really good

**throwaway-7650** (10): but when are we rating como la flor, the real 11

**vayyiqra** (10): simply magical

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): One of my favorite feelings ever is revisiting a song from your past and having the realization that you love it way more than you thought you did

**TiltControls** (9.5): Feels weird that this is the first we're rating Selena, but a great first song to do it on (though hopefully balladphobia doesn't pop up)

**1998tweety** (9): ascending a bit

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i’ve always admired selena’s music ever since my spanish teacher in high school put on the movie for us on the last day of school one year. not my favorite from her but still a highlight

**jman457** (8.7): 90’s dream pop at its finest

**afs** (8.5): I was convinced this was Madonna and thought 'wow she had pipes all along'... RIP Selena

**imbaby122** (8.5): this song is so beautiful and deeply nostalgic. i didn’t even know i knew this song until the chorus hit and a ton of memories got unlocked.

**PAHC** (8.5): rly held up considering its from the 1990s, still sounds modern and dreamy as all hell

**synyyy** (8.5): a moment of silence for the latin madonna

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): very Disney princess

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): i don't really know what to say, this is such a pretty ballad and Selena was so talented, gone too soon

**jsonphile** (8): not usually a fan of these late 80s early 90s type of ballads but this is alright

**ReallyCreative** (8): unfortunately I'm not a huge fan of this genre of ballad (sorry Ms. Dion) but Selena makes it work

**Stryxen** (8): very very pretty

**welcome2thejam** (8): A lovely ballad

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I’m so glad we are rating her I just wish the vocals did more at first

**WaneLietoc** (7.8): an awesome beat. powerful mainstream music.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Very pretty even if it does have a bit of a “adult contemporary cover of a classic Disney song” vibe.

**camerinian** (7): this is a very nice ballad but it’s literally the last song i had to score and i’m already over deadline and i’m so tired so just take this good but not great score and understand this may not reflect my actual opinions come reveal time, good night

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Excellent ballad from a legend. RIP.

**awry** (6.5): i understand her importance but i don't love this song. it's good for what it is though

**qazz23** (6): kind of generic and too polished

**rslashpoopheads** (6): sorry but this is kind of a disney outro snoozer

**starla\_** (5.1): this sounds like something in a Disney movie

**Gonza\_90** (3): I'm sorry but this is so dull

**pig-serpent** (2): I grew up in an echo chamber that always called this kind of sparkly 90s ballad some of the worst music ever, so I’ve been blindsided in previous rates at how much popheads likes these songs. I’m glad they have an audience, but I feel like I have an allergic reaction to this kind of music so I’m entirely with the echo chamber on this.

**BasedButta** (1): is this a serious song? not 0 bait? you sure?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9.5): Love the instrumental to this, sounds like something you’d hear on Monstercat Silk or on an early Armada/Anjunabeats release. The chorus and the buildup in the bridge are so bloody insane.

**BasedButta** (9): why is the beat going this hard? OH YEAH

**qazz23** (9): title checks out - definitely a good voice! like how it takes off about halfway through (favorite discovery #4)

**shipperondeck** (9): pause i love this

**synyyy** (9): its like swans but accessible idk at this point

**babadork** (8.7): A lot of it is really great, but I hate those floppy claps.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): If this was a bit shorter I’d say it’s a lock for Top 10 but as it stands I fear it may fall to long song phobia

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Could probably be a bit shorter but she served.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this just has good vibes

**NecroDolphinn** (8): major slays all around

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): Mixing is kinda bad but that’s normal in Japanese music so I will let it pass

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Oh this is a surprise banger!

**welcome2thejam** (8): What a fantastic first drop

**fadedblue09** (7.5): oh I hear something

**gwykiki** (7.5): not quite there but really interesting

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): exactly queen!

**jman457** (7.4): this bopped a bit

**DirtyRat583** (7.2): it bops but how did u find this artist???????? they have 2000 monthly listeners

**TiltControls** (7.2): That note though

**frogaranaman** (7): honestly this is wicked

**slimboyfriend** (6.8): oh I see why it’s called Voice

**Stryxen** (6.8): idk why this isn’t hitting for me, i dont wanna tank cos it feels like something i would love.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this sounds like a dance remix (derogatory)

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): instrumental slays

**runaway3212** (6): good but goes on a bit too long

**yearofthesoup** (6): too long

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (5): this really didn't need to be so long

**jsonphile** (5): fine but goes on too long

**starla\_** (3.5): I'm sorry but this is really annoying

**skargardin** (8): I'll be honst, I've never really been able to get into Regina's music, however, this is by far one of the best songs I've heard of her. The underlying piano melody is insanely catchy and strings are simply gorgeous, and it's of course well-written to boot. Submitted by u/cremeebrulee

**anothertown** (11): and chemo limo would be a 12

**exciting\_patient4872** (11): Surely won't be the only one who gives this one top honours!

**skargardin** (10): First of all I would like to thank Canada's Drag Race for introducing me to this banger! There's just certain type of songs that you can immediately associate with a lipsync and this is certainly one of those songs for me. Miss Synthia Kiss really did that with her spinning! I was so glad to see this doing so well as it's an absolute megabop, but unfortunately it couldn't quite reach the top ten. Submitted by u/Saison_Marguerite

**CarlieScion** (9): surprisingly fun

---

**1998tweety** (10): I'm Canadian so I thought this was a worldwide known bop but I guess not. This better make day 3

**agentofscranton** (10): synthia kiss you will always be famous

**akanewasright** (10): tbh Fefe kinda won the rocker teen Canadians gone pop contest in this rate

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): plot twist: the girl in the song is actually a ghost she just doesn't know it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this would be the 11

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Danny Phantom when he gets cheated on:

**ignitethephoenix** (10): any Canadian who gives this less than a 9 it’s getting kicked out of the country I don’t make the rules

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me checking past discord messages to see if the hosts are annoyed by drag race gays before making my comment

**nootnoot781** (10): synthia kiss (22)

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): The way she actually disappeared after this

**pig-serpent** (10): A song so good that every time it comes on I’m tempted to lower my scores for every other song by 1 point.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): life was just so much better in 2010

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): now that's how you clear a bitch

**throwaway-7650** (10): Quartet

**TiltControls** (10): The Canadians came to slay! Though it's a bit different than her other work this is still a fantastic track in Fefe Dobson's discography!

**xavieryes** (10): day n nite, i toss and turn, i keep stress in my mind, mind

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Canadian queen

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): bleeps and bloops are good sometimes

**plastichaxan** (9.5): kinda the song ever

**BasedButta** (9): love it! really solid rocking out song, we need more of those

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This is really good but not as good as other song about going ghost.

**hikk** (9): as a canadian this was already a CLASSIC but i must admit it's been redefined in my mind by synthia kiss spinning like that and also nearly decapitating stephanie prince with her projectile

**MrMoodle** (9): never heard this song but i can tell i would be painfully nostalgic over this if i had

**ReallyCreative** (9): Fefe Dobson ghost hunter show when

**runaway3212** (9): what's with this rate and bad early 2010s knockoffs

**vayyiqra** (9): Canadacore

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I need to listen to more of her sometime

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): danny phantom:

**imbaby122** (8.5): the chorus is so ascension-inducingly beyond that it makes every other part of the song sound mid.

**afs** (8): selena gomez rejected this track,,,

**anothertown** (8): when this goes on day 1 it will really be fefe friday

**awry** (8): bangs tbh

**itsabop** (8): Serving that iconic early 10s sound

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): dope

**qazz23** (8): the chorus is really catchy

**synyyy** (8): Disney songs don't hit as hard these days

**Uberpigeon** (8): danny phantom be like

**lagozzino** (7.5): "Like a ghost watch me go"? Are ghosts known for going? I'm pretty sure they're notorious for lingering

**imbaby122** (9): everything about this song is iconic but the strings are so 🤤🤤🤤

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): I’d like her to rerecord this because her voice has developed so much since this song that a rerecording would absolutely slay

**seanderlust** (9): when i'm in a beat the shit out of a car competition and my opponents are jazmine sullivan and carrie underwood

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): Before Before He Cheats there was this

**jsonphile** (8.5): look I’m not a diehard glee fan but Mercedes singing this after smashing kurt’s car because she liked him and he claimed he liked Rachel despite very obviously being gay and her ending it with “well you busted my heart” it’s just iconic. Oh and this version is good too

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): the glee cover of this was a moment in history

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): the impact this song had

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): 2000 IQ to pick an Arcade Fire song with female vocals.

**bridgemoney** (10): When Arcade Fire are good, they're really good.

**celladonn** (10): cannot relate to the person who heard her singing and told her to stop

**frogaranaman** (10): absolutely one of the best songs about suburbia ever created and captures the feeling of the hopeless "opportunity" it provides so, so well

**Gonza\_90** (10): I love this song, one of my favorites songs ever

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): indieheads infiltration

**jman457** (10): Sorry Little Monsters/Katy cats but they deserved this grammy

**pig-serpent** (10): I never thought I liked Arcade Fire but this song is going to make me check them out. It's also going into my hall of fame songs about hating suburbia with Rush's "Subdivisions'' and LTJ's "History of a Boring Town."

**steelstepladder** (10): They really weren't kidding, those shopping malls really do rise like mountains beyond mountains

**thedoctordances1940** (10): always struggle to pick my favourite arcade fire song but this has always been up there, genuinely a perfect song

**TragicKingdom1** (10): why does arcade fire get excluded from the twink indie recs when they put out slays like this all the time?

**vayyiqra** (10): Popheads may be forgiven for what they did to Neighbourhood #1 if they do not rob this

**Verrem** (10): one of the best arcade fire songs, slaps

**WaneLietoc** (10): okay now I get it. yeah by no means one my favorite of regina's AF cuts (i'd even take electric blue over this, or the all time best arcade fire track haiti, a real fever dream that leaves funeral brilliantly). anyways, touching video and endearing stuff.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Damn lucky I love Arcade Fire, cause starting off with "they heard me singing and they told me to stop" is asking to get roasted

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): this is a lot more synthy than I expected arcade fire to be

**starla\_** (9.6): best song on the album

**afs** (9): I didn't know what to expect from arcade fire... but the last word I expected was cute (compliment)

**imbaby122** (9): this song essentially sounds like it’s composed solely of synths but good thing i’m an average popheads synth enjoyer.

**jsonphile** (9): okay so I should probably listen to more Arcade Fire

**MrMoodle** (9): car dependent infrastructure 👎

**seanderlust** (9): do I need to watch the first sprawl to understand the plot?

**SmileAndTears** (9): BOP

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): a little slay of them

**PAHC** (8.7): she's cut- wait why is this song above 5 minutes

**NecroDolphinn** (8.5): I don’t know if I hate the vocals or love them but man this song is just so euphoric. Goes toe to toe with most of what is on Funeral and really melds the synthetic elements strongly with the more organic ones. Also I love the fact that every chorus feels so much bigger than the last and by the end the song has opened up massively. Also, DAMN those instrumental sections hit so hard.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): kill suburbs!!!

**synyyy** (8.5): ew indieheads is infiltrating popheads

**wavingwolves** (8.1): i'm tanking this in spirit bc i'm a contrarian at heart!

**DefaultPophead** (8): Didn't remember liking this album one bit, but this song is making me question my past self.

**MassiveThief** (8): maybe this will help me finally get into an Arcade Fire album that isn't Funeral

**qazz23** (8): not huge on AF overall but this is one of their best, love the synth that runs through this

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Perfect song for easy listening between binge-watching City Beautiful and Not Just Bikes videos

**DirtyRat583** (7.8): i thought arcade fire was more band music. pleasantly surprised

**awry** (7.5): blissful indie pop with an anti-suburbanisational message and TWO key changes... i should love it but i just really like it instead. and that's okay

**BasedButta** (7.5): i like the ending

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): As someone who grew up in the suburbs this is relatable sentiment actually

**plastichaxan** (7.5): this surprised me i didn’t think i’d like it sdfdsfkl

**apatel27** (7.2): Gotta love a good outro

**CrimsonROSET** (7): women of indie pop rock was last cycle you’re a bit late

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i did nawt know there was a woman in arcade fire

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): how many popheads will tank this song because this album beat out the fame monster for aoty at the grammys that year

**rslashpoopheads** (5): not their best!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Sorry but this doesn’t really do anything major for me.

**2dina3dworld** (3): FUCK Arcade Fire, they have one good album, and then they released WE which is an unforgivable crime

**fadedblue09** (3): I would enjoy this a whole lot more if it weren't for the shriekfest vocals

**runaway3212** (3): fucking sux

**skargardin** (7): I'm shocked that this made it all the way into the top 10 honestly. If I'm allowed to speculate, I definitely think its playlist placement helped it coming from the likes of Girl With Basket Of Fruit and Why, but it does bop in its own right so very well deserved either way! Submitted by u/OliviaGodrigo

**CarlieScion** (10): a good ending!

---

**1998tweety** (10): thank god this rate ended on a high note. the whiplash I just had. NEways this would've won the 2021 K-Pop rate but at least it gets to win now!!

**agentofscranton** (10): card carrying youhoe

**anothertown** (10): this is the g spot of the rate

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): idk what to say anymore, yass i guess y'all think of something better

**BasedButta** (10): yeah this slaps

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I want to hear this again.

**flavasavavandal** (10): should’ve been in kpop 2021 instead of the bad songs

**Gonza\_90** (10): I think I really like K-Pop songs about being drunk

**hikk** (10): when this gets boosted just bc it comes after those last 2 "songs" in the ballot order

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): Wasn’t allowed to put it in the Kpop rate so here is my fav song of 2021, rated against Elmo, being the last song on the rate after Ono’s bird calls. Definitely belongs here and not a 2021 Kpop Rate 💬

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I'm so glad the rate playlist ends on a good song, very well deserved after having to suffer through Yoko Ono. Anyways this is a bop.

**ricki** (10): youha had nothing but a microphone and an alcoholism problem, she knew what she had to do to keep the lights on

**rslashpoopheads** (10): honestly seeing this song was what made me decide to do this rate last minute

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): did someone say imalittletipsyplayalongwithme (woohoo!)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): she was too powerful for the 2021 kpop rate she would’ve swept with a 11.000 average

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it just slays

**throwaway-7650** (10): this song being rated again so soon? taylor could never!

**vayyiqra** (10): Basic synthpop but it rules, thanks MK for showing me it o/

**afs** (9.5): if Carly had this I tell you... RAWM would be shaking

**NecroDolphinn** (9.5): I want to fuck this song

**PAHC** (9.5): the true winner of the 2021 kpop rate.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): banger alert!!!!

**synyyy** (9.5): HAH

**gwykiki** (9.2): love her voice, love her sound, love

**imbaby122** (9): and one last euphoric synth pop song to finish off the rate.

**pig-serpent** (9): I think everyone who critiques music on the internet has to pick one, seemingly average synthwave song to become a diehard stan of for no reason, and somehow this is the one I chose. No, I can't really explain why, but I am proud to be one of the three people annoying the 2021 kpop hosts by constantly asking why this song wasn't included.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Potentially might have the best tracklist position in the rate

**itsabop** (8.7): abitboppy

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): it's cute, I see why people wanted it in 2021 kpop

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): bootleg queen

**jman457** (8.5): fun synthpop tune to end this with

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): cruelty-free Future Starts Now

**TiltControls** (8.5): Another great discovery from this rate. It's just too much fun to listen to

**awry** (8): the transition to this after xiu xiu and yoko lmaooo

**DefaultPophead** (8): We meet again.

**qazz23** (8): nice synthwave with good vocals

**runaway3212** (8): deserved to win the 2021 bonus rate btw

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It won one bonus rate already, can it win another?

**wavingwolves** (7.1): SING IT LOUD LIKE HEY!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): slay way to end the rate and i’m only half saying that because there was a 70% chance it’d end on yoko ono instead

**MrMoodle** (7): i’m dying that this song closes out the rate after 10 minutes of experimental noise rock lmfao this rate was good

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Mostly generic but her vocal runs went off

**starla\_** (6.5): a cute bop

**frogaranaman** (5): I've heard this song about a million times before

**shipperondeck** (5): honestly a good palette cleanser after whatever tf just happened in this playlist

**WaneLietoc** (5): earnest

**skargardin** (10): I could NOT belive that The Chase managed to sneak into the top ten of all things, over Superlove? But I'm so here for it. This is absolutely one of the many highlights on 333, I'm just gagged that it's an album-cut that made it this far. Submitted by u/BeauMeringue

---

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): this song makes me feel like I'm ascending

**seanderlust** (11): i'm ascending. i have ascended.

**1998tweety** (10): ascending

**2dina3dworld** (10): she spilt with this

**akanewasright** (10): This was one of my favorites from 333 right out of the gate, so I’m glad this got sent ~~also thank you for not sending any song that would win a 333 album rate BSHDHDH~~

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): ohhh this is good shit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song deserved to be a single and get a Sims-ass music video of its own.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the unbelievable amounts of taste this submitter has for sending this 333 cut omfg …. i love you i wish i could’ve 11d this!

**DefaultPophead** (10): Changed my life last year. Was a serious 11 contender.

**Gonza\_90** (10): Tinashe is very good

**MassiveThief** (10): the production, the vocals, the everything.

**qazz23** (10): really powerful chorus, love when her voice goes high (11 candidate)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): look, I love 333… but of all the tracks to send, this is certainly one of them

**throwaway-7650** (10): deserves to place higher than superlove but it won't

**TiltControls** (10): It's maybe the 5th best song on the album and yet it's still a 10. WHEN IS THE 333 RATE COMING?!?

**shipperondeck** (9.9): only not a ten bc i dont want to look biased giving both tinashe songs 10s here (but she is that good)

**jman457** (9.3): my favorite of the two tinashe songs here

**afs** (9): wtf 333 has songs like this? I wanna check it out now

**gwykiki** (9): see my comment on superlove

**ignitethephoenix** (9): not my favorite track from the album but it’s still so good

**imbaby122** (9): that last chorus omfg my jaw is on the floor im drooling.

**jsonphile** (9): okay so that other Tinashe song had me wondering why she was so popular on this sub but this is much better. Maybe I should actually listen to her

**ReallyCreative** (9): not my favorite from 333 but it's just so lush and gorgeous

**synyyy** (9): I could see you with my third eye at day 3... I hope

**Uberpigeon** (9): nevermind my last comment this slaps

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): yeah this is great

**awry** (8.5): ahh 333 is such a good album

**just\_thonking** (8.5): I really slept on this album until recently

**PAHC** (8.5): i think she mightve never done that

**ricki** (8.5): which chase is she talking about

**itsabop** (8.3): Need to listen to this album more

**camerinian** (8): the only true Chase is The Chase UK hosted by Bradley Walsh. All other Chase iterations are false. Love, Fanny Chmelar

**CrimsonROSET** (8): 333 caprimami you’ll forever be famous

**frogaranaman** (8): outrun is gonna be the next wave

**ImADudeDuh** (8): take the smaller offer, we need you back for the final round

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): [vocal slayage!]

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Perhaps I need to listen to more Tinashe…

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): the better tinashe song in this rate

**Stryxen** (7.3): bouncin future rate winner i can feel it

**rslashpoopheads** (7): it's no superlove

**vayyiqra** (7): It's nice but she can do better

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Sometimes a gay person will say “why isn’t everyone streaming _____ it’s pop perfection!” and then they’ll link it and it’s yet another synthpop song that sounds exactly like this.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): Could've used some more amped-up production from someone like Clarence Clarity or Max Martin or something but it's still a good tune regardless.

**pig-serpent** (5.5): Fine song with a few good moments that knock it up a bit.

**wavingwolves** (5.5): this isn't infinite!??

**starla\_** (5): I love the 80s gated reverb in this but the actual song is mid for me.

**fadedblue09** (4): the falsettos are annoying sorry

**WaneLietoc** (4): this is not very fast and furious

**CarlieScion** (10): AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!

**skargardin** (10): Probably one of the absolute defining peaks of house music! It really is no wonder that it's so well-sampled, even several times this year alone with Charli XCX's "Used To Know Me" and Beyoncé's "Break My Soul". I'm glad that this made top ten even though I would've liked it to place just a bit higher. Submitted by /u/joshually 

---

**akanewasright** (11): idc this is a definitive classic

**1998tweety** (10): absolutely iconic

**awry** (10): i feel like every house song after 1993 tried to be a little like this one. it's like the platonic ideal of a house track

**frogaranaman** (10): I'm gay

**ImADudeDuh** (10): classique

**itsabop** (10): Finally some good fucking food

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): does any other british person remember this song being sampled in some uk house song in like…2013. i can’t find it now but it slays….

**nt96** (10): Robin you will always be iconic

**ReallyCreative** (10): it is a known fact that songs titled Show Me Love by artists named Rob_n released in the early/mid 90s are functionally perfect, absolutely iconic, and culturally essential

**vayyiqra** (10): we need a house rate

**WaneLietoc** (10): real ditty.

**welcome2thejam** (10): If this was submitted before Break My Soul came out, then I need that user to send me lotto numbers asap

**starla\_** (9.8): Kennedy Davenport

**seanderlust** (9.6): ah yes, the sample that is the gift that keeps on giving

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): house music's most impactful song and for a reason

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): i have no idea why beyonce gave her songwriting credit, this does not sound similar to break my soul at all

**camerinian** (9): if you give this an 8 or up and you don't vote for the Y2K Raver Anthems rate next cycle you're a poser

**CrimsonROSET** (9): you know how many poppers have been sniffed to this song

**ignitethephoenix** (9): A.G. Cook production and this song are the only things Charli and Beyoncé have in common

**imbaby122** (9): so when will robin s start sending out kate bush-style updates considering she’s shaping the soundscape of 2022????

**yearofthesoup** (9): iconic

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.8): I'm sure Robin, Allen and Fred's estate must be swimming in money considering how many times this song has been sampled, remixed, interpolated, flipped, dipped, stripped, repainted, refurbished, reused and recycled in the past decade or so alone. The overexposure has kinda made this song a bit overrated but hey, it's still a banger.

**steelstepladder** (8.7): Show me life

**afs** (8.5): there is NO way I've heard this song. nope, Beyonce just ripped off Charli.

**anothertown** (8.5): i guess there will be weird comments about beyonce here

**PAHC** (8.5): the pitched up vocals in the 2nd verse of used to know me tend to throw me off just saying

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): ok obviously i knew a shit ton of songs sampled this but only now hearing the lyrics as well do i realise one of them is F.U.C by IShowSpeed (or well technically the syzy beat that he just straight up stole)

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): im actually ctfu at this and cry for you both being here

**qazz23** (8): synth riff is infections and vocals are really good // often confused this with the Robyn hit of the same name

**synyyy** (8): I'm getting ptsd from something I never knew existed

**TiltControls** (8): I don't know if this was inspired by the Beyonce sampling or just really fantastic timing

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.9): queen of royalties!

**NecroDolphinn** (7.5): Outsold Break My Soul and Used To Know Me

**jman457** (7.2): idk i feel like this didnt build to anything. Def better 90’s house anthems

**2dina3dworld** (7): I think every single sample of this song has done it better than the original

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I hate to say it but this has been outsold multiple times this year.

**DefaultPophead** (7): Not a fave but I do think it deserves a good score.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I wouldn’t like this if this weren’t a classic.

**MrMoodle** (7): ✨house✨ is the new ✨disco✨ on popheads

**ricki** (7): Congratulations to Charli XCX for having the 2nd most successful single from this year that sampled this song, not everyone is able to accomplish that

**rslashpoopheads** (7): the fact that both this song and Hide and Seek permanently have a JAY SAWN DERULOOO engraved in my brain is so tragic

**throwaway-7650** (7): at least the rerecorded version has better vocals

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pro-tip: Don’t rate the quality of dance tracks. Their main goal is to fill you with euphoria on the dance floor. When you’re sitting in your bedroom listening to tracks like this the whole way through trying to take it apart and analyze it, it just kinda ruins the magic….

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): i think i still like beyoncé’s take on it better

**wavingwolves** (6.2): this truly is the blueprint but every other song has used that beat better

**jsonphile** (6): look I get it’s a dance classic that’s been sampled again and again but like I’m just not into this music

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): for a song with such iconic sampling this year… the original is kinda not it (I just really don't like this style of 90s house)

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): a bit overplayed

**pig-serpent** (5): This song and “What They Say” form an overused “I <3 sultry dance music” sample pack and while I like the poppier songs that used this as a stepping stone more than this dance version it’s easy to see why it’s been sampled by two high profile artists in the span of months.

**BasedButta** (2): yes sometimes upbeat songs can be boring too

**skargardin** (10): I'll be completely honest, I had all but forgotten that this song existed prior to this rate and hearing it while rating hit me like a truck, WHAT a throwback. Submitted by u/bookthieving

**CarlieScion** (9): very good

---

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): I like how one of the lyrics is “I was young and in love” like she wasn’t 15 here. For a 15 year old she came in the studio mad as hell!!

**rslashpoopheads** (11): I always liked this one more than Leave

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): i've been riding for her since 2004 why should I stop now?

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A classic piece of art. Play it in the Louvre.

**DefaultPophead** (10): Fave song when I was 8. More than holds up at 23.

**fadedblue09** (10): one of my 11 contenders, a rare example of a teen pop song that somehow holds up as a timeless classic that can resonate with anyone regardless of age

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Her being like 15 makes this so funny… like she was a fetus. It was “too late” because it was past her bedtime.

**gwykiki** (10): i love you queen

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Me when someone submits to a rate after the extension date

**itsabop** (10): Too little too late to finally have this song in a rate

**nt96** (10): free pillows and blankets for the bitches sleeping on this girl's talent

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): almost my eleven

**ReallyCreative** (10): when I say I was gagged before I knew what the word meant, people died!

**ricki** (10): maybe if the jojo’s version of this was as good as the original people would listen to it

**runaway3212** (10): she was so slaying for this

**shipperondeck** (10): we stream the rerecorded version ofc but still a CLASSIC!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**wavingwolves** (10): like are you kidding me??????? those ad-libs on the last chorus topping off with that vocal run.... i've been listening to this song for days bc of this rate...

**xavieryes** (10): a timeless masterpiece

**ImADudeDuh** (9.9): leave (get out) >>

**imbaby122** (9.5): this song should be in history books. the impact this song had when it hit the radio needs to be in the core curriculum.

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): need kelly clarkson to cover this for kellyoke

**akanewasright** (9): yass girl sing to your middle school boyfriend

**PAHC** (9): girl was 15 wow when i was 15 i was like failing every single class

**starla\_** (9): this is another song I found really annoying back in the 2000s but have come around to since

**Stryxen** (9): slayed

**vayyiqra** (9): classic

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): she was so real for singing this at 14

**afs** (8.5): 'i was young' girl you were 15 when you were eating this up

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): her vocals sound SO weird in the chorus i dont like it. otherwise the song is great

**synyyy** (8.5): "i was young and in love" girl you were 15 please

**anothertown** (8): stream jojo's version!!!!!!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this is very mid 2000s but it slays

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me submitting an assignment two weeks after its due

**jsonphile** (8): ohhh so is this who people are referring to when they say “is that a Jojo’s reference?”

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Truly a classic, stream the 2018 version

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Ohh this is JoJo’s song? I literally know nothing about her lol

**TiltControls** (7.7): A throwback bop. Now we just need to get Leave rated too

**seanderlust** (7.5): "in letting you go i'm loving myself" SPEAK ON IT JOJO!!!

**jman457** (7.3): for a nostalgic tune it’s pretty good

**awry** (7): didn't they make an anime about her

**frogaranaman** (7): climax of a Disney movie type beat

**qazz23** (7): the chorus is good but otherwise not much stands out

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it's cute

**MrMoodle** (6): I kind of appreciate this for being so deeply fucking 2006 but i don’t know if i like it for much other reason than that

**pig-serpent** (6): I’ve never been into the 2004 acoustic pop style but her performance is nice.

**Verrem** (5): this era of music should be forgotten

**WaneLietoc** (4.1): 2k10 middle school purgatory damn what a callback. rlly wish wifi wifey or jacob sartorious was in the rate tbh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): boring 2000’s pop radio filler

**skargardin** (8): I wasn't exactly expecting The Cure to make it this far, but good on them! I'll let the 11 commenters speak for this song here as they explain it way more eloquently than I ever could. Submitted by u/ningxin17

**CarlieScion** (6): cute lil song

---

**camerinian** (11): I just melt inside every single time I hear this. It's hopelessly romantic, wistful, intimate yet perfectly huge in its sentimentality. I just love how it's structured almost like a stream of consciousness poem with the incredible instrumental doing the lifting of memorability, and it makes a line as cliché as "I'm in love with you" feel like the most sincere, pit of your gut powerful phrase in the world. I don’t even have the words, some feelings are so strong that words fail you. That’s how I feel when I listen to Just Like Heaven. Speechless every time. No wonder Robert Smith still considers it one of the band’s best.

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (11): There are many really strong tens in this rate, but none of them can touch this song, which is an absolutely perfect song and one of the truly greatest songs of all time

**jsonphile** (11): this is just one of my favorite songs ever. A simply perfect song from beginning to end that captures the feeling of being love better than almost any other love song

**steelstepladder** (11): Genuinely might be my favorite song ever written

**welcome2thejam** (11): Eternally blessed to be around for this song to sweep me off my feet

**2dina3dworld** (10): this reminds me of a bad breakup I went through, and I love the Cure. So yeah, easy 10.

**awry** (10): i guess this is what love feels like huh

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I mean, the title says it all

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Please let Robert Smith not get disrespected in another rate this year…

**celladonn** (10): classic

**Gonza\_90** (10): If this doesn't make top three...

**NecroDolphinn** (10): One of the best pop songs ever made. Men don’t make pop like this anymore like seriously we need a proper male band new wave revival because it would slay so hard. Anyways I love this song its amazing

**nt96** (10): one of the 80s finest songs

**pig-serpent** (10): One of the best songs ever written and I’m upset that I’m not 11ing it because one of the other songs here is just slightly better.

**qazz23** (10): one of the best love songs ever - that piano solo really makes this (11 candidate)

**rslashpoopheads** (10): honestly if this isn't top 10 (and it won't be) I will collapse the basement they run r/p*pheads out of

**starla\_** (10): I was tossing up between this and Closer for my 11. The Cure have been one of my favourite bands since high school and this is their best song in my opinion. I will be crying tears of joy if this wins the rate but I'm just hoping it makes Day 3 tbh.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the cure might be the greatest band of all time actually

**TiltControls** (10): Another classic and possible 11. I know it's men, but it's such a bop how can you not enjoy it

**WaneLietoc** (10): "this is literally the most straight propaganda song ever but its fucking amazing so idc". this comes from a dmd bestie and for my money, its not entirely wrong. LITERALLY every cover of just like heaven can be! Like have you heard the tasteful country version that can show up on Spotify? It's fantastically straight and sweet. Important to this though is that Robert Smith is just such a wife guy that makes us ALL WANNA BE WIFE GUYS TBH!! Like there's a Dinosaur Jr. version of it that SST put out that turns you into a stoner cool music dad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT7IpRx08tE Robert Smith's 80s run of morose pop music created new types of morose wife guys. His anthems are still undefeated and the insane levels of precision and absolute bliss of Just Like Heaven are endearing to this day. A perfect side b opener to kiss me x3 rock on robert! you nailed it king!

**wavingwolves** (10): the soundtrack of my very young self first sapphic romance... this song was made for me...

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): i physically cannot listen to this song without my head in my hands

**akanewasright** (9.5): I’m too single for this shit

**itsabop** (9.5): Loving the classics sprinkled throughout this rate!

**MassiveThief** (9): classic

**runaway3212** (9): The Cure the straight people who deserve all the rights

**seanderlust** (9): oh this is why people are obsessed with the cure (edit: accidentally pasted this comment on the kid laroi song when submitting and was very tempted to just leave it)

**Stryxen** (9): synthpop <3 gay people <3 wow

**vayyiqra** (9): See Robert Smith can make good music, just not with Chvrches

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): omg is that an ava max reference?

**afs** (8.5): can't believe the gaga song started a band 😍 mother mobster's influence

**jman457** (8.3): Not my favorite cure song, but still a fun nostalgic song

**DefaultPophead** (8): Timeless!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): this sounds like it was probably in a movie at some point

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this isnt their best song (which is actually How Not To Drown)

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): eat

**PAHC** (8): the cover becomes incredibly uncomfortable the moment you realize these are actually lips

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): never been a fan of The Cure but this is pretty good

**synyyy** (7.5): of course this is super acclaimed in rym this is dad rock

**1998tweety** (7): its fine, not for me

**CrimsonROSET** (7): run away with me was a response song to this its true

**imbaby122** (7): i like this song but i don’t think you’ll catch me listening to the cure again any time soon i don’t want to be associated with their kind.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Uhh it’s cute

**bridgemoney** (6.8): More of a Smiths stan tbh.

**throwaway-7650** (6): still pissed about how not to drown's robbery

**shipperondeck** (5.5): sorry i can't be a fan of the cure since they despised duran duran despite the fact that dd loved and respected them

**plastichaxan** (3): yeah this isn't for me

**skargardin** (10): Submitted by.... ME! Did I submit this as winner bait? And what if i did! What's so funny to me is that is after the peak of September's career in like the late 00s, she retired the September moniker and started to make mom pop under her real name Petra Marklund so I guess in a sense we really did never see September again! Other than on her brilliantly stupid album Love CPR, please stream! 

**CarlieScion** (9): this is such winner bait lmao

---

**1998tweety** (10): ended that fad charli

**awry** (10): this song is pretty much the 1st grade anthem for me. i can just smell those wax crayons in my blue hot wheels pencil case. also the album version >>>> the uk eurodance edit. it's so classy and dynamic!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Damn she’s kind of being a dick to this guy…

**camerinian** (10): God, get a load of how perfect all of these melodies are

**CrimsonROSET** (10): lotion you’ll forever be famous

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m so glad this became a meme because it meant that the Pandora station at my old job would play it sometimes and every time it came on it saved my life

**ignitethephoenix** (10): if I had a nickel for every europop song in this charity rate that was sampled by Charli xcx on Crash, I would have 2 nickels. Which isn’t a lot but weird that it happened twice

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is the biggest gay anthem than anything else in this rate

**imbaby122** (10): just found out i’ve been listening to the radio mix… what’s the difference???? anyways this song is life changing.

**itsabop** (10): Charli could never

**ReallyCreative** (10): people died, people were killed !

**ricki** (10): ava max would have done this sample justice

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I used to be so obsessed with September and this song

**shipperondeck** (10): top 5 probably

**SmileAndTears** (10): BANGER

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): [redacted] could NEVER

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): she let charli copy her homework but gave her all the wrong answers

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream the beg for you A. G. cook/vernon remix

**steelstepladder** (9.5): B-B-B-B-BANGER

**starla\_** (9.4): slay

**afs** (9): this is the YASS and SLAY of the rate.

**anothertown** (9): both this and charli each have their own je ne sais pussy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): BANGER

**Uberpigeon** (9): a classic

**vayyiqra** (9): I love Scandipop

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Oh it’s that song

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): omg i love beg for you 😍

**synyyy** (8.5): good stuff I guess

**WaneLietoc** (8.2): this music video is wild cool sub-3 min ditty

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): the comments on this one will definitely be original and won't all mention the same person, anyways stream basketball shoes by black country new road

**DefaultPophead** (8): It's 2008. You're decorating your Nicktopolis room...

**fadedblue09** (8): kinda basic cheesy europop elevated by the singer's soulful vocals (something neither Charli nor Rina have)

**jman457** (8): Honestly I hadn’t heard of this song until Beg for you came out, maybe that scews my score or makes it more “pure”.

**PAHC** (8): its giving

**qazz23** (8): like the synth and dancey beat of this

**2dina3dworld** (7.8): Beg for You did it better, I fear

**Gonza\_90** (7.5): Oh is THAT song

**jsonphile** (7.5): huh why does this song sound familiar…oh shit Charli and Rina interpolated this song?? Huh gonna be honest I actually like beg for you a bit more than this song

**plastichaxan** (7.5): two songs charli xcx outsold in the rate???

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): outsold beg for you

**wavingwolves** (6.8): i'm just one more comment mentioning charli xcx

**pig-serpent** (6.5): As an Angel who never heard this until now I’m conflicted on most of this, but one thing I’m not conflicted on is that the main riff reminds me of David Guetta or Swedish House Mafia songs in a bad way, but even then Beg For You’s drop is so much weaker that it makes me like this version of it a lot more. Ugh, why’d you do this to me.

**Stryxen** (6.5): cool on this but it’s a good song

**slimboyfriend** (6.4): just because it came out first doesn’t mean it’s better!!

**runaway3212** (6): beg for you outslayed

**TiltControls** (6): A classic for sure, but I don't really love this as much as the other dance throwbacks that are in the rate

**welcome2thejam** (6): It's got one great hook, a decent pounding rhythm, and the singer works well for the track type. Not much else, but what it does have is great.

**MrMoodle** (5): don’t get the hype tbh. instrumental feels limp. still better than beg for you though lol

**skargardin** (10): Popheads seemed to be really picky about which synthpop and not they liked this rate, huh? For what it's worth I'm glad that this made the top five, dare I say that it already has that modern classic energy to it. Submitted by u/ignitethephoenix

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): You’re not typical. wipes tear from eye You’re the eleven.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): oh hey it’s my submission! There were a few things I wanted to submit and I originally submitted a song by men before i was talked out of it. Anyway I think this is one of the more underrated pop songs from the past decade, it deserved to be so much bigger outside Canada and it’s honestly pop perfection.

**starla\_** (11): I'm contractually obliged to give this my 11. T&S have been my favourite artist for like 10 years and this is one of my most listened to songs ever. I literally played it on repeat for days at a time at one point. It's not the best song ever but it fills me with joy.

**1998tweety** (10): mega bop

**celladonn** (10): Bop smash etc etc

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): still weird to me that they’re sisters but this song is really good!

**Gonza\_90** (10): This song is a party

**hikk** (10): CANADIAN CLASSIC......

**ImADudeDuh** (10): love these canadian lesbian bitches

**imbaby122** (10): pop perfection. go lesbians!

**jman457** (10): Tegan & Sara were trailblazers in Lesbian rights

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): after seeing Aly & AJ perform this live this song automatically became a ten in my mind

**ricki** (10): im still a little mad we did the indieheads exchange over the closer rate

**Roxieloxie** (10): when this wins omg

**rslashpoopheads** (10): gay anthem

**throwaway-7650** (10): I overplayed this but I can't not give it a 10. lisbon!

**TiltControls** (10): Vote 2010s Canadian synthpop if you liked this and also vote it anyways if you didn't and want to see it lose

**vayyiqra** (10): Peak Canadacore, I would love if it won

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): So today I learned I actually know a Tegan & Sara song!

**wavingwolves** (10): this is just a classic

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): let's go lesbians let's go!

**akanewasright** (9): we need Canadian synthpop!

**anothertown** (9): when this was on top 40 radio, that was a huge moment for lesbian culture

**bridgemoney** (9): Only the third best song called closer.

**itsabop** (9): Let's go lesbian anthem

**welcome2thejam** (9): Got a weird feeling this is gonna be a big rate villain, but a hook like that deserves a solid spot

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): damn they're right like sometimes it is NOT just all physical …

**afs** (8.5): I cannot believe both closers are side by side even though they are listed alphabetically based on the artist names

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): lets me pretend that being a gay teen in 2013 was actually really fun

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): you are not the one

**camerinian** (8): gotta hand it to Tegan and Sara, it takes talent to sell out this well

**CrimsonROSET** (8): let’s go lesbians!

**DefaultPophead** (8): y'all have tried so hard to get me to like them and it's happening.

**pig-serpent** (8): This used to be one of my favorite songs ever, and it hasn’t survived the overplay. The bombast is ecstatic but I feel like I stopped noticing new things about the song super early on and it’s just had diminishing returns since.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This song is actually pretty good but who on their team decided it was a good idea for them to release 26 REMIXES of this song? (I'm not making that number up btw)

**Stryxen** (8): synthpop <3 gay people <3 wow

**synyyy** (8): sorry but I prefer Closer (JPN Version)

**Uberpigeon** (8): lets go lesbians!! wait are they lesbians or sisters i always forget

**awry** (7.8): i'm not a fan of the beginning of this song but that chorus hits every time

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): when are we rating the con

**PAHC** (7.5): its good! i like the chorus but spotify constantly recommending it kinda made it flop a bit

**plastichaxan** (7): currently having performance trauma with this song dñkfslldfsj

**qazz23** (7): at least it's not the chainsmokers

**ReallyCreative** (7): love the chorus but everything else is kinda blah, justice for BWU which was beyond robbed in its rate!

**WaneLietoc** (5.9): "the twins revisit their roots...in their hands, they become mantras, glimmering and hopeful and full of sparkle." my brother started ironically texting me about their 2k19 album when I was getting PR for it and it made me laugh.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): this song just falls into that really generic synthpop lane that feels so devoid of emotion for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): closer tierlist: ne-yo > saweetie > nine inch nails > goapele > tegan and sarah > chainsmokers

**fadedblue09** (5): this is just….typical indie synthpop

**MrMoodle** (5): i don’t like pop music that sounds like this and i don’t know how to elaborate on that sorry

**runaway3212** (3): lesbians stan better music challenge [IMPOSSIBLE]

**CarlieScion** (10): submitted by MOI

**skargardin** (9): I just saw Kina, girl! When I tell you that things did not start out well for this song (see graph), it managed to climb all the way to the third place when all was said and done. Love that for my co-host! I knew of course that Lucy Dacus and this song in particular has its stans so it's not hard to see why it did so well in the rate. Submitted by u/CarlieScion

---

**1998tweety** (11): I ascend when she starts screaming, kinda like how i go upstairs to my room when i hear my parents screaming.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): literally my favorite song of all time, one of the most cathartic, comforting, and emotional songs I have ever heard

**PAHC** (11): i introduced like a solid 5 alties to pop with this. the pipeline is real

**Stryxen** (11): i could 11 something else but i would be lying. My 2nd most played song of all time and 4th on my all time favs list.

**wavingwolves** (11): italicized oh moment

**2dina3dworld** (10): shout out to my friend who dislikes this song because they think the first line is “cringe”

**akanewasright** (10): …man. So much of this song just hits too close to home

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She’s just…oh my god…it’s just so…dies of slay

**bridgemoney** (10): Lucy is just so good at dunking on men, it should literally be studied in universities.

**camerinian** (10): so good of Lucy to volunteer herself for the night shift in the middle of this staffing shortage.

**celladonn** (10): Lucy's masterpiece

**CrimsonROSET** (10): rip boygenius i guess?

**imbaby122** (10): the og happier than ever. those last two minutes are unmatched.

**jman457** (10): I wouldn’t mind if Lucy dacus was a two time winner

**just\_thonking** (10): Things Lucy Dacus and Dolly Parton have in common: 1) Avoiding 9 to 5 jobs, 2) Getting high scores from me

**MassiveThief** (10): crescendo-core, but good

**NecroDolphinn** (10): Beautiful lyrics. Beautiful vocals. Incredible build. The climax of this song is one of the best moments on this whole rate. She slayed.

**nt96** (10): As someone who worked the night shift, this speaks to me but that’s as far as it goes tho

**ReallyCreative** (10): as someone who worked midnights for a while, yeah

**Roxieloxie** (10): Im not an indie hoe at all but I remember this song was on a blend that i made with one of my good friends and i felt bad skipping anything and this was one of the songs that i picked up from that experience. Honestly this is an 11 contender for me im not sure what it is about this song that makes it so good to me and separates it from almost every other song in this genre but just,, yeah

**seanderlust** (10): Lucy at her absolute lyrical best

**thedoctordances1940** (10): it's just like the best song i'd ever heard

**throwaway-7650** (10): make sure to give hot & heavy your 10s in AS6

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hearing this play across the field at Pitchfork Fest while standing in the Jbrekkie waiting room and seeing near everyone around me go apeshit for it made it click

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): this is exactly what i did, except my version of taking the night shift was moving 3000 miles away from our hometown

**starla\_** (9.7): the first time Spotify didn't put this song on every Daily Mix, I had a coughing fit

**afs** (9.5): Night Shift Vs LOONATIC... who will be the new theme of phcj?

**astrologicalangelel** (9.5): this one is gonna hit different during sad girl hours

**jsonphile** (9.5): okay phcj (may it rest in peace) told me I should listen to this artist maybe it’s time I listened to them

**WaneLietoc** (9.1): Undeniable chorus and a good "im leveling up to Matador" ditty.

**frogaranaman** (9): uh oh! this one hurts!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): her best song easily, also this is how you make a long song without it feeling long

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): boygenius rate when

**pig-serpent** (9): The two halves of this song work perfectly together.

**synyyy** (9): I still haven't forgiven you for that indie rock rate fiasco

**TiltControls** (9): Between this and Home Video I really have to check out the rest of Lucy's stuff

**awry** (8.8): real question: is it dah-cuss or day-kiss

**MrMoodle** (8.5): the popheadscirclejerk lady is pretty good

**DefaultPophead** (8): Not my fave Lucy song, but it's the one that kick-started our relationship so it'll always be special to me.

**flavasavavandal** (8): man I really wish I had time to let myself sink into this, because I could see this growing into a 10 with repeated listens and actually listening to the album

**ImADudeDuh** (8): oh wow

**qazz23** (8): love the buildup to the noisy outro

**Uberpigeon** (8): it ends slay but the start is kinda zzz

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Sorry y’all. I wanted to love this. But it feels like something is missing, like it doesn’t quite reach the highs of the best Home Video songs. Idk… it seems a bit too rambly and lacks catchy hooks. Obviously the writing is amazing and I’m still rating it high, but personally I think I’d sooner go to other songs to get my Lucy fix…

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I’d say “this is why you shouldn’t date indie girls, they’ll write a long ass song about you,” but apparently loneliness and emotional distance only makes them stronger

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.4): i almost did a double take when I heard her sing about tasting someone else’s spit

**rslashpoopheads** (7): they didn't have me in the first half but this song is a smash

**vayyiqra** (7): It's kind of boring at first but great once it picks up

**RandomHypnotica** (6): I've tried to like this, but it just does nothing for me I'm afraid

**shipperondeck** (6): pleaseeee please please dont get mad at me

**anothertown** (5): the christmas after this album came out i was at my in-laws house. my brother in law got my sibling in law this album on vinyl, and my sibling dropped the needle right then and there on christmas morning and we all had to sit around the tree and listen to Track 1 Night Shift

**BasedButta** (5): meh, the payoff for that drearyland at the first half isn't even that good

**runaway3212** (5): steam HTE by billie!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): just because a song is 6 minutes long it doesn’t automatically make it good

**fadedblue09** (4): Idk….after doing the Indie Girls rate, I can tell Lucy's a good lyricist, but every other aspect of her music just falls flat to me, sorry

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): the first line of this is gross as hell yes i will kinkshame her what are yall gonna do beat my ass?

**DirtyRat583** (0): just go to therapy already

**CarlieScion** (10): the slay section begins

**skargardin** (10): So close yet so far! Murder On The Dancefloor was second for most of the rate, but really it could never contend with the power of Jolene. Even so, I'm happy that we're giving this classic its flowers. Personally this is the type of pop music that I just love, like I can't find any faults with this. Submitted by u/nootnoot781

---

**nootnoot781** (11): a literal slay

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): I mean, come on, how can I not love this song?

**RandomHypnotica** (11): talk about an absolute classic… such a perfectly smooth, delicious song

**1998tweety** (10): mega bop

**awry** (10): wish i had something to say other than "this is such a banger" and "i always read her last name as ellis-brexit in my mind but i can't ever come up with a pun good enough for that"

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Quick! Somebody call the police officer from the Village People.

**camerinian** (10): I don't even know how to put into words just how perfect a pop song this is. It's self-evident just how much care was put into the craft of every second of this, from the irresistible groove, to Sophie’s playful and coy delivery, to the timbre of the lyrics to the touches of strings and funk guitar. Like, just head to toe, utterly irresistible. I will be unbelievably happy if this wins and also not surprised in the slightest, because its greatness is just blindingly obvious.

**celladonn** (10): such a slay

**cremeebrulee** (10): 2020 nu disco rate:

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this was a serious 11 contender, and a song i’ve recommended to people multiple times. The energy is just infectious.

**DefaultPophead** (10): Queen Shit.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): oh god… the yass bomb… there were no survivors

**ignitethephoenix** (10): timeless classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): colonize me mommy

**lagozzino** (10): what is there to say about it that hasn't been said? it's like it was scientifically calculated to be the perfect pop song

**nt96** (10): yassssss slit my throat!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): When I go to the club after eating Chipotle

**ReallyCreative** (10): I feel like this song is absolutely ripe for a sample that goes viral/smashes the charts but here we are

**runaway3212** (10): she's so mother for this

**Stryxen** (10): i smell a winner

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is why cascada told us to evacuate

**throwaway-7650** (10): try not to say mother etc.

**TiltControls** (10): If any other song besides my 11 could win I hope it's this one. It's so damn catchy

**welcome2thejam** (10): If I were her wingman, would it make me an accessory to murder?

**shipperondeck** (9.9): this could win

**DirtyRat583** (9.6): camp in its purest form

**WaneLietoc** (9.6): Everyone knows this ditty! i bet wall-e and EVE had RAD [redacted] to this!

**PAHC** (9.5): one of the songs that truly got me to stan sophie. not her best but very good

**seanderlust** (9.5): this song is so sexy

**apatel27** (9.3): Feels incomplete without the MV adlibs

**anothertown** (9): i think this is supposed to be a classic that i've never heard. Well, it's very good

**BasedButta** (9): the violins!!!!

**frogaranaman** (9): this is way too good for its own right

**qazz23** (9): this would fit right in with the recent disco revival

**synyyy** (9): Sophie I'm going to murder you because your Spotify is unavailable in my area

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I should not have watched the music video because WHAT was that?? Why did she roofie those innocent Latino dancers?

**wavingwolves** (8.8): crime fiction title realness

**afs** (8.5): please stream sophie more she was as campy as it got (BITTERSEEET UGH)

**imbaby122** (8.5): i need to be on the dance floor NOW someone take me to the dance floor!!!!!!

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): she didn't have to serve like this but she did

**starla\_** (8.4): Sophie Ellis-Bextor could murder me on the dancefloor and I would love every second of it

**jman457** (8.3): boped a bit, but I legit thought it was Walking on a Dream with the intro

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): i always think that she's about to say "so you better not steal the moon"

**ricki** (8): i am bopping but i feel like someone should do something about the murder idk

**Uberpigeon** (8): she was so british for this

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): i mean yeah it's obviously good but i'm just not the biggest disco fan

**slimboyfriend** (7): I get that it’s a metaphor but she seems so unbothered by murder and arson

**vayyiqra** (7): It's good but I have zero nostalgia for it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this better not get top 10

**gwykiki** (6): a british classic but luckily i'm not british

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Quite underwhelmed by this. The instrumental break was cute ig

**skargardin** (10): And we have our winner!! For the entire rate, this was the undisputed winner, nothing came close to beating it, I'm sorry Jolene antis, you really tried but it was in vain. Given how this pretty much is an all-time country classic that's at least seemingly universally loved, it's not hard to see why it won this rate. Congratulations to miss Dolly and u u/2dina3dworld who submitted it for the win!

**CarlieScion** (6): I never really fully got this song and idk if its ballad phobia or radio phobia or whatever but its just Good, not Great

---

**2dina3dworld** (11): I can’t believe I submitted this as winner bait only for it to flop

**astrologicalangelel** (11): I had to give this an 11, it's what Dolly deserves

**gwykiki** (11): the feminism leaving my body when i listen to jolene

**moooo566** (11): there's a lot of really good songs here, a few great ones, but this is the only one which is genuinely a legendary track.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i swear if this gets fast car'd

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**awry** (10): masterful songwriting

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): iconic as fuck

**babadork** (10): If the babadog had a choice for an 11, it would definitely be this song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Invented infidelity.

**celladonn** (10): Very hard to predict a winner in this rate but I think this has a pretty strong shot

**CrimsonROSET** (10): classic.

**DefaultPophead** (10): Look at me. Day 3 bait and I just placed my lip on the hook.

**DirtyRat583** (10): all aboard the camp bus to dollywood

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the only legendary song in this rate (sorry Closer JPN version!)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): so this is the obvious winner right?

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): This song is probably overrated but I still have to pay it proper respect

**itsabop** (10): One of Dolly's finest

**jsonphile** (10): do I need to explain why this is a 10? It’s an all time classic and Dolly Parton is a national treasure. We all know this.

**krusso1105** (10): And now I am tempted to submit this to a future rate: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkbFeu6IZwY

**nt96** (10): When I catch that bitch Jolene, its ON SIGHT

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): too iconic to give less than ten

**ReallyCreative** (10): exactly, and I told her, I said ma'am

**rslashpoopheads** (10): jo mama lol.

**runaway3212** (10): Dolly's voice is like that of an angel I love her so much

**seanderlust** (10): it's honestly hard to write a comment for this one - how do you write a quick comment for one of the greatest songs about the other woman of all time? dolly approaches the subject matter with such empathy that's rarely seen tbh - it's easy to write a song saying "that other girl is nothing" but to write one saying "the other woman is gorgeous and wonderful and I can't compare"?? it's never been done quite this well.

**starla\_** (10): classic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i mean come on now…one of the best songs of all time

**TiltControls** (10): This could pull off the uncontroversial win and it'd be pretty deserved

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Bisexual awakening classic

**WaneLietoc** (10): she's so talented and she funded covid vaccine research american iconoclast. rock on dolly!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Kind of a perfect song tbh

**PAHC** (9.5): beg for you ft rina sawayama

**thedoctordances1940** (9.1): yeah it's a classic

**frogaranaman** (9): me to Dolly: please don't take NFT endorsement deals just because you can :(

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is probably gonna win but I have to deduct a point because I can’t stop thinking about that slowed down version that went viral on tumblr a while ago

**imbaby122** (9): easy solution dolly just kiss jolene.

**just\_thonking** (9): Kinda worried this will win but I'm unable to score it any lower than this

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): This song belongs in American History textbooks the way it’s still known by everyone today

**qazz23** (9): one of the best country songs ever, covered many times but nothing beats the original

**Stryxen** (9): first verse passes the bechdel test, the man is so irrelevant in this lol

**throwaway-7650** (9): MILEY CYRUS YOU WILL ALWAYS BE FAMOUS <3

**jman457** (8.8): such a gay icon

**shipperondeck** (8.8): i wanna go to dollywood so bad honestly

**ricki** (8.5): this song has done more for miley cyrus’ career than it ever did for dolly

**slimboyfriend** (8.4): it deserves a 10, but that’s too easy

**BasedButta** (8): its jolene time!!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): love the groove on this one, a classic.

**vayyiqra** (8): Giving this score out of respect because this is a great song I just never listen to it

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is the most boring winner ever but it’s like. Still a classic ig

**synyyy** (7.5): her vocals are giving not

**cremeebrulee** (7): dolly please if he’s already acting like this you shouldn't want him either

**flavasavavandal** (7): if I knew i wasn't going to be the only one to submit country to charity I would've submitted something country that I liked more

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): okay but why is she begging Jolene to not take her man? like... girl... he cheated. Dump his ass. this woman has nothing to do with all of this. idk this song doesn't make sense to me..

**RandomHypnotica** (6): Dolly Parton as a person? A+. Dolly's music? Well...

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

## Songs

Congrats to **Jolene** for beating out the other titans of the rate! With a 9.076 **Jolene** places 275th across all songs. It sits right below Magdalena Bay's You Lose! and right above Arca's KLK.

Though there aren't many records to be set on the highest scoreboards, the same can't be said for the bottom!

* With an abyssmal 3.578, Flossie and The Unicorns - The Halloween Puppet Show takes a spot on the lowest rated songs list as the 22nd worst rated song of all time! It scored slightly better than Train's Drive By and slightly worse than Tyga's Rack City

* **The Halloween Puppet Show** also grabs a top 10 (bottom 10?) finish for most 0's given in a rate! With 24 0's to its name it takes a 10th place spot for most 0's given to a song. It ties with Taylor Swift's Bad Blood from the original rate rerate

 * Yet another record for **The Halloween Puppet Show** as it also takes a spot on the 0 Magnets list for getting 24.20% of the participants to use their 0 on it! This puts it in 8th overall for that stat.

That's not all for Flossie, as we've also got 2 new additions to the **most controversial songs** leaderboard!

* With a staggering 3.655 **Flossie and the Unicorns - The Halloween Puppet Show** manages to become the 5th most controversial song we've ever rated! It sits behind Closer, Shoes, and stupid horse - all from All Stars 4 - and another Closer from the 2016 EP Rate.

* **Yoko Ono - Why** also manages a spot on the controversy list at #16

For non-Flossie related stats: 

* While this version of Closer is counted separately, this would be its 6th time being rated, tying the record currently held by Adele's Rolling in the Deep. It also would become the only song to have 3 songeniality wins (or 4 depending if you count non-democratically selected wins).

## Artists

Though she picked up her first win today, not all is well for Dolly. With a 0 for Jolene she gets her first 0 and takes her off of the no 0's list. Now there are only 13 artists left with this feat.

Way too many songs and no new artists had enough for the average board so I'll just mentioned whether the existing artists boosted or dropped their previous average

**Increased**

* Lucy Dacus (previously 62nd, now 54th)
* Dolly Parton (previously 87th, now 68th)
* Tegan & Sara (previously 96th, now 83rd)
* Tinashe (previously 130th, now 123rd)
* LOONA (previously 205th, now 195th)
* Avril Lavigne (previously 238th... still 238th)
* Drake (previously 272nd... also still 272nd)
* The Chainsmokers (previously 308th, now 306th)
* Justin Beiber (previously 320th, now 319th)

**Decreased**

well

* Evanescence (previously 101st, now 106th)

## Rates

* With everyone except one person using their 11 (and probably the first time this has happened with the one person not giving one having a certain role lmao), Charity Rate 4 places on the leaderboard for **highest percentage of participants using their 11**! With 98.99% it sits in the 8th place spot joining its other Charity siblings Charity 1 (1st, 100%) and Charity 3 (7th, 99.05%)

* Charity 4 also joins on the related leaderboard for **highest percentage of participants to use their 0**! With 82.83% of users giving theirs out, it sits in 5th overall. Right ahead of it is the only Charity Rate to be missing from the previous list, Charity 2, with 82.89%
