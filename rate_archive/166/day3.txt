# ~~[DO SONGENIALITY](https://forms.gle/uzZhTz7uHXewYRET8) CLOSE AT BEFORE TOP 5~~ Safaera - Bad Bunny won Songeniality with 14 votes

We are your hosts /u/Flavasavavandal and /u/TiltControls welcome to All Stars 6 Rate Reveal Day 3… the final day

Guys, we're here, [it's been almost 2 months in the planning](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050753779726819409/1079492438500061314/day_3.png), but we're here. It's day 3 of All Stars 6 Rate. These past few days have been tragic, most of you won't survive today, others may. Today we will be revealing #21 - #1 starting at 9pm GMT or an hour after this post goes up. I hope to see you in the [queup room](https://www.queup.net/join/losers-6) for the event of your life. If you are new the way things usually work in the queup room it usually goes "a hint to a song ---> song itself ---> slay interlude". 

I'm sure you have loads of questions, like how is Bjork still in, how is girls aloud still in and will Charli finally win a rate. They are all good questions (except that 2nd one) and I'm glad they could be asked. We have answers for them but you'll have to wait and find out.

Stats

* [102 lovely people](https://pastebin.com/wVKW0L2W) did All Stars 6
* The average score for this rate was 7.594. and the average controversy score was 2.273 (this is a standard deviation, anything with a controversy score higher than this is considered controversial)

FlavaSavaVandal: # For the Finals of the flops, we pitted the remaining songs against eachother to find out who's making the finals and 59 of you participated in this:

1. Cardi B - I Like It vs Little Simz - Woman
3. Closer JPN vs Chvrches - Asking For A Friend

in a thrilling battle, but only 4 songs could progress to our semi-finals and here they are:

**Matchup 1:**

>![Woman continues her dominating fashion throughout the bracket, with just unde 2/3rds of people voting for Little Simz, although this was the closest she came to falling, Woman will be the first song in the Finals and will go against...](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1079475592518447145/semis_1.JPG)!<

**Matchup 2:** 

>![Meme verses robbed synthpop band, it was a lot closer than matchup 1 with a 57.6% to 42.4% split between the two songs, but only one could win. And it was the correct choice. Closer JPN will face up against Woman in the Finals](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1079475592736555098/semis_2.JPG)!<

That said the fact that some of these songs survived over Just Like Heaven and Look at the Sky is a travesty.

**TiltControls** (10): An almost 11 gatekeeping my actual 11 from day 3, the rate gods really do hate me. This and Triple Dog Dare were on near loop the first time I listened to the album

---

**musical\_pyn** (11): I think lucy dacus is one of the best songwriters currently writing. She just has the perfect balance between catchy melodies/hooks and incredibly diaristic but refined lyricism, and this song is no exception

**shhhneak** (11): LUCY DACUS THIS WILL BE YOUR YEAR!!

**1998tweety** (10): me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Lots of music sounds like a warm, cozy blanket but Lucy’s is, for me personally, the warmest and the coziest.

**bogo** (10): yep still hits like a truck

**camerinian** (10): Lucy Dacus just melts my heart like butter every time I hear her voice, she starts crooning and I'm in the palm of her hand, at her live show I was honestly like Nelson Muntz watching Andy Williams, her music is sweet but never sickly, sensitive but resolute, empathetic but honest, and Hot & Heavy exemplifies all of those traits. When given a free text box to simp for Lucy I will always grasp it with both hands

**CrimsonROSET** (10): please lucy you can beat jbrekkie this time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Lucy Dacus is so talented yasss. If you like this stream Bats - Blue Cabinet

**frogaranaman** (10): bears

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this has one of the most beautiful outros I've ever heard. I gave it my eleven before, but I discovered a jam. Sorry, Lucy!

**jman457** (10): such a great song, but one true regret from last season was not giving night shift an 11.

**MassiveThief** (10): This song is pure perfection. If literally a top 5 song for me weren't also in this rate it would be an easy 11. So effortlessly catchy and beautiful.

**Nagisoid** (10): Hot & Cold (Lucy's Version) God, I love this song. The songwriting here is truly stellar, and the drums here are so simple and comfy, and the guitars at the end are so urethral they make me ascend.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song gets better every time I listen to it wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me after climbing 2 flights of stairs

**Stryxen** (10): insane I'm sweating and gasping for air just listening to this

**thedoctordances1940** (10): omg it's one of her two good songs

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): mother

**throwaway-7650** (10): THIS SHOULD'VE BEEN IN WINNERS 3 hate 🗾

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): : Am I an iconic and influential American television comedy from the 50’s? Because I Love Lucy

**welcome2thejam** (10): Now even hotter & heavier

**akanewasright** (9): yeah this is pretty good

**imbaby122** (9): you know i haven’t gotten hot & heavy in my parent’s house but it’s still a possibility bc i would live in my mom’s basement before i lived alone.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): I’m sad now

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): gay

**phonethephoenix** (8.2): nice! My mom loves this song lol

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is how i describe my ass

**runaway3212** (8): boygenius is coming!!!

**shipperondeck** (7.8): oh i liked this a lot actually

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): im still sorry for playing this as an interlude for weight in drag rate JKDENDJE

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): i love the intro and certain other parts, but overall its just kind of regular. it gives coming of age movie.

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.5): lucy you son of a blobby! you found the theatre showing "home movie!" and then under a pretty workhorse instrumental you told me a story that lulled me to sleep!

**bigbigbee** (7): I acknowledge that this song is fairly similar to Phoebe Bridgers Kyoto, and so I want to like this just as much as I like that one, and maybe I will someday, but it hasn’t happened yet

**intheaftermath** (7): ok sorry I just need to get this out there - night shift is NOT the song you all think it is. This is so much better and it's not even incredible.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): needs some more oomph but it's not bad

**qazz23** (7): like the upbeat sound of this

**vayyiqra** (7): yeah it's nice I feel like Lucia (from Middle English Lucy, from Old French Lucie (notably after the Christian martyr Lucia of Syracuse), from Latin Lucia (feminine of Lucius, a Roman praenomen), from lux (“light”) Dacian (adjectival form of Latin Dacia, ancient kingdom in Central and South-Eastern Europe) is "not for me" but it's alright

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s cute but not something i would listen to myself

**timothy444** (5.5): Decent but forgettable; bordering on mid

**03O9** (5): boring.. yawning… sloppy… lazy!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): still as boring as i remember it!

**daythreeinmiami** (4.9): This is the type of song I would listen to if I was having bad insomnia that night.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Honestly this style of indie confessional music has started to creep me out, it feels personal in an almost uncomfortable way

**DirtyRat583** (3): its cute i guess

**anothertown** (2): sounds like corrugated cardboard

**flava** (9.5): true

**TiltControls** (6.5): I should’ve tanked her more. Really though this is probably one of the Bjork songs I’m a little more lenient to, but I don’t really see it over the bloodbath that happened day 2 (aka My High getting eliminated)

---

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (11): One of the most important songs in my life

**nootnoot781** (11): i hate how much my mental health has hinged on an icelandic weirdo ugh

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I, too, go through all this before you wake up

**03O9** (10): if you aren’t floored by this you’re not listening right

**akanewasright** (10): the best song ever made

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): An all time amazing song. If I were using a supercomputer to determine my 11 it would probably be this.

**bluehxrizon** (10): mother

**bogo** (10): https://twitter.com/chrisfluming/status/1576061363201327104?t=x1LdVA-0IUfBBkLklORPZA&s=19

**camerinian** (10): yearning experimental trance anthem by Björk. That's a gorgeous collection of words isn't it

**Frajer** (10): if Bjork dropped car parts bottles and cutlery off a mountain on to my head I'd say thank you

**frogaranaman** (10): it’s called hyperballad because the Ball gets Hype when ir comes on

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of her best!

**imbaby122** (10): if all my friends jumped off a cliff i wouldn’t. but if icelandic singer/songwriter/producer/actress björk jumped off a cliff i absolutely would

**impla77** (10): Do you ever just want to throw shit off a cliff?

**MassiveThief** (10): goat song

**Nagisoid** (10): LOONA's wigs were so snatched they never released their version. The strings are so good, the beat is amazing, and this is the peak of her pre-Vulnicura lyricism. The cover art is camp, too.

**nt96** (10): Oh. My. GOSH. What do I have to say about this song? Well, this is like a rollercoaster, there's ups and downs, it's dynamic, it's VERY deceptive and perfectly balanced; it has a waltz yet it's four-on-the-floor, it's feels soft and humble but it hides a vivacious energy, it's rave music but it's acoustic at the same time. Hyperballad is one of Bjork's greatest attempts at bridging pop and avant-garde and don’t get me started on that buildup! It easily sits alongside In The Air Tonight as one of the greatest buildups of all time and it never fails to boost my adrenaline. Every time, I listen to that buildup, whether it's the high hats, the soft shuffling drums or even the violins, I'm always finding a different instrument to focus on, and every time it brings a different kind of excitement and flavor. The fact that this song was my top played song on Spotify for the past 2-3 years is a testament to how much this song means to me and why I submitted this song to Ratemas in the first place. To me, this is true pop perfection and that's not changing anytime soon. Vote for PEGGED!!!!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): the spotify playlist shows “Hyper-ballad” and i lost my mind thinking i was experiencing the mandela effect

**pig-serpent** (10): I'm not sure I consider this a 10 yet, but I'm pretty sure I will in a year or 2, so I'm going to hedge my bets and make future me like me.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is so best song ever made vibes

**qazz23** (10): one of her best songs, the chorus is really strong, and I like when the dancey beats come in

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I feel sorry if you don't get hyper-ballad

**runaway3212** (10): will this trigger hyperballadphobia

**sarcasticsobs** (10): MUSIC

**Stryxen** (10): I had my post record hung up on my wall until I saw the lea michelle edit and I can't look at it the same anymore

**throwaway-7650** (10): asking everyone who gave this 10s/11s to❤️PEGGED

**vayyiqra** (10): Every time I hear this I think "this is her most overrated song, it's good but not that amazing" but then I hear the strings and remember "yeah this rules" and also it's the easiest 10 ever. Would've been a good winner! Sad!

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.9): ended balladphobia but I wanted Reol or Romy, we could’ve rated this again in Pegged 🙄

**shipperondeck** (9.8): i cant listen to bjork anymore bc dancer in the dark ruined my mental health for months but this song is as amazing as i remember😁

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): anyone who zeroes this is an ungrateful grapefruit

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): what did her neighbours think of her causing a public disturbance every morning

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.1): At first I didn't really understand this song, then I got depressed and suddenly everything made sense

**1998tweety** (9): her one good song

**anothertown** (9): the Cappuccino To Go/Headed For the Hills Again → Back at my Cliff/Still Throwing Things Off pipeline

**slimboyfriend** (8.7): Britney should cover this

**jman457** (8.6): We just need to rate to Post

**seanderlust** (8.5): bjork's pro-littering era :pensive:

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a hyperpop ballad? she is not shooting for the popheads demographic I’ll tell you that much

**hikk** (8): fifth harmony could do hyperballad but bjork could not do miss movin on

**phonethephoenix** (8): the worst part is that I saw a Chris Fleming sketch about this song before ever listening to it. gr8 buildup

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): stop looking at this comment and vote for PEGGED

**thedoctordances1940** (8): No, Ma'am... they're saying boo-jörk

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): the production is very pretty, but i've never liked liked her voice.

**DirtyRat583** (7): which part is supposed to be the hyper part

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): I’m not a Post girlie, but like all Björk songs, this still is a good song. I wouldn’t defend it to the death though

**jsonphile** (7): Bjork is an artist I respect much more than I actually like because I just don’t kinda get her. But I do kinda vibe with this song

**timothy444** (7): For a song in the 90s, this sounds pretty modern and wouldn't feel out of place to hear on a modern alternative radio station like triple J for example. The production in particular still feels surprisingly fresh today

**WaneAllstarToc** (7): it's deeply strange how this is is one of the bjork cuts that I nod my head up and down to while going "yeah it's not rlly the one for me on post".

**IIIHenryIII** (6): most overrated underrated artist ever

**jasannn** (6): my volume rocker is getting a lot of work during this song

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): literally if anyone else sang this I would probably like it

**intheaftermath** (5): I don't think I'll ever get the hype for Bjork. I'm too basic for this. Too uninteresting. I feel bad for not liking this but I can't change myself I guess. Stream Gabriel Faure or something.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): it's no Miss Movin' On

**Awkward\_King** (3): please help me get bjork i really want to!!!!!!!

**daythreeinmiami** (3): I loved the ending but I’m one of those who don’t find Bjork’s voice good. Lol. Pls don’t ban me from the sub.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): not only is this boring it wasted my time

**NotWith10000Men** (3): yeah i don't get it

**ricki** (3): i went to see bjork live and i can say that her fans genuinely stink. the stench of sweat and whatever shit they were smoking is forever ingrained in my mind

**moonagenightmares** (2): i thought my earphones were broken

**Roxieloxie** (2): the way people came at me for my score of this song for MONTHS I thought i 0'ed it and maybe i just forgot, I gave it a 2 which i feel like people should've saw coming after my actual 0. I still dont enjoy this so im giving it the same score i gave it in ratemas sorry bjarbs

**cremeebrulee** (1): girl just leave him

**TragicKingdom1** (0): we need balladphobia to show UP for this

TiltControls: # Ratemas

---

**Overall Average**: 6.959 **// Average Controversy:** 2.538

---

TiltControls: The best word to describe ratemas is chaotic. I remember trying to do all the games, worried I wouldn’t get a spot to send my random flop fave (who needs to release an album soon btw) until the riddle round came up. Bit unfortunate I couldn’t do trivia after that, but everything looked like it was so much fun. Hope to see the same messiness from ratrick’s day.

**ImADudeDuh** (10.000): the games were kinda better than the rate itself

**akanewasright** (9.333): great rate, no notes

**Stryxen** (9.000): condragulations personal jesus

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.500): really fun rate honestly

**throwaway-7650** (8.000): literally nobody asked for camila and friends fawk you teakay

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.900): my first rate ever yay

**nt96** (7.667): This rate was pretty special to me and was instrumental in moving my way up the rate committee. At this point, I've only been on PH discord for a few months and was still new. When Ratemas came up and I decided to participate in their games and get to know the raters a little bit more. Miraculously, I won a game and got to submit Hyperballad, and was so happy that it got 4th place! In addition, this was the first time I got to show off some banners that I made for fun, which Roxie liked so much, she decided to use them for the bonus, and the rest is history! All in all, it felt like one of those rare moments where pretty much everything goes the way you wanted to and everything turns out fine. This rate was a lot of fun and I made lots of friends along the way. Here's to hoping we'll have a Ratemas 2 in the future!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.667): still maybe the most iconic rate ever?

**bogo** (7.667): never forget what they did to personal jesus

**bulforster** (7.600): Coming up with my comments for this rate while sick with covid over the holidays last year was the most I've ever used my undergrad degree.

**vayyiqra** (7.333): What fun times Ratemas was! One of the few rates where it felt like the Discourse around it was truly just everyone goofing around and being silly rather than toxic and catty.

**Roxieloxie** (7.333): The first meta rate I hosted and oh boy! Ratemas in general was really fun but the rate element was so chaotic, Trying to pull off an entire rate in a little over 2 weeks was one of the most stressful things i'd ever done, thank god for yetti honestly cause I could not have done it without her

**DirtyRat583** (7.000): damn santa gave out coal for ratemas

**plastichaxan** (7.000): Thinking about how this rate almost made me quit rates jdksfdsk

**cremeebrulee** (7.000): every part of this rate was terrifying to witness, i genuinely don’t blame roxie and yetti for blacking this out at all

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.000): Dover Beach is a bad song

**sarcasticsobs** (6.667): Happy to have missed this rate to have missed hearing Camila Cabello for a period of time, but knock on enough doors and sure enough eventually the devil will answer

**jman457** (6.600): I really liked this, but out of all the rates this had the most highway robberies

**just\_thonking** (6.333): Dover Beach did not deserve to be the villain of this rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.233): Justice for the gay cowboys

**WaneAllstarToc** (6.133): this seemed like a weird lore excursion that a bunch of y'all never recovered from

**IIIHenryIII** (5.333): these kind of rates are so messy, I love them

**TiltControls** (8.2): rip Sisqo being the highest rated artist of all time without song limits since he was only ever on this song last time we rated it. (I imagine rating Thong Song would’ve brought it down similarly)

---

**akanewasright** (10): literally the best song I’ve ever heard, I wanted to switch my 11 to this briefly

**anothertown** (10): every word out of nicki's mouth about this woman was to distract from the fact that nicki could never execute the "i know youre all pulling on your worm to me" concept as well as this.

**cremeebrulee** (10): why is this song here it literally won……..

**CrimsonROSET** (10): 364

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): ugh she LITERALLY served cunt

**IIIHenryIII** (10): a lot

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i own this song on cd now

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): forever one of thee rap songs…

**ricki** (10): i know covers arent really a thing in the rap world but i would pay to see megan thee stallion’s rendition of this song

**runaway3212** (10): the censored version of this is just the beat with lil kim making censoring noises over it

**seanderlust** (10): a masterclass in lyricism. this song was filthy by current standards, let alone the mid-2000s. that immaculate production and sisqo on the chorus? banger.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): shout out to Tony the Italian

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this song is forever associated with Perfume for me also usually not a big fan of moans in songs but this goes too hard

**throwaway-7650** (10): this should've been in winners 3 tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): honestly I entirely forgot this came 2nd??? I thought it was a day 2 cut for some reason

**Awkward\_King** (9): im still so glad this rate happened like :soblove: banger of a song too!!!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): what if meghan trainor performed this

**shipperondeck** (9): iconic honestly

**WaneAllstarToc** (9): edible?!?!?! sign me up!!!!

**1998tweety** (8.5): ate

**intheaftermath** (8.5): go italians wooooo

**Memezaharamole** (8.5): great verses, wish the hook had the same bite

**Stryxen** (8.4): ECLECTIC 💜

**impla77** (8.2): We love seperate storylines

**jman457** (8.2): Cupcakke would go off on a remix

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Oh I know that owl is throwing ass to this.

**Frajer** (8): making a commercial jingle into a horny bop is such a slay

**frogaranaman** (8): I like how the censored version does nothing to change the horniness of this

**plastichaxan** (8): The first verse being about how she’s fucked different races, one of them being italian, peak lyricism if you ask me

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Love Sisqo going hard on the adlibs here

**qazz23** (8): i don't know, i'm not good at math

**Roxieloxie** (8): Italian being one of the races

**vayyiqra** (8): "used to be a deacon" very funny line

**camerinian** (7.5): Sisqo really is down catastrophic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i thought she said "get your vaccine" and was gonna be like omg so true healthy queen but it turns out she just said vaseline and thats considerably less funny

**bogo** (7): there's a few elements to this song i do not really care for, particularly the weird moaning in the second verse, but i like it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): going to be honest hear I almost never listen to this song all the way oop

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The Original WAP.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this makes WAP look like a kids song

**imbaby122** (7): i like the implication that italians are a distinct race of white people.

**phonethephoenix** (7): 🍭🍭

**Uberpigeon** (7): we need more girl rapping and guy singing the hook

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Great hook, but the rest of the song is just fine.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.5): The second verse sounds like the beginning of a really kinky gay porn

**NotWith10000Men** (6.3): i don't even like this song that much but it's so much better than the 6 before

**Around-town** (6): This would score higher if I could play it aloud with my parents in the room.

**bigbigbee** (6): I think that the cartoon owl answered this question for you Kim, it’s a-one, a-two, a-three, then you bite it

**Nagisoid** (6): CUM IN HIS MOUTH??? The beat and the hook are cool but I do not care for the verses at all SORRY.

**timothy444** (6): Better than a typical Cardi B and Nicki Minaj song

**sarcasticsobs** (4): I know what they're goin' for but this kind of song topic is something I personally can't handle. Beat and performance are good, though

**MassiveThief** (3): I need songs to stop with the moaning. Please.

**nt96** (7.500): I would’ve loved it if Hustling made it in tbh. Nevertheless, this rate was a BOP and these girls were overdue for a rate!

**fadedblue09** (7.500): Enjoyed this rate but I wish I gave myself more time scoring these songs. In hindsight I should have given my 11 to Eve (and I may have overrated Trina oop)

**Roxieloxie** (7.500): horny

**DirtyRat583** (6.750): the MCs may be legendary but the music isnt ill tell you that much

**flava** (10): true

**TiltControls** (9.2): For a little while it looked like both Y2UK picks were ready to take over the top 10. Sadly, as the rate went on both ended up dropping quite a bit. Though GA managed to rebound back into a day 3 finish due to the close scores.

---

**oscarbrierley1** (11): talk about starting your career with a bang.

**akanewasright** (10): YASSSSS!!!! SHAKE SOME ASS!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Scientifically how does the beat of a drum go round and round?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is what alexis michelle performs for subway dads

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): fads aloud

**DirtyRat583** (10): this was almost my 11 but a certain somebody stole it from the girls but like it was really hard just imagine the 10 next to this comment is an 11

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): literally timeless, thiis still sounds so modern 20 years later

**jman457** (10): ok Quintin Tarintino

**plastichaxan** (10): I need one of those fancams with like the emo ravers and the bad cgi dogs dancing type of videos set to this song

**qazz23** (10): off to a great start - this genre combination is very good! The mix of dance pop, surf rock guitar, and drum & bass just work well together

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is literally the birth of music

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Spy movie soundtrack-ass sounding song (complimentary)

**Stryxen** (10): the first song ever

**throwaway-7650** (10): taylor trying to market folkmore:

**vayyiqra** (10): rules

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): better than mezzanine, like a good math equation. First you start by making a boyband and girl group. second you make sure that you manufacture a song just in time for christmas 2k2. So, you start cranking the bass and make the rock elements a seasoning, NOT the main attraction. then just layer those voices and put down a tempo of 163 beats per minute--uk hardcore continuum beat stuff. All together, this shit sorta just vibes itself out and quickly makes you go awooga. monster good time that prolly set us on a pop path forward.

**welcome2thejam** (10): I'd be so damn mad if I was in the boy band that had to compete against this song

**1998tweety** (9.5): me waiting for the train

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): girl the underground does NOT sound like this be fr

**intheaftermath** (9.5): it's not Call the Shots but it's pretty damn close

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I will say Miss-teeq had the most consistently good discography, but girls aloud had the best song in this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): biology is still better sorry darj !

**bigbigbee** (9): singing this to myself when the local subway breaks down for the 5th time in two months due to chronic underfunding and we have to walk through the tunnels to get out

**phonethephoenix** (9): this was cool!

**Uberpigeon** (9): this is ipr

**nt96** (8.5): James Bond's got a secret playlist called "My Delicious Ass Quaking Delights" consisting of this song 30 times.

**pig-serpent** (8.5): Is it the sound of the underground or the sound of the radio? Are all the hoes out partying college radio? Are you still having these college radio dance parties? Can I be invited?

**bogo** (8): another song that slightly grew off me after rating it

**frogaranaman** (8): this is so London metro system of them

**IIIHenryIII** (8): younger me would’ve vibed hard with this

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i love indie music

**Nagisoid** (8): That surf guitar and backing DnB track, God... I do not care much about the vocals but the instrumental alone elevates this song to another level.

**runaway3212** (8): a whole bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.6): Surfs up dudes

**imbaby122** (7.5): i don’t think i’m british enough to appreciate this.

**jsonphile** (7.5): I don’t remember this song on the hadestown soundtrack

**impla77** (7.2): Anyone who has ever been on the Underground can tell you that this is false advertising

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this vocals are so bland for the production

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this could be a 10 if they kept that kind of darkly sexy~ instrumental from the verses for the chorus too

**camerinian** (6): freestyler, rock a microphone

**heysoupie** (6): I have played this song too many times

**ricki** (6): hoot by snsd

**Roxieloxie** (6): I fully believe there is a sonic amv set to this somewhere

**timothy444** (6): Decent but forgettable

**shipperondeck** (5.5): the guitar is cool but i literally cant hear them underneath lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): so glad I don’t have to take the train

**daythreeinmiami** (1): I deleted this song from my memory for a reason. I did not want to be reminded of its existence.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.000): so many guilty pleasures in this rate

**sarcasticsobs** (8.750): Reminder: Rate winners Mis-Teeq

**nt96** (7.750): This rate was easily amongst my favorites. A few songs here I grew up with. Mis-Teeq being rated was a dream come true and seeing them dominate and win with their signature song Scandalous was very cathartic considering how underrated it is.

**fadedblue09** (7.750): I guess I could resonate with certain European music genres (do people consider the UK as Europe? Idk)

**ImADudeDuh** (7.750): Biology was ROBBED OMFGGG

**TiltControls** (9.5): For most of the rate this was actually flopping hard (which would’ve been hilarious tbh). My thoughts flip-flop on the song often; sometimes its a poorly done proof of concept of a solid song and sometimes it’s got such a good base that it doesn’t really matter. (Still would’ve been funny to see it go day 1)

---

**sarcasticsobs** (11): ~Enchanting~, c’est magnifique. Ring that gong, baybeeee!

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**bluehxrizon** (10): mothered severely

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I was one of the “ugh why the Jubilee love” indieheads in 2021 but the album has grown on me a lot. This has turned into one of my favorites. Once I read a write-up on indieheads about Michelle’s pretty idiosyncratic use of overly-verbose words tumbling over her, I’ve been more drawn to songs like Paprika and how well it captures a dizzying feeling. And tbh it’s nice little update to that 2000’s Beulah sound

**fadedblue09** (10): Seeing the Wolf Alice stans lose their minds after this got picked because they couldn't build a proper consensus was so funny

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): and when i say this is better than Be Sweet

**IIIHenryIII** (10): sounds like a parade (complimentary)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): so nice

**imbaby122** (10): almost 2 years since this song dropped and i’m still wondering HOW’S IT FEEL TO BE AT THE CENTER OF MAGIC TO LINGER IN TONES AND WORDS? HOW’S IT FEEL TO STAND AT THE HEIGHT OF YOUR POWERS TO CAPTIVATE EVERY HEART? PROJECTING YOUR VISIONS TO STRANGERS WHO FEEL IT, WHO LISTEN, WHO LINGER ON EVERY WORD? bc i will never feel that and i want to feel it oh so badly.

**impla77** (10): some will linger on every word.. but many popheads don’t even pay attention to the lyrics!!

**jman457** (10): This should have won over Be sweet, Indieheads got that right.

**nt96** (10): this feels like breaking out of a cage, climbing atop of a mountain and screaming your problems out

**phonethephoenix** (10): something very satisfying about this song

**plastichaxan** (10): Best. Song. Ever. I have 11d this song countless times and would do it again but I’ll have enough with the pain it’ll cause me to see this be overrated and robbed

**Stryxen** (10): MICHELLE ZAUNER I LOVE YOU

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): mr salt and mrs pepper when they needed to name their child

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I'm scared of people being spiteful towards this because they wrongly believe wolf alice should be here instead

**vayyiqra** (10): Deep sigh yeah I've said about 5 times in rates of various kinds that this song's overrated but I'm still going to give a 10 without thinking. (Be Sweet deserved that win argue with the wall)

**welcome2thejam** (10): I can't open my spice cabinet anymore without wanting to bang a gong

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.9): where is wolf alice

**jasannn** (9.5): optimism in a song

**seanderlust** (9.5): i am going to defer to my past comment on this because i still think it's true: the instrumental here feels like the soundtrack for a parade in a Studio Ghibli movie - orchestral and whimsical and sweeping.

**anothertown** (9): PogChamp GONG PogChamp

**Frajer** (9): bang that gong Michelle

**shipperondeck** (9): singing and spinning around i love this song sm

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): I'd give the rave.dj with can we dance a 10

**bogo** (8): there were so many great options from this rate that this getting voted in was kinda disappointing but like i'm not gonna act like it's not a great song

**frogaranaman** (8): this song is literally just words

**heysoupie** (8): i like this song but the vocals are really unappealing to me

**just\_thonking** (8): I just want you to be haaaaappyy :(

**Nagisoid** (8): I love that Satoshi Kon movie! Very cute, it reminds me of The Moon by The Microphones. Her voice is very soothing, and the lyrics are earwormy.

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.8): A little too bombastic Beirut for my liking on the instrumental. Yet lyrically Im clanking away with half moon eyes. it bops around she gets bonus points for when she would dress for success and smash that gong on stage from videos I saw.

**runaway3212** (7.6): I dislike this album but this hit for me recently

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): was gonna share a story about paprika but I realized it was kinda boring so I’ll hold my tongue

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I think I've given every Jbrekkie song I've rated a 7.5. The definition of making good songs that don't grab me by the throat.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.4): If Michelle was a main pop girl and sang like that we would all be making fun of her the same way we make fun of Camila, don't lie to yourself

**daythreeinmiami** (7): This is a vibe. I also just really dig the brass section of this song and her vocal delivery. It’s quirky.

**Memezaharamole** (6): prefer a fuzzy JB tbh, 'Sounds From Another Planet' was more my vibe

**qazz23** (6): I like the horns, though it's a bit too polished

**timothy444** (5.5): Decent but forgettable; bordering on mid

**akanewasright** (5): I’ve never gotten this song and I’m honestly pissed this got in

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Where. Is. Wolf. Alice.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this is one of the three good songs in that album but like did we need her

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): kind of misdirecting my dislike for this album to this specific song when i actually like it but like why is it here its not that good

**oscarbrierley1** (4): i liked this in the original rate??? i cant work out why now, her voice sounds like nails on a chalk board.

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): need to time travel back to when i did the writeup for the album and explicitly call this the worst song on the album

**MassiveThief** (3): everything about this album remains overrated to me

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): this song feels so…cluttered?? and her vocals are not great

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): wolf alice was literally RIGHT fucking there....

**RandomHypnotica** (1): how many times do I have to teach you this lesson old man

**just\_thonking** (7.833): Some of the whackest rate results in recent memory

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.667): A rate I didn’t do cuz I was not keen on any of the albums at the time. I now like Jubilee and Home Video way more now. The results would have remained the some lol

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.233): y'all sure you don't wanna do a boygenius rate? lord fucking knows that indieheads could explode if we did it. anyways 2021 banner year for really presenting a truth that's sorta been made apparent over the last decade: tier 1 indie (especially for women acts) can turn you into a 3rd or 4th or even 5th string possible pop celeb. is any of this music good? yeah it's all pretty good. but is it worth stanning over? i spend $80 on electronic cassettes I have my vices and fandoms

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.500): JUSTICE FOR WOLF ALICE!!!

**cremeebrulee** (6.033): very thankful for this rate for kicking off my wolf alice stan era, they are becoming one of my fave artists ever <3 the rest of these women exist too ig

**DirtyRat583** (5.667): indie ☹️

**TiltControls** (4): Jack Harlow must pay for his crimes

---

**frogaranaman** (11): /u/RoxieLoxie sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (11): my favorite song that came out in 2021 probably

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this song feels like it was crafted in a lab to cater to my tastes

**akanewasright** (10): this is the one time I’ve heard Jack Harlow turn in a good verse I was SHOCKED

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What a moment. Changed marching bands forever.

**bogo** (10): no matter how bad jack's recent stuff has been at least we'll always have this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): remember Jack Harlow

**DirtyRat583** (10): cmbyn was an iconic comeback but this ate that up a million times over. this production is impeccable

**ImADudeDuh** (10): gay x extremely straight solidarity

**impla77** (10): Hes SERVING time

**intheaftermath** (10): Somehow Lil Nas X's music, personality, and fashion are all equally as incredible. He really is an icon in the making

**jsonphile** (10): absolute banger. From the first moment I heard those horns, I knew this was going to be great and that Lil Nas X was in fact here to stay. Oh and remember when people liked Jack Harlow?

**plastichaxan** (10): Lil Nas X I am free everyday please

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the way this song makes jack harlow's rate average increase exponentially

**Roxieloxie** (10): would be an 11 but i need to take points off for jack harlow :/ . Btw if you get a chance please see lnx live he's so fucking god

**seanderlust** (10): jack harlow gets exactly one valid verse and it's this one

**Stryxen** (10): I AINT LOST SINCE I BEEN GAY YUH

**thedoctordances1940** (10): yeah still slaps and even jack harlow was good

**throwaway-7650** (10): IB > M (CMBYN) saur true

**timothy444** (10): Shoulda won the rate over Billie Eilish because this just slaps massively hard and is a guaranteed party banger no matter your sexuality. From the brass to Jack Harlow's verse, everything works perfectly!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The most depressing rate experience for me, giving this an 11 knowing it would all be hopeless against the Happier Than Ever juggernaut

**welcome2thejam** (10): The Jack Harlow is good actually? era sure lasted one song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.8): .1 removed for jack harlow being here, and another .1 removed because the hosts shouldve sent montero title track instead

**imbaby122** (9.5): i miss when i could listen to this song without knowing about jack harlow or his sweet semen :(

**pig-serpent** (9.5): Remember when this dropped and we all though Jack Harlow was about to drop some of the best pop rap songs of all time because of how incredible his verse is, then we got First Class?

**shipperondeck** (9.5): half point deducted for jack harlow's exponentially increased popularity due to this song

**Memezaharamole** (9.2): love that half grunt voice he does for the "need to get this album done uh" same verse he mentions Nicki, I hope that if they do meet or work together, it isn't a case of "never meet your heroes"... I love this guy

**NotWith10000Men** (9.1): finally some good fucking food

**camerinian** (9): more 👏👏👏👏👏, less 🍍🧃 🍆💦

**moonagenightmares** (9): removed a point for the heterosexual line

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): The sped-up version that all the meme videos use goes so hard idc idc idc

**vayyiqra** (9): 🎺🎺🎺🎺

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): lnx pulling an avatar roku and just vanishing when the world needed him most (jack is also mia but that's fine)

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): theyre knocking on my door apparently they have an arrest warrant they're saying its for liking jack harlow guys help m-

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): oh wow jack harlow can be good

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): call me by your name is better but this is still great

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): still don't know how I feel about the Harlow verse after all this time

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i’m happy that i was proven right in history into thinking jack harlow was never that good

**dreamingpastel** (8): May this be what everyone remembers Jack Harlow for

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.9): everyday i wake up from a nightmare where i am informed that jack harlow is in fact, a white rapper. i then proceed to log on to twitter dot com and take a big swig of my covfefe...and wow wouldn't you believe it! the nightmare IS reality :o

**jman457** (7.6): this is for the trumpets and not Jack Harlow

**babadork** (7.5): I feel like Lil Nas X isn’t really known for his flow, but that first verse is great. Jack Harlow should not be bragging about being better looking than he was in high school. That should just be assumed.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): jack harlow your verse sucks

**ricki** (7): jack harlow’s verse gets worse by the listen it’s actually insane

**runaway3212** (7): this grew off me but we still stan the shower scene

**anothertown** (6): i am shocked that the horns in this song are real

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): doing fine without this song in my life

**IIIHenryIII** (5): it aged like milk

**MassiveThief** (5): god this song got so old SO quickly

**Nagisoid** (5): I KNOW THIS IS A CURSED SCORE BUT THIS SONG WAS RUINED BY MY HIGH SCHOOL BAND.

**heysoupie** (4.8): something about the chorus/lil Nas X’s voice and associated autotune or whatever is going on with it annoys me & i do not look forward to this song being sports entrance music forever

**1998tweety** (4): bops a bit, would be better without some of Jack's lines (the weird line about cheating and objectification was a bit odd) but besides that it bops.

**oscarbrierley1** (4): i've never really liked this song and its only got worse with age. i hate to say it, but jack harlow is the best part.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): How dare you make me listen to a full Jack Harlow verse, I've gone so long avoiding this day. Destroys an absolutely fine song. I feel absolutely sick to my stomach and I'm legitimately angry at myself, I didn't have to do this rate

**daythreeinmiami** (3.2): I just think this is kind of boring? I also hate Jack Harlow’s flow and I really just don’t need the imagery of him slapping someone’s ass nor the sound. No thank you.

**TiltControls** (10): I gave this a 10 but I also wanted the chaotic universe where this left day 1. The drop on those first 6 ballots could’ve been set to Disclosure - My High falling video

---

**heysoupie** (11): pop perfection

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): "happy and healthy!" meanwhile it seems he's currently being detwinkified by a conversion therapy church

**1998tweety** (10): he is mostly definitely not doing good rn 💀 but the song still bops

**babadork** (10): That therapist line is “You Oughta Know” level.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): ……………..this is better than Misery Business.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): As a millennial, this song just slams me into 2006 and I love that for me.

**dreamingpastel** (10): NGL, I was a little skeptical about Olivia when drivers license was blowing up, but she won me over with this.

**frogaranaman** (10): she’s literally so fucking real for this one

**IIIHenryIII** (10): more like good 10 u

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen of single-handedly bringing back a dead genre, ugh your fave could never have as much impact

**impla77** (10): You just need to lean in to the angst and it works!

**jasannn** (10): I would’ve been so annoying if this released when I was a teenager.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): "you look happy and healthy / not me if you ever cared to ask" is so petty lmao

**plastichaxan** (10): I don’t care who she copied she ate that

**RandomHypnotica** (10): now that this didn't even come close to winning I can admit it's a banger

**ricki** (10): you’re not responsible for the horrible wave of pop punk we got… i hope you know it

**Roxieloxie** (10): pop rock olivia is by far my favorite version of her

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): The worst thing that ever happened to her was her boyfriend leaving her for a blonde and that's why I love her

**throwaway-7650** (10): don't have to give g4u a 9.9 this time! no deja vu!

**timothy444** (10): Throwback to the time that Australian radio refused to play her until two weeks after she hit #1 with driver's license. IIRC, they didn't even play this song until a week after this hit #1 as well which says a lot about the Australian music industry as of recent. Anyways, my favourite pop song that isn't hard enough to be pop punk but still rockin'. 2021 really was a great year in pop rock music.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I'd like to personally apologize to all of popheads for wishing 2022 to bring more pop punk songs, I should have been more specific and asked for more good pop punk songs

**MagiKiwi29** (9.6): an absolute hit in the karaoke

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): guessing that most will have SOURed on this one due to the influx of wannabes she inspired but it’s still a tight song that I think might be her legacy at this point

**bogo** (9): deja vu and drivers license are better but this is still really good

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is gonna do so much worse than it originally did but it really doesn’t deserve to

**Frajer** (9): I love how she's not afraid to be a little messy

**jsonphile** (9): there was a time when I got tired of hearing this song, but after some time from its popularity I enjoy this song again it still goes hard

**pig-serpent** (9): I loved reliably hearing a pop punk song on the radio at work consistently, but removed from its moment the song is fairly basic and doesn't entirely hold up to the pantheon of the genre.

**qazz23** (9): catchy pop-punk but it does have similarities w/ misery business

**runaway3212** (9): I too wish my ex was eternally hung up on me

**sarcasticsobs** (9): This is the good type of bratty teenager stuff

**seanderlust** (9): i can't help but not bop. it's just so juvenile and bratty and fun.

**welcome2thejam** (9): I hate this song for getting my hopes up for a year before I lost my life savings in the Mainstream Pop Punk Stock Crash of 2022

**camerinian** (8.5): why did hearing this while waiting in line at the bank a week ago make me feel so weird

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Filipina pop rock excellence

**imbaby122** (8.3): the discourse around this song (copying paramore, ableism, joshua basset, etc.) took a couple weeks off my life span. and i wasn’t even invested in it, it was like second-hand smoke.

**Awkward\_King** (8): a great song that does exactly what it needs to do!!

**intheaftermath** (8): jealously, jealousy is better

**musical\_pyn** (8): there are very few pop singers right now that emote the way olivia does so she'll always be in my good graces for that

**phonethephoenix** (8): part of me is surprised every time she swears bc i used to only listen to this on the radio

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): good (4*2) u

**vayyiqra** (8): I'm not making the comment. Everyone else will.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Hilary Duff would have devoured this

**shipperondeck** (7.5): she needs to release new music soon

**ignitethephoenix** (7): honestly so overrated, her vocals are not great here and it was just overplayed

**jman457** (7): there is something inside me that wont forgive her for forging in the cash grab 2000’s pop punk revival.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): jealousy jealousy >>>

**Nagisoid** (7): Don't worry Olive Oil, GAYLE wasn't your fault. Unironically it seems like the pop punk revival that's going on peaked here, which is sad.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): this grew off me quite a bit since its release unfortunately but still good

**WaneAllstarToc** (7): "olivia rodrigo is a lowercase girl with ALL CAPS FEELINGS" anyways this one is still funny she's trailblazing in making tasteful 7/10 pop punk. machine gun kelly...take notes; when megan leaves yr ass u friggin better have a good 4 u on standby

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6.5): I think a lot of Olivia’s music just hasn’t aged very well for me

**shhhneak** (6.2): The way the collective unconscious decided this was the best song to exist when it came out.

**bluehxrizon** (6): stream her new album "This Is Why"

**DirtyRat583** (6): thank god this is the SOUR song in here. i can tolerate this

**03O9** (5): even she was BORED tf out

**akanewasright** (5): listen I had an anxiety attack on a treadmill to this song, its good but I’m tired of it

**Memezaharamole** (5): always felt the verses and chorus had an energy disconnect, I do rate the bridge though

**cremeebrulee** (4): brutal is the way better pop-punk sour song since it has some of the lyrical bite this lacks imo

**thedoctordances1940** (4): I don't know why but this has grown off me so much

**moonagenightmares** (3.5): this mediocre album being so overhyped was a psyop lmao

**anothertown** (3): this has like 12 different songs in it and sounds like a puzzle that needs to be put back together. the last 5 seconds with those staccato chords should have been the beginning of the song and the foundation of it basically! and then i go look at the album and that ending leads into a soft acoustic song?! what are we doing at our major labels today.

**Stryxen** (2): happy for the children that live for this but it's frustrating how little she pushes herself on this when I KNOW she has slain and WILL slay. but this is. very. Disney channel.

**MassiveThief** (1): man this rate was the king of overplay. I don't remember the last time I heard this song in full, I have an auto-response to skip as soon as I hear the opening bass

**TiltControls** (6.5): honestly if I were to send my scores a month later it’d probably be a 3. This grew off me so much and I don’t know why ~~i do know why, it was cause it kept overperforming~~

---

**lexiaredery** (11): Incredible

**MassiveThief** (11): in my top 5 most listened songs ever lol. the magic between these two is unstoppable

**03O9** (10): CRJ and Charli on the same track was this really ever not gonna be a 10

**1998tweety** (10): me when the whole family would ride in the fan

**akanewasright** (10): :sobsing:

**bogo** (10): most slay collab in existence maybe

**cremeebrulee** (10): no they get it bc i rly am all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone all alone

**imbaby122** (10): CARLY RAE MY BELOVED.

**jman457** (10): I mean look at the material

**just\_thonking** (10): They were really at their peak power with this one

**phonethephoenix** (10): I listened to this song a ton even when I thought it didn't exemplify what I liked best about either of their works. immaculate vibes!

**pig-serpent** (10): I wish that explosion at the end lasted for longer than 10 seconds. This song was the reason I kept coming back to Pop 2 and eventually having it grow on me into my top 50 albums of all time.

**plastichaxan** (10): If both of them together couldn’t win a rate there is no hope for popheads

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the 2 sub favs coming together for a song and flopping is kinda hilarious

**runaway3212** (10): somehow also winner energy the actual winner of this rate is so confusing when you think about it

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): in the back seat!

**throwaway-7650** (10): tears' crown slipped a bit

**vayyiqra** (10): something idk nothing insightful here but being sprawled in the backseat of a car at night driving through a city looking up at the lights seems like such a vibe tho

**Frajer** (9.5): our multiverse of madness

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): and we are (back)seated!

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.5): *** guy who's only heard billions by caroline polachek voice*** hey is anyone getting big caroline polachek vibes here? what's up with music?!

**bluehxrizon** (9): insane outro

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I’m raising my score because even though I always feel disappointed when listening to this song, I need to recognize it’s still a bop and I’m just angry due to the expectations I had for their collab

**Stryxen** (9): score raises higher the longer this goes on every time. Forget how much I love this when I'm not listening to it

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): Look, it's not on my top-tier for two of my top-tier pop artists, but it's still nice. Or maybe it's (Cyber) Stockholm Syndrome (he he he). That percolating synth that comes in at 0:47 and 1:52 is a real "that hits the spot" touch, same with the percussion that starts at ~1:04-1:05 and 2:08. A. G. Cook and EASYFUN knew what they were doing. Or when the chords really kick in at 2:24 and the arpeggiated bridge synths at 2:41. Did I really timestamp every specific production choice I liked as I went through this record? Only time will tell. Anyway, I forgot about the warbling bleeps and bloops at that kick in at 3:17 to lead the song into it's minor-cacophony-of-sound-ending, gotta love that, let's bump up this song's score a bit just for that.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): do indieheads hyperpop rate (opens may 1st)

**bigbigbee** (8): that is where I keep my forgotten candy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): carly rae jepsen if you’re reading this i am free on thursday night. if you would like to hang out i am free on thursday night when i am free to hang out. i am free to hang out on thursday night so

**timothy444** (8): Not gonna lie, it's a good song with some pretty cool production dispersed throughout the song but the lyrics are very repetitive at times to the point where I can make a low-effort meme and post a picture of that chalk-holder as my comment. Except I'm not going to because that's already been done already like 10 times on r/popheadscirclejerk

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Aww, I remember the Pop Emergency this was when this collab happened. 2017 Popheads was such a simpler time.

**Nagisoid** (7): This song is kinda on the backseat on the album, no offense. Carly clears Charli hard on here, but the chorus beat still brings me back to this track even if there's not a lot more to see here.

**qazz23** (7): the outro is really good, kinda repetitive otherwise

**ricki** (7): i thought of raising my score but i had a nightmare that this won by only 1 point so it’s going to be stuck with this 7 now

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.9): You all make me listen to songs that sound exactly like this over and over and I'm TIRED

**intheaftermath** (6.7): oh so this is why you all say it's charli baby

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): this one actually isn’t bad

**NotWith10000Men** (3.1): the carly parts are okay but the rest is like a brick wall

**ImADudeDuh** (3): popheads CAME at this collaboration

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): both of you are better than this

**Awkward\_King** (0): im not even a carly hater but you wouldn't think that based off my rate history

**flava** (11): true

**TiltControls** (9): I was a little surprised that this wasn’t the top MAHH track again, but I guess that’s All Stars for you. Still having the whole rate intact this long is no small feat, and a day 3 finish is much stronger than some previous All Stars may have given it.

---

**welcome2thejam** (11): Just an unbelievable track. Think my 11 here came down to which song would make me most irate if it left day one, and well, hope this doesn't get robbed

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Amazing song and also what a cool music video! And of course rest in peace to Gangsta Boo.

**bogo** (10): hate how much this still hits

**camerinian** (10): Gangsta Boo you will live forever

**CrimsonROSET** (10): did you expect it to be hot??

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): RIP Gangsta Boo

**fadedblue09** (10): should have given this my 11 in my rate

**frogaranaman** (10): fucking hell

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): dark horse winner?

**IIIHenryIII** (10): fuck, another 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i should probably come back to this album because i remember i was surprised by it

**impla77** (10): Rest in peace queen❤️

**Memezaharamole** (10): R.I.P Gangsta Boo, highlight of RTJ4 for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): 11 contender fr

**plastichaxan** (10): I tried to make a joke about the open and closin hole line but this is too powerful for that

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): yeah.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): yeah okay but what if this was in Spanish?

**throwaway-7650** (10): gotta stream RTJ4, RIP gangsta boo

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): weirdest christmas song ever

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): rtj lyrics are always incredible

**pig-serpent** (9.5): All I really want from hip hop is a beat that grows and develops as the song and its story progress, and a steady series of rhythmic flows with nice pops of technicallity. Walking in the Snow has a very strong execution of both of these.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): climate change be like:

**timothy444** (9.5): Not fun rap but still this is fire rap

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): LFG

**DirtyRat583** (9): rtj4 an amazing album i need to relisten to

**imbaby122** (9): oh damn

**intheaftermath** (9): this might be the stupidest thing I've ever said in a rate but i had NO idea that Run The Jewels was hip hop. I'd just assumed they were like... indie rock or something? it was a hip hop jumpscare but it was a great song so it was worth the momentary confusion

**runaway3212** (9): RTJ the coolest people on earth

**WaneAllstarToc** (9): wait is this the one with the gang of four sample? oh wait it's not but that's still okay.

**03O9** (8.5): production bangs

**shhhneak** (8.3): www.inclusivecanada.org/post/starlight-tours

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): obsessed with this playing after the one direction riverdance song

**Nagisoid** (8): Arigato? they're in their Avril Lavigne era. Jokes aside, the lyrics are really good and important, the hook is catchy, and their deliveries are solid.

**qazz23** (8): i like the guest vocals, good flow overall

**Stryxen** (7.9): this album in general grew off me but this song is still great

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): Well they didn't say any lies

**jman457** (7.3): This album was everywhere after george floyd, but immediately fell out of the public consciousness ;it was so weird.

**1998tweety** (7): ate a bit

**vayyiqra** (7): Wrote a comment like "I don't like this it's making me anxious" but then listened more and that was the point so good work guys

**NotWith10000Men** (6): don't really like his flow

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.8): RIP Gangsta Boo <3

**Birdseeding** (3): God this tongue-twister backpacker bullshit is annoying. Plus one for Killer Mike

**cremeebrulee** (3): important subject matter yeah, but i fear as a song i do not care for it

**Roxieloxie** (3): I hate seeing redditors happy

**daythreeinmiami** (0): This production hurts my soul. This is Anthony Fantano ‘Too Many Slices™’

**TiltControls** (8.7): The glow-up between this here and in Alt R&B compared to its sub 7 score in the 2012 Billboard rate only shows how far we’ve come since the days of 0.1s and bonus 11s.

---

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (11): perfect

**akanewasright** (10): YASSS

**bogo** (10): i'd let miguel accidentally fall on me

**CrimsonROSET** (10): love a song that just kicks you in the face

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This song is literal crack.

**fadedblue09** (10): should have won

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ITS THE FUCKING SMASHA

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): just a great song

**Roxieloxie** (10): I lied earlier when i said that klk was my only 11 that made it in I forgot i had this too. I remember !nping this predicited it would be a future 3rd place songeniality bait song and itll probably do worse but we'll see

**sarcasticsobs** (10): The bass is Doing Something to my brain, good lord. Love his little "wah's!"

**Stryxen** (10): a serve

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): As a big fan of noted Wife Guy Miguel, I am still floored by that time he kicked two women performing this ditty and then just vibed it off; based cringe moment. they later sued him for damages. perf ditty

**welcome2thejam** (10): This song's too damn smooth! Somebody stop him!

**phonethephoenix** (9.9): ohhhh niceee

**babadork** (9.2): This is my dog’s 11. I don’t see this winning, but she’s gotten it right more times than I have.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.2): Look at Mr. Sexy over here

**1998tweety** (9): sex BOP

**anothertown** (9): this had the hugest hold on me in 2012 like i feel like i was just a step away from becoming an early days weekndator

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this dude is so underappreciated (not me being a hypocrite since it’s been a while I’ve listened to one of his songs)

**imbaby122** (8.8): that was so hot and sexy

**shipperondeck** (8.7): i underrated this last time so i'm making up for it now

**frogaranaman** (8): the Miguel renaissance is upon us

**jsonphile** (8): suddenly my clothes are off

**Nagisoid** (8): These Wario grunts took me out. The beat is really cool, but this song does not really catch my attention at all, except in parts.

**plastichaxan** (8): One more rate where all I can think of commenting about Miguel is not…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the best/worst part about all stars rates is that you can beat up yourself from 5 months ago for not giving this song a good score in its original rate

**throwaway-7650** (8): I get sending this but use me/don't look back deserved too

**vayyiqra** (8): rock on miguel

**jman457** (7.7): a sweet song

**seanderlust** (7.5): i love miguel's vocal performance on this one

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Sure Thing has always been the superior Miguel hit so I'm glad it got the TikTok payola xo

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): My opinion on this one hasn’t really changed since its rate. It’s sounds really nice but doesn’t stick with me too much. There were better songs on the album.

**camerinian** (7): in the "perfectly good song that I get why people love and yet I'm totally baffled why it was a hit" category

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is overhyped, “How Many Drinks” is better

**timothy444** (5.5): wanted to like this more but ended up just being a bit too boring for me

**moonagenightmares** (5): dont look back outslayed

**thedoctordances1940** (4): yeah I'm sorry I do not get it and also i'm sad the weeknd didn't get a song voted in but mainly I just do not find this very interesting

**TiltControls** (7.7): I think this was a fine All Stars choice. I would’ve preferred Brandy or Kelis but I don’t think I would’ve rated Rock the Boat all that much higher than this. Plus almost getting two tracks into the top 10 is a pretty stellar achievement.

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): TWO WOMEN??

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): What’s the math on “I’m every woman” versus “I’ll be more than a woman?” Which is more quantitatively yass queen?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): more than a llama

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): RATE WINNER AALIYAH YAZZZZ

**fadedblue09** (10): Can't believe I need to explain my case for picking this. I picked this for two reasons: (1) It got a lot of 11s and 10s from rate regulars and (2) it was one of the 2 songs to pose a threat to Full Moon's victory (at some point they both had a 9.3 avg). Those 2 reasons made me assume the song was well liked but apparently not. Maybe next time try putting some thoughts into y'all's scores instead of mindlessly submitting because it affects more than just the rate results you know? :(

**frogaranaman** (10): she/they

**nt96** (10): R&B perfection

**qazz23** (10): the beat on this is insane

**runaway3212** (10): I was kinda bummed the woman+ subscription increased their price by 5 dollars a month but look at the moment

**shipperondeck** (10): peak

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): honestly im happy i get to rate this again this was one of my favorite songs from the album and i kidna forgot about it before the hosts decided to send it in again

**throwaway-7650** (10): 🙄I'd never tank aaliyah out of spite but🙄

**Frajer** (9.5): Aaliyah and Timbaland were such a magical pairing

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): [2] same comment as try again

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): This beeeeeeaaaaat, and the vocalsssss

**akanewasright** (9): y’all shouldn’t have sent two Aaliyah songs

**jsonphile** (9): Timbaland and Aaliyah have done it again

**Nagisoid** (9): When I hear this old song they still play. Damn, Aaliyah really had no match in R&B, I'm simply speechless when I listen to this.

**timothy444** (9): Awesome 2000s jam

**WaneAllstarToc** (8.8): she's IN the motorcycle?! she's IN the SOUL of fast and furious?!?! that rules. this would sound great at a rubios at 2:30 pm on a tuesday when I show up for $2 fish tacos

**1998tweety** (8.5): enby bop

**camerinian** (8.5): Timbaland is actually really good at making beats did anyone know this

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): ugh this would be a 10 if the mixing wasn’t so ass

**IIIHenryIII** (8): the repetitiveness works so nice here

**imbaby122** (8): omg i instantly transported to the early 2000s this song is so powerful.

**plastichaxan** (8): I have no clever comment for this she just ate

**jman457** (7.3): Its a little plain lyrically 3

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.3): More than a 7 (but less than a 7.5)

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): better than try again thankfully

**phonethephoenix** (6.5): I want more to this song

**bigbigbee** (6): woman…..TWO!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): feels like she’s off the beat

**daythreeinmiami** (4.5): That just sounds tiring. I am so sorry. I ask for forgiveness.

**TiltControls** (8.2): Though I’m not often the biggest fan of this genre, this track works for me in an odd way. There’s a dark aura to the production that really just fits perfectly with what the track is trying to do. A lot of predictions saying this could make it far, but unfortunately its run stops at the bottom of the top 10.

**flava** (3.5): yeah this grew off me quite a lot in all honesty sorry poppy and yetti, this just doesn’t sound good to me anymore, a purposefully disjointed mess of a song that I sure can respect, but just don’t ultimately like all that much.

---

**akanewasright** (10): the best song ever made

**anothertown** (10): sophie and cecile the timbo and missy of the fleet aisle

**Birdseeding** (10): Yessss to all UK Bass and its descendents

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Sometimes you just need a song that makes your body turn into a Sims glitch.

**bluehxrizon** (10): thinking about her still makes me sad :(

**bogo** (10): ended mark zuckerberg

**DirtyRat583** (10): sophie supremacy.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): slay bleep bloop noises

**IIIHenryIII** (10): R.I.P. SOPHIE

**imbaby122** (10): the first time my sister heard this song she asked me if sophie sampled a donkey. my face is the front of shop. haw hee haw hee haw haw haw hee haw

**jman457** (10): this song had capitalism and the self-care economy in a chokehold

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): my face is the front of shop.

**Nagisoid** (10): Everybody, stand up for Madonna's anthem. The bridge is still one of the best things to come out of hyperpop, it rivals Immaterial, and the production is something else.

**nt96** (10): My hips grew 5 inches, my makeup was popping,

**phonethephoenix** (10): sounds!!!!!!

**pig-serpent** (10): This song changed music forever. There will never be anything else like it.

**plastichaxan** (10): On my way to the shop I front y’all want anything?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if Unlock It is the gateway drug to hyperpop, this is the final boss

**runaway3212** (10): when I first heard this… something truly shifted

**sarcasticsobs** (10): CRONCHY

**Stryxen** (10): it's so bizarre that this mp3 file of metal scraping and squirting is inseparable from a deep sadness now <3 I love you Sophie

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): do indieheads hyperpop rate (opens may 1st)

**thedoctordances1940** (10): 2023 rate winner on ph and ih i know it's true

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): it gives me anxiety in the best way

**throwaway-7650** (10): hope this can win over immaterial @ indieheads

**vayyiqra** (10): This video and the single art for this song utterly terrify me and make me feel nauseated and needing to throw up. Great song!

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Super Mario 64 except instead of Mario's face it's Sophie's

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): this was prolly the last RLLY important sophie ditty

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.9): justice for ponyboy

**03O9** (9.5): IM REAL WHEN I SHOP MY FACE

**camerinian** (9): conceptually iconic, practically difficult to listen to, SOPHIE in a nutshell

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): yassification anthem

**Around-town** (8): great because it's weird

**Frajer** (8): rip Sophie shame she never got to work with Bjork

**qazz23** (8): love the change up two minutes in and how the beats switch between distant and close

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is mostly for poppy

**welcome2thejam** (8): The way this song makes me want to move is illegal in twenty-nine U.S. states

**frogaranaman** (7): she was so real for this

**oscarbrierley1** (7): a bit grating, but it sounds interesting.

**timothy444** (6.5): That random-ass part in the middle did not need to be there but as the song progresses, it does become slightly better to listen to. It's almost like SOPHIE was trying to scare away the normies in the first half

**bigbigbee** (6): Wish I liked the bridge more because I really like everything else about this

**daythreeinmiami** (6): The production and vocal delivery is great but sometimes sounds just really hurt my ears.

**intheaftermath** (6): it gets old fast. I can only handle the weird steel grinding for so long. I can see how people like it but it's just not for me

**CrimsonROSET** (5): shoutouts to that one contrapoints video

**jsonphile** (5): I feel awful rating SOPHIE low again I want to get into her music but I just don’t understand it

**Awkward\_King** (4): girl i still dont know what this means

**1998tweety** (2): i like 10% of this song

**NotWith10000Men** (1): fiona does pots and pans waaaaay better

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): i see the appeal but it’s uncomfortable for me to listen to

TiltControls: This rate was a very ‘not-for-tilt’ type rate, but I’m glad I did it. Even if some of my scores were low, I enjoyed a little of everything off each of the albums. Plus it was probably well past due time to rate SOPHIE proper.

**plastichaxan** (10.333): Hosting this was amazing overall and I loved to see all the love for Sophie especially, and all the records she broke and the average jump aaa a moment most pleasing to me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10.333): best rate ever made

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): deserves a 10+ average from everyone

**bulforster** (10.000): I didn't finish this rate but as I was trying I remember thinking the drilling going on where I was staying at the time was part of anonhi's album.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.733): RIP SOPHIE

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.733): was not in a grindset to do this rate. well rock on that it happened.

**nt96** (9.667): As an experimental hoe, this rate was tailor made for me.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.500): I’m still traumatized by that Anohni album

**Stryxen** (9.333): condragulations 4 degrees

**cremeebrulee** (9.267): these picks were Too Excellent, some of these other rates should be scared

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.667): i still stand by anohni’s mass panning #sorry

**DirtyRat583** (8.333): can u tell which 2 songs i was familiar with before the rate

**RandomHypnotica** (8.167): one of the best themes all year

**Roxieloxie** (8.000): I did this rate cause i wanted to support poppy and static despite it not super being my thing but it was pretty chill, i remember I did it while playing geogessr which was a vibe

**fadedblue09** (6.833): very fun discovery

**ImADudeDuh** (4.333): me saying I didn’t want to do the rate cause I feel weird giving the SOPHIE songs I don’t like (most of them) a bad score and then having the host be like “yeah but we want those bad scores” kinda sent me

**cremeebrulee** (10): give me a song about being emotionnally unavailable and i will eat it up every time

**CrimsonROSET** (10): something something if i had two nickels

**frogaranaman** (10): pwetty

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): universally timeless smash like

**Nagisoid** (10): Did anybody count how many times he said it? This is one of my favorite beats of all time and the little details really make the song, plus a lot of lines are clever and the hook gets stuck on you.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): i see why y'all are begging this man for another album

**plastichaxan** (10): To be the person Frank Ocean writes a song about… A dream

**Roxieloxie** (10): my favorite memory of this rate was that I helped the host with the reveal a little and therefore I saw all the banners and shit early which meant i saw /u/seanderlust 's iconic lovecrimes banner early and i keysmashed about it in the reveal but the post hadnt gone up yet so i had to quickly try and cover it up

**runaway3212** (10): I love drugs

**sarcasticsobs** (10): That "womp" that comes in at 1:12 did something to me

**shhhneak** (10): You don’t like this song?… yikes!

**throwaway-7650** (10): repenting for my previous 9.5 [2] literally wtf me

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): A saintly 11 was considered being dispatched to the Coachella 2k10 snapshot. I just think it's a great beat and a heartbreakingly honest lyric. you come out the gate with this you'll have attention. but forreal, I can't go back to the first time I heard this and if I could I'd have so much to fix that would still collapse on me. i dunno, i think frank tapped into something insane here. this was it.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Another song I'd consider 11ing if I didn't want a repeat 11, just the coolest beat

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Todd in the Shadows often asks what the best and worst two seconds of music in a year is. For 2011, it’s very possible that my favorite “two seconds” of music is when Frank says “….perfect.”

**camerinian** (9.5): should I read anything into when this was playing at one of my usual second hand clothes shops and the cute guy at the till was lip syncing the "fuck me good, fuck me long" bit as he folded my pants

**akanewasright** (9): so true

**Birdseeding** (9): While I love his Lonnie Breaux demos, this is where it really started to gel in one of the great music careers this century

**daythreeinmiami** (9): Imagine that type of income to sustain having cocaine for breakfast.

**imbaby122** (9): fantastic song but i kept turning my head thinking that someone snuck into my room and started moving the furniture around

**vayyiqra** (9): years ago my friend often quoted the line "cocaine for breakfast, yikes!" when she was dealing with a drug problem (she's better now don't worry) and i didn't know it was from this song. good song

**shipperondeck** (8.5): can i talk about the cover art referencing roxy music's Stranded again

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): novocaine sounds like a hell of a drug

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): we love the one frank song on streaming going to AS6 by default

**qazz23** (8): some good harmonies near the end

**Stryxen** (8): great

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): songs to fall asleep to (positive)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.6): Is he dating the dentist from Little Shop of Horrors

**03O9** (7.5): with a rack like WOW!

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): im literally begging for a reason to rerate channel orange or blonde

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): thank god this is on spotify

**slimboyfriend** (7.4): thought I liked the song more than I actually did

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**anothertown** (7): stanley kubrick, this is some visionary shit 🤝

**jman457** (7): Is it bad that I find a lot of early Frank Ocean boring

**jsonphile** (7): frank ocean for me is an artist who’s always been good but never great. Channel orange is good. Blonde is good. This song is good. I’m not sure what I’m missing

**ricki** (7): novacane would make for a cunty drag name

**IIIHenryIII** (6): songs about sex are usually a hit or miss for me, this one’s a miss

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): fall out boy outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Production is hot but the lyrics are not and wow his vocal delivery is very annoying whenever he extends a note

**timothy444** (5.5): Sure the lyrics are great but I feel like he sings it with such an unenthusiastic tone that even himself is bored of telling the story of the song to the listener. Everything else is decent from the beat, rhythm and composition but his voice makes me not buy it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10.000): this rate had one of my highest overall rate averages ever, that’s just what happens when you pit 3 slay albums against each other..

**WaneAllstarToc** (10.000): cool rate congrats

**just\_thonking** (10.000): Kind of wish one of these two songs had won but either way in my unbiased opinion this rate was very good

**Roxieloxie** (10.000): 🫡 u/AltRnbStreetTeam

**akanewasright** (9.500): soooo glad this finally got picked

**cremeebrulee** (9.050): sure thing blowing up rn, die for you blowing up rn, quick we gotta get chanel on the billboard hot 100 NOW

**throwaway-7650** (9.000): HOB deserved a song here too tbh (ideally high for this)

**plastichaxan** (9.000): I knowingly hate men but maybe they’re not all bad

**nt96** (9.000): a bit surprising that it took us this long to rate these three albums considering their impact but I’m glad we did it!

**Stryxen** (9.000): condragulations kaleidoscope dream title track

**ImADudeDuh** (8.750): the hoops I had to go through to listen to Frank Ocean sing over Hotel California

**vayyiqra** (8.500): I regret not doing this :|

**IIIHenryIII** (7.500): I started this rate only because of Miguel but didn’t finish it. My scores wouldn’t have made a difference in the final results though given that he was up against The Weeknd

**DirtyRat583** (6.500): the miguel album was going so well how did he drop the ball that hard :(

**TiltControls** (10): When the rate first started this was actually my 11. I had planned to 11 it before the grass man being voted in threw a wrench in my plans. I ended up switching over to Porter, but I’m glad to see this doing so well (even if it took a while to get there)

**flava** (7): I can’t believe I was forced to root for this in charity rate, this song is just so overplayed here in the UK that I’m just perpetually sick of it but even if it magically wasn’t overplayed, I’d probably still be a little sick of it since it kinda just sticks in your head but not in the good way

---

**babadork** (11): This was on a mix of hit British pop music that was one of the first things I ever torrented. I was very excited to hear pop music that didn’t cross over into the US. This song was worth the two hours. The multiple Bob the Builder songs and a cover of “Too Close” were not.

**DirtyRat583** (11): "oh i know, i know, i know, i know, i know, i know, i know about your kind" homophobic dog picture

**ImADudeDuh** (11): She killed it! Audience laughs

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): this is the one time i will side with british people

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Dolly deserved the win but…the slay here is special.

**camerinian** (10): you know once you get past the murdery bit this is quite delightful

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this might win

**daythreeinmiami** (10): THE ICONICNESS OF THIS WHOLE SONG. The video clip to this song is one of my favourites. That green eyeshadow is freaking iconic.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i would willingly let sophie stomp on me

**frogaranaman** (10): this track exudes Gay Bar at 1:45am (the best vibe)

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is gonna go out at like #4 and we’re all gonna act shocked

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a perfect song

**Memezaharamole** (10): wasn't expecting to give this such a high score, but it's got an infectious energy

**nootnoot781** (10): literally the best song of all time

**oscarbrierley1** (10): bop of bops, she slayed (litterally)

**phonethephoenix** (10): okay love this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I will throw butter underneath Jolene's foot

**seanderlust** (10): is that what caused the panic at the disco

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): invented homicide!

**throwaway-7650** (10): hate that this isn't my 11

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.6): Everyone knows this ditty! i bet wall-e and EVE had RAD [redacted] to this!

**shhhneak** (9.1): This sounds so fresh to me? It’s from 2001 but you could convince me it’s Jessie Ware-ified nu-disco.

**bogo** (9): it's me i was murdered and this song is the culprit

**Frajer** (9): Gregg Alexander is such a good pop songwriter

**IIIHenryIII** (9): killer song or should I say, wait for it… murderer song

**intheaftermath** (9): songs about murder >>>

**qazz23** (9): this would fit right in with the recent disco revival

**runaway3212** (9): I truly am obsessed

**sarcasticsobs** (9): MUHDAAAA

**welcome2thejam** (9): Good thing Professor Layton's in this rate he can solve this murder case

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.9): I guess she's cute

**imbaby122** (8.8): i love to murder on the dancefloor (dance very awkwardly at college parties and think about how much cooler i’d look if i were on the aux)!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (8.7): this is a cute little bop! her little vocal quirks in the way she says the lines adds a lot to it. my score kept going up and up and up as I listened

**jman457** (8.5): A Bop that just puts you in a good mood

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is not how a crime scene should be handled girl youre tampering with the evidence

**dreamingpastel** (8): Those strings!!

**plastichaxan** (8): MOTHER on the Dancefloor

**Stryxen** (8): fun as hell

**timothy444** (8): There isn't really much there to say about it other than it's a decent bop

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): with a title like murder on the dancefloor I need a more dramatic instrumental…. This is like Fun Little Twirl on the Dancefloor

**heysoupie** (7): i don’t really understand the hype around this song. Its definitely not bad. But I don’t remember ever hearing it before this year, and I don’t think I’d really be able to recall it even after multiple listens.

**Nagisoid** (7): Dua Lipa wants what she has. I read the title and thought this was an Arctic Monkeys song at first, lol. Anyways, this is so catchy it's actually scary and the funky elements are great.

**Uberpigeon** (7): they just need to let her say fucking

**vayyiqra** (7): it's good but it's not that good the lyrics are gibberish ! i have spoken. still hard not to jam at least a little with a funk guitar riff

**impla77** (6.3): Showgirls teas

**Birdseeding** (6): Not a huge lover of nu-disco but this is about the best the genre has to offer, very catchy

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): as a kid i was introduced to her through her stint on strictly and never quite grasped why the hosts/judges always joked about murders on the dancefloor

**pig-serpent** (5): I hate the popular songs here where it just feels like I'm missing something. This song is mildly enjoyable but I have no strong feelings about it whatsoever, please tell me what I'm missing here guys. I want to be one of the cool kids.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): someone call an ambulance...but not for me!

**Roxieloxie** (3): This vs joleeen was such a funny top 2 moment cause either way I lost.

**thedoctordances1940** (3): kinda boring and will probably do way too well

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): I don’t get this song at all. Clumsy lyrics from “Murder on the Dancefloor” to Sophie’s bored yet raspy singing. The production is fine but the melody and vocal phrasing drives me truly insane, I cannot stand this one bit. The way she sings “so and so and so” and “dancefloor” in the chorus, oh god it makes me so angry. Yes I literally hosted a rate full of 2000s British pop music so I’ll be “losing my British card” but my Jamaican and Irish ass didn’t want that shit anyway!!!!!

**Overall Average**: 7.863 **// Average Controversy:** 2.097

TiltControls: I still don’t know if rating that many songs at once was a great idea or not. It was fun at least! Though in hindsight I should’ve stuck with my gut with my original song pick (though, to be fair I really thought she was releasing Masochism for real this time and it was less funny knowing that might happen)

**flava** (10): yeah this was probably my

**TiltControls** (9): We love the first Kpop song to get top 10 in an All Stars rate

---

**1998tweety** (10): literal pop perfection but y'all will send this out day 1 cause its not English

**anothertown** (10): famously i had a dream once that fromis_9 won a pulitzer for this song. deserved!

**Awkward\_King** (10): whats next GAS LIGHT by newjeans

**bigbigbee** (10): dodododododododododododododododododododododododo

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I might be wrong but I think this was my first runner up 11. Still stings.

**bogo** (10): is a love bomb just a stronger version of a yass grenade

**bulforster** (10): I guess my flover era is over, their average from me has dropped below 11.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): my 11 in the original rate and still one of my favorite kpop songs evaaaa

**DirtyRat583** (10): this samples marshmello and u cant convince me otherwise

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): more like YASS BOMB

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): this should have been in winners

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh here’s the smasha

**musical\_pyn** (10): maybe the best k-pop song i've ever heard?

**plastichaxan** (10): It wasn’t a love bomb it was a yass grenade

**RandomHypnotica** (10): my little meow meows I love you so much

**ricki** (10): no other kpop song has kpopped like this before

**runaway3212** (10): the chorus makes me go feral

**thedoctordances1940** (10): that bowling alley is definitely not to regulation smh far too short

**throwaway-7650** (10): I've seen the light idk how this wasn't a 10 before

**welcome2thejam** (10): Gotta be one of my top five bombs

**akanewasright** (9.5): this is a good song but I’m glad it lost

**intheaftermath** (9.5): yeah this is music <3

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): imagine the alternate universe where fromis_9 won a rate on r/popheads against numerous kpop heavy-hitters LOL

**pig-serpent** (9.5): An explosion of that sickeningly sweet K-pop that we all know and love. Extremely accurate title.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): its so SO close to being perfect but theres something about it that keeps it just the tiniest bit away from getting a 10...and the worst part is i cant even pick out what part it is

**Birdseeding** (9): this may be the best kpop song I've ever heard

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we love whiplash in interludes

**jasannn** (9): oh, a time when they weren’t rehashing the same song in different filters.

**jman457** (9): such a bop about abusive relationships

**Nagisoid** (9): This song is pure euphoria, god. It's almost perfect, but the short trap part does not fit in and brings it a little bit down.

**Roxieloxie** (9): huge bop, i've incorporated it into alot of my playlist

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): this had me bopping at the office

**timothy444** (9): Catchy k-pop track

**vayyiqra** (9): yeah it's a banger no discourse

**jsonphile** (8.5): didn’t expect to like the kpop songs here this much

**MassiveThief** (8.5): yeah that chorus is IT

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): probably one of the best kpop choruses I’ve heard so far but the rest doesnt give as much

**cremeebrulee** (8): they really released this sugary song about an act of manipulation, queens!

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I’m a big fan of Alone so I automatically loved this

**imbaby122** (8): why does this song have mgmt energy? or maybe the better question is why does every song with synths in the chorus have mgmt energy to me these days? my mind is plagued i’m so scared.

**qazz23** (8): the chorus is really catchy

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): this is too energy drink for me but it’s fun!

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): wasn't sold at first but by the end yes!

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.5): god i dunno wat to do here; just wanna defuse the situation

**heysoupie** (7.4): i don’t really enjoy K-Pop but this song helps me understand the appeal.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.4): Bumping my score actually, but I still don't get the hype, chorus saves it, though it DOES encapsulate a specific version of kpop that I could show to someone unfamiliar with the genre as "this is kpop"

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.4): If we attacked people with love bombs instead of bomb bombs I think the world would be a much happier place

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I don’t totally vibe with the verses and post chorus, but I fuck HARD with that chorus, same with the bridge, until that weird dubstep noise that was all the rage in 2015 comes in. What a shame, that chorus really is kinda wasted on subpar verses.

**03O9** (6.5): never heard of them but more artists need underscores in their names and i support their mission.

**Stryxen** (6): idk how to explain it. It kinda bops but its just a bit messy and underdeveloped to me

**shhhneak** (4.9): this is why I don’t have friends on Spotify.

**camerinian** (4): sickly sweet

**shipperondeck** (3): how did this get second place in its rate

TiltControls: # K-Pop Girl Groups Smackdown

---

**Overall Average**: 8.088 **// Average Controversy:** 1.932

---

TiltControls: Like every Kpop rate, I usually have no idea about anything going in and discovering tons of amazing songs. I don’t remember much about the rate, but I still have a lot of songs from it saved - so that’s got to be a good sign.

**DirtyRat583** (10.000): saranghae 🫰 (am i doing this right)

**RandomHypnotica** (10.000): a rate of incredibly messy proportions

**throwaway-7650** (9.950): justice for la di da/so bad/deja vu/etc.

**bigbigbee** (9.750): HUGE props to the hosts for what a good job they did with this one - it was a ton of fun, minimally messy, and such a great celebration of the best that 3rd gen k-pop has to offer : ) the most participated rate of all time!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (9.750): The Feels is a good song and a good winner, you guys are just trying too hard to be different

**vayyiqra** (9.500): Fun rate! Speedrunning this was a mistake. I did not like all the results. Let's do more K-pop rates soon!

**welcome2thejam** (9.000): Just wanted to give a final official shoutout to GG Smackdown, the combo of ratemas and the fun of this rate pushing me to explore a lot more (especially in music with foreign languages) is the reason why I'm so involved with rates today

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.000): well i hosted this so :D ty to the cohosties belbicki for being so slay and it was a fun time!!

**nt96** (8.000): This rate was wild lol. Having minimal knowledge of this genre, I had no clue what was good and what wasn’t. Next thing you knew, most of the songs I liked were cut early and the ones I didn’t like made it far. Overall, it was an experience.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.000): JUSTICE FOR LA DI DA!!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (7.700): Where WJSN?

**plastichaxan** (7.500): I am misandrist so this has been my favorite K-Pop rate I’ve done

**Stryxen** (7.500): condragulations oh! my mistake

**IIIHenryIII** (7.500): I had a chance to expand my taste in k-pop but I failed, another rate I missed

**WaneAllstarToc** (6.250): k-pop is a vital online cultural export for mass western consumption and discord back channel bickering

**TiltControls** (10): I love this song but also :pointandlaugh:

---

**impla77** (11): Me in Fire Emblem when the 87% attack misses!!

**just\_thonking** (11): the letters of "Magdalena Bay - You Lose!" can be rearranged to spell "O boy a mega slay! U.N. deal".. I don't know about the U.N. deal bit but the first part definitely can't be a coincidence

**Nagisoid** (11): No, I think they will win. This is the best song I've heard in some time, everything about it is perfect. I haven't listened to any of their other stuff, but they're pretty high on my bucket list now. Best band to do glitchy shoegaze since Sweet Trip, but not like anyone else can pull it off except them. This sound is literal crack to me and I can't wait to get more of it.

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): YOU WIN! (hopefully)

**anothertown** (10): i think this is one of the least interesting songs off mercurial world but i'm pilled

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Remember when this came in second place? What if I told you they’re a masterminds?

**bogo** (10): when this gets second again

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): and when this comes 2nd again

**hikk** (10): we want it to be #2 again

**IIIHenryIII** (10): …again 🙁

**imbaby122** (10): this song losing is proof that manifestation is real and the title of the song jinxed itself. bc ur telling me the gamer/redditor overlap isn’t big enough to give this song a W? i don’t believe it.

**jasannn** (10): I have 100+ streams of this and I honestly only know 4 lines of this song.

**jman457** (10): It’s not even my top 5 fave Mercurial world track, but it’s still fantastic

**plastichaxan** (10): Like 59 of the songs here omg

**qazz23** (10): wouldn't it be funny if this ends up the winner?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): imagine the gag if this came second again

**ricki** (10): that’s it im not letting you make any more songs about losing, that was so embarrassing

**runaway3212** (10): and guess what! They were right

**Stryxen** (10): the world stopped. human kind was waiting with bated breath. everyone felt a shift. we were never the same.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): coming for second place two rates in a row!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): me to this song again this rate

**throwaway-7650** (10): if this places 2nd again I'm pulling a selegend

**welcome2thejam** (10): This title is always gonna be such a setup lmao. This might've been my 11 if I didn't want to avoid a repeat

**babadork** (9.8): I felt bad about how much more I like Magdalena Bay than the other groups in this rate, so I couldn’t finish my ballot.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): vidya game-ass music

**phonethephoenix** (9.6): me playing video games

**Awkward\_King** (9): idk song makes me happy

**ignitethephoenix** (9): still sour this was the mag bay pick ….

**timothy444** (9): Is this indie electro-pop? Idk but this song is good

**daythreeinmiami** (8.7): This is a band that has not lost since 2017. I can’t believe how far they have become since ‘Neon’. Which y’all should stream. Also ‘Ghost’. Stream ‘Ghost’. I promise it will be a great life decision. If you don’t, You Lose!

**1998tweety** (8.5): me playing Valorant

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.2): we’ll be cacklin when they lose! again

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.2): This sounds very uwu

**akanewasright** (8): I had my phase with this, it’s over now, but it’s still great

**camerinian** (8): this is like late-2010s radio pop if it was actually texturally interesting and had a vocal performance that was compelling instead of wallpaper

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): prophetic title

**ImADudeDuh** (8): me to [please insert the last place song here so i look smart] on day 1 and me to [please insert the first song eliminated on day 2 here so I look smart] on day 2.

**intheaftermath** (8): wednesday is not only the greatest betrayal

**lexiaredery** (8): This grew on me a lot

**pig-serpent** (8): I still can't decide if this songs hits for me or not.

**vayyiqra** (8): Remember when this lost ahaha nothing against Magbay but that was a very funny moment!

**Roxieloxie** (7.3): sure

**slimboyfriend** (7.2): interesting but not here for the baby singing voice

**03O9** (7): terrible mag bay song pick

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): the noise pop production helps obfuscate Mica’s vocal tics that physically make me recoil so this is a nicer magbay song than what I’m used to

**nt96** (7): Who's gonna tell them?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): them in this rate

**WaneAllstarToc** (6.9): shockingly not one of my favorite mag bay cuts. it can keep losing.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the title held true the first time, it’ll hold true the second too!

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): this gets so much acclaim from the sub for how esoteric its lyrics are, like if caroline polachek put this out it would absolutely get a 4.3 jukebox rating

**NotWith10000Men** (5.2): pretty blah

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): chaeri deserved

**bluehxrizon** (4): i absolutely love magdalena bay but this is my least fave song of theirs

**hikk** (10.333): hikk rate all-stars comeback goals: at least ONE song in day 2 ... enter the top 60 of the rate ...

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): CHVRCHES would've gone farther than porter tbh

**Stryxen** (10.000): condragulations asking for a friend

**vayyiqra** (9.667): What a great rate! It ruled.

**bigbigbee** (9.000): ate…..so good

**DirtyRat583** (9.000): still mad at you lose! not winning

**Roxieloxie** (8.433): I didnt do this rate, I think it was less deliberate and more so that I ran out of time and the two songs I had heard I wasnt huge fans of, but all of these are really nice I should go back

**IIIHenryIII** (8.333): not KKB sneaking in the rate, me and they won’t happen

**nt96** (7.833): We really said screw CHVRCHES didn’t we? Asking For A Friend deserved better and yall said, fuck that, lets give it to our rate winner instead. Shame on all of you.

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.300): ????? you could have let me rate Hysterical Us and give it an 11

**just\_thonking** (6.667): Where the KKBauchery began and where my KKBacklash now finds its target

**plastichaxan** (6.333): So much representation! Two excellent EPs, a great album, a mid album, and a bad one

**ImADudeDuh** (6.000): CHVRCHES, you will always be the winners of the 2nd rate ever, you don’t need to beat these flops anymore, you’ve already won. Enjoy it.

**fadedblue09** (5.000): i wasn't rooting for any of the four albums here, so this was quite the experience

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.333): A rate I did not do as it’s not super my thing

**TiltControls** (9.2): If at first you don’t succeed… place really well in your follow-up even if you were never really in contention for winning. Also while a certain someone’s 0 next to mine is… noticeable, Try Again never had a hope of catching up to the rest of the top 4 by the end unless Flava had a sudden change of heart and tried to break the 11 barrier (which is illegal otherwise I would’ve done it for Porter yesterday). Maybe she can try again in Ultimate All Stars: All Stars at War in 2027

**flava** (0): true

---

**akanewasright** (11): the best song ever made I couldn’t believe it

**Birdseeding** (11): This track literally changed my life - it flipped my classic rock teenage music tastes on their head and got me into R&B, from there to dancehall, soca, kwaito, bongo flava, student radio deejaying, music writing, African cinema, film festivals, arts journal editing and eventually a career behind the scenes in the arts. I was mindblown by what Aaliyah and Timbaland showed music could be then, and I'm still in awe now.

**Frajer** (11): as promised that is a dope beat to step to and still sounds funky and fresh and I may be shy on the first date what about the next day is an all timer

**nt96** (11): [FLAVA DON’T YOU DARE!!!](https://superfame.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/get-a-job.jpg)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): A timeless masterpiece and the official theme song of All Stars Rates.

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Imagine, rating a song whose message is LITERALLY “If at first you don’t succeed, try again” and it gets second place in its original rate, and then it miraculously gets a second chance, and it DOESN’T win??? I would be embarrassed for Aaliyah

**anothertown** (10): real music real whisper singing

**babadork** (10): It might be because I spent hours learning the dance from the video, but I could put this on repeat for hours and be fine.

**bogo** (10): with a title like that if this doesn't win i'm gonna laugh my ass off

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this song was made for all stars i cant even be mad it didn’t win

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): RATE WINNER AALIYAH YAZZZZ

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I'll fix it, trying* again

**ImADudeDuh** (10): probably gonna win? idk

**jsonphile** (10): Timbaland just never misses. And Aaliyah absolutely rules this song

**plastichaxan** (10): This is so nice I wish I had the drive to try things a second time

**qazz23** (10): really good hook and production; I like how this gets to "Try Again" at being a winner

**Roxieloxie** (10): I'll be honest, its really hard for me to listen to aaliyah. She's an artist that has alot of songs I like and her influence is felt through so much, but if i independently go and listen to her i'll get so sad so fast. Both of us were alive at the same time, but for less than 24 hours, which is just enough for me to be unsettling and I think now being old enough to have a concept of just how young she was among just being upset how much the industry failed to protect her so many times, like I cannot. Her music is really good but so much of that baggage is attached that I rarely go out and seek it out

**sarcasticsobs** (10): da classic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): flava if you are responsible for this song not winning a rate for the second time in a row you are going to hell for real

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is the only acceptable song for you lose! to lose to

**welcome2thejam** (10): The true All-Stars theme song

**Memezaharamole** (9.4): Have really been getting into this style RnB from TNOC on Stereogum - this, Monica, Missy Elliott, even Genie in a Bottle was inspired by this production - all still sound so fresh.

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.1): it's not the protection drum but it's got similar production as that beat and it moves bigly. apparently I Got Your Soul is sampled here?

**lexiaredery** (9): A lot of this is probably nostalgia, but it's still great

**phonethephoenix** (9): will def be adding this to some playlists

**timothy444** (9): This was one of my throwback R&B jams back in the naughties days

**jman457** (8.6): Groovy and catchy

**1998tweety** (8.5): me after failling 3rd year orgo

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): If you think about it this could be the theme song for All Stars

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): me when I keep dying in Hades

**impla77** (8.5): me reloading in Fire Emblem when one of my characters dies (maybe i should turn off the permadeath option).

**slimboyfriend** (8.3): cool space lady

**imbaby122** (8): this song is so motivational poster hanging in my third grade classroom.

**Nagisoid** (8): The best Aaliyah did was good enough. Even if this song is the same lyrics repeated over and over again, it's still so good and Timbaland's production is just as crisp.

**pig-serpent** (8): I'm pretty sure my mom had this song on a Winnie the Pooh cd that I listened to a lot as a child, but I haven't heard this song since. Bonus points for the nostalgia blast.

**runaway3212** (8): all stars be like

**MagiKiwi29** (7.9): I have it on my playlist but I never actually listen to the full song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): more like flop again

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): i kinda love this as the Official All Stars 6 Theme Song

**shipperondeck** (7.2): there are other songs on the album that are better idk why this was her highest rated song

**Awkward\_King** (7): i very much support the meta-ness of this winning an all stars rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I really like the individual parts of this, but it’s a good minute longer than it needs to be.

**ricki** (6.5): okayyyy fart sample

**Stryxen** (6): don't dislike this at all but I just can't find much to really love about this (apart from the delectable electronic squelchy beat)

**daythreeinmiami** (5): Before we were all plastic bags floating in the wind wanting to start again, we had to learn to dust ourselves and try again.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): goes nowhere for me i fear

**nt96** (10.333): Y'all did Kelis dirty. Y'all did Aaliyah dirty. You know what, screw it, yall did Brandy dirty even though she WON! This rate will forever hold a special place in my heart and I'm glad we're rating TWO Aaliyah songs. Do NOT rob her!

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): I'll lament the lack of rock the boat here forever

**DirtyRat583** (10.000): this was almost my fav rate of the year (stares at brandy)

**akanewasright** (9.833): my favorite rate of the year in terms of Music Discovery

**fadedblue09** (9.667): Oh hey, it's my rate! While I had mixed feelings on the results overall, the winner made up for it. Also very satisfied with our AS picks. Hell, even the wildcard pick was a tasteful one too.

**ImADudeDuh** (9.667): now lets get more 2000s R&B rates

**plastichaxan** (9.333): Love rates where I get to discover music I’ve wanted to get into for a while but didn’t find the time

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.300): did not do this rate because while i did find the aaliyah CD for the bargain of $2. it was not a listen that grabbed me. simple as that. we'll come around at another point as we got high value targets here

**IIIHenryIII** (9.167): the third time my 11 has won (I’ve been keeping track now lol)

**Roxieloxie** (9.167): Im so sad I missed this rate, I remember trying to get through it the night before and got halfway throught the kelis album and I was just so tired from school I didnt get the chance

**vayyiqra** (8.667): Fun rate! My ballot was kind of a sneak which felt bad. Oh well!

**Stryxen** (7.667): condragulations sugar honey iced tea

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.167): where the fuck is Brandy… oh right she was in WINNERS

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.000): some amazing songs in this rate yasss

**ricki** (6.833): where’s rock the boat

**bulforster** (5.200): I was convinced rock the boat would be a surefire 11 win for me, oh well maybe for ratesgiving in 2026

**TiltControls** (8): Thought that this might’ve been bound for a rate win finally before starting the rate. And it might’ve! If not for a 0 holding it down. Though it was a close race between the top 4 in the end, we never really thought of it in consideration before the final day. Those last few ballots really brought its score up from the Try Again level to the rest of the top 4. It’s a solid song, but never really goes past that for me.

**flava** (7): I said what I said in NWGs this song is technically perfect but is absolutely a bore and a chore to get through, some of the least interesting but still good disco to be made. It made it too far

---

**slimboyfriend** (11): for the third rate on this sub I am begging you to give Debbie Harry SOMETHING before she dies

**03O9** (10): and an 11 for the miley cover

**1998tweety** (10): ended that fad Miley

**Awkward\_King** (10): yeah..... yeah

**bigbigbee** (10): “fart of ass”…is a re-used comment but I feel that I’m allowed one during this rate

**bulforster** (10): I tried to prevent this being a rate villain for a third time but oh well

**camerinian** (10): who is the genius who decided to skip a beat on the instrumental section I need to give them a big kiss on the forehead

**daythreeinmiami** (10): An iconic classic.

**DirtyRat583** (10): theres a reason this song is as iconic as it is

**fadedblue09** (10): why is everyone hating on this so much?? This was the only other acceptable winner

**Frajer** (10): calling an ex a pain in the ass Debbie Harry you will always be iconic

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Miley should be ashamed of ruining this banger

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/527346868544339970/1059922678150086786/image.png

**impla77** (10): I still can’t believe this didn’t win the rate

**jman457** (10): A certified classic.

**jsonphile** (10): this is just one of those songs that’s so boringly perfect there’s not much to talk about

**Memezaharamole** (10): nothing really to say or add, I mean, have you heard the material...?

**Nagisoid** (10): Yeah this song is simply flawless. The extended cut is almost always better for dance/disco songs, and this is no exception. The guy's voice is really nice and Debbie knocks it out of the park.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): hits, slaps, bangs, rocks, etc and I CANNOT BELIEVE y'all let this one get second. i'm ashamed of myself for not participating for that alone

**pig-serpent** (10): One of the songs in this rate that can very reasonably be called the best song ever written. I think this is winning.

**qazz23** (10): amazing rhythm section and vocals, love the disco feel

**ricki** (10): fuck once in a lifetime fr

**throwaway-7650** (10): cleared once in a lifetime (this will make day 3!)

**Uberpigeon** (10): this is a ten idc if its an obvious winner and gets hate its a TEN

**vayyiqra** (10): no discourse everyone shut up just enjoy the all-timer

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Okay Debbie Harry, I guess I can forgive you for West Coast Smoker

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): A great, classic song but my mind will never not go to “Fart of Ass” instantly.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): to think this will be rate villain in three different rates… iconic kinda

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): it’s fine

**sarcasticsobs** (9): So glad that no one has ever tried to cover this, that’d be a shame!

**shipperondeck** (9): aw omg yall voted in a song from mine and bul's rate!!!! <3 love u all

**thedoctordances1940** (9): booooooo (but also it's fantastic)

**welcome2thejam** (9): Now that Talking Heads won their face-off I can firmly say with no reservations this song rocks

**bogo** (8.5): kinda got diminishing returns with this one it's not as enjoyable as it once was

**imbaby122** (8.5): i thought i accidentally put the song on repeat, why does it go on for so long???

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): I think Miley has forever tainted this song for me

**cremeebrulee** (8): i'm a child the way that comment "fart of glass" makes me laugh every time

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): the feeling when this comes on at pre-drinks is unmatched

**runaway3212** (8): miley outsold

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): heart of glass has never been my fav blondie

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): how many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man

**Roxieloxie** (7): the only time my vote in life has mattered was when I gave this a 7 and once in a lifetime an 11 and caused it to loose

**akanewasright** (6): sigh

**Stryxen** (6): not really that good i don't understand!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): fart of ass

**hikk** (5): kind of feel like this could pull a dancing queen and frankly that's a terrifying prospect

**plastichaxan** (5): I like this but I wish it a very day 1

**timothy444** (5): I don't hate it but I don't like it

**frogaranaman** (3): thankful that this is the origin point towards Pitchfork calling Miley Cyrus a “celebrated covers artist” 🙏

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2): this is just so dull and lifeless

**WaneAllstarToc** (0): that was way too close that it got to 2nd place and almost took out 3/4th the entire reason that rate was held (for the other albums' better showstopper ditties; it was a good thing talking heads one we're so proud of them everyone do the gospel dance!). rn we're rating 2 of the other 4 here and I just gotta hand it to them that I wanna play them at my party instead of heart of glass. idk less like an irrational hate 0 and just a "tactical no no why was this sent god almighty let it go go away!" 0. sorry blondie we'll try you again in a few years if I stumble into finding the albums for cheap again.

**vayyiqra** (10.000): A moment most pleasing to my rate career, we got to rate four great albums, my 11 won (!) and I got the banner comment (!!), B-52's were robbed, the 80s were revived, and so on

**ImADudeDuh** (10.000): this rate was so fucking fun and good and i hate that we don’t get more boomer rates

**nt96** (9.667): Rating 4 bands from the late 70s-early 80s with some rock n roll elements would seem pretty unlikely to rate given the PH demographic, but we did it! This rate was so fun and as a B-52's fan, seeing them get relentlessly dragged, having only one song on day 3 and pulling thru and making the top 5 was a roller coaster. Very fun rate!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.667): I missed this one too, which is so frustrating

**Stryxen** (8.667): condragulations one way or another

**plastichaxan** (8.333): Probably one of my favorite rates last year, it introduced me to one of my favorite albums now and just loved the vibe overall

**bigbigbee** (8.167): bonded with my mom and dad over this rate :) it was nice

**fadedblue09** (7.500): I'm glad we did this rate and I discovered some bangers but if I'm being completely honest, I was underwhelmed by most of the albums here. Some of the songs here were just kitschy and annoying, and I realized that the new wave genre was not for me.

**throwaway-7650** (7.000): I wish I did NWG to prevent rate winner talking heads

**DirtyRat583** (7.000): we need a new new wave

**WaneAllstarToc** (6.667): one of the easiest rates held in the history of rates. the contentious nature of blondie, an act that also I still struggle with (and sold my parallel lines $3 tape I did after the rate!) lowered what's a 10/10 cut to an irrational hate 0. purposeful

**TiltControls** (10): Oh Charli. You came so close. Will you ever do it again? While I gave the entire top 3 good scores, I have to admit I was really hoping Charli would finally pull out the rate win here. Partially cause it’s one of the few Charli songs I actually love, partially cause no one seemed to have faith in it doing well, and partially cause I’m getting tired of having to list her rate loss streak every time we rate her. Though it was trailing behind in 2nd for the early rate, it actually managed to take the lead for a little bit before the last few extensions brought it back down to 3rd. In another world we could be seeing Charli get her first rate win here if any of the (even slight) low scorers didn’t send their ballot. Or maybe if she got a few more 11s. All of these what ifs, but here she is without a rate win again. Maybe she’ll do it in the future with Boom Clap. Also to note that this was the only track never to leave the top 10 (and almost never to leave the top 5 except for a single ballot)

---

**03O9** (11): she’s a genius… the build up.. the emotion… the everything

**imbaby122** (11): setting myself up for disappointment again…track 11!!! please popheads we love charli sm, we love ag cook, we love being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking ,and cheating, and we love being horrible relationship partners. let’s get this song to the top 🙏

**phonethephoenix** (11): yeah, track 10/10! charli and ag at their best. I loveee this song. I do have to say I like the addition of the lizzo verse in blame it on your love. feels cliche to give it an 11 but it really is great

**pig-serpent** (11): With all the songs in this rate I've called the best song of all time (4, I think) I have to give my 11 to this because my need for a Charli win is the only reason I'm doing this rate.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): this is so formative to my music tastes tbh it needs the 11

**1998tweety** (10): i mean its in the name

**akanewasright** (10): I hate you all for voting this in. Don’t fuck this up

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): At this point Boom Clap is probably Charli’s most viable path to a rate win. Sunrise. Sunset.

**bogo** (10): we didn't need this song here i don't want to relive the pain

**camerinian** (10): just put me in the "track 10/10" section

**cremeebrulee** (10): i am not perceiving where this places AT ALL!!!!!!

**DirtyRat583** (10): haha wouldnt it be funny haha if i gave it a 10 after track 10 haha do you get it haha

**fadedblue09** (10): I should've been bolder and joined the Bad Girls 11 Squad but this is also good

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it’s titled like this because there's like 10 different songs combined into one

**jman457** (10): This will always be defying pop song

**MassiveThief** (10): changed everything

**Nagisoid** (10): Hey, I'm just doing what the song title is asking me to! Yeah, this hasn't aged a bit and is still amazing. Some parts of it remind me of Utopia by Bjork, but actually interesting. Her adlibs peaked here too, tbh.

**plastichaxan** (10): God (Charli) forgive me for once again not 11ing this I promise I will in indieheads

**RandomHypnotica** (10): :(

**Roxieloxie** (10): I'll be honest I still dont like this song but im not going through the stress that came from being the lowest score and public enemy number one on this again so whatever, yall win

**runaway3212** (10): winner energy

**sarcasticsobs** (10): People died

**slimboyfriend** (10): would give this my 11 if it had any chance of making it past day 1

**Stryxen** (10): one wolf wants to give this a (track) 10 the other wants to give this a (pop) 2

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): a 10 for track 10 ofc

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): do indieheads hyperpop rate (opens may 1st)

**thedoctordances1940** (10): gonna continue giving every song on this album a 10 every time it's rated throughout this year

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): wow this one is still good. um we'll again, talk more about why i think this is a great cut when indieheads rates it.

**impla77** (9): Okay, I’m feeling the fantasy more now

**nt96** (9): Cyberpop will forever be XCX stan equivalent of ‘Nam Flashbacks.

**qazz23** (9): I like the chaotic section in the middle, before everything suddenly cuts out to the harp

**seanderlust** (9): hmm. remember that time that morbius flopped in theaters and then it became such a thing online that they brought it back only for it to flop again? track 10 is the morbius of this rate.

**daythreeinmiami** (8.9): I will have to give this a high score just simply for the fact one of my best friends loves this song and Charli XCX and if my intoxicated memory at the time serves me correctly, he was drunk at my kitchen table finger pointing to the sky during the chorus. Bless his heart.

**Frajer** (8.5): I think she just summoned an alien

**timothy444** (8.5): Never actually have listened to this album in full but even I can tell that this track has such a closing song vibe. I'd personally describe it as 100 gecs lite with SOPHIE inspired production.

**anothertown** (8): like a rosetta stone for a dead language

**shhhneak** (8): it’s giving 2042 Pepsi Super Bowl Half Time Performance

**vayyiqra** (8): yeah I don't quite "connect with this" and lose my mind over it and never have but I am man enough to admit my score for this was kind of a lowball in hindsight I was conflicted pensive emoji

**heysoupie** (7.4): this is one of those tracks that honestly repelled me from Charli when this album came out - it sounds like so many other songs. While now I hear other artists and think “this sounds like Charli” when I heard this song, I thought sort of the opposite.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): it's interesting. probably the best charli song i've heard

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That one Motomami meme

**CrimsonROSET** (5): really can i just rate bioyl

**throwaway-7650** (5): more like track 10/2 haha (this score fluctuates sm)

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4.5): this is like 3 minutes longer than it needs to be

**ignitethephoenix** (4): once again, Blame it On Your Love is a much better song, even though this captures the mood of the lyrics better. Production is not suited at all for this and I honestly cannot enjoy this and come back to it

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i legit like Blame It On Your Love more 🤷

**intheaftermath** (4): went into this with high expectations from you all and wow i did not enjoy this!

**Awkward\_King** (3): im so sorry ily akane

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): lowers volume.

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I’d describe this song as “gluttonous,” it over indulges in its own pointlessness and massacres a perfectly good pop song for no reason. So glad Charli is past her qUiRkY xD phase.

TiltControls: To think how different the All Stars line up would’ve been had Bad Girls not pulled off the win. Glad that my rate enemy from this rate was already banned otherwise I might’ve joined Flava with a high scoring 0.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10.000): it's all lipslap

**plastichaxan** (10.000): This rate really had 4 of my favorite albums ever like it was nothing wtf

**bulforster** (9.933): I guess I kind of got an 11 winner out of this even though I missed it.

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.833): how the fuck did the most 8.5/10 cut win?

**Stryxen** (9.667): condragulations software upgrade

**cremeebrulee** (9.433): this sure was a rate 😀

**vayyiqra** (9.333): hey it's that rate I helped host :D fun times good rate very funny results

**welcome2thejam** (8.667): My bad y'all

**IIIHenryIII** (8.667): M.I.A. taking the crown after being dragged through the mud was one of the most iconic rate reveal moments ever

**throwaway-7650** (8.333): the hosts should've sent REALiTi (Demo) so I could 11 it fr

**DirtyRat583** (8.333): bad girls my baby winning a rate i almost cried

**nt96** (8.333): This rate was wild! As a cohost, my 11 was set to MIA from the start. Seeing her album get dragged was a struggle, especially when Bad Girls sat outside of the top 5 for some time, only for it to slowly climb up the ranks. Charli fans relying on her magnum opus for just one victory only to fall short, Grimes fans waiting five years to rerate her magnum opus only to get runner up AGAIN and nothing for KKB! Working with Sean and Vayy was an absolute blast and I’ll forever cherish these moments.

**akanewasright** (8.333): :dkminecart:

**Roxieloxie** (8.000): this rate being here is so funny like this rate was two weeks ago why are we rating this again

**fadedblue09** (7.333): A disastrous reveal but at least M.I.A got justice in the end

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.000): grimes and MIA were the two best parts of this rate so…that explains my average

**ImADudeDuh** (2.667): jumpscare

**TiltControls** (9): This ended up being the dark horse of the rate a little. For most of the rate it was a race between Charli and Genesis and then Megan kept building and building in score until she even took the lead at one point! Unfortunately for her, the ballot that would eventually bring her back down to second was missing a score that we got just as time was going to run out, sending her back down to 2nd. Not only that, but the score difference between the winner and this track ended up becoming the smallest in Popheads history with only 0.2 separating them! I think either of the top 2 would’ve made amazing winners, but there is something nice about new blood getting the rate win (since Megan had one not even a few months ago).

**flava** (7): true

---

**daythreeinmiami** (11): REAL HOT GIRL SHIT

**akanewasright** (10): FUCK BEING GOOD I’M A BAD BITCH!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): rooting for this to make a left-field winner with a 0.8 controversy score

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yes ma’am!

**bogo** (10): FUCK BEING GOOD I'M A BAD BITCH

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song has not stopped stepping on my neck since june 26th, 2020

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this rate closes after first cycle selection of 2023 so if anime doesn’t get in can i change this to a 0

**Frajer** (10): that sample goes so hard

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I don’t know what I had in mind when I gave this an 8

**ImADudeDuh** (10): robbed of winning the rate

**intheaftermath** (10): the best Megan song of all time tbh

**phonethephoenix** (10): yes!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): MOTHER Thee Stallion

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me leaving the store with aespa's next title track under my hoodie: - [2021] (comment courtesy of MK)

**Roxieloxie** (10): so true

**runaway3212** (10): I love meghan

**seanderlust** (10): i am physically incapable of screaming along to the chorus. and the wildfox line idc

**Stryxen** (10): immediate modern classic

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): weeb anthem

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): feasted

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): manifested anime rate it’s an automatic 10

**throwaway-7650** (10): shots fired deserved too! 2👑tho

**sarcasticsobs** (9.9): After she said "now he love tall women", I googled "megan thee stallion height" and wtf she's 5'10''??

**bulforster** (9.7): what's our plan for getting meg to do the anime rate?

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.6): MORE 👏 WEEBS 👏 ON 👏 THE 👏 POP 👏 CHARTS 👏

**shipperondeck** (9.5): i gave it a 10 in her rate but theres a lot of competition in this rate but this is STILL so good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): VOTE FOR THE ANIME RATE!!!! (unless it already got selected in which case...DO THE ANIME RATE!!!!)

**imbaby122** (9.3): side note but this pink bandana alphit on the single cover is my favorite alphit ever and i would kill and murder to own it.

**bigbigbee** (9): SasuNaru or NaruSasu? Let’s put it on the 2024 ballot

**impla77** (9): Hot girls vote for anime rate (I didn’t vote for it ofc)

**MassiveThief** (9): common megan slay

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Someone played a Powerpuff Girls AMV set to this song during the reveals and it honestly blew me away at how well-edited and well-made it was. Anyways, this is a banger.

**timothy444** (9): The naruto line may have influenced me into giving this a high score but it's also because everything that Megan Thee Stallion puts out (not including that Maroon 5 feature) is her giving it her all in the rap game. Amazing.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): gabbi hanna outsold

**NotWith10000Men** (8.2): she's so good at one-liners

**ignitethephoenix** (8): not my favorite track by her but still really good

**jman457** (8): Fun beat that Megan glides on

**vayyiqra** (8): 😝

**welcome2thejam** (8): Someone send Megan an anime rate ballot

**1998tweety** (7): I feel like Im missing something cause I always see people say this is one of her best songs but its kinda just ok to me. Anime references ate tho

**pig-serpent** (7): I wish I liked Megan more than I do, which isn't to say I dislike her music, but I've just never been impressed by her beats.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): good but she has better songs

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): well I’m glad she’s having fun

**Nagisoid** (6): That Sasuke line would have shut down Tumblr if Megan was popular back then. It's a fine song, I don't have any noteworthy comments about it other than the beat being kinda cute.

**WaneAllstarToc** (5): this is still a 6 but it made it to third place (?) so we'll drop it to a 5. yeah cool she talks about how hot she is and how she loves to FinDom some rich prick. the beat's sorta just there the same way a stoplight makes a beep noise when it tells me to cross the street. what im trying to say is that I feel like this cut is a Megan Brand Exercise more than an actual...cohesive song that goes somewhere. the fact that it is mercilessly short (no features no real bridge does not jump to 4 minutes) is also a double edged sword to all of this and sorta reinforces my "eh" gripe with a lot of Megan's music across Good News. an idea of "fuck you im a hot girl" self-actualization is present but is always simplified to meme stage. im babbling i know, but I just think megan should idk...write songs for the doom video game or like make ambient like kelela. could be beneficial!

**Overall Average**: 8.254 **// Average Controversy:** 1.783

TiltControls: I know that the MRG hosts were having trouble picking their AS picks, but I can definitely say they made the perfect choice in the end with what they had to choose from. Great to see the glow up coming from Up-and-coming in AS4 (both Doja and Megan had early exits there)

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): y'all better not do these women dirty like in previous AS

**cremeebrulee** (10.000): love you akane <3 we slayed that

**akanewasright** (10.000): the way I had like. No choices about what to send here. Like it was literally songs we’d already rated, Megan Thee Stallion songs, and then streets. And I didn’t want to send streets and see it get massacred! But I had no choice!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.950): Looking at my scores, perhaps I also should've done this rate. Ah, well. Doesn't stop me from listening to the records now

**ricki** (9.500): im still upset savage remix won this rate zzz

**DirtyRat583** (9.500): okaayyy jamie lee curtis picture

**vayyiqra** (9.000): fun times

**plastichaxan** (9.000): Rap girls rates are always so fun I loved this one

**dream\_fighter2018** (8.500): I did this rate while I was in the trenches with COVID, so any score discrepancies can be explained by that ❤️

**Stryxen** (8.500): condragulations Rules

**ImADudeDuh** (8.500): Megan and Cardi 😍

**IIIHenryIII** (8.500): who saw Savage winning? Honestly, not me. I thought everybody was over that song.

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.050): y'all are not ready to admit that megan and doja make extremely attachable 6.9/10s that aren't real album statements as Cardi B puts in the work and makes 9.6/10 album level statements. the bardi/slutties gang STAYS losing here though.

**Roxieloxie** (7.000): I did my ballot for this rate on my phone while in line voting for the midterms

**flava** (9.5): so I didn’t see this coming, I don’t think tilt saw this coming, I don’t think really anyone saw this coming. In its original rate I believe this came 4th, behind the song right above it in the ballot. If I remember correctly this first started winning right after My High dropped from 1st, around ballot 25 or so. And then it spent most of the time on top of the rate until the last few weeks where it got challenged by what eventually formed our top 3, never leaving the top 3. And eventually snatching the win from the last ballot. It’s an amazing song, and Genesis seems like an amazing artist with a creativity that will probably help him make loads of other great albums.

**TiltControls** (9.2): I know last year we had a pretty surprising All Stars winner but I don’t think anything’s going to ever match this. A relatively unknown artist, male vocals, a rate that didn’t have a ton of participants; it really could’ve gone all wrong. And yet Genesis held the top spot for nearly the entire rate. Near the end Charli (and then also Megan) caught up and almost snatched the rate win, but a final ballot (which was actually received a bit earlier but was just missing a score) rocketed Genesis back up to the top spot. It’s an odd way to end the rate, but an amazing one for sure.

**Awkward\_King** (10): bark bark ig

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Slay but also this should be Don’t Need You.

**camerinian** (10): I'm going to Genesis Owusu's live show after day one of this reveal and I swear to God my ticket's gonna get voided if I have to deliver the news to him that this got eliminated

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i’ll never understand how this came out as the agreed upon favorite track, like i love it but it’s not the one i jump to as ‘yes this is the highlight’

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the only real pop star

**DirtyRat583** (10): "trance right" sounds like "trans rights" and i was gonna be like so true genesis

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): you’re number one in my heart <3

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the things this song does to my body mirror the things that I would allow Genesis to do to my body

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ME WHEN IM THE SMASHA

**intheaftermath** (10): oh this is INSANELY good

**plastichaxan** (10): This song gives me such a rush very few songs do wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): genesis is so cunt (I can say that since he's australian)

**Roxieloxie** (10): the best song ever made

**runaway3212** (10): this album was my favourite that we rated last year

**Stryxen** (10): TWERK BLEGGGGGHHHHHHH

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the chorus. enough said

**thedoctordances1940** (10): what's the canine equivalent of purr yass slay

**throwaway-7650** (10): god I really need to stream these 2

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The way I tried to do this rate but gave up when I realized the only songs I liked were Genesis Owusu’s

**welcome2thejam** (10): SO glad we got to sneak this into a popheads rate, might be my favorite album of the last few years

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): very cool

**dreamingpastel** (9.5): Fun beat and synths!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): [jots down another record that I'm mad I forgot to listen to back when it came out]

**imbaby122** (9.3): i love songs that make me feel like i’m spiraling. like i genuinely feel a bit mentally unwell after listening to that.

**Memezaharamole** (9): one of the biggest robberies in Triple J Hottest 100 history

**Nagisoid** (9): The instrumental kinda reminds me of an After Laughter track. It's pretty good and catchy, and post-punky hip hop is like crack to me.

**qazz23** (9): this is strangely catchy and has nice synths and bass, good variation in vocal delivery too

**timothy444** (9): This is fun rap and also a fire rap

**anothertown** (8): "i thought it was fun i liked the beat" but unironically

**daythreeinmiami** (8): When this song transitioned, I thought ‘Ruin the Friendship’ by Demi Lovato made it on to the rate. Whilst slightly disappointed it wasn’t, still really enjoyed this song. My head was bopping.

**frogaranaman** (8): do you think Owusu was jumping around the studio when recording the studio because it sure sounds like it

**vayyiqra** (8): This album's cover frightens me but good song!

**jman457** (7.7): It was fun, but nothing too special

**NotWith10000Men** (6.6): it's interesting

**Overall Average**: 8.387 **// Average Controversy:** 1.817

TiltControls: And so we have our winning rate! A little surprised (though 100% glad) that it did so well, as some of these high average low participant rates can drop quite a bit once the larger raterbase scores them in Winners/All Stars, but MAHH managed to hold firm! Congrats to steel and sufjan for the win for your rate!

=====

FlavaSavaVandal: Hey guys, thanks for coming to our little reveal.

I'll be honest and tell you that I was terrified with the prospect of hosting this rate (even with one of the most experienced and slayest cohost I could have). Especially at the start of this year where I felt like I was as big as loser as any song (well i guess 63 songs now) in the rate.

But like with 70s Soul in December 2021, this final week has been a blast (although a significantly more stressful one). And I had such an incredible time making these custom shitposts for y'all, working with Tilt to fine tune the reveal into something special for all you to make the pain worth it. I'm glad Genesis won out in the end though, that was a twist me and TIlt didn't see coming, but one we were more than happy to deliver. 

# AND BEFORE I SIGN OFF LEMME GIVE OUT ONE LAST HUGE SHOUTOUT AND THANK YOU TO /u/tiltcontrols for being an incredible cohost. 

I could not have done this reveal without him!!!!

welcome2thejam: Rate winner Genesis Owusu feels so good to say omg. Easily one of my favorite albums ever rated, I saw that dude in a small venue last year, and now he's beat some of the biggest names in music. I can't believe it, I'm Kevin Garnett Anything Is Possible-ing so hard rn

Anyway, enormous thanks to Tilt & Flav, you two created some incredible content in the videos and banners, rest up! You've earned it!

TiltControls: yes i host but did you know i do stats on the side?

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates! 

#**Songs**

This rate was a rollercoaster truly. Huge congrats to **Genesis Owusu** for the rate win - especially since Flava and I saw pretty much no one guessing that he would pull a win off. 

* **The Other Black Dog** places 871th out of all songs rated on the sub.
 * It sits below Little Mix - Secret Love Song Pt. II and above TWICE - FANCY (the first time we rated it)
 * Though the average for the winner was low, it's not the lowest. It sits as the 8th lowest across all winners - placed right between Slumber Party and Supercut

* The difference between **The Other Black Dog** and **Girls in the Hood** becomes the smallest difference between a rate winner and its runner up (in total points and average).
 * Previously the record was held by **Ex-Factor** vs. **Doo Wop**, which has its own storied history
 * Actually the difference between 1st and 4th was also the smallest in rate history


Other songfacts

- **Biggest AS6 Flop**
 - Alaska - Your Makeup Is Terrible: -1.943 drop

- **Biggest AS6 Glow Up**
 - Ava Max - So Am I: +0.072 gain
 - So Am I was the only song to gain any points for its original rating
 - For smallest drops, Miss Movin On only fell from its original rating by 0.260

#**Artists**

Not going to bother with the adjacent placements since this list is already way too long. Also some of these artists have been rated enough where single songs won't shift them much

**Artist Shifts**

Note there's only one more addition to the artists (Sofia Carson) and near the bottom of the list too, so most of these shifts are due to their performances in the rate. Rankings out of 352

**NR** = Not previously ranked (due to not having enough songs)

Artist Notes:

* Alaska Thunderfuck loses her (small) no 0 streak. She will get a note on the historic tracker, however

* Charli joins Beyonce, Nicki Minaj, and The Weeknd at 21 rate appearances to become the 2nd most rated artists on the sub. Ariana still has the lead with 22
 * Charli also continues her race with Nicki for longest rate loss streak at 21 a piece

* **Genesis Owusu** becomes the first solo male to win an All Stars / Winners rate!
 * ABBA get a sidenote for having men in the band

#**Rate**

* With only a single person not giving out an 11, **All Stars 6** gets on the list for most 11s used! 99.02% of participants used one, which puts it in 8th overall for that stat (The top 5 are all at 100% 11 usage)

* With 84.31% of participants in the rate giving out their 0, this rate becomes the one with the 4th most 0s used (by percent!). Its the only All Stars/Winners rate on the list (which is currently mostly made up of, and led by, Billboard rates. 

Against the other 5 All Stars:

* This one is **2nd** highest controversy (AS4 has it beat)

* This one is **5th** for highest score (it beats AS4)
