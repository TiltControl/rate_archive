# [DO SONGENIALITY](https://forms.gle/uzZhTz7uHXewYRET8)

We are your hosts /u/Flavasavavandal and /u/TiltControls welcome to All Stars 6 Rate Reveal Day 2…

[Anyways this is your monthly reminder that Charli XCX has not a won a rate before](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1050753779726819409/1079122911073415189/picture_for_day_2.png)

After yesterday's round of ~~horrid eliminations~~ shenanigans ~~we are back to traumatise~~ we had to give you an extra hour of downtime to prepare yourself for the second worst day of the year (the worst comes tomorrow). Today we will be revealing #43 - #22 starting at 9pm GMT or an hour after this post goes up. I hope to see you in the [queup room](https://www.queup.net/join/losers-6) for the event of your life. If you are new the way things usually work in the queup room it usually goes "a hint to a song ---> song itself ---> slay interlude". 

I'm sure you have loads of questions, like how is drag rate still in, how is unreleased still in and how the fuck is Rock Lobster still in? We don't have any answers though, but tune in and you may find out

FlavaSavaVandal: # For the quarterfinals of the flops, we pitted and 45 of you participated in this:

1. Cardi B - I Like It vs The Weeknd - High for This
2. Chvrches - Asking For a Friend vs Doja Cat - Get Into It (Yuh)
3. Closer JPN vs Wii Sports - Wii Sports Theme
4. Eve - Let Me Blow Ya Mind vs Little Simz - Woman

in a thrilling battle, but only 4 songs could progress to our semi-finals and here they are:

**Matchup 1:**

>![Misandry won out, big time as High For This falls very short with about 33% of the votes and I Like It smashes through with 2/3rds of the votes (probably to make up for what you did yesterday to rateggaeton](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1079115005242384424/Match_1.JPG)!<

**Matchup 2:** 

>![we pitted Doja Cat against Chvrches and this was our closest matchup yet, separated by **1 vote**. I'm sure some of you will be sad to learn that the Scottish synthpop trio managed to win though](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078461438751940649/1079111376368312431/Match_2.JPG)!<

**Matchup 3:**

>![in another close matchup we pitted the more meme-y picks against each other and Tilt tried to strangle me for doing so but luckily I survived. Anyways despite Tilt's attempts to rig the vote, Wii Sport Theme falls short by 3 votes](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078461438751940649/1079111479921483846/SPOILER_match_3.JPG)!<

**Matchup 4:** 

>![In a similar fashion to how round 1 went, one song got 2/3rds of the votes, while the other got 1/3rd. I wish I could say were winners, but unfortunately Let Me Blow Ya Mind fails to move on](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1079115005452112042/match_4.JPG)!<

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (7.5): I mean i guess it wins out on being the best song sent from this rate by default, this doesn’t really excite me and sounds like the kinda safe and unexciting pick that probably could’ve left yesterday, or I’m still salty about Me and Michael not making day 2 and I’m taking it out on KEY

**TiltControls** (6): Welcome to day 2! Although the Kpop host picks had a safe day yesterday, that apparently couldn’t carry on any longer. I don’t really have anything I dislike about this song, I just don’t really have anything I like about it either.

---

**bogo** (11): if you ask me this is probably the most robbed song of the past year in rates. key's vocals are phenomenal and every second of the song is immaculately produced and a blast to listen to. the members of shinee can do no wrong

**shipperondeck** (11): shouldve won its rate. AND THIS RATE TOO!

**1998tweety** (10): hot gay kingie with hot gay bops

**akanewasright** (10): yeah

**bigbigbee** (10): there was a variety show that SHINee did back in 2013 (10 years ago :D) called One Fine Day, where each member took an international vacation by themself. Key went to London, and one of the sequences was him staying in some hostel and asking other confused guests, “hi…have you heard of kay pawp?” anyway now if I ever ask someone if they’ve heard of k-pop, I am in fact referencing that video

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): rectifying my bad score - this grew on me so much since its original rate

**ignitethephoenix** (10): KING ATE

**ImADudeDuh** (10): republicans when they see gay people existing

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): key really excels with this kind of concept/music imo

**ricki** (10): there’s nothing i want more in life rn than to be able to sit down with key for drinks and let him tell me everything that’s going on at sm right now

**sarcasticsobs** (10): [Me]: “I think I’m finally over 80’s synthwave pastiche.” [This song comes out]: “Okay, maybe a little more would be fine, I guess”. This is indeed a 9+ but I'm giving this a 10 pretending that this is "UNNATURAL" by WJSN (Fuck "The Feels" (Yeah, I gave that an 8, I did this to myself))

**shhhneak** (10): Is it actually good or is it just synthwave?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ever since i learned key is (most likely) gay everything made so much more sense to me. no straight person could make a song this good

**thedoctordances1940** (10): So when are we gonna admit that this should've won the rate, misandry is a very real problem that needs to be addressed immediately

**throwaway-7650** (10): don't make me regret #WJSN_OUT justice for pantomime!

**vayyiqra** (10): dude rocks total banger yes 80s synth is a cliché don't care it fucks

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): This is really great wow

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.8): OK y'all were right this bangs

**jman457** (9.3): Wait this bops, even if its Weekend Pastiche of MJ pastiche

**daythreeinmiami** (9): Okay I’m kind of obsessed with this.

**camerinian** (8.5): vibed HARD with this, late night city highway energy through and through

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): started off eh but then it was like okay wait yeah

**MagiKiwi29** (8.1): One of my favorite twinks

**impla77** (8): I just think a song about being unbothered is inherently an oxymoron but still a bop

**jasannn** (8): its a kpop retro song. solid 8 but I don’t think about it.

**timothy444** (8): Honestly feels like a mixture of a Weeknd song, an Ava Max song, and a Kim Petras song all rolled into a k-pop bop. I mean this song is not as good as the three former artists I just mentioned but it's listenable and releases happy chemicals in my brain

**welcome2thejam** (8): His voice pops nicely in the chorus

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.7): this'd be tight at an h&m epic big boy shit

**imbaby122** (7.5): that’s not the weeknd that’s the weekdy

**slimboyfriend** (7.1): why did I think this was one of the drag rate songs from the first few seconds

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): why did he de-yassify the cover art of WJSN - HAPPY MOMENT (1)?

**CrimsonROSET** (6): have you tried bland love

**LesApfels** (6): I'm so conflicted because the chorus sucks but the pre-chorus is heavenly

**Stryxen** (6): ok I was maybe a little TOO mean to this the first time. I still don't care for this much tho

**anothertown** (5): wilhelm scream ass

**frogaranaman** (5): Kavinsky vibes on the production

**IIIHenryIII** (5): bad score

**Nagisoid** (5): They're bad at love. I literally have no comment here, it's just a run of the mill k-pop song that I have nothing bad or good to say.

**pig-serpent** (5): Yeah, it's synthwave alright.

**plastichaxan** (5): I personally think it’s more like mid love

**runaway3212** (4): changing my opinion on gay people as we speak

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): the weeknd should have to pay for his irreperable damage to kpop music the past three years

**cremeebrulee** (2): is he not singing over the literal instrumental of the kahoot theme 80s version

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Beep beep!

**bogo** (10): joining the army of people demanding for this to be released, it's too good to remain in the vault

**camerinian** (10): Charli saying "OK fine I'll fucking play Taxi" during Square Garden was no joke the highlight of lockdown

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I can’t remember what I scored this in the Unreleased Songs rate but this song fucking slaps. Charli should really just release an album of just all her unreleased songs. Just so they can be on spotify. It’s a crime this was never released.

**DirtyRat583** (10): if i was charli i would release all of xcx world except taxi. it would be so funny

**hikk** (10): it's not my fault this lost!!!!

**imbaby122** (10): still not the correct version of taxi. will still be rating it as if it’s the good version.

**plastichaxan** (10): The more I listen to this the more I realize why the gays love her, even if I prefer other Charli unreleased

**RandomHypnotica** (10): charli losing 2 all but certain rate wins in a row is a shakespearean tragedy

**ricki** (10): one of the few times where ive gotten the charli hype

**Roxieloxie** (10): [2] track 10

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Still laugh that she plays this as intermissions during her shows and that she had to ask for a link to the leaks in order to do so

**Stryxen** (10): YASSSSSS

**pig-serpent** (9.5): Pretty much only held back by its demo level audio quality. I'm very much expecting her to randomly drop this in 2035.

**Nagisoid** (9): The lore around this song is probably bigger and better than the song itself, which is saying something because this is still extremely good. It's clearly not fully finished, but what we got is almost perfect and if completely developed would probably be her best track.

**timothy444** (9): She or her label needs to release this officially because this feels sounds completely finished and ready for release. I don't know what's stopping them but I can see a guaranteed hit on their hands.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i feel inclined to be generous to this after LQgate

**vayyiqra** (9): overrated banger

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): double check the version you’re listening to i guess lmao

**Frajer** (8): her playing this between sets at the Crash tour was so iconic

**just\_thonking** (8): unfortunately this was definitely robbed by the LQ version

**lexiaredery** (8): I keep going back and forth with this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): its a fun song but i still have no idea why this is like...the most popular leaked song of all time for popheads its literally just an average charli xcx song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): why does it sound like when you drink a potion in runescape in the background

**welcome2thejam** (8): It's not that ya-ya-ya-ya-ya song from Crazy Taxi but it'll do in a pinch

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): attempting to be fair and honest but I do truly love this song

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): she’s a cute grower

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): The combination of taxi sounds and bubble noises makes me feel like I'm playing Spongebob Battle for Bikini Bottom

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): come to my party would've beat madeon lbr

**jman457** (7.4): I’ll admit the charli fandom overhypes this

**babadork** (7.3): I wasn’t expecting this to be my favorite of Charli’s songs in this rate, but I guess it is even if I don’t like the bubbles.

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this could’ve been the third best song on Pop 2

**frogaranaman** (7): https://twitter.com/maryymagdalenee/status/1612929163085901825

**IIIHenryIII** (7): does Charli have an automobile fetish or something? If you have, I bet you’ll enjoy Titane (2021)

**nt96** (7): Taxi you will be streamed

**oscarbrierley1** (7): its fun, but i dont understand why it became such a thing.

**runaway3212** (7): deserves its flowers but not too many

**intheaftermath** (6.5): one day i will get the hype behind charli but today isn't that day

**impla77** (6.3): I thought this was like the Jesus of unreleased songs.. its fine I guess

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): love it or hate it a very impactful song

**bluehxrizon** (5): its time to let go and find peace.

**seanderlust** (4): i think i liked this more in the context of the unreleased rate...out of context this just feels unfinished. i like the hyperpop-meets-sucker-era-charli feel but the lyrics are a bit missing for me.

**MagiKiwi29** (3.7): felt like a taxi crashing into my head

**heysoupie** (3): the bubbling noises make me feel nauseated

**shhhneak** (3): https://i.redd.it/46ckg55g0pi61.jpg

**throwaway-7650** (3): yeah no TK really set her up (I still don't like this though)

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): sure whatever

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): the discord notification sound was a jump scare

**ImADudeDuh** (1): garbage song

FlavaSavaVandal: # Unreleased Songs

---

**Overall Average**: 7.191 **// Average Controversy:** 2.848

---

TiltControls: I still wish we got Mashups, but I can’t be too mad at a rate that gave a Madeon rate win.

flava: A lot of people like to shit on this rate (mostly because they wanted something else in its place, but I think that’s a tad unfair, the reveal was chaotic as fuck, I discovered an unreleased lady gaga song that got covered by Tik Tok’s Ava Max who also didn’t release it and Literal Legend is fantastic even if it took a while to grow on me. So idk this rate was fine

**ricki** (10.000): the way all of these songs deserved to win 10 times more than fadeon

**plastichaxan** (10.000): Now this is real music, all 3 picks are modern classics yup yup

**Stryxen** (10.000): condragulations ass 2 ass

**DirtyRat583** (9.333): i hope this rate was promoed on lanaboards bc why else would u do it

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.300): justice for Steely Dan - The Second Arrangement

**throwaway-7650** (8.000): no mashup bashup was worth it for this rate's lore

**IIIHenryIII** (8.000): I have to stop missing deadlines

**vayyiqra** (6.333): wild rate

**ImADudeDuh** (6.333): My favorite part of this rate was that everyone hated that this as soon as it was voted in.

**fadedblue09** (6.000): I had low expectations for this rate and they were met. The Addison songs slayed though

**Roxieloxie** (4.000): [2] my cyperpop comment

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (10): one day i will say rate winner ludacris and it will be great, that day should’ve been last month though 

**TiltControls** (7.5): It’s alright, but I think any other of Trina’s songs that performed well would’ve gotten closer to a 9 from me. Though let’s not speak of the music video

---

**akanewasright** (10): I WANT MY ASS SMACKED (LEGS WIDE) FRONT BACK (SIDE TO SIDE) PUSSY WET (SLIP N SLIDE)

**babadork** (10): I’m worried this will get robbed.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Ludacris is like the Mozart of rap features but better.

**bogo** (10): we need ludacris back he always goes off

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ludacris got a 10 average from me in that rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Kinda surprised that “Hustlin’” isn’t here but I can’t argue with this song either

**jsonphile** (10): Ludacris says “ooo eee walla walla bing bang” how can I not love this song??

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): all ludacris did was show up on some bad bitch songs and deliver a slay verse then go home like we need him back so bad

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the fart outsold all your favs

**throwaway-7650** (10): I would've sent hustling but this is still a 10

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): woah it's noted fast and furious legend ludacris! woah this is a sick psychedelic beat based off of other music traditions! woah women can rap better than men!

**Stryxen** (9.2): HORNY 💜

**Frajer** (9): love me some Luda horny bops

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I wish I loved Trina’s voice more cause everything else about this song is so good

**phonethephoenix** (9): great delivery and drums

**pig-serpent** (9): Man, I love Luda, and he's the perfect man for the call and response going on in this chorus. The beat is on point too, which is always nice.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Vocal mixing on the chorus could've been better, but other than that this is a fuckin supreme tune

**qazz23** (9): the beats here are amazing

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): not the witch doctor

**03O9** (8.5): cupcakke with better production

**anothertown** (8.5): the game is mine!! 2003!! fuck that!!!

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): you can probably make a scale of wholesomeness based on songs titled 'be alright' with this on one end and ariana's on the other

**jman457** (8.4): sorry im a slut for strings

**1998tweety** (8): cupcakke's mother

**bigbigbee** (8): It’s so painful that, for this era of delightfully saucy music, if you want to watch the MV, you have to put up with the clean version

**IIIHenryIII** (8): thanks for the imagery

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): not the lotus sutra

**plastichaxan** (8): It’s no Hustling but she still ate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): top 2 moments of this song: 1) the violin going off through the entire runtime 2) ludacris singing the witch doctor theme

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.9): I find it so funny how to me at least it seems like music in general gets dirtier or raunchier as I get older, but then I listen to stuff from when I was a baby and… nah, it's always been like that

**shhhneak** (7.6): Florence Welch type background vocals.

**DirtyRat583** (7.5): "oo ee walla walla bing bang" ????????

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): this has a woman and a man being sexual with each other so this will definitely leave day 1.

**imbaby122** (7.3): oh my god i was about to say alvin and the chipmunks reference because i fully believed that they sang the original oo ee oo ah ah song. thank god i checked google.

**dreamingpastel** (7): Longest outro ever, but go off

**frogaranaman** (7): no dick is THAT good

**Nagisoid** (7): I THOUGHT THIS WAS ALEJANDRO IN THE INTRO. I love the strings here and the flow + lyrics are kinda giving Cupcakke.

**runaway3212** (7): Trina girl it’s going down

**seanderlust** (7): great song but we needed the audience to vote for Hustlin'!

**shipperondeck** (7): the ending really makes this

**welcome2thejam** (7): Any song can be improved by a Ludacris feature it's simply science

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): dont perceive the video

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the chorus is annoyingly repetitive, but the beat is nice.

**timothy444** (6): Why does Trina sound like Lady from the Yankin' song? And better yet, why aren't we rating Yankin' which is miles better than this

**daythreeinmiami** (5): This wasn’t available in my country’s Spotify, so I had the pleasure of watching the video. It was hands down the one of the most 2000’s thing I have ever witnessed. I also had no idea women were keeping it WAP since the early 2000’s. Love that. This must have been

**ricki** (5): lady gaga - alejandro

**intheaftermath** (4): too long and repetitive for me. just couldn't get into this

**Memezaharamole** (4): this isn't available on Australian Spotify so had to watch the YouTube video. The fart joke in it just really took me out of the moment, and that beat switch seemed so short.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): I know what they're goin' for but this kind of song topic is something I personally can't handle. Beat and performance are good, though

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (10): thank you thank you thank you Bul and Rina for sending this criminally robbed band to AS6 so they can get robbed again, although surprisingly making it to day 2. It hasn’t done that well though which is sad, but fun fact if it wasn’t for my cohostie this would’ve had a 10 average for the first 6 or so ballots. Ok but onto the actual song, this is just such a legendary camp song, from the vocal effects to the fact that this song is as far as i can, just about seeing a rock lobster, and it’s a ton of fun, it is a bit long, but I’ve never let longsongphobia stop me from enjoying music before

**TiltControls** (1): I was too kind to this in NWG and I gave it a 3

---

**bulforster** (11): What could go wrong 11ing a song I love from one of my favourite bands? Not like I've done this before and had a front row seat to the disaster 😌

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): welcome to my island, there’s a rock lobster, hope you enjoy it, because he’s dragging you under (pretend I said something profound about why this song rules)

**qazz23** (11): really fun and those synth lines are crazy good

**1998tweety** (10): i just realized that one Panic! song samples this

**akanewasright** (10): YASSSSS

**anothertown** (10): john mulaney owes fred schneider everything

**babadork** (10): I’m not ready for this subreddit to rob The B-52’s again already.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): God I love this. It makes me feel like I’m going surfing with a group of sheet ghosts.

**bluehxrizon** (10): the origins of camp

**bogo** (10): thanks to brendon urie the beginning of this song is now a jumpscare

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): most influential song of all time so true!!!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): campest song in existence along with Crab Rave

**heysoupie** (10): iconic bass line

**IIIHenryIII** (10): STOP LOBSTERS CONSUMPTION

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this was fighting for gay rights

**impla77** (10): not me thinking fob samples this when its actually patd!🫠

**jsonphile** (10): y’all are gonna do this song so dirty I fear

**Nagisoid** (10): If this song does not make you dance then you are probably dead. Very quirky but in a good way.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is kinda the best song ever and it made me aware of my talent of imitating the weird animal noises here what’s not to love

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can't believe they sampled Don't Threaten Me With A Good Time by Panic! At The Disco

**runaway3212** (10): this song is so exciting

**seanderlust** (10): rock lobster by the b-52s and doritos and fritos by 100 gecs have the exact same appeal send tweet

**shhhneak** (10): I don’t know why I always recall this song as a nursery rhyme when it’s kind of scary. VOTE FOR THE HALLOWEEN RATE (in 8 months)

**shipperondeck** (10): i dont care. this is peak

**slimboyfriend** (10): bitches say they love camp but then don’t get the B-52’s

**Stryxen** (10): I seriously can't think of a more iconic song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): im not kidding when i say if you hate this song youre probably homophobic

**thedoctordances1940** (10): this is what kkb think they're doing^citation ^desperately ^needed

**vayyiqra** (10): 🤪

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): look i said it before: the kids in athens just wanted to do something really crazy with their nights. a couple of these folks had seen europe. they understood there was another world out there. and athens, ga was so goddamn cheap you could buy a week's worth of dresses or suits for cheaper than doing laundry at the end of the 70s. the art kids fucked each other and liked to party. rock lobster HAD to happen here at this time in this moment of late 70s small town if anywhere what a bawpper.

**phonethephoenix** (9.6): somehow always forget that rock lobster is six minutes long but it's so iconic

**Frajer** (9.5): I could listen to Kate and Cindy making weird animal noises for hours and Fred Schneider will always be famous

**pig-serpent** (9.5): Sometimes "camp" just means "good"

**intheaftermath** (9): my mom made me dress up as a lobster for a parade one year and followed me for two miles playing this song on loop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): this one is unashamedly camp

**ricki** (9): rock lobster? i hardly know her!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Every time I listen to this it shocks me all over again that it's seven minutes in length. Some parts of this feels like thirty years have passed by, but hell if it still ain't great

**camerinian** (8): show me a more quirked up white boy with a little bit of swag in this rate than Fred, I dare you

**ignitethephoenix** (8): like this song but it’s not one of my faves here

**musical\_pyn** (8): All music should be this. I don't mean that every song should sound like this or just have b-52s influences, I mean that every song should just be replaced by the b-52s #1 canadian hit "Rock Lobster"

**timothy444** (8): Good classic and iconic song but why is this over six minutes long?

**imbaby122** (7.8): gibberish music is so fun and silly like why are we singing about a lobster and making goofy noises lol.

**jman457** (7.3): This song annoys me just slightest bit

**Uberpigeon** (7): hearing that guitar riff after doing 3mo sent a shock through my system

**MagiKiwi29** (6.8): way too long I'm sorry

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Sorry, does not much too for me [dodges, ducks, dips, dives, and dodges], except the end is fun and gets it some bonus points

**dreamingpastel** (6): Old McDonald had a farm under the sea

**LesApfels** (6): It's 7 minutes long?!?

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.8): I still don't know what the hell this is

**Birdseeding** (5): God, this wears out of welcome. Would be 7 at 3 minutes

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): cute Panic At The Disco sample

**Memezaharamole** (4): stresses me out, feel like the lobster is chasing me.

**Roxieloxie** (4): I dont hate this but it just goes on for so long, is what i basically said when we first rated this and I feel the same pretty much. Im hosting 3mo right now and by the time this rate will reveal it'll be over but this song is currently enabling everyone to be annoying in the results. Also I just looked over and the curent average is a 6.666 so enjoy that knowledge

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): and if i say that don’t threaten me with a good time is better than this then i’m the bad guy

**Awkward\_King** (2): gonna go listen to panic! instead

**daythreeinmiami** (2): This was an experience.

**DirtyRat583** (2): the guitar is the only good part of this

**lexiaredery** (2): I really don't like the vocals

**frogaranaman** (1): I’m tired

**NotWith10000Men** (1): this got FOURTH PLACE?

**throwaway-7650** (1): ...so this is what KKB antis think they sound like

**CrimsonROSET** (0): you know i thought i just didn’t see the vision during new wave giants but then i realized i liked all of the other albums in that rate way more so i think the vision just isn’t there for me

**hikk** (0): ............ brendon urie cleared

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (10): Though I think I gave Your Name a 10 anyways, I was really hoping this would win. Even if it was just for Lemon

**flava** (3.5): yeah lemon’s verse grew on me, not enough to save this song from a low score though

---

**1998tweety** (10): my Canadian queens ATE

**akanewasright** (10): YASSS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This should have been my third eleven win! It really should have!

**bluehxrizon** (10): gloss on the blunt aint sorry its fenty

**cremeebrulee** (10): they gotta retroactively credit this to lemon, it's really unfair otherwise

**CrimsonROSET** (10): king pointing out how bad lemon’s wig was oh he’s evil

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this song transcends drag music

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): toronto… ah ah

**hikk** (10): toronto.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a winner and a first out (lemon on All Stars 9 and Priyanka in All Winners 3)

**plastichaxan** (10): Gay classic cured my homophobia

**qazz23** (10): i like this infectious, dancey sound

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I don't think I will ever get over this losing, this is the closest I will ever get to feeling the pain that drag race fans feel about the show

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Canadian icons!!

**Stryxen** (10): SLAYANKA AND SLEMON

**throwaway-7650** (10): king to raters after this made AS6

**Uberpigeon** (10): Don't ❌ even 🤷‍♀️ have 🈶 to ask 🙏 for 🈺 it for 🤔🎅 me ✨ to get 🉐 it When 🔜 you 😀 see 👀 my 🎂 ass 💋😂 in 👏 this, I 👈 charge ⚡ credit 💳 Your 👈🏼 dad 👨 drops 😲😲 stacks 📷 on ⬇️ this and don't 👎 forget 👋🏾 it He's 👨 tryna 😈 find 🤔🧐 my 🏿 pussy 😍👌 pics 💩📱🤳📷 up 📷 on 🔛 Reddit 👽 Gloss on 👥⬅️💡 the blunt, ain't 💀 sorry 💔 it's Fenty Don't ✋ mean 😏 to stunt but 🤙 we 👧👦 stuntin', plenty 👍 End 🔚 of the night 🌙 and your 👉 bank 💹 account 💳 empty Yeah, 🙋 LemYanka own 🗣️🍼 2020 📅⏲️ It's like 💑 BFF 👯 necklace, 📿 VIP ⭕🔶🔹🔴🔷🔸 guest list 🥵 Leavin' boys 👩‍👦‍👦 breathless when ⏰ we 😀👦 get 🔟🚀 reckless Smile 😎 is infectious, roll 🙄 up 🆙 in 🚪🏼 a Lexus Me 😳 and my 🏿😤 girl 💁🏼‍♀️ come 📷 through, 🪀 let's 🤝 get 2️⃣0️⃣ this

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): intro is an 11; like this legit has insane 30 rock energy oozing out. i was dyin. sorta shocked it went to 2 but also, rock on.

**daythreeinmiami** (9.5): DELETE IT. BLOCKED. SUCK A COCK.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): bop we love a desi queen

**intheaftermath** (9): unexpectedly fun!

**jasannn** (9): this is just oopsie my bad by Nature

**sarcasticsobs** (9): This beat is very fun, good attitude from the performers

**seanderlust** (9): lemon went off on this

**shhhneak** (9): The way that Pri and Lemon probably have better rate averages than another certain Toronto name-dropping rapper.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): its true, i'm your dad looking for Lemon's pussy pics on this website

**welcome2thejam** (9): I can divide my life into B.L.V. (Before Lemon's Verse) and A.L.V. (After Lemon's Verse)

**Memezaharamole** (8.9): Lemon's rap is the drag equivalent of Nicki Minaj on Monster; iconique.

**shipperondeck** (8.9): this was extremely fun omg

**phonethephoenix** (8.8): work!

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this song did come through

**Roxieloxie** (8): I didnt do this rate and yet i've heard the first 2 minutes and the first 3 minutes of this music video at least 7 times just because of the reveal

**vayyiqra** (8): TORONTO ?! that city is not real

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): honestly almost sounds like an actual song alongside these actual songs

**camerinian** (7.5): terrible chorus. Just an objectively bad job by everyone here. My score does not reflect that for a reason

**anothertown** (7): would have smashed with the greater online community 10 years ago especially the dorian corey quote

**Birdseeding** (7): Lemon's verse is the best thing ever to appear in a Drag Race-adjacent song, so surprisingly tight

**heysoupie** (7): i have never listened to drag race music but this is much better than what i was expecting. I still suspect that i don’t love this genre but, i didn’t hate this.

**imbaby122** (7): there are so many buzzwords packed into this song to appeal to me specifically. toronto, pussy, reddit, fenty gloss, blunt.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): so true

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): the more i listen the less i like it tbh, like the first listen hits like a sledgehammer and then after that its like....cute i guess

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's werking too hard for me

**babadork** (6.4): I think this suffered the most from me not giving any points for music videos.

**Awkward\_King** (6): dont even have to ask for it for me to get it when you see my ass in this i charge credit your dad drops stacks on this and don't forget it he's tryna find my pussy pics up on reddit gloss on the blunt sorry it's fenty don't mean to stunt but we stuntin hunty end of the night and your bank account empty yeah lemyanka own 2020 its like bff necklace vip guestlist leavin boys breathless when we get reckless my laugh is infectious roll up in a lexus me and my girl come through lets get this

**Nagisoid** (6): Hey, we got a shoutout! I find the chorus funny but the rest of the song is very solid.

**oscarbrierley1** (6): lemon's verse by itself would be a ten, but the rest of the song doesn't work for me

**thedoctordances1940** (6): imagine getting outshone by a feature this bad like this would be a 10 if you replace Priyanka's verses with more Lemon

**timothy444** (6): Faced with the dillema of not liking this but also can't justify giving this lower than a 5 because yeah… it's decent enough to listen on a casual basis. Maybe not the reddit line but meh

**impla77** (5): I will say this again, Lemon’s verse is the only slay thing and its like one fifth of the song

**jman457** (5): The rap is fun, but the rest sounds like Target-core

**pig-serpent** (5): Honestly this grew off me pretty hard.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): This is basically an ITZY song. Lemon's verse is fire tho.

**NotWith10000Men** (3.9): production is annoying

**jsonphile** (3): “it’s camp” can only go so far

**WaneAllstarToc** (10.000): kinda feel like y'all did king dirty and didn't want to admit that shitty music made by drag queens rules although this all actually good music; the queens are doing good work here. the playful animosty towards drag money and the true hatred towards this boy is a bottom and the divinely awful oops i think i pooped still gut me to this day. so few of y'all would survive watching any T&E or Wonder Showzen

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (8.5): I assumed this track was bound for all the other camp submissions into an early day 1 finish. Despite that it managed to hold somewhat comfortably onto day 2. I think this track, though still very hard to take seriously, at least had a few more dynamic components to it (though my cohost may disagree).

**flava** (1): im not mad this got in, im just disappointed, it’s bad, it’s always been bad, and in spite the gaslighting it will always be bad. Kelis didn’t have the best album in Futuristic R&B but she deserved a little better, this though, this deserved day 1. In both that and this

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Congratulations! There were so many slays in this rate that I had to use a random number generator on my top eight 11 contenders, and Kelis you’re a winner baby! I am Team Camp Classic all the way!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): S-tier banger!!

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**anothertown** (10): weddings funerals.

**cremeebrulee** (10): rate winner ARRIVED

**daythreeinmiami** (10): https://youtube.com/shorts/PUX2wh_27Z4?feature=share

**DirtyRat583** (10): kelis is a gay icon (apart from the beyonce sample thing - i can look past that tho)

**fadedblue09** (10): By far the most iconic song in our rate, very glad this got in. In hindsight this should've been my host pick but I was not informed we were doing camp submissions. Glad the tasteful Popheads GP pulled through.

**Frajer** (10): I know the whole point is milkshake is general swagger and confidence but every time I'm like okay where is your milkshake girl

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Kelis being so robbed in this rate was PAINFUL to witness

**jman457** (10): Its a bop idc

**nt96** (10): Truly delicious in every step of the way. Popheads, you don’t know any better

**plastichaxan** (10): Sad to see some of y’all don’t get it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): camp classic

**shhhneak** (10): Hearing this song instantly teleports me to my elementary school playground.

**Stryxen** (10): literally so good? I will never understood the panning that occurred

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): how the fuck did this classic only get number TWELVE and then had to be voted IN like you all should be ashamed of yourselves???

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): tempted to 11 this because it was the best result from the voteins

**throwaway-7650** (10): in an ideal world trick me would be here but I'll take this

**vayyiqra** (10): I'm not explaining the appeal of this song. If you don't get it, that's not my fault.

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): an all timer; the smart gays in highschool dreamed of dressing up as a dairy queen worker on halloween so they could say "my milkshake brings all the boys to the yard". a good giggle

**akanewasright** (9.5): yeah tbh this was robbed last time

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): the only milk that ages like wine

**03O9** (9): la la, la la la

**babadork** (9): We weren’t allowed to buy this album, because my aunt thought this song was “annoying.” I might be a little bitter about it still.

**intheaftermath** (9): -1 point bc i am a lesbian (jk, obviously)

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): a classic and makes me want to go to a diner

**imbaby122** (8.8): idc if she was in the wrong i stand by kelis. beyoncé get a job! stay away from her!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): classic

**seanderlust** (8.5): i just know that one dude from there will be blood was throwing ass in the mirror to this song

**shipperondeck** (8.5): this has grown on me so much lol

**qazz23** (8): it's fun but a bit repetitive

**Roxieloxie** (8): I missed this rate but i did hear the first few tracks of this album, this is fine I dont have any strong opinions but i really wish this would've been trick me. That song was shaping up to be my 11 and i was hoping to get the chance to 11/10 it in all stars

**bogo** (7.5): ok it's grown on me. trick me still deserved the spot more though

**bluehxrizon** (7): if this was released in 2016 it wouldve been banned by popheads mods

**camerinian** (7): quick power ranking of this song's "usage in media" Wikipedia section (excluding the ones I haven't seen) - The Simpsons > Mean Girls > The Big Short > Sex Education > Dodgeball > Family Guy > South Park > The Haunted Mansion (???) > Norbit > Date Movie > 2 Broke Girls > The Glee Project (didn't actually see that one either but imagining them doing this song in any context is enough to make it the worst thing)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Not the best song in the rate but possibly the most iconic

**heysoupie** (7): did you know Kelis sells paper towels now

**jasannn** (7): the terribly sung verses and lalalala’s makes the song great but also terrible

**welcome2thejam** (7): Me and the boys getting rowdy at Kelis' bimonthly milkshake shindig

**Awkward\_King** (6): oh she ate here. wait no. delete that. oh she drank here.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the only song that might honestly do better outside its rate context

**Nagisoid** (6): I can see CupcaKKe doing something very interesting with this title. Fun, repetitive bop that was everywhere back in its time. It's kinda hypnotic, but I do not like it a lot.

**phonethephoenix** (6): I mean it is iconic

**runaway3212** (6): this song is bad but I like the fantasy of attracting men

**Memezaharamole** (5.8): hard to decide, I mean it's kinda historic, but almost feels like a schoolyard meme at this point. Wish Millionaire or Trick Me made All Stars instead

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.4): Yes I voted this in. Yes I’m giving this a 5.4. We exist.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): Never got into this tune

**dreamingpastel** (3): Every time this comes on shuffle I just think it's that one Bounty Spotify ad

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): i want to like it but the beat does not change at all

**jsonphile** (3): I’ve never liked this song. But a lot of songs that I used to not like I’ve come around on in the last couple years since I’ve been in this sub, given me more appreciation for pop music. I still hate this song though. I don’t know what anyone sees in it

**NotWith10000Men** (3): took me a while to decide but i do not like this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): what if you wanted to rate trick me but popheads said "haha meme song"

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): memeable chorus obviously but the song itself is…not good

**timothy444** (2): 2 Grab your pitchforks because I'm here to type a bunch of words on why Milkshake is a terrible song. Yeah sure, of course it's my opinion and really should not matter to anyone else but please hear me out before you start screaming at the screen:

1) The lyrics are bad. Just bad. There's no way around this one my fellow popheads. From the first chorus to the bridge, there is nothing remotely interesting or clever in those words about milkshake to the point where Kelis just provided a cop-out answer to what the word "milkshake" means by saying it's your interpretation. I mean, that's the equivalent to coming up with a lyric like "I love the smell of Sonic the Hedgehogs in the morning," which makes no sense whatsoever and is basically just a bunch of random words strung together. It's like Flo Rida's whistle but at least it was funny once you figure out what he actually means about blowing a whistle. Here it's just wtf

2) The production is so very bland as well. These days we have a lot more powerful beats and bass lines than the ones used in Milkshake. Hell, even back then they didn't sound that good to begin with. When you compare this song to something from the late 1990s like TLC's No Scrubs or Backstreet Boys' Quit Playing Games (With My Heart), you can see how much better music has gotten since then in terms of production despite those two songs still sounding decent. Milkshake by Kelis however sounds like it belongs in the 1990s even though it was released in 2003. Like yawn... get a better producer next time.

3) Kelis herself sounds like she's doing her best to not sound bored while singing these lyrics and doesn't seem to give a damn if people like it or not. And that's fine if that's how you're feeling, but don't pretend like you care when you obviously do not. If you want to be honest about the matter, it's like listening to someone talk who clearly does not believe in what she is saying. She's going through the motions and that's the most obvious thing you notice here. Just sounds lazy.


**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): insert my 0 comment for Milkshake in the original rate

**thedoctordances1940** (1): you send this and i'll just tank it again

**pig-serpent** (0): I feel like I've seen some agreement elsewhere that this is one of the worst songs ever made, and on this listen I tried to view it from the side of people who like this song, and I can almost see it. I'm glad you guys exist, but you can enjoy this over there, out of my earshot.

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (10): damn i really thought this was going to do better, this was in the top 10 at a few points early on but then it just kept on not getting the points to rise back up and that’s a shame, it’s a classic breezy bop with a beat that sounds like it was bought in Asda but that’s what makes it good

**TiltControls** (9.5): Even though a day 2 finish isn’t terrible, I really thought this was going to do better. I mean it was doing better for most of the early rate. It’s just an insanely catchy and fun song.

---

**akanewasright** (10): THE BEST SONG EVER MADE!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Just gonna recycle my comment from the rate: They’re talking about the slay button. We love being eco-friendly!

**bogo** (10): they pushed the slay button

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): inserting the tweet that the next Knives Out sequel should just feature all 84 sugababes

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Another video clip that had me snatched as a kid.

**DirtyRat583** (10): this is such a fun track. cant wait until its tanked

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): wish I could 11 this again

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The UK always serving the best girl groups

**RandomHypnotica** (10): shitty jackbox among us knockoff

**ricki** (10): me at an elevator… idk its 6am and i havent slept i cant think of any banner bait rn

**Stryxen** (10): she was ACTING

**thedoctordances1940** (10): they really pushed the slay and yass button

**throwaway-7650** (10): me begging whoever's in charge of the day 3 playlist to skip the you lose! MV when it's queued after the top 2 shitpost(s)

**vayyiqra** (10): 😳

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.1): Because cassettes flopped in the mid-00s and p4k's aoty list (but not singles!) was not exactly a vessel of telling you "this is a good pop album", I have to just sorta gut-feeling "boss baby" my way through identifying the pleasure and magic of this era's pop. its just gut feelings that this stuff is lowkey genius bliss. anyways jesus christ the sugarbabes were extremely into having a good time; everyone had fun dancing here tbh.

**camerinian** (9): who needs they button ate

**Frajer** (9): between this and Pussycat Dolls buttons were having their moment in this era

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): they gave everyone a little tune to sing whenever we push buttons in our lives and thats so beautiful

**heysoupie** (8.1): this song is kind of deranged but in a good way

**CrimsonROSET** (8): what i mean when i say we have among us at home when we have the jackbox party pack:

**impla77** (8): Maybe I shouldn’t tell other women to make the first move when I would never🫠

**plastichaxan** (8): My brain whenever I see a button that could potentially create chaos or just do nothing

**qazz23** (8): i'll push the like button for this song

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): i been droppin so many hints xox

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me when i see an imposter in among us

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.9): It sounds cheap but in a nostalgic way

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the verses are so wordy how did I not notice this until now

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): addictinggames.com ass song title

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): Oh, I actually like this more than during the original rate. Not that much though.

**anothertown** (7): me when i get stuck in the elevator

**intheaftermath** (7): sorry but girls aloud supremacy

**phonethephoenix** (7): oohhhhh

**runaway3212** (7): no please dont

**jman457** (6.8): idk, didnt move me much

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): my intrusive thoughts:

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Great hook, I just wish the instrumental had more oomph.

**timothy444** (6.5): Loved this song back in the day but now it's sorta aged. The three girls singing this (I'm too lazy to google their names) don't appear to harmonise together at times and it feels like it's stuck in the mid-2000s. Not that it's a bad thing because I guess that was the vibe back then, though if you take off your nostalgia goggles, you get a song that is very mid.

**imbaby122** (6): sounds like youtube royalty free music

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): methinks this deserved a more explosive chorus

**hikk** (5.5): the button they pushed was not the slay button i fear

**Nagisoid** (5): Forgettable, there's nothing particularly bad or good about it. Kind of female manipulator core.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): this is such a non-event of a song

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (6.5): And the poppyphobia continues for another day. I liked this in TWOE, but it grew off me a little for this rate.

**flava** (6): make sure to apologise to Poppy once again

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I missed my chance to 11 it in TWOE and I’m not missing my chance now! Got my through 2020 quarantine fr

**plastichaxan** (11): Two queens maximizing their joint slay made specifically for me wow what a moment in history

**anothertown** (10): kind of realizing this is what people wanted motomami to sound like

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Perfect 30/30 from me on representatives from this rate! Yes Ma’am!

**camerinian** (10): once the car siren community get ahold of this song it's over for all of us

**cremeebrulee** (10): why did we do arca like that wtf, this album deserved so much better

**DirtyRat583** (10): idk why but i streamed the fuck out of this last year so its my top song now and im giving it a 10 because of that

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this song cured my fear of heights (kinda). It sounds silly, but I have a really serious fear of heights. Once I got caught on one side of a bridge with no way over, and I had my headphones on so I just breathed in, put KLK on, and tried to walk. It only took me three goes but I made it over, and now I just default to KLK when I need to cross something high

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Rosalía is the queen of the alphabet

**imbaby122** (10): rothalia ran to write motomami after recording this feature so she could plagiarize while the source was still fresh in her mind

**MassiveThief** (10): just... mind altering. got me floating through the celing.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): still as timeless as ever like arca and rosalia both did what they had to do here…

**nt96** (10): I love being Spanish

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Glitchy Latin beats, fuck me UP

**throwaway-7650** (10): both this/faceshopping are 11s... I can't pick!

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): why is it that even still, at a certain level of money, a trans lady that identifies as nonbinary has to go absolutely monkey mode insane with the web 3.0 extremely online, extremely headass shit. goddamn it arca y u do this still this one slaps and i feel like is we kept letting ROSALÍA exist ethereally over insane, deranged beats she could make The Pop Album of the 2020s. every time i hear this ditty i think "i need a ROSALÍA poster in my room to replace my radiohead posters" this is a deranged thought.

**03O9** (9.5): mothers maximizing their joint slay

**bogo** (9): ass shaking at the speed of sound to this song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): caprimami333

**intheaftermath** (9): Rosalia honestly has one of the best voices in the industry right now. I don't think there's anything she can't sing.

**Nagisoid** (9): Latina queens. Bridge is kinda weak but the rest of the song is not and that synth line is addictive.

**qazz23** (9): a bit chaotic, but liking Rosalía's vocals

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): only motomamis understand :/

**jman457** (8.3): An everything and the kitchen sink song in a good way

**impla77** (8.1): I really didn’t like this when I was at the listening party.. but damn this is actually pretty great. Hopefully my opinion doesn’t flip again!

**akanewasright** (8): I feel like I should like this more than I do… but like… I still like it a lot

**phonethephoenix** (8): ohhhhh

**Roxieloxie** (8): I cannot believe this is the only 11 I gave this year that made it in. A geogessr smasha

**Stryxen** (8): :latinas:

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): poppy finding a way to ensure Rosalia is featured in as many rates as possible is always impressive

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i can’t believe tilt is gonna get to use the video of the plane flying over ROSALÍA to continue the tradition of it being used every cycle

**ricki** (7): you know what… it kinda grew on me

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Mental breakdown vibes

**Memezaharamole** (6.7): sounds more like a Rosalia sample than her in the actual booth, otherwise I do like the immediate nature of this.

**1998tweety** (6): Rosalia couldn't save this

**frogaranaman** (6): klklklklklklklklklklklkl

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): is this noise pop?

**jsonphile** (6): my unending crush on Rosalia prevents me from rating this too low but I still don’t get this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this couldve been like 2 minutes long and it wouldve been so much better

**vayyiqra** (6): Still not fully feeling the hype for Arca and likely never will but this is okay! I guess. Someone needs to tell Rosalía that more repetitive does not mean more better.

**moonagenightmares** (5): felt so much longer than it actually was

**NotWith10000Men** (4.2): i have yet to love a rosalia collab

**fadedblue09** (4): In hindsight, I kinda overscored this….I didn't really vibe with Arca's music so I had to be nice to some of her songs somehow

**timothy444** (4): Too overproduced and I can't understand a single word from it

**shhhneak** (3): This sounds a lil too boss music against a Metal Gear.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): sorry u/xophrys

**ImADudeDuh** (2): ah, so i was right. I wouldn’t like Arca’s music

**runaway3212** (2): motomami I will avenge you

**daythreeinmiami** (1): Are y’all going to cancel me if I say this is utterly terrible?

**Birdseeding** (0): Fuck cultural appropriation, fuck the white upper class Catalan and the white upper class Venezuelan benefiting from Caribbean slang without paying anything back

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (10): I know almost nothing about this game, but that doesn’t stop the prolificness of this track specifically. It’s such a joyous track that you don’t need to have played the game to enjoy it to the fullest. Though there was some talk of the original, I kind of prefer the remastered one over it. Though maybe it would’ve been a Simple and Clean scenario where it pulled off the VGI win. We may never know.

**flava** (9): rip to another rate and one my cohost hosted, it deserved better

---

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending to the moon

**anothertown** (10): a disney property really made something so affecting and buoyant, so seriously aspirational. wonders never ceasing etc!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): still probably the biggest ‘OH THS SONG’ moment i’ve had in rates

**hikk** (10): YASSSSSSSS

**Nagisoid** (10): Pure bliss. Gives the Microphones a run for their money.

**nt96** (10): I want this to play when I go out to space or else I will cancel the launch and write NASA a strongly worded letter about how dusty their music taste is.

**qazz23** (10): love how epic sounding this is, both versions are good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): its funny how a kinda mediocre disney platformer from a largely unmemorable IP has one of the most iconic songs in gaming

**Roxieloxie** (10): deserved to win idc !!!!

**runaway3212** (10): why does this go so hard

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream moonlight sunrise by twice

**timothy444** (10): Outside of the theme song, "The Moon" has got to be one of the most recognisable video game songs ever and it's pretty easy to see why. The slow build-up at the beginning followed by a cresecendo of instruments just hitting you with such a catchy melody that's sure to get stuck in your head. It's the type of music you'd want to hear when you're fighting a boss level because you'd want to die multiple times just to hear it again and again and again. It's so iconic that it's even made it on the Ducktales 2017 reboot which I highly reccommend you all watch because it's one of the best animated series ever, even better than the original. In fact, if it wasn't for Ava Max appearing in the rate, this would've been a very easy 11.

**welcome2thejam** (10): If you give this less than a five Buzz Aldrin will pop you right in the face

**camerinian** (9.5): ladies and gentlemen we are floating in space

**pig-serpent** (9.5): The drums aren't bothering me as much now ¯_(ツ)_/¯

**bigbigbee** (9): I can’t listen to this if I’m ever on the edge of a cliff or tall building, because it WILL inspire me to actually attempt to fly

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): capitalist king lmao

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this is so good it could have words

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): taking a point off bc we're not rating the (much better) original version :(

**phonethephoenix** (8.9): nice little tune!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.5): Love that they used this in the cartoon. That reminds me, I gotta keep watching it. I need to see if Mark Zuckerberg bird and Lin-Manuel Miranda bird ever get together

**daythreeinmiami** (8): why did this slam me back into 1998?

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is kinda the smasha

**imbaby122** (8): i feel so gamer girl rn omgggg

**sarcasticsobs** (8): “I closed my eyes through this whole song and imagined myself in space. I ventured on Saturn’s rings, touched the icy atmosphere of Neptune, and I saw so many unique and inspiring constellations. Music like this sparks the imagination and I love the roller coaster that our mind can take us on. I’m a Christian and things like this really emphasize the magnitude and intricacies of God’s creation and I will forever be awestruck.” - YouTube user Caleb Arledge, 3 months ago (edited)

**Uberpigeon** (8): .. this is so familiar.... ur telling me this is from a fucking ducktales game????  hang on. this.. is . is this sampled in an undertale song or something

**akanewasright** (7.5): the original is leagues better but I did too much on this last time, it’s pretty good

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is so grand and for duck tales???

**Birdseeding** (7): original is better

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Gonna have a very unique comment here and say I wish this was the original version.

**krusso1105** (7): would probably be higher if I had watched more of the new Ducktales show

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): this shit still sounds like snow halation lol

**ricki** (7): okayyyyyyyy

**Stryxen** (7): thr youtube comments are really feeling this

**jman457** (6.3): idk, felt a little one not

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): well slay i guess

**IIIHenryIII** (5): whatever

**plastichaxan** (5): I didn’t remember this I was so ready to give it a 1 but then it was fine I can’t imagine it set to Ducktales

**thedoctordances1940** (5): so many incredible and robbed songs in this rate and then this is here

**WaneAllstarToc** (4): it wasn't an all star in the og rate it's not here

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): the version akane showed me kinda outsold

FlavaSavaVandal: # Video Game Instrumentals

---

**Overall Average**: 7.563 **// Average Controversy:** 1.868

---

flava: so confession time, I had no plans to do this rate, video game music isn’t particularly my thing nor did the rate sound that interesting to me. But then I got paired to host this with Tilt and it just seemed very rude to not do his currently open rate, especially since I had been doing every other rate at the time and I didn’t want to get things off on the wrong foot

TiltControls: Day 2 was better than I was expecting so I’ll take it. This rate was so much fun to host, even if it ended up being pretty chaotic in the results. Someday we’ll need to do a VG sweep up to cover the tracks missed by VGV/VGI

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): waiting for VGI 2 + the minirate graduation!

**nt96** (10.000): this was a lot more fun than it needed to be. Certain songs were robbed (not the Mii Verse tho) but y'all ain't ready for that conversation. Would love a another game related rate one day.

**RandomHypnotica** (10.000): we need VGI/VGV 2

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.500): Justice for Celeste!!!

**Roxieloxie** (9.000): gaming

**sarcasticsobs** (8.700): Stay tuned for "Bloody Tears (Extended Version)" from Castlevania II: Simon's Quest for VGI Part Deux!!

**Stryxen** (8.500): condragulations City of tears

**fadedblue09** (8.250): I did not check the rate reveal until to this until now. I'm not sure how the rate winner sounds like, but apparently I gave it a good score

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.900): The way I manifested Mario and Sonic at the Olympic Games in the bonus rate, my power (also omg that was the best bonus rate ever good job!)

**DirtyRat583** (7.500): i mean they were instrumental what do u want me to say

**thedoctordances1940** (7.500): This is both the best and worst rate of the year. In concept this rate was such a good idea but then the results were so fucking abysmal and criminal that my bimonthly (twice a month) vow to quit rates forever lasted almost 5 minutes this time

**ImADudeDuh** (7.000): a rate i skipped

**WaneAllstarToc** (6.700): justice for halo and xboxes. popheads are not ready for the jsrf soundtrack

**vayyiqra** (5.500): Nothing against our hosts but what was even this rate, what happened in it, it made no sense to me, I have no idea, I stopped played video games routinely around 2012,

**plastichaxan** (5.000): This rate was not for me but I like to be out of my comfort zone

**IIIHenryIII** (3.500): I never played most of the games in this rate so it was best for me to step out of it to avoid another 60s Pop Rate tragedy. My scores still haunt me to this day.

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (1.5): i dont know what else to say that I didn’t say last time round, this sounds like complete garbage and Let’s Eat Grandma cannot handle this hyperpop production courtesy of SOPHIE. This sucks sorry cannibals

**TiltControls** (1): LEG better be thankful Aespa came to save the day from my 0

---

**jman457** (11): RIP Sophie, I was never so upset when it lost its original rate that i became a KKB anti.

**Memezaharamole** (11): There's something about Let's Eat Grandma that links the aural and visual for me, listening to their music is a vivid experience and I just picture the sounds

**akanewasright** (10): yes!

**anothertown** (10): i am popping my shit with boldness and immediacy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): HAWT PANK

**bogo** (10): HAWT PINK

**CrimsonROSET** (10): originally i was just gonna say ‘hot pink’ and let the song speak for itself but then people told me to just copy paste the rant again and since only acting didn’t make it i wanna talk shit about it again SO let’s talk about noise and relief! idk the technical terms for this but i’m putting ‘noise’ as tension and ‘relief’ as lack of it, for example in this song the ‘noise = tension’ comes from the hard drums, the crashing noise of glass and the weird siren in the back, they come in for the chorus that is very simple and so you can still make apart what they’re saying as more elements come in. more than that, it resolves back into smoothness, but that doesn’t mean hints of it aren’t still there. the percussion is still a good point, and the hi hat contrasts the glass shattering. more than that, the next chorus switches things up with instead a bass boosted bass and a change of verse, it’s not the same noise even if the motif of the broken glass is still there and for the third chorus once more it changes, but there is always a moment of relief (even when it goes from the second chorus straight into the third, the ‘bridge’ section serves as the relief that will draw us out to the end of the song). If you look at Only Acting, it similarly follows noise and tension rules for the first segment BUT after the first part of ‘relief’ it’s all tension until the end in varying levels- almost anxiety driven, you just want it to end and things keep coming out of nowhere and screaming in your ear that were never there before, it isn’t building or equaling out, it’s just noise. Relief only comes on the next song (which i really like) but as a stand alone, it ends in tension, in anxiety, while this one ends also building to the next song BUT with that tension fully resolved and ready to move on. It’s like if a rollercoaster where it goes up and down, but there’s always an ending period to calm your heartbeat, while Only Acting launches you to the moon and says ‘well gravity (another song) exists to bring you down so we don’t gotta do it’ anyways the point is I like Hot Pink.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): HAWT PINK! IS IT MINE IS IT!

**hikk** (10): ahm onlay seventayn ah daunt knauw wot yew mayn

**IIIHenryIII** (10): playing pink diamond after this is an out-of-body experience

**impla77** (10): IS IT MINE

**just\_thonking** (10): HAWT PENK

**lexiaredery** (10): I've been missing out for too long

**moooo566** (10): i skipped this rate, that was a mistake

**phonethephoenix** (10): SOPHIE!!! also just love the structure and delivery in general

**plastichaxan** (10): They do the HAWT PEIGHNK voice so well wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): We were never going to send this because it was by far the most controversial song in the rate, and that was in an audience of people already predisposed to enjoy it… Y'all did this to yourselves

**runaway3212** (10): we love SOPHIE

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I like their accents. HOLD UP. AT 0:46. WHAT IS GOING ON. THIS RULES

**Stryxen** (10): seriously genius. Not everyone is going to get it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): can i use this space for hyperpop rate promo also, sophie is a producer on it so i think it counts

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I will not check the results because I do not want to see this go out at 35th with a 7.431 average

**vayyiqra** (10): idk look this song rules and i have nothing to say about it you know. i could retell the anecdote of the time i played it on campus radio and it jumpscared my friend, or make a "and why they pink" joke that nobody but me will find funny; or say "RIP sophie". while not original, the last one is the classiest option and most emotional so i will go with that. 😔

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): An incredible snapshot of a time n' place--like they just come out the gate en media res and immediately warp themselves into a whole new form. I want to say this was in XMU rotation through july 2018. It may have been the closiest SOPHIE was ever broadcast outside Blog Radio hosts.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Types "Hot Pink/Faceshopping rave dj" in my notes and nods approvingly

**bigbigbee** (9.5): the second most iconic “oew” in a song after Kelly - Shoes

**imbaby122** (9.5): i love HAWT PENK!!! both the color and this song.

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): this has the energy of a song we've rated four times before

**intheaftermath** (9): the vocals work on this one a lot more than they did on Donnie Darko

**NotWith10000Men** (9): i love the pots and pans parts

**shhhneak** (8.9): This is SO Melodrama coded.

**shipperondeck** (8.9): oh nice i didnt know they were this kind of group

**03O9** (8.5): the vocals def take time to grow on you

**DirtyRat583** (8): [unintelligible] your gay its cuz thats your middle name

**qazz23** (8): love Sophie's production and the booming chorus

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): The drops are fuckin insane

**timothy444** (7.5): The SOPHIE production probably saves this from being yet another boring indie song. Surprisingly catchy if I'm being honest

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.5): They sounds so… aggressively British

**1998tweety** (7): doja >>>

**daythreeinmiami** (6.4): Look, I can see the vision, And I can see where it’s going, but the production and her singing style just IS NOT for me. There are way too many things happening, and my ears are so confused.

**MassiveThief** (5): SOPHIE carried so hard

**Nagisoid** (5): I wonder if anybody played this thinking it was Doja Cat. Now, about the song itself, WHAT THE HECK IS THIS CHORUS. I was truly shocked, and there is a lot of good and bad here, so I'm going with the centrist score.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): my patience is thinner the second time around

**ignitethephoenix** (3.5): not a hyperpop track in an indie rate

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): YEAH IK I'M ONLY 17 AND I GOT A FEW $$$

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): er.

**Awkward\_King** (1): WHY DO THEY SOUND LIKE THAT?!?!?!

**ricki** (1): fuck you and you ugly ass song

**Roxieloxie** (1): I gave this a 0 in its initially rate and I saw it wasnt a host pick and i thought I was safe. I am not a fan of leg's voices and their voices irrationally irritate me combined with the overall abrasiveness of this.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): Normally people will write a sentence or two justifying their 0. Not me! Fuck this song and I won’t tell you why.

**Overall Average**: 7.414 **// Average Controversy:** 2.731

---

TiltControls: Though there was some good stuff to discover off each of the albums, I don’t think this was really my wheelhouse. Which is odd since early 2010’s indie pop is my jam, but maybe it’s all just nostalgia from SSX soundtracks. So really EA is to blame for my low scores.

flava: MGMT and Superorganism remain unbothered

**Stryxen** (10.333): condragulations night time

**WaneAllstarToc** (10.000): all timer rate with one of the most bullyable albums in history alongside a solid workhorse, mgmt's almost ready for primetime smasher, AND the co-dependent bops of LEG

**just\_thonking** (10.000): This rate was traumatic but the music still bops

**RandomHypnotica** (10.000): i cannot believe it finally got in, the gag of the reveal in the trailer as well was such a genuine shock I didn't know how to react

**cremeebrulee** (9.733): my average would've been perfect if sometimes and prawn song were sent

**IIIHenryIII** (9.667): I’m so mad I lost this one and so many other fun rates that happened last year

**vayyiqra** (9.000): Fun rate ! Glad there was no discourse ! :D

**DirtyRat583** (8.667): god i wish kkb wasnt in this bc i would have loved it

**nt96** (8.667): the way that Superorganism had all those sounds yet I cant remember how the album sounded like lol

**sarcasticsobs** (7.667): I guess hearing these Let's Eat Grandma songs was worth being forced to listen to fckning MGMT again. Christ.

**throwaway-7650** (7.333): #JUSTICE4SUPERORGANISM (I'd give night time a 10)

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (7.7): I love Bonito Generation, but I’m pretty sure this was my lowest score on the album when we rated it lol. It was still in the 7’s, but everything else on the album has so much more life and energy and quirkiness. Still, I expected this to do much worse given KKB-fatigue, but maybe now that there’s a light at the end of the tunnel (aka next cycle) there is less animosity. Especially given that she’s still got another song kicking around the rate.

**flava** (4.5): yesyeysysysyweyysysy i didnt do electropop but i still felt the kkb fatigue hard by cyberpop, and I gave this album so many chances to grow on me and it only got worse, let’s just hope we get rid of the other song next

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): KKB fatigue is so passé at this point. We’re all into KKB-fatigue-fatigue now.

**bulforster** (10): Trying to look out for my 15 year old sister in a crowd of fantano fans moshing to this is not an experience I'll forget, she was having the time of her life and they slayed live tho

**CrimsonROSET** (10): first you fall down (princess and the clock) then you get back up again

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): easily one of my favorite KKB songs, here is where I can buy into their whole Bonito Generation-era vibe

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE BOUNCE

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): the world shook

**intheaftermath** (10): anyone can trampoline <3 <3 <3

**musical\_pyn** (10): yassified evangelion op

**phonethephoenix** (10): trying not to forget to bounce!

**plastichaxan** (10): I would never forget to bounce I do it everyday for them

**RandomHypnotica** (10): alexa play charli xcx bounce

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Moshing alone in my room rn

**Stryxen** (10): charly bliss was so gagged she peed

**throwaway-7650** (10): the way I'm yet to revisit this album since

**timothy444** (10): This is just like that other KKB song in this rate except more happy and has a fricken epic key change. Such a perfect bop that I'm surprised is british considering how r/popheads loves dunking on british people

**vayyiqra** (10): jump. jump. trampoline. millennials. climate. nostalgia. idk get the discourse over with everyone.

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): i once came home to a trampoline. a thing in parts that was built. and then reassembled and moved. It always sat underneath pine trees and there were always needles; i sorta miss it but I realize it had to stop bouncing at some point

**welcome2thejam** (10): Irritating half of the All Stars 6 hosts by reminding them of Charly Bliss' pee trampoline whilst giving a KKB 10

**1998tweety** (9): the one singular point they made

**bogo** (9): idc about kkb fatigue this rules

**imbaby122** (9): i bet this is gonna be the last kkb appearance in a rate for a while. i’m gonna miss these popheads industry plants :(

**anothertown** (8.5): bouce bouce bouce bouce bouce bouce bouce bouce

**impla77** (8.5): I will always be bitter about Break, especially since this was the fakeout

**just\_thonking** (8.5): This is the KKB song I will be nice to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): first you fall down, then you jump back up again, you're never gonna bring me down

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): first you lose a rate, then you lose again, then you lose again, then yo—

**Nagisoid** (8): The blatant plagiarism of Charli XCX's Bounce, scandalous. This song's message is very uplifting and the sound while simple accomplishes what it seeks out to do pretty well.

**qazz23** (8): bouncebouncebouncebounce

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): love are we out of KKB projects to rate yet

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): Happy year of Kero Kero Bonito popheads

**camerinian** (7.5): I feel like this song is just the end result of working backwards from the "bounce bounce bounce" refrain

**jman457** (7.5): Fun romp

**IIIHenryIII** (7): when I have my kids eventually, I bet they’ll love this

**ricki** (7): im exhausted from having to rate kero kero bonito

**Awkward\_King** (6): this was kkb's year and they didnt even release sob

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): one of the better songs on this album

**oscarbrierley1** (6): her voice is really annoying for me.

**Roxieloxie** (6): kkb started hitting for me day 3 of the rate seeing how they got murdered and after that, that being said, This being the song that people ride for makes me so mad its like the one I dont care for here

**runaway3212** (6): a gag but a bit of a boring gag

**akanewasright** (5): I would’ve preferred nearly any other kkb song but okay

**heysoupie** (4): something about the diction in kkb songs makes me feel irrationally angry. I think maybe its the sing-song-y-ness that takes me back to elementary school where i longed to be treated like an older kid at school and found childish music very condescending.

**lexiaredery** (3): what?

**NotWith10000Men** (2.2): the melody of the chorus is so annoying

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (2): i hate spoken parts of songs

**daythreeinmiami** (1): Get this patronising horror away from me please

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i hate you kero kero bonito

**shhhneak** (0): I’m a hater at heart and if my brand becomes popheads’ resident Kero Kero Bonito hater then so be it.

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (7): A KKB slaughter continues. Though I wasn’t too affected by KKB fatigue this cycle, this song in particular did grow off me quite a bit. Not entirely sure why, but I wish it had a bit more dynamicness to the track. Especially compared to some of the Bonito Generation stuff or even Well Rested.

**flava** (4.5): let’s never rate KKB again

---

**seanderlust** (11): i think it was pitchfork that pointed out that sarah bonito's voice makes her sound like she's always telling a fairy tale. maybe that's why this works so well

**akanewasright** (10): best song ever

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is such a kkb kkb song and i love it for that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Resist the KKB fatigue. Resist it.

**bogo** (10): don't let the kkb fatigue distract y'all from how amazing this song is

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): smash

**hikk** (10): kkb fatigue be damned they were in MY rate first I DID IT FIRST y'all just wanted to be me sooooo bad so DON'T tank this!

**intheaftermath** (10): it's better than bugsnax, tbh

**phonethephoenix** (10): sorry I love this song so much. this song came out around the same time as the bill wurtz princess song, big time for princess songs for me. whimsical and catchy!

**qazz23** (10): neat synths and very dancey

**RandomHypnotica** (10): can the kkb hate train please not come for this innocent bop

**runaway3212** (10): ths expensive ass drop

**sarcasticsobs** (10): the Smashaaaa

**Stryxen** (10): saved my life kinda

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): they really went all in on this song

**throwaway-7650** (10): TIL KKB wrote this about twice

**timothy444** (10): I only really know them from the Flamingo song but this is a cute indie bop that may or may not cure your depression

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes yes KKB discourse blahblah this is still a very nice song!

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.1): omg it's 6am time to rate ANOTHER KKB DITTY WITH MY LIFE. ever since i started rating kkb i now run the local fan club chapter/roller rink enthusiast club; we have 16 members. honestly the LAST and LOGICAL place kkb gang would end up is making fucking steven universe gamer music. it's an unexplored and potent lane of pop that is actively meeting their unending necessity of world building. really fun ditty god damn it sarah's great on it

**anothertown** (9): this album is my meow meow and i celebrate the intent to do a narrative song but there isn't anything in the delivery that's helping that come across. the words just kind of waterfall over.

**cremeebrulee** (9): me seeing this instead of well rested: https://external-preview.redd.it/TM2g1Mxd_mFXgKTkQRpZI9wEiup6fzc5Nr1BmcKCiMI.jpg?auto=webp&s=407fa5df2d810894b5f3ab0e99e41ffaff5dc61f

**CrimsonROSET** (9): pokemon type beat

**imbaby122** (9): princess and the glock.

**Nagisoid** (9): Poor princess got clocked. This is pure electronic bliss, and I love the story they're telling with the lyrics. The beat simply makes me happy, which not many songs can do.

**thedoctordances1940** (9): more like kkpee 😂

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This story is so beautiful omg

**1998tweety** (8): one of their few good songs

**plastichaxan** (8): I love you KKB I promise your robberies here are not personal forgive them

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is nice but i cant help but notice this is litterally a song about barbie Rapunzel

**impla77** (7): This sure is a KKB song

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): more like the Princess on My Co-

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): oh wow a kkb song. never heard one of those before

**jman457** (6.9): I actually liked this EP, but this wasnt a fav from it

**daythreeinmiami** (6.8): I think I need to listen to this a few more times to know if I like it or not. But not right now. I’m a fast paced environment.

**camerinian** (5): I think I just need a KKB detox after rating them so many times. It's honestly kinda hard to get excited hearing Sarah's voice anymore

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): like several KKB songs for me at this point some parts I enjoy are up against parts I cannot stand

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This hits all the beats of songs that I really like but it just falls flat for me, I can’t connect with it there’s no depth to the sound

**IIIHenryIII** (5): KKB is just KIDZ BOP for indie fans

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): very boring

**moonagenightmares** (4): starting to think i just really dislike her voice because i can actually imagine myself liking this song otherwise

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): kkb music :sleeping_accommodation:

**frogaranaman** (3): I’m not adhd enough for this

**ImADudeDuh** (2): FUERA

**MassiveThief** (2): I've gone from gently liking KKB to being so sick of them from rates alone. Give Sarah a break PLEASE

**shhhneak** (1): Multiple Kero Kero Bonito songs in this rate, imagine how tired we are of it!

**just\_thonking** (0): ooweeoo I look just like buddy holly

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (7.5): RIP the future AS6 winner predicted by subreddit-famous rate psychics. The track got a little messy for me at times, but that ended up being its charm in some ways.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this is still a bad song. I hate that “daaazze daaaazzze daze” part so much

**MassiveThief** (2): god I hate that chorus.

**fadedblue09** (1): these boys talking about being drunk….weren't some of them minors when they recorded this

**Overall Average**: 7.424 **// Average Controversy:** 2.475

**MoonlightByWindow** (10.333): all these picks slayed the house down boots

**vayyiqra** (10.000): Fun rate! Last summer I was housesitting for my parents for about two weeks while they were out of the country and had nothing much else to do so I got a metric ton of Thai food and sat outside in the sun listening to the playlist for this rate every day (about a dozen times) and generally just fucking around and that ruled.

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): I wanted L11ac but the others all got 11s so ✅

**hikk** (10.000): the slayest section of the rate why lie

**akanewasright** (10.000): me giving this rate 3 tens does not illustrate how much this rate exhausted me as it was ongoing

**sarcasticsobs** (9.833): Where WJSN?

**bigbigbee** (9.500): the boys ate up the girlies in kpop in 2021.

**plastichaxan** (8.333): I’d never seen such a mix of bad songs with excellent songs and rarely inbetweens

**Stryxen** (8.333): condragulations lose by wonho

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.167): justice for “Easy”!!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.033): Oh boy, can't wait to give my favorite group a 6 in the 2022 rate!

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.333): rated these while watching hunter x hunter they get what they deserve i swear on da bible (my athf & cowboy bebop dvds)

**IIIHenryIII** (7.333): another one I missed the deadline

**Roxieloxie** (5.600): I think this one had more of an impact me than the other one. I think it was cause I watched the back half of the music videos with two friends and it was fun to score like that

**DirtyRat583** (5.000): did u purposefully try to be controversial with these picks.

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (9.7): Okay maybe Snail Mail’s album had some good stuff. I don’t revisit it often, but this and Forever will always have a place in my playlists. This looked like it was almost going to end up in day 3, but a few last day low scores brought it back down.

**flava** (6): I’m gonna use me wanting to avoid talking about snail mail as an excuse to talk about how close the upcoming results are (between this and the end of this day we are moving up less than 14 points

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): i love how visual this song is, it paints a picture, the sensual verses, the explosive release and melody. i adore the album cover for this album, i actually just put it up on my wall today, and i love the shade of red in it. red's so interesting because of how it can represent love, anger or lust, and this song somehow encapsulates all three so well imo

**RandomHypnotica** (11): I hate how much of a grip this song has on me

**1998tweety** (10): ate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yes the album overall is pretty floppy but maybe that’s just because she had to put her entire Snussy into this one.

**bogo** (10): you know what, this might have been the best song in its rate

**CrimsonROSET** (10): award for ‘lamest song that i have themed a d&d character around’ goes to

**hikk** (10): my biggest regret of 2022 is not 11ing this, just a few months after this rate it HIT (unfortunately!)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): DARLLLLLLLLLLLIIINGGGGGGGGG VALLLLLLLLLLLLENTIIIIINE

**impla77** (10): chorus slaps, enough said

**intheaftermath** (10): finding music like this is the reason I love rates. Wish I'd participated in the original tbh

**jasannn** (10): snail mail, my [snail noises]

**musical\_pyn** (10): justice for forever (snailing)

**plastichaxan** (10): The Bi erasure jokes were all made already I can’t come up with more

**runaway3212** (10): y’all robbing this cause you dont have a valentine I see through you

**Stryxen** (10): remembering when I was the resident snail mail stan of like 4 discord servers . I was not doing well mentally

**thedoctordances1940** (10): omg her one good song and actually it's amazing

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): ugh this rate was so good

**throwaway-7650** (10): one of my housemates' mom made pound cake for us on valentine's day, which was nice and a reminder that I'm single af

**welcome2thejam** (10): Surely she won't Snail Fail this time!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): that chorus she ate it

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): we should've rated this album against king princess' for the amandla stenberg exes rate, maybe then it wouldn't have flopped so badly

**akanewasright** (9): so true

**dream\_fighter2018** (9): getting broken up with in the park by Amandla Stenberg only for the paparazzi to take pics and upload them as “Amandla comforts an upset friend” core

**dreamingpastel** (9): I'm a simple person. I hear a guitar and someone sing-yelling their feelings, and it's an instant like from me.

**vayyiqra** (9): This is such an obvious pastiche of 90s alt-rock (complimentary)

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): it has grown a bit more on me, but I still have a hard time dealing with her whiny voice

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): lindsey my beloved

**NotWith10000Men** (8): it grew on me a lot by the end

**qazz23** (8): I like the harder sound during the chorus

**daythreeinmiami** (7.8): Omg I was not ready for when that turned intense. Love it. Pop off.

**imbaby122** (7.8): i don’t get the snail mail hype. like yes this song is on quite a few of my playlists. but i just don’t understand why.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.8): Highlight of this year was inspiring the rate hosts with my comparison to Gabbie Hanna

**phonethephoenix** (7.7): okay fine I'll listen to snail mail

**ricki** (7.5): i wish it went harder and bigger [edit: idk why but i think it’s funny i used this phallic language for a lesbian song]

**DirtyRat583** (7): biphobia comment number 19594024991040509219

**WaneAllstarToc** (6.4): lindsey i love this for you but i just wasn't on board for this sound. great voice and chorus but god damn it not this song structure that od'd hard on the quietLOUDquiet vibe

**sarcasticsobs** (6.3): idk the synths don’t feel like they “fit”

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): No thoughts on this.

**Nagisoid** (6): Her Erased Valentine. I like the outro much more than the rest of the song, I don't think the growl part works well at all.

**jman457** (5.8): This song got so overplayed on my local radio station, it annoyed me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): good 4 u but for lesbians

**timothy444** (5.5): Decent but forgettable; bordering on mid

**03O9** (4.5): she sounds like she’s reading off a teleprompter

**pig-serpent** (4): Bands like Snail Mail are why I have trouble embracing the label of "indie."

**camerinian** (3): it honest to god baffles me how Snail Mail gets any attention at all when she's so clearly inferior to her peers in basically every manner, not just in the original rate but in the genre as a whole which is so rich with talent. Almost gave this a spite 0 before someone kneecapped my high horse

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): the vocals here grate on me sorry

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (1): valentine’s day is actually a capitalist construct in this essay i will

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (9): to me, Streets not getting top 5 in Main Rap Girls was one of the biggest robberies of the year (im sure the hosts agree). It was just an incredible slow burn of a song with some iconic moments (yes we are playing the milk performance) and Doja Cat just owns every small atmospheric quirk. This not being day 3 or ever being in day 3 is so sad

**TiltControls** (7): It’s a solid song, but it doesn’t really inspire much emotion from me. I do feel for the hosts that had a pretty limited selection of viable picks they could send to this All Stars, but I feel a spot in the top half of the list is as good as any.

---

**akanewasright** (10): I didn’t want to send this but I didn’t have a choice… don’t murder my baby

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We need Tik Tok to turn more slay deepcuts like this into hits.

**camerinian** (10): damn I need to listen to this under the influence of several glasses of wine again that shit made me feel like the hottest bitch on earth

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is lucky it came out in 2019 and not 2009 because i definitely would've made its hook my aim status at some point

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this was my 11 runner up holy shit

**DirtyRat583** (10): why did you rob this album popheads ❌👎

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): pussy slay

**ignitethephoenix** (10): smash

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): when is she gonna make another song like this…

**oscarbrierley1** (10): loved it since it came out, glad tik tok got it popular.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the streets doja is talking about

**ricki** (10): you werent treated with the proper respect you deserved

**runaway3212** (10): I love the streets

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I didn't do this rate but I looked up this song's rate comments and "darjeelingdarkroast (10): Burial please remix this" SO TRUE, DARJ

**throwaway-7650** (10): 11 count: 2 (the way this/SNS [demi] were both #6 🫤)

**vayyiqra** (10): robbed song should have WON

**seanderlust** (9.5): okay i'm sorry that drop is still so hot

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.1): said this one had "post-weeknd vibe". still stand by this wrt bass on this cut. doja has a big range and I feel like I undervalued the longevity and maverick class vibe. <3 shine on u crazy diamond!!!

**1998tweety** (9): she served sex

**Nagisoid** (9): I'm sorry but I remember the intro to this song was a trend in NSFW TikTok for whatever reason and when this started played I burst out laughing so hard I think my neighbors got jumpscared. That aside, this is a fantastic track with one of the best and most atmospheric beats I've heard in a hip hop song in a while, and Doja's delivery really shines here.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Love the original, but the Disclosure remix is THEE best version imo and would definitely be a 10

**timothy444** (9): Chill, sexy, vibe

**imbaby122** (8.8): the second this song comes on the ass starts moving it’s instinctual

**phonethephoenix** (8.1): it's a nice song and her verse is great

**heysoupie** (8): wait this is Doja Cat?

**plastichaxan** (8): The damn papa verse… Rent free

**daythreeinmiami** (7.8): It’s a vibe, but Rules, Addiction and Talk Dirty are perfection in my eyes.

**shipperondeck** (7.7): i apologize for near single-handedly tanking this song. i Understand now. mostly

**jman457** (7.4): its good, but missing the personality of a lot of her songs.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this has actually grown on me

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i still dont care that much

**Stryxen** (7): I like the idea of this a lot more than I care for the song tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.8): What do you all like about this it sounds like background music

**03O9** (6.5): most overrated song on hot pink

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): im just like doja cat bc i too have never played a final fantasy game

**intheaftermath** (5): am 100% suffering from doja cat fatigue

**thedoctordances1940** (5): I mean I kinda like what she's going for on this but honestly it bores me and I don't get the hype

**Roxieloxie** (4): I still dont like this im sorry [2]

**pig-serpent** (3): I hate tanking every slow RnB song that comes my way, but outside of the rap verse I really can't find anything to like about this. I just can't find anything there to get invested in.

**Awkward\_King** (1): girl get out the milk! she so goofy we cant take her anywhere

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (8.7): I always expect this to do better than it does. It’s catchy, relatively inoffensive, and a pretty fun time. I guess in rates though you need a lot more than that to win [INSERT THE MANY CASES WHERE SOME ‘FINE’ SONG WON A RATE]

**flava** (6): it was my lowest score for the excellent Go-Go’s album and it somehow managed to do the best. Idc idc our lips are sealed deserved to be here over this relative flop

---

**1998tweety** (10): my siblings and I when we see my dad reach towards the rolling pin

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Still love love love this song but honestly I do regret not going with my gut and getting an 11 win with Once in a Lifetime. Sorry ladies.

**bogo** (10): queen shit

**cremeebrulee** (10): last place of 2022 in kpop introducing themselves

**CrimsonROSET** (10): THEY DO!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the smasha!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): timeless

**ImADudeDuh** (10): first known record of white people finding any beat

**plastichaxan** (10): Their album ended up my favorite of the rate I’m kinda obsessed

**sarcasticsobs** (10): God DAMN

**Stryxen** (10): BY Girls FOR girls. Boys can listen too but u may NOT tank this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): you just had to grow up being hyperfixated on rock band 2 to get it

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): they got the beat, what else can I say

**throwaway-7650** (10): wait ik this... might've been my 11 in NWG

**vayyiqra** (10): it's a banger

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): A bang and a bop at the same time

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): oh cool it's rock band 2 classic we got the beat. a punk song that's so fucked up it went into the closet and came out a pop ditty. a lot of bands today try to do this and utterly fail. the go-gos straight up did it by accident and succeeded. my point? go in there as punk and let the tea leaves reveal themselves

**IIIHenryIII** (9): you really do

**qazz23** (9): good surf guitar riff, but not quite as good as Our Lips Are Sealed

**shhhneak** (9): Seated for Glee Season 3 Episode 1

**welcome2thejam** (9): A true power pop classic

**Frajer** (8.5): cute song but not my fave of theirs

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): so many people call this an 80's classic and yet I feel like I hear it maybe once a year at most

**jman457** (8.3): Remember when Debby ryan covered this song?

**phonethephoenix** (8.1): when we have the beat

**akanewasright** (8): YASS

**heysoupie** (8): annoying group vocals

**imbaby122** (8): damn right you do!

**Roxieloxie** (8): dora the explorer classic

**MagiKiwi29** (7.6): I prefer the Glee Cast version but it's still good

**camerinian** (7): our lips are sealed deserved I fear

**Memezaharamole** (7): great handclaps

**Nagisoid** (7): They're doing free promo for Stamp on It? Queens supporting queens. Okay, not as good as the other two songs here, but it's still extremely catchy even if repetitive, the guitar adds enough flavor.

**ricki** (7): step back step back silly gir

**runaway3212** (7): some random SM girls be like

**jasannn** (6.5): I thought this was We Rock from Camp Rock at first afjhskdg

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Head Over Heels deserved a longer run on Broadway

**intheaftermath** (6): i'm sorry it makes me think of the Fresh Beat Band

**thedoctordances1940** (6): almost instinctively gave this a 0 because I was reminded of step back

**timothy444** (6): I have never watched Footloose but if someone were to tell me that it's the soundtrack to that movie, I would 100% believe them

**Uberpigeon** (6): this is ipr

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): GIVE IT BACK!!!!!!!!!!!! MUM SAID IT WAS MY TURN WITH THE BEAT

**NotWith10000Men** (5.4): fine for what it is and when it was

**seanderlust** (4.5): everyone giving this an 8 or above i do not want to hear a thing about charli having repetitive lyrics

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): the guitar on this is really slay but i don’t like the chorus unfortunately…

**hikk** (3): step back step back silly girl

**pig-serpent** (3): That guitar riff is still carrying my score. I'm just over this song.

**daythreeinmiami** (1): Sorry, you do not have the beat. Fight me.

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (7): For what seems like a while, FANCY didn’t look like it’d be making day 3 even. But the last week of ballots managed to raise up into day 2. As for the song, it’s fine. I think it’s lacking a hook for me. It’s all super well polished but I can’t really seem to make myself care about the song.

**flava** (4.5): with my previously revealed kpop scores you’d think I don’t like the genre, which i dont think is fair considering I heavily considered giving the remaining lone Kpop song my 11. I’m just picky and this song is pretty bland, maybe the hosts of the two kpop rates should’ve sent better songs and yes I am avoiding talking about this song cause there isn’t much to say about it. It sounds like one of those fake bops

---

**1998tweety** (11): literal pop perfection but y'all will send this out day 2 cause its not English [2]. This was the pivotal moment in Twice's career when they started serving CUNT. Everyone knows where they were when this dropped.

**anothertown** (11): 달콤한 CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM 처럼 녹아버리는 지금 내 기분 SO LOVELY!!!!!!!!!!

**jasannn** (11): i told my roommate that I listened to fancy for an hour straight and he was like “the iggy azaela song?”

**MagiKiwi29** (11): Best kpop song no doubt

**ricki** (11): this is the song that i credit for turning me into a kpoppie and im not sure if i should give it an 11 or a 0 because of it

**akanewasright** (10): I’m happy I got an 11 win but this totally deserved to win

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): They made a British slang term sound slay…miracle workers.

**bluehxrizon** (10): i blame this song for all the stan twitter gun memes in 2018

**bogo** (10): maybe this should've won and the feels should've been the song that made all stars

**cremeebrulee** (10): they deserved the 2021 rate win as reparations for this losing, no its sad

**DirtyRat583** (10): god im so happy twice arent under yg can u imagine if they were making this same song to this day 💀💀

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): 2019 TWICE will never be surpassed

**hikk** (10): yeah i was gagged when this didn't win smackdown... it should win here tho yup

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I’m convinced this is definitely one of the best kpop songs of all time

**phonethephoenix** (10): hadn't heard the song before this rate but i'm obsessed now!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love bubblegum pop

**runaway3212** (10): this not winning despite being like the most popular kpop song on the sub such a moment

**thedoctordances1940** (10): can't believe they have a rate win with the feels but not this

**vayyiqra** (10): Every now and then I think "yeah Twice are overrated" then sigh a little and put on one of their albums because they're a solid 7-8 band that get treated like a 10-11 band. Good song though!

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): never going to give this a 10 because I'm petty but... bop!

**bigbigbee** (9.5): It’s funny how TWICE successfully convinced kpop fans that this was some dark bop just by wearing black, when the chorus is just as bubblegum as ever (and it’s perfect)

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): kinda grew off me over time

**Awkward\_King** (9): i know nothing about kpop but this is the best kpop song ever

**dreamingpastel** (9): Everything changed when Twice dropped this

**Stryxen** (9): OH! OH!

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i’m a once but i’ve always felt that this song, while great, is a solidly mid-tier title track in their discography

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.1): Oh TWICE… so glad you eventually got the crown this year but also I kinda don't care about you outside of 3 songs

**camerinian** (8): please tell me someone else in this rate has an impassable mental connection with this song to Uncle Roger

**Roxieloxie** (8): i've gotten in a huge twice phase but this song is still one of my least favorites i fear. Okay im redoing some scores like a month later and for some reason I enjoy this song only when im not rating it, like it comes on in a rate and im like 'i really dont like this one :/' but then itll come on my kpop mix and im like 'YOU KNOW I FANCY YOU' idk, ill give it an 8 now

**sarcasticsobs** (8): "Feel Special" and "Cry For Me" outsold, and possibly their only > 8.0 songs. TWICE the quintessential 7.5-7.9/10 kpop group to me (edit: wait I actually very much enjoy their Japanese releases, they should make more songs like them as well)

**welcome2thejam** (8): Idk I just really like the use of fancy like "I fancy you." Makes me feel like a firm but socially awkward nobleman who owns 8.5 horses and struggles to show his affection

**impla77** (7.8): The album cover is giving TWICE remake of Death on the Nile

**pig-serpent** (7.5): It's a good Twice song, but it didn't stand out to me like the song I thought would win the rate (Yes or Yes.)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): mind of a mastermind etc etc

**frogaranaman** (7): (hand rolls up to face) fan see u

**IIIHenryIII** (7): too repetitive

**Nagisoid** (7): They're so fancy, I already know. Very fun song, but love bomb kinda clears it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): taylor swift thinking of what to say in the london boy chorus

**timothy444** (7): Look… it's a decent song but the presence of the same sample that Nelly uses in Dilemma just detracts from the song. I want another less-distracting sound effect here.

**daythreeinmiami** (6.4): Is that a Nelly ‘Dilemma’ adlib? I can respect that.

**heysoupie** (6.4): fine

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): TWICE are a bit too overly-pleasant for me, they’re not insane enough for me idk

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this song gets the acclaim that i cant stop me deserves

**jman457** (5.3): yeah this isnt clicking with me

**03O9** (5): charli xcx features on a song called fancy… twice makes a song called fancy… charli gets revenge by naming her new song twice… the music industry stays pitting women against each other and frankly it’s revolting

**imbaby122** (5): tw: british dialect

**plastichaxan** (5): They didn’t get to Iggy’s level :(

**WaneAllstarToc** (5): it was the part with trap that moved this from "pretty chill mid" to "christ man no". the hollowness of this one really shines through in moments like that, where the commerce hasa overtaken the art

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): ruined TWICE!

**shhhneak** (2): this sounds like it was designed to be used for 5 second interstitials on Love Island.

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (10): my 11 in TWOE and a song that for a lot of the rate was in the top 10 very surprisingly, an example of early participants showing more taste than later ones cause this song deserved top 10

**TiltControls** (7.2): I think this song grew more on me as the rate went on, though I was initially surprised at first at how long it spent in the top 10. Unfortunately, the last week’s worth of ballots dropped it to day 2 and into its current spot.

---

**akanewasright** (10): the best song ever made

**Awkward\_King** (10): YO the girls they call me london YO cause i am based in london

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): More like queen of this song.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean she said it herself

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): those British and their crepes

**plastichaxan** (10): She’s always so cunty this is the energy I want in life

**Stryxen** (10): the production is phenomenal but Quay Dash is THE star of the show. The Bridge is so Sophie and you almost expect to hear her signature high pitched vocal runs start but instead we get miss dash demanding ur attention with just a Fuck that. I love that part so much its ICONIC

**throwaway-7650** (10): :arnedance: (edit: wrong quay dash song)

**imbaby122** (9.5): click click pow! definitely top ten onomatopoeia ever.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): Absurd production and attitude

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.2): https://twitter.com/dril/status/935421211416330240?s=20

**phonethephoenix** (9): a bit intoxicating

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): wait tyler’s winning song ripped off the fucks from this or..

**welcome2thejam** (9): Remember her having some sick beats in that rate, and this is definitely a great one

**seanderlust** (8.7): quay dash is such an icon god

**03O9** (8.5): we need a quay dash comeback

**bogo** (8.5): did she lie

**camerinian** (8.5): If you could see the stank face I'm making rn

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I live in a country where we don't speak English, but some of us do our best to learn the language (even though we take English classes at school, no one here actually learns how to speak the language). Anyway… I met a dude once who pronounced "crepe" as "crap". Now whenever someone mentions eating crepes, I just cannot imagine them eating crap (oh no, she just licked her lips 🤢)

**impla77** (8.5): When she said fuck that.. I felt that

**1998tweety** (8): kinda ate

**anothertown** (8): ok the slurp??

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Oh this is nasty. This is sickening. This is Kunt™.

**frogaranaman** (8): no lies detected here honestly

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): kinda wish this was “Shades On Top Down” but this is good

**intheaftermath** (8): just a good time

**qazz23** (8): catchy, good flow

**Roxieloxie** (8): sad to see this isnt the furry song but it still bops

**shipperondeck** (8): bop

**timothy444** (8): I know this was produced by SOPHIE but it really felt like a Disclosure track in a good way. Good on them.

**vayyiqra** (8): I really hope Quay Dash is doing okay.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Boppy

**jman457** (7.6): Its slaps a bit

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Kinda giving me 2006 electroclash vibes

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Queen of NY is the better Quay Dash song that starts with “Queen of” but this is good too

**pig-serpent** (7): I get this more than I did before, but it's still a hit or miss listen for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): wheres the video of furries vogueing

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): it's fine but almost too minimal of a beat?

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s cute but cute next to gorgeous…

**Nagisoid** (6): It's solid. The production is interesting and it's catchy, but nothing to write home about.

**DirtyRat583** (5): drag rate-core

**NotWith10000Men** (4.1): the dude going hunh in the background is terrible

**runaway3212** (3): im sorry but no

**jsonphile** (2): I don’t get what’s enjoyable about this

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (10): misandry and 2 0s really kept this from being day 2 and I hate it, this a classic track and deserved better

**TiltControls** (10): Against all odds (being old and men) this track managed to come pretty close into making it into day 3. This song is just so catchy to me. Robert Smith does wonders with the vocals and the guitar is so easy to bop along to.

---

**camerinian** (11): perfect, iconic, gorgeous, doomed to fail because it's by m*n, yet I give it an 11 for a second time. When will I learn

**jsonphile** (11): I often struggle to decide what song to 11, but put this song in the list and it makes my decision so much easier

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i didnt get the chance to 11 this in its original rate, so nows a better time than ever to redeem myself. its just one of the most lovingly beautiful and gorgeous songs ever made, it makes me feel so warm and fuzzy listening to it and puts a big dumb smile on my face whenever i hear it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The best song of all time???

**bogo** (10): one of the most beautiful songs ever created

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): wife guy anthem

**Frajer** (10): I love you Robert Smith

**frogaranaman** (10): god I’m so lonely

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it truly feels divine

**Memezaharamole** (10): omg another infectiously catchy and emotion-stirring tune, love these charity rates

**Nagisoid** (10): This is Run Away with Me for goth boys. The Cure have better songs but this is still outstanding, the synths here are urethral as hell and the lyrics are interesting and fun.

**pig-serpent** (10): Perfect song. The fact that it was voted into all stars means enough people agree with me that we need to rate a Cure album.

**qazz23** (10): one of the best love songs ever - that piano solo really makes this

**sarcasticsobs** (10): fckning 11 contenda. I forget to do this rate, mildly perturbed at myself

**shhhneak** (10): Synthp10p

**Stryxen** (10): is this straight gay or gay straight

**vayyiqra** (10): Support notable boomer goth "wife guy" Robert Smith

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): "this is literally the most straight propaganda song ever but its fucking amazing so idc". this comes from a dmd bestie and for my money, its not entirely wrong. LITERALLY every cover of just like heaven can be! Like have you heard the tasteful country version that can show up on Spotify? It's fantastically straight and sweet. Important to this though is that Robert Smith is just such a wife guy that makes us ALL WANNA BE WIFE GUYS TBH!! Like there's a Dinosaur Jr. version of it that SST put out that turns you into a stoner cool music dad. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UT7IpRx08tE Robert Smith's 80s run of morose pop music created new types of morose wife guys. His anthems are still undefeated and the insane levels of precision and absolute bliss of Just Like Heaven are endearing to this day. A perfect side b opener to kiss me x3 rock on robert! you nailed it king!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Maybe one day I'll find someone that makes me feel like this

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): it's a lovely song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): maybe the straights do have rights

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): You’re telling me this isn’t that “Stop The World And Melt With You” song from Sky High?

**RandomHypnotica** (9): Close To Me >

**03O9** (8.5): show me show me show me

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): ugh,,,, maybe i do wanna be in love

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I’m I sour that closer didn’t get voted in? Yes. Will I tank this because of it? ~~I wasnt going to but then upon a relisten it’s not as good as I recall ~~

**jman457** (8): A good 80’s synth rock song

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**imbaby122** (7.5): AHHH JUMPSCARE! u guys cant keep getting away with making me listen to the cure!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.1): I can never predict which old songs you all like and which ones you can't stand

**akanewasright** (7): sigh… we could’ve had closer and it could’ve won….

**CrimsonROSET** (7): run away with me was a response to this song idc

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I like boomer music and I like some of The Cure’s music but i dont really care for this

**MassiveThief** (7): I LOVE the cure, but even for their hits this one has always been just fine to me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): obsessed with the overtly gothic looks they’re serving in this video

**throwaway-7650** (7): can't believe this score improved from charity

**DirtyRat583** (6): why do i not remember hearing this in charity rate

**timothy444** (6): Decent but forgettable and also their only amazing song is the one that has Friday in it.

**Awkward\_King** (5): i think im too desensitised to 80s pop like most songs sound the same to me unfortunately

**NotWith10000Men** (5): i kept waiting for something to happen and i looked at the progress bar and the song was half over and it had been the same thing the whole time

**Roxieloxie** (5): why did you all vote this in out of all the material that was there

**runaway3212** (5): dad type beat

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): dudes should've rocked more

**plastichaxan** (1): I’m sorry I don’t like men

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (10): I want to go back to blissful early January when this was winning for about 10 ballots. This track is chaotic in the best way - it never lets up and keeps you going the whole time.

**flava** (8): so fun fact, for the from ballots 8 to 20 or so this was winning and me and tilt were a little surprised, but then a few tankers started coming in other songs close to the top kept on getting higher scores even if most people were still very positive towards my high, so you could say this song fell from its high

---

**CrimsonROSET** (11): we start the rate really on the highest point possible this is a set up

**akanewasright** (10): the best song ever made

**Awkward\_King** (10): voguing vid yetti edited of everyone dipping to this

**cremeebrulee** (10): this being in all stars makes me feel like a parent seeing my kid off to college

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): one of the best songs in this whole rate teabh

**nt96** (10): This has Dom Top energy

**plastichaxan** (10): Kinda glad slowthai has great music like this cause it’s embarrassing enough to admit I find him hot

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): YESSSS MOTHERFUCKERRRRRRRS

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the most iconic shitpost of the entire cycle tbh

**Roxieloxie** (10): BITCH DONT FUCK UP MY HIGH. We were rooting so hard for it to win, it was basically locked for all stars the moment it didnt win. Its an absolute smash and gave us one of my favorite shitpost fakeout sagas ever. I dont think its gonna do better her but if it did, I would happily take it cause it deserves

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): did someone say rate winner

**thedoctordances1940** (10): vote uk rap even though voting will be closed by now and I have no idea if it was even submitted again

**throwaway-7650** (10): [Aminé voice] "BITCH."

**intheaftermath** (9.5): killer start to the rate! Infectious, fun, but kind of wish it wasn't a full 5 min

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9.3): this slaps even more live

**anothertown** (9): This is the exact type of song i would re-soundtrack the dissociative jesse pinkman party scenes on breaking bad with

**bogo** (9): i'm not gonna make the chainsmokers joke again. i'm not gonna do it. but also i have no idea what else to comment

**MassiveThief** (9): god I love Aminé so much

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): I feel old as fuhk what do you mean All Stars #6

**Stryxen** (9): twerk

**welcome2thejam** (9): This needs to survive long enough to play before all the other songs here used as reveal fakeout jokes

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): okay wait banger

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): disclosure came back to the club!

**03O9** (8): banger

**1998tweety** (8): this is Todrick Hall core but it bops

**qazz23** (8): good beats and flow, like the whisper break

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Boppin’

**timothy444** (8): Wouldn't feel out of place as a 2000s garage track

**vayyiqra** (8): It's a "hip house banger". This doesn't mean it wasn't pleasing to see it dethroned!

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.8): I had no business hating this song as much as I did

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): Production on this is so slick it gives me a high.

**imbaby122** (7.5): still holding a grudge against slowthai for his verse on bde </3

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.4): i need a medic

**Nagisoid** (7): I like the beat but the guy's voice is kinda annoying and the breathing in parts are so weird.

**pig-serpent** (7): Maybe Bitch can fuck up my high, but Bitch can't fuck up my shuffle

**jman457** (6.8): low key the music video stresses me out so much, so i had to knock it down a point

**LesApfels** (6.5): It's like an Azealia Banks song for the straights

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.1): Feel like I'm at a straight club

**impla77** (6): Just not really my music

**babadork** (5.8): I thought this had grown on me, but my rating is a full point lower than it was the first time.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): please don’t fuck up my rate

**shhhneak** (3.5): That definitely isn’t mother lake in the album art.

**runaway3212** (3): getting drunk >>>

**NotWith10000Men** (1.5): i love these rates bc i get to use the FULL 0-11 range lmfao

**MagiKiwi29** (1): got boring pretty fast for me

**moonagenightmares** (1): the rate starting with a 1 seems like a bad omen

FlavaSavaVandal: **flava** (10): Ultimate 2021 loses a song and it’s the best song from that rate (although good 4 u and industry baby are both 10s and deserving of day 3 too) I’m so sad this loses out here, but I think Creme said it best when we revealed the voted-in songs. Oxytocin did amazing outlasting 2 whole albums and coming 4th. But maybe people voted it in because it’s fun to rate songs that you love

**TiltControls** (9.5): We finally lose our first Ultimate track. Though I feel a little bad that Doja got shafted here, I don’t think I would’ve scored Get Into It nearly this well. There’s this dark overtone to the production of this song that I love and while it couldn’t make the final push to day 3, I feel like this is a pretty good spot for it.

---

**NotWith10000Men** (11): i gave out four 10s then came back to decide who got my 11 and it was really no choice. this one is just straight up my favorite one to listen to in the whole rate, and it's not close at all

**Awkward\_King** (10): fleabag season two core

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This getting top 5 in Ultimate…we were so happy then.

**bogo** (10): this is billie's closer (NIN not chainsmokers)

**cremeebrulee** (10): dont get me wrong this is good (it's a song i literally 11d and did the top 100 writeup for 💀) but it did not need the redemption!! it did way better than i thought it would AND billie won the rate so why is this here!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): if i had ever seen this live i think it’d be a 11 it looks absolutely insane

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): highkey one of the few Billie Eillish songs I like

**daythreeinmiami** (10): It’s the bass for me and the similarity to Sims 2 build mode music.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): suffocating in the best way possible

**hikk** (10): 🥵

**ignitethephoenix** (10): love this song but I also always think about how this must be the weirdest song to record with your brother

**IIIHenryIII** (10): endocrinology 101

**plastichaxan** (10): Don’t do drugs but like maybe a little bit for this song cause wow

**qazz23** (10): favorite track off the album, love the dark synth sound

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this kinda deserves the acclaim title track got

**runaway3212** (10): we love should’vebeenasingle-bias

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): can’t stop the bop once it’s been set in motion

**throwaway-7650** (10): my HTE pick would've been NDA but this is still a 10

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): she was so real for this

**jman457** (9.6): There is something about this song that slaps so hard

**camerinian** (9.5): the devil's music (complementary)

**pig-serpent** (9.5): Permanently locked to my list of songs by major artists that didn't become smash hits for some reason.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): the line where she sings "you know i love to rub it in like lotion" reminds me of an old tumblr post i saw once where this girl was like "the weird boy at school just gave me homemade hand lotion! idk why it feels so sticky but it smells really good!"

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): daisybop

**Nagisoid** (9): This is like yassified Nine Inch Nails, in a good way. Her yells are so good here, I wish she used that aspect of her voice more.

**ricki** (9): https://gfycat.com/ThunderousCooperativeDinosaur

**imbaby122** (8.8): the people listening through the walls are actually the people watching m3gan who were subjected to teenagers screaming this song in theater next door.

**1998tweety** (8): i didnt know Billie knew how to serve a minute amount of cunt, but here we are

**akanewasright** (8): I’ve never honestly gotten into this song thaaaat much compared to other people who love the album as much as me, but like… its still great

**DirtyRat583** (8): this should have won over hte (like in the album ranking) i will not be going into details so as to not go batshit insane ❤️

**vayyiqra** (8): Should've called this "Melatonin" because it's putting me to sleep! 🤣 no really this is pretty good

**MagiKiwi29** (7.8): got better and better as it went on

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): The whispering kinda annoys me in this case but not enough to make this a "bad" song at all

**Stryxen** (7): it's .

**timothy444** (7): Love the beat, but find Billie's voice incredibly mid.

**phonethephoenix** (6.9): whispers

**03O9** (6.5): production cute but not loving the sore throated vocals! this is like diet jockstrap but i can appreciate the attempt

**impla77** (6): This just doesn’t do anything for me

**MassiveThief** (6): Cool song but the novelty has kind of worn off. Not one I've listened to really since the album came out

**Memezaharamole** (5.5): I appreciate the production and trying something new, I think this is a song I would prefer to hear live to appreciate it more?

**anothertown** (5): this song has no sex appeal. this is like fortnitecore

**fadedblue09** (5): Still don't get the love…feels like a bad guy clone

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I feel like if this were in the background of a scene on a tv show or over the end credits of a movie it’d be a yass but I can’t see myself ever just wanting to like, listen to this

**ImADudeDuh** (5): don’t care for ha

**intheaftermath** (5): never got around to this album last year and this song was so hyped up. It didn't live up to it :/

**heysoupie** (4): I like Billie Eilish just fine but I do not enjoy this - it sounds like Billie Eilish doing an impression of Grimes covering a Timbaland-era Nelly Furtado song

**thedoctordances1940** (3): sorry I never really liked this and there were better songs to vote in anyway actually no i'm not sorry

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): 😑

**frogaranaman** (1): of all Billie songs to vote in

**Roxieloxie** (1): I just cannot get into billie, something about her asmr whisper vocals rarely works for me, Therefore I am, and two on the other album are pretty good but outside of that I just cant.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): this was a waste of votes

FlavaSavaVandal: **TiltControls** (11): Oh my poor Porter. This was top 5 for a small portion of time and I was very heavily tempted into going rogue and convincing Flava to end the rate right there. Unfortunately it was not meant to last and it dropped slowly until it was just on the cusp of a day 3 finish. Porter songs are kind of like a cheat code for my brain and this is no exception. Though I feel bad for CHVRCHES a bit, I’m so glad we got to rate this again and I could 11 it like I originally considered in Electronic Pop.

**flava** (7.5): and this is our final elimination of the day and I’m sure my cohost wants to die a little, but he won’t because I still need him for Day 3. He can die after that. I’m not gonna say I’m a Porter fan, I feel a lot of his music has an overearnest feel to it, but this is still good and has an emotional core to it that I do appreciate. It’s like country music, but for weebs, and I can respect that. And considering the chvrches song y’all wanted to send, maybe it’s best we sent this instead

---

**bigbigbee** (11): I really didn’t want to 11 this because I’ve already given Porter his flowers so many times, and I like changing things up…but this album really is one of my favorites of all time. And I had such a special experience listening to this song in particular, one sunny spring day last year…I followed his instructions and looked at the sky, and I felt totally safe and present and secure in my own body. I almost wish that CHRVCHES had made it in instead (and I voted for them over this!) because I’ll be quite sad if there’s backlash to this song just because it was voted in instead of them

**dreamingpastel** (11): My emotional support song

**hikk** (11): when ppl tank this for being too corny and it goes out ridiculously early i WILL sob

**vayyiqra** (11): Look I already trauma-dumped the hell out of this album in my comments in the rate. Something glad to be alive, dude rocks. I can't fucking wait for it to be spring and winter is sapping my will to live, but soon I will be in the park in Toronto again looking at the cherry blossoms, and thinking about this song, and it will be beautiful and remind me there is a reason to keep going and so on. Love this guy rock on Porter Robinson

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I wish I were looking at Asking for a Friend right now. A 10 regardless.

**bluehxrizon** (10): i find it kinda funny how he wrote several excellent songs for this album about not being able to write songs

**bogo** (10): this is just so wholesome. real reassuring and comforting thank you porter

**CrimsonROSET** (10): he should not have been allowed to release this during the pandemic i swear this man is evil

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): screaming sobbing crying wailing punching the walls pulling my hair

**frogaranaman** (10): I did! it’s overcast rn

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): :)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): just like the rest of Nurture, this song can cleanse one’s mind

**MassiveThief** (10): such a pure lil song. perfection

**phonethephoenix** (10): yeah this song is comforting

**pig-serpent** (10): A song that's infectiously in love with life and can remind me of the simple joy of being alive, even at my lowest moments. I'm going to be alive next year, just so that I can still listen to this song.

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh i really like this :(

**runaway3212** (10): look at the sky we’re still here

**seanderlust** (10): see my jukebox comment from a few weeks back. this was a spark of optimism that i discovered at a time when i really needed it so it's an auto ten

**Stryxen** (10): too much for January. Can't deal with this. Right now.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): let me just cry for 5 minutes real quick

**thedoctordances1940** (10): best song on nurture noitstrue

**throwaway-7650** (10): LOOK UP IN THE SKY IT'S A BIRD IT'S A

**timothy444** (10): I'd describe it as EDM music for the soul. Seriously, this is just amazing on all types of levels and the different parts of this song just feel so cohesive. It's like a comforting hug you get whenever you feel like everything in the world is against you, but in audio form. Every single element in this from the simplistic intro, the piano, the melodic riffs that repeat throughout the entire song, the synthetic vocaloid-lite vocals, just works toegther to provide such emotion. Absolutely beautiful.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Makes me wanna touch all the grass

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.9): the sky is the clearest blue today. speaking of…

**krusso1105** (9.5): great song but I wanted CHVRCHES here :(

**camerinian** (9): between Winners 3 and now something finally clicked in me with this album. Not even my favourite track on it but holy shit Porter really dropped something incredible and I just didn't give it time of day

**imbaby122** (9): the fact that i’m actually doing a lot better rn than when i first listened to this song sucks bc i have to admit that a man was right. gonna make myself miserable just to prove porter wrong.

**just\_thonking** (9): Tell me how it's better when the sun goes down :(

**ricki** (9): i hope someone gives you a zero…. for what you did to magbay

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): - Don't Look Up (2021)

**ImADudeDuh** (8): weeb sh!t

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Look at this guyyyy he’s stilll hereeee, getting anoootherrr beer, might even geeet sooome fooood, oh, geeet sooome fooood

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.9): Maybe this album has some bops

**akanewasright** (7.5): I’m glad musician won but this is alright

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): just got a hailstone in my eye thanks

**fadedblue09** (7): very refreshing, and probably deserved more than Musician

**moooo566** (7): it's one of the better songs from this album but jesus it still sounds like a remix of a ringtone

**Nagisoid** (7): Look at the slay. Not much to say here, just an adorable song with mellow but optimistic lyrics.

**qazz23** (7): good use of both a loud and quiet chorus

**impla77** (6.5): Its not very impressive, theres a lot of light pollutions where I live

**intheaftermath** (6): it's ok

**WaneAllstarToc** (5.9): thanks for making nightcore NIN or some shit idk porter stil not on board with the vision here.

**03O9** (5.5): this is giving me church vibes and not in the ethel cain way.

**jman457** (4.7): im not letting this man win anything

**daythreeinmiami** (4): I thought my headphones were breaking at the end of the song and I had a slight panic.

**anothertown** (2): i'll tank a thousand porter robinson songs before i let this company die!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): the breathy vocals to this specific kind of electronic pop is hugely not for me

**plastichaxan** (1): No thank you it irritates my eyes
