All Stars 6 Rate Reveal Day 1: Chillin' Like a Rate Villain
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/11az9k7/all_stars_6_rate_reveal_day_1_chillin_like_a_rate/

We are your hosts /u/Flavasavavandal and /u/TiltControls and it is the day you’ve all been dreading…

Welcome to the **All Stars 6 Reveal Day 1**. An event that one way or another (should've been voted in btw) will [suck the life](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1050753779726819409/1078754895630438490/image.png?width=927&height=485) [out of your soul](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1050753779726819409/1078754938068418640/image.png?width=935&height=485), but you still come, maybe to cheer on your faves, or to just embrace the chaos. Whether that be from tragic robberies or the song you hate making it way too far, usually a combination of the two. Today we will be revealing #64 - #44 starting at 8pm GMT (or an hour from when this post first goes up). You can join us in the [queup room](https://www.queup.net/join/losers-6), where things are happening, usually a hint to a song ---> song itself ---> slay interlude.

FlavaSavaVandal: # Hello there, 

now if you did All Stars 6, you should've received a reply from me back containing a link to an exit form where we pitted the songs that did receive enough votes to get in but not the highest from that particular rate (Wolf Alice - How Can I Make It OK?, Doja Cat - Get Into It (Yuh) and Chvrches - Asking For a Friend), the songs from rates that did receive the most votes but not enough to make it in with the one song per rate rule in effect, and 2 Closers against one another in a single elimination bracket draw. 73 lovely people got back to us and cast their vote. This was mostly a low stakes game so no rate got completely left out. **Note you do not have to have done the rate to vote in the quarterfinals and onwards**

## **We pitted**

1. The Weeknd - High For This vs Måneskin - Zitti E Buoni
2. 5 Seconds Of Summer - Don't Stop vs Chvrches - Asking For A Friend
3. Wii Sports  - Wii Sports Theme vs Girls Aloud - Biology
4. The Chainsmokers - Closer (feat. Halsey) vs Eve - Let Me Blow Ya Mind
5. Wolf Alice - How Can I Make It Ok? vs Little Simz - Woman
6. Everglow - La Di Da vs Closer JPN
7. Doja Cat - Get Into It (Yuh) vs Bad Bunny - La Santa
8. Cardi B - I Like It vs Ava Max - My Head & My Heart

## And these were the results

**Matchup 1**

>![The Weeknd takes a dominating victory over Måneskin, receiving over 70% of the votes, while the musky Italians couldn't even muster 30%](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461516887625728/matchup_1.JPG)!<

**Matchup 2:**

>![This was a bit closer but Chvrches were still able to smash 5 Seconds of Summer to make it to the quarterfinals with over 60% of the voters favouring the Scottish synthpop group. Maybe these mysterious Chvrches supporters should've done Electropop 2021 and saved them](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461517147676783/matchup_2.JPG)!<

**Matchup 3:** 

>![Somehow the Wii Sports Theme won out over Biology, I'm not even joking, it was close (58.9% to 41.4%) but I distinctly remember checking in earlier and seeing it wasn't even remotely close](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461517403537418/matchup_3.JPG)!<

**Matchup 4:**

>![While it was winning early, the edm-pop duo were not able to overcome the misandry displayed by voters as the Eve song takes 61.6% of voters. This was probably the 2nd biggest robbery in Round 1. smh](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461517667770378/matchup_4.JPG)!<

**Matchup 5:**

>![Little Simz won with over 3/4 of the votes, I'm just shocked it didn't get more](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461517906853938/matchup_5.JPG)!<

**Matchup 6:**

>![Our closest matchup but the DICC Bicycle song wins out with only 56.2% of the vote. I would've cancelled this whole thing if both Closers went out this round so thankfully La Di Da was defeated](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461518254968913/matchup_6.JPG)!<

**Matchup 7:**

>![Matching the amount of votes Woman by Little Simz got, Doja Cat was able to Get Into the quarterfinals and La Santa suffered a humiliating defeat](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461518573748264/matchup_7.JPG)!<

**Matchup 8:**

>![In another relatively close matchup, we pitted I Like It against My Head and My Heart, like in the main rate, Ava is clearly an underdog and thankfully she was able to defeated to I Like It](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461518968000512/matchup_8.JPG)!<, >![just kidding Bad Bunny may have suffered greatly in Matchup 7 but he manages to sneak through with Cardi B and some other guy](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1078461438751940649/1078461518968000512/matchup_8.JPG)!<

**[Link to quarterfinals](https://forms.gle/miVTtsaEhg7tWFVQ9) voting closes one hour before the rate post goes up (probably 6pm GMT)**

TiltControls: Also as (semi-) tradition of these rates we're going to be holding a prediction contest for the top 5! List what you think the top 5 will be in order and the person who gets closest will get a reward, but more importantly **bragging rights!!** Make your guesses as a reply to this comment. Also to help with tiebreakers please also include what you think the final score of the winning song was.

You have up until the start of day 2 to make / change your guesses.

It's hard because while I'm fairly confidence in my top 2 making the top 5, I feel like 3 and 4 are going to be fairly basic choices I think are fine, then all the songs I really like that have acclaim are going to go out between 15 and 5 (Track 10, Just Like Heaven, Walking in the Snow, Look at the Sky, etc) so yeah, lots of choices.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Before we started getting ballots I was certain that the race for last would be Miss Movin’ On vs So Am I. And yet as the ballots came in 1D held the bottom spot for nearly the entire rate (undeservedly!)  I remember liking this song in 2014 Y/N and was surprised it left earlier than it did there since it seemed to be a fan fave (and also wasn’t a Vamps song). I thought that the goodwill there would get it to at least 60th, but the fact that I was the highest non-10 for the song was probably not a good sign!

**flava** (5): lmao, this was last place for most of the rate, and it wasn’t that close until last weekend. And while I may not hate this song, I think it’s actually hilarious that a Day 2 song got beaten and robbed blind by a last place song, and a 2nd last place song and I became this songs biggest enemy and started cheering when I got a ballot with worse scores for this over So Am I and Miss Movin On (sorry Roxie). But the song is so polarising, I can see why it did this badly. I never did figure out how I feel about this, is it a camp 10, a fat 1?. And I ended up settling with a score halfway between because well I just couldn’t make my mind up. It’s clear effort was made into this goofy little ditty, but maybe not all effort is good effort. But unlike So Am I and Miss Movin On, no one can call this generic

**pig-serpent** (5): The song should've stayed pirate instead of transitioning into stale arena rock.

**plastichaxan** (5): Originally had given it a 1 but eh I’m feeling nice as I rate this I also do not act my age

**sarcasticsobs** (5): I'm too old for this. Have nothing bad to say though. Zayn voice good.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Perhaps I overestimated you

**phonethephoenix** (4.7): four is right!

**timothy444** (4.5): You're god damn right I'm giving this a lower score this time round. I mean the production is decent and I don't actually mind the lyrics… but the way they deliver those lines and the inconsistency of quality in the entire song is laughable at points. This isn't an All Star song, this is just dumb filler.

**heysoupie** (4): blatant rip off of…something?

**IIIHenryIII** (4): that’s just one of the clauses in the contract boys have to sign to be part of a boyband

**qazz23** (4): the intro/bridge is good but still not liking the vocals

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): i like the bridge i guess

**seanderlust** (3.5): sorry "when i'm fat and old" - i hate that opening for a song skdjfd

**intheaftermath** (3): yeah never mind I still hate One Direction. This sounds like something they'd play at my old Bible Camp. That's not a compliment

**nootnoot781** (3): i forgot that liam payne was part of one direction until i heard his voice at the start. my brain usually tunes him out i think.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): this killed my inner child

**03O9** (2.5): okay irish jig 😍 katys “act my age” outsold 😒

**Awkward\_King** (2): im sorry i cant take this seriously ksjfnjewe jkfnjrjk4edwjf

**hikk** (2): one direction giveth (no control) and one direction taketh away (this) sorry ricki

**imbaby122** (2): irish jig/pirate shanty/line dance/country song???

**just\_thonking** (2): what in the Jig of Life is this

**Nagisoid** (2): What a mess, and why do parts of this sound like Pogues if kidz bop corrupted them? Also the lyrics are Melanie Martinez coded.

**Uberpigeon** (2): pirates of the caribbean type beat

**bulforster** (1.8): roxie thank you for the deep lore during that listening party for this rate, please do not perceive this score

**anothertown** (1): this song fucking sucks! clouds deserved!

**Birdseeding** (1): What the hell is this? Pub Rock meets children's music. Moronic production

**CrimsonROSET** (1): it’s funny because i still hate this but i’d rather it be here than any of the vamps

**daythreeinmiami** (1): I’m sorry, it’s a no from me. You’re not going to Hollywood.

**MassiveThief** (1): I just can't with one direction. what the hell is this

**moonagenightmares** (1): one of the worst songs on the album.

**shhhneak** (1): This is horrible hooooly. It feels like when an older coworker calls you buddy.

**shipperondeck** (1): i thought i accidentally shuffled the playlist what the hell is going on

**thedoctordances1940** (1): by all means this should be getting my 0 but I don't want to expend that much thought on this i'd rather be petty with it

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): I was ready to 0 this again but then I got to the end of the rate … Boys be sure to thank Ayesha Erotica today

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Sorry Roxie.

**camerinian** (0): this is the most affectionate 0 I could possibly give, it's adorably terrible. They had so many ideas and threw them all in with no thought for cohesion or taste. Just imagine being the label rep who argued "no the celtic dubstep saloon ditty must stay on the record"

**impla77** (0): This song is simultaneously too slow and too fast

**lexiaredery** (0): I don't like anything that is going on

**Memezaharamole** (0): what in the irish jig is going on here?

**musical\_pyn** (0): the best thing about this song is that it made picking my zero very easy

**oscarbrierley1** (0): the intro triggered my fight or flight so viscerally that i have to give it my zero. then it gets worse, the dubstep drop followed by a folk dance section, NO. i hate that this rate made me listen to this song.

# Gets a “helped this not be last place again” sticker

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**cremeebrulee** (10): i honestly thought everyone was shitposting about 0ing this back during ratemas, i was so shocked it actually left first

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): rating this one based off of how much enjoyment it gives me rather than how good it is

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ICONIC ANTHEM FOR FEMALE FRIENDSHIP

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): real music.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): wait why is this actually kinda the best song ever made now that I'm revisiting it

**TragicKingdom1** (10): still don't understand why this tanked so hard in ratemas like it hits the slay button for me hence the 10 but like otherwise its a perfectly serviceable pop song

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): it’s cute and overhated!

**runaway3212** (8.5): this song is about how you can thrive despite not doing well in your original rate

**akanewasright** (8): honestly this wasn’t that bad

**hikk** (8): 10 years of Fifth Harmony and what an amazing and crazy 10 years it's been we cried we cheered and we laughed but in the end it was all worth it because we got to know and watch these wonderful women grow and do what they love and I wouldn't traded that for anything I love all 5 of my talented beautiful girls from the bottom of my heart and I pray that they continue to have success in all their future endeavors love you Camila, Normani, Lauren, Dinah and Ally 💘💘💘💘💘 👑👑👑👑👑 #OT54ever

**MagiKiwi29** (8): yes, I'm a harmonizer I'm sorry

**Stryxen** (8): hyperballad before this song deconstructs and recontextualises the meaning of this heartbreaking anthem so much :purple_heart:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This got last place in its rate? ….Why?

**MassiveThief** (7.5): I fail to see what apparently sucks so bad about this

**pig-serpent** (7.2): I was very surprised to be greeted by the "Fifth Harmony" text while checking to see what song this was. It sounds nothing like their big hits, both in terms of style and quality.

**slimboyfriend** (7.2): the true genius of this song wasn’t unlocked for me until I heard it playing immediately after Bjork singing “I want to feel safe again” in hyper ballad

**intheaftermath** (7): i miss you radio disney

**oscarbrierley1** (7): objectively not very good, but its so fun and cute

**jasannn** (6.5): that’s the spirit we need for 2023.

**Frajer** (6): I'm sorry did Camila say shake it off like an etch a sketch

**IIIHenryIII** (6): this kinda grows on you

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i think i gave this a 4 in ratemas but i’ve increased it here because i kinda miss this brand of teen pop…sue me

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): remind me why we did them so bad in the rate? this is not that bad. was it the dubstep hate

**Birdseeding** (5): Starts out quite strong but meanders into nowhere

**jsonphile** (5): this song was dated when it came out in 2013 my god this David Guetta esque production sounds like the worst of 2009-2011. Songs kinda catchy though I must admit

**qazz23** (5): the chorus is a bit annoying/generic, it's a "5"th harmony

# Hasn’t learned since Ratemas

**jman457** (4.4): this is so mid, like I know the host of this rate hate Kate Bush, but come on now???

**03O9** (4): it’s… but the cover art ate

**anothertown** (4): Julia Michaels always at the scene of the crime

**bigbigbee** (4): this sure was the trendy sound in 2013

**bogo** (4): are we sure this isn't just a rejected victorious song

**CrimsonROSET** (4): thank you for not making me last place in that rate

**phonethephoenix** (4): sorry I will be moving on.

**throwaway-7650** (4): it doesn't deserve to go out first again tbh

**vayyiqra** (4): Even as an apologist for Fifth Harmony yeah this kind of sucks! Conceptually it's like Music for Airports only it's "mid commercial FM radio pop for minivans stuck in traffic".

**WaneAllstarToc** (4): love 2010s pop

**welcome2thejam** (4): Really stretching the definition of All-Star I see

**NotWith10000Men** (3.9): complete nothing of a song

**imbaby122** (3.5): this song is a bit of an assault on the ears but the single cover is such a jumpscare it could’ve sent me into cardiac arrest.

**lexiaredery** (3.5): pretty uninteresting

**Verboten\_Prince** (3.5): Every time Camila Cabello opens her mouth: squeak squeak squeak squeak

**babadork** (3): If this had less Camila Cabello, I would probably give it a better score.

**dreamingpastel** (3): That chorus is a black hole

**nt96** (3): Oh these poor, poor girls. What can I say about them? I never liked their music at ALL. TLC, En Vogue, Destiny's Child, Spice Girls, Mis-Teeq, among others have truly raised the bar with quality girl group music, what does Fifth Harmony have to offer that the other groups don't? Why should I listen to them, when there are so many groups, past & present, that do it better? 2010s kids were horribly robbed of an iconic girl group era and were deceived into thinking that this is the best the genre has to offer. You kids have my condolences.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): the fact that my deep cut passion pit song got a higher score than this speaks volumes

**impla77** (2.2): This is 2008 core.. could imagine the Saturdays slaying this song marginally more

**camerinian** (2): love that classic Fifth Harmony-brand failure to harmonise

**daythreeinmiami** (2): Guys, don’t even worry about it. Just shake it off like an etch-a-sketch. Start clean.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2): let’s leave camila cabello in 2015

**moonagenightmares** (2): this is so of its time in a bad way lol

**sarcasticsobs** (2): Camila Cabello's voice is like shooting a nail gun into my ear drum at full power

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): oof

**Awkward\_King** (1): i am speechless

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): nahh

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): can’t relate, I haven’t moved on from anything ever

**frogaranaman** (1): why would you do this to us again

**just\_thonking** (1): Miss Movin' One

**Nagisoid** (1): I'm Mr. Moving On from this trainwreck, like I do not know what they were thinking with this production, especially on the vocal front, and the lyrics seem like some proto-girlboss rant.

**plastichaxan** (1): Admitting embarrassing facts on this ballot but I used to listen to the spanish version of this and that’s the one I know the lyrics to

**seanderlust** (1): they play this song at MLM conventions when the CEO walks on stage

**shhhneak** (1): We irritating.

**shipperondeck** (1): god...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i hate my life

**nootnoot781** (0): miss movin’ on to 60th place

**timothy444** (0): Everything about this just screams outdated like a generic Demi Lovato track in the early 2010s. The beat is overproduced, the girls sound like they've been oversaturated by whoever produced and there are no outstanding lyrics in this. Looking at this producer's wikipedia page (Mitch Allan), you can tell he really has no taste in music especially when you find out he helped produce that god awful cover of blue with david guetta and bebe rexha

# wtf Kappy!

**Roxieloxie** (10): if you want to know why this song is in its directly /u/kappyko 's fault

**flava** (10): those 0s never really stopped coming, but neither did the 10s, thankfully this was able to hold out over Miss Movin’ On and Act My Age to last as long as it did, and yes I am starting a timer to see if Donnie Darko would last longer than this song in the rate

**TiltControls** (1): I almost wish Ava got a wildcard spot so she could at least have the smallest fighting chance. Though I guess she technically moved up in score and placement? Only 40 more times rating this and maybe she can pull off a win.

---

# Literally the only people I can trust

**thedoctordances1940** (11): After finding out that I had my 11 eliminated in the bottom 5 most often in the last year of rates, I knew I would have to fight to retain that title and what better why to start my title defense than this

**timothy444** (11): When people talk about Ava Max, one of the many things I see commented on is the comparison between her and Lady Gaga. Understandable, as they both have similar musical styles in their songs and same compositioning. However, I'd like to argue that Ava Max is more than just a Gaga clone. In fact, if you listen closely to her music, it's very evident she has a more eclectic style than what's expected from an artist who mimics a certain pop star. Her voice stands out among others because it is so unique! And in the song "So Am I", she shares that amazing uniqueness with every single one of her listeners, showcasing her relatability with her beautiful voice. This song in particular tells a all too familiar tale of insecurities and self-loathing that many women face at some point or another. And this makes it relatable for anyone who has ever felt any sort of insecurity before. The lyrics are so powerful, you can feel yourself being pulled into them while listening to the song.

# Has felt like a misfit

**1998tweety** (10): this is ahead of its time

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Revenge of the misfit haters.

**DirtyRat583** (10): only half-shitposting this song is actually good (in my brain at least)

**fadedblue09** (10): empowering, life saving etc.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The trick to liking this song is to pretend that it’s from the soundtrack of a Monster High movie

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when r/music dragged this along with r/popheads, that was the closest to solidarity that we’ll ever get

**intheaftermath** (10): derivative sad pop bangers my beloved. Stream Diamonds & Dancefloors <3

**MassiveThief** (10): god Ava Max is just so GOOFY dude. she's so silly. if there's one thing about Ava, it's that she WILL be a goofy crazy girl.

**plastichaxan** (10): I know people will never open their eyes to her genius and that’s okay

**ricki** (10): weeekly please release cute music again we miss you

**Stryxen** (10): everybody has nightmares about where they were when this dropped

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): why not at this point

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): she's such an earnest flop; loves admitting to being crazy (just noticed her hair im dying) and wearing her one pair of latex pants everywhere; fetish queen. I love her so goddamn much. #thankyouavamax for taking feminism back to bop avenue!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): just because it’s cliché it doesn’t mean it’s bad

**heysoupie** (8.2): fun and tbh, not what i expected ms. free concert in suburban costco parking lot to sound like

**bluehxrizon** (8): kelsey acting normal vs the real kelsey

**Frajer** (8): let Ava make her cute H&M bops

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this song is very overhated. Like no it’s not a masterpiece but it’s perfectly serviceable as a corny pop feel good anthem. For me a low scoring song I would want to turn off part way, but I could listen to this in the background with no qualms

**jasannn** (7.5): It would’ve been funny if weeekly - afterschool was voted in

**bogo** (7): ngl this is actually kinda fun in a silly way

**welcome2thejam** (7): Ava Max releasing this five years too late for Glee is a tragedy for the ages

**phonethephoenix** (6.4): ava max is always so middle of the road for me. idk how to push her farther

**Birdseeding** (6): No, you're not. But the combo of 70s Europop and scotch snaps is pretty novel!

**jsonphile** (6): why do all Ava Max songs sound like they already exist and make me rack my brains trying to figure out exactly what it reminds me of

**lexiaredery** (6): I think I can see why people don't like it

**pig-serpent** (6): For how memed this song is here, it's very normal. I mean, I guess that's probably part of the reason for the hate. Good meme though.

**shipperondeck** (6): i am becoming an ava max apologist, i fear, bc i kind of like this song now lmao.

# has not recognised art… yet

**Awkward\_King** (5): the hate i got for 11ing this was worse than what i experienced for 5 years working in the drag race fandom

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): it’s fine

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): she’s so goofy and quirky!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): honestly i don’t dislike it

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): did this song even do well in its rate

**CrimsonROSET** (4): the september/so am i mash up ricki (?) made for the disco singles rate still keeps me up at night

**Nagisoid** (4): I became a believer in this song after watching the furry choreography video. This is pure camp; you either get it or you don't - to me it's just so bad it loops around being enjoyable. The lyrics being absolute cringe that is so tumblr-coded fits in well, too.

**nt96** (4): me when someone says they’re an Ava Anti

**qazz23** (4): a bit generic and too polished

**NotWith10000Men** (3.9): this is just do you ever feel like a plastic bag but worse

**babadork** (3.6): I hate all Sid and Nancy references in pop songs.

**imbaby122** (3.5): i think i can add this to my list of songs with that same damn chord progression

**RandomHypnotica** (3.5): honestly, this song could be worse, it just sounds like the group performance at the end of a disney channel cyberbullying musical

**moonagenightmares** (3): kinda sounds like dollarstore marina

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): can’t take her anywhere

**musical\_pyn** (2): is this a good song? no, but will I give it a higher score because of the pure camp of a highly manufactured popstar singing about being relateable? Well, also no

**oscarbrierley1** (2): i like the production and melody, but the lyrics make me cringe so bad

**shhhneak** (2): This cover is an AWOOP jumpscare.

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Ah yes, that's exactly what I need to hear when I'm feeling down and at my lowest: that I'm just like Ava Max

**impla77** (1.5): Whoever was mixing the vocals was really feeding into the be different message of the song..

**camerinian** (1): I'd like to wish anyone scoring this track above a 6 a very happy upcoming 9th birthday

**daythreeinmiami** (1): This sounds exactly like Sweet but a Psycho but worse.

**hikk** (1): i would give either of her top 5 songs a 10 :(

**nootnoot781** (1): i'm not giving this my 0 because ava was set up. whoever submitted this probably saw her label fuck her over and said "my turn".

**Roxieloxie** (1): Its the fact that I know ava max has at least 1 good song on this album and you all didnt send that one

**sarcasticsobs** (1): I’m in pain

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): ava max you changed my life, just not with this one

**vayyiqra** (1): silence.

**flava** (10): this was the first of my previous 11s to get eliminated, and yeah it stings a bit, but this isn’t even remotely unexpected, outside of the context of drag rate even less people are likely to get it. 

**TiltControls** (8): Well at least there’s the historic no 0’s list now

---

# the shitpost for this song was staged, King had his own reasons for sending your makeup is terrible to AS6 that don’t include removing alaska off the no 0s list, and if you give him any real shit then your makeup is actually terrible

**Awkward\_King** (7): if this escapes bottom 5 thats a win

# buying a guillotine as we speak

**bulforster** (10): king and the 0s for this aren't seeing heaven

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way this being in the rate was a literal set up so Alaska could lose her record of never having a 0. The #KatyaWasRobbed mob must be stopped

**welcome2thejam** (8): I enjoyed this but tbh Alaska getting out of drag rate zeroless despite having this song said a lot more about her competition

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): king if we ever meet in a vacant lot you’ll learn how I feel about your song selections

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): rip to alaska's no 0s stat

**impla77** (5): King really set up Alaska here, I have a FEELING this will get some 0s.

# watches drag rate

**akanewasright** (10): THIS FACE IS MY ID MOTHERFUCKER

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it’s been a while since I had so much fun with a song, this slaps

**intheaftermath** (10): camp but like really really good camp

**plastichaxan** (10): Another song that’s just pure genius unappreciated by popheads

**runaway3212** (10): and what about it?

**Stryxen** (10): not everyone is gonna get it but those who get it... we see each other

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): so real for this

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): TERRIBLE TERRIBLE

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): peak 2010 music (that came out in 2015)

**1998tweety** (9): shes talking about me

**pig-serpent** (9): This is hilarious. I've never had any interest in Drag Race before but no I'm temped to watch it solely for Alaska Thunderfuck, and that's really impressive.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.8): aurkayyyyeyyyokayokay

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): camp

**daythreeinmiami** (8): GIRLIES GATHER AROUND THIS IS WHAT CAMP IS MKKAAAAYYEEEEEE BYEEEEE

**DirtyRat583** (8): your makeup is 🧚terrible🧚terrible🧚terrible🧚 your makeup is 👺terrible👺terrible👺terrible👺

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): this song does not transcend drag music but it is camp and we love her for it <3

**qazz23** (8): ...but this song isn't

**thedoctordances1940** (8): god what a fucking burn

**camerinian** (7.5): my condolences to anyone who didn't do Drag Rate getting assaulted by this song for the first time

**sarcasticsobs** (7.5): I'm sure there's something I'm missing, but it's not bad per say (Edit: Okay, as this went on this got funnier and funnier. Bumping the score)

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): PURE/HONEY unbothered

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): yeah ik, it's cause all my products expired in 2018

**slimboyfriend** (7.3): honestly this is kinda punk

**jman457** (7.2): A nice campy song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): its wild that because of the competition alaska might not lose her no 0 title in the rate

**shhhneak** (7): One of the very rare instances where somebody is better at talk-singing than singing.

**phonethephoenix** (6.9): it's fun!

**anothertown** (6): the "divesting from LVMH anthem"

**frogaranaman** (6): kinda artpop in a musky way

**heysoupie** (6): this is what I expected Drag Race music to sound like. It’s not for me.

**seanderlust** (6): alaska was such a real one for referencing crystal labeija at a time when a large sector of the drag race fandom had never even seen paris is burning, let alone The Queen

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Oh this is gonna be a real victim of sounding much worse surrounded by non-drag-queen-music.

**dreamingpastel** (5): I appreciate the laugh it gave me

**vayyiqra** (5): funny song but not good

**03O9** (4): why does every drag queen believe they can make music. leave causing tinnitus to RuPaul!!

**jasannn** (4): What Tera Type is Alaska Thunderfuck?

**Roxieloxie** (4): not a huge fan of this one

**imbaby122** (3): my uncle went to an alaska show a couple weeks ago and i kind of wish i was there to scope out the type of people who are listening to this.

**ricki** (3): white girls ANGRILY SITTING to the oonts oonts in the club

**NotWith10000Men** (2): this song is terrible and unfortunately i do not love it anyway

**shipperondeck** (2): im so sorry

**bogo** (1): this just annoys me

**lexiaredery** (1): Goes down every time I listen to it

**MassiveThief** (1): thanks i hate it

**oscarbrierley1** (1): no

**timothy444** (1): When you're in a "make bad music" competition and your opponent is Alaska Thunderfuck. This was not made for me (I'm more into pop punk) but I really couldn't stop cringing over the spoken word lyric delivery and awful lines thrown into this.

# YOUR TASTE IS TERRIBLE

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): this is painfully unfunny and painful to listen to, which leaves it with nothing going for it. It benefited in its original rate from being in a rate with Oops I Think I Pooped, but it doesn’t have that to shield it from my zero this time.

**fadedblue09** (0): I have no ill feelings towards any song in the rate so I'll just join the "Kick Alaska out of the No-0's list" squad

**jsonphile** (0): this is quite possibly one of the worst things I’ve ever heard.

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): i literally heaved a huge sigh at the chorus and somehow it just got worse

**Nagisoid** (0): I would like to see the makeup, it can't be as possibly bad as this song. I can't even give this a camp score because it's trying too hard to get one, and the shitty delivery combined with the dollar store slay type beat makes this song feel way longer than it actually is. What were they truly cooking.

**flava** (10): hosts really sent this to a second death, I don’t think I got it in LADNC (but again I was speed running a 70+ song rate) but now that I’ve had some time to sit with it, this is just so dumb it’s hard to hate. These kids have never broken a law, they couldn’t even if they tried, and that’s why it’s just so much fun to bop along to with

**TiltControls** (8.2): Like Miss Movin On, this only kept growing on me throughout the rate and maybe should’ve gotten a 10 tbh. I never really heard of the series before this rate and although I don’t think it’d be for me nowadays, it does seem like a fun series.. Honestly the song is kind of a mess, but it’s catchy and becomes a lot more enjoyable the less seriously you take it.

# Sofia Carlson’s fan club

**1998tweety** (10): they ate this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I was perhaps the Descendants’ strongest soldier in the Disney/Nick rate and I’m back on the frontlines here.

**cremeebrulee** (10): me after my bjork score gets revealed

**fadedblue09** (10): like a Dua Lipa song but better

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Even if this doesn’t win just remember that it’s probably out streamed most of your faves

**hikk** (10): get twice on this and it's an acclaimed nudisco revival kpop classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is such a good song! Love it!

**intheaftermath** (10): This was my 11 in its original rate. This song can do now wrong. It's campy, but not SO plot-focused that it can't be enjoyed on its own. Sofia Carson kills it on the vocals. It's just such a great time and such a great song. Amazing. So good.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this was the last decendants song I heard and it was one my friend hated and after hearing queen of mean I wasnt really super excited for this, so much to my suprise when I heard this song finally and it was good? More than good honestly, Kinda amazing for a dcom song??? Like I think most of the songs in this franchise never really reach the heights of how food alot of the old ones do, but this one I will fully admit even with my nostalgia biasis that had this come out ten years earlier it would've ate among disney kids. Also this is the most insane production, Like there are a list of non american blonde pophead faves who could slide on this track and make the best underground #80 top 100 hit that gay people have ever heard

**runaway3212** (10): she deserves 5 tony’s

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ok you know what? this song is good, actually. sometimes kids have good taste in music and i will not stand for anyone who objects

**thedoctordances1940** (10): idk why anybody bothered trying to make anything better than this after it was released everybody has just failed

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i've thought about this song daily since hosting this rate like its genuinely probably a mental health problem

**Uberpigeon** (10): chillin like a rate villain

**vayyiqra** (10): very funny song

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This might be the best song to ever come out of Disney Channel

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): : oh my god im gonna fucking scream we got a "puddle of mudd - blurry" candidate i missed. christ man this is SO close to gta V radio mirror park vibes. christ on a cracker i wanna burn this track down but it's so committed to the bit and keeps accidentally stumbling to an 8.1. this is the leorio of hunter x hunter of rate tracks. oh fuck it just passed the hunter exam because it got carried by luck incarnate itself; idk fucking know how the formula did us so dirty here. so it's a ten

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): this song is also lame but the whole franchise is just so funny

**nt96** (9): you Disney stans are too ignorant to admit that newer songs like these aren't bad, you're just getting old :)

**timothy444** (9): It's a disney song marketed towards pre-teens. Sounds alright though

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): this could literally be on FOL: O+T=<3

**phonethephoenix** (8.1): seriously, you need to not be yourself

**bulforster** (8): this is so good??

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This song is just a pure bop. You’d almost forget it was from Disney Channel if the cheesy adlibs weren’t throughout the song.

**DirtyRat583** (8): camp (1)

**impla77** (8): Descendants is good actually.. except when that fucking dog speaks

**seanderlust** (8): this is way better than it has any right being

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is a kpop song

**Memezaharamole** (7.7): OK, I thought Descendants was that little animated mouse movie, this kinda slaps

**jman457** (7.6): Vocally this kind of slays.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): if you gave this song to someone with better vocals I would actually like it.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): but if anyone else had this instrumental? Holy shit

**pig-serpent** (7): So Teen pop nowadays just sounds like English BTS songs?

**welcome2thejam** (7): I can't unscrobble this scrobble and you're all to blame

**Stryxen** (6.5): we're gonna wear PINK every day we're gonna be STRONG f*cking gays!

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s hitting a bit now wait…

**shipperondeck** (6): this could be an evil ava max song

**Awkward\_King** (5): i cant believe #rates was driving itself insane for months over this. anyway banger

**dreamingpastel** (5): This sounds like a mediocre Jason Derulo song

**IIIHenryIII** (5): not from my generation so there’s no nostalgia for my bias

**jsonphile** (5): this is the best descendants song easily. But like, it’s still a descendants song

**oscarbrierley1** (5): the title, lyrics and autotune are attrocious, but the beat is good.

**qazz23** (5): sry i prefer the other Descendents

# villains

**03O9** (4): the songs they played at vacation bible school:

**NotWith10000Men** (4): graphic design is my passion

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): one time in December my gym played the Christmas version of rotten to the core while I was working out and sad to say I recognized it from doing the Disney/Nickrate and hearing the original :(

**camerinian** (3): so uh… this is one of those "only an all star in comparison" entries right

**Nagisoid** (3): I would give this like a 9 if it was an instrumental track or if someone else sang it. Both the vocals and the lyrics are painful and it's such a shame that this good of a bassline and synths got wasted here.

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Why is "Disney" a listed artist on this song on Spotify?

**akanewasright** (2): I hate her voice I’m sorry

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (2): i’m sure the descendant cast cannot do Next Level

**bogo** (1): i will never understand this series

**frogaranaman** (1): the NMIXX school of thought

**plastichaxan** (1): I thought it was the hyperpop song before listening but it ended up just being the worst one

**imbaby122** (0): i would pay good money to never hear sofia carson sing again.

**TiltControls** (7): I have no idea what is going on in this song, and frankly it probably works better that way. Though it had some competition, this ended up being our most controversial song - which fits pretty well with how TK decided to send it in.

**flava** (1): so when rating this during unreleased I made the comment that this had potential to be the kind of song I give a 1 but then it becomes a 10 after the due date and I end up regretting my score, well that didn’t happen during unreleased but then it got sent to AS6 and it happened while I was making the shitpost for this song. Now I couldn’t change my score without giving Tilt all of my worldly possessions for doing this after he started making banners, but I get it now, I see the light, and I’m sorry I didn’t see it sooner, but at least she was able to escape the bottom 5

# A Literal Legend

**throwaway-7650** (11): oh wow they really saved the best for last!

# Icon

**anothertown** (10): in another world, slater and ayesha are the audrey kitching and hanna beth of the current day. and what that does for that society is anyone's guess.

**Awkward\_King** (10): "i could give you bjork and i dont think you'd understand it" and she was right hyperballad sucks

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): If you give this song a bad score you’re a certified Figurative Nobody.

**bulforster** (10): ICON

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this has kelly from shoes energy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): EXACTLY

**jman457** (10): This is more cunt than any of the drag race songs in this rate

**lexiaredery** (10): wtf I love this

**Nagisoid** (10): This song has so many hooks Roadhog would be jealous. The beat is insane, Ayesha just knows what to say and in which tone, and everything here is quotable. Truly an icon.

**nt96** (10): Now that’s what I call Slut Pop!

**pig-serpent** (10): Can someone explain to me what a figurative legend would be?

**plastichaxan** (10): This truly altered my brain chemistry I really can’t explain it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): cunt.

**runaway3212** (10): she did what she had to do

**Stryxen** (10): YASSSSSSS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): CUNT!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): you literally are

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): she gave us Björk but did we understand it? Let’s see if Hyper-ballad can win

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): she had one idea for this and proceeded to absolute hit like a sledgehammer. i cackle

**slimboyfriend** (9.7): after seeing how poorly y’all rated this in the unreleased rate…. I must inflate my score

**shipperondeck** (9.6): when she just yells CUNT. so true.

**intheaftermath** (9): yeah it's iconic

**camerinian** (8.5): I hope Ayesha is doing OK and still serving cunt in their world

**imbaby122** (8.2): i could give you riddle but i don’t think you’d understand it - literal legend ft. björk

**cremeebrulee** (8): i am saying cunt way too casually these days, need to get some shame back methinks

**Frajer** (8): sampling the drums from Poison is such a slay

**IIIHenryIII** (8): ok, I’ll say it, she slayed

**ImADudeDuh** (8): fun!

**oscarbrierley1** (8): this song is so obnoxious, but i like it more each time i listen to it.

**seanderlust** (8): so many lines in this make me feel like i need to go lie down. this song is obnoxious in all the right ways

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh, to be in the shoes of a person who makes this their first rate or who only does 1-2 rates other than this, and finishes up with this as their final song

**1998tweety** (7.5): it gave cunt

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): wait…i hear something

**jsonphile** (7): THAT GIRL IS POISON

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): this is cacophonous but there’s some legendary lines

**03O9** (6): i can’t stand her but this song is decent

**phonethephoenix** (6): cool enough

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): Feel like pure shit just want her back x 😢 (jk I hope she's doing fine)

**sarcasticsobs** (5.5): Congrats to songeniality winner and (at the time) 8th most controversial song ever rated on popheads. In honor of your controversy score, I bestow you the 11/0 split score

# what’s TikTok?

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): I don't think she could give us Janet or Bjork

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): how dare she desecrate “Poison” by Bell Viv DeVoe like this

**heysoupie** (2): its giving cheer competition, you know, minus the lyrics

**just\_thonking** (2): It's growing on me!

**bogo** (1): i just really don't get ayesha

**daythreeinmiami** (1): I mean I gave it a higher score this time around.

**frogaranaman** (1): we could have gone without this

**impla77** (1): Its not escaping my zero this time! Wait I forgot about act my age..

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): being racist and having ur music be completely derived from black queer culture is insane

**Roxieloxie** (1): Starting this rate with a song Im considering 11ing and ending with a song im considering 0 is kinda funny

**timothy444** (1): Such an irrirating song that I wanted to turn off ten seconds but ended up listening to the whole thing so I can be fair. Well, I can tell you that that the song gets worse and worse from there and the only saving grace this has is that it's under three minutes long.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): painful to listen to

**NotWith10000Men** (0): i love that i got to listen to the entire rate and end on this one so that i'd know, without a shadow of a doubt, without any second-guessing, without any review at all, that it deserved my 0 <3

**vayyiqra** (0): deeply irritating song

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): She shitted on that Poison beat and then had the nerve to say she could give Janet Jackson, literal legend more like literal hate crimes

**TiltControls** (5): High School Musical was an odd series that was just on the cusp of me not really watching much DCOM stuff any more. Though I really enjoy some of the songs musically, this one is not one of them. Like it’s a fine song in the movie I’m sure, but I would probably never listen to it outside of that (well except for this rate I guess). There was a brief time where this was losing to Chillin Like A Villain which I thought would’ve been hilarious but I guess the rate gods had other plans.

**flava** (2): I Don’t Dance invented homosexuality and deserved to get voted in instead

---

# Just lost a lot of money on a bad bet

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**akanewasright** (10): YASS

**anothertown** (10): i dont think you guys are getting this.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Where was his Oscar?

**cremeebrulee** (10): in this lineup? i fear not

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the day music was born

**frogaranaman** (10): this was so gay

**ignitethephoenix** (10): should have won the rate

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this reveal is gonna be a bloodbath

**ImADudeDuh** (10): he was so dramatically gay for this

**MagiKiwi29** (10): a hit

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): actually one of my fave songs ever like idc…with that being said i don’t dance is ever so slightly better

**phonethephoenix** (10): sorry too iconic for me to give it anything else

**plastichaxan** (10): A classic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I miss good looking zac efron

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song making it in anyway is pure comedy but it was highly correct

**runaway3212** (10): imnotgonnastopnotgonnastoptilligetmyshotthatswhoiamthatismyplanwilliendupontopyoucan

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): he put his whole troyussy in this

**throwaway-7650** (10): seventeen coming for another top 10 placement in 2023 kpop

**timothy444** (10): This is what happens when Disney lets Zac Efron sing in the sequels of High School Musical: you get one of the best Disney Original movie songs you can possibly wish for. This is absolutely the peak of the second movie and is a contender for best High School Musical song ever, if only A Night to Remember and I Want It All didn't exist

**TragicKingdom1** (10): greatest pop&b song of all time?

**Verboten\_Prince** (9.8): It changed my little boy life (not as much as Fabulous though)

**shipperondeck** (9.5): disney pop perfection

**bigbigbee** (9): HSM was one of the first things that I ever considered “cringe” back when I was a kid. Luckily it’s 2023, and cringe is dead! This song rules!!!!

**dreamingpastel** (9): Troy Bolton my favorite drama queen

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): this is a brain off song

**impla77** (9): The tempo changes.. the storyline.. the choreography..

**intheaftermath** (9): i mean it's no Bop To the Top but it's still pretty good

**jasannn** (9): Camp On It

**camerinian** (8.5): dudes rock

**shhhneak** (8.1): If y’all don’t play the Trisha Paytas cover during this reveal…

**daythreeinmiami** (8): If you are not doing power hands right now then you are not listening to this song right.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): I am too old for this, but this did result in good memes and I cannot deny I bopped my head. Let's throw in some bonus points for that

**jsonphile** (7): does this deserve a 10? In the Disney nick rate sure, but not in the big leagues

**ricki** (7): in all honesty this is one of the HSM songs i care the least for… but it’s still iconic cinema i could never tank

**Stryxen** (7): the good hsm song

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): has any character had a better arc than troy?

**pig-serpent** (6.5): I spent so much of my childhood hating on High School Musical, and at this point I don't even know why. Child me is an enigma to current me. Anyway, this song has a certain swagger that kind of makes it bop.

**bluehxrizon** (6): vividly remember watching this when in 2008 and thinking he ate so bad

**CrimsonROSET** (6): aggressively hits the water

**jman457** (5.6): HSM2 is probably my least favorite in the trilogy

**imbaby122** (5.5): all this over basketball and musical theater. or whatever the conflict of the second movie is.

**WaneAllstarToc** (5.5): oh yeah this is y'alls butt rock. don't ask why or how.

# bet on it correctly

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): out of all the songs in this rate y'all pick this shit

**Memezaharamole** (4.8): expected standard for a standard Disney track tbh, I think they peaked with the animated Renaissance era or maybe that's just nostalgia speaking.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): this was truly an era huh

**Awkward\_King** (3): other hsm songs deserved more

**oscarbrierley1** (3): is this hyperpop??? love that its credited as troy and not zac efron, i guess he didnt do his own singing.

**babadork** (2): I still cannot believe that this beat the best HSM song, which everyone knows is “I Can’t Dance.”

**Nagisoid** (2): I relate a bit to this song because it's just as indecisive and chaotic as my brain. It's a mess but not really in a good way and the different elements in the song clash heavily with each other.

**vayyiqra** (2): no

**fadedblue09** (1): we hate men!

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): not letting this one get close to winning again

**thedoctordances1940** (1): so very nothing

**nt96** (0): While I liked a few songs, I've never been a huge fan of HSM entirely. Revisiting them in the LADN rate was truly an experience, and NOT a positive one at that. Maybe it's because I grew up, maybe it's because I can't connect to it without any context to the movie to truly get it, or maybe I don’t have much nostalgia to pull from this franchise. I don’t know. What I do know is that I'm so glad it lost the original rate and I can sleep well knowing it won't get very far here either.

**qazz23** (0): this vocal style is really annoying

**TiltControls** (0): [Oh poor innocent 2022 Tilt](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/704859238563840073/1078479583071981694/image.png). Anyways this song is a mess and not in any fun way. I 0’d Savage in this rate originally, but since it’s not here guess I have to go for the next best thing.

---

# Taste is on the next level

**fadedblue09** (11): I had no idea what I was thinking back then giving this a 2….I'm glad to have been finally enlightened. I hope nævis deems this 11 worthy enough of an offering to atone for my mistake

**runaway3212** (11): my biography writer will dedicate a chapter to when I first heard this song

**1998tweety** (10): when this song came out it was very controversial and kind of panned, but the girls that got it got it and I knew it was a bop. Now everyone switched like [redacteds] and I'm glad to see it.

**akanewasright** (10): best song ever

**anothertown** (10): i'm so tired

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): An all time “the girls who get it get it” song.

**cremeebrulee** (10): it's the best song of all time, the girls who get it get it

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): lives were changed

**IIIHenryIII** (10): as always the girls delivering what the boys can’t

**intheaftermath** (10): it's like the bohemian rhapsody of k-pop... ok i know it's just mostly through-composed but it is still great

**jasannn** (10): it’s crazy how much of an impact they had on Kpop in 2021 just to not take advantage of 2022 properly and fall short compared to new 4th gen toppers (IVE, Le Sserafim, and New Jeans). I believe they can make a resurgence in 2023. sm bias Anyways, stream Dreams Come True <3

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): I’M ONDA. NEXT LEVUHL.

**nootnoot781** (10): still a hit idc

**plastichaxan** (10): It’s no savage but it’ll have to do

**sarcasticsobs** (10): YES, it’s weird and very clunky and that’s why it’s GOOD. They hated me for telling the truth! And okay but the way Winter pronounces “next levuhl”

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I'M ONDA

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): they were truly onda

**throwaway-7650** (10): if I knew this was a lock to be voted in... my MH&MH...

**vayyiqra** (10): "it's just two random songs mashed together into one" yeah and both those songs rule so what's the problem. Insert gif of aespa all shaking their heads at you together for your lack of respect to this total banger. It's next levellllll 제껴라 제껴라 제껴라아아아아

**bluehxrizon** (9): hated this at first but they mothered

**Nagisoid** (9): The discourse this song has is so tiring. Honestly, the rest of the song is not that good compared to the beat drop part, which literally makes me ascend and has enough iconic lines to feed a fanbase for years. While the NAEVIS CALLING part is the main event, the rest of the song is very solid and while it is strange, I think all the song changes add to the song and make it feel very unique and fresh.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): i don't like this song all THAT much but compared to some of the other songs here...

**qazz23** (9): i like the jazzy sound after the beat switch

**Stryxen** (9): aete

**bulforster** (8.8): Savage is better but this making all stars is funnier

**MassiveThief** (8.5): onda (savage deserved)

**jman457** (8.3): I liked the electropop mixed with throwback sounds

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): onda from everglow what are you doing here

**welcome2thejam** (8): I still don't know what a naevis is and at this point I'm too afraid to ask

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): kpop sicko mode?

**imbaby122** (7.8): i don’t understand. i like it tho.

**camerinian** (7.5): it's giving Kevin Rudolph feat. Lil Wayne - Let It Rock (2008)

**03O9** (7): only girls can do kpop sorry i don’t make the rules

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): much better than Savage for me but it’s grown off me.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): me after defeating one of the members of the Freaky Monkey Five

**Birdseeding** (6): what's with the weird middle section?

**phonethephoenix** (5.9): aespa's concepts are cool but their songs never quite do it for me :/

**daythreeinmiami** (5.7): The bridge should have been the whole song.

# Taste is on the nexter level

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): this has never been bad like... theyre ONDA

**timothy444** (5.5): I guess they thought next level means changing the song into something completely different halfway through. Also, the song feels way too slow for me to bop to it because I felt like I was listening to a five minute song

**WaneAllstarToc** (5.5): this is some kind of psyop. an ultimate 0/11 candidate on its absolutely irrational inability to write an actual song. we're in dangerous psychopathic territory with that middle section. a cut like Girls Aloud's Biology reveals how this popcraft CAN work, but the mathematic formula and commercialism of this are haunting shit. not sure whether to cry tears of joy or weep blue orbs of sorrow

**impla77** (5.4): There is so much to unpack here.. the clunky beat drop, the storyline, the fact that this is a remake of a song from Fast and Furious?? And the song still manages to be boring

**Verboten\_Prince** (4.3): Fuck this shit listens to Sticker

**Memezaharamole** (4): that beat switch o_o yeesh

**oscarbrierley1** (4): i was enjoying it until the beat switch

**shhhneak** (4): My Sprigatito at level 15

**CrimsonROSET** (3): :kyliespill:

**nt96** (3): Is there warp pipe somewhere so I can skip this level?

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): this sounds like Let It Rock by that one guy from 2007

**pig-serpent** (2): Aespa are a band that have great ideas and I really want to like them for being kpop Coheed and Cambria, but man, often times their music just isn't interesting. It should be hard to make a song that turns into a different song halfway though boring, and yet...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): savage outsells this song in literally every single way i hate this sub for voting this in

**frogaranaman** (1): k-pop stans will hear the worst song ever made and then set up five dedicated member update accounts on Twitter

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): genuinely these girls made me lose hope for the Kpop industry, like they were when I realized that it wasn’t a safe space for me anymore

# taste is on the nextest level

**bogo** (0): i'm done with this stupid fucking song

**DirtyRat583** (0): credit where credits due this instrumental is really good. if you threw aespa away and gave the beat to someone else it would be amazing

**dreamingpastel** (0): It's such a boring chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I'm on the next level of taste and you are all falling behind

**Roxieloxie** (0): I thought I was free from hearing aespa

**shipperondeck** (0): the genre switch halfway through is insulting to music

**TiltControls** (6): With the knowledge this was flopping a good portion of the rate maybe I should’ve given a warning for the men’s rate. I’ve seen a ton of praise for this song and although I completely get it, I just don’t enjoy listening to this one much compared to a bunch of his other tracks. Still, never would’ve guessed this was bound for the bottom 10.

**flava** (3): this doesn’t anger me, I’m more left perplexed why people think this is good, but I probably just don’t really get Bad Bunny

# good bunny

**akanewasright** (10): best song ever!!!!

**bigbigbee** (10): when you hear this song you goddamn stand and salute

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the right song won idc (2)

**frogaranaman** (10): y’all get so weird about sex on this sub

**IIIHenryIII** (10): another song I did dirty, this shit is so fucking great

**ImADudeDuh** (10): he can throw my phone because he made this song idc idc

**plastichaxan** (10): Maybe I do regret sending this I will be having a breakdown as you guys read this on day 1

**ricki** (10): giving you a 10 but im not happy about… not because you dont deserve it… but because we all know you shouldnt be here…

**Roxieloxie** (10): slay music

**sarcasticsobs** (10): BEAT. SWITCHES. GOD, I love Bad Bunny's vocal timbre so much

**seanderlust** (10): if WAP was hyperpop and exclusively in spanish. and was performed by men. and took influence from reggaet- okay fine it's a fully different song but you get what i mean

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this sample is cheating, the rest of it bops too, how did this not win

**vayyiqra** (10): dude rocks

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): why do they keep trying to cancel noted punk rock icon Bad Bunny!?!?! dude's just trying to vibe in his bedroom and the girl is coming without panties!! smh bad bunny is (if god permits) a chaste ace and all da fans know that!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Love a multipart smasha

**babadork** (9.5): This is an absolutely epic megamix of a song that I can’t imagine being replicated any time soon. Mostly because you do have to pay people for all of those samples.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): this was my 11 in the rate cuz I got into the hype of Safaera and deeply regret not 11-ing Yo Perreo Sola. This has grown off me slightly but still just a great mixtape jam to so many classics

**heysoupie** (9.4): so fun

**bogo** (9): this is unbelievably horny and dirty and i'm here for it

**Stryxen** (9): i found myself twerking

**jman457** (8.4): the production on this was kind of insane. What a journey.

**camerinian** (8): fuck yes an unpredictable banger

**Frajer** (8): Bad Bunny is an agent of chaos and I respect that

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this songs placement will prove why bad bunny in ult was never going to work

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**shipperondeck** (7.5): fun

**imbaby122** (7.3): i’m not super familiar with bad bunny but i didn’t expect this song to be five minutes long. that’s like ava max making a 5 minute long song.

**phonethephoenix** (7.1): like the beat!

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): ignoring these lyrics bc the instrumental is a bop #yass

**pig-serpent** (7): I love the prog aspect but I'm just left wishing the good sections of this song were their own songs and that I didn't have to listen to the bad parts. That said, the more I listen to this the more I appreciate every section of the song and there are fewer parts I want to skip.

**qazz23** (7): good variety of sounds but feels a bit all over the place

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.8): I always think I'll like Bad Bunny in theory and then I actually listen to his music and have second thoughts

**Awkward\_King** (6): by the time these results are out i will hopefully have stockholmed myself into liking this and wish i had raised it

**dreamingpastel** (6): Was that the Jaws theme or was that just my imagination?

**fadedblue09** (6): Kinda relieved this didn't win, sorry. It's fun for one listen, but it's also really overwhelming

# bad bunny

**intheaftermath** (5): there is just nothing in this genre for me and the vocal performances aren't strong enough to make me feel otherwise.

**03O9** (4.5): the structure of this song is a mess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): look im sorry but theres no other way to say it i fucking hate the lyrics of this, im normally alright with lyrics being so explicitly sexual but this just takes it way to far and makes me genuinely uncomfortable. i know that the lyrics are what a lot of people like about it and im sure im gonna get bullied relentlessly for having this opinion (id honestly rate this even lower if i wasnt scared of even more pushback) but i would also to, you know. not feel dehumanized listening to a song about men treating women like literal objects.

**Birdseeding** (4): How can a track with so many amazing historical references be so messy and bland?

**timothy444** (4): At least despacito has the decency to not change tempo of a song every thirty seconds. It's certainly not boring and kind of interesting but at the same time, it sounds like one of those amateur wedding dance mixes where nothing is consistent and you don't know exactly what the hell is going on. For songs like this, it has to have that feeling of epicness for the beat switches to work but this was not it. But hey, at least it's not as boring as the 2021 Indie Women rate.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): this song had like 20 different parts and not a single one of them was interesting

**shhhneak** (2.3): I’m sure I would enjoy this more if I was in an environment that didn’t involve me binging music for a deadline!

**Nagisoid** (2): This song is held in very high regard that I never understood. I think it is trying to justify its existence with all the samples and beat switches, but it all falls flat for me. Anyways, I do not like this at all, and each time the song changes I like it a little bit less, plus this got so overplayed and being forced to listen to this just made it worse. I would probably actually enjoy this if Spanish wasn't my first language and if there weren't other reggaeton songs I enjoyed much more than this. I just don't get the acclaim... some parts I enjoy a bit but not the song as a whole. It's pretty much opposite to my taste in every way possible.

**throwaway-7650** (2): it grew off again

**Uberpigeon** (2): until this moment i thought safaera was a name of an artist in this rate...... huh.

**daythreeinmiami** (1): Well I guess just pack me up and put me in the nursing home because I do not understand how the kids like this.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (0): I don't care about the talents on display because I loathe how this track sounds and how excruciatingly long it is

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I know everybody roasted me for giving this a 0 the first time around but I won’t succumb to bullying

**TiltControls** (10): I really wish I 11’d this in 2018 Indie cause there was no chance of it doing well here. Still, I probably would’ve left it forgotten in that rate if not for being sent to All Stars so thanks to the hosts for having the guts to send a 10 minute+ song in.

**flava** (9): a song that grew on me a fair bit since we originally rated it and I was cool with rating it again. Apparently no one else was since this finished bottom 10 and just scraped a 7+ average by. Look I know we blocked the hosts from sending Little Dark Age, and not every host wants to send a song from the winner, and this did really well for an 11 minute song, but like. IT’S STILL AN 11 MINUTE SONG, and it got sent. What did you think was gonna happen… also Night Time was right there

---

# a point for every minute this song has

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): one points for each minute of this track mwah

# Jake gyllenhaal fan club

**akanewasright** (10): you know what, yeah

**bogo** (10): it's everything

**CrimsonROSET** (10): who tf is donnie darko

**IIIHenryIII** (10): great movies should always inspire great music

**just\_thonking** (10): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Let's Eat Grandma. The production is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of punctuation jokes most of the lyrics will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also LEG's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into their lyricism- their personal philosophy draws heavily from Jake Gyllenhaal movies, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these lyrics, to realise that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Let's Eat Grandma truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the profundity in Hot Pink's existential catchphrase "HAWT PENK" which itself is a cryptic reference to Miles Davis's epic Kind of Blue. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as LEG's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 /////And yes, by the way, i DO have an I'm All Ears tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

**phonethephoenix** (10): this is an excellent song

**plastichaxan** (10): I just think it’s the best song ever even if I’ve said this about a bunch of songs in this rate

**RandomHypnotica** (10): look, we knew what we were doing sending this, but honestly? It's just such an iconic song, such a moment, it absolutely deserved the spotlight once again.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Oh I was NOT on board until like 3:30 in. Why did they make me wait that long to have fun? Anyways it got better and better and better as it went on. Well done

**Stryxen** (10): my comment last time was Length Appropriate. I will just say Bop! this time

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I will not check the results because I do not want to see this go out at 38th with a 7.232 average

**throwaway-7650** (10): this was sooo close to stealing the 11

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): once on a train ride up to school I had to sit with people and we all traded what our major was and they asked if I had seen donnie darko. no i don't like bro cinema. end of that story. Anyways, LEG didn't have to do this; like no one said "okay the teens got their grant money to make a 12 minute cut". This is a song that goes nowhere. It practically stays in the bedroom in a diary. Yet from there we go everywhere. Donnie Darko encapsulates the bleeding heart MO of I'm All Ears far better than it intended. Pretty much any sound the duo had touched shows up here, spread out through a multilayered, just bleakly honest heart-to-heart about self-worth and mental demons. Everything shines, even if the disco floor feels damn near empty when the four on the floor comes in and we have a brutal monologue of cathartic, pained imagery. It has to survive though, I suppose it holds on tight because we do as well.

**jman457** (9.5): really epic track

**1998tweety** (9): they made a singular point with this

**pig-serpent** (9): Congrats to everyone who memed this song into me liking it. I now go full days with "buh BWA bum, ba ba baaaa dadada" stuck in my head.

**camerinian** (8.5): you'd think that one hammered piano chord would get irritating after 11 minutes but honestly

**qazz23** (8): good synth breakdown, the ending is amazing

**slimboyfriend** (8): noine noine noine

**anothertown** (7.5): i prefer cool and collected which has less waiting around for something to happen but i support the right to make 10min songs

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): fuck this fucking song for stockholming me

**shipperondeck** (7): i thought this was gonna drag but it never felt that way, so thats cool

**intheaftermath** (5): i was really getting into this but I just can't vibe with the vocals :(

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): the first 5 or so minutes were good but after that it was just…yeah

# bad bunny

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4.5): i've tried to like this song but i just can't

**ignitethephoenix** (4): people who support this song are the same people who write essays and then struggle to cut back to meet the word limit because they think they are removing important info, but in reality they have a lot of filler they can remove to get the same content

**fadedblue09** (3): sorry y'all I really disliked their voices. Tried my best not to tank them hard in the original rate

**babadork** (2): I would really appreciate it if popheads could stop trying to convince me to like Let’s Eat Grandma. I like from 3:30-4:22, 6:35-7:06, and 7:48-8:40.

**MassiveThief** (2): yyeeaaahhh this was just really boring unfortunately :(

# tk should’ve sent dopesmoker to AS5, just so these people know the definition of long

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We love this song. We love all 11 minutes 19 seconds of it.

**DirtyRat583** (10): didnt know they made xxxxxxxxl songs. i love it

**Nagisoid** (10): This song is a masterclass in long songs. Sure, it's strange and changes structure a lot, but the lyrics and instrumentation all glue it together into a coherent whole that's one of the best prog pop tracks of this decade.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): you guys are SICK for sending an 11 minute song to all stars donnie darko doesnt deserve what's about to happen to it

**vayyiqra** (10): a perfect song and true epic that ended longsongphobia for good! [citation needed] so anyway, if you gave this a bad score: 28 days, 6 hours, 42 minutes and 12 seconds. that is when [your] world will end. 😐

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh boy, eleven minutes!

**runaway3212** (9): this is wayyyy tooo long but its a bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.7): Sorry if you're gonna make me listen to a long ass song it better be not just alright but AMAZING. This was just alright…

**imbaby122** (7.5): this song has grown on me but it’s still wayyyyy too long. i have adhd you can’t expect to pay attention for that long.

**jsonphile** (7): this is the first time I’ve ever listened to let’s eat grandma and you give me an 11 minute song???

**PrimaryCrusaders** (5): Takes a while for it to reach its apex (seriously why is it 11 minutes long) but other than that, it's okay

**impla77** (4.5): ‘I’ve wanted to take back what I’ve said before’- Me but not about saying this song is too fucking long

**daythreeinmiami** (4.2): This whole time I thought the lead singer of this band was a man so lemme tell ya hearing that soft voice come in threw me off my game. But bitch this is OVER 11 minutes long? Of the same dododo, dododoodoo of the piano? Bruh.

**Birdseeding** (3): I had this written down as "tedious" after 5 minutes but then I checked and it's bloody 11 minutes long! A tip from a disco fan: if you're going to keep going forever, you need to establish a groove, not sound like elevator music

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): that was not worth my time

**timothy444** (3): Way too long, way too boring

**oscarbrierley1** (2): eleven minutes??? i like long songs, but this is too much. if the slow section at the start was shorter i'd like it more

**frogaranaman** (1): meandering

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I don’t have TIME for this again

**Around-town** (0): so long so grating

**bluehxrizon** (0): lets eat grandma are occasionally genius but this sounds like they chose a bunch of random apple loops and let it play for 12 minutes

**ricki** (0): fuck you and your long ass song

# yeah it’d be a real shame if we played that video again in the reveal 

**bulforster** (10): the 1 can be removed for (Taylor's Version)

**cremeebrulee** (10): i can no longer untangle this song from atwtmvtvftv i hope you are happy now benjnotica

**Roxieloxie** (1.4): I think alot of my annoyance with this song is one that it was the second long ass song for no reason on this album but also the fact that the host put the atw video over this which meant that the most annoying discourse broke out in queup for 11 minutes. Idk if that last thing is a factor but dear god why do i have to listen to this again

# i set a timer and you are [edit in right or wrong after getting that info]

**shhhneak** (4): This song is longer than the length of time Ava Max will be in this rate

**TiltControls** (7): And so we’ve got our first rate fully out. Neither rateggaeton song did super well during the ballot period so this wasn’t exactly a sudden shift, but it is still pretty surprising. I don’t even know if anyone had that much issue with this song, I think it just didn’t inspire many high scores either. It ended up with the lowest number of 10s in the rate. There were a few Karol G songs I really loved from the rate (including my 11), but this one I was a little more neutral on. So while I’m a bit confused to see it go, I’m not super annoyed.

**flava** (5): well one rate did have to be our first rate out, and unfortunately the rate gods decided that rate was to be Rateggaeton, idk I think LADNC really deserved that title more tbh

---

# las buenas puntuaciones

**akanewasright** (10): I might’ve 11d this if I had a few more weeks for rateggaeton honestly… like it grew on me as it went out in the reveal

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): Reggaetón is just so easy for me to like

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I’ve gotten a lot better at seeking out and enjoying non-English music over the past year and I have rates to thank for a lot of that!

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): uhhh pues

**Overall Average**: 7.079 **// Average Controversy:** 2.197

TiltControls: And there goes the first rate to leave. There were numerous rates that I thought could’ve been taking this spot, but I don’t think I ever thought it’d be Rateggaeton. Hopefully that won’t dissuade us from doing more rates from genres we typically ignore cause while I didn’t care too much for the two songs here, I really did enjoy discovering a lot of stuff in that rate. Poppy did a fantastic job with hosting here (as well as with the 2 other rates they still have in)

**WaneAllstarToc** (10.000): I keep thinking of Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and the scene where they're driving around Tokyo highways and they say "Reggaeton". this was the first time this was prolly acknowledged as an actual "thing" in American pop culture. Which for 2006, shows you both how absolutely ahead of its time Tokyo Drift was, as much as how bleakly our pop culture apparatus is running on empty, unable to accept a sound a generation ago. great cuts is what im trying to say, as much as a genuine feeling that while k-pop tries to desperately integrate trap and drill (without the regional swagger developed yet) years well after it should'vbe, I foresee reggaeton as the Pop Sound of the 2020s.

**plastichaxan** (10.000): I wanted to list xenophobic popheads acts but I got overwhelmed thinking of the ones to come when we rate Un Verano Sin Ti

**cremeebrulee** (10.000): music for hot people

**akanewasright** (10.000): this rate deserved so much better (especially karol g and safaera)

**sarcasticsobs** (9.750): I frickin' should've done this frickin' rate but I FORGOT

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.750): y’all should have done this rate, you cowards

**nt96** (9.500): Karol G deserved so much better.

**Roxieloxie** (9.250): hot people music

**vayyiqra** (9.000): I didn't do this rate. Sad!

**bigbigbee** (8.750): I LOVED THIS RATE! I love it when I find out that I love a music genre that I previously knew nothing about. TY so much frogaranaman and plastichaxan for making this rate happen - genuinely, you influenced my life with this one!

**Stryxen** (8.500): condragulations mi gente

**ImADudeDuh** (8.500): not this happening during phonegate

**IIIHenryIII** (8.500): I still don’t understand how popheads don’t love Déjalos Que Miren, that song is such a bop

**fadedblue09** (7.250): This was a fun entry point to a genre I had little knowledge on. That being said, I still don't get the appeal of Bad Bunny and I'm probably in the minority who liked his album the least

**DirtyRat583** (6.500): ok i see why yo perreo solo won

**throwaway-7650** (6.000): poppy I'm so sorry for the safaera score forgive me pleek

**TiltControls** (8.2): Though a lot of drag rate music was very… drag race, Banjo was one of the ones that feels like it could’ve stood alone. Unfortunately that didn’t help it much here as it yet again falls short to ~~Priyanka and~~ Lemon, like it did originally.

**flava** (2.5): I guess I should be more upset this is the closest we get to a country song in AS6 but like, look at my score, idc

---

# fans of country music

**1998tweety** (10): she kinda devoured this ngl

**akanewasright** (10): FLABSTER!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): god i hope this song does well.. if it makes day two id consider that a massive win, its such a gorgeous, lighthearted afrobeat song made by a queer person as well like <333

**CrimsonROSET** (10): fifteen feet queen of social distancing

**DirtyRat583** (10): the water of life tastes how this sounds

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this song transcends drag music

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): please make the top ten please make the top ten please make the top ten

**plastichaxan** (10): Bebe Zahara Benet you will always be famous

**shhhneak** (10): This is probably in my top ten most viewed music videos thanks to the twitch streamer that would e lee gull e stream Drag Race episodes during the early quarantine.

**Stryxen** (10): mother

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song just makes me really happy :)

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): so FUCKING real for this

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): grimes beating that one dude up:

**camerinian** (9.5): proud to give this the coveted title of "if I didn't know this song prior and I put this rate on shuffle, I probably wouldn't assume it was made by a Ru girl"

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): the irony of this song starting to... drag... a bit

**frogaranaman** (9): Bebe my beloved

**impla77** (9): My biggest pet peeve is RPDR fans thinking Bebe wouldn’t MOTHER an All Winners

**phonethephoenix** (9): this song has been stuck in my head now

**qazz23** (9): good percussion and horns, quite catchy

**Roxieloxie** (9): I remember joining the reveal and asking people what i should root for and someone said this and so i did, of course it went out but its really nice, love how it sounds

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): Another fun beat from this rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.2): I came around to the power of the banjo

**bogo** (8): excellence

**daythreeinmiami** (8): The more this played the more it grew on me. I think I’m loving it.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): where’s the banjo though?

**ImADudeDuh** (8): idg why this got praised so much in the original rate but it is good

**welcome2thejam** (8): Instrumental's hitting a lot more this time around

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): bop

**NotWith10000Men** (7.7): this is so calming

**timothy444** (7.5): With a little bit of a tropical house flair and europop, this would fit right in as a modern Eurovision entry

**jman457** (7.4): a cute afro-inspired song

**Nagisoid** (7): This probably manifested Banjo & Kazooie into Smash. Extremely catchy if basic, but there's nothing wrong with that.

**oscarbrierley1** (7): well produced and pretty unique for a drag race contestant song

**imbaby122** (6.5): banjo doesn’t sound like a word anymore.

**runaway3212** (6.5): I love banjo’s

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is cute but there’s something about the mixing that makes it sound weird to my ears. It’s like she’s singing directly into my brain.

**lexiaredery** (5): It's alright but I can't really get into it

# Hawmophobic

**Birdseeding** (4): I love our original Drag Superstar, and a bit of makossa, but this is tame as hell

**thedoctordances1940** (4): it's a competent song but that only gets it a pass when it's being compared to other songs in drag rate, in this competition it feels a bit out of its depth, I was just pretty bored by the end

**vayyiqra** (4): not in the mood for this at 07:30 on a monday

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): just kinda boring and drags on for forever omfg

**pig-serpent** (2): This sounds like a youtube advertisement for a South African dream home sweepstakes, and it's so long for what it is.

**intheaftermath** (0): my god this was rough. The instrumental was brutal. The lyrics about an instrument were brutal. The vocals were campy but that didn't mean I enjoyed them.

**TiltControls** (9.7): For a little bit this song was seeing as high as mid day 2. Unfortunately a few ballots near the end kept bringing it further down which left it here. This score is probably 100% purely nostalgia. The kids I used to babysit (I actually wasn’t that much older than them, it was more to keep them out of trouble and help them beat video game levels they had trouble with) used to watch this show a lot so I have some nostalgia for the track despite it being slightly past my time. Plus it helps that everything Miranda Cosgrove touches turns to gold (flava dni)

**flava** (9.5): a major slay moment in the rate and proof that Nickelodeon do have good songs, sometimes, just ignore the guy, thankfully this got sent over the other song that I would’ve vetoed  (tilt dni)

# sad to see it leave

**Around-town** (11): You may not like it, but this is what peak pop sounds like.

**03O9** (10): i think all other songs should be a little embarrassed 🤭

**1998tweety** (10): ate

**bigbigbee** (10): legitimately just a really nice, uplifting song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It feels kind of weird to give these Disney/Nick songs 10’s alongside some of the most beloved and acclaimed songs of all time…but when it’s right it’s right.

**cremeebrulee** (10): "live life breathe air" i got asthma but i'm really trying for you miranda

**CrimsonROSET** (10): if i was rating these songs by which brings me the most joy this would be the 11

**fadedblue09** (10): just so iconic and deserved my 11 in hindsight

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I owe it to my childhood

**hikk** (10): real music

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love me some crumbs

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Thinking about the tiktok of the girl who read the lyrics of this song to her grandma and pretended like she wrote a poem for her graduation and the grandma started crying

**intheaftermath** (10): no thoughts just iCarly DS Final Boss

**MassiveThief** (10): oh man my nostalgia is clouding my brain but this BANGS

**Nagisoid** (10): I still can't get over that YouTube comment about how this song is secretly communist. Jokes aside, this is pop perfection and heavily nostalgic for me. I'm basing this more off the intro version rather than the album version, as I think the TV ver. works better, but both are really good.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): everyone wishes they could be as memorable as this

**ricki** (10): could you imagine if tiktok had been a thing back when icarly was airing? lawd

**Roxieloxie** (10): So many things about this show did not age well in general and also for me but this theme song still gets me so pumped up

**shhhneak** (10): This song uses the same trick as Christmas music to make it so earwormy.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i love a song sung by miranda cosgrove and miranda cosgrove only

**throwaway-7650** (10): drake bell can't keep getting away with this ugh

**TragicKingdom1** (10): greatest pop/rock song of all time?

**Stryxen** (9): served it all to me

**timothy444** (9): Seeing '(feat. Drake Bell)' on the Spotify title is such a jumpscare but hey, that's iCarly for ya. It's probably the "Loud House" of live action Nickelodeon shows.

**jman457** (8.7): Miss Miranda rights had bops for days

**bogo** (8): boatloads of nostalgia on this one

**DirtyRat583** (8): camp

**ignitethephoenix** (8): she snapped here

**pig-serpent** (8): This song sound so weird with the pre-chorus left in.

**WaneAllstarToc** (8): the cheers - everybody knows your name of Nickelodeon live action during the hollowfication period. did anyone ever get pre-2008 nicktoons? that channel was doing the 90s nick so good. also damn never got to see hot shit crazy nick @ night...look, streaming sucks because it doesn't create options for syndication (yet) which is how generational culture gets passed off. anyways we're getting off track i liked ned's declassified never got into iCarly but great ditty. descendants one is transcendent though so just an 8!

**impla77** (7.7): I guess this was the slayest theme tune.. except Phineas and Ferb ofc

**Frajer** (7.5): I have complicated feelings about iCarly but this song undeniably slaps

**anothertown** (7): live life 😃 breathe air 😝

**imbaby122** (7): when miranda cosgrove stopped making music all of the pop girls let out a sigh of relief

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): bop tbh

**phonethephoenix** (7): the worst part is that I will think about this song for weeks to come

**runaway3212** (7): iconic but bad

**Uberpigeon** (7): miranda cosgrobve

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): She said "wake up" and I'm woke

**NotWith10000Men** (6.8): 'live life breathe air' are some lyrics huh

**MagiKiwi29** (6.4): not meant to be listented to for more than 30 seconds as an opening I'm afraid

**Awkward\_King** (6): live life breathe air... is she an alien

**daythreeinmiami** (6): I dunno fam, I read Jenette’s book. This doesn’t hit as hard as it once did.

**jsonphile** (6): puts the bop in kidz bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6): Would've been at least 1-and-½ points higher if not for the obvious elephants in the room

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Idk, it's great for a TV show theme song length, not so much as a full song

# because of me

**Birdseeding** (5): Solid musical theatre mid-act song

**camerinian** (5): someone please show me what went wrong in my life that I've ended up in my mid-20s willingly listening and giving a critical rating to the iCarly theme song in my spare time

**plastichaxan** (5): This got too far last time… Never again

**lexiaredery** (4): I don't like the chimes

**vayyiqra** (4): lol

**seanderlust** (3.5): smiling politely

**shipperondeck** (2): make this a bonus song in anime ops rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I have no nostalgia for this show so this song without that is honestly so lame

**Memezaharamole** (1): I'd like to read 'I'm Glad My Mom Died' one day in the future

**babadork** (0): I want to get seeing Drake Bell’s face and hearing his voice over with as soon as possible.

**ImADudeDuh** (10.000): hosting this rate was so much fun honestly. Also, we LOVE it when your 11 wins a rate and you don’t even have to rig it.

**Roxieloxie** (10.000): Probably my second favorite rate this year in terms of just one I had the most fun doing, the results were terrible and we will get he could be the one its revenge though

**throwaway-7650** (9.500): calling all the monsters ROBBED

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.933): Thanks popheads for making me feel young again (I'm in my mid-20s)

**bigbigbee** (8.833): one of the best rates ever, adored it, we should do more like this

**IIIHenryIII** (8.333): another fun rate I missed, but I still feel entitled to complain: what the hell were those results? this is me, make it shine, breakthrough… all deserved top 10. And not Lemonade Mouth being robbed…

**WaneAllstarToc** (7.833): what da fuck was this rate? was it worth it for this? is this y'all nü-metal/butt rock rewrite equivalent? the descendants (not pop punk sst band which cracks me up)

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.667): this rate was soooo fun and hsm best movie trilogy ever btw

**DirtyRat583** (7.333): the land acronym is actually genius

**fadedblue09** (7.000): very fun rate, made me go into Disney/Nick rabbit hole for a bit

**nt96** (6.000): There were some really good songs on this rate but all in all, I'm glad I grew up on Cartoon Network. Also, What's My Name was viciously ROBBED!

**sarcasticsobs** (5.667): I did not do this rate for a reason tbh

**vayyiqra** (5.333): this rate is a fever dream did this even happen

**plastichaxan** (5.333): This was so full of classics idk what happened with the picks sob

**akanewasright** (5.000): this was one of the most unpleasant reveals of the year. Like the hosts slayed, but it felt like there were people who had fun and then there were people who did the rate to be mean and unpleasant, and that was just depressing

**TiltControls** (10): It wasn’t til near the end of the rate where this dropped down to day 1 and it pained me to see it keep dropping! It’s just a bundle of joy in song form and is extremely catchy to sing along to. Looks like it’s never getting that single now.

**flava** (9): and in quick succession we lose 3 rates already, it’s a shot of sugar of a song that was slowly dipped down to day 1 with each ballot coming in. No Control was robbed so incredibly hard and I’m sad to see them go

---

# they had no control but to give this their 11

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): nobody look at me nobody fucking look at me I’m a MONSTER

**Roxieloxie** (11): THE SMASHA AAAAAAAAAA ROBBED OF WINNING AND I WILL NEVER FORGIVE YOU ALL

# [i just wanted to share this post roxie sent me since we couldn’t fit it in the reveal](https://scienceandmagic.tumblr.com/post/709729609053241344/besturlonhere-tsarcasm-everythingbutlarry)

**1998tweety** (10): when this chorus hits I ASCEND

**akanewasright** (10): BEST SONG EVER OMG

**Awkward\_King** (10): i get down on my knees every night and pray to roxieloxie

**bigbigbee** (10): OMG! Da best song ever!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Still love Night Changes but I can see now why people wanted this to win so badly.

**bogo** (10): deserved to win tbh

**cremeebrulee** (10): a song about not being able to keep it in your pants can be something so personal,

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the right song won idc

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I finally get this song now

**dreamingpastel** (10): Forever thinking about how directioners campaigned so hard for No Control to be a single, to the point where someone storyboarded an entire music video for it, and the closest thing we got to promo was Carpool Karaoke with James Corden.

**frogaranaman** (10): great karaoke song

**hikk** (10): one of my fave rate discoveries from this year

**ignitethephoenix** (10): can I manifest a day 2 for this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): normalize male friendships

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): guys it’s not too late to make this a single i think we stand a chance now

**nootnoot781** (10): they can have a 10 as a treat for the 0 i gave them in all winners 😘

**RandomHypnotica** (10): god this would've been such a slay winner

**ricki** (10): me realizing i sent fancy to this rate so i wont be able to 11 this

**throwaway-7650** (10): former 11s count: 1D will be robbed 😡

**timothy444** (10): Gave this a 10 in the last rate and will give it a 10 again! An amazing bloody bop that should've been released as a single

**Uberpigeon** (10): god damn it why is this bopping

**intheaftermath** (9): ok so. My sister is obsessed with Harry Styles. I generally do not get along well with this sister (princeton sister, for those of you around for that saga). Anyways, this sister almost got me in a car accident for ripping audio cables out of my car to stop my "depressing, alternative" music (Greedy by Ariana Grande) so she could play One Direction. I will never let her know that I actually think this is an insanely good song. She can pry that (along with my car's weird audio system) out of my cold, dead hands.

**vayyiqra** (9): Shoutout to Hailey from Popheads who loved this song ("stream no control song of the century") and is now long gone ... but I remember ... 😔

**slimboyfriend** (8.8): the power of one direction lies in their ability to weaponize tens of thousands of teenage girls to scream “waking up beside you I’m a loaded gun” live in unison

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8.5): oh wow an unexpected slay

**pig-serpent** (8.5): This is exactly the type of song I want to hear when I'm in the mood for cheesy pop rock.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): ok fine maybe the directioners were right

**just\_thonking** (8): easily clears night changes

**plastichaxan** (8): Fun

**WaneAllstarToc** (8): reminds me of the good |-/ ditty i gave an 11 to.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Perhaps I underestimated you

**babadork** (7.7): This song isn’t good, but it makes me happy. Everyone sounding kind of terrible except for Zayn’s great bridge somehow adds to the charm. I dunno. If Louis’ solo songs were all him scream singing about erections, I might actually listen to one of them.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): damn am i gonna have to listen to a 1d album?

**Stryxen** (7.5): the chorus is so good waitttt

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.4): Okay I apologize, giving this a 4 was a bit too harsh from me. It's definitely not anywhere close to the worst songs from this rate that's for sure…

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.2): why werent they playing this over like, Best Song Ever. this is actually good

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Well if I ever wanted to know what ‘Locked Out of Heaven’ by Bruno Mars would sound like if it was ever done by a boy band, I now know. Ugh I can tell that chorus is going to get stuck in my head. That is a strong chorus.

**jman457** (7): This is actually kind of good

**phonethephoenix** (6.8): liked this one more than I thought i would!

**Frajer** (6): do that not miss that era where pop songs had to be vaguely rock and roll

**IIIHenryIII** (6): the chorus is the only good thing here

**oscarbrierley1** (6): its whatever, generic, idc abut it.

**sarcasticsobs** (6): I'm too old for this. Have nothing bad to say though. Zayn voice good.

# The Wanted stans

**imbaby122** (5.5): idk what’s more embarrassing. having this song show up in my last.fm stats or the fact that i actually kind of like it…

**seanderlust** (5.5): 1D really made a song about not being able to keep it in their American Eagle-branded jeans, huh.

**thedoctordances1940** (5): yeah ok this really just exists doesn't it

**Nagisoid** (3): This kinda sounds like a Strokes song if it was made by the Twinkle Twinkle Little Bitch girl. Like, the instrumental is pretty good during the verses but it all goes downhill in the chorus, and the lyrics are embarrassing.

**qazz23** (3): don't care for the vocals

**shipperondeck** (3): can't believe i let fans of this music bully me in middle school

**anothertown** (2): louis stans won i guess

**Birdseeding** (2): The verses from Tragedy as the chorus? Lazy

**runaway3212** (2): this outplacing all of the vamps my joker origin story

**LesApfels** (1): This score is a trauma response

**Memezaharamole** (1): faux indie vibes

TiltControls: # 2014 Y/N Boy Bands

---

**Overall Average**: 6.072 **// Average Controversy:** 2.782

---

**TiltControls:** I’m going to be honest that I mostly voted for this rate so we could rate Four. And though I wasn’t the biggest fan of the other albums there were a few solid songs hidden in their tracklists! Guess it makes sense that we got two 1D songs since I doubt either of the other two would’ve made it out of the bottom 5 anyways but I suppose we’ll never know (until some masochist decides to send Girls On TV to Redemption 5: Rate O’ Ween)

**flava:** a rate I never got to do originally, and maybe I’m blessed since apparently that The Vamps album is horrid. But I would’ve gotten an 11 win with Night Changes and I do like 11 wins. I also just think it’s hilarious a day 2 song left before two bottom 2 songs, I’m sorry.

---

**Roxieloxie** (10.500): I could lie and pretend like this wasnt my favorite rate of the year but I wont, it was. Even if everyone else took it as the token 'bad music/low brow' rate I loved it so much. There was something really nice about getting to the point of seeing people !np songs and realize that there were alot of good songs on them and it wasnt just 'bad teen girl music' and the few moments I got with that made it worth it.

**throwaway-7650** (10.000): DON'T STOP MASSIVELY ROBBED OF A SPOT 😡

**MoonlightByWindow** (10.000): one of my fave rates from last year ugh it was so fun opening that time capsule

**cremeebrulee** (10.000): i just know the 10+ avg portion here is good company

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10.000): better than the indieheads britpop rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.500): The Vamps and 5SOS getting no songs in All Stars is kind of iconic but “Voodoo Doll” deserved

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.000): again, these excursions seem to exist so roxie can do a giant ARG or lore thing. it's like a sgc2c joke taken too far for me (and i love this kind of shit!). fortunately the most "yeah this is fun" cuts are here

**Stryxen** (8.750): condragulations that one 5sos song I liked and can't remember

**vayyiqra** (8.500): lol I didn't do this rate

**bigbigbee** (8.500): I think that a common conception about boy groups like this is that listeners are imagining themselves getting serenaded by 1D/5SOS/The Vamps on these songs? but that’s just not true for me. I am fully self-inserting when I listen to these. I Am One Direction, and you can’t stop me

**ImADudeDuh** (8.500): I’ve never seen a rate more designed for us to rate one artist and the AS6 picks really prove that

**akanewasright** (7.500): OVERHATED!!!!

**DirtyRat583** (7.000): what did u do with the rest of the bands 😭😭

**plastichaxan** (6.500): Ah yes, the rate with One Direction and uh…

**IIIHenryIII** (5.000): I still feel bad for The Vamps

**fadedblue09** (3.750): Sending 2 songs from the same artist (and the winning artist, no less!). ricki is such an icon for this…I aspire to be this level of camp as a rate host

**TiltControls** (8.7): I really loved discovering this song during Charity Rate IV but I still have no idea why this made it lol. I’m not too mad since I gave it a good score with really strong competition, but with the others I at least understood the campness of it. Though I guess this can be Kinoko Teikoku’s reward for managing two different users to send songs.

**flava** (8.5): idk what this is doing here but slay

---

# what is this doing here?

**bogo** (8): odd pick but i respect it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is such a random pick for an all stars rate sbhainjfhugjs. anyway when are we getting a full japanese language rate? vote vocaloid rate

**akanewasright** (7): this is nice but I’m confused as to why it’s here

**camerinian** (5): literally who is this an all star to

**shipperondeck** (4): stop making me listen to these people

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): How did y’all finesse these people into so many rates, and also, why?

# the other song from them was better

**throwaway-7650** (10): WH1REPOO1 (but we still love u/CarlieScion regardless) [edit: ok ic how WH1REPOO1 looks like wh*re poo!]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Slay but where is Whirlpool.

**pig-serpent** (8.5): This isn't Whirlpool

**jman457** (8.2): Y’all should have picked the other Kinoko Teikoku song

**welcome2thejam** (8): Not my WHIREPOOL, but still solid

**thedoctordances1940** (7): why tf was this picked ahead of whirlpool?????

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): we kinda wanted the other kinoko song

# everyone else

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I have no idea what she’s saying but I’m feeling every single word

**1998tweety** (10): literal pop perfection but y'all will send this out day 1 cause its not English [3]

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): slay slay slay

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this is so sweet

**frogaranaman** (10): I’m becoming an underground Japanese + Korean shoegaze guy now, sorry

**phonethephoenix** (10): great vibe :)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): YO who sent this band to a popheads charity rate?? In any case, I love you for doing so

**shhhneak** (10): The discovery of the rate for me this is truly immaculate.

**vayyiqra** (9): What a cute song :uwu:

**imbaby122** (8.8): the cure for pretty girls who can’t stand the sound of male voices.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.8): Fun fact! When I first started playing Genshin Impact I thought osmanthus was a made up plant, like qingxins and silk flowers. My friends still make fun of me for that

**bigbigbee** (8): Japanese music is very good, with (IMO) a very distinct sonic profile (of course, the j-hop hop scene doesn’t resemble the j-idol scene doesn’t resemble a lot of Japanese popular music, but all have a strong individual identity). It’s such a pity that it was so hard to access internationally for so many years - and to some extent, still is, in terms of stuff like translated resources. This brings me back to my high school days searching for a crappy 240p video rip on youtube or god forbid, dailymotion, to get my fix.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): out of everyone kinoko teikoku getting two submissions for the charity rate will never not be funny to me

**qazz23** (8): this one has a decent pop sound with a bit of shoegaze

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): kina rates and all star payola name a more iconic duo

**Stryxen** (7.5): very pretty

**NotWith10000Men** (7.1): i love the production and the music, a raspier vocalist would bump it up a lot for me

**ImADudeDuh** (6): that taylor song tiktok trend voice Nice!

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s cute

**timothy444** (6): まともだが忘れられやすい

**WaneAllstarToc** (6): love dinosaur jr great band. no this doesn't sound like dino jr im just shocked 2 ditties from this act were chosen. the other was better and this feels like a sirius xmu ditty. it was a 7.4 then and it's a 6 now because i have no fucking clue why this is getting the all star treatment. god y'all REALLY love when girls pick up the guitar and write almost-gaze indie pop. you will love velocity girl and stereolab's slumberland eras i can guarantee.

**daythreeinmiami** (5.3): It’s cute but it’s not blowing me away.

**intheaftermath** (5): didn't really capture my attention

**Nagisoid** (5): This song really does not work as a whole for me. The production is REALLY odd and prioritizes vocals to such an extent that instruments are kinda just background noise. I like the lyrics and the instrumental sections, but aside from that this song is pretty forgettable to me.

**plastichaxan** (5): Cute but cute next to gorgeous

**Awkward\_King** (4): ok

**runaway3212** (2.5): this was not good in its initial rate and it’s still bad now

**flava** (10): Robbed really hard, this is the brand of incredibly disposable plastic pop that sounds effortless but still has effort put in it that I just simply adore. Addison Rae might not be able to sing, but she makes up for it with “yass and slay” energy that rivals Ava Max

**TiltControls** (8.7): This really grew on me. I actually liked Obsessed, so this wasn’t a huge jump for me to enjoy as well - but still surprised me that Addison Rae could make something this polished and then decide to apparently never release it as punishment for humanity’s sins. Damn.

---

# they got it right

**bluehxrizon** (11): she devoured so badly and I still don't understand why or how

**1998tweety** (10): literal bop perfection

**akanewasright** (10): DAMN!!! I GOT IT BAD!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t know I can’t think of anything remotely clever so I’ll just say Addison Rae Queen of Pop.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): damn

**fadedblue09** (10): this was my highest score in the rate, and I only gave it a 9….I regret that a lot now

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): main pop girl

**ignitethephoenix** (10): damn! She got it bad

**ImADudeDuh** (10): iconic song

**plastichaxan** (10): Unironically pop perfection I need her to release like yesterday

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we need this to be released so it can flop again in tiktok 2

**ricki** (10): tears fall from my eyes and you can hear me slowly drop to the ground as i send my ballot not been able to 11 this

**Stryxen** (10): YASSSSSS

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the day she releases this is the day music is reborn

**thedoctordances1940** (10): literally the best song ever made and yet it's still not being released addison what are you doing...

**throwaway-7650** (10): 11 count: 3 (them being doja/1D/addison ctfu)

**TragicKingdom1** (10): tbh i thought this would be released by now

**vayyiqra** (10): 80s synth whatever it rules i don't care also i need to pee and

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): if she could sing she’d be unstoppable

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I’ve been meaning to check her discography ever since I heard this. Hopefully, I’ll be able to do it by the end of January

**intheaftermath** (9): from concept alone this should be bad but it's not????

**just\_thonking** (9): Me telling my friend Bad that I have tested positive for sars-cov-2

**MassiveThief** (9): main pop girl!

**phonethephoenix** (9): okay like it a lot

**jman457** (8.9): Addison wanted the other gurlies to have careers, so she banished this from existence.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): this could've changed her career. would it have been a massive hit? probably not, but the gays would eat it up and she'd be booked for pride gigs for her whole life.

**timothy444** (8.5): Ugh I want to hate it but damn this is catchy

**impla77** (8.1): solid pop track

**Awkward\_King** (8): yeah...

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Miss Rae could easily be the next Carly or Charli in this sub. Whoever is handling Addison’s music releases needs to go to jail for holding this and ‘Nothing On But The Radio’ hostage.

**imbaby122** (8): now WHAT did addison just call charli xcx’s career highlight “i got it (ft. brooke candy, cupcakke, and pabllo vittar)”?!?!?!

**Nagisoid** (8): Queen of having absolutely atrocious officially released songs and the best unreleased scraps from other artists in the pop industry. Even if the synthwave/synthpop revival is getting old, the execution here is so solid there's no room to complain here at all, and she actually improved on the demo in many aspects, so...

**seanderlust** (8): that ruin my life on the bridge...that was fighting for gay rights. people were killed.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Will tell my kids about the day Addison Rae got super close to winning a popheads rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.6): Sounds very popheads-core

**jsonphile** (7.5): you released obsessed but not this??? Girl hello???

**lexiaredery** (7.5): solid

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): DAMN. I GOT IT BAD.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): "take off every piece of me until there's only skin on my body" Kesha should be singing this as a sequel to Cannibal

**pig-serpent** (7): Ok this is starting to grow on me.

**WaneAllstarToc** (6.9): workhorse pastiche. sucker born every minute hearing this cut and thinking "it's an alltimer"

**babadork** (6.4): This is cute. I don’t get why her released music is so much worse.

**camerinian** (6): nice production but that chorus just straight up doesn't scan

# they think it bad

**MagiKiwi29** (5): verses were boring but it's good for an unreleased song

**nt96** (5): sounds like a pop song [derogatory]

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): i feel like people latched onto this song because they were surprised addison rae could make a decent song tbh it’s really nothing special

**Birdseeding** (4): I understand why this one wasn't released tbh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): this is so plain white girl vibes but the bridge was pretty cool

**sarcasticsobs** (4): something something everything I have learned has been against my will

**shhhneak** (3.1): Addison reading the He’s All That Letterboxd reviews:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): damn...this song is bad

**heysoupie** (2.9): extremely generic

**cremeebrulee** (1): not the target demographic for this i fear

**frogaranaman** (1): if y’all want her to release an album STOP LEAKING IT

**runaway3212** (1): overhyped

**flava** (7): a unique pick certainly but also one that goes quite hard, but it’s more interesting than good, still good though

**TiltControls** (7): One of the most interesting songs in the rate, but I don’t know if I actually love listening to it on its own. Still points for definitely standing out in an already unique crowd of All Stars picks.

---

# Europeans

**bigbigbee** (10): aah! Powerful lady

**camerinian** (10): mad to hear something this intense and foreboding and urgent sounding only to look up the translation and find out it's basically just Ring A Round The Rosies

**cremeebrulee** (10): smasha

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is when you toss everything at the wall and somehow (?) it all lands

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is my electropop

**dreamingpastel** (10): HOLY FUCK

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): i may look like a wet rat but whenever this plays i will feel like the baddest witch in the land

**nt96** (10): Putin in shambles

**pig-serpent** (10): Ok this is hype af

**qazz23** (10): really like the synth and flutes in this and how the vocals speed up at the end

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this deserved what Stefania got

**Stryxen** (10): I couldn't believe what I was hearing when this was playing on my television screen. This was just so different? Innovative? and it was just there in the semi finals of eurovision 2021

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): very very nearly gave this my 11 but it felt corny to 11 a song from my own rate so i went with something else, but this song means so much to me and basically was the first song from eurovision i really fell in love with, the 2021 show was the first one i ever watched and this song captivated me instantly, i wasnt able to vote for it bc im a loser american but i made sure my european friend used every single one of his votes for this, it was THAT good. and i know im not alone on that opinion, because this song is almost universally adored by eurovision fans and will almost certainly go down as one of the best songs in eurovision this decade, if not of all time. its completely unique, and represents the country perfectly, which is what every great eurovision song should do, ukraine you will ALWAYS be famous

**throwaway-7650** (10): repenting for my previous non-10 [2] and FAWK euphoria

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I should have 11’d this instead

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.2): "A ukranian woman that looks like she's come from matrix, riding a car that looks like is from mad max, in Chernobyl dancing with people that look like they come from breaking bad. Absolute perfection" god this comment gave me a BAD case of brainworms...like they're not wrong and the song is rather slick...although everything image here comes from a pop culture brainrot; running on empty never felt so good tho! that dance is hysterical

**Around-town** (9): in my next life I will be reincarnated as a trash panda that lives outside where ever Eurovision holds their competition

**Birdseeding** (9): Best Eurovision song since Euphoria, I voted for it ten times

**impla77** (9): Yassified yodelling (?)

**intheaftermath** (9): iconic actually

**Memezaharamole** (9): The combination of ukrainian folk and electronic techno hits hard. can't understand a word but no need to speak ukrainian to recognise talent.

**runaway3212** (9): a hyperpop bop

**thedoctordances1940** (9): this song is so fucking irritating (complement)

**vayyiqra** (9): СЛАВА УКРАЇНІ !!!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): Boppin' my head in my big chair rn

**NotWith10000Men** (8.2): pretty cool, i like when it speeds up

**MassiveThief** (8): this is very neat i will not lie

**shhhneak** (8): As a Maneskin fan this song still activates my fight response.

**jman457** (7.6): bops kind of

**phonethephoenix** (7.6): okay let's gooo

**1998tweety** (7.5): she has some cute moments

**akanewasright** (7.5): oh this is pretty good I forgot this one!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): This is what Next Level was trying to do but marginally better

**shipperondeck** (7.3): well i did not expect this but it's a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (7): idg why this had such a big moment

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): ngl didn’t expect this to do so well in the rate but it is quintessential wacky eurovision so i’m not mad

**ricki** (6.5): nugu kpop group title track

# Americans

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Would not have been my pick from this rate

**imbaby122** (5): this song sounds like what a panic attack feels like.

**timothy444** (4): The singing is bad, the tempo change is completely unnecessary and that flute doesn't contribute anything to the song. Yawn

**anothertown** (3): i'm saying no to almost all folktronica just off rip

**bogo** (3): really do not like these vocals

**Nagisoid** (3): I literally do not know what I just heard. Some parts of this song are cute and others sound like torture circus music. Sorry Ukraine, I wish you the best but I don't know what to say about this song.

**daythreeinmiami** (2): I wanted to like it so bad.

**frogaranaman** (1): absolutely not

**plastichaxan** (1): Sorry I didn’t like it this time like… look at the material in the rest of the rate

**IIIHenryIII** (0): what a fucking annoying voice

TiltControls: # 21st Century Eurovision

---

**Overall Average**: 7.262 **// Average Controversy:** 2.215

---

**TiltControls:** This was probably the rate most out of my comfort zone this past All Stars cycle. I only really knew Euphoria and even that grew off me a little bit by the time Winners III hit. The two picks were solid, but I think this was always going to be a category that would have trouble getting 10s from me. Not super unexpected to see them both leaving day 1, but it was a fun rate to explore!! Kurp and racloves did great with the hosting even though I had no context to any of the songs

**bigbigbee** (10.000): I actually like both of these songs more than the winner of this rate, Euphoria! But I’m also not European, so

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10.000): One of my favorite rates of the year! Got me super addicted into Eurovision. Stream monika liu - sentimentai!

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.600): this smells like kurp-dawg in here

**throwaway-7650** (8.000): this rate will go out day 1 but it was so fun idc

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.050): early 2000s was the prime eurovision and I’m not saying that because my country won

**ImADudeDuh** (6.000): eat your salad ROBBED of a redemption

**plastichaxan** (5.500): Not for me but at least there was a serve in here

**TiltControls** (7.2): Listening to the day 1 songs a bit more I think I might’ve underscored this a little. The song is a bit of a mess, but Madison owns that mess.

**flava** (6): in the battle between the songs in All Stars 6 by women whose names rhyme. Madison unfortunately wins, but not by much, I don’t think this song is as good as some people think it is, it mostly falls under a not particularly good Ariana Grande impersonation with a pun for a title that I don’t think is very clever, but there is yass and slay energy here

---

# Ariana who?

**intheaftermath** (11): literally everything Madison does is so underrated. Her voice acting as Evelynn from K/DA? Amazing. Her brief stint as Monster High's obscure character Madison Fear? Amazing. THIS SONG? this entire album? so good. a main pop girl in my heart

**1998tweety** (10): deserved to smash

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A LOT of cunty songs in this rate but this has to be top 5.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): manipulate mansplain BOYSHIT

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Stained Glass the 11

**fadedblue09** (10): should have won

**ignitethephoenix** (10): GOAT song

**plastichaxan** (10): I hope one day people can open their eyes to her genius

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if Charli had dropped this y'all would eat it up

**Stryxen** (10): everybody remembers where they were when this dropped

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): more like boysHIT

**throwaway-7650** (10): can't go wrong with this/follow the white rabbit!

**vayyiqra** (10): shuffle beat = banger it's a physical constant of the universe

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): ughhhh madison beer u fucken GENIUS u didn't have to have a ditty this memorable that u just shat out across the bizarre as fuck 2021 life support lp but holky shit ms. beer it is delivered very well. I've sorta reimagined this ditty in my head as an industrial slab with humongous blown out bass and autechre-level clinking as she go "i dont speak boyshit". i think i'll give it a 10 for the remix in my dreams alone

**welcome2thejam** (10): Giving this a ten amongst all these great all-star selections is character growth on both our ends

**just\_thonking** (9.5): I can't explain it but this is like if they combined a Lil Nas X song with a Billie Eilish song

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): this is really good???

**anothertown** (9): i like the looney tunes noise she put in when she says leaving you in the dust

**runaway3212** (9): she was so mother here

**timothy444** (9): The bassline has no right to be as funky as it is in this. Like damn, good pop song aside… the bassline just elevates this to a whole other level

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): “you might seem like a man but you’re not one in your mind” wait is this about coming out as trans

**imbaby122** (8.3): ugh i was hoping this song would suck so i would have a reason to dislike madison beer other than that she’s way prettier than me.

**akanewasright** (8): sure

**jman457** (8): Love a little misandrist anthem

**sarcasticsobs** (8): I'm laughing so fckning hard, I love it

**shipperondeck** (8): this probably should have won

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): I kinda wish any one else had this because i refuse to tell any of these new bubbling under bubbling under blonde/brunette girls apart, and I cannot stan this song from an artist I would not be able to tell out of a lineup

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): it’s fun

**qazz23** (7): kinda catchy, like the ending synths

**phonethephoenix** (6.3): not bad but I also would not say it's good

**seanderlust** (6.3): i said this in my jukebox comment but the fact that madison can confidently pull off lyrics this...straight up bad is kind of a testament to her.

**bogo** (6): it's alright

**IIIHenryIII** (6): “you might have a way with words but I’m a woman / I can’t understand you” did she just say men are smarter than women???

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i’ve never cared for this song

**pig-serpent** (6): I don't like, I don't like Boysmell

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Should I be offended because I'm a boy or because this is cringy

# Isn’t this just Addison Rae again?

**impla77** (5.6): This should appeal but it is a bit shit.

**heysoupie** (5): her music gives me amnesia

**Awkward\_King** (4): she think she on the team

**camerinian** (3): congrats to the AI on already getting an all stars track

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): i have irrational hatred towards this song

**Nagisoid** (3): She's never beating the Grandegations. I would say this song lost me but it never really caught me in the first place. There are some parts that are sort of nice and the beat is cute, but there's really nothing special about this and the lyrics are so repetitive and silly it's almost funny.

**shhhneak** (3): The way there’s nothing unique about this amalgamation of every pop girl.

**frogaranaman** (1): no

**MassiveThief** (0): I will never know what people see in Madison. This just reads like influencer-attempts-music to me, and it's literally called BOYSHIT like... why?

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): y'all hyped this song so much, just for it to be this.. unforgivable

TiltControls: # Not So Main Pop Girls

---

**Overall Average**: 6.189 **// Average Controversy:** 2.911

---

**TiltControls**: I think this rate was kind of stuck with 2014 Y/N in the ‘miracle if it made it out of day 1’ and it did come close at points! But unfortunately the Y/S (yass/slay) girls just couldn’t quite do it. Marmite and Poppy (again) did a fantastic job with hosting here, even if it came at the expense of poor Ava’s artist average.

**flava**: you guys were mad at some of these rates since this is the 5th rate to go out today, maybe expected, but this was one of my favourite reveals of the year (even if I had to miss most of day 3 to play tennis). Also make sure to apologise to poppy for rateggaeton

**thedoctordances1940** (10.500): best rate ever with the best hosts ever 😇

**WaneAllstarToc** (10.000): an absolutely joyful rate of true music moments. madison beer is almost good enough to really be a pop girl, or at least the tour video made me think otherwise. ava max WOULD have a song called "so am i" that was eliminated at 47th place be called back into action and crack me up so good. i am genuinely fascinated by her ability to almost work but default to a meme. kings & queens should have been a "puddle of mudd - blurry" moment in pop history. zara larson sucks ass though and never deserved to win; you are all scoundrels. well, i hope boyshit gets to day 3

**plastichaxan** (10.000): Stepping in last minute for this was a lot of fun even if it cut my Rosalía streak I loved my cohostie and hosting a hit rate for a change (though TWOE was like a minor hit I guess)

**Stryxen** (10.000): this rate ruined my life I could not get Ho-ly Smokes! Out of my vocabulary for months

**fadedblue09** (10.000): lowkey one of the more enjoyable rates we did this year. And these picks were indeed a slay, thank you very much hosts!

**DirtyRat583** (9.500): feral gays cheered when this was picked

**ImADudeDuh** (8.000): All The Time you will always be famous

**just\_thonking** (7.750): Pleasantly surprised by these

**IIIHenryIII** (7.500): Ava is such an underdog

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.500): purrrrrr

**vayyiqra** (5.500): What a goofy rate! Ava's album was awful, Madison's was pretty good; Zara's:

**throwaway-7650** (5.000): the way my average would've been a 10 if... nvm

**sarcasticsobs** (4.500): BOYSHIT

**akanewasright** (4.000): this is a so am I hate account

**TiltControls** (10): In hindsight I do wish I sent the Wii Sports Theme, but I just assumed it would have enough push to be voted in! Anyways this was the classical filler spot since Debussy wasn’t getting sent (Redemption 3 winner Clair de Lune is looking tempting though)

**flava** (8): tilt had the foresight to not send wii sports theme because he knew that it was it going to beat Biology in the exit form we made for everyone who submitted

# VGI 2 when?

**1998tweety** (10): kinda devoured

**bogo** (10): awesome

**CrimsonROSET** (10): please play layton

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): honestly an amazing song

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): SLAYTON!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I want to know what’s happening here

**impla77** (10): Every puzzle has an answer!

**Nagisoid** (10): Buenos Aires is still shaking from this massive serve. I love the fusion of jazz and tango here, extremely well done.

**nt96** (10): Flora would've 11'd this track and appreciated the Violinussies, Violanussies, Cellonussies, and Accordionussies put into this track. But no, she's GONE FOR NO REASON.

**phonethephoenix** (10): I've never played professor Layton but this makes me want to! love it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Professor Layton can eat me out anytime he wants

**shhhneak** (10): This children’s game makes me want to take up burlesque dancing.

**Stryxen** (10): maybe he can investigate who set the studio on FIRE that day

**thedoctordances1940** (10): literally the best game ever made

**throwaway-7650** (10): repenting for non-10 [3]

**welcome2thejam** (10): Professor Slayton in The Case of the Unadulterated Bop

**timothy444** (9.5): Another amazing vidya game song but I swear to god, I better not see people thirsting for Clive Dove in the comments above me

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): yo wtf

**WaneAllstarToc** (9.4): love 90s chicago post-rock released on drag city, thrill jockey, or touch & go's quarterstick record-wait this ins't that!

**intheaftermath** (9): it's not Almond Cookie's Trial Theme but it will do

**imbaby122** (8.5): the assignment was video game soundtrack but the composer went ahead and made the most exhilarating, groovy, ethereal instrumental track ever

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Very classy. It sounds academic but in a slay way.

**qazz23** (8): great use of piano and 🎻

**Roxieloxie** (8): this is one of the most unique sounding songs here, I dont think this rate is designed for it to do well but im enjoying it!

**Uberpigeon** (8): i love strings

**jman457** (7.9): This was really pretty, felt like an old parisian night club

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): wait this is serving

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.3): It's very French

**bigbigbee** (7): you are a bitch and loser, I scream at the townsperson whose suitcase I’m supposed to be packing using tangram puzzles. the townsperson doesn’t care. They’re not actually real.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The strings and piano pop off towards the end. I’ve never played this game before in my life but based on the way this theme is, it’s a mystery crime?

# We’re never getting VGI 2, are we?

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its cute. I can imagine getting a venti frappe to this

**letsallpoo** (6): the great ace attorney soundtrack ended this i fear

**ricki** (6): ok

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i could never play a professor layton game i can't even beat basic puzzle games without using a guide

**vayyiqra** (6): it is almost, but not quite entirely, unlike jazz

**akanewasright** (5): I’m kinda baffled as to why this is here. If you had asked me before all stars to think of every song in VGI, this would be one of the very last I’d come up with. I’m sure it hits if you played the game, but this doesn’t do much for me. At least the violinist and pianist are serving

**plastichaxan** (5): That was kind of fun for like the first minute

**IIIHenryIII** (2): not my cup of tea

**flava** (10): our last elimination of the day and one I think is highly robbed, I mean it’s just so goofy, unfortunately it could not overcome misandry and did not pass go into day 2

**TiltControls** (3): MGMT is funny cause I will really defend the stuff from Oracular (Time to Pretend overhated btw), but none of their stuff afterwards has clicked with me. This is fine I guess, the verses are nice. Though something about the chorus doesn’t click with me sonically.

---

# Gay

**moonagenightmares** (11): gay rights!

**Stryxen** (11): closing my eyes when this gets eliminated at 44 with a 7.492 average and two 0s. I will not be able to handle it

**akanewasright** (10): GAY PEOPLE!!!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A perfect 30/30 on 2018 Indie Pop submissions from me. Am I Hypno’s strongest soldier?

**bogo** (10): love those cute little cats they're the best

**cremeebrulee** (10): i've always loved the way they've loved

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): :me: :michael:

**frogaranaman** (10): hiiiiiiiiiiii Michael :3

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): good song

**musical\_pyn** (10): this was like third pick for my eleven, the way this song just sets the tone immediately so well...chef's kiss

**phonethephoenix** (10): MGMT brings the vibes as usual

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this deserves to be a tiktok hit [2]

**ricki** (10): making this song gay is one of the best executive decisions any artist has ever taken

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i think quite a few people in this rate will agree with me when i say that me and michael has been a very important part of late 2022

**WaneAllstarToc** (10): End of every blog radio on Sirius xmu on demand in 2018 ended with the start of that DUN DUN. Me and friend once listened to it driving back from San Diego and put our fists up in the air. God I love this one, solid as it comes. and consistently aging better by the second. genius pop

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): gay rights like genuinely....

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): if this came out in the 80s it would play in stranger things in Mike and Will scenes

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): "not everyone can be like me and Michael / the only problem is forgetting which side you're on" ok we get it y'all are both vers

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Bublé?

**imbaby122** (9): still unsure of the nature of this relationship.

**runaway3212** (9): gay people

**impla77** (8.5): Maybe I’ve gotten over my misandry era a bit

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): best new discovery from the rate for me.

**camerinian** (8): a fancam for this song but it's just an unedited credits sequence from a John Hughes movie

**CrimsonROSET** (8): :me: :michael:

**DirtyRat583** (8): love that for them! <3

**welcome2thejam** (8): There are two cats inside of you. One is me, one is Michael

**jman457** (7.7): Solid synthpop track, draggs a bit though

**03O9** (7.5): homosexuality prevails!

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): not me having to give another MGMT song a good score. They can’t keep getting away with this

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): I like this more now

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): easily the best song from the three 2018 indie pop songs

**Nagisoid** (7): They're doing better. Honestly the song is a nothingburger aside from the chorus but that's ok because of the vibe is trying to go for, and the chorus is really monumental.

**seanderlust** (7): yes this song just gets a boost because when i hear it i think of the cat video, what about it

**vayyiqra** (7): rock on dudes

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.5): Kinda embarrassed for Michael's everywhere

**daythreeinmiami** (5.4): Honestly didn’t even realise this band was still around until Little Dark Age began trending. I for sure prefer their prime. This is so mid and slow. I want more magical acid drop beats and synth.

**timothy444** (5): I listened to 11 minutes of this and I was more interested in the r/art subreddit drama that I was reading about during those 11 minutes

# Straight

**anothertown** (4): franz ferdinand (2004) called.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): i just don't like whatever genre this is

**qazz23** (4): i like the chiptune part at the end, that's about it

**pig-serpent** (3): I still feel like every 80s band has a better version of this song. We should've gotten When you Die instead.

**sarcasticsobs** (3): GOD. Just... ENOUGH. I BEG you

**fadedblue09** (1): enough with this band please

**plastichaxan** (0): I’m sorry I wanted to give it a chance cause it wasn’t the worst of the album but like… Look at the material here

**thedoctordances1940** (0): god it feels good to be able to bully mgmt
