[RATE] 2013 Ultimate Album Rate Day 2! Mount your goddesses...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6nhbs5/rate_2013_ultimate_album_rate_day_2_mount_your/

###WELCOME [BACK!!!!](http://i.imgur.com/8WvjXhf.gifv)

Here are some quick notes and facts about this rate and what we will be doing today:

* Today we will be revealing 20 songs (#30-11) 
* We Will being at 3 PM EST both in this thread and [in the plug.dj here!](plug.dj/popheads)
* The average controversy score is 2.2859. So, anything higher than that should be considered controversial. 
* The overall average of ALL the scores is 7.0387. Solid. 

And perhaps my favorite fact of all…

* **THERE WERE 137 PARTICIPANTS**, aka, this is the most competed in rate in all of /r/popheads history! Thanks a ton guys! My agressive promotion tactics on the Discord and Plug paid off big time!
* It will get messy. Tears will be shed, blood will be shed, slurs will be thrown. And I cannot wait.

Leixander: Yesterday we had witnessed poor Katheryn's funeral. May she rest in peace and be resurrected tomorrow with Britney and Tinasha's blood magic. Today, we will probably see poor Stefani suffer. May she be cleansed of her bad sins and only good parts of her remain. Amen.

ugh

i gave it a 7 but i really think its much worse. it does nothing right. its a beat-driven supposedly club banger that has a bad, weak beat. lets not even talk about the lyrics. the song has no structure, which i applaud her for attempting, but it really just makes the song even worse. luckily, it was a bonus track. lets please move on.

# Slut Drop

**Elitefourbrad**: "7/11 sells Fidget Spinners so I like this"

**_ItsJake**: "such a fun bop"

**mokitsu**: "this PC Music club banger! such a weird song for beyoncé lol, low key a rihanna impersonation but it still has bey's distinctive swagger and royal touch tbh"

**Bingcrusher**: "This song makes me dance in the whitest way possible."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Goes off on a dancefloor, kind of jarring on the deluxe to go from Blue to this though"

**lassidoggy**: "THIS MAKES ME GO OFF YAS MOTHER"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I like to use this song as a warm up song, it’s kinda like Simon Says for dancing."

**SkyBlade79**: "get it, my score is basically 7/11 ahahaha le dank maymay. this song is a mess tbh."

**zamomattel**: "This is trash, but it's my trash so I love it"

**10footnotes**: "Actually getting tonal whiplash going from Blue to this."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of convenience stores. queen of describing dance moves that sound like you're having a seizure. queen of budget music videos."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "A great song! The beat is supreme and she sounds strong as ever vocally! Lyrics actually add to the song even if they're not very deep and a teensy bit repetitive."

**xanthalasajache**: "I love MillenialBey"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this song makes me want to do slut drops, idc if it's 'bad' or whatever you think"

# Slut, Stop

**specfagular**: "I HATE this song with a passion. Annoying and makes me physically cringe. Nothing good about this damn song. I knew before listening to all the songs in this rate that this would get my 0"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Okay, it’s this one. I’m hella glad this is off the standard. This is annoying. But I hate to admit it, but it bangs. I love the beat, but it’s honestly not a fit for self-titled and I can only really take it every once in a while."

**skiddos**: "the only song on the entire album that i dislike. i know the autotune is a stylistic choice, but i just can't"

**lady_sable**: "Way too repetitive imo. By far the weakest song on the album."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "no, no and no. Stupid song. This is gross so gross omg it hurts my ears. The bridge is horrible what was Bey thinking? Thanks to Detail and OG Bobby Johnson."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "A mess of a track. Beyoncé slurs her way through banal lyrics over a flaccid trap beat. It completely ruins the mood of the album that had been established so far. Beyoncé, you’re better than this."

**awryj**: "It's aaaaannoooooyiiiiing"

**fuckupsomecommasyeah**: "i do not like this at all"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "I've decided not to give any 0s but this song is truly garbage."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "out of the world how people can like this"

Ah yes, the title track of my favorite album ever, and, truthfully, the first song from ARTPOP that i loved. The reason it doesnt have a 10 from me is probably because of overplay, but truthfully, that bridge and that prechorus excel. The very alien and foreign production and vocals make this one of the more interesting and weird tracks from this album. I'm also gonna piggyback off of throwaway's comment a little bit, and say I love this song and album as a concept. "We could, we could belong together," presents this poptimistic idea that pop isn't just a generic and accessable form of music. Its beautiful, its art, and its pop. Nice.

---
# ARTPOP

**Elitefourbrad**: "The title track itself is an odd one. It gives us a really funky, futuristic beat that really gets you pumped up. It also brings together art and pop as one. The performance with Elton John certainly helped sway my decision."

**Syfawx**: "I have to be in a certain mood"

**Macubass**: "a gyarados amongst magikarp"

**specfagular**: "I've always loved this song. It feels so mysterious and chill."

**enecks**: "After the rush that was listening to Do What U Want for the first time, I didn't pay enough attention to this space-age bop on the first listen. This gives me good video game music vibes."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "i cried to this at artrave lmao"

**mokitsu**: "WHAT are those "ihh ihhh"s in the background of the song?!??!! anyway...very chilled out as well. a cute filler."

**musicotic**: "I love the Dance, Sex, Art, Pop part 😩. This song has definitely grown on me. I hated it at first listen when it leaked, but it's pretty good"

**xanthalasajache**: "The bridge is alarmingly beautiful. The beat is too pretty for the verse."

# ARTFLOP

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is already around the halfway mark, and I’m fatigued. This title track is the explanation for Artpop, the concept behind the idea. It’s interesting, I just only wished it was more attention-grabbing and over a beat that didn’t just fade away. Sidenote: the ending is pretty dope."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "MY ARTPOP COULD MEAN ANYTHING WELL GAGA SWEETIE IT’S 2017 ARE U EVER GONNA TELL US THE FUCKING MEANING OF THAT? Was this a coded message telling us all that Joanne was gonna suck? Discuss"

**thefighter987**: "this sounds like youtube tutorial music lmao"

**Nfranklin50**: "Man Andy Warhol doesn't deserve this slander on his brand"

# i love Se-lady Ga-gomez

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This feels like a weird cover of Selena Gomez’s “Love You Like a Love Song,” further cementing the idea that Selena has replaced Madonna as the true pop icon because now Gaga is stealing from her instead."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "okay but this is literally the beat from Love You Like a Love Song right? she even copied Selena's tired ass lullaby vocals"

# A wholesome comment, one of my favs

**throwaway963963963**: "If you watch pretty much any pop singer's interview, anytime the interviewer mentions the word "pop" they immediately get uncomfortable and try to prove that they're not really pop. Like I was recently watching an old Christina interview where she talked about working with Max Martin and she kept stressing that while it is a pop song it has "real vocals" and isn't "just pop". While I know that many people feel ARTPOP wasn't fully realized as a concept, for Gaga to make an entire album on the idea of poptimism is something that is deeply relevant to this subreddit and I think should have been encouraged and appreciated."

JustinJSrisuk: Your comment was really interesting. I was just thinking of doing a post on the limits of *poptimism*, as in how poptimism is great for putting critical attention on pop music as an art form, but also how it might be bad for the genre in the long run. What do you think about poptimism in general?

throwaway963963963: Sorry I just saw this! thank you

I do feel you can judge music as a final output, should judge it on it's impact to move you, and that there is an external negative stigma against pop for reasons outside of actual music.

But that being said it should be judged fairly, we mustn't pretend like the artists are always the sole creators, or that the intention isn't commerical, etc.

The second song from this album that i loved. Basically, the order of songs i started stanning from the album goes ARTPOP->MANiCURE->Gypsy->OHGOD I FUCKING LOVE THIS ALBUM. Like the rest of this album this song is big bold and brash, except this time with guitar. AND IT BOPS HARD. This is probably the biggest bop off of ARTPOP, because from literally the first second to the last the song goes 110% and more. I love every second of this song and I'm really sad to see it done dirty. It was in the top 10 at one point tho...

---
# Can feel it

**MrSwearword**: "GLAM ROCK PUSS REALNESS"

**fifthchevron**: "How was this not a single?"

**gannade**: "if u dont chant manicure then are you even gay"

**enecks**: "I always knew Gaga would follow up on the You and I sound, but I didn't expected it to be quite like this. The chorus was super-repetitive and catchy in the way of The Fame, there were people yelling Man Cure, there was a kickass guitar, and there were random chiptune elements. For all these reasons, I loved it (I called estrogen man curing pills for a while)."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "Now this is one of the stronger songs Gaga managed to pop on on this album! Intense, sexual, with awesome instrumentals giving a rock feel! Good shit here"

# Cannot feel it

**mokitsu**: "again... not enjoyable at ALL. i'll only listen to this one more time which is when it's the first song out of the rate"

**VeganSquash**: "iTunes festival version is MUCH better, I really don't like the "can you feel it?" part of this song."

**Jackcs903**: "If she had kept the chorus from the iTunes Festival version this could've been a smash hit tbh, and kind of the same problem as Aura, her vocals just sound less passionate in the final version than she's capable of"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Is this Joanne teas? I can already tell this is a forgotten album track, and honestly I wish it was over. It’s not terrible, but it’s not amazing either."

**misstututulle**: "You can tell a song isn't quite complete when the leaked demo is better than the album version. MANiCURE is a busy bop, and it feels overstuffed."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Terrible. Doesn’t make any sense. Her diction is awful. I’m pretty sure at one point I hear her sing “Your vore, the medicine,” a line which I’m fairly certain would be more interesting than whatever she’s actually singing. The song doesn’t seem to really be about anything, if there’s a point it gets muddled and lost somewhere along the way. Are you making a pun on the phrase “Man I Cure” or is it about getting literal manicures? If it’s a metaphor or double entendre, how are those two things related? The song never picks a lane. We don’t know what it’s about. It’s just Gaga stumbling around screaming her way through an overloaded track until she’s mercifully cut off by an unpleasant instrumental break."

# JOANNEPOP

**cloudbustingmp3**: "garbage ass garageband demo sounding ass abortion of a song. buy its fully developed sister A-YO on itunes instead"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "A less polished version of A-Yo that, fortunately, still manages to be almost as enjoyable."

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "a-yo part 1**XwildcatXJH**: "The first thirty seconds is literally A-YO. And then it does it again. Iconic. Also the chorus is great and I hear chiptune so toot."

**zamomattel**: "Budget A-Yo tbh"

**jamesfog**: "A-Yo is shook"

**xanthalasajache**: "First time hearing this. Reminds me of Ayo"

**piccprincess**: "Is this A-YO?"

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/5J7gaZ1N)**

The third of the trifling terrible triplets of self-titled, aka the songs that brought down my s/t average to a 7. No Angel, Superpower, and finally, Rocket. Like Superpower, Rocket is a boring 6 minutes slog of a song that should've been left in the brain of bey's songwriters (oop). this song makes my penis want to invert. 

---
**Macubass**: "the music video should be used in gay conversion therapy /s"

**specfagular**: "Nice and relaxing without being super boring with a great theme/message but it's also TOO DAMN LONG.. which seems to be a theme on this album. So many songs that could be shorter and others that could be a little longer."

**mokitsu**: "YES BEY. serving D'Angelo realness. this is one of those tracks that imo you need to experience to like, and sitting in he dark at night arching your back to it and stuff definitely works but making love to this song would help a lot more. it's basically an orgasm in sound format, and i love her for doing something like this. an ode to sex tbh."

**justdancegottabeok**: "It's amazing, but just somewhat too long. Very recognisable for its songwriting."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A really long track, but it’s worth listening to in full, the lyrics are revealing and honest, and honest, it’s so smooth and I like it a lot."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This is so smooth, great production and some of Bey's most heavenly vocals, maybe would have been higher if it was a little shorter but it's great"

**shrekinatohr**: "Bey snatched my virginity with this song."

**chubs4life**: "I love rolling around on the floor like a dying beach whale trying to be sexy to this song."

**ImOnABeach**: "This song is 6 minutes of pure bliss. I love every second."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "This is how you do a damn sexsexsex song, folks! Takes me on a journey from flirting to fuckin, and gets me all hot and bothered! An absolute song that gets you smack dab in the passion"

**huntyphobic**: "the most iconic opening of any song ever!! G.U.Y wishes!!"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This track is a bit lengthy but I'm engaged for every second. I can't believe I slept on it when I first listened to Self Titled but I've repented and now I belt "Let me sit this aaaaaaaasssss" at full volume whenever it comes on."**Wailordfan**: "People didn't like it because of how long it is, but as a Taylor stan, I'm used to overly long ballad-y songs, and Bey served serious vocals here."

# Definitely not turned on

**Elitefourbrad**: "The rocket I want to ride is the rocket straight out of this song."

**VeganSquash**: "I am all for expressing sexuality, but this song does not do it for me. The beat is boring, the song is too slow, and ya, not my style of music."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I love my man Timberlake and Timbaland but jesus they really love their really long songs about sex. I can see why people would love this song so much but this is not for me."

**zamomattel**: "Would be a 10 if it wasn't so damn long"

**throwaway963963963**: "This is actually a great sex song, because if you play it during sex you'll feel like it's lasting forever since this damn song just never seems to fucking end."

**jelboo**: "I know this is orgasmic to some and I know I'm not the type to say this - but this song is too long. It's not my kind of music anyway. Strangely, the most erotic song on the album is the one that arouses (my attention) the least"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "THIS SONG TAKES FUCKING FOREVER TO END. this bitch really took up 6 and half minutes for an unsubtle metaphor huh"

# Swearword is being weird again

**MrSwearword**: "I would have the filthiest sex of my life with Steve Grand to this song."

# A lovely summary of a song I hate

**Ghost-Quartet**: "There are a lot of songs on this album that I think are too long. This is the longest track on the album, and honestly? Not long enough. This track is perfect. She uses every single second of these six and a half minutes. A lot of the times I feel like Beyoncé songs shift from being listener friendly songs to being exhibitions of Beyonce’s skills (not always a good thing) but this song isn’t an art installation, it’s an experience. This song is dynamic, she manages to sing about sex for six and half minutes without it getting stale because she’s constantly shifting the tempo and lyrics, always maintaining a velvety and sexy tone that just absolutely melts me. I’ve never heard the word “ass” sung so angelically. She’s singing an orgasm. I need a cigarette after listening to this. But more than that, it’s also a love song. It’s not a sex jam about some random dude, she makes it clear that the reason the sex is so good is because the relationship is so good. The song really covers all the bases in that regard, it’s a fully rounded piece. “I’m so comfortable in my skin, and you’re so comfortable in my skin” is the best lyric on the album. This is unquestionably one of the best things that Beyoncé has recorded, and definitely the highlight of the album."

# ARE YOU EVEN FUCKING GAY???

Literal psychopaths, the lot of you. Fashion! is my 3rd favorite off of ARTPOP, because everything about it is so perfect. ARTPOP's production is at its peak here, with the album taking a break from hard edm and going a more smooth and funky route(until that delicious drop anyways). There are so many little pieces to this song that make it absolutely perfect, from the "slay"s to french breakdown, to the beginning piano, to the smooth production, to the very short and orgasmic period when Gaga yells "I own the world!" it is all just... perfect... beautiful... and without a doubt one of my favorite songs ever made.

---
# I Put It On

**Elitefourbrad**: "The most iconic runway song you will ever hear. The “Slay” in the song is amazing and makes it everytime, along with the piano and Gaga holding that note for a long ass time for the bridge."

**enecks**: "This was what a fashion song should be to me; glittery, romantic, simple, graceful, and fun to listen to. Putting on clothes with this in the background was so fun."

**mokitsu**: "this is a cute bop. very anthemic! the modern day vogue."

**VeganSquash**: ""I own the world, we own the world" ALWAYS gives me chills."

**justdancegottabeok**: "Despite this being a album track, it's the absolute fashion theme. AMAZING! With such an outstanding combination of top producers, this must automatically be the best song on ARTPOP. And yes, it is, by quite a margin. This turned out to be one of my favourite Gaga tracks ever, it's just so well-produced and her vocals in here are just incredible. And ofcourse, it still brings that nice bizarreness with it."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "The production changed up for this song and I welcome the change, I like how groovy this beat is and it compliments Gaga well, I really wish it didn't have another EDM drop at the end but at least this one was quickly over"

**lady_sable**: "This always blends in with Donatella in my mind. Generic doesn't necessarily mean bad, but when you're someone like Lady Gaga who strives to be different, it's something you should avoid."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Two things I can’t help but think of when I hear this song: “Looking Good, Feeling Gorgeous”  by RuPaul and that performance she did with RuPaul where she was dressed like a poop covered condom. Gay icon. It does really sound like a track to be played as people are walking the runway."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The French part is sort of cringey but the rest of the song fucking blows. This should be a lip-sync song for RuPaul's Drag Race."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Remember the time Gaga performed this as a giant brown condom with RuPaul, because I sure as hell do. Anyways, fucking SLAY."

**huntyphobic**: "this song is so campy and gay, if you rate this badly then ur probably homophobic tbh"

**kappyko**: "fuck, amazing track. funky, beautiful piano. ranks right below "American Boy" for best will.i.am production"

# I Take It Off

**OliverQueer**: "A meh song overall. Lacks that something to make it great."

**Jackcs903**: "Kind of unnecessary after Donatella. I feel like Gaga should’ve made a standard/deluxe version of ARTPOP and put this on the deluxe, along with J&D. Still very catchy though and puts me in a great mood!"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "no exclamation point Fashion lowkey did it better"

**musicotic**: "Hate the intro, just sounds awkward and not thought out. Negative catchiness, but the chorus is fun and catchy. Probably the worst song on the album rating by likability for me."

**the_monkey_**: "Heidi Montag's Fashion > The one Gaga's released"

# The Best Thing

**enecks**: "Drake tax subtracts 1 from my score. Otherwise, Blessed be Beyoncé."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "the best Drake feature tbh"

**mokitsu**: "for me the best part of this song is the gorgeous piano intro, tbh the confessional nature of the song before turning into a sad dancehall track was one of the many times this record shocked me. the lines "on my mind, up past my bedtime/no rest at the kingdom" are some of my favorite of the record."

**Jackcs903**: "Really great song but it’s just a little too long, it’s easy to tune it out after awhile"

**justdancegottabeok**: "Drake's influence is all over it, bringing 40 and Majid Jordan along as producers. The chemistry between the two artists absolutely works in this song though. Overall it's a pretty strange track, but it's just amazing. The last verse by Drake feels a bit unnecessary. But hey, it's good."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Bey and Sampha and Drake, an iconic trio, and they all deliver. Having two 6 minute songs back to back can be too much, but they’re both great, and this one is the stronger of the two, with a bangin chorus and some amazing chemistry."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Definitely my favorite Beyonce song. Probably the only long song on this album I wouldn't trim down, it just keeps going and keeps being amazing, perfect production and both solo and harmony vocals from Bey and Drake. It's honestly tragic that these two never made another released song because they have chemistry and this song works so well, the sort of grit of Drake's vocals contrasts really well with Bey's flawless voice, and it's just a great mix of hip hop and soul and R&B styles."

**chubs4life**: "Ok so a Beyonce and Drake collab is the perfect recipe for a hit buuut it was neglected and life isn't fair."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "When I first heard of the song, I thought this song was really weird to the point I didn't see myself listening to this song again. But this song has grown on me very much. I know I have not always been a fan of Drake but that's only over his solo music. I actually enjoy Drake as a feature artist and he provided some good verses here in the song."

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "goes on a little too long but Drake and Beyoncé sound good together"

**ImOnABeach**: "This song would be rated much higher if there were no Drake cameo. He almost manages to ruin the song. Beyonce’s part is killer though so its still one of my faves."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "More Drake and Yoncé."

**thefighter987**: "the piano intro is gorgeous and it has the effects on drake’s voice was really well executed"

**jelboo**: "Atmospheric and fascinating"

# thats never been mine

**borpo**: "I wish Drake were only singing on this one, his verse kind of ruins it for me"

**VeganSquash**: "before Drake's part kicked in, I really loved this song. The intro was amazing, and my wig was SNATCHED. Then the beat changed and I didn't like it so much? My wig flew back on my head and I was like "oh"...Drake sounded cool and all, but I felt like he was randomly inserted into this song. The verses were great, the chorus not so much."

**10footnotes**: "I like to think that "from 8 until 8" means he literally only thinks about her for 60 seconds a day."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "why does this exist tbh"

**PandoraKris**: "I Am Not Sasha Fierce Part 2-3: ICYMI I Dance In Slo-Mo To Prove That I'm Artistic"

**kappyko**: "such a weird juxtaposition between the chill atmospheric voices and the distorted THIS IS A SONG FOR THE GOOD GIRLS WANNA WANNA ROLL WITH THE GOOD GIRLS AAFAAAAAAAAAAAA"

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/pM0YpUuw)**

The prechorus is better than the chorus here, just because of how anthemic it is. Its pure artpop, and in a league of its own. Its so self absorbed too, its a wonderland(which was also done dirty in its rate) of comical egotistical self-assurance. Obviously gaga isnt actually this self absorbed in person, but part of me wants her to be. Also, the following are iconic lyrics:

# IM SMOKING EM ON FULL TANK OF GAS

# IM A RICH BITCH IM THE UPPER CLASS

# IM BLOND, IM SKINNY, IM RICH, AND IM A LITTLE BIT OF A BITCH

# JUST ASK YOUR GAY FRIEND THEIR ADVICE BEFORE YOU/ GET A SPRAY TAN ON HOLIDAY, IN TAIPEI 

---
**Elitefourbrad**: "The beginning is such a great opening, with Gaga calling herself “A little bit of a bitch”, the shouting chorus makes you want to get up and jump with Gaga live at artRave. The chorus also has a great smooth-sounding outro that makes the song everytime I listen to it."

**VeganSquash**: "prechorus > chorus tbh" agreed

**Jackcs903**: "That bassline is killer; Gucci who? Chanel who? Dolce and Gabbana who? All shook and over after Miss Gaga and Miss Donatella Versace ended their lives"

**lassidoggy**: "People who give this less than a 5 aren’t blonde, skinny, rich, or bitches."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "that V magazine cover tho, only little monsters remember. This song doesn’t get a 10 for two very important reasons: Just ask your gay friends their advice/Before you.../Get a spray tan on holiday/In Taipei, stereotyping much? and Walk down the runway, but don’t pute/It’s okay/You just had a salad today eating disorders aren’t a joke miss gaga. Joanne is still worse than this tho."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Gaga embraces camp on this track and it works. The melody leaves a little something to be desired but it stands out on the album as one of the most fun tracks."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I remembered how Ryan Murphy announced that he is doing an American Crime Story season based on Donatella Versace's brother's murder and I thought that Gaga would be perfect casting to play Donatella. It's sad this casting is a missed opportunity because she is busy focusing on A Star is Born and preparing her Joanne World Tour but I am very sure Penélope Cruz would do a great job playing Donatella!"

**banananaise**: ""i'm a rich bitch, i'm the upper class" wow Gaga just ended socialism" iconic capitalist bop

**throwaway963963963**: "I was doing this rate when I suddenly remembered that this was one of my first "guilty pleasure" pop songs. Years ago I was listening to Applause on youtube and this came on in one of those Artpop full album playlists and little tween me was SHOOK and it's been in my library since. I only recently realized that I've been listening to an Artpop deep-cut for years before I actually got into pop or music in general."

**awhile2**: "fun fact: this song was inspired by our very own Popheads mod /u/dolantello" This is true

**kappyko**: "that shouty chorus makes this entire song, so catchy!"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "there are 3 songs about essentially the same thing on this album and this is the best of them. iconic intro, iconic bridge, iconic DONATELLA"

# Definitely not a little bit of a bitch

**enecks**: "I liked my fashion songs to be lighter and more romantic than this. I'd be lying if I said that I didn't quote the rich bitch line on a daily basis for a year."

**wildcosmias**: "not as bad as i remembered it to be, but "fashion!" does camp SO much better"

**skiddos**: "artpop has so many messy edm songs"

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "for an album that was supposed to usher in a new age of art and pop this sure is dull"

**tron94**: "Most Skipped Song of 2013"

# Heavenly

**Elitefourbrad**: "A good ballad, hence the word good."

**specfagular**: "This is a slow song but it's not boring and is actually VERY NICE. Take note REST OF THE DAMN ALBUM"

**enecks**: "Honestly, I'm not going to even make a snarky joke, this song is too beautiful."

**mokitsu**: "until i read this was about bey's miscarriage (proven false - but still) i hated it, but it's such a gorgeous vulnerable, heart wrenching emotional ballad. its repetitiveness puts the vocals and emotions on the forefront, starting from sadness and ending with despair. the prayer at the end is the perfect bridge from the darkest track in the album to the most hopeful one."

**justdancegottabeok**: "Probably one of the the best ballads I've ever heard. And yes, that's indeed something to say. It's brought with so many emotions, it's just outright enthralling. Her vocal performance is top tier. And also, much respect to that production work too."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "With how loud and overproduced this album could be, a stripped back piano ballad was much needed, and Beyoncé delivered. A touching display of vulnerability, Beyoncé bravely opens up about a very dark part of her life in a beautiful fashion. I tear up a little when she abandons her hearty belt and sings in a gentle falsetto about “going home.”"

**Magic_warlock0-**: "A deeply emotional song, definitely one meant to say goodbye to a loved one. Beyonce is just so full of a hidden strength, and that prayer at the end ties the whole thing together."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this feels so personal and intense despite the stripped down instrumental. it didn't make me cry but it made me aesthetically sway my head in sadness"

# Opposite of Heavenly

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "I remember hating this song, now I just don’t care about it at all. Also I hate bo be picky but that prayer in Spanish is wrong, it should be “Padre nuestro, que estás en los Cielos, santificado sea tu nombre, venga tu Reino, hágase tu voluntad así en la tierra como en el cielo amén.” As usual thanks to BOOTS."

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "probably the one song I’d consider dropping, it’s nice but not necessary"

**wearingsox**: "Boring ballad Beyonce."

**JohnnyToby**: "made me into an atheist"

One of the songs that took the longest to understand is one of my favorites on the album. This is my favorite intro in the rate, obvi, because it really is an introduction moreso than a single song. The beginning describes her killing her "former", and starting her new era of pop, signaling a transition from BTW to ARTPOP.

# THEN THE BEAT GOOOOOOOOOOEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSS HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRDD

Like goddamn Gaga it explodes into crazy and unrelenting verses that are on of my favorite things from any songs ever. The way some lines, in particular "I'm not a wandering slave" and "I may not walk on your street or shoot a gun on your soil", are sang is so blissfully its hard not to m e l t. Its just such a good introduction to an album that really does follow up on ths crazy joyride.

Im also shocked it got so far tbh. Its so weird i expected it to be lower. Happy though!

---

# Wandering Slaves To Gaga
**Elitefourbrad**: "The best album starter since Marry The Night, the Arabian guitar opens us up to Gaga’s world of EDM. The first things she says is that “I killed by former on Highway 10”, which many interpret to Gaga killing Beyonce in the Paparazzi/Telephone/Aura trilogy of music videos that was never finished. Zedd helped produced this track and you can totally see his musical influence. Gaga’s vocals are all over the place in this track, with her going from a laughing vocal effect, to almost screaming the verses, to the breathy chorus and finally to the robotic “Dance. Sex. Art. Pop”."

**MrSwearword**: "A bit weird even by Gaga standards but I love the nuttiness"

**enecks**: "I first listened to artpop when I had just finished my HSC, and was ready to enter the world as a trans woman. Gaga meant a lot to me; she was a symbol of LGBT+ rights and compassion when I really needed one. It helped that she also made killer pop tracks. So, with much eager anticipation, I put in this album. When I was greeted with weedy guitars and distorted vocals, I knew I was in for the musical ride of my life. This song was such a confusing maelstrom to me; production a mix of western guitar and thumping EDM; lyrics a thematic clusterfuck of murder, sex, fame, religion, art and pop. It left me shook."

**VeganSquash**: "my mom got me an ARTPOP cd when I was like 15, and I was all "wtf I hate Gaga" but I gave it a try, and I fell in love with ARTPOP so much that I became a Gaga stan. This song is one of my favorites of Gaga, its batshit INSANE and the chorus is so electrifying."

**misstututulle**: "Aura is often viewed as a 'sequel' to Telephone, but I see it more a rebirth for Gaga. Aura is the leading track from ARTPOP and it works as a great introduction for the insanity of the album to come."

**Dr_Brewer**: "Solid intro, but it could have been even better if she had kept the original title of "Burqa." Judas 2.0-level controversy would have made this era more interesting."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "I’m not sure what makes me like this track, maybe the guitars, maybe the chopped vocals, maybe the weird voice or maybe it’s just that this song makes me feel like I’m strutting down a runway. Maybe it’s all of them at the same time. The ending is weird tho, I’ll give you that. Can’t believe she then released Joanne."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Honestly a pretty solid opening to the album, and it really lets you know that you are in for a RIDE. It starts off sounding like a ukulele Nancy Sinatra track and then suddenly Gaga is singing laughter and then she’s saying aura in a Spanish accent. And suddenly she’s playing a character and there’s synth everywhere then suddenly Gaga is belting and the synth is gone but then it’s back and now they’re just whispering words like “art” and “sex” and you can consider it a warning."

**dropthehammer11**: "A hypnotic, fucking crazy intro. This may have turned me gay idk yet"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Two songs in one. I WANTED A WESTERN BOP GAGA. But then she comes in with this fucking BANGER and I’M SCALPED. DANCE. SEX. ARTPOP. SAME BITCH SAME."

**awryj**: "Oh my, what an opening. Over-the-top, campy, ultrafuturistic yet baroque, decadent, put it in a blender, shit on it, et cetera"

**ignitethephoenix**: "Beginning was a bit weird, but the chorus is great. Not a fan of the random auto tuned parts of her voice. This song is a roller coaster of feelings. But after my second listen, I actually really appreciate the theatrics of the song."

# Women of ^^^^(poor) Choice

**wildcosmias**: "an over-produced, cacophonous mess, but that chorus !"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This song sounds ridiculously dated. Each drop wears its dubstep and electronic house influence on its sleeve, and it’s probably not for the best. Despite this, Gaga’s vocals and lyrics hold up this track, and I’m sure I probably would’ve been shook in 2013 if I heard this. But it should’ve stayed there, because it doesn’t sound good now."

**dirdbub**: "Gaga, as much as I love you, I don't want to see you naked. I'm still too gay for larger hairy men for that"

**lassidoggy**: "It’s an overproduced mess from start to finish, so I guess it’s a good song to represent Artpop."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "The intro starts off pretty shit, the chorus is too repetitive, it's a bit messy like all of us. At least it's got a good electronic beat!"

**mms82**: "I've undergone some intense physical pain in my life, and the three minutes listening to this song rivals them all. In literal pain.

# UHHHHHNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN CUNT DISHYUUUUUUUUUUUUUNAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL -lee

Great song, wonderful production, and somewhat decent lyrics from Katy. Also done dirty. Grrr.


---
# I WILL LOVE YOU

**Elitefourbrad**: "The best single from *PRISM*. The beat is great here along with Katy’s vocals."

**mokitsu**: "i fucking LOVE this song, probably my favorite KP track. the drums beats are so epic and the chorus is great. i also live for the lyrics and the BRIDGE omg. "acceptance is key, to be truly free will you do the same for me?" UNCONDISHONAL!!!!!! UNCONDISHONALLYYYYYY"

**skiddos**: "Okay, I hate the way she says unconditionally, but every other aspect of this song is so beautiful. She pronounces it correctly towards the end, so the pronunciation doesn't bother me too much. The production is ethereal with the theatrical instrumentation and the raindrop-like sound. Her vocals on ballads always sound amazing. My favorite part of the song is the bridge. How elegant and grandiose the song sounds just snatches me every time I listen to it."

**Leixander**: "A good Katy ballad? After Thinking Of You? This song proves it is possible!"

**thefighter987**: "it’s a leftover from the self empowerment songs off her last album, but it’s just as good."

**musicotic**: "One of my favorite songs on the album Deserved so much more. Beautiful ballad. Chorus is fantastic, super catchy and easy to get into. Was on my 5 song PRISM playlist"

**jamesfog**: "Iconic ballop"

**xanthalasajache**: "One of Pop's biggest crime, pronouncing a word differently on the same line. Great verse though"

**PandoraKris**: "Thanks for your sex, John Mayer!"

# UHHHHHN-CUUUNT-DISH-YUN-AAAAHHLEEEEEEEE

**huntyphobic**: "Katy screaming really loudly because she can’t reach high notes is so funny to me cdnsksdckjsdbc"

**MrSwearword**: "this is atrociously sung and horribly overwrought"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this is such a beautiful ballad and tbh i'd love to hear this covered by an actual vocalist"

**henry413**: "Katy pronouncing unconditionally as Uncle DeshawnAli ruined the song for me."

**ignitethephoenix**: "Whenever I hear this song, I think about how my English teacher was annoyed by this song because of how katy perry said unconditionally and how she said it with the wrong amount of syllables."

**throwaway963963963**: "My kindergarten teacher taught me to break up my words too, kety"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "someone get katy a damn pronunciation guide, this is more forced than the GOP's damn healthcare act"

Jealous of just how good this chorus is. Seriously, bey's delivery here is unrivaled and its so amazing. One of the high points of the album bc it does what the album does best: a short, sweet, brilliant pop song. 

---
# Keepin' their Promise

**fifthchevron**: "I wish that you were me/So you could feel this feeling, is the GOAT lyric."

**enecks**: "Here is a song that delivers a power ballad that still makes Beyoncé seem flawed and human in a way that I love. Love this production. Blessed be Beyoncé."

**wildcosmias**: "the vulnerability and restrained fury in her nuanced delivery of "just one shot left of this drink in this glass/***don't make be break it.***" is enough for me to give this my 11"

**mokitsu**: "much like Blow, i've only started liking this track recently, but the first thing i've loved about it is that it's right after the "i love you till you fuck me to death" song that is partition. this is pretty much If I Were A Boy part II, it works and it's probably the most straight forward song in the album tbh."

**misstututulle**: "My 11, Jealous, is an underrated song. From the vulnerable lyrics that feel similar to another great Yonce track 'Sorry', to the dark throbbing production. It feels like a perfect mix many of Bey's other great songs. From the aforementioned vulnerability to her storytelling ability, her emotive delivery, catchy chorus and beautiful vocals. Jealous may not stand out as much as some other cuts, but no other song in the rate makes me feel quite the same."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "One of the few songs on this album with a story, it works quite well. It’s kind of ruined by the backup vocals and screams distracting from Beyoncé, who delivers a stellar performance on this track. This is one of the few songs on the album with real nuance to the lyrics, she does really paint a good picture of a woman trapped in this situation and comes up with an interesting angle to approach it from."

**chubs4life**: "Nick Jonas thought"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "It's kinda weird how this song started off intense and then it got so happy all of the sudeen. That's probably the point as the atmosphere is supposed to represent Beyonce's emotions in the song."

# Not Jealous

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "cooking naked is not safe. The beat is nice tho but the whole song is too repetitive. My opinion about this song hasn’t changed since 2003. As usual thanks to Lyrica Anderson, Brian Soko [Anashe Music], BOOTS, Rasool Diaz, Dre Moon and Detail."

**VeganSquash**: "kinda boring tbfh"

**dirdbub**: "this is a non-song"

**JohnnyToby**: "boring"

**XwildcatXJH**: "didnt really care for this song"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Nick Jonas did it better."

# This song is like Beyoncé's *Lemonade*

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Pre-Lemonade."

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "Lemonade: the prequel."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "Gorgeous song. Feel like it could work well in Lemonade too."

**superr_rad**: "yall acted brand new when lemonade dropped but with tracks like these in Bey's discography we been knew"

Things this remix does right: less perverts

Things this remix does wrong: Xtina is here instead

---

# Jesus Christ-ina Aguilera

**Syfawx**: "Okayy Christian raises the score a bit."

**TheShineSoul**: "Christina gives it a bit more edge, I prefer this version a little more."

**enecks**: "This was one of the best songs from the album for me. Here was a song that was straightforward and coherent in production and lyrics; catchy electropop meeting submissiveness as an allegory for media attention. It was a polished gem. Learning about the R Kelly stuff was horrifying, as now this classic of a song was associated with a horrible person. However, the Christina Aguilera version allowed me to enjoy this BOP guilt-free."

**ImOnABeach**: "A lot better than the album version, great vocals from both artists."

**ignitethephoenix**: "Two icons serving vocals and looks and drinking champagne like the queens they are (I'm watching the Voice performance rn)"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "still a bop, just a less problematic bop."

**throwaway963963963**: "A song that I like to call: What Could Have Been ft. Potential & a #1"

# Chri-satan-tina Aguilera

**Elitefourbrad**: "While this is not as good as the original, Xtina gives the album a much needed female voice other than Gaga. The verse she has is better than R. Kelly’s, but she doesn’t have as good of a range as him, which is why that’s better for me."

**OliverQueer**: "Still good but I prefer the original version."

One of the best sex anthems ever. The heavenly production is only matched by the switching up between breathy whispery vocals and the singing in the verses. The prechorus? Perfection. Lyrically fucking hot(said your boyfriend was away this weekend, wanna meet at my place), distorted out the wazoo in the best possible way, and serves as a really great buildup to the explosive chorus. Honestly, this song is just so good and so well put together its amazing. I think its one of the bigger successes off of ARTPOP in that it is both really weird and a really well, perfectly so, put together pop song. Iconic.

---
# Convicted Criminals of Thought

**enecks**: "When I started listening to this song for the first time, I didn't know what was up. What was this echoey production? What was going on with the vocals? But then the chorus kicked in, I WAS IN. I can relate to the subject matter a bit too much :eyes:."

**justdancegottabeok**: "Totally pop, yet again fascinatingly weird. The spoken bit at the end of the bridge is obviously the highlight."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Okay, more 2012 dance vibes. It’s kinda all over the place. But, Gaga on here is really Gaga, and I love how much personality the track has, even if it’s really cluttered."

**skiddos**: "the instrumental for this song is one of pop's biggest pleasures and a highlight of gaga's career imo"

**lady_sable**: "Honestly just the way she says "When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you" ends me."

**chubs4life**: "Ok so recently I had one of the dirtiest dreams about one of my straight classmates. This song had been relatable ever since. So Evan, if you ever read this, I can't  believe I'm telling you this but I've had a couple of drinks and oh my god..."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I feel like a lot of people forget that Gaga is actually queer. I live for a song that has Gaga explicitly talking about her wanting to fuck a woman and this is not queer-baiting at all. I live for that part where she had that speaking interlude. Way to end a bridge!"

**SkyBlade79**: "this chorus is great but the first verse is trash"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "Gaga honestly makes the best sexy anthems. The production just feels so slinky and dirty and by the time the "When I lay in bed I touch myself and think of you hits" I've lost myself in the song. Fun fact: Gaga likes fucking gay guys with boyfriends."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Triple x triple sex, number 3 of ARTPOP's ***FLAWLESS sex songs. Jerking off about your crush who is taken. Relatable."

# Really nasty things

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this chorus ruins the tension the verses build up tbh. regular pop chorus after those slinky, grimy verses? no!"

**mokitsu**: "this song has a good concept and nice build-up....the chorus ruins it! sounds very anti climatic"

**VeganSquash**: "way too overproduced for how good the lyrics are"

**Magic_warlock0-**: "I get nightmares if this plays during my sex(x) dreams. No thanks, I really dislike the chorus and the beat; that little interlude drives me up the wall."

# Inevitable Pokemon Reference

**throwaway963963963**: "I like to think of I Like It Rough -> Sexxx Dreams -> Dancing In Circles as kind of starter Pokemon evolution. Which explains why this song is that middle evo that is neither cute nor amazing but just kind of there."

# DEDICATION TO ARTPOP

**Elitefourbrad**: "Okay so I kind of have a funny story for this song. I’m was going to perform a little set for one of the biggest clubs in the school and last minute I find a bench and think, “Oh! I think I want to do Sexxx Dreams for an opener now!”. So my team laces it up with pink to try and match the artRave one. I go out and sing my ass off and people got really horny that were watching it. I had to go hide in the back room for a minute or two after the performance before addressing the crowd because people were trying to do “stuff” to each other. Anyways, I got a lot of weird looks after that performance, but I was invited back for an encore the week after so I guess they liked it?"

The piano beat here is really lovely, and Blue Ivy's feature is one of the cutest things ever, but the the lyrics drop the ball on this song. However, this is a ballop, and a fairly good one at that. It think Heaven should've been the closer though:sad:

---
# "Everything is Blue"

**MrSwearword**: "one of the few song/video combos that have made me cry"

**Syfawx**: "What?! Another beautiful song?!"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this song is the sound equivalent of getting a hug from your mom (or favorite parent figure if you dont get along with yours) and i love love love it. my mom cried the first time she heard it too i love her so much"

**VeganSquash**: "One of the best, if not THE BEST, bridges I have ever heard. Whenever musicians dedicate songs to their children, they seem so genuine and heartwarming."

**misstututulle**: "Blue is just a beautiful ode to her daughter. It manages to feel personally Beyonce's while still working and being touching on a grander scale when thinking about the ones you love. Great standard edition closer. Gets +1 because Grown Woman isn't in the rate and I'm pressed."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Pretty heartwarming, good closer. It's not very memorable compared to the other tracks."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "“Heaven” is by far the heaviest track on the album, and I was wondering how Beyoncé was gonna segue out of it and close out the album, and then came this. Following the same pattern of stripped back production that “Heaven” had, but with additional instrumentation that gives it fresh life, and finishing it off with the sounds of her child could have been corny but it works so well here. The best song on the album possibly."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is the only Beyonce song I know I will give a 10 to on the rate before actually re-listening to the album for the rate with no visuals. This is such a low-key yet beautiful song that closes and ties the album together. Please don't tell me the moment at the end of the song where Blue tries to pronounce her mother's name is cute and you give this song such bad scores."

**ignitethephoenix**: "Blue Ivy did that! Truly Ashad's inspiration here. Can't wait to see what the Beyoncé twins come up with."

**throwaway963963963**: "Fucking shit I wasn't ready for this take my ten and leave me alone im fucking crying"

**Magic_warlock0-**: "More than any song on the track, this song is pure LOVE right here. A song dedicate to the love a parent has for their child; absolutely beautiful in lyrics, tone, background, everything! I love hearing this, it's like direct insight into Queen Bey's heart."

# "I don't wanna be blue anymore"

**Elitefourbrad**: "I think it’s cute to have your little daughter on a song, but did you really need to do that? And at least make it sound good next time."

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "as sweet as this is, so incredibly cliche. the twins better get a better song"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "You know how I said XO was bland, I take that back. If you look the word Bland up in the dictionary, this song is listed in the definition."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "i dont like kids, this manipulative capitalist move wont work on me hunty"

NOW THIS IS THE BEST VERSION.

The most normal song on the album tbh. The wub wub production makes me do... things. Gaga slays her vocals in this song. I mean seriously, it is insane how fucking perfect her voice is here, damn. The chorus is absolutely insane, and is one of the best hooks in the entire album. And, as awful as R.Kelly is, he does his part seriously well. The live performances of this song are some of Gaga's best. Seriously, imagine how much higher DWUW would've peaked if it got an MV and didn't feature R.Kelly. marvelous

---
# Don't stop this party

**Elitefourbrad**: "Despite all the controversy with R. Kelly, you can’t simply deny this is easily one of Gaga’s best songs of all time. The message it’s conveying is good and Gaga pours all her heart into the vocals on this R&B-inspired track."

**MrSwearword**: "it fucking slays, controversy over R. Kelly feature be damned. Released on my birthday of 2013 so it is always a ten for that reason too."

**OliverQueer**: "A great R&B track! Both their voices fit so well together. I wish he didn't pee on children so I don't feel bad every time I bop my bussy to this."

**mokitsu**: "omg what a BOP. such a nice departure from the sound vomit that was artpop until now. r kelly's verse is amazing tbh."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Wow, the feature being R. Kelly is tragic, because the beat is really great, and everything else follows suit. It feels very Gaga, and honestly doesn’t seem as dated as most of the other tracks."

**misstututulle**: "R Kelly's history be damned, he sounds *smooth* as hell on DWUW. Combined with Gaga, they could've smashed. If only it weren't for the controversy surrounding the feature and"

**Dr_Brewer**: "Questionable choice to bring in R. Kelly, but his voice is as good as ever."

**BionicFunhouse**: "R. Kelly is gross, but Lady Gaga’s parts are immaculate. I wish the solo version was on the album instead of this."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "we could have had it all, also lowkey me whenever I arrive to a dick appointment. RELATABLE. Also, I don’t care if this has a d e e p meaning, I can slut drop to this ergo this is good. I can’t slut drop to anything from Joanne ergo Do What U Want is good. Facts."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Obviously it's inherently messy to have R. Kelly on a song this sexual, but the groove is still incredible and Gaga and R. Kelly have great chemistry."

**jimmy345960**: "This song, to me, is the best in this rate. That opening is iconic. The way R Kelly says those opening lines is iconic, enough to get me to put this above the Christina A. verison ...Dirrty still slays dw. I don't care about R. Kelly's questionable character when rating this song, something I usually care about for someone like him/Chris Brown/Bill Cosby, the song is that good. This iconic bops slays and it will stay in my playlist forever to come."

**JunkyGS**: "r Kelly is a rapist pedo, but that isn’t as bad as listening to Jewels N Drugs"

**white_anarchist_teen**: "why did anyone think that it was a good idea to feature R. Kelly on a track like this"

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I had to knock a lil fraction of a point off for R. Kelly."

**10footnotes**: "I mean, it's one of the best songs on the album musically (finally a song that doesn't have completely maximalist production), but the lyrics and feature... exist."

**the_monkey_**: "hey R Kelly, Do what u want with my body! *golden shower ensues* Gaga: ART^pop"

**Wailordfan**: "Very overrated imo. I don't really think the song would have been saved if it was a different R&B artist singing with her. The song is just so overtly sexual that I don't think it would've done well if done with someone not accused of child rape."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "I just don't like this song, and not just because of R.Kelly but it's a part of it. Ick."

# the assays :deadbanana:

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Part of me wants to think that in a meta sense Gaga was making a statement by collaborating with a known child molester on a song specifically about how the industry tries to own her soul but only owns her body. Think about it: Gaga is a sexual assault survivor who is extremely outspoken in support of other such people, but in order to succeed in the industry she’s often forced to work with dubious individuals who don’t share her convictions, and are in many cases perpetrators themselves. By collaborating with a child molester on this particular track, Gaga is giving us an example of the industry owning her body (of work) but reassuring us that she still, at her core, is on our side. If you look into the lyrics, the metaphor becomes clearer. Lady Gaga is singing about defiantly retaining her standards in the face of the industry, but R. Kelly is singing a straightforward sex jam about living luxuriously with Gaga. Kelly is playing the role of devil’s advocate (the industry in this case) attempting to seduce Gaga into a life of blind excess, completely unaware that Gaga is anything but a subservient pawn in this case. Or maybe Gaga just wanted money, I dunno. Regardless, one of the stronger songs on ARTPOP because it actually has a point to make."

**thefighter987**: "R Kelly is an abysmal person but that doesn’t change how perfect everything here is. The sexy 80s bassline, the useage of sex as an allegory for public image, gaga’s growls, the earworm hook . Hell, I’ll even defend r kelly. His vocals here are as tight as ever and he always had a lot of charisma. I know he’s probably the worst man in music currently working, but I can enjoy some of chris brown’s and john lennon's work despite them being horrible human beings. R Kelly shouldn't be different. An artist’s personal life shouldn’t affect a song unless it’s referenced such on CB’s worst songs. This probably would have gotten my 11 if I didn’t know so many of you would have given it zeros based on the people behind the song. Also, the 2013 ama performance of this song is what got me to stan gaga."

# Blow

**Elitefourbrad**: "I love the vibe from this song, Bey is more energetic here and I’m living for it! Better than Kesha’s Blow by miles and the sexy vibes are starting to come through."

**MrSwearword**: "THE DIRTIER VERSION OF “MILKSHAKE” WE WERE CHEATED OUT OF BECAUSE BEYONCE & HER DUMBASS TEAM DECIDED “XO” WAS A GOOD SINGLE."

**specfagular**: "a much better sex song than Sexxx Dreams. Funky and makes me wanna get out and go get FUCKED. It still overstays its welcome though, much like Haunted"

**mokitsu**: "i've recently, after 4 years, found LOVE for this bop. everything is about it perfect. the throwback sound is also an anomaly in such a forward thinking album but Bey pulls it off so well. it's so explicitly sexual without sounding as vulgar as say, Drunk in Love. my favorite part has to be those "yeaaaaaahhhhhhhh"s"

**Bingcrusher**: "Me"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Serving Prince and Janet Jackson teas"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This song goes OFF, that production with the guitars and horns and that beat switch takes it to another level, I don't know how you could mess up a song with Justin Timberlake, Timbaland, Pharrell, The-Dream, and James Fauntleroy on it and Bey definitely didn't"

**BionicFunhouse**: "just nutted."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "The first good track on the album and among the best of them. The 1980’s inspired groove is irresistible, and the production finally serves Beyoncé well. That bass line is one of the best I’ve ever heard and the shift the song takes on the bridge is great. The double entendres are fun, and the coy sexiness of the song is so right. She makes sex sound like a party. It helps that it’s my favorite music video on the visual album."

**chubs4life**: "" I CAN'T WAIT TILL I GET HOME SO YOU CAN TURN THAT CHERRY OUT" - Says I, at an edible arrangements store buying chocolate covered cherries."

**VodkaInsipido**: "The first contender for best song of the album. It’s THE funky bop, and goddamn is it good. If it weren’t because of Partition and XO, this would be my 11 because it makes my bussy and thrussy pop."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "TURN HER CHERRY OUT GODDAMMIT

**Magic_warlock0-**: "Well, if you're offering, Beyonce, I'm down! In all seriousness, I've always loved the sensual flow that the Queen offers up throughout the song. I can almost hear her desire for some passion right now!"

# No

**Dr_Brewer**: "What is this pseudo-sultry mess? The album started spectacularly and fell off hard with this song."

**awryj**: "It's cool and funky, but I can't help but feel very uncomfortable when someone lists off euphemisms for vagina flicking. I mean, it's kind of like Charli's and Cupcakke's Lipgloss, but it was meant to be sorta obnoxious. This one's just... Not tasty."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "kesha did it better don't /u/ me"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "Starts off very slow, but picks up eventually. Still one of the weakest songs in the album."

**musicotic**: "Wth is this trash. The word cherry is now forever ruined for me"

# Please get him a room he is starting to worry me

**SpanKKy1**: "What I'm gonna do to Shawn"

Ghost isn't excellent. Haunted on the other hand is one of the best things Bey has ever done. Beyonce sounds brilliant here. Flawless. Perfect. It really does a good job at setting an atmosphere around you, but i think its kinda sad she didn't continue this kinda atmosphere throughout the album.

---

# Haunted

**enecks**: "This song explores fame, image, and creativity in a way that only Beyoncé could. Blessed be Beyoncé."

**mokitsu**: "from the first listen i've loved this song, the double part thing was such a crazy concept that left me shocked and confused - is this another song?? but it's still the same track??? - overall i'd say i like the stream of consciousness minimalistic vibe of ghost more than haunted, but both are career highlights and they fit together so well in the same track. it's always so shocking to hear Bey say "probably won't make no money out this"...to me this is the most timeless song on the album."

**justdancegottabeok**: "Oh, I could write essays about this song. This two-parted dark, sexy masterpiece is a contender for my favourite song ever, in all honesty. "Ghost" may be the most sincere piece of work Beyoncé has ever delivered to us, expressing her frustration about the music industry. Together with the dubstep-influenced production, it all comes together as rather ambient. And then, after the iconic spoken bit, the bass drops, and "Haunted" comes in. Being all about sexual desire, the production influenced by both dance-pop and R&B gives a somewhat lovable, sinister tone that has never been witnessed before. Overall, this is just something special. It's something new, a complete pioneer tune for the artist herself. It's her magnum opus."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A wild two-parter, Haunted starts out with Ghost, and then concludes with Haunted. Both halves are equally great, and feel as black and wispy as the title and album cover suggests. Haunted as a whole is a long track that evolves and deserves every second of its 6 minute runtime, leading up to the truly powerful outro."

**Leixander**: "Never thought Beyoncé of all people would sing this kind of song... Ghost is perfect and the transition into Haunted is also awesome."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "In Ghost, Bey gets honest on the risks she is making on this album. Not only the sound is unique from what Bey usually makes, Beyonce's plan from having a music video for each song and releasing the album with no prior promotion was a very risky move and so unheard of. Oh the irony of Bey saying "Probably won't make no money off this, oh well". It didn't just make a lot of money, the album itself was such a turning point for Bey herself and the music industry. Whether you like the album itself or not, if you try to downplay the album's impact on the industry, you're probably KellyAnne Conway. I am not normally a fan of double songs in one track but I feel like Ghost and Haunted shared the same themes as it's about Beyonce looking back at her career as well as her looking forward to the future of her career that time."

**jelboo**: "So. Before this album, I thought Beyoncé was sexy, her voice was great, and lots of her songs were catchy and cool, but her albums had a lot of boring, generic, 'I don't need no man'-material. But this album revealed her as a serious artist, who dared to make music that was different, and unexpected, and I will always admire the guts it took to release some of the songs on this album. A haunting, hypnotic wonder."

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "The beat that drops at 2:05 is my favorite Beyoncé moment ever. Also there's just so much going on in this song and it all works great together. The little bridge in the middle is awesome too, and then it picks up again and it continues being great. Converted me to a Beyoncé believer basically."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "*Ghost* was a perfect intro to the main song of *Haunted*, and I feel like when people talk about Self-Titled trying out new sounds for Bey this is EASILY the best example and it does that amazingly. Despite its length it has great replay value for me."

**Wailordfan**: "This song is probably the first non-single Beyonce song I ever heard, and the music video kinda changed my life, but not really. It was just really good."

**stardustanddinos**: "what a song. both halves of the song flow into each other with ease, and have a sexy and haunting vibe - accentuated more by the music video. Bey's vocals are restrained and sexy, just amazing all around."

# Bored

**Elitefourbrad**: "A dreary song for me, and I think it could’ve been better with a better instrumental."

**TheShineSoul**: "Plain boring"

**the_monkey_**: "really bland tbh"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "i dont like kids, this manipulative capitalist move wont work on me hunty"

**dirdbub**: "I'm haunted by the fact of how boring this song is"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "the first part Ghost is a messy mess that I do not understand at all, also wasn’t this at one point two different tracks? I remember Ghost and Haunted being two separate tracks. Thank you BOOTS for writing this. Ghost is 4 and Haunted is a 8 so average is 6. Haunted is a 8 bc it’s catchy not because lyrics cause they are basic af. Like the first parts is supposed to be about how this album is a risk and how she wants it to be deep but then a minute later she’s like “slap me! I’m pinned to the doorway/Kiss, bite, foreplay” and okay honey sex is good but it kinda cheapens the message?? Like go be a thot and whatever but… idk."

# "Only came for the cake"

**borpo**: "Love the 70s pop sound"

**mokitsu**: "this is such a fun, chill bop! it's scientifically proven to make you happy and during this era it was my favorite single and it's probably why i have so many last.fm plays of PRISM before 2017."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This sounds like TGIF part 2 tbh. It’s a decent song, and there’s not really anything I can pin down as a negative, but I feel like I’ve seriously heard this song from her before. The bridge is really nice, but nothing else stands out."

**misstututulle**: "This is the kind of Katy I wish was on more of PRISM. Sleek, bubblegum pop is where Katy does her magic, and Birthday is no exception. This had the potential to be like the AIWFCIY or the Party in the USA of birthdays, but somehow it didn't get through (and totally not because the actual video sucked ass)."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This almost got my eleven, I love this song so much. It’s a sheer sugary delight of a song. It’s campy, it’s fun, it’s catchy, I love it. The funky, pseudo-disco vibes are bright and colorful, and the lyrics are so cheeky and corny you just have to smile at them. I rank the lyric video for this song among the best straight up music videos I’ve ever seen, and I even found myself laughing a few times during the much maligned “Katy Perry ruins people’s parties” music video. This is the best song on the album."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "A goddamn bop, I was shocked that Katy was capable of putting together such a memorable and cheerful song! It hits all the right things to make it a excellent piece of music; sex references, creative lyrics, strong chorus, and a great beat!"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "TGIF but more boring and incredibly sexual. I truly feel for the soccer moms that played this at their 6-year old son's birthdays and then the other moms were like "that is unacceptable Susan, my Bartholomeu the third got a boner because of that song" and then they gave Susan "the stare" when she went to buy muffins at the supermarket and completely ignored her and didn't invite her or her son Quadeson to Gunther's birthday party, where they played educative songs like Meghan Trainer's "No"."

**kappyko**: "come on, guys. this song deserved better on the charts. essentially a Last Friday Night 2.0, this could've easily replaced it on Teenage Dream. it's stellar dance-pop with cute tendencies. thank god the lyric video makes up for the tragic official video."

# Doesn't Like Cake

**huntyphobic**: "that bridge is just so bad that idk what else to say"

**MrSwearword**: "if the Terrible Twos existed in song form, this is it."

**enecks**: "I would rather listen to Birthday Cake on loop for the rest of my life than listen to this song again. This song is embarrassing as fuck. The innuendo is so embarrassing. And now KP is trying to make woke pop? Give me a fucking break."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i am so over katy's food metaphors for sex"

VodkaInsipido: Did I ever tell you about my cousin's communion? Well see, he's 8. He did his communion in May, this May. I posted about it in a General Discussion, about how I was bored until they played Humble. They asked if we could play some songs and unlucky me, my girl cousins didn't allow me to play Mask Off, XO Tour Lif3, Magnolia... etc aka the best songs of the year. So they asked if they could play Birthday, which is an upbeat song, and as I thought *oh, it's by Katy, of course kids will love it* I signed my letter of acceptance in hell.

Friday morning, I discovered Birthday is actually a sexual song.

As you know if you've been in the Discord, I was shook.

Picture a communion, classic communion, kids in a pool, some outside, some eating cake, all dancing to a song that mentions: 

* *give you a taste*
* *big, big, big, big, big, big balloons* 
* *have your cake*

Luckily, kids don't understand english. And they're stupid. And some don't understand sex either, but one of my cousins caught his parents fucking so who am I to judge. Unlucky to me, this will weigh in my concience for the rest of my existence. Thank you Katy for ruining my life.

Another song that was pushed out of the top 10 at the very end. Its a very nice song with a very nice message, but the mv ousthines the song tbh. The first time she goes into the chorus, especially if its unexpected, is mind-boggling tho and i cant really explain why.

# "Pretty Hurts" is Pretty

**MrSwearword**: "2ND GREATEST SONG OF HER CAREER. SHOULD’VE BEEN THE LEAD SINGLE INSTEAD OF “XO”."

**enecks**: "Hearing this song for the first time was like seeing one of your friends reach their untapped potential for me. Here was Beyoncé with some stunning production, feminist lyrics about body image that actually say something, and a stunning vocal performance. Blessed be Beyoncé."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "most of my comments have been kinda silly (or just bitchy, i'll admit), but i wanna get serious for a second. this song/video means a lot to me. i'll admit it's kinda out of place to open your most experimental album to that point with a more straight up pop song, but lyrically this song really kinda punches me in the gut. i have really bad body image issues (as in straight up body dysmorphic disorder), and hearing someone i admire sing about something like this is so important to me. "ain't got no doctor or pill that can take the pain away/the pain's inside and nobody frees you from your body" is usually the point where i start crying because those lines hit such a personal point. the video is also really amazing but difficult to watch; the workout & weigh scene, that shot of Bey in the bathroom stall, and that one contestant with the cotton ball dipped in juice are all places i've been more often than i'd like, and i just end up having a very emotional reaction to it. Pretty Hurts isn't Bey's best song or even my favorite on the album, but it's like the one Beyoncé song i feel a really strong personal connection to, so i love it."

**mokitsu**: "i will say that this anthem, despite sounding a bit off and generic in such a creative album, has helped me and my loved ones go through some real issues, and i'll always appreciate it for that. one thing that always sticks with me is the last lines..."are you happy with yourself?" even though i've listened to this album hundreds of times and i know the lyrics my subconscious response is "...no". i feel like this song is very cathartic - the background vocals give it such power that it compels you to think about your life, and if you're *really* happy with yourself..."

**justdancegottabeok**: "Seen as another female empowerement track I think this one goes much deeper and therefore is way more separatly. Sia delivers an amazing lyrical content here, and the power pop elements complete this as a powerful ballad."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "What a goddamn opening to an album. It’s a triumphant and ethereal feat of songwriting, and probably one of my favorite tracks on Beyoncé’s self-titled. Everything from the interesting opening, to the high-in-the-skies chorus, to the haunting question “Are you happy with yourself?” hits hard. Great damn song."

**skiddos**: "yes sia"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I love the maximalist, huge feel that this song grows to, the end of the song feels gigantic"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "While Bey relies more on Sia's powerful songwriting, her emotions in this song were genuine. We are so used to Bey as this perfect goddess that I think a lot of people especially her fans forget that she is human and she had to struggle a lot to maintain that Bey Queen image that she pulls off so well. This is such a great opener to one of her most personal albums in her discography."

**XwildcatXJH**: "Beyonce please claim me as one of your devout children holy shit what an album opener. Angelic vocals and iconic story."

**10footnotes**: "This song was getting my 11 from the beginning. It starts out quiet and intimate, then builds up into this grand production that fits its powerful message so well, and finally ends on the same intimate note to link the song together. But of course the production isn't the most important part of this song - it's the lyrics. I'll admit that I spend more time than I should wishing I was prettier, and the lyrics ring true to me and I'm sure countless other people (female and male) who have been forced to compare themselves to idealized versions of beauty in the media. This song has a feeling of raw truth unlike any of the other songs in this rate, and that's what makes it special for me."

**Wailordfan**: "I had/have body image issues a lot, and this song is a favorite go-to to just make me happy."

# "Pretty Hurts" Hurts

**Elitefourbrad**: "I like the message Bey, but I don’t like the production."

**Leixander**: "Repeats itself too much after a while..."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this has a nice message ngl but feels a little fake coming from Beyoncé. Thank you Sia and Ammo for writing this tho. I feel like this tried to be like “Fucking Perfect”/”Beautiful” but only managed to reach “Scars to your Beautiful”. Also it’s really hypocritical when she’s been caught quite a few times using photoshop on herself, idk 2013 me loved this a lot. And also she’s like pretty hurts but she still wants the crown?????"

**ImOnABeach**: "My least favorite song off of S/T. It sounds sonically different from the rest of the album and is so obviously a Sia song."

**robbiec_**: "ugly cry

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "Tbh this song angers me a little, because if pretty hurts, imagine how much ugly hurts smh. Great song though."

**superr_rad**: "i should like this more. the message is great, there's nothing wrong with it. but its so...generic? im trying to like it but its such a weak opener tbh. i still love the message and it certainly applies, but when this whole visual album is filled with the legitimately perfect beyonce...the message gets lost. sorry beyhive, i had to say it."

# I don't know what to say

**a_rain_of_tears**: "https://twitter.com/mamahanes/status/752360065646997504"

# He's worrying but is he wrong?

**SpanKKy1**: "Shawn must be in pain"

Apparently, according to you guys, this should've been a single. And it shouldve. This hardcorde higkey no tea bops. The "tonight" hook is excellent, the verses are "sweet sweet ecstasy that take me to utopia." 

---
# Walking On Air

**Elitefourbrad**: "Disco and house vibes come together for the best song on *PRISM*. Katy should’ve made this a single as well, I love this song like it’s my own child."

**Macubass**: "NASA & SpaceEx are shaking"

**TheShineSoul**: "Love how they swap the pre-chorus and chorus sound after the second verse. Great pop song."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "THIS IS KATY'S BEST SONG AND I WILL NEVER FORGIVE HER FOR DENYING IT THE SINGLE TREATMENT WE WERE ROOTING FOR YOU WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU"

**Jackcs903**: "Honestly Katy could really benefit from making more house influenced music, it works really well for her"

**skiddos**: "invented house"

**misstututulle**: "It was up to fans to choose between this and Dark Horse to be a promo single from PRISM, and while commercially DH did perform amazingly, there's no denying that WOA is the best of the two. Just by not being a wrought out ballad, it becomes one of my favourites off of PRISM."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Lyrical content is a little weak in comparison to the rest of the album, but it's still really catchy. Thumbs up for charting pretty high for a promo single."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Disco diva! I looked it up and the woman who sings the hook is named Sabina Ddumba, and she’s uncredited in what I can only assume is an homage to Martha Wash. I love it when Katy touches back into her gospel roots, and mixing disco and gospel is always fantastic. The bridge on this song is the best on the album, calling to mind the Weather Girls and CeCe Peniston, it’s a lovely send-up to house music."

**the_monkey_**: "euro disco Katy works, don't know why"

# Falling In Air

**MrSwearword**: "she stole portions from NiRe Alldai’s [“Hella Bad”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qRT-dVK0M4w)"

**mokitsu**: "this has always been one of my least favs from PRISM and it doesn't mean much but yeah. the bridge is heavenly and i love the "heaven is jealous of our love/angels are crying from up above" lyrics."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I appreciate the house instrumental here, and I think it starts off fine enough, but doesn’t really interest me during its duration. Like, there’s parts that are great, like the pre-chorus, but everything else is really flat."

**ignitethephoenix**: "Wow this may be the laziest chorus ever, to the point it ruins the rest of the song. IT CONTAINS 5 WORDS. Also the dance/electronic production makes it seems very out of place from everything else (even though I like the disco vibe) Also lyrics like 'You read me like erotica???!' I'm done with this song."

robbiec_: fat is the reason they haven't leaked because it is in places I don't want it ~~but some places I do~~ 

also some day I hope to be a young professional and I can't jeopardise my career ***over leaking my nudes over a mediocre Katy Perry song***

but then again i am messy

specfagular: Here are the scores I have for the remaining songs (not in any order since I don't want you sluts knowing my 11... she's still out there)

10, 8, 5, 7, 11, 10, 8, 8 10


Pretty much all the songs I have left are ones I either loved or liked (or in the case of my 11, am obsessed with), with the exception of the 5, which is Legendary Lovers bc that song isn't good can that ugly ho please go first?

17nova: ***Flawless and Drunk in Love lol. They're not awful, it's just that the production on both songs is difficult for me to listen to. I'm really not a trap person. 

I love the use of Adichie's feminist speech in ***Flawless, tho, and the "Wake up, flawless" hook in the latter half is pretty amazing - I just wish the rest of the song was more listenable.
