#ARTPOP
 
ARTFLOP. FARTPOP. ARTSTOP. BLARTPOP MALL COP. All of these insults plus a plenty more were hurled at ARTPOP following its less than monstrous release. Two years after the wild success of Born This Way, which sold 1 million copies in a week, Gaga introduced us to Applause, the lead single from ARTPOP. Peaking at number four, Applause was commercial success, later releasing a successful music video to accompany it. While not at the level of fame Gaga enjoyed during the period from *The Fame* to *Born This Way,* she was still a superstar on the pop music scene. However, the smooth transition into the *ARTPOP* era soon fell apart. *Venus*, which was enjoying praise from fans and decent commercial success as a promotional single, was planned to be the second single from *ARTPOP*. However, it was replaced with *Do What U Want*, to the dismay of many fans. While a music video was not only planned, but completed for Do What U Want, it was never released, probably because it was going to be an overtly sexual music video that featured *[R. Kelly](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/R._Kelly#Sex_tape_allegations_and_acquittal)*. And it didn’t end there: her third single peaked at 79 on the Hot 100, she put out some [interesting tweets](http://thatgrapejuice.net/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/lady-gaga-artpop-controversial-tweets-that-grape-juice.png), got [vomited on… intentionally](https://youtu.be/Vgw0idklwuI?t=53), released and pulled an ARTPOP app, [planned both a concert and her wedding in outer space](http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/entertainment/2013/11/lady-gaga-confirms-concert-in-space-plans/), which were both delayed then [canceled](http://www.inquisitr.com/1579196/update-virgin-galactic-halloween-crash-cancels-lady-gagas-wedding-in-outer-space/), and, when the “exploration of the reverse Warholian phenomenon in pop culture” was released, it was met with very mixed reviews, a first for Gaga.  It still retained commercial success, though, debuting at number 1 on the Billboard 200, and even ending up on some end of the year best albums list. This album definitely leaves behind a legacy: to some good, to some bad, but to all [unforgettable](https://roseberryproductions.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/lady-gaga-artpop.png). We are also going to be rated Do What U Want ft. Christina Aguilera. Why? Popular request, and I tried to get the albums as even with each other as possible.

#BEYONCÉ
 
December the 13th might just have been the unluckiest Friday 13th for the other girls in the game. That night Beyoncé decided to drop her fifth album out of nowhere, something almost unprecedented for pop stars her caliber, and it was instantly praised as her best body of work yet. The tracks, each with a distinctive music video, have a dark and moody beats and deal with subjects like self-empowerment, feminism, sexuality, death and depression.

Four years after its release, it still holds particularly well:, it won 3 Grammys, and it's considered by several publications one of the best albums of the decade and even one of the best in history. The visual component of the album - especially "Partition" and "Pretty Hurts" - also got her major recognition, with honors such as the MJ Video Vanguard award at the VMAs. 

Bey re-released the album a year later with some new track, such as"7/11" and a "Flawless" remix with Nicki Minaj, and tour footage.

Fun fact - BEYONCÉ's release not only made surprise drops popular but also changed the industry's release date from Saturdays to Fridays! Impactful legends only. ~/u/mokitsu
 
**NOTE** - *Beyoncé* is a visual album, and therefore the videos are much longer than the song and sometimes doesn’t even perform the whole song. I have linked the AUDIO ONLY in the below links, please base your scores on those audios, or the Spotify, Apple Music, etc. versions. You can definitely let the videos themselves factor into your score, however. The whole visual album is on Beyoncé’s VEVO and can be found [HERE](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LXXQLa-5n5w&list=PLVOuJntwPfcRnK0PbyfxgseSxelTOZOYA).

###PRISM
 
Prism is Katy Perry’s wildly successful third studio album (not counting Katy Hudson), released in October 2013. After Russell Brand divorced her through a text message, she started going on interviews, stating again and again that her next album would be “real fucking dark”. Following a very short break after Teenage Dream : Complete Confection, Katy released a video that shocked her fans immensely. This short 30 second clip (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m5Hel36qrFI) consists of her in an almost pitch black room, burning her iconic candy-colored wig, perhaps signaling the end of her bubblegum pop era. But instead of these dark influences that we expected from her music, she releases the happy go lucky empowerment anthem, “Roar”. This complete 180 turn shocked Katy Cats, and disappointed many, including myself. The album dropped to massive success, but all of the hype and theme that she built for it disappeared. Even the cover, with Katy in a bright, flowery meadow, was bright and happy. This theme continued with the songs; almost every one was either about self empowerment or having fun. Prism spawned five singles; the chart topping lead single “Roar”, the ballad “Unconditionally”, the comparatively underwhelming success “Birthday”, the surprise hit “Dark Horse”, and “This is How We Do”. “Dark Horse”, in particular, is noteworthy. A trap-themed banger featuring Juicy J with an epic verse, this is the only actually “dark” song on the album. Other album highlights are “Legendary Lovers”, a tribal sounding bop, and “Walking on Air”, which is super disco themed. It’s been said by many that the first half of the album is far stronger than the second. Two songs were accused of plagiarism off of this album; Dark Horse was compared to the Christian rap song “Joyful Noise” by Flame, and “Roar” was compared to “Brave” by Sara Bareilles. Overall, this era wasn’t actually that messy. It’s nothing compared to the Artpop era, and other than the misrepresentation of theme, nothing really happened. Prism is currently double platinum in the USA and as of August 2015, has sold 5 million copies worldwide; so, I guess she chose the right battles. ~/u/skyblade79

#RULES AND IMPORTANT INFO
 
**PLEASE READ ALL THE RULES. IF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED IN ANY RATE POST- “2016 ULTIMATE ALBUM RATE, ” THEN THEY ARE MOSTLY THE SAME. I AM USING A PROGRAM MADE BY /U/LETSALLPOO (thank btw!), AND IF THESE RULES AREN’T FOLLOWED PRECISELY, THE PROGRAM WILL MESS UP. EVEN IF YOU HAVE SEEN THESE RULES BEFORE, GO OVER THEM AGAIN PLEASE, BECAUSE IF YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG I WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU!**
 
**SERIOUSLY GUYS**
 
* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two demical spots: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache**. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).
 
* **Yes, you have to listen to every song**.  I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later).
 
* Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential.
 
* You may give **ONE** song a 0 and **ONE** song an 11. **This is ONE song total, NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM**. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**.
 
* You **can** change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.
 
* make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to **use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post, such as [right here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=therokinrolla&subject=2013%20Ultimate%20Album%20Rate&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20ARTPOP%0A%0AAura%3A%0A%0AVenus%3A%0A%0AG.U.Y.%3A%0A%0ASexxx%20Dreams%3A%0A%0AJewels%20N%20Drugs%3A%0A%0AMANiCURE%3A%0A%0ADo%20What%20U%20Want%3A%0A%0AARTPOP%3A%20%0A%0ASwine%3A%0A%0ADonatella%3A%0A%0AFashion!%3A%20%0A%0AMary%20Jane%20Holland%3A%0A%0ADope%3A%0A%0AGypsy%3A%0A%0AApplause%3A%0A%0ADo%20What%20U%20Want%20ft.%20Christina%20Aguilera%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20BEYONC%C3%89%0A%0APretty%20Hurts%3A%0A%0AHaunted%3A%0A%0ADrunk%20in%20Love%3A%0A%0ABlow%3A%20%0A%0ANo%20Angel%3A%0A%0APartition%3A%20%0A%0AJealous%3A%0A%0ARocket%3A%20%0A%0AMine%3A%20%0A%0AXO%3A%0A%0A***Flawless%3A%20%0A%0ASuperpower%3A%0A%0AHeaven%3A%0A%0ABlue%3A%20%0A%0A7%2F11%3A%20%0A%0ARing%20Off%3A%20%0A%0AStanding%20On%20The%20Sun%20Remix%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20PRISM%0A%0ARoar%3A%0A%0ALegendary%20Lovers%3A%0A%0ABirthday%3A%0A%0AWalking%20on%20Air%3A%0A%0AUnconditionally%3A%0A%0ADark%20Horse%3A%0A%0AThis%20Is%20How%20We%20Do%3A%0A%0AInternational%20Smile%3A%0A%0AGhost%3A%0A%0ALove%20Me%3A%0A%0AThis%20Moment%3A%0A%0ADouble%20Rainbow%3A%0A%0ABy%20The%20Grace%20of%20God%3A%0A%0ASpiritual%3A%0A%0AIt%20Takes%20Two%3A%0A%0AChoose%20Your%20Battles%3A%0A%0AEND). PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but **PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores**.
 
* If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
* If, after sumbitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song, I WILL change it up until i stop accepting scores.

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
 
> Swine: 1 What is this vomit!
 
**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
 
> Swine: 1: What is this vomit!
 
> Swine: What is this vomit! 1
 
> Swine: I'm giving this a 1 because it's vomit!
 
> Swine: 1-What is this vomit!
 
> Swine: 1 (What is this vomit!)

We’re done! If you’ve read all that, thank you so much, and I can’t wait for your scores! If you didn’t read all that, then I can’t wait to shame you! I'm very excited to see the results of this rate, and I'll go ahead and tell you now what you already know: **IT GON' GET MESSY.**
