# WELCOME TO THE [2013 ULTIMATE ALBUM RATE DAY 3!!](http://i.imgur.com/8WvjXhf.gifv)

Here are some quick notes and facts about this rate and what we will be doing today:

* Today we will be revealing 10 songs (#10-1) 
* We Will being at 3 PM EST both in this thread and in the [plug here!](https://plug.dj/popheads/)
* The average controversy score is 2.2859. So, anything higher than that should be considered controversial. 
* The overall average of ALL the scores is 7.0387. Solid. 

And perhaps my favorite fact of all…

* **THERE WERE 137 PARTICIPANTS**, aka, this is the most competed in rate in all of /r/popheads history! Thanks a ton guys! My agressive promotion tactics on the Discord and Plug paid off big time!
* It will get messy. Tears will be shed, blood will be shed, slurs will be thrown. And I cannot wait.

# ICONIC. ICONICICONICICONIC. 

Peaked higher than GUY. This song is such a riot oml. The lyrics are literally insane. LLike what the hell kinda lyric is "aphrodite lady seashell bikini"? WTF??? I love it. I love all the noises and sounds and the "Venus!" Chant. I love the alien takeoff music. I love the prechorus. I love the nonsensical bridge. I love  "URANUS!" I love every single thing about this wild ride. It makes me some sort of wild and happy.

---
# This could be love

**Elitefourbrad**: "A self-produced track by an artist! Bey and Katy are shook! This was originally going to be the 2nd single, but crazy Little Monsters said otherwise. I really love the bridge because it reminds me of Sailor Moon so much with comparing all the planets. The most iconic line of this song though is “Don’t you know my ass is famous?”."

**fifthchevron**: "Dat 90s pre-chorus doe"

**gannade**: "the song is messy but im giving a 10 because she performs the shit out of this live"

**Chewy1418**: "I love it, but it is repetitive."

**Macubass**: "invented space lesbians"

**TheShineSoul**: "I understand why this is a fan favourite. I like everything except the actual chorus but it's good too."

**enecks**: "After the confusion of Aura, I finally settled into this album while listening to Venus. Here was a song that I loved from listen 1. Asides from being about one of my fetishes (cosmic sex) it also had a killer danceable groove and some glorious cheese (DON'T YOU KNOW MY ASS IS FAMOUS?). Things were looking up for the album"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is quite the weird song. I like the verses, and the constant “Venus!”, but man does that chorus sound messy. It sounds stitched, like a Yellow Claw song or Frankenstein’s monster. The chorus itself is fine, but it doesn’t reflect the direction the verses were leading to, and not in a good way. However, the pre-chorus where she names all the planets fucking rocks."

**misstututulle**: "Queen of Space! Lana could never! Venus is the should've been single that could've smashed. With a not-quite-complete video, it feels somewhat unfinished in nearly every area. Still a bop."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This song sets up a weird sort of space/Greek theme that I assumed would follow us through the album but is really only on this one and “G.U.Y.” but this is probably one of the beter tracks. It’s campy and weird and very out there, but there’s an undeniable charm about it."

**wearingsox**: "CERTIFIED MEGA SUPER BOP. The build up before the first chorus is spectacular, you have no idea how the chorus will possibly going to top what you’ve heard so far, and then it’s the ultimate release, keep on bopping."

**huntyphobic**: "if you don’t give this song an 11 solely for the lyrics of “Uranus! Don’t you know my ass if famous?” then idk what you’re doing in this sub tbh."

**stardustanddinos**: "The lyrics are sorta weird (garden panty? really?), but the beat and the space-y vibe are amazing. I love this song."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "This is the start of a 3 song streak on the album that is just pure sex perfection. The first one is just a wild ride from start to finish with a truly iconic bridge. DON'T YOU KNOW MY ASS IS FAMOUS???!?!?!"

# When they listened they died just a little inside

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "Too weird for the sake of weird for me to really like it even ironically"

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "There’s like 3 separate insanely catchy melodies in here but the lyrics are Katy-Perry level cringe"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "What in the entire fuck is this?"

**candyninja32**: "The lyrics are WTF makes no fucking sense, I mean it's out of control here, even the productions trash, too many wub wubs, there is no redeeming this trash"

**throwaway963963963**: "I give this song a 5, for every inch Volantis flew off of the ground."

**kappyko**: "she wrote 3 different hooks for this, how innovative! sadly two of them are trash, leaving the brilliant, actual hook. that bridge is lowkey weak"

Hence, I probably shouldn't complain about rankings, but I'll just say this: Do What U Want (the R. Kelly version, of course) should have EASILY taken number one here. I'd go as far as to say it's a top-three Gaga song. 

Out of the remaining tunes, I'd love to see Partition, GUY, or Venus win. I'd also be cool with Drunk In Love. Just PLEASE PLEASE no Flawless (that production is horrendous) or god forbid Dark Horse

Well I love a good feminist anthem. And this is a good feminist anthem. Sonically, it ranges from meh to p good. It just doesn't do that much for me. By no means a bad song, but by no means a great one either.

---
# Flawless

**specfagular**: "GREAT feminist anthem. U ARE WORTH IT GIRL. Give us that lecture in the middle! I WOKE UP LIKE DIS"

**_ItsJake**: "iconic"

**enecks**: "This is the feminist message this album has at its best. I love the Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speech in this so much; its such a stunningly effective representation of the core beliefs of feminism. Blessed be Beyoncé."

**mokitsu**: "EVERYTHING about this track is so well put and perfect. from the opening/closing bits from Star Search, the crazy beat in the first part, Beyoncé being tired of everyone's bullshit...to the iconic interlude, with GODLY background vocals. and then the second part, which is inspirational yet in an aggressive way? i LIVE for it. beyoncé when she's angry, she does wonders (see: Don't Hurt Yourself, I Care, Ring The Alarm...) and this is no exception. a legendary song."

**henry413**: "While it's funny that Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie had said her kind of feminism differs from Beyoncé's, the song is way better than the campaign-like "WHO RUN THE WORLD? GIRLS!"."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "In my freshman year of high school, my English class had a two class discussion about Flawless and the juxtaposition of the Adichie’s excerpt in the middle of the song. It’s a perfect bridge between the two parts of the song, and really enforces the enthusiasm of the empowering second half. The song itself is extremely iconic, and for good reason. The buildup is palpable, and leads to this statement of confidence that feels like the climax of the entire album. And then, to close it off with the outro it ends with, is audio of Beyoncé losing. It’s a humbling and deflating way to end the song, and it speaks to the reality of living in the real world - you can be as flawless as possible and still fail."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Ah, the song that started to make Beyoncé's solo career go down on a political route. I don't doubt Beyonce's feminism at all, but I still often wonder to myself if it's a little sad that a rich female musician gets more attention as a spokesperson for black women than working-class black women who don't have as much representation. That said? The message of this song is still awesome."

**lady_sable**: "Bey really did THAT. Feminist anthem of the century."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "FUCK. I KNOW I AM SUPPOSED TO HELP KATY BUT THIS SONG IS JUST HARD NOT TO GIVE A 10 TO. Anyway, I will never forget the time I got to meet Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie in a book festival that I volunteered in. I had [pic](http://i.imgur.com/hCByyr7.jpg)[tures](http://i.imgur.com/FrC8eSC.jpg) with her and had her [sign a copy of her printed book version of her iconic "We Should All Be Feminists"](http://i.imgur.com/x5oHAaJ.jpg) speech which was sampled in the song."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "/u/therokinrolla bitch where's the remix? :angery: /s" (I blame /u/mokitsu for not letting me know it exists. Hell, SOTS wasnt in this rate until mokitsu was like "erm you're forgetting a song" and i was like "oh wow that song exists who knew?")

**stardustanddinos**: "I don't know, Adichie's spoken word sorta interrupts the flow of the song for me. The absolutely ICONIC intro and the delivery of the "bow, down bitches", "wake up, flawless" lines are amazing. The most quotable song of the album, obv."

**kappyko**: "I'M UP THAT H-TOOOOOOOOOOOWN COMING COMING DOWN is the most hype thing ever"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this song is all i need to feel good about my body. f e m i n i s m b o p"

# Flawed

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "I just find it so shallow to be all like “I woke up like this and I’m so beautiful” when the truth is that you never just “woke up like this”, it’s just not realistic, a recurrent thing with this album. Words can’t explain how much I hate this song. Also fuck this trend in music of making a song where the samples are the only good thing. I had like a 4 paragraph explanation of why this gets my 0 but tbh it doesn’t matter. Thanks to Rashad Muhammad, Rey Reel, Hit-boy and The-Dream."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "It’s gotta be a little embarrassing when you’re Beyoncé and you’re upstaged on your own track by an author, but the spoken word is by far the best part of this track. It inspired a pseudo-meme (“I woke up like this”) so I think that makes people remember it more fondly, but it’s structured really weird. It just kind of starts, goes for a bit, then ends, it doesn’t build it doesn’t really make any shifts, it just doesn’t go anywhere and despite selling itself as an inspirational anthem it’s not really that inspirational? Beyoncé doesn’t get to own her own track because she’s buried under layers of reverb and unnecessary sound effects. The spoken word interlude is great but again, a series of weird production choices do everything they can to distract from it. I’m aware that I’m not exactly the target audience for this song and it does seem to resonate with the people it was intended for, so kudos for that, but just judging it as a song it doesn’t do it for me."

**ignitethephoenix**: "I feel like this song was only good for producing memes and for the inspirational feminism part. It's not that great otherwise."

**cyborglilith**: "what is this trash"

**Magic_warlock0-**: "A tall claim, because this song has many issues. I love them idea of strong and powerful ladies, but the song just doesn't DO anything with that! I wish so much it were a bop, but it's just not a good song."

**SpanKKy1**: "Ironic title"

This is what she actually means, /u/BlasiFeelsSwift:

> not “i woke up with this hair laid and makeup did and decked out clothes”. which is how everyone else apparently interpreted it.

# WE COULD BE

That is my favorite part of the song for somereason, that really light "we could be" in the chorus. idk why. Oh yea its also and insane bop, perfect from beginning to end. The lyrics are p good for katy. I love this, and honestly it should've been a single.

---
# Legendary

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oof, a total bop. The instrumental here is extremely fitting, and this is one of the more original songs on this album. I honestly adore how much is going on and how it all works together quite well. The chorus is a bit awkwardly delivered, but that’s not much of a problem."

**lady_sable**: "This song is a huge bop omg; easily my favorite by Katy."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This is a low-key problematic bop due to cultural appropriation and all. It's too damn catchy tho so 8.5 is the highest score I can give. [I'll leave this here.](http://i.imgur.com/Mpx7xXR.png)"

**zamomattel**: "Sounds like a really boppy Eurovision song"

**10footnotes**: "The rest of the song is good, but the bridge is great. I'm also reminded of that iconic Project Runway quote about blood orange just being a pretentious way to say red."

**thefighter987**: "Solid enough album filler, but it doesn’t really hit me until the chorus."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "some people call it racist, but seriously she just sings a lot about asian cultures, and some shakesspeare, idk how thats bad. the song is also a nice bop so yeah leave britney alone"

# Couldn't Be

**MrSwearword**: "she really did try but it sounds like shesactinlikesourmilkallontheflooranditsmyfaultididntshuttherefrigeratormaybethatsthereasonshesactinsocooooooold."

**_ItsJake**: "lana vibes, but not as good"

**enecks**: "A pleasant song, but it needs a bit more kick and vocal talent to earn the "Legendary" label."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Mess of Indian stereotypes, TBH. I'm all for cultural appreciation, but the lyrics are just...really white. That being said, this is catchy."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is a messy track. The lyrics seem like a checklist of every Indian stereotype (third eye, lotus, karma, mantra, etc.) mashed together with references to famous lovers, yet none of the lyrics really seem to be related to each other. But it’s a lot of fun to listen to, I can’t resist its charm so I gave it a seven. Also could, everyone please stop referring to Indian inspired stuff as “tribal?” It’s annoying, thanks."

# Something something, single

**Elitefourbrad**: "Why the hell wasn’t this a single Katy? The Egyptian vibes here are strong, Katy made a big misstep by not making this a single."

**henry413**: "Queen of cultural appropriation? But seriously this deserve to be a single."

**VeganSquash**: "why wasn't this a single?!"

**misstututulle**: "The near-unanimously agreed should-have-been single of PRISM. Katy provides a culturally inspired banger that's unique and upbeat while tying in a bunch of somewhat corny lines that somehow manage to actually work."

**skiddos**: "should've been a single!!"

**Leixander**: "Should've been a single instead of TIHWD."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE, this should have been a single, t h i s  s h o u l d  h a v e  b e e n  a  s i n g l e. T H I S  S H O U L D  H A V E  B E E N  A  S I N G L E, everything about this is pure perfection."

**JohnnyToby**: "a Blessing. Why was this not a single kathEryne??!?!?!?!?!"

**XwildcatXJH**: "robbed of being a single"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "📢 THIS 👏 SHOULD 👏 HAVE 👏 BEEN 👏 A 👏 SINGLE 👏 KATY"

**SkyBlade79**: "Absolute bop. Would be my 11 if GUY didn’t exist. The production is just so great and unique, the lyrics are cool, especially the imagery she evokes with the blood-orange sun line. This should’ve been a single; it has all of the material, and I think that it could’ve successfully used Dark Horse to slingshot it very high on the charts. Such a shame."

**jamesfog**: "Shoulda been a single! All leg, no dairy"

**the_monkey_**: "so I'd actually never heard this song (the shame) but its unreal. Should have been a single."

# He's being weird again

**SpanKKy1**: "Shawn and Charlie"

serfbort.

So, when I first rated this song, I knew there was a controversial lyric in it, but i had no idea what it was or what it mean. Now, just a second ago, i looked into it and tbh that is literally awful and i wouldve given it a lower score for it. Its disgusting to make a lyric like that glorifying abuse. Awful..

Otherwise, issa bop. I like it, even if its a little long. The beat is great, the lines are iconic, and it got 34 10s. *sheesh*

---
# Let's go ahead and get it out of the way...

**fifthchevron**: "SERFBORT"

**specfagular**: "great chorus, great beat, loves it. SURFBORT"

**Joebiekong**: "SURFBOARD🏄"

**Leixander**: "Serfbort is iconic but... I found the rest of the song bland."

**dropthehammer11**: "surfbort""

**JohnnyToby**: "surfbort"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "inb4 Every comment is just Surfboart."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "i really have nothing to say other than.. w a t e r m e l o n s u r f b o a r d t"

**jamesfog**: "Bop. SURFBOARD"

**Wailordfan**: "Surfboardt is iconic, and is actually what made my mom love Beyonce? Odd."

**PandoraKris**: "SURFBORT"

# Grainin' on that

**Elitefourbrad**: "For me, this is the best song on s/t. Bey’s soaring, ecstatic and intimate vocals shine here. I just really love this ballad-type song from Bey, and it’s her last highest charting song at #2. Jay-Z is just kind of there, but he doesn’t hurt the song so I don’t have a problem with him."

**_ItsJake**: "fun, iconic"

**enecks**: "This song is a work that creates such a thick and distinctive atmosphere. It's a love song, yet one with a sound and lyrics that give it a strange otherworldly je ne sais quoi. Like that other great love song of 2013, Bound 2, this song has some super blunt and graphic lyrics, yet still sounds romantic. Blessed be Beyoncé."

**mokitsu**: "from the baby vocals in the beginning, to her hoarse vocals....this song is pop PERFECTION. i've slut dropped to this so many times in the shower it's crazy. what an ANTHEM. admittedly it isn't as ...thoughtful as the previous tracks but a bop is a bop and a banger is Drunk in Love."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "We all know this one. Drunk in Love is so unabashedly Bey, and benefits from some of the hardest production she’s ever sung/rapped on. And she sings and raps her heart on it, over some crisp rockin drums, and Jay-Z comes in later after one of the most iconic surfboards references in music. The whole song seriously just slaps."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is without a doubt one of the best pop songs of this decade. That said, as brilliant as the production and Beyonce's sensual vocals are here, I don't feel comfortable giving this a 10 because of Jay-Z's fucking cake line. I get that 'eat the cake, Anna Mae' is popular slang and all, and I'm sure neither Beyonce or Jay-Z meant any sort of harm when they included it in the rap bridge, but as a person who's suffered from abuse that line is still pretty hurtful. That being said, this song is still a masterpiece."

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "This song makes me wanna have hardcore sex with /u/Mudkip1 in literally every room in my house, just nutting everywhere with /u/Mudkip1 from the kitchen to the garage to the rec room where I rec him" i feel like i need to censor this. i ship it

**lady_sable**: "Iconic"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "[NSFW](https://images.rapgenius.com/444a4b20f97d38578a804e2b7d0e5f6a.320x320x1.jpg)"

**throwaway963963963**: "I hate it when I am pre-judged for being a Lana stan, we're not all the same. On an unrelated note, when Bey says "daddy" I just lose my fucking shit it's like my favorite thing on the whole damn album yas"

**musicotic**: "Love this song because it's so sexy and catchy."

**stardustanddinos**: "Jay-Z's killer verse merges well with Beyonce's, and the video accentuates the raunchiness of the track."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "fuck i love this song. despite never having been seriously drunk or never having been seriously in love. i think that jay's verse starts off fairly awkward, though."

# SERF-Bored

**MrSwearword**: "weak collaboration but the beat is pretty good despite being a dated 2004 pop sound."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "I have a lot of problems with this song tbh, let’s just skip the whole Tina Turner thingie bc even though it’s yikes I do not think it glorifies domestic violence. Onto the thing that made me give it a 7. This is just a rehash of Crazy in Love, don’t get me wrong, it’s a good track but Crazy in Love did it better. Also surfboard?¿?¿?¿?¿? I’m all for you telling us how you get kinky and call him daddy tho like go girl get that dick but please don’t destroy warhol’s paintings. Also blackout sex is never good, don’t lie to us. As usual thank you J-Roc, Timbaland, Brian Solo, Dre Moon, Detail, Rasool Diaz and Jay Z for writing this. Also quick question, does eating watermelon work for vaginas?"runk karaoke"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "The only reason I’m not giving this song a one is because I’m impressed by Beyoncé’s vocal gymnastics. But other than that, this is a pretty unpleasant song to listen to. It’s basically Bey-Z flexing about how good their relationship is. It’s a gluttonous song, it doesn’t need to be this long, it doesn’t need this many riffs, it doesn’t need this much production, and I’m gonna be real the lyrics are uncharacteristically bizarre for a Beyoncé song. Jay is awful on it, if they weren’t married no way Beyoncé would have let him on this. Why is he yelling about anime and comparing himself to domestic abusers? It doesn’t go anywhere. I don’t understand why this was popular."

**SkyBlade79**: "you know, I liked this song a lot more before I knew what that Anna Mae line meant. I still think it’s a real bop, but that made it lose quite a few points."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "This song is grainin' on my nerves, grain-grainin on my nerves. I love Jay-z's sad rapping the best out of this song, Beyonce is just so boring here. I don't like the way she enunciates in this at all!"

**superr_rad**: "ok listen. this song is iconic, sure. but i cant get over Jay and the "Eat the cake anna mae" reference, its fucked up, there's no way around it. and Bey enables it and even sings along...i cant. this is one huge critique i have of the "feminist message" this album is supposed to have. glorifying and joking about a woman being abused by her husband is anything but feminist."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "one of the most overhyped songs, seriously, it's crazy in love but bad"

Look_A_Fangirl: To be honest, I don't really think I can compare it to the other songs she's done before. This one is really different. Although it does kinda have minimal production throughout the whole song so for that I think it's probably closer to Lowlife, but it kinda follows the internet themes so it's closer to Computer Boy for that. But other that it's not really like her other work, it's really just a minimalistic disco track with smooth lyrics and some grower La La La's in the track.

# This story should never end

**Elitefourbrad**: "My personal favorite off of *ARTPOP*, should’ve been the album closer, but Applause got that honor. It gives me 80’s vibes to the extreme and the production is great on this song along with the piano in the first verse. The way Gaga says “Tonight” in the chorus is absolutely infectious! Along with the outro where she starts saying all the different places she’s toured in, because she has a Gypsy life."

**TheShineSoul**: "This song just gets better every second and it seems to have a lot of replay value."

**enecks**: "Artpop is a really nostalgic album for me, but especially this song. This song resonated with me a LOT leaving school. Here was a song about company, travel, and change in a way that resonated. The production on this track was catchy and optimistic in a way that reminded me of all the best pop songs of the time. I DON'T WANT TO BE ALONE FOREVER!"

**VeganSquash**: "I REALLY wish this was acoustic like her live performances of Gypsy. Also, the lyrics to Gypsy are amazing. For fun, I wrote down the lyrics to the opening verse and gave it to my sister who hates Gaga/pop music with a passion. She read it and was like "holy shit this is amazing, did you write this?""

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "easily one of the greatest gaga songs, though i may be a little biased because it was the first song i learned on piano and it helped me through some rough shit so i have a strong connection to it lols"

**lady_sable**: "If this doesn't go top ten I'm blocking all of you." youre good, hunty.

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this makes me wanna leave everything and travel the world, that stuttering h00k is catchy af. Gaga should have stopped making music, that way we wouldn’t have suffered through Joanne."

**TragicKingdom1**: "A perfect blend of actually well-structured pop and the avant-garde stylings of Artpop."

**XwildcatXJH**: "In an album of midtempo and midupper tempo this song was so fucking refreshing. Oh my god. This stole venus' 11 btw. So outstanding. Upbeat, catchy, lyrically good, and can be played anywhere and still sound so good."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "A deep and wonderfully sung song. I can really feel some emotion off this track, it really gives a solid story and captures the essence of striking off on your own alone. Too bad the last 30 seconds ruin what could be an awesome song, I hate that little run-on speaking/singing on the end."

**the_monkey_**: "Honestly this song completely rescues this album. Its the real highlight, and pushes it from a bad to underwhelming album. The fact she didn't release it as the lead is a shame, the era would have gone totally different imo."

# This story needs to end

**MrSwearword**: "this is bland and boring as hell."

**SkyBlade79**: "why’d she literally make eurotrash music"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i love how she lists the countries where ARTPOP flopped in the bridge"

**misstututulle**: "It's good, but not outwardly great. I love parts of the song, but find myself nearly unable to listen to the bridge. It would've been a great album closer, but for some reason, Applause is placed at the end."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This isn't bad in the slightest, but this sounds like a 2011 reject."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Not the best, but not the worst."


# A lovely review

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m gonna be real with you, I was all set to give my 11 to “Birthday” by Katy Perry, but this song wrenched it away. What a fantastic song. She really bares her soul here, speaking about the loneliness of fame and the struggles of being an artist, but not in the saturnine way you would expect. Instead she praises the romantic aspects of “gypsy” life, living free and unattached, traveling the world and spreading her art. It’s a paean to artists, foregoing security, stability, and familiarity in exchange for a shot at the world. She doesn’t want to live this life forever, but she’s not scared by it now, and by the end of the song she’s managed to embrace love without compromising who she is, finding a love that wants to fly with her rather than tie her down: her fans. If Gaga spends the rest of the album deconstructing fame, this is a song reminding us why Gaga does what she does. It’s the peak of the “intentional immaturity” of the album and the song that sells it the best, evoking the carefree nature of youth rather than the messiness of it. The song really gallops, the slow start with the build to the breakneck finale that practically soars and is perfectly evocative of the globetrotting lifestyle that Gaga is singing about. It’s telling that Gaga often runs out of breath while performing this live, the repetitive “I’m a gypsy” refrain is supposed to sound impatient and energetic. The final verse is packed with references that spell out a goodbye to the Born This Way era, but the way the melody sort of drifts off implies that there’s so much more to come. Honestly, this song should have closed the album, it’s the perfect statement of what ARTPOP was supposed to be: an artist unabashedly there for her art and for her audience. Watch any performance of Gaga doing this song live and it’s abundantly clear that this is one of her strongest songs to date, and one that resonated with me deeply. (And yes, I know that gypsy is technically a racial slur against Romani people, but the word also is also deeply ingrained into the culture of the American theatre and you’d be pretty hard pressed to get offended by this track.)"

Yathhhh get that wholesome bop Bey. Its nothing revolutionary but its a reallly nice and wholesome song that tbh spent more time out of the top 10 rather than in it. I'm surprised it ended up so high considering where it spent the majority of its time, but hey, it deserves it. 

---
# Happy Ever After

**Syfawx**: "Of course her 'pop-py' song is high in my books."

**specfagular**: "FINALLY giving me something that w

**mokitsu**: "this is such a feel good track that makes me burst with happiness every time i listen to it. really the only comparison i have is Run Away With Me, i wouldn't be surprised if Carly had this as an inspiration tbh. always puts a smile on my face."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh man. This was the first song I decided to listen off of the album when it first dropped. It was just a chance, just something I liked the title of. I was honestly blown away, and as someone who only liked her stuff casually, I knew I had to join the hype for the surprise release, and I ended up having this be one of my faves of the year. XO is the least conventional track on self-titled, an emotional ballad that feels almost like anthemic stadium rock. Everything about this song is tremendous in the best way, and the main vocals, background vocals, instrumental - it’s all firing on all cylinders. The song begins and ends perfectly, and it’s become one of my favorite songs from Beyoncé."

**misstututulle**: "Some r/popheads users have a serious hate-on for this song, but I am not one. I think it's a very nice little euphoric love song and completes its purpose."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Essentially, an even better version of Halo. Perhaps Beyoncé should have been more sensitive in regards to the audio sample, but at least she meant it well."

**lassidoggy**: "Queen of using soundbytes from a tragedy to start your lead single"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I feel like this song is going to be shat on a lot which would be a damn shame if this song gets out on Day 1 so I am giving this song a 10 in hopes this song does better in the rate just like I am doing with Prism. 👁 Anyway, I feel the controversy over the sample at the start of the song was blown way over the proportion. Bey said that "‘XO’ was recorded with the sincerest intention to help heal those who have lost loved ones and to remind us that unexpected things happen, so love and appreciate every minute that you have with those who mean the most to you. The songwriters included the audio in tribute to the unselfish work of the Challenger crew with hope that they will never be forgotten." Bey didn't use this sample so randomly and loosely and I truly believe her because the sample and and the song itself very much co-relate to each other in perfect ways, which is about loving people around you while you can because you may never know when they're going to be gone."

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "This is cosmic. It’s got this gorgeous fluorescence and simpleness."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Another long opinion. It glows. It shows how much an instrumental can tell, and how music can talk about something without the need of lyrics. Even if you didn’t understand english, you can still understand that it’s about love. It transcends languages, and if that doesn’t show the power of music, I don’t know what will."

**throwaway963963963**: "On Jan 4th, 2013, redditor /u/Aalewis posted a now infamous comment on /r/atheism, that I would like to paraphrase: "In this moment, I am euphoric. Not because of any phony flop’s blessing. But because, I am enlightened by XO.""

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This is such a beautiful song about a really deep love and enjoying your time with your loved ones before your time on earth is up. Also still don't think the Challenger snippet deserved so much outrage, but I wasn't around for the disaster so I probably won't ever fully understand it."

**stardustanddinos**: "The most radio-friendly, but also a soaring ode to being hopelessly in love, this song takes the cake for me for a lot of reasons - the upbeat instrumental, happy music video and a few personal reasons too. I remember falling in love for the first time, and this song encapsulates the warmth and intimacy of the time I spent with him. I will cherish this song as much as I cherish the lovely times we spent together."

# A Disaster

**MrSwearword**: "Bey’s worst song. No one of her caliber should sing this song while sick. Practice songwriting, use a take of a song that isn’t anemic sounding or maybe think to yourself “This would suck as a lead single.” TRASH"

**ImOnABeach**: "A little too sentimental for my taste"

**dropthehammer11**: "Why is 95% of this album a snoozefest"

**jelboo**: "I have no idea what she was thinking with that intro. Why is human tragedy important to her love song? It's an unfortunate blemish on an otherwise very emotive and touching song"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this is probably the whitest thing I've ever said but kelsea ballerini lowkey did it better don't /u/ me"

**PandoraKris**: "I Am Not Sasha Fierce Part 2-4: A Better Slow Song But Fuck The Track Position, And The Astronauts Didn't Die For This"

# Wholesome Comment

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "long text incoming. this song is one of the best/greatest/most beautiful love songs of this decade imo. everything just feels right. the instrumental is beautiful. its like a tipsy summer night where all you want to do is to be with the one you love. the music video supports this sooo much. whenever i hear this song i just cant wait to find someone to love and for summer to start. the song is nice and light and fun but also carries a great meaning. i dont know why it wasnt #1 or more famous, because it definitely deserved it. this song gave me hope to listen through the album, and although it was a bit demolished, i still was happy to hear this beautiful piece of delicate art in the middle. Beyoncé delivers EV-ERY-THING in it. and dont get me started on the mv, watching it for the first time as a person indifferent to Bey made me wanted to hop on a rollercoaster with her and hang out, while eating cotton candy. this is the definiton of light pop and this should be in its own category. i have a feeling that it will flop out before the top 10 or the top 20 even, but even if it does, i feel happy about giving it my 11, because this song deserves everything. prism is definitely my favorite from the rated albums but this song is THE ONE that makes my intimate organs pop out. its definitely in my top 5 favorite love songs and top 20 favorite songs, beating out even some Sia and Lorde songs." dw the song did much better than you thought ;)

# KATY IS DEAD

# KATY PERRY IS F A T NOW

# KATY PERRYS NEW ALBUM F L O P P E D

Sorry Katy kays. However, I want to tell a story. For literally the longest time Katy had no songs in the top 10. The last week and a half Katy slowly started to rise with Dark Horse, Birthday, and Legendary Lovers. Birthday was the first song to crack the top 15, with Dark Horse racing after it. And btw, Dark Horse was realy a Dark Horse. Before it starts rising it was in the high 20s before it started its hard and bloody crawl to the top. It was relentless. The late katy kats really came through and pulled this song to the top to shine in the top 5. I was pretty amazed tbh by how quickly DH crawled to #4. 

Now for my opinions: Dark Horse is so trash oml I hate it. It just sounds so wrong in every way, and not just bc its Katy with a trap beat. The chorus should be a prechorus, there is no umph, the verses are mostly katy talking its so tragic. however, I must applaud it for making it so far :clap:

---
# Perfect

**Macubass**: "ONE OF THE BEST POP SONGS TO EXIST!!! invented music, and replaced britney and madonna as queen of pop! every bit of this song is ICONIC, especially "shes a beast" part <3"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "can you please please please make [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YDANB3Z1Nlo) the shitpost" no i was scared putting ONE cupcakke song on here if i put two id cry out of fear

**dirdbub**: "at my high school, we do retreats every year and I remember during the freshman one we were driving back from out service place to a place to have fun with other groups and this came on and the person driving me (my group leader) turned the bass on all the way and turned the volume up to like 40 and when the bass dropped we all lost it in the middle of buttfuck nowhere in the west part of town it was lit"

**lady_sable**: "This is a really cool song imo. It's like...trap-pop. I love Katy's darker songs, because they always stand out so much from the rest of her discography and show how much potential she has."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Here we go. This song shouldn’t work, Katy is very white and kind of hard to take seriously, so throwing her over a trap track and having her sing about being an all destroying Jezebel, and then throw in a rap verse from Juicy J… it seems like a recipe for disaster. And yet this song was a smash hit and I and everyone I know absolutely get our lives to it. The lyrics are nonsensical and the rap verse is terrible, but damned if we don’t know every word and will sing them all for you at a moment’s notice. This is peak Katy Perry, ear candy that’s rotting your brain but you don’t care because it’s a bop."

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "I just want to highlight the awesome [single artwork](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/e/e8/DarkHorseCover.png) because it is such a cool aesthetic and it would have been so cool to have a dark gypsy Katy Perry video. But she went with her usual y colourful schtick. Anyway the song is pretty catchy but  is dragged down by her (lack of) songwriting abilities."

**VodkaInsipido**: "From the trap drums, to the slow verses, to the amazing build up in the chorus, to the actually really good Juicy J verse, to the change in the last chorus you have an almost flawless pop song. Play this at my funeral."

**throwaway963963963**: "I Love Listening Until My Incredibly Noisy Audio Turns Inoperative. (read the first letter of each word)."

**superr_rad**: "this is the only katy perry song i genuinely love, but it doesnt really fit her. I just wish it was given to Tinashe tbh. Also wtf is “put her in a coma??” either way, the beat of this is sick as hell and probably brought trap a lot of recognition, so good for katy for choosing this for the album, even though it was the black horse single of her discography."

# Storm

**Elitefourbrad**: "I hate the trappe beat on this song and the overexposure was real! Katy can barely even sing this live and Juicy J adds nothing to the song at all, the music video made her ego even worse."

**poppinmmolly**: "Good until that rap break. It's so awful it's funny."

**VeganSquash**: "I hate this song. The beat is stupid, the lyrics suck, everything is a mess, its terrible. The chorus SOUNDS like it is leading up to something MASSIVE but NOPE, a dumb ass pop drop."

**enecks**: "ET is a guilty pleasure of mine. This song replaces  the gloriously cheesy Kanye West verse with Juicy J, replaces ET's thud with baby's first trap song, and becomes another bleached asshole song."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "Decent song. I love the theme and beat, but brought down by Juicy J's uninspired rapping and the lackluster way Katy sings some of the bridges."

**xanthalasajache**: "Kick-started the bad EDMs"

Therokinrolla: # PRISM

---

**Overall average**: 6.596 **// Total points:** 897.0 

---

**Syfawx**: You know it's fitting that the third person who is honoured to be placed among queens is someone who I've been listening to a lot more lately. I love Swish Swish so much. That being said I've hardly listened to Prism so my votes are probably going to be lower because I have fucking studied the other two albums.

**specfagular**: When the songs are good, they're very good, but most of the songs on here are mediocre

**_ItsJake**: Very basic, all sounds the same, pop

**skiddos**: honestly, i think this is her best album. the music is so consistently bright and effervescent. listening to this album feels like taking a breath of fresh air. sure, teenage dream as a collection of songs is better, but this album is her most consistent.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I literally don't know why everybody hates PRISM. The era was pretty problematic, sure, but the album itself is full of bops. It also features some of Katy's best lyrics. Even the filler isn't very boring.

**dirdbub**: it's honestly impressive how the entire album consists of filler

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: this wasn’t dark enough, you underdelivered yet again, now that that’s out of the way I just wanna say that after all the drama surrounding katy and taylor that happened I wanna take this moment to let you all know that although I’m gonna drag and keep dragging Katy I wish her no harm and that Legendary Lovers is a bop. Thank you very much.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: I was very harsh on this album when it came out because I was salty I didn't get the dark Katy era that she teased in Wide Awake and in the promo videos of Roar. I am glad I got the chance in relistening to the album for the rate because I think this is Katy's best album to date. Her songwriting was a lot mature and the production feels more cleaner compared to Teenage Dream and One of the Boys.

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: I can’t lie, I was excited when Katy Perry went on her ‘KP4 is gonna be so fucking dark’ rant and then burned her wig. Unfortunately my own wig is firmly placed on my head after hearing PRISM. The first half of the album has a few fairly decent songs, but the second half draaaaags. My problem with Katy Perry is that she doesn’t have a great voice and she is possibly the worst lyricist around, so she has to rely on personality to sell her songs. However the cute charm that made Teenage Dream such an enjoyable album is painfully lacking here, and her lyrics are thrown into the spotlight.

**IngusNarnio**: all the songs are potential BOP but some are too similar and I got bored listening to the album. I gave very good scores but as an album, it would have been my least favorite of the three.

**AvatarKanol**: Really liked the whole album, the second half was good.

**Look_A_Fangirl**: Never a fucking gain.

**tron94**: As an official Katy Perry Sceptic, I've never given this one a chance. There's some real gems in here, but it's mostly all the singles (and Walking on Air).

**the_monkey_**: 8.5 Honestly this album is unfairly maligned. Its a strong album, and she pulls it off well. Good job Queen Katy.

**Wailordfan**: Basically, this album is her most cohesive to date. Its lows are higher then Teenage Dream, and features some of her best vocals ever. I wasn't expecting to love this album as much as I did, and this is coming from a hardcore Taylor stan.

**superr_rad**: I will admit I haven’t listened to this album as much as I have the other two, but I don’t think I would have scored it much better with another listen. Its just uninteresting to me.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: Going into PRISM i thought id dislike it based on popheads, but after listening to it, i really like it and im glad that this rate had happened. it has some underappreciated songs, and a lot of them speak to me. i might come off biased, because i am, but this album is amazing. i know it will be the lowest scoring one because of the katy bias, but it won the rate for me. i listened to this amazing album with great songs, many of them with great messages, and i loved it. every part of it. totally worth it.

**PandoraKris**: #JusticeForTeenageDream

**stardustanddinos**: After her divorce, and pop-perfection in the Teenage Dream Era, Prism wasn't the dark album she teased. The latter half of the album showcases the aspect to an extent, but the first half is full of the cotton candy Katy-goodness that we all love. All the albums in this rate show inconsistency in production, tone and lyrics, and same goes here - the stark difference between the two halves of Prism is all too apparent. But it SERVES, when it does! Five No.1 singles, and a wildly successful tour later, Katy is truly one of the biggest pop icons this decade.

**a_rain_of_tears**: if this album goes out first blame me, queen of positivity for 2.5 album

Oop! The final lead single is out! Ahhh Applause. Tbh one of my favorite things about this song was when it would could on the radio in GTA V. This song has CARNAGE! It is so goddamn quick and loud. Like holy sheesh how was this the lead single Gaga oml. Better than Aura, I guess, which Gaga wanted ton be the lead originally. Honestly, I was shocked it made it this far, but apparently nobody really hates this song except Bad Taste Squad up in the lowest scores section. But no, Applause peaked higher in this rate than on the Billboard charts :eyes:.

---
# 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

**Elitefourbrad**: "A risky lead single that set the tone for this era, whether you interpret it as good or not. It’s way better than its archnemesis Roar and actually is experimental. This was written after Gaga injured her hip while performing at the *Born This Way Ball*, and Gaga lives for her fans. I love it a lot!"

**MrSwearword**: "2ND GREATEST SONG IN GAGA’S CAREER. YATH, SLAY"

**gannade**: "every gay should have this on their workout playlist, it goes OFF"

**enecks**: "The album ended with a bop that had me strutting in my room like the peacock I was. And so, Artpop finished. One of my friends texted me once it was over "What did you think?". I replied "It's Gaga's best album". I'm not sure I entirely disagree with my optimistic, foolish younger self. For all the messiness this album has, it is so distinctive, stunning, and entertaining. In an era where a lot of pop is soulless and dour, this album is a shining diamond in the rough to be studied for both its many successes and many failures."

**misstututulle**: "I do not know why Applause is the last track on ARTPOP. It makes much more sense as one of the first 5 or so tracks. At the time of release, nothing much else sounded like Applause. Gaga took a risk in releasing it, and it pays off." *applause comes at the end of a performance :wink: *

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Invented queer theory with BTW...invented art theory with ARTPOP...invented cowboy theory with Joanne...when will your fave"

**Leixander**: "Never understood the "If only fame had an IV" line in this song." **because she is so addicted to applause and performing that the only way she could possibly quit performing would be to directly inject fame and applause into herself /thread**

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "This song is a painful reminder of what artpop could have been. Some of the lyrics are a bit pretentious but it conveys the message well enough."

**candyninja32**: "The only song in this rate that will make me dance in a club, the best production among all the songs, I mean Lady Gaga literally invented EDM here, such a fucking BOP"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I REMEMBER THE PREMIRE OF THIS VIDEO ON GMA I WAS FUCKING SHOOK, MY LIL BISEXUAL ASS WAS SHOOK."

**SkyBlade79**: "this song bops in just about every way possible. Like omg it’s great. The lyrics, that amazing production, just omg."

**thefighter987**: "It feels like it was tacked on last second as a radio song due to it not fitting the lyrical themes and the unhinged aesthetic of the rest of the album. Still a very good song in its own right."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "deserves a 10 for singlehandedly saving the album from flopping"

**throwaway963963963**: "When this song first dropped when I was much younger I was instantly hooked. I LOVED it and thought it was the best song ever, and would watch the video everyday. However, I was always confused because whenever I would talk to any of my guy friends about it, they didn't seem to care about it even slightly, nor did they like Gaga at all. Maybe that was my first clue."

**tron94**: "TRUE CLASSIC"

**Wailordfan**: "A solid bop, and probably her best choice for lead single, but also overplayed because it is kinda her most accessible song from the album"

**stardustanddinos**: "It really captures the whole sound of ARTPOP and Gaga's mindset through all of this era, an ode to her fame, her fans and her vision for this album. The track is a banger through and through."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "im giving this a higher score because mrswearword will hate me otherwise, and that's the riggery"

# *booooooooo*

**fifthchevron**: "Mustn't let the music video sway me, the song is terrible."

**_ItsJake**: "shallow but fun pop anthem"

**cloudbustingmp3**: "A-P-P-L-A-U-S-E"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "lmao at “I live for the applause” and then releasing Joanne you definitely do not live for the applause, am I gonna keep on dragging Joanne? Yes"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m not gonna lie, this is a good song, but it belongs on Born this Way. It doesn’t sound much like the rest of the album, it’s a startlingly dark, tight piece that contrasts with the rest of the somewhat messy, colorful songs that fill the rest of ARTPOP. I also don’t quite like the violent tone shift after “Gypsy,” it’s treading essentially the same ground except now with ironic detachment, Gaga is attempting to redefine her artistic passion in a way that I don’t really feel is quite genuine. She’s clearly an artist with a vision, to say that she’s just doing it for “the applause” feels somehow not genuine at this point, especially coming at the end of ARTPOP, which is clearly a passion project."

**10footnotes**: "This song feels just a tiny bit too fast, like the producer wanted to rush through it and get to the end of the album."

**the_monkey_**: "there's something about this song that just makes my damn skin crawl. It was the most tone deaf song she could have possibly released in 2013, and this song arguably killed her mainstream career."

# Holy hell, Batman, we got an assay (and a fun one at that)

**ExtraEater**: "when i was young(er) in 2013 and oblivious to the existence of ATRL stanbases, i had no idea this song that i found on youtube (never heard on radio, depressingly enough), another gaga song after bad romance and born this way, was surrounded by so much mess (ARTPOP's sales, the fans screaming). i come here now in 2017 with a lot of things to say about Applause. i also come with a realization that /r/popheads could've existed a lot earlier than it did. there were pop forums for a long time, it shouldn't have taken long before they migrated to the forum aggregate that is reddit (when they started getting subreddits, ofc), yet how was this sub made? two things: /r/indieheads, and Carly Rae Jepsen. it's kinda funny when you think about it. poptimism has always existed, but it's especially growing now, and the move of the hated "pop" genre from /r/indieheads to its own heads sub this late in reddit's life? it all begins to make sense. this sub just so happened to be established as pop's landscape wasn't as terribly messy as before (2015), and as i said before, right as poptimism started to grow faster in the critical eye (see 1989, the album). perhaps it would've been more interesting to see /r/popheads begin in 2007/08 as gaga was beginning her career and several 10's artists haven't been established yet. imagine the top posts over time. imagine the rates. so what does all of this have to do with the song? well, this song in particular means a lot with the fans in mind. the rest of the singles do, but just listen to the lyrics with context. indulge yourself in the history, the buzz (or rather, lack thereof) surrounding ARTPOP. when i was young(er), this song was nothing but a rather cool, kinda inspiring weird-ish song that i could dance to, and the existence of this album called "ARTPOP" was way over my head. now that i've dug deeper into its layers, it's a whole new world with this song. to the rest of reddit, it's nothing, but a hypothetical /r/popheads in 2013 would've been screaming and putting out shitposts like no tomorrow (and this applies to the rest of the singles, too). it may not mean much to you, but it means a lot to the fans. to gaga. fuck, it's literally called *Applause*. and all of this is coming from someone who was never familiar with any of this in the first place. i've stumbled onto a hell of a ride, but i want in (this is still, like, an 8.5 tho)"

The powerbottoms did not pull through...

Yes. While this song has an insane amount of 11s, the Bad Taste Squad comes through again with not 1, not 2, not even 3, but 4 zeroes. Straights, amiright?

Okay, enough self loathing Imma explain my 11. Personally, this is one of the best bop songs of all time, for much of the same reasons as Fashion! and Venus. It has so many little pieces put together to make a perfect whole. It is like a taste sampler of so many different sounds spread throughout the track. I mean, there are so many pieces to this song. Every part is on point: the spoken intro that gets you hyper, the verses that explode onto the scene with its edm influences on its cheek, the prechorus (which is one of my favorite parts of any song ever), the way she melds G.U.Y. and "guy" when singing the chorus, and then that insanely amazing 2 part bridge, where a very loud more yell-y sections segues into a revamped prechorus, then exploding once more with the final chorus. Then the lyrics dont try to be anything they aren't: a silly, crazy, wacky powerbottom anthem. That intro? Pure nonsense. Literally. The hook? Literally her spelling G.U.Y. Its super simple but put together in a really complex and loveable way. Its perfect, and amazing, and it is in my top 5 songs ever. Gaga really succeeded making ARTPOP, in my opinion, because I'll repeat what i said earlier, it seems like Gaga wanted to create a plethora of as yet unheard of, weird, new, and avant-garde sounds that, unless ARTPOP Pt. 2 ever leaks, we will sadly never see again.

Very few other mainstream artists would make something this wacky and weird and new, but Gaga did. And honestly is that not something to appreciate and respect? That Gaga made... this? Even if you hate ARTPOP with every bone in your body, Gaga kept her artistic merit and made what she wanted to. She didn't and never will sell out(except for maybe the Cure hmmmm). Thats why I wildly stan this album. I know its kinda crazy to call the best album I've ever listened to ARTPOP, but I hope y'all now see where I'm coming from. And, honestly, one of the best things ever was getting messages back like, "wow, rokin, I liked ARTPOP much more than i expected! its great!" or "when ARTPOP is slowly becoming your favorite Gaga album." It just made me happy, man. TBH, ARTPOP did so much better than I expected, I'm gonna reveal the overall averages in a second, but I expected a low 6 maybe middle, with 1 or 2 songs in the top 10. <3 <3 <3

# POWER BOTTOMS

**Elitefourbrad**: "The best powerbottom anthem a bottom could ever want. Also the beat is insane on this track, with Gaga’s vocals going off the charts as usual. The “Nein Zedd!” at the end is incredibly infectious, along with one of Gaga’s best music videos/films to date."

**MrSwearword**: "Her most ostentatious song to date; screw Interscope for not sending it to radio."

**enecks**: "This song seemed like a sex jam made entirely for my tastes; bottoming, shitty acronyms, bad twitter jokes, mythological references. The production was the kind that worked equally well for dancing and grinding."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "seeing this live made me a bottom"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "The introduction is a slapper, but then the verses kick in and we get this underwhelming 2012-esque Zedd instrumental (Shotgun or Shave It Up) that doesn’t quite work. The chorus, however, is tremendous and I like it a lot."


**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "THE POWER BOTTOM ANTHEM THIS BETTER WIN OR I’M GONNA CUT A BITCH THIS TRACK IS PURE GLORY THIS IS LIKE GETTING BLOWN AND HAVING SEX AT THE SAME TIME I WILL NOT TOLERATE ANY KIND OF DISRESPECT TO THIS SONG. Zedd marry me. Joanne doesn’t have a power bottom anthem ergo ARTPOP is better." oop

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Unquestionably one of the best songs on the album, “G.U.Y.” is a fierce showcase of everything people love about Gaga. It has a solid melody with interesting production and a messy intensity. Gaga is toying with notions of gender and power dynamics in a very interesting way. She’s expressing the desire to be the “man” in the relationship, to have the power and not fear being hurt, but rather than just placing herself in the position of the man she’s redefining what it means to hold the power, not just taking control by getting on top but by embracing the power that comes with being on the bottom. A power bottom anthem. This is what more of ARTPOP should have been like."

**chubs4life**: "Queen of positions"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "While it's not really intentional, this song was a perfect single to close off the messy era that is ARTPOP. Not only the video had G.U.Y., it also had ARTPOP (the titular song), Venus and Manicure as well. Gaga truly knows how to please the gays with the video. I heard a rumor that Gaga funded the video entirely by herself becuase Interscope wouldn't want to fund a really expensive video like this. If it's true, it's another reason why I stan this crazy bitch."

**chihuahuazero**: "To quote myself from Genius, this song "is a power-bottom anthem". I have receipts: https://genius.com/3597204"

**XwildcatXJH**: "Song is amazingly catchy, has amazing beats, but the production is sometimes iffy (G.U.Y. and GUY playing over each other jumbling the initial syllables up.)"

**SkyBlade79**: "Everything about this song is iconic to me. The production is super cool and complex. The power bottom anthem lyrics, and Gaga’s voice is so sweet yet dirty in this song. This was actually how I first got into Gaga. I used to be a big skydoesminecraft fan, and when I saw that he was in a Gaga video, I had to watch it. I really loved the song and I respected her for giving the other Sky a role in her video. /gamemode artpop (also that’s not where my name came from)"

**thefighter987**: "(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBk0P27QGmc)"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "my G.U.Y. comment -- an ARTPOP film // with the creation of this track, Gaga invented the following: bottoming, sexual desire, Aphrodite, Greek mythology in general, filmography, new and exciting positions, the sense of touch, Twitter, spelling three letter words, long ass white weaves, wearing makeup well, wearing ties, taking control of love, knowing the truth, Minecraft youtubers, Michael Jackson, Jesus himself, ramming into the atmosphere, choreography, screaming NEIN ZEDD repeatedly, and being a bitch ass flop on the Hot 100. literally when will any of your faves in their entire lifetime?"

**throwaway963963963**: "When Lana Del Rey invented the concept of power bottoming, circa 2012, a rose-gold iPhone was decreed to be it's official symbol and this song/audio guide was founded as the holy scripture."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "The GP didn't appreciate this true piece of artistry when it came out. Even though it may not have come close to top 10 on the charts, it better be top 10 here."

**Wailordfan**: "the song is fun, and had the best (and like, the only) music video from the era."

**kappyko**: "right from the opening synths that make u feel transported into a virtual sex experience this track is brilliant. god bless zedd"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "Number 2 on the sex streak (these comments are gonna be out of order, idc) and it's power bottom time. Also an iconic bridge because when does Gaga ever not deliver on the bridges. I just so happen to associate this song with a person who I think is great but  who doesn't think that about me, and it just kinda makes me a bit sad when listening to it."

# WEAK BOTTOMS

**mokitsu**: "this is so LOUD. i hate it. the lyrics are so bad..."love love me please retweet" bitch i'll BLOCK you"

**dirdbub**: "this is gunna be messy when this inevitably doesn't get #1" especially when it doesn't even hit #2 :eyes:

**10footnotes**: ""I'm in charge like a G.U.Y." what kind of sexism? And that's only one of several bad lyrics in this song (see: using retweet only because it rhymes with sweet)."

deleted: wow im literally unsubbing. everybody here SUCKS DOESNT APPREICATE THE CENTURY DEFINING ARTISTRY THAT IS ARTPOP?

ARTPOP IS ACTUALLY ONE OF THE GREATEST ALBUMS OF ALL TIME IT'S AN INCREDIBLE LOOK AT THE INNER WORKING OF SOCIAL MEDIA AGE FAME AND ALL THE RIDICULOUS SHIT THAT PEOPLE DO IN ORDER TO GAIN VALIDATION 

IF IT DIDN'T DO WELL IT COULD BE BECAUSE PEOPLE NOW CONNECT TO DIY PEOPLE MORE ON SOCIAL MEDIA VS WORSHIPPING ONE PERSON. THE OLD GENERATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA ICONS WHO INVENTED THE CONCEPT WITH 2000s REALITY TV MOSTLY FAILED TO ADAPT AND HAVE FALLEN BEHIND WITH THE DEMOCRATIZATION OF THE VERY KIND OF TABLOID FAME THAT THEY CREATED.

70s were rebel with the blues rock/psych movement

80s were pacify -> big hair glam metal bands and cheesy over
 the top ballads

90s were rebel -> angst/emo/shoegaze/NIN/punk/etc

2000s were pacify -> gravitate toward glammed up pop products / fine with totally staged reality tv

2010s were rebel -> gravitate toward relatable DIY content from people just like you

Im about to serve up some tea: I know I just went on a really long rant about why GUY and ARTPOP are brilliant and amazing, but I am more than content with Partition winning.  I said before my rate even started, that if a non ARTPOP song had to win, I hope its Partition, because I LOVE Partition and it is an amazing song. Yoncé is better than Partition, but they are both tens. Its hot, raunchy, and dripping in sweat and sexuality. Its unapologetic, it bops, its insane and it is somehow such a perfect song deserving of this title.

I cannot believe some of you. I would sit there in the discord while you fools argued over which song would win and I NEVER saw Partition brought up. There is a 53 point gap, I assumed someone would figure it out eventually. But, alas, no. So, *Shock and awe.* 

Also, 1st only switched place twice. For the first week, GUY was winning. Then, the second week I got a flurry of scores that shot partition to the top. GG :)

# Want Some of that Liquor


**Elitefourbrad**: "When will sexy ass Bey drop the bass? She does in this song! Bey is really sexy in this song for sure, and the vocals are okay."

**specfagular**: "DRIVER ROLL UP THE PARTITION PLEASE. YAS MAMA"

**justdancegottabeok**: "Another two-parted song, this time serving as the ultimate sex anthem. One of her most iconic songs up-to-date, by far. Justin Timberlake returns as producer, and completely slays "Yoncé". But then "Partition" happens, being all about sexual intercourse in the back of a limousine. It's irresistible."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A transcendent bop. I love every part of this song, from the sampled instrumental opening that bangs, to the godly bass on the second part, to the sex-positive French dialogue at the end. It’s one of the standouts of the album with good reason, and one of the most perfect combinations of Bey’s vocals and instrumentals on the album."

**misstututulle**: "Once again, with the separation of tracks, Partition is an 11 contender but Yonce is just a good, slutty bop. Yonce's delivery on both tracks is so excellent. From the sneering 'sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker' to her French bridge, the song just *works*."

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "did you know selena gomez's "who says" charted higher on the billboard hot 100 than this song? rt for selena like for flopyonce"

**dirdbub**: "the Yoncé part of the song is boring, but god\*damn\* the Partition part goes off"

**deltacall**: "an iconic piece of pop culture. Absolutely no one can touch “He Monica Lewinsky’d all on my gown”"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "IT’S NOT MONICA LEWINSKY-ED ALL ON MY GOWN IT SHOULD BE HE BILL CLINTON’D ALL ON MY GOWN FFS BEYONCÉ THERE WAS NO NEED TO DRAG THE POOR WOMAN AGAIN, DID YOU EVEN KNOW SHE WAS SUICIDAL? FFS BEYONCÉ LEAVE HER ALONE. 5 Also when she starts singing Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor it almost makes me get a headache like homegirl pls stop. As usual thanks to The-Dream, Timbaland, J-Roc, BOOTS, KeY Wane and Justin Timberlake, you all rock! I can’t be the only one that sees the irony in: “Cuz when he wanna smash I'll just write another one/ I sneezed on the beat and the beat got sicker”"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Do you want a long opinion? OK. It’s perfection made a song. Yoncé sets the mood perfectly, boasting about her sexuality. The trap/drums production is amazing. ‘All on Instagram, cake by the pound’ is a perfect double entendre. The contrast between the sung bridge and the rapped verses make both even more memorable. The repetition of ‘Yoncé all on his mouth like liquor’/’Yoncé all on his mouth like lick her’ could make a hook better than most pop songs. Aaaand then we have Partition. The french accent used is almost perfect for the sexual tones. The two verses are really similar yet different to give a sense of repetition but not boredom. The hook kills me. The bridge resurrects me. Like, really, the bridge makes the song even more sexual, which a minute ago seemed almost impossible. Overall it’s the perfect hoe anthem front to back. If you didn’t gave this song an 11, you should rethink the purpose of your life."

**zamomattel**: "The French bit won the election for Macron"

**stardustanddinos**: "i thought i was prudish before this song. my hoe ass will remember this song fondly forever."

**kappyko**: "jesus christ both portions of this track are Beyonce at her absolute BEST. stellar production, brilliant writing, overall an amazing track."

**a_rain_of_tears**: "i feel like all three albums have peaks and then bad/boring/lame songs and i also feel like i'm way more generous to those when it's artpop, maybe because almost any song that isn't  hot garbage can grow on me and i'm more used to artpop. this song however is a clear peak. slay yonce"

# Fart-tition

**poppinmmolly**: "I appreciate the innovation of this song. It isn't formulaic, but it doesn't do anything for me musically."

**awryj**: "At least Blow was funky."

**PuggleMaster**: "Overrated"

# HE CAN EXPLAIN THE 0

**jamesfog**: "oop"

They were both as bad as each other. 

ANYWAY

I agree this is the peak of the album, feels like the centrepiece and the "heart" so to speak, like where all the themes came together really fluidly so it doesn't surprise me this is #1.

Therokinrolla: # BEYONCÉ

---

**Overall average**: 7.345 **// Total points:** 998.9 

---

**Syfawx**: Fun fact - I was a huge fan of Beyonce before Gaga so this album is special to me because it was the first where I can actually listen to every song and like it.

**specfagular**: This album has some AMAZING songs, but has a problem of a few songs being super boring

**_ItsJake**: Overstays it's welcome

**skiddos**: such a phenomenal album! not a single bad track on the standard version. admittedly, i listen to this the least out of the three because the songs are rather slow and long, but they're all soooo good.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I might be a Gaga stan, but this is definitely one of the best albums of the 2010s. It's a masterpiece that has excellent production and amazing vocals from Beyoncé, and the visual album is excellent. To be honest, I like this better than Lemonade. Probably one of my favourite  albums.

**dirdbub**: well that wasn't as good as it was hyped up to be

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: wow, I’m gonna explain myself cause y’all are gonna think I hate Beyoncé after my Lemonade average was 4.00 and this, I remember liking this a lot, Drunk in Love was my jam and idk why I don’t like this as much as I did. Idk, the songs I loved I just like them now and the songs I liked I just sort of meh now. Weird.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: I am more of a Lemonade fan but I will not downplay the impact this album had in the music industry.

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: Definitely the best of the three in this rate, although I’m expecting ARTPOP stans to sabotage. What’s so refreshing about it is that most of the songs are framed around a monogamous marriage rather than a random hookup or generic love song. I also like the recurring themes of feminism and self-empowerment, as well as songs about sex being female-centered without being completely obscene for the sake of it.

**IngusNarnio**: it was my album with the lowest score but I have to say it's a very good and solid album. This was actually my first time I am listening to the whole album and I am pretty pleased. There is no big BOP (except maybe XO or Drunk In Love) but all the songs works pretty well and are very coherent within the album. BEYONCE is quite different from the two other albums of this rate, it's not as pop as the two others.

**AvatarKanol**: Beyonce has an amazing voice and some of the slower songs are amazing, the whole album is very consistent.

**tron94**: Some of her greatest songs are on it, but a good chunk of the album is kinda weak.

**the_monkey_**: 6.5 A solid album, but it drags on at times. Pretty Hurts and Partition are great though!

**Wailordfan**: At one point, this album had an average of 9 even, but as I listened through it, I started getting rubbed the wrong way by a couple of songs. It is still the most cohesive and pleasing of the albums in the rate, but it lacks just a little something I was expecting from it. I'd say this was the biggest let down of the rate? But it was my highest average album.

**superr_rad**: ok i just have to say, you haven't heard beyonce until you've SEEN her live, she is incredible. even if you at the back of the arena like my broke ass. Also, my best friend is part of the Beyhive and it legit scares me a little so pls dont show her some of these comments thanks :)

**amumumyspiritanimal**: going into this album i had huge expectations and that might be the reason why it flopped to me. something was off about the songs for me most of the time. didnt had that it factor. i know that the album was a big thing for Bey and that the themes are heavy but i just wasnt feeling this, sue me.

**PandoraKris**: Basically PRISM but better lyrics?

**stardustanddinos**: Y'all know this is winning the rate. Bey changed the very rules of the game in 2013, dropping it with no warning onto a shocked world. This album is the most consistent and well produced one of the lot, and deals with self-empowerment, femininity and sex with nuance that is absent in pop usually. It's dark, sexy, powerful and even haunting in some places. The length is indeed a bit much for me, but the songs are so good. Beyonce, you outdid yourself this one. She pushes the line between pop and RnB, and her vocals are poised and graceful.

**a_rain_of_tears**: The songs on this album are too damn long

Therokinrolla: # ARTPOP

---

**Overall average**: 7.156 **// Total points:** 973.3 

---

**Syfawx**: underrated musical genius

**specfagular**: I stan Gaga but I tried to be fair. Jewels N Drugs is a bad song but other than that this album is really solid.

**_ItsJake**: Pure Art

**skiddos**: this is a solid EDM album (madeon, white shadow, and zedd really did That), but i understand its criticisms. the album is a mess. hardly any of these tracks feel like quintessentials in gaga's catalog. i listen to this album the most out of the three because of all the bops.

**patronsaintofaspies**: The album is messy as fuck, and so was its era, but Gaga's creativity really shines on it and it has more than a couple of bops. I'm pretty sure that this'll end up either frighteningly dated or vindicated by history. Hopefully it's the latter.

**dirdbub**: mess rating - 8/10

**ExtraEater**: rating this album against *other* albums is both the best and worst idea /r/popheads has ever had

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: The album is great and all but I am honestly not a fan of the era itself and I am glad I wasn't a Gaga stan during this time cause otherwise I would have been worried. This era gave a Gaga a huge meltdown and it almost ruined her career and as a KatyCat, I am scared that the Witness era is almost doing the same thing to Katy. Otherwise, this album could have been better but it's still good!

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: Ah, there was no way this was going to live up the expectations that Gags set for it but my god what a disappointment. It’s overly loud, obnoxious, has very little to do with art, and its best tracks are generic sex-love-fame bangers. I struggle to believe Gaga wrote 50+ songs for the project and these were the best 15. Still, it was the [most](http://i.telegraph.co.uk/multimedia/archive/02615/gaga_2615776b.jpg) [entertaining](http://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2013/10/21/article-2469912-18E04B2D00000578-906_634x1222.jpg) [carcrash](http://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/79/590x/secondary/101551.jpg) I can remember in pop music and I wouldn’t have it any other way

**IngusNarnio**: Well one of my all-time favorite album so I may be biased. I listened to it A LOT. And each time I listen to it again, it's still very fresh.

**wearingsox**: This was one of my favorite albums of 2013, in all its messy glory.

**AvatarKanol**: Uneven album, I liked the secong half more than the first but there are some great songs on it.

**robbiec_**: underrated as fuck and I'm being unbiased

**SkyBlade79**: Score - 6

**tron94**: YAAAAASSS! As someone new to this, I always thought this album was a great success. Didn't see #ARTFLOP coming (All the signs were there though)

**the_monkey_**: 2.5 She was better than this album, and I think thats the reason it really underperformed. It has some gems (Gypsy should have been the lead) but overall its just a mess of songs that had potential but needed way more work. (Venus) Or some that needed to just be deleted (*cough* Swine, Jewels n Drugs)

**Wailordfan**: This was the biggest surprise for me. I love this album to death as a whole, beginning to end, but picking out songs individually made me realize this album needs to be an 'all or nothing' album, with a lot of songs hard to love individually. The album should be an experience, and rating everything separate takes away a bit of the uniqueness of the album. Personally, I prefer ARTPOP to all of the other albums here, but it ended up .1 points below Prism to take the lowest spot due to individual song rates.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: i literally have nothing to say about artpop i know people like it here but outside of the echo chamber we all know what gaga did with this album and during this era. never forget volantis

**PandoraKris**: Witness 2.0

**stardustanddinos**: As an ardent little monster, this album does evoke very mixed feelings from me. It was way too EDM-y for my tastes, and wasn't really the reverse Warholian experience she touted. A controversial era even for Gags, the album will probably be etched in public memory for Gaga's general pretentiousness than the music itself. However, ARTPOP is far from bad, in G.U.Y., Gypsy, Do What U Want and Applause, Gaga is at her best, showcasing her incredible vocals and killer beats. It still is wildly inconsistent and loud, and REALLY doesn't match the inventiveness and panache of the TFM/BTW eras. She bought too much into her own hype, and it shows.

**a_rain_of_tears**: This is actually my second favourite Gaga album, and in contention for first. That probably says something about me as a person.

Rockified: artpop all the way. yes, the production was messy as fuck, but it's gaga's old manager to take the blame. if he wasn't a swine, artpop would be the bop of the decade and we would get act ii from heaven. but screw the production, music not the bling, the album's material is awesome and EDM/dubtep is officially my shit.

Dracyoshi: so, funny story  
I couldn't decide whether to give my 11 to G.U.Y or Dark Horse, so I posted a poll in the Discord to help me decide. G.U.Y won the poll, and I ended up agreeing with the result in the end anyway  

If Dark Horse had won that poll and it got my 11 instead, it'd have been over for G.U.Y.

Receipts: http://www.strawpoll.me/13318228/r [[Image because people are gonna vote after I post this]](http://i.imgur.com/sgP2gOS.png)
