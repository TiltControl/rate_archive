[RATE] 2013 Ultimate Album Rate Day 1! AND YOU'RE GONNA HEAR ME *bork*
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6naq13/rate_2013_ultimate_album_rate_day_1_and_youre/

Hello Hello Hello!

ITS HAPPENING OH GOD

###Welcome to the [2013 Ultimate Album Rate Day 1!!](http://i.imgur.com/8WvjXhf.gifv)


Here are some quick notes and facts about this rate and what we will be doing today:

* Today we will be revealing 19 songs (#49-31) 
* We Will being at 3 PM EST both in this thread and [in the plug.dj here!](plug.dj/popheads)
* The average controversy score is 2.2859. So, anything higher than that should be considered controversial. 
* The overall average of ALL the scores is 7.0387. Solid. 

And perhaps my favorite fact of all…

* **THERE WERE 137 PARTICIPANTS**, aka, this is the most competed in rate in all of /r/popheads history! Thanks a ton guys! My agressive promotion tactics on the Discord and Plug paid off big time!
* It will get messy. Tears will be shed, blood will be shed, slurs will be thrown. And I cannot wait.

And, finally, before we get started, I just want to thank everyone that participated again because doing this and interacting with people about the rate has been a blast! Also, thank you to the @nazimods for selecting my rate and letting me host because it has seriously been really fun for me. It was cool seeing people saying they like ARTPOP more than they expect, or seeing someone go into the second half of PRISM expecting the worst but coming out loving it, or seeing someone tell me how much of a slut drop Partition is. 

## THANK ALL OF YOU!! :)

**superr_rad**: "yas gaga if I knew gaga collaborated with twista I would’ve been listening to this a long time ago..the hook is kinda shit but the verses are great from all of them. I was not expecting that, and it gets my 11 cause i know yall wont appreciate it as much"

**jamesfog**: "A problematic bop! People hate this song but it still bangs"


**enecks**: "So, I thought I had settled into the album's groove of weirdly produced pretentious jams. When a orchestra tuning turned into TI's mediocre rapping, I was honestly shook and not in a good way. The beat was a glitchy, loud, intense mess. Gaga felt like a feature in her own song; I guess that goes with the album's themes of submission and fame but still why? I give this a 6 because it's unintentional comedy gold. This song works better sped up."


**mirandacrocsgrove**: "this song issa bop set a time & date for me to fuck ur shit up if you say otherwise"

# This is *NOT* how you make that money

**10footnotes**: "This song is just too messy and unpleasant to listen to. There are too many ideas here - it desperately needed some conscientious editing to cut out at least half of them."

**jelboo**: "I 'get' this song, too, but no thanks Gagz"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "literally delete it fat. remove it chubby. annihilate it chunky. from the "elementary school orchestra practicing their first concert" intro to the annoying ass rap features and wack ass pancake hook... just.. wyd gaga. this is literally a Kreayshawn reject."

**throwaway963963963**: "gags y"

**sjoors**: "Why did gaga think the gays needed a rap feature that isn't frank ocean?"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Gaga gets completely outshone here by the rap features. In particular the final verse by Twista is extremely impressive, he goes incredibly fast and he manages to capture the essence of the song better than anyone else, but each of the rap verses is good in its own way. The beat is interesting and strikes this cool tone where it kind of sounds like the background music for a villain in a spy movie. In fact, Gaga is probably the least interesting part of this track, her chorus is kind of bad and her lyrics on the verses don’t make a ton of sense."

**Wailordfan**: "This song is a mess, and makes you wonder what made Gaga think this would fit the sound of the album other then to make her sound just a bit edgier then she already did."

**xanthalasajache**: "Why the fuck is Gaga the worst part of the song lol"


**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "How are you worse a lot making trap than Miley and Katy?  No seriously, this song makes me so fucking angry. Why in the fuck are you doing trap with TI, Twista, and TOO $HORT? Girl if you don't Go back to making just regular ass pop music."


**lady_sable**: "This remains the only Gaga song I've deleted from my library."

**PandoraKris**: "Your words are like Chinese water torture"

**kappyko**: "when u turn on your playstation 3 then some assholes decide to rap over it"

# PANCAKES

**Elitefourbrad**: "The line “Slap honey on a young pancake” pretty much explains the whole song. For a rap song, it’s actually not horrible and I’m glad to see Gaga experimenting with new genres and sounds unlike Katy Perry’s boring bubble-gum pop."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "People tend to not be so high on this song but I actually kinda like it. It's fun, even with the "slap honey on the young pancake" or whatever that line says."

**robbiec_**: "pancake"

**awhile2**: "featuring Young Pancake"

**stardustanddinos**: "Aside the iconic pancake line and TI's verse, really not feeling it here. Too many cooks spoil the broth and this is a live example."

i wonder if you are starting to sense a pattern...

# It Takes Two To Tango

**specfagular**: "kween of solving relationship problems"

**mokitsu**: "this is kind of a surprise, i really like the verses but the mixing sounds a bit off in the chorus? the instrumental seems too low and her vocals too loud. this sounds like an acclaimed female indiepop singer-songwriter's breakthrough single"

**poppinmmolly**: "I love this song! So good. I was listening to Witness on Spotify and this came up (I was on mobile and don't have premium sue me) and I'm like thank God finally something I like and then I looked and I noticed it was on Prism."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is a surprisingly mature song, definitely the most mature one on the album, it’s about accepting her half of the blame and apologizing while still pointing out that a) the problems are not entirely her fault and b) she can’t reach peace alone. It displays a nuance that a lot of people don’t associate with Katy Perry, and it’s very pretty."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "another example of spirituality with the recurring astrological thingies. i really love how she owns up to her mistakes, and the message is extremely relevant to me. the execution is great too, she really brings her A game here. the song is also not building on cliches, but plays on the fact that maturity comes from the inside, starting with accepting our mistakes and facing the consequences. This song feels pretty mature. For real, editing my submission because i need to clarify but i really want to give this my 11 upon further consideration. i cant. ugh. but i should. this is going to be my 2017 anthem besides melodrama and i know it but i really shouldnt snatch xo from its 11."

**kappyko**: "getting sick of these already"

# Please don't Tango

**MrSwearword**: "that “mercury in retrograde” line is lurid. Everything else is subpar but…committed I guess."

**misstututulle**: "Maybe it's ADHD, but I could not wait for this song to be over. It just feels like nothing ever really happens."

**dirdbub**: "this is a non-song"

**chubs4life**: "Omg, I never heard this song before but while it was on I could not bear to hear the whole thing. So I had to skip midway. Ugh so bad"

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "What’s with the sudden focus on astrology?"

**XwildcatXJH**: "meh"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "For only 2 dollars a day, you too can avoid listening to this song."

**jelboo**: "No, just stop :'("

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Yes, Katy, it takes two. You need to have two good halves of album, not just one."

# CARLY DID IT BETTT R!!!!1!11!!

**lassidoggy**: "wow katy i’m so glad carly rae jepsen re-invented the phrase “it takes two”"

**VodkaInsipido**: "Carly and the Boat did it better sis."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I'm upset it's not a cover like Carly's"

**candyninja32**: "Meh, CRJ's It takes two is superior"

**cyborglilith**: "ft. lil yacty"

**tron94**: "I was hoping for a Rob Base & DJ E-Z Rock cover, kind of bummed out. Carly did it better."

**sjoors**: "Carly and Lil' Yachty are shook"

**jamesfog**: "Carly is shook!"

# The Right Battle

**fifthchevron**: "GOAT bonus track, best song Katy ever did."

**mokitsu**: "This is giving me dark version of Unconditionally teas, definitely should've been in the standard version as well. the synth line, omg! love this."

**bluehxrizon**: "i love the pre chorus of this song, especially on the lines wheres she's harmonizing with herself. the production here is like nothing i've ever heard on a katy perry song (although that would change after hearing witness) and i find the lyrics relatable with a sweet touch. i know this will go out early but i can dream okay!!!"

**thefighter987**: "Among the best lyrics in katy’s discography, but coupled with among her worst vocals and production."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "seriously why the fuck didnt i listen to this album earlier literally every song is something that couldve been relevant to me since 2013. this song is sooo extremely relatable jesus."

# The Wrong Battle

**Elitefourbrad**: "It’s a bad message, you should fight for every battle, not just the ones you choose to fight in."

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/xZnFA648)**

WHOOPS! The first single is out and it is the songs that made cultural appropriation fashionable. Oh wait no it didn't. I gave the song a 10 because it bops hard, but apparently cultural appropriation and good scores are mutually exclusive. Who knew? (give P!nk your 10s)

---

# Appreciation

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is such a guilty pleasure. This song is pandering and weirdly racist, Katy struggles to hit the high notes and sings a lot of the low notes in this weird monotone, but I’ll be damned if this isn’t so much fun. I’m from SoCal and this is exactly what people where I’m from think of when they think of being cool, and I’m feeling the fantasy. There’s also something undeniably campy about it, like yeah we know it’s not cool but let’s pretend like is."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "If there is something Katy is good at, it's making party bops. I know it's such a controversial score to give to this song to especially I can see why people find this super corny and cheesy but this song is just too much filled with fun and I applaud Katy for adding this song to the album."

**SkyBlade79**: "japanesey queen"

**gannade**: "This is only my fifth favorite song in the rate (after Haunted, which better win, DWUW, Rocket, and Dark Horse), but I'm giving it my 11 for what it stands for. This kind of song perfectly suits Katy's tongue-in-cheek humor with its inconsequential lyrics, lightweight beat, and fun synths. It's fun, it's catchy, and it's a masterpiece honestly. Yes, the bridge is cringe-y as hell, but it only further encapsulates Katy's biggest strength: her ability to sell FUN songs. I think the reason her current era isn't doing as well is because it's just not as fun. And out of all the songs in Katy's entire discography, "This Is How We Do" is the most fun. Also, the video is everything ARTPOP wanted to be and more. It's Katy's best MV!!"

**darealestt**: "Corny and cornrowy"

**jamesfog**: "Problematic bop!"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "One Word; Japanese-y."

# Appropriation

**MrSwearword**: "blah blah, “appropriation”…the song sucks. Leave it at that."

**enecks**: "This is what pop sounds like to people who hate pop. A soulless, meaningless pile of nothing that makes me await the nukes that will annihilate the Earth within the next decade."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this song gets 1 point for the cute "mariah careyoke" line and loses the rest for being trash"

**PurplePot**: "racist trash song"

**misstututulle**: "Fuck TIHWD. Mariah Carey-oke. No. This is no big deal. Teenage Dream is stacked with great bops, so the quality of PRISM just lets me down. TIHWD is perhaps the biggest example of this, as it's piss poor lyrics and music make it too unlikable and somewhat hard to listen to."

**shrekinatohr**: "I'm giving this a 0 because of her sorry ass attempt at cultural appropriation in the MV, but the song wasn't that great to begin with."

**lassidoggy**: "Any song with “Mariah Carey-oke” deserves to be draggt"

**chubs4life**: "Why why why was this a single?"

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "This sounds like the unholy love child of Ke$ha and Rebecca Black. Absolutely fucking dreadful and if you give this higher than a 2 you have no taste. The word ‘Japanesy’ is enough to earn the 0."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is...problematic to say the least."

**the_monkey_**: "eh its fun but not really a masterpiece"

**superr_rad**: "wheres that gif of Michael scott when you need it"

# CRINGEY

**VeganSquash**: "lyrics are garbage and the chorus is cringe."

**skiddos**: "just so cringey... that terrible dubstep production tries to make the song sound cool, and the lyrics are unbelievably cheesy"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The lyrics are kind of cringe, but this gets stuck in my head a lot."

**lady_sable**: "Fun and catchy, but the lyrics are cringey."

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/tfG3X09H)**

I vaguely remember Katy perry lurching to give this song some vague resemblance of emotion?? Still not very good. 

---

# i hate u

**wildcosmias**: ""Sometimes I wish my skin was a costume/That I could unzip and strip" i'm sure its these kinds of lyrics that taylor(d) swift was thinking of when she cleverly parodied miss katy's songwriting in the #1 Grammy winning single, Bad Blood (feat. Kendrick Lamar)"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "…If that’s what you wanna do… Katy, I think you need to take some lessons from The 1975 and actually learn how to make a bop called Love Me."

**SkyBlade79**: "snooze"

**sjoors**: "this sounds exactly the same as ghost"

# i love you

**Macubass**: "I love Katy more than myself"

**specfagular**: "This is a great self love anthem. Love it so much."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I’m honestly shocked at how solid the middle of this album is. Love Me is defiantly Katy Perry, but not in a bad way. It sounds different than many of the songs she’s made in the past, and it’s bittersweet in all the good ways."

**skiddos**: "a lovely ballad with soothing production"

**Dr_Brewer**: "Queen of self-empowerment."

**bluehxrizon**: "i feel like i'm the only person who enjoys the second half of this album. this song especially feels like it lives up to her promised theme of "letting the light in" and inspiration and stuff like that"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Katy has some incredible production."

**tron94**: "It's a refreshing ballad, I love it!"

**Magic_warlock0-**: "A good enough self-empowerment song for being who you need to be. Unfortunately, self-empowerment sounds a tad dull coming from KP like this. YAWN"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "Nice positive song :)"

**musicotic**: "Pretty cool 😎 song."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "some RuPaul realness here. if you cant love yourself, how in the hell you gonna love somebody else can i get an amen? this song speaks to me, thanks u/therokinrolla for making me discover this. seriously this is my #3 contender for that 11"

**kappyko**: "it's pretty!!!"

# Oh no Spankky's being weird again

**SpanKKy1**: "An ode to Shawn"

# Well there is a couple nice ones

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "cute"

**JohnnyToby**: "style and dwuw wish they could be this"

**XwildcatXJH**: "pretty good"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Kind of sad IMO"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "one of my favorite carpe diem songs. fun story: heard this first when i fell asleep while spotifying and this song came up. first i thought it was a remastered 80's song, and almost made a somersault when i found out it was from Katy Perry. it was around early 2014, when i wasnt fond of her that much. its not a big song for me emotionally, but still go back to it sometimes to remind myself that we have to live life to the fullest to give a meaning to our existence. and that i desperately need someone."

# If all we have is This Moment im jumping off a cliff...

**Elitefourbrad**: "I fell asleep during this song multiple times, it took me 20 minutes to get through it completely."

**MrSwearword**: "I can’t press rewind but I pressed SKIP on this American Idol sounding winner’s song"

**specfagular**: "This is so generic it huuuuurts"

**_ItsJake**: "more synth, sounds the same still"

**VeganSquash**: "I rolled my eyes listening to this"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The lyrics are a bit boring."

**wearingsox**: "Def an inferior “A Moment Like This”, her vocals are shaky and shrieky."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "How the hell is this album not over yet. It just keeps getting worse. I’d rather live tweet a prostate exam than finish this album."

**cyborglilith**: "very fitting for prism, an overall boring album"

# literally nothing

**misstututulle**: "One of the better songs on the second half of the LP, but that's not saying much."

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

**lady_sable**: "Ugh, a lot of the songs in the latter half of this album completely run together for me. Boring and generic."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Generic but pretty. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like it but I’m not about to die on a hill defending it as a masterpiece."

# Converts

**Elitefourbrad**: "It has a good vibe from it, it’s a nice chill song that I could imagine hearing in Forever 21."

**mokitsu**: "hmm this should've been on the standard version tbh. i love the production and the naughty religious lyrics."

**VeganSquash**: "this is amazing! The pre-chorus gives me chills. this song is so heavenly"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Unconditionally, but more Christian."

**bluehxrizon**: "convert me to christianity queen"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Invented Christianity."

**candyninja32**: "Oh man! I love this song, gives me an old school Linkin park vibe, I live for productions like this, vocals are mixed pretty well in this song"

**zamomattel**: "Invented religion"

**ignitethephoenix**: "I like the ethereal feel of this song."

**cyborglilith**: "yes"

**awhile2**: "best throwback song on the album"

**jamesfog**: "Katheryn Hudson is shook"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "she shouldve promoted this album as spiritual instead of dark. this song is a literal example of that. i really like it. not as much as the rest, but its still nice and the concept works well, especially with the cover art."

# Atheists

**enecks**: "If you want to make your song spiritual Katy Perry, you need to give it power, mystery, or something interesting."

**borpo**: "This record feels like it’s 20 tracks long. I was going to say she could have cut six or seven songs out of it, but that is almost half the album. Really boring second half."

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "Legendary Lovers II (~~Melodrama~~ Trash)"

**throwaway963963963**: "My :) Prism :) Positivity :) Is :) Rapidly :) Dying :)"

**tron94**: "It's fine, nothing much more than it is."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "Lyrics are not too bad, but still a disappointing song. I also feel like an angel; this song is killing me."

**xanthalasajache**: "Did she meet Judas Iscariot halfway through the album becasue this is horrible in a bad way."

**kappyko**: "another nothing song but the production lifts it from complete boring-ness. cut-up vocals are my biggest musical turn-on"

# He isn't wrong

**SkyBlade79**: "I don’t know what to put here so let me just say that Instruction by Demi Lovato is a bop"

And Bey's first song goes DOWN and this song is personally unsurprising. This is my 0, because those unattractive, raspy vocals take away so much away from what could've been a decent song. Furthermore, however, its waaaay to long. If this song was like 2 minutes long i could handle. but sheesh. **SHEESH*

---
# Choke me

**Elitefourbrad**: "The sexy, breathy tone from Bey’s voice isn’t enough for me on this track."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this song would stick out more if it hadnt been sandwiched between the two best songs on the album but its still so good. can definitely hear that Caroline Polachek wrote the demo; her vocal styling is all over this and Bey sounds amazing"

**mokitsu**: "underrated MASTERPIECE. a class in restraint. this song always gets paid so much dust. Bey's falsetto or whatever is heavenly, sounds literally orgasmic. and right after she starts user her lower register/talking voice?!??! also those last few seconds are so good..."

**justdancegottabeok**: "This song creates a certain mood with it that is undescribable, but it's incredible. Her vocals are renewing, but the highlight must be the outro. Yes, that outro is just really good."

# to death

**gannade**: "beyonces cracking voice is no angel (hahahaha)"

**_ItsJake**: "it's fine, but the whisper voice gets annoying really quick"

**wearingsox**: "I love the production but I found Beyonce’s voice on the hook uncomfortable to listen to."

**ImOnABeach**: "I love the vocals, yet its one of the weaker songs from the album"

**jelboo**: "By far the weakest song on the album. Not good in any way, really."

**throwaway963963963**: "Little known fact, while BEYONCE s/t was putting the music industry out of business, it was simultaneously destroying the sleeping pill industry, with this song."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "Perfect title, cuz this song is hellish. I really hate the auto-tune and the way Beyonce sings this song. The trailing off at the end is pretty bad too. Definitely one of the weaker songs off this track"

**kappyko**: "she managed to make the sounds of auto-erotic asphyxiation boring. she's just getting choked more throughout the song. please help her"

# SWWWWIIIIIIIIYNNE

As many comments below will let you know, this song is about Gaga's rapist, calling him a pig and disgusting. It is actually a really depressing song behind the very loud and brash production, however, admittedly, this production is H A R S H. The pre-drop winding buildup is literally 15 seconds long, and the drop itself is long to, but it bangs hard and I love it.

It also got two 11's and sixteen 10s, yet again proving gaga as the queen of controversy.

---
# BOP IT

**Elitefourbrad**: "A powerful song about Gaga’s rapist, and she get’s her message across well. The drop in this song is insane as well, one of the better EDM tracks on the album."

**MrSwearword**: "puke performance that pissed off Cher and Semi Tomato. LEGENDARY"

**OliverQueer**: "A vomit anthem!"

**justdancegottabeok**: "COME THROUGH WITH THAT DUBSTEP GAGA! Damn, that build-up to the breakdown is so amazing. What a bop."

**BionicFunhouse**: "This song is kind of like my ugly child. I love it with all of my heart, but I understand why others may not enjoy it as much as I do. Expecting this to leave quickly, though. I think Swine is one of the most important songs on ARTPOP. While I don't expect people to love it, I really hope everyone respects it for what it is."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I have a bad feeling that this song might be out on Day 1 so I am giving this a 10 in hopes that it doesn't actually happen. This song is actually about Gaga's raptist, in which she calls her a swine. What I really loved about this song is how raw her anger is and she manages to make it still danceable with that beat drop that is supposed to make you feel dirty, like a swine."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "THIS SONG IS A FUCKING BANGER AND I LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT {That subject matter tho, damn Gaga}"

**superr_rad**: "yas gaga so im listening to this knowing what its about and all I can say is yaaas gaga drag him through the mud"

# VOMIT

**Macubass**: "this song is like a magikarp, not very good"

**enecks**: "This song was the one I hated most on first listen. The production was a drilling painful noisy mess, and Gaga's vocals really sucked. Listening to it this day, the only redeeming value is making Satsuki jokes about it."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "More Zedd teas. Except this time, the lyrics are quite captivating, and I love the visuals and viscerality here. It’s just a shame it’s shoved behind an obnoxious and dated instrumental."

**dirdbub**: "every time I hear this song I think of the pig emoji and I just ccn't considering what the gay community has done to that emoji. I just fucken can't, I just fsdlf;kajpoarwijl"

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus**: "I like how this song started but it kind of just descended into a mess"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "At first I was gonna give “Swine” a 0 because it was really unpleasant to listen to and was needlessly harsh on the listener, but according to Gaga it’s a song about rape, and her expressing her rage and fury. This made it make sense to me, but it didn’t make me like it. Definitely a track to always skip over unless you’re in a very bad mood."

**stardustanddinos**: "Literally tho. What IS this vomit?"

# An anonymous entry

**Anonymous**: "I bopped to this hard back in 2013 when this came out, and I lived for it, but it gradually phased out for me, and the themes are a bit more personal. I guess if anything, this song started becoming a reality to me? I had a weird part of last year where I was in very mentally unstable random hookups with older men, and was really just using this to find meaning/purpose, and I guess I hear a part of me in this song now. I don't want to give it a higher rating, only because of how it has kinda became autobiographical to myself, but it also has an annoying buildup and drop, even if Gaga has some great emotion."

After that fun Gag-oncé detour, back to Katy. This songs lyrics are sweet, touching, personal, if only the delivery was any good. Its a nice song and some of these comments are genuinely touching, which kinda makes me sad that its out so early. Should've lasted. Sorry /u/JunkyGS :(

---

# Graceful

**mokitsu**: "such a vulnerable track, i love the lyrics. the "lying in the bathroom floor" line always has me shook and when the marching drums start and she goes accapella it's such a great moment."

**henry413**: "A good album closer that manage to be both depressing and hopeful."

**Jackcs903**: "I feel like this is the most soul and emotion she’s had in a song in awhile"

**skiddos**: "i hold this song very close to my heart. through my hardest times in 2013/2014, i always listened to this especially because at that time i was questioning my faith. katy hudson really got to me with this one."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Damn. Katy really does know how to end an album, doesn't she?"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "gorgeous, probably her best song"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Katy manages to show vulnerability here. This is one of her most personal tracks to date, and it’s nice to hear Katy being real with us. In most of her songs she’s playing a character, and maybe she’s doing that here, but if she is I believe it."

**dropthehammer11**: "Nice vocals here"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "THESE TEARS ARE REAL."

**ignitethephoenix**: "I really like how personal the song is for Katy, I don't think I've heard a song that personal from her. It's a really beautiful song."

**the_monkey_**: "Honestly Katy should do more stripped down songs like this, its beautiful."

**Wailordfan**: "A touching ballad, and I actually listened to this for a while when the album first came out."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "first listened to this after a popheads thread. couldnt stop crying after. the song is so relatable and amazing. the song itself lives up to katy's promise of a darker album. especially after her witness world wide i appreciate this song. hearing what she has gone through and the fact that this beautiful song is it's end product is beautiful. if this goes out before the top 15 popheads i will be sad"

# Graceless

**lady_sable**: "I like how Katy is able to convey a lot of emotion here. Too bad the song is Not Good."

**wearingsox**: "Lyrics are poorly written but I appreciate the message and Katy expressing herself sincerely."

**ImOnABeach**: "A decent song, but at least 2 minutes too long."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I JUST WANT IT TO END. Also, I tried skipping this with the buttons on my laptop that control that shit, and by control, I mean they can play/pause and go backwards or forwards for songs, and Famous Last Words started playing, is it a sign? IDK."

**jelboo**: "Complicated, this one. I absolutely loved seeing Katy open up about fame and mental health. I respect her as a person immensely now, and appreciate/understand her struggles and the way she's fighting against them. But I dislike this song and I can't relate to its 'faith' message in any way."

**awhile2**: "Jesus this album falls apart so bad at the end. Like how does anyone think this is a better album than witness?"\

# GASP. SHOCK. AWE.

Oop here's the second single out, which is also Katy's second single out. I was very conflicted during this rate. Because Roar isn't a bad song at all, its okay, and I think you guys treated it too harshly. However, for a genuinely long time, it was the very first song out and that made me gag so much that tea would've been incredible. Sadly, the song is both out too early and too late. 

This song has really nice production and is arguably peak Katy. Cheesy lyrics aside, this song and its video defined 2013 in music, which is more than you could say about artpop oop

---
# CAUSE I AM THE CHAMP-YUN

**mokitsu**: "i don't give a fuck, this song is such a banger and it instantly makes me feel better and it gives me chills. the chorus is SO big. this was made for arenas tbh."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Yes, okay, this song is a collection of clichés, but you know what? Screw everyone else, this is a great song. I think “Roar” is a lot better than people give it credit for. The song does have a perspective and a story, and it’s actually pretty inspirational. There’s a time and a place for generalized positivity, the song speaks in platitudes and isn’t extremely personal because it makes it easy for the listener to relate. I know many people have been helped and inspired by this song, and I count myself among them. Don’t underestimate the power of a twee inspirational jam. Plus the production is top notch."

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "The production is gorgeous, but the lyrics are pretty mediocre, and her voice is so goddamn blunt."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "I’m only stanning for this song because Brendon Urie put it on his playlist for Pride."

**musicotic**: "SOOO CATCHY! That pre-chorus to chorus transition is fab, and the rise to the top of 'Roar!' is glorious.  Only a low rating because oversaturation"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "ahw i feel sorry for XO being in this rate because this would definitely be my 11 otherwise. i know yall hate this song but shitty self-love songs were the ones that helped me through a rough time, including this and fight song. also this is a bop stop hating on it if you do you love trump bc this song=hillary and there are no other options its in the bible"

# Katy is NOT the champion

**Elitefourbrad**: "One of the worst songs I’ve heard from Katy, it’s radio friendly at least. Brave is better, and Applause should’ve gotten the success Roar got. A boring song to open a boring filler album."

**enecks**: "A real bleached asshole of a song. Generic, soulless, flavorless. I can't even think of this song while listening to it, it's such a black hole where all charisma and joy gets sucked into it. All I think of is "Wow, how did Katy Perry get away with Ur So Gay?" That song was barely distinguishable from some of the homophobic bullying I heard when I was growing up."

**Bingcrusher**: "Most boring lead single ever."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is Part of Me lite, and not in the best way. I will say, I love the subdued “hey’s” in the song, but when you hear the “I’ve got the eye of the tiger, you can’t help. The chorus is equally grating, and it sucks because I like the instrumental and verses a bit."

**misstututulle**: "Generic inspirational pop ballad. Utterly forgettable and uninteresting, which is disappointing coming off Teenage Dream. Katy can do better 'generic pop', on Roar it feels like she really phoned it in."

**zamomattel**: "This has two things working against it 1) it blatantly rips off Queen Sara Bareilles 2) Icon Katya was eliminated to it on Drag Race. Still bops though"

**jelboo**: "This song is what I think is usually wrong with Katy's music - or, the songs I dislike, at least. This feels so fake and disingenuous. Childish beat, childish lyrics, terrible video. It's all plastic, no depth, no soul. Meh."

**throwaway963963963**: "My username was inspired by the lyrics to this song."

ugh to the nth degree where n=the biggest. I already don't like Frank Oceans voice. Adding it to this already boring and way to long song just murders me. this song leaves me haunted^TM because of how shockingly bland and unecessary it is. It got some 10s and an 11 tho so w/e

---
# Here are the "normal comments

**enecks**: "Queen of Super Mario Sunshine secret levels. Blessed be Beyoncé."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not gonna lie, I was a little underwhelmed hearing this Frank Ocean collaboration. After the dust settled, though, I found myself really enjoying it. It’s stunning, and the two pair well."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is one of the more subdued tracks on the album and I find something really appealing about Beyoncé pulling back and hiding that unstoppable vocal power we know she has. It really draws you in, and while everyone loves high belting it’s nice to hear her flexing her lower ranges. It’s a fantastic display of her presence as a performer, and the production is surprisingly tasteful compared to the rest of the album."

# A Cute Story

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I remember the time that we watched the visuals of S/T in the plug.dj room by order last year and /u/ffourthofjuly was with us. She had no idea that Drake and Frank Ocean were in the album so we were keeping quiet of the collabs in the album just to see her shook and suprised. Unfortunately, someone told her that Drake is in the album before his verse on Mine came on so that is kinda ruined but thankfully, we managed not to tell her about Frank in this song and we were so anxious for her reaction when Superpower came on. The moment she heard Frank's vocals, she was like "wait what is this frank?" and she literally screamed on the chat. It was probably one of the best moments I have ever witnessed as a popheads user. [Here are the screencaps of that very moment](http://imgur.com/a/dNYwv)!"

# I Love Puns!

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Superboring"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "mediocrepower"

# There are so many comments about Frank Good Lorde

**Elitefourbrad**: "The gay king Frank saves this track from what would be a forgettable song."

**MrSwearword**: "groovy as fuck and throwback to ffourth being shook when she found out Frank was on it."

**Macubass**: "i love frank as well"

**misstututulle**: "A great song. An amazing piece of music. From the lyrics to the music and Bey and Frank's harmonies, it all just works."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Frank, I love you, from but one bisexual man to another, this is the modt boring song on the album."

**bluehxrizon**: "i expected more from a Frank x Bey collab tbh"

**BoyWithTheMostCake**: "Frank <3"

**VodkaInsipido**: "D A D D Y  F R A N K. This could’ve made a Christmas classic."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Ok Frank, you did that™"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "FRANK OCEAN SLAY MY LIFE"

**zamomattel**: "Bey & Frank my lord"

**thefighter987**: "I expected a lot more from a colab between the king and queen of r&b. The accapella based beat does nothing for me and the melody is so bare bones I forget how it goes after every listen."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "Frank and Beyonce are a strong combination! The slow pace of the song reveals a quiet strength of overcoming challenges! Ocean's vocals bring a lot of extra power to this one!"

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "idk it might be the producers because although i like her voice and franks addition still feel awful about this song. i just dont like it overall, like i start to enjoy the song for the first minute and then just hate it and want to turn my whole computer off"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this feels kinda calming... Frank's deep voice in my ears soothes me."

i literally go into a trance listening to this song, the way she subtly sings in a way that sounds like talking but just has enough tone and melody to it, the her beautiful higher notes at the end how could you rate this low?????

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/UfQt4JCD)**

The best of the filler tracks on PRISM, Ghost was where the last bit of joy is seen throughout this album. That chorus drops a **BOMB* and is actually really touching considering its about her and Bumblefuck Brandt's relationship. Deserved better.

---
# Love Me Katy please

**mokitsu**: "this ends up being the most emotional and personal track on this album, Katy ha Lemonade. i looove the part in the chorus that goes "there's just an echo where your heart used to beat" - and her telling Russel dead to her? so iconic."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I also haven’t heard this song, but it’s really nice. It has a bit more passion than most Katy songs, and manages to feel a little different. I like it."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "There are parts of this song that I really like. I think the story of it is very beautiful, and the main part of the chorus is very nice, but something about the faded out parts of the chorus (when I look back never would have known that) are just so awkward that they encumber the song."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Hearing this song is so sad, especially Not Like The Movies from her previous album 'Teenage Dream' was also dedicated to the same subject matter of the song, Russell Brand. :("

**throwaway963963963**: "After this song I'm now going to have to go door to door around my neighborhood selling Prism. I mean, like an evangelic, not like a whore. Well, maybe both..."

**Magic_warlock0-**: "KP playing to her strengths; lyrics that give you a clear vision of her songs. A lovely way to give a touching song for a lost relationship, alongside those regrets."

# Ghost Me Katy please

**Elitefourbrad**: "A song dedicated to the time that Russell Brand just, ghosted Katy. I liked the message, but she should’ve stayed ballady instead of poppy on this track."

**cloudbustingmp3**: "this song is a sad ghost because i barely remember how it goes when i'm not currently listening to it"

**VeganSquash**: "meh, a catchy chorus but the lyrics are forgettable"

**jelboo**: "This song could have used a very strict producer to clean it all up"

# Awhile2 Is Here To Learn Ya Up

**awhile2**: "“You guys are a bunch of idiots, Ghosting is when you've been texting with a guy for a long time, and things are going well, and you think that he's really into you. All of a sudden he just stops texting back because he finally saw what you look like. And so you just text him, you're like, 'Hey, sexy, where'd you go?' and he just doesn't answer because, see, he ghosted.""

# Standing on the Sun

**mokitsu**: "such an easy 10! bey pulled a baby boy 2.0 and did the dancehall/tropical (or is it reggaeton?) sound in a way that still sounds fresh. her delivery especially in the chorus makes it so evident she recorded it during 4 because those notes are high as heaven lol. such a banger."

**Leixander**: "The perfect feel-good summer song. Will probably not crack the top twenty, but I like it really much. Would do better without the... Mr.Vegas... (who?) I think."

**lassidoggy**: "I know this won’t win or make it past the first day, but this is a phenomenal song. Pop artists should look to this if they wanna do a caribbean pop song. Beyonce’s vocals are exceptionally strong in the pre-chorus and chorus, the reggae-rap is great, the beat is funky… it’s just a fun song and it instantly takes you to a summer-y place."

**jamesfog**: "Tropical bop"

# I Hope You Fall

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m astonishingly indifferent towards this track so I’m just gonna give it a six."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Maybe this sounded fresher back in 2014 but I'm kind of sick of anything tropical-sounding."

**dropthehammer11**: "Meh"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This needs Rihanna."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Yikes. This is terrible. I mean it could be worse. It could be like being a live stream and trying to do a screen share but you don’t know how to minimize a window to get to something that you are supposed to be showing off. ^^Y’all ^^Should ^^Go ^^Buy ^^Doom ^^Patrol ^^^Just ^^^Saying"

**throwaway963963963**: "Somebody fucking help I have to rate this song but I keep forgetting what it sounds like and I'm literally listening to it as I type. Fuck it, 5."

**tron94**: "Didn't age very well, feels like a 2006 reject."

# The Original Is Better

**cloudbustingmp3**: "tbh i'll be honest and admit this score is 100% because i'm bitter that she released this instead of the original studio version because that would've been her best pop song and my 11"
**Jackcs903**: "I prefer the solo version but this one’s still good!"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Meh. The original is much better and this is honestly quite annoying. It still bops tho, so..."

**skiddos**: "the original version of this is soooo much better"

**shrekinatohr**: "WHEN WE SAID WE WANTED THIS SONG, WE MEANT THE H&M VERSION, NOT THIS REMIX."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "what was the point of this? For real, why? Thanks to Sia, Detail, Andre Eric Proctor, Brian Soko [Anashe Music], Rasool Diaz and Greg Kurstin."

**huntyphobic**: "JUST RELEASE THE ORIGINAL VERSION BITCH"

**Itsafudgingstick**: "I actually love this song and I would've loved to see the H&M commercial developed into like a full fledged video for the album."

/endmassacre

In perhaps the loudest, most insane, craziest, absolutely bonkers, crashingly brilliant, wildest, eardrum piercingest song on ARTPOP Gaga sings about her alto ego when she high af. Gaga has aways been a queen of bridges (ive made a list of her best bridges) and here is no different. Also, the chanting in the chorus is pure bliss. rest in peace, love.

---
**MrSwearword**: "not aging well in the GAGAnthology but still batshit."

**Syfawx**: "I should listen to this more - it's really fun!"

**enecks**: "This is probably the biggest schism in taste between me and my past self listening to this for the first time. On the first time, I found the production to be an overbearing mess, and I hated the weed references. Now, I love the production as an unsubtle entertaining mess and admire how shameless it is."

**VeganSquash**: "prechorus > chorus. I really cant stand the chorus, but the bridge is amazing."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: ">[Mary](http://i.imgur.com/k9bfUBk.jpg) [Jane](http://i.imgur.com/LDOi53V.jpg) >~~Tom~~ [Holland](http://i.imgur.com/SKAxGCq.jpg) Oh don't forget to check out Spider-Man: Homecoming, in theaters July 7! MARYYYYYY JANEEEE HOLLANDDDDD!"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Remember that time when Gaga made a better drugs bop than your favs? Looking at you Sky, TOVE LO CAN’T TOUCH THIS."

**awryj**: "The beat is great and not overproduced imo. One of the catchiest choruses of the album."

**throwaway963963963**: "My brain just EXPLODES with endorphin at this song, it's such a fucking rush. But I must say, Glenda, is she talking about...the Devil's lettuce?"

**awhile2**: "fun fact: this song was inspired by our very own Popheads mod /u/eldrick"

**thenshecamelikeaaah**: "All I can think about is Mr Swearword's reactions as these songs all go out in the first day."

# I come from a good Christian family and we do not support marijuana.

**Jackcs903**: "Fun song but not really too memorable"

**justdancegottabeok**: "Honestly, the whole set-up of this song bothers me."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "The rest of this track is really standard like the rest of the album, but the bridge before the final chorus is really great."

**whatyourheartdesires**: "Too much is happening in the background"

**misstututulle**: "I've never really known what to think of MJH. On one hand, I enjoy it but on another, I feel rather indifferent to its lyrics and instrumental."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Shouldn’t a song about getting high and having a good time sound like a good time? This song is overloaded with a lot of unnecessary sound effects that render a wall of sound that’s difficult to listen to. Plus, drugs, Gaga? Those are illegal."

**wearingsox**: "I really like the pre-chrous, but the rest of this song flops. Endless Amsterdam references just in case anyone couldn’t tell this song was about weed."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I'm sure this album would be a lot better if I was into like, Drag Race and shut. But I'm not, so it's boring and annoying."

**zamomattel**: "THE BRIDGE IS ICONIC BUT THE REST OF THE SONG IS JUST NOT AS GOOD"

**superr_rad**: "nah"

**xanthalasajache**: "I HATE name songs and this one is a crime"

**stardustanddinos**: "Inconsistency again. It is SUCH an effort to listen to this song, the tempo and tone is so draggy."

# QUE HINOOOOOOO (aka comments that quote the song)

**OliverQueer**: "WONT BE A SLAVE TO THE BLONDE~~~"

**mokitsu**: "this sounds really good....MARY! JANE! HOLLAND! a bop....except for that bridge"

**henry413**: "The bridge of it is epic."

**dropthehammer11**: "This womans just said "I'm as rich as piss" what even"

**SkyBlade79**: "her shouting “russian hooker” always gives me chills for some reason"

I'm a five-star Michelin
A Kobe flown in

If you take your time
Eat with your hands, fine
I'm on the menu

Well, I'm open 24
Wanna keep you satisfied

Hope you've got some room
For the world's best cherry pie

Make her do a donut when she ride, aight
Looking at the eyes of a dime, make you blind
In her spine, and my diamonds change the climate

Whipped cream, no dairy
She got her hot light on screaming, "I'm ready!"
But no horses, no carriage

nnn

I think you all know I LOVE ARTPOP. Like, ARTPOP is my fav thing. So, when I say this song disrupts the flow of the album and probably shouldn't even be here, you know I mean it. As much as I absolutely adore this song, for its superb vocals Katy dreams of, for its amazing piano, and for its perfect buildup, it just isn't what the album needed. Furthermore, as hard hitting and fierce as the lyrics are, they are a little generic. Love Dope though, it just needs to be on a different album.

---
# Needs it more than Dope

**Elitefourbrad**: "The best song to play while studying for exams when you know you’re going to fail."

**MrSwearword**: "histrionic as fuck and I love it"

**OliverQueer**: "An iconic ballad!"

**Syfawx**: "Yeah I know everyone has a thing for this but I just can't take the word 'dope' seriously and I think Gaga has better sad songs."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "A left turn from the rest of the album, but a good one. Kinda really unexpected, but I like it."

**misstututulle**: "An iconic Top 8 hit, all thanks to Youtube ads. I love Dope, as I feel like it captures a nice moment on the album. After all the ecstasy and insanity that encapsulates much of ARTPOP, Dope comes to provide a slower and more meaningful take on Gaga's psyche at the time. After learning of the issues surrounding Gaga at the time, it feels like this song only gets better the more you listen."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this feels like speechless 2.0 and I love it, also remember that at that time everybody was wearing t-shirts/hats with dope in them? Also why is this after Mary Jane Holland, it’s weird. I don’t get the hate this song gets. It’s actually good, not like Joanne."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Gaga touched on a lot of styles on this album and so it’s no surprise that there’s a piano ballad on here, but this is a very nice one. The metaphor is simple, but powerful, and Gaga sounds great here. The production is tame and tasteful. Other than that, not much to say."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The song isn't bad bas what a lot of peopel say it is but I remember that time in the plug.dj where we watched the entire ARTPOP Ball and she was performing Dope. She kept talking during the performance and everyone in the chat including myself were like "GAGA PLEASE STOP TALKING" and the performance ended up being 9 minutes? Well, I am giving this song a bad score for the memes."

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "Now look, I love piano ballad, seriously, I am a slut for them. But holy shit this song is unbearable. I get how it’s super personal and heartfelt but holy shit it is a chore to listen to. I’m sorry Gaga but this song is just bad imo. And don’t even get me started on the almost 11 fucking minute version from the artRAVE: the ARTPOP ball concerts…. Or at least that recorded Paris one… I can usually deal with songs being stretched out but holy shit this is bad man."

**SkyBlade79**: "charting bop"

**musicotic**: "Nice ballad, but definitely inferior to Gypsy. Love the chorus and the lyrics. The high jumps are beautiful. And "sing with me bell bottom blue" is a great lyric. Over the length of the song, I changed it from an 8 to a 10 simply because of the "I need you more than dope""

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this is like a piano ballad but.. i don't know, it has a certain je ne sais quoi that sets it apart from other songs like it. but it kind of ruins the flow of the album. however the *emotion* in this, holy shit"

# Dope kills

**TheShineSoul**: "I understand having ballads but this one is so out of place. The song itself is good but it just doesn't flow well."

**enecks**: "With how messy the lyrics were in the album, what I needed least was a ballad. "I need you more than dope" was the most unintentionally hilarious line in the whole album for me."

**lady_sable**: "Honestly I want to give this a higher score bc it's a good song and shows off Gaga's vocal talent really well, but a downtempo piano ballad is super out of place in an album full of EDM bangers."

**thefighter987**: "Jesus Christ these vocals. I didn't get the hate for this song until I got to the wailing on the chorus."

**kappyko**: "certified: not dope at all"

Yass Beyonce coming in with that helping your mom through a rough marriage bop. I really love the message of this album though, its beautiful and tackles an issue rarely seen in songs. As much as it is let down in the production department, it is really a nice and touching song. <3

**Elitefourbrad**: "She was just telling people to put a ring on it but now she wants the ring off?"

**fifthchevron**: "Cruelly underrated, neglected track. Queen of supporting her mother thru an ugly divorce."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Haven’t actually heard this one before. It bangs. Quite a bit repetitive in the beat but I enjoy it."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Nice! Probably the best bonus track, it’s a tight, compact song with a story and a message, which is saying a lot for this album. Gets bonus points for referencing “Love On Top,” the best Beyoncé song."

**zamomattel**: "Cute bop for queen Tina"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of making an entire song about putting a ring on then making an entire song about taking a ring off"

**Magic_warlock0-**: "Nice little tropical feel to the song. Moving on from a rough marriage to a new life, it's very upbeat and positive! Just wishing it was a little more emotive, I don't get a lot of feeling from this song, personally. Still good, and I love the callback to Love on Top!"

# INTERNATIONAL SMILE

**Elitefourbrad**: "A pretty good song about diversity and inclusiveness. It’s not Katy’s best, but it’s one of the last good songs of the album left sadly."

**MrSwearword**: "considering the album, this is an internally flawless diamond surrounded by coal."

**enecks**: "Trying a bit too hard to be Teenage Dream, but at least it's trying unlike most of this album."

**mokitsu**: "this was the first deep cut from PRISM that i liked, it's kinda similar to TGIF in some ways and the lyrics are kinda wtf but it's such a bop omg!"

**VeganSquash**: "the chorus is great! this should have been a single like Legendary Lovers"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "International smile? More like i n t e r n a t i o n a l  b o p."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This should have been a single in my opinion. A song about celebrating women, Katy singing the praises of this magical mystery woman who has a smile that resonates around the world is so wholesome. I appreciate that she doesn’t really describe what the woman looks like, she just focuses on things like her attitude and her smile, things which are truly international. A great take on beauty. It would have been so easy to throw together a music video for this, just get a bunch of clips of women around the world smiling and dancing around, intercut some footage of Katy as a flight attendant, and there we go."

**thefighter987**: "catchy, but rides on the heels of Teenage Dream a bit too much for my taste. Saved by the cool vocoder bridge."

**throwaway963963963**: "I keep hearing "She's so into men" like omg I love this iconic straight anthem."

**Itsafudgingstick**: "This is one of my biggest problems with PRISM. Katy just did not arrange the tracklist properly. International Smile marks the end of a string of uptempo bops before we end up in a second half of more midtempo songs that kind of all sound the same."

**jamesfog**: "My wig has flown to Tokyo, Mexico AND Rio bitch!!!"

**a_rain_of_tears**: "this is the only 10 on prism, don't @ me"

# INTERNATIONAL ^frown

**gannade**: "this prechorus is SO BAD and the chorus is also terrible"

**Look_A_Fangirl**: "That girl is a real crowd pleaser. This song is not. This song was made of the assumption that if every other word rhymes it will be a bop, it is not."

**cyborglilith**: "what is this song even about"

**tron94**: "It played twice a day when I used to work at Toys 'R Us, I know every word to it, still hate it."

**amumumyspiritanimal**: "negative: this is basically a song to every basic chick flick movie positive: i fuckin love chick flick movies like i saw bridesmaids and how to be single like a hundred times. also her french is amazing, gaga who?"

# Time for some quick artistry

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "http://i.imgur.com/EjFEn1u.jpg (yes I spent about 30 minutes making this for the rate)"

# There is somehow two comments about pitbull????

**JohnnyToby**: "after the cancer that was this is trash it really brings a smile to my face also I swear there was a version with Pitbull"

**awhile2**: "[insert Mr worldwide meme]"

mokitsu: The mother of Blue, Sir and Rumi Carter.

The Grammys agree, Metacritic agrees and tour box office agrees.

Joebiekong: Gaga. Gaga. Gaga. Gaga. DONT WANT YOUR JEWELS DONT WANT YOUR DRUUUUUUUGS 

I feel so... Respected, as being the most delusional Gaga fan here!

deleted: Thank god Britney Jean wasn't a part of this Rate, that album is trash but I don't think I could take another rate of rabid Gaga/Bey stans trashing Britney like in the 2016 one.

/u/therokinrolla what time is Day 2 starting tomorrow? I'm gonna make an effort to wake up early to catch all of it, cause we just got rid of (most) of the trash/filler today. Day 2 and 3 is where it'll really start getting interesting.

Dracyoshi: I'm here late and these results are almost perfect; I'd just swap Swine with whatever position 7/11 is in tomorrow.

RIP Katy. Again. I can't wait for Witness to get rated so that she can get slaughtered a third time.
