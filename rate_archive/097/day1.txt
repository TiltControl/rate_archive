**worlds-okayest666** (5): This is just too cheesy for it’s own good. And WHY is lil aaron here??? ENOUGH LIL AARON! We did NOT need two whole features from him here!! I’m not upset with this going out first at ALL.

**hikkaru** (4): This song did not ONCE leave the bottom spot throughout the entire rating period and honestly it's what she deserves. For whatever reason Kim decided to collaborate with mediocre white rappers on three different Era 1 songs and this song is no exception to their overall mediocrity. Is it cute? Sure, but it's not cute in a good way. Good riddance!

---

#lil aaron stans

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this is one of her top songs don't @ me

**bandnitos** (8): THIS SONG GETS SO MUCH SHIT AND FOR WHAT??

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I actually like this. The feature is unnecessary but otherwise it's kind of a bop.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is cute but goes on a little too long

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): This song is one Chainsmokers remix away from being generic. This is a cute song though! I didn't expect this from Kim Petras tbh.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is a very teenagery song but it’s cute

**thoeoe** (7.5): feels a bit high school (lol) for me now closer to 30 than 25 but still very well done

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.4): I'm less into ballad-type songs, but Kim's voice works pretty well here. Good nostalgia vibes. [Woo-Ah: NONE]

**akanewasright** (7): I don’t feel bad about giving this song a decent score because no one but me likes it. The lyrics are dumb as rocks, but it’s a nice sentiment, and it feels bombastic as hell.

**andrxwzsz** (7): Legitimately super sweet

**lapascalia** (7): ironically the most forgettable song out of all the songs of this era. it’s not bad tho

**ManofOranges** (7): I'm hardly ever a stickler for lyrics but I think the lyrics here are a little stupid. They're also a little bit endearing to me though there's that. Anyways, I do like the song.

**quenched** (7): this is so overhated, i like this one. the lyrics are cute, albeit a tad cringe, and lil aaron works well with kim on this

**bbfan132** (6.5): a sweet 00s teen pop throwback track but lil aaron wasn’t needed here

**Bendariaku89** (6.5): I like the harmonization, and the chorus is nice to listen to. But I don’t like this song as well as other songs. It’s also way too long.

**Misentro** (6.5): I hated this when it first came out and I was ready to give it a 3 and move on, but I actually liked it a lot more on second listen. It's slow and lacks energy, but their voices combine really well and I kind of like this softer side to Kim.

**Stryxen** (6.5): I started hating this but then it got better

**racloves** (6): is cute
[/r/popheads/comments/hx5s05/2017_electropopflops_rate_reveal_day_1_the/fz44g96/]

=====

worlds-okayest666: #You never let me copy your homework 😡

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (6.5): Chile why is this so long?

**pigserpent** (6): I can't think of many songs that tackle alcoholism and cheating on homework in the same song, and that's because it was not a very good decision, leading to a song that's both overdramatic and drab. Ignoring that, the melodies are all pretty nice and it's enough to make the song enjoyable.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): it’s ok but basic, Lil Aaron does nothing for me

**vayyiqra** (6): Kim you are 27 years old you are too old for homework surely unless you are a mature student maybe which is fine

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): This song reminds me of Melanie Martinez.

**ggodisawomann** (5): not bad but I just don't care about this

**Hielord** (5): we did forget about this song gurl

**waluigiest** (5): it’s cute and different for her but it’s so boring lol

**nightjesus** (4.5): it’s just really average? And super slow. Kim sounds good vocally but that’s all I like tbh.

**bulforster** (4): This isn't the worst thing ever like it seems to be by reputation but it's definitely not good.

**MRACHNIE** (4): This isn't even bad in an interesting way, it's just kinda boring. When I saw the title, i expected an entertaining mess, but this is just kinda... there?

**rickikardashian** (4): this is an emotional ballad from a high school musical rip-off

**untutorable** (4): could've been cute but some of the lyrics about getting paper and counting stacks... they kill the vibe completely

**mayolizard** (3.5): why is this so fucking long???

**pat-rickstar** (3.5): Kind of cringey lyrics IMO

**alwayswords** (3): boring and lil aaron :nauseated_face:

**anothertown** (3): hate this

**SkyBlade79** (3): this is lame as hell lol

**1998tweety** (2): This was painful to listen to but Kim's belts at the end saved it a bit.

**bespectacIed** (1): I hate this so much, it sounds like a soundtrack to an awful, early 2000s direct-to-video teen flick

**ariiaaaa** (0): i legit skip this song every time spotify gives it to me, I hate it (I have listened to it in full before btw)

**skargardin** (0): I really hate it here

**twat\_brained** (0): I hate giving zeroes in a rate but there's just nothing in this song that's as compelling as the others here, especially not Kim's early 2018 songs.

**yatcho** (0): This never needed to come out

**worlds-okayest666** (8): Similar to Faded, I love this one and I don’t know why. It’s just very vibey and I dig it. A cute lil’ moment. It’s also similar to Faded in that I wish the feature wasn’t here!

**hikkaru** (3): My personal least favourite from Era 1, it leaves nothing in my memory other than vague unpleasant feelings from the last time I listened to it. I think I would have had this below Homework even, but it ends up getting an average score about 1.2 higher than the first boot. Both are not great so I'm fine with it.

---

#I gotchaaaa

**AceSHF** (10): The pre-chorus on this one is sooo catchy.

**bandnitos** (10): THIS IS A BANGER IDGAF

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): Out of every song in this album, THIS is the song I did not expect to like as much as I do on my first listen. I don’t like trap, but this is undercut with some tropical vibes enough that it doesn’t bother me at all. Hills is the song I listened to on repeat when I first discovered this album, and I still think I could do that. I don’t listen to Kim nowadays, but this is the one I loved way back then.

**alwayswords** (8.3): this song better not be done dirty

**ggodisawomann** (8): pop one in da hillssss

**lapascalia** (8): for some reason I feel like she really sounds like charli in parts of this song

**pigserpent** (8): A good mix of chill and lively. Baby E's verse is pretty fire too.

**thoeoe** (8): I super duper love her diction and pace in the first verse. The feature fells totally appropriate here as well and he follows with a similar cadence as Kim on the first verse.

**twat\_brained** (8): DO IT OVER AGAIIIIIIIIIIIN :kimbryell:

**waluigiest** (8): Tove Lo wants to know your location

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): This is the first Kim Petras song I ever heard and it still kinda slaps. Eazy E is kinda bad but kinda really good at the same time idk why

**bbfan132** (7): vibe-y track that i’d enjoy playing in the background

**skargardin** (7): bop

=====

worlds-okayest666: #the weeknd >

**rickikardashian** (7.5): the inferior Hill song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): I really like the melody Kim sings on chorus, but the instrumental just feels too minimal to me

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a bop but The Weeknd did the better song about drugs and hills. Or at least I assume it was about drugs, because every song by The Weeknd is in some way.

**1998tweety** (6.5): Delete Baby E, the rest is ok.

**anothertown** (6.5): SMOKED OUT IN THE BACK OF A BIG BLACK TRUUUUUCK

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I was digging the production but it just feels lacking still. I want to like it more than I do

**andrxwzsz** (6): Fun chorus but one of the lesser Era 1 singles like Faded, though better (her drug songs are usually less enthusiastic but I guess that fits lol)

**bright\_baby\_blue** (6): [Woo-Ah: None]

**quenched** (6): the worst era 1 song, but it’s still cute

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): meh it’s not Hillside Boys

**bespectacIed** (5): kim vs never hiring a black rapper. That guest verse is so bad, disgustingly bad, enough to merit this a 0. But damn it the chorus is fucking HEAVENLY. Easily my favorite chorus of "Era 1". Damn it why did the rap bridge have to ruin this

**nightjesus** (5): Eh.

**shesdoingyoga** (5): I’m just not a fan of this one, something about the tempo and the way she repeats certain melodies just make it super boring

**untutorable** (5): p bland and i hate the rap tbh

**Hielord** (4): we get it Kim, you did drugs for the first time, congratulations

**Stryxen** (4): it’s a no from me (except I like the bridge a lot)

**ariiaaaa** (3.9): the acoustic version is so much better, this is just sad

**akanewasright** (3): The weakest bop on the album. It grew on me, but the hook isn’t her best, and Baby-E SUCKS on his verse.

**MRACHNIE** (1.5): No one involved in this song sounds like they know what a weed is.

#No thank you! <3

**fluviusfluit** (6): No I don't want to pop one in the hills

**ManofOranges** (6): I do not want to pop one in the hills but I fwu for asking.

=====

akanewasright: Kim has this problem where her money kind of is part of her identity now? Like, I think she brought up her ice and her cash and everything on every track of Clarity, and that was her “super personal and authentic” album. I was fine with it for most of era 1, since it was basically wish fulfillment for most of the track list, but like... when she brags about counting stacks in the bridge of a sweet love song (?), we should have known what was coming. 

Anyway, I typed this as a reply to the Homework post, but I wanted it to actually get seen

---

**worlds-okayest666** (8): I love this one but I don’t know why...it just bops! The chorus always gets me grooving. Could do without the feature, tho...I could do without lil aaron on most songs tbh.

**hikkaru** (6.5): I kinda like the production and vibe of this tbh, but the moment whoever tf this white rapper is comes in I lose interest. It's not as bad as a couple of the other songs from Era 1, but it's nothing to write home about really. I definitely see why it's bottom 3 here, and I have no complaints about it.

---

#lil aaron stans [2]

**bespectacIed** (10): I am ashamed, this is my favorite Petrat song. It's so catchy and chill, i fucking love it. The "i stay faded every ni-i-i-i-i-ight" part make me ascend. I wish kim didn't collab with only white rappers

**cremeebrulee** (10): i havent listened to any of kim's loosies so this was an unexpected surprise-- its so catchy and fun

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): The fact that she sings "rough" like a puppy barking is really damn cute

**Hielord** (9.2): I don't know why I love this song so much, it was a contender for my 11. The way she sings ni-i-i-i-ght, it gets me

**AceSHF** (9): Love the vocal chopping

**skargardin** (9): bop!!

**thoeoe** (9): I'm such a sucker for everything going on with her pronunciation in this song, also the chopped up chorus, also just the instrumentation. Also hey major label artists, this is how you do a rap feature without it being trash.

**bulforster** (8.5): Bad pop-rap verses on hyperpop songs like this are charmingly nostalgic to me.

**quenched** (8): definitely the superior lil aaron collab

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a fun bop!

**waluigiest** (8): song is good vibes (and nothing else) for 4 minutes straight

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.5): The autotune in this song is pretty excessive, but I always feel happier after listening to it. Lil Aaron's verse works really well here, imo. [Woo-Ah: 8/10]

**lapascalia** (7.5): not crazy about lil aaron’s verse, but it’s a cute song overall

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): these ad libs really make the song lmfao. I love them so much but the chorus is kinda weak

**untutorable** (7.5): leagues ahead of homework it's not even funny

**Stryxen** (7): my favourite part is when she stops singing words and just goes “stayfaded aheaywahaualhahah woo ah!”

worlds-okayest666: #enough random white rappers i beg

**twat\_brained** (7.4): eh, I won't skip this if it comes on but when Kim sets such a high bar for pop it's hard to see this as anything but a step down

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.2): no more lil Aaron please...

**bandnitos** (7): kinda boring but its kinda a bop

**pigserpent** (7): This song has a pretty neat bounce to it. I don't think Kim is doing much to elevate the song.

**Bendariaku89** (6.5): Too repetitive in my opinion to be good, but it’s enjoyable enough to listen. Just in small doses though. I wish the verses were explored more than the back and forth repetition.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): slightly better than the other Lil Aaron song

**1998tweety** (6): Production is good but the rest is awful.

**bbfan132** (6): she has some of the best pop songs of 2017/2018 and then this basic track with a random rapper lmao - she’s good enough here that i can’t dislike it or even give it a 5

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Eh. This was released as a single? This felt more like a deep-cut and it’s kinda forgettable tbh.

**hunnybee12** (6): the chorus gets annoying real fast

**nightjesus** (6): This is a big improvement from the last lil aaron feature. But still not amazing.

**shesdoingyoga** (6): Her vocals on this one are grating in parts

**mayolizard** (5.5): who the fuck is lil aaron

**alwayswords** (5): lil aaron :icannotsee:

**andrxwzsz** (5): Annoying vocal performance/chorus/feature/everything lowkey but I still enjoy it when listening to all the Era 1 songs

**ggodisawomann** (5): this is alright

**ManofOranges** (5): I'm fading out!

**akanewasright** (4): This song’s lyrics are trash, and the hook is basically just found in the production. While the production is stellar, I’m not giving a song a good score because Luke was good on it.

**ariiaaaa** (3.9): I don't remember this song??? at all??? w h a t

**MRACHNIE** (3.5): This is the entertaining mess Homework wishes it was. The fact it's more entertaining does not, however, make it better. The completely incoherent enunciation, the chopped up chorus, the autotune, the fact that the rap verse is actually one of the better parts of the song...

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): weed bad

**ignitethephoenix** (0): wow you smoke weed, u r so cool

**Solovrinne** (0): This will forever be her worst song, sorry not sorry. Sticks out like a sore thumb in her immaculate discography, the chorus is just insufferable to me and lil aaron is not it

---

**hikkaru** (6.5): Here we see Tove try some more contemporary trap-pop stylings as opposed to the bombastic electropop of the rest of the album. It even has a male rap feature to boot. This is one of the weaker songs on the album imo and it seems y'all agree with that. While most of Blue Lips saw Tove eschew current trends (releasing Disco Tits as the lead single was a bold move if she wanted her prior success back), this stuck to them but unfortunately it does not stick the landing of quality.

**worlds-okayest666** (6): Meh. This is cute but it doesn’t really do anything for me, and the feature adds nothing. Not upset at this going out so early.

#trap-pop stans

**bespectacIed** (9): oh wow

**1998tweety** (8.5): Good production

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Daye Jack kinda eats this one up.

**lapascalia** (8): it’s kind of a darker new romantics

**vayyiqra** (8): chill lo-fi beats to study and relax to

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): love how popheads doesn’t like trap music but most will like this song to some extent

**quenched** (7.5): i like the drop a lot on this, and the feature surprisingly worked well with tove

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I hate calling things generic but this one feels the most generic out of the whole album, which isn’t good when the rest of the songs feel like they’re actually Tove Lo songs

worlds-okayest666: #New Romantics >

**bandnitos** (6): this sounds dated

**iloveneonlights** (6): - I don't like the duet

**ManofOranges** (6): It's a meh from me! I don't love it as much as the other songs. In fact, I think this is the weakest song on the album.

**nightjesus** (6): It’s okay but it’s kinda just turned into background noise for me.

**thoeoe** (6): A bit too repetitive honestly, but it's still a pretty song.

**waluigiest** (6): go wild with our scars unhealed UwU

**yatcho** (6): She needs to stop getting these nobody men on her songs they never add to them

**twat\_brained** (5.8): trap and Tove don't mix well. nor does Daye's Lil Yachty style flow

**SkyBlade79** (5.5): the production is cool but the clown ass rapper makes this an instant skip when I listen to this album lol

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): WHY wasn't daye jack credited on this form? just more evidence of this subreddit's misandry smh.

**alwayswords** (5): the man erm

**anothertown** (5): sounds like 50 shade soundtrack reject

**bbfan132** (5): that drop is so lazy lol, really boring filler track and the guy added nothing of note to the song

**ggodisawomann** (5): this is aight

**Hielord** (5): There are probably more than 50 EDM songs that sound exactly like this

**pigserpent** (5): This could be good but it comes across as anemic and like there's no force behind it.

**skargardin** (4): this feature is the most forgettable part of the album

**Bendariaku89** (3.5): I used to like this song, but the trap breakdown just puts me off this song entirely now. It has some nice bits, like the hook but not enough to make me like it. Give me a real chorus please.

**ariiaaaa** (2.5): rap + feature is just not what I'm here for, but the instrumental is solid

**MRACHNIE** (2): This is a song that definitely exists. I'm pretty sure it has an instrumental. It has some lyrics, too, probably. Extra points knocked off for being tropical house.

**Awkward\_King** (0): the song just sounds,, i wish i had the technical term it just really doesn't work for me like it's just bad

#autotune is really fun

**andrxwzsz** (7): Autotune IS really fun

**racloves** (7): no shade but this song would be better without the feature, like why is this dude here it doesn’t really add anything, but the ‘auto tune is really fun’ line at the end does crack me up

**Stryxen** (7): I enjoy this song and áútótúné ís réálly fún

**akanewasright** (6): “autotune is really fun”

**hikkaru** (9): I actually really like this despite its low placement. Sure, it would probably be even better if it at some point got a bit more bombastic (perhaps some drums would help instead of that weak lil percussion that comes in after the first chorus.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): I really don’t think I’d like this one as much if anyone else sang it. It’s honestly kinda boring, and I can’t complain about it going out so early, but I feel like something about Tove’s voice saves it from being a flop, and actually makes it pretty damn good. That being said, I REALLY wish the instrumental actually went somewhere. Surely they could have thrown in a late-game switchup or something?

---

#do ask. DO tell!

**thoeoe** (9.5): Honestly this is always a debate I have when I see someone new, I'm a pretty chatty person about my past and I've been in a (short-lived) non-monogomous relationship before where we talked about our dates with other people, but I know other people have boundaries like that? idk I wanna actually KNOW you.

**AceSHF** (9): Great writing, catchy melody and the vocals to go along with it. Although it does have an awkward placing in the track listing and slows down the momentum.

**Stryxen** (9): her best songs are when she says “baby” like that

**skargardin** (8): her tone on the chorus :mm:

#i sleep

**twat\_brained** (7.6): since this references an anti-LGBTQ+ law I'm guessing it's a song about wlw adultery?

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): It’s pretty good but suffers from being the most subdued song in the first half, especially when the other 5 in this half are just amazing

**ManofOranges** (7): A little less enthralling than several other tracks on this album but I do not hate it in any capacity. It's just that in an album full of 10s, anything less feels a little disappointing.

**quenched** (7): i mean it was good but could’ve been a lot better. it just...didn’t really go anywhere

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): I don’t really like her voice on this :( but it gets better as it goes on, lyrics good

**vayyiqra** (7): Um like I thought this was repealed under the Obama adminstration which was a victory for LGBT rights in the United States and I feel weird about liking this song if it's homophobic???

**1998tweety** (6.5): I'm bored, I wanted an explosion at the end.

**bbfan132** (6.5): i wanted to enjoy this but it kept on building up to nothing and ended abruptly so i can’t give it a higher score, unfortunately

**andrxwzsz** (6): The true shame about this album but it's still cute

**anothertown** (6): Yes Miss Bill Clinton 1994

**bandnitos** (6): eh

**bespectacIed** (6): amazing vocals from tove as per ush but this song was BEGGING for a good drop

**lapascalia** (6): it’s not a bad song, but i feel like it doesn’t really go anywhere

**SkyBlade79** (6): I’m sorry tove but I just don’t think you’re a “ballad” artist. This is just mid

**Bendariaku89** (5): A song I want to like more than I do. It might be the vocal performance, but there’s something off about it that I wish was different. Not one I would listen for more than once. The bridge is amazing though, no denying.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Weak, especially after the light beams -> shivering gold streak.

**nightjesus** (5): I dunno. I’m just not vibing that much with it?

**waluigiest** (5): it just doesn’t give enough at any point

**Hielord** (4.8): It may not be the weakest song of Blue Lips, but it's such a downgrade from the first three songs of the album.

**MRACHNIE** (4.5): Maybe if this song actually was about the controversial US military policy it would be more memorable.

**bulforster** (4): I feel like this should build to something but it just... doesn't really.

**pigserpent** (4): some nice melodies but overall pretty boring

**alwayswords** (3.5): the thing tove does with her voice in the chorus bothers me

**mudkip1** (1): the quality of this album really dropped off quick huh

**worlds-okayest666** (10): This is a bit of an unpopular opinion, but I LOVE this song. Such a beautiful down-tempo moment and I will never understand the hate it gets. This should made day 2 (even if it would have been one of the first cuts)...

**hikkaru** (5): This song in one word is forgetable. It seems a lot of y'all agree with that as it's Allie's first song out, though it narrowly avoids being in the bottom 5. For something that's the third song on the album, it's really uninteresting and it should be very thankful that mega banger Casanova follows it in the tracklist!

---

#Valley Girl stans

**bandnitos** (10): crying in the club

**iloveneonlights** (10): - Such an underrated sad bop of a song

**nightjesus** (10): A few years ago there was a post about Allie X ‘disappearing’ just before Focus came out. I quoted the opening of this song as a joke and someone dead ass thought I knew Allie X from that lyric. I mean I wish I did but sweeettieee how do you not know this song? Anywho one of her best. Amazing collab.

**akanewasright** (9): Yeah, I can see this song going out on day one. But I think it a nice song. I don’t really have much to say about it, but it’s just a really comforting song for some reason.

**hunnybee12** (9): the vocoder chorus is really nice

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): such a pretty sad song

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): A surprisingly chill little bop that really just feels nice

**1998tweety** (8): It's kinda cute but feels empty

**andrxwzsz** (8): Love moody, chill, overly autotuned pop like this when done well

**bbfan132** (8): really enjoyed the subdued vocals here, the dreamier sound here is a welcome change in sound

**bulforster** (8): I don't love how slurred the Valley Girl guy's verse is but other than that the song has a good vibe.

**lapascalia** (8): the use of vocoder really works

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a really nice and emotional song and it's a ballad so it will be underrated because it's not a Certified Bop and the next song is.

**ariiaaaa** (7): I really love the vocoder and the synth on this one. reminds me of Sister by The Japanese House, the feature isn't too bad (I usually hate features)

**thoeoe** (7): I have called myself "balladphobic" before but you know what, I fucks with this. Give me all that vocal processing and appropriate use of a fade-out.

worlds-okayest666: #Unneeded

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Eh. This is alright but I don’t think this has replay value to me.

**Bendariaku89** (6.5): Boring but listenable.

**geraldinewww** (6.5): i honestly forget this song is on the album. it's fine but just feels like nothing to me

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): cute but it feels like it could have more

**Stryxen** (6.5): very chill and they have a nice chemistry but it’s really nothing special

**skargardin** (6): the hook is cute

**twat\_brained** (6): i was confused why a male voice called Valley Girl was singing so I had to look it up on Genius to make sure I wasn't offending trans raters. It wouldn't affect me if I never heard another of their songs again

**anothertown** (5.5): hey

**quenched** (5.5): i liked the feature in this but this one was still kinda boring. the beat got a tad annoying / grating

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is like so totally not for me.

**mayolizard** (5): no strong thoughts

**MRACHNIE** (4.5): 4.5 This is a song that definitely exists. I'm pretty sure it has an instrumental. It has some lyrics, too, probably. The vocoder on the male singer's voice is extremely grating.

**plastichaxan** (4): gia_gunn_iwassobored.jpg

**waluigiest** (4): being wedged between the two best songs on the album doesn’t help this little track

**pigserpent** (3): For a song that seems built to emphasize interesting harmonies, it sure lacks interesting harmonies.

**racloves** (3): boring

**SkyBlade79** (3): this is almost painful to listen to ngl

**n7cn7c** (1): baby no

**worlds-okayest666** (10): This is a BANGER and i’m shocked at how hard it flopped. What Melanie Martinez thinks she’s doing.

**hikkaru** (8): This song is pretty interesting, it sounds creepy in its synth work yet is still a bop. Felonie Martinez wishes!	It's sad that it is getting the chop so early because I prefer it over quite a few of the other tracks on CollXtion II, but alas.

---

#Simon Says this is a bop

**Misentro** (10): The SYNTHS in that CHORUS my GOD. It manages to sound vulnerable and sinister at the same time.

**n7cn7c** (10): pop perfection.

**skargardin** (10): huge bop, dare i say underrated af and one of the best songs on the album..

**mayolizard** (9.5): megan thee stallion collab when

**andrxwzsz** (9): Bitch's drugged-out intervention

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): very Melanie Martinez teas with the dark meaning hidden under childish themes, I’d rather listen to Allie any day tho

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I hate to say this but it kind of sounds like an elevated Melanie Martinez song

**1998tweety** (8): That little instrumental bit is a little annoying but the rest is good

**anothertown** (8): and what about Alvin and Theodore hmmmmt?

**bandnitos** (8): how did they make that wiggly noise

**lapascalia** (8): sounds spooky but I like it

**ManofOranges** (8): A teensy bit too lowkey for me but I still like it.

**quenched** (8): this slaps, tho this is gonna go out early i fear

**SkyBlade79** (8): everyone else is going to say this but it sounds like she’s just trying to be Melanie Martinez. The bridge on this one is very good tho.

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.7): The prechorus here is pretty epic. The rest of the song is kind of lackluster imo, but I enjoy the vaguely unsettling atmosphere.

**bbfan132** (7.5): i have nothing interesting to say, this was a good track but nothing outstanding

**rickikardashian** (7): this reminds me of electra heart marina

**vayyiqra** (7): Allie is good at writing songs with creepy and disturbing lyrics and this is one of them. This is the successor to "Bitch" from CollXtionI (which is also a great album please listen to it too).

**yatcho** (7): nice synths at the end

**hikkaru** (6): This is probably the most forgettable song on the mixtape for me personally. Seemingly, most of the people that did the rate agree, as it's Charli's first song out. She's the last artist to lose a single song though, so good for her!

**akanewasright** (9.5): I adore this song. It was a grower, but like all songs written with Noonie Bao, it’s fucking fantastic and has great lyrics.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): If the color “white” was a song, it would be White Roses.

**n7cn7c** (9): oh shes emotional i love 2 see it

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Something about this song very loosely reminds me of White Winter Hymnal, and I’m pretty sure it’s just the use of the word “snow”

**worlds-okayest666** (8): I’m surprised at how poorly this did! It’s nothing special, but it’s still a cute bop (although it takes a bit too long to pick up). Also, that chorus is REALLY catchy...I always find it stuck in my head after I listen to N1A.

**hikkaru** (7.5): Charli sure does like to put the blame on others and/or their love. This is one of the less interesting cuts from the mixtape in my opinion, and it's not difficult to see why it's gone on day 1.

#Blame it on the blame it on the blame it on the juice

**bandnitos** (10): the ending makes it a 10

**n7cn7c** (10): YERRRR

**pigserpent** (10): I can't deside what stands out more, Charli's great hook or the candied synths that make my soul want to leave my body so it can express itself through dance. Or the ending where the song errupts into a pure state of bliss.

**fluviusfluit** (9.5): I listen to this one when I need to pretend other people are at blame for my problems huehehue

**ManofOranges** (9): This song starts off real slow for me, a little too slow/boring for me to give it a 10 but by the end it goes all the way there and sounds amazing.

**bbfan132** (8): probably the blandest song on n1a but it’s still a great track so…

**1998tweety** (7): This was so bare-bones until it ascended to a massive bop in the last minute, oh well.

**skargardin** (7): EVERY LIE YOU TELL COMES TRUE

**SkyBlade79** (7): it’s kinda good but it sounds kinda exactly like Dreamer lmfao

**Stryxen** (7): its good but the chorus draaaaaaags

**geraldinewww** (6.5): it's fine but every time i hear it i just wish i was listening to track 10

**MRACHNIE** (6.5): This is a song that definitely exists. I'm pretty sure it has an instrumental. It has some lyrics, too, probably. The song does get more interesting towards the end tho, so if you're willing to make it through a few minutes of complete snoozefest for a bombastic climax, this is the song for you.

**andrxwzsz** (6): Kinda forgettable (still not bad at all though)

**Misentro** (6): This song isn't bad, but it takes a long time to get where it's going.

**nightjesus** (6): I was really vibing with it but the second chorus heavy synth kinda ruined it. And then that other heavy bass synth also kinda killed it for me. Up until that point I was groovin.

**quenched** (6): the beat switch at the final chorus / the final minute saved the song

**vayyiqra** (6): filler

**waluigiest** (6): the chorus sucks. But the verses are good and the last minute of the song smacks tbh

**bulforster** (5): That drop thing at the end comes right out of nowhere and doesn't fit. Also one of the few songs where Charli's repetitiveness becomes a drag for me.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Meh. The bridge is the only noteworthy part.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): her fast talking part is questionable...also why does Charli always have the same topics in each song please we get it you blame it ok x

**akanewasright** (4): Bad boy make a bad girl saves this song. Otherwise this is one of Charli’s most boring songs ever.

**ariiaaaa** (3.5): I can appreciate the vocal performance as an intentional choice here but that doesn't mean I'm a huge fan of it

**Bendariaku89** (2.5): I checked the time to see how long I’ve been listening, and I realized I was only halfway, and I dreaded listening to more. It got slightly better but not by much.

**bespectacIed** (2): Gorgeous chorus, awful "rapping" from charli

**astrologicalangel** (0): the chorus and bridge both fall flat, on top of being too repetitive

vayyiqra: ironically i was put under "track 10 supremacists" when my very spicy take is that track 10 is overrated; and this is a lot better than i remembered so i wish i had rated it higher than i did (6)

her singing on it is kind of bad but the instrumental track is good and has some nice ambience it's really not a bad song

pig-serpent: I wasn't put as a "track 10 supremacists" even though I very much am one, so we can trade in spirit.

To me this song has always been a standout so I'm really surprised to see that most people don't like this one.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): Another one I don’t get the hate for! I really love her vocals on songs like this, I think it really gives them a chance to shine. And this is the song that “woo-ah” spawned from, so like...it’s automatically iconic (and I will NOT stand for y’all slandering the usage of it in the chorus!! You wouldn’t even HAVE it without this song so be grateful!!)

**hikkaru** (5): The woo-ah anthem to end all other woo-ahs, this song gets the chop on day 1. The three songs that Kim dropped to close out Era 1 are all pretty disappointing in my opinion and it's easy to see why she just wanted to get them all out and move on to something else, as it is easy to see why this is out early on in the rate!

---

#WOO-AH

**bandnitos** (11): GOD I FELT THIS

**sandyfishnets** (11): WOO-AH! this song is perfect.

**ariiaaaa** (10): I vividly remember having a rough day and walking through the city to this song and feeling??? so emotional??? the emotional delivery here is??? amazing??? iconic??? yes

**iloveneonlights** (10): - Her most earnest song out there

**Misentro** (10): Peak. Petras. The "You-ahh!" is just so clever no matter how many times I hear it. It's powerful but with a big wink the whole way through. Standout moments are the gasp for breath before the second verse and the explosive ending.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i love the abundance of woo-ahs in this one

**quenched** (10): for some reason i feel like i remember people weren’t crazy about this one, but it’s one of my favorites from era 1. the woo ah being such a huge part of the chorus is so fun and i hope she does something like this again with making the woo ah a big element of the song

**akanewasright** (9): I adore this song. No one else really seems to like it much, but I just think it’s just a really cool bop.

**ManofOranges** (9): This is another stand out to me. Maybe because I also think about if the guy that I know doesn't think about me thinks about me.

**lapascalia** (8.5): so cute (woo-ah)

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): My favorite part is how she turns woo-ah into you-ah, it’s cute

**thoeoe** (8.5): Super duper relatable for us anxious boys. relevant xkcd https://xkcd.com/372/

**AceSHF** (8): This one is pretty nice. I do wish the bridge was a bit more interesting though.

**alwayswords** (8): underrated gem

**andrxwzsz** (8): My fav Kim song probably - super theatrical but pure pop

**Stryxen** (8): hmmm many thoughts

**bbfan132** (7.5): chorus is anticlimactic but ’twas good

**fluviusfluit** (7.5): "Time is money, time is money" it truly is when streaming this gave Luke coins

**untutorable** (7.5): VERY underrated imo!

**nightjesus** (7): WOO AHH

**vayyiqra** (7): WOO-AH

**waluigiest** (7): WOO-AH

**mayolizard** (6.5): you-ah

**racloves** (6): woo ah anthem

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): woo ah pog

worlds-okayest666: #woo-nah

**twat\_brained** (7.1): woo-ah works as a cute Easter egg or artist tag in a few songs here and there. building an entire chorus around it isn't what Kim should be doing with it

**Bendariaku89** (7): I like the ideas and it’s very listenable. I don’t hate it, but it’s lacking.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): what is this bridge girl...made the song worse sadly

**MRACHNIE** (5.5): This is a song that definitely exists. I'm pretty sure it has an instrumental. It has some lyrics, too, probably.

**bright\_baby\_blue** (5): [Woo-Ahs: 5/10]

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (5): she’s has way too many of this basic ass songs is her discography

**anothertown** (4): like what is this

**ggodisawomann** (4): sleep

**SkyBlade79** (4): iono how I feel about “YOU-AH”. It’s better when it’s just once per song

**pigserpent** (3): The percussion on this track sounds pretty cool, and uh...It exists?

**skargardin** (3): this just goes .. nowhere

**1998tweety** (2): Meh, Kim is very shrieky on this. Also idk what was up with that random minute of nothing. Woo-ahs were overused too.

worlds-okayest666: #balladphobic

**bandnitos** (7): it works only as a closer to an album and doesn't really work any other way

**racloves** (7): it’s beautiful sounding but i feel like I have to be in the right kind of mood to listen to it, like if it came up on shuffle I would probably skip it

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I like this as the closing song, but it’s kind of underwhelming after the rest

**anothertown** (6): Sis needs to read the “Stirring the Oatmeal” theory of relationships

**bbfan132** (6): already don’t remember this

**Bendariaku89** (6): I’m not bored, but it ain’t special.

**ManofOranges** (6): I've never had true love before so I can't really speak to whether it's violent or not but judging by this song maybe it's a little boring at times.

**SkyBlade79** (6): forgettable

**bulforster** (5.5): Does the chorus' melody interpolate something? It's distractingly familiar.

**skargardin** (5): one of the few allie x's tracks i'd deem.. forgettable. She's got far better ballads

**pigserpent** (4): Pretty standard piano ballad that doesn't really make me feel anything, but some chord changes hit really hard while vocals in some section have too sharp of an edge and are borderline unlistenable.

**ariiaaaa** (3.9): this completely didn't even register to me as a new track when I was listening to it

**akanewasright** (3): I like ballads, but this is phoned in. Every cliche in the book is here, and the chorus literally takes a melody from Viva La Vida.

**bespectacIed** (1): no more piano ballads, society has progressed past the need for piano ballads

**geraldinewww** (0): i hate this song. i hate the tune. i hate the lyrics. i HATE the sentiment. allie why did you put this shit on the album and left off All The Rage???

**worlds-okayest666** (10): This did NOT deserve to go out day 1...such a banger and I will never get the hate. It’s messy, yes, but it’s so fun that I can overlook it’s flaws. I do wish Dr L*ke didn’t get his grubby hands on it, though...

**hikkaru** (7): A collaboration between two trailblazers in the realm of trans pop artists sounded like a dream, especially combining Kim's bratty bubblegum with SOPHIE's penchant for bright and bubbly pop productions (RIP XCX World), but this just does not hit the mark. It just sounds like very very watered down SOPHIE, and I wish it used both artists to their full potential. Clearly y'all agree with me as this ended up performing mediocrely here and is gone on day 1.

---

#deserved to make day(z) 3

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Literally everything SOPHIE does is perfect, now with unnecessary input by L*ke.

**plastichaxan** (10): the level of talent far too much

**sandyfishnets** (10): THIS SONG IS A BOP

**twat\_brained** (10): trans icons being trans icons, I expect nothing less

**anothertown** (9.5): Trap-A-Holics should have been given a writing credit

**ariiaaaa** (9.1): im also a SOPHIE stan so y'know, also "I wanna party with Jesus?" ICONIC

**nightjesus** (9): There is just something about SOPHIE’s production that is just so iconic and addictive. Put Kim Petras in there, you got a bop.

**pigserpent** (9): Very unlike SOPHIE so this song gets a bad rap, but when you get over your original disappointment you're left with an all time tropical house classic.

**rickikardashian** (9): the way i screamed when i first heard the “damn son where’d you this” sample

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): This song is far from bad, but it certainly feels lacking considering the SOPHIE feature

**quenched** (8.5): ok i lowkey think this is closer to a 10 than what i gave, it’s a bop, but i have to dock some points because a kim x sophie collab could’ve been SO MUCH MORE than what we got. i want them to collab again and come out with an experimental banger and not a safe pop song. also obligatory I WANNA PARTY WITH JESUSSSSS

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Sophie good

**bandnitos** (8): dr luke held sophie back

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Kim Petras sounded like Charli here and the fact SOPHIE worked on this solidified that. This song would have been a 9 if there was some kind of progression in the song.

**lapascalia** (8): other than that ‘I wanna party with jesus’ line it’s good

**MRACHNIE** (8): While not a bad song by any means, this might as well not be a SOPHIE feat. at all. That is to be expected, as SOPHIE tends to not go very hard in her pop work (see: 24HRS by ITZY).

**racloves** (8): forget jesus I wanna party with Kim

**vayyiqra** (8): We can't stop we won't stop

**skargardin** (7): banger

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Catchy but I want more on the production from a SOPHIE song.

**andrxwzsz** (7): I wanna party with Jesus one of the best lyrics ever

**bbfan132** (7): i love sophie but this song is mixed oddly and the pacing is a bit too slow for a song like this - still good though

**ggodisawomann** (7): annoying but I still like it. I blame Sophie

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I feel like I want to rate this slightly higher but it’s really just alright to me, like its good but nothing really stands out

**1998tweety** (7): It was ok and then took a nosedive at the end.

**alwayswords** (6.5): i hate the bridge

**bulforster** (6.5): Holding Sophie back like this is a criminal act.

**astrologicalangel** (6): I too want to party with Jesus

**Misentro** (6): Trans rights! To be honest I expected a more from Kim x Sophie. The lyrics are very underwritten.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6): i'm sorry SOPHIE but this ain't quite it

**SkyBlade79** (6): kinda basic. This would be fine without the weird “damn son where’d you find this” lmfao. Also 1+2+3= 6.

**yatcho** (6): This collab was so hyped but insanely disappointing for me

**ManofOranges** (5): I'm kinda surprised that SOPHIE is involved with this song like it doesn't have any SOPHIE signs to me. Must be the versatility.

**akanewasright** (4): This is a bop but the version without lyrics (and Dr. Luke) is better. The bass got mixed down, which SUCKS, and the new lyrics are pretty meh by Kim’s standards (with the exception of the “party with Jesus” line, that’s still iconic).

**bright\_baby\_blue** (4): [Woo-Ah: 4/10]

**Stryxen** (3): I give the first part like a 6 and then the middle a 0 then the last part like a 4

**waluigiest** (3): the chorus is fun but overall this track is devoid of substance or character

**Bendariaku89** (1): Guys, it’s catchy but like the bad it’s the grating kind of catchy like the flu. I hate the chorus and its stupid hook that grates in my ears. The autotune doesn’t help, since that only works for certain songs and it’s not this one. It’s the kind of song you might like by how much you hate it, but right now I am not in the mood. also I WANNA PARTY WITH JESUS???

**bespectacIed** (1): I was so disappointed with this song. After all the hype, this is really what they came up with? A generic, boring, trop pop song? God humbled sophie with this one

**hikkaru** (7): I'm not sure what to say about this one, really - it's another slightly underwhelming but not bad song from the second half of Blue Lips and as such it's getting the chop just prior to day 2. :kim:

**worlds-okayest666** (7): This is another one that’s just kinda...meh. But the songwriting is pretty nice (honestly, Tove’s songwriting carries a few of the songs here), and the “waiting for my heart” refrain is good as well. Idk, there’s just not really much to say about this one. It’s just there.

---

#11th of october

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): My favorite lyrically from the second half of the album. I love the way she sings “waiting for my heart”

**akanewasright** (9): The second best ballad on the album. hey you got drugs is the better song, but this one feels more personal to me. It’s fucking devastating.

**andrxwzsz** (9): Chills, always

**ManofOranges** (9): Honestly I don't get the point of coffee table books. Why have a book specifically for putting on a table just so it can hang around and maybe someone will look in it every once in a while? What's especially bad is the fact that the book takes up space! That means there's less space on the table for other things. Truly disgusting.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8.5): one of the reasons I like this song so much is that it takes place the the day after my birthday

**lapascalia** (8): also the definition of a sad bop

**quenched** (8): an international holiday

**Stryxen** (8): her voice in this is so soothing to listen to

**SkyBlade79** (7): this song is honestly kinda mid, its’ enjoyable to listen to but I don’t come back to listen to it

**vayyiqra** (7): Does October still exist? does time itself? do any of us? who even knows anymore

**bbfan132** (6): definitely a filler track, nothing too interesting about it

**bulforster** (6): Her best vocal performance on the album but the not-like-other-girls/couples energy in these lyrics is really grating.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): The post-choruses save this from being an absolute dud.

**ariiaaaa** (5.3): I just get theatre kid vibes from this???

**Bendariaku89** (5): I love the writing of the lyrics and her vocals. But other than that, the production is just too plain for me to like, plus the chorus just feels stilted. It’s a song I want to like, but I don’t.

**ggodisawomann** (5): it's fine

**MRACHNIE** (5): This is a song that definitely exists. I'm pretty sure it has an instrumental. It has some lyrics, too, probably.

**hikkaru** (8): "The struggle is real" being the hook of this song draws some criticism but personally it's just really funny to me. I like the production here well enough but other than that lyric it doesn't do the most to stand out in the second half of the album which already is a bit uninteresting compared to hte first half. It just misses day 2 and I can't say I'm too upset about that.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): Her writing an entire song out of “the struggle is real” is so embarrassing but this does bop...I feel like I should be upset about this going out on day 1 but she kinda deserves it for that chorus. Sorry, Tove!

#DAILY STRUGGLE!

**quenched** (9.5): FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK FUCK SOME SENSE INTO MEEEEE

**thoeoe** (9.5): "Fuck some sense into me" will forever be ICONIC

**anothertown** (9): this bangs insanely and reminds me of like… In the Air Tonight… but the line “the struggle is real’ is just insta perma death. Tove you cant just go around saying things like this if you want the zoomers to respect you.

**ManofOranges** (9): The struggle is real but so are the hits!

**SkyBlade79** (9): I used to hate this song so much because she really used a meme as the chorus. With more and more listens, however, I like it so much more than I used to. The production, the vocoder, and the palpable emotion in her voice all work together so well. I still don’t agree with the meme chorus but she made it work.

**1998tweety** (8): She's cute

**ariiaaaa** (8): I like the vocals here, also is Tove Lo the queen of slow builds because I AM HERE FOR IT YESSSS

**bandnitos** (8): this is H&Mcore done RIGHT!

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This actually is the song I usually end up forgetting is on this album even though I don’t think it’s the worst song. The ones I think are worse than this I can at least remember why I don’t like them as much, but every other song either stands out more overall or at least has a specific part I easily remember

**vayyiqra** (8): the struggle is real :pensive:

**rickikardashian** (7.5): mr struggle

**twat\_brained** (7.5): this was a 7 but the vocoder gives it extra points for the novelty of it

**AceSHF** (7): I want to like this song but I really can't take it seriously. That wouldn't be a problem for some artists but I know Tove is a great writer so I think its fair to expect a bit more from her.

**Bendariaku89** (7): The song has a bad line as the hook, but other than that the song gets better as it reaches the end. A better second half than its first, but not a song I would gravitate towards.

**bespectacIed** (7): cringe hook but okay song

**Stryxen** (7): there’s a lot going on and I like that but I cant take the lyrics seriously ugh “the struggle is real”

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): "the struggle is real" uggggh i hate this line and unfortunately the whole chorus is based around it

**geraldinewww** (6.5): i just think i don't like the phrase "the struggle is real"?? as a song it's fine

**Hielord** (6.2): The cringe of that one line overshadows the whole song i'm so sorry sjksksjsk

**bbfan132** (6): another track that is apparently liked but i didn’t care for that much rip

**ggodisawomann** (6): it's okay

**hunnybee12** (6): the chorus brings the whole song down for me

**waluigiest** (6): I think she just wanted to belt “the struggle is real” and wrote a song around that

**yatcho** (6): instantly dating your song by making the hook a catch phrase that people stopped saying before the album even came out

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): I literally don’t remember listening to this song

**bulforster** (5): I feel like I'd like this song a lot more if it wasn't built around "the struggle is real" played deadly serious.

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I actually don't hate this as much as I should?.. The lyrics are tragic, but at the very least it slaps, relatively to the rest of the second half.

**MRACHNIE** (5): If songs were rated by first rating them on a scale of 1 to 10 on both lyrics and production and then averaging those scores out to find out the final score, this song would be a 0, as the production is a 10 and the lyrics are a -10.

**nightjesus** (5): I feel bad but the struggle is real to enjoy this album. And I’m super bummed by that.

**akanewasright** (3): Worst chorus on the album

**pigserpent** (3): This song isn't making me feel much of anything. There are a few interesting snyths that could be better used on other songs.

**lapascalia** (0): not crazy about this one… and i have to give it my 0 unfortunately

**worlds-okayest666** (8): This is a bop, BUT it’s admittedly a bit plain and like don’t ask don’t tell, it doesn’t really go anywhere. I am still kinda surprised this placed so low, though! I thought it would have been an early/middle out on day 2...guess the girls really weren’t feeling her.

**hikkaru** (6): This song just makes me kinda bored tbh. It feels a bit empty and doesn't bring much exciting to the table. It ended up getting a music video and was a single but it's potentially the most underwhelming song on the album imo. Opinions on this were mixed but ultimately it just falls short of making day 2, with those not being the biggest fans of it winning out.

#I'm in a cycle

**racloves** (11): when I’m sad I listen to this song cause it’s super relatable

**ManofOranges** (10): Love the hook and, while I don't usually care about lyrical content in songs, this one speaks to me just a little bit. Something about being stuck in an inescapable cycle is something that I can relate to on an emotional level.

**mayolizard** (10): im in a cycle … period!!!!!!

**TiltControls** (10): just a really well crafted and performed pop song, which doesn't sound like much praise but honestly this was my second choice for an 11. It's just that well done

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop

**Stryxen** (9): this album is so good wtf I have so many 9s and 10s

**waluigiest** (9): the writing + shape of this song are tight

**lapascalia** (8.5): love this one, underrated on this album

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Her vocals sound different on this song, almost more metallic, does anybody else notice this or is it just me?

**thoeoe** (8.5): Oh hey it's the other side of the debate I was having with myself on my review of Don't Ask Don't Tell.

**andrxwzsz** (8): "Swear this is different" </3

**bbfan132** (8): this production was very pretty at times, i loved the synths - kind of repetitive but the production forced me to bump my score up by a point or so

**bespectacIed** (8): bop

**quenched** (8): i love the lyrics on this

**anothertown** (7.5): weird song, I don’t think it really comes together but I couldn’t stop listening to it lol

**nightjesus** (7): The production is different and it’s cool

worlds-okayest666: #why was this the only single other than disco tits

**twat\_brained** (6.9): I was browsing Twitter do we consider this good

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): not bad but kind of boring

**Hielord** (6.5): Feels like a coming-of-age movie soundtrack song, and that's not a bad thing

**ariiaaaa** (6.2): this is like theatre kid meets a synth for the first time and its not bad, very interesting

**bulforster** (6): The song is weirdly upbeat for these lyrical themes given what the rest of the album sounds like but I guess in a way I appreciate.

**skargardin** (6): meh

**vayyiqra** (6): witty comment

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (6): it’s starting to bore me chile...

**ggodisawomann** (5.5): this half of the album doesn't wow me

**bandnitos** (5): i just dont really like it

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): I used to like this, but not anymore, I guess.

**MRACHNIE** (5): This is a song that definitely exists. I'm pretty sure it has an instrumental. It has some lyrics, too, probably.

**SkyBlade79** (4): this is probably my least favorite Tove song ever, ngl. The production is just really bad and nothing stands out to me except for the fact that I simply don’t like this song.

**pigserpent** (2): The cuttoff on those synths is kinda painful to listen to, and the percussion and bass that comes in doesn't doo much to actually fill out the song, leaving it as a mess.

**Bendariaku89** (1): I just don’t like the song. By the end, I desperately just want to go to the next song. It sinks in like 10 seconds in that this is the whole song and I was not gonna last long enough for the end.

pat-rickstar: "Faded" should have placed higher but I'm not mad that it went out day 1. The two filler Charli songs went and they deserved to. Tomorrow will get messy though because some of my faves are sure to go 😬

Also justice for "Simon Says".

The only song left in that I can't remember a single thing about is "bad days", surely that will go soon
Overall a really fun reveal and I can't wait for tomorrow 💕

Can’t believe y’all would do ‘Need You’ like that. I’m shocked to my core. It’s like I’m sitting here with a fist full of ashes and a heart I can no longer use.
