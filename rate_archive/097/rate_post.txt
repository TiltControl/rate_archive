Hello everyone, and welcome to the 2017 Electropopflops Rate! I'm your friendly neighbourhood women-singing-over-electronic-production stan and I'll be your co-host this month, alongside the stellar u/worlds-okayest666! After a few cycles of attempting to get these albums rated, it is FINALLY happening! We're super excited to celebrate pride month by rating these ladies that are very appreciated by the LGBT+ community for their support and, for a couple of them, inclusion within said community. 

Here's what flops we'll be rating this month:

**[Allie X - CollXtion II](https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/c6/6f/8e/c66f8e01-2c43-43fc-412d-8be20ef04f7d/5054526043220_1.jpg/600x600bf.png)**

After making her official debut in 2015 with the EP “CollXtion I”, planned to be the first in a series of five releases, Allie X quickly garnered momentum in the pop world and got to work on her first full length album. In 2016, Allie announced the project “CollXtion II: Unsolved”, which saw her releasing various demos and potential album tracks throughout the year to see what fans wanted on the album. Finally, in 2017, “CollXtion II” was released, with only three tracks from the Unsolved project making it onto the final tracklisting. The album revolves around themes of longing and being lost, with each track intended to represent different pieces of herself. Ranging from moody, strikingly personal synth-pop tracks to pure 80s-pop inspired bangers, the album is somewhat more Top 40-friendly than CollXtion I but luckily manages to still retain her unique aesthetic and dark pop sound, resulting in an album that’s anything but generic. Despite some of the singles charting relatively high in Canada, the album itself ended up seeing little commercial success and failed to appear on any major charts. While it may not have reached the heights it deserved to, CollXtion II is a perfect showcase of the reason Allie’s garnered such a dedicated fanbase; her sheer talent in crafting perfect pop songs.

**[Charli XCX - Number 1 Angel](https://is4-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music111/v4/02/b5/94/02b5948e-812a-8a00-dadf-9300bdfe1a1f/190295832605.jpg/600x600bf.png)**

In 2016, Charli XCX released “Vroom Vroom”, a collection of 4 tracks produced entirely by PC Music affiliate SOPHIE. This EP saw Charli eschewing the pop punk attitude and commercial appeal of her previous album, Sucker, in favor of a more experimental electropop sound. Although reaction to the EP was somewhat divisive at first, this didn’t deter Charli, who sought to bring this sound to the mainstream with her third studio album. Unfortunately, the album would go on to suffer various delays, causing Charli to become frustrated with her label and start recording music behind their back. This would end up resulting in her third mixtape, “Number 1 Angel”, created in two weeks with PC Music founder A.G. Cook, as well as several other producers associated with the label (including previous collaborator SOPHIE). Boasting features from MØ, CupcakKe, and Uffie, among others, the 10-track mixtape builds upon the avant-pop style of Vroom Vroom while also fusing it with Charli’s ability to write amazing commercial pop hits, resulting in a surprisingly cohesive project with some of her biggest bops to date. Although the record is often overshadowed by its far more experimental successor, “Pop 2”, Number 1 Angel is a fantastic record in itself and a highlight of Charli’s discography.

**[Kim Petras - Era 1](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/kim-petras/images/d/d9/Dyx-FHqUwAA3RFD.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20191002144354)**

Kim Petras, already known for her appearance in the media as a teenager while she transitioned, debuted in 2017 with the synthy, bratty, and infectious single “I Don’t Want It At All”, which kickstarted the career of one of pop's most promising newcomers. Over the next year or so, Kim released ten other tracks to accompany her debut in a singular “era”, signified by the rainbow neon outline of her visage on the single covers. Though not officially released as an entire album, Kim and her fans alike have taken to calling this group of singles Era 1, and it is certainly a cohesive enough project to be considered an entire project - each song is an unabashedly electropop bop. With the release of these songs, Kim was gaining many new fans, but she was also garnering a lot of criticism for her decision to work exclusively with Dr. Luke in her music despite the lawsuit wherein pop icon Kesha accused him of abuse and sexual assault, and unfortunately Kim has said very little on the matter. Still, she’s managed to carve out a solid fanbase, and is a trailblazer for trans artists seeing mainstream success. (-u/hikkaru)

**[Tove Lo - BLUE LIPS \(lady wood phase II\)](https://is2-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music128/v4/be/d5/60/bed5605d-6452-0948-070b-fddea4c82c1f/00602567226536.rgb.jpg/600x600bf.png)**

Following her explosion into the mainstream across the world with the smash hit “Habits (Stay High)” and follow-up single “Talking Body”, Swedish artist Tove Lo looked to continue that with 2016’s “Lady Wood”, an album that stuck to current trends in attempt to gain another hit. However, that album failed to replicate the success of her debut, with the lead single barely charting. Lady Wood was the first of two albums in an anthology, with the sequel Blue Lips releasing just a year later. While Lady Wood aimed for success, Blue Lips goes completely raw and dark - tracks range from emotional wails backed by roaring synths to sweaty (and very horny) club bangers like lead single “Disco Tits”. Ultimately, Blue Lips failed to come anywhere close to Tove’s first two releases on the charts, with it debuting at #138 on the Billboard 200 in lieu of the top 20 positions she had seen previously. Despite that, Blue Lips is a solid and immensely cohesive album that certainly deserved far better. (-u/hikkaru)

#The Rules

*     Listen to every song listed below and assign each of them a score from **1 to 10**. Decimals are allowed, but refrain from going past one decimal place - 7.5 is fine, 7.75 is not!
*     You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. If you don’t want to, you don’t have to. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track!
*     **Rate all forty-five (45) songs!** If you skip any, your ballot won’t be counted (We will let you know if you do so you can remedy that).
*     **Please use the pre-prepared link to submit your scores!** Note that if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout it may not work - as such, we have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, and you should use a computer to send in your scores if possible! If it still does not work, a pastebin with the submission form is at the bottom of this post and may be copy/pasted into a DM if need be!
*     If you desire to change any scores after you’ve already submitted, simply message either of the cohosts (u/hikkaru, u/worlds-okayest666) and we'll be glad to help!
*     We will be keeping an eye out for sabotage, and there will be a minimum average enforced for the albums. If you truly do have very strong opinions on a song or album, leave a comment explaining why and things will go over much more smoothly.
*    It is highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, like this:

 >    Lipgloss (feat. cupcakKe): 10 Miranda Cosgrove is shaking

* You may also add comments for whole albums! You may do this by adding a colon to the album title in the rate form, like so: 

 > Album: Blue Lips: Why is the album cover red?

We're both incredibly pumped for this rate, and are equally nervous and excited for the messiness it is sure to bring. **The rate will be due July 17th!** If you have any questions about this rate or rates in general, feel free to ask any questions in the comments, DM either of the cohosts, or find us in the popheads discord server!
