**worlds-okayest666** (10): One of Charli’s best songs, and almost my 11 (well, it was for a bit before I changed it...twice…). The chorus and the bridge...WHEW! A masterpiece, methinks. I’m so happy this sneaked into day 3 at the last minute bc it ABSOLUTELY deserves it.

**hikkaru** (9): I absolutely love the production here, and most notably the guitar solo bridge! Those few seconds are for sure a highlight of the mixtape for me, and I'm definitely happy to see this just barely make day 3 (though perhaps not over bitches remix...)

---

#I love this song

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): This is my favorite song on this mixtape, as well as in this entire rate I will be giving this my 11. The songwriting and the production are so top-notch that I wish more pop songs would sound like this, structure-wise. Charli should collab with Danny L Harle more!

**Solovrinne** (11): If I am the only 11 for this song then go ahead and ban me cause I don't wont want to be here any longer.

**akanewasright** (10): This has been my favorite song from this album since my first listen. It’s just delightful. There’s a great build to the last chorus, and Danny L. Harle knocks it out of the park with the production.

**bespectacIed** (10): I wish danny and charli collaborated more, this is art

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I've been sleeping on this one. Megabop.

**ggodisawomann** (10): god, heaven

**ManofOranges** (10): This and Emotional are probably my top two of the mixtape. I feel like the heavy guitar droning at that one point during the chorus could be seen as a little weird or abrasive but compared to Charli's newer work, it's one of the more normal things that she's done. It's right in the sweet spot for me.

**n7cn7c** (10): yup

**quenched** (10): this is IT!!! the production on this is so good i’m in shambles

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Thankfully the album has picked up for me, I like this middle section a lot more than the first few songs

**waluigiest** (10): this song paved the way for how i’m feeling now

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This was close to being a 10 and therefore an 11 contender

**plastichaxan** (9.3): when she said "i don't talk a lot so you should listen up" i truly felt that

**anothertown** (9): an ass shaker

**bandnitos** (9): guitar solo!!!

**bbfan132** (9): awesome track, repetitive but in the best way possible

**iloveneonlights** (9): - Heard this on H&M once

**lapascalia** (9): it’s sweet and it goes off

**pigserpent** (9): The verses aren't my favorite but the chorus just being a long BRWRRRWAAAAAAHH that adds screechs over it is a bold move that pays off in spades. There's a lot of greatness going on in the bridge too and there's a neat solo.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Ok this actually bops a bit.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): a solid streak of bops

**thoeoe** (8.5): UGH so cute!!!!

**andrxwzsz** (8): BANGER ALERT

**ariiaaaa** (8): this sounds like an upbeat Emotional but im not mad, im in LOVE with the chorus

**MRACHNIE** (8): Danny L Harle going extremely hard on this is the only reason the score isn't lower, Charli's performance of this song is actually kinda meh.

**SkyBlade79** (8): I really love the guitar noise on this

**Stryxen** (8): thinking about the time I’m sure I heard this in public and can’t remember where

**vayyiqra** (8): This is kind of just "Emotional" but better and more catchy but I still like it.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): generic but cute!

**racloves** (7): who would have thought Charli was such a big fan of Irish band U2 she wrote a whole song about her love for them. (Thank you for supporting my stand up comedy career)

#I hate it

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): This sounds like a SUCKER reject

**sandyfishnets** (5.5): the problem with this song for me is that it just sounds way too over produced for my taste. The melody and the beat are great, but all these effects and then the over the top electronic guitar solo is just too much.

**hunnybee12** (5): charli sounds bored as hell

**skargardin** (5): I hate to say this because this used to be one of my absolute favorite Charli songs, but it's just.. not hitting the same at ALL this is so sad..

**nightjesus** (2): Oh this is kinda messy. I really dislike that high pitched flute thingy. The drums were a choice. She really didn’t hold back on the use of drums in this track. Most of the drums don’t blend together well to me.

**hikkaru** (10): This is a summer BOP, chronicling a fling that starts with a sighting through sunglasses and ultimately having its end as summer comes to its finish. I was sleeping on this for the longest time, until hosting this rate in fact, but I'm glad it grew on me! I'm also extremely glad to see it make day 3 alongside the two other obvious Kim choices, it's definitely one of her best in my opinion!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): Another one that would have been a smash hit in 2010 (and I mean that in the best way possible). I’m kinda shocked this one didn’t go even further! It actually almost didn’t make day 3...a nightmare, literally a nightmare. Thank god it did!

---

#You make my heart sparkle like champagne

**bright\_baby\_blue** (11): This song is synth perfection. There's just enough variation to make it interesting and the vocals runs + electric guitar solo are amazing. If only there was a woo-ah... [Woo-Ah: None]

**rickikardashian** (11): I wish I could put into words the way this song makes me feel; I have tried, and I’m just not able to do so. It feels like reminiscing about old summer days, it’s nostalgic, playful and bittersweet at the same time. Not many things make me feel like this song does.

**alwayswords** (10): bong rip noises

**ariiaaaa** (10): ICONIC, as a lesbian this is the only song about boys I will accept

**bandnitos** (10): a classic

**ggodisawomann** (10): so fun live

**Hielord** (10): This is pure pop, catchy, fun, and campy.

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this one is just delicious. I hate how much I like it. But this song really just has it all doesn't it.

**Misentro** (10): This is definitely the highlight of the era for me. The production is so good and the song is ridiculously catchy, a perfect summer bop.

**nightjesus** (10): YOU BREAK MY LOVE MACHINE

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Because I do not partake in certain activities, I thought the sound at the beginning was her blowing bubbles into a soda or something until I saw a comment on here that said it was a bong

**skargardin** (10): throwback to when queen u/hikkaru told me that it's a BONG RIP and not champagne that's being poured up on the intro sdjfskjfs im so ashame my fantasy is ruined..

**waluigiest** (10): this song is pure summer bliss!

**yatcho** (10): Pop perfection

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This is good enough that I'm tempted to break my no Dr L*ke rule and save it on spotify

**quenched** (9.5): i’m subtracting 0.5 for the slurping at the start, it triggered my fight or flight

**1998tweety** (9): Kind of a big bop.

**anothertown** (9): Her vocals are so expressive in this song, she is proving that you can sing upbeat, poppy, and dramatic at the same time. I also love the concept of hillside boys – for the longest time I thought it was some European thing because I never connected the word “hillside” with Hollywood – it sounds more rural – and a lazier writer would just say Hollywood. PLUS the bridge here is my favorite bridge of all time.

**bbfan132** (9): perfect song for the summer, outsold malibu

**fluviusfluit** (9): I sure hope no hillside boys call my name but I unfortunately have to give credit where it's due...

**lapascalia** (9): that 80s sound is so good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9):  high-key earworm, makes me nostalgic for fuccbois I’ve never met

**thoeoe** (9): The perfectly done vibrato, a guitar solo that somehow doesn't feel out of place, YES.

**twat\_brained** (9): I didn't know who I was before I learned how iconic Kim's pop is and how much I need it in my life

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): wish hillside boys would call my name...pain

**akanewasright** (8): One time came on shuffle with a friend and my 10 year old brother in the car. The beginning played, and my friend exclaimed, fully knowing what a bong rip sounds like, “wow, I love water”.

**Bendariaku89** (8): ASMR. I jest, it’s a really good song, though there are parts of the production that I’m not a fan of.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Okay this is actually really good. Thank God because I was getting bored with these forgettable C-sides from Kim.

**vayyiqra** (8): I am irrationally bothered by how she has a song called "Hills" and another called "Hillside Boys" and whether the hillside boys live beside these hills or on the side of them or whether they are a different set of hills indeed but nevertheless this is a bop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This song reminds me distincly of a song but i have no idea what it is

**andrxwzsz** (7): Cinematic summer pop

#I-i-i-it's over

**ignitethephoenix** (7): tf is this gurgling in the beginning...I hate that

**pigserpent** (6): Good chorus, meh verses, overall sounds like it's trying to be "Girls Just Wanna Have Fun," but subtle, which isn't working.

**Stryxen** (5.5): I like the chorus but I can barely remember what the rest sounds like

**SkyBlade79** (3): this song feels wayyyy too long

**bespectacIed** (2): kim stop shouting!!! And releasing katy perry demos

**worlds-okayest666** (10): Another absolute classic!! I know some people prefer the unsolved version, but I honestly enjoy this one better? It just feels so smooth. Pop perfection.

**hikkaru** (8): The only non-Casanova Allie track to make day 3, I've heard that this is a big fan favourite and is viewed as one of her absolute best. Personally I think it's decent but not fantastic... but I'm happy that she's got something other than the big single and its remix into day 3. The synths here are a lot of fun and I can see why her fans like it so much.

#Stay high

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): i dont know what to give my 11 to out of all the 10s tbh but this one is a slapper and i love it so it can have it

**1998tweety** (10): This gets a high score from my solely from nostalgia. I remember listening to this every morning for half a year in highschool while brushing my teeth.

**anothertown** (10): literally, banger!!!!!! The prechorus key change!

**bandnitos** (10): the og's better but this is still top tier

**bright\_baby\_blue** (10): I credit this song with turning me into a pophead. The bass here is so sick. The lyrics are great. Everything is great.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This was my contender for my 11. Something about this song strongly resonated with me and the strong pop production really amplified my love for this song.

**ggodisawomann** (10): goes AWF

**hunnybee12** (10): she kinda sounds like avril lavigne here? easily the best song on the album tho

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a fight between this song and the casanova remix for my favorite song on the album. I'm not exactly sure which one I would pick but I think this song just barely edges casanova out. It's got that little bit of oomph that I crave.

**Misentro** (10): Even though they tell me I'd be better alone, you're in my muscle memory and you're in my bones, a world without you is a world I don't want to know... OLD HABITS DIE HARD! 🗣🔥🔥🔥

**mudkip1** (10): i prefer the original mix but this is still incredible. i think the original would've gotten my 11 if it were on here

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): a hard fave

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I love the production and the chord progression in this one, this will be robbed

**Solovrinne** (10): A strong contender for my 11... I for one love the album version just as much as the Unsolved version

**TiltControls** (10): Everything about this song just goes hard. Probably my favourite song of hers

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a bop but also it's very dark and I don't like the idea that it's impossible to change the bad things about us. I really, really don't like it. It shows what a good songwriter Allie is though that she can affect me this way.

**thoeoe** (9.5): Oh fuck yes. This song captures everything that was amazing about CollXtion I while still meshing with the tone of the whole album. Fun synth sounds, fun vocal backing tracks with effects bouncing back and forth.

**bespectacIed** (9): those synth pads bruh

**fluviusfluit** (9): They truly do she was right and should have said it

**geraldinewww** (9): this would be my 11 if it was the unsolved mix of the song. justice for the unsolved mix!!!!!

**lapascalia** (9): they really do die hard don’t they

**plastichaxan** (9): one of her best yup

**quenched** (9): the production on this chefs kiss

**skargardin** (9): mood

**twat\_brained** (9): Allie may want to correct her brains I just want to remove the worms in mine

**yatcho** (8.5): Allie is really a pro in this 80s synth realm im glad she continued with this sound in Super Sunset

**andrxwzsz** (8): Like Casanova, I prefer the demo, but great nonetheless

**nightjesus** (8): I loooove most of the song. The verses are a little slower for me but other then that it’s an Allie classic.

**bbfan132** (7.5): cute song!

#Goodbye

**Bendariaku89** (7.5): I like parts of this, but the rest feel boring.

**ariiaaaa** (7): this song went in a different direction to what I thought it would, and I'm not mad at it, but I do kinda wanna remix it into something interesting

**mayolizard** (7): vocals seem a little bit weak? Mixed weird perhaps? Idk it's not hitting for me

**n7cn7c** (7): aged like....idk yogurt? like it was just ok to begin w

**Stryxen** (6.5): I’m bopping my head but also no thoughts

**SkyBlade79** (6): a bit too repetitive

**pigserpent** (5): This one starts alright, but as the song starts incoperating more trebel it starts to sound awkward. The chorus is very underwhleming, and I'm not a fan of filtered section that ends the first chorus.

**worlds-okayest666** (11): This song is so fucking good!! It just makes me wanna go FERAL. Charli and SOPHIE are a dream team and this song proves it. The “yeah, yeah, yeah”s, the ad-libs in the chorus, the breakdown...everything about this song is just a chef’s kiss moment. I do wish it could have gone even further, but hey; top 12 is nothing to scoff at!

**hikkaru** (10): I love love LOVE this song. It's pure SOPHIE-produced bliss between her punchy synths and darker breakdowns, and Charli gives her staple reptitive-as-hell songwriting but it makes for what is an absolute highlight in Charli's discography. I NEED for her and SOPHIE to work together more. I'm super happy to see this make day 3 as it's one of the best on the mixtape, though it IS unfortunate that it just barely misses the top 10.

**akanewasright** (10): This is the last great Sophie & Charli song that got released. Like... they had Lipgloss and Out of My Head, but this song is just the two of them. I miss songs like this and Vroom Vroom and No Angel and Taxi.

**bandnitos** (10): ok ms sophie

**bespectacIed** (10): This song gives me so much buzz. It's soooo Sophie. Outsold Vroom Vroom easily

**costalhp** (10): I remember when this album/mixtape came out I had it on repeat for like 2 years, but speaking about this song in particular I am embarrassed to say how many scrolls it has on my Last FM. I just love this one.

**cremeebrulee** (10): an almost 11 contender and a super duper bop

**ggodisawomann** (10): BANGS

**hunnybee12** (10): yayayayayayyaya

**iloveneonlights** (10): - My go-to treadmill song for a very long time

**n7cn7c** (10): yeyeyeyeup

**plastichaxan** (10): top tier charli

**skargardin** (10): YEAH YEAH YEAH YEAHH YEAH YEAH !!!!!!!

**twat\_brained** (10): I know many don't appreciate Charli's more repetitive songs but to me she shines when they're produced as well as this

**yatcho** (10): This is THE best running song of all time we love a 140 bpm song

**bbfan132** (9.5): grew off me a tiny bit it’s still enjoyable as hell, danny l harle did more than what he had to do

**bulforster** (9.5): Sophie and Charli are a dream team.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): why do i keep hearing it as "do you wanna fuck with me"

**AceSHF** (9): I don't know why but this one reminds me of a Kylie Minogue song (and yes that's a huge compliment)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): “DO YOU WANT TO FALL WITH ME? SAY YEAH. DO YA DO YA?” This is an absolute bop.

**fluviusfluit** (9): Sophie's mind!

**lapascalia** (9): yaaaas

**quenched** (9): as with most of my comments i have nothing intelligent to say other than issa bop ✨

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I love the staccato synths

**SkyBlade79** (9): this slaps and you cannot disagree

**Stryxen** (9): DO U WANNA ROLL WIV ME

**thoeoe** (9): Yes Charli I wanna roll with you, it sounds like fun; get in loser we're going shopping

**Bendariaku89** (8.5): After listening to three songs I hated, FINALLY there’s a song I can actually stand for more than 10 seconds.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8.3): the first time I heard this u didn’t realize it was about rolling on drugs and brought it was a follow up to Vroom Vroom.

**ManofOranges** (8): Yes.

**nightjesus** (8): This sounds like a SOHPIE produced track. Ayyyy it is! Her sound is so signature.

**pat-rickstar** (8): If the "yeah yeah yeah" wasn't as annoying this would probably be a 10-worthy banger.

**pigserpent** (8): The first song on the album to breakout of the more etherial mold and go for a song purely based around a riff that carries the song forward. It's fun, but hardly a standout.

**sandyfishnets** (8): SOPHIE's production really shines here, my queen!

**vayyiqra** (8): In the grand tradition of post-2016 Charli's "fun party songs with kind of silly lyrics that nevertheless bop"

**waluigiest** (8): says nothing substantial but it doesn’t need to!!

**Hielord** (7.4): A decent earworm for me

#No

**1998tweety** (7.5): Bops a bit but also annoying at points

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I like the production but the lyrics are lacking for me

**TiltControls** (6.5): I know the song is called roll with me but I just keep hearing her ask if she wants to vogue with me (thanks vanessa hudgens)

**andrxwzsz** (6): I like when it gets all dark and industrial, but everything else is a bit grating and below par

**hikkaru** (10): This bouncy bop tells a whole story and it's so satisfying to listen to it develop into the "fuck you" breakup anthem it eventually becomes. I'm glad this made day 3 as it's definitely one of my favourites from N1A and Charli overall!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): Talk about a discography highlight! This is a fucking BANGER and I love the switch-up for the final chorus (reminds me of Need Ur Luv from Sucker, which is another discography highlight and I will die on this hill). This deserved top 10, but oh well...at least it made day 3!

---

#11AM

**CritneySpearz** (11): the chorus slaps so hard holy fuk I love this song, and MØ's voice really shines here for some reason.

**bandnitos** (10): i remember listening to this when it was premiered on... radio 1 i think and i instantly loved it

**iloveneonlights** (10): - MO sounds so good and they have really good chemistry. I love the flipping of the story in the lyrics as well

**ManofOranges** (10): Gotta love the character development from "I got to pull up pull up" to "No more no pull up pull up."

**n7cn7c** (10): YUP

**pigserpent** (10): This song is more or less representative of everything I love about this era of Charli. Sugary synths that create an open and awesome vibe, a strong dance rhythm that gives the song momentum, an oustanding chorus, and Charli's unique inflections and delivery are on full show this song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): da da ooh-ooh

**quenched** (10): this is my second favorite on the album, behind miss lipgloss. the chorus is the definition of infectious / catchy

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection methinks, this is the definition of an earworm

**Stryxen** (10): BANGER (but its no Porsche (feat. MO)(11))

**thoeoe** (10): I don't even know what to say about this song, Its just PERFECT. MO on the bridge, The way she flips the script to "Go fuck yourself", it's just FUN.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): the turn when they say “go fuck yourself” excellence.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): my only criticism is that it gets annoying with repeated listens but it’s my fault for literally looping that shit

**AceSHF** (9.5): I kinda wish there was another feature for the second verse tbh

**akanewasright** (9.5): I love that this song has an arc to it. That last chorus is one of the best moments from 2017’s pop music.

**bbfan132** (9.5): i usually find mø boring but this is such a banger, love it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): WE LOVE COMPELLING STORYTELLING ABOUT DRAGGING FUCKBOIS.

**lapascalia** (9): this is so catchy, a great collab

**nightjesus** (9): https://imgur.com/t/tina_belcher/OPcoUbO

**waluigiest** (9): I love love love the chorus. This song is so bouncy and fun and feels like a flood of heart emojis

**1998tweety** (8.5): Chorus slaps but I HATE Mo's voice so it loses half a point.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): Charli can chant pull up in a million songs and I'll never get sick of it

**SkyBlade79** (8.5): it’s not mo’s best work, but the song definitely still serves.sss

**andrxwzsz** (8): Total earworm and MØ is the best

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a bop; stream MO

**twat\_brained** (7.2): @Huggies where's Charli's brand deal?

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.1): The contrast between this song's ballad-y vocals and its punchy production is pretty cool. It's not a standout for me, but definitely worth a few relistens.

**ggodisawomann** (7): I like this more than I used to

**Hielord** (7): I wish there were no covid and I could be drunk af, calling my ex on a public bathroom

#0AM

**fluviusfluit** (6.5): Porsche is the superior MØ collab

**anothertown** (6): I like how mo used the feature to take a turn in the story but this is like peak Charli annoying vocals so that is unfortunate

**hikkaru** (8): If I had to pick one thing in these results I disagree with most it's THIS making top 10 and beating the remix. I'm of the opinion that the bitches remix blows this original version completely out of the water - this 2 minute long solo version just feels empty and incomplete without the features. However, the greater audience disagrees with me as this made day 3 while the remix did not.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): This is a bop, don’t get me wrong, but it just sounds so...empty without the features. Like, it honestly sounds unfinished to me. Really confused as to how this made day 3 but the remix didn’t...it’s getting weird.

---

#Appreciate it

**ariiaaaa** (11): SHE WENT THERE OHMYGOD, IM SUCH A STAN FOR THIS

**Bendariaku89** (10): A song that knows how long it should be. I’m proud of Tove Lo for making a song that’s only two and a quarter minutes long and making it work. Make this song any longer, and it gets boring. With this, her performance and fierce production carry this sense of badassery that’s uniquely Tove Lo. It helps that the lyrics just sound like it’s written who knows what the fuck she’s talking about and isn’t afraid to talk about it.

**bespectacIed** (10): Discothèque bosoms has a huge chance to win the rate so it gets my 11, but this is my true favorite song in this rate. What a sexy song ugh why tf did god have to make me gay!!!! tove made it seem like having sex with women is so much more of a serve 😭 Best song ever created in history.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Remember when she previewed the entire song with a end credits scene where she was masturbating the entire time in the Lady Wood short film? Now that’s an iconic moment.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I used to listen to the Spotify Singles version of this before she called it bitches. it was "What I Want For The Night" back in those days. studio was unreleased!

**iloveneonlights** (10): - Such a HBIC song

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another hit. No punches were pulled.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Normally a song this short would bother me but I really think this one would be a bit much if it was longer

**SkyBlade79** (10): I’ve never heard a song that is so absolutely deliciously dirty and sensual at the same time. Tove’s persona on this song is flawless omg. I will never get tired of this song, especially that bassline holy hell. Also, “dripping in harmony, like fifth” is one of the most iconic lines ever no joke. The production is just too good to not love this song. I have had 3 of my straight friends bopping this

**vayyiqra** (10): Horny lesbian synthjams are based

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): kween of telling men how to eat pussy

**fluviusfluit** (9.5): Automatically sang "It's Charli baby" after "even a few, yeah more than you"

**thoeoe** (9.5): Classic, this is one of the songs I always bring up when people ask how vulgar Tove's lyrics actually are.

**akanewasright** (9): I prefer the remix, but the song is spectacular either way.

**andrxwzsz** (9): The Fairy Dust short film is excellent BTW

**bandnitos** (9): the fifth harmony line i

**lapascalia** (9): dripping in harmony like fifth is such a good line

**Misentro** (9): This would be a 10 if it weren't for the remix which makes it even better. It's unabashedly horny and dirty and I love it.

**quenched** (9): a smash, the chorus is so insanely catchy. bisexual queen

**Stryxen** (9): ugh if this song were a charli xcx, icona pop, elliphant, and alma remix, it would be a 10

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): I feel like the remix is the same quality as this, just different

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): it’s a bit cynical but I understand what she was going for, cheeky sleazy fun that sticks in your brain. Really made me reflect on how these lyrics seemed jarring from a woman but are basically expected from a man, and whether I fall into the trap of expecting perfect queer representation. It’s comparable to the Weeknd’s nihilistic hedonistic themes (except this song is a jolt of energy and The Weeknd’s sex bops are lowkey sleepy lol)

**twat\_brained** (8.5): "dripping in harmony, **like fifth**. Day 3 alone for that.

**geraldinewww** (8): "drippin in harmony, like fifth" is such a funny line

**Hielord** (8): I love how raw Tove Lo is, lmao

**nightjesus** (8): okay this is a damn B O P.

**waluigiest** (8): “dripping in harmony like fifth” shook

**yatcho** (8): sapphic fuckboy anthem

#Remix stans

**MRACHNIE** (8): The production is absolutely incredible, however, the song is way too short and doesn't really go anywhere.

**1998tweety** (8): Honestly this would be much higher but the remix just blows it out of the water.

**plastichaxan** (8): she's cute but the remix is gorgeous

**skargardin** (8): the album version is a tad bit short

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.5): the remix is better

**alwayswords** (7): the 5th harmony lyric

**anothertown** (7): this is for some type of girl that i amn't.. Dripping in harmony like fifth <___<

**bbfan132** (7): funny but too short

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Undercooked.

**mayolizard** (7): remix outsold

**bright\_baby\_blue** (6): The hook is kind of meh but the bass is able to carry this song. The concept here has potential, but it needs something more. If only there was something like a more interesting remix...

**pigserpent** (5): I can never tell if I like this song and think it's hella groovy, or if it sucks. I alternate everytime I hear it, so I guess a 5 is fair.

**hikkaru** (9): One of a few deep cuts from Blue Lips to make the top 10, I personally think this is a bop but not quiiiiite as good as the songs above it.

---

#She knows this is a bop!

**ggodisawomann** (11): one of Tove's most perfect songs!

**mayolizard** (11): CLASSIC!!!!

**Bendariaku89** (10): Basically, this is listening to essence of Paradise Falls without falling into the traps of tropical music. Quite a great feat too, sounds like the beach even though it sounds nothing what people would do to make sound like a beach. It can feel repetitive though, but that’s personal preference.

**Hielord** (10): This is what sexy music should sound like. She definitely KNOWS what she is doing here

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another hit, Ms. Lo does it again.

**quenched** (10): mega bop, she just doesn’t miss

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I think this one is the best lyrically from the first half of the album, and the production is great too

**Stryxen** (10): I don’t know what to say other than this is really good

**twat\_brained** (10): remember when after the album was released this was #1 on the PH50? that was a great week

**1998tweety** (9.5): Massive bop, robbed of success.

**thoeoe** (9.5): The entirety of this album just kills it with the tonality of the synths, but this track is the pinnacle peak of that.

**andrxwzsz** (9): You can literally feel the sweat in the club

**ignitethephoenix** (9): bops

**lapascalia** (9): the definition of a sad bop

**skargardin** (9): sultry jam :mm:

**SkyBlade79** (9): I love how well she plays the “villain” in this one while still giving a realistic but detached view of the situation.

**waluigiest** (9): the synths are so juicy. Great follow up to disco tits

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): a cheating bop.

**bbfan132** (8.5): a sensual bop that is perfect for the nighttime, doesn’t reinvent the wheel but it’s fun

**anothertown** (8): repetitive but a slapper

**bandnitos** (8): could build more

**bespectacIed** (8): Bop. Sounds like the type of song Selena Gomez's team would buy for her to sing mediocrely in her album

**vayyiqra** (8): Okay but does she know or not help me figure this out here so I know whether to tell her or not

**akanewasright** (7): I like this song. It’s not anywhere near the best song of the rate (I don’t even think I’d be upset if it went out on day 1), but I like it.

**nightjesus** (7): I dunno why I’m getting Te Amo vibes but I am?

**pigserpent** (7): I like the "Ooh whoo" synths that repeat ever measure and there's a decent vocal melody through the runtime. As for the negatives, it has a slow start and it's pretty repetitive.

**ariiaaaa** (6.5): that drop is a disappointment but this is solid

**hikkaru** (10): The one highlight of Blue Lips' second half sees great success in the rate, making it all the way to the top 10. While the songs that surround it in the album completely faltered here, hey you got drugs stands out with its roaring synths and desperate wails from Tove to be a discography highlight and fantastic closer to the album. I'm happy to see it get so high!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): Amazing. Such a perfect end to this album, and to the whole Lady Wood story. By far one of her best (especially in terms of songwriting) and I honestly wish this made it even further. It’s hard to put into words my love for this song, it’s just so raw and emotional and honestly...it’s near-perfect.

---

#The one good song from PITCH BLACK!

**1998tweety** (11): Oh WOW what a song to close the album on. The bridge into that last chorus is a legendaric moment. I'm ascending. I do think it goes on for a little too long but I like it so I don't really mind. Doing the bridge 2 times and cutting one of the choruses at the end would've had a stronger impact.

**mrmoody112** (11): if this isnt in the top 5 im coming for the whole subreddit.

**SkyBlade79** (11): Definitely one of my favorite songs ever. Tove does best on these big theatric, multi-act songs, and this is no exception. The culmination of everything in the song at the end is just SOOOOOOO good that I get chills every time I hear it. This is really also the culmination of the entire Lady Wood saga, and it shows that it's all just a cycle back to pain and pleasure, just as we knew it would be. This is one of those songs you hear and just forget what you were doing when you hear it because it’s just so captivatingly tragic. I can't really describe how perfect this is.

**TiltControls** (11): Such a dark song done so well. Fantastic way to end the album

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the definition of a sad banger. i'm not really a tove fan but this is easily her best song

**AceSHF** (10): One of the best album closers I have ever heard

**akanewasright** (10): This is probably the best song Tove Lo has ever written. It’s absolutely masterful. I’m team Disco Tits, but this song is just something else.

**bbfan132** (10): more qualified people will talk about the excellent aspects of this song so i’ll just say that this is a wonderful closing track to the album and would be a deserving winner!

**Bendariaku89** (10): The actual best song of the album, though not my favorite [that goes to stranger]. It’s such a powerful song, with a great chorus. The song varies from verse to chorus and keeps it interesting with its production. That amazing bridge settles this as pretty much her best song of the bunch. It’s basically the sequel to Habits, and it doesn’t disappoint.

**bespectacIed** (10): Why is this so sad???

**cremeebrulee** (10): holy shit this is how you END an album!!! its such a sad song masked in upbeat bop and i wish i had another 11 to give it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): The fucking perfect closer not just for this album, but also for the entire Lady Wood era.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): A wonderful closer, probably the best song on the album. Too bad half the road to this was tragic.

**ManofOranges** (10): While I have never had drugs, that doesn't stop me from liking this song! Also I remember recommending this song to a good friend and they really liked it and what better feeling is there than when someone likes a song that you recommend.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): epic tbh, almost eleven material

**shesdoingyoga** (10): If disco tits didn’t exist this would be my 11. Her vocals absolutely elevate this from very good to perfect

**skargardin** (10): This was an 11 contender, her writing on this song is just as good if not better than on Habits, which is one of my absolute favorite Tove Lo penned songs.

**Stryxen** (9.5): I love her voice, the production, and the lyrics in most places but they’re probably the weakest part.

**andrxwzsz** (9): "Think I'm falling out of my feelings" a perfect closer to the best album Tove Lo will probably ever make

**hunnybee12** (9): had to listen to this a few times to feel it, but damn is it sad

**pat-rickstar** (9): Sad banger alert

**waluigiest** (9): big “sitting in a parked car about to have an emotional conversation” energy

**yatcho** (9): Finally one of these emotional, ballady songs gets decent production and writing! Half this album is mostly failed attempts to get what this song achieves!

**twat\_brained** (8.8): as far as album closers go, I can't really ask anything more from Tove

**quenched** (8.5): hey you got bops?

**fluviusfluit** (8): The album really loses its steam in the last third but this one saves the day

**vayyiqra** (8): no i don't sorry but i'm sorry you're feeling this tove i'm here if you ever need to talk

#I do not have drugs

**ariiaaaa** (7): ballad time, the theatre kid in Tove Lo quakes

**bandnitos** (7): its aight

**ggodisawomann** (6): lmao the title

**Hielord** (6): Not a real fan of her down-tempo songs

**lapascalia** (6): i can objectively recognize it’s a good song, but i just don’t connect with it though

**MRACHNIE** (6): While the lyrics are indeed very raw and emotional, the production is far too busy and generic to allow the lyrics and Tove's voice to really sell the pain that the song is about.

**pigserpent** (5): The big emotionally finale that doesn't make me feel anything, although I do think Tove Lo's voice is really good on this song.

**anothertown** (4): has anyone ever asked anybody that in those words. This is a lame album-closer-y type song.

**hikkaru** (10): This is the fan fave deep cut from Blue Lips and it's easy to see why. The production is absolutely immaculate, done by Ali Payami of Max Martin's production posse who also worked on similar dark and synthy bangers like Style, Into You, and Cool For The Summer. The theatrics of stranger make it stand out as a highlight in Tove's discography and it's definitely one of my faves in this rate. For a good while this was holding on to #2, but unfortunately it ended up falling with the last few ballots.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): A fucking BANGER! The guitar goes off, and I love how raw and passionate she sounds here. I feel like this song just gets better and better as it goes on, which really works out in it’s favor. One of her best songs and I WILL fight you about this.

---

#You're my stranger in the dark

**Bendariaku89** (11): This is driving in someone’s motorcycle who wanted to show you what the city can show. Lights flashing by as the wind blows through you, hugging them tight as the thrill of the situation excites you. A song that evokes mystery, adventure and adrenaline without feeling exhausting. It’s not the best song of the album [that’s hey you got drugs], but it’s certainly my favorite.

**quenched** (11): i know this won’t win because y’all are tasteless, but this is a masterpiece and yes it’s better than disco tits. the production on this is SUPERB and that moment at the end when you think it’s over but then the beat drops for a final euphoric 20 seconds....i collapse everytime, i don’t know a better song i really don’t

**untutorable** (11): something about this song fucking HITS man i love it i really do

**Awkward\_King** (10): this honestly if it were solely on my fave song could be my 11, but i pretty equally love d1sco t1ts and that has much more chance of winning. but i fucking love this song so much

**cremeebrulee** (10): another almost 11 contender, such a bop

**fluviusfluit** (10): I was really obsessed with this song when I first discovered this album so I'll be biased a little as a treat

**ggodisawomann** (10): BANGER

**ManofOranges** (10): The guitar in this song is hot as hell. And the part where she sings "I wanna be want you want me to be" is so fucking good I cannot accurately describe how good it is.

**Misentro** (10): Beautiful. Tove sounds absolutely incredible here, it might be her best singing to date. The raw emotion in her voice is just so powerful, you can feel the desperation in "I want to be what you want me to be". Then top it all off with the incredible piano and guitar moments. If it weren't for Disco Tits this would be my 11.

**skargardin** (10): the guitar UGHH

**SkyBlade79** (10): Only Tove could make the word “vagabond” work so well. I absolutely adore this song, especially the last minute. It’s just so perfect

**thoeoe** (10): This song actually makes my cry every single time I hear it. Oh my god the fucking pain in her voice asking her heart to be stepped on. But also I want to dance. Her mind.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I really should be giving this a 10 but there’s just something about how the song ends that I don’t fully like

**twat\_brained** (9.2): I heard that first piano chord and thought this was "My Way" by Ava Max. this is a much better song instead. I'm incredibly surprised this isn't a Weeknd song, honestly

**anothertown** (9): i just redid my spotify equalizer and this is fucking slamming. That intro is so good.

**ariiaaaa** (9): oooo guitars and 70s vibes hello

**bespectacIed** (9): A european white girl probably won't win a rate with a song named Stranger(s) for the 3rd time, but this is a collapse

**ignitethephoenix** (9): things like-most of this song, things I don’t like-her saying vagabond

**pigserpent** (9): That guitar line gives this song an extra splash of color, and it's a unique take on synthwave. I wish the chorus was a bit stronger, but I have no major complaints with this one

**Stryxen** (9): I was originally going to say this isn’t my favourite song called stranger but I actually think it might be now

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Production bangs but the chorus isn't really that memorable? Idk

**rickikardashian** (8.5): that intro was an explosion and i loved every second of it

**andrxwzsz** (8): That fucking guitar riff fucks me up

**bandnitos** (8): this sounds like a the weeknd song

**lapascalia** (8): the electric guitar at the end is a nice touch

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): solid tune, a depressing horny mood

**vayyiqra** (8): Angsty synthpop ballads fuck I cannot get enough of them

#the edm feature she did called "Strangers" outsold

**1998tweety** (7.5): Bops but also drags a little bit

**bbfan132** (7): i was expecting something really good bc of the hype on discord but to me it’s just a pretty good dance pop track… still good enough for me to give a 7 to it so

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7): The drums and guitar here are pretty cool, and I do like the hook. But imo it's a lot longer than it needs to be.

**Hielord** (6.8): The intro and outro are amazing, the rest of the song is lacking.

**yatcho** (6.8): The synths and guitar riff in the intro sets an amazing mood, disappointed it's not more prevalent in the rest of song and that it turns into more of a ballad than a dance song

**bulforster** (5.5): The guitar is cool but the rest of the song suppresses and sucks the life out of it.

**nightjesus** (5): I’m not overly loving it and I really want to.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): Verite is lowkey oversinging on her verse BUT it’s still a 10 bc like...come on. It’s Casanova! I’m glad to see the original outselling it in this rate, tho...

**hikkaru** (9): For me personally, Casanova is my favourite Allie song. But this version, that was included in the rate due to it being the version to recieve a music video and having three times as many streams on Spotify, does nothing to improve upon the original. In my opinion Verite adds nothing but unnecessary vocal contrast... but the production and melodies are just so good that I can't help but give it a good score anyways. While the original outpeaked (:kim:) and did so throughout the entirety of the rating period, the remix still gets a respectable #6.

---

**pat-rickstar** (11): This chorus is so catchy and yeah it was between this and the original for my 11

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, deserved to smash [2]. I remember when the remix initially came out but the original audio played, so everyone was confused why it sounded so similar.

**364unbirthdays** (10): I didn't realize the remix was a different song until now

**Bendariaku89** (10): Somehow, I love Verite’s voice over Allie’s? Same score though.

**bespectacIed** (10): An already good song vastly improved by the remix, what a rare thing. Stream Savage Remix!

**ggodisawomann** (10): first version I heard of this song and I love it the most

**ignitethephoenix** (10): still excellent with Verite

**ManofOranges** (10): Casanova is already a 10 and I feel like I like this version even more. I wish I could give this a 10.5 or something, because it's not quite my 11 but I think it's a cut above the rest.

**mayolizard** (10): verite elevated this to another level

**Misentro** (10): What happens when you take a perfect song and add another singer whose voice fits in and complements Allie's perfectly? An ever perfecter song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): see this is how you remix a song, main pop girls, especially those from the april rate, please do take note

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): LOVE Vérité’s voice on this

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Another remix where I actually enjoy the added artist’s presence on the song. Verite is criminally underrated!

**SkyBlade79** (10): Verite is such a talented artist and her deep and soulful voice mixes so well with Allie X’s lilt. It just sounds so great and I love this feature; it might be one of my favorite features ever tbh.

**twat\_brained** (10): Verité's presence is no different than the solo version. It's still a 10 from me :)

**vayyiqra** (10): It's good, but doesn't add a whole lot to the original. Their voices go together well though. I wish I liked Verite's music more but alas.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): This is the best version of the song. The production immaculate and their voices play well off of each other very well.

**yatcho** (10): A joint slay by two underrated legends

**bandnitos** (9.5): this amplifies it

**akanewasright** (9): I adore some of the riffs that Verite added to the end. I think they add a lot more variety to the song, and that’s awesome. But Allie had a pretty laser perfect delivery of the bridge and second verse, and Verite doesn’t quite match that. Like, she doesn’t try to do that last chorus quietly at all, and that kinda sucks.

**cremeebrulee** (9): is this really a remix? it sounds exactly like the original to me, not that i mind

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): At first, I thought the remix felt unnecessary. However, with more listens, Verite’s voice really added that extra punch to this remix to the point I couldn’t really listen to the original without her voice in my head.

**nightjesus** (9): It’s still a bop I just don’t like the added vocals in the beginning of the bridge mkaaay.

**Stryxen** (9): idk it’s just as good and the remix works

**untutorable** (9): og outsold just a little for me

**ariiaaaa** (8.5): oooooo we love a subtle remix with harder drops

**bbfan132** (8.5): this version is better, the mixing isn’t as bad and verite fits in very well here

**bright\_baby\_blue** (8.5): Don't think it really adds anything to the original.

**bulforster** (8.5): Unnecessary remix, not a great sign that I didn't get that Verite was another vocalist on the song until I looked it up. Still, it's built on the original which is great.

**Hielord** (8.5): Verite adds a new layer to the song that makes it slightly better, even if their voices are almost the same

**quenched** (8.5): this song’s melody and hook etc are so strong that it still goes off, even though this version with verite is definitely worse than the original

**thoeoe** (8.5): This is actually my first time listening to this version of the song or even knowing it exists. @ me but I'm a firm "delet this" for remixes as bonus tracks; True Love is Violent was the perfect closing track, this didn't need to be tacked on afterwards. But I'm glad the song exists because Verite's vocal delivery was cool.

**wholahaybrown** (8): Verite's voice is not very interesting so I'm docking a point

**geraldinewww** (7.5): i think i just like allie's voice better for this song?

**hunnybee12** (7): i can’t tell their voices apart most of the time. what was the point of this

**pigserpent** (7): The better version of the song, but for the most part it's still the same song and still a 7 as a result.

**iloveneonlights** (6): - Got better with the remix but it's still not my cup of tea

**MRACHNIE** (6): This is not a bad song as a stand-alone by any means, but when i hear the word "remix" attached to a song, i usually expect the song to be, you know, remixed, and not just have the second verse and parts of the pre-chorus/chorus/bridge be sung by a different artist without even minor lyrical/production alterations.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): I'm only giving this a low score because the remix is basically the same as the original song except Verite sings some of it. But her voice is very similar to Allie so it's hard to even notice at first...

**letsallpoo** (5): verite sounds horrible on this

**anothertown** (4): go on sis give us nothing

**skargardin** (4): I mean it's still Casanova, which is a bop by default but miss Vérité didn't do any exciting with ha verse, even though she fits quite well. Ultimately it's very underwhelming.

**n7cn7c** (3): verite adds nothing

**hikkaru** (10): This is probably my personal favourite from Era 1, I absolutely adore the brattiness of it and how that's reflected in both Kim's attitude and the synth work from Puke. It's super cool to see it get into the top 5 because for a while it was sitting beneath the few Tove deep cuts that made it into the top 10, which are good but NOT as good as this !!! In the end, Heart to Break beats it out as Kim's highest song, but her being the last artist with multiple songs is neat!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): The song that made me fall in love with Kim. An absolute classic to this DAY! The synths are just...chef’s kiss.

---

#I want all my clothes designer

**SideBTrack8** (11): The song that started it all, still her best

**thoeoe** (11): OH MY GOD UGH SO GOOD. Pure Pop bliss, plus this bitch actually got Paris in her video. I remember introducing my ex to various /r/popheads faves and telling her about this track and how funny the concept was, of her basically wanting a sugar daddy. Well like 3-4 months after she broke up with me she texted me with a spotify link to this one saying "is this that sugar daddy song?"

**alwayswords** (10): sugar daddy anthem

**Awkward\_King** (10): maybe my favourite kim song? might be malibu now but this is so good

**bbfan132** (10): we stan a bolded song on rym; the video is fun too

**Bendariaku89** (10): Even with a bad producer behind it, there’s a reason she started getting popular with this and subsequently Heart to Break. Quintessentially, it’s really good bubblegum pop. It’s the perfect blend of playful materialism with cynic narcissism played really well. I mean the easiest comparison to make with is Money by Poppy. Both really embody that style, but Poppy’s focuses on the latter, while Kim does the former. Also, notice a common similarity.

**ggodisawomann** (10): mmmfsdkfmsdkfj YES

**Hielord** (10): This is what plays when I'm having my sugar daddy fantasy dream

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): consumerist queen

**quenched** (10): it’s the popular / basic opinion, but this is the ONE. the summer bop, the smash, the classic. still one of kim’s best songs and one of the strongest debut singles for an artist period

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song being Kim's breakout hit feels appropriate af, it really captures that vibe she's going for, and it's just a bop through and through

**rickikardashian** (10): i dont think she could have chosen a better debut single. this song gives you a very clear taste of what you can expect from her music

**skargardin** (10): Living my full rich LA starlet fantasy while listening to this and i LOVE it

**twat\_brained** (10): [I love how she only censored one bad word despite using two](https://twitter.com/kimpetras/status/1067861246517465088)

**waluigiest** (10): THE MF ANTHEM

**bright\_baby\_blue** (9.7): I admit that this song took a while to grow on me, but I eventually embraced it in all its brattiness. The synths here are ridiculously catchy, and that opening "Oh!" will always stick with me. [Woo-Ah: 7/10]

**1998tweety** (9.5): Bop

**plastichaxan** (9.5): my brat anthem yup

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): A little too repetitive in an annoying way but other than that it’s sadly a bop, I think this is the first song I heard by Kim since it popped up in my discover weekly in mid 2018

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): Kim and I just want to be spoiled.

**ariiaaaa** (9.3): This is Heart to Break's better cousin, you're doing amazing sweetie

**anothertown** (9): Iconic track but I just realized that Say So instrumental is almost the exact same as this just with guitars instead of synths lol. Dr Luke repeating himself wbk

**bandnitos** (9): i overplayed it but it still goes off

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Ah, the song that almost made me stan Kim Petras. Almost.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Okay this a major bop. Lyrically it’s kind of simple and shallow but it’s such a mood idc

**lapascalia** (9): real catchy bubblegum pop

**ManofOranges** (9): It makes sense that anybody who starts out with a song like this would attract a bunch of gays as fans. Like listen to it! I was hooked the second I heard it.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): she snapped, obligatory FUCK DOCTOR LUKE!

**andrxwzsz** (8): She kinda peaked with this one

**nightjesus** (8): Ugh the dream tho.

**Stryxen** (8): I love her voice and the production is fun

**vayyiqra** (8): Kim said that she is a material girl and she is living in a material world

**fluviusfluit** (7.5): "I think it's got a good beat and you can dance to it"

#I really do NOT want it at all

**pigserpent** (7): This song vibes pretty hard but also the lyrics are super bratty so it's also annoying to listen to.

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): the best song on this project but even then it feels pretty lethargic

**SkyBlade79** (6): this sounds kinda like something lady gaga would make if gaga was more immature

**letsallpoo** (5): i wish this weren't so slow

**akanewasright** (2): I used to like this song more than I do now. The production is great (but I’m not factoring that into my score lol fuck Luke) and the verses and ad libs are top notch (skills that Kim would continue to hone in her later work), but like... the chorus is honestly weak. The lyrics are dumb, and it’s not that catchy.

**hikkaru** (10): Charli's top song ends up being a song that she's basically a feature on - cupcakke ABSOLUTELY steals the show here. For many, Charli's work with her showed what miss cupcakke is capable of as a rapper and her performance here is so fantastic. The transition between Charli's part being a bright synthy cute bop to cupcakke going absolutely OFF never gets old and it's easy to see why this is THE fan favourite from N1A. Ultimately however, Charli falls short of the top 3, and is the first artist to get the chop out of the four.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): An absolute classic, even if it is basically CupcakKe feat. Charli. Just pure unadulterated fun, and that ending? Pure euphoria and a perfect note to end this album on. Let’s all thank the lord that this managed to make top 4 (bc it almost didn’t!)

**bbfan132** (11): i remember seeing charli send cupcakke a tweet back in early 2017 (or 2016? i don’t remember) and i instantly knew that this would propel cupcakke’s career to heights that were unimaginable at times. seeing an unapologetically raunchy rapper who you couldn’t even talk about on the subreddit back in 2016 stealing the show on one of charli’s best songs was one of the best treats i could’ve received at the time. ag’s production here is perfect too, and without the outro, it wouldn’t be the perfect song that it is, but i am still so proud of cupcakke for showing everyone just how talented she is here. easy 11.

**bulforster** (11): Charli, Cupcakke AND Sophie all on one track? The power that that has, the intelligence that that has, the clearance that that has, the access that that has, the influence that that has, the international implications that that has. This is the song that got me into Charli having been a fan of Cupcakke and being a Charli fan is what made me find popheads, so without this song I wouldn't be here.

**n7cn7c** (11): HELLOUR????

**pigserpent** (11): The synth riff is crazy good, All of Charli's vocals lines sound like candy, and CupcakKe cuts into the song and gives the song impact. The only bad thing I can think of saying about this song is that the synths don't sound quite as impecable as they do in the Sophie demo.

**Stryxen** (11): this is the easiest choice i have ever made. my pussy is very brave 😌

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (11): the way this is the best song in the rate.

**AceSHF** (10): Iconic

**akanewasright** (10): One of the best Cupcakke songs, honestly. She really should get more featured artists on her choruses. The choruses she usually does kind of bring down her songs, but this chorus is spectacular, and her rap makes Charli feel like the featured artist. She’s one of Charli’s best collaborators, and I hope they continue to work together.

**alwayswords** (10): cupcakke kinda carrying

**anothertown** (10): Crazy how all of the best songs on this album were not made by ag cook

**bandnitos** (10): everyone listen to the original song too it's lightning lipgloss life by life sim

**bespectacIed** (10): Best song ever done in history. Modern hyperpop production executed flawlessly. Cupcakke is just a master of words and imagery. She lowkey carried this song but Charli's hooks are still sugary sweet brilliance

**CritneySpearz** (10): keep it sticky icky 💋

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This was obviously my most anticipated collab while waiting for the mixtape to drop and I was not disappointed. This felt more like a Cupcakke feat. Charli kind of song but whatever, this song is fucking fire.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Literally everything SOPHIE does is perfect, now with Cupcakke.

**fluviusfluit** (10): There are many albums that wish they had as great a closer as this one

**letsallpoo** (10): tfw i have to give this a 10 https://i.imgur.com/0X0gLDw.png

**ManofOranges** (10): The way CupcakKe just ate this whole song up. "We keep more eyes on us than the show iCarly." "Never trust a man who wears briefs cause he gonna wanna fucking keep it brief." "Pussy taste sweet cause I am a pineapple." Lyrical masterpiece, someone please give CupcakKe an award.

**Misentro** (10): Definitely the standout of the album. The "MMM-HM!" is so cheeky and CupcakKe's lyrics are brilliant!

**plastichaxan** (10): their joint slay... i have no choice but to stan

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the life sim production... iconic

**quenched** (10): the best song on the album i don’t make the rules, i just enforce them. cupcakke really snapped on this, shes the highlight of the song for sure, though charli still did her thing ofc

**racloves** (10): no comment needed

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): iconic

**sandyfishnets** (10): best song on the album. IT'S CHARLI BABY!

**skargardin** (10): what a way to end the album, like go off whew

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): the iCarly line alone

**thoeoe** (10): Absolutely ICONIC! That synth just runs and runs, Cupcakke serving incredible flow and incredible lines as always.

**yatcho** (10): Cupcakke absolutely demolished this feature. I need her on more hyperpop productions

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): Look, I’m basic. Anytime you got cupcakKe, I’ll fucking love the song.

**MRACHNIE** (9.5): Thank God for SOPHIE. Unlike many other collaborations in this rate, this feels like an actual collaboration and not like lazily putting a verse by an artist over a finished song by another artist.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): slapper

**lapascalia** (9): i had heard this song was iconic… and the rumours are true

**nightjesus** (9): These LYRICS have me LIVING. CupcakKe is s GOOD on this.

**pat-rickstar** (9): CupcakKe kills it as usual

**shesdoingyoga** (9): The “rot your teeth” lyric kind of makes me uncomfortable with the imagery, but other than that, bop! I love CupcakKe’s delivery on this

**SkyBlade79** (9): absolutely iconic cupcakke verse holy shit. Idk why charli acts like a pokemon at the end but it’s still good

**waluigiest** (9): iconic closer

**1998tweety** (8.5): Cupcakke might be racist but I must admit...she kinda ate this up.

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.8): The production on this song is so fun-- there's a lot going on even for a Charli song. CupcakKe's verses don't fit into the track as nicely as I would like them to, but it's still a bop. And I find the end really relaxing.

**geraldinewww** (7.5): love you cupcakke

**andrxwzsz** (7): It's CupcakKe's song, why lie?

**ggodisawomann** (7): lmao

**Hielord** (7): I didn't like it at first but it grew on me a lot, it's fun

#iCarly stans

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love Cupcakke’s part but Charli’s chorus is corny af. So I’m going to have to drop some points for that

**mayolizard** (7): i keep it sticky icky

**vayyiqra** (7): Yes this is a bop but also I never quite got that hyped about it. It's a fun party song in the fine tradition of "horny electronic sex jam", but I can't say it's one of Charli's best songs. Still, a bop is a bop so I can't hate it.

**ariiaaaa** (6): I think I heard a remix of this last week that cut cupcakKe out, somehow she's very refreshing here which is odd because I'm not a cupcakKe stan, maybe i could be lol

**TiltControls** (6): ok, but CupCakKe's sections completely outshine the rest of the song

**selegend** (5): sounds like a cupcakke mashup

**RandomHypnotica** (4.6): I appreciate Cupcakke's style, but it really just ain't for me

**cremeebrulee** (4): the xcx part is good and then everything after that isn't

hikkaru: # Number 1 Angel

---

**Overall Average**: 7.679 **// Average Controversy:** 1.869

---

**hikkaru** (8.450): This mixtape is so overlooked due to the existence of Pop 2 but basically the whole thing is a serve and it deserves better. Just because it stays closer to standard electropop instead of going full experimental doesn't mean it is bad! It's nice to finally see one of her mixtapes rated though, and hopefully we can see Pop 2 have her time to shine one day as well.

**worlds-okayest666** (9.250): I feel like this often gets overshadowed by Pop 2, which really sucks bc it has some absolute iconic moments. Admittedly, some of it IS a bit weaker, but when it bops...it bops HARD. I think it’s a pretty damn good album overall, especially considering it was made in 2 weeks total. Her power...

---
**PointlessBibliophage** (9.450): a cultural reset

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9.200): I remember when the mixtape dropped and I was on volunteer duty for a two-week long event. I arrived at work quite early to avoid the traffic so I spent two hours before my first shift listening to this album. I can visualize how Charli felt during this time when she recently went through a break-up. It feels very bedroom pop because of the isolation she felt during the recording. Up to this day, I feel like Number 1 Angel aged very well three years after its release. I was kinda sad that this felt underrated compared to Pop 2 but both mixtapes complement well with each other. Number 1 Angel continues to my favorite Charli project to this date because it feels so cohesive in its sound.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8.970): the way this album is pop perfection. Her serve!

**ManofOranges** (8.600): I feel like I'm only one of like 10 bitches on this sub who think that Number 1 Angel is the superior mixtape over Pop 2. Like I think Pop 2 has a few moments that wow me, but it doesn't really have anything on the consistency and quality that this mixtape has. The first six tracks are all very, very good and very enjoyable. I do think it takes a little dip after ILY2 but it still finishes very strong with Lipgloss. In my opinion, this is Charli at her best, at some middle ground between a pop style and her current PC music style.

**pigserpent** (8.600): Not her most experimental, but the Queen is still laying down bops for days. It might actually be my favorite Charli album.

**thoeoe** (8.100): Some people call this the perfect blend of PC sound and a more traditional pop sound, while others just see it as a stepping stone in Charli's eventual evolution. This is definitely the Charli album I throw on if I want solid pop songwriting without wanting to truly WILD out.

**skargardin** (8.000): This is honestly one of my least favorite Charli projects BUT it's got some bops for sure. In the grand scheme of things its not hard to see why this has become largely forgotten in her discography.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.900): Charli, please collab with Sophie again.

**hunnybee12** (7.650): one of my least favorite charli projects. I loved it at the time and there are some bangers, but a good portion of the tracks are forgettable to me

**racloves** (7.300): my cat is called Charlie so I always sing all the “it’s charli baby’s” at him

**vayyiqra** (7.200): This album (I refuse to acknowledge this "mixtape" business) is very okay. That's really all I can say about it. It has some catchy bops, it has vibes, and it's never actively bad. However, I've never put it high on my tier list of Charli projects, putting it below True Romance (which I love) and maybe even below Sucker (which I think is overhated). It's not a bad project, it just doesn't have much to pull me back to it often. I still love "Babygirl" though.

**andrxwzsz** (7.200): 7.5/10 for me (Pop 2 is superior)

**bright\_baby\_blue** (6.960): There aren't as many individually great songs on here as Charli's later albums, but it's still really cohesive. The atmosphere of the album is pretty unique-- it feels big / theatrical, but also intimate? The interesting production in it allows me to tolerate some of the more repetitive songs.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.190): Revisiting this album has really improved my perception of it, the first time I listened to it (just after Pop 2 released) I thought it was clearly just a lesser version of that, but now I see how wrong I was. It's still not my favourite Charli album but I certainly appreciate it more

**Misentro** (6.100): It has some strong moments, but IMO Charli really hit her stride with Pop 2, this one's still a little half-baked.

**mayolizard** (5.900): is it bad i have literally no strong emotions listening to this album? I just feel so neutral. Besides dreamer i really didn't love any other track

**ariiaaaa** (5.140): I don't get the hype around Charli, she's never been able to grab me and my hipster ass has avoided her because of it, here's to giving her a shot

**bespectacIed** (5.100): I used to like N1A and view it as such an innovative record. Sadly this didn't age well to me, mostly because charli oversaturated her future records with pc music production. This is such a comedown from the brilliance of True Romance and a reaffirmation of Charli's songwriting ineptitude that she showed with Sucker. Half of the songs here I can't stand to listen to anymore

**hikkaru** (10): This was the first Kim song I heard, back when it released, and oh my lord was that a fun week long period of time where I wasn't privy to who produced all of her songs! This is pure pop bliss in the most appealing-to-the-gays way and ultimately it ends up at #3 as Kim's highest song, even beating out subreddit darling Charli. This song peaked at #2 in the rate but ultimately Tove and Allie won out.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): I used to think this was overhyped, but now...I get it. This bops HARD. If this was released in 2010, it would have been a smash hit...I know it.

---

#Gonna give you my heart to break

**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): If Carly has RAWM, Kim has this, and I'd be very surprised if she will release anything close to such high quality in the near future

**1998tweety** (10): Contender for my 11, pop perfection. Luke can do no wrong when it comes to music huh.

**AceSHF** (10): Kim's voice and personality really shines on this one. 'I'll give you my heart to break' somehow sounds both cynical and naive at the same time.

**alwayswords** (10): the song that got me into her <3

**anothertown** (10): That bitch is a classic..

**astrologicalangel** (10): this song is like part of my DNA by now

**Awkward\_King** (10): its just such a good pop song

**bandnitos** (10): this is a white gay anthem but i can't blame them its a great song

**bbfan132** (10): i don’t know what else to say besides “this is a massive bop and i love it just as much as i did when i first heard it”

**Bendariaku89** (10): It’s really good bubblegum pop, what can anyone say really. There’s a reason she blew up somewhat with this song. It does make me wish she went with this style much more than trap music. Also, the producer is NOT good, but this is a really well-made song regardless. I won’t blame people for listening, it IS a good song.

**ggodisawomann** (10): my first Kim song, love it forever

**pigserpent** (10): If you're going to be late to trends, you need to work harder than anyone was during the heyday to compete with the older songs. This song does just that, and even makes a lot of the electropop softer than the turn of the decade sound so that it'll age more gracefully.

**plastichaxan** (10): she's full of serves i hate being morally conflicted by enjoying her music

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the fact that this song is so good i forgot "shatters" isn't a fucking noun

**quenched** (10): i mean cmon....this is a classic. i’ll be so shook if this doesn’t make top 10 / 15 ish. it’s just so infectious and i get put in a good mood everytime i hear it. too bad nicky and heidi gave us such a boring lip sync with it 💀💀

**rickikardashian** (10): someone once commented that if Kim wasn’t able blow up with this song, she wouldn’t blow up with anything, which is a mean thing to say. With that being said, if Kim wasn’t able to blow up with this song, she won’t blow up with anything

**SideBTrack8** (10): The song that introduced me to Kim, for which I will be forever grateful

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection yup yup

**thoeoe** (10): Yes Yes Yes, it's so hard to pick a best track between this and I Don't Want It At All but I had to concede. This was my "anthem" on my Tinder profile when I still used that because 1000% relatable, lots of hurt emotions after 4 weeks but whatever. I crack my voice every time straining to sing along because wowowow.

**TiltControls** (10): more catchy than it has any right to be

**twat\_brained** (10): one time on Valentine's Day, exactly a year to the song's release, I waited for 3 hours just to perform this at a karaoke bar. if I want to make it as a pop hoe I need to get used to that sort of thing and truly learn patience

**untutorable** (10): ok i fucking love this song but someone has to say that this was a horrible choice for a lipsync song in season 12 of drag race

**waluigiest** (10): i don’t think it’s hyperbole to say this is a perfect pop song. Everything from its lyrics to its shape to its production to its instrumentals is just so squeaky clean and fun.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): one of the best songs in the rate purr.

**yatcho** (10): This could've gone on Teenage Dream and easily been a #1 hit

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This song is too damn good to give it lower than a 9 because I really loved the production here. Fuck you Dr. L**e.

**Hielord** (9): Fun bop, the high notes are the highlight of the song

**hunnybee12** (9): I decided I wouldn’t give any 10s to dr.l*ke tracks and this is testing my morals

**ManofOranges** (9): I feel like this song is very good, but it's not as good as some of the others here for me. I think it's just a little too.... I don't know. But it doesn't quite take me there completely.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): Kim’s charismatic vocal delivery takes this undeniable bop to the next level

**vayyiqra** (9): :broken_heart:

**bulforster** (8.5): A tad overrated.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It’s good but I feel like it’s missing something

**Stryxen** (8.5): great song for dancing at home and she has a lot of fun with this

**fluviusfluit** (8): Lowkey there are too many bangers here it shouldn't be allowed

**lapascalia** (8): that bridge is really nice

**SkyBlade79** (8): this song kinda good you can’t even argue legally

**andrxwzsz** (7): Cute :)

#Broken

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.8): The kick drum in this song is killer, as is the hook. I'm not sure why I don't like this song more. Too repetitive, maybe? [Woo-Ah: 8/10]

**MRACHNIE** (7.5): While the production is one of the best of any Kim song, the execution is a bit confusing, as the fact that it has a prominent unchanging drum pattern going through it somewhat takes away from the anthemic vibe the song's chorus is going for.

**ariiaaaa** (6.2): im kinda sick of this song but like listen its an iconic one, very escapist for me

**TragicKingdom1** (6): uneventful with really empty production

**akanewasright** (3): This song got VERY much overplayed for me. I started to get burned out with the song, and then my radio station picked it up and I just got sick of it.

**selegend** (2): kim petras sifts through katy perry’s rejects pile after katy cuts ties with dr luke click here to see more

**bespectacIed** (0): Was never a fan of this, too annoying and shouty. This song reminds me of racism kinda

hikkaru: # Era 1

---

**Overall Average**: 7.140 **// Average Controversy:** 2.058

---

**hikkaru** (6.955): Kim is very hit or miss for me and that shows on this project. There's quite a lot here that is unremarkable, but that doesn't stop it from having a few absolute smashes. Of course, the elephant in the room is that she decided to work with a rapist on the production and songwriting which really makes this deservedly controversial. Despite the discourse she is a subreddit darling in a way and that's why I felt it apt for her to be represented in a rate. 

**worlds-okayest666** (8.909): A controversial album, and for due reason, but I honestly really love this. Kim pulls off the 2010s synth-pop sound really well and there’s some absolute bangers here. I just wish it was released as an actual album instead of the single-by-single rollout...so messy and makes it very easy for people to dismiss this, unfortunately. I also wish it wasn’t produced by Dr L*ke but that’s a whole other story!

---
**SideBTrack8** (9.682): If she actually made this an album it would probably be my most scrobbled, it's just SO GOOD

**thoeoe** (9.091): I just CANNOT with how 100% flawless the entire run of songs is. 10/10

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.773): i like this stuff more than anything she's done since tbh, unfortunately this does mean that as collateral damage i've given dr.l*ke wayyy too many 10s

**Kushasters** (8.727): I'm sorry that my Kim stan bias is showing through so hard, I tried being as fair as I could :/

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8.500): I went in expecting to hate-listen and hate on Dr L*ke, but this ended up being one of the best collections of pop songs in the 2010s and I continued to be a clown

**rickikardashian** (8.436): no kim, dont work with dr l*ke ur so sexy ahaha

**RandomHypnotica** (8.227): I don't know how I feel about this as a project as a whole, I wish we had an official tracklist to follow, and it kind of just lacks cohesion as an album since, well, it isn't, but the songs individually all feel pretty strong

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8.136): some the highs of this era are really high, but the not good songs are so boring

**twat\_brained** (7.945): really disappointed not to see Close Your Eyes here :/

**ManofOranges** (7.727): I am somewhat ashamed of how many of the tracks from this era I really, truly like. I Don't Want It At All, Slow It Down, Hillside Boys, Heart to Break, they're all tracks that are very good which is just all the more disappointing when I think about the man who produced them. If I didn't know who produced these songs, they would probably have higher scores, but I do know, so I docked points off almost all of them on the basis that they make me feel guilty anytime I listen to them and I don't want that! I only gave 10s to Slow It Down and Hillside Boys because they were too good for me to not and they're my favorites out of all of these songs.

**vayyiqra** (7.636): I realize it's from the same time as the rest of this rate, but it feels odd to be rating a bunch of singles instead of a proper album. However, it's also Kim we're rating, who deserves it as a Popheads fave. I was very late to getting into her music, but there are undeniable bops that abound here. I might say I like it more than Clarity, which is good. This is maybe the most underrated part of the rate and the one I am least familiar with although I have heard all of it before. Also, as an aside, that neon aesthetic really fucked.

**waluigiest** (7.636): this is the musical version of dessert. some of it is empty, some of it is delicious and rich, but you would never eat it for dinner. And that’s okay!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.636): Her career took a nosedive after those last three singles from the era.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.455): I really liked Kim Petras but I couldn’t bring myself to listen to her voluntarily when she had a contract with him amidst the legal battle with Kesha. It’s such a shame because her music is actually really good and I think she definitely gives out main pop girl vibes. On “Era 1” itself, it’s really strange to release all of the songs from this era as singles and call it an era. I guess this is just following the “single droplets” approach, which I have mixed feelings over because I am more of “a full album drop” kind of guy. Anyways, if this was constructed as an album, I would criticize this as incohesive. Some of the songs felt unforgettable that I couldn’t believe some of them were released as singles. Anyways, Era 1 had the highest highs that showed Petras with potential, but lowest lows that dragged her back.

**hunnybee12** (7.455): I haven’t listened to kim in a while, man do I wish the circumstances were different :/

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.200): It's not an amazing release, but there are some real pop gems in here. I'd say every song is significantly catchier than average. Some of the songs are kind of junk, but overall it's just a really fun body of work.

**Misentro** (6.955): Up and down. The high energy pop bangers are incredible, but everything else feels generic and forgettable.

**racloves** (6.909): all these songs slap tbh

**andrxwzsz** (6.727): 7.0/10 for me

**ariiaaaa** (6.709): I am a Kim Petras fan so I hope im not too biased here because I even prefer era 1 to Clarity. era 1 is just very bubblegum pop escapism and we need it in 2020

**Stryxen** (6.545): activates private session on spotify

**skargardin** (6.455): A cohesive project filled with bops and some.. major misses that we pretend we do not see. I do feel shame whenever I choose to play her music though.

**mayolizard** (6.227): this is her most generic music to me sob

**geraldinewww** (6.091): tbh my scores are lower for this because of dr luke. i don't know a ton about kim petras and don't listen to her much so i hope she stops (or can stop? idk what her contracts are like) working with him soon

**richbitchjuice** (5.864): hear me out, I ADORE TOLT (2019 top 10 for me) but never really got into this era, I’ll give it another listen tho lol

**bespectacIed** (4.000): Never got into Kim's music, it's sooo catered to white gays, it's revolting. What's funny is no one even needs to wish for kim's karma to come with working with redacted; she's always gonna be a struggling pop star so what's the point. I love the era's different colored neon cover art though, so simple but so visually appealing.

**selegend** (3.091): i mean not only are the songs produced by a rapist, they’re just… awful songs! but also… they’re produced by a rapist! stream Feeling of Falling

hunnybunchesofhoes: I’m not defending Dr. L*ke or Kim by any means, but why are people gonna do this rate if they’re not gonna listen to her songs and just rate her poorly solely for working with him

If you’re so against him, then don’t do the rate or rank on her vocal performance/lyrics and ignore production. It’s so weird to see her get so much flack when Doja gave him a #1 and I saw barely anyone in the rap girls rate say anything.💀

urfavgalpal: I ended up not doing the rate because I didn’t want to give Luke the streams, but tbh if I had Kim’s scores definitely would have taken a hit from me because of him.  It honestly makes her songs less enjoyable to listen to.

hunnybunchesofhoes: That’s why I didn’t participate either! However, if I had, I’d try to be as objective as possible. I noticed a few users in the comments of the songs scores, who had nothing to say about the song itself, and would just say stuff about her working with Doctor L*ke. They would do this for all her songs, and not even say a single thing about the artistic elements. That I find a bit immature and dumb, as you aren’t obligated to rate, and if you choose to participate in the rate at least TRY to be fair.

**hikkaru** (10): This was the first Allie song I heard and from the very first listen I was absolutely hooked. The synth work here is stunning and ridiculously infectious, with the building rise to the chorus never getting old. Even to this day I consider it to be Allie's best song (and for sure better than the remix) that I'm not sure it's possible for her to ever top because it's just that good. If disco tits wasn't in the rate this would be an incredibly easy 11 decision for me and who knows, maybe it'll get that in All Stars 4! But for the time being, Allie falls short to the juggernaut that is Tove Lo's disco tits. A valiant effort was put in for sure, with Casanova getting a respectable average of 9.0, but it just was not enough.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): A smash HIT (in certain parts of Canada)! And a deserved one at that; it’s one of her best and by far an album highlight. Happy to see this get the recognition it deserves.

---

#Casanova, fuck me over

**vayyiqra** (11): Anti-Fuckboy Aktion. What a bop!

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, deserved to smash

**364unbirthdays** (10): Iconique

**akanewasright** (10): This is the best song on the album. I could see this (or its remix) pulling a Slumber Party. I have to imagine that most of her tracks are going out very early, but this one slaps too hard to not be a 10. Every other stan group is going to split their 11s.

**Bendariaku89** (10): It’s just a really great dance-pop song with some interesting production choices. I can already imagine the dance in my head.

**bespectacIed** (10): "casanova fucked me ova" is such a killer line. Gorgeous song, I prefer the remix a bit

**bulforster** (10): I'm normally quite stingy with 10s on rate albums I'm listening to for the first time but this was clearly a 10 from the first listen.

**fluviusfluit** (10): One Hail Mary for this to appear in the top 10

**ggodisawomann** (10): mmm

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I think this is electropop perfection.

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a hit your honor. Love this song.

**Misentro** (10): Truly a perfect pop song. It's catchy, it's fun, the lyrics are well-written, and the production is brilliantly understated. It really shows off Allie's range, the transition from belting the pre-chorus to the almost monotone chorus is such a good twist, and then that last chorus just lets it all out.

**mudkip1** (10): what a SONG

**nightjesus** (10): Baby I am sorry, not sorry, that I prefer this version over the feature. It’s so smooth. The production is just flawless. It hasn’t aged at all three years later.

**pat-rickstar** (10): BOP couldn't decide between original and remix so just picked one randomly.

**quenched** (10): this is one of the best songs in the rate. CASANOVA FUCKED ME OVER LEFT ME DYING FOR YOUR LOVE CASANOVA CASANOVA NOW YOURE ALL IM THINKING OFF

**rickikardashian** (10): the highlight of the album, and by far

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song works surprisingly well swapped with the instrumental from Into You

**twat\_brained** (10): now THIS is a hit! why was I hearing this on the radio but not Girl of the Year? CRTC is a flop but we already knew that😘

**yatcho** (9.9): Only because the remix is slightly better

**lapascalia** (9.5): groovy and relatable

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): BOP

**Stryxen** (9.5): BOP although the pre chorus is very generic

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): This song just feels so good, like the smuggest fuck you imaginable

**bandnitos** (9): a bop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The chorus shows how clever of a songwriter Allie X is.

**mayolizard** (9): top tier chorus

**thoeoe** (9): This song is a "heavenly creature." Bop city, everything from the bridge to the ending is primo. And gender swap everyone and it's a vvv relatable mood for my life.

**waluigiest** (9): funky lil song!!

**bright\_baby\_blue** (8.5): This energy on this track is noticeably higher than the rest of the album. The prechorus rivals "Paper Love", and the production on the chorus is better. The bridge and echo-y outro are nice touches.

**geraldinewww** (8.5): the only example of a song i liked better than its unsolved mix. this one is fun

**Hielord** (8.2): What a BOP

**andrxwzsz** (8): Prefer the acoustic demo, but still great

**anothertown** (8): I feel like this could have smashed with the right promo..

**ariiaaaa** (8): I'm getting the feeling synth is kind of her thing (I mean it is an electropop playlist) as someone who's only wanted to listen to 100 gecs and SOPHIE for a week straight this is very refreshing, also relatable to me

**costalhp** (8): I know I'm a cliche, but this is the track that made me love Allie and is still one of my favorite songs by her.

**n7cn7c** (8): piano version was better but she is that gworl

**skargardin** (8): she's a boppy for sure

#Vérité stans

**bbfan132** (8): i enjoyed this quite a bit but the vocal mixing is off in the second verse and it throws the whole song off for me

**SkyBlade79** (8): this feels kinda empty without verité ngl

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.6): I think enjoy the original and remix version more than this one. I can’t offer any explanation.

**AceSHF** (7.5): Why listen to this when the remix exists?

**pigserpent** (7): Pretty groovy, but the niche it plays into is a popular one with a long list of songs that do this but better. This song gets a bonus point because it has a strong finish between the synths that lead off the bridge and the vocals on the last chorus.

**plastichaxan** (6.8): this loses a lot of appeal after the remix oop

**racloves** (6): I don’t love it but don’t hate it

**Solovrinne** (6): The feature version completely outsold the album one.

**iloveneonlights** (5): - I think the song just went nowhere

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): maybe its because I heard the remix first but this just sounds a little empty, especially the end

hikkaru: # CollXtion II

---

**Overall Average**: 7.699 **// Average Controversy:** 1.725

---

**hikkaru** (7.682): I stated in my comment for the song that I believe Casanova is Allie's absolute best and I'm not sure if she'll be able to top that, and that's a big reason why I like this album quite a bit and am lower on Super Sunset and Cape God. In the end, Allie loses to Tove but she gets a higher album average so good for her! 

**worlds-okayest666** (9.227): I like CollXtion I a bit more than this, but this is still really solid and it has some of my favorite Allie songs on it. And honestly, quite a few of the songs on here deserved to be full-on hits (and I don’t get why they weren’t). I do think she’s improved since this tho, especially with Cape God, but her talent still shines through, even on the weaker songs.

---
**PointlessBibliophage** (9.364): such a pleasant listen

**mudkip1** (9.273): this album is amazing imo. only thing that I don't like about it is that it throws me back to a weird point of my life where i was still growing as a person. i made a lot of dumb decisions around the time this album dropped so it's on the back of my mind whenever i listen to it now sndkvjs

**Misentro** (9.273): It's not an easy choice, but I think overall this is still Allie's strongest body of work. It has some of my favourite production moments I've ever heard, especially in Simon Says and Old Habits. Every song sounds so fresh and different but the whole album has a clear unifying sound and theme. I really had to fight myself to not just give 10s across the board.

**vayyiqra** (9.091): What a great album by a unique artist. I've been lucky to follow Allie since the beginnings of her career as a solo artist with the release of CollXtion I (which is great, stream it) and she managed to improve on it with this LP. I remember listening to it for the first time when it dropped in the summer of 2017 and ever since then I can't help but associate it with summertime. And in trademark Allie style, it still has a dark undertone to its lyrics that's balanced by its brighter moments.

**ManofOranges** (8.818): CollXtion II is the only body of work in here that I hadn't heard in full up until now so that I could do the rate. I was kinda worried it would disappoint but it actually did not! At least for me I find it to be on par with the quality of the rest of the songs in this rate, if not a little above average at times. I'm glad that I finally listened to this.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.500): I remember listening to this album the day before Allie X’s iconic AMA on the subreddit. If it weren’t for that AMA, I would not have listened to this album. The album is backed with some clever pop songwriting and unique production. This is definitely an album that aged really well.

**AceSHF** (8.364): A pretty solid album. Although I'm hesitant to call it her best as all of her albums are in the same ballpark for me. A few songs sound a bit filler-y but nothing egregious.

**pat-rickstar** (8.273): Never listened to Allie before this rate, now I want to check out her other albums, so thanks for introducing me to her!

**skargardin** (8.091): My second to favorite Allie project, a couple of missteps but this really showed how sharp her lyrics are if anything, plus it bops, what more could you want.

**thoeoe** (7.955): I never got why this album was so contentious in her discography among fans. The highs are just as high as CollXtion I even if they're a bit more sparse with a slightly more laid-back vibe.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.882): overall I really liked the album. Though I will say there are too many downtempo song. I would say Super Sunset is my fave Allie X album.

**andrxwzsz** (7.818): 8.0/10 for me

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.636): Cape God was way more impressive.

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.564): This is the first pop album I really got into, so it has a special place in my heart. I really appreciated how Allie X focused on bass + production in addition to vocals. It set the bar high for future pop albums, and is definitely still in my top 10.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.536): I feel like every project by Allie has increased in quality as they go, and whilst this is still a very solid project, I feel like it lacks a bit of personality that Allie really nails in her later work

**hunnybee12** (7.455): I’ve never listened to allie x before this, and I can see why she’s popular. I just cant really see myself going back to this album now because it’s so attached to the indie pop trends of 3-4 years ago that I’m kinda over at this point

**mrmoody112** (7.273): her second best album.

**mayolizard** (7.136): this grew on me!

**bulforster** (6.864): The first four songs are great but I don't really love anything afterwards.

**racloves** (6.500): is it bad if I admit I haven’t really listened to this album before so these are my first opinions as I’m listening to it so

**bespectacIed** (6.455): why she wearing a KKK hat

**ariiaaaa** (5.627): this is my first time listening to this album and artist (also first rate), really hype

**pigserpent** (4.909): My first impression of Allie X, and it's not great. Sounds like a coorperate mandated attempt at aping the styles of a few other pop artists, and I'm left with no impression of her personality other than almost being tangentially dark.

**hikkaru** (11): And so Miss Tove gets the win! This was... not unexpected in the slightest to be honest. That showed as the scores came in through the weeks, because this did not leave #1 at ALL. While it's not the most exciting thing ever as far as rate results go, this song definitely deserves. It's my favourite from Tove and one of my most played songs ever.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): This was a VERY obvious choice for the winner but god, is it absolutely deserved. A banger from start-to-finish and dare I say...her best song. I mean, come on, you KNOW a song called “disco tits” is gonna be good but this still exceeds expectations. A perfect song, honestly.

#I'M FULLY CHARGED NIPPLES ARE HARD READY TO GO

**akanewasright** (11): I love Charli, but this is one of the best pop songs of last decade. This song makes almost every 9 and 10 in this rate look like a 6. I’ve played the shit out of this song, but I’ve never gotten sick of it. It’s superlative.

**alwayswords** (11): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/657401856884080670/724839616548700190/image0.jpg

**Awkward\_King** (11): nipples: hard

**bespectacIed** (11): The cultural reset that had reset all the other cultural resets. Bitches is my fave song in this entire rate but this has to win.

**costalhp** (11): I wish I could rate the intro as well, but anyways this is my favorite song out of all the songs on this rate. I can't explain how much I love Tove Lo and this song, it takes me places.

**cremeebrulee** (11): definitely the most iconic song in this rate. i wasn't immediately infatuated with this song, but it grew on me quickly and now i love it

**fluviusfluit** (11): And I'm feeling bi rights in this Chili's tonight

**geraldinewww** (11): the last concert i went to pre-corona was the sunshine kitty tour and i miss tove and her disco tits

**Hielord** (11): This is pure pop perfection. The bass, the vocals, the feeling, omfg. Diva anthem, dance club anthem, hoe anthem, AN ANTHEM, and a deserved 11.

**hunnybee12** (11): h*rny anthem yup

**ignitethephoenix** (11): No one else could do this song except Tove. It’s an iconic bop and one of the best songs she has done. I wish it was more popular

**lapascalia** (11): i think this is tove’s best song to date

**ManofOranges** (11): This song is just so iconic. Graduations, weddings, funerals... are places where it will not be played because it's probably too vulgar for those events but that does not detract from the fact that this song is so good it's orgasmic.

**Misentro** (11): One of the best songs I'll ever have the pleasure of listening to. Instantly and forever iconic. The gold standard of horny pop. I can't say enough about this song. The production is like nothing I've ever heard and it sells that drunk in the club feeling perfectly. The whole song sounds like it's being played through a wall while you give yourself a lecture in the bathroom mirror.

**plastichaxan** (11): listen there are many 10s in this rate but i have never decided an 11 so easily

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Everything about this song is perfection.

**shesdoingyoga** (11): This was always going to be my 11. This is an absolute bop, literal perfection, and the line “I’m no chemist, but it’s good shit” is funny to me because I’m technically a chemist. If I end up in charge of the music at a party and I’ve had enough to drink, I will put this song on and nobody will be able to stop me

**skargardin** (11): imagine having a title THIS iconic and basically, discounting the intro, opening ur album? There's no choice but to stan. Everything about this song is so.. weird and so distinctively Tove Lo down to a T.

**Tedyonce** (11): one of the best songs of last decade.

**twat\_brained** (11): Tove Lo's best song. Better than Habits. sadly though my nipples have never hardened while listening to this.

**waluigiest** (11): This song activates a primal beast that lives deep inside of me. From the opening “I say hi you say hi....” I’m transported out of my body into an effervescent experience that is unlike anything I’ve felt on this planet. Every syncopated synth hit is another hammer strike to my sad, horny, hungry brain. This song is sex, and I’m insatiable.

**yatcho** (11): This song just activates something in me, I NEED to be in a sweaty club as soon as it hits. Iconic video too

**1998tweety** (10): I'm horny

**AceSHF** (10): I wasn't Automatically In Love with this one but I come back to it quite frequently. The chorus is alright but the rest of the song is absolutely immaculate.

**andrxwzsz** (10): A perfect electropop song, it's that simple

**anothertown** (10): fuck!!!!!!

**bandnitos** (10): one of her best

**bbfan132** (10): the video is iconic but i loved this song instantly, that chorus is perfection (and so is the bridge). please don’t rob it, everyone!!!!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Production wise, it feels unlike Tove Lo but the songwriting really made this a Tove Lo song. Overall, one of her best songs in her discography.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Your Disco Tits Need You.

**ggodisawomann** (10): almost my 11, I literally loved this the second I heard it and it has never been soiled for me

**mayolizard** (10): mother fucking queen of disco tits !

**MRACHNIE** (10): While this song is incredible, the fact that the phrase “disco tits” is not actually part of the lyrics is what keeps it from being an 11.

**quenched** (10): masterpiece. the runner up for my 11. this song will predictably win (most likely), but it so deserves it. one of my fav singles of the decade

**rickikardashian** (10): throwback to that one thread that was like “AU: After a long hiatus, Taylor Swift releases her long-awaited comeback single, Disco Tits. What happens next?” that has left me with the need of hearing her cover this.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): hypnotic bop tbh

**SkyBlade79** (10): this is such an amazing chill bop. Just calms me down while making me happy, it’s amazing

**Stryxen** (10): wait hold on I forgot how good this song is. I need two 11s

**thoeoe** (10): The first Tove Lo show I ever went to was also the first concert she did right after this single dropped and it was FUCKING LIT. That show set a new bar for fun at a concert that has only been bested by Kim Petras shows. Somewhere I have a video of my father, a bigshot attorney, the ultimate white 50s man, dancing to this song with a huge martini in his hands. If I didn't feel bad about breaching his privacy I'd share it but I show it to allll of my friends it's amazing.

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes this is a bop. But is it the best song in this rate, or is it just a fun slutbop? Of course, these possibilities are not mutually exclusive. You decide.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): it’s incredible.

**richbitchjuice** (9.9): I have the original AND Oliver remix on the same workout playlist, that’s how much I love this song

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): can't believe i enjoyed this with my two christian ears

**Bendariaku89** (9): Very iconic but could benefit from a little more variation as it can get quite repetitive at times. What’s enjoyable about this is how effortlessly sultry and nonchalant it feels while still giving that dance vibe. I don’t hate the lyrics surprisingly, but I see why people might not like it. The title speaks for itself, disco and tits, depends on how much you can handle that.

**nightjesus** (9): I’M FULLY CHARGED NIPPLES ARE HARD READY TO GO

#nipples are not hard

**TragicKingdom1** (8): good but idk why it's so loved. cool girl is the superior lead single

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.4): I like this song, but I don't think it lives up to the hype. The opening seconds hold so much promise, but the song ends up being kind of... same-y? but uh that's just my opinion don't hurt me plz

**pigserpent** (7): The instrumental is pretty cool, even if I don't care much for the vocals

**iloveneonlights** (6): - I never liked disco sorry not sorry

**selegend** (5): we get it tove you have boobs and a vagina you like sex and drugs

**ariiaaaa** (4.5): wait this is that song????? welp I retract my previous statement, I've either heard this in the club or on tiktok, this song is a grower, you can tell

**bulforster** (4.5): The chorus is catchy as hell but in a way that I find incredibly annoying.

**pat-rickstar** (0): Sorry Tove stans but this music video scarred me and now this song makes me so uncomfortable when I listen to it

Disco Tits could’ve been that much higher but you gave it a zero. I can’t. I feel empty on the inside from being so traumatized. You ought to feel ashamed from this.

**hikkaru** (8.577): This is my favourite Tove album for just how it's unabashedly raw electropop perfection. Well, the first half anyways - it does lose some steam after the interlude before closing out with one of Tove's best tracks. In the end this is the album the winner comes from and I couldn't be happier as it's for sure my favourite project in this rate.

**worlds-okayest666** (8.692): My favorite Tove album. The first half is just smash after smash after smash after smash and I love it. The second half is for sure the weaker one, but even then, the songwriting on it is still immaculate for the most part and it has hey you got drugs?, which automatically stops it from flopping. Overall a pretty great album, and I really hope she goes in this direction again in the future (although I did like Sunshine Kitty!)

---
**ManofOranges** (9.385): It should be criminal how good this album. Especially the front half. Hit after hit after hit after hit after hit. It's non-stop! It's a shame this flopped at release but given the amount of times I've listened to it since it came out, I don't think it could be considered a flop anymore. Tove Lo really created something special.

**thoeoe** (9.038): I have always been a sucker for women who talk about casual sex so candidly in their music. There is probably some element to sex appeal, me being a straight dude, but honestly it's mostly because I hate the fact that there exists that social pressure on women (so much moreso than on men) against having sex with someone who isn't a life partner. So hearing women in music talk about that stuff a) makes me so genuinely happy for them that they are overcoming that pressure, and b) hopeful that we as a society can move to a world where that pressure doesn't exist. Not trying to say that someone is wrong to wait until marriage or whatever if that's their choice, but nobody should feel pressured one way or another by society. Anyways, this album blew my fucking mind for approaching the dark sides of casual sex in an unbelievably mature, raw, and emotional way WITHOUT being shaming. This is Tove's best album. Hands down.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.038): this is extremely horny, i expect nothing less from her

**AceSHF** (8.769): Amazing album with some of the best songs in Tove's career (so far) but there is a bit of a slump which is why I think Sunshine Kitty edges it out for me.

**Stryxen** (8.731): I only just realised what the cover art is after listening like three times hjshksjhg I thought it was just red blobs

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.462): I was so disappointed with Lady Wood so I had low expectations with this album. Thankfully, this album proved to be superior despite the lack of the short film visuals Lady Wood had. Blue Lips solidified why Tove Lo is a great confessional songwriter.

**SkyBlade79** (8.346): DISCO TITS, MOTHERFUCKIN QUEEN OF THE DISCO TITS

**bespectacIed** (8.308): Best album on the rate. Collapse after collapse after collapse. The interludes are so fucking good (lightbeams hello?????) I'm convinced not including them is tove sabotage

**hunnybee12** (8.231): definitely the strongest and most cohesive album in the rate

**racloves** (8.231): this album is so underrated

**mayolizard** (8.192): i love this album omg

**Misentro** (8.154): This album has very high highs, but it could have been cut down a lot into a much tighter EP. It feels like there's a lot of filler, and while it's all very cohesive, the second half really drags on. That said, it gave us Disco Tits, so it's perfect.

**andrxwzsz** (8.154): 9.0/10 for me (best album here for sure)

**skargardin** (8.077): Her magnum opus so far. The atmosphere she builds is so ominous and brooding, while still retaining that sexy Tove flair that she'd become known for, and still pushing the envelope with songs like Disco Tits and stranger. I love this album SO much.

**geraldinewww** (7.808): leaving LIGHT BEAMS off huh??? can't handle my 11?? no PITCH BLACK? jk but i would have liked to rate them, light beams in particular is a great intro to an excellent album

**vayyiqra** (7.692): Even though CollXtion II is my favourite album in this rate, this might objectively (insofar as that is a thing in rates) be the best in it, or at least the most cohesive. Being a big fan of Queen of the Clouds, this is my second favourite album by Tove, yet I don't listen to to it very much. I should change that.

**waluigiest** (7.538): I thought I loved this album but I think I just love disco tits

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.477): This album is saved by the bitches(remix) and disco tits being one of Tove’s best songs.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.462): Discard the second half, replace dont ask dont tell with hey you got drugs, and this album stops being her worst. Also, Tove Lo had the audacity to label this as Lady Wood Phase II... Lady Wood, sweetie.

**Bendariaku89** (7.269): You can tell how much I love most of the songs in this album more by how long my descriptions are.

**ariiaaaa** (7.062): never heard anything by Tove Lo but I expect great things

**bright\_baby\_blue** (5.777): This album didn't make a big impression on me. I find the songs very hook-focused (kinda like Number 1 Angel), but they don't have the inventive production to redeem themselves if you aren't a fan of the hook.

**pigserpent** (5.423): I gave up on Tove Lo a while ago but I was surprised by this album. There are some great instrumentals on here that do live up to Tove Lo's potential, even with a lot of filler on here.

**bulforster** (5.000): I don't get the hype for this at all. Her voice is really weak and her mildly cringey lyrics over such oppressive beats make almost all the songs here a drag for me.

deleted: I ain't even mad, Disco Tits deserve it. Honestly I wish I revised my score to 10. I also realised I forgot to give a song a 0 or an 11, mostly because I finished this rate in a rush and forgot to designate it to a song. But basically Casanova was my 11. But I'm also listening to Disco Tits right now and look my tits are dancing so I may actually have to give Tove my 11. 

~ thank you.
