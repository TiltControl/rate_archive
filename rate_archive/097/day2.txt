**worlds-okayest666** (9): I really feel like this should have placed higher. So smooth and quite possibly one of her best. Stop sleeping on this!

**hikkaru** (5): To be honest this is on a similar tier as Homework and Hills for me, it's just not very interesting, but clearly y'all disagree enough to get it to day 2. Good for Kim, I guess - at one point she got slaughtered even harder on day 1 so it's nice to see this make it past that point for equality's sake!

---

#I wanna cross the line

**ariiaaaa** (10): UNDERRATED MASTERPIECE

**Bendariaku89** (10): What an absolute surprise of a song! I gotta give credit as much as I hate it, this song is the best in this album. This is basically my 11 for this album. Her bubblegum pop will likely be chosen by many others as their best, but THIS ONE is the one that shows how cool she can be in the best way possible. It’s effortlessly sultry and her performance with the production is delightful. The back and forth of whispers and singing, with a beautiful variation as the song progresses and great vocal runs at the end. Wish it was produced by someone better, but amazing song regardless.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This better make it into day 2.

**ggodisawomann** (10): Charlie Puth SID outsold but this song is amazing

**ManofOranges** (10): This song... wow. It just takes me to another realm, it really does. It's such a gem.

**quenched** (10): okay slow jam!!! this is a serve

**AceSHF** (9.5): The vocal layering (I think it is) on this one is really nice.

**1998tweety** (9): We love a sexual jam, I'm surprised how good this is.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Mattia Binotto at the start of the 2020 Formula 1 season lmao I fucking hate Ferrari why did I dedicate my life to supporting these dunces all because I idolized one guy who won them loads of races? This is relevant because that driver is German, like Kim

**lapascalia** (8.5): that bridge took me by surprise, damn that was good

**anothertown** (8): I always forget about this song but it’s good. It’s like Spotifycore but actually good. The “ooh/cross the line/take your time” parts in the chorus are very Gwen Stefani

**SkyBlade79** (8): kinda sounds like cool for the summer at points but its still pretty good. The outro/bridge especially is great

**Stryxen** (8): love how this all comes together

**thoeoe** (8): This song is SEXY. Hell yeah

**vayyiqra** (8): chill late nite vibes :pensive:

**akanewasright** (7): This would be a 10 if it wasn’t for L*ke. This is one of my favorite songs on the album for sure. Kim sounds incredible, the hook is there, and this is one of the best not-a-bridge breakdowns.

worlds-okayest666: #It's going down (this song's placement in the rate)

**bandnitos** (7): im underwhelmed

**bbfan132** (7): a pretty slow jam but i wish there was a bit more to it

**waluigiest** (7): I always forget about this song oops

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Charlie Puth outsold

**andrxwzsz** (6): Sensual and sweet but forgettable aside from the chorus

**bright\_baby\_blue** (6): [Woo-Ah: 4/10]

**geraldinewww** (6): there's like... a sax sample in this that reminds me of something else...

**pigserpent** (5): This song is in a constant battle between being a lame pop song and being a cool vaporwave song with some great bass in the bridge and a cool synth tone throughout. Only thing is, normally the boring pop song is winning.

**racloves** (5): I prefer the higher tempo songs but I do like this

**fluviusfluit** (4): She slowed it down a bit too much for my taste

**skargardin** (4): i can't with her shouty adlibs

**TiltControls** (4): Charlie Puth did it better

**bespectacIed** (3): should've named it "turn it down"

**worlds-okayest666** (9): I’m surprised at how low this one placed! It’s a really strong track and I love how passionate her vocals are. That whole third verse gets me in my feels every time...

**hikkaru** (7): I think this song is nice enough, but the anthemic rise leading to nothing hurts the song a bit in my opinion. It, like Slow It Down, just barely make day 2 with a 7+ average giving Kim some grace, but it's not good enough to go any further.

---

#Can't do better than this song!

**iloveneonlights** (11): - Her best ballad and one of the best pop ballad infusions I have heard in a while

**bandnitos** (10): can she do more songs like this

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is definitely going to be robbed, it deserves better than wherever it ends up. Her vocals on the last chorus give me goosebumps every time

**1998tweety** (9.5): Bop

**thoeoe** (9.5): You can't do better than this song 👈😎👉

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): Anyone else get mega Kelly Clarkson vibes from this song?

**yatcho** (9): The fact that she can sing this live and sound flawless!!!

**bbfan132** (8.5): underrated, i love the buildup here that never really climaxes

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): okay this is stuff I want more from her! Big grand pop songs.

**lapascalia** (8): those synths are amazing

**ManofOranges** (8): Sonically I like this song but at times I think it's a little bit devoid of doing anything different. Feel like it's a little repetitious.

**nightjesus** (8): I just love her vocals. Slay it Kim.

**waluigiest** (8): literally when I started this rate I didn’t know this song was a different song from “If You Think About Me...” which shows just how uninteresting it is EDIT: I gave this my zero and waited for like 4 weeks and I kept coming back to listen to this song.... I hate that I like it now

**twat\_brained** (7.8): wasn't as keen on this one as her others. still great but not at the level of her other singles

**Bendariaku89** (7.5): The chorus grows on you though it is still too over-the-top. Not a bad song though.

**Stryxen** (7.5): she sounds a bit like Hayley williams (I think)

**andrxwzsz** (7): Slight disconnect between the verses and chorus but I love when Kim is ultra dramatic and this is exactly that

**anothertown** (7): Her best woo-ah is in this one

**bespectacIed** (7): it's not bad. sounds like a teenage dream cut

**geraldinewww** (7): this one is really fun. no real deep thoughts i'm just listening at work and it's fun

**MRACHNIE** (7): While this song succeeds where Heart To Break fails (in creating an anthemic chorus), the production on the verses is a lot more “standard Dr. Luke 2012 pop song”

**pigserpent** (7): I was unsure of this one at first but actually this kinda bops. There's a pretty neat climax on here.

worlds-okayest666: #Kim can do better than this

**quenched** (7): definitely one of the weaker era 1 songs, though i still like it a lot. kim doesn’t really have a bad song so. last minute addendum: kat stfu this is not a 0

**vayyiqra** (7): I love the 80s power ballad feel to this but the lyrics are questionable IMO

**ariiaaaa** (6.5): this is like If U Think About Me's cousin and I don't know how to feel about that because sometimes I love this weird child of a song and sometimes I hate it

**SkyBlade79** (6.5): it’s a bit too loud as a song but still a great woo ah

**bright\_baby\_blue** (6): [Woo-Ah: 3/10]

**hunnybee12** (6): sounds like a track off Prism

**Hielord** (5.5): you could do better with this song Kimmie

**skargardin** (5): something between the production and the almost shouty vocals from kim makes this a mess

**mayolizard** (4.5): this is pretty boring

**ggodisawomann** (4): also sleep but not bad

**akanewasright** (0): Kim, you can do better than this song. It’s one of the worst songs in the rate.

**alwayswords** (0): the chorus reminds me of another song i cant recall the name but it makes me hate this song sdgsgs

**cremeebrulee** (0): not sure what about this song annoys me but it just does

**worlds-okayest666** (8): A very middle of the road track. Not super great, but not bad either. The production does slap tho (and dare I say kinda carries it?)

**hikkaru** (7): One of only two songs from the second half of Blue Lips to make day 2, bad days draws a bit more interest than struggle or cycles or romantics but still falls short of seeing much of any success in the rate. I would personally rather see struggle here in its place but really it's nbd, this song is just kinda forgettable.

---

#GOOD days!

**ManofOranges** (10): I guess at some point during the emotional breakdown I had over a guy a few years ago, I listened to this song and it stuck because whenever I listen to this song I think about that time and my own bad days. Anyways, the song is good!

**SkyBlade79** (10): I love this song, it’s just such a chill bop. It just makes me happy and a little bit nostalgic.

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): I shouldn’t like this song as much I do. For some reason, out of every song in this album, THIS is the song that I can repeat over and over again without feeling bored of it. The entire song works for me in my opinion, even though I still have lingering doubts about whether they actually work.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I’m running out of time to review every track but gawd Tove is brilliant

**shesdoingyoga** (9): The lyrics on this one remind me too much of my ex so I usually skip it but it doesn’t deserve my skips

**Stryxen** (9): love the more stripped-down parts and they contrast the more intense parts. im easy to please

**ariiaaaa** (8.5): pleasantly surprised by the drop, good job Tove Lo

**andrxwzsz** (8): Very QOTC but fits perfectly somehow (the production, yeah, but also the attitude)

**bespectacIed** (8): great production

**bulforster** (8): Finally a good song.

**quenched** (8): is there a bad song on this album? i don’t think so...

**skargardin** (8): the poetry..

**vayyiqra** (8): me_irl

**bbfan132** (7.5): i like the drums here, that was a nice touch

worlds-okayest666: #bad song

**1998tweety** (7): I'm bored

**geraldinewww** (6.5): this isn't a bad song but i literally always forget it's on here. curse of the second to last album track

**bandnitos** (6): eh

**ggodisawomann** (6): it's...again, okay

**lapascalia** (6): the lyrics are good but the production and the melody don’t do anything for me unfortunately

**pigserpent** (6): The more shimmering sound of the early synths and the big open hits that puncuate spacious sections of the song give this song a lot more of a drive than some of the more fillery songs on this album.

**yatcho** (6): This is way overproduced for an emotional number

**anothertown** (5): this stops and starts and has no sense of momentum but there are some nice choruses

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): If I ever listen to this album in full again, I will definitely skip this in favor of getting to hey you got drugs? sooner.

**twat\_brained** (2): bad days. badder song.

**worlds-okayest666** (7.5): I’ve never really understood the hype for this one? Like, it’s cute, but I’ve seen people call it one of her best songs and i’m just like...is it? It’s kinda boring, dare I say, and ABRA’s verse just does not do it for me. Not upset at this going out somewhat early (although I’d actually swap it with a few of the lower-placing songs…)

**hikkaru** (6): Another fairly forgettable cut from Number 1 Angel in my opinion, but it's okay because it's sandwiched between two BOPS. I don't necessarily agree with it making it into day 2 but clearly I'm in the minority on that.

---

#hey you got drugs?

**AceSHF** (10): This one is underrated. I LOVE the layering of the synths as the song progresses.

**CritneySpearz** (10): a bop, kween of drugs

**n7cn7c** (10): slept on for too long

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i do love drugs

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): smoooooth

**skargardin** (10): abra ate

**bbfan132** (9.5): this song pulls off the dark pop sound better than most of the songs on blue lips

**SkyBlade79** (9.5): their voices work so well together. It’s a bit hypersexual but in a good way. I just love how the production urges them on.

**bandnitos** (9): she didnt need to add that outro but she did and we're all happy for it

**cremeebrulee** (9): idk if this is a fan fave but i really love this song, such an earworm

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The song’s chorus is so addictive like a drug.

**hunnybee12** (9): the outro takes it to another place

**quenched** (9): hikk stfu this is not a miss pt. 2

**Stryxen** (9): I like the contrast??? in this song. idk if that’s the right word and I don’t really know what I mean

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9): I’ve always really loved this song and I can’t even explain why lol.

**akanewasright** (8): Is it weird if I say that this song kind of made me realize that normal adults do drugs sometimes?

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): ABRA's part is quite nice.

**fluviusfluit** (8): "When you come it feels like diamonds rainin' down on me" Ariana and Gaga are shaking

**nightjesus** (8): Cocaine is a hell of a drug kids.

**pigserpent** (8): The bass on this song has an unrivaled warmth to it that is offset by the vocals and icy synths. The hooks are a tad weak, but this works as mood music and Charli really knows how to end a song.

**selegend** (8): love abra

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.6): The vocals in this song flow really well. I also really like the "fake ending" in this song before the climatic chorus.

**andrxwzsz** (7): That LooOveEe of my lIfeEee breakdown is amazing

=====

worlds-okayest666: #drugs are for idiots and i'm never gonna be that person

**MRACHNIE** (8): This feels like a deliberate throwback to Dreamer, as both songs are mid-tempo trap-pop anthems. However, Dreamer is clearly the prettier sister.

**1998tweety** (7): I can't decide if I like Abra or not, the rest is meh anyway.

**ManofOranges** (7): This one is kind of on the more boring side for me but it still has some redeeming qualities.

**TiltControls** (7): I thought this would be featuring ABBA :(

**Bendariaku89** (6): Pretty okay, not one I would listen to more than once.

**racloves** (6): don’t do drugs kids

**vayyiqra** (5): This has a nice instrumental melody but the lyrics are boring IMO. I wish I liked it more.

**ariiaaaa** (4.3): This feels very repetitive and boring to me, repetition is important in music but im just not a fan here, the end is solid

**Hielord** (4): what an original concept

**twat\_brained** (3.5): it sounds like she took one too many before recording; Charli's voice just feels listless and slurred

**bespectacIed** (1): profound indifference

**bulforster** (0): I wish Charli had more collabs with black singers so I didn't dislike the only one.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): This one feels a bit generic, but I think Allie’s delivery helps save it from going into flop territory...also that chorus is perfect to yell along to. You gotta love a good yell-along chorus!

**hikkaru** (7): This could have gone earlier tbh, it's a perfectly serviceable Allie cut but it's not the most exciting thing on CollXtion II. Like a lot of the other songs on the album it is very catchy but the production leaves a bit to be desired, and I totally get why it's a middle of the road cut in this rate

**ManofOranges** (10): I have a weak spot for songs that involve the days of the week, it's true it's true.

**n7cn7c** (10): weed

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): a masterpiece

**skargardin** (10): WE GOT LIFTED! ON A MONDAY!!

**SkyBlade79** (10): god I love this song. It reminds me very clearly of listening to it and hunting mammoths with spears while riding a sabertooth tiger in Far Cry Primal. Exactly how it should be. The production on this is so good and definitely one of my favorite trop pop songs ever.

**lapascalia** (9.5): dear god this is a banger

**andrxwzsz** (9): Trop-pop gone trippy and sad as fuck (what made CII so special in the first place)

**Bendariaku89** (9): I’ve definitely heard this before. I think I saw someone recommend this once and listened to it that time. It’s good, but it’s pretty much just reggae.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): we love a sad but happy sounding weed bop

**mayolizard** (9): wowie

**1998tweety** (8.5): Another classic, periodt.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): omg a reggae tinged song... collab with MAGIC! when?? jk jk jk. This bratty stoner pop is weird for Allie but it works, queen of versatility

**bright\_baby\_blue** (8.3): The chorus lyrics here are very satisfying. It also has some of the most interesting percussion in the album.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a real groove although I can't get past the line "everything from grunge to rock'n'roll" sis those are two subgenres of rock music that's hardly broad

**waluigiest** (8): side to side found dead

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.7): it’s nice, but that’s all I have to say about it.

**thoeoe** (7.5): Allie has really nailed the ability to bounce between lowkey verses and big choruses.

**nightjesus** (7): It sounds really similar to Brag or Borderline by Tove Stryke. Still boppin.

**racloves** (7): I love the beat

**Stryxen** (7): ugh this is catchy

**sandyfishnets** (6.5): finally a good song on this album oh my god

worlds-okayest666: #All we want is to forget this song

**bandnitos** (7): i don't get the hype for this song like its good but its not amazing

**yatcho** (6.5): Kind of slow and meandering in a way thats not as appealing as Paper Love

**364unbirthdays** (6): Such a good hook, but doesn't work for me as a whole

**bbfan132** (6): i wish i liked this more but it’s kind of boring :/ not bad though

**quenched** (6): the verses for this are amazing but the chorus...insert gif of rupaul saying meh

**ariiaaaa** (5.5): Guitars and a reggae beat???

**Hielord** (5.2): Alessia Cara vibes anyone? Anyways, it's not vibing for me

**akanewasright** (5): This feels lazy for some reason. It doesn’t quite hit my ears the right way.

**pigserpent** (5): This sounds like Melanine Martinez if she had less style but compensated by being a better songwriter.

**bespectacIed** (3): CL outsold

**hikkaru** (9): After the reptitive boppiness of Roll With Me comes a song that's more, well, emotional. It works very well with the blaring synths in the chorus as Charli gives her emotional wails, and it is a little disappointing for it to get the cut in mid-day 2.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): This is really cute! Again, it’s nothing special, but I love to scream along to the chorus. I can’t really complain about it’s placement; not amazing, but not bad either...just a solid middle of the road spot. (Also, this is weird, but I remember hearing the “questions in her mouth” and thinking this song was about Charli having a secret lesbian affair and I got REALLY confused...but then I actually payed attention to the lyrics and realized she meant the girlfriend of the guy she’s with. I’m not very smart, ok?

---

#E•MO•TION•AL

**Bendariaku89** (10): This song clicked by the middle. For some reason her post-chorus vocal runs remind me of Kung Fu Panda HAHA.

**bespectacIed** (10): What makes a charli song a god-tier song: honest sentimentality in amazing production (see also: 7 years, silver cross, next level charli, grins)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): So many specific memories I had with this song when the mixtape came out.

**ManofOranges** (10): When I first listened to Number 1 Angel a few years ago this is the song that stuck with me the most. It's got the perfect blend of everything and is just makes me melt every single time I hear it.

**pigserpent** (10): If anyone else made this I would consider it a cheesy affront to good music, but instead Charli managed to make it into an over-the-top, melodramtic work of art and easily one of the best Charli ballads.

**plantp0wer** (10): it IS so emotional

**Stryxen** (10): oop this hits different now that I’m listening to the lyrics

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Underrated Charli song.

**yatcho** (9.5): Charli's ballads are insanely underrated

**akanewasright** (9): I slept on this song for ages for two reasons. One is the way she sings “will you be there”. The other is because this right next to ILY2, which I like more and is similar enough to it that putting them together on the tracklist was a bad idea. But it’s a STELLAR song. It’s Charli’s first attempt at a sad ballad in her current style, and while it’s not perfect, it’s a pretty damn good song, and a good indicator of the great songs to come.

**andrxwzsz** (8): AAALLLLL OVERRRR

**bandnitos** (8): this is nice

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.7): I really like the vocal runs on this song. It doesn't sound much like any other Charli song to me, so there's that.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (7.6): charli describing me if Lipgloss doesn’t win the rate

**lapascalia** (7.5): sounds like charli’s, i like it

**n7cn7c** (9): eh

**bbfan132** (8): i love chorli but this is one of the weaker tracks here - weaker for her is strong for other artists so i’ll accept it

**1998tweety** (7): I remember really liking this..idk what happened.

**anothertown** (7): Chali you don’t’ need to “lose control” to sleep with a girl

**vayyiqra** (7): :pensivecharli:

**ariiaaaa** (6.6): oooo pop ballad, yesssssss, I'm actually a fan of this one

**quenched** (6.5): honestly found this a tad boring but it was strong lyrically

**twat\_brained** (6.3): I don't mind when Charli gets personal every now and then but she's too on the nose here

**skargardin** (6): boom clap is that you?

**SkyBlade79** (4): her voice on this song is just not pleasant

**nightjesus** (3): This sounds like an early 2010’s Cher Lloyd bubble gum pop, just slightly better produced.

**worlds-okayest666** (8.5): This is a bop BUT some of the lyrics (mainly the politics one) are so bad I had to subtract some points... and Allie herself hates this so I think she’d agree.

**hikkaru** (7.5): This is one of the catchiest songs on the album I think, and it's definitely very cute, but I think the lyrics can hold it back... a LOT. And normally I'm the one to not give a single fuck about lyrics but "we think that politics are such a waste of time" aged SO poorly. Well, considering this album released in 2017, it was pretty bad upon arrival actually. It's not bad outside of that, and is quirky enough to gain a few 11s, but it falls right in the middle of the rate ultimately.

---

#We think that politics are such a waste of time

**mudkip1** (11): a bop that stood the test of time

**AceSHF** (10): A little cheesy but super catchy so I'll forgive it

**ManofOranges** (10): This was the first song and only song I had heard from this album up until this rate so maybe I've got a soft spot for it but to me it's a hit.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the lyrics are actually not me at all but this song slaps soooo

**skargardin** (10): this is so corny but speaks to me on so many layers

**vayyiqra** (10): I love this song! It's good she has a more positive song on this rather dark album (like everything she does) and this song always reminds me of my best friend who is also a fan of Allie. :uwu:

**waluigiest** (10): just fun pop music!!! It’s so uplifting I love it

**wholahaybrown** (10): Wish I knew why Allie hates this song now--absolute bop

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.8): definitely my favorite song on the album. I don’t know how she puts up with someone who annoys her daily though. What a queen!

**1998tweety** (9.5): Perfection, this is how you do this type of song.

**MRACHNIE** (9.5): That's So Us probably has my favorite production on the record, and, ignoring /the lyric/, succeeds in creating a mood better than any other song from CII.

**Bendariaku89** (9): Somehow this one feels like a Kim Petras song.

**bespectacIed** (9): very bubblegum, i like it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I feel like this is such an underrated song. I hope it survives until Day 2 at least!

**nightjesus** (9): The only thing that bugs me about the song is that politics isn’t a waste of time go vote!

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This was the first Allie X song I remember hearing, it was in my discover weekly on Spotify sometime at the end of 2017

**thoeoe** (9): Omg this is a good one, relatable in that I'm also a Leo. Also this just makes me so happy for her that she has someone who makes her not wanna die in her life ❤️

**TiltControls** (9): The song's great but the lyrics feel very 15 year old and their highschool partner

**quenched** (8.5): these lyrics are kinda cringe 💀 but i still love it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Allie herself doesn’t really like this song but I have a soft spot for it

**twat\_brained** (8.3): Raven Symoné is so shook, she's paralyzed from below her knees

**bandnitos** (8): i wish i felt this way about someone

**lapascalia** (8): it’s cute but girl… politics are no waste of time

**Stryxen** (8): why does she say time and nine like that. anyways this is a bop

**SkyBlade79** (7.5): somehow this is super cringy with a lot of the lyrics (politics are such a waste of time, the astrology shit) but it’s still somehow really good and cutesd

**andrxwzsz** (7): Just super cute

**astrologicalangel** (7): I can vividly see myself as a Sophomore unironically relating to these lyrics

worlds-okayest666: **bbfan132** (6.5): this sounds like the song that would play in an advertisement for the album

**racloves** (6.5): it’s a cute song but a little bit too corny for me, also painfully straight.

**hunnybee12** (6): do you ever feel like a misfit?

**ignitethephoenix** (6): we think politics is such a waste of time ..... hmmmmm

**bright\_baby\_blue** (5): The beats on this song are fine (powerful kick drums!)-- I just find the lyrics super annoying.

**bulforster** (5): It bops, but the lyrics are pretty insufferable.

**cremeebrulee** (5): added some points for the astrology line and then took some off for the politics one

**mayolizard** (5): sis said she don't care about politics… ok gorl

**akanewasright** (4.5): “We think that politics is such a waste of time” ugh complacent QUEEN! Go girl, get fascists elected through your apathy 😍💁‍♀️💅🖤🖤🖤

**anothertown** (4): I’m glad she stated she’s a leo in this because clearly only a leo could have wrote this

**n7cn7c** (4): hey old navy commercial

**pigserpent** (4): This one's pretty boring but the vocals have a sing-songish quality that I enjoy.

**fluviusfluit** (3): That's so underwhelming :(

**sandyfishnets** (3): the beat is good, but the lyrics aren't.

**ariiaaaa** (2): I'm an amateur classically trained singer and I don't know what the vowel changes in the refrain are for, they seem pretty meaningless and!! that!! grinds!! my!! gears!!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): Now HERE’S a song that deserved higher! This is an absolute BOP. So cheesy and sexy and fun. Uffie’s verse is polarizing, but I honestly love it. She ate it up!

**hikkaru** (9): This song is SO much fun, I love the vibe it goes for just as a pure bubblegum pop bop. The chorus is simple but it's so fun and we have to stan Charli digging up Uffie from the early 10s electrotrash era for this song! I wish it did a bit better in this rate.

---

#I'll be your babygirl

**anothertown** (10): Pop the Glock is the progenitor of hyperpop girls, a 3-part lecture series

**Awkward\_King** (10): one of my favourite charli songs for sure its so underrated, its so fucking 80s i love it

**bbfan132** (10): i love how charli brought back random artists from the early ‘10s for this mixtape… uffie snapped here

**Bendariaku89** (10): Love the production, the cowbell and how chillax the backtrack it seems despite how bright it is. I’m intrigued which makes this more worthwhile than what I get from half the the tracks in this album,

**bulforster** (10): Sugary pop perfection.

**lapascalia** (10): so listening to this album for the first time I was not expecting this… and wow this is one of my favourite charli songs ever

**n7cn7c** (10): uffie snapped

**quenched** (10): babygirl? more like boppygirl...also uffie sounds exactly like m.i.a., i thought i was accidentally streaming paper planes for a hot sec

**SkyBlade79** (10): uffie’s voice kinda sucks but this is definitely the best song on the mixtape. The production is amazing, charli’s voice is so sensual, and the lyrics are good – just risky enough

**Stryxen** (10): I feel like indie kids on tiktok would gobble this song up if they heard it. maybe I just want to hear this song more

**untutorable** (10): a masterpiece yup yup

**hunnybee12** (9.5): almost perfect but wtf is uffie saying

**twat\_brained** (9.2): this one feels like a throwback to Sucker days which is what I love about it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): catchy af

**vayyiqra** (9): This is one of my favourite songs on this album and it's so cute and pure. :uwu: Now stan Uffie, without whom all your favourite hyperpop girls would not exist. (Even though her verse on this isn't that great I admit.)

**waluigiest** (9): it’s so glamorous and plush this song is so wonderful

**bright\_baby\_blue** (8.7): This has some of my favorite production in Charli's entire discography. If there were more sections / verses, it would probably be a 10.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): This song really seems to be an outlier from the vibe of the rest of the album, but I'm not going to complain cause I really dig it

**andrxwzsz** (7): so fun, so sexy

**skargardin** (7): boppy

worlds-okayest666: #uffie who?

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Chorus being less repetitive would make me give this a higher score

**1998tweety** (8): Production on this is great but Uffie is meh

**ManofOranges** (8): This one has taken a while to grow on me. While I don't love it a lot, I certainly appreciate it more. It's cute.

**nightjesus** (8): Oh this is super cute. Slightly really repetitive towards the end. But other then that it’s a cute lil bop.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Stream Baby Girl by Chloe x Halle

**MRACHNIE** (7.5): The instrumental is one of the best on the album, and Charli goes extremely hard on this, However, remove Uffie live and legally for fans and fans of fans. There is a time and place for “intentionally annoying” vocal delivery, and a mid-tempo sensual banger is not it. Fun fact: this has more songwriters than any other song on the record.

**thoeoe** (7.5): I feel like Uffie has made a career of perpetually being a feature on other people's electropop songs. Stream Steroids (feat. Uffie)

**bandnitos** (7): lost two points for uffie's accent thing. girl what r u doing

**geraldinewww** (7): i really like the synths in this one

**pigserpent** (7): A lot brighter than the rest of the mixtape, and fills a unique sound Charli doesn't normally touch. It's enjoyable, but I don't love it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): the uffie feature is god awful tbh

**Hielord** (6.5): It puts me off and turns me on at the same time, I can't

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): very fillery

**racloves** (6): not my fav anyway, but I have a weird memory attached to this song where I’m sitting on a bus in Edinburgh while trying not to cry.

**bespectacIed** (5): Gorgeous but uffie really wasn't needed here, sorry to her.

**ariiaaaa** (4.4): this feature isn't bad, its actually very vocally interesting. Would've been higher but songs about sex can really put me off, im picky

**hikkaru** (9): Zara Larsson's "All The Time" may be a classic cultural reset robbed song of the summer etc, but that doesn't mean we should forget Kim's song with the same name! This is one of the better songs from Era 1 in my opinion, I absolutely adore the energy it has through the rapid-fire verses and the bouncy production. Kinda robbed in the rate tbh!

#Wanna kick it with you all the time!

**ggodisawomann** (10): BANGER UNDERRATED

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): it’s great

**twat\_brained** (9.4): big big bop. went insane when Kim opened her set at Troye's concert

**anothertown** (9): The first kim song I heard, and at the time 2 years ago I was like “wow this is the most over the top, hot pink bubblegum pop I’ve heard in such a long time :o” how far ive come since then.

**bespectacIed** (9): Zara did it better but this is really cool. I love the synths

**lapascalia** (9): it’s a catchy summertime bop

**nightjesus** (9): This song is honestly just summer. It’s that song you imagine listening to when it’s summer and you’re riding a bike along the beach and coronavirus wasn’t a thing...ugh sweet memories.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Zara Larsson wishes (just kidding, hers is a 10)

**bright\_baby\_blue** (8.8): This song I really have to be in the mood for. Sometimes the overproduced vocals really hit the spot, other times I find them really grating. But the gated reverb (is that what it's called?) usually carries the song for me. [Woo-Ah: 6/10]

**1998tweety** (8.5): Normally this is the kind of chorus I'd hate but it actually works here.

**bbfan132** (8): a bit basic but super fun and catchy

**Bendariaku89** (8): I love the verses and pre-chorus, but I still feel apprehensive about the chorus. Really like the song overall, but I wish the chorus was done differently.

**pigserpent** (8): A lot of summery music feels overly washed out to me, but this song does a great job of feeling summery fresh and still letting it pop.

**quenched** (8): another bop, though not on the level of some of the others in era 1

**vayyiqra** (8): 80s cheese in the best way

**waluigiest** (8): horny excellence!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): stream Zara Larsson

**SkyBlade79** (7): this is a pretty good song but I think this is the worst woo ah ever

**akanewasright** (6): Apparently this was Sophie’s favorite Kim song? It’s a delightful bop. I’d give it a better score, but fuck Luke.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): Similar to Lifted, I feel like this one goes into generic territory, but I’m not sure if Allie’s delivery completely saves it? It doesn’t really have a catchy hook or stand-out moment like Lifted, although the lyrics are stronger. Still a pretty good song, if a bit weirdly placed in the tracklist.

**hikkaru** (7): This song is fine enough, but I think it doesn't do too much to really stand out from the rest of the album. The production isn't too interesting, though the chorus is definitely catchy. It's okay, but I'm not entirely sure I agree with it nearly making top 20 in this rate.

#Making my way downtown

**AceSHF** (10): This one sounds quite nocturnal and it has amazing synths. I love the synth base and the muted vocals in the background. Easily one of her best songs ever.

**n7cn7c** (10): omg creative vision

**quenched** (10): one of the best in collxtion ii...we love a slow bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this hits hard oof

**vayyiqra** (10): Sad sex bops are the best kind :pensive:

**twat\_brained** (9.4): you know I could really get down to this if it comes on

**bright\_baby\_blue** (9.1): The atmosphere of this song is very developed, if that makes sense. The vocals are unique but still manage to fit the vibe of the song. It manages to feel happy, sad, and dark all at the same time.

**andrxwzsz** (9): One of Allie's most cinematic and singular songs

**ManofOranges** (9): This is an example of a more toned-down song done right, I think.

**skargardin** (9): ugh, iconic..

**Stryxen** (9): everything is immaculate

**1998tweety** (8.5): The production on her songs are always so damn good.

**lapascalia** (8.5): give it up give it up

**Hielord** (8): An underrated gem

**nightjesus** (8): https://imgur.com/gallery/fWCu3kW

**pigserpent** (8): A sultry song featuring great embelishments that interject themselves and do great work spicing up the track. This is probably my favorite vocal performance on this record.

**SkyBlade79** (8): kinda sus lyrics at some times but it slaps, gotta admit

**anothertown** (7.5): those riffs just hit..

**ariiaaaa** (7): I'm kinda here for the vibe of this

**bandnitos** (7): i mean its good

#the three negative comments

**bbfan132** (6.5): this isn’t bad, the chorus is just super underwhelming… i like the verses though

**mayolizard** (6): no strong emotions here

**bulforster** (4): It's a bit too dreary for me and the last chorus doesn't hit nearly as hard as it should.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): But oh wow, what an opener. This song will never not hype me up..a bad bitch anthem. Also, RAYE ate that UP and y’all better give her the recognition she deserves.

**hikkaru** (8): The introduction to Number 1 Angel, Dreamer displays more of a contemporary sound than some of the other tracks from the mixtape. It still works though, proving Charli's reach as an artist. Personally it's not one of my absolute faves on the album but it's definitely decent.

---

#I'M A DREAMAAAH

**bbfan132** (10): a sort-of-epic intro to an underrated mixtape

**cremeebrulee** (10): i was super into charli during her true romance era and then fell off when she went more radio pop but one day this song popped on my spotify discover and the rest was history. so yeah this song got me back into charli again xoxo

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I can't help but hear "woo-ah" in the outro. A career highlight for Charli tbh. RAYE's "I'm not a chef, but I'm getting caked" one-liner is hilarious as fuck.

**ManofOranges** (10): A great way to start of the album/mixtape/whatever. Not one person here fucks up. It also just has great build up from the beginning to the end of the song that gives a taste of what a lot of other songs will do as well.

**mayolizard** (10): i’m a dreamaahhhh

**MRACHNIE** (10): Now THIS is how you make a mid-tempo song go hard. Some of the other girls should really take notes.

**n7cn7c** (10): YUP

**quenched** (10): STRETCH STRETCH LIMOUSINE UHHHHHH

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): big. fat. bass. what an intro.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): what an opening!

**bandnitos** (9): now this is how you open an album (or a mixtape i guess)

**nightjesus** (9): What can I say she just creates B O P S.

**skargardin** (9): banger

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bops a bit, the features ate.

**lapascalia** (8.5): that chorus is great, also love raye’s verse

**andrxwzsz** (8): Too repetitive but a rager when driving

**bulforster** (8): All of Charli's openers since Vroom Vroom have been stellar but this one pales a little bit in comparison. She's not really that much of a presence here, but Raye's and Starrah's verse especially are good.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): A great opener to this amazing bedroom pop mixtape.

**thoeoe** (8): Another solid opening track, features on point as they always are with Charli.

**waluigiest** (8): a fine intro - I LOVE raye’s verse

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.7): This track is a great opener. I'm not really sure why I like this song, but the words kinda just wash over you.

worlds-okayest666: #Nightmare

**pigserpent** (8): Majestic synths with a catchy chorus and some notable verse melodies make for a solid opening song. At the same time, the song can feel a little hollow at times, and it doesn't add much onto itself other than getting louder.

**SkyBlade79** (8): the features kinda drag it down but still good.

**anothertown** (7): flEx wITH my friEnDS!

**vayyiqra** (7): ok dreamer

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): This song really feels like a prototype for Next Level Charli and Pink Diamond

**shesdoingyoga** (6.5): I originally had this a bit higher but got bored by the end of the song so dropped it

**twat\_brained** (6.5): never loved this one

**akanewasright** (6): This is one of my least favorite songs on the mixtape. It’s still kind of a jam though.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): not sure if Charli does trap-esque music that well

**Stryxen** (6): the instrumental is great but the vocals just pass over me and I don’t have any connection to it

**ariiaaaa** (4): rap is just not my thing

**bespectacIed** (1): This is cringe. To those who think this is a good song: https://youtu.be/AJRk_wY8y_M

**Bendariaku89** (0): I’ve listened to this song so many times trying to see if I can like it. No, I still hate it.

**hikkaru** (10): This is a personal favourite of mine from the album, probably top 3 for me. The synths in the chorus are absolutely stunning and it stands out as some of the best production on the album imo. I would have loved to see it do a bit better and perhaps make day 3 but unfortunately not everyone agrees with me.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i can’t unhear “shittering gold”...but with that being said, this is still a smash. I really dig the “shiver, shiver, bittersweet, that glitter” part in particular.

---

#Giving me shivers

**bespectacIed** (10): That's how you do a fucking drop!!! So satisfying. One of tove's best songs

**ggodisawomann** (10): bop

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this one is so damn good. It's a little bit of a switch up from the previous two songs sonically, but the hook is just irresitible for me. It's appropriate how it's got "shivering" in the name because I get chills whenever I listen.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): almost gave this my eleven, so much for sh1ver1ng G.O.A.T.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song puts the horny in horny Ellie Goulding

**SkyBlade79** (10): This one is so great, the production just is stellar (especially that “wooah!” part in the chorus). I like how dirty some of the lyrics are. Also, the “fingers in ties” lyric is literally amazing and underrated

**thoeoe** (10): UGH YES I wish I had more than one eleven to give out. The best chorus on this album and the best single moment on the album, in the last chorus when her voice is chopped and goes "I--I--I-I" it's just.... shivers down my spine.

**AceSHF** (9.5): Amazing, explosive chorus but a few clunky lyrics hold this one back a little.

**Bendariaku89** (9.5): This song has some great ass melodies. And what a post-chorus. SHIVER SHIVER BITTERSWEET THAT GLITTER.

**akanewasright** (9): I overplayed the shit out of this song, otherwise this would have been a 10 easily.

**iloveneonlights** (9): - The production sounds so in-your-face but not borderline abrasive and I think it adds so much to the song

**skargardin** (9): it slaps

**andrxwzsz** (8): Bittersweet that glitter, baby!!

**ariiaaaa** (8): I can feel this song growing on me every second, THE SLOW BUILD ALSO YESSSSS

**bbfan132** (8): enjoyable but the “you sit on my face” line throws me off completely lmao

**nightjesus** (8): A bop and for sure a stronger song on the album.

**bandnitos** (7): i really don't like that snare in the chorus

**pigserpent** (7): ooh yest this is crunchy

**hikkaru** (9): The synths and production on this song are so so good, I love the warbles that back the whole thing and the drop is so much fun! All in all it's just a very fun love song and one of the best songs on the album imo, super happy to see it attain an average above 8.0!

**worlds-okayest666** (9): Such a fun 80s-inspired bop. It kinda reminds me of what she would go on to do with Super Sunset and I love it! (Also, how was this not a single…)

---

#That was a classic

**1998tweety** (10): The production on this is amazing, love this vibe.

**Bendariaku89** (10): IN LOVE, even if it took a while to get used to that post-chorus with its abrasive synth.

**bespectacIed** (10): For a long time this was the only Allie X song I know, and I was content. Great synthpop right here

**ManofOranges** (10): Yup yup yup.

**quenched** (10): bye i’m such a basic bitch cause i’m living for these 2012 drop moments on this album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is classic (uh huh)

**vayyiqra** (10): All of this boppage, uh-huh

**waluigiest** (10): the little scoop when she says “give me peace of miiiind” that’s the sauce

**nightjesus** (9): Like super offended this is called the flops rate because the public does not have taste if this was allowed to flop smh.

**SkyBlade79** (9): I honestly don’t remember this song being so good. Like, at all. I guess the name makes sense, because now that I’m listening it so long after my first listen, it really aged like a fine vintage.

**lapascalia** (8.5): can definitely hear troye’s influence in this song

**thoeoe** (8.5): The song for people who call things "that bitch." Also I'm a fucking sucker for that underwater sounding effect she does all the time.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): I keep thinking she's saying "I love this vantage". still boppy tho

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (8.5): this sounds it could have been on EMOTION. Hopefully that isn’t a blasphemous statement

**bright\_baby\_blue** (8.2): The way the synths and drums (and is that a cowbell?) weave in and out of each other in this song is very cool. One of the most mesmerizing songs on a mesmerizing album. This song makes me happy.

**anothertown** (8): this is such a bop, but the lyrics do not make sense, evoking the “vintage” concept makes me think of allie as one of those tradwives who wish they lived in the 1950s

**bbfan132** (8): i forgot that this song existed but it’s a pleasant, breezy track! stan synthpop

**Hielord** (8): this is a good example of a "cute" song

**pigserpent** (8): A solid collection of a vareity of synth choices that are toned down to match each other for the sake of cohesion. This song is fun.

**skargardin** (8): bop!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): a cute bop reminiscent of FameGa and Lana but kinda... empty. If it’s a parody of Tumblr girls and their aesthetic obsessions it did that very accurately though

**hikkaru** (10): Probably one of the more "basic" pop bops in the rate, but bop it sure does! Paper Love doesn't do too much to stand out but it's very catchy and that whistle hook is infectious. Ultimately it lands just outside of Day 3 but still manages to get an average above 8.0 which is pretty good and I'm personally content with how it placed.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): This is one of the first Allie songs I fell in love with and I will ALWAYS stan it. Is it a bit generic? Yes. Does it absolutely fucking slap? YES!

---

#it got radio play in canada!

**bespectacIed** (7): That non-drop belonged in 2011. Sounds like a k-pop gg comeback song that will be dragged to filth. In conclusion, I like it. Btw can someone explain how a Youtube video of this has 35M views??? Was this popular somewhere?

#*whistling*

**cremeebrulee** (10): "watch my heart turn into pulp" UGH what an absolutely amazing song

**Misentro** (10): That whistle is so magnetic, it's the perfect opener to the album.

**quenched** (10): the drop in this was really good, especially the whistles. ended kill em with kindness

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the whistle refrain is iconic, I’m surprised this wasn’t a bigger “indie hit”

**skargardin** (10): This is perfection, period

**SkyBlade79** (10): I’ve always loved this song so much. It’s just like a perfect alt pop song basically. The whistling, that bassline, just the song structure. So good.

**Stryxen** (10): idk what it is but the drop does something to me and the whole song is really nostalgic even though I’ve NEVER listened to it before

**twat\_brained** (10): that riff and that whistle is just… nothing short of pop perfection

**bulforster** (9.5): It's cool how many ways she manages to twist the paper metaphor.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): it bangs what else is there to say

**1998tweety** (9): Good start to the album, the chorus surprisingly works well.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The moment I first listened to this song, I had a feeling I am going to love this album. The lyricism and the production is just damn good.

**ManofOranges** (9): I'm a sucker for any song that I can whistle along to.

**mayolizard** (9): wow the bassline (?) on this is really strong

**Bendariaku89** (8.5): I’d like this song, but I don’t like the whistling. I like the rest of the stuff though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I heard this on the radio a bunch and had no clue it was Allie x!

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): If I had to pick one word to describe how this sounds, I would say it sounds clean

**bandnitos** (8): kinda generic but a bop nonetheless

**bbfan132** (8): a nice chill bop to start this rate off with, i enjoyed it!

**nightjesus** (8): Allie please slay me.

**racloves** (8): this is a fun bop I like it

**vayyiqra** (8): Every time I hear the whistling at the beginning of this, I think I don't like it, until the rest of the song comes in and I remember it's great. What a good opener.

**waluigiest** (8): her voice and writing both shine here

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.9): The prechorus in this song is great, and the "whistle hook" is a cool unique feature. The song structure is a bit repetitive for me and the production doesn't really stand out to me on the album, but it's still a very solid track.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song feels like it was made to be used in a smartphone ad or something. Not complaining tho.

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): gooood

**thoeoe** (7.5): Perfect intro for this album; with over a minute before it gets really moving it gives you enough time to get situated, but still getting big and showing what's to come. And that whistle is infectious.

**andrxwzsz** (7): Maybe a bit too basic, still strong and a hit

**hikkaru** (10): I have to say, I am pretty surprised at how this did in the rate. In my opinion this eclipses the original version by a fair amount, but clearly a lot of you disagreed. It just barely misses day 3 which breaks my heart a little as this remix is so much fun and adds so much to what was a slightly underwhelming original version imo.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): A SMASH! Such an improvement over the original and I’m completely baffled as to how it made day 3, but this didn’t. The features all bring something special to the table, and they really give this the finishing touches it needed. Honestly wish this was the version on the album...surely they could have at least tacked it onto the end like Lorde did with the Homemade Dynamite remix or something?

#BI RIGHTS

**astrologicalangel** (11): the song that first got me to seriously listen to tove lo, also just insanely good

**1998tweety** (10): Now THIS is how you do a remix. Completely elevates the song.

**akanewasright** (10): I know some people don’t like this because it’s no longer a 2 minute burst of filthy energy, but a full song with a bridge, but this remix is glorious. Everyone sounds great, I love the bridge, and the original song sounds wrong without Charli’s ad libs (“so easy so easy yeah yeah”).

**ariiaaaa** (10): I AM SO HYPE FOR THIS HELLO????

**bandnitos** (10): why is there a cat on the cover when its called bitches

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): not really a remix, but all the features realize the track's full potential.

**fluviusfluit** (10): Iconic doesn't even being to describe it

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is in the same boat as the Casanova remix. I like it better than the original, although it's not quite 11 material so if only I could give it a 10.5.

**Misentro** (10): This really unlocks the full power of bitches. I don't think I've ever heard a song that was already amazing be improved so much by a remix. Everyone adds their own style but it all fits in perfectly. The extra verse especially has such clever writing.

**plantp0wer** (10): WOMEN

**quenched** (10): took a bop and made it even better. i especially love elliphant / alma in this. queens of spelling bitch

**racloves** (10): QUEEN SHIT

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): IMPROVED AF by making it a posse cut!! The female camaraderie aspect makes its crude bravado way more charming, and turns the song into a true WLW anthem. Bye to the possible uncharitable interpretation of “Tove doesn’t really have female friends because internalized misogyny but doesn’t mind using other women for sex”. Now it’s like “Tove doesn’t really trust people until she knows them on a deeper level, but that won’t stop her from having fun hookups and being wild with her ride-or-die bitches” <3 Bi pride!!!

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Out of all the remixes I can think of off the top of my head that are mostly just other artists added rather than significantly changing the instrumental/production, this might be my favorite

**skargardin** (10): This remix is so FUCKING good, every feature gets their own time to shine and it still manages to be cohesive, SLAY

**Stryxen** (10): the video is everything I never knew I needed.

**twat\_brained** (10): this is the pop girl supergroup we all need in our lives and which we need to collaborate altogether once again.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): DRIPPIN IN HAHMONNY LIKE FIF

**hunnybee12** (9.5): it would be perfect if they all had new verses

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (9.5): much better.

**AceSHF** (9): The original is a bit too short but I'm not crazy about some of the features.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): It loses a point for that weird ALMA rap verse but this collab is still iconic tbh.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): I feel like the original is the same quality as this, just different

**lapascalia** (8.5): it’s a good remix, i especially think elliphant and alma’s verse is great

**thoeoe** (8.5): This version was a ton of fun with everyone involved but definitely felt.... idk too full?

**andrxwzsz** (8): Lowkey messy but still kinda amazing

**anothertown** (8): now chali gets to say harmony like fifth!!

**bright\_baby\_blue** (7.7): The vocal features on here are great enough to put this solidly above the original. Elliphant / ALMA's rap verse in particular is really creative and fun to listen to.

**bbfan132** (7.5): super fun and tongue-in-cheek, the features probably make this better (and the video is hilarious)

**pigserpent** (6.5): I have the same conflicted feelings about this as the original, but it's clear that the extra preformers makes the song better.

worlds-okayest666: #bitch, singular

**cremeebrulee** (8): i prefer the original this is just a little too cluttered for me

**ggodisawomann** (8): not better than the original but still slaps!

**iloveneonlights** (8): - I feel like it got crowded with not that big of a payback for it

**SkyBlade79** (7): The original song is so good that I can’t give it under a 7, but adding extra people doesn’t help the song at all. It makes it less sensual and dirty sounding because none of them can achieve the vibe that Tove had.

**waluigiest** (6): I don’t think this remix is better.

**yatcho** (6): In theory the europop Lady Marmalade of our time in practice the second Girls of that year

**bespectacIed** (5): I prefer Tove solo so much more. The only improvement was Icona Pop's portion, It's sooooo good. The rap verses, just nod and smile y'all. Charli's contribution is so lethargic i am angry this remix is a disservice to the servitude of the og

**vayyiqra** (5): This is not good as the original and also I hate the video and that is all I will say about it

**Bendariaku89** (4): The raps are fine, but I can’t appreciate what is essentially a worse version of a pretty much perfect song. I get it has collabs and what not but it’s like watching Lion King the live action movie vs the animated Lion King movie. There’s no point to the former when the latter already exists. By virtue of bitches being a really good song to listen even if it is inferior, it’s a 4, but not more.

**bulforster** (4): Between this and Girls how does Charli keep ending up on these songs about sex with other women? Anyways this is a mess, kind of a fun one but not enough for me to look past the mess.

**selegend** (3): five artists who havent charted after 2014
