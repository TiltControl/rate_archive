**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/Jtsufw2B)**

---
**kappyko** (7.5): A fine outro to the album, and a fine intro to day 2! A stripped down track and a revision of the poem "I Wanna Be Yours", it takes the rather weird lyrics and forms it into a sentimental ballad. The metaphors are weird and border on fetishistic, but I don't mind this.

**fourchip** (7.5): I think a closer to an album like this could have been better. This one is just kind of here, but knowing Arctic Monkeys they could have done something much more powerful.

---
**DraculaWeekend** (10): Literal poetry

**swankyhoodrat** (10): If this whole album is the course of fucking someone, this is post-coitus snuggling part

**mylostlights** (9): Fantastic way to end the album. The imagery is dope, the vocals are dope, and everything else about it is so fun.

**Verdantshade** (9): AT LEAST AS DEEP AS THE PACIFIC OCEAN

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): I feel this is a song people bang to or something

**OriginalKappa** (8.5): Why is this the source material they look to for inspiration? Well doesnt matter cause this is amazing

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Well, there's an interesting set of metaphors for you-the lyrics only settled into me after a few listens and I was like 'Huh? What?'. I'm not sure if it ends up significantly adding to this song, but I find it a lovely closer to the record.

**thegeecyproject** (8.5): I wanna be your vacuum cleaner...

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): I wanna be your vacuum cleaner, so I can give you the succ.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): I like the Sinatra vibes on this.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A slow but fulfilling closer

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.6): I want to be your vacuum cleaner salesman

**\_wuw\_** (7): love the production on this. sounds like an old western cowboy movie. i feel that some of the lyrics are awkward and don't 'sing' very well. this works as a thematic conclusion to AM but doesn't really stand on its own.

**sn0wgaryen** (7): “Knee Socks” would have been a better way to end the album.

**Raykel** (6.5): Ugh I hate when the last song is the weakest

**CarlieScion** (6): a kinda boring closer

**cucumberanti** (6): Every time I listen to I Wanna Be Yours I have this mv playing in my head of Alex’s face superimposed onto corresponding household items as he sings about them, please send help

**bespectacIed** (5): In retrospect this was kinda a great preview for tranquility base, which means I despise it

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this is the shitty part of tumblr in a song

**unovachamp** (5): I can't believe you all let John Cooper Clarke flop

**twat\_brained** (3.8): YOU /U/CALLTEHSHOTS BABE :DDDDDDD tbh the only real high point of the song, I hope they never performed this live

"Pressure" is probably the closest to filler, and yet it still feels as energetic as the rest of the album. There's still a discernably fun quality to this, though you begin to realize that the band has a ton of tropes they tend to overuse by this point. Luckily, the album quickly comes to a close soon after, but the genericity of this outing probably led to its lower placement.

**fourchip** (5.5): This feels like they ripped themselves off lmao

---
**sn0wgaryen** (9): I don’t know what to say about this song but I love it.

**Verdantshade** (9): a great chorus but the song never clicked with me. maybe the sax solo never properly comes to life or the song is too slow, or it sounds like a rehashed version of most of the album.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Another synthpop-ish song, which I really like; really, for a song called Pressure, this is slick as hell. I really enjoy the vocals here, and combined with the instrumentals, they make me think of cool, smoky air. Maybe the vibes this track gives are supposed to be ironic?

**swankyhoodrat** (8.5): Kind of feels like Chocolate part 2 for some reason but I’m into it

**twat\_brained** (8.4): THIS is the true album closer for me. I think I hear glimpses of ILIWYS on this song too

**CarlieScion** (8): i'm docking this 2 points bc i have no idea what the fuck any of the lyrics mean

**thegeecyproject** (7): Is this album over yet?

**mylostlights** (6): A woefully overrated the 1975 song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This album is really just running out of steam and this song just isn’t anything special.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): yeah I feel like this album should have ended by now

**LazyDayLullaby** (4): No pressure

"Worship You" is a fantastically wacky follow up to the already chaotic "Finger Back". Ezra Koenig sings probably the fastest he has in his entirely life, alongside a nicely raga-esque beat, very familiar to the band member Rostam Batmanglij's heritage. "Red right hand" is apparently a very popular reference, but if I went any more in depth on that it would be clear I'm just taking shit from the Genius page. It's not my favorite, but the breakdown at the end is stellar.

**fourchip** (6.5): I apparently gave this an 8 when mocking up my scores? Don't know what I was thinking giving Vampire Weekend's cover of Cotton-Eyed Joe an 8 but I'm okay now and back to normal, no need for concern.

---
**twat\_brained** (9.4): it's one thing to type without spaces it's another to sing without spaces. Honestly this song is actually pretty fun to listen to. Wait what are those video game noises at the 2 minute mark? You know what? Never mind those. At least Ezra is actually trying to expand the sounds on this album rather than stick with what they know and hope that works for the best. Unlike a certain 4-character band. No, not that one.

**Mysario** (9): I really liked this song until I lost my hearing in the great 1:46 sound break

**Verdantshade** (9): ONLYINTHEWAYYOUWANTITONLYONTHEDAYYOUWANTIT

**DraculaWeekend** (8): So much energy

**mylostlights** (8): Maybe the weakest song on the album. The lyrics are fantastic, the performance is a definite callback to California English, but it really just doesn’t do anything for me musically. Also, I have issue with placing it after Finger Back, a song that already has a similar message in that it rejects traditional judeo-christian expectations, and does it better than Worship You does. Edit: "worship you is now an 8. scrap everything i said about it the song bangs"

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): FIFA <3

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.7): I like the way it soars at the end, but one of the weaker on the album

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): The funny thing about this so is that the chorus is the worst part of it, even if it's easily the most memorable; I actually really like the rest of the song, which really does resemble something you hear in a place of worship. At any rate, this is better than Worship by Years and Years and, yes, I did give that a hire score, rating is always relative.

**Raykel** (7.5): The verses are a mess, but I always love religious themes in songs that reflect on it

**thegeecyproject** (7.5): It's so fast, there's too much going on, I can't understand Ezra, what's happening aaaaa

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): please talk slower.

**bespectacIed** (6): yeehaw to this jewish rodeo mess

**sn0wgaryen** (6): I’m so sorry but these songs are kind of boring.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This is probably most VW’s fans least favorite song on this track, and I can see why. It’s a completely weird departure from the styles of the last few tracks, and feels like straight up jolly old mountain hiking music.

**CarlieScion** (5): sorry I found this very annoying

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): what the fuck is this

The originally high placement of this song thankfully fell, which I am personally thankful for. I've never been too keen on this song, and most people agree that it's a rather dreary end to the record.


**fourchip** (9): I'm a big fan of the ominous vibe this track gives off. The choir, ticking clock, odd drum patterns that seem to warp into gunshots the more you focus on them and the dark lyrics all combine really well into a cohesive sound without stepping on each others toes.

---
**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): choral humming is my kink

**Verdantshade** (10): what an insanely dark song. note the ticking clock in the background that calls back to don't lie

**\_wuw\_** (9.7): This song has some of my favourite lyrics on the record. It never fails to freak me the fuck out

**mylostlights** (9): really puts the fear of death in ya

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): This is so hauntingly beautiful and I love it

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): spoooky

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.1): More dark and brooding than the rest of the album. Fascinating melody

**bespectacIed** (8): This is such a filler in this fantastic album. Kinda brought down the vibe of the album.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): RIP Hudson 😔Also for a sec I thought I was listening to Arctic Monkeys again

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Another soft song with vivid imagery, just like Hannah Heart, but I ended up liking this a little more, even if they both got similar scores. I especially like the lyrics 'All you who changed your stripes/can wrap me in the flag'.

**Raykel** (7): Idk I like the haunting background, but I wish it were creepier

**sn0wgaryen** (7): The church-y feel adds an eerie vibe.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I really didn’t enjoy this track when I first heard it, but it has grown on me. It’s dark and menacing, and I still don’t understand its place in the tracklisting, it’s a brooding track about the Hudson River sandwiched between their most personal piece and a simple and uplifting piano outro. Maybe this is the unhappy ending in the film, the closing action that lets the viewer know that not everything is gonna be okay.

**swankyhoodrat** (6): Has too much going on at times.

**thegeecyproject** (5.5): it's a tad darker than the rest of the album. Not really feeling it.

**CarlieScion** (5): soooooo loooooong foooor nooooo reasooooon

**frogaranaman** (5): It’s a cool track but I’m utterly bored with it.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): this is so unnecessarily dramatic

**jamesfog** (3): So... what now?

Fourchip is a rat I love the pitched down vocals and string samples and underwater sounding bass guitar and mellow organ tones WHEW I feel like I'm at church listening to white people

**fourchip** (0): Anyways...

---

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my favorite love songs of all time

**CarlieScion** (9): kinda beautiful

**Verdantshade** (9): it's a pleasant song no doubt but apart from the guitar riff halfway through the song it feels like filler. also I don't feel the string intro and outro fit

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.8): ‘Hold me in your everla-ha-a-sting arms,’ it’s like he started to sneeze half way through the word

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Are those bongos? I mean they're making them sound really good here. Also my mom says this sounds like Paul Simon for whatever reason

**mylostlights** (8): This song’s score has changed a LOT in the past week, ranging from a 7 to a 9. I settled somewhere in the middle but it truly is a great song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): So, yeah, this blends a little too much with the rest of the album, but it's not boring to listen to; it's a great song, actually, even if I had trouble distinguishing it for the first few spins of the record. This observation was hard to wrap my finger around until I realised that you could consider this album one extended symphony, which makes the strict consistency more welcome than it usually would be.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A track I really enjoy, but admittedly goes on for a little longer than it should. The intro is great though, and the percussion on here is extremely underrated.

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): This song is a great reminder of Paul Simon's influence

**Raykel** (6): The violins were nice, but it sounded like the song was going to blow up and drag me and I'm still just sitting

**sn0wgaryen** (6): It’s okay but forgettable.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i could’ve guessed this sucked by its title

I actually didn't realize how similar the melody is on this song to "Tom's Diner", which might explain why I loved it so much on first listen. Something is OFF about the opening guitars to me, maybe it's the production? Nevertheless, this sexy romp is AM personified, and I'm shocked to see it so low! Josh Homme's part in this is barely there but it's welcome to see him at all. This song is practically a fan favorite.

**fourchip** (7.5): I like this but I think the guitar riff starts to grind on my nerves a little bit after a while.



---
**DraculaWeekend** (10): One of my favorites and probably one of AM's best songs. I love Josh Homme's influence, and the bridge is amazing. Definitely an 11 contender.

**Verdantshade** (10): the most overrated song in the band's discography? the guitar riff is killer but the song goes on for too long. it's definitely grown on me a lot, however

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): Truly a song to get rawed to

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I really enjoy the bop of a chorus, which resembles Tom's Diner in form and spirit to me, although I wouldn't say it outright copies it by any stretch of the imagination. It has a type of melody that plays in your head before you creep up to people and tickle them.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): I used to be obssesed with this song for some reason

**twat\_brained** (8.8): I'd rather the Monkeys took songs like this which didn't make the final cut and put them in the middle of the album so there's no lull

**mylostlights** (8): This is what should’ve followed WYOCMWYH

**sn0wgaryen** (8): I will gladly jam to this in my knee socks.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This opening riff is so hard that honestly the rest of the song can’t live up to it

**thegeecyproject** (8): I really got into this because there’s a pretty cool mashup on YouTube of this and Dua Lipa’s IDGAF. Check it out when you can.

**bespectacIed** (7.5): I love a Tom's Diner knockoff

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.3): Socks for your knees, or socks pulled up to your knees?

**CarlieScion** (7): I dont understand a word he sings but he sounds sexy sooo

**cucumberanti** (7): It’s similar to Arabella but it’s different enough that I don’t really mind. It’s such a laid back and moody song, high key obsessed with the way the cymbal is used.

**unovachamp** (7): All seven points are for my queen Alexa Chung

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): ok. at this point it's tough to really find anything unique about each particular song. they're all like lesser versions of Do I Wanna Know.

**aulyve** (6): Tom's Diner remains unbothered.

This song is a great heavy rocker, but following up tunes like "R U Mine?" and "Do I Wanna Know?" is no easy task. I honestly almost confused this song with "Snap out of It", which I prefer to this. It's still a tune, but it's not enough to really distinguish itself from the other songs on a strong record.

**fourchip** (8): This one's actually really catchy but I feel like it could have benefited from sounding less... reserved. IDK what I mean by that but I stand by it.

---
**swankyhoodrat** (10): Groovy af

**Verdantshade** (10): I know one for the road gets a lot of flak for being boring but its guitar solo is one of the best the band has ever done

**\_wuw\_** (9.7): I love how this flows and how the backup vocals dip in and out. The transition from this to Arabella is A+

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Underrated song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I like how this is third track here, because now that we've been sufficiently introduced to A.M we're literally 'on the road'-yeah, I'm reading too much into this. I like the weird sing-talking thing Alex does, especially with his accent, so this is a worthy successor to the first two songs, in my opinion.

**twat\_brained** (8): Those first two songs on the album are a very hard act to follow, and it shows with this song

**thegeecyproject** (7.5): I used to not be able to tell this apart from Arabella. Though it doesn’t have the War Pigs knock-off riffs so it’s at a slight disadvantage.

**cucumberanti** (7): Most of this song is decent but nothing to write home about. With that said, it really starts picking up when the guitar solo hits. Worth listening to just for everything after 2:30 mark.

**frogaranaman** (7): I listened to this on the road.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Very similar in style to the rest, but less memorable

**mylostlights** (7): a soft bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I really like the intro to this track, but it is a bit by-the-numbers and probably is one of the weaker songs on the album - the chorus is a banger but the verses aren’t that special.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): it's a more boring version of other songs

**OriginalKappa** (6.5): Yeah the main problem with this album is that it gets super bland past this point and up until Fireside tbh

**CarlieScion** (6): dodie clark kinda outsold

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): the train noise in the background is bothering me

**unovachamp** (4): The only good part is Matt going wooo-hooo

Normally I would have more to say about a song I've given an 11 but this time around I'm not really sure why I chose this song in specific. Maybe it's the nice organ sound? Maybe it's Ezra's endearing delivery? I think I just really love the chorus to this, and the outro of slack key guitar is a perfect ending. The harpsichords are cute, too. It's just kind of really nice baroque pop, nothing that actually seems off to me. It's perfect! Whew.

**fourchip** (7.5): Don't get me wrong, it's cute but also really forgettable.

---
**Darkra01** (11): i love this song more than i love dick and that's saying a lot

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Used to be my personal favorite on the album, the chorus is extremely catchy and the lyrics are just so beautiful (“the low click of a ticking clock”). A lot of the songs on MVOTC are super cinematic, and this one might be the most emotionally charged one of all.

**Verdantshade** (10): first of all I love how diane young transitions into this and second of all, it's one of vampire weekend's few love songs. 'old flames they can't warm you tonight, so keep it cool my baby' is one of my favourite lyrics by the band

**bespectacIed** (9.5): I love this song so much but ugh I wish it wasn't between the two best songs of the album.

**\_wuw\_** (9.3): the transition from diane young to this is so clean. really love rostam harmonizing with ezra throughout. the outro is unexpectedly sweet too.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.2): God’s love dyin’ young

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): thanks daddy Ezra

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Really enjoy how tender and elegant the melody is here, and overall this sounds really polished and pretty. This album is a pleasure to listen to in general if you have sensory sensitivity because of all the instruments, which makes me like all the songs here more than I usually would.

**mylostlights** (7.5): It’s definitely one of the weaker songs on the album, but it’s still a fantastic song.

**twat\_brained** (7): What's Ezra saying again? It's hard for me to pay attention to this because I'm still reeling from the aftershock of Diane Young

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): he sux at singing

**sn0wgaryen** (6): It’s okay.

I love the story told in the video with this song. A foray into really cute anthemic rock, Healy delivers a melodramatic yet really nice kind of sad rock song here. It's just U2 worshipping nonsense that's very enjoyable to me but obviously also represents the worst of the band's flaws to people: faux emotional teenage shite.

**fourchip** (10): I really like the melancholy vibe this song gives off and the heavy, airy production on it. A big fan favourite, and for good reason.


---

**Verdantshade** (11): where do I start with this song? it's in my top 5 songs of all time, and it's 4:15 minutes of perfect. it also has my favourite music video of all time. I've listened to and cried to this song so many times, and I even met one of my best friends because we both loved this song. [this is my favourite live version of the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6veap05rrg) and I can guarantee it has the best version of 'now everybody's dead' matty has ever done, and [here's the drive like I do version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JS9ZJ--01aw), which is easily as good as the version on the album

**CarlieScion** (10): BABE YOU LOOK SO COOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOL

**sn0wgaryen** (10): The first song I heard by them and got me hooked.

**thegeecyproject** (10): Now, aside from "The City" this is the other moment on the album where they really try to sound like U2. More specifically, they try to sound like "With Or Without You" U2. And it turns out amazing. Also, can I just say I love the video for this? I'll admit some days I like to fantasise about robbing banks and smoking cigarettes with my hot girlfriend. You look so cool, indeed.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): very comfortably the best song in the album and also The 1975's second best song after Somebody Else

**swankyhoodrat** (9.5): Really great and emotive vocal performance on this one.

**mylostlights** (9): One of my all time favorite the 1975 songs

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): As a true crime aficionado, I am obligated to give this a high score; nevertheless, this is also getting a near-perfect rating due to its own special qualities. I really get the sense that this is the intensest song on the album from the start of the track, but it especially reaches a peak where Matty Healy screams 'YOU LOOK SOOO COLD'.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): this is gonna get robbed isn’t it

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): i fall asleep to this song but in a good way

**bespectacIed** (8): the foundation of 1975 a e s t h e t i c

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Aside from the run where Matt proclaims everyone’s dead, this song is kinda a standard 1975 song.

**twat\_brained** (7): Big ups to the band for having the video accurately reflect the lyrics' subject matter but I'm not feeling this as much as the other singles

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.4): Sounds like a fashion commercial from the ‘80s

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): scheehatta faystrayat uhmaga tzee, ghamadha nose ad uh nehhhh veleeva, hobatta glow uhh starting to chafe.... n weshee guesis guhhhhnlee speggggggin bay stay stay. (stay. stay. stay). naGYIUA WUUUHHHHHN MUHHHHH TIME, NAGIYAU WUUHHHHHN MOAAAHHH FIGH, SYDDA WUUHHHN MOYYY LOYYYY, wiLAA MOWWWWW LOWWWwwee

**aulyve** (4): I thought he said musk when he said mask and was like "ok thats a weird way to talk about perfume" and that's the biggest impression this song left on me.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): Ugh, I do NOT see the hype behind this song, just really plods along to an unsatisfactory climax. Matty's singing is at it's worst with weird off-pitch screaming, it's just yuck.

I've never seen this song as the best or even one of the best of the record, so I'm surprised to see it almost make top 20. The pitch shifted "ya hey"s, the weird pretentious bridge in spoken word, it sounds like what this album must sound like to people who hate Vampire Weekend. It's a cutely revealing tale of how Ezra Koenig hates God now. Fun fact: "ya hey" kind of sounds like "Yahweh". The melodies are still distinctly sweet as ever, though.

**fourchip** (8): They actually kind of had me with this song. If the "ya heys" had been less irritating, I think it could have been a 10. Unfortunately, they're all over the track.

---

**mylostlights** (11): Do I really have to defend this one? The production, the compositions, the lyrics, and the performance are all impeccable. Like… they wrote a break up song about GOD like who the fuck does that? I’ll tell you who — three preppy Columbia alum living in New York City. Their minds…

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): I can’t imagine a 5 minute lowkey Vampire Weekend track about religion will go over well on popheads, but I see it as Vampire Weekend’s magnum opus, a song about struggling with self-acceptance and confidence that takes the backdrop of religious metaphor to describe Ezra’s own plights of starting in the band. There’s an unspeakable amount to unpack in the track, but the fact that it not only all works, but both has their best chorus and most daring experimentation is remarkable. It’s the soft climax of Vampire Weekend’s most personal album, and it’s perhaps Rostam’s best piece of writing.

**agentofscranton** (10): the digitized 'nyah' noise reminds me of this one kid in my secondary school english class who made like the same noise when we had to read of mice and men out loud in turns and it was his turn and he got to the n-word

**Verdantshade** (10): this really is the cornerstone of the album. it's an existential questioning of god and faith that many songs on the album lean towards, while it includes the pitch-shifting and spoken word found on diane young and finger back. I'd say this song definitively defines the album

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Ezra's weirdass monologue is the cherry on top of this in-your-face jewish bop.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): idk if it needs to be 5 minutes long but god damn it it's good

**Darkra01** (9): the bassline makes me wet i fucking love Rostam

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): My soul swooned , as I faintly heard the sound of Ezra Koenig referencing my favourite James Joyce line

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This seems to be considered the most outstanding track on the album, and while it's not really my favourite one (I do actually find the 'ya hey' hook pretty annoying, despite my high score), it's as intense as this album can get and it sounded amazing from the very first listen.

**twat\_brained** (8.8): The little pitched vocal in the background is a great hook if you asked me, and the thumping bass gives it an earwormy effect to it which I also admire as well. Usually this late into an album you'd expect right filler but apparently not so here!

**Mysario** (8.5): the end of the trilogy of Hey Ya and Ho Hey is a beautiful song, especially when the little hamsters come in to sing

**rotating3Dtext** (8): yAa hEY yoO HeY

**sn0wgaryen** (8): I love that weird little sound in the song.

**thegeecyproject** (8): Hey wait this isn't Outkast. But yeah, this is quite a heavy song thematically. I don't wanna get too heavy and personal, but while I still consider myself somewhat religious, this song does give me some things to consider.

**OriginalKappa** (7.5): I have an actual love hate relationship with this song. Originally my least favourite on the record and now it might be top 3 but also still could be last.

**Raykel** (5.5): Omg this reminds me that I used to have a dora doll that talked and sang and when it got old it would start playing on its own and its voice would alternate between the voice in this song and a deep slow demon voice. I don't like being reminded of this.

**Kaylaboe** (3): wh is this

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): chaotic neutral

"Finger Back" is if "Diane Young" was thrown into a fire and I'm just glad it made top 20. The staccato whew the organs and electro synths whew

**fourchip** (7.5): Sort of a banger but the terrible enunciation sometimes pulls me out of the track.



---

**\_wuw\_** (10): what a madding bop

**CarlieScion** (10): booooooooooooooooop

**Verdantshade** (10): I know lots of people don't like this song but it's one of my favourites on the album - it's so fun to sing along to and while it's kind of nonsensical, the spoken word interlude is cute as hell. who knew singing about death and blood was so fun?

**bespectacIed** (9.5): "i don't wanna live like this but I don't wanna die" MY KIND OF HYPE SONG.

**mylostlights** (9): Used to be one of my least favorite songs on the album, but it’s really aged well. Also I visited the falafel shop “Jerusalem” on 103rd and Broadway once. It’s very blue and very close to Columbia, in case y’all were curious.

**Mysario** (9): I'd give it a full 10 if it the interlude didn't slow the song down, but I can't explain why I love this song

**twat\_brained** (9): There's some sort of ineffable charm to this that I find myself appreciating and yet I'm not sure I'll ever listen to this again

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.8): I actually really enjoy this one. Breakneck pace and catchy.

**aulyve** (8.5): Love the Neutral Milk Hotel influence on this'n.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): That spoken interlude summarises everything I love about Vampire Weekend

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): probably one of the more divisive songs in the album but I fuck with it

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): OKAY THIS SONG SLAPS

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is another really upbeat chamber pop song on this album, which makes it just a little hard to distinguish. What prevents me from faulting it completely for that is how fun of a song it is; there's not a second that isn't filled with wonderful, rolling instrumentation (actually, I bet there is, but let's not nitpick) and it ends up sounding super pleasant.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): i didn't notice i was listening to the same song still when it ended

**foxxglove\_** (7): california english but make it discernible

**sn0wgaryen** (7): It sounds a bit too happy? Like so happy that it can’t be real happiness

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Honestly this song is a serious bop that is a little annoying at first, but just makes me want to jump around.

**jamesfog** (5): Very cool and interesting

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): jesus this guy can’t sing

One of the most popular songs from the record, I'm honestly surprised at this one's showing. Sure, the 1975 are packed with single material, and this one is a bit more unrecognizable compared to the others. But it's just so catchy! The whistling really makes this special.

**fourchip** (6): I've always heard this track being spoken of fondly by other fans but in my opinion this is where the album starts to dip in quality. It just didn't feel as unique as the other tracks and fails to capture my interest properly.

---
**CarlieScion** (10): This was nearly my 11 - I think this is the best song, lyrically, on this album

**sn0wgaryen** (10): This, along with the other 10s in this album, is one of the songs that really settled this band in for me.

**Verdantshade** (10): my least favourite of all the singles on their debut, but it's a fan favourite for a reason. I still see 'you're cold and I burn' everywhere on tumblr, and THE MUSIC VIDEO!!

**bespectacIed** (9.8): A close second to Heart Out as the best song. The synth is so good it makes me cry.

**twat\_brained** (9.6): Don't know what to say except how much I love this

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): This is probably one of the better songs on the album, but Kimbra's Settle Down >>>

**frogaranaman** (7): Runts are a pretty good candy, so I understand why he wants her Runts in his mouth. Annoying that Matty’s being so cheap, though.

**OriginalKappa** (7): The one thing I can appreciate about The 1975 is their willingness to kind of meld other genres into their brand of boring indie pop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I’m still not convinced this isn’t a cover of a Walk The Moon song

**Raykel** (6.3): I really like the verses, but don't like the chorus. This a weird score to give it but it's as indecisive as I am about this song.

**mylostlights** (6): This is boring

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I feel a little guilty giving this a low score; I remember it being kind of fun to listen to, after four and a half listens of this record, but for some reason, I actually don't know how it goes. The melody literally cannot settle down in my mind. The title is a lie. In my experience, whenever this sort of thing happens, it's because the song is too similar to everything else on the album, so that's that.

**LazyDayLullaby** (5): Not really a stand out for me

**aulyve** (4): If Mr. Healy's mission statement about making every song sound like a single means they tried to them all sound near-identical thennnnn congratulations.

Greatest opener of all time I love how it just launches right into the song and how it introduces the melancholy lyrical themes of the album immediately and the gospel aesthetic it's really a transcendental experience

Also yeah **fourchip** (8): What the fuck is an obvious bicycle?

---
**mylostlights** (10): What a fucking opener

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i’m crying

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song has always sounded like the smoky morning of a 1930s factory workers’ life. From the “punch-card” percussion to piano, the entire song just sounds like waking up, sipping coffee, and watching the whole world wake up with you. I still have no idea what Obvious Bicycle means, but this is one of Vampire Weekend’s best tracks and easily their best opening track.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): so listeeeeeeeeeeeeeen

**aulyve** (9): Kisses fingers like an Italian chef Beautoful.

**bespectacIed** (9): A tame, sweet opener. This is their weakest album opener tbh (just cause mansard roof and horchata are insanely good) but still a chill banger

**Verdantshade** (9): what better way to start an album about faith with a song about a lack of hope. i find it slightly boring but it's a lyrical masterpiece

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.6): A great album requires a great starter, and this is pretty solid. Really gets it gear

**frogaranaman** (8): The piano in this song reminds me of my first bike ride.

**Mysario** (7.5): I like how this song jumps you right into the album but I don't like how the song overstays its welcome

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): I find the melody to be a little too close to being boring but I actually really like the strings and the rest of the instruments on here so I'll give this a decent score. I also remember Kappy listening to this on #rates before this rate was submitted and me thinking 'What the fuck is an obvious bicycle? Why are all indie bands like this?' so you're welcome.

**Raykel** (7.2): Omg they tryna get me depressed

**CarlieScion** (7): stop telling me to listen and just get to what u wanna say, Ezra

**Kaylaboe** (7): obvious ariana bicycle jokes:

**sn0wgaryen** (7): But what is an obvious bicycle?

**jamesfog** (6): Cute...

**twat\_brained** (6): Why did I think this would be punchier and upbeat? I mean the only two VW songs I know are A-Punk and Diane Young so there's my first issue

**JanuraryFourteenth** (4): Just as I suspected, Vampire Weekend is still boring.

Just for that intro, bitch, you're safe as fuck! I don't know why this is so high don't ask me

---
**\_wuw\_** (10): This is the only song i know that neither gets any better or any worse with each listen. The rhythm section here is great.

**fourchip** (10): This seems to be a lowlight for most other people, but IMO personally this is a clear cut above the rest of the album. Love the beat but the random "shoo-wop"s are kinda weird.

**swankyhoodrat** (10): I feel like other people don’t tend to like this song as much as I do, but once I listen to this song, I just get sucked in. I can never listen to it less than 3 times in a row.

**Verdantshade** (10): this is an absolute gem in their discography, imo their most underrated. fireside calls back to the hotel suite of 505 and sounds exactly like the haunting psychedelic rock of humbug. it's also one of the liveliest (and most interesting) songs on the album

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): More solid background harmony nonsense words. Standout song overall

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): It's rare for me to appreciate a song's instrumentals over its melody or even its production, but this track ticks that off the list; it took awhile for me to remember how the chorus went exactly, but I did always remember what a pleasure the sounds in the background were. It's probably one of the uniquest tracks on A.M.

**DraculaWeekend** (8.5): Underrated. Love the drums here

**cucumberanti** (8): The most underrated B-side on AM. It captures that feeling of reminiscing on a failed relationship and wondering about what could’ve been so well. The driving rhythm and the bittersweet lyrics make it such a haunting song.

**mylostlights** (8): This is definitely the most different song on the album, but I still loved it.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): And the album picks back up again.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The chorus here is underrated, that is all.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): vv nice

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Definitely an improvement from the last few songs

**Raykel** (7.5): The bridge's instrumental is so beautiful

**CarlieScion** (7): ngl all these songs are kinda blending together

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): this says choo choo in the background what the hell

**Darkra01** (10): actually this is the best song on the album, fite me

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): I'd not heard this before the Rate. Now it's my favourite on the album by far. The chorus - the whole song - is like some long lost John Lennon solo track. Love AM slow jams

**swankyhoodrat** (10): I love this song but I’m not sure how happy I am that this basically predicted that TBHC would be their next album lmao. The Lennon-wannabe vibe is at its best here (please shave the goatee, Alex).

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song almost feels like a prelude to the lounge-y Tranquility Base Hotel + Casino, and honestly, it’s one of my favorite tracks on the album. It’s slow but it sounds like a summer sunset. A little chilly, but a lot of warmth.

**fourchip** (9.5): I think this one's really underrated actually, it always gives me this really strong mental image of a party in full swing being viewed in slow-motion. I think it could have benefited from a little more oomph for a 10 but as it is is still great.

**mylostlights** (9): The is one of my favorites for sure.

**Mysario** (9): it's such a pretentious song and I love it sorry not sorry

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): In 2013, a party anthem was an EDM song with maximalist production and thousand of remixes, but this song is different. Maybe party scenes were different over the pond, but it resembles a slow, traditional dance ballad in all but lyrics and it ends up being great.

**\_wuw\_** (8.8): Not the best Arctic Monkeys ballad but the best ballad on this album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): sad parties yay woo

**Verdantshade** (8): who knew that this would foreshadow the sound of AM6. yes, it's lyrically outstanding but it's also pretty boring. I always thought the lyric was 'collar popped like cantona' until very recently

**DraculaWeekend** (7.5): This is sooo slow but it has definitely grown on me

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): love me some depressing party anthems

**Raykel** (7.2): You know I thought I was only going to want fast paced songs from them but they do this sound well

**cucumberanti** (7): This is the song that comes on at the end of the night, when the party is almost over and everyone is getting ready to go home. I used to hate it with a burning passion but I’ve learned to appreciate it. It’s wistful and reminds me of Cornerstone.

**sn0wgaryen** (7): Alex’s voice is suited for slow ballads like this and fast paced bangers like “Do I Wanna Know?”

**thegeecyproject** (6.5): False advertising. Doesn’t really make me wanna party, but it’s pretty moody.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): It's not even in my top 10 party anthems tbh

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Misleading Title

**jamesfog** (5): Oh.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4.5): how the hell am i supposed to grind on bitches to this in the club

**twat\_brained** (4): I mean I get that they're making this an anti-party anthem to contradict the title but the album is going through such a downward spiral after an incredible start and I really want it to pick back up soon
