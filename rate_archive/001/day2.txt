1989 vs. Emotion vs. Dangerous Woman: Day 2, the road to the top 10
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5156nu/1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman_day_2_the_road/

Let's get this started once again! Some notes:

* I'm revealing 18 songs today, which will bring us to the top 10.
* The top 10 songs have significantly higher scores than the rest, which was a nice coincidence. That means that even if your favorite song came in at #11, it wasn't really that close to making it to the next day.
* The controversy scores that come after the averages are a measure of how divisive the voting was. The average for that is a 2, and anything higher than a 2.2 should be considered controversial.
* Apologies in advance if I fucked up some scores or forgot to include your comments. I promise I did my best!

I'll start at around 12pm PST. Or earlier. Idk. It'll be when I feel like it, but I promised people 12pm so I don't want to start too early.

**This thread is now sorted by new. If you get here late, and if you would like to see the reveals in order, you can either scroll all the way to the bottom or sort it by old.**

Startlingly beautiful, this is our last track that failed to average above a 7. When I first got 1989, I wrote this one off as boring, but it really stuck out to me when I revisited the album before doing this rate. While I still don’t understand the intricacies of some of the lyrics, they’re still great; “Rain came pouring down when I was drowning / That's when I could finally breathe” is fantastic imo. And yes, I stopped right before this song yesterday just because I wanted to leave Taylor with more songs heading into today.

“i cri evrytme,” admits jimmy345960. misguidedzombie says it’s “lyrically the best on the album,” a sentiment I agree with, while ffourthofjuly calls it “o v e r r a t e d.” breadvelvet just says, “It’s ok. Positive: a song with a fairly engaging melody and shout out to Imogen heap I see u. Negative: another song to add to Axis of Awesome’s 4 chord medley if they ever decide to revisit it.” eklxtreme says, “punch a hole in my ear, but lyrics are not bad.” It’s the roof, sis. Meanwhile, the self-proclaimed biased Taylor stan NapsAndNetflix gives it a fucking 2 and says it’s “one of her worst songs ever. At her concert she had a big inspiring speech about who knows what I was getting drinks and it was like a 4 hour long speech and it all led up to THIS and I don't think I've ever groaned so hard in my life.” Imma need you to turn in your stan card. Also, Altiondsols pops a blood vessel, saying, “I hate this album so much. How does Taylor manage to be so consistently boring? You would think that she'd just accidentally do something interesting at least once, like a stopped clock is right twice a day, but nope.”

MrSwearword, returning for another day of shade, says, “I do feel clean after this DRANO of a song.” TeamAwesome4 recognizes the beauty of the song, calling it a “perfect closer to the album (save for bonus tracks, of course). Lyrically some of her best work. Verses are better than the chorus, which, to me, shows some really impressive writing.” angusaditus says, “I live that this is kinda dark,” and TheAllRightGatsby sings its praises as well, deeming it “quite possibly the most unambiguously and consistently fantastic song on this album, probably my favorite on the album.”

I’m pretty sure I gave this a 10 just for the pretty xylophone-esque riff things in the chorus. They’re so pretty, I live. The rest of the song is really solid too, with some of DW’s best writing.

“Yes!” says angustaditus after giving it an 8, and ffourthofjuly admits she “was expecting a frank ocean cover, got something different. still had high vocals though.” Altiondsols says, “This could have easily been a 10, but there's this really annoying synth layer at the end of some of the lines that blows my eardrums out whenever I listen to it in the car.” MrSwearword says it’s “a bit too filler for me to like fully; interesting production,” and breadvelvet says, “tbh i dislike the ‘i'm, just, think-ing bout you’ sort of stilted melodic line that runs throughout, but the song is a really nice atmospheric closing to the album.” Ariana really nails atmosphere on this album tbh. eklxtreme says it’s a “nice ending,” and JoeTheMo calls it “just beautiful, especially near the end.” Not to be outdone, the song’s sole 11-giver Zugtris crowns it the “GOAT ARI SONG.”

“Queen of blending into her favourite colour.” - BreezySeason

I’ve read a reviewer, characterizing Carly as a songwriter, say that she has a tendency to randomly incorporate grotesque imagery into her lyrics, e.g. “who gave you eyes like that / said you could keep them?” This is another apt example, as Carly sings about melting down and blending (ouch) with her lover. I’m not a fan of this song, but I can...sort of appreciate what’s going on, I guess.

MrSwearword, disgusted, says, “What kind of bad Imogen Heap impersonation was that?!” Cpr196 dangerously ventures towards /r/shitamericanssay territory and says that “favorite is misspelled so I had to deduct a point, someone teach Carly how to spell.” TeamAwesome4, who misspelled the title of his 11 so I almost missed their blurb, calls it their “Favorite song on the Album, of the year, and maybe ever.” Where are your “u”s? The sole hater KometBlu says it’s “One of the blandest songs ever made. Literally how,” while ffourthofjuly says she’s “definitely warmed up to this song over time, i think it’s stunningly underrated and is a very beautiful piece to sum up the album.” breadvelvet says, “This song is really sweet. Not much else I have to say about it haha,” and eklxtreme, intrigued, says “Manchester accent? Very nostalgic chorus comes like a shockwave.”

A bop, but a bit forgettable. I’m shocked this got this far tbh. I also would prefer to go throughout the rest of my life not hearing Ariana sing about “hood love” ever again.

hellomochi says it’s “Lyrically empty and the chorus is so repetitive.” jimmy345960 just says, “love it,” but Altiondsols deems it “filler.” KometBlu is bopping though, saying, “This track is what happens when you combine quality with bop. That's all,” and eklxtreme is also stanning, saying, “piano after the chorus woooo, this rhythm got me dancing, we got that ok, bad word.”  breadvelvet gives it a “cheesy acoustic guitar/10. also ‘hood love/good love’ is not a good/hood rhyme under any circumstance gross. she really doesn't sell the dangerous character that well here either.” Ugh, I hate that rhyme too. MrSwearword says it gives him “some ‘Just Fine’ by Mary J. Blige teas but Ari has done better.” I think this is the first time I’ve seen Mary referenced on this subreddit.

“Queen of catching fevers.” - BreezySeason

Finally. #JusticeForFirstTime.

Altiondsols calls it “filler,” and I can’t help but agree. ffourthofjuly confuses me, saying, “this song is very very good and every element of it is so amazing and beautiful and im just grateful to live in the same timeline as this bop.” eklxtreme just says they’re “drowning in these synths,” and apparently it’s not the good kind since they then give it a 3. 

TeamAwesome4 makes me appreciate the song a bit more:
>"I wrote some things I didn't send, Three words to say that meant a lot to me" are some killer lyrics, and subtle also, while still being very clear.

MrSwearword also wants to point out some lyrics:
>“Don’t tell me this is how it ends”…on nothing good…

A very pretty album opener that I can’t envision fitting in anywhere else on the album. I keep on hearing “I never lose,” in the chorus though, and it makes me think of DJ Khaled. That is not necessarily a bad thing, of course.

Batmanji loves it, saying, “If I could have one 11 per album this would be the one.” MrSwearword says it’s “boring but shows her potential,” which I’ll accept as a compliment, and angusaditus calls it a “cute opening.” Altiondsols disagrees, saying it’s an “odd choice for an opening track” and that it “would have been a 9 if not for Jaaaaaaaames Deeeeeeeeean.” ffourthofjuly also disagrees with how it opens the album, saying, “its pretty but im not sure how it is as an album opener, i really love the old-school vibes it puts out though. a solid song.” mother_rucker says it “gives me Yours Truly vibes and I liiiive,” and breadvelvet comes through with the comparisons: “such a shame that her first album started with ‘Honeymoon Avenue’ and every other album intro she makes will be a complete and utter disappointment by comparison. Nice string arrangements though; the pizzicato section created an excellent atmosphere and the outro of this song really caught my attention in particular.” eklxtreme says it has a “great melody and pizzicato instrumentation, bass guitar adds a lot.” YAS, I live for the pizzicato. Where my band nerds at?

It’s grown on me, but I never understood why this song was such a fan favorite. I also remember the Swifites getting in a tizzie with the rumors that an amazing music video was coming, and then we ended up with...that. Only Blank Space, Style, and Wildest Dreams now remain on 1989. How far will they go?

“‘We’re all bored / we’re all so tired of everything’; FITTING,” says MrSwearword. angusaditus calls it a bop and says it “would be a great opener to the album.” I agree, but at the same time anything is better than WTNY. Altiondsols calls it “the New Americana that’s OK to like” (lmfao) while eklxtreme calls it “pretty generic bubblegum.”

TeamAwesome4 has a great writeup:
>Taylor does a better job describing present day culture in the first verse than any article or essay or rant I've ever come across. "We show off our different scarlet letters, trust me mine is better" might be the best lyric on the entire cd. The 2nd verse is far worse than the first, save for "The rumors are terrible and cruel, but honey most of them are true." FORESHADOWING TO SNEK REVEAL. Unlike Ariana's "Focus" that entitles drama queens to be drama queens, this line says, "Sure, make a big deal about it. I claimed you did something nasty, that was mean of me. But you still did it. Don't play innocent." This song deserved to be bigger. The bridge has no reason to be there though.

As does breadvelvet:
>Rolling Stone’s resident poptimist, Rob Sheffield, listed this song as [one of the top 25 songs of 2014](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/rob-sheffields-top-25-songs-of-2014-20141222). While I strongly disagree with his decision to both rank it at #2 and rank it below “She Looks So Perfect” by 5SOS (remember, this is the year that fka twigs graced us all with “Two Weeks”, FlyLo put out “Never Catch Me” with Kendrick, and St. Vincent released “Digital Witness”—and literally none of these tracks appear on the list wtf), I do agree in that I also have no idea why this wasn’t on the actual album. This song sounds so much more like a closing statement and a sigh of relief than “Clean”, though I didn’t dislike that track.

“Queen of being the magic you won't ever see.” - BreezySeason

Somewhere out there, a Pitchfork editor just collapsed to the ground. The Dev Hynes-produced Best New Track of April 8, 2015 barely misses the top 20 when it could’ve quite easily fit into the top 10. The number of low scorers shocked me when I was collecting ballots, and I can’t believe this is the first track off the standard edition to go. What’s worse is that the second one to go will make even less sense…

“Great track but a little cheesy when I'm not in the exact mood for it so I had to dock a point and a half,” says TheAllRightGatsby. jimmy345960 says he “wanted to skip” it and awards it a 6.9 probably just to keep himself entertained. Altiondsols succinctly calls it “annoying” and MrSwearword, being himself, says, “She’s aware of her lack of vocal abilities…sadly the label wasn’t…” misguidedzombie can only hear the bass and says it “reminds me of Seinfeld every time.” breadvelvet is in love with it, though, calling it “one of the few ballads I’ve found myself genuinely enjoying. The buildup towards the end is stunning.”

deleted: I kinda agree. It was a very solid album, but it didn't make me think this is the best thing I've ever listened to. She doesn't have the personality and power of the other two.

The Carly fillers are just not stand out songs. Catchy, but not hot material.

“Queen of bops.” - BreezySeason

A bit of a bop, but on an album full of bops, it doesn’t quite do it for me. I never understood why so many people liked this song. (#JusticeForBlackHeart)

“Play this at the bar and I’m ready to go,” proclaims angusaditus. TheAllRightGatsby says, “This is a great track but the house style just isn't for me; imo Tonight I'm Getting Over You is a better version of this track.” Yas, I love that song. MihaMijat calls it “the most generic song on the album,” but KometBlu is stanning down: “Now this is how you do a disco house bop. A Kygo remix would've sent this flying up the charts, still pressed about this being relegated to just a deluxe track.” And finally, here’s MrSwearword with the shade: “It’s obvious she was there to dance and not take vocal lessons; at least interesting production choices were made.” Admit it, your bussy quivered a bit when you listening to it.

potrap: Fun fact about I Didn't Just Come Here To Dance and Tonight I'm Getting Over You: Carly demo'd IDJCHTD aaaages ago. When she was in the studio with Max Martin recording TIGOY, she wanted to show him IDJCHTD the whole time. At the end of the night he was about to leave, but she played the song for him and he stayed for an hour to bop to it. (This is from a TIME interview, I'll link to it later). Queen of convincing Max Martin to stick around by playing him dance tracks.

“#TaylorsOutForHarambe.” - BreezySeason

Yes, it’s pretty obviously inspired by Lana, but the sigh she does in the chorus? Lana wishes she came up with that. That aside, this isn’t the third best song off 1989, but with it being a single, I guess it was obvious it would make it decently far. The music video is also quite pretty, even though it was riding off the outrage over Cecil the lion, which I think is ridiculous. Inbe4 Harambe jokes in the comments.

NapsAndNetflix says, “The more I hear it the more I love it.” Yeah, it is a bit of a grower. angusaditus just calls it “cute” while MrSwearword has something nice to say for once: “took FOREVER for me to stomach but I like it now.” jimmy69420 says that it’s “like Lana but better,” and Altiondsols goes as far to say, “This song feels like the better Blank Space.” kickit says the song “goes from good to phenomenal when that bridge hits” (yas, the bridge is the best part!) and MihaMijat calls it “the best song on the album.” 

breadvelvet comes through once again:
>repetition is markedly less present in this song. There is still some admittedly, but Swift does these neat little octave jumps to keep things moving along nicely. This is my first time listening with headphones, and I’m just noticing this string section too, and it works super well! Another really minor issue that I had had for this album so far was that, if the soaring production and lyrics had been removed and replaced with a metronome and, say, a saxophone playing the same melody, it might be rather difficult to pinpoint where exactly the chorus is. It sounds stupid in writing, but just look at “Out Of The Woods”, for example. The verses are so much more bouncy in their melody than the chorus, it doesn’t sound like a point in the song which you “arrive” at as a climax, but rather just another part of the song you just sort of pass through. But what I really like about “Wildest Dreams” is that the chorus feels like an event. Hearing it for the first time, any listener would be able to tell you that the title of the song is “Wildest Dreams” because there’s so much vocal emphasis and drawn-out timing on that phrase. Other songs like “Style”, as much as I like it, are a bit less precise than this song in terms of melodic phrasing, and I think it resorts to lyrical repetition in order to get the point across that, yes, that “out/of/style” phrase thing is where the title is located.

deleted: i was..... not expecting this. personally, i quite like the song and think it should have made top 15 at least, but i guess i'm not too devastated by this either? i mean, it's definitely better than a lot of the songs still in on E-MO-TION, but at this point i'm pretty sure the top 10 is going to just be made up of carly rae jepsen songs, lol

This really should be in the top 10, y’all. At least it has the honor of being the longest-lasting bonus track. 

“Yep, it's better than Into You, Greedy, and Run Away With Me. Sorry not sorry, this is just one of the strongest choruses ever written. Every time I hear this song I go into the zone,” says Altiondsols. Your 11 was not in vain. angusaditus says, “This kills me. I had it on repeat the first couple of days after the release.” jimmy345960 just says “SLAAY” KometBlu also loves it: “twin Sister of Into You and just as amazing. The production is more laid back in this, more dreamy, sensual, and chill. Love the vulnerability in the lyrics and the vocals. mmm esp the vocals woo, that run at the end > your phave lbr. This might just be best Ari song ever.” ffourthofjuly loves it as well, saying, “This song is about sex but yknow what im feeling it a lot, like i feel like this is a #highlight on the album.”

breadvelvet isn’t as big a fan, saying, “The chorus soars quite nicely but the lyrics are kind of word salad-y if that makes sense idk.” MrSwearword calls it “filler” and eklxtreme says the “actual chorus is not that special though, i want to like it but the lyrics r kinda cringe.” misterralex has some stern words for these naysayers, though: “If Ariana's voice at the end of this didn't touch you at all, then you need to re-evaluate your purpose in life.”

“Queen of being homeothermic.” - BreezySeason

That BreezySeason quote is my favorite of the batch tbh. But wtf, why is this out so early? This was also the most controversial Emotion track, and I don’t fully understand why. I thought we had all agreed it was amazing and deserved top 10. Ugh.

First, the 11-givers. “YES! That bass kills me every time,” says angusaditus. breadveltvet, forever the wordsmith, has a lot to say:
>tbh at first I was fairly underwhelmed with this track and slightly weirded out by the breathy vocal delivery. But since then I’ve grown to absolutely love this song and cherish it as my absolute favorite from the album. I know I focus a weird amount on production, but my god, the production on this is insane. It’s subtle and creeping until you find yourself drowning in the synths. Carly Rae’s lyrics are usually quite literal and direct (which is honestly a big part of her charm), but here she fully embraces the figurative. I rarely consider the lyrics much when listening to pop music, but I’m in love with the opening lines to this song. Even the bridge thing before the last chorus, where one might expect her to crescendo to shimmering peaks a la “All That”, takes risks and subverts by doing an octave drop, to spectacular effect. I cannot praise this song enough.

Meanwhile, hellomochi just says “I don’t get this song” and gives it a NAPPY 5. Ffourthofjuly predicts my criticism and says, “unpopular opinion this isn’t the best song on here im so sorry fans pls don’t expose me i don’t like warm blood AS MUCH AS ANYTHING ELSE ON HERE not that its a bad song im just not feeling it.” Altiondsols straight-up calls it a “Garbage song. Half-assed production, and Carly just sounds bored out of her mind.” MrSwearword says it has a “jarring title, less than acceptable payoff.”

kickit says, “The song pulses throughout and ends up in outer fucking space, what's not to like.” I wonder that too! MihaMijat just says “Amazing” and eklxtreme says there’s a “nice change of vocals.” TheAllRightGatsby also has a great writeup: “Would have been a 7.0 if I hadn't seen her live and realized how amazing this song is, and it would have been a 10 except that low pitch-shifting thing in the chorus still kind of only 75% works for me.” I regret missing her concert more with every passing day.

[/r/popheads/comments/5156nu/1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman_day_2_the_road/d79h989/]

=====

TheAllRightGatsby: I mean, we're not Pitchfork, I don't feel the need to arbitrarily give 9.3s when I don't actually have any problems with a song and when I legitimately love the songs. I think people are mixed up with what "objectivity" in the context of this contest is; I take it as not allowing outside factors and other people's opinions to influence your ratings, but I don't take it to mean that you have to be strictly objective and compare everything to "A Day In The Life" by The Beatles or something. Your personal enjoyment of a song SHOULD be a factor, that's the whole point of this contest. I'll admit I gave 10s to most of the songs on Emotion, but the songs where I don't enjoy them and think they are good enough to be a 10, I didn't give them to. I feel like if a song isn't "objectively perfect" but my *enjoyment* of a song is perfect than that's still a 10. And I don't think that's ridiculous because I held every song on every album to that same standard, and some of them are much better than others. I mean, I'm willing to temper my lack of enjoyment of a song with its objective strengths, but I'm not gonna temper my enjoyment of a song with its "objective weaknesses" (which I don't really think are a thing).

=====

TeamAwesome4: Well, that's an essay right there.

That being said, I know exactly where you're coming from.  I think it's dumb to try to rate art objectively (be it music, movies, books, paintings, etc.)  For example, my favorite movie is Lilo and Stitch, but it's far from perfect objectively.  It's got weird stuff all over, like the whole Hawaii x Elvis thing that is really, really weird..  I'd still rate it a 10.  I still think that people are inflating their scores a bit too much though.  10's shouldn't be that common, even on albums as good as these.

Regardless, as long as everyone holds every album to the same standards, I think that's as good as we should hope for.

TheAllRightGatsby: I mean... We all individually rated the albums... It's not like we fed off of each others' fandom and got carried away with our ratings for Emotion. We all had every opportunity to rate everything exactly like we wanted. Tbh I was a lot more generous with the non-CRJ albums than I prob should have honestly been. I'm against the CRJ circlejerk too but this isn't that, this is basically as objective as this is gonna get. This community just like Emotion more, and I get that that's disappointing for the non-CRJ fans and it's fair to be annoyed by that but constantly dismissing everything involving CRJ as the circlejerk is almost as annoying as the circlejerk itself.

This also deserved top 10. That marimba gives me so much life, ugh I love it when pop songs incorporate it. Ariana’s featherlight vocals are also amazing.

MihaMajit says it “gets old pretty fast,” and MrSwearword says it has “weird pacing, but it works overall to me.” TeamAweseom4 says, “I feel like this song is like 90% chorus. Lucky for it, I love the chorus.” Yeah, the chorus is pretty amazing. angusaditus says he can “hear it on repeat for hours,” and TheAllRightGatsby takes it a step further, saying, “If I ever manage to resist dancing to this song when the chorus drops, either call me a therapist cuz clearly the joy has gone even more completely out of even my depressed ass's life, or call me a doctor cuz I must be comatose.” breadvelvet says it “feels like she’s not sure what sort of vocal delivery to give for this song. the backing vocals are strong/aggressive but the lead is like trying to be smooth? Idk but it works pretty well as a song, though the whole time I was waiting it to elevate to a place it never really reached. It’s p chill my dudes.” And finally, Altiondsols just says, “Filler.”

“Queen of really really liking things.” - BreezySeason

You guys don't understand the GENIUS behind this song. Although I'm surprised this got this far, since it was sub-20 for most of the tabulations.

breadvelvet DOES get the genius:
>guilty pleasure. I was thinking of doing an educational video on this track and how it encapsulates tons of pop music tropes, namely the major pentatonic scale (which the chorus melody perfectly latches onto at first). Tropes aren’t a bad thing, but the more one adheres to, the “safer” a song feels, and that can often work to an artist’s detriment, as with this case. I’m quite fond of the airy production on here, however.

And now we return to the others. “What were you thinking?” wonders MihaMajit, flashbacks of a #39 peak clouding his mind. ffourthofjuly doesn’t care though, saying, “unpopular opinion i really really really really really really really like this song.” eklxtreme just wonders, “how did this flop?” I mean, if the GP let Lukas Graham happen, they have limited taste. “Tom Hanks, sashay away,” says MrSwearword, who seems to be rating the (bad) music video, as well as misguidedzombie, who says, “Tom Hanks was robbed of the Oscar for this.” TheAllRightGatsby, on the other hand, says it’s “great but a little overproduced and as much as I like the chorus it IS repetitive,” and KometBlu says, “This is cute I guess. I just wish they weren't all 'ok let's rehash the last lead and call it a day'. A Problem->Focus tea.” JoeThaMo gives it a backhanded compliment, saying, “I've heard this song on the radio before I listened to Emotion and almost didn't give Carly a chance because it's basically Call Me Maybe 2.0. It works much better in conjunction with the rest of the album, but it's still my least favorite track.” Finally, jimmy345960 echoes a lot of people’s comments in the last thread: “I don't really like you.”

“Queen of remembering being naked.” - BreezySeason

Don't get me wrong, it's a bop and I love the chorus, but wtf? 14? Although it does have the 2nd best opening line (1st place goes to Warm Blood, ofc). 

Buzzfeed aficionado eklxtreme “loves the lyrics and references,” and NapsAndNetflix, slapping it with a 10, says, “I feel this will score unfortunately low so a pre-emptive fuck y'all.” Oh honey, if only. MrSwearword asks, “Were these hallucinations those of success?” while angusaditus labels it a “bop.” TheAllRightGatsby says, “I went into this thinking I was gonna give it something less than a 10 but then the drums came in and I went weak in the knees and I was helpless.” I don’t think that’s healthy. KometBlu, somehow deeming this the worst song out of all three albums, drags iT: “Everyone who worked on this atrocity needs to be banned from making music for at least 10 years. This is not an exaggeration; I still have PTSD-induced nightmares from this track.”

Really really boring. Worse than Focus imo.

kickit drags a bit, asking, “What is she saying tho,” and breadvelvet joins in: “You named the album after this? Also wtf is that vocoder towards the end this is baffling in all the wrong ways. It’s an okay song.” eklxtreme digs it, saying, “badass, vocals on point, instrumentation lowers at the right time to highlight vocals, hihats are subtle and gr8,” and ffourthofjuly somehow has a stranger description, saying that “this song makes me wanna like….join a cult idk how else to explain it it’s a nice song.” Established h8r NapsAndNetflix says, “I sort of liked this song originally but it progressively has turned worse and worse the more I hear it. If this survey was months ago this would be higher.” MrSwearword actually likes a song for once, saying, “LOVE this song; video could’ve been better but song wise AMAZING.” Altiondsols sums up a lot of forum homosexuals’ feelings on this song, saying, “This song makes me feel like a dangerous woman and i'm a dude.”

“Queen of requesting love.” - BreezySeason

This was top 10 until like, the last day. I'm sad it dropped out.

KometBlu seems frustrated: “Ok @ chorus being that lazy and tragic that it deletes everything good in the rest of the song.” Um, the chorus is the best part though. ffourthofjuly says she “loves the synths here, and how un-ballad it feels even though it is, in fact, a ballad type song. very minimalist.” MrSwearword, on the other hand, says it’s “so clunky and redundant I’m surprised Taylor didn’t sing this,” and Altiondsols says it “ has amazing bridges but the chorus is a flop. Why does the synth just go on vacation? Could have easily been a 10.” eklxtreme has other issues, saying, “The chorus falls flat and feels empty, I can appreciate the instrumentation and harmonies though.”

breadvelvet returns for another great writeup:
>The production massively outshines the songwriting on this track to be perfectly honest. I gauge the quality of songwriting on whether or not I think I’d enjoy an acoustic cover of it, and I think any acoustic cover of this song would be pretty bad so

>i mean the production’s nice and minimalist, and takes risks, which is always appreciated in pop music. Less is more generally even though there’s not much to this track at all

Average: 7.65

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfN4PVaOU5Q)

“Queen of changing for you.” - BreezySeason

Oops. Yeah I dragged this; it just doesn’t do anything for me. Although I love the passion in her voice in the prechorus. 

TheAllRightGatsby defends his choice of 11: “Since I heard this last December it's become one of my favorite songs ever and I had to give it my 11, there were other candidates but it had to be this.” ffourthofjuly goes awf, saying, “THIS SONG IS A REAL FUCKING BOP AND LITERALLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS OF ALL TIME the speaking parts between the lines of the prechorus makes me die a lil i love it.” Angusaditus says, “Once again: I really like sad/dark Carly.” I can hear sad, but dark?  

TeamAwesome4 ponders the lyrics: "Self awareness is always good. Also, the chorus is one long sentence, and I usually don't like that (Bieber's ‘Love Yourself’ comes to mind), but here, I'm good with it.” MrSwearword can’t tell that the album’s over and simply says, “I swear I hated this repetitive song like 3 tracks ago or something.” kickit labels it a “very strong finish” when Warm Blood obviously should have been the closer, and misguidedzombie gives BreezySeason a run for his money, calling Carly “queen of basslines.”

breadvelvet: Holy shit. My mom came into my room to bring me a plate of chicken nuggets and I literally screamed at her and hit the plate of chicken nuggets out of her hand. She started yelling and swearing at me and I slammed the door on her. I'm so distressed right now I don't know what to do. I didn't mean to do that to my mom but I'm literally in shock from the results tonight. I feel like I'm going to explode. Why the fucking fuck is she losing? This can't be happening. I'm having a fucking breakdown. I don't want to believe the world is so corrupt. I want a future to believe in. I want Carly to be president and fix this broken country. I cannot fucking deal with this right now. It wasn't supposed to be like this, I thought she was polling well in r/popheads???? This is so fucked.

MihaMijat: Pretty much saw this coming, except for Boy Problems and Making The Most Of The Night instead of Touch It and Dangerous Woman, since DW was rated like 2nd or 3rd best song of the year a while back. STILL R I G G E D
