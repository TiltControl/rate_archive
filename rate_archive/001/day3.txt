1989 vs. Emotion vs. Dangerous Woman: Day 3, the finale!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/51as72/1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman_day_3_the/

It's time! Will Taylor and Ariana's 4 songs occupy 10-7? Will Blank Space somehow win? Who knows? Find out today!

* I'm revealing the 10 remaining songs today! They have significantly higher scores than the rest, which was a nice coincidence. 
* The controversy scores that come after the averages are a measure of how divisive the voting was. The average for that is a 2, and anything higher than a 2.2 should be considered controversial.
* Apologies in advance if I fucked up some scores or forgot to include your comments. I promise I did my best!

I'm also going to be posting 16-11 with the detailed writeups again. We won't get started for a while, so I encourage you to read what your fellow members wrote for these songs.

This also deserved top 10. That marimba gives me so much life, ugh I love it when pop songs incorporate it. Ariana’s featherlight vocals are also amazing.

MihaMajit says it “gets old pretty fast,” and MrSwearword says it has “weird pacing, but it works overall to me.” TeamAweseom4 says, “I feel like this song is like 90% chorus. Lucky for it, I love the chorus.” Yeah, the chorus is pretty amazing. angusaditus says he can “hear it on repeat for hours,” and TheAllRightGatsby takes it a step further, saying, “If I ever manage to resist dancing to this song when the chorus drops, either call me a therapist cuz clearly the joy has gone even more completely out of even my depressed ass's life, or call me a doctor cuz I must be comatose.” breadvelvet says it “feels like she’s not sure what sort of vocal delivery to give for this song. the backing vocals are strong/aggressive but the lead is like trying to be smooth? Idk but it works pretty well as a song, though the whole time I was waiting it to elevate to a place it never really reached. It’s p chill my dudes.” And finally, Altiondsols just says, “Filler.”

“Queen of really really liking things.” - BreezySeason

You guys don't understand the GENIUS behind this song. Although I'm surprised this got this far, since it was sub-20 for most of the tabulations.

breadvelvet DOES get the genius:
>guilty pleasure. I was thinking of doing an educational video on this track and how it encapsulates tons of pop music tropes, namely the major pentatonic scale (which the chorus melody perfectly latches onto at first). Tropes aren’t a bad thing, but the more one adheres to, the “safer” a song feels, and that can often work to an artist’s detriment, as with this case. I’m quite fond of the airy production on here, however.

And now we return to the others. “What were you thinking?” wonders MihaMajit, flashbacks of a #39 peak clouding his mind. ffourthofjuly doesn’t care though, saying, “unpopular opinion i really really really really really really really like this song.” eklxtreme just wonders, “how did this flop?” I mean, if the GP let Lukas Graham happen, they have limited taste. “Tom Hanks, sashay away,” says MrSwearword, who seems to be rating the (bad) music video, as well as misguidedzombie, who says, “Tom Hanks was robbed of the Oscar for this.” TheAllRightGatsby, on the other hand, says it’s “great but a little overproduced and as much as I like the chorus it IS repetitive,” and KometBlu says, “This is cute I guess. I just wish they weren't all 'ok let's rehash the last lead and call it a day'. A Problem->Focus tea.” JoeThaMo gives it a backhanded compliment, saying, “I've heard this song on the radio before I listened to Emotion and almost didn't give Carly a chance because it's basically Call Me Maybe 2.0. It works much better in conjunction with the rest of the album, but it's still my least favorite track.” Finally, jimmy345960 echoes a lot of people’s comments in the last thread: “I don't really like you.”

“Queen of remembering being naked.” - BreezySeason

Don't get me wrong, it's a bop and I love the chorus, but wtf? 14? Although it does have the 2nd best opening line (1st place goes to Warm Blood, ofc). 

Buzzfeed aficionado eklxtreme “loves the lyrics and references,” and NapsAndNetflix, slapping it with a 10, says, “I feel this will score unfortunately low so a pre-emptive fuck y'all.” Oh honey, if only. MrSwearword asks, “Were these hallucinations those of success?” while angusaditus labels it a “bop.” TheAllRightGatsby says, “I went into this thinking I was gonna give it something less than a 10 but then the drums came in and I went weak in the knees and I was helpless.” I don’t think that’s healthy. KometBlu, somehow deeming this the worst song out of all three albums, drags iT: “Everyone who worked on this atrocity needs to be banned from making music for at least 10 years. This is not an exaggeration; I still have PTSD-induced nightmares from this track.”

Lowest scores (1 x1): NapsAndNetflix

Really really boring. Worse than Focus imo.

kickit drags a bit, asking, “What is she saying tho,” and breadvelvet joins in: “You named the album after this? Also wtf is that vocoder towards the end this is baffling in all the wrong ways. It’s an okay song.” eklxtreme digs it, saying, “badass, vocals on point, instrumentation lowers at the right time to highlight vocals, hihats are subtle and gr8,” and ffourthofjuly somehow has a stranger description, saying that “this song makes me wanna like….join a cult idk how else to explain it it’s a nice song.” Established h8r NapsAndNetflix says, “I sort of liked this song originally but it progressively has turned worse and worse the more I hear it. If this survey was months ago this would be higher.” MrSwearword actually likes a song for once, saying, “LOVE this song; video could’ve been better but song wise AMAZING.” Altiondsols sums up a lot of forum homosexuals’ feelings on this song, saying, “This song makes me feel like a dangerous woman and i'm a dude.”

“Queen of requesting love.” - BreezySeason

This was top 10 until like, the last day. I'm sad it dropped out.

KometBlu seems frustrated: “Ok @ chorus being that lazy and tragic that it deletes everything good in the rest of the song.” Um, the chorus is the best part though. ffourthofjuly says she “loves the synths here, and how un-ballad it feels even though it is, in fact, a ballad type song. very minimalist.” MrSwearword, on the other hand, says it’s “so clunky and redundant I’m surprised Taylor didn’t sing this,” and Altiondsols says it “ has amazing bridges but the chorus is a flop. Why does the synth just go on vacation? Could have easily been a 10.” eklxtreme has other issues, saying, “The chorus falls flat and feels empty, I can appreciate the instrumentation and harmonies though.”

breadvelvet returns for another great writeup:
>The production massively outshines the songwriting on this track to be perfectly honest. I gauge the quality of songwriting on whether or not I think I’d enjoy an acoustic cover of it, and I think any acoustic cover of this song would be pretty bad so

>i mean the production’s nice and minimalist, and takes risks, which is always appreciated in pop music. Less is more generally even though there’s not much to this track at all

“Queen of changing for you.” - BreezySeason

Oops. Yeah I dragged this; it just doesn’t do anything for me. Although I love the passion in her voice in the prechorus. 

TheAllRightGatsby defends his choice of 11: “Since I heard this last December it's become one of my favorite songs ever and I had to give it my 11, there were other candidates but it had to be this.” ffourthofjuly goes awf, saying, “THIS SONG IS A REAL FUCKING BOP AND LITERALLY ONE OF MY FAVORITE SONGS OF ALL TIME the speaking parts between the lines of the prechorus makes me die a lil i love it.” Angusaditus says, “Once again: I really like sad/dark Carly.” I can hear sad, but dark?  

TeamAwesome4 ponders the lyrics: "Self awareness is always good. Also, the chorus is one long sentence, and I usually don't like that (Bieber's ‘Love Yourself’ comes to mind), but here, I'm good with it.” MrSwearword can’t tell that the album’s over and simply says, “I swear I hated this repetitive song like 3 tracks ago or something.” kickit labels it a “very strong finish” when Warm Blood obviously should have been the closer, and misguidedzombie gives BreezySeason a run for his money, calling Carly “queen of basslines.”

8. Boy Problems

10. Making the Most of the Night

Songs of those still in that don't deserve to be top 10: MTMOTN, Emotion, Boy Problems, Style. Style is fine and all, but Taylor has better songs. The Carly songs are average for her standard, and might deserve top 20, but not top 10.

Songs I'd replace those with: New Romantics, Be Alright, Clean, Favourite Color. Favourite Color had no shot, but I like it that much. The others genuinely should be in there.

deleted: So if I were to do my own version of this, would people want to see **Pure Heroine vs. Teenage Dream vs. The Fame Monster** (all the deluxe/extended versions)? I feel like they are some of the most liked pop albums of the 2010s on this sub. The only problem is that PH is 16 songs, TD is 18 (not counting the megamix at the end), and TFM is 22 so it might be a little unfair.

“Queen of taking the long way home.” - BreezySeason

Sort of like Run Away With Me’s chippier younger sister, but it takes away that thing that makes Run Away With Me so good: that feeling of this dark, mysterious world expanding endlessly around you, as well as the security Carly brings you by sounding like she’s by your side every step of the way. This just sounds like a cute song you’d listen to for a drive through the city. It doesn’t have the gravitas for me, I guess.

“If I didn't give my 11 to When I Needed You it might have gone to this one purely for encapsulating everything about the kind of hopeless romanticism and almost naive optimism and excitement that Carly and I have in common,” says TheAllRightGatsby, making me feel like a bit of a jerk. KometBlu says, “Loving the chill 80's teas and the sax accents in this. Always heard some Whitney Houston influences all over the track. Really love it. Except of that synth at the start which sounds like a child lullaby, delete it.” Agreed, the beginning is kinda the worst part.

breadvelvet also has a long blurb, saying, “hey, ‘Your Type’, this is how you handle the four chord structure, with sparkly production, a bouncy bass line, a prominent saxophone part, and a chorus that just begs to be sung out with a crowd. Other than those components, it’s pretty average tho lmao.” Watch out, snidelaughter has the banhammer ready. TeamAwesome4 calls it “Literally the cutest song in the world,” as if cuter songs didn’t exist on the same album. eklxtreme says the “melody doesn’t do much,” and MisterrAlex comes through with the pathos: “This song is absolutely amazing, can you just picture yourself driving down a highway with Carly singing this in your ear? Just picture that and you can see how glorious this song is.” And of course, MrSwearword throws some shade, saying, “A game of ‘let’s get lost’? you first, Carly…”

"Queen of knowing you had a rough time." - BreezySeason

Did anyone think this would get top 10? I was surprised when I calculated the top 10 about halfway through the scores and saw this somehow snuck its way in. It’s the best kind of surprise though, since this song is a bit amazing. I love how when the chorus strikes, Carly truly sounds she’s hijacking not only you, but the song as well. Also, this was the first proof we as humanity received that someone could sing a Sia song and not sound like Sia. Bless Carly and her limited vocal chords.

MihaMijat says they “loooove it,” and KometBlu says there’s “so much sugar in this basically bubblegum pop anthem, it makes you teeth hurt. and you're loving every second of it. woo lorD @ that godly chorus.” ffourthofjuly also loves it, proclaiming herself as “probably the number one stan of this song specifically, it just gives off the best vibes and makes me feel like im moving which is an amazing feeling and i just really love this song, i can’t find a flaw which is why this song gets the 10, but there’s a song that i feel deserves it better…” eklxtreme loves “the quiet intro an outro sets a good dynamic when the chorus sneaks up and hijacks me,” and MrSwearword calls it “confident; terrible but she is the confident type.” Once again, I’ll take it as a compliment. 

breadvelvet is a bit of a curmudgeon, though:
>this and “Black Heart” are probably the only two tracks which I have an issue with production-wise. I know the general vibe of the album is like a throwback type deal, but the song itself with the low-mileage chord structure and somewhat cheesy instrumentation with the acoustic guitars and drum flourish things reminds me painfully of early 2000s Max Martin stuff. Not a good thing honestly

\#JusticeForBlackHeart tbh.

“Queen of not knowing what to do.” - BreezySeason

Fucking bye. Yes, it’s kinda cool to hear a song about boy problems that’s more focused on the relationship the girl has with her friends, but this song just doesn’t do it for me. Something just seems off about Carly’s voice, and she keeps on rhyming “problems” with “problems.” I will admit that “I think I broke up with my boyfriend today and I don’t really care” is kinda the best line of all time though.

MrSwearword makes a comment I feel bad for agreeing with, saying, “more like mic problems…seriously her vocals are too nasal and bad here.” Altiondsols, fighting back the tears of heartbreaker boys past, toughs it out and simply types, “It's a cute song.” KometBlu comes for /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah’s fave, saying, “Boi problemzz;)) Whoz got 'emm I g0t them 2 XDd. god this is such a Katy Perry track. (<- That was not a compliment).” I screamed tbh. eklxtreme just says it’s “funky af and makes me wanna dance, great melody,” and TheAllRightGatsby says, “I don't think I need to say anything more than what a bop.” Our favorite poptimist breadvelvet proves that sometimes you need to say something more than what a bop, saying, “the density of catchy melodic ideas in this song is insane, I think there’s like three melodic phrases just in the chorus that would make decent hooks on their own and yet they’re all there together and it just works spectacularly. If there’s a flaw to this track, however, it’s that her ‘girl next door’ personality type is a bit too strong here in the lyrics.”

And finally, ffourthofjuly shares her conspiracy theory with the class:
>okay first of all, this song is gay. let me just say that first, carly is canon bisexual because this song has the most gay female connotations outside of hayley kiyoko and tegan and sara songs. next. this song is so eternally catchy, like the melody of this song is going to be ingrained in my head for the rest of time, and it just has a certain aesthetic that i love listening to

I can’t be the only one who thought Tegan and Sara were dating, right?

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Adding some of my comments about this song.

I rated this song a 10 because I relate to this song very much. I am the annoyed friend that Carly calls about her "boy problems". Basically, I am Sia at the beginning of the song when she said "Listen, just leave or stay... but I'm done listening to it"

deleted: surprised so much people on this sub hate this song, it's one of my favorites on the album! fine with it going here, though. (also, it doesn't rhyme "problems" with "problems" anywhere on the song?? i'm assuming you mean that it repeats the line "so tired of hearing of all your boy problems" in the middle and end of each verse, but that's not rhyming, that's a refrain. and i know this seems like splitting hairs, but imo trying to rhyme something by repeating the last word is INFINITELY more obnoxious than a refrain is, haha)

I’ve probably overused this term at this point, but this song is pretty genius: it’s both a dismissive acknowledgement and a parody of how Taylor and her relationship habits are portrayed, and the songwriting is so fucking GREAT. “I’m dying to see how this one ends,” with the dark connotation of “dying” is such a great way to show what kind of character she’s putting on. The production is also top notch, especially with how those heavy drums come in on the second verse, signifying the rocky state of their relationship. And of course, the ending, how everything gets wiped away, ready for the next victim to arrive. WHY ISN’T THIS TOP 5? I BLAME KIM KARDASHIAN. 

JoeThaMo feels bad for stanning: “As much as I dislike Taylor, this song is just all around great imo.” kickit has no qualms, however, saying, “The last time a song was this loaded with immaculate hooks was bad romance.” misguidedzombie acknowledges the song’s success, saying it’s “gonna be on every ‘iconic hits from the 10s’ playlist in 20 years,” while MrSwearword has “a long list of ex-lovers/reasons I hate this song.” TheAllRightGatsby keeps hitting replay, saying, “This is just such a great song, damn, every time I listen to it I like it more,” and fellow 11-giver jimmy345960 just proclaims, “GOAT.” Even Altiondsols praises it, saying it “has some amazing lyrics, but it sounds boring as fuck. I heavily prefer the I Prevail cover.” Good enough for me!

breadvelvet spills the fucking tea:
>This would have been a much more attention-grabbing, effective intro to the album imo, a starkly-produced, glittery whirlwind. The chorus melody in particular is absolutely brilliant, invoking the call-and-response trope to near perfection. The call, “so it’s gonna be forever”, has a rising melody, and the response, “or it’s gonna go down in flames”, has a falling melody, but what sets this pattern apart is that this falling melody invokes the leading tone to the tonic, resulting in an impossibly satisfying melodic passage. The rise and fall of the melody even mirrors the lyrical content and its contrasts quite well! My biggest concern with this track, however, are that a major chunk of the verses relies on one repeated note once again. perhaps this was a cheeky jab at the somewhat lazy melody of the previous track? I hate it tho lol

Honestly, there’s so many little intricacies of this song that add up to something really amazing and wonderful. It’s definitely a defining moment in not only Taylor’s career, but also her growth as an artist.

“Queen of making time for yoooooouuuu.” - BreezySeason

Your Preference (It’s Not Racism) barely misses the top 5. I dig the song, but while half of the time it makes me want to cry, the other half of the time I don’t feel anything. I’m not sure why this discrepancy exists, but I wish it weren’t there. I’m surprised this didn’t get more 10s. 

“Pop perfection,” says MihaMijat. KometBlu deems it “a cute bop. The pulsating bass is very reminiscent of DWUW, and particularly Style.” breadvelvet is less impressed, saying, “Tons of people seem to love this song and it means a lot to them at all, but the lyrics are generic as hell and those four chords ack they just prevent the song from resonating with me the way that ‘All That’ does.” Yes, #JusticeForAllThat. eklxtreme says, “Goat melody, lyrics too, the chorus killed me,” while MrSwearword seems to be rating the video once again: “that radio DJ should be a vocal sensation; then Carly kicks in…” angusaditus says, “I love dark/sad Carly.” Yeah, I can see that this is dark/sad. TheAllRightGatsby brings up the best part of the song, saying, “Gets a 10 for the ‘But I still love you... To the spot that we met’ section alone; everything else is just icing on the cake.” 

ffourthofjuly defends her 11:
>is there any other option. should i even elaborate here. theres the pulsating synths, theres the whole instrumentation, her vocals fit perfectly here, and the lyrics are truly on some extra special plane, this song has made me cry on more than one occasion and im not proud of that

SriX23: Can we do one of these Rate competitions with less popular albums? I think it'd be cool to see people try something new and see what makes the best impressions. I'd suggest:

Lights - Siberia


I was gonna suggest Pure Heroine instead of Lights but PH is probably a lot more popular than the other two so it might not be fair.

deleted: that's a really cool idea, actually!! i think that this type of format works a lot better with lesser known albums, because as fun as this has been, the results have also mostly been fairly predictable (generally, at least) because we already know how most of the sub feels about these songs (i mean, is ANYONE surprised by style, RAWM, and into you making it this far?). trying this again with albums that are way less discussed could help make it a lot harder to know how people feel about the albums ahead of time.

Lowkey one of the most influential tracks of the last few years, 1989’s first single to not hit #1 is now eliminated, marking the departure of Taylor from the rate. At least she made the top 5, right? This honestly could have gone further, but with the obvious bias against her, I’m satisfied she managed to worm her way this far.

“Pop perfection,” says misguidedzombie. ffourthofjuly isn’t even ashamed of her bias, saying, “This is her best song, and one of the best pop songs in recent years, deducted a point for it being taylor smh.” Watch out, the 3 remaining Swifties that are following this rate are coming for you. eklxtreme says the “guitar in the back is nice,” and I agree. It is very nice indeed. 
kickit calls it “the best and slyest pop song about sex in I don't know how many years.” The undertones about sex are definitely there! MrSwearword says it’s “among the 6 to 9 T.S. songs I actually like,” and andgusaditus says it has a “weak chorus” but is “otherwise great.” TheAllRightGatsby says, “I didn't realize how much I liked this song until this listen through,” which is pretty much what he said for How You Get the Girl and This Love, so I’m not sure it’s a compliment. jimmy345960, forever the poet, simply adds, “Fucking Harry.” BreezySeason is also minimalist, saying, “More style points if she owned a pair of yeezys.” 

breadvelvet has some things to say:
>The production shines much brighter than the actual song here lmao. mainly because ONCE AGAIN she decides to write a song with repeated notes. “JAMES. DEAN. DAY. DREAM.” it’s a bit odd to have your hook be the least memorable part of the song melodically, and the semi-spoken word transition from verses to chorus can be a bit awkward, but a greater portion of the song is verses as opposed to choruses, so it ends up being a net positive so

>(also the little guitar licks in the second verse are a brilliant touch‼)

Altiondsols also wishes to inform us of his “personal crusade:”
>Would have been a 7 or 8 if she hadn't name-dropped James Dean. I hated it on Blue Jeans, I hated it on Allure, I hated it on Love Without Tragedy, Barlights, Hooray - For Hollywood, Superstar, Jack & Diane, Speechless, New Americana, Moonlight... just stop. It's not cool. Find a new icon. This is my personal crusade

"The undertones about sex are definitely there"? No I disagree completely, what u think is that "red lip classic thing that u like" or Taylor's "good girl thing in a tight little skirt"? She includes three sex metaphors in the second line "burning flames, paradise, and yes, the long drive" and the very fact that you don't recognize them as such is merely proof that Taylor Swift wrote the slyest sex jam of all time and got away with it

“Queen of songs named after the album.” - BreezySeason (But what if it’s the other way around?)

I always suspected this would do well, but I’m shocked this non-single beat out every other song besides RAWM. It is fantastic though, and a wonderful introduction to both the album and who Carly is as an artist: playful, witty, and a little sexy. It’s easily among the contenders for best song lyrically in this rate.

breadvelvet calls it an “excellent transition feel between the first two tracks, and an excellent title track as far as they normally go. The first time I listened to the album, this was the point where I first broke into a smile, and definitely not the last. This album’s such a joy to listen to lol.” KometBlu disagrees, however, saying, “For a title track and a second song on the album, this is weak af.” MrSwearword has their back, saying, “It’s awful but at least she sounded like she had hope in her career.” ffourthofjuly gives it a middling score and says, “this is still a real bop its just that there’s other bops on this album lol,” while angusaditus calls it the “GOAT bop.” eklxtreme says it has an “indie pop vibe,” as if Carly isn’t an indie artist at this point.

GREEEDAAAAYYY WHOOOOOO! The moment it hits you is the moment you realize you’ve arrived at Bop Central. Side to Side could go to #1 for 20 weeks and I’d still be convinced they should’ve made this the single instead.

“got damn i love this song, what a bop also: K E Y C H A N G E,” says ffourthofjuly. TheAllRightGatsby notes the same, saying, “One of the best pop melodies of the year + funky acapella breakdown + key change = instant 10; this also really makes me want an Ari/Mark Ronson collab.” jimmy345960 also just says, “Key Change!!!” breadvelvet says it’s a “guilty pleasure. a throwback vibe (disco strings, horn section, nile rodgers-esque guitar work, bombastic key change towards the end) which actually works? count me the heck in lol.” eklxtreme says, “right off the bat jumps at you and gets you hooked, melody is amazingly catchy, trumpets are gr8, synths are interesting, not impressive but it's good.” MrSwearword calls it “high tempo fun from Ariana and I approve,” and BreezySeason calls it the “Eurovision sounding GOAT.” TeamAweseom4 perhaps puts it best, saying, “Love the gospel-esque yells on the chorus, this better be a goddamn single.” angusaditus isn’t so sure, saying, “I like it a lot. It’s a bit hyped tho.” 

KometBlu is stanning:
>L-U-V-ing the throwback sound, this really is an amazing track. Sometimes it can sound a bit too extra for me to listen, and it's obvious they didn't rerecord backing vocals for the modulation but only pitched them up, so it sounds a bit squeaky; but otherwise this is one of my faves.

As is Altiondsols:
>From the "bum bum bum, baa da dum bum bum" vocals near the end, to the key change, to the "i'm so!", my constant reaction to every single moment of this song is "OH NO. That bitch did NOT. so PETTY" even though that doesn't make any sense, it's just a song. No one is getting dragged, unless you count all of your shit faves getting dragged to the curb like the trash they are

“Queen of saxophones.” - BreezySeason

Wow I’m so surprised this won. Really, I can’t express how shocked I am. (Forreal though, fantastic song and a fitting winner for such an...interesting rate. If any song has the right to claim the title as the winner of r/popheads’ first rate, it’s this.)

mother_rucker gives it their 11, saying it’s “the obvious choice but the only real choice.” KometBlu says, “That sax line works amazing as an intro to the album. They really fucked up by not making this the first single, a Till The World Ends tea.” At least that went top 10 hihi. breadvelvet has a confession to make: “the blaring saxophone actually turned me off the first time I heard it (something about the timbre feels off and a bit unnatural), but I grew to love it somehow. I think it’s definitely a ballsy intro track to the album and rousing, though I do wish the chorus melody moved around a bit more.”

elxtreme just says “YES” and slaps down another 11. MrSwearword, on the other side of things, is shaking and crying once more: “THE MEMES IT CAUSED…THE MEMES…” angusaditus says he “loves it, but not that much,” and kickit gives y’all a lecture: “I don't see this song as the standout track /r/popheads wants it to be. I think anyone who wants to compare this to Teenage Dream or Blank Space or whatever is delusional and trying to pull an immaculate song off this great pop album and focusing on the wrong song anyway. I like this song, but I think it's sorely overrated.”

Regardless, TheAllRightGatsby calls it “the bop of a generation,” and jimmy345960 calls it “bae.” (???) Altiondsols throws a bit of shade, saying it’s “the only powerful opening track on any of these three albums.” Leave Moonlight out of this! JoeThaMo says, “Almost got my 11 but, just like with Bad Blood, it's gonna get enough attention from popheads even without my vote.” Well, you could say that again. 

#2 - Into You
Average: 9.002
Controversy score: 1.659

Highest scores (11 x7): DK111, kenzzeei, Nerdy\_boy\_chris, jonathanedge\_, MihaMijat, misguidedzombie, MrSwearword (10 x33): mother\_rucker, JoshuaReddit, lexfirth, 7mad, franch, supremeshieldon, Mudkip1, batmanji, mindnoises, BionicFunhouse, skiddos, TheAllRightGatsby, potrap, Theronkinrolla, Altiondsols, Zugtris, raicicle, FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, CandlePrince, sergeantthunderfist, JoeThaMo, melisanyans, BrownIRL2, letsallpoo, Glitter\_Butterfly, Listeningtosufjan, cfunkhouser, fifthchevron, MisterrAlex, ricehero1, hellomochi, breadvelvet, KometBlu

Kaphox and MrSwearword sent in their scores the same day, and for the next week or so this song was in first. Slowly but surely, however, the orders switched around again. An obvious second place is obvious, but this song is damn good as well. As my favorite music reviewer Katherine St. Asaph put it:

>Overproduction kills; the verse is continually interrupted by someone making lewd sounds with a Speak and Spell, and the chorus is crowded where it should be throbbing. But elsewhere, there’s atmosphere, and it’s deadly palpable.

MihaMijat puts it perfectly: “Song of the year.” misguidedzombie is pretty accurate as well, calling it “literally flawless.” MrSwearword, who was so close to sabotaging this entire rate, says, “THIS SONG IS PERFECTION AND NEEDS TO BE A #1 HIT.” ffourthofjuly wishes this was on Emotion I guess, since she says, “alright this is a real bop #justiceforintoyou ariana grande doesn’t deserve to have songs this good i love it a lot.” angusaditus says it has “killer production” and is “such a great song.” Altiondsols just says, “Yeah it's perfect, we all know already.” I feel like I’ve typed a variation on that sentiment like 5 times already. Meanwhile, Nerdy_boy_chris gives the most cryptic response, saying, “Mac Miller remix is 10/10.” There’s a Mac Miller remix? Oh yeah, and jimmy345960 labels it a “BOP.” The all-caps is important. 

NapsAndNetflix admits that “unlike every other Ari song in existence, this song has grown on me the more I listen to it.” eklxtreme staggers to his computer, keeling over from the sheer force of the song, and types this: “into this, Banger, killed me.” TheAllRightGatsby is a bit wishy-washy, but says, “This song was a 10 when it came out, then its charm wore off for a while and it dropped to like an 8.5, and now it's come back around again to a 10, definition of a bop.” JoeThaMo just falls to his knees and lifts his arms towards the sky, yelling, “LIGHT ME UP ARI.” 

And one final time, here’s breadvelvet:
>wtf why didn’t she start the album off with this. why wasnt the album just 18 copies of this song. it's so good wtf this is legitimately one of my favorite songs of the year, i'd been starting to notice that sometimes her vocal delivery in the songs so far didn't really match the vibe of the instrumental too well, but this is perfect in that aspect, and the production is glorious, and the section from 3:02-3:24 where they rein everything back and give her vocals the spotlight actually gives me goosebumps
