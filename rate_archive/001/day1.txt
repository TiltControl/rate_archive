1989 vs. Emotion vs. Dangerous Woman: Day 1, aka the actual Taylor Swift roast
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/50uoxj/1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman_day_1_aka_the/

Hello everyone! I'm excited to get this started. Some general notes:

* I'm revealing 25 songs today.
* The controversy scores that come after the averages are a measure of how divisive the voting was. The average for that is a 2, and anything higher than a 2.2 should be considered controversial.
* Apologies in advance if I fucked up some scores or forgot to include your comments. I promise I did my best!


That's it. At 12pm PST we'll get things really rolling. And once I figure out how to sort this by new...

**The thread is now sorted by new. Scroll all the way to the bottom if you want to avoid spoilers!**

Surprising absolutely nobody (seriously, did anyone not see this coming?), this turd of a song is in last place, and it’s the only one to not receive a single 10. In all honesty, the song, on its own, isn’t that terrible. Ignoring the bad writing, the bad enunciation (“you made a really deep cuuuu-uuuuuu-uuut”) and rap verses from Kendrick that would make G-Eazy cringe, the beat’s pretty good and the bridge is great. But when you take into account the ridiculously petty context of the song, the context that Taylor herself is responsible of associating with the song, this song’s placing is warranted.

“No words,” says breadvelvet, while eklxtreme says that “the beat is just disgusting.” 8485blue says, “I actually thoght this was kind of a fun song until the music video ruined it for me,” while Angusaditus simply ponders, “How was this a hit?” Nerdy_boy_chris answers him, however: “Kendrick Version gets 3/10.” MrSwearword concurs: “Strictly album cut? 5.1 because it is TRASH.” Drama fiend TeamAwesome4 says it deserves a 6 for “Post-Snek irony” but still gives it a 0 for how it was “Pre-Snek reveal” while altiondisols does his best /r/the_donald impression, mashing out, “Duh duh duh DUUUUH da DUUUUUUH. Duh duh duh DUUUUH da DUUUUUUH. Duh duh duh DUUUUH da DUUUUUUH. Duh duh duh BAAA-AAD bloood HAAAY.” BreezySeason sums up what most of us think of when we hear this song, simply commenting, “snake.” MihaMijat, not to be outdone, simply comments, “Ew.”

Remember when this was a promo single? Somehow Taylor thought this would get people to buy the album. (I guess it worked though?) I never really liked this song, and it’s a very questionable opening track, but I will admit that I was SNATCHED when she opened the 1989 Tour with this. It sounds amazing in a stadium. Also, this peaked at #39 on the Hot 100, which is the same as “I Really Like You.” Poor Carly.

MrSwearword sheds a tear, worrying about “that poor charity who got the proceeds from this song.” Apparently it was to the NY Department of Education, for those wondering. angusaditus just calls it a “meh opening,” and Altiondsols agrees, deeming it “OK filler but a weak opening to the album.” TheAllRightGatsby is a bit more positive, saying, “I like the production to this song more than the 6.5 would suggest, although it's a little clean for my taste, but the lyrics are so so cheesy.” ffourthofjuly comes for the entire city, saying, “As someone who lives close enough to New York there is nothing special about it and it is unbelievably corny.”

breadvelvet then comes through with an essay:
>the bridge before the last chorus is really solid, but the song stays on one note for a surprisingly great deal. oddly taylor sounds like she’s somewhat holding back vocally on the “welcome to new york” anaphora? she sounds a bit restrained for some reason and it’s a rather off-putting, incongruous delivery for a song that, lyrically, unconditionally celebrates the imperfect humanity of its titular city for all that it is. lyrics are good and the bridge are good, but the rest of it doesn’t really function as a song for me, much less the intro to the supposed album of the year.

Calling straight-out repetition anaphora is a bit too kind, imo. But otherwise, very interesting analysis!

I like the song itself but not only I agree how weak of an opener that song is, the perspective of that song comes from someone who is very privileged to see the best of New York, and Taylor isn't able to experience the worst of the city because of her social and class standing.

calltehshots: I didn't have time to do this rating (and I forgot near the end sorry!) but I need to get into this song lol. I don't think I hate a song more than this one.

Sorry but I'm gonna completely gas up New York for a second to explain myself lol. This is gonna be corny but lemme get into it lol. I'm born and raised and I grew up in the East Village/LES for the majority of my life. I grew up knowing people of every race, every religion, every sexuality, every class, every crazy personality in the book. You'd go one block passing the extremes of most gorgeous upper class fashionable people to junkies strung out in the street. The things I learned from being raised here and the people I grew up with shape me into the person I am today and is probably one of the most formative things of my life.

For this bitch to come in and make the most watered down, white washed, insanely BORING song about New York I've ever heard and for her to actually become the ambassador for tourism of NY and seeing bus stops with quotes from this awful song actually broke me a little as a person. You can love or hate NY but for her to describe the experience so blandly like she's entering Disney World...I can't. Her New York experience is her buying overrated, overpriced cookies in the Upper West Side.

swbrontosaur: i like the Casio synths ( i don't know if they are but it sounds like some pre-set keyboard you get when are 7), and the "boys and boys and girls and girls" bit is a ton of fun with a good vocal production flourish.

Also, it reminds me of Spacemen 3's "Big City".

I...don’t even remember how this goes. -runs to iTunes- Oh yeah, this one. It’s kinda boring, kinda vanilla, kinda melodramatic, and just...kinda there. It’s the only bonus track off 1989 that truly feels like a bonus track, imo.

Barely anyone even had anything that cheeky to say. Altiondsols is confused and angry, however: “How did Taylor not get bored writing this? Isn't she supposed to be a good artist? This is shameful.” Our favorite curmudgeon MrSwearword can’t resist making a joke, saying “not with the SWIFTMAS theme song, I’m not.” Please, never remind me of that [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j3yyF31jbKo) again. eklxtreme goes for the jugular, saying, “These lyrics are middle school poetry.” What, and Carly’s aren’t?

breadvelvet is impressed, however:
>Production is amazing (wtf is that instrument at 1:20 I must know!), template repetition is not. Vibe in the lyrics is great, and her vocal delivery is calm and precise, but chord structure is generic af. Also as a side note, the point where she sang “you can hear it in the silence” and paused caught me off guard and actually knocked this song a solid point up lol

ffourthofjuly is...less impressed:
>[LOUD GROANING] for real though sorry jack antonoff is the love of my life but this song is so …. stupid and repetitive and way too het for me and also knowing its about lena dunham makes me throw up a little. just…way too corny and straight i can’t deal

Another 0 magnet of the rate gets kicked out. This was in the bottom 3 at one point, but those 10s swooped in about halfway through. Honestly, thank God they did. This song really isn’t that bad. Yes, it’s a ripoff of “Problem,” but the verses are solid, Ariana’s slightly easier to understand, and there are horns. Let’s just ignore Jamie Foxx, shall we?

“Fuh Fuh Fuhgettable,” raps(?) BreezySeason as altiondsols simply whimpers, “pls no.” MihaMijat says, “I like this song, but it still doesn't justify ripping off Problem” while potrap hits it with their only 0 and only comment: “It's a certified bop but doesn't deserve to be listed with the rest of these songs, which are all veritable pop classics.” NapsAndNetflix gives it another 0 and claims that “if garbage made noise it would be this song.” That’s unfair, Garbage has [much better songs than this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSa_hbutFt0). TeamAwesome4’s anger can’t be tamed once again: “Total mess. I hate the ‘I'm the center of attention’ anthem thing going on here. At least when Gaga did ‘Applause’, she did it in a way that didn't enable every self centered drama queen. This doesn't have any reason WHY we should focus on Ari, just telling us to do so. The chorus isn't there. There is no chorus.” I like to pretend the chorus isn’t there, too. Also, misguidedzombie gives it a 0 and an “A for effort.”

On the other side of the spectrum, TheAllRightGatsby can’t help but stan, saying “tbh the chorus is my second-favorite part of this song, right after the dope horns.” jimmy345960 disagrees, saying “the prechorus saved this shit.” Zugtris also says it would have been a “10 with a better chorus.” MrSwearword loves it all, claiming, “this song is EVERYTHING to me; even the bad music video,” and JoeThaMo joins in, yelling “TENOUTTATEN I DON'T CARE WHAT ANYONE SAYS” before coming to his senses and saying, “honestly tho 8/10, I just love the production.” Then he resends his scores after a month and gives it a 9. Make up your mind! Meanwhile, eklxtreme says it “gets me so hype, literally nothing wrong with this song, i die at the end. ffourthofjuly says it’s “pretty solid, though the male vocals in the chorus are really weird and odd and prevent this from an 8.”

breadvelvet comes to the song’s defense:
>idk why everyone hates this song so much lol in my opinion it's the utter bizarreness of the hook that makes it work. it's so ridiculous and counterintuitive that it cycles back around to being good again. i'd increase the tempo a bit though, it kinda drags once the chorus hits the third time lol

Meanwhile, KometBlu’s gay ass can’t stop quivering:
>The way club gets SHOOK everytime this gets played woo. And even when I'm listening to it at home: by the time the last chorus hits, my bussy is on the floor spelling 'SLE ME ARE' in Morse code literally every single time. Focus on meh !

Well, that’s an interesting image in my head.

I guess most of us were too gay for this one. It’s kinda cute, but it also sounds like a Kiss reject. I hope most of us can agree that Taylor is not someone who should be giving dating advice.

Our resident Kaylor shipper jimmy345960 discovers subtext that probably isn’t there, calling it “the most Bisexual song ever, a gay song about a str8 relationship.” TheAllrightGatsby has kind words, saying it’s “another song I didn't realize I liked so much until this listen through, the production and groove and melodies are so awesome.” Meanwhile, MrSwearword is shaking in a corner and yelling: “EXCUSE U TAYLOR, I’M A GAY MAN AND THIS SONG IS HOMOPHOBIC.” I guess I was right? altiondsols can’t ignore the context, saying to Taylor that “this would be a cute little filler song but you can't release bitchy trash like Bad Blood and then turn around and pretend that you're still Teardrops On My Guitar Taylor all over again.”

ffourthofjuly calls it “the most forgettable song on the album,” and MihaMijat says it’s “G E N E R I C.” Is that from the new Fergie song? Our favorite essayist breadvelvet says it “feels like a throwback to her early work in a way with those sonic textures (as well as the charming naiveté of her simple romantic lyricism), mashed up with her new subtle electronic touches. But...repetition….” I personally just think the writing is lazy.

swbrontosaur: This is one of those songs that I felt was improved by Ryan Adams' version.  Just flipping the gender of the person singing it really helps it out and, makes it sound like a playbook for a psychopath.

Also, fuck the line "with pictures in frames of kisses on cheeks".  Every Taylor album has some repeated motifs that she uses in multiple songs, but a cheek kiss has to be the worst one yet.

That ain't what the songs about tho IMO. She never says how to get the girl to stay (or what happens next). It's idealising the aftermath of a breakup. Like I just imagine her opening the door and nobody is there, so she writes a song about what she'd like to happen.

C’mon y’all, this is a harmless bop. Check out that controversy score, though, which is the highest of this rate: people certainly had strong opinions on this one. I admit I didn’t like this when it came out, and I’ll admit that this placing isn’t entirely undeserved, but it’s still a serviceable fuck-the-haters anthem that’s entirely listenable and super danceable. 

Unsurprisingly, a lot of people had something to say. “I've absolutely detested this song ever since it came out, and the fact that it was so overplayed doesn't exactly help either,” says JoeTheMo. NapsAndNetflix crowns it “Taylor’s GOAT” while MrSwearword calls it the “best song from this clunky and uneven album AND A BOP.” angusaditus disagrees, saying, “I kinda like that it’s autobiographical but the song is a NO.” I agree, it does sound like a Meghan song. hellomochi confesses a secret after slapping it with their 0: “When I transferred this album to my iPod shuffle, I actually left this out.” Whoa there, calm down before you end up on /r/madlads. jimmy345960 gives it a 7.4 and highlights the worst part of the song, saying simply, “This. Sick. Beat,” while altiondsols gives it their only 0 and lists the whole bridge: “This sick beat my ex man told his new girlfriend she's like oh my god but i'm just gonna shake and to the man over there with the hella good hair.” As someone who grew up in Norcal, I live for the “hella” tbh. Nerdy_boy_chris apparently does, too, giving the song a 9.9 and saying “that rap is glorious.”

MihaMijat gives it a 7 but still says that “this got old soon.” misguidedzombie says that the  “wind instruments save this song,” and mother_rucket says that “this may get a higher score if only she didn't have that weird-ass spoken word part.” Agreed! ffourthofjuly says it’s “literally awful and then you have the MY EX MAN part, but it’s catchy and thats the only reason it doesn’t have a 1.” Once again, her use of “hella” >>>>>.

breadvelvet tentatively defends the song:
>I’ll be honest, this is/was a guilty pleasure of mine. Production is a nice change of pace, mixing sounds super clean, and the repetitive notes are relegated to a horn rather than her voice thankfully. Yes, some parts are cringey, there’s no denying that, but it’s legitimately entertaining hearing how her vocal melody skillfully weaves through the framework of this. sick. beat. and of course, the message of the song is so carefree that I don’t feel obligated at all to scrutinize the lyrics that heavily.

Then, TeamAwesome4 goes the fuck in:
>The lyrics make me want to cry, and the talk-rap is awful. The best part about this song is that I can turn off my brain and not care about it. Except for the talk-rap, which recently took a dip for me. She was just found out to be the "liars and dirty, dirty cheats of the world". Also she rips on this girl for being like, "Oh my god", when she uses that phrase earlier in this album in "Blank Space". Total lack of self awareness. Also, how does this fit on the album whatsoever? This is full of love songs, then a generic "Fuck the haters" thing?

BreezySeason shares a similar sentiment, but seems to understand the power of brevity:

Out of the Taylor songs killed so far, this is the one that I thought would go farther. It’s a solid pop song, kinda sounding like HAIM if they weren’t quite as good. I also appreciate the crazy nature of the song’s ending, kinda going all over the place.

hellomochi spills some tea: “I love the bridge. This is such an underrated song.” angusaditas only deigns to call it “cute” and Altiondsols says that “the title sounds extremely aggressive, like ‘OOH I WISH YOU WOULD BITCH.’ Unfortunately the song itself does not.” I don’t know what you mean, the song I’ve linked sounds plenty aggressive. Listeningtosufjan, drool dripping from his mouth, simply says, “1989 really falls off in the back half.” ffourthofjuly agrees, saying this “sort of bridges the gap-of-awfulness between welcome to new york and shake it off,” and eklxtreme just calls it a “random slow song.” I feel that way to a lot of songs on this album, but this one? Nah.

breadvelvet comes through with an excellent writeup:
>say what you want about her formative pop country years but back then she showcased a natural knack for good melody writing (see the prechorus to “You Belong With Me”, pretty much the entirety of “Mean”, the underappreciated gem that is “Safe & Sound”, etc), and it feels like she’s squandering it for wholly monotonous, fairly low-effort melodies. Artists should follow a natural progression of improvement but it honestly feels like Taylor Swift is moving backwards with this release. /rant  but aside from that, there are some positive aspects to this song. Her irregular cadence for “right here/right now” in the chorus helps to create an actual interesting part in the chorus melody (which is basically just a p5 interval for its majority), and I suppose her lyrics capture an atmosphere of longing effectively. There seems to be a lyrical motif of late night driving in this album between this song and “Style” at least, a bit of a shame it doesn’t seem to lead anywhere but it’s definitely an interesting motif to have.

Really boring. I can’t really think of anything to say, besides the strange fact that this got no 1s. But that’s why I have you guys!

“I’m going to fucking fall asleep,” says Altiondsols, and TeamAwesom4 says, “This love is good, this love is bad, this writing is lazy.” MrSwearword steals my joke and says, “Credit for the Maroon 5 swagger-jacking song title I guess” and Nerdy_boy_chris also refers to another artist: “Would be 0/10 if Kendrick’s version was on the album.” Drag him, I guess? TheAllRightGatsby is the only one with kind things to say, calling it “another song I didn't realize I liked so much until this listen through, I previously thought it was cheesy but it clicked for me this time.” I mean, it is cheesy, no matter how many times you play it.

mother_rucker says some foolishness: "Back to December is her only good ballad tbh.” Um, All Too Well tho? eklxtreme says that the “synths are almost nice but they lead to nothing,” while breadvelvet is STANNING:
>maybe it’s personal taste, bc I’ve heard next to nothing about this song discussion-wise, but I feel like the first half of this song is top-tier Taylor, honestly. Maybe the drums are cheesy and the synth work leans towards a new age-y style, but if any year in history was cheesy and new age-y, it was 1989. That being said, this is one of the more successful songs she made in her mission to capture what 1989 really meant. This would be rated much higher if it wasn’t for the chorus though, it’s really unfortunate. I’m starting to think Taylor Swift isn’t for me haha pls don’t picture me like Oscar the Grouch over here, I’m genuinely having fun!

It’s fine to not like Taylor! Based on the eliminations so far, you’d be in good company...

This would be a great song to hear at a Broadway show, but it doesn’t really fit on the album. That, combined with the fact that it’s a relatively unknown bonus track, and that it’s kinda boring, meant it was doomed to flop in this rate. Oh well.

MihaMijat calls it a “sleeper hit” (because it puts me to sleep?) while NapsAndNetflix says it “sounds like it belongs in a Disney Channel original movie in a bad way. What's that Corbin Bleu jump rope movie? This is basically the theme of that.” breadvelvet also brings up Disney Channel, saying it “reminds me of ‘High School Musical’ weirdly. hook is rather weak but the buildup to it is massive <3.”  MrSwearword also says it “feels out of place on an Ariana album,” and Altiondsols says that “the synth could have been better, but that might just be the Youtube sound quality.”

KometBlu is stanning a biT: “Love the production and the brass instruments in this, it compliments her voice really well. The song needed a way stronger chorus, so I can see why it wasn't on standard edition.” ffourthofjuly also loves it: “once i heard those horns in the beginning i knew we were bout to be blessed, i was not disappointed.” eklxtreme brings them down to Earth though, saying what most are probably thinking: “it’s aight but i can’t see myself revisiting this.”

I could probably copy and paste what I said about Step On Up, since all of it applies. I love the snaps though, as well as how she references her ICONIQUE ponytail.

Lexfirth is confused. “Literally what the fuck are these last two,” he says, referring to the last two bonus tracks. “Like where was she hiding these what.” They come from this mystical land called Target, FYI. TheAllRightGatsby says, “I hadn't heard this song before today but goddamn this coulda been on the album, jazzy af and dope af.” MrSwearword gives a backhanded insult, asking, “what kind of Back to Basics impersonation? Not a bad thing, though weird to me.” NapsAndNetflix, who apparently didn’t watch the VMAs on Sunday, says that “girl’s got pipes,” while Altiondsols heaps on the praise: “The more acoustic sound (piano, guitars, violin maybe?) for this track compared to the rest of the album is a great touch, and Ari's voice sounds so good with it. This would have made a way better end to the album than Focus.” KometBlu is not quite so appreciative, however, saying that “the piano in the middle 8 is cute. Rest = trash.”

breadvelvet gets a bit carried away: “wtf is with this production omg record of the year material imo. it sort of drowns out ariana's vocals rather than making them shine through though, and her timbre is just too thin to carry the luxe? Idk.” It’s good, but not that good, imo. eklxtreme makes some good points, saying that “pop music needs more piano solos. i wish the vocals were stronger, love the old-timey vibe.”

The strings are pretty, and it gives me Yours Truly teas. It...doesn’t really feel like a full song, though. It just kinda drags on then abruptly ends. Really forgettable.

Comedic genius jimmy345960 fills in the blank, slapping it with a 0 and saying, “...about this song.” Altindsols and hellomochi both call it filler, but MrSwearword says it’s “sexy despite its near-dated sound.” JoeThaMo has kind-ish words, saying, “It's a good song, but I usually skip it because this is the only one that I need to be in a certain mood for.” eklxtreme says it has “great burlesque instrumentation but lyrics are lazyish.”

breadvelvet defends their 9:
>I'm honestly really really impressed by this song. It takes a ton of disparate elements and melds them together quite beautifully, and it's another song where her vocal delivery matches quite well. Loving the chord progression, the string intro, the melody, everything. only minor complaint is that the vocals stop at a weird spot and there's what sounds like an interlude to carry out the rest of the track for some reason lol.

“Queen of everything you ever wanted now happening.” - BreezySeason

You guys suck. Sure it sounds like a Kylie Minogue b-side but dammit it’s a BOP! When will the other Emotion bonus tracks? (Answer: NEVER.)

Kometblu just calls it “boring af” while Altiondsols lays on the blasphemy: “This song is trash. Did they steal the synth Hilary used on Metamorphosis? That album is honestly what this song reminds me of more than anything.” Um, Metamorphosis is better than every album in this rate. 8485live says it “sounds good live though,” while jimmy345960 just says he wanted to skip it. breadvelvet decides to taunt her: “is this literally just one chord for the entire song? Lol carly ur not animal collective stop.” Are we /r/indieheads now? eklxtreme further confuses me, saying, “Neon Indian? Sounds like an intro song, there's not much to this song.” Who are these bands though, and what do they have to do with Carly Rae Jepsen?

Was this a promo single? It got a video. I don’t really know. Also this song is really whatever and I still find Lil Wayne intolerable.

The peanut gallery couldn’t stop talking about Lil Wayne. TeamAwesome4 goes in: ‘MOOOLAAAAHHH BAYBAAAAAAAAAAY!’ Lil' Wayne needs to stick to things that make him funny. I don't like a human-lizard hybrid rapping about giving girls amnesia. One point alone for ‘And I don't normally say this but goddamn, you're the best, best, best’ and ‘And I ain't tryna rush you, but goddamn, I'm a mess, mess, mess.’” TheAllRight Gatsby also has a lot to say: “Just too damn dark and seductive and full of fantastic melodies and production to not be a first-rate bop; the layering of vocals is awesome and even Wayne's dorky verse works in its own way lmao.”

Meanwhile, MihaMijat just says, “Lil Wayne I still hate you,” and BreezySeason pulls an Xtina and goes, “MULAH BABAAAAYYYYYY.” MrSwearword says it “does nothing for [him]” and NapsAndNetflix just calls the chorus “annoying af.” breadvelvet is unimpressed as well: “my issue with this song is how utterly forgettable it is. this seems to be a common problem with songs with vocal chops as their hooks, and ariana is doing nothing to move the curve here sadly. Lil Wayne does nothing of note.” eklxtreme mirrors those thoughts, saying it “could do so much more, the chorus is like lazy, lyrics don't really make up for it.”

This was one of my favorites when 1989 first came out, but it’s grown a bit stale over time. It’s still a solid track, but the more I listen to it, the more cliche it all comes across to me.

The peanut gallery was pretty quiet on this one. TheAllrightGatsby, reading my mind, calls it “just incredible generic and forgettable.” MrSwearword also “forgot which song this was.” Zugris, meanwhile, asks, “can I give this an 11 too?” Only 1 per ballot, sorry! breadvelvet daydreams a bit: “this weirdly reminds me of a musical with the piano motif throughout and her cadence when she’s talking about Harry’s the guy’s green eyes. It’s weirdly catchy. idk how to articulate my thoughts on this track for some reason lol Taylor Swift has broken me guys.” eklxtreme kindly wakes him up, saying, “lyrics are dumb, what is this agressive part” and slapping it with a 2.

deleted: I guess I have to defend myself here. 

I can see why others don't like the song, but I think it's a really creative effort from Taylor that is easy to connect with. Oh, our relationship felt like it was going to be amazing forever, but life gets in the way and we realize that it was unrealistic from the beginning? Yeah, I think that's a pretty common sentiment and using "The Adventures of Alice in Wonderland" as a metaphor for that has made it my favorite song from 1989 and my favorite song of Taylor's. I get that is not some sort of seminal breakthrough of the artistic process, but it's sentimental, fun, and relatable. It'll never get consensus on that, unlike efforts like "Enchanted" or "All Too Well," but Wonderland was my stand-out track on 1989. The production is light and airy, the beat switch is phenomenal, the vocal effects are sharp, and the lyrics are some of her best.

This song is also out way too early. When will your fave sing about nutting quick? Bonus points for finally making a song with Future on it bearable. Also, Ariana says “shit” multiple times during the song. When will Miley, seriously?

“I’m a hoe,” whispers melisanyans as they give the song a 10. (This was their only comment and it made me scream.) angusaditas says that it “could be great but there’s something off. Still good tho,” and Mihamijat says that “this one keeps growing on me.” hellomochi says that “the chorus is so repetitive,” but TeamAwesome4 heaps on the praise: “Well Ariana has done the impossible. I finally like a track with Future on it. The buzzy synths make me feel like the production should be used on late 90's early 2000's video game. Seriously, put this in a Spyro game, and I wouldn't question it.” batmanji, disapproving, shakes his head and just says, “This song did NOT make me nut quick.”

KometBlu is lightly critical, saying it has “not much of a hook really” but still calling it ”an immensely welcome change of pace for the album.” ffourthofjuly incoherently praises it, saying, “This is a real jam i listen to it all the time, N U T Q U I C K, also future fits really well on here in some odd way.” eklxtreme, a simple man, just says, “future and trap beats hell yes, nothing more to it though.” What more do you need?

Sorry mods, I tried to make them see the light! This is another song that I loved when 1989 first came out, but I still really love it. Every time that weird high-pitched “STAY” pierces through the song I’m like, “Yas Taylor do it again!”

Pretty much nobody had anything to say. MrSwearword, our resident comedian, just says, “Well, I’m leaving. BYE.” Altiondsols says Taylor “does not have the range,” and BreezySeason makes another one of those jokes, saying “all you had to do was snake.” Eh, not your best. eklxtreme says that “the stay part is weird, not much substance here.” Um that’s the best part, mods pls ban.

Pitchfork’s 94th best song of 2014 leaves way too early! After “Shake It Off” and “Welcome to New York” were released ahead of 1989, this is the song that actually made me excited for what Taylor had to offer the world of pop. And I loved it: the racing chorus, the cryptic bridge (“when the sun came up, you were looking at me” is one of the best lines on the album), and those weird-ass Harry Styles references. It might have flopped, and the music video might kinda suck, but don’t be too critical - [Taylor suffered for her art!](http://www.mtv.com/news/2720210/taylor-swift-out-of-the-woods-music-video-behind-scenes/)

People could not get over the chorus. “AWHEEOUTTATHEWOODSAWHEEOUTTATHEWOODSAWHEEOUTTA,” screams JoeThaMo after slapping it with a 1. Altiondsols makes the same joke: “Are we out of the chorus yet, are we out of the chorus yet, are we out of the chorus yet, are we out of the chorus; are we done with this song yet, are we done with this song yet....” You get the idea.

TheAllRightGatsby calls it “mostly a mediocre song but lots of really annoying things, like that sample at the beginning and the super repetitive nature of the lyrics.” MihaMijat echoes him, saying it’s “good, but kinda repetitive,” and eklxtreme straight-up says there’s “no substance here.” Sis, we’re on a pop music subreddit. angusaditus says, “Meh but good bridge,” and TeamAwesome4 pulls an /r/music and says they’re “still waiting for someone to do to this song, what they did to the Foo Fighters [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vRlJrkxsqo). ffourthofjuly’s appreciation will not go unfettered: “um? unpopular opinion? i love this song? fuck all the haters i love store too.” Yas, Store is amazing. Is Carly in this rate? I forgot.

Meanwhile, breadvelvet pulls an /r/conspiracy: “I’m starting to sense a pattern in these songs. They all have somewhat arena-filling production with unprecedented electronic flair, all have parts with engaging, dynamic melodies, all have parts where she literally sings just one note on the scale like some sort of robot and it sometimes comes dangerously close to ruining the song. Maybe this is a concept album. Idk. It’s a cohesive one, I’ll give it that.” And finally, MrSwearword has some stern words for her: “NO TAYLOR, YOU’RE NOT OUT OF THE WOODS WITH THIS CLUNKY REDUNDANT ‘EFFORT.’” Ouch.

swbrontosaur: I think the repetition in the chorus makes the song.  Even when it seems like things are going well, sometimes relationships are just all woods.  It's just a bad scene, and the happy times can't make up for it.  In fact even when are you in the middle of the good times all you are thinking about is how it might all be an illusion, bad times lurking right around the corner.  You ain't never getting out of those woods.  You are never going to be in the clear.  good?

deleted: People misunderstanding the repetitive chorus, I despair for you. How do you hear a song about uncertainty and regret then not realise she's asking for clarity over and over? BECAUSE SHE'S NOT GETTING IT. She's asking if they're out of the woods over and over because she's not getting any closer to feeling that way! If I was trapped in the woods I'd be asking the same thing!

“Bad Blood” done right, imo. Enough edge to keep it interesting, but not too much that it stops being a Taylor song. The hook is surprisingly amateur, though, and it can be a bit grating.

Altiondsols agrees: “the ‘uh uh uh uh’ noise is annoying and only serves to remind me of her "oooh ooo-ooo oooh" in Mine, another annoying song.” Leave Speak Now out of this! TheAllRightGatsby sorta praises it, saying, “The verse melody and chord progression just annoys me to no end for some reason, I like almost everything else about this song.” ffourthofjuly agrees: “i really like this song too #yikes, i think it’s pretty solid from any way you look at it, and it’s really catchy. also the swell into the chorus is amazing.”

Meanwhile, breadvelvet writes their college dissertation on this song:
>I feel like she’s either taunting me with that formula or she’s trying her hardest to ham it up to confirm that the formula is correct. The chorus is good but sounds like it’s lifted from a completely different song altogether, and everything else is repetitive. Okay yeah she’s definitely taunting me, Swift seems like the type to laugh at meta humor and she definitely foresaw me writing a track-by-track review on this song and made the album in a way that would cause me to repetitively write the word “repetitive”. I think I’m going insane help me.

Pitchfork’s 94th best song of 2014 leaves way too early! After “Shake It Off” and “Welcome to New York” were released ahead of 1989, this is the song that actually made me excited for what Taylor had to offer the world of pop. And I loved it: the racing chorus, the cryptic bridge (“when the sun came up, you were looking at me” is one of the best lines on the album), and those weird-ass Harry Styles references. It might have flopped, and the music video might kinda suck, but don’t be too critical - [Taylor suffered for her art!](http://www.mtv.com/news/2720210/taylor-swift-out-of-the-woods-music-video-behind-scenes/)

People could not get over the chorus. “AWHEEOUTTATHEWOODSAWHEEOUTTATHEWOODSAWHEEOUTTA,” screams JoeThaMo after slapping it with a 1. Altiondsols makes the same joke: “Are we out of the chorus yet, are we out of the chorus yet, are we out of the chorus yet, are we out of the chorus; are we done with this song yet, are we done with this song yet....” You get the idea.

TheAllRightGatsby calls it “mostly a mediocre song but lots of really annoying things, like that sample at the beginning and the super repetitive nature of the lyrics.” MihaMijat echoes him, saying it’s “good, but kinda repetitive,” and eklxtreme straight-up says there’s “no substance here.” Sis, we’re on a pop music subreddit. angusaditus says, “Meh but good bridge,” and TeamAwesome4 pulls an /r/music and says they’re “still waiting for someone to do to this song, what they did to the Foo Fighters [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5vRlJrkxsqo). ffourthofjuly’s appreciation will not go unfettered: “um? unpopular opinion? i love this song? fuck all the haters i love store too.” Yas, Store is amazing. Is Carly in this rate? I forgot.

I have trouble getting all the way through this track tbh. It's not bad though.

“Not bad, but it could use more,” says eklxtreme. angusaditus is stanning: “I love this song so so much. It’s really something special imo.” Altiondisols is as divided as the track itself, saying, “Technically Knew Better should have an 8 and Forever Boy should have a 4.” Smiliaryly, MihaMijat says that ”KB is amazing, FB is solid.”  Meanwhile, MrSwearword calls it “daring considering it’s Ariana but needs better execution to me,” and misguided zombie said it would have been a 10 without “Knew Better.”

KometBlu can’t help but bring up Gaga: “She served artpop with combining two songs into one, but FB deserved to be a full standalone track. That said, I am impressed by how well the transition between the two is.” breadvelvet is also conflicted, saying, “the second half of the song is actually rather sweet imo; she carries a relatively basic chord progression extremely well. the first part leaves a bit to be desired, but i like the song itself, not much to complain about but not much that really wowed me.”

Lmfao I had no idea who Macy Gray was until like two weeks ago tbh. When I first heard this song I even thought it was a guy. Apparently she had a top 5 hit like, a decade ago? It’s sort of a bop though, and her voice is quite lovely.

Also, hooray for the first song to not receive any 0s or 1s!

MrSwearword spills some tea, saying that “Macy outshines Ariana on Ari’s track.” 8485blue disagrees, saying, “i don't like Macy Gray, but Ari SLAYS.” angusaditus calls it “kinda meh kinda cute,” while jimmy345960 just says it’s “bland.” breadvelvet puts his music composition degree to use, saying it’s “entirely forgettable imo, and plus i feel like she has a ton of songs like this one in 12/8 time sig. it accomplishes nothing new and drags down the pace of the album immensely really.” eklxtreme sums the song up quite well, imo: “great vocal and lyrics, interesting feature.”

Rather pretty, but it’s not the kind of song I enjoy. It’s a shame the worst part is the beginning. It seems to be a bit of a fan favorite though, so please don’t kill me.

ffourthofjuly sorta agrees: “hears white-guy-with-guitar sounds nopes out of there.” Meanwhile, JoeThaMo goes awf for his 11: “SUCH AN UNDERRATED TRACK IMO, SLAYS ME EVERY TIME.” Listeningtosufjan has his back, simply sending in a “<3” for his comment. TheAllRightGatsby nods approvingly, saying, “I really like the slightly more laidback acousticy mid-2000s style pop, and the lyrics are actually kind of surprisingly honest and personal here which I really like.” 8485 says they “hate the 'la la la'; the rest of the song is good though.” breadvelvet has many thoughts once more: “i'm liking these tracks so far. the acoustic guitar mixed with the hard-hitting dramatic percussion somehow isn't as cheesy as ‘Making The Most Of The Night’, and suits the lyrics better imo.” It’s almost like Carly’s a part of this rate or something.

[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7p7sjrabPMM)

While a slight bop, I’m still unconvinced this was single material. Ariana’s parts are quite basic (“you got a hot body let’s have sex who cares what our friends say blahblahblah you got me) and Nicki’s verse is far from her best. At least it brought “wrist icicle, ride dick bicycle” into our world. 

Everyone talked about Nicki. Angusaditus thought the “Ariana run pop” line was “a bit cringy,” but TheAllRightGatsby approves of Nicki: “hate the ‘See you standin there with your body’ melody so this woulda been like a 7.0-7.5 if it weren't for Nicki's dope verse; the line ‘Uh, I-I-I give zero fucks and I got zero chill in me’ is where I instantly bumped it up.” 

Altiondsols tells us a story:
>The first time I heard it I thought the line was "recycycle ride dick bicycle", like she's recy-cycling (stealing) your man. Then I discovered the line is actually "wrist icicle ride dick bicycle", which makes both more and less sense.

Meanwhile, TeamAwesome4 apparently isn’t a Nicki fan: 
>This song reminds me about how angry it makes me when the artists announce themselves at the beginning of the track. Nicki kinda kills this for me. ‘Wrist Icicle, ride dick bicycle’ might be the dumbest lyrics I've ever heard, although I do like her saying ‘Ariana runs pop’, no matter how much of a fantasy that might be. The rest of the song is fine.

“Queen of sugar, spice and all things nice.” - BreezySeason

Oops, I think this song sucks. Once again, please don’t kill me. Yes, my blurbs are getting shorter because I want to hurry this up.

eklxtreme likes it, though: “I like the toned down vocals, very 80s but also has the generic modern vibe.” TheAllRightGatsby is also stanning, saying “I hadn't heard this song before today but damn I love it.” breadvelvet is stanning a bit, saying, “Another really sweet song, though she keeps it low-key and not quite as saccharine as the previous track. Major props for using the iamb in her lyrics too! Also I relate heavily to the lyrics which may be slightly contributing to the rating. The bridge before the last chorus seems like a bunch of random snippets of lyrics, though?” You’re too smart for this sub tbh. MrSwearword can’t help but throw some shade, saying it’s “a message to those notes she never holds, obviously.”

I mean, even Flop Again above this? Black Shart? LA Hallushitations? This is a personal attack and I will not stand for it.

EDIT: Oh wait Black Heart is already out its a slightly smaller injustice then.

“Queen of knowing it hurts for a reason.” - BreezySeason

The tables turn and now it’s Carly who’s the heartbreaker in the relationship. At least she’s nice enough to encourage you to get the fuck over her?

“I like how the opening chords kind of mirror the title track of the album. It takes a bit too long to kick in with a subpar course (for her standards) and does seem redundant to ‘Emotion’ and the synth solo is rather cheesy, but it’s pretty nice all things considered.” breadvelvet really is too smart for us tbh. ffourthofjuly says there’s “ nothing particularly great about this song, even though its very very good,” while elkxtreme kind of rambles on, saying, “very fun melody and hook, interesting synth dissonance, nostalgic, hot damn what are these synths at the end.”

“Queen of kissing away the goodbye.” - BreezySeason

This ode to broken hearts and broken hymens is out. It would have fit perfectly on Kiss, but I see why it’s a b-side. All I can say is that it should have been higher than fucking Fever.

Everyone compared it to everything else. MrSwearword says it has “knockoff Whitney Houston’s ‘I Wanna Dance With Somebody’ teas…” I’m willing to take that as a compliment. TeamAwesome4 is one of the other 5 people that have listened to Kiss, saying, “If I didn't know better, I would have guesses this was off of Kiss. That just means this is more of a ‘standard’ bop that Kiss had rather than ‘Change what music means to me’ bop like Emotion had.” breadvelvet has a completely different interpretation, saying “this song reminds me a lot of “Reunion” by M83, which was like my favorite track on their album. So yeah this is really really good.” eklxtreme then says it “sounds like a modern day Cyndi Lauper.” I kinda hear it.

swbrontosaur: a good example of what could have gone wrong if *E MO TION* leaned too heavy on the 80s signifiers.  Quality song, but it starts drifting into pastiche pretty hard, which I think takes away from the song.  Also, there is this chime-y bell sound which is exactly the same tone and tempo as my refrigerator's the-door-is-open warning chime. It gives me low key anxiety, and I literally walked into my kitchen the first couple of times I listened to it.
