[RATE] 1989 vs EMOTION vs Dangerous Woman
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/4xmic6/rate_1989_vs_emotion_vs_dangerous_woman/

Welcome, denizen of /r/popheads, to our first ever sub-wide rate. For those who haven't seen rates before, this is our chance to rank the songs from our favorite pop albums from the past few years: 1989, Emotion, and Dangerous Woman. Have you ever gotten in a fight over whether song A is better than song B? Well we're going to do that, but for a buttload of songs. Here's what to do.

1) You listen to every song on all three of these albums.

2) You assign each song a score of 1 - 10 (decimals are fine). You can also give ONE song total a score of 11 and ONE song a score of 0. Also feel free to add any comments that you'd like to any song, and I'll reveal them along with the song.

3) You PM me your scores (and optional comments) and I aggregate everything.

4) I reveal the order incrementally, starting from the bottom.

5) You get mad when your favorite songs get knocked out too early. A flame war follows and we end up on /r/subredditdrama.

Any other questions? Feel free to ask below. In the meantime, start listening and start rating. I'll give you guys until August 31st to finish up your scores. 

Following this are all of the songs you have to rate. Copy and paste it on a word file or something, then put your score right after each song. Then PM me your list.
