[RATE REVEAL] Disney/Nickelodeon Day 1: Bop Bop Bop, Bop to the Flop!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6ubc5e/rate_reveal_disneynickelodeon_day_1_bop_bop_bop/

Today is the first of four days of the Disney/Nick Singles Rate reveals!

* The reveals will start at 2:00 PM EST today and tomorrow. Saturday's and Sunday's will start at 4:00 PM EST.
* I will be revealing #75 to #56 today.
* I will not be doing shitposts for each song, but there will be a few 1 minute shitposts scattered here and there on the **[plug.dj](http://plug.dj/popheads)**. After each song, I'll usually play another song by the same artist.
* **80 users participated** in this rate. Neat!
* The total average of this rate is **7.2412**. Awesome.
* The controversy average of this rate is **2.1254**. Anything above that should be considered controversial.
* Please remember that this is just a rate and that everyone has different opinions. We do rates for fun, not to attack each other!

**Video directed by** Mickey Finnegan

We all know she can’t sing, and yeah this song is over-produced, yet it’s still a very campy and enjoyable bop. The music video takes place in the same set diner that was used in CeeLo Green’s “Fuck You” and Cher Lloyd’s “Want U Back” (US Version). It’s the perfect type of cotton candy saccharine pop, and I cannot believe it’s the first song out!

---

# CALL IT A BOP

**tevinterimperium**: "This is such a standard bubblegum pop song. I love it. The music video is cute and slayed Cher Lloyd"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Budget Roar? Budget Roar. I will say I like that synth line, and the song itself is definitely catchy."

**calltehshots**: "This is no Jersey by the ice skating chanteuse but it's still a cute little bop."

**Hogwartsreject1912**: "beyond unpopular opinion but whatever I love this song."

**chili_jones**: "LIVING for the chorus, can't believe bella didn't credit the kidz bop feature."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I wanted to hate this but this is an adorable bop."

**jamesfog**: "Invented Cher Lloyd! Whatever whatever whatever whatever whatever"

**rickikardashian**: "I hate that I don’t hate this song tbh"

**SkyBlade79**: "I’m giving this a 10 only and completely because she’s hot now. But to be honest, this bops kinda? The melodies are rather charming and though the production sounds immature, it still bops."

**bwc222**: "ok so autotuned but soooo catchy... like who knew blela throne could be somewhat enjoyable to listen to?"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "This song is very dumb and cheesy but this is basic pop music at its finest tbh."

**kappyko**: "i'm belela thorne and I can read now. fuck I love the carnival-esque synths, this is sooooo cuuuuute"

**twat_brained**: "I feel like the context of this song could be applied to the reason why Bella is still (somewhat, anyway) relevant in 2017"

**eklxtreme**: "this goes hard af, it's so danceable and fun"

**musicotic**: "Ok, my knees bopped together when i was listening to this. Song is telling me to stop being a ho?"

# WHATEVER

**VodkaInsipido**: "[WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER WHATEVER](https://pics.onsizzle.com/black-power-b4squiat-we-gone-starve-bella-vita-drugproblem-bella-7241179.png) 

[WHATEVER](https://i.gyazo.com/01281d42cb2d86fffe0869f670e88b20.png)"

**gannade**: "watch Famous In Love on Freeform"

**Nfranklin50**: "This feels like watching videos of a dead person"

**Leixander**: "Her voice is not fit for singing IMHO. This song just feels forced."

**poppinmmolly**: "Queen of dating Scott Disick"

**agentofscranton**: "i'll call it trash"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "because bella thorne blocked me"

**fifthchevron**: "Is it me or do these Disney/Nick productions just provide kids bop versions of other songs? This is just G rated Candyman."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Cheap and annoying."

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Do yourself a favor and just listen to [this Nightcore version of “Get Your Sparkle On” from Barbie: A Fashion Fairytale](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-sHtxMoJnA) because it’s more or less the same as this song, except better. The resemblance is uncanny, except I think “Get Your Sparkle On” is a little bit more mature."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "...yikes. This song is migraine-inducing. It feels like a thorn in my gut. Haha, get it? Thorn? Thorne? ...I have no other words."

**JMez2612**: "This is disturbing"

**lady_sable**: "stick to acting sis"

**seferre2**: "ok first of all where is ttylxox? and the quality is so low at the prechorus lol"

**Lexarqade**: "Man Belela Throne just can't catch a break. This is bad."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "no just no"

**MissyBee37**: "I legit did not know she was a singer lol"

**SimplyHaunted**: "Yeah, I call this a hot mess."

**ImADudeDuh**: "lol no thanks"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "just like any vocal ability bella thorne may have, just call it whatever!"

**omgcow**: "This super cutesy video is hilarious given how much of a hot mess she is"

**dropthehammer11**: "holy fuck what is this. bitch what is that cheeto hair"

**awryj**: "I have no idea whether I like it or hate it, it's somewhere between absolutely infuriating and incredibly catchy."

**superr_rad**: "lol she's not singing, she's talking. im not interested in the anti-bella CJ but this is not good, despite the fun production. she sounds like ashley tisdale at some points in the chorus. let's call it do better."

# ICONIC

**huntyphobic**: "My name is Bella Thorne, and this is the story of the time I found out I had dyslexia. I remember when I started first grade. Right away, it was awful because I couldn't read as well as the other kids. My brain mixed up letters like b and d and m and w. Dyslexia is different for EVERYONE who has it. For me, it just made it harder to read or write. I started working really hard on how to read better. My family helped me by making me read everything from menus, to cereal boxes, to road signs. Today, I read a year above my grade level. And I learned to face my problems, not run away from them. Dyslexia makes things hard for me but, not impossible. You just watched a TTI, on Disney Channel."

# POO

**letsallpoo**: "There's something so tantalizingly demonic about this song, something about the way Bella sings and the way she coyly stares at the camera in the music video that renders this sugary pop song so insane and addictive. Bella isn't singing about love - nothing about her delivery hints that she really gives a shit about the boy aside from the fact that she wants him for herself. And the song charges forward, more of a cocaine high than a sugar rush, under this pretense of carnal desire without actual regard for the object of affection. It's a whirlwind of pure, deranged feeling that becomes all the weirder when transmitted through a Radio Disney lens."

YALL all can stop hating on bella she is doing this for her late father her father told her to never give up before he died and this is what God put her on earth to do and her and Zendaya are best friends for life and for those of u who say bella is jealous of zendaya please just don't of YALL done got nothing nice to say about her then don't say it beacuse all she is going to do is ignore it so ur washing ur time by writing down ur stupid little ass comment and she can sing other celebrities lip sing too so YALL can get off if her she can sing dance act so leave her the hell alone she lost her father at 9 so it's hard on her but She is doing very well and Bella has more albums then zendaya and Bella has alot if things ahead of her and I'm not saying that I don't like zendaya cause I really really do but sill that's all I have to say

**RANK**:

- #75: Call It Whatever - 5.083

---
**Ghost-Quartet**: A lot of child stars have public breakdowns and become messes but to the best of my knowledge Bella Thorne never really had a public breakdown.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Wasn't she the girl who dated the vampire in Harry Jackson? I'm surprised she's pursuing a singing career. I thought the series she was in sent terrible messages to young girls

**jamesfog**: https://pics.me.me/she-was-fearless-and-crazier-than-him-she-was-his-12565682.png

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: It's funny and sad how Zendaya is able to outsold Bella in everything while Bella became a punching bag on Twitter. I think she is kinda annoying as well but I admire her honesty on why she doesn't want to do music anymore, admitting she cannot even sing. lmao.

I love that she drags millennial haters. Queen of /r/lewronggeneration. I’d love to hear more songs addressing how absolutely annoying millennial haters are.

---

# LOVE

**PuggleMaster**: "I was pleasantly shooken by this Wig"

**Nfranklin50**: "this is the biggest plot twist in history"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I was not expecting this? I knew that Jennette McCurdy had a song, but I didn’t expect it to be a country song and I didn’t expect it to be this good? I was about to talk this song up and give it a great score but then I listened to it again and it completely fell apart on the second listen. The message of this song is a little empty, she’s hearkening back to the hippie era and expresses a desire for our generation to be similarly remembered for the good things that we did, but that’s really all she says. She actually lists more reasons that our generation is bad than why it’s good. She had a point of view at least I just wasn’t expecting this from her, so I lowkey gave her a higher score just for the novelty value. Song itself is nice I guess, I actually quite like how it sounds."

**lady_sable**: "This is pretty"

**rickikardashian**: "Jennette is the hero of the millennials"

**huntyphobic**: "literally invented world peace"

**dropthehammer11**: "i feel fuzzy"

**superr_rad**: "god damn bitch, i thought this was some classic country song i clicked on by accident, that accent is unclockable. i might actually check out this album..."

**eklxtreme**: "it's very mellow which is not something I would've expected from her, and it's not bad"

# COUNTRY?

**gannade**: "i actually really dont like this song but Jennette invented country music with So Close so I give this a 10 in her honor"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I can't believe Jennette saved country music who would have guessed that"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "what is this, I'm not American enough to like this"

**tevinterimperium**: "Country queen!"

**poppinmmolly**: "YAAS COUNTRY"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "i literally cannot feel more indifferent towards this song"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Invented country music. I had the biggest crush on her in iCarly it was like so bad god help me."

**mokitsu**: "joanne's impact"

**calltehshots**: "oh my god. TAYLOR IS DEAD. REBA IS CANCELED. MIRANDA LAMBERT? REPORTED MISSING."

**therokinrolla**: "is this shania twain"

**JMez2612**: "It sounds like a Great Value Carrie Underwood song"

**timothy444**: "Country songs? Not in my /r/popheads!!!"

**Lexarqade**: "This is the girl from iCarly right? Why the hell did she pump out a country record? Carrie Underwood is shook. This honestly isn't that bad but it just feels so out of place."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "yee-haw"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "COUNTRY???? ON MY POPHEADS?????? Circlejerky aside, this is decent."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "when i first heard this in circa 2012 I was so shook this wasn’t the type of music I was expecting from her Jennette tbh"

**twat_brained**: "Country?? COUNTRY??? **FUCKING COUNTRY MUSIC?!?! :angery:** THIS IS R/POPHEADS! MISS ME WITH THAT SHIT"

**musicotic**: "Is this country? So did not expect that"

# GENERATION NOT LOVE

**TragicKingdom1**: "Not awful but not interesting."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Put Your Hearts Up was a mess, but at least it was a morbidly interesting mess. I appreciate Jennette's vocals, but this is just boring country pop."

**seferre2**: "don't care"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Sis, I see you trying to appeal to conservative America. And it's trash."

**jamesfog**: "very inoffensive song..."

**SkyBlade79**: "literally all I know about this person is that her nudes leaked so uh… with that in mind, I can’t like this song"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "this is so cringe i feel sorry for her"

**bwc222**: "this song is absolute trash and i couldn't bear to listen to it more than once"

**awryj**: ""Connected to a plasma screen"? Is this song really from 2011?"

# it’s probably for the best

**dirdbub**: "sorry I was shisposting in the discord while this was happening andd I don't wanna relisten pls forgive me"

**kappyko**: "i didnt pay attention to the lyrics but im gonna guess shes fuckin a grandpa"

Poor Jennette - she got about as far in the rate as her career did in the music industry.

**RANK**:

- #74 - Generation Love - 5.155

**Ghost-Quartet**: I feel kind of bad for her because I listened to some of her songs and honestly they weren’t, like, bad or anything, it’s just that I’m acutely aware that I would never have heard of her as a musician if she hadn’t been on a Nick show and I wouldn’t listen to any of them if she hadn’t been on a Nick show. I’m always acutely aware of how kind of… unnecessary she is. In fact, I’m still not going to listen to her music. Sorry.

**Charts:** [GER: 45] // **Release Date:** May 2, 2008

**Written by** Ashley Tisdale, Janice Robinson

**Produced by** Guy Roche

**Video directed by** Scott Speer

---
Ashley didn’t really have the strong vocals needed to pull off a ballad like this. Her vocals have improved a lot since then, so I’d love to hear a new rendition of this from her. Also, no one wants to hear a piano ballad from her following all those bop singles.

---

# are you serious? right in front of my ballad?

**gannade**: "wow who knew the queen of hoe bops is also amazing at balladry!!"

**PuggleMaster**: "It was a 6 but that violin SHOOK ME up to a 8"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "really boring, Sharpay deserves better songs"

**letsallpoo**: "i listen to ashley for slut bops not for stuff like this"

**fifthchevron**: "lol the instrumental is doing the MOST to evoke emotion from that terrible, terrible voice."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Not really the musician to be making ballads. It doesn't really pay off but the end is kinda nice."

**mokitsu**: "crank it up ashley!"

**calltehshots**: "Wow this BALLAD. Demi is shaking?????"

**dirdbub**: "hot take I hate this"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I adore this song? I had never heard it before the rate, and I found it very touching. A surprisingly tasteful song compared to a lot of the other songs in this rate, this song has a very theatrical sensibility to it. It’s got fairly minimal production with a very delicate and ethereal quality about it, the strings float over the piano accompaniment and the backing vocals come in and out like a heavenly choir. Ashley’s voice is very weak here, but honestly that kind of improves it for me. She still manages to give a lovely vocal performance, she’s very emotive and her wavering vocals paint the song in a different light. If she were powering her way through the song belt after belt the song would feel like a celebration, but instead it feels sort of… starstruck. There’s a hint of trepidation to it, because she almost literally can’t quite live up to the expectations that the song sets. There’s vulnerability here and it’s telling that this was the last song on the album and one of the few that Ashley really has a cowriting credit on. Tisdale had been working in the industry since her childhood, but this song was written and recorded during that period when she was blowing up on her way towards becoming an “it girl.” She was barely in her 20’s at the time, and I can’t imagine what it would be like to devote your childhood to something so risky as show business for that long and then, against all odds, manage to break through where so many others have failed. It’s a beautiful musical portrait of the moment when your dreams have come true and there’s so many possibilities you don’t know what to do so you just pause for a moment and drink it all in. I dunno, maybe I just buy into emotionally manipulative schlock but this song gets to me. One minor nitpick though: Ashley like one of the first things that they teach you when you take singing lessons is that you sing the vowels, not the consonants why on Earth would you sing “gi**rrrrrrrrrrrrrrrrr**l” at 1:36 it completely shattered the vibe for me. If she could just go back and re-record that this song would be perfect."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is way more tolerable than some of the other ballads in this rate, but I honestly don't think Ashley's voice does this song justice. Put it in the hands of a more memorable vocalist, and it may actually be more than half decent."

**chili_jones**: "on the one hand this is a little too disney but on the other hand this was peak raw emotion as a 10 year old"

**lady_sable**: "The piano combined with the strings got me fucked up"

**seferre2**: "why are we rating this i'm sorry i don't like ballads but this one isn't that bad"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This song isn't bad, but I need my hoe bops! This is clearly a HSM reject."

**timothy444**: "Sounds like early Taylor Swift if she wasn't a snek."

**Lexarqade**: "Oh so now we're doing ballads? Okay. Unfortunately Ashley cannot carry a ballad. Devoid of all life and E-MO-TION."

**jamesfog**: "This song will probably go out Day 1 but it's a beautiful ballad and showcases Ashley's vocals really well!!"

**rickikardashian**: "This is meant to sound like an emotional song and shit, but it’s like lowkey so narcissistic it’s so funny"

**SkyBlade79**: "wake me up when this song starts"

**SimplyHaunted**: "Her voice just sounds so weak here."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Ok, I love ballads more than most popheads but pls make them better next time ashley"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "cute"

**bwc222**: "god this song screams candace flynn, like it sounds straight up from phineas & ferb"

**kappyko**: "actually? I thought this ballad was gonna suck, but whenever there's bass guitar against piano in a ballad I always love the sound it gives off (see Not Like the Movies). melodramatic but not bad, props to tisdale for this"

**dropthehammer11**: "she actually managed to make a ballad sound fake yikes"

**twat_brained**: "Errr… I'm not sure ballads really suit Ashley. I can appreciate the fact that she tried something different here, and it's very cute, but it's missing genuineness."

**awryj**: "oh god the cheeeeeeeeese"

**eklxtreme**: "very sweet and personal song, it's very nice for such a slow song"

**musicotic**: "It isn't that much of a bop tbh."

Ariana Grande, (imo) the most compelling and consistently excellent pop girl of this generation, released her saccharine ode-to-peace debut single in 2011. I remember the day it was released - she was still only known as the redhead from *Victorious*. She had no more than a couple of million of followers on Twitter, and back then, her character from *Victorious* blended into her own personality. She asked her fans to pick the single cover (all the options were pretty ugly), and I bought this song hoping it would slay the charts. It had no impact, and I forgot about her until she came back new and improved with her 2013 hit single “The Way”. I will always be curious how different her career would’ve been if she released a bubblegum pop record. I sure as hell was looking forward to a bubblegum pop record, but in retrospect, it might’ve kept her from having the almost flawless discography that she has now.

I love this pacifist anthem, but I also understand why it ranked this low. It’s more of a Cat Valentine single than an Ariana Grande single. I quite liked that 4 Non Blondes sample too, but that was before I found out it was a meme.

---

# Queen of memes, Memeranda who?

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Sounds eerily similar to that He-Man meme. The song itself is like... I don't know. Remembering this exists makes it easy to see why I wasn't an Ariana stan back then. Her vocals are good but everything else about the song is bad. And the cover. Yikes."

**therokinrolla**: "the chorus sounds like this parody song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QtcL96CDJf8"

**Lexarqade**: "Sorry, I just can't. I know this song will probably either be out literally first or win the entire rate, so I'll contribute to the former. If the shitpost link isn't the He-Man remix of "What's Going On" by 4 Non Blondes popheads is cancelled." (no shitposts sorry sis)

**huntyphobic**: "Ms. Areola Granola THOUGHT she could snatch He-Man’s bob, but his wig is still firmly in place hunties!"

**ImADudeDuh**: "The meme is better"

**VodkaInsipido**: "I SAY HEY IEEEE IEEEE IE IE HEEEEEEY"

**awryj**: "Sorry Ari, but What's Up belongs to He-man only."

# HEARTS UP

**NapsAndNetflix**: "this is unironically ari's best song" (naps please)

**tevinterimperium**: "It's not Into You, but it's still good I guess."

**poppinmmolly**: "not as bad as everyone says it is"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Sounds super dated, but the sample works and it has a really strong chorus."

**lady_sable**: "I was expecting the worst after hearing how much everyone (even Ari) hates this song, but it's honestly not that bad?? Like yeah it's cheesy and her later stuff is miles better, but it's not a bad song imo. It's cute."

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "Wasn't nearly as bad as I was expecting considering [she very much dislikes the song](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/how-ariana-grande-and-max-martin-made-problem-the-song-of-the-summer-20140522). I do think that most of her later stuff blows this out of the water though."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This honestly was my favorite Ariana song for years. And this has a brand-new meaning now and I just have to give it my 11."

**jamesfog**: "Even though Ariana hates this song it still bops! It's just so happy! Also, iconic sample usage"

**rickikardashian**: "“What’s up” could have never"

**SkyBlade79**: "It’s cheesy but there’s really not much not to like about it!"

**omgcow**: "Ok I thought she/her stans hate this song but it's cute? Idgi"

**SpanKKy1**: "My legs are up instead"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I understand why Ariana disowned this song because this doesn't feel geunine to her but fuck it, this is a bop. Not my fault Ariana has bad taste in her own music. :meghan:"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "this song is good but you fat whores will do this so dirty smh"

**eklxtreme**: "the chorus is admittedly very catchy and the sample is nice"

**musicotic**: "Cute and catchy"

# HEARTLESS

**whatyourheartdesires**: "one of Ari's worst songs, 4 non blondes > 1 non blonde"

**letsallpoo**: "girl look how orange u fuckin look"

**agentofscranton**: "awful awful awful ari was right to disown this"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "i mean definitely far from arianas best. actually close to some of her worst."

**fifthchevron**: "It's fine, just generic. Buy "What's Up" on iTunes instead."

**calltehshots**: "This song is t r a s h but her cheeto dust/Jersey Shore tan is a 10 for hilarity."

**dirdbub**: "I.., I actually thought this was released on one of her studio albums post-Disney I'm yelling"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Wow Ariana sure has come a long way, huh? In all honesty, I don’t hate this song. I don’t want to listen to it but then I’m not actively put off by listening to it. It’s just super duper basic, something Ariana has openly admitted, but for what it is it’s… fine. I honestly think that this would rank a lot higher if it had come from someone other than Ariana, but coming from her it’s clear what a waste this song was."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "...oh, God, why? I can see why Ariana hates this song. It's kind of ...terrible. I have one nice thing to say about it; the hook is irresistible and immediately gets stuck in your head upon first listen. Unfortunately, the hook isn't enough to save the rest of the song. The production and the sample are just awful, and the lyrics are dry and insipid as a social studies teacher lecturing an auditorium of bored middle school students about the founding of the United Nations. The Way is a much, much debut single than whatever this is."

**chili_jones**: "i could barely even make it through omg so boring"

**JMez2612**: "This song is REALLY cringe, I get why Godriana hates it"

**timothy444**: "Sorry Ariana but it says a lot when even you hate this song. It's so kiddy that I can't see myself listening to this again."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "not that bad just corny as fuck and the dance moves in the video LMAO"

**MissyBee37**: "Sorry Ari I love her recent stuff but not this!"

**SimplyHaunted**: "What did I ever do to deserve listening to this? If only I could give more than one 0."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this would actually be a fun bop if she didn't look like an oompa loompa with a musty wig being forced to sing in the music video. blink twice if you need help, ari!!"

**bwc222**: "even ariana hates this song"

**berober04**: "You know those AYYs that Schmoyoho put in their autotune songs. I say them instinctively to this song."

**kappyko**: "not terrible but like hilariously saccharine pop shit. wth were u thinking girl. I normally love vocal skipping effects, but this just feels like too much for a song that isn't really good. it's a charity single basically, and using those kinds of effects just feels tacky and children's movie soundtrack crap"

**BreezySeason**: "ari why, this is so bad"

**dropthehammer11**: "ok dis cute but like too sugary for me. it's like frosting"

**Johnnytoby**: "ew"

**twat_brained**: "This song makes "Focus" sound like "Bad Decisions", which is ironic because it was a bad decision to release this as a debut single." (focus is a bop y’all hate fun)

**superr_rad**: "i love ariana, i will stan her til i die, but this was such a miss, and it wasn't her fault, she just had to grow out of the cutesy bow thing that made her look 13 before singing about taking dick and being a legit pop goddess. doesnt make this song any better tho."

Ariana Grande - donut licker, queen of enunciation, dangerous woman, and a total sweetheart - after starring on Broadway, she was casted on Nickelodeon's *Victorious*. Her character Cat was so popular that she became a lead character of the *Victorious* and *iCarly* spin-off *Sam & Cat* along with Jennette McCurdy. *Sam & Cat* was eventually cancelled on July 17th, 2014. I don't think "Love Me Harder" would've been released if *Sam & Cat* hadn't been cancelled, so I guess we can be thankful for the show's cancellation (also because the show sucked lol). Within her career with Nickelodeon, Ariana became Nickelodeon's most successful artist when "The Way" and "Problem" hit the top ten on the Billboard Hot 100. We all know how far she's come since then.

btw, the *Yours Truly* singles weren't included so that *Yours Truly* can be rated as an album in a future rate. I reckon they would've done pretty well on this one, though.

###Give Ariana your 11 and 10s on this month’s rate!

**RANK**:

- #71 - Put Your Hearts Up - 5.522

**Ghost-Quartet**: Oh boy. To me, the finest pop star currently working. She’s amazing, she’s never put out a bad song. I knew about her back when she was in 13 and she kind of dropped off my radar for a while until I rediscovered her last year and I am so glad she’s flourished into such a classy artist. Yours Truly and Dangerous Woman are the two main albums instrumental in getting me interested in pop music and those two albums helped me get through one of the roughest years of my life. Now if she could go ahead and drop AG4 sometime soon that would be great.

**patronsaintofaspies**: It's unfortunate that Ariana's career had to start with such a shitty song, but can we all at least be thankful that she didn't release an entire album featuring this quality of music? If she did, she might have as well been laughed out of the music industry. Sigh

**jamesfog**: The start of an already iconic career!

**Charts:** [US: 93] [US Pop: 28] // **Release Date: February 3, 2016**

**Written by** Kenneth Edmonds, Leon Thomas III, Zendaya

**Produced by** Babyface, Prince Chrishan

---
Chris Brown LOST. This duet was first recorded with Babyface, then Babyface’s vocals were swapped out for Chris’. Zendaya rerecorded her part after hearing Chris’ because she didn’t want to be shown up by him. This probably would’ve been at least 20 spots higher if Chris Brown wasn’t on it. This was Zendaya’s last single. She decided not to release the video after Chris Brown made gross comments about Kehlani’s suicide attempt ^[[source](http://www.inquisitr.com/2953665/chris-brown-disses-zendaya-tinashe-and-fifth-harmony-for-unfollowing-him-after-kehlani-suicide-comments/)]. The song samples TLC’s “Creep” aka the highest rated song on /r/popheads to date. The lyrics describe being in a club and wanting to have a one-night stand - pretty edgy for a Disney star.

---

# A RATE WINNER

**mokitsu**: "queen of sampling the highest rated song EVER by /r/popheads <3"

# SPEAK OF THE DEVIL

**gannade**: "chris brown dragged this down all the way to a 0"

**ncd46**: "Loses points for Chris Brown"

**PuggleMaster**: "Even with the questionable feature it's a bop"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "why did she work with Chris B. :("

**tevinterimperium**: "I would score it higher for the Creep sample, but the Chris Brown feature makes this irredeemable."

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "this would be a 10 if chris brown wasnt in it"

**TragicKingdom1**: "The sample makes the song. Wish literally anyone else featured, though."

**calltehshots**: "okay i know satan christopher brown is in this but oh my god this is a BOP. i hate him bc we never got a video for it since he's such a petty shit!! zendaya did THAT."

**dirdbub**: "this gets a -3 for Chris Brown :deadbanana:"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Zendaya you’re better than this. Supposedly the song was first recorded with Babyface, but he was replaced with Chris Brown, a choice which I find absolutely baffling. The image of Zendaya having a one night stand with Chris Brown, quite frankly, makes my skin crawl. Zendaya at least had the decency to cut all ties with him and not release the music video after he made comments about Kehlani’s suicide attempt, but the song is still a 0. It’s not even just my bias either: the song isn’t that great. The lyrics are shallow and banal, it’s such a non-specific, non-sexy sex jam. You wanna try something new? Great. What is it? Why? The chorus isn’t catchy and you can’t really sing along to it and it doesn’t really make you wanna dance. I’m rooting for Zendaya but this song was a bad choice in general."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I'd expect a song sampling TLC to a. be actually memorable and b. not have Chris Brown on it"

**therokinrolla**: "huuuuuge drop in quality from replay. Also chris brown. yuck."

**Hogwartsreject1912**: "Blame it on the existence of Chris Brown tbh."

**chili_jones**: "not rly here for chris brown but zendaya's parts go off"

**JMez2612**: "It would be a ten if Chris Brown wasn't on it. The sample of TLC is A1!"

**lady_sable**: "Would be higher if not for Chris Brown; fortunately his presence is fairly minimal"

**seferre2**: "if you mfers sabotage this because of how shit chris brown is i will puke zendaya does not deserve"

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "Why is Chris Brown here? He doesn't add anything to the song that couldn't have been done with a less shitty artist"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I'm super ashamed this is such a bop."

**timothy444**: "Chris Brown's verse? Kinda just felt forgettable. Yeah, that's the word to describe it."

**Lexarqade**: "Automatic for Chrs Brwn. Sorry not sorry."

**jamesfog**: "Chris Brown? In this economy? The Creep sample is nice tho"

**rickikardashian**: "I’m conflicted. I love Zendaya, I love the song, I love the 90’s/early 00’s vibe it gives, I love the TLC demo, but I fucking hate Chris Brown, so I’m having a hard time enjoying this song like I should"

**SkyBlade79**: "it’s better than creep, at least. A few points off for Chris Brown."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "love the chorus but it would've been better without Chris"

**ImADudeDuh**: "It's a bop, but Chris Brown :////"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "i just close my eyes and pretend the literal breathing garbage Chris Brown isn't there, then it's a 10"

**bwc222**: "points docked for the chris brown feature tbh"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Man, fuck Chris Brown and Republic for basically ending Zendaya's music career. This song is fucking amazing and should have been a bigger hit. The way 'Creep' was sampled in this song was fucking amazing. It's too bad Zendaya was like "Fuck this, imma not give this song a music video." when Chris Brown made fun of Kehlani's statements on contemplating suicide. It's unfortunate but it's really nice for Zendaya to have that much power to do this. Oh well, whether she would do music again after Something New or not is up to debate but there is no doubting that her movie career would be exploding with role after role especially after the sucess of Spider-Man: Homecoming."

**VodkaInsipido**: "JUST A FRIENDLY REMINDER FUCK CHRIS BROWN FUCK HIS ABUSIVE ASS FUCK HIS RIHANNA BEATING ASS FUCK HIS FRANK OCEAN PUNCHING ASS FUCK HIM IN EVERY PART OF HIS LIFE DON'T EVEN CONSIDER SUPPORTING HIM IN ANY ASPECT OR YOU'RE DEAD TO ME"

**kappyko**: "very nice sampling of Creep here, cute stuff. let's forget chris brown is here"

**twat_brained**: "Sampling a rate-winning song? HELL YEAH! Working with a known abuser of women? While still being signed to Disney Channel? Wyd girl??"

**superr_rad**: "man what the hell this is a legit bop, i love the creep sample, it works so well. but WHY IS PIECE OF ACTUAL SHIT ON THIS???? I have a feeling it was the label and not Zendaya, but i will not be listening to this again unfortunately. :("

**musicotic**: "Has Chris Brown :/"

# SOMETHING BAD

The title of the song is “Anti-Love Song,” so I don’t know why you had to make it an “Anti-/u/Ghost-Quartet [+38] Song” too. You don’t wanna sing about love, then maybe don’t sing a whole song about how you don’t wanna sing about love? Meet me in the parking lot Raven, I’ll give you something to sing about.

This song was written contextually for the movie *Raise Your Voice* - a flop movie in which Hilary starred. In the movie, her older brother dies in a car crash. The scene where she sings this song got me in my feelings as a kid. Anyways, this sappy song holds a special place in my heart because my very religious kid self always listened to this song whenever I was sad.

**PuggleMaster**: "THIS BALLAD MADE ME CRY AJFDKLJDAKFJASDK"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "omg the opening (ish) scene of raise your voice is so shocking and sad I was shook I can't believe this wasn't nominated for an academy award"

**poppinmmolly**: "okay I didn't ask to CRY. JESUS."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I try to write comments for every song but Hilary is making it hard for me because she’s just so consistently good there’s not a lot for me to say about her other than just “wow another great song!” For my money I think that of everyone in the rate she’s written the best songs while still under the Disney umbrella, I didn’t really come to love most of these artists until they left Hollywood Records but from the get go Hilary Duff was a gem."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Is this a religious song? Wow, Katy stole that motif from Hillary. Haha, I kid. It's a fine song. Hillary's voice is really soothing. I'd listen to this song if I was feeling blue."

**chili_jones**: "omg i cri evry tim"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "An inspirational bop."

**jamesfog**: "Lowkey Christian anthem, my religion is Duffism"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "YES SLAY ME HILARY"

**SimplyHaunted**: "Nostalgia bumped this song up a full point because Raise Your Voice used to be one of my favorite movies, but this song has such cheesy lyrics."

**ImADudeDuh**: "An Emotional ballad :sad:"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "cute"

**omgcow**: "I loved this song in Raise Your Voice (2004) which, btw, is a cinematic masterpiece"

**dropthehammer11**: "this is pleasant"

**superr_rad**: "this comes from a really good movie called raise your voice that made me cry, i recommend it. i remember some girl sang this in my middle school talent show and it was...a choice."

**eklxtreme**: "a pretty sweet song. Goddess Hilary is watching over me 👼"

# ATHEISTS

**gannade**: "When Hilary makes some of the best bops and decides to release a ballad"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I forgot this song while listening to it, sorry Hilary. The chorus had a chance to be interesting but it wasn't."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Possibly the most generic song I've ever heard. Sounds like it should be attached to a Disney direct-to-video sequel." (fair enough)

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

**therokinrolla**: "this is kinda nice because once you get past the second chorus the guitar kicks in and makes the second half p okay. The rest is trash tho"

**lady_sable**: "meh"

**Lexarqade**: "Man these non-singles are such a slog to get through." (they’re all singles lol)

**SkyBlade79**: "Trash. Nothing interesting about it at all and the lyrics are for 5 year olds. This is the worst type of pop. Most of the Hilary Duff songs on this rate are so forgettable that I’m not going to even waste time writing separate comments. This is what people think of when you say the "music industry", as in a machine pumping out the exact same, inoffensive thing just because it "worked" in the past. this gives pop a bad name. This is the musical equivalent of the emoji movie. She rhymed “say” with “say”."

**twat_brained**: "This is **not** as good as I remember it being; it literally sounds like a more over-emoted "The Climb". I hope this is out on Day 1."

**musicotic**: "This Christian propaganda"

I kinda have an irrational hate for this song and Emily Osment’s music because of a personal memory. Back when this song was released, I sent one of my friends this because of those “LMS for a song” things, but I didn’t have a crush on her at all - I just wanted to show the good sis a bop. She posted a status: “Why are all the guys that I meet so creepy?” and we’ve never spoken to each other since. 😢

---

# LIL TURKEY

**calltehshots**: "Storytime: My friend and her went to the same college and he would always see her in the caf and she would always eat turkey sandwiches so we've referred to her as 'lil turkey' ever since. let lil turkey thrive guys."

# LET’S BOP

**awhile2**: "youre on my radar, youre on my radar"

**tevinterimperium**: "OMG Emily is a homewrecker. legend please"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A messy Britney bop. I approve."

**Lexarqade**: "This is actually pretty great. I dunno what this girl did after Hannah Montana but her voice is quite good. All the lyrics of this song are a gigantic mood."

**jamesfog**: "A slept on slut anthem!"

**SkyBlade79**: "well damn, she knows what she wants. This really bops too, reminds me of a Tove Lo song kinda?"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "Disney serving another wannabe hoe anthem"

**huntyphobic**: "honestly? Wig incinerated!! When will you fave produce such an iconic piece of pop-rock art?? Sultry summery bop of the century! And that artistic choice of the auto-tune on the bridge? Kanye should’ve ended his career right when this was released tbh, he could never top this… and that was just the bridge!!!! Also ur fave wishes they could have this chart success of reaching #31 on Billboard’s Hot Dance Club Songs charts, Mariah is shaking."

**strawberryswing1**: "This production is so good, but her voice sounds strained on the chorus."

**twat_brained**: "Hold up… is this still the Disney rate? This song feels a bit… mature for Disney. Then again there probably weren't many complaints bc no one listened to it anyway." (i choked on my water)

**musicotic**: "Ok, this is giving me great vibes. If only people asked me to be friends"

# LET’S NOT

**poppinmmolly**: "you know she looks like Carrie Underwood but the comparison stops there"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "ew"

**fifthchevron**: "Whatever this beat is, it needs to be banned from music, I'm SO SICK OF IT. Keeps Getting Better, Beware of the Dog, Reach Out, SOS ughhhhhh"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is super busy but nice at times. But at others I seriously have no idea what is happening, it's like a wall of sound."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Basically "Radar" with a bunch of souless sounds thrown on top of it."

**dirdbub**: "this sounds like another song I've heard before but I can't put my finger on it"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I wouldn’t accept a friend request from this song on Facebook, in fact, I would block it. When she sings “I’m knocking you down” I’m assuming that she’s referring to this song’s placement in the rate. I tried to give this song a second listen and honestly I still didn’t like it. The lyrics are inconsistent (they’re all over the place jumping from metaphor to metaphor) and Emily just doesn’t have the necessary swagger to pull a song like this off."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is decent, but it would have been better if it was sung by somebody with more interesting vocals. It has a nice beat, though."

**therokinrolla**: "this sounds like a hey violet bonus track"

**chili_jones**: "what is this!!! was this made by patrice wilson??"

**JMez2612**: "Hannah Montana outsold"

**lady_sable**: "Those lyrics are...messy lmao but the beat goes hard"

**seferre2**: "a little bit overproduced"

**timothy444**: "I still don't know who she is." (poor lilly)

**rickikardashian**: "This honestly just feel like a song the “bad girl” would sing sing in a teen musical. How is this song forreal? It sounds like an SNL parody of teen pop. It is a bit catchy tho so I guess we can give it that. (Also why does it have like the same rhythm as Radar)"

**ImADudeDuh**: "there is a reason" (this will be finished later on)

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this is the most desperate-sounding song I've heard in a long time but I'd be kidding myself if I said I don't relate"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "what the fuck is happening in the bridge"

**kappyko**: "wh" (wh)

**dropthehammer11**: "she copied 5h"

**superr_rad**: "why does this beginning of this remind me of like 3 other songs? any ways, not a big fan of this. and i wanna know who sabotaged her with that album art..."

**eklxtreme**: "the fast singing party is kinda cool, the rest of it is weird and feels like a parody of a club song"

The lead single from *Dignity* is often forgotten, understandably so. I love how fun and punchy the song is though, and it started an amazing era.

**PuggleMaster**: "Inspired Selena's entire Career"

**jamesfog**: "A dark bop, love it"

**rickikardashian**: "I can’t believe Hilary is an arsenist"

**SkyBlade79**: "Okay, this is better than the previous Hilary songs. The production REALLY sounds like Artpop???? Like, the exact same synth progression? Her IMPACT. But really, I’m intrigued now? Did Gaga rip this song off?"

**huntyphobic**: "queen of arson"

**SimplyHaunted**: "At least she was trying do something other than her soft-rock pop?"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "hot"

**kappyko**: "those drums are punchy"

# CALL A FIREFIGHTER PLEASE

**poppinmmolly**: "NOT GOOD"

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "As I was listening through the Hilary singles I was like “how did we ever let her slip away?!” and then this song hit and I was like “oh yeah.” This just feels a lot cheaper and more generic than anything she put out before. Hilary is a charming vocalist but she just isn’t buyable as a dangerous woman. I don’t believe her when she says that being with her is like playing with fire."

**therokinrolla**: "oh my godddd this song is more drawn out and tedious than her entire post-lizzie career"

**timothy444**: "Forgettable"

**Lexarqade**: "Some of the "Adult" Hilary songs fall flat. This is no exception."

**dropthehammer11**: "This sucks"

Sorry, I can’t stand this song! It’s so cheap and atrocious. I’m sorry, Hilary. I’m sorry that you had to record this then release it as a single. Also, I just found out that Joel Madden was 25 years old when he dated 16 year old Hilary, and I’m very disgusted.

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

# YA NASTY

**letsallpoo**: "raven's voice is good but that production is so uninspired"

**fifthchevron**: "Brandy vibes. Really fucking dumb lyrics though."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I like the weirdly sinister tone of this song and I think it’s a nice sendup to that classic to that classic r&b style, but this song has issues. The production isn’t super great (the instrumentals sound really wiry and kinda cheap), the lyrics aren’t particularly memorable, and while the chorus is great the song takes way too long to get to it. But the thing that bugs me the most is that Raven’s vocal performance is very not flattering. She’s got the tone of the song and she has great charisma but too much of the song sits in a very low part of her voice that makes it hard to understand the lyrics and she sounds very nasal throughout most of it, lacking vibrato at a lot of key points. There’s a lot of potential here but it just didn’t work out in the end."

Alright, I know that the lyrics are horribly vapid, but it’s exactly the kind of vapid Disney pop that I love. I can laugh at the song while also bopping to it. I love how ridiculous some of the songs in this rate are, and this is no exception.

# NOT good

**gannade**: "stranger did the ethnic cultural appropriation beats better"

**fifthchevron**: "Remember when it was cool for pop stars to perpetuate internalised misogyny?"

**dropthehammer11**: "is this what plastic sounds like"

**twat_brained**: "Ashley sounds horrible on this, I don't know why she thinks rapping on every other verse will make a bad song good."

# NOT not good

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Wow, this bops. It's unfortunate the vocals are mixed low but it was a different decade, so it's not really that big of an issue. The chorus is a bop."

**calltehshots**: "How have I never heard this song??? Where did all my hair go?? I'm about to make "the type of chick that hits spots in my flip flops listening to hip hop, you feel me?" my Tinder bio."

**MNREDR**: "Humblebrag anthem."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Am I the only one who finds this song weirdly homoerotic? She doesn’t mention boys anywhere in the song, it’s all about how she’s getting attention from all of the girls. Ashley keeps talking about how she enjoys all of the girls looking at her and how she makes them want to be hot and they’re jealous of her. She “moves in ways that make them curious” and has them checking her out. When she says she “wishes they could see what she’s like in real life” she’s talking about how the Disney corporation closeted her, right? That’s why she’s so insistent that she’s just the girl next door and is worried about rumors taking off? That’s why she’s asserting that “what I like I’ma get that,” because she likes girls, so she’s gonna get girls? Is “the type of girl who hits spots” a code word for lesbian? This is one of only two songs on the album that she co-wrote… coincidence?"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "God. This is so catchy. I can't. Why didn't this song blow up?"

**therokinrolla**: "thank you for this everlasting bop"

**chili_jones**: ""hit spots in my flip flops listening to hip hop""

**lady_sable**: "Queen of not giving a fuck"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is...slightly problematic. But a bop nonetheless"

**SkyBlade79**: "She sounds obnoxious but this production bangs!"

**huntyphobic**: "Queen of rap. Iggy: resigned."

**superr_rad**: "this is fine, very cringey at points, but still boppable"

# gotta love pop music

**awhile2**: "this beat is timbaland-lite"

**tevinterimperium**: "the clapping reminds me of Pon De Replay"

**Lexarqade**: "This is just Pon De Replay's drum beat so I was just singing that over this song which made it slightly less terrible. I also hear some of PCD's "Buttons" in there? This is just a weird mashup of the two. Otherwise a hot fucking mess. Bye."

**jamesfog**: "Wow Ashley invented appropriating Indian culture!!11one11"

**rickikardashian**: "Was this like a rejected song for Sharpay to sing?"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "lowkey sounds like a knockoff Pon de Replay but IT'S A FUCKING BOP WITH A GREAT MUSIC VIDEO"

**kappyko**: "legendary lovers found murdered. the indian instrumentation leading into a dancehall beat is really cool. her vocals edge into corny territory tho. i love how while all these disney girls were making generic love pop rock shit she was basically making "fuck me in a club" tracks"

**awryj**: "Wait a minute, is that a [Pussycat Dolls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VCLxJd1d84s) sample? Don't rob those girls like that"

**eklxtreme**: "this almost feels like an improvised parody of a 2000s party song, but it's pretty catchy still"

I really liked this one! I love the *Herbie: Fully Loaded* music video and the abrasive chorus. Also, apparently this went top ten in Taiwan? Queen of Taiwan, I guess.

# HERBIE

**Nfranklin50**: "Shoutout to my man Herby"

**omgcow**: "Herbie- Fully Loaded is legendary"

**superr_rad**: "ahhh nostalgia, reminds me of herbie fully loaded"

# LIND-SLAY

**PuggleMaster**: "OMG I DIDN'T RECOGNIZE THIS BOP UNTIL THE CHORUS I'M SO SORRY LINDSAY SHOOK"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "this is a jam"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I can vibe with this. The hook is evident and pretty solid. I still don't like her instrumentals but it's more tolerable."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I have...mixed opinions on pop punk. That being said, this track is pretty badass. Also, the double meaning is...gross."

**lady_sable**: "tbh I had no idea Lindsay Lohan had so many bangers before this rate"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A messy petty bop!"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Am I listening to Alanis?"

**eklxtreme**: "nice rock vibes and really empowering lyrics"

**musicotic**: "Boppable"

# NO-HAN

**fifthchevron**: "Australian radio overplayed this in 2004 and I still have a headache from it. I don't dig songs about women being possessive brats, either."

**therokinrolla**: "this song somehow bored me so much i almost fell asleep. And its loud as hell"

**timothy444**: "First to go out amirite LUL"

**Lexarqade**: "Boring."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "okay but where is THAT GIRL (DRAMA QUEEN)" (issa soundtrack single)

**dropthehammer11**: "yeah this sucks"

**twat_brained**: "An effort was made. Sadly, Lindsay's vocal prowess does not live up to said effort and the song feels weaker as a result."

**PuggleMaster**: "I'M SHOOK JEUSS QUEEN"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "wow a bop"

**jamesfog**: "the bass is too high, but a cute song"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "cute i guess"

**omgcow**: "I grew up in Phoenix"

**kappyko**: "very anthemic but not much else asides from that"

**musicotic**: "Getting those alt vibes"

# FALL

**gannade**: "what is this trash olivia"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I feel like this kind of bombastic anthem needs a lot more polish."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Unclear who this girl is or why I should care about her but this song is awful. It sounds messy, it’s buried under reverb. Maybe my speakers are broken or something? Why is it so muffled? Is the “RRUUUUUUHHHHhhhheeeeeyyyyyyeeesssss” they screlt several times supposed to be good? One of the few songs in this rate that I actively disliked."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "+1 for referencing my favourite mythological animal, but otherwise this is just an average song"

**SkyBlade79**: "It sounds like Rise but worse"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "generic af and she reminds me of a dollar store Gigi Hadid"

**SimplyHaunted**: "Never heard of Olivia Holt before, but I don't hate this song. But I don’t really like it either."

**twat_brained**: "This reminds me too much of "Stand By You" to take it seriously. At least the video has nice visuals though."

**superr_rad**: "straight from the Katy Perry book of Generic Self-Empowerment Bops"

# UNDERRATED TALENT

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Hmm I see. Good point. The lore of Star Wars is so massive that you can make movies out of the universe without directly connecting to the Skywalkers.

Also not looking forward to the Han Solo movie even tho Donald Glover and Emilia Clarke are in it. Not only it was kinda unnecessary in the first place, the behind the scene drama over the change of directors in the movie was really off-putting and makes me worried that the Han Solo might be awful.

**dirdbub**: "this is fine"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Mm, Alessia Cara released a song with basically the same message the same year this came out, and while I like the Alessia Cara song better I do still like this.

**BreezySeason**: "I heard it as bubble butt bus, if this was actual line would be a 10"

**twat_brained**: "No bus could ever look this fun. Not even the bus in Madonna's "Sorry" video, it's not realistic."

# DIZZOUBLE DIZZUTCH

**awryj**: "DIZZOUBLE DIZZUTCH OH MY GOD"

**seferre2**: "dzouble dzutch"

**fifthchevron**: "what the fuck lmao she surely doesn't take her lyrics seriously??"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This song is a cover, and the original is better because it was weird. This is at its core a novelty song, and Raven just doesn’t have the presence as a performer to pull something like this off. Her voice is sweet and girlish, which is not what this song needs, it needs crazy and she’s just not delivering here. She sounds painfully empty during the second half, as if they just layered a demo track in."

**timothy444**: "Well, somebody had to make a 'trendy' cover of the Wheels on the Bus. Too bad it's still a children song lel"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "wow this songs drags"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "Raven has the weirdest song titles lmao"

Ah yes, Raven… literal Disney legend and also known as the adorable Olivia from *The Cosby Show*. *That’s So Raven* is one of the best Disney Channel shows if not the best (it won my /r/geekheads Disney Channel rate after all), but Raven’s music is far from the best compared to her Disney Channel peers. It’s really unfortunate that Raven’s music career never got on a proper foot considering that Raven has a pretty great voice. She's one of the few stars in this rate who are with Disney right now, check out *Raven's Home* if you liked *That's So Raven*! 

**RANK**:

- #59 - Double Dutch Bus - 6.674
- #64 - Backflip - 6.500
- #69 - Anti-Love Song - 5.580

**Ghost-Quartet**: [She was a replacement in Sister Act: The Musical on Broadway and I actually thought she did really well.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3WmRE0lzVh8) [Linking to a second video because I’m serious, it’s a good show.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qCQH16CEK5g) She’s publicly made a fool of herself many times since then, but maybe now that she’s back on Disney Channel she’ll calm down a bit. Also gonna take this moment though to point out the under appreciated musical talent of That’s So Raven was [Anneliese van der Pol.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dEqUafk4T8c)

**patronsaintofaspies**: I don't see Raven-Symone as a 'former Disney star' or a 'child actress'. I see her as a person who pretends to be fictional characters in different movies. I don't want to unnecessary label her and risk offending her sensibilities.

**jamesfog**: Despite her problematic-ness, I love Raven for starring in the best Disney show and being the heart of The Cheetah Girls. Raven's Home is good too, watch it!

**omgcow**: I'm mad you didn't include Some Call it Magic and Superstition

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Raven definitely has one of the weakest songs in this rate tbh.

**twat_brained**: The greatest musician to come out of every continent in Africa.

Apparently this peaked at #1 on the Bubbling Under chart for 3 weeks. Poor Lindsay.

# EMO QUEEN

**PuggleMaster**: "WIG IS IN ORBIT OMG AAAAAAAAAAA"

**fifthchevron**: "For some reason I was obsessed with this when I was 14. It's very melodramatic, seems more like a song for a vocalist with an older fanbase. Like the video has her breaking down over this average teenage rebellion relationship. I like it, I just wish a more authentic artist sung it."

**calltehshots**: "The fact that this literal dramatic masterpiece doesn't have 100 Grammys, 500 VMAs, 1000 Oscars, and a Nobel Peace Prize is everything that's wrong with our world today."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Honestly I’m impressed, I didn’t know that Lindsay could sing like this. She goes a touch flat at points, but for the most part this is a very ambitious anthem that she handles quite well."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I actually find her vocals to be pretty good here"

**therokinrolla**: "i wish this song was bad so i could make a joke about the title"

**lady_sable**: "A certified banger"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A Vocalist! When will your fave ever? Ariana wishes."

**jamesfog**: "Invented pop rock"

**SkyBlade79**: "Tove Lo’s Over is better but this is pretty okay."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "cute"

**eklxtreme**: "very sweet poprock melodies for a fun carefree song"

**musicotic**: "Her voice actually sounds good on this one" (she sounds great in “Confessions of a Broken Heart” which couldn’t be added to this rate ☹️)

# i want this to be over

**NapsAndNetflix**: "over like her career :("

**tevinterimperium**: "I'm glad her music career never took off."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I mean, it's a song. It's better than Rumors but it's really forgettable and I still don't find Lohan's voice anything special whatsoever."

**Lexarqade**: "I've heard this exact song like 5 times in this rate tbh"

**kappyko**: "over it. somebody on IGN said the intro sounded like a song by the Cure. wtf"

**dropthehammer11**: "Drake did it better"

**twat_brained**: "The song's a bit over-expressive, and the video's plot doesn't make sense, nor feels Disney-appropriate. I hope this is out on Day 1."

The song is an interpolation of 1984 song "[Live is Life](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EGikhmjTSZI)" by Opus (written by Ewald Pfleger, Kurt Plisnier, Gunter Grasmuck, Niki Gruber, and Herwig Tremschnig). It was allegedly meant for Demi Lovato but instead was given to the Hollywood/Republic Records newbie Sofia Carson. It's a definite bop, and I wish it got more attention from the general public. The song was also [remixed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o8omeRwSvtI) to feature Colombian pop star J Balvin.

# NA NA NA NA NA

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I think I’m starting to get burned out on trop pop, but this came out in 2016 and it’s honestly a pretty nice song so I’ll give it a pass. It’s actually quite a fun song, if one that’s not too distinct. That intro had a lot of energy and really hooked me into the song, then the horns that come in during the bridge are a good touch."

**rickikardashian**: "She wears boot heels in the video and it doesn’t match her outfit at all and honestly because of that I should give her a 0"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I don’t have any particularly strong feelings towards this other than wow, this is good. I didn’t even recognize that it was a Hilary Duff song, this feels very mature and polished. I think the reason that Evanescence stopped writing music was because they realized that they could never top this gem."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This heavy metal! Was Born This Way a Hillary ripoff? Gaga is over."

**SkyBlade79**: "Trash. Nothing interesting about it at all and the lyrics are for 5 year olds. This is the worst type of pop. Most of the Hilary Duff songs on this rate are so forgettable that I’m not going to even waste time writing separate comments. This is what people think of when you say the "music industry", as in a machine pumping out the exact same, inoffensive thing just because it "worked" in the past. this gives pop a bad name. This is the musical equivalent of the emoji movie. When even Hopsin’s fly is better, you know you have an issue."

MrSwearword: Great job with the rate, /u/skiddos.

Now a special message from me, The NUKE of Windsor; evil rate kween and perceived contrarian with the silver lining of the day for those that have lost their 11s today.

At least I didn't do this rate so none of your 11s were killed by me. [I'll be laughing for sure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B08BAHGJ_bM) but at least your 11 wasn't at risk of me pointing out whether or not it sucks out loud.

MrSwearword: yeah, the reason I didn't do this rate...remember what happened the last time I gave Disney bitches a chance musically? As far as this rate, I don't know if I could force an 11 or if I could narrow down a 0.

omgcow: I missed this and will probably miss tomorrow too but wtf there were WAY too many Hilary songs eliminated today

MissyBee37: I was surprised to see that one so low, too. I really love Ashley Tisdale, much more so than some of the other ladies on this list, so I know I'm a bit biased, but I think lyrically it's a great song. I know maybe it's a stretch vocally, but it's so pretty and the lyrics are just sweet and vulnerable.

MissyBee37: I just wanted to say thank you again for doing this!! It looks like a lot of work to put together!! This is the first rate I've done, and it's super fun to read everyone's comments. (I didn't realize they would be shared so much. I'll definitely have to add more comments in the future; I only did a couple on this one, usually apologizing for songs I was rating poorly lol because I felt bad!)

Anyway, I'm excited to see the rest of the list!
