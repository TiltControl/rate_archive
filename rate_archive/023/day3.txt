https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6uqseo/rate_reveal_disneynickelodeon_day_3_were_cool_for/

Welcome to the third day of the Disney/Nick Singles Rate reveal!

* The reveals will start at 4:00 PM EST today and tomorrow.
* I will be revealing #35 to #16 today.
* I will not be doing shitposts for each song, but there will be a few 1 minute shitposts scattered here and there on the **[plug.dj](http://plug.dj/popheads)**. After each song, I'll play another song by the same artist.
* **80 users participated** in this rate. Neat!
* The total average of this rate is **7.2412**.
* The controversy average of this rate is **2.1254**. Anything above that should be considered controversial.

**superr_rad**: "story time when i was in 5th grade i called this girl over and right after i said her name i started singing this song to myself and a bunch of kids started making fun of me and called me gay for calling this girl baby even though i was singing the song....anyways i ended up gay anyways so maybe they were just tryna let me know lmao."

# BABY V

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "serving real 240p goodness back in 2006, 360p videos are shook" (i searched the entirety of youtube and could not find one decent video)

**gannade**: "When will your fav take a classic and actually UPGRADE it. You go Baby V!!"

**PuggleMaster**: "THIS IS A LEGENDARY BOP I'M SO SHOOK"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Did every Disney album cover use that same font? Either way, this song bangs and the instrumental is really really nice."

**calltehshots**: "BABY V are the 5 most iconic letters in the english language."

**dirdbub**: "so uh where did this hoe anthem come from"

**chili_jones**: "BABY V! wth honestly i love this song..."

**JMez2612**: "I sing this song ALL THE TIME but I forgot what it was, this song went AWF."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "An iconic R&B jam."

**SkyBlade79**: "Production is really smooth, lyrics are generic."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "i dont have anything for this it's just a bop"

**omgcow**: "I have vivid memories of watching this video when it debuted on Disney Channel. Iconic. Baby V really did #that"

**kappyko**: "ok dude i'm getting ready to hear the indescribable van-oh my"

**twat_brained**: "This song takes everything that made early-mid '00s pop great and puts it all into one, and I am **HERE** for it! And the video does well to back it up too😊"

**eklxtreme**: "the production is so damn catchy and the strings and the sample are great additions to it. I'm bopping to this!"

# GOODBYE VANESSA

**patronsaintofaspies**: "What kind of Janet Jackson ripoff?"

**Lexarqade**: "Ohh man this didn't age well. From the mid-2000's callout to the awful melodies."

**ImADudeDuh**: "omg this intro ruined the song for me"

# THAT SAMPLE

**TragicKingdom1**: "I'd probably be able to take the sample more seriously if that Swiffer commercial didn't exist"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "As a general rule, avoid sampling something as iconic as “Baby Come Back” unless you’re up to the challenge of overshadowing it, otherwise it’s going to just distract from what’s otherwise a decent song. It kind of sounds like it was cut from High School Musical 2 but not in a good way. The song was a solid 7 until that rap verse hit at which point it dropped."

**lady_sable**: "I'm really liking that sample tbh"

**jamesfog**: "Love the sample"

**rickikardashian**: "There was a song that was very popular in Latin America a while ago and it had a very similar “Baby come back”, and i can’t take this song seriously because of it"

**musicotic**: "Who is the horrible rapper intro person?"

**Overall average**: 7.214 **// Total points:** 577.1 **// [Averages](https://pastebin.com/4JRqGVDE)**

Vanessa actually had a huge hit that was her HSM duet with Zac Efron “Breaking Free”. The song peaked at #4 on the Hot 100. Anyone who remembers the late 2000’s remembers *High School Musical* being plastered and discussed **everywhere**. Vanessa’s career was hugely detrimented by her nudes scandal. Vanessa persevered and recovered with lots of acting roles. She did *Gigi* on Broadway and *Grease! Live*. Her music career wasn’t very successful and was put to a stop after the scandal. She recently returned to music as a feature on Shawn Hook’s “Reminding Me”.

**RANK**:

- #35 - Come Back to Me - 7.475
- #43 - Say OK - 7.259
- #52 - Sneakernight - 6.909

---
**Ghost-Quartet**: I’m sympathetic to Vanessa because she’s the only Asian person in the rate, but I don’t forecast her having a particularly strong career as a recording artist. She just doesn’t quite have the songs or the clout behind her to really carve out her own niche in the industry That said, she was actually pretty great in [Gigi on Broadway,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a2pbZIMDUC8) and I liked her in [Rent,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJ8Skz90PVc) and “Sneakernight” actually ended up being one of my favorite songs in the rate. She has my respect for going on in Grease Live just the day after her father died, she’s a real professional and I hope that she finds success somewhere.

**patronsaintofaspies**: So when I was six (yes, I know, I'm young) my dad got a copy of HSM2 before it premiered in my country. I was shook. I ended up liking Gotta Go My Own Way so much to the point where every Sunday, whenever my family ended up deciding to try a restaurant I didn't want to go after church I just kept on singing 'WHAT ABOUT ME?! WHAT ABOUT EVERYTHING I'VE BEEN THROUGH' why was I so annoying as a kid

**jamesfog**: A star!

**omgcow**: Honestly Ashley > Vanessa music wise but I love them both because I stan High School Musical harder than anything. #WhatTeam #Wildcats

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Half-Filipino queen.

I love how calm and catchy this song is. This song has over 100 million streams on Spotify because it was put on Today's Top Hits and all the other pop playlists. The music video features Olivia’s *Kickin It* co-star Leo Howard. I’ve had a lot of people tell me that they were pleasantly surprised by this - I’ll take that as a win!

# WAY WAY WAY WAY BACK

**mokitsu**: "kinda underwhelming tbh"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I like the "way way way way back" but pretty generic otherwise."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is generic and repetitive I literally can’t say anything about it except that it’s not incompetent, I guess? It just doesn’t have a point. Like, you go way back. Great. What else please?"

**kappyko**: "calming but nothing interesting"

**awryj**: "It feels like I've heard this song a 100 times"

# LOVE LOVE LOVE LIKE THAT

**PuggleMaster**: "I'M FUCKING SHOOK MY WIG 11 WORTHY"

**fifthchevron**: "I appreciate the unique sound. I'll be checking out her album."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Invented tropical pop. Nice song."

**calltehshots**: "okay this a bop but again who"

**dirdbub**: "okay this gets better as I listen to it"

**therokinrolla**: "why is the production here so damn good wtf olivia is kickin it (if you dont understand that pun get out)"

**chili_jones**: "i... dont hate this"

**JMez2612**: "Her songs are kinda generic but honestly I kinda dig it."

**lady_sable**: "Ooh, I like this! It's definitely not what I was expecting as an early single from a Disney girl. That's some nice production!"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Queen was clearly ahead of her time."

**timothy444**: "From my first listen, I can already tell I am going to love the heck out of this song!!!"

**Lexarqade**: "Nothing too special but it's a bop."

**jamesfog**: "a perfectly fine trop pop song"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "hella groovy"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "okay cute but what the fuck is that whimpering bullshit that repeats at the beginning and in the background"

**VodkaInsipido**: "it's cute"

**dropthehammer11**: "this is v much a product of our time"

**twat_brained**: "While "way, way, way, way back" is a bit lazy, I think the song itself sounds really well-put together."

**eklxtreme**: "such a bop, I love the chill modern production"

**musicotic**: "Earworm af"

# ONE DIRECTION

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Pretty solid dance pop, surprisingly no r/badhistory material! One Direction still outpeaked though"

**ImADudeDuh**: "a good song but One Direction did history better"

# PLEASE

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I heard this on the radio once and was like wow bop and listened to it quite a bit and then mentioned it in plug being like wow listen to this bop!!! and panda was like uh isn't that some flop disney star skiddos likes and I was like oh"

At least a couple of people have seen Disney XD’s *Kickin It*. I’ll admit that I hated that show, and I never expected Olivia to become an interesting singer. She’s one of Hollywood Records’ better artists right now, and I’m glad that she’s managed to make it this far into the rate. Olivia will play the lead role of Dagger on Freeform’s Marvel Cinematic Universe show [*Cloak and Dagger*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E5hrFVQiGyk).

**RANK**:

- #34 - History - 7.475
- #61 - Phoenix - 6.598

**Ghost-Quartet**: I googled it and this is the girl from Kickin’ It and I hated that show. I hated both of the songs she had in the rate too. Bye.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I just read the Wikipedia article for Kickin' It and I don't know whether to laugh or to cry

I love how anthemic this song is, especially that BRIDGE! Never even noticed the “So What” similarities until it was pointed out by you guys. Regardless, this is my favorite Ashley song; it got stuck in my head for days upon revisiting it for the rate.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "It's hard to think this album came out after Headstrong based on album cover alone. This is one of the first and only songs I've heard because I'm a filthy straight, but I remember bopping to this on Disney radio in secret."

**calltehshots**: "The key change in this deserved 100 Grammys."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is standard pop rock, but it's pretty good standard pop rock."

**lady_sable**: "This is a fucking banger, man"

**seferre2**: "extra point for the key change"

**jamesfog**: "A mega party banger!"

**rickikardashian**: "I think this is her best song because it seems more real than the rest. The other songs seem to be more like a character, they seem more like Sharpay songs than Ashley songs, they are just generic early 2000’s pop™, but this one seems more personal and not as club music"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "wtf love!"

**bwc222**: "this banger reigns over all others"

**VodkaInsipido**: "[me at 0:39](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/022/940/spongebobicon.jpg) vs [me at 0:40](http://i0.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/020/001/krabs.jpg)"

**superr_rad**: "i love this video, ive always wanted to make out with people. also im a sucker for a good breakup bop"

**eklxtreme**: "that key change came outta nowhere and it was good"

# WHITNEY

**tevinterimperium**: "It's not right, but it's okay"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Whitney WHOston? Seriously though this song is just OK."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Whitney Houston is SHOOK. Also Wow, this sounds so much like So What."

**Lexarqade**: "Whitney Who? Very average post-breakup feel-good song that I've heard a billion times before."

Demi’s non-*Camp Rock* debut is out! (“Moves Me” doesn’t exist to me.) It’s a cute song, not really anything that interesting or special. The video replaces “kiss me like you mean it” with “hold me like you mean it”. Also, fun fact: the drummer from DNCE does the drums on this song.

**therokinrolla**: "queen of punk rock. Put paramore out of business. /u/look_a_fangirl’s faves? Over. In all seriousness somehow demi manages to avoid the cheesy and stereotypical sound that songs like this from children’s shows can sometimes has. It bops, and the hook leaves me dead"

**dropthehammer11**: "rock on my dudes"

**twat_brained**: "This was a **SENSATIONAL** first single released by Demi! It perfectly straddles the line between being an all-out pop rock while also being kid-friendly as well. Great tune overall!"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I didn’t understand why people complain about Demi screaming rather than singing until I heard this song."

**seferre2**: "there's like 6 other songs in this rate that sound like this"

**Lexarqade**: "Man I'm not a Demi stan but her early stuff is SO typically disney it's insufferable. She also sounds really off-key in the beginning of this song, and the screaming in the bridge is also awful."

**SkyBlade79**: "demi, baby, this is not cute"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "this video reminded me how great Demi's glow-up was"

**huntyphobic**: "queen of screaming, Christina whom?"

http://i.imgur.com/juKGgGF.gif THIS DESERVED TO GO TOP TEN! This bop containing elements of Indian music is upon Hilary’s best works. She wrote the song about the strained relationship between her parents after her dad had an affair. The video showed a much more mature and brunette Hilary who belly dances and grinds.

---

# A CLASSIC

**NapsAndNetflix**: "[imagine being this talented](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65mLXdQhIOw)"

**fifthchevron**: "A legitimate bop, with a great video and lyrics. I like how she's realised something is wrong with her relationship but his gaslighting and unexpected neglect from her social circle has her completely lost. What do you do when a bad person's tricks not only fooled you, but everyone else as well?"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Hilary is coming for blood, at least somewhat convincingly so. The chorus and verses are aight, but I like the beat."

**TragicKingdom1**: "The vaguely exotic vibe kind of threw me off but it comes together."

**calltehshots**: "Possibly Hilegend's best song out of a billion bops!! Also invented CHOREO."

**bluehxrizon**: "ahead of its time" (:marge:)

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Not a glorious lesbian bop like Halsey's, but pretty catchy."

The first verse and its delivery is so amazing to me, and I don’t know why! The song is just a sweet, easy listen. The song was released as a single from the reissue of the duo’s debut album, and it was [remixed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nMnaNjUUteU) for the duo’s second album. I personally like the remix more as I feel that it’s more polished.

---

**dirdbub**: ""this sounds like it came from the Christian radio station" -my friend Daniel" (aly & aj did send their songs to christian radio)

**huntyphobic**: "I first heard this song on a playlist made by a Legend of Korra fan, for when the show ended at the end of 2014. So this song really takes me back to when I had rly greasy hair and terrible social skills." (relatable)

# TALENT

**gannade**: "bop but i had to subtract some points because it reminds me of the time i almost failed chemistry"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "invented science. Chemist queens."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "literally invented chemistry, we can thank these girls for science"

**tevinterimperium**: "I love Aj's raspy vocals"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "a bop"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "If I was a girl I would've vibed with this shit so hard when it dropped. As it stands, it's a strong pop song, but there are messy moments where the vocals coming in are mixed a little too loud. Minor issue though."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "More than any other song in this rate I find this one to be “anthemic.” It’s built to be shouted along to."

**therokinrolla**: "its kinda a half bop. Half the chorus snatches my wig and the other half gently places it back on. How kind."

**JMez2612**: "It sounds really dated, but it's really catchy"

**lady_sable**: "I am snatched"

**homuraakemi5**: "phil of the future for life"

**jamesfog**: "Another amazing song from the queens of pop rock"

**ImADudeDuh**: "the remix is not as good as the original"

**rickikardashian**: "The lyrics are really nice and well thought out, which sometimes doesn’t really happen with commercial songs, it’s also very catchy."

**kappyko**: "definitely a step up! regular pop rock but very emotional performance from the sisters, catchy and cute. a good bridge, too"

**dropthehammer11**: "Wow look at then shredding those chords. invented rock"

**twat_brained**: "BILL NYE HAS BEEN SLAIN BY THE QUEENS OF MID-00S POP ROCK! The song kinda loses momentum near the end for me, though. Still a banger!"

**superr_rad**: "the science metaphors are brilliant, this song is a classic, white girl pop will never outpeak this"

**eklxtreme**: "I'm getting chill 2000s vibes from this and I love it"

**musicotic**: "Wow even though I've never heard this, the style gives me nostalgia. Can pop girls go back to this style?"

# YAWN

**seferre2**: "literally sounds exactly the same as rush"

**timothy444**: "remix: a version of a musical recording produced by remixing. Unfortunately, this song somehow didn't get the definition of such word. I fear to hear how the original actually sounded like. Probably exactly the same LMAO."

**Lexarqade**: "Biology queens. This and Rush kinda remind me of a mid-career Kelly Clarkson reject with less powerful vocals."

I made a [Big Miss Steak](https://ih0.redbubble.net/image.208332886.3385/flat,800x800,075,f.u1.jpg) including this in the rate because it was never actually released as a single. It just happened to chart well & get one of Demi’s best music videos. My apologies, everyone. “Don’t Forget” is one of my absolute favorite songs of hers because of that guitar solo and because it’s one of her best vocal performances.

---

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Demi? Demi who hurt you? Tell me and I’ll find them. I’ll kill them without hesitation. I’ll break their legs and throw them at your feet and force them to apologize. Demi I’ll walk through the rain with you looking sad. Demi if you’re reading this, message me you can come to my house and we’ll eat ice cream and complain about men and just kind of heal together. That quiet piano ending portion brought real life actual tears to my eyes, not even joking. This is that type of breakup song that melts me to my core, a song that’s not afraid to be doting and pathetic. There’s just so much right about this song. The lyrics. Demi’s emotional immaculate vocal performance. Those quiet, pathetic repeat of “did you forget/do you regret” in first verse. The way that the chorus clearly means something different to her every time she sings it. The way that the quiet, reflective verses don’t give way to the chorus, they give way to that angsty guitar break which gives way to Demi belting the chorus only to melt back into the quiet. The music box feeling of the final chorus. That touch of radio static at the end. This is a song that takes a journey, it’s not a one note piece about missing an ex she’s going through stages here, she’s expressing anger, nostalgia, sadness, betrayal, even a hint of guilt, and in the heartbreakingly appropriate ending, she reaches a resolution that isn’t necessarily a happy one. This is a beautiful torch song, I can’t believe that she was 15 when she wrote and performed this. Am I just a sucker for a good breakup jam due to my personal history and what may or may not be a gaping void in my heart? Absolutely. But this is still lovely. I wasn’t sure going into the rate what my 11 would be and I think this is it."

# DELETE THE SUB

# CAN’T FORGET

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of not forgetting. elephants are shook."

**Nfranklin50**: "Will Demi ever top this masterpiece?"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "makes me cry and headbang every time"

**fifthchevron**: "I don't remember how I discovered this back in the day but I've loved it ever since. She sounds genuinely heartbroken and then distraught for the rock portion. The lyric "We were just about to fall even more in love" is revealing, like she had a totally different idea of what they were. You get the idea he's completely purged her from his life already and she's blindsided. This is how you SELL the story within a song."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Really airy song, but probably not in the best way. I'm kinda just waiting for things to happen here, but at least when stuff happens it's really satisfying."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Technically this wasn't a single but it speaks to the strength of the song that this did relatively well on the Hot 100 regardless. Interesting musically with how it plays around with the intensity of the instruments and vocals, plus it has a really subtle, but good melody."

**calltehshots**: "omg @ this taking me there. An emotional bop."

**dirdbub**: "ok that's a fucken buildup"

**therokinrolla**: "this is sooooo good. When it finally explodes at the end i get shook. Also that mcdonalds ad."

**chili_jones**: "lmao the echoing crying voice."

**JMez2612**: "The chorus was iconic, pop-rock legend"

**lady_sable**: "I wasn't going to give this such a high score at first, but then the last minute kicked in and wow. That last chorus is so sad :("

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "The good sis gives us vocals and emotions. When will your fave ever?"

**jamesfog**: "The big rock chorus snatches me every time and her vocals are great!"

**rickikardashian**: "I used to write “don’t forget” on the sand every time i went to the beach, lmao i was like 7 i barely knew english"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "ALL THE FEELS"

**SimplyHaunted**: "THIS BALLAD, MAN. Ugh, I'd kill to have even half the vocal talent and power that she had at this age."

**dropthehammer11**: "for some reason whenever I hear lovato I think of avacados"

**twat_brained**: "I love how quiet the song starts before it gets punkier at the end. Just like "Lovebug" :D"

**superr_rad**: "ooozing with emo, this is probably one of her best songs. always overlooked by her recent stuff, this has such an insane build up, and "our love is like a song, you cant forget it" is a hella good line."

**eklxtreme**: "kinds mellow and sweet"

**musicotic**: "Loud bop"

# I’D RATHER FORGET

**Cryomatic**: "The vocals are good, the second chorus feels great, and the writing is decent - but there's a whole unnecessary extra minute of buildup here. After all that buildup, the climax feels somewhat anticlimactic, and the fact that it lasts a whole 32 seconds before going back into another whole minute of sad violins and quiet, shaky vocals makes this track feel somewhat unfinished."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is too soft and uninteresting to be a good Demi song."

**timothy444**: "Whoops already did lol"

**Lexarqade**: "I'll tolerate it. "Our Love is like a song" ended Selena. Man this early stuff was just constant belting wasn't it?"

**SkyBlade79**: "This production is literally trash"

**ImADudeDuh**: "kinda boring :/"

**Charts:** [US: 8] [US Pop: 16] [UK: 13] [CAN: 6] [AUS: 14] // **Release Date:** May 14, 2010

**Written by** Miley Cyrus, Rock Mafia

**Produced by** Rock Mafia

**Video directed by** Robert Hales

That video!! Miley dressing up as a bird and doing choreo, that beautiful corset, the peacock feathers… I just love the music video so much. I remember buying the song, the video, and the album on iTunes and just absolutely loving everything about Miley. The music video was highly controversial when it was released because Miley was still on *Hannah Montana* at the time. In Miley’s debut single “See You Again” she says “I have a heart that will never be tamed” - foreshadowing perhaps?

---

**ImADudeDuh**: "Ok I told this story on the plug before, but I'm telling it again. I remember being a young ~12 year old boy on the internet (before it ruined me). One day, I saw an article on the internet that said people were shocked about "Miley's Racy New Video!" and I was very shocked. Miley? Really? So I watched the whole video with Miley in the cage and as a bird and at the end I just sat and thought to myself "Wait, what was racist about that?" I took me until like sophomore year in high school to learn that "racy" and "racist" were 2 different things."

# TAAAMED

**tevinterimperium**: ""I go through guys like money flying out the hands." describes my freshman year of college."

**calltehshots**: "brb getting "i go through guys like money flying out their hands" as a tramp stamp."

**dirdbub**: "classic bop"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "It’s like “Rumors” lost its nuance and instead was just about wanting to be trashy. The music video freaked me out as a kid and that’s the best thing I can say for it."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The Britney aesthetic she's going for is...cute, I guess"

**fifthchevron**: "Still has that corny try-hard feel to it but "I wanna fly, I wanna drive, I wanna go, I wanna be a part of something I don't know" is a fantastic lyric, so is "I'm like a puzzle but all of my pieces are jagged". I like any song that rejects the idea that young women shouldn't party and experiment."

**lady_sable**: "Iconic, Miley really did that"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "iconic af video and THIS WHOLE ERA DESERVED BETTER"

**SimplyHaunted**: "I still remember that $25,000 corset she wore from the music video because she's I C O N I C."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I love Lady Gaga! :janet:"

**VodkaInsipido**: "DNA? Kendrick did better."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "The music video is iconic, but sometimes, I can’t help but feel like the execution is a bit messy."

**eklxtreme**: "the production on this is really cool and new for her"

**musicotic**: "Sufficient"

# SCANDALOUS

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I would be like wow this is her lowpoint but then bangerz and dead petz happened so"

**awhile2**: "lol miley was never the same after this song"

**poppinmmolly**: "remember when everyone was shook by this."

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "remember when everyone thought THIS was scandalous for miley"

**mokitsu**: "this was so shocking back in the day but it still remains a massive bop"

**seferre2**: "wow she is so out of control"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Bad Girl Miley's first appearance. And it is truly iconic."

**Lexarqade**: "Another iconic Miley moment where suburban white moms frothed at the mouth as they couldn't handle anything more than sugar sweet Disney."

**jamesfog**: "the song that made Miley a sex icon"

**SkyBlade79**: "This was totally the song that started her transition into the Bangerz era."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "edgy"

**kappyko**: "i remember when this came out people were like "MILEY'S HAVING HER BAD GIRL PHASE". WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS COMING TO US (what was coming was actually good bops. this song kinda blows)"

**dropthehammer11**: "I think Im on a watchlist after watching this music vid"

**twat_brained**: "Remember when we thought THIS was considered risqué for Miley? Oh, how innocent and naïve we were. As for the song… it hasn't aged well, nor does it deserve to be a title track."

# TRY AGAIN, MILEY

**TragicKingdom1**: "lol at Miley thinking this would be taken seriously. But it has a ton of hooks and I LIVE for those oily synths"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I remember really not liking this when it came out and I still don't like it."

**therokinrolla**: "this really is just bad miley. Its bad. If anything your songwriting and production needed to be tamed here. Cause this is a mess. Sorry, luv"

**chili_jones**: "i h8 everything bout this"

**Video directed by** Bille Woodruff

---
This song was [originally recorded by British girl group Sugababes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g418b7nfuyU). The original version hit #1 in several countries including the UK, Germany, and Poland. It was reworked by Max Martin and The Matrix for Miranda’s debut EP. The music video featured Mexican actor Diego Boneta (aka Pete from *Scream Queens*).

---

# SUGABABES

**agentofscranton**: "some people think this is the original and that sucks because the sugababes version is so much better, an 11 if ever there was one"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I was wondering how she got Max Martin but then I realized she just took someone else's song, whoops" (max martin didn’t work on the original one)

**calltehshots**: "Sugababes are rotting. Music peaked with this song."

**Kaphox**: "Points deducted for ruining the Sugababes song"

**jamesfog**: "Ended the Sugaflops"

**rickikardashian**: "I love it so much. The changes in the lyrics are kind of not necessary, but they aren’t really Kidz bop-y and fit the song well. (The Sugababes still slayed that song tho)"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "sorry but the original was better and i am offended"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "the Sugababes were found dead"

**twat_brained**: "THE SUGABABES LITERALLY ENDED THEIR CAREER ONCE THEY HEARD THIS COVER BC THEY KNEW NOTHING THEY EVER RELEASED COULD BE SO **I C O N I C**"

**superr_rad**: "i never knew this song was a cover but its so catchy!"
 
# MOTHER COSGROVE

**gannade**: "The music video should be the most influential piece of video of our generation and it's a shame it goes mostly unnoticed. Despite the lack of racial diversity in the music video, you can easily tell Miranda and her friends apart because they all have different hair colors or outfits. One of the blondes is wearing a bright yellow shirt while the other is wearer darker clothing. Miranda even has a beanie to set herself further apart. Take notes Hollywood. You can't just introduce 10 different white people in the first 10 minutes of a movie or TV show, dress them all up in boujee clothing, and expect me to know what is going on with the plot when I can barely tell your so-called main characters apart. @Every historical drama ever made, especially those set in the 1800s @West Wing @Mad Men @Every horror movie @Most police procedurals"

**huntyphobic**: "is the guy that plays Miranda’s boyfriend that guy from scream queens? I wonder how he feels knowing that he will never play a role more iconic than Miranda Cosgrove’s boyfriend." (yes it’s diego boneta 😍)

**whatyourheartdesires**: "I've had no idea who sang this before doing this rate"

**Nfranklin50**: "I can't lie this used to be my anthem"

**tevinterimperium**: "Wig fucking flew into the sun."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Miranda Cosgrove may be a meme but her music bopped. I vibed with this as a kid and secretly prayed Miranda Cosgrove would be my girlfriend."

**mokitsu**: "queen of malls, queen of being dumb"

**dirdbub**: "Miranda comeback WHEN"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m kind of a sucker for this kind of teenybopper pop from time to time and I think this plays that up very well. It think that Miranda Cosgrove sells this song very well, her “every girl next door” charm elevates this song above others like it in the rate."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I don't like this song that much but the way Miranda sings it brings me back to sixth grade and makes me feel warm inside so I'll give it a pass"

**therokinrolla**: "i had to think long and hard about whether i wanted to dump the memes or support the memes… well, i supported the memes."

**JMez2612**: "I actually bought this song on iTunes (I know, rare)"

**lady_sable**: "It's a cute little song"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Michael Jackson Miranda truly did that."

**VodkaInsipido**: "surprisingly, not a meme"

**kappyko**: "this actually isnt terrible and this is the last song im rating. p ok"

**dropthehammer11**: "ICONIC"

**awryj**: "I don't know why but I really like this song"

**eklxtreme**: "sweet and infectious chorus and an all around nostalgic, carefree vibe"

We all know the story behind this one, and the song having a story is what makes this song so raw and authetically Demi. Demi went to rehab after dealing with bulimia, bullying, self harm, and a cocaine addiction. It was news all over the world, “another Disney star falls victim to the pressures of Hollywood!” What a triumphant return to music this was. It shot right up to #1 on iTunes the day it was released and became one of Demi’s biggest hits to date. Demi actually recorded this before the whole rehab stint, and she decided to release it as her comeback because of how much the song means to her. Estonian pop star Kerli wrote the song, drawing inspiration from a picture of the apocalypse, and she has said that the song also means a lot to her. This was Demi’s first single to be pushed to mainstream pop radio, and it marked her shift from pop rock to just pop. “Skyscraper” [got praise from many other celebrities](http://www.mtv.com/news/2581252/demi-lovato-skyscraper-twitter-selena-gomez-katy-perry/) including Katy Perry, Kelly Clarkson, and Kim Kardashian. Sam Bailey’s cover of this from *The X Factor UK* went to #1 in the UK and caused the original to hit the top ten there. Demi recorded a Spanish version of this titled “[Rascacielo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mE4D4l3I5RM)”. I got tired of this song after playing it over 1000 times on my iTunes, but it holds a special place in my heart as a fan of Demi and her mental health advocacy.

# STOP MAKING ME CRY, DEMI

**SimplyHaunted**: "This song got me through the hardest time in my life. I literally owe my life to this song. I had to give my 11."

**nikitasd**: "One of the few ballads i like"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: ":,("

**fifthchevron**: "Definitely one of her best songs. IMO the only song on this whole list that isn't commercialised confectionary. She sounds like she's been through hell and like she's about to conquer. There's a lot of clarity in the lyrics. I've been listening to each song on the Spotify playlist and Demi is so far the first vocalist who can actually convey emotion with her voice. It's also interesting to consider how her voice has gotten even better since this song. It gets my 11 for feeling like the only personal and authentic song in this rate."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Another self-empowerment anthem"

**lady_sable**: "One of her best songs, don't @ me"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is beautiful, especially if you know what happened behind the scenes."

**rickikardashian**: "This was the perfect song to come back to after all the shit she had gone through. It’s a beautiful song with amazing vocals. I think this was the first moment Demi showed the world (outside the Disney public) who she was and the star potential she had."

**SkyBlade79**: "So majestic! I adore this song, it’s just so very powerful."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "remember when this came out and tumblr lost its damn mind"

**huntyphobic**: "Demi just snatched my wig 828m into the air. The same height as the world’s tallest skyscraper ‘Burj Khalifa’, which is located in Dubai."

**ImADudeDuh**: "EM O TIONal bop"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented power ballads, being made of paper, and architecture"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Let me just say this that this is one of the best songs from Demi ever. Her vocal delivery in this is so fucking raw and the story behind that song makes this song even more emotional for me as she recorded the song during the darkest time in her life. Apparently after her rehab stay, she re-recorded her vocals but decided to keep the raw vocals and I am so glad Demi kept it. I am very happy to see Demi doing much better these days even tho I don't stan her that much anymore."

**VodkaInsipido**: "It SCREAMS 'I'm from the early 2010's' BUT IT'S SO GOOD IT CAN BE PASSED."

**kappyko**: "actually cute"

**dropthehammer11**: "nice vocals here"

**twat_brained**: "Say what you will about Demi, but even the most anti-Lovatic will recognize that this is Demi's most powerful song and video. Such an encouraging message❤️"

**superr_rad**: "definitely a career defining moment for demi, this came right after her time in rehab. i remember watching the mtv documentary about her and crying so hard, 1 because i loved her and 2 because i was going through very similar stuff. some of it still hasnt gone away, but i cant even put into words how much it meant to me back then to see someone i idolized come out of these issues and thrive. i will always have a special place in my heart for demi, even with her messy tweets and shrieking vocals because she shared her story and gave me hope when i needed it. <3"

**eklxtreme**: "demi's most powerful songwriting"

**musicotic**: "Iconic bop"

# YOU CAN DO BETTER, DEMI

**gannade**: "ughhhh I remember when Demi released this as a lead single and it was really just a wtf moment. The song is SO BORING and what kind of simile is "rising like a skyscraper"???? Those things take like decades and billions of dollars to build, by the time you rise you might as well be dead and in debt."

**Cryomatic**: ""I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.""

**Lexarqade**: "I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep."

**jamesfog**: "Fell victim to overplay"

**letsallpoo**: "i know this song means a lot to demi but it just doesnt click with me :marge: also it reminds me of when britney was on x factor cause they used this song for promo"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "When Demi finally invaded the radio. I never really liked the chorus here, it's delivered awkwardly imo and the rest of the lyrics aren't much special but I like the song regardless."

**calltehshots**: "I've always hated this song. I mean I'm happy Demi got past a lot of her problems but this song is just waaay too cliche."

**dirdbub**: "this is a non-song"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Haters can choke, I am a Demi Lovato fan. But everyone had been hyping this song up and I knew it was Demi’s signature song for a while, but I had never actually listened to it before and now that I am listening to it it’s good but it 100% does not live up to the hype. Her vocals are weirdly raspy and the metaphor of the song is all over the place. Demi has better songs, she really perfected the formula that she started here later with songs like “Lionheart” and “Yes.” It’s still good, it’s just not there yet."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Using skyscrapers as a metaphor for overcoming hardship is a bit weird and...morbidly suggestive, but I appreciate the fact that the song is pretty genuine, if a little bland to people who aren't huge fans of Demi."

**therokinrolla**: "lyrically weak but its still fucking a fucking oml"

**omgcow**: "Melodramatic"

**Hogwartsreject1912**: "TELL NO ONE I GAVE IT A 5 I will get doxxed, manhunted, and crucified." (👀)

# PLEASE READ THIS

**NapsAndNetflix**: "ok so in highschool we had this media production class where you basically dick around and make music videos with friends and like just hangout and then get 100% for trying. So, you're with the same people the whole year so it was me and these two girls and one was my friend and the other was like whatever. So with like a month left in highschool the one girl I wasn't friends with was like "oh by the way I have a really bad eating disorder so I'm leaving school to go to a rehab program see you at grad" and it was like whoa. So, for our final project you do whatever you want so everyone is making like fun superhero movies and stuff and my teacher sits me and my friend down and is like well for your friend you should do a documentary on eating disorders and like didn't give us the option so we're like ok cool. So we made one and used skyscraper as background music like 4 times in it, but it was a real bummer when we watched since no one knew WHY we did a documentary on this since my teacher didn't want to bring attention to the girl so we couldn't be like well we are lowkey forced to do this so it looked like we willingly did it and so when we watched everything as a class it was like bam fun movie, bam fun movie, oh eating disorder documentary, bam fun movie and it just really was not the time for it and skyscraper makes me think of that and how a class of people just think's I love bringing attention to eating disorders at all times"

SimplyHaunted: > Her vocals are weirdly raspy

She was bulimic, so her vocals were really damaged from her purging. She was going to re-record it after she got out of treatment, but decided not to since her voice was weaker. Plus she wanted to keep the emotion that she had while recording it for the first time, when she was literally crying/singing for help.

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: I am just going to say that Demi recorded Skyscrapper during her lowest moments in life. That's probably why her vocals sounded, less energetic? And that makes the song so memorable to me especially in that context of her rehab stay.

=====

SimplyHaunted: From Wikipedia: Initially, Lovato recorded "Skyscraper" in Studio City, Los Angeles in 2010. During recording sessions, Lovato was "doubled over, just in pain." Lovato had never recorded a song that made her that emotional, and according to E! News, while recording, her voice was damaged from purging. At the time, Lovato had not told anyone about her struggles—she describes the song as a "cry for help" for her in that moment. On November 1, 2010, she entered a treatment facility to treat her physical and emotional problems.

After completing her treatment on January 28, 2011, Lovato re-recorded the song, but decided to keep the original recording because she felt that her voice had changed, although noting about her voice was "weaker" when Lovato originally recorded. She said, "There was something in that first try, that first run through of the song that was kind of magical. It was so much emotion in it, and to this day, it’s still really special to me." Lovato called the original take "symbolic" and said that "it was providing a message"

The song is the best kind of sugary bubblegum pop a Disney/Nick act could offer. It’s part pop perfection, part nonsense (“I might die when I forget how to breathe”). I know Miranda is a meme, but she also has some amazing pop potential.

# QUEEN MIRANDA

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of using the letter u instead of the word "you" to be hip and relatable"

**tevinterimperium**: "In a perfect world, this song would have went to #1 on the hot 100."

**calltehshots**: "This is what true love sounds like. It's not true love unless you're first dance at your wedding is to this complete bop."

**dirdbub**: "literally my mood 24/7"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I hated this song as a kid and now I don’t know why, this is a fun song. My 40-something year old technical theatre teacher would play this over the speakers in the shop sometimes when we were working on sets and I was always baffled by the choice, but secretly I liked it."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is one of the best songs I've ever listened to Miranda is more than a meme"

**therokinrolla**: "“i might die when i think how to breathe”. This one, simple lyric ended all your fav songwriters. Taylor? Crying. Lorde? On life support. Lana? Destroyed. Kendrick? In a local bar spending his paycheck on cheap liquor. Julia? Captured by the cast of iCarly. Frank? Suddenly straight again. Cupcakke? Making christian poetry again. Beyonce? Currently serving as a waitress at Applebee’s. Gaga? Crying to aunt Joanne. Paramore? Broken Up. This comment? Over."

**lady_sable**: "This is actually a masterpiece"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This puts a smile on my face every single time."

**jamesfog**: "This song deserved to go #1! Miranda was done so dirty by the GP"

**nikitasd**: ""I might die when i forget how to breathe" A choice"

**MNREDR**: ""I. MIGHT. DIE. ..if I forget how to breathe" right there next to "If the light is off, then it isn't onnnn" on the list of iconic Disney lyrics"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Queen of death! Wednesday Adams is shook!"

**SpanKKy1**: "Queen of forgetting how to breath"

**twat_brained**: "This single doesn't feel as strong as her others. That being said, "I might die when I forget how to breathe" is enough to kill Shakespeare for a 2nd time."

Memes lost! The song came from Max & Avril’s writing sessions for her *Goodbye Lullaby* album. It does stylistically sound a lot like “What the Hell” and “Smile”, the Max Martin cuts from that album.

We all know who Miranda is, from *School of Rock*, from *Drake & Josh*, or from *iCarly*. Yes, she might be a meme, but *Sparks Fly* is a legitimately good album. Every song on that album slaps. Miranda is currently recording music, but it is unknown whether or not she’s still signed with Columbia. She recently reprised her role as Margo on *Despicable Me 3*. She put her career on hold to go to college, and I applaud her for that! Unproblematic, studious legend.

**RANK**:

**Ghost-Quartet**: I watched School of Rock all the time as a kid because my dad loves that movie and I think Miranda Cosgrove could be one of those people who worked better as a child star than as an adult. She’s just staying in her lane and getting that degree, if she keeps going I think she could have good career as a producer and make occasional nostalgic cameos in various mid-profile properties. I’m not gonna lie though, she had some bops.

**patronsaintofaspies**: The only true Carly. Run Away With Me who? You're So Vain who?

“Hit the Lights” was the band’s first flop since their debut single. The song had two music videos, but neither of them helped this song become a hit.  It’s a nice, cute song. I couldn’t believe when I first heard her say “damn”. It was censored on Disney Channel and Radio Disney. Controversial queen!

The song describes paparazzi and their obsession with watching everything Miley does. It’s a very short song that’s lesser known in her singles catalog, and I’m quite surprised that it’s so beloved by the sub.

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Did you know that there’s no specific term for people whose fursonas are insects? We’re really discriminated against in the furry community, but we’re so blessed that Miley wrote us this bop."

# DON’T YA

**awhile2**: "i can make your hands clap"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Does this not sound like Handclap by Fitz & the Tantrums?"

**tevinterimperium**: "An absolute banger"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I remember the music video for this so vividly. Her clothing choices that era were glorious. I didn't like this at first but it grew on me."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Song doesn't really work at all, but everything about the video lmao <3"

**calltehshots**: "Our generation's Thriller."

**dirdbub**: "ok this goes AWF in the club"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The hook of this one is so unique and original and it still manages to be a catchy pop rock banger I'm shook"

**lady_sable**: "She really went there!! She really did that!!"

**SkyBlade79**: "Why does this sound like it should be in Artpop?"

**ImADudeDuh**: "The hook in this song is so good."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Text Mileyworld to 66937 to get a Free Miley Wallpaper for your phone.  MSG& Data rates may apply."

**omgcow**: "I actually loved this song for a brief moment in 7th grade"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "my pussy is twerking"

**kappyko**: "yikes a bit of a drop but the guitars are surprisingly quite nasty (in a good way). the bridge gets an extra .5. look at this tragic art tho https://e.snmc.io/lk/o/l/95fb980e61d6fa1f96c4faf11bd43d70/2440322.jpg"

**dropthehammer11**: "I'm so creepy and sneaky cuz I'm a fly"

**twat_brained**: "That plot twist at the end of the video gets a few extra points from me! That isn't saying much, though; it's still one of Miley's more forgettable singles."

**eklxtreme**: "this is actually much more fun than I remembered. I love how she goes thru different voice pitches"

**musicotic**: "She pulls this style off flawlessly"

# ENTOMOPHOBIA

**PuggleMaster**: "She had a 10 average until this song :sad:"

**therokinrolla**: "the production scared me when it first kicked in… :emofish:"

**chili_jones**: "...no"

**Lexarqade**: "This song is just about when your friends spill the tea without you present. Aside this song does not age well."

The lead single from *Another Cinderella Story*’s soundtrack was [remixed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LHcNwy5eyt4) for the band’s debut album *Kiss & Tell*. I wouldn’t have included this in the rate if it weren't on the album. The Hurricane Katrina reference was censored on the Radio Disney edit. That “how many inches in a mile” line is iconic. The song features a random rapper whose name I can’t find anywhere online.

---

**Cryomatic**: ""I'm never gonna amount to much but I'm never gonna change my mind" big mood selena"

# HOW MANY INCHES IN A MILE

**awhile2**: "this hook is pop perfection"

**calltehshots**: "A masterpiece."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "When I was kid I actually looked up how many inches were in a mile… but I could never figure out how to make her smile."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Selena I'm already relishing in the fact that I'll never have to take another geometry class in my life why are you reminding me that inches and miles and other geometrical measurements exist"

**therokinrolla**: "a fashionable bop. A sassy bop. It goes hard. Except that fucking bridge ugh"

**chili_jones**: "+1 for coming to mind every time i say this phrase"

**JMez2612**: "This song went tf off"

**lady_sable**: "Would be rated higher without that completely unnecessary rap verse. Other than that it's a bop."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "there are 63360 inches in a mile."

**jamesfog**: "Selena's voice is so different in this song holy shit"

**rickikardashian**: "The beginning of my crush on Selena Gomez that to this day hasn’t died"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "I’m rating the Kiss & Tell version :P" 

**SkyBlade79**: "There are about 5280 feet in a mile and 12 inches in a foot, so just multiply 5280 times 12 to get your answer; 63360 inches in a mile."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of wanting to know things she doesn't know, inspiring education across the nation"

**kappyko**: "kind of weak but hey it's cute and catchy!"

**superr_rad**: "another flopperella story was one of my favorites as a youngin, so this is probably rated higher than it deserves"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I wish it had more than the title line and that random rap verse."

**SimplyHaunted**: "Did they really just make a Hurricane Katrina reference? Knocked off a full point for me."

**dropthehammer11**: "this is very catchy but I feel like it's missing something"

**twat_brained**: "I've never actually seen the full video for this up until now. That being said, it's nothing particularly memorable, just like this song. Also, not sure why the music in the video vs Spotify sound different, but I prefer the rockier music from the video."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Ugh. I am just glad Selena is making good bops now like Fetish and Bad Liar and not.........this trash."

# idk if this is an insult or a compliment but i want to assume it’s a compliment because i love fetish (feat. gucci mane) out now on itunes

**timothy444**: "Selena... I'll tell you something I don't know: how you managed to get from this song to Fetish??? Just how."

This was the first Sabrina song that really made me interested in her music. Her first album was cute, but this went beyond the level of "Disney artist". Unfortunately, the song didn't chart anywhere, it wasn't promoted, and it was given a very low-budget video. The instrumental of this song is phenomenal especially during the chorus. I love love **LOVE** the instrumental. I love how it starts off slow and quiet only backed by a piano, then it just absolutely explodes on the chorus. I'm so glad to see that "On Purpose" made it this far into the rate.

**FishM8**: "LOST IN DARKNESS YOU'RE MY FOCUS"

# LOVE ME HOPELESS

**bluehxrizon**: "a main pop-girl level song"

**nikitasd**: "This chorus is pop perfection"

**rickikardashian**: "This little bitch is out here saving Disney music and I wasn’t aware of her until now? I’m loving her music so much. It’s very fun and young, and she’s overall what a Disney star should be like, I could see her having a good future in the music industry"

**awhile2**: "she sounds like shes having an asthma attack on the hook but its still a bop"

**fifthchevron**: "This is decent, could be a Gwen Stefani song."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is a dancey bop, why isn't this on the radio? Someone fix that."

**dirdbub**: "okay WOW this song did #that"

**MNREDR**: "This song caught me off guard with how great it is. The production lets the soft rasp of Sabrina's voice shine in the verses. Unfortunately the chorus is a bit of a letdown."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m not sold on her vocals here, I think she has a ways to go as a singer, but I do like the song. It get why it was a single but it’s honestly not one of the highlights of the album. (This is my way of saying that you should listen to the album.)"

Probably would’ve been better suited for someone with better vocals, but this is still a great song. The eurodance production is ethereal. Also, this apparently wasn’t sent to pop radio. Gotta love Hollywood Records, I guess.

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Selena was clearly wet af"

**Lexarqade**: "She is serving VOCALS here."

**jamesfog**: "The autotune on this entire song is.... If her vocals were better it would be a 10"

**rickikardashian**: "Honestly, this could be released today with a slightly different instrumental ~~and someone that can actually do high notes~~ and it could be a 1# song."

**SkyBlade79**: "One of Selena’s best songs ever."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "so whimsical and beautiful"

**huntyphobic**: "I honestly only just discovered that there was an English version of this song bc my brother would always play the Spanish version for some reason lmao."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "definitely my favorite song off of this album and from the year 2010. I was so obsessed with this back then I even learned how to sing the Spanish Language version lmao and the music video is iconic, too. when will ur fave come out of a car suddenly in a different dress in the middle of the desert just to pick up a photo? Also does anyone know who Selena’s love interest in this video is? I need it for science too thanks!" ([his name is niko pepaj](https://www.instagram.com/nikopepajla/?hl=en))

**awryj**: "There's something incredibly soothing about this song, even though it sounds kinda wonky sometimes. Also, it reminds me a lot of Pure Intuition by Shakira and that song is probably one of my favorites by her so yeah, here goes my 11"

**superr_rad**: "i think this could be my fave selena song, its so atmospheric and the house influences get me going. she also looks incredible in the video but when does she not tbh"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Not particularly catchy, not particularly anything."

This song is an emotional experience. It was one of the first songs I had ever fallen in love with. Every time it rains I just think of the video for this song. I love this song more than I love myself honestly. It’s an amazing song and a fond memory from my childhood. I lose a clump of hair every time she says “Let the rain fall”. In this song, Hilary comes clean to her significant other and wishes for a fresh start.

# LET THE RAIN FALL

**Nfranklin50**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xqocoEp3Bi4"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "if I could chose one thing to watch before I died it would be the video for this"

**fifthchevron**: "There's nothing to hate about this. The quiet "let the rain fall..." bridge brings some unexpected emotion and reflection."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I love the instrumental here. That background guitar riff feels really indie rock and and the chorus is really dope. I wish her voice was stronger but I don't know how much she can actually give."

**calltehshots**: "Listen to this when your shedding your every color and trying to find a pigment of truth beneath your skin."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "“I’m coming” bitch SAME. An iconic and legendary song… Literally one of the most romantic moments ever captured on film was that scene at the end of A Cinderella Story where the guy abandons the big football game to run up into the stands and kiss Hilary Duff, and the power of their love literally ends the drought. Hilary Duff is an actual goddess of the rain. The reason that California is turning into a desert is because we have forsaken her and not allowed her to be a continued chart presence."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Clean?! Taylor stole from Hillary. I knew she was a Trump supporter..."

**therokinrolla**: "does this song have any rhymes? But it kinda bops so i am giving it points for that"

**chili_jones**: "i can't even rate this w/out being biased this is my childhood shit"

**lady_sable**: "Super catchy, and very 2000s sonically. A bop."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Invented Rain."

**timothy444**: "Heard this on SongPop and didn't know it was by Hilary Duff. Anyway, I looked it up on the Spotify and it's a real banger. I hope this places high in the rate."

**Lexarqade**: "I'll be very surprised if this isn't top 5. It's ALMOST perfect for me but it feels like something's missing. I think I remembered it having a bit more punch to it."

**jamesfog**: "Let the rain fall.. I'm CUMMING"

**rickikardashian**: "I honestly have no clue what this song has, but it’s so fresh and cute that it stands out from the other happy songs she has. This is the song I think of when people talk about old school Hilary"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "tbh this song aged terribly for me but that nostalgia"

**huntyphobic**: "cleansed all of my sins, wew wig!"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Me_IRL"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "**I'M SHITTING, SHITTING EVERY COLOR**"

**omgcow**: "This song is a healing experience."

**dropthehammer11**: "okay that was good"

**twat_brained**: "This is pop perfection and has every right to win the rate. Catch the tea on THAT."

**superr_rad**: "i still bop to this monthly. the hook of this is killer to this day, i dont think anyone can deny its boppery"

**eklxtreme**: "childhood memories come rushing back like a flood :'( it's such a happy and uplifting song and she's so young here aaaaah"

**musicotic**: "Another certified bop"

# hmm

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "not her best"

**SkyBlade79**: "Trash. Nothing interesting about it at all and the lyrics are for 5 year olds. This is the worst type of pop. Most of the Hilary Duff songs on this rate are so forgettable that I’m not going to even waste time writing separate comments. This is what people think of when you say the "music industry", as in a machine pumping out the exact same, inoffensive thing just because it "worked" in the past. this gives pop a bad name. This is the musical equivalent of the emoji movie."

**kappyko**: "what's with the weird build up into what's easily the most neutered pop rock chorus of all time? i'm giving this my 0, maybe not because it's the worst song in the rate, but it's easily the one song i have no emotions towards giving a 0. hell, i feel a little bad giving even that country jennette mccurdy song a 0. but this is bad, and everybody else is hearing something i'm not. and i wanna be a part of something. :("

Queen of Disney Hilary Duff started Disney’s influence on the music industry. After her major label debut album *Metamorphosis* hit #1 on the Billboard 200, Disney started signing their actresses to Hollywood Records. Her music wasn’t that huge, but it set a precedent for years to come. After her beloved 2007 record *Dignity* Hilary took time off her music career to focus on acting. She was facing a lot of hate throughout her time with Hollywood Records because we all know that everyone loves to hate on teen pop stars. She can’t sing! She’s a slut! yada yada yada the usual abuse people and media spew towards young, successful women… she came back strong and healthy in 2015 with the phenomenal *Breathe In. Breathe Out.* (which I think everyone should check out because it's full of bops!) Hilary is currently starring on TV Land’s *Younger*. I think Hilary suffered in this rate by not really being guarded by nostalgia. Anyone who didn’t witness the Duff domination of the 2000’s reasonably would not care for her earlier singles. I’m sure if I included the Breathe In. Breathe Out. singles, “[All About You](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dA1ZmHibs4w)” and “[Sparks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dpPXpHx9jO4)” would’ve performed very well. Hilary was the top 2 on the same rate on atrl… the turntables… https://media.giphy.com/media/UiuOMYkRxG836/giphy.gif

**RANK**:

* #18 - Come Clean - 7.824

**dirdbub**: I don't remember what any of these sound like

**Ghost-Quartet**: Actual real life queen. Buy Breathe In Breath Out. Watch her tv show Younger. Use Tinder.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I barely knew anything about Hillary before this rate, and now I'm actually shook. I really enjoyed listening to her music! While her songs obviously inspired by Britney and Christina, but they still seem to express her actual personality and artistry, despite the fact that they're mostly standard (though unusually enjoyable) 2000s pop. Also, I really like her voice. What a legend. Should have won the election.

**jamesfog**: The ultimate queen of Disney, an ACTRESS, a SINGER, a MODEL, a DANCER.. she's a tour de force! Dignity is one of the best albums of the 2000's

**twat_brained**: I stanned this bitch before I knew what stanning was; homegirl was the first concert I ever went to.

This is a song that is so classically Demi and one that shows all the best aspects of her, even at such a young age. The cute “I don’t give a fuck” attitude that persists in her current single “Sorry Not Sorry”, the edge and power of her voice, and the pop rock production that complements Demi’s voice so well all make this song a standout in Demi’s discography despite not having much commercial success. The last 20 seconds of this song are just epic! The music video features Demi’s co-stars from *Sonny with a Chance*.

**MNREDR**: "Demi shouted her way into my heart with this song 9 years ago and it's still one of my favorites."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "So, Demi Lovato, you say that you won’t let the “La La Land” machine change you? You’re gonna keep wearing your Converse with your dress? [Explain this you fake beyotch.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7C2XjZ1bSYM)"

**FishM8**: "The first song by a Disney Channel star that I absolutely loved. I remember getting hyped every time the music video came on when I was watching TV."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A VOCALIST. An instantly iconic number. Queen of attacking the industry."

**Lexarqade**: ""I'm not a supermodel/I still eat McDonalds" iconic line tbh. This is very 2007-esque "Yes I wear Converse to prom" teen angst personified. She must look at the vocal runs she did in this song with absolute shame. Queen of rhyming "same" with "machine.""

**jamesfog**: "A masterpiece! A tour de force! A magnum opus! Demi did that! MACHIIIIIIIIIIIINE"

Is this song Kelly Clarkson-lite? Yes. Is it an absolute fucking banger? Also yes. It’s unfortunate the album of the same title only got 2 singles because there were so many gems in the album that deserved to shine. If you liked this song and/or Demi’s pop rock sound, I recommend checking out her (Billboard #1) *Here We Go Again* album.

---

**Ghost-Quartet**: "[All I can think of is this iconic cover.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MP3xqap9JMM)"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I keep getting reminded of that Fifth Harmony video and I can't stop laughing."

**SpanKKy1**: "Camila did it better"

# POP ROCK DEMI LOVERS

**MNREDR**: "Impossible to not dramatically lip sync and headbang along when you listen to this. It might be a teen pop ripoff of Since U Been Gone but it absolutely holds its own and Demi's incredible voice and energy are to thank for this song's charisma. One of her best songs, no doubt."

**Nfranklin50**: "I really miss this Demi and this absolute perfection"

**poppinmmolly**: "what a bop!!!"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Serving pop rock teas. It's not a revolutionary song or anything but I like it."

**TragicKingdom1**: "I think this one of the catchiest songs ever. Plus, it really ramps up the intensity of her pop/rock sound to a level that I think works really well."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This song's the ultimate proof that Demi's voice is pretty much at full potential when she does pop rock bangers. HOW DID YOU GET HERE UNDER MY SKIN"

**therokinrolla**: "the one song i dont remember from demi left my scalp ripped"

**lady_sable**: "I always forget how many good songs Demi's first two albums had."

**Lexarqade**: "What I say every time I listen to new Demi tbh"

**jamesfog**: "A top 20 smash hit"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of going again, lines at the amusement park are shook"

**kappyko**: "another cute mid-2000s style pop rock thing!!!!"

**twat_brained**: "Holy fuck this made 11-year-old me feel so angsty and I loved it! I can't state enough how much I miss this Demi"

**superr_rad**: "now demi you know this was kinda ripped from kelly, but ill let it slide, cause this is such a fun song."

**eklxtreme**: "great powerhouse vocals on this pop-rock tune"

**musicotic**: "It is a forgettable bop" 

# HERE WE GO AGAIN (with the pop rock)
