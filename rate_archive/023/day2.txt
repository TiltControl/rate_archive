The only single from *The Lizzie McGuire Movie* was tacked onto the end of Hilary‚Äôs multi-platinum debut album *Metamorphosis*. It‚Äôs cute, and it feels like a quintessential Disney Channel song. The song had three versions: the original from the movie, one with slightly different lyrics on *Metamorphosis*, and a remixed version on Hilary‚Äôs first compilation album. This is also the oldest song on the rate, the song that quite literally started it all!

---

### Wynaut

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I'm screaming this is so early 00s and I love it. Wynaut who?" (i nicknamed my wynaut from the old lady by the lavaridge hot springs hilary when i was little, hilegend's impact i guess)

**NapsAndNetflix**: "ok so this song is a classic and michelle branch wouldn't know good lyrics if they hit her in the face I guess she must always dress in yellow without the option of gold crossing her mind since she's basic af"

**tevinterimperium**: "This song gives me anxiety. I still like it though"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I completely forgot Hilary Duff existed. This song is cool."

**calltehshots**: "Oh my god this song changed my LIFE in middle school. "You always dress in yellow when you wanna dress in gold" Yes Hilary, drag me!!!"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "‚ÄúYou‚Äôll never get to heaven, or even to LA‚Äù That‚Äôs how you write LYRICS people! I found the sheet music for this song at a used book store and paid actual real life money for it. I don‚Äôt even know how to play piano. Perhaps it was a waste of money, but why not?"

**chili_jones**: "i cant believe hilary duff invented taking chances"

**lady_sable**: "This is cute"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Invented living life and going for it‚Ñ¢"

**Lexarqade**: "One of the most iconic Disney choruses ever. An absolute perfect bop."

**jamesfog**: "Why Not tug on my wig a lil more Hilary?"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of taking chances and doing crazy dances!"

**omgcow**: "The Lizzie McGuire movie is a cinematic triumph and its soundtrack is legendary"

**berober04**: "Two of those points are entirely for the violins in the song"

**twat_brained**: "Not sure why the first verses on Spotify and the video have different lyrics, but looking back on it‚Ä¶ this is pretty fun to listen to :)"

**superr_rad**: "YAAAASS QUEEN OF GETTING YOU TO DO STUFF YOU PROBABLY WOULDNT"

**eklxtreme**: "I love the fun silly lyrics. it's a great pop-rock tune."

# Why?

**whatyourheartdesires**: "who always dresses in yellow???"

**poppinmmolly**: "I thought this would fill me with nostalgia but it doesn't hold up."

**fifthchevron**: "I was like 13 when this was released and I felt too old for it even then"

**mokitsu**: "the soft rock intrumentation and the background vocals scream DATED and it's unpleasant to listen to tbh"

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

**therokinrolla**: "oh my god can you just fucking kill me"

**JMez2612**: "Honestly all of her songs sound the same tbh"

**SkyBlade79**: "Trash. Nothing interesting about it at all and the lyrics are for 5 year olds. This is the worst type of pop. Most of the Hilary Duff songs on this rate are so forgettable that I‚Äôm not going to even waste time writing separate comments. This is what people think of when you say the "music industry", as in a machine pumping out the exact same, inoffensive thing just because it "worked" in the past. this gives pop a bad name. This is the musical equivalent of the emoji movie. The people who made this song literally just said ‚Äúwhy not?‚Äù and slapped it together."

**kappyko**: "This is a bad song. Why?"

**dropthehammer11**: "I feel like every one of these music videos are the same"

**awryj**: "Her voice is annoying, the song is annoying"

**musicotic**: "Epitome of cringy"

**Release Date:** January 25, 2017

**Written by** Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels, Stargate, Alan Walker

**Produced by** Alan Walker

**Video directed by** Emil Nava

---
This song was written by the famous duo Justin Tranter & Julia Michaels and produced by Norwegian DJ Alan Walker. The laser filled video was directed by Emil Nava (who also did Calvin Harris‚Äô ‚ÄúFeels‚Äù). I agree that the drop isn‚Äôt one of Alan Walker‚Äôs best efforts. Love the rest of the song though.

---

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "okay but is she trying to say I'm not beautiful?"

# BEAUTIFUL

**PuggleMaster**: "I'M SHOOK I DIDN'T EXPECT HA TO TAKE ME THERE"

**fifthchevron**: "This was nice, definitely the kind of vocal I like."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Serious kiiara vibes but I like this."

**calltehshots**: "The Chainsmokers are shivering."

**MNREDR**: "Some of the best production in this entire playlist."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Her vocals here are legit beautiful I'm shaking"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Whew! This is an amazing drop. Kiiara is SHOOK"

**Lexarqade**: "She has a serious case of indie girl voice. Kind of reminds me of an AlunaGeorge song."

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "her voice, her looks, the visuals for this song is giving me Camila vibes"

**kappyko**: "whom the fuck is Alan Wal- omg wait this is good"

**dropthehammer11**: "okay this bangs, I didnt know Camila had a new song"

**superr_rad**: "definitely one of the more fresh productions on this list, im surprised at how much i like this"

**eklxtreme**: "Alan walker has some cool production on this but I find that to be the best part of this"

**musicotic**: "Wow EDM from a Disney artist?"

# TWINS AGAIN

**gannade**: "Why was this no name trash included in the rate but not The Cheetah Girls or KeKe Palmer??"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "imagine if the cheetah girls sang this"

# DAMMIT ALAN

**SkyBlade79**: "lmao isn‚Äôt this that Fade guy"

**Leixander**: "vomits neon lights"

**therokinrolla**: "ENDED BEYONCE AND FLAWLESS. Jk this is not goodTM"

**jamesfog**: "I wish the chorus went off a little harder and it sounds better at 1.25x speed, but slay"

**TragicKingdom1**: "I already thought that Alan Walker was the most generic of this new wave of EDM producers that get minor hits on Spotify and the UK charts, and this song did nothing to sway my opinion."

**timothy444**: "Sorry Alan Walker but you really let me down here. It felt like you were more of a wannabe David Guetta than your own self."

**dirdbub**: "Alan please stick to house"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I actually liked this song up until that completely unnecessary drop happened and ruined it."

**lady_sable**: "Eh...she has a good voice, but it feels kinda generic tbh"

**rickikardashian**: "Ugh, the verses are cute but the electro-chorus doesn‚Äôt fit with it at all"

**SkyBlade79**: "lmao isn‚Äôt this that Fade guy"

**huntyphobic**: "this sounds like the chainsmokers produced this, how tragic tbh."

**ImADudeDuh**: "this lowkey sounds like faded to me until the drop"

**twat_brained**: "This song actually portrays and conveys such a powerful and truthful message in today's world. It's a shame it's somewhat undone by the beat drop, though."

**Overall average**: 6.791 **// Total points:** 543.3 **// [Averages](https://pastebin.com/2t7LNv9h)**

---

So I‚Äôm guessing that basically no one in this sub watched Disney‚Äôs *Descendants*. I think anyone who enjoyed HSM 1 and 2 would enjoy Descendants and the superior Descendants 2 because they all had the same director & choreographer (Kenny Ortega). Sofia plays the Evil Queen‚Äôs daughter Evie in the *Descendants* films. She is working with a lot of big name writers & producers, and Republic Records seems to be pretty set on making her the next big ex-act. Hopefully she releases her album someday.

**RANK**:

- #54 - Back to Beautiful ft. Alan Walker - 6.804
- #57 - Love Is the Name - 6.779

---
**Ghost-Quartet**: I didn‚Äôt know anything about this girl so I looked her up and she seems like a more tasteful version of Camila Cabello. Neither of her songs in the rate particularly wowed me but if she drops an album maybe I‚Äôll give it a listen.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I don't want to watch or listen to anything Descendants related but I want to hear more music from her kill me inside

**Hogwartsreject1912**: No offense but... who even?

**jamesfog**: She's like a prettier, more talented Camila Cabello

The music video originally premiered on MySpace. It‚Äôs actually a pretty cool music video that features lights moving around a glowing Emily Osment.

# TURN IT UP

**gannade**: "This song has the best lyricism in this entire rate. I love how the entire song is a metaphor for music and sound itself. "Go get me that sensory overload" is one of the best lyrics of all time. Also, the music video is beautiful with its neon colors and really fits the vibe of the song. Kesha tried it with her your love is a drug music video but she has nothing on emily."

**awhile2**: "i think this song needs more music metaphors"

**Lexarqade**: "How many audio references are even in this song? At any rate this song just has too many dissonant elements to be manageable."

**fifthchevron**: "It would be really hard to remember the order of all the words in this song lol. Points for being weirdly unique."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is a product of its times and that's okay. It's manufactured as all hell but it bops, and I guess that's what I like about it. The synths are artpop level dated though."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Unpolished but kind of works anyways."

**calltehshots**: "Invented electropop."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "It‚Äôs like if ‚ÄúBad Romance‚Äù had been a chip tunes song written for ARTPOP, produced on a vocal looper. I say that in the BEST way possible, this is a bop. After hearing this as part of the playlist I had it marked as an 8 but I found it stuck in my head the next day so I looked up the video and I bumped it up to a 10 after a few listens. I actually really like this, it‚Äôs so catchy and it‚Äôs so much fun. Also my favorite music video in the rate. It didn‚Äôt quite get my 11 but I think it‚Äôs worth mentioning that it gave my 11 a run for its money."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This song gave me sensory overload"

**chili_jones**: "THIS SONG IS EMILY OSMENT...? bops tbh..."

**lady_sable**: "This is really catchy I like it"

**seferre2**: "this is the most manufactured voice to ever be made, also the bridge is neat"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This gets my gay seal of approval."

**jamesfog**: "Electronic banger! Criminally underrated song and iconic, groundbreaking music video. Unfortunately this song will be done so dirty in the rate"

**SkyBlade79**: "lovesick by banks is better but this bops"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "miley's discography is thoroughly shook"

**twat_brained**: "This feels so maximalist and in-your-face, especially the video, and it‚Ä¶ actually kinda‚Ä¶ works?? I can see this maybe in the top 20 but DEFINITELY in the top 30." (sorry)

**eklxtreme**: "an upbeat 8-bit synthpop club tune"

**musicotic**: "OK, this is a certified bop! Who is this chick, she's amazing"

# TURN IT OFF

**poppinmmolly**: "wow not good"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "again, ew"

**dirdbub**: "my mind immediately connected that this song sounds like a weird mix of Kyary Pamyu Pamyu's "PONPONPON" and Avril Lavigne's "Hello Kitty" minus all the weeb but now that I'm listening to the two songs I listed I don't really know how I made that connection at all"

**therokinrolla**: "just sounds like filler"

**JMez2612**: "I can‚Äôt give this a 6 in good conscience"

**rickikardashian**: "This song is like very odd. This sounds like a filler song for the album of the lovechild of Kesha‚Äôs drunk party girl phase and Charli XCX."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "no ty"

**ImADudeDuh**: "you weren't hannah montana"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Is it just me or does this sound like Grow A Pear by Kesha?"

**kappyko**: "high, hi-fiiiii STEREO HAHAHAHAHH B ITCH"

**dropthehammer11**: "this thot is forgettable af"

**strawberryswing1**: "this song started out so good and then that chorus happened...tragic"

**awryj**: "The verse is better than the chorus, so it's kinda disappointing tbh. Also the bridge is really weak."

**superr_rad**: "this is better than her other song, but its still not very good."

---

**Overall average**: 6.445 **// Total points:** 515.6 **// [Averages](https://pastebin.com/S1bh3s4s)**

---

Miley‚Äôs sidekick on *Hannah Montana*, and Emily‚Äôs music felt exactly like that tbh - the *Can‚Äôt Be Tamed* B-sides. Emily is very active on television: currently starring in Freeform‚Äôs *Young & Hungry* and having starred in CBS‚Äô *Mom*. She was also in the indie film *Love Is All You Need*, which reversed the roles of heterosexuals and homosexuals in society - definitely something worth checking out.

**RANK**:

- #53 - Lovesick - 6.821
- #67 - Let's Be Friends - 6.069

---

**Ghost-Quartet**: Emily Osment surprised me. Just based off of my prior knowledge of her I had assumed that her music would be cheap and bad, but honestly ‚ÄúLovesick‚Äù turned out to be one of my top songs in the rate and while I didn‚Äôt like ‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Be Friends‚Äù there was potential in it. Maybe I‚Äôll listen to her album, but it‚Äôs really understandable how she just kind of faded away.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I didn't care about Hannah Montana when I was a kid and I still don't care about it now

**jamesfog**: Poor Emily, she had some bops but never had any success :(

**omgcow**: Hot take- these two songs are better than Miley's discography

**bwc222**: can she come back to the music scene

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I‚Äôm confused, is she going to the club or a spin class? Still this is actually a really slick pump up jam, I love the funky, jazzy vibe of it, it‚Äôs a song about dancing that it sounds like you could actually dance to. Once you get past the absurdity of the name ‚ÄúSneakernight‚Äù the actual premise of the song, that her and her friends are going out for a night of dancing so crazy and fun they have to be wearing sneakers to avoid breaking their feet, is actually kind of fantastic. It‚Äôs a really bouncy, tight track with a lot of interesting production and absolutely dead air, appropriately the energy never drops for a second. Plus Vanessa delivers a very charming vocal performance here. And more importantly, the music video is an important preservation of that tacky mid-2000‚Äôs Disney Channel style."

A very Christian song that is accompanied by a cute video. I love this song, but I‚Äôm somewhat glad that Sabrina ditched this sound. The song is very well-produced, and it's probably my favorite song from Sabrina's debut album. You won‚Äôt see Sabrina for the rest of today.

# EYES OPEN (by Taylor Swift)

**PuggleMaster**: "OMG SHOOKETH"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I love that post-chorus instrumental. Really cool and I wait for it each time."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I think that while Eyes Wide Open is a serviceable debut album, a lot of the tracks on it feel a little bit wispy and somewhat forgettable. I think this track is one of the album‚Äôs standouts, it has a bit more meat to it and was a hint towards the sounds and themes Sabrina would follow further on her sophomore album EVOLution. A very nice track."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "üëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅüëÅ"

**rickikardashian**: "EYES WIDE OPEN, EYES WIDE OPEN, EYES WIDE OPEN LIKE I WAS AT THE OCULIST"

**huntyphobic**: "Sabrina is serving major looks in this video omg??"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "EUUUYEZ WHIIIIYED OOOOPIN"

**SpanKKy1**: "Mouth wide open, mouth wide open"

**twat_brained**: "Honestly I'd be happy if Sabrina kept her eyes open bc I could stare at them all dayüòç"

**eklxtreme**: "I like the catchy vocal sample throughout the song and most of the subtleties rather than the maximalist parts"

**musicotic**: "Actually a bussy popping song"

Hilary‚Äôs first hit was a sunny pop rock jam that was often compared to *Let Go* era Avril Lavigne. I think anyone who watched *Lizzie McGuire* in the past has nostalgia for this particular song. ‚Äúif the light is off, then it isn‚Äôt on!‚Äù - an iconic line

---

# NOT TODAY

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Kinda samey and not super interesting. The chorus is nice but everything is just there."

**Lexarqade**: "Definitely didn't age as well as some of her other Disney Era songs."

**SkyBlade79**: "Trash. Nothing interesting about it at all and the lyrics are for 5 year olds. This is the worst type of pop. Most of the Hilary Duff songs on this rate are so forgettable that I‚Äôm not going to even waste time writing separate comments. This is what people think of when you say the "music industry", as in a machine pumping out the exact same, inoffensive thing just because it "worked" in the past. this gives pop a bad name. This is the musical equivalent of the emoji movie. This song is so yesterday."

**kappyko**: "wow i can tell my scores for this are gonna make people sad. this is a nothing of a song"

**dropthehammer11**: "Hey Hillary, 2002 called, it wants Avril back"

**SimplyHaunted**: "If I wanted to listen to a weaker copy of Avril Lavigne, I'd go listen to Avril Lavigne's body double."

# NOSTALGIA IS A POWERFUL FEELING

**NapsAndNetflix**: "peaked at #2 in canada when will your fave. I remember the music video for this being on family channel like every second and it was so lit it's just such a good song"

**poppinmmolly**: "THIS ONE fills me with Nostalgia"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "invented breakups"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "To me, that refrain of ‚Äúso yesterday, so yesterday, I‚Äôm just a bird that‚Äôs already flown away‚Äù is the most iconic piece of music in this rate. Instantly memorable, it‚Äôs been stuck in my head for literally years. The whole song really is just fantastic, usually when I really like a song I end up writing a lot about it but there‚Äôs nothing that I have to say about this song, it‚Äôs perfect."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is pretty much Hillary's most recognisable song, IMO. I'm pretty sure I've heard it a lot of times before. So boppable."

**therokinrolla**: "it isnt that this is bad but this honestly sounds like its part of the soundtrack to a coming of age movie with a 10 on metacritic"

**lady_sable**: "Cute, but kinda boring"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Queen of reading her listeners."

**jamesfog**: "Iconic song played on replay on Radio Disney"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "such an iconic early naughties song"

**twat_brained**: "It's still as good today as it was 14 years ago."

**eklxtreme**: "pop-rock done right! It's a fun tune and it has lovely lyrics. That last line is perfect."

Ashley channeled her inner Britney in this song, and what a bop this song is! The song features uncredited vocals by American rapper and producer Sean Garrett. Ashley must‚Äôve had a $40 budget for this video because this is one of the cheapest pop music videos I‚Äôve ever seen.

**chili_jones**: "royalty free lady gaga"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is better Britney than Britney is."

**timothy444**: "A step-down from It's Alright It's OK. Still a decent song and I'm sensing 2000s Britney vibes here. Also, feels very mature for a Disney single."

**Lexarqade**: "This reminds me heavily of another song but I'm not sure what. Also they said "erotic?" Is that too explicit for Disney?"

**huntyphobic**: "me when I want to recreate the ‚Äòcan‚Äôt be tamed‚Äô music video but I only have $30 for the budget"

Selena‚Äôs actual scene phase lasted one album, and this song is proof of it. Gina Schock, the drummer of the female rock band The Go-Go‚Äôs, worked on several songs on Selena Gomez & the Scene‚Äôs debut album.

**eklxtreme**: "almost makes me miss pop-rock Selena cus this is good and she does the rockish vibe well"

# Selena wyd

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Percussion is really nice but Selena sounds best over light acoustic or electronic production tbh."

**calltehshots**: "I'll attribute this song's failure to the Scene because Selena would never."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This was back when Selena had a band and attempted to be a powerhouse vocalist rocker type, and while it‚Äôs not bad, I definitely prefer her new style. This was the type of song she could release as a 16 year old but if she dropped this track today it would not come across as well."

**therokinrolla**: "her voice is actually painful to listen to in this song. You can tell how hard she is straining. yikes"

This was released as a single to promote the Nicholas Sparks film *The Last Song*. Miley‚Äôs co-star and current fianc√© Liam Hemsworth stars in the video. I‚Äôm a sucker for Miley ballads and this is no exception.

---

# A VOCALIST

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "omg i forgot about this song"

**fifthchevron**: "Really nice ballad, great vocal."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "A tasteful Miley Cyrus song? Gagged. It‚Äôs tepid and generic, it was very clearly written for a Nicholas Sparks movie, but all the same I‚Äôm charmed by it. I thought Liam Hemsworth was super hot in the movie this song was in, I guess? It‚Äôs weird, I usually think of myself who enjoys Miley Cyrus as a songwriter but the only singles in this rate that I‚Äôve liked are the ones that she didn‚Äôt write."

**lady_sable**: "Shows off her vocal talent really well"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A love song. She truly did that‚Ñ¢"

**jamesfog**: "Wow another iconic ballad"

**rickikardashian**: "The song is just so perfect because it takes you to the scenario she sings. There‚Äôs a lot of emotions that moves into you and lets you understand what‚Äôs being sang. Also the instrumental is fucking beautiful."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "just love miley and liam so much"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "me looking at ice cream to help me through my crippling depression"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "One of ha best ballads."

**dropthehammer11**: "This is a nice ballad"

**superr_rad**: "probably my favorite miley song ever, its such a good wholesome ballad"

This was only released as a single in Europe. I‚Äôm not much of a fan of the combination of pop rock and synthpop, and the lyrics are nonsensical, but as a segue into mainstream pop it‚Äôs pretty decent. Also, I never noticed how much it sounds like a Veronicas‚Äô single until /u/calltehshots pointed it out. I think they would‚Äôve pulled it off with more flair.

---

**gannade**: "screaming"

**strawberryswing1**: "Demi plz stop screaming at me"

# I REMEMBER DECEMBER!

**fifthchevron**: "A really weird departure from her usual sound, thought it was a cover..."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Weird juxtaposition between the synthpop and pop/rock segments, but it works?"

**lady_sable**: "Fuck me up Demi!!"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I could totally see Paramore covering this."

**SkyBlade79**: "I have a completely different memory of this song? I thought it was a ballad but this is a super pleasant surprise. Bops hard!"

**SimplyHaunted**: "The power in her voice gets me every time. Such a banger."

**kappyko**: "why is this so quiet? nice vibes but like whatt is this trying to be oh shit nevermind those guitars kicked in! extra .5 for that sweet bridge"

**twat_brained**: "This is one of those few songs in this rate that can actually hold up after a few years. Great tune, Demetria! Hopefully you can realize what made your Disney-era discography so great and return to this style of music! (it's one of the only ways you'll get me to like you again, at least)"

**awryj**: "I feel a 10 cyomin oyn"

**superr_rad**: "im bnaised cause i genuinely loved this album and this song hasnt aged very well but im still bopping so"

**eklxtreme**: "demi can totally pull off the rockish style and any style as a matter of fact"

**musicotic**: "This has a cool rocky vibe, but with an actually pleasing voice" (i call shade)

# FORGETTABLE

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Nothing about this is remarkable unfortunately, except for that nice guitar riff that comes up late in the song."

**dirdbub**: "I'm not sure what happened in this track other than me wondering what happened in December to make Demi want to write this song"

**seferre2**: "this song makes me so angry the lyrics are so fucking annoying"

**timothy444**: "God I already forgot what this song sounded like. Ironic."

**Lexarqade**: "The beginning sounds like it was pulled out of a Sonic game. Gotta go fast."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "not bad but forgettable"

**calltehshots**: "I go ooh ooh, you go ah ah la la la la la la la la" (reminds me of an aly & aj thread where someone said they loved aly & aj‚Äôs song ‚Äúuntouched‚Äù üíÄ)

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I think I‚Äôm just more of a ‚Äúsad breakup songs‚Äù hoe not a ‚Äúpower breakup jam‚Äù hoe, sorry Demi. For my money ‚ÄúBack to December‚Äù took more or less the same concept and did it better, this song is just messy."

Victoria‚Äôs official debut single and her only single past *Victorious* was unfortunately unsuccessful. When I first heard the song, I was obsessed with it, and I was sure that it would blow up. Even with a video starring Colton Haynes, the song remains unknown by almost everyone. It‚Äôs a simple bubblegum pop song that‚Äôs definitely worth more than its success (or lack thereof).

# I THINK WE'RE ALL GOLD

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "I think we're ALL gold"

**strawberryswing1**: "I think we're ALL gold"

**PuggleMaster**: "this is a bop don't tell /u/gannade"

**calltehshots**: "hi /u/gannade"

**ImADudeDuh**: "@panda I gave this an 8 so don't kill me"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "this is an 11 but it's not on canadian spotify so Victoria is confirmed a racist and is docked a point"

**tevinterimperium**: "I demand justice for Victoria Justice's music career!!!!"

**mokitsu**: "she did that"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Not bad, that Tove Lo writing credit surprised me though"

**dirdbub**: "KEEP A GOLD CHAIN ON MY NECK FLY AS A JET BOY BETTA TREAT ME WIT RESPECT"

**lady_sable**: "She's a meme lmao but this is actually a bop"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This sounds like it'd be from Victorious. Therefore it's a bop."

**Lexarqade**: "This actually isn't bad. Unfortunately Ariana sucked the soul out of her music career to fuel her own."

**jamesfog**: "The bop that got away!"

**rickikardashian**: "~~Daddy~~ Colton Haynes made me give this song an 8"

**huntyphobic**: "im honestly shocked that this song wasn‚Äôt bigger, like it is surprisingly good."

**kappyko**: "actually surprised at how much i like this! very cute family friendly pop stuff. :)"

**eklxtreme**: "this is definitely a bop. I love her vocals and her unique voice!"

**musicotic**: "Fucking bop"

# I THINK WE'RE ALL MEDIOCRE

**awhile2**: "kiiara did it better"

**twat_brained**: "This doesn't hold a **DIME** to Kiiara!"

**letsallpoo**: "This is a passable Jessie J song until that dreadful bridge"

**dropthehammer11**: "great new Jessie J track"

**awryj**: "Oh, it's Jessie J-- oh"

**agentofscranton**: "would've been a 10 were it not for the godawful rap verse"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "because reasons"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Evident of why Victoria Justice's career did not take off."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "The title was supposed to be ironic, right? I don‚Äôt hate this, but if Victoria was trying to launch a music career, why on Earth did she think that this would be the song to do it on? It‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ you know how Ariana Grande was basically forced to release ‚ÄúPut Your Hearts Up‚Äù but she knew that it was bad and then went off in an interesting direction afterwards? This is Victoria Justice‚Äôs ‚ÄúPut Your Hearts Up,‚Äù and she never found the way. That squeaky refrain of ‚Äúguh-old‚Äù is incredibly annoying. The ‚Äúrap‚Äù bridge was terrible and then at the end of it, after all of the nonexistant buildup, there‚Äôs an absolutely pathetic ‚Äúbig note‚Äù and other than that there‚Äôs absolutely no tone shift in the song. Victoria sounds awful here, which is weird because she‚Äôs proven in the past that she can be a decent vocalist, but here she sounds strained and she doesn‚Äôt really hit any high or low notes. A tepid, spineless song, my score for it dropped several points over the course of me typing this."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "The autotune is messy. The melody is messy. The lyrics are messy. Even the music video is messy. Kiiara outpeaked. Sorry."

**chili_jones**: "I THINK WE ALL SING"

**JMez2612**: "I think WE ALL dislike this song"

**seferre2**: "she has better songs on victorious tbh"

**SkyBlade79**: "This would probably be a 5 but Tove Lo wrote it so I‚Äôve got to bump up the score, you already know it"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "not bad but not good which i guess summarizes a "5" rating"

# TEA üçµ

**berober04**: "Spandau Ballet > Victoria Justice > Imagine Dragons >>>>>> Kiiara"

# hmmm

**superr_rad**: "i think we ALL agree that Ariana has the superior lead single with "The Way" but this is still a nice forever21 bop (((which is legit the only place ive heard it in public lmao)))"

**SpanKKy1**: "Better than Ariana's discography"

# THE ASSAY...

deleted: **gannade**: "This song means a lot to me. When it came out, I was around 13 and I couldn't be caught dead listening to something as cheesy and bubblegum pop as this. It was too girly, too childish, too gay. Maybe I didn't want to like this song because I didn't want to accept my own homosexuality. Idk if it was that deep though. Anyways, the song was always perpetually stuck in the back of my head and through all these years, I still turn to this song when I need something to lift my mood up. I credit it for expanding my music taste and giving me a newfound appreciation for bubblegum pop when I was desperately trying to resist liking it. If it wasn't so insanely catchy and fun, I wouldn't be the popheads I am today!

Emotions aside, here is objectively why Gold is the best song in the rate:

Victoria just oozes charisma in this song. Bubblegum pop is all about fun. Despite the saccharine nature of many of the songs in the rate, none of them are as successful as Gold simply because of Victoria's ability to really let go and just have fun - and more importantly, Victoria's ability to convey this to the listener.

Gold starts off with guns blazing in its mission of pop perfection: the vibrato at the end of each of the phrases of the first verse - how she extends the last syllable of "go", "ignore", "you", "22" - is just gorgeous. Victoria's voice sounds like it's just at the edge of cracking, and the delicate balance in her tone, how it's just on the precipice of veering to disaster, elevates the song further. It helps that the last syllables also rhyme; it's pop genius honestly.

The fierce, sassy, and confident way she delivers the final line of the prechorus ("how much clearer do I have to be?") perfectly summarizes the song. She's fabulous, she's here to have fun, and she's GOLD. You may not understand it, you might even disagree. You might say "oh, but a certain costar has a 4 octave range and she can hit whistle notes and she's so nice and blah blah blah blah" but it doesn't matter. Victoria doesn't care. She knows what she's worth and (I think) that's ALL that matters. By the time she gets to the bridge, you should've already figured it out, if you're not a fool.

Like fellow Nickelodeon costar Miranda, who inexplicably adopts a British accent in the middle of Dancing Crazy, Victoria similarly inexplicably elongates the one syllable word "Gold" to "Guhhhh-olddd" in the chorus. It's a crazy risk that might alienate people with trash taste, but it pays off in spades here. But what makes the risk really work is Victoria's ability to sell it so effortlessly. The way she embraces the ridiculousness of it all, you can just tell she's having a whole lot of fun in the studio. And again, Victoria has the charisma to let the listener feel it too. Combine that with her gorgeous vibrato, then Victoria really does have a song that is GOLD.

On a final note, the music video with its instagram filters and vibrant pink colors is aesthetic and stunningly beautiful."

The star of *Zoey 101* and *Victorious* had loads of decently successful bops when she was on *Victorious* (‚ÄúFreak the Freak Out‚Äù, ‚ÄúBeggin on Your Knees‚Äù, ‚ÄúBest Friend‚Äôs Brother‚Äù). Her solo career started and ended with one single though. Hopefully she comes back to music someday. Victoria is currently acting in indie films.

Omg queen of waking up in different places in the world! This really furthers all the jokes her fans make about her going on vacations all the time. "Wake Up" was the lead single for Hilary‚Äôs first compilation album *Most Wanted* (which hit #1 on the Billboard 200).

**agentofscranton**: "i hadn't listened to this since i was about 11, so listening to it again brought back so many memories of childhood and friends i'd lost contact with, and i just started tearing up like halfway through the song like wtf"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Oh my god this song I haven't heard this in so goddamn long. The chorus is wonderful and the bridge is iconic."

**calltehshots**: "This is my favorite song to listen to on a plane riiiiight before it's about to land in a different country. Woke queen."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This sounds like a perfect theme song. What a bop!"

**rickikardashian**: "She literally dresses up as Carly Rae and Avril Lavigne in the video"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I was coming off of the high of her string of great singles from her first two albums so this song was kind of a letdown, there are a lot of elements in the production that I feel are unnecessary. I still think it‚Äôs a good song though, but it‚Äôs not quite as good as her other singles."

**SimplyHaunted**: "Not really feeling her voice in this song, but it's an ok party song."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Honestly, a huge fucking bop. Whenever I was in like 2005 and watching disney channel, this was always my favorite song for them to play during commercials."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "**I PUT MY MAKEUP ON A SATURDAY NIGHT**"

# I‚ÄôM GOING BACK TO SLEEP, THANKS

**SkyBlade79**: "This one is a standout just because it‚Äôs like literally the worst one of the bunch. The lyrics make me feel nauseous and this production is so generic that it actually hurts my mind. Her voice is so bland and sounds like she‚Äôs not even singing."

**omgcow**: "One of her weaker singles tbh"

I find it hard to fathom that this song is already out. It got 3 11s! This R&B jam had a viral music video that featured her *High School Musical* co-star Zac Efron. I find the song to be incredibly soothing. Vanessa‚Äôs soft voice works so well with the song.

# MORE THAN OK

**PuggleMaster**: "A LEGENDARY BOP SHE NEEDS TO RETURN TO MUSIC ITS THAT SONG"

**mokitsu**: "honestly this is a timeless song and it had me on my feelings for 5+ years. the video is also really iconic and it introduced me to bowling alleys and teenage crushes"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is actually really pretty? I think the thing that sells it for me are those strings, the subtle harp playing throughout really does a good job classing it up and making it ‚Äúsparkle.‚Äù Don‚Äôt know why Vanessa insists on adding pseudo-rap bridges to her songs but this one was unobtrusive at least."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This is the sweetest, most calming love song. Zac & Vanessa should've never broken up."

**SkyBlade79**: "I‚Äôm really surprised that I heard this song in the past? Regardless, it‚Äôs quite the chill bop."

**jamesfog**: "A masterpiece"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Huge bop!"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "ended zac efron"

**omgcow**: "Zac Efron looks so damn FINE in this video oh my god I love him so much. Like honestly I would sell my soul for a chance to go on a group bowling date and then get milkshakes and then canoodle on the beach with Zac omg this video is my dream. The song's cool too"

**twat_brained**: "The harp, the sultry vocals, the beat, the beautiful late-'00s aesthetic of this video; this song is almost perfect! The only criticism I have is that the bridge feels as though it's somewhat out of place. Apart from that, this EASILY deserves to go top 10!"

**awryj**: "that is an unexpected bop"

**superr_rad**: "THIS SONG IS FUCKING AMAZING!!! seriously everything about it is so brilliant to me, its one of those songs i loved upon first listen, and i still love it to this day."

**eklxtreme**: "it sounds very sweet and uplifting"

**dirdbub**: "Filler."

Hilary‚Äôs biggest hit leaves the rate! This is the best example of the electropop sound that flourished in 2007. The video features *Twilight* star Kellan Lutz as Hilary‚Äôs love interest. It‚Äôs kinda hard to believe that she was only 19 when she dropped this masterpiece of an album.

Kinda dated, kinda amazing? This got completely outshined by ‚ÄúHe Said She Said‚Äù, but it still bangs. The song features an uncredited rap by David Jassy. The music video is just footage from the High School Musical tour.

---

# THIS IS FABULOUS

**PuggleMaster**: "The nostalgia didn't let me down I'm crying my wig my acne it's all gone"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "wow David Jassy is so talented I wish he was still relevant - kendrick could literally never"

**awhile2**: "you can find me in the club, bottle full of bub"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "WOAH I FORGOT WHAT A BOP THIS WAS"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "What ever happened to Ashley Tisdale? I had no idea she released music before, but this is okay. I like the background "woo's". The rap verse is actually like not bad."

**calltehshots**: "When bb me used to watch this video, it used to have me clutching my pearls. It was a smidge thotty for the Disney Channel and it had my bb ho ass shook. Ashley Tisdale is a ho icon and an inspiration to us all."

**dirdbub**: "whEN DID DISNEY DO RAP FEATURES"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I relate to this song because I, too, desire for people to treat me well. Good use of violins, they really make a song that could easily come off as whiny instead sound epic. She really sells this song, by the end of it you really do feel sorry for her."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Those violins at the beginning! Velvet Rope is shook."

**therokinrolla**: "a dramatic bop. Makes me want to dance in a very PG-13 way at a middle school dance where everyone is saying ‚Äúheck yea‚Äù because they think its cool"

**JMez2612**: "This is her magnum opus"

**lady_sable**: "Ashley has better songs imo, but this is still good."

**seferre2**: "god damn fuck shit this is big time bop"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Something Something, Selena Gomez."

**timothy444**: "Very 2000s. Me like."

**Lexarqade**: "Come through strings! Those are some big struggle vocals but Miss Ashley was never a vocal powerhouse. The rap is very unnecessary."

**jamesfog**: "One of several slut bops from Ashley"

**huntyphobic**: "starts getting a bit repetitive near the end, but it still makes my pussy loose so w/e"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "he said she said's less slutty little sister"

**awryj**: "This song screams mid-2000s"

**eklxtreme**: "the production is pretty interesting and it's very danceable"

# THIS IS GROSS

**whatyourheartdesires**: "too much happening"

**rickikardashian**: "Idk why the beginning got me so hyped up and the rest of the song for me was so meh"

**SkyBlade79**: "Production is boring and the rapper is unneeded, but her vocals are good."

**kappyko**: "the production on this is too much. garageband-esque string sections, her vocals are really annoying, and the chorus isn't catchy.. the rapper was good but the drums hurt aaaaa sorry guys"

**dropthehammer11**: "dollar store Britney"

**musicotic**: "Was good until the rap"

# A SIMILAR INSTRUMENT

**twat_brained**: "When I was younger I bopped so hard to this song. Nowadays I just realize how this sounds too familiar to "Scandalous" by Mis-Teeq. Still a fantastic song though. It definitely has a place on the second day."

**fifthchevron**: "This is the Scandalous instrumental...Misteeq should sue."

MissyBee37: I'm so sad this one is out already :( I love Ashley!! This and "He Said, She Said" are sooo goood.

I'm super confused by the Mis-Teeq comparisons! Not one, but two! I love that song, too, but I never connected the two... Now I'm going to have to go listen...

Edit: Ohhh I can hear it, kind of... Similar in style, for sure.

P.S. To answer this question...
>ThatParanoidPenguin: "What ever happened to Ashley Tisdale?

@ /u/ThatParanoidPenguin

She hasn't released music in a while or done a whole lot acting-wise besides "Phineas and Ferb" (she does produce now, though), but she's super active on YouTube again! She does awesome acoustic covers with her husband, Chris French, as well as fashion/makeup videos and Q&As. And she has a makeup line :) I love following her YouTube channel.

This club bop was only released as a single in Europe. I remember when the video came out everyone was freaking out because Miley only wearing panties and a tank top in one scene. Oh, how times have changed. A [demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JaqcACb2v40) of the song with a different chorus recently leaked. The visuals for the *Can‚Äôt Be Tamed* era were so dark and stunning; I wish we got more videos from the album.

---

**rickikardashian**: "Do you remember when this was Miley being wild? Lmao"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "this is like miley's ugly and awkward middle Pokemon evolution in her wack hunty transformation but this is still a bop nonetheless"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "i remember being like 14 when this came out and people thought this was scandalous back then lol buckle up bitches this isn‚Äôt even Destiny Hope‚Äôs final form"

# MILEY OWNS MY HEART

**Joebiekong**: "R O C K MAHFIYAH. But really though‚Ä¶ who does own my heart?"

**fifthchevron**: "The imagery in the lyrics is awesome: "Fire in the dark" "Living art" "I want to believe we're a masterpiece", "Hits me like a tidal wave", "It's hard to tell in the dark". Are there other songs about how music heightens the mood/atmosphere and makes certain situations feel more powerful than they are? Also she fucking SLAYS the bridge."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This is super dated but like a bop regardless."

**mokitsu**: "i love the pulsing beat and the dark vibes of the song, im sad this flew under my radar for so long because it's a bop"

**calltehshots**: ""Who owns my heart: is it love or is it art?" This is literal poetry."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "This sounds like an album from Bangerz and I liked Bangerz, so that‚Äôs good I guess? My score for this climbed the longer the song played, I was tepid on it at first but I can‚Äôt deny that this is infectious and a pretty well crafted club banger."

**lady_sable**: "IS IT LOVE OR IS IT ART? This rate is turning me into a Miley stan lmao. I forgot how good her old singles were."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "A true 2010 bop and I absolutely love it."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "THIS ALSO DESERVED WAY BETTER ON THE CHARTS"

**twat_brained**: "I remember when I first saw the video how much her hair looked like Ke$ha in the car"

**eklxtreme**: "the chorus feels kinda off to me, but it's still pretty catchy overall"

**musicotic**: "I don't know why I like this, but I do"

# NOT

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "meh"

**dirdbub**: "this is a non-song"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I was expecting this song to be some sort of ballad why does it use the word 'fart' I don't understand send help"

**therokinrolla**: "well then..."

**chili_jones**: "ok this is worse"

**timothy444**: "The better question to ask is 'Who Owns My Hidden Talent?' because I see none of it in this song. :meghan:"

**kappyko**: "who's rock mafia and why are they producing so many mediocre tracks"

**dropthehammer11**: "who owns my fart hahahaha fuckin goteem"

This was first released just to promote the Disney Channel Original Movie *Twitches*, but it became so popular that it got a mainstream release and became the duo‚Äôs first single. What a song to start off the rate with tbh. The chorus sounds a bit too muddled for my taste, but I love the energy of the song.

---

**dropthehammer11**: "Are they lesbians? just asking" (they are not... to the extent of public knowledge. but if you mean for each other, then definitely not. because they're sisters.)

# INTO THE RUSH

**PuggleMaster**: "legends Twitches I'm shook"

**tevinterimperium**: "I loved this song so much as a 9 year old latent homosexual."

**poppinmmolly**: "a genuinely good song"

**agentofscranton**: "this is unironically one of my favourite songs of all time"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Certified bop. This is like prime time car ride music with your headphones in, ignoring your dipshit parents (they're wrong! they're always wrong!). Of course, you're listening with your CD player because it's 2005, and you're still reeling over last night's episode of Grey's Anatomy. Anyway, the buildup to that drop is really nice, it's really cinematic."

**calltehshots**: "These pop/rock chanteuses. Inspired to me to be every color that I am."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I like this song and I always try to comment on every song in a rate, but more than any of the other songs I just could not think of a single thing to say about this. I have no personal connection to it, nor do I think it‚Äôs particularly distinguished in any way. It‚Äôs fine."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Even if I find the genre to be somewhat cheesy, I'll be the first to admit that 2000s pop rock songs can be amazingly catchy if done well enough. This song is no exception."

**lady_sable**: "I like this. It's not as good as their later songs, but it's still pretty catchy."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Rock queens. When will your faves ever?"

**Lexarqade**: "A cute little bop."

**jamesfog**: "I fucking ADORE this song. It always takes me back to Halloween of 2005"

**SkyBlade79**: "lowkey bop, even though I don‚Äôt love their voices."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "as someone who grew up on the beach, this is such a beach song"

**huntyphobic**: "‚Äúcan you feel it rushing through your hair‚Äù ??? what hair bitches?? Yall SCALPDT ME"

**SimplyHaunted**: "Oh, shit! I forgot about this song. I'm a sucker for pop rock songs, but honestly I mainly remember this song from the Twitches movie."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented colors. halsey was just snatched even balder."

**twat_brained**: "MY BLOOD PRESSURE IS RAISED MY HEART IS RACING AND I AM HEADBANGING LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW! THANK YOU /u/SKIDDOS  FOR HAVING THIS AS A BANGING FIRST SONG!"

**superr_rad**: "what a fricken bop. i remember being confused by the TV captions having the wrong lyrics on Twitches and i was unreasonably frustrated by that, as a 5th grader."

**eklxtreme**: "sonically, this sounds pretty mature and I like it"

**musicotic**: "Ok this is a bop by some people i have never heard of"

# SLOW DOWN

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "as much as i love my michalka girls, this song sucks"

**fifthchevron**: "Lyrics are good but I was expecting much more from the chorus. They sound bored."

**TragicKingdom1**: "The first two lines not having a rhyme really bothered me, idk why"

**dirdbub**: "okay yeah this is a Disney song"

**chili_jones**: "shmeh. typical 2007 disney pop..."

**rickikardashian**: "The chorus is nice, but there‚Äôs something about the verses and the transitions into one another that makes me feel like they don‚Äôt go together"

**ImADudeDuh**: "It's ok"

This rap & reggae song!! This definitely wasn‚Äôt something I expected to hear from Bridgit, neither did I expect it to become a single. It was compared to fellow female pop rappers Cher Lloyd and Amy from Karmin. That faux-British accent is amazing.

---

# HERE COMES THE SUN

**PuggleMaster**: "Amazing bop"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "my favorite meteorologist"

**Nfranklin50**: "wow the verses are God awful but the chorus is great"

**Leixander**: "Miles better than Ready or Not. Chorus is insanely catchy, the verses are cute... Why isn't the original version on Spotify yet?!?!"

**agentofscranton**: "queen of flopping onto beds like a flying squirrel"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "whattakween"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "That piano, yes! And the soul! And the chorus! Love this."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Not sure what her accent is in this song but I really like the production and it's catchy enough."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I think that the chorus of this song is absolutely fantastic, one of the best in the rate. It‚Äôs adorable, bouncy, danceable, relatable, instantly memorable, and Bridgit sells the heck out of it. I like the way the notes do kind of ‚Äúswirl‚Äù like a hurricane. And I love those sort of ‚Äúsea shanty‚Äù backing vocals on the bridge. This song has insane replay value. Unfortunately, it misses out on a 10 for me because Bridgit‚Äôs white girl rapping is a bit too much cringe for me."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I love the weird...British...rapping thing she does? I love it a lot!"

**therokinrolla**: "what is this fake accent she is doing? Besides that this is really good and fun"

**lady_sable**: "Is this...Bridgit Mendler rapping? lol. I love the chorus of this song; it's really fun and catchy."

**jamesfog**: "Almost a 10, but the british accent..."

**SkyBlade79**: "I can‚Äôt believe that Bridgit literally invented rap?"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of standing in the middile of a hurricane, drowning, then discovering atlantis"

**VodkaInsipido**: "iconic song"

**BreezySeason**: "queen of o-o-os"

**dropthehammer11**: "this is refreshing after all of the actual cough drops I had to listen to"

**eklxtreme**: "her sing-rapping is dope and she knows how to make a fuckin bop"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This might be one of the greatest songs of all time."

# HERE COMES THE RAIN

**awhile2**: "this is gross is she british or something like what is going on with her accent in this song"

**fifthchevron**: "Some of the lyrics were interesting im clutching at straws here guyz..."

**chili_jones**: "i like so much from bridgit mendler but wtf is THAT ACCENT..."

**FishM8**: "Not really a fan of her old stuff, but love Nemesis. Sorry Bridgit."

**huntyphobic**: "Bridgit Mendler is british‚Ä¶‚Ä¶?"

**kappyko**: "oh my god this white girl rapping... I usually dig it but like considering this is Disney music it's just tacky"

**strawberryswing1**: "why is she singing/rapping in that accent?? she's American"

**musicotic**: "The background vocals are horrendous. Too talky singy for me"

# POP STAR COMPARISONS (gotta love pop music huh)

**Lexarqade**: "This reminds me of a Karmin song tbh, with the rap/sing combo. A nice bop. Some great powerhouse vocals in here."

**gannade**: "halsey did it better and Why was this no name trash included in the rate but not The Cheetah Girls or KeKe Palmer??" (let me live already panda)

**dirdbub**: "the melody sounds like NEEDTOBREATHE's "Brother" ft. Gavin McGraw don't ask me why I know that song" (i know it too and it‚Äôs a bop ngl)

**nikitasd**: "Is it just me or does this sound like a Natasha Bedingfield song?"

**poppinmmolly**: "reminds me of Natasha Bettingfield"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "does this remind anyone else of a Natasha Bedingfield song?"

**awryj**: "Oh, it's Natasha Bedingfie-- oh"

**calltehshots**: "This sounds like a Cher Lloyd B-side and idk how I feel about that..."

**twat_brained**: "What's with the British accent? One Cher Lloyd is enough, we DON'T NEED ANOTHER!" (we don't really have a relevant cher lloyd anymore sadly)

After the success of ‚ÄúNaturally‚Äù the band decided to go on a electro-pop route, and this was the result. It‚Äôs a cute song. The music video was filmed in Budapest while Selena was shooting for *Monte Carlo*. In the video, Selena plays a secret agent who tries to escape from other spies.

**PuggleMaster**: "This better than all of Revival" (:angery:)

Is it just me or does it sound like she says ‚Äúout of the fart and into the fart again‚Äù? Anyways, this was the first non-Hannah song I heard from her, and I loved it instantly. What a TUNE. Also, she does the macarena with a cowboy, a diver, a police man, and an astronaut in the music video - not many things are more awesome than that. That HP printer product advertisement at the end? Amazing.

Also, this means the two Fefe Dobson songs got knocked out in succession. Sorry /u/jamesfog.

# i can't think of any decent headlines this time so: this is the positive opinions section

**PuggleMaster**: "MY FUCKING WIG I CNA'T BELIEVE IT"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "YASYASYAS"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is a classic why is it one of her least successful songs"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I remember watching this video for the first time. I was thoroughly shook."

**Lexarqade**: "A nice motivational bop."

**jamesfog**: "My flop fave Fefe Dobson wrote this so of course I stan this rock anthem!"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "thing is an under-appreciated song"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of going out of the fire and into the fire again"

**kappyko**: "tbh that intro served 90s art rock realness. radiohead found dead"

**dropthehammer11**: "not crazy about a lot of miley but she was a hits machine. this is no exception"

**Johnnytoby**: "bop"

**twat_brained**: "Did she listen to this before recording "Malibu"? If she did, that'd probably be one of Miley's better career decisions as of late."

**eklxtreme**: "really fun catchy chorus"

# this is the negative opinions section

**gannade**: "I subtracted a point because the music video plagiarized Miranda's Dancing Crazy" (i was confused at first but then i realized that miranda transcends time)

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Didn't really remember this Miley song until the chorus, which I really like. The rest of the song kinda falls flat though."

**TragicKingdom1**: "I feel like this is just throwing noise at me without any sort of direction or meaning."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I‚Äôm convinced that this song exists because Miley sent a song to her record label and they told her to ‚Äústart all over‚Äù and she took it as a song title rather than as a plea to improve."

**JMez2612**: "It just doesn‚Äôt do it for me"

**SkyBlade79**: "Really not that great, kind of overrated."

**musicotic**: "It's just a worse version of See You Again"

# i don‚Äôt know what to categorize these as

**dirdbub**: "hahaha, I guess popheads will like to "Start All Over" the song! hahaha. someone please love me I'm so lonely"

**therokinrolla**: "like miley wishes she could do after her Dead Petz era"

MrSwearword: Well with today's rate reveal day over, another word from me, The NUKE of Windsor...

DEATH TO MEMERANDA. Also, again if you need some positivity from this remember that my prior Disney rate was so bad I decided to spare my ears this time. No one's 11 is killed by me...or not even someone's [letsallpoo's] generous smattering of 10s are killed by me.
