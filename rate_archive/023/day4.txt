ExtraEater: Hi to add to the spice I shall also reveal the results of an informal rate for the four seasons (with permission) that I barely promoted in the general discussion

# #4: Summer

---

Average: 5.895 // Total Points: 112.0 // Controversy: 4.254

---

Highest scores: (11 x2) PM_ME_UR_FAVE_MOVIES, NapsAndNetflix (10 x4) jamesfog, sky, FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, modkip (9 x2) ExtraEater, ThatParanoidPenguin 

Lowest Scores: (0 x4) BlasiFeelsSwift, ImADudeDuh, skiddos, kappyko (1 x2) dirdbub, PuggleMaster 

---

as school ends, you're getting married to summer. you both declare you're running away from school and never looking back. you have the lovely honeymoon phase. then you realize how fucking hot and shitty and tiring it is. and the stupid tumblr analogy collapses, and you want to die in the hot ass global warming sun. that being said, the "honeymoon phase" of the first few weeks of summer is the greatest thing ever for me, really. there is really nothing like a good vacation from everything, perhaps [a spin of this killer album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NjzssPnkC04), and if you're lucky, a couple of road trips or straight up visits abroad. but i know someone that gave me this quote: "if Summer's more about what you don't have to do than what you actually have to do, it's not fun anymore", which accurately describes the last part of summer. yeah you get freedom, but unless you actually have plans, get ready to get bored and roasted as fuck by Summer.

BlasiFeelsSwift: "fuck off i hate you"

zengaya: "nice but hot"

All those 11 year olds crying about break-ups and smashing things… iconic! I kinda wish this could’ve gone to #7, but this is a fine rank for the song. 

She does list 7 things by the way:

1. You’re vain
2. Your games
3. You’re insecure
4. You love me, you like her
5. You made laugh, you made me cry, and I don’t know which side to buy
6. Your friends - they’re jerks, when you act like them, just know it hurts, I wanna be with the one I know
7. You make me love you

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "1 DON'T PICK UP THE PHONE YOU KNOW HE'S ONLY CALLING CAUSE HE'S DRUNK AND ALONE"

# Number of 7s: 15

**Leixander**: "This must have an average of seven, popheads please."

**Kaphox**: ":meghan:"

# SHA

**jamesfog**: "SHA, SHA"

**gannade**: "Lorde wishes she was able to make angsty pop music this good"

**PuggleMaster**: "THROWBACK TO THAT VENETIAN PRINCESS PARODY ICONIC"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I mean yeah she names more than 7 things and this song is about nick jonas but it's still a timeless classic that will be remembered for AGES"

**Nfranklin50**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9geiPp9UFI0"

**tevinterimperium**: "Ended Nick Jonas"

**fifthchevron**: "There's a lot of cheese happening here, but the chorus is undeniable."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I literally remember the day Breakout came out my sister was flipping out. 7 Things isn't one of my favorite Miley songs but it has a damn strong set of verses, that I probably like more than the chorus."

**mokitsu**: "queen of lists, watchmojo is shook"

**calltehshots**: "Nick Jonas's impact. Also, this video is BEYOND iconic. 11 year olds crying about their middle school breakups I'm forever gagged."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I gave it a seven because I’m so quirky and original :p. No, my issue in rates is that I’m torn between rating a song on whether I like it or whether I think it’s good, which are often different things. This song is kinda cute and I recognize that it’s actually pretty clever and competently written, but at the same time it’s not to my tastes."

**therokinrolla**: "this song is so cute and bops and as much as i like writing weird things as comments this is just a really happy song"

**JMez2612**: "This song made me hate my non-existent ex."

**lady_sable**: "I'm so here for angry Miley"

**Cryomatic**: "the movie was better"

**dirdbub**: "cheesy"

**seferre2**: "cheesy"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Miley honey don't try to copy Demi's shouting gimmick it doesn't work for you"

**omgcow**: "This song is just as annoying now as it was when it played during commercial breaks on Disney Channel"

An electropop jam that manages to be the shortest song on the rate (2:31). The chorus is *packed* with energy, the bridge the song itself pretty much feels like a rollercoaster. This is the least controversial song of the entire rate.

---

**SpanKKy1**: "Me @Shawn"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Invented the "woah" vs "whoa" discord discourse that lasted like 5 minutes" (it’s definitely whoa)

# WHOA WHOA

**kappyko**: "TALENT ONLY. constantly in the shadow of PBUS, this song is pop rock perfection. both the video mix and the album version are the definition of amazingly produced pop rock. this song feels goOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOD. fuck that bridge???? they're ahead of everybody else by fucking light years"

**Nfranklin50**: "this actually gave me chills"

**fifthchevron**: "The only one here I'd willingly listen to again. Energy kinda fizzles toward the end though."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Instrumental is a bit dated too, but definitely less so. The chorus is dumb but really catchy, and the verses are notably strong. The bridge is actually really nice."

**calltehshots**: "This song is my go-to "you got this bitch" for any situation. Job interviews, catching a dick, genuine rollercoaster rides."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "A catchy chorus and it’s a lot of fun, but I find it to be kind of childish? Which, I mean, they were young when they wrote it so it works but it just doesn’t quite do it for me like their other songs do."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is a bit more shouty than the previous Aly & AJ songs featured on the list. I consider it to be pretty high quality, even if it isn't really my thing."

**chili_jones**: "honestly this song GOES!!!"

**JMez2612**: "This song was EVERYTHING in Kindergarten"

**lady_sable**: "Iconic"

**seferre2**: "this song is sexy? that bassline tho"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "This song is clearly about riding dick."

**timothy444**: "Like WHOA HOA OAAA!!!!"

**Lexarqade**: "I hate the title but this goes off honestly"

**jamesfog**: "Such a fun bop, invented rollercoasters"

**huntyphobic**: "the bridge and breakdown make my wig fly off Every. Single. Damn. Time!!"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented roller coasters, interjections, and moving side to side. Ariana is shook."

**omgcow**: "Never forget this song's cameo in High School Musical 3"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Woah, this is fucking good."

**VodkaInsipido**: "finally a good song"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "aj looks like Kelly Clarkson and the production is very Kelly too i’m shook"

**twat_brained**: "I'm a bit confused as to why the music in the video is different from that of the audio track, but it's still an incredibly solid and thorough tune!"

**superr_rad**: "its so fun to sing like woooooahhhh"

**eklxtreme**: "lowkey a bop. very fun chorus and nice harmonies."

# NO

**dirdbub**: "I don't remember what this sounds like"

**therokinrolla**: "this song is pretty okay except DURING THE CHORUS THERE IS A MUFFLED SOUND THAT SOUNDS LIKE A DOOR CLOSING AND IT GETS ME EVERYTIME ITS SO IRRITATING"

An empowerment anthem! This song will never not make me happy. It’s one of Selena’s favorite songs of her own, and one that she holds close to her heart. This ended up being the band’s highest charting single to date in the US (Naturally & LYLALS ended up selling more though). There’s also a Spanish version of this titled “Dices”. I remember spend so much time trying to perfect the “na na na na na na na na na na na na na” (13 na’s), and I eventually got it. 2011 was great.

---

**dirdbub**: "a;lskdfja;lskjf;laskj I need a boyfriend"

# WHO SAYS THIS ISN’T A BOP?

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I watched a lot of “Bad Singers Prove They Can Sing!” compilation videos on YouTube and a lot of them included a clip of Selena Gomez doing an acoustic version of this song, so I guess it must be good for her then. Priscilla Renea writes bops people, stop sleeping on her!"

**Cryomatic**: "@the people who give this their 0s" (/u/SimplyHaunted)

**PuggleMaster**: "I'M BALD"

**tevinterimperium**: "Invented self love and tricking people into thinking you can sing!!"

**poppinmmolly**: "the best message in a Selgo song"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "can u believe selena gomez invented self confidence"

**fifthchevron**: "Queen of female solidarity. I think that's an important difference to note, she's specifically trying to elevate other girls and to help us reject the messages we're fed. Like really who does tell us these things? Most of the time there are unspoken, unofficial rules perpetuated by everyone in different ways. So I can appreciate someone stepping in between the message and messenger(s), and saying "Now hold on..."."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "No one says you're not beautiful Selena it's literally impossible to say that."

**mokitsu**: "this is such a beautiful song, still gets me on my feelings"

**calltehshots**: "Wow at this removing everyone's flaws. Thank you Selena for making us all beautiful."

**MNREDR**: "Cute song, but Selena's vocal shortcomings are apparent. One of the least enthusiastic "come on!"s I've ever heard in music, not to mention to weak "yeahhh!" at the end of the bridge. But the song bops so I forgive her."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Next to Survivor, this is probably my favorite motivational song. I think the fact that Selena actually sings this song naturally and genuinely instead of trying to fry her vocal cords to hit high notes for the Grammys contributes to its artistic merit a lot, TBH."

**therokinrolla**: "i AM PERFECT SELENA THANK YOU SO MUCH I LOOK UP TO YOU THIS IS YOUR PEAK I LOVE YOU AAAA!!!!"

**chili_jones**: "the bridge... who says u cant b the best? who said, who said? would ya tell me who said that? yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAA WHO SAID!"

**JMez2612**: "QUEEN OF EMPOWERMENT, I made covers of this on Kidz Bop’s website"

**lady_sable**: "Invented self-love"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "An inspiration ANTHEM."

**jamesfog**: "Inspirational bop!"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Unironically listen to this sometimes"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of wondering Who Says, me trying to cite sources in an essay could never"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "STILL SELENA'S ICONIC SONG!"

**kappyko**: "fuck off this is good and deserves top 10" (sorry kappy)

**dropthehammer11**: "this is a better version of Most Girls"

**superr_rad**: "a nice feel good self empowerment bop, and this cemented Selena's nice girl image pretty well"

**eklxtreme**: "inspiring message made into a sweet bop"

**musicotic**: "Best song of her career tbh"

# STOP INTERROGATING ME

**TragicKingdom1**: "I don't really get how questioning who in fact is putting this person down is relevant...like it's kind of an indirect way to empower someone."

**seferre2**: "this song makes me so angry the lyrics make me mad"

**Lexarqade**: "Who says I'm not perfect? Me, bitch. I say it. I'm not perfect, pretty, or beautiful. Oh god someone please love me I'm so lonely"

**SkyBlade79**: "I don’t get it? Like, bitch, what if I did say it?"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: ""the climb" did the empowerment thing better"

**SimplyHaunted**: "HANNAH MONTANA SAYS NOBODY'S PERFECT, BITCH. Sorry, been holding that in since 2011. I can't stand this song and how she stressed every last syllable of almost every line. Who Says is the weakest, most generic empowerment song of the batch that were released around the time. Seriously, this was the song that ruined Selena for me. I only just started enjoying her music like 2 singles ago. I already hated the song when it was constantly played on Disney Channel, but then to hear her absolutely butcher it live UGH I was so done."

**twat_brained**: "Of course **YOU** don't wanna be anyone else, Selena; you're an accomplished popstar who's still in her early 20s! Also, remember when Selena actually cared and spoke up about issues like this? LOL"

I can’t believe Sabrina ended capitalism! I think it’s known how much I love this song. The song starts off with a very confusing family tree, which caught me off guard on the first listen. The song seems to draw inspiration from Sam Sparro’s “Black & Gold”. This was the only song on Sabrina’s sophomore album *EVOLution* that Sabrina did not write; it was handed to her just as she was about to finish the album. Such a catchy song that deserved to chart on the Hot 100!

---

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "sarbina crapenter - thubj"

**FishM8**: "SKIDDLY DEE DA DUM"

# CAPITALISM FOUND DEAD IN A DITCH

**letsallpoo**: "it's faux woke but it got the line "the banks rob the people so the people rob the bank" on disney radio so it's also amazing"

**tevinterimperium**: "This song is a call for the proletariat to unite and rise up against the capitalists. Let the class war begin ladies!"

**fifthchevron**: "Is she having an existential crisis? Unexpected political awareness in the 2nd verse. I'm intrigued. Definitely could've made such a statement song sound more interesting and alive..."

**calltehshots**: "This anti-capitalist bop!"

**Lexarqade**: "Okay where did this absolute fucking bop come from? "And the bank robbed the people and the people robbed the bank" Queen of anti-capitalism."

# THUMBS UP

**PuggleMaster**: "THAT INTRO THE CHORUS THAT GROWER BOP"

**Nfranklin50**: "Woke queen"

**dirdbub**: "I remember hearing this on the radio once and having it stuck in my head for a week"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Honestly, I wanted to give this song a 10, Priscilla Renea wrote it and I adore her, but I can’t go the full way and give it a 10 because I don’t really understand this song. I had to Google what it was about. I think it’s an incredibly bold choice to have this song as a single and it’s probably the most thought provoking song on this list once you actually dig into it, so points for that. It’s so dark and I love it. One of my biggest issues with Sabrina as a vocalist is that her vocals can tend to feel flat and a little heavy in her lower registers, but I think that works to her advantage here as it helps her nail the sardonic tone of the song."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This legitimately sounds like classic jazz. Even the lyrics and Sabrina's delivery are right on point. I'm shaking. I'm twiddling my thumbs."

**therokinrolla**: "Am I the only that thinks this song sounds like Confessions era Madonna? The production sounds straight out of Let It Will Be. anyways, its one of the best songs of the year so"

**JMez2612**: "QUEEN OF RELATIVES"

**lady_sable**: "holy fuck this slayed me"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Dropping it low to this club banger."

**timothy444**: "Okay, I have a confession to make: while going through the playlist on shuffle, this song came on and I tried to guess who sung it. My first thought was Miley Cyrus. Unfortunately, I was wrong. Luckily, thumbs is much more complex than anything Miley Cyrus has ever done, especially on Bangerz which is one of the worst pieces of crap I have ever listened to. So yeah, this is a decent song and while the chorus might be a bit too simple (though, it is a kids rate), it is a nice little pop song."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented opposable digits"

**SpanKKy1**: "I prefer to use my fingers for the extra reach"

**dropthehammer11**: "catchy as fuck my dick is hard too"

**bwc222**: "the brother of my mother's cousin thrice removed finds this song to be a bop!"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I thank /u/skiddos (and /u/napsandnetflix to some extent) for giving this song a lot of promo in the subreddit cause this is a bop! I love how woke this song is without being too preachy."

**kappyko**: "this song isn't even that fucking good but /u/skiddos' insistence on giving it an 11 made me relisten over and over and i realize this is actually really cool. either that or stockholm syndrome."

**jamesfog**: "Definitely ha best song!"

**Overall average**: 7.327 **// Total points:** 586.2 **// [Averages](https://pastebin.com/vbFCQdCe)**

This star of *Girl Meets World* is probably Disney’s most promising star right now. She released an acoustic pop album in 2015 titled *Eyes Wide Open*. Her second album *EVOLution* shifted her sound from acoustic pop to dance pop. I actually didn’t include Sabrina’s first two singles and “Smoke and Fire” because she’s fairly new to most of /r/popheads. Sabrina is a very talented singer and songwriter. I can’t wait to hear what she has to follow her the amazing bop-filled [*EVOLution*](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0HADqfyOYZIPFceHZqPrejsspcC8zVGY). Sabrina’s not very popular on this sub, so I’m glad that she made it this far into the rate! She is currently on tour and preparing her third album. Her new single “[Why](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4qeaBFFq3to)” is out now! Its video features *Riverdale* star Casey Cott.

**RANK**:

- #12 - Thumbs - 7.971
- #20 - On Purpose - 7.770
- #51 - Eyes Wide Open - 6.915
- #60 - We'll Be the Stars - 6.652

**Ghost-Quartet**: In the new crop of Disney stars Sabrina is the one I see the most potential in. She jumped right on it with an album after only a year on television, and then another one a year later. While on the whole I liked it, I found Eyes Wide Open to be a somewhat twee debut album, it really felt like Sabrina was playing into a softer image and putting out the kind of music you’d expect from someone on a wholesome Disney channel show. There was a big stylistic shift going into her second album and her handprints are all over that one whereas she only had a few writing credits on her first, so I think she’s working her way more towards the type of music that she really wants to put out. EVOLution was a very solid album, it was much darker and more electronic than Eyes Wide Open but it still touched upon many of the same themes, just in a different way. She has a definite perspective and a vision for what she wants to do with her art, I’m waiting on that third album. [“All We Have Is Love”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUotEgzKmG8) is an 11, one of my favorite songs of 2016.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Outpeaked Sabrina the Teenage Witch, outpeaked Richard and Karen Carpenter

**jamesfog**: The most promising new Disney girl. Also, I'm older than her... omg am I old now

The song is pretty timeless and reflective of Lindsay’s life at that time. The poor girl was torn apart by the media and the GP.

# GROOL

**PuggleMaster**: "THAT MOTHERFUCKING BOP YASSSSS"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I was at a wedding social like a month ago (like two months ago when this is revealed) and my friend like **begged** for them to play this song and they wouldn't and she was so mad but they played shania for me so you win some you lose some"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "It's a bit sad seeing that she has always had problems with fame"

**fifthchevron**: "Still slaps, she was the biggest star on the planet when this hit, so it didn't seem forced. The second verse is kinda dumb. Overall it's convincing enough. The instrumental works well with her voice and the violins (?) make it sound a bit more epic."

**mokitsu**: "honestly lindsay lohan ended both paparazzi and fleetwood mac with this song. i hope this was a hit back in the day because it's really good. it's a dark bop and it feels very personal"

**calltehshots**: "This is the definition of iconic. I want to sue America for this not charting on the Billboard Hot 100 when this should've been a number 1 smash for 20 weeks. When Ariana said she hates America, this is what she was talking about."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Lindsay would know about rumors, wouldn’t she? I think that’s a big part of what makes this song so appealing, it’s inexorably linked to Lindsay Lohan and our image of her, and there’s just something so punk about hearing her kick back against the media machine. The song itself is no slouch, it has this sort of gritty anger to it, the way that they blurred Lindsay’s vocals behind a touch of static adds to the aesthetic and masks her limited singing prowess."

**therokinrolla**: "damn lindsay go the fuck AWF!"

**chili_jones**: "the only LiLo song worth listening tbh..."

**lady_sable**: "This song is so good and iconic tbh. And those lyrics are v relevant to Lindsay's career."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "My gay ass is shaking."

**Lexarqade**: "RIP Lindsay but at least she delivered us this iconic smasher. I wish my tits looked as good as hers do in this video."

**jamesfog**: "This song is so sexy!! And the dance break in the middle! Lindsay really made a club banger for the ages"

**rickikardashian**: "Very Britney circa the “piece of me” era" (piece of me was released a few years after this)

**SkyBlade79**: "Okay, this starts really bad but the chorus is quite good!"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "another childhood slut anthem"

**SimplyHaunted**: "Such a guilty pleasure song."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented screaming at paparazzi through song"

**twat_brained**: "So THAT'S where Miley got the inspiration for the birdcage in CBT. Also, I appreciate Lindsay's effort, but she should've pulled a Britney and covered a song on this sort of thing instead of making her own."

**awryj**: "She really wants to be Britney"

**omgcow**: "A poor man's version of My Prerogative by Britney Spears, but I still love it"

**VodkaInsipido**: "wow, last thing I expected to do today was giving a 9 to a Lindsay Lohan song"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "yaas drag them Lindsay"

**dropthehammer11**: "BANGER"

**superr_rad**: "see, maybe if yall listened to her back then she might not have went into that whole cocaine phase and she might still be the queen of acting/singer crossover"

**eklxtreme**: "the distortion on these chords lmao this is hardcore and angsty"

# COLD, SHINY, HARD PLASTIC

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "overrated"

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "What even are the vocals here. It's like vintage kiiara and all the chopping isn't good. The beat isn't so good either."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is like Piece of Me, but with In The Zone-era production. It's also even more painful to listen to..."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Never got the hype for this song"

**kappyko**: "? what"

**strawberryswing1**: "I can't stop cringing"

Lindsay worked with Disney from her childhood to her adolescence. She starred in *The Parent Trap*, *Get a Clue*, *Freaky Friday*, *Life Size*, *Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen*, and *Herbie: Fully Loaded*. The story of her life is quite a tragic one, even after all these years I still feel bad for her. I wish I could’ve included the amazing “[Confessions of a Broken Heart (Daughter to Father)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1N7LVnmkH8)” on the rate, but Lindsay’s second album *A Little More Personal (Raw)* isn’t on Spotify. Lindsay owes her label one more record, and she hopes to release that someday.

**Ghost-Quartet**: [I never forgave her for her cover of “Frankie & Johnny” in A Prairie Home Companion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MdWvuFgiZ50) but her songs in this rate were good.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I can't help feeling sorry for Lindsay. I only knew her as a tabloid star when I was a kid, but three years ago I watched Freaky Friday and I was surprised at how talented she was. The media is honestly a piece of shit for targeting her. All the negative attention probably made her problems worse. And I've read about her parents being fucked up, which makes me pity her all the more. I liked her songs in this rate, and while her situation's been extremely depressing, I hope she'll recover.

**jamesfog**: It's sad what happened to Lindsay but I'm glad she's back on the right track

Spring is probably the most "underdog"-esque of the seasons. honestly, it's probably the most diverse and pretty season but the extremes of Summer/Winter are too appealing. plants are growing, you get a mix of pleasing Spring showers with Summer-esque Sun. Spring Break is honestly an overrated break, but it can have its share of fun. also, as many commenters have mentioned, allergies come alive in the flowery Spring. honestly, i'm not entirely sure what the fuck Spring is. I know Summer is hot and sun-kissed, Fall is cool and breezy, Winter is cold and snowy, but Spring?? It's basically Summer lite (but considering what Summer is like sometimes, that's kind of a good thing).

Oh yes, a Disney Channel classic! So beloved by /r/popheads that it got posted as a throwback 3 times. The moment that harpsichord starts the entirety of /r/popheads is instantly hairless. The song’s about going to a club and hooking up with someone - pretty vulgar for a Disney Channel song and refreshingly so. The Radio Disney version changed a lot of the lyrics to make the song kid-friendly.

---

**TragicKingdom1**: "Ryan Tedder was involved with this apparently?" (that is correct)

**calltehshots**: "Ashley should claim Jessica Alba on her taxes."

**gannade**: "this song is jessica alba fantastic!"

# INSTANT CLASSIC

**pochic1996**: "A BLATANT SEX SONG ON DISNEY THIS IS GOLD."

**tevinterimperium**: "The harpsichord has my v*****a shaking."

**poppinmmolly**: "a CLASSIC BOP"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "shit ashley tisdale was way better than i remember"

**dirdbub**: "okay so uh why does this go so hard?? like wow"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Wow this song is like a full out telenovela… took me on a vaguely baroque pop journey. When does the movie adaptation of this come out? I’m there for it."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Iconic, but I honestly thing it's slightly overrated. It's not as memorable as Not Like That or Be Good To Me for me. Come at me."

**Hogwartsreject1912**: "so so sorry Queenranda, but this was waaaayyyyyyy too good to not get an 11. Also, this is hardcore evidence that she should've been the next Britney Spears."

**chili_jones**: "literally everything about this song is perfect goodbye."

**JMez2612**: "This song is really dirty, wtf???"

**lady_sable**: "She did That"

**seferre2**: "britney who?"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "My first hoe jam. This is how I knew I was gay. This was way too inappropriate for 10-year-old me."

**timothy444**: "It's the friendly neighbourhood Ke$ha!"

**jamesfog**: "A MAJOR hoe anthem!"

**SkyBlade79**: "I can’t believe that this Disney person made this slut drop bop so fast!"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "my pre-pubescent slut anthem"

**huntyphobic**: "Hoe anthem of the millennium bitch. Literally inspired an entire generation of hoes."

**SimplyHaunted**: "I may or may not still listen to this on a semi-regular basis."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "deserves a 10 for unleashing the inner slut in millions of children across the nation and making them the hoes they are today"

**omgcow**: "Baby's first hoe anthem"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "THOT basic white girl anthem."

**VodkaInsipido**: "Wow, surprisingly good? Like it screams 2000's but it's so great at it it can pass."

**eklxtreme**: "a trashy bop done right"

**musicotic**: "It's cute I guess"

# THIS IS NOT WHAT I WANT

**fifthchevron**: "This song wanna be Rumours SO BAD. At least she sounds awake, unlike half the vocalists in this rate..."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Kinda forgettable besides that triumphant and wild intro (that eventually returns). Her vocals are kinda not always there and the lyrics aren't anything special."

**therokinrolla**: "sounds like Be Good To Me. its not awful i guess but i would choke myself to it"

**Lexarqade**: "I was fully prepared to give this a 10 or even my 11 but listening to this in the year of our lord twenty seventeen it's quite honestly a hot mess. The rap verses are just plain awful and the background vocals are wrong and super dissonant. If this score prevents it from winning sorry not sorry but damn this is a struggle to go through."

**rickikardashian**: "I gave it a 4 but it stuck with me so fucking much I had to give it at least a 5"

**ImADudeDuh**: "I remembered this better than it really is :emofish:"

**kappyko**: "how can you take a Britney reject and give it to somebody with LESS vocal talent???? ughhhhh I still have no idea if I hate this or not, bc it sounds so corny and her vocals kinda suck but it WORKS. a radio Disney slut anthem and it's unbearably catchy. please don't win."

**dropthehammer11**: "A lot of charisma here but still kinda generic"

**twat_brained**: "This just sounds like a poor pophead's Ke$ha song. She sounds good on the chorus though. Also, the end of the song takes away from me too."

We all know this bop queen as Sharpay from *High School Musical* or Maddie from *The Suite Life of Zack and Cody*. Ashley currently does covers on YouTube with her husband and special guests such as Debby Ryan, Vanessa Hudgens, and Lea Michele. *Headstrong* and *Guilty Pleasure* are both two great, banger-filled records, and I hope to see Ashley return to her professional music career someday.

**Ghost-Quartet**: I always liked Ashley Tisdale but I understand why she peaked during her Disney days, she just doesn’t quite have the chops to make it as an adult. But fortunately she’s managed to keep a pretty healthy career going for herself and nobody can touch the legacy she’s left behind.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I never knew that Sharpay made songs this boppable! Though I consider most of Ashley's tracks featured in this rate to be extremely fun, I can't help but point out the fact that her songs's vocals and production seem to be heavily influenced by Britney. Ashley makes catchy songs, that's for sure, but there doesn't seem to be anything uniquely 'Ashley' about them.

**Hogwartsreject1912**: Robbed of being the next Britney Spears #JusticeForAshley

**seferre2**: yass sharpay slayyyy

**jamesfog**: I don't know why Ashley got the slutty end of the stick, but I'm not complaining about it!

**omgcow**: I neeeed Ashley to come back to pop. She's the best Disney pop girl other than Hilary Duff imo. She had the stage presence and choreo to back it up too. I stan <3

**bwc222**: an underrated disney queen

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Wow, who knew Ashley Tisdale's music would actually sound like something Sharpay would make if she is a pop girl.

I was FLOORED by this song when I first heard it. The production is so beautiful, Miley’s voice sounds amazing, and the lyrics could speak to anyone. I was so surprised that a Hannah Montana song could reach such a level of quality. Anyone who listened to the radio in 2009 must’ve heard this a million times. “The Climb” was Miley’s first Top 5 hit on the Hot 100 - only to be followed by “Party in the USA”, “We Can’t Stop”, and “Wrecking Ball”. The song was nominated for the Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television, or Other Visual Media at the 52nd Grammy Awards but Walt Disney Records rescinded the nomination because “The Climb” was not specifically written for *Hannah Montana: The Movie*. If you watched *American Idol* or *The X Factor* after this song’s release, you might’ve heard the millions of covers of this on those shows. The most notable one was *The X Factor* Season 6’s winner Joe McElderry’s rendition which hit #1 in Ireland, Scotland, and the UK. “The Climb” was tacked on Miley’s *The Time of Our Lives* EP as a bonus track, which was why I included it in the rate despite it being a soundtrack single.

**agentofscranton**: "this song was forever ruined for me when a middle aged woman sang it in karaoke and midway through started vomiting - she kept singing though so props to her i guess"

**superr_rad**: "life's a climb, but the view is great"

# LIFE’S A CLIMB, BUT THE VIEW IS GREAT

**dropthehammer11**: "IT'S THE CLIIIIIIIIMB"

**gannade**: "taylor wishes she did pop country this well"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "could easily be an 11 what an emotional ballad this unironically should have been nominated for best original song at the oscars but instead we got [these flops](http://i.imgur.com/U82Vtjo.png)"

**Nfranklin50**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aq0WUBDCavw"

**fifthchevron**: "I guess this is Not A Girl Not Yet A Woman for late 90s kids? Cuz idk...I see the appeal but it doesn't speak to me at all. Probably the first single to preview what a great singer she would become."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "My mom stans this Miley song, and I can agree. It's a really strong vocal performance, and her delivery is really nice throughout the entire song. I love it when pop songs have really strong verses and this one definitely does."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Used to really dislike this song, but despite still being the generic ballad to end all generic ballads I've learned to appreciate Miley's vocals and the momentum and swell throughout the song."

**calltehshots**: "This song makes me believe in God."

**dirdbub**: "ok dis hard,"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Lowkey one of the best Miley singles in this rate. Miley has country running in her veins (like… Dolly Parton is her godmother) and I wish that she’d just go ahead and embrace that already! That video of her singing “Jolene” has more views than some of her singles in this rate. MC6 better slay us."

**JMez2612**: "This song made my grown ass father cry during the Hannah Montana movie"

**seferre2**: "the greatest ballad to ever exist ever"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "I love scream-singing this in my car."

**timothy444**: "Emotional out of ten. :( :( :("

**rickikardashian**: "This could be easily the best Miley and Disney song. The lyrics are fucking inspirational and the vocals are amazing. The song was for the fucking Hannah Montana movie, like, she didn’t need to go that hard and the bitch came in like a wrecking ball"

**SkyBlade79**: "pretty iconic"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "SO EMOTIONAL SO EMPOWERING"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Invented country music!"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented mountains, making them move, and the other side. Adele is shook."

**awryj**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRudX8s1UwU"

**eklxtreme**: "just the right amount of cheese for a coming-of-age song and a karaoke song"

**musicotic**: "Iconic"

**kappyko**: "i need an adult. this is really emotional but since popheads needs to gag over one comment i'll make it this one. omg this song has me SHOOK!!!! every time i hear "it's the climb" i [sexual action]!!! i wish i could struggle on [not gay male singer]'s big [sexual item]"

**SpanKKy1**: "Imma climb all up on Shawn's dick"

# THE BEST OF NO WORLDS

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Is this the original version of Fight Song"

**therokinrolla**: "as much as i am past that very immature “hate miley bc she is a popular female singer for young girls” phase that every 10 year old goes through, this song doesnt really do it for me"

**lady_sable**: "tbh I'm probably in the minority here, but I'm not the biggest fan of this song? I mean I don't dislike it, but it always felt kind of generic to me."

**Lexarqade**: "I really just could never get into this song, but I never saw the movie or was I a huge fan in general."

**jamesfog**: "Wow, the most iconic ballad of our generation!"

**omgcow**: "No"

**bwc222**: "bland, generic, and far too overrated... miley has MUCH better"

**PM_ME_UR_FAVE_MOVIES**: "overexposure :/"

**twat_brained**: "I still cringe every time I think about singing this at my elementary school talent show."

What a debut single! She literally introduces herself in the song! It’s just so cute and charismatic; Bridgit’s quirky charm back in her Disney’s days was very admirable. The song's chorus is an interpolation of The Delfonics' 1969 single ”Ready or Not Here I Come (Can't Hide from Love)" (which was also famously interpolated in Fugee’s “Ready or Not” - so no, Bridgit did **not** steal from The Fugees as people might allege).

Bridgit Mendler, star of *Wizards of Waverly Place*, *Good Luck Charlie*, and *Lemonade Mouth*, and one of the queens of /r/popheads, released her debut album *Hello My Name Is…* in 2012. I quite liked the album - it had a unique flair to it compared to other Disney girl debuts, but the new direction Bridgit has taken since she went indie is way more interesting. We all know how well her *Nemesis* EP performed in the EP rate, and I’m glad that she also made it into the top ten in this rate! Bridgit recently released a few songs this year, and she is planning an album to follow up last year’s EP. I absolutely cannot wait for her next album!

**RANK**:

- #8 - Ready or Not - 8.160
- #38 - Hurricane - 7.442

**Ghost-Quartet**: I can’t wait for her to drop an album. Her songs with Disney were nice and all but everything from Nemesis and the following singles is amazing. I didn’t like Good Luck Charlie though.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Bridgit was this good before Atlantis?! I'm honestly shook. The songs featured here are pretty sweet.

Invented being Miley. This was actually released as a single twice - as her debut single from *Hannah Montana 2: Meet Miley Cyrus* and the [Rock Mafia remix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJDC3Gg-F8w) as the second single from *Breakout*. The live performance of the song at the 2007 Disney Channel Games was used as the song’s music video. I wonder if Miley’s still best friends with Leslie.

It is literally a national tragedy that this never got a real music video! I honestly wish I could change my name to Leslie."

**Lexarqade**: "Classic Miley. Every 13 year old girl was both confused and shook when this was dropped but I'm glad she decided to focus on this sound. And who didn't scream the chorus to this at their grade 8 dances tbh"

**SkyBlade79**: "ICONIC SHIT ONLY"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "what an iconic break-out song"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "ok i just heard the video version and think it’s overproduced, but still giving a 10 bc the studio version is a bop"

**musicotic**: "From the very beginning, my body told me bop, and it was not wrong"

# screaming

**Ghost-Quartet**: "My housemate walked in on me listening to this and instantly said “that song is apparently about Nick Jonas” and I was shook. Not that the song was about Nick Jonas, but that she was able to recognize this lemon by hearing it. Would not recommend."

Zendaya’s debut single was a breath of fresh air and in my opinion deserves to rank this high. This electro-R&B gem and its video really channeled Cassie’s “Me & U”. The song was a decent hit, but it still deserved better. This got a **huge** amount of 11s compared to the other songs in this rate. So many of you guys were campaigning for it! Spider-Man’s impact, I guess (and the song probably also got this far because it is pretty damn spectacular). Seeing Zendaya, Bridgit, and Sabrina make it to the final day of the rate made me happy that I decided to include the newer Disney girls in the rate. We love fresh talent!

# WANNA PUT THIS SONG ON REPLAY

**PuggleMaster**: "HER BEST SONG I'M LIVING WIG WIG WIG"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "THIS SONG IS SO GOOD OH MYGOD"

**fifthchevron**: "Heard this on the radio one day by chance, thought it was Cassie. The verses are almost too sparse and forgettable, but the chorus is awesome. The video is amazing and I would never guess it was her first. Still, the song shows up her vocals for how weak they are. Stick to acting and generally slaying the game, gurl."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Really love the production on this electro-R&B bop! it's a lot more mature than the average Disney star debut."

**therokinrolla**: "this song is surprisingly great!! Oml. The production is fire, she serves vocals, the song isn’t incredibly cliche, holy shit!! Good one Zendaya."

**chili_jones**: "im snatched honestly this is good"

**lady_sable**: "I want to put this song on replay"

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "THIS SONG CLEARLY DESERVED BETTER."

**timothy444**: "Shameless plug: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=au98eoXugrs (that's my mashup btw)"

**Lexarqade**: "Zendaya deserves more."

**jamesfog**: "Iconic radio smash"

**SkyBlade79**: "Iconic song that was one of the first songs that I ever really loved. I adore that very electronic-heavy production, and the way it all just explodes in the chorus. Zendaya’s voice just WORKS here, and I don’t think I’ll ever get tired of this song."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "LOVE"

**kappyko**: "a great electropop banger that gives alt R&B teas, what with the bass and effects. so cute"

**dropthehammer11**: "Is this pop perfection? I believe so"

**twat_brained**: "I never quite understood all the hype for this song. Having seen the video, I totally get it now. Go 'Daya!"

**eklxtreme**: "the chorus is lovely, it should just be that on repeat"

**musicotic**: "Amazing bop"

# PAUSE

**mokitsu**: "/u/kappyko"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I really like Zendaya for a lot of reasons. Her music is not among them. Naming a song “Replay” is tacky, especially when we hold it up against the myriad of songs in this rate with actual replay value, but that being said I do kinda like this."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Would not put this song on replay"

**JMez2612**: "It's okay, but It's disgustingly generic"

**mirandacrocsgrove**: "It’s such a personal turnoff when a song contains the lyrics “I don’t know” especially when it’s obvious in the context that the writers don’t seem to know how to end a phrase."

# IYAZ

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "The Iyaz song was better but this is okay."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Omg Iyaz is fucking SHOOK"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "Iyaz was found dead"

**superr_rad**: "ZENGAYA QUEEN OF THE ZENGAYS IYAZ WHO????"

# SPIDER-MAN

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Genuinely, this is my favorite song among the newer Disney stars, post Miley-Demi-Selena era. Something about this has a lot of commercial appeal and it's still genuinely so good to the point I don't see this as a Disney bop at all. It's kinda like Run Away with Me sort of, although RAWM is still levels ahead. Also, imma replay the entire Spider-Man: Homecoming movie thanks. :meghan:"

Zendaya, star of *Shake It Up* and *K.C. Undercover*, is known to many by her social media presence and her acting roles. She is currently one of the most followed celebrities on Instagram. Zendaya recently had a role in *Spider-Man: Homecoming* and got great reception of her part. She will be starring in the Hugh Jackman curated musical film *The Greatest Showman* alongside Hugh Jackman, Rebecca Ferguson, Michelle Williams, and Zac Efron. She’s not the best singer, but her music is very mature and full of gems. Her self titled debut album had a lot of potential singles; unfortunately the era ended with one single.

It's funny that one of her songs is 6th from the bottom of the rate and the other one is 6th from the top.

**RANK**:

- #6 - Replay - 8.360
- #70 - Something New ft. Chris Brown - 5.530

---
**dirdbub**: only spoke iconic lines in Spiderman

**Ghost-Quartet**: I like Zendaya, I think thanks to her insane dance abilities she’s one of the most clearly defined “triple threats” to ever matriculate through the Disney system. I will admit to not being a huge fan of her acting or singing styles, but she’s expressed interest in becoming a producer in the future and I think that’s a good avenue for her to pursue. She seems like a sweet, informed person who’s proven herself to be a force of good in the world, even if I don’t necessarily listen to her music or see her movies I’m excited to see what she does next.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I don't really like her music but she seems to be a decent actor and a great person

**jamesfog**: An actress!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Zendaya is the queen of the following: Pop, Disney, Marvel, Twitter and being woke. Khaleesi is shook by these queen titles! What I said is true and you Kelly Anne Conways can eat my ass for trying to disprove that.

A sweet embracing song that is Demi's best performing song on the rate. Even though it didn’t go top ten in the US, it went to #1 on the radio. The sweetness of the song, the adorable music video, the strings and piano, I love it all! I also **love** [this remix of the song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dHfw2BFC1XM) that Demi used to perform on tour. “Who’s That Boy” featuring “Like a G6” chanteuse Dev was supposed to be the second single from *Unbroken*, but it was scrapped due to Dev’s pregnancy. So I guess we can thank Dev for one of Demi’s biggest hits. GYHAB was done dirty on the 2012 rate, so I’m glad it got its redemption this time around.

# GAVE DEMI’S HEART A BREAK

**Leixander**: "GOAT Demi song imo."

**poppinmmolly**: "This was my JAM back in 2012"

**fifthchevron**: "I knew this song but had no idea it was Demi."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I had to really decide between this and Love Me Like A Love Song, and I really like Selena much better than Demi but I can't deny this song at all. It's probably the only song in the rate I still hum years later, and it was one of the first pop songs I was really in love with when I first heard it. Everything about this song is fantastic, and everything comes and leaves at the perfect times. It's probably her best song, at least in my opinion."

**TragicKingdom1**: "I don't really know how to describe it but every element of this song works together perfectly. Love the overall maturity that this song expresses."

**dirdbub**: "strings: **ENHANCE**"

**therokinrolla**: "demi needs to give my scalp a break"

**Hogwartsreject1912**: "This song is just perfection."

**lady_sable**: "I've been scalped."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "My Favorite Demi Lovato Song. Deserved much better in my rate."

**Lexarqade**: "Have a break, have a kit kat."

**jamesfog**: "Iconic radio hit"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "her hair in this video is goals af"

**huntyphobic**: "Peaked at #16, while Body Say peaked at #84…….. and y’all say talent never wins "

**ImADudeDuh**: "tbh not that bad"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "invented kindness to your significant other and clever wordplay"

**omgcow**: "Peak Demi tbh"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Man, if I could give multiple 11s on this rate, this song would be one of them. This is honestly my favorite song from Demi."

**PM_ME_UR_FAVE_MOVIES**: "FINALLY A GOOD DEMI TRACK FUCK"

**kappyko**: "omg omg omg i didn't know this song was in the rate"

**twat_brained**: "Ah, yes. One of the last few good Demi songs in recent memory☕️"

**superr_rad**: "one of her best singles, does the voice crack in the final chorus give anyone else chills???"

**eklxtreme**: "her vocals are so good here and the song is so damn catchy"

**musicotic**: "Another iconic bop"

# BROKE HER HEART

**MNREDR**: "I hate this song and I wish I could give it a negative. Sorry (not sorry)." ([this plot twist](http://i.imgur.com/MhS5UG6.png))

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Honestly this song annoys me. I know that Demi is better than this, she’s demonstrated that she’s capable of writing more interesting melodies and more impactful lyrics, this is her throwing together a bunch of hooks into a cutesy non-threatening song in a bid for commercial success. I’d be lying if I said I didn’t like the string arrangement though, and strings it does pull at my heartstrings a little. I also love the video, Demi is so gloriously p(r)etty in it and that shit eating grin that she flashes the camera at the end is pure gold. Still, definitely on the lower tier of the Demi Lovato singles."

**chili_jones**: "ugh this song has that 2011/2012 pop sound that i hate"

# EPISODE

**letsallpoo**: "when i played the demi story in the episode app the instrumental to this was used in like every scene transition and it was TOO MUCH"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Throwback when I literally heard this song and Cool For The Summer 24/7 when I played the Demi stories on Episode"

I recently saw Demi live at Good Morning America and I told her about the rate, and she said “D e l e t e  i t  f a t before I fuck you up” then she flicked me! Jokes aside, you all know how much I love Demi. She’s an amazing vocalist, an inspiring person, a Grammy-nominated artist, and a /r/popheads rate winner. She’s currently recording her sixth studio album, which will be released under Island Records instead of Hollywood Records and will draw inspiration from R&B and soul music as opposed to the dance-pop that was on *Confident*.

**Ghost-Quartet**: I think the Demi Lovato “delete it fat” saga is one of the absolute funniest things I’ve ever heard of. But of the major working Disney pop stars these days, I have a special fondness for Demi Lovato. She’s consistent. I’ve never heard a Demi Lovato song that I thought was bad, she’s actually kind of underrated as a songwriter. Confident is on repeat for me constantly, so many great songs on that album, and all of her features on singles are quite good too. She has a fantastic voice. I almost bought an outfit from her sportswear line. She’s one of my go-to artists in the pop scene right now and you can tell she’s hungry for critical and commercial success, and I hope that she finds it.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I'm a bit 'eh' on Demi. A lot of her songs are bops, but sometimes her vocals and her personality in general are a bit too much for me. I do legitimately admire her for overcoming a lot of shit at such a young age, though.

**jamesfog**: One of the best singers to come out of Disney, wew a powerhouse vocalist

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Suprising fact for popheads. I used to be a low-key stan of Demi Lovato during her Sonny with a Chance days and that was my peak. After Unbroken, I sort of unstanned her because I feel....a bit distant from her. Not that I have anything aganist Demi anymore, it's just wasn't the same. I prefer her Disney bops over her newer ones tbh. :sad:

Selena’s breakout hit - there couldn’t have been a better introduction than this song. The chorus just explodes and shakes every bone in my body. I didn’t really know or care about Selena until I heard this song and every follicle on my head was torn off. This to me remains to be one of Selena’s absolute best songs. I didn’t expect it to get this far, but I’m glad it did.

**ImADudeDuh**: "Fuck all those pearls she wears in the video, her necklace has way too many pearls and it has always made me mad about it."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "**YOU ARE THUNDER AND IIII AM THE LIGHTNAAAAAAANNNNNG AND I LOVE THE WAY YOU KNOW WHO YOU ARE AND TO ME IT'S EXCITAAAAAAAAAAAAAANG WHEN YOU KNOW IT'S MEANT TO BE** this song is just *naturally* a bop"

**fifthchevron**: "This was the first Selener song I liked. I think this song shows off her voice really effectively, too."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "I love her delivery of "it takes my breath away," but like this song is so sugary at times it's great."

**calltehshots**: "I remember this song first coming out and literally ripping the skin off my head until I was just brain. I never really paid attention to Selena before this masterpiece but this song is the start of a legendary bop maker and I've been beyond shook ever since."

**dirdbub**: "way too good to be real"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "I spent an embarrassingly long amount of time on Google trying to find a copy of that black dress that she wears in the video for this song because that is a LOOK. Upon playing this I knew most of the lyrics and I have no clue why. One of the few songs in this rate that I could imagine potentially injuring myself dancing to. This is just such a well structured song it flows so naturally."

**Everyone** thought this would be an easy win for the girls, and for a while it was. It’s a great pop song with production that really stands out. The autotune was a stylistic choice that worked for the song’s quirkiness. The song is a warning for a boy who’s fucking around in a relationship. It breaks the fourth wall by saying this is quite literally a (potential) breakup song written for you. This was Hollywood Records’ biggest hit before Miley emerged into the pop scene. The song was critically acclaimed for its bombast and its adventurous sound compared to most Disney Channel singles.

This is tied with "Dancing Crazy" for the most 11s of the rate.

---

**letsallpoo**: "i would like to note that i was the first person to post a throwback for this on the sub"

**dirdbub**: "\*puts on witch mask, gets ready to trick or treat\* hgey guys"

# ICONIC

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "This was ranked the 9th best song of 2007 by Time, was the highest selling single by a Hollywood Records artist at the time, and Aly & AJ have a page in the ABC's of /r/popheads for this song. Your faves are trembling as we speak from this level of iconic."

# POTENTIAL BREAKUP BOP

**NapsAndNetflix**: "I will be SHOCKED if this isn't at least top 5, can easily see this winning. It's too much of a bop, who could give this less than a 10?"

**awhile2**: "Braces?!"

**tevinterimperium**: ""Let me repeat that, I want my stuff back" wig fuckin blown to smithereens"

**poppinmmolly**: "a near perfect song"

**AbnormalPopPunk**: "a strong contender for my 11, easily one of the best songs in the rate"

**calltehshots**: "Not only their best song but one of the best Disney channel songs ever. Queens of repeating that and getting their stuff back."

**Ghost-Quartet**: "You know, my ex-boyfriend forgot my birthday too, so I vibe with this song. Aly & AJ had bops, but this was the song that cemented their place in the pantheon of “beloved child stars.” Their most iconic song by a mile, this is the one that proved to the world that these girls really had what it took and immortalized them in our childhoods."

**JMez2612**: "I never heard the song until the rate, but its nice"

**lady_sable**: "An iconic bop, one of the best pop songs of the 2000s. Those lyrics just perfectly embody the spirit of "fuck you." If this doesn't win you're all straight."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Literal perfection."

**Lexarqade**: "A. Fucking. Banger. This absolutely should have blown up way more than it should have. If I had any relationships to end I would absolutely do it with this song. Also "My Stupid Birthday" is an iconic line but I replace "Stupid" with "Fucking" everytime because you know it's obviously supposed to say that."

**jamesfog**: "This played SO much on Radio Disney! The quintessential Disney song, ICONIC use of autotune. Just an all around outstanding song"

**rickikardashian**: "I never realized how dumb the lyrics were, but this is honestly such a nice bop my asshole loves it. Also I love the 4th wall breaking with “Our album needs just one”."

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "what a banger"

**huntyphobic**: "my wig still hasn’t fully recovered from 10 years ago when this track dropped….. Aly & AJ truly did THAT!"

**SimplyHaunted**: "IT WAS HER BIRTHDAY. HER STUPID BIRTHDAY."

**ImADudeDuh**: "Holy fuck this was such a bop."

**omgcow**: "Invented breakups and meta songwriting"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I mean, giving this song a really low score is not an option here when this song goes hard."

**dropthehammer11**: "M Y S T U P I D B I R T H D A Y. Also invented auto tune"

**twat_brained**: "THIS FUCKING GOES AWF! It should've gone at least top 10, hopefully you gays will give it the respect it deserves."

**eklxtreme**: "I love the way they sing the "this is our potential breakup song" part"

**musicotic**: "Great song, just not the most memorable?"

**kappyko**: "WOW, I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS DIDN'T WIN!!! I'M ANGRY!!! I HATE MYSELF.”

# POTENTIAL BREAKUP FLOP

**fifthchevron**: "Great verses but again, chorus is just dull and weird. The production sounds hella outdated and immature. For such sharp verses, they should've really elevated the chorus and gone straight for the jugular. Like Chemicals React, it reads like Taylor Swift lite."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Dated, and unfortunately, not in a good way. The beat is nice at times, but annoying in others. The moment they drop the "potential breakup song" line is pretty cool, however."

**TragicKingdom1**: "I like how it has multiple hooks but the production is pretty dated."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "Overrated, the chorus is catchy and 'I want my stuff back' is a great meme but I don't like anything else about this song much tbh"

**therokinrolla**: "well that was disappointing af. Never heard this song before now and it really is their worst song in this rate. Probably because i dont have the nostalgia. No wonder they broke up oop"

**timothy444**: "I don't know if the autotune makes it better or worse..."

**SkyBlade79**: "Their voices are so autotuned, the lyrics are such trash (“my stupid birthday”), and this song is just so overhyped that I can’t help but hate it. Just doesn’t deserve all of the overhyping."

**VodkaInsipido**: "do people really like this song? or is it a meme? because this is just NOT™ GOOD™, it's obnoxious and annoying"

**BreezySeason**: "what is this autotune"

**awryj**: "The verses and the post-chorus section ("This is the potential breakup song...") are of course great but the chorus is a little bit too weak. Maybe it's just me. I dunno, it's definitely great but I feel like it's missing something, another hook maybe?"

fall is not entirely the season for me tbh. it's probably the most stressful season in terms of workload, and the weather gets unbearably breezy and sometimes gloomy and cloudy. sure, it probably has the least extreme weather patterns, but that's just not my style. but i do like certain parts of the fall aesthetic like the leaves, the pumpkin shit, the general crispness, etc. and Halloween/Thanksgiving are killer holidays (Thanksgiving Break is probably my favorite seasonal break behind Winter Break), but the rest of the season (which is a big portion of it) feels like a middling precursor to winter. even though i'm in the lowest scores for this, i'm still glad it placed high.

ok honestly, you guys need better seasonal taste. this is the BEST season. it's mainly because of Christmas, but like Christmas is one of the best holidays ever, cold take, and with that the aesthetic is just so warm and cozy whilst being adventurous + starry nights and optimism, redemption, the fantasies the working class struggle, etc. winter/icy landscape photos are also lowkey my aesthetic. there's also the sadness to winter, but the melancholy makes it all the more worthwhile imo. the end of winter is great too, seeing melted snow on a beautiful spring is a blissful feeling. i do get that it has it's share of shit, though. one could argue christmas is a curtain to hide a bunch of stuff, including how terrible humans are, and how the homeless person that you didn't see is still out there even colder than ever. but winter has truly seen some of the best moments of my life, just personally speaking, but i can live with it losing the popular votes. also, this controversy score is INSANE lmao.

The iconic sister duo blessed pop music and /r/popheads with a classic! Everyone thought PBUS was sure to win the rate, but it’s thought to be dated or overproduced to some users. Still, props to the girls for getting so far and doing so well in the rate! Alyson starred in *Phil of the Future* and the DCOM *Picture This*. AJ starred in the Walt Disney film *Secretariat*. The two starred together in the DCOM *Cow Belles*. They both are still active in their acting careers, with Aly starring in *iZombie* and AJ starring in *The Goldbergs* and *Steven Universe*. The girls are known for being very religious - I still can’t believe that they openly opposed [evolution being taught in schools](https://web.archive.org/web/20081218214041/http://www.blender.com/guide/articles.aspx?id=1937) 💀 The girls just released an amazing new single titled “Take Me” off their highly anticipated upcoming EP.

**RANK**:

- #3 - Potential Breakup Song - 8.749
- #14 - Like Whoa - 7.944
- #30 - Chemicals React - 7.536
- #39 - Rush - 7.430

---
**Ghost-Quartet**: It’s sad to me that Aly & AJ’s career free of Disney has been stymied so because for me it was always apparent that as musicians they were bigger than the Disney label. Their songs always felt a lot more mature and edgier than something that you’d expect from Disney stars, and they went in such an artistically interesting direction after leaving the Disney umbrella. I hope their new album works out for them.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I've heard a lot of people gush about how talented Aly and AJ are as a duo, but I've never had the chance to check them out until now. I enjoy the pop rock sound they seem to be emulating on these songs, and overall I'm pleasantly surprised by what I've heard. I'll be sure to examine the rest of their discography someday. Someday...

**seferre2**: maybe i'm too young but i don't know who aly and aj are? don't roast me i only know them for potential breakup song i'm only 16

**jamesfog**: Aly & AJ's music was a big part of my childhood, and I am so excited for their comeback!

**omgcow**: Cowbells was a good movie

**bwc222**: i'm so ready for an aly & aj comeback oml

**kappyko**: isn't it weird that aly & aj were barely even disney girls? they were on hollywood records, yes, but they only appeared on a single movie iirc. same for lindsay lohan but who cares

**twat_brained**: The greatest musical act not named Jonas

There is an additional requirement that you have to be 18+ so that way we get a good rate where Selena Gomez doesn't inexplicably somehow beat Potential Breakup Song, He Said She Said, and all of Hilary Duff and Miranda (seriously HOW????!!!!!)

Selena secures the #2 spot of the Disney/Nickelodeon Singles Rate! LYLALS spent 20 weeks on top of the Russian chart and it went 4x platinum in the US. Lady Gaga called this “[the best pop song of [2012]](https://twitter.com/ladygaga/status/264560496106143744?lang=en)”. The music video is one of my favorites of all time - it’s so weird, entrancing, and colorful. The video was supposed to have horses painted with non-toxic pink paint, but P!nk came across the set and called out the use of painted horses. The infectious repetition and the dark dubstep production make the song a perfect pop song to me. 

Poor Selena, maybe next time you’ll win the rate.

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "Nevermind, this is the best synth in the whole rate. It's so goddamn good, and this song is perfect Selena - where she sings over a beat that is heavily electronic, definitely s lot more daring than a lot of the music on the radio at the time. And the chorus is one of her best. Serious 11 contender."

**mokitsu**: "this is one of selena's most iconic and timeless songs, with an iconic music video as well, i love the strings that come around the second verse and the magnetic beat in the chorus"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Probably Selena's best song...such great instrumentation I can overlook the nonsensical lyrics."

**dirdbub**: "how can you hate this song?"

**huntyphobic**: "and i keep making it skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet skeet"

**SimplyHaunted**: "I pretended to hate this song when it came out because I was in my "Selena Gomez sux" phase, but I do hate how damn catchy it is."

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "queen of love songs, Taylor Swift's discography could never"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I'll just ignore the fact that this song is about Bieber."

**VodkaInsipido**: "JESUS YESSSSSSSSS THIS SONG GOT OUT OF MY HEAD AT SOME POINT OF MY LIFE AND NOW IT'S BACK FUCKING YES LOVE YOU SKIDDOS"

**kappyko**: "vapid ass bass wobbles but kinda catchy"

**dropthehammer11**: "beep beep SO LET'S RIDE"

**twat_brained**: "This song is actually just as good as I remember it to be, and it also gets a boost from me for the music video's aesthetics. I wasn't a big fan of my sister obsessing over it though :/"

**awryj**: "I love you like a love song babby"

**superr_rad**: "i hated this at first, i thought love you like a love song was kinda stupid, but i see the point now, and paired with the video this is a pop masterpiece."

**eklxtreme**: "I always thought the womping synths didn't really fit, though the song is still catchy"

**musicotic**: "There is a Just Dance for this, and it's amazing"

# I DON’T LOVE THIS LIKE A LOVE SONG

**JMez2612**: "It's not good enough to be a seven, it's overrated"

**BearlyEvenAPun**: "I just really can't stand this song tbh. It never really does anything interesting, her pronunciation on the chorus is rough, and it's like it's the same few notes on repeat (peat-peat-peat-peat-peat)"

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "tbh i don't have a fetish for this song like everyone else seems too" (love that pun)

---

**Overall average**: 7.915 **// Total points:** 633.2 **// [Averages](https://pastebin.com/SK562yS3)**

---

I guess we had men in the rate because of Selena’s band members. The band’s creation was inspired by Paramore and Forever the Sickest Kids. Selena originally wanted to form a band just named The Scene until Hollywood Records convinced her to attach her name to the band’s name. The band was only really “scene” for their first album. After “Naturally” blew up, the band went in a dance-pop direction. Selena recently explained that after *When the Sun Goes Down* she felt that she could do things on her own and that being surrounded by music industry professionals helped her. Selena’s work with Hollywood Records is completely different from her work with Interscope imo. She’s managed to develop a unique sound (whisper pop) and image (chic art hoe) that cultivated a lot of success. She also actually writes on her own songs now.

Selena Gomez & the Scene and Aly & AJ are tied for the highest artist average.

**RANK**:

- #2 - Love You Like a Love Song - 9.014
- #4 - Naturally - 8.678
- #13 - Who Says - 7.950
- #19 - A Year Without Rain - 7.801
- #21 - Tell Me Something I Don't Know - 7.744
- #23 - Hit the Lights - 7.686
- #37 - Round & Round - 7.446
- #48 - Falling Down - 7.000

---
**Ghost-Quartet**: Who the heck are “The Scene?” I actually bothered to read the Wikipedia page for them and it turns out Selena originally didn’t want her name attached to the project and just wanted to be a member of a band called “The Scene” but the Hollywood Records pushed her to include her own name in the band title, which was a smart choice. None of the other band members have their own Wikipedia page so I know nothing about them. That being said, it’s telling to me that Selena has one of the most followed Instagram accounts because that’s always been the edge over her peers: her taste and her consistency. In terms of quality more than a lot of the other artists in the rate she managed to consistently put out good, memorable singles, some of which were quite ahead of their time. Of the major Disney stars in the game, hers is the artistic growth that I’m most excited to follow.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Can the whisper memes end already? Yes, Selena is not by any means a superb singer, but her music is extremely interesting and fun to listen to. She had a smoother transition from Disney alumni to adult pop star than Demi or Miley did, and she seems like a really nice girl. The 'I don't pick sides' thing is problematic and whatever the Come And Get It video was was too, but otherwise, I can't understand why anybody would outright dislike her. Critically acclaimed queen.

**Hogwartsreject1912**: Oh boy. So many 10s incoming from literally everyone.

**jamesfog**: Why did they stick Selena in a band tho lmao ctfu

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: Selena's music definitely got better as time progressed. I am so proud of her! Now where is the album Selena???

When the rate first started, there were some random exchanges for the number 1 spot - “Kissin U”, “Who Says”, “Give Your Heart a Break”, and “Potential Breakup Song” all went #1 at some point. Then Selena started to dominate with “Naturally” and “Love You Like a Love Song”. “Party in the USA” quickly took over, and as it kept getting 10s it became more and more invincible. This song has the most 10s of any rate. This is also the rate winner with the least 11s (literally just one 11).

This is unarguably the most iconic song on the rate. It is the millenial national anthem. It makes everyone happy. It unites everyone. It gets revived every Memorial Day and Fourth of July. Fun fact: the song had a resurgence after Osama Bin Laden’s death. I am thoroughly convinced that everyone knows the lyrics to this song. The song was originally written by Jessie J and Dr. Luke for Jessie’s album. Jessie decided not to record the song, so it was tweaked and recorded by Miley. The lyrics were reworked to fit the theme of Miley’s Walmart clothing line. When the song was released, Miley admitted that she never heard a Jay-Z song (I’m sure that’s changed by now). The song debuted and peaked at #2 on the Hot 100. Miley’s performance of this at the Teen Choice Awards caused a huge controversy because she danced on a pole. She later clarified that she needed to hold onto the pole, and that the pole dancing was not intentional. That controversy sounds so innocuous now that *Bangerz* and *Dead Petz* happened.

###Miley is the winner of the /r/popheads Disney Channel/Nickelodeon Singles Rate!

# NODDIN MY HEAD LIKE YEAH

**kappyko**: "this is the only acceptable winner, asides from the rest of the inevitable PBUS/Like Whoa/Replay/Party in the USA top 4. this song is amazingly fun and genuinely quality pop. good mixing, too, i love how crisp that opening guitar is. if this doesn't make top 5, popheads doesn't deserve clean pop."

**seferre2**: "i can't see an outcome where party in the usa doesn't win"

**NapsAndNetflix**: "my friend liked this song so much when it was at its peak that he named his dog miley"

**awhile2**: "as much as i dont want this to be the winning song i cant give it anything less than a 10"

**Nfranklin50**: "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HG78FXhdig0"

**tevinterimperium**: "It's been 8 years and this song has been played at least once at every party in Nashville I've been to. And everyone loves to scream "IT'S DEFINITELY NOT A NASHVILLE PARTY" even though it literally is a Nashville party. I don't understand it, but I don't question it either. Anyways, Queen of patriotism!!!!"

**fifthchevron**: "Taking points off for her not knowing a Jay Z song irl. It's still fun as hell though and namedrops Britney so..."

**ThatParanoidPenguin**: "This was easily the Miley song that made me from a casual Miley listener to someone who scrambled to buy this song when it came out. It's like the best song she's ever done, possibly, and while it's slightly dated, it's hella charming. It's honestly a nice progression from country-influenced Miley to the massive popstar she is today. While I found most of Bangerz to be mediocre, and Dead Petz to be abhorrent, Party in the USA is just a really nice party song, with some substance in the lyrics, and a definitely feeling of growth in the singer as well as in the duration of the song."

**mokitsu**: "i've never been to the USA but i hope this is a perfect encapsulation of america"

**calltehshots**: "This is what the Declaration of Independence sounds like. This is my national anthem. Hearing "And a Britney song was on!" every July 4th makes me proud to be an American. Thank you Mileysus."

**dirdbub**: "every single kid at my all boys, Conservative, Jesuit, straight as fuck high school knows every single word to this song and I think that's beautiful"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is the song that elevated Britney to legend status tbh"

**therokinrolla**: "this is a 10 to because when I FINALLY left the southeast for the first time and went to california with my friends, as we were stepping of the plane at L.A.X. we put this song on and started singing it and it was cute and fun and sooooo gay and it is a really happy and fun memory for me <3"

**chili_jones**: "100% classic"

**JMez2612**: "Miley became president of the United States with this song, Trump who?"

**lady_sable**: "Wow, this brings back memories. It's such a fun, feel-good song, and sometimes I hear it out in public and I still know all the words after 8 years."

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: "Invented America. I don't know how anyone could hate this song."

**jamesfog**: "I can't believe Miley invented our country's National Anthem"

**rickikardashian**: "This is pop excellence"

**huntyphobic**: "where were you when in 2009 Miley Cyrus founded the United States of America?"

**ImADudeDuh**: "Invented people killing Osama Bin Laden"

**THE_PC_DEMANDS_BLOOD**: "please stand for the national anthem of the united states of america"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "NOTHING BUT RESPECT FOR THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, MILEY CYRUS!!!!"

**VodkaInsipido**: "the chorus hits like a train"

**dropthehammer11**: "okay in all seriousness who doesnt know this song by heart"

**twat_brained**: "Not since "Come Clean" has anyone released such an iconic and everlasting tune at the ripe old age of 16. Nothing but respect for **MY** national anthem!"

**awryj**: "The most Dr Lukest song ever"

**superr_rad**: "as far as im concerned, this is the bop of the century. like honestly how is this not the national anthem?"

**eklxtreme**: "as overplayed as this was back then, I can't deny how much of a bop this is, and it's just timeless"

**musicotic**: "4th of July song"

# i’ll take my party elsewhere

**TragicKingdom1**: "Never liked this as much as other people, Miley's vocals are pretty grating and I think it's pretty obvious it wasn't written for her. I do like the guitar riff though."

**SkyBlade79**: "Completely overrated, really not that great. It’s memorable, sure, but not remarkable."

**Lexarqade**: "As a Canadian, it's required by law that I dock a couple of points off of this song."

**omgcow**: "Obnoxious"

# THE REAL WINNER OF THE RATE

**sweetnsoursauce1**: "IF THIS MAKES THE TOP 10 ILL SHARE PICTURES OF MY ASS"

deleted: ### A JOURNEY FROM START TO FINISH

**Ghost-Quartet**: "Okay so here’s my “Party in the USA” story: So at college I was in this weird little show in our black box theatre. It was called Under Construction and it’s a weird concept play by Charles Mee, and it’s in the public domain and it’s just a collection of unconnected vignettes loosely connected by the theme of “America.” There is no set order for the scenes nor is it set which scenes are in the show, in fact the script is just a suggestion and you’re supposed to change it around and make it your own. And boy, did we. Our director was somewhat crazy and he ran with it and the show was incomprehensible and pretentious and I felt really bad for the audience. Everyone played a bunch of parts and it was a lot of fun to be in and it was an incoherent mess. But between scenes we had transitionary songs playing, American classics from a variety of sources. So after the “Anita Bryant time travels to the past to convince a gay boy to come out of the closet so he’ll be killed” scene we transitioned immediately into the “21st century gay boy vlogs about his weird nightmare involving sexy cat people” and me and some girls were the sexy cat people, acting out his dream. But it was weird because we weren’t dressed like cat people, we were dressed like fetish pornstars because the blog scene transitions immediately into the “I Am A Woman” scene wherein me and three girls are lesbian porn stars and we all have to present ourselves one by one to a 1970’s businessman, reciting the book jackets of lesbian pulp novels by Ann Bannon to him to try to get him to watch our specific porn, before he ultimately rejects all of us and we all sit onstage and watch a scene from On the Waterfront followed by us ironically singing a barbershop quartet to a sexual assault survivor. But before all of this happened my friend and I had to wait sidestage for our entrance, and the transitionary song that played under the other scene while we were waiting was “Party in the USA.” We just had so much fun dancing to that, especially because my ex-boyfriend was on the crew for the show so I had to see him the whole time and we had just recently broken up and he was my first ever boyfriend and after we broke up I made a fool of myself begging him to get back with me but he almost immediately starting dating a girl and I was really beaten up about it and my friend knew that so she and I goofed around a lot during the show because she was trying to cheer me up because she knew I was in a bad place and she’s a good friend. So the point is, my opinions on this song are tinged by my memories of waiting in a small dark room with the prop box dressed as a lesbian dominatrix pornstar in a black pleather minidress, thigh high black plastic high heeled boots, and a biker cap, holding a riding crop, absolutely GETTING MY LIFE jamming out silently to “Party in the USA” with my friend. It’s a memory that I really treasure for a lot of reasons, so I guess you could say I’m biased. But I’m still pretty sure it’s a banger. Fun fact: This song was initially intended for Jessie J. but deemed “not edgy enough.” Then Miley pole danced on that ice cream truck. It was a simpler time."

Our rate winner, the ever-so-controversial Miley Cyrus redeemed herself from the last rate. She has 3 songs in the top ten, one of which of course won the rate! *Hannah Montana* was Disney Channel’s biggest success, even one of the random soundtrack songs hit the top ten on the Hot 100. Miley herself has 8 top ten hits in the US, 9 if you include “He Could Be the One”. She’s also the only ex-act with a #1 hit on the Hot 100. I was not expecting her to do this well after you all did her dirty on the last rate, but she came through this time. Miley’s sixth studio album *Younger Now* comes out September 29. I’m always amazed by how huge her career is. Congrats, Miley!

**RANK**:

- #1 - Party in the USA - 9.260

**Ghost-Quartet**: I think Miley Cyrus is so talented and she has no clue what to do with it. She’s something of an industry princess, she can do basically anything and get away with it because she’s rich, a fact which she takes full advantage of. She shifts genres with basically every album since her Hannah Montana days ended and it’s kind of exhausting. I liked a lot of Bangerz (though it took me a while to get used to) but she faced so much blowback for making a hip hop flavored album that she jumped ship and released Dead Petz, which was a bad album that I also kinda liked because it had some good songs (am I the only one who loved “BB Talk?” I thought the video was fun) and now with her next album she’s shifting back more towards country and traditional pop. She has a great voice and she can write a song (the quality of the songs varies but it is a skill that she possesses) and I really liked “Malibu” so maybe she’ll finally settle down… until the next album.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Miley can be really white at times, but she also seems really chill and genuine. I'm really looking forward to her new album, TBH. Also, she became the first openly genderfluid person to get a Top 10 with Malibu. What a legend.

**Hogwartsreject1912**: DAMN MILEY! Back at it again with all them 10s!

**jamesfog**: Truly an icon of our generation

Thanks for all your efforts! This was a brutal but great rate.

ncd46: Y'all screwed over Hilary (mainly), Replay, Miranda, and Rumors.

I also dislike Party in the USA but there's a long reason why that I don't feel like going into

Hogwartsreject1912: K I have to ask what do you mean by controversy and miss songgeniality?
[/r/popheads/comments/6uxhty/rate_reveal_disneynickelodeon_day_4_everything_is/dm21ajj/]

=====

deleted: controversy is the standard deviation. miss songeniality was what the users voted as the most robbed song of the rate.

Hogwartsreject1912: Wait we could've voted for most robbed???

Can I retroactively vote for He Said She Said? Or are there rules about like a minimum position or amount of days it took to get kicked out?

ImADudeDuh: /u/skiddos I just want to say thanks for hosting this rate. You clearly put a lot of time and effort into this and it really made this rate probably my favorite popheads rate ever! You did a great job! 👍

But seriously, yikes at most of these results

deleted: I'd like to give a sincere "thank you" to all 79 users who participated in the rate as well as the users who showed up for the reveal. This community never fails to make me smile. This rate was something I had been waiting so long to do, and despite the rate being 75 songs long, I wanted to put as much effort into this rate reveal as I could. My objective as is for all rates was to introduce people to music they wouldn't have checked out otherwise, perhaps from these artists because they have the Disney/Nickelodeon label attached to them. Most of these artists are releasing new music soon, so keep an eye out for them! In fact, Bridgit Mendler is releasing a new single titled "Diving" and Sofia Carson is releasing a new single titled "Ins and Outs" - both (allegedly) coming this Friday!

A reminder of this month's rates:

/u/gannade - [Kelly Clarkson - *Breakaway* vs Avril Lavigne - *Let Go* vs P!nk - *I'm Not Dead*](https://redd.it/6r1xin)

/u/letsallpoo - [Taylor Swift - *Red* vs Carly Rae Jepsen - *Kiss* vs Ariana Grande - *My Everything*](https://redd.it/6r1xag)

and the Fantasy Eurovision redux hosted by /u/Kaphox and /u/berober04 .

i love you all!!! ❤️ ❤️

Nerdy_boy_chris: Give it to Problem. But give Love Me Harder and One Last Time your 10s!

=====

InfernalSolstice: One Last Time is an underdog 11 contender for me, and Love Me Harder is probably getting a 9

Although may I add that a song on My Everything is also a 0 contender
