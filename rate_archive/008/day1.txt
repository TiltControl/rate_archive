I think most people expected a Views song would be dead last for this rate, but the real question was which one it would be. This slow, plodding R&B track ended up getting the shitty honor, and while “Redemption” didn’t stack up a lot of really low scores very few people were excited about it. 

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** sums up a lot of the responses with the simple “So fucking boring”.

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** goes into further detail, saying “Least favorite song off Views. The chorus sometimes comes into my head, but this song is so mellow I sometimes forgo Nyquil when I buy groceries because this song guarantees sleep”. 

***eklxtreme*** adds “Very downtempo, but the boring kind”, which goes along pretty well with ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***, who simply says “Okay this song is really boring”. I agree, Doc.

To get away from comments about how boring the song is, how about some comments about the length? ***dirdbub*** noticed this, commenting “5:33 is way too long for a song like this. Mmmmaybe it just shouldn’t have existed?” You wouldn’t be alone in thinking that, tbh. 

***Therokinrolla*** drops in some sarcasm on their critique with “You know what this album needed? An incredibly long super slow burning track with the bpm of a clam.” 

***awesometuck1559*** has my favorite comment for this song with “I used to wonder if Drake memes were an over exaggeration until I heard the line ‘This year for Christmas I just want apologies’.” Dammit, Drake.

Believe it or not, though, some people had nice things to say about this track! ***TheAllRightGatsby*** gives it a glowing review, saying “The lyrics are some real heartfelt moving shit; the great production and hook are just icing on the cake.” 

***MrSwearword*** has some nice words for the producers but not Drake: “Flowing beat that should have gone to someone else.” 

***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** is ambivalent: “Just another average song, nothing I’d listen to more than once, although it’s not that bad.”

This song jumped around in the bottom half throughout December, but a few late low scores put it down to #59. 

Future’s guest appearance divided users, with ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** being high one of those high on it: “I see this song getting criminally underrated by /r/popheads. Love Future’s verse.” No kidding. 

***estreindre*** thinks the opposite, saying “Holy shit Future’s verse is so bad”. ***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** agrees: “I don’t like Future, so that already ruined the song for me.” 

***TheAllRightGatsby*** roasts a little: “This song has no redeeming qualities really. Why is Future autotuned in the wrong key for the song???” 

***camerinian*** goes in even further, commenting “It was while listening to Future’s absolute trash verse that it suddenly clicked why so many people hated this album so much. Repetitive nonsense that sounds fine in the moment but after extended thought reveals itself to be a non-descript mess.” Holy shit.

**AND NOW ALL THE COMMENTS THAT MENTIONED DESIIGNER OR MADE JOKES ABOUT THE TITLE “GRAMMYS”:**

“This beat is fire. ~~Desiigner~~ Future makes this song a bop, tbh.” - ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***

“Should’ve gotten Desiigner to feature instead” - ***TwentyOneParrots***

“I always forget how similar Future and Desiigner sound. Almost thought I was listening to Panda for a quick second.” - ***raicicle***

“Macklemore deserves his Grammys, you don’t.” - ***MrSwearword*** (This comment hurts to read)

“This song should be a reason why Drake should get NO GRAMMYS” - ***enecks***

[ZZzzzz](https://m.popkey.co/1d1e6e/O975l.gif?c=popkey-web&p=popkey&i=drake-music&l=direct&f=.gif). This song isn't that bad, but it would be one of the first songs I put on a falling asleep playlist. But it's not too bad for driving at night, I guess? Also, it may or may not be about Nicki, and she is [single](https://twitter.com/NICKIMINAJ/status/817011839401922566) now so 👀.

***bluehxrizon*** shares my sentiment: "this song was so boring but it felt like a lullaby so i liked it". 

***Reifiui*** agrees: "Fire & DezzzZZZZZZ".

A few people noted the sample of Brandy's "I Dedicate", including ***JunkyGS*** ("carried by the sample tbh"), ***raicicle*** ("The Brandy sample is great on this. Basically old-school 90s R&B throughout."), and ***TheAllRightGatsby*** ("The Brandy sample is fire; I could take or leave the song though."). If there's one thing Drake knows, it's 90s R&B.

However, this is largely the most praise that people could find for "Fire & Desire". ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** isn't impressed even with the title: "boring as fuck, literally named after the most common, cliché rhyme in music", and ***ExtraEater*** keeps with the title dragging, saying "stop trying to imitate Robert Frost you're not a poet Drake". 

***Therokinrolla*** tries to find something to compliment: "What’s interesting about this song? Err, well, uh, the name rhymes?"

In more positive comments, there isn't much, but ***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** does have sort of nice words, commenting "Slow, but not bad." 

***eklxtreme*** is similarly ambivalent: "I like the Drakey emotional vibes, but it doesn’t offer much else".

**GETTING TO THE POINT AWARD:**

***dirdbub*** - what the fuck is this shit

We can all blame Tidal for this one. Due to the streaming politics that [Kanye warned us about](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/759437257099010048?lang=en), the superior single version of "Pop Style" featuring Kanye and Jay Z was replaced by this one. In case you were wondering if anyone else thinks this way...

**ALL THE COMMENTS THAT MENTION THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF POP STYLE**

> ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** - "Kanye version was better"

> ***ThatParanoidPenguin*** - "God, dropping Jay and Kanye off of this song was the single saddest music related thing that happened in 2016 and David Bowie and Leonard Cohen fucking died. Why, Drake, why? Kanye delivered some amazingly funny lines and Drake's new verse pales in comparison. Smh."

> ***JunkyGS*** - "I want Kanye…"

> ***VodkaInsipido*** - "I’m still mad Ye isn’t here."

> ***raicicle*** - "when will ur faves give Jay Z one line"

> ***awesometuck1559*** - "Holy shit does this suffer without the features"

> ***camerinian*** - "The “Chaining Tatum” line fucking cracks me up ok, definitely prefer the Throne version tho"

> ***eklxtreme*** - "love the instrumental but the bars are very corny and Drake should’ve kept Kanye cus that means less corny bars"

> ***TwentyOneParrots*** - "This song is so much better with Kanye and Jay on it"

---

...Yeah. Getting into some non Throne-related reactions to the song, ***enecks*** brings in with an interesting comparison: "why the fuck is your beat video game creepypasta music"

***Reifiui*** drags it: "If how much this song bores me (outside of the horrrible stupid lines) was converted into mass it would be a fucking black hole"

However, some people like ***YankeeHankyPanky*** could find things to appreciate: "The entire strength of this song is the amazing beat."

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** also enjoyed it, commenting "It seems like not a lot of people like this song. I thought this song is good. It's fire and the lyrics are at least tolerable compared to the earlier songs on the album." Definitely a minority opinion.

Yep, another Drake song. One of the more forgettable tracks on *Views*, this bleh piece of R&B brings in a random posthumous verse from late legend Pimp C and vocals from the INCREDIBLY UNDERRATED [dvsn](https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/sept.-5th/id1091615564).

A lot of the commenters actually did find bright spots to the song, but few were related to Drake.

***raicicle*** directs praise: "It’s mostly dvsn that rocks this." and ***eklxtreme*** is in agreement: "I like the pimp C sample, dvsn really outshines Drake and brings up the song, 'that pussy knows me way better than I know myself', 'season pass', these bars are so corny"

***estreindre*** also praises dvsn: "haaate the first half, but i actually really, really like dvsn's part of the song."

Pimp C got some nice comments as well, including ***YankeeHankyPanky***: "Pimp C brings the heat from the grave" and ***ThatParanoidPenguin*** loves both features: "Underrated? Underrated. Pimp C does his thing in spades, and dvsn delivers the best outro on the album (listen to his fucking album goddamn). Drake is on his most charismatic and varied here, and it shows. Song should be a boring mid-album slump, but instead, it's one of the standouts. Beat is a little boring outside of the bass, but it's fine." LISTEN TO SEPT 5TH.

***TheAllRightGatsby*** sums up many of the reactions, with "Production is great, features were great, Drake was the weak point on this track by far." ***Therokinrolla*** providing the best drag: "Its funny bc I lost all my faith during this track". Drake's impact.

I promise, there's non-Drake songs eventually. Come on guys, this isn't that bad!!! The beat's good!! I know like 60% of the bars are corny but... nevermind.

***letsallpoo*** was not impressed: "Does NOT provide what it says on the tin."

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** has similar thoughts: "I almost want to give this song a 0 because of its misleading title. At least the beat is fire but the lyrics, dear lord." ***enecks*** follows the trend, saying "Calling a song this basic Hype is just begging to be roasted".

Many comments expressed boredom at the song, like ***Therokinrolla*** ("I don’t dislike it but I don’t care to listen to it again".), ***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** ("This is a pretty boring sounding song."), and put the most simply, ***estreindre*** ("EHHHHHHH.")

Others, however, could find a little joy in "Hype."

***awesometuck1559*** enjoyed the song except for one bit: "I’m good with this, too. Pretty good track. Getting sick of these goddamn outros, tho." Isn't everyone?

***eklxtreme*** also gives decent praise by Drake rate standards: "decent bars and good flow, all around pretty solid."

***YankeeHankyPanky*** gives the most positive review: "Straight bars, and maybe the hardest Drake goes on this whole album."

***MrSwearword***, however, brings up some old history: "'Don’t you see Riri right next to me?' Not anymore". [At least he's moved on](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IK6-i-Fdor8).

I'm kinda running out of new things to say about Drake songs, tbh. Let's just go to the comments.

***enecks*** calls the track "F I L L E R". Pretty simple way of summing up most of the comments I got for these low ranking *Views* songs.

"9" actually picked up a few more positive comments then the previous songs. Noted *Views* apologist ***Awhile2*** praised the track: "the synths on this are so nice and the atmosphere is just so cold. The outro is one of my favorite moments in music this year".

***TheAllRightGatsby*** is on board: "I actually really like this, mostly cuz of that sample in the hook which is really cool." Again, Drake's samples get more praise then Drake himself.

***YankeeHankyPanky*** had one of the best for this song, commenting "Drake reps Toronto, but does it in a way that makes you certain he was crying when he wrote it." Ouch.

***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** has only two words: "It’s okay."

---

**AND NOW, ALL THE COMMENTS THAT REFERENCED THE TITLE OR THE LYRIC "TURN THE 6 UPSIDE DOWN IT'S A 9 NOW":**

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** - "so, so bad just because of the 'turn the 6 upside down' line"

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** - "9 does not get a 9. Beat is fairly standard but it's a pretty memorable one, off the album at least. The 6/9 thing going on is pretty awesome tbh, and when Drake switches up his flow (keychain go jing-a-ling!), it brings this song up, because it's moments like this that make each of these songs on Views a little better for me than for others. Outro is fire though."

***ExtraEater*** - "title is clearly vote manipulation"

***Reifiui*** - "Nine upside down it's a six now"

***TwentyOneParrots*** - "Definitely not a 9"

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** - "'turn the 9 upside down thats a 6 now'. FTFY Drake. Seriously though, how a song with a fire beat ended up having really shitty lyrics? Like oh my god"

Drake really can't catch a break. While I don't think anyone didn't see a 1989 in his future, it's still a little sad for me to watch these songs go so quick. It would be sadder if a lot of them weren't [boring as hell](http://esq.h-cdn.co/assets/16/17/1461939425-drake-pop-style.gif).

Since this song divided alot of the commenters, let's start with some good ones. ***nskn13*** even says: "This album would be so much better if it started about here."

***awesometuck1559*** found something he was looking for: "Where the fuck has this Drake been? more of him, please, less of the long-ass outros."

***DOCTORWHOWHENHOWWHY*** HAS HIGH PRAISE: "FINALLY AN INTERESTING SONG. AND IT'S FUCKING FIRE, LYRICALLY AND MUSICALLY WISE."

***TheAllRightGatsby***'s comment didn't show a clear strong reaction: "Ehhh it's solid but I'm not listening to this again." Neither did that of ***Therokinrolla***: "Another average track next please".

***enecks***, meanwhile, is far from impressed: "Drake bragging is inherently shit."

***JunkyGS*** in particular really didn't like the song: "Pretty sure this song was ruled as unusual / cruel punishment by the Supreme Court… or was that water boarding? O well both achieve the same result." I wouldn't go that far...

***estreindre*** just wants it to be over: "OH MY GOD HOW MUCH LONGER DOES THIS ALBUM GO ON FOR"

Yes, people other than Drake exist in this rate! After eight straight Drizzy songs to start out day one, Kanye loses his first. A minimalist, almost unfinished track, this one was probably destined for a low spot and a high controversy score.

Before the reviews, ***ExtraEater*** has a request: "can you keep track of how many people gave this a four thnx" (6)

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** is a big fan of the song: "Honestly legendary. Me and my friend who went to MSG fucking started cracking up so hard when this was played. He said, and I quote "it's amazing how truly confident he is! He's really wondering if everybody would start fucking!". Desiigner kills the outro, it's lit."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** goes into some analysis: "This is a risk that really pays off. For people who criticize this album's lyrics, this song shows that Kanye's playing an unreliable and at times unhinged narrator, and you shouldn't take his words at face value."

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** has a similar look on the song, commenting "If what Genius tells me about this song is right, this song is about Kanye's thoughts when he is not sober. I feel like the disorted production blends well with Kanye's not-so-sober vocals and they fit the theme of this song very well." G E N I U S

However, ***eklxtreme*** loves the song but is unfulfilled: "dope Yeezus vibes, this goes so fucking hard but it's way too short". Not surprising from the sub's most prominent Desiigner stan.

***Therokinrolla*** is ambivalent to the song: "WHAT IF WE FUCKED RIGHT NOW. Like right now. Jesus Christ he’s tryna initiate a damn orgy calm tfdown. An uneventful track otherwise." Agreeing is ***awesometuck1559***: "Although it has some iconic lines, this whole thing is just kinda eh. Not a very strong effort from Ye."

***TwentyOneParrots*** has some relatable opinions: "I like it but it's hard to listen to sometimes." Definitely fits *The Life of Pablo*.

...And back to the Drake songs. This song actually did pick up five 10s, but it couldn't keep it out of the bottom 10.

The track did impress ***bluehxrizon***, who said "the vocal melody in the bridge is pretty nice and I don’t usually like drake’s vocals".

***nskn13*** on the other hand, isn't: "I'm so bored already". Neither is ***estreindre***: "Ehhhh." A lot of songs on this album have at least one "Eh" comment.

***Therokinrolla*** had their expectations, defied however: "As much as I HATE the way he says it, “Is you with me?” kinda sounds so pleading and upsetting that its appealingly sad. One of the better songs on this album".

On that side is ***TheAllRightGatsby***: "WTF... am I a Drake fan? It seemed impossible but this is actually dope". Drake is slaying expectations!!! He doesn't deserve this 1989ing!!!

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** is more mixed: "I like the beat. I am just very mixed on the lyrics used here. One verse I would say 'I fuck with this', the next verse I would be like 'What the fuck Drake?'".

***skiddos*** throws some real shade: "LOLOL he needs to hire a new ghostwriter" Pick up the phone, [Quentin Miller](http://jusebeats.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/quentin-miller-know-yourself-dra.jpg).

Story time. Back in December 2015, Kanye hadn't released a new song in nine months and had just said he was finishing an album. On New Year's Eve 2015, Kim tweeted [this](https://twitter.com/kimkardashian/status/682712435409563648?lang=en), hinting at a new Kanye single that day. Then came "Facts", which was so 'meh' that Big Quint [shut it off](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlA-pLH3Ioc). Oof. This updated version produced by Charlie Heat gave the song some new life.

***VodkaInsipido*** doesn't really agree with that: "I still dislike it."

***estreindre*** isn't a fan of the lyrics: "do i even have to say what lyric brings this song down so much for me?"

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** is just confused: "I like Kanye's flow here but I feel like Kanye is just rapping random topics about his life in this song. I guess it fits the title of the song?" Yep.

***ExtraEater*** just needs wants to know something about Charlie Heat: "Who"

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** goes into depth on the song, commenting "Charlie Heat singlehandedly saves the worst Kanye song of the last two years. His production work thus far is astounding, and it's crazy he brings up this steaming 4/5 to a 7, because it's such an improvement. The verses aren't that bad, but they're not that good either. There's a lot of quotables, and honestly I'm still concerned about whether or not I like COUCHES COUCHES COUCHES or not but that's another story."

***Reifiui*** follows up on that: "King of shoes and couches"

However, ***eklxtreme*** enjoyed it: "the instrumental blew up my speakers and set off the fire alarm in my dorm, the lyrics are corny though". ***dirdbub*** says "YEEZY YEEZY YEEZY THIS FREESTYLE BANGS" and ***YankeeHankyPanky*** has something I think we can all agree on: "I hope Yeezy Yeezy jumps over Trumpman soon, forget Jumpman".

I won't lie and say I wasn't rooting for this to be out earlier. I've never really been quiet about my dislike of Lil Yachty and he kills the song for me. But that's just my opinion!

***awesometuck1559*** agrees with me: "Least favorite track on the album. Weak bars from Chance, don’t enjoy the artificial voice, and Lil Yachty. Eugh. Decent hook, though." I will admit that it's annoyingly catchy.

***estreindre*** isn't a fan of either feature: "BOY young thug sucks (and lil yachty is... so mediocre)." C'mon, I know *Jeffery* wasn't good but 👀

***TheAllRightGatsby*** ("This is an all right song, but I wish it weren't on here cuz it feels so out of place with every other song on this album. It's like this album's Facts. But the beat is pretty cool.") and ***dirdbub*** ("dillema: I don’t like this kind of bro-rap style kinda deal but this goes fucking off. what do" are conflicted.

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** wanted more: "I feel like this song could have done better given the theme of the song but otherwise this is a bop with banging production."

In more positive comments, we have my rival in Yachty opinions ***eklxtreme***: "everyone's flow is good, I expected more from thugger but I'm impressed with yachty, banger". ***Awhile2*** agrees: "One of Yachty’s best verses ever and i love when Chance does his lazy flow".

ExtraEater: **Great Crayon Journey Around New York - Part 6: Mixtape Mobs**

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's my comment for this song:

> 6\. Mixtape - **9** - as soon as i heard the sick beat come on in mixtape, i had to go to the park and dance. but somehow i started a flash mob of dancing to mixtape by chance the rapper! it was so exciting! i converted a bunch of white people into chance in the process. i mean they thought it was the same guy who made cupid shuffle but it still counts right? anyway my crayons were safe god bless. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

To clarify, this is the title track on this album, the whole thing isn't out yet. But it might as well be. Truth be told it takes me a second to even remember what this song sounds like, so I don't know if I can really say it deserves better.

***Mudkip1*** isn't impressed: "Such a mediocre song for a title track. Drake should've cut this from the album".

***enecks***, however, thinks the opposite: "Hey this actually has energy and passion".

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** goes into some analysis but enjoyed the song: "Great outro. A little static, but there's a lot of good stuff here. Beat is fire, and verses are some of the best on the album. My personal favorite part of the song is how it goes " Question is, will I ever leave you? The answer is no, no, no..." in the intro and when Drake comes in, he just says "Yeah"." I'll have to take your word for it, tbh.

***estreindre*** is just happy it's over: "FINALLY THIS ALBUM IS ALMOST OVER OH MY GOD. views (song) is mediocre but i will say that at least the song has some ENERGY on it, which is more than i can say than half of this album, so i'm raising it a bit." ***camerinian***, on the other hand, just wants the song to be over: "Yeah ok views of the city whatever who cares get to Hotline Bling already." Well, it'll be around soon enough (or will it).

DAMN YOU PEOPLE, THIS DESERVED BETTER. I know *Views* is boring but at least it opened good! [Come on...](https://media.giphy.com/media/13W5D2gxaOTWfe/giphy.gif)

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** knows what I'm thinking: "Excellent intro, sets the mood for the album perfectly."

***Awhile2*** also loves it: " The instrumentation on this song is beautiful". I guess it's just a mod thing.

This comment by ***ExtraEater*** very accurately describes the song: " In which Drake states that he loves his family in a very direct fashion." :0

***Reifiui***, however, thinks Drake is biting a little: "The instrumentation already sounds like a Lana Del Rey song (WHAT A G O O D S I G N) but with life, why are people copying Lana always doing it better?" [I like this comment](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/be/68/07/be68071d69fa8477cda25f43e5a546aa.gif).

Several comments, summed up here by ***raicicle***, mentioned the song's length: "The noir feel is rather sweet, with the horns and guitars. That said, it goes on for absolutely ages. Like, seriously, it’s just so long." I lowkey agree even if it doesn't matter. Plus you get patois!

Coincidentally, ***TwentyOneParrots*** and ***eklxtreme*** both made the same connection:

>"This sounds like a James Bond song with the strings and the loud horns" - ***TwentyOneParrots***

>"Digging the bond-like instrumentation, decent lyrics" - ***eklxtreme***

This is obviously a sign that Drake should be the next [Bond](https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/s--kKd-Hxex--/t_full/f_auto,fl_lossy,q_75/v1364527803/drake-at-the-grammys.jpg). Make it happen.

Another one bites the dust. The lower controversy score and lack of either a 1 or a 10 shows just how little the sub really cared either.

Most positive (and even a few mixed/negative) comments praised the beat (produced by Murda Beatz):

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** - "Beat is fun, but a bit too boring for how much is going on. The chorus is eh. But, it's catchy for some reason, and I do like me some PND."

***bluehxrizon*** - "kind of boring but the beat is nice"

***Therokinrolla*** - "The first track on the album with a distinguishable beat, that’s nice. It was also refreshing to hear a voice that wasn’t Drake’s so that’s nice."

***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** - "Catchy beat, PND has a pretty nice appearance."

***eklxtreme*** - "I like the subtle dance hall production, PND outshines Drake"

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** - "Shame this song has a great beat but that's basically it. It's so boring."

In non-beat related comments, ***VodkaInsipido*** was turned on to a new artist: "who is this partynextdoor guy and why do i love him so much now? why isn’t this in all the charts? why does partynextdoor sound like a porn name? So many questions, so few answers." [He did get to make out with Kylie Jenner for a video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ockhq8E2FrA).

***JunkyGS*** has some more positive thoughts: "Love the PND feature! I remember this being one of my favorite but I like it even more now, maybe because it is such a relief from the rest of the album. Fresh production".

***dirdbub*** again sums up a lot of *Views* comments, saying "I’m completely indifferent about this song. honestly feels like a song that you can play in the background and it’ll be fine". RIP.

WHY YOU ALWAYS GOTTA FIGHT WITH ME AT CHEESECAKE? One of the more quotable/cheesy songs on the album, I honestly expected it to go higher. But hey, it is a Drake song.

***-dolantello-*** sums it up well: "The lyrics are trash but the beat is so good". So does ***bluehxrizon***: "lmao this song is hilarious"

***camerinian*** brings some shade: "Ironically this sort of song is pretty fucking childish".

***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** goes into some detail on his comment: "This song is so catchy, even better than the mega hits Hotline Bling and One Dance. Insanely catchy production and some of the most enjoyable Drake verses I’ve heard. The themes are still very Drake, but I would personally say is above average if not good."

***eklxtreme*** is meh: "annoying chorus, the storytelling here is works well and the production is pretty decent"

And then there's ***TheAllRightGatsby*** with the perfect description of most people's reactions to the *Views* era: "I thought this was gonna be better than it was."

I'm not sure what ***Therokinrolla*** is getting at with "Drake invented music-induced comas" but I agree I guess.

**AWARD FOR PERFECTLY SUMMING UP THE SONG**:

"Cheesecake" - ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***

One of the longer existing songs from *The Life of Pablo* (snippets were circling in early 2015), this minimalist track didn't rack up very strong reactions, with 15 people giving it an 8.

Thankfully I have ***TheAllRightGatsby*** to perfectly describe this: "A fun song with great production and Kanye bringin it in the flow department, but not an album highlight." Pretty much what everyone thought.

***enecks*** was a little more negative about it, but had a similar end point: "This beat is a bit of a stretch at the start, and it only gets worse. It’s not a bad song, but feels like it should’ve been rejected."

However, ***Therokinrolla*** is on board with it: "I swear the production on this album is perfect. It sounds so purposefully distorted that tbh represents Kanye’s view on life now that he’s famous"

***YankeeHankyPanky***, again, sums up the replies: "Good but forgettable"

I'm not kidding, a majority of the replies, even positive ones, didn't consider it too much of a standout. This includes ***dirdbub***, who said "I’m not especially interested in this song, other than the sample that runs the flow. it’s so good - Kanye’s production is always on point". The production did get some very positive reaction by most.

***JunkyGS*** has clearly never been to popheads: "NAME ONE GENIUS THAT AINT CRAZY? BIG BOOTY BITCHES FOR ALL OF POPHEADS!" [The only ending to that](https://www.dicasocial.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/smithers.gif).

WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE

ESPECIALLY YOU MUD

The reactions to this one were pretty wild and varied. Let's get into it.

I'm on board with ***VodkaInsipido***: "Best dancehall song of the year, hands down."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** likes the song, but begins a trend of comments that mention the patois: "Drake using patois is sketch, but I like that he put a real dancehall artist on here to pay homage, and this song is pretty great overall."

Continuing that is ***booooam***: "Nice track, stop it with the patois tho" and ***JoeThaMo*** doesn't line up with the rest of the sub (except me): "I've always liked this one more than One Dance to be honest, even before it suffered from overexposure". 🙌

***eklxtreme*** also enjoyed it except the patois: "great summer vibes, hiphop/dancehall production on point, I think i like this because Drake does more singing than patois, wya Popcaan". [Popcaan rn](https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-NAuiHYtjo68/Vw1fz9b3JVI/AAAAAAAABS0/RckNwvkaoI4KsZj2ESleXSiYRkvYTXqOQCLcB/s640/tumblr_m9ecp0ltiJ1rpo4fpo1_500.gif)

On the other hand, we have ***dirdbub***: "can this song become a person so I can choke it for being so fucking bad?" Jeez.

***enecks*** doesn't have a strong opinion: "Hey it’s just mediocre". Kinda standard for *Views* but THIS SONG IS GREAT DAMMIT

I don't like you anymore, ***Mudkip1***: "this song is a fucking flop <3"

I'm honestly surprised this one almost made it to day 2. A song that jumped [in](http://2ykov18qyj81ii56523ib0ue.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/ye-swish-tracklist.jpg) and [out](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=321x10000:format=jpg/path/s6a8573ef9d7ebf5d/image/id91c74c36986e6bd/version/1455439923/image.jpg) and [back in](https://image.jimcdn.com/app/cms/image/transf/dimension=321x10000:format=jpg/path/s6a8573ef9d7ebf5d/image/idd285e2054a6e294/version/1455439993/image.jpg) of the album tracklist, the final album version is typically divisive considering the last 3 minutes is a rambling monologue by Kanye with random Andre 3000 mixed in. The song references one of Kanye's early girlfriends, whom he would drive 30 hours from Los Angeles to Chicago in order to see.

***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** gives a glowing review: "Incredible, I love the production on this one. The Victoria’s Secret line isn’t that good, but the rest of the Kanye’s verse is great. Also I found his mumbling really interesting. I think it adds to the song. Holy shit also I just noticed Andre 3000’s voice in the “30 Hours” background part. I always heard the 3 Stacks part thing but never put 2 and 2 together. HOW DID I NEVER NOTICE THIS" I wouldn't be too surprised by anyone who didn't realize that the background voice saying two words is one of the all-time greatest rappers. WYD Kanye??

***awesometuck1559***'s comment also references this: "This is a good track but it loses this many points because WHAT THE FUCK HOW U GONNA GET ANDRE 3000 ON A TRACK JUST TO SAY “30 HOURS” OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHAT IN THE FUCK WAS THAT KANYE."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** praises the beat: "Just close your eyes and listen to this beat. Don't even pretend you don't like it; how can I be mad about this outro when it's over this beat? Also Ye drops some sick punchlines."

***Therokinrolla***, on the other hand, praises the punchlines: "“I guess a blowjobs better than no jobs” and My ex says she gave me the best years of her life I saw a recent picture of her, I guess she was right”” Literally iconic and me irl."

The outro attracted some negativity ***JoeThaMo*** is part of it: "This would have gotten at least an 8 if it wasn't for the last minute or so". ***Reifiui*** is agreeing: "This is good but 2 minutes could have been cut honestly"

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** says insane alot: "Verses are insane. Beat is insane. The decision to make the song 5 minutes with just Andre popping in for an unsatisfying cameo and then "picking up his phone" is insane. The single version that dropped the day after Yeezy Season 3 was a 10."

Meanwhile, ***ExtraEater*** has this: "i always think of this song when i've been sitting down for like 30 hours and then i get up super quickly and suddenly my head is all disoriented and i can see so many fuckin colors its like gettin high on rainbows🌈🌈". I think these might be Halsey lyrics.

Frank almost survived day 1 with all his songs still in, but this song just barely snuck in at #41. Easily the most divisive and experimental moment on *Blonde*, this song toed the line between song and interlude for me, and was only just included.

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** has it down: "Well, this song is uhhhh, something. But I like it." SAME.

***ExtraEater*** has some truth: "This song is basically shoegaze".

I definitely agree with ***TheAllRightGatsby*** too: "The most experimental song on the album, and it totally pays off. It actually has some really gorgeous and sweet melodies for how aggressive and frantic and weird it is. This is basically Frank's "A Day in the Life" moment. AND WHEN THOSE DRUMS COME IN IT GETS ME EVERY TIME." ***dirdbub*** agrees: "damn, that switch-up is absolutely incredible. this song is just awesome". So does ***VodkaInsipido***: "People hate it, I don't. The first half still confuses me, but the second half is like dying and going to heaven." 

***awesometuck1559*** is a little more ambivalent: "This track is beautiful chaos, though it may be too chaotic for its own good sometimes."

Best is ***TwentyOneParrots***, who doesn't even know how to react: "It feels weird to give this a number rating because it's just so weird. I don't feel like that number does it justice tbh".

***bluehxrizon***: "what is even happening at the start of this song" Yep.

**AWARD FOR COMMENT I DON'T UNDERSTAND BUT MADE ME LAUGH SOMEHOW**:

"Kinda like a hot dog I don’t know wtf it is but I need more" - ***Therokinrolla***
