[RATE] The Life of Pablo vs. Views vs. Coloring Book vs. Blonde
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5fuxsj/rate_the_life_of_pablo_vs_views_vs_coloring_book/

**[Welcome to the first December /r/popheads rate thread, everyone!](http://content.asos-media.com/~/media/211114050745en-GB/Images/uk/2014/11/21-friday/OMG/kim-kanye-north-rex.gif?mw=603)**

For this month, I’m going to be running our first **four** album rate, covering some of 2016’s biggest names in hip hop and R&B. The year would have been different if not for these four black artists, all of whom got attention for unique approaches in both rollouts and music. All four albums were released as part of the new trend of exclusitivity in music, with three being released via Apple Music (one with no prior announcement) and one via Tidal.

The albums are:

**Kanye West** - ***The Life of Pablo***

**Drake** - ***Views***

**Chance the Rapper** - ***Coloring Book***

**Frank Ocean** - ***Blonde***

**HOW TO RATE/RULES:**

1. Fairly listen to and rate each song listed on a scale of 10 to 1, 10 being perfect and 1 terrible. You can give ONE song **(for the whole rate, not per album)** a 11, and ONE song a 0 for your fave/least fave. Decimals are allowed, but you cannot give songs higher then 10 or lower then 1 besides your 11/0. No 10.X or 0.X scores are allowed, and if I get them I’ll change them. Also know that your scores aren’t confidential and the high/low ones will be shown with the results.
2. If you want, write comments with your thoughts. This is encouraged since it makes the reveals more fun, but not required.
3. PM your scores & comments to me (/u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus) by December 31st. Once it hits 2017, I won’t be accepting any scores.
4. Sometime in early January I’ll be revealing the results, going from the bottom (aka the Drake zone) to the top.
5. **Overly negative scores and sabotage towards only one album will be discounted. If your average score is less then a 2.5-3, I will not count your scores. Overly negative scores (i.e. giving more then half of the songs 1s) can also be discounted.**

**SPECIAL NOTES FOR THIS RATE:**

1. Since this rate includes albums with interludes, I’ve decided to make the interludes seperate from the regular rate. If you want (it’s not required) rate the interludes as well and send me any scores/comments with the rest. Since this is seperate, you can give one interlude a 11 (Yeezy yeezy) and one a 0. If I have enough scores, I’ll do a special reveal before the first day of results.
2. Some of the songs we’re rating have different versions. For The Life of Pablo, rate the final version that’s on streaming. If you have a version without Saint Pablo, it’s not the final version. Also make sure to rate the Charlie Heat version of Facts, the Drake-only version of Pop Style, etc. Both versions of Blessings are on the album tho so rate them both.

Now let’s get started by meeting the artists:

**[KANYE WEST](http://static.vibe.com/files/2015/03/Kanye-West-All-Day-Video.jpg) - [THE LIFE OF PABLO](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/4d/The_life_of_pablo_alternate.jpg)**

Does Kanye need an introduction? A highly publicized but divisive figure, he attracts strong reactions from basically everyone. A producer who got a big break through Jay Z, Kanye moved into rapping and put out three successful education themed albums: 2004’s [The College Dropout](http://images.genius.com/0bffd93463afe53e7f651f72bedfc78b.1000x1000x1.jpg), 2005’s [Late Registration](https://images.genius.com/2eb75c8a4d53e8782d8e37681871a9bf.1000x1000x1.jpg), and 2007’s [Graduation](https://images.genius.com/336af3b66a79eb083a8469fa6f5c84c5.1000x1000x1.jpg). After a breakup with his fiance and the death of his [mother](http://missdimplez.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/donda-west-and-kanye-west.jpg), Kanye moved into electropop for 2008’s divisive [808s & Heartbreak](https://images.genius.com/f69387025c516715db7b5d56037ee76a.1000x997x1.jpg), and following a period of heavy scrutiny from his [interruption](http://nahright.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/07/kanye-taylorswift-2009vmas.jpg) of [Taylor Swift](http://dlisted.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/taylorswiftsnakeemoji2016.jpg) at the 2009 VMAs, Kanye went into exile and came back out with his most acclaimed album yet, [My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy](http://az616578.vo.msecnd.net/files/2016/11/04/636138775479425325-534255226_kanye-my-beautiful-dark-twisted-fantasy-itunes-cover.jpg). He collabed with Jay Z and his label GOOD Music on full-length albums, then returned with the minimalist [Yeezus](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/0/03/Yeezus_album_cover.png) in 2013. Kanye has seen much acclaim for his music despite his love or hate personality, winning [21 Grammy Awards](http://media.vogue.com/r/h_480,w_480/2015/02/06/biggest-hauls-in-grammy-history-kanye-west.jpg) and influencing artists from Kendrick Lamar to Chance the Rapper to Drake to Kid Cudi to Frank Ocean. He has been [married](http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2014426/rs_1024x759-140526212702-1024-3kim-kardashian-kanye-west-wedding.ls.52614_copy.jpg) to reality star Kim Kardashian since 2014 and they have two kids together.

Kanye began working on a followup to Yeezus in 2014. He released two singles, “Only One” and “All Day”, in early 2015, but news on the album, named [So Help Me God](http://cdn1-www.craveonline.com/assets/uploads/2015/03/Screen-Shot-2015-03-01-at-12.59.45-PM.png) and then SWISH, slowed as the year moved on. Kanye resumed work on the project late in 2015, releasing “Real Friends” and “No More Parties in LA” through Soundcloud in January and renaming the album twice more to Waves and then finally to The Life of Pablo. Two days after premiering the album at a [huge listening party](https://cdn.theatlantic.com/assets/media/img/mt/2016/02/IMG_5177/lead_960.jpg?1455287949) in Madison Square Garden, Kanye released the album to Tidal on February 14th, 2016. However, he would continue to change the album after its release, even adding a new song in June, over 4 months after it came out. Kanye supported the album with the [Saint Pablo Tour](http://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_limit,w_680/f_auto,fl_lossy,pg_1,q_auto/kanye-west-saint-pablo-tour_wfpwx2/kanye-west-saint-pablo-tour), which was cancelled in November when he was hospitalized over increased stress and dehydration.

Another artist who needs little introduction, Drake has become one of the biggest names of the 2010s. Getting his start as an actor on the Canadian show [Degrassi](http://i2.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/000/275/484/a99.jpg), Drake moved into music, and after leaving the show he broke through in 2009 with his mixtape [So Far Gone](http://bigghostlimited.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/So-Far-Gone-Full.jpg), signing to his [mentor Lil Wayne’s](http://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2016829/rs_1024x759-160929161936-1024-drake-lil-wayne-092916.jpg) Young Money label. He released his debut album in 2010, and the acclaimed follow-up [Take Care](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91gMAln-dPL._SY355_.jpg) a year after. 2013’s [Nothing Was the Same](http://hiphop-n-more.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/08/NWTS-Standard.jpg) was another smash, and spawned the hits “Started from the Bottom” and “Hold On, We’re Going Home”. Drake said his next album would be inspired by his hometown of Toronto and called Views from the 6 in 2014, but in the meantime he released the hugely successful mixtapes [If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late](http://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/pulse_embed_breakpoints_theme_lt_desktop_1x/public/2015/02/16/drake-if-youre-reading-its-too-late-memes_0.jpg) and What a Time to Be Alive (a collaboration with Future). After years of buildup, Drake finally released Views on April 29th, 2016. The album was a huge success, spending 13 nonconsecutive weeks at the top of the Billboard 200 and giving Drake his first solo #1 single, “One Dance”. Drake has made a name for himself through his career with his mix of R&B and hip hop, which he described himself as “Drake featuring Drake”. In 2011, he cosigned and helped the career of another rising star out of Toronto, [The Weeknd](http://imf.ulximg.com/image/724x483/gallery/1396712069_d847fd8990ba874120f8043f0118d585.jpg/c100786c4cdd2ea866fa538cf5c0e297/1396712069_drake_the_weeknd_92.jpg).

**[CHANCE THE RAPPER](http://groovevolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/skrillex-chance-rapper-hundred-waters-remix-sumney-rhye.png) - [COLORING BOOK](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/CiTlBqgUkAAgKUb.jpg)**

The youngest artist in this rate by five years, Chance the Rapper is one of the brightest young stars in hip hop right now. Growing up on the south side of Chicago, Chance wrote his first mixtape [10 Day](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/1/11/Chance10Day.jpeg) while suspended from school for smoking. The next year, he blew up off of his breakthrough mixtape [Acid Rap](https://i1.sndcdn.com/artworks-000046904102-0iwr24-t500x500.jpg), which was named one of the best projects of 2013 by many publications. Chance laid low from new solo music the next few years, but he and his fellow members of the band [The Social Experiment](http://itsalwaysnew.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/watch-chance-the-rappers-short-film-sox-day-0.jpeg) released their debut album [Surf](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/d/d3/Surf_\(Donnie_Trumpet_cover\).png) in 2015 to positive reactions. In late 2015, Chance released the new singles “Angels” and “Somewhere in Paradise”, leading up to the release of Coloring Book (previously known as Chance 3) on May 12th, 2016. So far in 2016, Chance has collaborated with [Kanye West](https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/screen-shot-2016-01-25-at-5-53-07-pm.png?w=807), debuted his Chicago-based music festival [Magnificent Coloring Day](http://res.cloudinary.com/thefader/image/upload/Screen_Shot_2016-09-25_at_4.56.34_PM_uffdoh.png) (which featured appearances from Lil Wayne, Kanye, John Legend, and others), and been invited to the [White House](http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bb2534f6b68e93db27fffa18b1febb3839148105/c=0-214-4200-2587&r=x329&c=580x326/local/-/media/2016/10/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636124278889214577-AFP-AFP-HA00A.jpg) by President Obama.

One of the most celebrated but also cryptic acts of the decade, Frank Ocean has become one of the biggest names in modern R&B. Growing up in New Orleans, Frank moved to Los Angeles after his equipment was lost to Hurricane Katrina, joining the hip hop collective [Odd Future](https://s3.amazonaws.com/rapgenius/1372707391_odd-future_052813.jpg) in 2009. Frank got attention from his mixtape [Nostalgia Ultra](http://www.themixtapelab.com/wp-content/uploads/mixtapes/2015/01/frank-ocean-nostalgia-ultra.png) in 2011, and got the chance to work with Jay Z and [Kanye West](http://thesource.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/frank-ocean-yeezy.jpg) on their collab album Watch the Throne. Frank’s 2012 debut album [Channel Orange](http://images.genius.com/bddd20902232f3ff0f1d691d90affcc9.1000x1000x1.jpg) was met with acclaim from critics, six Grammy nominations, and that year, he also made headlines by coming out as bisexual through an [open letter](http://www.mnhuntingcalendar.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/frank-ocean-open-letter-frankocean-letter.jpg), gaining positive response from the industry. In 2013, he said he was working on a followup, but years would go by with little news about the album. In April 2015, he posted a [picture](http://music.mxdwn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/frank-ocean-new-album-2015.jpg) announcing an album, apparently titled Boys Don’t Cry, would be released in July, along with a magazine. However, nothing came out and July passed. A year later in July 2016, Frank once again hinted that the album was coming [that month](http://cdn.idigitaltimes.com/sites/idigitaltimes.com/files/styles/image_embed/public/2016/07/03/frank-ocean-boys-dont-cry-library-card.jpg), but nothing came until the early hours of August, when a mysterious [livestream](http://static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/05130918/frank-ocean-live-stream-tracks-001-960x640.jpg) of Frank building a staircase to new music began on Apple Music. It was later revealed to be a visual album called [Endless](http://static.highsnobiety.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/19101712/frank-ocean-endless-01-960x640.jpg), and two days later Frank would finally release his second studio album Blonde on August 20th, 2016 with no prior announcement that it was coming. Blonde recieved acclaim from critics, but was purposefully held out of Grammy consideration by Frank.
