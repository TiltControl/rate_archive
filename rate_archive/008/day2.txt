MrSwearword: #UPVOTE THE THREAD, UPVOTE THE THREAD

Let's speculate for funsies. Which artist is taking the most hits today? My guess is Kanye and Chance with maybe 3 Frank songs out.

=====

LuigiEatsPopcorn: Drake will probably lose the rest of his songs, save maybe Hotline Bling. Chance will lose the majority of his songs, but not all. Frank will lose at most 2 songs. Kanye will lose a couple songs.

EDIT: I may have overestimated how well Frank will do. I thought everyone here loves Frank but I guess not.

Definitely one of the heavy gospel songs on *Coloring Book*, and your mileage might vary on that depending on your faith. However, the song does have some interesting elements. Chance has actually gone on record as saying it's his favorite song on the mixtape, and the opening choir lead by his cousin Nicole Steen was inspired by her singing it at his grandmother's funeral. Of course, there's also Jay Electronica, who is well-known in the hip hop community for delaying his debut studio album since *2007*. Whenever he pops up, it's usually fantastic, and the song is no exception.

A lot of the divisiveness among the raters was the intro, which consists of three minutes of choir before the song proper begins, which makes it basically the reverse of "30 Hours". This wasn't a dealbreaker for ***MrSwearword***, who says "It took over 3:16 for the song to kick in, but I ain’t mad at it."

However, ***estreindre*** is less impressed: "the first like three minutes start to get reeeally repeitive like... a minute in. the second half of the song is pretty sweet though."

***awesometuck1559*** is shaky: "I fluctuate on this track. It has some of the best bars on the album, but the gospel intro is overly long and while the vocals are great, I’m impatient af and it bores me real quick. But sometimes I feel like the intro is warranted and appreciate it for everything it is. Right now I’m in an impatient mood."

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** goes in once again: "Jay Electronica and Chance undeniably murder this. Undeniable. And I don't know if I totally agree with all the complaints of how little Chance is on this, but on this track, it kinda shows. Half the song is his cousin singing, and I totally get why it's there, and I love the intention, but it's just kinda really lengthy and doesn't serve much purpose being that long imo. The beat is amazing and all, but when half the song is skippable, it kinda has to be detracted by that. Will say, the transition from Chance's verse to Jay's is phenomenal."

A lot of comments also centered around the religious aspects. ***Therokinrolla*** likes the message: "It approaches too preachy in this song but I think its really great and sweet. Jay Electronica actually practices Islam but both him and Chance came together to sing about Chance’s religion together like why can’t we all work together like this guys? <3"

It brings up some memories for ***camerinian***: "I remember singing that intro song a lot when I lied to myself that I was still religious and went to church camps, so suffice it to say it caps my enjoyment of the song a bit lmao".

***eklxtreme*** isn't a fan at all, though: "intro goes on for way too long, too preachy, you don't believe in science?? Jay Elect is good here but too bad he got tossed onto a bad song."

Yeah, I didn't mention a pretty bad line:

>I don't believe in science

>I believe in signs

Luckily, this is about as problematic as Chance gets.

ExtraEater: **Great Crayon Journey Around New York - Part 10: How Great, Zombies**

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's my scrapped comment which I wrote following my score submissions:

> 10\. How Great - **10** - so i woke up in the bar(ughh) and it turns out last night was so fuckin crazy i was literally inside the bar, like within the brick walls. i used one of the crayons which was like really sharpened to carve myself out. but oh no! the bar was destroyed. long story short (kinda) it turns out there was a new york zombie apocalypse!!! so i tried grabbing my ipod shuffle gen 1 (yes i still use those fuck u millenals) to play the next chance song, "how great", for background music but HOW GREAT, it didn't work. thankfully, i still had two crayons left from chance, so i decided to keep them in case i'd need them (well what'd u think i was gon do anyway). as i traversed through the bar, i saw hugo, u know that bouncer i was talking about earlier who turned into a dinosaur (again, probably a drunk fantasy). turns out he knew this was gonna happen and he told me, "look, why do you still have an ipod shuffle gen 1 are u from the fuckin 70's" and so i punched him in the face. anyway, he told me to follow him outside. well i didn't know what else to do but ok. when we went outside, zombies were everywhere. not like corporate zombies or "deep" "artistic" shit like that, but actual pale zombies. hugo told me to go to the churhc of survivors for shelter. guess what the churhc was literally across the street but hugs was like, "you gotta turn left, then you gotta--" and a zombie bit him or something. so i ran towards the church while he was being assaulted lol (hugs u made a great sacrifice) and i was in. one of them interrogated me, saying "are you a zombie???? show marker for proof". marker? i decided to show him(or her, don't discerimante) my two crayons in hopes that he'd recognize the superior art tool. and then they said "oh my ken bennett, this is the one" he dragged me by the hand and took me to the main churhc area or whatever that praying place is called. the survivors had weird names, and there were only 6, namely Phaxok (he was the priest), Legume (the guy who interrgated me earler), James Dean (other priest), lushacrooks, Nockers, and Pandasex. so phaxok came up to me and said, are you the chosen one? and i was like, "lol. is this abt the crayons. bc i just got these when chance the rapper came to me in a dream". the guy (legume) who dragged me by the hand screamed "chance the rapper?!??! no this ain't the chosen one!" but then james dean entered from the side and "reminded" everyone that "crayon jesus has many names, for he is timeless". legume then shut up and phaxok checked the bible, which looked like a crayola coloring book except super thicc. yada yada yada chance the rapper is apparently crayon jesus, and i was like omg. phax then brought me to a podium which had a small square carving. they were trying to find squares that would actually perfectly fit in there and stuff. and i was like, omg that's the same shape as my ipod shuffle gen 1. and they were all like "wtf u still have an ipod shuffle gen 1 are u from the fuckin 70's", just like hugs ripp. anyway i decided to put the ipod shuffle in and guess what. it strated glowing 'n' shit, and i was like, omg (yes i said that like 3 times already). it was then that how great by chance-er-crayon jesus started playing. and everyone sang "how great is our god" to the tune it was so cool. then suddenly crayon jesus came down from the heavens. all the survivors kneeled down but all i could do was stand there in shock. crayon jesus immeditaely came to me and said in an etheral voice, "child, you are the chosen one" and i was like, O. M. G. he told me that the only way to save new york is to use the power of the magic crayons. he said he was going to do a scavenger hunt thing but because of the zombie apocalypse bullshit he just gave me the magic crayons, which were just all seven colors of the rainbow [([throwback] they might be gants - roy g biv)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gf33ueRXMzQ). (gained magical crayons) after that, he also told me that he would give me a literal life supply of crayola brand crayons. but i was like, what do i do next??? suddenly, zombies invaded the churhc. o shit. chance told me to use the red crayon. so i grabbed the glowing big red one and it turns out it was a super strong laser that instantly killed a zombe. the church of survivors was so sohcked like seriously. but i couldn't wield all 7 crayons myself. so i handed the others to the churhc of suvrivors. i don't relly want to go in2 detail on what each one did but they all did something pretty cool. anyway, with the survivors we cleared new york of the zombies. but like, what was the source of this apoclypse anyway and how will we rebuild the city? civilization might be over as we know it omg. but then suddenly crayon jesus transported me to heaven, which was a colorful rainbow paradise. he told me that the zombie apocalypse stemmed from a (slight) lack of color in heaven. ghosts were unsatisfied with their afterlife n shit and some idiots decided to go back into the real world through illegal metheds or whatevs. but i was like who was draining the color? then suddenly, a giant red dragon ascended from the ground (or clouds, idk). and guess what? it was drake! (or as the crayon bible called him: aubrifer) drake, through the power of boring songs like pop style and redemptton, he took away the color from heaven. crayon jesus fell weak. he said it was up to me to slay drake. i engaged in an epic battle of the heavens using the red magic crayon. then suddenly (2nd time i used that), ken bennett, or crayon god, awoke from his slumber and just used a lightning bolt designed with every color ever to murder drake. it was so powerful that the fabric of space and time basically had a seizure from all the bright-ass colors. when it finally settled down, i woke up in my hotel suite in new york, and everything was normal. but apparently like, i was hailed as a hero and named the **crayon pope**. when i woke up, how great was still playing on my ipod shuffle gen 1. and how great was such a GREAT song omg. like the gospel stuff i loooove it. anyway the world was saved and it was all thanks to me beths. and just like he promised crayon jesus gave me a lifetime supply of crayons!!! also the mayor (or whoever leads NY) of new york awarded me with the nobel peace prize. like i don't kno if he's authorized to do that but he did anyway. there was a parade and everything and i played no problem [throwback???] in celebration during the parade yayyyy. now this is what i call a happy ending. but what happened to all those survivors? and what happened to hugo??? here's a quick convenient brad bunch style summary: Phaxok became a part-time priest/photographer, Legume became a paid robber,  James Dean opened a music store, lushacrooks became a hot dog vendor, Nockers just lived a regular life got a wife (yes he's straight) and job and evryting, and Pandasex decided to be a bouncer of the bar. and you know those weird drake lookalikes i met at the hotel and bar? turns out they were runaways from hell lol. hugo, though, he wanted to take it easy so he moved to new zealand where he lived in leisure forever. but you know me? i met and was blessed by crayon jesus but i haven't even finished his album! i continued traversing through new york to listen to the rest of the tracks. god bless.

> crayons left: 🖍xinfinity

**tl;dr** zombie apocalypse in new york -> no more zombie apocalypse in new york

Yep. I'm sure a lot of people expected this to be higher, and a lot expected it to be lower. I don't know if a #1 single has ever been this low in one of our rates, but if anyone was gonna get that dishonor it's fitting that it's Drake. I won't high and say I didn't wish this was higher but I guess I didn't expect it to be much higher then this.

***JoeThaMo*** sums it up: "Catchy track, but way overplayed". I think without the overplay it might have been even higher.

***camerinian*** thinks similarly: "I used to be crazy sick of this song, but it’s rebounded back into being tolerable again, so that must mean something". I think most people (except me obviously) were sick of the song at one point.

Very conflicted is ***bluehxrizon***: "i said i would drag this song but its too catchy" and on that side is ***booooam***: "I just hate myself for that I like this song. Bland beat, bland lyrics, bland background vocals and yet it’s my favorite track on this album."

***Reifiui*** is less conflicted about his dislike: "The beat feels horribly... Disjointed, like all the elements weren't properly put together, and they just kinda sound like they're hanging around without any energy or tightness, also these lyrics are so cheesy it hurts".

***dirdbub*** throws a bit of shade. "The only reason that this song got to 1B streams on Spotify is because that no one can stand more than 3 minutes of Drake". Hey.

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** is just confused: "How was this song a huge hit??? It's so forgettable."

The worst tragedy belongs to ***MrSwearword***: "This song tries to ruin gogo boys for me, so fuck this song."

WHYYYYYYY. This fantastic song ended up sticking around higher then most of the other songs on the album for most of the month before falling down to #38 late on. It makes me want to cry I swear, this should have been TOP 10.

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** knows what I'm thinking! "Best song off of Views, no question. It's one of the best Noah beats I've heard honestly, and it is literally the most refined and perfect version of Drake's singy-songy/rap combination. It's the GOAT walking the city while it's raining thinking about that one girl you really want to be with but can't and am I crying".

***MrSwearword*** admits the truth: "Fine, it’s a Drake song that doesn’t suck…on this album".

***YankeeHankyPanky*** also has some positive thoughts: "It’s bold and energetic, a refreshing change of pace on the album."

In more middling reactions is ***Therokinrolla***, who says "A real problem I have with this album is that a lot of the songs are just alright. Around a 6 or 7, they aren’t bad, in fact, they’re pretty good. But not great. Nothing standout. Would be GREAT filler if there was better content to fill the spaces of."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** agrees: "Solid track but it just feels like it's missing something. It's not as catchy as it thinks it is (but the production is p cool)".

Funny enough, both ***Awhile2*** ("this vaporwave influence") and ***enecks*** ("The beat is like bad vaporwave") have opposite vaporwave reactions. If only it was [Simpsonwave](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rTfa-9aCTYg).

Justin Bieber's appearance on this song pretty much dominated the comments on what many considered a forgettable entry on the album.

**JUSTIN BIEBER RELATED COMMENTS**

"What fucking idiot decided to give Justin Bieber a bridge and Towkio the hook? Not to mention that the song is slow and boring with a corny ass concept." - ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***

"Justin Bieber ruins something. SURPRISE" - ***MrSwearword***

"I don't particularly have any hate for this song, or Justin, but it definitely is the weak point on the album for me. The chorus is good, but everything else does not hold my attention, unfortunately." - ***ThatParanoidPenguin***

"fantastic. Justin Bieber's part on this is surprisingly strong, and Chance's flow is super strong." - ***estreindre***

"Slow and features Justin Bieber… a low point but I still can juke to it ;)" - ***Therokinrolla***

"Nice slow song, great production. Justin Bieber did well on it." - ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***

"Bieb why" - ***JoeThaMo***

"An alright slow jam, but Justin Bieber’s refrain does almost nothing for me. The beat saves it for me, good head-bobbing shit." - ***awesometuck1559***

"pulls off the nostalgia vibe well but it's not interesting enough, I don't like how hard it sounds like JB is trying" - ***eklxtreme***

"I like the woozy tone of the song and Bieber’s contribution, but maybe it’s a bit too downtempo, like it could easily just sink into the background." - ***camerinian***

"Would be a low 6 but Bieber's feature is amazing" - ***YankeeHankyPanky***

"JB on a Chance song was NOT something I expected when the mixtape dropped, but damn this actually has flow and is good. solid song" - ***dirdbub***

" was listening to this song at a bar in the afternoon. it was so laidback then. but i heard the bar gets real weird at night. is it true though? anyway, when justin started singing in the song some jerky dude started to beat up the bartender and it took an off-duty bouncer to off him. the bouncer was really nice, his name was hugo. it turns out that guy was a regular that they knew was troublesome but was so easy to beat up. if you ask me i think the power of justin bieber compelled him👀. my crayons miraculously remained safe throughout all of this." - ***ExtraEater***

---

Yeah, I wasn't kidding about dominating the comments.

Just about the only non-Bieber focused comment is from ***booooam***, who said "Surprisingly good." Yup.

Another Chance song goes down! I'll be honest, even though I did give this an 8 I kinda forget it exists. The second song on this rate to feature Future, this was a unique collab that surprisingly worked pretty well.

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** enjoyed it: "Love the autotune here, and there's a lot of cool stuff going on with vocal delivery and the beat. It's kinda forgotten, but it is one of my personal favorites from the album."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** agrees on that: "The bass in the chorus and the synths in the second verse are the shit. The hook is awesome and the vibe of this whole song is really chill and great."

However, like "Grammys" Future's guest appearance divided some. ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** unsurprisingly is on the positive side only for Future: "redeemed by Future."

It actually defied expectations for ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***: "I don’t like Future but this one is pretty good. Chance has great verses and singing, so it really brings the song up."

***awesometuck1559*** is impressed with everything but Future: "“WEEDeserve.” get it? Jokes aside, I really enjoy the instrumentation on this album, and Chance’s flow is really good. Future’s feature is nothing special." Commas is S H O O K.

***camerinian*** isn't impressed with much: "This is a fine song, but there's very little "Chance" about it, y'know? Like this could be any rapper". Not much else to say from the sub here.

Actually the third song not on *The Life of Pablo* to feature contributions from Kanye (after his production credits on "U With Me?" and "Feel No Ways"), the opening track on *Coloring Book* bounced around a bit before landing here.

A huge point of contention for many people on "All We Got" is the less than spectacular mixing, especially on Kanye's chorus vocals. ***bluehxrizon*** is just confused: "okay this started off good and I don’t know if this is just my headphones but the mixing sounds absolutely awful". SCREMAing

***Awhile2*** agrees: "the mixing on this track is just not good". So does ***letsallpoo***: "the mixing is so aggravating".

***Therokinrolla*** has my favorite comment for this one: "This was the first track I ever listened to from Chance, and when I heard his voice I was literally sent to heaven. His voice is EPIC. And every piece of this track is so joyful and happy. A really cheerful song unlike the rest of this rate. A nice intro into the album, a plethora of different sounds, including trumpets, a choir, introduces themes such as his faith. Really quite excellent." Love it!

***JoeThaMo*** is also very positive! "This song always makes me feel super happy, I love it". Chance's effect.

A bit more restrained is ***TwentyOneParrots***: "It's not as good as Ultralight Beam but it's still hella good, and works as a great complement to it." ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** thinks the opposite: "This is like Ultralight Beam, but better."

***awesometuck1559*** has a good story: "Starting the album off on a high note. I remember starting up this album for the first time while taking a nice bubble bath, and as soon as I heard Chance start to say “And we back…” I had a huge grin on my face. You can literally hear his smile. Underutilized Kanye, though." [Literally Tuck](https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2016/12/screen-shot-2016-12-12-at-1-47-49-pm.png?w=807)

> 1\. All We Got - **10** - i loved this song. it was the first song i listened to (duh) as i explored the city. damn it felt like there were big signs saying "Welcome to New York!

Welcome back, Frank! This chill, trippy slow burn of a track wasn't helped by being sandwiched between two fantastic songs in "Solo" and "Self Control" and became his second song out of the rate.

***estreindre*** knows what I'm saying: "honestly, even though this song is pretty good, i feel it's overshadowed pretty heavily by most of the album?" So does ***awesometuck1559***: "Sort of forgettable, especially coming off of ‘Solo’. Wasn’t really feeling this track as much as the first 4."

***letsallpoo*** has a decent point: "this feels like an interlude". I'm sorry but I love it.

***camerinian*** was caught by surprise: "I thought this was gonna end up another totally uninteresting track but the way it built up to the multi tracking at the end was actually pretty good".

In one of the more negative reactions, ***Therokinrolla*** says "Listen Frankie, I get it. This is a slow-burning, atmospheric track. But I’m way too into instant gratification to get tracks like that. I appreciate it, really. But I’m not going to listen to this track again. Sorry."

***TwentyOneParrots*** is a little conflicted: "This album constantly toes the line between 'beautiful' and 'overly-artsy' and I think this song does that more than most of the other songs."

While ***eklxtreme*** does love it ("I like how the production is super dreamy and psychedelic"), this was pretty much the song that broke everyone's strong opinions. RIP.

Another song I was expecting to be higher up. This song, originally called "High Lights", at one point had vocals from Madonna, but on the final track the backing vocals were performed by a mix of Young Thug, El DeBarge, and The-Dream. I guess this ties the two rates together by some kind of extreme measure.

***JoeThaMo*** loved it: "The Ray J line is iconic, and production-wise this might actually be my favorite song off of TLOP". Not the only person to reference the Ray J line. It ended up making the song for ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***: "I wasn't feeling the song until he starts rapping about Ray J and things got better from there."

***enecks*** drops hints that he has no opinion on the song: "I have no opinion of this".

Another big fan is ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***: "I really like this one. Slightly flawed, another silly early verse, but aside from that part, I think the song works really well. I really like Kanye’s second verse in this one, and the outro too."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** is another fan: "The first verse of this is the first place on the album that the lyrics seem kinda dumb without a great reason or point to make, but the production and features are still fantastic. El Debarge is my favorite, he sounds like magic." ***eklxtreme*** agrees: "Kanye's flow is pretty nice here, production is really catchy, i love El DeBarge's part".

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** is more mixed: "I really do enjoy this song, but god is it basic. The percussion is fun but gets really old. The lines are funny but the delivery is kinda flat, although I do love the chorus. And Young Thug is way underutilized. The-Dream kills the outro tho."

***ExtraEater*** sent me a picture of a highlighter.

The final track on *Blonde*, "Futura Free" has a rambling, freeform style on the first half and a second half made up of low quality interviews with Frank, his brother, and his friends. At 9 minutes long, it's also the longest song in the rate.

This length (and the interviews) divided commenters. ***Therokinrolla*** was speechless about the song: "This is. This is nice. This is really nice. I feel like the whole album was a lead up to this points. Its… I don’t know guys its something. Its definitely art and its definitely excellent and… Yea. I wish I could say more."

On the other hand, ***MrSwearword***: "I want these NINE FUCKING MINUTES BACK." I don't.

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** wrote an essay just about: "Honestly would be in competition for the 11 if it wasn't for Nights. This track is completely underrated, and I think it gets looked over because people don't like the stitched interview in the second half. I personally don't fully understand it, but it is certainly meaningful, and I love how it seems like a normal sample of an interview, but is actually created by a bunch of different sources. As for the first half, it's flawless. There's a spontaneous aspect to the delivery of the vocals, and the lyrics are some of the strongest on the whole album, and the layering of vocals that happens in the second verse is just phenomenal. And the beat switch, oh the beat switch. Frank just goes IN. When Frank says "Menage on my birthday", it's as if every collective L from /r/frankocean is just cleansed. Also, the title references one of my favorite fonts, so that's a W in my book."

In sharp contrast, ***ExtraEater*** is simply unimpressed: "For a 9-minute outro, it's kinda underwhelming tbh". ***awesometuck1559*** is annoyed: "Good song, but holy shit why did it need a five-minute outro, what the fuck".

***estreindre*** is conflicted: "this is a really good end to the album on a first listen, but tbh it's also only a song i've ever listened to like... twice, because it's basically just a slightly less good version of nikes with a lot of stuff that's boring after first listen added onto the end."

Another chill, trippy Frank song that's going out in the 30s, this song didn't get too many comments but divided the scores more then other tracks on *Blonde.*

***awesometuck1559*** is one of the big positive reactions: "A little overly long, but I didn’t get bored. I enjoyed it."

Also on that side is ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***: "Some of the most beautiful simple production yet. Some of my favorite lyrics too."

***estreindre*** is a big fan: "another song from this album that i really love, probably my second fave behind self control, that i don't think will do as well as it deserves. this song is probably the most beautiful one on the entire album to me, and "i'll do anything for you (in the dark)" is my favorite lyric of all time for reasons i can't quite explain." So is ***TheAllRightGatsby***: "Really beautiful and vulnerable track."

Frank actually fucked ***ExtraEater*** up a little: "quit playing with my headphones dammit".

***camerinian*** is just bored: "Yikes this drags on doesn't it." ***eklxtreme*** agrees: "melancholy but not as strong as the other tracks and it goes on for too long". ***MrSwearword*** is just over: "This is redundant shit. Wasn’t this guitar beat on like, 3 tracks ago?"

It's almost like we forgot about Drake. One of Drake's trademark stream of consciousness type tracks, this song references Weston Road, the street in Toronto where Drake grew up. It's mostly built around a sample of "Mary's Joint" by Mary J. Blige, yet another example of Drake's intense burning love for 90s R&B nostalgia.

And because it's a Drake song with a great sample, here once again are the comments praising the sample and not Drake.

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** ("Excellent sample, one of the album's underrated highlights."), ***bluehxrizon*** ("amazing sample"), ***Awhile2*** ("this sample gives me life"), and ***raicicle*** ("The Mary J Blige sample on this is pretty great.") all brought it up.

In non-sample stuff, we have ***awesometuck1559*** praising "Really good flow on this one, and an interesting perspective on fame and what it does to relationships."

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** loves it: "Okay, I fuck with this song. The lyrics are much better and the production is amazing."

A pretty vicious roast comes from ***dirdbub***: "I really don’t know what to think about this song. at all. like, is it supposed to be emotional? is he just spouting shit? is he trying to get a point across? everything he says just goes in one ear and out the other. impressive, really, that this album has been consistently doing that the whole time". Jeez.

***Therokinrolla*** has some faint praise, however: "The first song my foot started tapping to. That has to mean something???". I guess it's a little too late for Drake. Or is it?

Don't act like that wasn't coming for a lot of the Views criticisms. The productions were semi-bearable but it's just Drake himself sounding bad and like he doesn't connect with the material.

This being this low makes me so sad, what is up with y'all?? A very unique case of sampling, producer Francis and the Lights flipped his own fantastic underrated "[Friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wScYn10D2vo)" months before the original was even out. It worked alot, and both versions I love.

The song deals with some heavy topics, and ***awesometuck1559*** mentions it: "Francis and the Lights’ production here is fantastic. Expertly deals with the issue of Chicago crime and growing up around the gang life through a sort of weird nostalgic lense." So does ***Therokinrolla***: "I listened to Blond and didn’t think this rate could get more depressing. I was wrong. Literally singing about your friends being killed? Never has murder been so pleasing to listen to, though." Both loved the song though.

***TheAllRightGatsby*** loves it: "That intro is amazing, and the atmosphere runs all the way through. Chance straddles the line between nostalgic and heartbroken, and he leaves me feelin some real-ass shit. Shoutout to Jeremih's outro, too."

***JoeThaMo*** enjoyed the song as well. "Very sweet production that contrasts the pretty heavy lyrics super well".

In more mixed reactions, ***eklxtreme*** toed the line: "very mellow vibe and nice bass-y production, I like the reflective themes, Jeremih kinda saves the track from being boring".

***JunkyGS*** kills my soul a little bit: "Yeap this song is just as annoying as I remember." HOW WHAT... sorry.

***letsallpoo*** asks "is this even a song?" YES AND A GREAT ONEE

The second half of the two part "Father Stretch My Hands" epic, this song took a lengthy excerpt from Desiigner's little-known "Panda" and made it a megahit. After "Pt. 2" was first played at Madison Square Garden for Yeezy Season 3 and Desiigner was announced as the new GOOD Music signee (and also after a lengthy period where people tried to figure out whether it was [Future](https://pics.onsizzle.com/Twitter-When-the-crowd-start-yelling-perform-83d5bb.png) or not), "Panda" blew up and would top the Billboard charts weeks later. Kanye and Desiigner would later team up again on the remix to Desiigner's ["Tiimmy Turner"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ucu9fgpSvUA).

Since the song is barely two minutes in length, there topics for commenters were limited and that left most people to comment on Desiigner and "Panda". Here, unedited, are those comments.

"I love Panda and Kanye's remix of it." - ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***

"This was one of my favorites upon that first listen but when I later found out it was just Panda with a really dope Kanye verse I was sad. However, the verse is fire, the intro is quite something, and the outro is possibly the best moment of being "stitched together" that the album has a lot of." - ***ThatParanoidPenguin***

"i always think of this song when i'm listening to father stretch my hands and panda sex🐼✋🐼✋🐼✋" - ***ExtraEater*** (uhh)

"I love Panda. It’s so hype. This makes it into a more structured song with more buildup. The bit at the end is lovely" - ***enecks***

"I like Panda but come on this is just lazy" - ***Reifiui***

"Kanye doing some sweet rapping over Panda? Hell yes sign me up" - ***Therokinrolla***

"the Panda part just sounds so out of place now" - ***letsallpoo***

"I always found this one way worse than part 1. I don’t like the Kanye verse, and I never liked Desiigner, and the production feels a lot weirder. It’s not the worst though, I can listen to it just fine." - ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***

"I mean, most of the song rides on the sheer beauty of ‘Panda’, but, hey, it’s a pretty great flip." - ***raicicle***

"I lowkey enjoy this more than the original Panda, both are great tho" - ***JoeThaMo***

"It’s like a better version of Panda, though Kanye’s flow is a little off. I really enjoy the outro by Caroline Shaw." - ***awesometuck1559***

"Pretty awesome track; it's a little more standard trap fare, but the Panda sample is awesome, and the Caroline Shaw outro at the end is one of the best moments on the album." - ***TheAllRightGatsby***

"wildest song of the year, the transition from Pt 1 to 2 makes my heartbeat shoot up by 50 bpm, the gospel sample is worked into Panda really fucking well" - ***eklxtreme***

"Panda was an infectious and amazing earworm. Kanye makes it even better." - ***YankeeHankyPanky***

"I honestly don’t understand the Panda sample in this song. it just seems to stop the flow so hard in the song, and doesn’t seem to work as a Pt. 2 to FSMH to me. it feels more like a Panda remix than an actual follow-up to FSMH. not to mention all the other samples in the song; it just feels scattered all over the place" - ***dirdbub***

There could be only one. Even with the sub's burning hatred for the album I still expected this song to pull out to at least day 3, and it came close, but some late in the month scores buried it for good outside of the top 20. Not even Rihanna could carry Drake that far.

A glowing review comes from ***TheAllRightGatsby***: "RiRi's too good, and the Popcaan sample is on point, production's great, and Drake's part isn't bad either."

***ExtraEater*** is also a fan: "I love the tropical feel to this song. Sounds similar to Take Care considering that it's good, a Rihanna/Drake pair, and probably deserving of Top 10." So is ***VodkaInsipido***: "Why wasn’t this a big hit as One Dance or Hotline Bling? Rihanna and Drake can the best musical couple in a pop song."

A few similar notes came from ***Awhile2*** ("its my least favorite RiRi x Drake song but they can do no wrong together") and ***JoeThaMo*** ("Honestly not THAT great for a Rih collab imo, [bug](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/cc/A_Bug's_Life.jpg) it's still pretty catchy").

***eklxtreme*** ("the instrumental is pretty generic and it sounds very inauthentic but it’s catchy, only rihanna’s part is good") and ***dirdbub*** ("Rihanna is the only reason I sort of like this song. at all") also had very similar reactions in only liking Rihanna.

***enecks*** drags: "If it wasn’t for Treat You Better, this’d be the douchiest song of 2016." How dare you.

My favorite comment is from ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***: "Solid". Thanks.

Performed live on [Jimmy Fallon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0MlL4faTsTE) back when Chance's upcoming project was still being called *Chance 3*, this is the first version of "Blessings" that appears on the mixtape. With guest appearances from Jamila Woods, Byron Cage, and the Social Experiment, this is one of the more gospel-focused songs on *Coloring Book*.

This also became the song where Chance converted popheads to religion. ***Therokinrolla*** is up for it: "Such a fuckin smooth Christian song like damn if Kanye and Chance preached I might actually go to church :hands:".

***TheAllRightGatsby*** agrees: "I'm not a religious man, but Chance takin me to church. Really though this song puts a big smile on my face and makes me appreciate all the little things in life. The joy is infectious." Same with ***TwentyOneParrots***: "Chance is this close to making a Christian of my atheist ass".

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** wishes: "As someone who grew up in a Christian household (I am an atheist now), I would prefer this over 98 percent of the Christian songs that my parents keep playing."

Another big fan of the track is ***ThatParanoidPenguin***: "Oh fuck, Jamila Woods. Yes. This feels like more stripped down successor to Sunday Candy, and oh yes does it succeed. I know a lot of people were put off by the Christian themes in this album, but this is probably the strongest track with heavy allusions to faith. The verses are great stuff, and I just love how happy this song is."

However, there were detractors. ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** hasn't been swayed by Chance's charm: "hey remember when Chance was a normal dude and not a preacher". Neither is ***JunkyGS***: "This song made me into an atheist".

***dirdbub*** is just mixed: "slow Chance is good, but idk this isn’t really for me".

ExtraEater: **Great Crayon Journey Around New York - Part 4: Waaaay Up I Feel Blessed (idk i can't think of a relevant title)**

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's my comment for this song:

> 4\. Blessings - **10** - i listened to blessings. it was pretty relaxing just like summer friends. but i also wanted to go to a movie, so i called a taxi. but then i fell asleep(!!!) in the taxi on the way to see a movie so the taxi driver kicked me out and forced me to pay in one crayon. oh no! also i never got to see that movie because it turns out literally every movie they had scheduled really sucked. well at least the album was good so far. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

[The dream is over](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bV-K9CTQHhY). In a record breaking display of failure, Drake loses all 19 of his songs before the end of day 2. In an even better show of the sub's opinion towards *Views* in general, the last remaining song is a bonus track that came out months before the album on Soundcloud. While this song actually started fairly low, it started stacking up the 10s as the month went on, but it wasn't enough. Sorry, Drake fans. Maybe next time.

To ***camerinian***, it's a problematic fave: "Even though the lyrics are a bit toxic, this song only gets better and better the more I hear it. There was genuinely nothing like it at the time, and I feel like that fact is a bit underappreciated".

***JoeThaMo*** loved it: "I had this song playing on repeat when it first came out and it's still catchy as fuck. The MV is also lowkey adorable tbh".

"Hotline Bling" is known for briefly being labeled as a remix of D.R.A.M.'s "Cha Cha" before it was dropped around the song's single release. ***letsallpoo*** remembers: "Is it a gentrified version of "Cha Cha"? Yes. Is it still amazing and arguably better than its source material? Also yes." So does ***ThatParanoidPenguin***: "It's not as good as Cha Cha, but it's good. It's crazy the song never went #1, but everything about it, from the definitive pop direction, to the dope music video, to the single cover (god, whoever does Drake's single covers needs to be in a museum) is just great fun. My biggest issue, is the same issue I have with a lot of Drake songs, and it's his poppy radio songs often have just one too many hooks for my taste (and even the bridge can't save this). This song is a little too repetitive for my tastes, so I rarely listen the full way (same with Started From the Bottom). However, the beat is insanely good, the chorus is wonderful, and his flow is just great."

***Therokinrolla*** is just relieved it's over: "This song has a 10 because it is the final track and I made it! Almost one and a half hours of grueling and boring music that had me on the brink of death. No more tears. I would say this album will give me nightmares, but it isn’t memorable enough. I’ve done it, bitches."

It grew on ***dirdbub***: "this song is a grower. didn’t like it AT ALL at first, but then it really grew on me! so that’s good. I guess". I wish it grew on more people :(

"More like cataracts" - ***MrSwearword***

"overall i think this is a solid album, not as good as take care or IYRTITL. the first part is amazing, the second part is kinda boring. i fake hated it because it overshadowed beyoncé (on the charts)." - ***mokitsu***

Let's be honest, did anyone not see this coming? Since the rate was announced, most people called *Views* getting 1989d, and sure enough it happened. I'd like to say that Drake was dragged down as the month went on, but apart from a song or two sneaking briefly into the top 20 it dipped mostly into the bottom half. I feel it got a bad rap. Is it Drake's best project? No. Is it a great album? Not really. But it has some bops, I guess?

Drake also sets a pretty lousy record for the rate threads. With 40+ submissions and hundreds of scores sent in, not a single 11 was given to *Views*.

deleted: I actually agree at this point. In no case is an album deserving of a 3. Even based on just lyrics or vocals or production, somehow an album released with such major resources, it should never receive something that low.

Guys, just because you don't like the person or a few songs doesn't mean everything else is.

I don't care for Britney, and I honestly didn't like the album Glory at all, but I still gave it a 6-7 overall rating, probably a bit higher even. Put some sensible thought into your rates, and not just *I hate this because other people act like it is shit*

We hadn't heard from Franky in a while, and what a song to come back on. Just when you thought that Donald Trump and Lil Yachty were the worst people to be connected to an artist in this rate, this emotional song featuring gospel singer Kim Burrell was made problematic through her revealing herself recently as a [huge fucking homophobe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iZXu_DRQd1s). Frank's mother even recently expressed wishes for Burrell to be [cut off the song](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/hip-hop/7640798/frank-ocean-mom-katonya-breaux-kim-burrell-blonde) entirely. I have to think that had the story broke before most of the scores had been sent in that it would have had a noticeable effect.

Noted *Blonde* critic and hater of what I love ***MrSwearword*** loves the song: "THANK GAGA this track exists." Maybe I won't drag *Joanne* quite as hard.

Another lover of the song is ***ThatParanoidPenguin***: "Astoundingly beautiful, really. Another track that really gets lost by the hype from Solo/Self Control/Nights, but it's just amazing. Kim Burrell's featured vocals are some of my favorite on the whole album, and the instrumental just does a great job of building up and being so dissonant, and the lead into Futura Free is perfect."

***Therokinrolla*** agrees with both: "Sad and slow, akin the rest of the album. But something is different about this track and I really like it."

***estreindre*** is a little more mixed: "this song... i've never quite clicked with this one honestly, and usually skip it, but whenever i do listen to it it's super good. it's just that this song always makes me just want to listen to White Ferrari or Seigfreid instead haha".

***TwentyOneParrots*** is more direct: "This song fucked me up". SAME.

Yep, a rate of 2016 popular music has a song featuring T-Pain in the top 25! This two-part song features a group of guest vocalists, including T-Pain, Kirk Franklin (marking the second Chance-Franklin collab of the year after "Ultralight Beam"), and the underrated and immensely talented [Noname](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pUncXbXAiV0).

***eklxtreme*** is very happy for one of those guests, "T-PAIN IS BACK BITCHES, chorus and melodies are so great, Noname is amazing, such nice vibes".

***dirdbub*** was surprised by it: "I didn’t expect to like this song, but as I sat through it more I just started to vibe out harder. this song is legit".

***awesometuck1559*** shouts out Noname: "As this sub’s resident NoName stan, I think I am obligated to give this song a 10. This feels sort of like a spiritual successor to Pusha Man/Paranoia, and what a worthy successor it is. Love this track." I agree!

In more muted reactions, we have ***Therokinrolla***: "I don’t like that it just sounds like Chance put two songs together rather than connecting them somehow, and I don’t find the first one to stand out really. Drown is nice, but I have to judge this as one song, so that’s represented in my score. Half of it is boring, the other half is pretty good."

***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** agrees: "Alright song, I think it has some low points. I don’t exactly like the “dodododododododos” in this song."

***ExtraEater*** hates the title: "i hate the title"

This was one of my serious 11 contenders, and I'm disappointed in all of you for letting it not even make it to day 3. The first released song from *Blonde*, dropping in the form of a trippy, beautiful [music video](https://vimeo.com/179791907) (NSFW) the morning that the album dropped.

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** is a huge fan of it: "One of the best songs of the year. Beautiful/iconic video. His pitching up of his voice worked perfectly for the opener."

Another is ***booooam***: "Easily one of my favorites of the whole rate. It just sets the perfect tone for the whole album. I really don’t mind the high pitched voice in the first part, I prefer the version with the low pitched voiceover tho. Also the video is A E S T H E T I C."

***estreindre*** also enjoys the pitch shift: "i'm one of the two people that actually really like the pitch-shifting on it, and i REALLY love some of the lyrics on this track. i think it goes on for a little too long though, and it's probably one of my least replayed tracks off the album."

However, unsurprisingly the pitch shift wasn't entirely loved. ***Therokinrolla*** is one of the non-fans: "Like most of the tracks on Blond, I like what Frankie is trying to say, but can he say it less dull? I don’t enjoy his wacky squeaky voice?"

Nobody hates it more then ***camerinian*** though: "Why the fuck does he use that vocal filter, legit the worst way to open the album".

***JoeThaMo*** came around on it: "It took me a while to get used to the weird pitch change, but now I love this song as much as I do the rest of the album".

My favorite comment comes from ***dirdbub***, who reviewed the rarer version of the song from Frank's Boys Don't Cry magazine, which had a verse from Japanese rapper KOHH: "KOHH’s verse is up there near verse of the year, goddamn".

awesometuck1559: Because you're acting like the results of rate threads are the word of God. They're not. It's a fun event for users to joke around, get fake-mad, then move on.

So what if a Selena Gomez song won over a Miley Cyrus song? Of course the results are gonna be skewed, there are common opinions on the sub.

A surprising end to the second day, I think a lot of people were expecting this to go higher. But two 0s didn't help much. This is also one of the earliest songs from TLOP to be previewed when it was played during [Yeezy Season 2](https://vimeo.com/139523344).

***Mudkip1***'s comment for this song is my fave <3: "this is all i have to say tbh http://i.imgur.com/Wgy4Q25.png".

Particular praise was given by ***camerinian***: "I can’t deny it, this song showcases exactly what I love about Kanye. His fantastic ear for samples, his constant pushing of the edge of sanity, his ability to make something potentially so abrasive into a fucking instant dance classic, Kanye can’t be restrained into a single genre and this crosses so many boundaries that it’s just kind of incredible to watch unfold".

***booooam*** loved it: "Love everything about this track especially the perfect baseline. It’s like early House, Hip-Hop and a workout song were mashed together and what comes out is perfection."

A few people found it repetitive, however, including ***estreindre*** ("starts to get reaaaally repetitive in my opinion, but still pretty solid.") and ***Therokinrolla*** ("The repetition of “I feel it Fade” gets super annoying but lets be real that beat is sick.")

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** praises the song! "I fucking ~~hate~~ love Post Malone and his 20 second part ~~almost~~ totally ~~destroys~~ saves the song." (I totally didn't edit that).

**Random comments including furries:**

"Invented furries." - ***enecks***

"The music video turned me into a straight and a furry" - ***Reifiui***

ExtraEater: a recap of every part i revealed so far from the **great crayon journey around new york**:

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. i recorded journal entries. here they are:

> Part 1\. All We Got - **10** - i loved this song. it was the first song i listened to (duh) as i explored the city. damn it felt like there were big signs saying "Welcome to New York! It's been waiting for you!" at the time, i thought those could've been lyrics for a song, but then i realized that would be way too cheesy. at least no artist *actually* uses those lyrics. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍

> Part 3\. Summer Friends - **9** - i stopped by a nice resort hotel as i listened to this song. the song is soooo relaxing and it reminded me of summertime as a kid. the crayons i had i kept safe in my bag. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍🖍

> Part 4\. Blessings - **10** - i listened to blessings. it was pretty relaxing just like summer friends. but i also wanted to go to a movie, so i called a taxi. but then i fell asleep(!!!) in the taxi on the way to see a movie so the taxi driver kicked me out and forced me to pay in one crayon. oh no! also i never got to see that movie because it turns out literally every movie they had scheduled really sucked. well at least the album was good so far. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

> Part 8\. Juke Jam - **9** - i was listening to this song at a bar in the afternoon. it was such a laidback time. but i heard the bar gets real weird at night. is it true though? i looked at my phone. the next song in the album was All Night. perhaps it was going to be. anyway, when justin started singing in the song some jerky dude started to beat up the bartender and it took an off-duty bouncers to off him. the bouncer was really nice, his name was hugo. it turns out that guy was a regular that they knew was troublesome but was so easy to beat up. if you ask me i think the power of justin bieber compelled him👀. my crayons miraculously remained safe throughout all of this. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

> Part 11\. Smoke Break - **7** - *turns on ipod shuffle gen 1* *puts cigarette in mouth* whatever. *smoke*

> Part 12\. Finish Line / Drown - **7** - i hate the song title

[my reveal for part 10 how great is so long so i'm just going to link it lmao](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5o0ach/rate_reveal_the_life_of_pablo_vs_views_vs_blonde/dcfns3g/)

deleted: i feel like a lot of TLOP will probably fall in the 20-11 range, the songs i see making top 10 are ultralight beam, father stretch my hands pt 1, no more parties in LA, maybe wolves and/or real friends. 

chance will probably have same drugs and maybe all night/no problem in top 10. 

frank will probably have ivy, self control, nights, and solo in top ten and maybe white ferrari too.
