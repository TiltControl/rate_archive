Awhile2: the only way this rate can be redeemed is if Solo (Reprise) gets the top spot on the interlude rate but knowing how much this sub loves memes itll probably be silver surfer intermission

TheAllRightGatsby: Ayyy I'm actually here on time for one of these, for once! I don't think Views deserved the clobbering it got (especially a few of the songs which are great), and both of my favorite Chance songs are already out, but I have high hopes for this top 20! All the best Frank songs and most of the best Kanye songs are still in, and even Chance has some fantastic songs in play too! Almost positive it's gonna be a ULB #1, which I have no problems with, but I hope White Ferrari, Self Control, FSMH Pt 1, Wolves, and FML are all up there.

This one has an interesting history. It was the third song on Kanye's original SWISH/WAVES tracklist, but was dropped as new versions came in and Kanye got rid of the WAVES title. However, following some pushing by [Chance the Rapper](http://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/blame-chance.jpg) that lead to a brief album delay, the song was released with the Tidal version of TLOP.

***awesometuck1559*** enjoys the track: "Fucking fantastic song. Although Chris Brown makes me feel queasy, Cudi’s moans are utilized so perfectly that it makes up for it. Singlehandedly inspired a meme."

Many people focused on the inclusion of walking problematic "fave" Chris Brown, who was actually specifically requested by Kanye because of his [controversial status](http://allhiphop.com/2016/12/13/fonzworth-bentley-talks-helping-kanye-west-create-waves-featuring-chris-brown/).

***YankeeHankyPanky*** sums it up pretty well: "Great song but Chris Brown is P R O B L E M A T I C".

***camerinian*** is impressed: "This is Kanye’s most beautiful song that he’s released since MBDTF, better than Ultralight imo. Never thought it would take Kanye to get something good out of Chris Brown, but 2016 is full of surprises". Same with ***TheAllRightGatsby***: "Fuck Chris Brown generally, but good god he sounds like heaven here. He's never sounded better. Also Cudi's part is perfect here. Kanye's part on here is whatever though."

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** goes into strong detail for the 83rd time this rate: "HHH said this was basically a Chris Brown song with a Kanye feature, but god is that wrong. The beat is totally one of my favorites on the album (the way it bounces around is just phenomenal, especially near the end when it's just instrumental, and the drums kick so fucking hard), and I think the lyrics are probably the worst on the album, but it's extremely catchy and fun. It feels like a really spacey song, which both works, especially near the end, but it also feels like a 5 minute song even though it's only 3. Cudi absolutely gets you in a trance though, he gets the spot for MOTY (moan of the year)."

***ExtraEater*** once again confuses me: "🌊 i always think of this song when i'm surfing right before I fall off the surfboard and give myself to the sea, absorbing the essence of the waves and all of the universe, when i can see and feel everything. the oceans. the planets. the children. the gods. god bless ye. 🌊". M E M E S i guess? This sounds like a vaporwave song title.

This song is unique in the rate in that it was added after the album was released. Referencing a few of Kanye's post-TLOP messes and public incidents, the song was added to the final tracklist during the promotion for the newly announced Saint Pablo Tour.

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** has high praises: "The last Kanye song from my top 3 songs of the year. More extremely self-aware lyrics. "I wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-fiiiiiive" is one of the best lyrics of the year; the callback to We Don't Care works perfectly. The voice crack when he says "Real family stick together and see through the mirage" shows his emotions really well. Sampha's hook is just perfect. Nothing bad to say about this song."

So does ***ThatParanoidPenguin***: "Honestly, a masterpiece. I listened to the leaked version so many times, and with good reason. The verses are the strongest on the album, and Sampha delivers the fucking most beautiful vocals on the whole album. My problem (and why it's not an 11) is I love the original line "Understand I'm under oath with my hand on the book", and it's not like a don't mind more Sampha (I don't), but I think the original version flows a lot better."

***JoeThaMo*** just wishes it was around earlier: "Kinda crazy this track wasn't included in the first release of TLOP, it's the perfect closer imo and overall my favorite song from this album". ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** likes it: "I thought this is a pretty good closer for the album and I think it ties the album's themes together."

***-dolantello-*** wishes: "at this rate I hope this song ranks high". It did, I just wish a little higher.

***TheAllRightGatsby*** came around on it: "I overlook this song cuz it dropped after the album but it's really great, and Sampha sounds magnificent. This is the closest Kanye gets on this album to his older, more backpacker-type lyrical tendencies, and he really shows that he can still pull it off, and that he still has some shit to say."

Another Kanye song down. Looks like it's more even then we thought.

Song lover and Weeknd stan ***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** gives a glowing review: "Love this song. The Kanye verse is really open and shows a darker, more emotional side from Kanye. I’m a Weeknd stan, so of course I love the hook. The second verse is really good, you can hear more emotion in that verse than most verses on the album. Love the sample at the end too."

***awesometuck1559*** doesn't have a perfect opinion but enjoys it: "One of the stronger efforts on the album, I really enjoy this and the Weeknd’s vocals. If it ended about a minute before it actually does, it’d have a 10. But then we get a weird drones outdo with Kanye mumbling high-pitched phrases."

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** also loves the song: "The drums leading into the outro are perfectly placed. The Weeknd does his thing and the outro is hauntingly beautiful. I love the lyric "They don't want to see me love youuuuu". Such a spit in the face of any Kimye haters who thought their relationship wouldn't last." Fuck yeah.

***TheAllRightGatsby*** as usual is a fan: "ABEL MY MAN. Put this man on every hook, jfc. The production on this song is phenomenal. The slow build is so effective; there are places you think it's gonna explode, but instead it just keeps slowly tearing apart at the seams and wraps you up in its hazy dissonance. Album favorite."

Two of the more mixed reactions come from ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***, who says "The song has really good lyrics and The Weeknd's vocals are a nice touch to the song. But the first verse feels like a chore to listen to.", and ***MrSwearword***, who says "Cadence...sucks…but…it’s soothing."

The second of the two versions of "Blessings" on *Coloring Book*, this reprise ends the album in beautiful fashion with a chorus of vocalists including Ty Dolla Sign, Anderson Paak, BJ the Chicago Kid, and Raury.

***dirdbub*** can barely contain themselves: "GODDD DAAAAAMMMMNNNNN this song is so good. I literally cannot get over this, it’s so fucking good".

Also loving it is ***awesometuck1559***: "There’s literally no way to sing along to that opening “AAaaaaahh” without smiling. Perfect closer and that line “I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood, make you remember how to smile good” perfectly encapsulates the vibe of Chance."

***MrSwearword*** approves: "Smooth as fuck and I approve." ***ThatParanoidPenguin*** loves it: "Extremely emotional track. The outro could go on forever and I wouldn't mind it, it's really dope that everyone contributed to this choir that just claws its way to the listener, and before that, Chance dleivers a heartfelt and great verse (I used to pass out music, I still pass out music), and all-around, it's a great way to end the album."

***TwentyOneParrots*** both praises Chance and drags Drake: "Literally every single lyric in this album (and this song) is better than anything on Views. "Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold / Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing / I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood / Make you remember how to smile good"". Respect the dead, smh.

***ExtraEater*** ends their...uh... story. "epilogue: i successfully escaped new york and avoided the new york zombie apocalypse thanks to the power of the magic crayons. ty chance aka crayon jesus as stated by that priest in the church of survivors. god bless."

ExtraEater: **Great Crayon Journey Around New York - Part 13, End: Blessings (A Reprise, A Summary of Everything)**

**note: some parts are [redacted] because those songs haven't been revealed yet. stay tuned hunies. the full summary will be revealed at the end of the r8**

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's my comment for this song that i scrapped and re-wrote following the score submissions:

> 13\. Blessings (Reprise) - **10** - at last. i was at the end of the album. and it was a reprise of blessings, which was a gr8 song btw. so after this great trip around new york listening to chance's album Coloring Book, i decided i want to use this last entry to summarize the entire journey. here's basically what happened:

> * All We Got: i enter and explore new york city while listening to coloring book by chance the rapper after chance grants me crayons in a dream
* No Problem: [redacted]
* Summer Friends: i relaxed at a hotel and indulged in nostalgia
* Blessings: i called a taxi to go to a movie theater, but i fell asleep, so i had to pay the driver in one crayon. the movies all sucked
* Same Drugs: [redacted]
* Mixtape: i went to the park and danced, which caused everyone else to dance! i basically started a flash mob lol
* Angels: [redacted]
* Juke Jam: i was at a bar and some off-duty bouncers had to beat up a rough customer
* All Night: [redacted]
* How Great: i woke up in the bar to see new york was in a zombie apocalypse. i entered a churhc of survivors and there i discovered chance the rapper was crayon jesus. crayon jesus granted me and the church of survivors the magic crayons to kill all of the zombies. then i was transported to rainbow heaven and chance told me the zombies had appeared bc dead ppl illegally went back to life. it was there that crayon god (ken bennett) and i killed the devil, or drake, or aubrifer. space and time had a seizure for a moment and it turns out new york was back to normal, but i was hailed as a hero. thank u crayon jesus
* Smoke Break: i took a smoke
* Finish Line / Drown: i hate this song's title
* Blessings (Reprise): as you can see, i worked on a summary of everything that happened. this song is nice btw.

> it was really fun. thank you chance the rapper aka crayon jesus for coming into my dream and may all of you meet crayon jesus some day. i'd also like to give a **shoutout to all the people i met in the journey**:

> Chance the Rapper, The Community Choir, the Taxi Driver, the Two Robbers, the Dancers at the Park, the Drake lookalikes, The Jerky Dude at the Bar, the Bartender, Hugo, the Zombies, Phaxok, Legume, James Dean, lushacrooks, Nockers, Pandasex, Crayon Jesus (aka Chance), Ken Bennett (Crayon God), The Mayor of New York, Nockers' Wife (i was the best man at the wedding!!!)

HOW COULD YOU? This beautiful, slow ballad is one of my favorite songs of last year. Featuring an interpolation of The Beatles' "Here, There, and Everywhere", production from Jon Brion, and co-writing from Kanye West, the song is pretty much a combination of everything I love. I only wish it could have gotten a bit higher.

***TwentyOneParrots*** sums up alot of my feelings on the album in general: "I don't want to be repetitive but fuck this entire album is just so fucking beautiful and sad and mellow and tender, and the soft singing bit at the end just makes me feel so sad but it's also so beautiful and it just makes me feel like everything is ok and fucked at the same time JESUS".

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** says some truth: "THIS IS EASILY THE BEST SONG ON THE ALBUM." Yaaas, Doc. I agree with ***JoeThaMo*** too: "THIS MAKES ME CRY". Yep.

***TheAllRightGatsby*** loves it: "Album favorite, and that final verse is the best moment on the album. Every time I hear that verse I briefly consider if it might be the most gorgeous and moving thing I've ever heard. Jury's still out."

So does ***ThatParanoidPenguin***: "White Ferrari has slowly grown to be one of my favorites on the album. It's strikingly beautiful, and has some of the saddest lyrics on the album (I'm sure we're taller in another dimension), and honestly, it's got me through some tough shit. On its own, though, it deserves that 10. The instrumental is the most subtle on the album, but it creates such an atmosphere, and Frank carries the song with his gorgeous layered vocals. The pre-outro in particular is just something else. "

***estreindre*** also loves it, but what else is new because this song is perfect: "beautiful, BEAUTIFUL song, due to both frank's voice and the remarkably poetic lyrics-- especially the end of it that's probably the high point of the entire album lyrically."

The point is that I love this song. ***camerinian***, please: "I mean I feel Frank's soul on the second half of the track, but the production is just a bit crap tbh".

This was easily one of the biggest turnarounds of the rate. Chance's Kaytranada-produced house track started near the bottom, but started stacking up high scores and jumped into day 3 late in the month.

The song left ***JunkyGS*** wishing for more: "I would have paid MONAAAAAY for more of the album to sound like this." Same with ***Therokinrolla***: "The only complaint I have is that it is wayyyy to short but beside that it make my ass wiggle all night so ya".

***dirdbub*** loves it: "..I’m a huge sucker for well-produced Chicago house. well-produced house in general actually. just a sucker for it. also this song goes fucking off".

***skiddos*** is bopping "oh fuck this groove". So is ***VodkaInsipido***: "The best dance song this year. No discussion."

Detractors include ***-dolantello-***: "I really don't like this song. Chance's bars are weak as hell and the hook is obnoxious. The only redeeming part of the track is Kaytranada's beat but even then it's not that good compared to other beats of his." as well as ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***: "that fart line is just fucking stupid and I think less of Chance as a person for having said it".

***TheAllRightGatsby*** is conflicted: "If it weren't for the word "fart" this would be a perfect bop. Why would an artist ever use the word "fart" in a song ugh it's cringey af. But other than that this song is the bomb; the disco/house type production is awesome, and "Start dancin ho" gets me hype af."

***camerinian*** offers a mostly-accurate prediction: "Dude this is so much up r/popheads alley it’s not even funny, this shit’s gonna clean up and there is no issue with that whatsoever". Not quite.

ExtraEater: **New York Journey - Part 9: A🌈l🍺l🐲N🖍i🍆g💦h🎉t🐼**

tl;dr backstory: i went around new york listening to chance the rapper's album and shit. here's my comment for this song:

> 9\. All Night - **10** - i was at a bar in the late night as i listened to this song. and holy shit was it wilder than ever. i think when it got to the chorus of this song like a bunch of people tried to kill each other lol. the bouncer (nice guy, his name was hugo) really had to bounce that time. he had to turn into a giant dinosaur and grab people and throw them out of the bar. it was so cool. he might've done that or maybe i was drunk lol. all i know is this song is a fuckin bop and i lost one of my crayons to a drake lookalike ughh. crayons left: 🖍🖍

The first part of Kanye's two part song but the second part to leave the rate, this was actually in the top 10 for a little bit but slipped out late in December.

***enecks*** praises it: "The first 1:06 of this song is an actual masterpiece; maybe the best stretch of music of the album. The bleached asshole lyrics are corny, but I am more upset that it interrupts the phenomenal piano. Still an ICONIC and stunning song."

But really, I just have to go over the comments that mention a certain bleached asshole:

"ah, the iconic bleached asshole line. but on a serious note, this song is awesome. Kanye’s use of the vocoder on this song is actually amazing, and flows really well with the song" - ***dirdbub***

"Bleach…just…bleach…" - ***MrSwearword***

"Not sure if bleached assholes should increase or decrease this score..." - ***nskn13***

"Bleached assholes." - ***JunkyGS***

"The first 1:06 of this song is an actual masterpiece; maybe the best stretch of music of the album. The bleached asshole lyrics are corny, but I am more upset that it interrupts the phenomenal piano. Still an ICONIC and stunning song." - ***enecks***

"this song loses so much points for "IMMA FEEL LIKE AN ASSHOLE"" - ***estreindre***

"now if i fuck this t-shirt, and she just bleached her t-shirt, and i get bleach on my t-shirt, imma feel like a t-shirt" - ***raicicle***

"I am taking 1 point off just for the bleached asshole line." - ***JoshuaReddit***

"The bleach lyric is so ridiculous but it still pretty much works which is amazing" - ***TwentyOneParrots***

"The asshole line gets clowned on, but it's probably the best part of a fairly forgettable song." - ***YankeeHankyPanky***

""Now if I fuck this model / And she just bleached her asshole / And I get bleach on my T-shirt / I'ma feel like an asshole" is surprisingly a very clever line despite how meme-y it is tbh." - ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***

Welp, my favorite two songs from Chance are out (RIP Summer Friends). This stunning ballad features of my favorite production and songwriting from any Chance project. Wish it stuck around longer.

***Therokinrolla*** goes into detail on their love for the song: "Reminiscing songs really have a soft spot in my heart because time literally scares me. Sometimes in this song I can’t tell whether he wishes he did the “same drugs” or if he’s glad he doesn’t do those “same drugs” and it’s really thought provoking. And the instrumental is quite frankly gorgeous."

Another emotional comment comes from ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***: "This is a contender for my 11. This song talks about my fear of losing friendships due to lost interest perfectly. I love how Chance used Peter Pan and Wendy as a metaphor for a lost friendship that was once meaningful. Thank you Chance for making this song so much."

***TwentyOneParrots*** can relate: "Realising you're no longer on the same page as someone you used to care about and that things will never be the way they used to be is one of the saddest feelings, and Chance just gets that feeling down perfect here."

***camerinian*** also loves it: "This is just really cute, I love Chance’s improvised bits at the start and the song overall has a beautiful vibe, it captures the feeling of nostalgia perfectly".

Yep, ***TheAllRightGatsby*** does too: "Nostalgic and heartbreaking, a perfect song about growing up. The little piano interlude and outro are so beautiful. Also shoutout to Eryn Allen Kane, she only has a few lines but she's exactly what the song needs, she kills it."

Just about the only one who doesn't love it is ***MrSwearword***, who says "The chorus got on my nerves."

ExtraEater: **Great Crayon Journey Around New York - Part 5: We're Not So Different After All. It's Not Us Vs. Them. We All Do the Same Drugs**

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's my comment for this song:

> 5\. Same Drugs - **10** - my phone started to play same drugs and i started to cry bc it was so sad and nice. it describes such a beautiful relationship. i had to get into a building to avoid getting mugged bc i'm a crying wimp, so i went into the bank. but oh no! there was a bank robbery! i used my powers granted to me by this wonderful song to convince the robbers, who looked like drug dealers, to stop robbing the bank, and they were cool and left. god bless. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

This song has a long history before the album even came out, especially with Kanye fans. First premiered during the original [Yeezy Season](https://youtu.be/TEYaLzRDyIA?t=502), the song was hyped and originally intended as the album's [opener](http://cdn2.thelineofbestfit.com/images/made/images/remote/https_cdn2.thelineofbestfit.com/media/2014/kanye_wolves_1200_633.png). Kanye would perform the song on Saturday Night Live a little while [later](https://vimeo.com/120166005). As the months went by, a studio version of "Wolves" seemed less and less likely, but when Kanye announced the album's tracklist, "Wolves" had been moved to the end. When the song played at Yeezy Season 3, however, Vic Mensa and Sia's parts had been entirely removed, replaced with a new Kanye verse and an outro from Frank Ocean. In the aftermath of some backlash from the new version, Kanye made his famous "ima fix wolves" [tweet](https://twitter.com/kanyewest/status/698971890581401600?lang=en) and returned Vic and Sia to the song, moving Frank to the separate interlude "Frank's Track".

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** prefers the original version: "Could have been the literal best song of all time if the final version was the same as the Yeezy Season 0 version and if Kanye's verse wasn't one of his worst ever. At the same time, his closing lines are great and almost make up for it. Vic Mensa and Sia are both phenomenal on this song, though."

So does ***Awhile2***: "Had this been the OG version from Yeezy Season, itd be gettin my 11. I actually like Ye’s verse on it but the transitions between the different parts of the song just arent nearly as smooth as they were in the original."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** loves it still: "The intro to this song is 100% perfect. It's like an operatic chainsaw, minimalist beauty with a sharp edge. And the features are fantastic. I know Ye's lines are a little corny but who cares, this song is amazing."

***eklxtreme*** agrees: "production is intense but also beautiful, very personal lyrics, Vic's verse melts my heart, the ending especially kills me".

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** likes it but finds some fault: "Almost a 10 again. Honestly forgetting how good TLOP was. The final version, with Vic and Sia, is just so good. I wasn't a super big fan of the original when it dropped, because it didn't really lead to anywhere, however I don't know if the conclusion we were given was satisfactory. The verse is half trash (the worst parts of Yeezus' repeating lines x10), but the other half is one of the most touching and philosophical moments on the album, comparing North to Jesus, and his detractors to wolves, it seems obvious but it's brilliant. Too bad you get to the ridiculous other part of the verse first. And also the drums are mixed really weird."

***MrSwearword*** doesn't realize the song came out before the ad campaign: "The Balmain theme song…BYE FELICIA".

This is another song on TLOP with an interesting backstory. Legendary hip hop rroducer Madlib sent Kanye the beat for the song in 2010 during the sessions for *My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy*, but the beat and the song concept went un-used for 6 years before turning up on this album, now with an added feature by Kendrick Lamar. The collab is the first time Kanye and Kendrick have officially collabed on a song and it didn't disappoint.

***eklxtreme*** loves it: "incredible sampling, incredible beat, incredible verse from Kendrick, one of the best Kanye verses of all time, get me so hype". So does ***dirdbub***: "bruh. holy fuck. Kanye and Kendrick fucking KILLED this. that cheer sample at the end always gets me as well".

***LuigiEatsPopcorn*** is another fan: "Insane verses by both Kendrick and Kanye. I know everyone loves Kanye’s verse more than Kendrick’s but I like Kendrick’s more. Also the production/sample on this one is my favorite on the album."

***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah*** is the biggest fan: "My favorite song of the year. It just makes me so happy to listen to it. The sample was perfectly chopped. Kendrick's verse is funny, and one of his better features. Kanye brings bar after bar after bar, rapping meaningful, incredibly self-aware, and often very funny lyrics."

***YankeeHankyPanky*** speaks some real truth: "Kanye and Kendrick is music perfection."

***ExtraEater*** once again is confusing: "i always think of this song when i've thrown a party but i also realize i haven't thrown a party(?????) bc i'm in LA and ye say no more parties in LA and i follow him because ye is the second coming of yezzus". Same??

One of the least controversial and most universally liked songs of the whole rate, the first single for *Coloring Book* leaves Chance down to one. Featuring a hook from up and coming Chicago rapper Saba, this track becomes the first down of the top 10.

Chance fan ***awesometuck1559*** loves this one too: "Anytime this comes on I rap every line bar for bar. One of my favorites, if not my favorite track from Coloring Book. Blast this in the car and if anyone does not start bumping to it, throw them the fuck out."

Another positive comment comes from ***TheAllRightGatsby***: "This song is a JAM. Sounds like a rodeo, got me dancin the do-si-do. Those steel drums + horns in the hook is the bomb. And I really love how he doesn't ignore Chicago's flaws but he reps Chi-town loud and proud anyway."

Both ***ThatParanoidPenguin*** ("Really enjoyed this song when I first heard it, and I still do. There's a lot of style on it, and Saba delivers the best chorus on the album, god is it good. And steel drums! One of the standouts, for sure.") and ***eklxtreme*** ("it's such a feel-good song and everything about it is amazing, I especially like the steel-drums/marimbas in the chorus") take specific note of the steel drum production.

***camerinian*** isn't as big a fan: "This is just like Summer Friends but with a worse hook and better production, so I guess they're basically even".

***dirdbub*** shares many of our reactions: "yo holy fuck man".

ExtraEater: **Great Crayon Journey Around New York - Part 7: Angels We Have Heard While High**

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's my comment for this song:

> 7\. Angels - **10** - i listened to this song as i checked into a hotel to rest on my third day in the city. this song was so happy. i danced to it all night long until midnight when my neighbors told me to shut up. i looked at them and saw they were just a bunch of guys who look like drake??? i might've just been sleepy tho. i know this is a simple entry but damn it felt so good dancing to this song! i checked my crayon inventory and then I went to sleep. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

WHYYY. I'll be honest, I'm just happy that Famous made the top 10. Or that it has a higher average then any Taylor Swift song. The song was formerly titled "Nina Chop", and at different times had guest vocals from Young Thug and Chance the Rapper. The song became notable for its lines about Taylor (which she was later shown to be lying about not giving approval for 👀) and for being a great song. It was recently nominated for 2 Grammy Awards.

***booooam*** enjoys it: "Rihanna, Nina Simone and Sister Nancy all in one song? On top of that the start of one of the most entertaining celebrity feuds of the past year?: this song is great on its own as well as great for its pop cultural influence, also the sample of Bam Bam sounds like it was solely made for this song."

So does ***enecks***: "Man I can understand why people hate this song. I don’t give a shit tho, it sounds incredible. The lyrics are provocative and edgy but have just enough self-awareness that it works. Rihanna is also incredible in it."

I agree with ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***: "Already iconic. The sample at the end might be the best minute on the entire album." ***VodkaInsipido*** also notes a great moment: "The 'bam, bam' sample it's amazing. One of those wow moments, like Hell of a Life."

**Taylor Comments:**

"Kanye throwing this away at the end is unacceptable. To be fair, he did make Taylor famous." - ***MrSwearword***

"i always think of this song when i'm reading the new new testament that is the life of pablo. it reminds me of the story of adam and eve and how humanity was cursed with sin because of a single snake. it's so sad pls god help ye. (alt. comment: 🐍)" - ***ExtraEater***

"The birth of snek and an awesome song. I also think Rihanna’s verses are really nice and that OUTRO I still don’t know if its depressing or happy and idgaf" - ***Therokinrolla***

"Drag Hitlor SSwift" - ***JoeThaMo***

"Is there really a more iconic lyric than "I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that bitch famous (God damn)" God. Damn." - ***TwentyOneParrots***

"Not gonna lie, pre-snek times, I would have given this song a 7. But after Taylor was exposed as a snek, I can safely give this song a 9." - ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***

"Where is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me ‘that bitch' in his song? It doesn't exist because it never happened. You don't get to control someone's emotional response to being called ‘that bitch' in front of the entire world. Of course I wanted to like the song. I wanted to believe Kanye when he told me that I would love the song. I wanted us to have a friendly relationship. He promised to play the song for me, but he never did. While I wanted to be supportive of Kanye on the phone call, you cannot ‘approve' a song you haven't heard. Being falsely printed as a liar when I was never given the full story or played any part of the song is character assassination. I would very much like to be excluded from this narrative, one that I have never asked to be a part of, since 2009" - ***bluehxrizon***

With the highest number of 11s so far, this song is out surprisingly early. But this rate has never been predictable (outside of Drake getting 1989d), has it?

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** gives their best comment yet: "Oh look, it's the song of the year. This is Frank's magnum opus, in my opinion. Yes, Pyramids is flawless. But, this is the single most calculated song on any mainstream release this year. I don't even know what to say, there are lines on here that are deceptively simple, yet extremely relatable. The delivery on this song is some of the best on the album, and some of the best he's ever done. "No bitch in my body, AH", "Shut the fuck up I don't want your conversation". And the beat switch that marks the halfway point of the entire album? Beat switch of the year, easily. The instrumental as a whole is just ridiculous, with so much going on, and everything working perfectly in unison. Haven't heard a song this year with as much volume, as much crispness. It has incredible atmosphere. And naturally, Frank just kills the whole song. Perfection."

***ExtraEater*** is also loving it: "I really love city life songs like Midnight City or Hong Kong by Gorillaz, and I'll say that this song describes the average adult worker's life in a city perfectly and with such perfect production/aesthetic, so Nights gets my 11. Also, I just adore the switch in this song."

So does ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***: "This is the best song on the album. Incredible production, incredible vocals, incredible lyrics. THE SWITCH. When the song switches, it’s insane. Plus just how the chorus feels after the switch, just the sound and how it feels."

So does ***VodkaInsipido***: "SONG OF THE YEAR, PERIOD. Frank did it again with the switch. The one that will stand the test of time."

Yeah, a lot of people love this song. Some people don't, though. ***estreindre*** is a little less in love: "okay i know everybody loves this song but... tbh i don't get why. i mean it's good obvs, but i wouldn't even have it in the top 5 songs from blonde. still great though."

***MrSwearword*** wins no favors with Frank fans: "Ugh, why does he waste beats on half assed work?"

This beautiful song from Frank picked up 3 11s, but couldn't make it to the top 5. Backing vocals on the song were performed by Austin Feinstein of the Los Angeles indie band Slow Hollows, who are highkey [underrated](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nzom9SCig1I).

***estreindre*** is deep with their love of the song: "one of my favorite songs of all time. i know this isn't gonna do as well as it deserves on the rate thread, but there's so many things about self control that make it incredible, from the great guitar riff in the background to how beautiful frank's voice sounds to how beautiful the lyrics are. "keep a place for me / i'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing" is just such a pathetic lyric that it's hard for me to not feel sad about it, and the way frank sings "i'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight" makes it sound way more beautiful than it has any right to. the way the song slowly fades out with frank accepting that he has to leave but being so reluctant about it is just the bow on the present for me."

***Therokinrolla*** hears perfection: "Its heavy. It really is. I appreciate most tracks on this album, but I still don’t like them. I GET this track. Hits highs at the right moments, stay low at the right moments, and never overstays its welcome. Perfect."

***TheAllRightGatsby*** is also a big fan: "The hook to this song is absolutely perfect and gives me chills, and this song's outro is the second best moment on this whole album, it's perfect. And of course this goes without saying but Frank sings his ass off." So is ***eklxtreme***: "the instrumentation is beautiful, the melodies at the end are incredible".

It's the song of the year in particular for ***TwentyOneParrots***: "This is my song of the year because it's just beautiful af and makes me cry everytime I hear it".

More ambivalent reactions belong to both ***YankeeHankyPanky*** ("It's OK? I literally am reading the genius lyrics and I don't remember this at all. I know I listened to it twice today, but it's insanely forgettable.") and ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***, who says "The song is a bit boring for me. But the outro makes this song much better."

The road has ended for Chance, unfortunately. While his path to the end started to look fairly promising, he became the second artist to fall. This single features guest verses from the members of ColleGrove, 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne. Both artists would later perform at Chance's Magnificent Coloring Day festival.

One of the song's biggest fans is ***-dolantello-***: "Chaotic, off the wall energy in the form of great music. Chance, Tunechi and 2 Chainz all pull through with memorable bars. One of the best songs of the year".

***Therokinrolla*** appreciates the message: "Best fuck you to music record companies since ever".

***camerinian*** isn't the biggest fan, but agrees with the message: "So glad this is the track that’s broken Chano into the mainstream, because there isn’t a better statement of what he’s all about. Staunchly independent, yet playful and massively fun. Could’ve gone without 2 Chainz tho".

Everyone hates them record labels, I guess. That includes ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***: "An interesting song in which is Chance's 'Fuck you' to record labels. Lil Wayne's verse is a bit too long but otherwise his verse is okay."

The quotables attracted ***Awhile2***: "“School of Hard Knocks, I took night classes” is one of my favorite lines this year".

Lil Wayne's appearance drew some mixed reactions. ***MrSwearword*** isn't interested: "This is rather pleasing…apart from Weezy." However, it surprised ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***: "solid song, got a great feature out of Lil Wayne, catchy". ***awesometuck1559*** is mixed: "Probably the most hype track on the album. 2 Chainz and Wayne bring solid verses, though Wayne seems a bit too chill."

ExtraEater: **Great Crayon Journey Around New York - Part 2: What's the Kids' Problem?**

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's my comment for this song:

> 2\. No Problem - **9** - just as i listened to this song, i somehow happened to be at a concert with a community choir. but this song just moved me, so i ran up on stage and i sang my heart out and all of the children in the choir got mad. turns out i was a good singer, but the audience was mad i interrupted them. i had to run away but i lost a crayon! crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍🖍

yaaas we're done already. i'll compile all the parts together and combine them for easy reading at the end of this.

Another smooth ballad from Frank and one that was co-written and co-produced by James Blake.

I love this comment from ***Therokinrolla***: "I love the whole “Solo” and “So low” double meaning what a clever dude. And yes I use Genius to learn these things stfu".

Another comment praising the song''s secret meanings comes from ***camerinian***: "This was one of the few moments where I felt Blonde measured up to the magic I heard on Channel Orange. The “bull and the matador duelling in the sky” might be the best imagery in this whole rate".

***estreindre*** is also enamored by Frank: "this song is probably the closest the album gets to feeling like poetry for me. it's full of incredible lines, such as "we don't gotta be solo (so low)," "inhale, inhale (in hell) there's heaven", and "no trees to blow through / but blow me and i'll owe you.""

***eklxtreme*** praises it: "such a beautiful melody, I love Frank's higher register and his falsetto, those keys keep you in a melancholy trance".

***ThatParanoidPenguin*** loves it too: "Fuck, I just gotta throw another 10 down here. The instrumental is just so haunting, with those high pitched screeches just being one of the most amazing noises on the entire album. The little stutters when Frank says "solo", the timeless chorus, the impeccable second verse. Perfection."

A little more apprehension comes from ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***: "I am not fan of those noises (they sounded like police sirens) but other than that, the song is good."

Look_A_Fangirl: Damn, glad this song made top 5 tho. Incoming wall of text, read if want.

Look, I really wanted this song to be #1 because it's really personal to me. I was in a really bad state mentally when this song came out and this song was just there for me. My mental state kept having it's ups and downs because of what was going on in my life at that point in time and I would always turn to music to help me and this was one of the songs. I resonated with the whole wanting to be solo theme part in it. I just wanted to be alone and with the events going on in my life it was just like impossible. There were many nights where I sat and cried to this song. It just felt like it was a good friend, like someone that was there for you and just wanted to comfort you. So yeah, this song just is really personal to me.

=====

TheAllRightGatsby: I think if there's anything these rates and talking about music on /r/popheads in general has taught me, it's that even the 60th song in a rate of 60 songs can be someone's favorite and be really personally important to them. On the one hand it's kind of sad that someone can hate something that you love, but on the other hand it's kind of really beautiful that everyone can find the thing that speaks to them and fills their heart up, even if it's not the song that speaks to everyone. I kinda love that, and it's a really good reminder whenever the songs I love most are axed that there's a great silver lining.

Twist! One of the favorites to win goes out at #4, leaving Frank with only a single song left on the board.

***-dolantello-*** very simply states: "this song is perfect".

***booooam*** is highkey stunned: ""I thought that I was dreaming when you said you’d love me“ Such a simple but powerful line that’s the perfect introduction to the song".

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** makes a connection to another successful rate song: "This song reminds me of Lorde's "400 Lux" and I like it. I thought it's clever how Frank sounded altered in an attempt to sound young as he emulates the emotions of young love."

The interlude is particularly praised by ***ExtraEater***: "Ugh that instrumentation is too beautiful. Reminds me of indie-style dream pop."

**A bunch more comments praising the song:**

"absolutely beautiful song about ex-lovers. "i thought that i was a dream when you said you loved me / the start of nothing" is one of my all time favorite lyrics and never fails to make me nostalgic." - ***estreindre***

"The reminiscent atmosphere is lovely and his voice holds so much emotion and it’s a sweet song." - ***Therokinrolla***

"Frank’s voice is incredible on this one. Plus the guitar/bass production is so simple yet so catchy." - ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***

"This one is honestly just painfully beautiful, I will probably still listen to it when I'm old and cranky" - ***JoeThaMo*** Same I guess

"I can’t describe why this song is so emotional to me, but it just hits all the right notes for me" - ***dirdbub***

Just when it looked like Frank had it in the bag, his 4 songs went out between #8 and #3, dropping him from contention and leaving only Kanye left. This song, produced by Pharrell Williams and featuring background vocals by the one and only Beyonce, I'm not surprised that that it ended up being the last Frank song.

***TheAllRightGatsby*** praises the song, "The production on this song is perfect. That one major chord in the progression is weird no matter how many times I listen to this song, but that's kind of what makes it just as good every time I come back. And the end of this song just takes me to another world, I could listen to that forever.

Building on that is ***ThatParanoidPenguin***: "Where do I start? Chorus is heavenly. Bey is on the track briefly, but honestly, it's the perfect cameo and she doesn't overshadow the track at all."

I'm sorry ***Mudkip1*** but I don't rly get this: "beyonce cured the common cold with these vocals"

***camerinian*** was impressed: "I’ll be real, most of Blonde kinda bored me, purely because of the lack of variety in the instrumentals, so the jauntier piano and jazzier vibe really works wonders here".

Even ***MrSwearword*** loves it: "Best song from this uneven as fuck album."

Both ***bluehxrizon*** ("i thought was Wii sports resort music at first") and ***ExtraEater*** ("Vaguely reminds me of Plants Vs. Zombies music. Idk why") actually made random connections to unrelated video games.

***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*** is another fan: "This is probably one of the most radio-friendly tracks on this album here. I can feel Pharell's fingerprints on the production. Also, slay me Beyonce with dem background vocals."

***Awhile2*** makes a note: "this song is proof that Blonde wouldve been a much better album if most of the songs had drums".

"Or is it BLOND or should it have stayed BOYS, DON’T CRY b/c BLOND(E) is a stupid album name?" - ***MrSwearword***

"my second favorite AOTY (behind lemonade), i love how simple and stripped down it is, i love the stream-of-consciousness of it and most of all i love how different it is from the other masterpiece that is channel orange. sadly most people forgot about it and even i don't play it that much, but coming back to it is a very good experience (unlike TLOP). listening to it always brings back amazing memories :)" - ***mokitsu***

I know a lot of people are probably disappointed in an ending with Frank and Chance locked out of the top two, and I can't say I don't wish it had been a little closer in the end. But you know what they say, it's about the journey, not the destination. While Frank actually had a higher average score then Kanye did, and he did only lose a single song on the first day, he ends up being the third artist eliminated.

[/r/popheads/comments/5o6z40/the_life_of_pablo_vs_views_vs_blonde_vs_coloring/dchabia/]

=====

MrSwearword: This has to do with finding out the magazine was a thing and the fact the album name was changed to Blond/e. The magazine and album should've switched names as *I* and really only *I* felt that Blond works better as a magazine name as Frank could explore things relating to beauty standards, racism in the gay community, fluid sexuality, etc. Boys, Don't Cry works better as an album name because it plays into the fact that he's introspective and sensitive even though "society"/whatever normative thing he's fighting against says he shouldn't be.

Too long, don't care? I liked *Boys, Don't Cry* as an album name better than *Blonde* as I have no idea what it means as an album name.
[/r/popheads/comments/5o6z40/the_life_of_pablo_vs_views_vs_blonde_vs_coloring/dchaitt/]

=====

ThatParanoidPenguin: Blond(e)'a meaning is derived from the difference of the official title and the album cover, with Blond referring to the male version of the hair color and Blonde referring to the female version of the hair color. It's part of the dissonance in the album and themes about bisexuality.

Ngl tho, I like the title Blonde a lot but Boys Don't Cry might be a slightly better album name.

The winner, everyone! After 60 songs, 4 albums, and 19 eliminated Drake songs, Kanye's gospel epic "Ultralight Beam" walks away handily with the win. Getting scores of 10 or higher from over half the submitters, this song never fell lower then second place over the course of the month and pulled pretty far away from "Real Friends" near Christmas. This is a beautiful, incredible song, but why should I tell you how great it is when the sub can?

"incredible opener. Love the gospel touches and the featured vocalists. This has been said so many times but Chance's verse really is one of the best of the year" - ***-dolantello-***

"The strongest start in an album Ye ever had. Not Dark Fantasy, not We Don't Care, not Good Life. Period." - ***VodkaInsipido***

"Oh, hey, it's the only above average thing Chance has ever done in his entire career. Seriously though, I may not like him but his verse here is nothing short of fantastic." - ***FuckUpSomeCommasYeah***

"This song is nearly perfect, when I was at MSG and Chance came on through the speakers people legit started crying (ok just me but still) and the verses are super strong. The drums are a little off in parts but the wide variety of layered vocals and new interesting sonic direction makes this not only one of the highlights of the album, but the year. That outro too lit." - ***ThatParanoidPenguin***

"i always think of this song when some redditor says kanye is suck and i have to explain that kanye is actually duck" - ***ExtraEater***

"Everything about it is so beautiful and can make the staunchest atheist feel some religious butterflies." - ***JunkyGS***

"When people say a song is a religious experience, they usually use that as shorthand for it being a big deal. This song is actually a religious experience; calm, restrained, yet powerful." - ***enecks***

"everything about this song is wonderful" - ***Mudkip1***

"incredible. production on this is super tight and it's a really beautiful song imo." - ***estreindre***

"Kanye taught me religion under the Church of Yeezus :hands:" - ***Therokinrolla***

"The most inspiring song on Pablo. Great singing from Kanye, amazing verse from Chance, The-Dream and Kelly Price did great too. Stunning simplistic production and great drums to boot. The “FAAAAAAAAAIITH, MOOOOOOORE, SAAAAAAAAFE, WAAAAAAAR” always gives me goosebumps, everytime I hear it." - ***LuigiEatsPopcorn***

"Kanye is certainly the most iconic out of all 4 of these artists" - ***skiddos***

"I’d say probably Kanye’s strongest album opener in his entire discography. Kanye’s spacey, cavernous production completely flips the warm gospel influences." - ***raicicle***

"Wow what a way to start an album, absolutely love every second of this gospel infused masterpiece, also Kelly’s voice is perfect here." - ***booooam***

"Do I even really need to explain this? This is a beautiful song with Chance’s best guest verse and amazing vocals by the choir and Kelly Price. Best song off TLOP and def best song of the rate." - ***awesometuck1559***

"Y'all already know this song is fantastic, and Chance puts down the best verse on the album by far." - ***TheAllRightGatsby***

"Not just the best song from this rate, this is my favorite song of 2016 and it isn't close. It's a complete musical experience and a work of art." - ***YankeeHankyPanky***

"holy shit, this song. what an opener. the first time I heard this, I was at a lost for words. Chance’s verse on this song is just so fucking emotional, I can’t get over it. what a great way to start this album" - ***dirdbub***

"Watch this one track shit over the rest of Chance’s album lol." - ***camerinian***

Enough said, tbh. Thanks for coming out.

Well, it was a hard fought battle throughout the month, with #1 changing hands several times (although both sets of hands were technically Kanye's), but in the end "Real Friends" settles for #2. The second song Kanye released in the buildup for TLOP, "Real Friends" helped regain the trust of fans after the mixed reaction to "Facts". A heartbreaking song of Kanye's increasingly distant relationships with his close friends due to his fame and busy schedule, it's a real human moment on the album.

A few people wrote fairly long and deep comments for this, it would probably be best to spotlight them first.

"I did not expect this song to hit me this hard. The topic of this song hits home for me because the topic of "who are your real friends? Who are your fake friends?" makes me wanna tear up." - ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***

"This is when the album really connected with me and I felt what Kanye was trying to get across. This is one of the best songs of the year, if not of the decade. The production is yet again spot on and perfectly captures the drab atmosphere this song has. It got me thinking about whether or not the people I know are real friends to me or if I’m a real friend to them. Songs rarely get me thinking about my life outside of listening to it. This songs really great, guys. Please be sweet to it." - ***Therokinrolla***

"Fuck, man. This single was some real shit. I liked the original version of 30 Hours more (but the unnecessarily long and teasing outro just kinda ruins the momentum, especially when the original just fades out with that beautiful outro). The piano is the most perfect marriage of old Kanye and new Kanye, and it's such an honest and painfully personal view into his life and what it is to be rich, it would be really nice to hear in-depth songs about stuff like this. Lyrics are just insane. Beat is insane. Ty Dolla $ign is insane." - ***ThatParanoidPenguin***

In addition, ***awesometuck1559*** connects: "A fantastic track that deals with some real themes in Kanye’s life. You can feel the frustration in his voice and it makes the track that much better."

***Awhile2*** was reminded of the power of Yeezus: "This song and the OG Wolves set my expectations way too high for this album but it makes me glad that over 10 years into his career, Ye is still making some of the best songs in his discography".

***eklxtreme praises it: ***"reminds me of a cold winter of heartbreak, Ty Dolla Sign kills this feature, the production is perfection".

***enecks*** goes simple: "Ok deadass this song makes me sad". Same...

"TLOP is an album that i had in heavy rotation for at least two months after its release, so it kinda burned out quick. i don't enjoy it as much, i think it is a very uneven album, and i dont know if i'll listen to it again in full." - ***mokitsu***

"This was a really interesting album to listen through. I really like the production in this album but I feel like it's kind of incohesive in some parts. I'll just say I am glad I listened to this album for the rate." - ***DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy***

TLOP is an interesting album. It feels more like the Kanye that made it then most other Kanye albums. It jumps all over the place thematically and sonically, bragging one second and showing obvious insecurities the next. It's the soundtrack to a man knocking on the door of 40 years old, who's spent years as one of the most hated men in America. It's not Kanye's best work, and a few songs went out on day 1 of the rate, but it hung around and took the crown. Congrats, Kanye.

ExtraEater: oh yeah! i forgot to post this:

#the entire new york crayon story, unabridged and finished:

last disclaimer: i was drunk or high or something af when making my comments for chance

tl;dr backstory: chance the rapper gave me crayons in a dream and so i went around new york listening to his album and shit. here's the entire story, unabridged:

> **Average - 9.231**

> Part 1\. All We Got - **10** - i loved this song. it was the first song i listened to (duh) as i explored the city. damn it felt like there were big signs saying "Welcome to New York! It's been waiting for you!" at the time, i thought those could've been lyrics for a song, but then i realized that would be way too cheesy. at least no artist *actually* uses those lyrics. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍🖍🖍

> Part 2\. No Problem - **9** - just as i listened to this song, i somehow happened to be at a concert with a community choir. but this song just moved me, so i ran up on stage and i sang my heart out and all of the children in the choir got mad. turns out i was a good singer, but the audience was mad i interrupted them. i had to run away but i lost a crayon! crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍🖍

> Part 3\. Summer Friends - **9** - i stopped by a nice resort hotel as i listened to this song. the song is soooo relaxing and it reminded me of summertime as a kid. the crayons i had i kept safe in my bag. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍🖍

> Part 4\. Blessings - **10** - i listened to blessings. it was pretty relaxing just like summer friends. but i also wanted to go to a movie, so i called a taxi. but then i fell asleep(!!!) in the taxi on the way to see a movie so the taxi driver kicked me out and forced me to pay in one crayon. oh no! also i never got to see that movie because it turns out literally every movie they had scheduled really sucked. well at least the album was good so far. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

> Part 5\. Same Drugs - **10** - my phone started to play same drugs and i started to cry bc it was so sad and nice. it describes such a beautiful relationship. i had to get into a building to avoid getting mugged bc i'm a crying wimp, so i went into the bank. but oh no! there was a bank robbery! i used my powers granted to me by this wonderful song to convince the robbers, who looked like drug dealers, to stop robbing the bank, and they were cool and left. god bless. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

> Part 6\. Mixtape - **9** - as soon as i heard the sick beat come on in mixtape, i had to go to the park and dance. but somehow i started a flash mob of dancing to mixtape by chance the rapper! it was so exciting! i converted a bunch of white people into chance in the process. i mean they thought it was the same guy who made cupid shuffle but it still counts right? anyway my crayons were safe god bless. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

> Part 7\. Angels - **10** - i listened to this song as i checked into a hotel to rest on my third day in the city. this song was so happy. i danced to it all night long until midnight when my neighbors told me to shut up. i looked at them and saw they were just a bunch of guys who look like drake??? i might've just been sleepy tho. i know this is a simple entry but damn it felt so good dancing to this song! i checked my crayon inventory and then I went to sleep. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

> Part 8\. Juke Jam - **9** - i was listening to this song at a bar in the afternoon. it was such a laidback time. but i heard the bar gets real weird at night. is it true though? i looked at my phone. the next song in the album was All Night. perhaps it was going to be. anyway, when justin started singing in the song some jerky dude started to beat up the bartender and it took an off-duty bouncers to off him. the bouncer was really nice, his name was hugo. it turns out that guy was a regular that they knew was troublesome but was so easy to beat up. if you ask me i think the power of justin bieber compelled him👀. my crayons miraculously remained safe throughout all of this. crayons left: 🖍🖍🖍

> Part 9\. All Night - **10** - i was at a bar in the late night as i listened to this song. and holy shit was it wilder than ever. i think when it got to the chorus of this song like a bunch of people tried to kill each other lol. the bouncer (nice guy, his name was hugo) really had to bounce that time. he had to turn into a giant dinosaur and grab people and throw them out of the bar. it was so cool. he might've done that or maybe i was drunk lol. all i know is this song is a fuckin bop and i lost one of my crayons to a drake lookalike ughh. crayons left: 🖍🖍

> Part 10\. How Great - **10** - *[my reveal for this part is so long so i'm just going to link it](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5o0ach/rate_reveal_the_life_of_pablo_vs_views_vs_blonde/dcfns3g/)*

> Part 11\. Smoke Break - **7** - *turns on ipod shuffle gen 1* *puts cigarette in mouth* whatever. *smoke*

> Part 12\. Finish Line / Drown - **7** - i hate the song title

> Part 13\. Blessings (Reprise) - **10** - at last. i was at the end of the album. and it was a reprise of blessings, which was a gr8 song btw. so after this great trip around new york listening to chance's album Coloring Book, i decided i want to use this last entry to summarize the entire journey. here's basically what happened:

> #SUMMARIES

> * All We Got: i enter and explore new york city while listening to coloring book by chance the rapper after chance grants me crayons in a dream
* No Problem: i invaded and sang at a community choir performance and everyone got mad. i lost one crayon
* Summer Friends: i relaxed at a hotel and indulged in nostalgia
* Blessings: i called a taxi to go to a movie theater, but i fell asleep, so i had to pay the driver in one crayon. the movies all sucked
* Same Drugs: a bank was getting robbed, but i persuaded the robbers to stop robbing it
* Mixtape: i went to the park and danced, which caused everyone else to dance! i basically started a flash mob lol
* Angels: i checked into a hotel and just chilled in my bedroom as a bunch of people that looked like drake got mad at me.
* Juke Jam: i was at a bar and some off-duty bouncers had to beat up a rough customer
* All Night: i was at the bar at night and the party was SO WILD. i sadly lost a crayon.
* How Great: i woke up in the bar to see new york was in a zombie apocalypse. i entered a churhc of survivors and there i discovered chance the rapper was crayon jesus. crayon jesus granted me and the church of survivors the magic crayons to kill all of the zombies. then i was transported to rainbow heaven and chance told me the zombies had appeared bc dead ppl illegally went back to life. it was there that crayon god (ken bennett) and i killed the devil, or drake, or aubrifer. space and time had a seizure for a moment and it turns out new york was back to normal, but i was hailed as a hero. thank u crayon jesus
* Smoke Break: i took a smoke
* Finish Line / Drown: i hate this song's title
* Blessings (Reprise): as you can see, i worked on a summary of everything that happened. this song is nice btw.

> it was really fun. thank you chance the rapper aka crayon jesus for coming into my dream and may all of you meet crayon jesus some day. i'd also like to give a **shoutout to all the people i met in the journey**:

> Chance the Rapper, The Community Choir, the Taxi Driver, the Two Robbers, the Dancers at the Park, the Drake lookalikes, The Jerky Dude at the Bar, the Bartender, Hugo, the Zombies, Phaxok, Legume, James Dean, lushacrooks, Nockers, Pandasex, Crayon Jesus (aka Chance), Ken Bennett (Crayon God), The Mayor of New York, Nockers' Wife (i was the best man at the wedding!!!)

> and finally, don't let people tell you you can't still own an ipod shuffle gen 1 like the ppl in the zombie apocalypse

> #gen1best1

> #BuyColoringBookOniTunes

ExtraEater: **BONUS: My real, unabridged intro for this album that I submitted to punk**

**[LEAK]**

> as i was listening to this album, i was on a journey. chance the rapper came to me in a dream and gave me a bunch of crayons and i was determined not to lose them. i traveled around the city listening to his album. here is my crayon journey around the city documented. i am not putting them in sequence. really, each song just has a different city story attached to it. this is just in case you want to use these comments for some reason (this may or may have not actually happened minus the crayon part, most likely the latter)

> so, if ever you give a shout out to it, this shall be called my **Great Crayon Journey Around New York**. idk why i made this idk what's wrong with me

also, a bonus "joke" that i included at the end of the scores:

> you know, he's not hated. i like chance's chances
