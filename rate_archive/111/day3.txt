Can we just take a second to appreciate that this song would literally not even be here if I had not given /u/cloudbustingmp3 the literal most last minute extension of all time. I was so used to the later ballots not shifting placements that much that I thought it would be fine to take in one more... only for them to move this song back into Day 3! While I do prefer Gee but I'm still really happy to see this here since I was so worried it would leave prematurely. That chorus is one of the smoothest and catchiest things I ever heard and even first time listeners can agree with that. It's a shame it had to be first out, but to be fair the competition here is really stiff. 
---

## Love is 4 waAaAaAaAalls

**bookthieving** (11): a masterpiece!!! this production is so slick and sensual and creative, one of the best kpop songs ever

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): the greatest kpop song of ALL TIME! the dreamy house vibe... the emotional power of it being their first comeback without Sulli (may she rest in peace, i miss her)... the fact that it was their last comeback period before my faves Red Velvet replaced them because SM hates women... there's just a lot that goes into this for me. the formation in the bridge lives rent free in my mind

**musical\_pyn** (11): So I had never heard this song before this rate, but I knew it would be in contention for my favorite the first time I listened to it. There are very few songs that sound this smooth and effortless and have had me singing this chorus as much as I have been. I think every part of this song is pretty much perfect and when it’s put together and everything flows it becomes even more perfect

**wryn\_** (11): I didn't think I'd be giving this my 11 but its the only song here where after it was finished i just replayed it and replayed it and replayed it again, such a masterpiece

**1998tweety** (10): classic, racism will snub it

**anothertown** (10): the way that this transcends conflicts, borders, wars, coronavirus, political,

**bbfan132** (10): undeniable classic

**bespectacIed** (10): Greatest k-pop song of all time. Modern deep house classic.

**bigbigbee** (10): I know it’s become representative of the kind of annoying Pitchfork reader who only deigns to listen to “artsy” k-pop, but this song is legitimately great. It’s hypnotic, and pretty, and cool, and I feel it deserves props for its deep house sounds being pretty new / unique in the k-pop scene at the time of its release.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of the best Kpop songs ever made. I swear to GOD if I see any xenophobic “7: this is good for a Kpop song” comments I’m gonna lose it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): While I am not a huge f(x) stan, this song and its parent album was the gateway of me appreciating K-pop. While Blackpink and Twice were the reasons why I am now a full-fledged K-pop stan, this song holds a special place in my heart for the reason that started my journey into getting K-pop. Such a shame this was f(x)'s last comeback but at least they went out with a bang.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Tell me I'm the one for you, tell me that you want me too

**endcreditouilles** (10): ohhhh OHHHH I love this. First time I've ever heard it, ty to whoever put this here

**frogaranaman** (10): k-pop perfection

**hikkaru** (10): my personal fave kpop song and I KNOW that's a basic opinion for non-kpoppies so don't come at me but it's genuinely just… chefs kiss… the house/garage production is so so good, those piano stabs hit so hard, it's so tight and catchy and just absolutely perfect

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of the best kpop songs all time imo

**ImADudeDuh** (10): pitchfork snapped a little

**jasannn** (10): Go listen to the 4 Walls album if you haven't already. It's an amazing dance and electro pop album.

**kappyko** (10): love is four wawas

**ManofOranges** (10): Even though I've never ventured into anything deeper than the shallowest of water when it comes to kpop, I can at least confidently say that f(x) is a group that I thoroughly enjoy. This song specifically, is one that is deserving of the praise that gets thrown its way. It's almost ethereal with its hook, and I'm enthralled the whole way through.

**moonagenightmares** (10): stan f(x)

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): kpop excellence

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): this song goes slap the fuck off, it's a bop, it's a jam, it's creative, innovative, look up your faves could never in the dictionary and it's just this song playing.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I should really consider doing the next kpop rate because all the ones i discover from grab bag rates i end up really loving

**twat\_brained** (10): https://twitter.com/ReactionVideos_/status/1099815546374311938

**Vultuxe** (10): Absolutely iconic and I won't accept anyone saying otherwise.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): one of the best k-pop songs of all time i KNOW that’s right!!

**pat-rickstar** (9.3): I think 2021 might be the year I finally get into kpop

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): I have literally no idea what is happening in the MV, but it's a bop

**camerinian** (9): I fully endorse more K-pop groups making Disclosure songs. This fully slaps my god

**igorwithlicor** (9): Super super viby!

**nowqueenofpop** (9): Created the idea of great accidental disbandment singles

**rslashpoopheads** (9): whacking is the kpop fan's mating dance of choice

**runaway3212** (9): fucking spill

**vayyiqra** (9): b o p

**waluigiest** (9): I’ve rated this 3 times and I fall in love with the chorus over and over

**akanewasright** (8.5): Wow this bops

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it is very 2015 in some ways but it holds up surprisingly well

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8.2): idk what're they saying but i was vibing

**AHSWeeknd** (8): it’s honestly really catchy.

**astrologicalangel** (8): mostly cause I'm in love with Amber Liu

**fadedblue09** (8): Ehhh I gave this a 10 before but my Kpop tastes have changed drastically since. This just feels too “Western” for me. Stream Rum Pum Pum Pum instead.

**nightjesus** (8): oh this is a little bop. I thought f(x) was a male Kpop band I am so out of the loop I need to catch up.

**seanderlust** (8): i love the house instrumentals! it kind of drags a bit leading up to the final chorus

**skargardin** (8): yas

**steelstepladder** (8): It's not these walls by Kendrick Lamar but it's still great

**team\_kockroach** (8): Could’ve used a better chorus

**Stryxen** (7.8): woawoawoawoals <3

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): one of the best instrumentals on a kpop song I've heard for sure, definitely checking this group out more. never heard of them before this.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the rapper sounds really interesting!

**rickikardashian** (7.5): this sub hyped this song up so much that it will never be able to reach the bar y’all set for it

**jayjaysortagay** (7): 30 seconds of terrible vocals then good vibes for the rest

**nooodisaster** (7): I sense a deep depression masked by upbeat production with this one...

**pebbleheights** (7): This one slaps so hard.

**s4mmymusic** (7): this sounds like it was made in a laboratory specifically engineered to be played in an h&m but like i kinda love it for that

cremeebrulee: ## Xenophobia

**timothy444** (7): Alright k-pop song, I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): I wanna like this more, but outside of a pretty good hook this didn’t do it for me

**SmileAndTears** (6): Not for me

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): I thought a love song would have more legs to stand on than 4 Walls does but I was wrong

**CrimsonROSET** (4): if this is the best kpop song… that’s just unfortunate.

**notnotamotmot** (4): I dunno. I don't get this one. Inoffensive but ultimately unappealing.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): walls

## TO ALL YOU MFERS WHO THINK I RIGGED THIS RATE .... LOOK AT THIS RANK GRAPH AND TELL ME WOULD I INTENTIONALLY LET MY 11 LIVE OUT IN DAY 2 PURGATORY FOR NEARLY ALL OF THIS RATE???

Holy crap, if you talked to me at any point at ballot collection and I was :( about the results it was because I was so STRESSED about the placement of this ONE SONG. For a PHCJ meme, this was flopping so bad the entire time, lingering in the early 20s but never quite making it over. Thank fuck some higher songs came in late game and pushed this over but when I was the only 11 for this I was so embarrassed omg. All this talk about having Bree win this and then EP rate, while this was going out literally Day 2 before extensions came in. 

Regardless, this song DESERVED BETTER WTF. Someone once said this song is a modern day version of Brandy and Monica's The Boy Is Mine with a feminist twist and that is so true. Bree and Tate have such good chemistry here and those lyrics are funny as hell. Sure, call it a forced meme but also admit you hate fun while you're at it xoxo

---

## SAY THAT SHIT!!!!!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (11): MY NAME BREE AND I GO THE FUCK OFF FUCK WITH ALL THE BANGERS AND THE BOPSTERS. genuinely one of the best pop songs of recent memory, it is so so so good.

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this is the best song of 2020 its true its true. I really hope people don’t tank this because TK had to go and make it an overdone meme (I’m never gonna forgive you for that bestie). Bree runway is the MOMENT and is on her way to superstardom. Stream 2000AND4EVA

**Stryxen** (11): /uj This is so I can give People, I’ve been sad my 11 in the EP rate and still give this an 11 somehow but /rj Say that shit, better watch your back Better say that shit, better watch your back Yeah, say that shit, better watch your back Better say that shit, better watch your back Yeah, say that shit, better watch your back Better say that shit, better watch your back Yeah, say that shit, better watch your back If you wanna get it, get it like that!

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**akanewasright** (10): Stream Damn Daniel

**anothertown** (10): The way this is the pinnacle of 90s pastiche and no one else needs to try

**bbfan132** (10): grew on me immensely

**bespectacIed** (10): Modern feminism. My fave part of this song is the bridge when Keisha (bree) and Felicia (tate) finally linked up and jumped on daniel, then warned other women to not trust the MAN. Female solidarity, so beautiful.

**bulforster** (10): Now that Juice has reclaimed its crown as the main /r/popheadscirclejerk meme this deserves a rate win, as a treat.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ok i think i understand why this is gonna win now

**frogaranaman** (10): as a r/popheadscirclejerk mod, I must give this a 10

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): stream juice

**hikkaru** (10): coming for two time winner with this and the upcoming EP rate yup

**ignitethephoenix** (10): stream damn Daniel, PHCJ said so!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): iconic

**kappyko** (10): i have nothing to say on this song we are rating it next month

**ManofOranges** (10): Great song, plain and simple. I didn't do the rate this song was in, but if I did it would've gotten my 11, that's for sure.

**musical\_pyn** (10): Yeah I’m gonna need more adventures of Bree and Tate (or just at least more songs)

**nightjesus** (10): BEST SONG OF 2020. I think ‘that’s why I get my titties out when I’m with the scholar’s’ is one of my favourite lyrics ever.

**pat-rickstar** (10): So close to giving this my 11. We are getting #JusticeForBreeRunway and making this win, if not this rate then the EP rate in March

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): will phcj stay winning?

**ReallyCreative** (10): Juice might be the superior bop and phcj meme, but there is no denying that this song is one of 2020's best

**rickikardashian** (10): we keep on finding ways to rate damn daniel…. maybe the tkyola into making this a meme will work

**Roxieloxie** (10): You know what maybe I should've listened to this when TK sent me a link to this, I hadnt heard this for a while but its a banger, truly deserves the hype

**runaway3212** (10): WE LOVE TO SEE IT!!!

**skargardin** (10): they ate!!!!

**SmileAndTears** (10): Perhaps they snapped

**steelstepladder** (10): Possible winner?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): /u/TragicKingdom1

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I wont forgive phcj for letting this flop

**TragicKingdom1** (10): its pretty good

**twat\_brained** (10): this would've been #1 anywhere between 1986-1992.

**useless-sheep** (10): rip phcj damn daniel theme you will be missed

**worlds-okayest666** (10): you cant trust the man...its true its true!

**bookthieving** (9.5): bree runway and yung baby tate have so much charisma and personality, and they kill it with this great throwback beat and a fun story

**endcreditouilles** (9): one point deducted for each time you should stream juice

**jasannn** (9): the ending is perfection. stream damn daniel

**sirpancakeXI** (9): i thought this is a just a meme by phcj but it is actually good wtf

**waluigiest** (9): stream juice

**zagreux** (9): yes, im a phcj user <3

**nooodisaster** (8.5): This was fun. Love songs that tell a story and this one goes from A to Z with precision and creativity.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): the last 30 seconds tho

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Maybe this should be higher but I don't want people to think this can win two different rates in the span of a few months (do the EP rate when it happens!)

**TiltControls** (8.5): should have won its rate

**camerinian** (8): I mean I do really like this, I just can't shake the fact that Yung Baby Tate's verse sounds like something a RuPaul girl would write for a remix challenge at the start of the season and she'd probably get safe off of it but only because they're not eliminating any queens yet and God season 13 has been annoying so far

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): forced meme but still slaps

**flavasavavandal** (8): Surprised I like this as much as I did

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This song is good but I said what I said.

**jayjaysortagay** (8): this is one of my least favourite Bree songs but IT'S STILL A GODDAMN 8 BECAUSE SHE BRINGS IT TO EVERY BALL

**nowqueenofpop** (8): PHCJ's impact... but we need the audience to stream 2000AND4EVA!

**timothy444** (8): Starts out terrible, but it gets better (trust me)

cremeebrulee: ## BETTER WATCH YOUR BACK

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): good but forgettable

**s4mmymusic** (7): i like bree and yung baby tate but for some reason this song is not doing it for me like it’s doing it for everyone else

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): Despite phcj trying their best, this is NOT as good as Juice, and Bree has better songs (also this score feels appropriate)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): sorry damn daniel you’ll never be juice by lizzo

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Her rapping is nice, but it sounds like it will be generic and dated in a few years. The second coming of Juice it is not.

**wryn\_** (6.5): Juice will never be replaced

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I never got the hype, Bree Runaway has got much better songs.

**igorwithlicor** (5): Not for me but I don't wanna give it a lower score

**team\_kockroach** (4): I’m sorry r/popheadscirclejerk. This doesn’t sound like good rap

As one of the elite few with multiple songs in this rate, Gwen makes her final exist her with no doubt one of her best songs. Cool was predicted a frontrunner from the get-go, for its mature take on a breakup and its gorgeous movie video. It did fulfill that prophecy in the beginning, hanging out in a chill 3rd place but it seems like many people found this track a little too overhyped. Its slow decline almost made it to Day 2 but it managed to swing back into a respectable spot here. I think this is a fine spot for this song, which is what we're rating btw not the music video in case you forgot :)

---

## You and me are still good friends

**brenda\_official** (11): one of the best hit songs of all time. maybe the best lol

**fadedblue09** (11): As much as I love Mimi, I believe this was ROBBED from a rate win. This timeless new wave masterpiece somehow lost to an inferior rehash of ‘Breakdown’(which Mariah has done countless times in her career anyways).

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): This song is perfection. Yes it's a total fantasy but lmao I want it !!!!!

**J\_Toe** (11): Should be the winner of every rate, tbh. Makes you feel like you're the unrequited corner of a love triangle playing out in front to Lake Como

**yatcho** (11): rate host bias but sue me, I love this song and it just gets better every time I watch the video at 2am in my feelings

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a jam. I love the verses and chorus on this song, they give off a feeling like you're drifting/floating.

**bbfan132** (10): that was a classic, that was a classic

**bespectacIed** (10): the video is better than the song and the song is a 10/10

**celladonn** (10): Genuinely one of the greatest post-breakup songs of all time

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): pop perfection is such a misused term on this sub but this absolutely fits the bill. the nostalgia... whew

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): If we were rating music videos too this would be the winner

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a perfect song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is legitimately one of the best pop songs ever made in the 21st century.

**Kimchiprince** (10): marilyn stefani did the damn thing

**MrSwearword** (10): Gwen's best song

**musical\_pyn** (10): I absolutely love that this song exists, both in terms of being pretty unique in its subject and in the fact that it is one of the most perfect pop songs I have ever heard.

**nooodisaster** (10): The lyrics are simple yet so mature, and even through the hints of bittersweetness, this song just radiates calm to me and... peace. Honestly, my favorite Gwen song.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): An all-time classic, this losing was a real blow to the culture

**rickikardashian** (10): oh to be reliving the romance i had with an old partner in italy as im meeting his new fiance in my beautiful gold mansion

**sirpancakeXI** (10): loving the instrumental between the verses

**skargardin** (10): it was a classic yup

**teenage\_meme** (10): one of my all-time faves! it's fresh and nostalgic at the same time, and it's such a gorgeous story.

**TiltControls** (10): You don't hear songs about mutual breakups too often and it's a shame. The lyrics in this song are heartbreakingly sweet and I love that the two hold no animosity toward each other

**worlds-okayest666** (10): idk what it is but something about this song is just so GOOD! one of my all-time fave pop songs

**seanderlust** (9.4): we stan emotional maturity.

**bulforster** (9): we stan emotional maturity (and L.A.M.B.'s only non-appopriative video!)

**ManofOranges** (9): It's a very beautiful song. Although it doesn't quite take me all the way, there's still so much to love about it.

**plastichaxan** (9): sometimes i just forget the greatness of this song and it seems unfair

**racloves** (9): this song is very cool

**timothy444** (9): Friendship is Magic

**waluigiest** (9): still one of the best breakup songs ever written

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song is just lovely. It feels like a classic in the best sense of the word.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): it's such a seamlessly pop song. it's cool it's SO FUCKING COOL

**jsonphile** (8.5): Gwen’s best solo song easily

**anothertown** (8): I can’t argue with the fact that the song is good, I just don’t think it belonged on LAMB. It doesn’t have the personality of the rest of that album. Put cute next to gorgeous, etc.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): This song is cool, but it also cooled off on me. I dunno, just never went anywhere? I was waiting for the 1-2-elevated chorus and we just got 1-2-3.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): gwen peaked with this music video whew the cinammon topography

**igorwithlicor** (8): Very nice vibe, nice beat

**jasannn** (8): This song sounds nostalgic even though I don't recall ever listening to this song before this rate.

**lillipup03** (8): I love it when songs can make you feel nostalgic when you've never even heard them before...

**notnotamotmot** (8): Funny that this song is first on the list to rate. I've been feeling it lately and it's been getting added to all my playlists.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's an iconic song but like far too many songs in this rate, its a bit overrated

**rslashpoopheads** (8): the nostalgia of all this :pepesadbop:

**SmileAndTears** (8): I think it needed a better bridge or a switch up to really drive the song home. As much as she keeps saying she's 'cool' with how they ended up you can tell she's still sad about how things went down because of her delivery but nothing happens sonically to illustrate that. The song just kinda feels incomplete. Still a bop tho

**steelstepladder** (8): Shiny summery bop

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): ugh so good

**Vultuxe** (8): Oh this will never stop being iconic.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): ok but driving down the real harbor boulevard to this can be transcendent

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I wonder if Gwen will perform this when Britney goes swimming with Blake Shelton

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): I’ve sort of cooled on this song as I’ve grown up and realised that Gwen Stefani’s debut album is not really that special. But this song still tells a fairly interesting story from a mature perspective and I do like that there are hints that some things are still not sitting right in their new situation even if they are both mature enough to realise that they would be happier if they didn’t say a thing. I do wish the song either played more with that to add more flavour to the song or made them more subtle to make the song more layered.

**mynameistoo\_common** (7.5): a good song, but not one that I would find particularly memorable

**frogaranaman** (7): it’s okay, probably a grower but hasn’t grown on me yet

**nightjesus** (7): this song could be released this year and I bet it would still chart.

**team\_kockroach** (7): not the best pop-rock I’ve heard

**wryn\_** (7): The production here has aged so well, i feel like if she released this now it would still make popheads top 10 of the year

**kappyko** (6.5): 😎

cremeebrulee: ## You and me aren't though

**Roxieloxie** (6.4): It's not bad but it reminds me of another song and its driving me crazy trying to figure out what it is

**hunnybee12** (6): overhyped i fear

**NotWith10000Men** (6): eh. I've never heard this one before. Not a fan of her vocal affect but that might just be gwen?

**s4mmymusic** (6): it’s a good song but like... y’all hype it up so much

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i like the lyrics a lot i just wish the music was a lot more interesting

**vayyiqra** (6): It's okay but there are better songs on L.A.M.B. Don't get the hype myself

**runaway3212** (4.5): Hollaback girl outsold by quite a bit

**zagreux** (2): I know this is one of Gwen's most-loved songs but I do not vibe with this, it sounds extremely boring and dated

**AHSWeeknd** (1): This sounds like it’d play in both the trailer and the final scene of a 2005 movie about some 34 year woman who went back home for a family reunion and got caught up in an old high school relationship. But after spending nine months of rekindling their relationship she goes back to the big town leaving him behind.

**nowqueenofpop** (1): This is the lowest score I’ve ever given and I stand by it. I cannot stand this song! I was shocked by how loved this song is… the way she sings “I know we’re kewl” irritates me so much and it didn't help it was always on when I worked.

I think it's fair to call this song Dancing On My Own's younger and overlooked sister. It attempts to capture the magic in that iconic Robyn track but doesn't quite hit the mark. Personally this song makes me feel icky because I've been the girlfriend in the scenario and it's not a super great feeling, even if Robyn sounds quite earnest on this track. People were quite worried this song would take the crown, but fear not it makes its departure here!

---

## Say it's not her fault
**seanderlust** (11): GOD this is such a good song. the story, the vocals, the video, that part where her singing "you" turns into its own dance break AAAAAHHH

**1998tweety** (10): massive gay bop

**anothertown** (10): This personally is my quintessential Robyn song, the concept is iconic, the breakdown is perfect, and I always think of the video of Taran Killam doing a shot for shot remake of the music video.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i already know what the shitpost for this song is and i am fine with it

**bbfan132** (10): i remember reading something about how taran killam memorized robyn’s entire dance routine to this once, interesting fun fact

**Brendon-Urine** (10): if this song doesn't make you stop what you're doing and dance like Robyn in the MV you're not actually gay

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): As someone who got dumped because my ex found someone new…. Fuck you Robyn, you 100% deserve to dance on your own

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is advanced white woman synthpop

**izeasklapaucius** (10): one of the first songs that made me fall in love with her body of work <3

**jackisboredtoday** (10): The way you can feel all three perepectives at once hearing this, its just amazing all-around

**Kimchiprince** (10): u and you know why

**MrSwearword** (10): the song that got me interested in Robyn when she performed it on SNL

**musical\_pyn** (10): I think people might see this as a lesser version of dancing on my own, but it completely holds up by itself (and I think the breakdown/bridge is better than anything else on the album)

**NFLfreak98** (10): Not as good as Dancing On My Own, but what is?

**nooodisaster** (10): An iconic masterpiece of lyricism & production. Yes, I am gay for Robyn.

**plastichaxan** (10): robyn really was the blueprint

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): when will this song describe my life instead of dancing on my own smh

**rickikardashian** (10): in my head, this song is about a gay man trying to get with a guy with a girlfriend, becasue the feelings displayed in this song can only come from a member of the lgbtq+ community

**runaway3212** (10): Better than dancing on my own no its true

**twat\_brained** (10): it's not lost on me the irony of Robyn literally dancing on her own in this video but it's not DOMO. still a great song

**vayyiqra** (10): [Copied from my comment on "Get Outta My Way"] I have some doubts about the lyrics to this song but will just put them aside because it makes me happy

**worlds-okayest666** (10): idk if the thing about this being from the perspective of the woman Robyn’s ex-boyfriend gets with in Dancing On My Own is true but i’m gonna pretend it is bc it’s such a mastermind moment

**jsonphile** (9.5): okay I am a sinner because I’ve never actually listened to anything from Robyn besides Dancing On My Own (obviously a banger) but uhhh clearly I’ve been missing out my bad

**AHSWeeknd** (9): This is the sort of depression-pop Sia strives to achieve.

**astrologicalangel** (9): I have listened to this sing WAY too many times

**bulforster** (9): Flawless to the point where I wish it were a bit messier.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): the weakest of the body talk singles but still incredible

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Please don't let this win, I love Robyn, but come on..

**frogaranaman** (9): this album is so good

**LuisEnRod** (9): (Jaida Essence Hall introduced me to this song)

**nootnoot781** (9): obligatory stan ms. jaida essence hall comment

**notnotamotmot** (9): Anybody else lipsync to this very emotionally on their own? Just me?

**ReallyCreative** (9): gay rights

**rslashpoopheads** (9): yes, please call me

**s4mmymusic** (9): the vocaloid bridge yasss

**steelstepladder** (9): Robyn is kind of a bitch on this I love it

**zagreux** (9): slaps ngl

**jasannn** (8.5): great bridge, great lyrics and surprisingly danceable.

**wryn\_** (8.5): As a guy i like to sing this and pretend that im so hot ive converted and stolen a girls bf which is super toxic behaviour and im sorry

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I thought this was WAY newer than it actually was.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): makes me want to become straight just to get a gf to call, sorry bf!!

**igorwithlicor** (8): Yes, tell me what to do Robyn!

**ManofOranges** (8): I still believe this song is fine for the most part. It's not amazing to me the same way other people love it so much, but it's good. Watching the video of Taran Killam dancing to this song probably made me enjoy it more overtime.

**skargardin** (8): this is great, not one of Robyn's absolute best but still.

**Stryxen** (8): lowkey don’t really care about this song but I pay my dues to the original main alt pop girl

**waluigiest** (8): Robyn never misses

**hikkaru** (7.5): not a big robyn fan tbh but this bops a bit

**nightjesus** (7.5): Lyrics are controversial but damn she pleads a good case.

cremeebrulee: ## It is yours though

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): eh it’s boppy but there feels like something missing

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): This is better than Dancing on my Own, but not by much. I feel like most of Robyn's songs just have really underwhelming choruses (and this is no exception)

**mynameistoo\_common** (7): the 2000s version of break up with your girlfriend I’m bored

**NotWith10000Men** (7): this is the perfect tempo for this song

**timothy444** (7): Now imagine if Calum Scott covered this :heart_eyes:

**Vultuxe** (7): It's good... is it a groundbreaking decade highlight? No

**bigbigbee** (6.5): My friend once mentioned that she HATES this song’s lyrics, and ever since she pointed it out, I haven’t been able to enjoy the song in the same way I used to. That’s why it’s better to not have friends.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Omg I was wondering why this sounded so familiar but I did some research and Marie-Mai did a french version of this and it was all over the radio a couple years ago. Anyway, this is just ok. Never really cared much for this song and the synths don't add much for me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): okay...

**FKJVMMP** (5): God I want to like Robyn so much because she’s SO GOOD, but I just can’t. It’s so blah. I feel like a failure.

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): i love this song, but it can also fuck off.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): gays, he’s not gonna leave her for you

**kappyko** (4): for soem reason this does NOT hit

**sirpancakeXI** (4): i don't like the way she drag her voice

The CLIMB this song made omg. I wasn't sure how Billie would perform in this rate. While she did well for herself in 2019 Ultimate and the Grammy's, her earliest ballots put her immediately into Day 1. But over time, more people seemed to agree that this song is a massive bop and it manage to rise all the way up to this spot, beating out massive sub faves and peers Ariana and Taylor. I fucking adore this track, it's slick and that outro is some of the most interesting production I've heard. Alas, this is where we will be saying bye to her so make sure to stream Therefore I Am while we wait for her sophomore album!

## Just can't get enough guy

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): grown on me and it was already a 10

**bulforster** (10): Still slaps. duh.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Iconic.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I've never heard a more accurate audio portrayal of my edgy pre-teen angst days, proof time travel exists

**frogaranaman** (10): I like this song because it makes millennials mad

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): my borderline millenial/gen-z friends pretend they're too old for this mega bop but i'm not ashamed

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): I liked Billie way before this album but this song is what made me go "oh oh wait yeah she has It" duh

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a modern classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the most iconic song of the past 3 years tbh.

**J\_Toe** (10): thank god the track doesn't have that gross Invisalign slurp like the music video does

**jasannn** (10): duh

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): banger

**plastichaxan** (10): the outro pushes it to a ten for me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Everything about this track is fantastic, and I'm so glad it got so successful (also the fact that the "snare" sound in the chorus is actually the sound from pedestrian crossings in Melbourne makes me feel like I have a weird connection to the track)

**rickikardashian** (10): not always does the GP appreciate masterpieces like this, very less make it one of the biggest songs around the world, so bad guy getting the love it deserved was a joy to witness

**skargardin** (10): the drop makes me feral

**teenage\_meme** (10): this song still goes SO HARD. obsessed with the breakdown. i think i'll love this one forever

**timothy444** (10): One of the best pop songs released in the past few years. Billie Eilish knows how to craft catchy hooks and breakdowns.

**twat\_brained** (10): I love Billie

**waluigiest** (10): I couldn’t give this less than a 10, it’s just a stunning clean gorgeous song. This whole album was fantastic she is truly an ARTIST

**bookthieving** (9.5): this song is crazy addictive. DUH

**steelstepladder** (9.5): Duh

**ChandelierFlickering** (9.4): did not like this when it first came out, but it has long since grown on me

**akanewasright** (9): God I miss 2019 (I don’t actually but it was nice being able to go outside)

**anothertown** (9): look at how she made a classic!

**bespectacIed** (9): there are few beats in modern pop music that are as memorable as bad guy's. WIlliam really could retire off of this song alone.

**kappyko** (9): more like good song

**lillipup03** (9): The trap part at the end is the best part of the song. Fight me, popheads.

**LuisEnRod** (9): (if Billie seduced my dad and married him at least I’d be rich... right?)

**pebbleheights** (9): there is a reason this song got so popular.

**Stryxen** (9): what a moment - I wish people talked about this song even more it really IS that good

**vayyiqra** (9): A banger but the breakdown at the end always felt a little aimless

**NFLfreak98** (8.9): duh

**seanderlust** (8.8): this is a vibe. this is an attitude. "I don't see what she sees but maybe it's cause i'm wearing your cologne?" yes. i'm here for miss billy eyelash.

**jsonphile** (8.5): it’s a good song. duh

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I hear something new in the background every time

**CrimsonROSET** (8): They deleted Seth Everman's comment, and I don't know how to feel about it.

**flavasavavandal** (8): duh!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I was like “wait this didn’t win its rate?” and then I realized I was thinking of the Justin Bieber remix winning the bonus rate

**ManofOranges** (8): No offense to this song, but I don't think it's amazing. I think part of it may have to do with the fact that I was so into Billie's earlier stuff, like I was a huge fan of Don't Smile at Me, so I guess I was expecting a lot more when Billie really became a breakout star. But I was just underwhelmed. I can certainly see what might make this a 10 for some people, but I just can't quite give it full marks because of how I feel just a little let down by it.

**musical\_pyn** (8): This song is just so weird and I can't really believe it was a hit? Billie does this kind of sound better other places on the album though, so this seems like a good place for it

**nightjesus** (8): I’m so proud of how far Billie has come in such a short time at her young age. I’m so excited for her new album and what her and her brother do next.

**ReallyCreative** (8): duh

**rslashpoopheads** (8): d udhffhushfjsdifvsihegviaenhgvlawknlglkne

**runaway3212** (8): Good but cringy

**s4mmymusic** (8): still goes off

**TiltControls** (8): if there's one thing Billie can do really well, it's setting the atomosphere. And this song works in all the right ways in that regard

**Kimchiprince** (7): not for me but credit given where credits due

cremeebrulee: ## So you're a tough guy?

**SmileAndTears** (7): eh. It's ok

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): I still don’t get this song, and I think it’ll age poorly. But it’s not bad?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I know this song is decent but overplay has thoroughly killed it for me so I can’t enjoy it again until like 2024 :(

**AHSWeeknd** (6): The outro makes this great, otherwise the song gets old pretty quickly.

**nooodisaster** (6): I used to tolerate this song but I feel like it's already aged like milk

**Vultuxe** (6): It's a bop but the lyrics are really questionable. Considering her other works... this song is a sore thumb to be honest.

**notnotamotmot** (5): I think I'd like Billie more if she just fully embraced being spooky and I only had to hear her music around Halloween. I just don't want to hear this type of music the rest of the year.

**FKJVMMP** (3): I still don’t get it. And I can’t take anybody named Finneas seriously.

**igorwithlicor** (3): Doesn't work at all for me. The lyrics are specially bad. And the ending is kinda terrible

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): i was moving the summer this came out and i drove across the country and while i like it, this song and old town road took turns being the only song outside of 7 rings to play for about six states. i almost drove into a pole and hereditary'd myself trying to change the station.

**Roxieloxie** (3): why are the billie songs i dont like the ones always in all stars

**Jackalope117** (0): I hate this song more than I hate my life

A karaoke staple! Wannabe did quite well for itself in the 90s and here as well, spending nearly all of its time in Day 3. I mean, what else can I say about this song other than it's a classic? Still, while we all enjoyed this, no one really committed to giving any 11s so I think it's fair to let this leave here!

---

## If you wanna be my lover, you gotta give me 10s

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**akanewasright** (10): perfection

**bbfan132** (10): started singing along to this when i was 6 or 7, still sing along to it now

**bespectacIed** (10): mel b's bridge is the nicki monster verse of the 90s

**bulforster** (10): An absolutely iconic debut. It's also apparently the catchiest song released since the 1940s according to like... science!

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): a bop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Spice Girls is really the blueprint for modern girl groups today, huh?

**frogaranaman** (10): SOOOOOOOO ILLTELLYAWHATIWANTWHATIREALLYREALLYWANT SOILLTELLYAWHATIWANTOHWHATIREALLYREALLYWANT IWANTA

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): It’s still a little bit astonishing that this song has become such a big and beloved hit because it’s so… strange? Like the lyrics are unusual, the vocal delivery is bizarre, the structure and line distribution are atypical, on paper it seems like this should be considered an embarrassing meme hit a la “Barbie Girl” but somehow it works! I think it prevails through the power of sheer fun, it really feels like you’re at a sleepover with the girls just hanging out and having a good time. Now I wanna rewatch Spice World

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): the way this one song is better than 5h, LM, and PD's entire musical output

**ignitethephoenix** (10): in an ideal world this should win but it probably won’t

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is pure fun in song form, and I would like to give a special thank you to Chicken Little for first introducing me to this song.

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): that rap is legendary

**rickikardashian** (10): i know this will make it far, and some people will be so angry at it, and i cant wait to witness it:)

**Roxieloxie** (10): invented friendship

**runaway3212** (10): Absolute banger

**Stryxen** (10): i just now decided this is gonna be one of my favourite songs

**TiltControls** (10): One of the pinnicles of pop music

**timothy444** (10): If I ever were to be transported to Equestria and meet all the ponies, one of the first things I would do is to ask Twilight Sparkle to listen to this song. But wait? How would that be possible if you had no way to stream that song and you forgot all your devices? Well shut up it's my fantasy you don't get to ask any questions

**twat\_brained** (10): Spice vs All Saints vs S Club 7 when? or at least another 90s UK girl group?

**useless-sheep** (10): love this but had it as my alarm for maybe a full year because i couldn’t be bothered to change it.. grave mistake. might have accidentally been my introduction to looping

**vayyiqra** (10): This song was a formative experience and deserves more respect

**worlds-okayest666** (10): one of the best pop songs of all time i KNOW that’s right!! need more of yall to start giving the spice girls the respect they deserve

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): I didn't realize this was gonna be this song lmfao

**hunnybee12** (9): crazy how all girl group songs named wannabe are smashes

**igorwithlicor** (9): Another classic, and for a good reason

**jasannn** (9): ITZY outsold but this is still good

**lillipup03** (9): This song was such a guilty pleasure back when I thought I was straight...

**rslashpoopheads** (9): a classique

**seanderlust** (8.9): when I was a kid I wasn't really sure what i'd be doing at this age, but I really thought that "googling 'are the spice girls still friends' at 11 PM on a tuesday" really wasn't going to be it

**anothertown** (8.5): Mel B absolutely carries this entire song

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): bop

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): the call and response is one of the most iconic sugar rushes in pop history but honestly the verses don’t live up to how perfect that hook (and bridge) is

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): this music video made me go crazy as a child

**LuisEnRod** (8): (this song was #1 on Billbord the week before I was born... just thought I’d let y’all know)

**notnotamotmot** (8): Honestly, I think this song is obnoxious and it has a lot of elements in it that I've rated other songs on this list low for, but damn if it doesn't get me singing along every single time. The nostalgia factor is strong.

**s4mmymusic** (8): the only british people i don’t hate

**Vultuxe** (8): Cute song, it's a classic, nothing else needs to be said.

**waluigiest** (8): ok chicken little

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): My mum tells me I used to dance my one-year-old gay ass to this in a diaper whenever this or Spice Up Your Life came on MTV back in the day

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): overrated but it does bang a bit

**wryn\_** (7.5): I can't get over the fact that i have literally no idea what this song is about

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I always found this a little cheesy, but it’s such a bop.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): People often look down on this song, but it's kinda relevant how, if someone doesn't mesh well with your friendgroup, they're probably not gonna fully mesh well with you. So, it holds up!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): tbh outside of a good hook, this is meh

**musical\_pyn** (7): 30 seconds of this song is easily a 10 and the rest is meh

**pebbleheights** (7): This song always puts me in a good mood.

We finally eliminate our first Charity Rate II song! As a rate, CRII really popped off. It had the most songs in (4!) and all of them made top 15. Unfortunately, this AMV anthem will not be moving on, despite how attached some of us might be to this banger. I think this is an okay spot for this considering it's far from Cascada's best and there's definitely more deserving songs over this. 

---

**Twerkus** (11): Hands down one of the greatest songs ever made

**1998tweety** (10): Literal pop perfection. So many nostalgic memories to this song.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Does anybody NOT like this song? I have never met one if they exist. Special shout-out to the nightcore version.

**bulforster** (10): Banger to end all bangers

**flavasavavandal** (10): I don’t have much to say about the quality of the song, other than I think it’s outstanding, but I want the chance to ruin some childhoods by reminding/informing people that Cascada is more than one person

**frogaranaman** (10): man middle school dances went hard as fuck to this shit

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This did so much for our culture

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): a milestone on my journey to becoming a full-fledged homosexual

**hikkaru** (10): absolute classic, gives me that buzz always

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Dance Dance Revolution is more iconic than anything from sony or microsoft

**Kimchiprince** (10): school disco royalty

**LuisEnRod** (10): (one of the best songs ever made, stay mad h8rz)

**ManofOranges** (10): If this song never would have existed, so much of the AMVs I watched never could have existed. Nightcore itself never could have existed without this song. And if that doesn't spell impact, then what does?

**musical\_pyn** (10): The song might be a little dated, but I don’t care. This is exactly the sound I remember whenever anybody brings up this kind of 2000s electro pop and I love it

**runaway3212** (10): duh

**s4mmymusic** (10): weddings, graduations, funerals

**seanderlust** (10): the year is 2006. you, a soft-spoken 9th grader, sit at your family computer. you open a folder called "Chemistry Assignments October" which sits nested inside of a number of other folders. instead of notes from class you find a different chemistry - several fan-made images you saved of Sora and Riku from Kingdom Hearts in various poses: kissing in close up; sipping hot cocoa in front of a fire; curled up in Sora's childhood bed; sharing a paopu fruit to bond each other for life. little moments shared. they've been through so much. you open Windows Movie Maker and open a new file. after so much practice, the movements come naturally. File, Import Media, Cascada_EverytimeWeTouch.mp3. you smile. your labor of love begins.

**skargardin** (10): a song for the ages

**SmileAndTears** (10): I have nothing to say other than stream this Goku x Vegeta AMV <3 (but let it be known that Goten x Trunks is the superior ship, I just couldn't find a decent AMV for them)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ive listened to the nightmare version in so many memes that the original doesn’t even sound natural anymore

**teenage\_meme** (10): the first song i ever downloaded on itunes. in my personal opinion, one of the greatest songs of all time

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the most important white woman contribution to society

**TiltControls** (10): Classic of middle school dances

**timothy444** (10): How the hell did this not win the Charity rate? It's energetic af and its catchiness just makes me want to dance hard!

**twat\_brained** (10): look I really want Britney to win but as the Pophead who voted this into the charity rate this is the next song I want to win the most. Also, can anyone really hate Cascada?

**camerinian** (9.5): Not that I condone it at all, but uh this played during my first MD trip and it was basically the pinnacle of human feeling so that's cool

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): massive bop, bring back Kascada!

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): the AMV classic of all classics

**nightjesus** (9.5): low key flex I used to get ‘Sing Star’ rank when I sang this on Sing Star. I am your main pop girl now.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I didn't have my AIM name set as xXfEeLtHeStAtIc for nothing

**cherryices** (9.2): sitting behind the school canteen where the teachers can’t see you, playing this song from a motorola razr... that’s history

**pat-rickstar** (9.2): This may not be a Eurovision song but it's a Eurovision song in spirit. Edit: I just googled Cascada and learned they were on Eurovision once just not with this song, and that feels so correct

**CrimsonROSET** (9): that one ben shapiro meme

**fadedblue09** (9): This is one of those songs that is terribly dated but has a certain charm, and it's a guilty pleasure for me. I do have a hard time listening to it w/o cringing though.

**igorwithlicor** (9): Classic!

**jasannn** (9): Dance Dance Revolution Music

**jayjaysortagay** (9): so many memories ☺️

**lillipup03** (9): I feel like a lot of trance music sounds exactly the same, but it's such a good sound that I'll never complain.

**racloves** (9): still slaps

**team\_kockroach** (9): Dubstep was around in 2005? Color me surprised.

**vayyiqra** (9): [Adapted from my comment on "Unwritten"] It's great though I don't get why this is the one song anyone remembers from them (hot take: "Evacuate the Dancefloor" is better)

**akanewasright** (8.5): https://youtu.be/hTyCLMA90xM

**jsonphile** (8.5): iconic banger to this day

Infamous for beating Juice for #1 in /r/popheads Top 100 Songs of 2019 but then subsequently losing its own rate, Gone gets circlejerk'd constantly by XCX stans as being Charli's best song. And yeah, it's a really good fucking song but the way yall overhype this to other people ... you're setting her up here. Which doesn't make this placement so shocking, since it's a good compromise between the song's fans and antis. I'm sad to see this go still, since Charli and Christine collaborate perfectly here and the breakdown at the end is just *chef's kiss*. Charli definitely has the capability to outdo herself here tho, as we've seen with how i'm feeling now, an album we will be rating soon so keep an eye out for that!

---
## Why do we keep when the water runs (???)

**CreepyMannequin** (11): I’m not even a Charli stan but this one of the best songs of all time

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): There's something about this song that feels like it has the elements of the perfect pop song of 2019. This has mainstream appeal while still remaining faithful to the hyper-pop elements that Charli came to known in previous eras. Charli and Christine had great chemistry in this duet. This song should've been a bigger hit and re-establish Charli in the mainstream spotlight after being a critical darling in many music circles.

**slimboyfriend** (11): I was gonna give my 11 to this, September, or Last Dance, but this is the only one I've cried to :/

**waluigiest** (11): One of my favorite songs of the last decade honestly. When it came out summer 2019 I listened to it endlessly. Literally on loop wherever I went for at least a month. The production is QUITE SERIOUSLY immaculate. Just a clean, polished, shimmering song. It’s pop that’s been exaggerated and stretched just a tiny bit so it fits in this very lite hyperpop pocket. And the lyrics???? They make no sense!! I love it!!!

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**anothertown** (10): it’s not overrated, it’s just rated! Because it is that good!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): juice rights

**bbfan132** (10): i thought i was sick of this but fuck it, it’s a 10

**Brendon-Urine** (10): still dont know what the fuck "why do we keep when the water runs" means but idc </3

**camerinian** (10): Charli is love, Christine is life

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I FEEL SO UNSTABLE

**frogaranaman** (10): man, that BREAKDOWN. so good

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): a potential 11 contender

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I know people think this Charli song is overrated but this is my second favourite song from her after vroom vroom

**izeasklapaucius** (10): come fucking ON this is the best single she'd ever released.

**jasannn** (10): the perfect mix of experimental and radio friendly pop music.

**Kimchiprince** (10): C & C

**ManofOranges** (10): This got my 11 in the rate it was in. I initially expected it to win, but as the rate went on it I could tell that the So Hot was probably going to win instead. Which is fine; I do love that song. But this song is amazing as well. Maybe the lyrics don't make a lot of sense, but on the whole I don't give that much of a shit about lyrics. The sound is where it's at for me, and this sounds great.

**musical\_pyn** (10): I love this song way too much for someone with a stable and supportive group of friends

**pat-rickstar** (10): Between this and Lipgloss we have possibly Charli's two best collabs ever in this rate, taste

**pebbleheights** (10): it’s an extremely satisfying collection of thwumps and beeps and keep-keekeep-kekeep-dudududu

**plastichaxan** (10): charli never misses

**runaway3212** (10): This beating Juice was truly legendary

**skargardin** (10): honestly still shocked that this did not win the rate i hosted, yall better not do it dirty!

**steelstepladder** (10): Remember when this dethroned Juice lol

**timothy444** (10): That last minute of the song where all the vocal chops come out in full blast: now that is simply euphoric

**twat\_brained** (10): seeing this live twice in two nights changed me

**zagreux** (10): What did they do? THAT.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Would be a perfect song if it weren’t for the nonsense Christine verse.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): The pots and pans outro was highly unnecessary but apart from that I love this

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): First verse could’ve been better

**astrologicalangel** (9): another one I have listened to way too many times

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): a perfect single, don't @ me

**nightjesus** (9): honestly one of the best collabs in the last few years and if you disagree you have no taste.

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's fantastic but it robbed Juice in the sub's 2019 top 100 so it's going to get robbed in spectacular fashion and I won't be mad about it

**Stryxen** (9): for 4 minutes and 6 seconds I don’t mind french “people”

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i like this song a lot but holy shit is this overrated on this sub. this isn’t what the future of music is gonna sound like.

**Vultuxe** (9): This was so left field for her. When it released her fanbase collectively went insane for a few days.

**wryn\_** (9): Throwback to when this was announced and i was so overwhelmed i actually started crying in front of my family

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): I just know this was once “I feel so unstable fuckin hate my label” bc the rhyme fits so much better that way

**seanderlust** (8.7): i love the end of this song

**akanewasright** (8): This is a good song but I’ve burnt myself out on it.

**bigbigbee** (8): It’s good, but how did this outperform Juice in the Popheads 2019 Top 100?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Well, look at the material. You can be the judge of it.

**hunnybee12** (8): i overplayed this. it's my own fault!

**igorwithlicor** (8): Like the beat, very nice

**J\_Toe** (8): you know, I like this song. But idk why I don't love this song.

**nooodisaster** (8): Actually a really good song, even if the feature doesn't feel essential. (but if this makes top 10 plz change my score to a 3)

**PointlessBibliophage** (8): i still maintain that the album has better songs than this

**s4mmymusic** (8): reminded of when i mashed this song up with i’m not okay by mcr and dorian electra tweeted it and charli liked it

**vayyiqra** (8): A well-made song but the weird grammar in the lyrics bothers me a bit (yes I know it's because Christine is French) and let's be real, it's overrated

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): I see the classic that many people proclaim Gone to be, I really do find the pre-chorus to be almost perfect and cathartic. But if Charli made this song like 10% more conventional and removed that jarring bridge prevents me from liking this more. Sorry

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I like the beat

**MrSwearword** (7): I mean cool, Christine kills it

cremeebrulee: ## I feel so unstable, fucking hate these people

**sirpancakeXI** (7): I've never get the appeal of this song, its not a bad song by any mean but is it THAT good?

**rickikardashian** (6.5): the more this sub tries to convince me this is a masterpiece, the less i like it

**lillipup03** (6): It was good until the last minute...

**RandomHypnotica** (6): I just don't GET IT. Whyyyyy do people love this track so much, enough to call it the best in Charli's discography? It's not an awful song or anything, but it's just so average to me, I don't see what people love about it at ALL

**TiltControls** (6): fine, but honestly a bit overrated

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): I wish there was more going on than just the thumps

**hikkaru** (5): still think this is not super interesting sorry! love charli but this is very mid imo. juice was robbed

**AHSWeeknd** (4): It ain’t all that.

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): i don't get her voice. i have four charlie xcx songs i can tolerate, and everything else is just nothing.

**joshually** (2): This song is not note worthy

**bespectacIed** (1): Hated this song before, still hate it now

**ImADudeDuh** (1): yikes!

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I’ve hate this song from the moment it came out. I don’t get the lyrics, I’ve never understood the hype around Christine and the Queens (I say this every time but their voice is a block of hard plastic!), and this song is just obnoxious! It’s a wall of distorted fart sounds and a disjointed melody masquerading as something artsy… I was a big Charli fan for a hot second there but her latest stuff just is. not. it. Glad she’s found critical acclaim and a dedicated fan base but she’s gone somewhere that I cannot follow.

Another classic departing before the top 10. Unwritten has some of the best songwriting in this rate and it just feels so optimistic and uplifting. My first tumblr username was straight up a lyric from this bop! We love our white women here on /r/popheads but this is definitely one of the standouts here on this rate so it's a shame that it couldn't make it any further than here. 

---
## Feel the rain on your skin

**1998tweety** (11): Ugh this is so damn iconic. Everything you want from a song is here. Good lyrics, good vocals, a BOP chorus, and there's even more than you never would've thought to ask for like a choir. We absolutely stan.

**sirpancakeXI** (11): my favorite discovery from this rate, im shocked that ive never heard this song before

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): the most important white woman contribution to society

**anothertown** (10): https://youtu.be/Zkf5SSdfQYA?t=28

**bbfan132** (10): thought i didn’t like this as much now but i was totally wrong lol

**bigbigbee** (10): Oh, you thought you could get me to give a 10 just by picking a mid-00s chart topper with an acoustic guitar and gospel choir? You REALLY thought? You were right

**camerinian** (10): The fucking build up from the pre-chorus into the chorus proper is one of the biggest pop moments ever. It's a musical long pent-up nut and I love being edged

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This was like, a moment. To this day, I know every word. I think that's the main reason why my taste is so basic today, why try something else if this works this well?

**frogaranaman** (10): that prechorus is GODSEND

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh boy did listening to this one for the rate reawaken something inside of me, I’ve been streaming this over and over again all week just dancing in my kitchen.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): young me thought the lyrics were release your inner-bitching and i thought the song was about not caring about being a bitch. disappointed that's not what natasha meant but the song still hits.

**hunnybee12** (10): this song raised me

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/569651722646061058/792604742823182346/Minecraft_Dance.gif

**joshually** (10): This is one of my gay anthems

**Kimchiprince** (10): Natasha! Come back!

**LuisEnRod** (10): (reminds me of being in the 5th grade and being in love with my best friend who introduced me to this song because he heard it in a shampoo ad)

**ManofOranges** (10): Pure euphoria in song form. I do think there may be something a little cheesy about having the choir come in at the end, but I also honestly think that adds to the songs greatness.

**musical\_pyn** (10): I’m a big fan of songs that sound like what the artist wants the listener to get out from the lyrics, and to me this song sounds exactly like a new beginning

**notnotamotmot** (10): Just so good.

**pebbleheights** (10): this is quirky girl music and I can’t get enough of it

**Roxieloxie** (10): I didnt even know we rated this song, I just remember me saying that I needed to submit for voting and Tk saying to vote in some other song and unwritten, and i said that i'd vote in unwritten. I actually like These Words more than this but this song is exactly the vibe I need White Woman to bring back to pop music.

**skargardin** (10): showing the other girlies how it's done

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://img-9gag-fun.9cache.com/photo/aeMLwr5_460s.jpg

**TiltControls** (10): This is sunshine in musical form. Shoutout to patene commercials!

**timothy444** (10): Just another awesome pop song where everyone can sing along to the chorus!

**twat\_brained** (10): Natasha's right I need to finish writing my class notes and to just fucking write music. Might not be great, but as she says, "the rest is still unwritten", so I should write it.

**vayyiqra** (10): It's great though I don't get why this is the one song anyone remembers from her (hot take: "Pocketful of Sunshine" is better and would be an 11)

**waluigiest** (10): This was the pinnacle of songwriting. This song is a joy every time I hear it. There’s never a bad time for Unwritten.

**rickikardashian** (9.8): i think that gaga and ariana were trying to match the mood of the chorus of this song with Rain On Me, but simply were unable to match the amazingness of **“AND FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN!!!!”**

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): an absolute anthem

**Brendon-Urine** (9): This is one of the first songs I remember ever hearing as a kid. It was on some singing/American Idol game that my sister would play all the time. The pre-chorus is legendary

**fadedblue09** (9): Serves TV commercial teas in the best way possible.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): perfect bit of pop

**izeasklapaucius** (9): I don't use Pantene but this is nice.

**seanderlust** (8.8): the genius.com comment that says this is someone's gang song is sending me

**bulforster** (8.5): My only previous context for this song was that "songs that get white people turnt" video and like.... they didn't lie

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): "FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN!" me on my Shaman casting Healing Rain even though I'm primarily Elemental and don't have good healing gear so I just spam Chain Heal and Healing Rain in a desperate attempt not to get kicked from my guild until I run out of mana and blame the DPS

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): In middle school whenever we'd take field trips to the roller rink, this is the song that all the girls and closeted gays would request

**akanewasright** (8): This is such a perfect song, but... well... she sounds horrible. Her poor vocal folds...

**igorwithlicor** (8): It's good but... the chorus at the end kinda kills it in a bad way, if it didn't have that it would be higher

**lillipup03** (8): This chorus is iconic

**nightjesus** (8): https://youtu.be/o0u9JNcGH_o

**nooodisaster** (8): Can't give this any less, it's just such a classic, and v wholesome as well.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): middle school anthem

**Vultuxe** (8): A certified classic.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): its a good song but idk if it needed to be 4 minutes!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): the way Laguna Beach’s theme song said “let the rain fall down” and The Hills theme said “feel the rain on your skin…” storytelling at its finest

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): These Words is the superior Natasha song

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): white people music can be good

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): I remember when this song was heavily used in an ad campaign by Pantene. Anyways, I like Pocketful of Sunshine better.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): The verses just aren't it. The rest is good tho

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The chorus is legendary.

**J\_Toe** (7): why doesn't Pocket Full of Sunshine work on Spotify Australia? :(

With this, we've officially said goodbye to CRJ, who lost all 3 of her songs before top 10. I definitely think the fact that Carly had multiple songs in this rate led to her downfall, since it led to more infighting among her fans. Call Me Maybe, her own mainstream hit, may be a "local" song but that doesn't negate its bop status or iconic music video. With that being said, just outside the top 10 might be the perfect spot this, as it's clearly not her best work, but it's still a classic for generations to come. 

---

## This is crazy!

**moooo566** (11): there's a lot of really, realy good songs here, but only one of them is the most important song of the millenium

**vayyiqra** (11): I once saw CRJ for free and didn't even like her at the time. (This is a perk of living in Canada.) She was doing a free concert in 2012 and I didn't know it was happening but I was out randomly walking and saw these girls carrying a handmade sign proclaiming their love for Carly (it read "marry me maybe") and I realized there was this concert going on. I didn't even like Carly at the time other than hearing "Call Me Maybe" on the radio and thinking the strings part was catchy, but since I had nothing else to do, I figured "fuck it" and went and sat on a hillside and listened to her respectfully, but wasn't super into it or anything. Now I love Carly. Thank you, tween CRJ stans.

**1998tweety** (10): gay bop

**Brendon-Urine** (10): too bad she stopped making music after this, she could have been something. right guys? right?

**endcreditouilles** (10): the best superhero origin story of all time

**fadedblue09** (10): I love this song! Wonder where the singer went. I've heard she's singing some trash called Want You In My Room now. Shame, she seems talented.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): throwback to the Anniversary Rate when Swifties accused everyone of sabotaging “All Too Well” when it in fact got (11 x 24) and only four scores below a 2, and then over half of the zeroes that “Call Me Maybe” got came from users who gave “All Too Well” an 11, and then Ariana swept the full top three anyways… popheads rate drama used to be insane

**ignitethephoenix** (10): iconic, her main pop girl moment

**ImADudeDuh** (10): thinking about how the guy that vide turned into an ugly republican trumpie https://www.tiktok.com/@thesamuelmonday/video/6919367667316985094

**J\_Toe** (10): that scene in Love, Victor is so cute

**Jackalope117** (10): Pop Perfection

**jasannn** (10): all hail our queen.

**ManofOranges** (10): My--as well as almost everyone else's--introduction to CRJ. Where would any of us be without this song? Nowhere, that's where.

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): the perfect ear worm

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): and the world was never the same again

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay i just said i dont want to think about middle school but this song is too iconic

**runaway3212** (10): my gay and pop awekening this can't not get a 10

**timothy444** (10): "Call Me Maybe" is a song that defies the limits of modern catchy pop music. Carly's vocals and the twisted but clever lyrics play perfectly off each other, in a delightful way while the strings in the instrumental just thump up this irresistible earworm into your head. It might as well be the perfect pop song of 2012!

**twat\_brained** (10): it's Carly yet for some reason this is never a contender for a win. Odd.

**akanewasright** (9.5): I was gonna give this a lower score, but then the song started again and I just couldn’t.

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This is a bop just admit it!

**TiltControls** (9.5): Definitely not the best in her discography, but honestly it's still super catchy

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): This song DOES NOT AGE

**bbfan132** (9): iconic song obviously but kind of gets tiring after a while

**bespectacIed** (9): This is camp.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): hey I just rated you, and this is crazy but here's my nine(ber) so call me maybe

**hikkaru** (9): classic, bop, etc. just wish something else was chosen from this rate tbh there's a bit of carly overkill here even if all three are bops

**lillipup03** (9): Shout out to the Cookie Monster parody, "Share It Maybe". That was my anthem in fourth grade.

**musical\_pyn** (9): Not a lot to say about this in terms of pop music, but all I’ll say is that there are very few songs my parents and I both like, and this is somehow one of them

**pebbleheights** (9): I’m so thankful to Carly Rae Jepsen for inventing pop music.

**plastichaxan** (9): serotonin song

**skargardin** (9): a moment

**SmileAndTears** (9): Stream Rina Sawayama - Bad Friend

**Vultuxe** (9): Undeniably catchy bop that started it all...

**worlds-okayest666** (9): idk like its a classic but she DOES have better...

**zagreux** (9): This will remain a perfect pop song no matter how overplayed it is, periodt.

**NFLfreak98** (8.5): Honestly? Better than I remembered. Overplay got to this one bad

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): gay rights

**AHSWeeknd** (8): It’s aged so well.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): bubblegum bop

**frogaranaman** (8): total earworm

**igorwithlicor** (8): It's incredibly catchy. It's fun, light, fresh, but doesn't go beyond that

**rslashpoopheads** (8): a solid bop but I'm sick of it!

**s4mmymusic** (8): this song got too much shit it’s genuinely good

**team\_kockroach** (8): X gon' give it to ya (what?) Fuck waiting for you to get it on your own, X gon' deliver to ya (uh)

**waluigiest** (8): can we stop rating this song

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.8): this still bops actually

**seanderlust** (7.5): remember in like 2011 when the funniest thing you could do on the internet would be to come up with some funny version of this chorus and post it on facebook dot com? good times.

**wryn\_** (7.5): So powerful it made my own father a carly stan before he had even heard run away with me

**yatcho** (7.5): not us rating this for the 45th time

**hunnybee12** (7): this didnt need to be here

**Kimchiprince** (7): GP made this song a joke and wrote you off. We remember.

**notnotamotmot** (7): Not my favorite Carly song by a long shot, but can't deny the power this song has

**Stryxen** (7): she’s such a trailblazer just inventing the concept of communication like that

cremeebrulee: ## This is tasteless!

**nightjesus** (6): This song is nearly ten years old what in the heck?

**nooodisaster** (6): Never hear this song before.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I've just heard this way too many times

**sirpancakeXI** (6): another song that have been overplayed too much, really prefer carly's other albums

**givebackmysweatshirt** (5.5): i have reached the point in my life where i have heard this song so many times that i truly never need to hear it again. the string are nice though.

**cherryices** (5): never liked this one. carly’s vocal delivery is very charming, though

**CrimsonROSET** (5): why do we keep rating this, we're just gonna drag it everytime.

**nowqueenofpop** (4): She had to have a really mediocre smash hit in order to have the great cult career and that's called BALANCE

**steelstepladder** (4): I say this every time we rate this song, if Carly released this today it would be a dissapointment

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): and i love carly, so don't play me. there are some bad and traumatic memories behind that number, and not like funny trauma.

**joshually** (1): I walked the gay pride parade when this song came out and the float I was with basically played this song on repeat for the 3 hours we were walking/dancing along the route, and it was actual hell

**MrSwearword** (1): still made of HELL NO

As the tail end of the top 10, we say our first goodbye to Ms. Janet who is legendary enough to have TWO songs here when most people couldn't even make Day 3. This was my original 11 in the 80s Ladies Rate because its so high energy and fun to watch. Unfortunately, this song manages to make its departure here as it seems to not be as iconic as the Rhythm Nation title track. ~~We are /r/popheads and not rockheads after all.~~ 

---

## Can appreciate rock music

**mysario** (11): as a constant loser, I see like 10 of my 11s in this rate - so instead of picking one of those, I'm going with the one I SHOULD have given it to had I done this intense rate! absolutely deserves!

**runaway3212** (11): This is so incredible and I still regret not giving it my 11 in the original rate

**akanewasright** (10): Bop

**bespectacIed** (10): So good

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I don’t really have a comment for this one, so count me as just laughing at Dude when this ends up coming like #14 because popheads doesn’t have taste

**ignitethephoenix** (10): will sadly be robbed

**ImADudeDuh** (10): IMAGINE BEING THIS ICONIC HOLY FUCKING SHIT ANFVKADNFVKDV PLEASE

**ManofOranges** (10): This was the standout discovery to me from this song's rate. Many of the songs from this songs rate I'd heard before, but somehow Black Cat eluded me. But I'm never going to let it do that again. This song is a treasure. I know this sub might do it dirty simply because it's pretty much a rock song, but I sure hope not because not many songs, if any, can provide me the same excitement and badassery that I get when I listen to this.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): when this flops...

**nightjesus** (10): I fully understand why Miley is obsessed with this music. My ego and confidence went through the roof from that panther growl.

**nootnoot781** (10): that chorus, what the fuck is it laced with?

**ReallyCreative** (10): Janet really put herself in a class of her own with this one, talent at its best

**seanderlust** (10): there's no way this wins, but this is absolutely one of the coolest songs i've ever heard in my entire life so i'm really rooting for it. also want to note that this literally only lost my 11 because of a coin toss

**skargardin** (10): NOT AFRAID TO DIE-I-IE .... GUITAR!!!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): shout out to when i played this song in band hero when i was 10 and thought it was genuinely about a black cat

**team\_kockroach** (10): I love Janet so much

**timothy444** (10): Hot take: better than Rhythm Nation

**twat\_brained** (10): great but I can't shake the feeling this is just a Michael reject

**worlds-okayest666** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjk2TGjXjeM

**bookthieving** (9.5): a banger!!!!!!!!!!

**bulforster** (9.5): Best rock song in the rate.

**1998tweety** (9): serviana

**bbfan132** (9): queen of glam metal (wish i liked it a bit more but still)

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): she had the rock girls quaking with this one

**jsonphile** (9): okay this guitar solo fucks. Also of course Janet kills it

**lillipup03** (9): The drumbeat brings everything together so well on this one.

**musical\_pyn** (9): I really need more of this energy in my life

**nowqueenofpop** (9): When pop meets hard rock it's never NOT good

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): Okay this fucks i cant deny it.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Nice. Makes me want to go all Selina Kyle and have Janet berate me.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): this guitar is filthy

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The entire album does the 80s sound such justice.

**FKJVMMP** (8): God I miss pop guitar solos.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): step on my fucking neck but slightly less forceful as rhythm nation

**SmileAndTears** (8): I feel like this song needed someone with a stronger voice but it's still really good

**Stryxen** (8): Black cat’s back alright!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I applaud her versatility but if I were choosing an All Star from this rate, it wouldn’t be this

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): will r/popheads accept rock influences if they're done by a popstar?

**Vultuxe** (7.5): It's outside of my taste but it's not bad.

Now what is this hunny ... I can't believe not only did Donna get into this rate barely (literally through payola) but yall put her even lower than the last rate she was in. This robbery was furious to watch and no doubt will be one of the more upsetting eliminations today. Sure, some of you might think this isn't Donna's best song but can you really deny how incredible that buildup is? You guys fucked up here for real. 

---

## I need you, by me...

**akanewasright** (11): God, I fucking love Donna Summer. This isn’t my favorite song of hers, but Donna deserves an 11 regardless.

**CrimsonROSET** (11): There really was no alternative. This is just infectious, it IS the moment. This is disco.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is the best song that was ever made.

**notnotamotmot** (11): Just pure, unadulterated fun. I love that disco seems to be having a bit of a revival because there is nothing that I'd rather listen to on a night out. This song playing to a club full of shirtless, sweaty men is always always always is good time.

**1998tweety** (10): CLASSIC

**AHSWeeknd** (10): my fave Donna Summer song.

**anothertown** (10): Ariana kind of bodied this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=115EsNrEqWw

**Awkward\_King** (10): this really easily could be my 11 it's just the perfect disco song, although i do think i slightly prefer the flow of the single version

**bbfan132** (10): so so happy this was voted in, what a classic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the live version on Live and More is one of the greatest performances of all time

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I think this is the only song in the rate that I gave my 11 too in the original rate (except “Damn Daniel” but I honestly kinda regret that) but unfortunately something else snatched it this time around. I still think this is one of the best songs ever though and once again I WILL be beaming it into space when humanity is destroyed so be on the lookout for that~

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): This song is a masterpiece methinks

**jsonphile** (10): hot stuff is her best song but this is also a perfect song

**letsallpoo** (10): really glad we get to see her lose her fourth rate

**ManofOranges** (10): Lost of things hurt in the Disco Rate. Namely, the fact that Donna didn't absolutely dominate like she should have. I Feel Love at #10, Macarthur Park and Love to Love You Baby going out too soon, Donna not getting a song in the top 3, I could go on. But what hurt most of all was this song going out at #6. If any song was ever winner material, it's this song right here. The combination of desperation and enjoyment you feel as you just look for that one last dance and you get it. This is my favorite Donna Summer song, my favorite disco song, and another one of my most-listened-to songs of all time, and it deserves the best in every regard.

**musical\_pyn** (10): Just a perfect song with a perfect build

**nowqueenofpop** (10): The overwhelming power of this song, she will forever and always be THE standard

**plastichaxan** (10): she was so ahead of everyone

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): a musical warm blanket

**ReallyCreative** (10): What happened to Donna Summer in the Disco rate was violent, unnecessary, and showed how truly depraved, tasteless, and talentless popheads really are. The worst part about it? They get another opportunity to do even worse.

**rickikardashian** (10): this better not go out in day 1/2…. not on black history month

**runaway3212** (10): donna summer is a queen

**sirpancakeXI** (10): A DISCO CLASSIC

**skargardin** (10): donna's 70s work is immaculate .. noitstrue

**TiltControls** (10): I'm so glad this was the Donna song selected. The slow build-up is the perfect way to start the song, the chorus shows off Donna's emotional connection to the lyrics, the beat itself is fantastic! Everything about the song is so good!

**twat\_brained** (10): I take it this Donna Summer. broad is a bit charismatic at this whole disco thing huh

**waluigiest** (10): Donna Summer deserved to sweep that whole rate. Last Dance is just one of several perfect songs in her repertoire

**givebackmysweatshirt** (9.5): donna i am so sorry in advance on behalf of these bitter gays

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): A CLASSIC

**igorwithlicor** (9): Ngl, kinda love it a bit

**nooodisaster** (9): Euphoric euphoria.

**steelstepladder** (9): Fooooor loooooooooooooove

**Stryxen** (9): Hope this is the Last Song we hear in the reveal

**Vultuxe** (9): Bop bop bop.

**seanderlust** (8.7): i underrated this one last time by a solid half point or so. it's a FULL bop. donna summer is the queen of disco for a reason - she put out quality hit after quality hit in this period.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): I remember being introduced to this when I randomly threw on the movie it was from and I’m glad it was there because otherwise that movie had NOTHING going on (except a random young Jeff Goldblum)

**endcreditouilles** (8): the most classic of classic classics

**frogaranaman** (8): Donna good

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I wish it was a different Donna song but this is good

**rslashpoopheads** (8): it's no MacArthur Park but it'll do

**SmileAndTears** (8): The production is weirdly too busy I feel like? Idk overall I like it but sometimes it felt like too much was going on

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): This is one of the better Donna singles, but Bad Girls still superior

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): Love the strings and brass. “Let’s Dance” and “Last Dance” sound way too similar, though - and that first minute was a slog

What a song to watch. Hailed as a clear frontrunner in this rate, ...BOMT is one of 4 songs to ever hit 1st place (the only other one we know of is Gee). No doubt a classic and one of Britney's best songs, this top 10 placement makes perfect sense. Alas, some people find this song overrated which is why it ended up falling from its win. Did you think this would be gone before top 5?

---

## I must confess I still believe 

**Kimchiprince** (11): FREE BRITNEY

**letsallpoo** (11): https://gfycat.com/EnchantingSpectacularBengaltiger

**moonagenightmares** (11): best song of all time

**teenage\_meme** (11): this rate had a lot of potential 11s, and it was difficult to narrow it down, but for me, at the end of the day it's always gonna be britney. in my opinion, this is the perfect pop song. absolute peak performance. when it comes to pure pop, few songs even come close. britney and max did what they had to do, and they cemented their place in history, and i am forever grateful to them for this glowing gift.

**twat\_brained** (11): I'd like to use mine on Roxieloxie please also WATCH FRAMING BRITNEY SPEARS. I DEMAND IT.

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**anothertown** (10): britney discography 1999-2007 is like my family

**bbfan132** (10): THIS was her debut single, think about that

**Brendon-Urine** (10): i hear those piano hits and lose control of my mind and body

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): FREE BRITNEY

**frogaranaman** (10): gives song a perfect score this better not win

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic invented pop music

**LuisEnRod** (10): (my only regret in life is not being old enough to see this song blow up in real time)

**ManofOranges** (10): This is a great song, what can I say.

**notnotamotmot** (10): This song really set the tone for the next decade of music. Thank you, Brit!

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I completely love the "AAAAND I" parts every time they come on

**nowqueenofpop** (10): What else is there to say, really

**pebbleheights** (10): My entire body moves along with this song, there is nothing I can physically do to control it.

**ReallyCreative** (10): my go-vern-ment, is killing me

**rickikardashian** (10): fuck you roxie this is a masterpiece

**runaway3212** (10): 'my lonliness is cilling me is the quarantine mood'

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): FREE BRITNEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! ok there's my activism for the day

**Twerkus** (10): It was hard to pick between this and everytime we touch

**worlds-okayest666** (10): my lower back is killing me...i must confess...so are my knees...

**wryn\_** (10): Ed Sheeran snapped on this one!

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): I know this phrase got overused but this song was quite literally a cultural reset

**nightjesus** (9.5): I remember the first time I saw the video clip to this song when I was a child. I was so captured by Britney’s style and dances and her singing. She needs to be freed.

**igorwithlicor** (9): It still holds up imo, it was a cultural reset for a good reason

**musical\_pyn** (9): One of the most iconic pop songs simply ever

**skargardin** (9): when we yet again get outraged over how many well-deserving songs this places above, omg!!

**SmileAndTears** (9): A classic

**TiltControls** (9): Iconique. Much, much better than Oops will ever be!

**timothy444** (9): It's so surreal how this song is over 20 years old now! Still a bop though

**vayyiqra** (9): I never liked this song that much at the time but it sure is iconic and every Pophead has to respect it

**waluigiest** (9): I was a young child when this was released but u knew it was important

**seanderlust** (8.6): would love to know when I started singing "oh biden, biden" and would love to climb down from the neolib peak i've hit. anyways, great song.

**Vultuxe** (8.5): It's pretty good, not crazy good though.

**cherryices** (8.1): i still believe!!

**AHSWeeknd** (8): too iconic.

**bespectacIed** (8): one of the very few times that the description "cultural reset" is accurate

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I think I actually lowballed this when I did my first pass on the scores, upon a relisten I can’t deny that this is a fun song. It’s not my favorite Britney track and I’m not even sure it’s Top 10 but it’s a damn good piece of pop music that had waves in the music industry, plus I like it.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): a classic

**s4mmymusic** (8): classic

**TragicKingdom1** (8): this is like the only bad possible winner in the rate, and its also the frontrunner :|

**yatcho** (8): All time iconic debut single but it shouldnt win so i might be underrating slightly

**jsonphile** (7.5): there may come a day when we stop putting Britney songs in the top five every time but I fear it won’t be this time.

**Stryxen** (7.5): I enjoy this song plenty but it feels way longer than it actually is

**CrimsonROSET** (7): #FreeBritney

**delicately-fearless** (7): I love Britney but this is one of her worst

**RandomHypnotica** (7): popheads stop overrating Britney challenge

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): Britney Spears' debut single is a prime example of just because something is iconic, doesn't mean it has to be great as well. I pre-chorus builds up a good amount of swell and the vocal melodies on the chorus are pop perfection but the vocal production on Britney has always rubbed me the wrong way

**sirpancakeXI** (6): I have never been a big fan of this song

**lillipup03** (5): I'm super grateful for Britney's impact on pop and really like some of her songs where she doesn't do this thing with her voice, but the nasally sound is just grating to me...

**static\_int\_husp** (5): Really wish this hadn't ended up in all stars. I'm not anti-Britney, but she's way over-represented here

And so we part with another Disco Rate song. Chaka did SO well for herself here and honestly, good for her. I didn't think this song would do this extraordinarily well but we all agree that this is a pretty amazing song. Still, none of were super committed to it so I think it's fair to let this go here.

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**anothertown** (10): this IS THE song

**bbfan132** (10): classic!!!!!!!!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): Maybe she made some points.

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Imagine this being your debut solo single... Chaka Khan doesn't have to

There's lots of talk about dark horse contenders here and not enough mention of this song. Super Bass was objectively the third best performing song here, only ever reaching a low of #22. Which makes sense, given how energetic and carefree this song is. Most of us would love for Nicki to return to this sound. Let's be real, if you don't know all the words to this song, what are you even doing here? Still, Onika is a quite controversial figure these days so there was no way for this to do any better than right here, which I think is a fair placement.

## Boy you got my heartbeat running away...

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): I grappled with whether to give this song my 11 because Nicki’s behavior over the past few years has made me #notafan big time, but this song holds such a special place in my heart I knew I had to do it. I found this song a little bit after I joined the sub because there was a thread about songs with fun instrumentals and someone mentioned how bright and girlish this song was and mentioned the “digital raindrops” and I was like “huh” so I listened to the instrumental and that was really the gateway for me to get more into pop music because it taught me to appreciate the artistry and power of even the most seemingly silly songs. I don’t throw around the phrase “pop perfection” a lot but I really think this is it. It’s catchy, relatable, easy to remember/sing along to, and while it doesn’t take itself too seriously there’s also genuine heart in it that grounds it. This song has brought such joy to the world, every girl and gay of a certain age just somehow magically knows all the words and will lose their minds when it comes on. This one may be for the boys with the booming systems, but it’s also for us.

**1998tweety** (10): smasha

**akanewasright** (10): Yes I am gay, how could you tell?

**anothertown** (10): the best song of 2011 coming through..

**bbfan132** (10): still have it memorized 10 years later

**bespectacIed** (10): This song is engraved on my wrinkle free barb brain

**Brendon-Urine** (10): if you can't rap the first verse I don't acknowledge your existence.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Wait, it's NOT superb ass?

**DaHumanTorch** (10): Nicki antis gonna tank this one even though it’s a classic and deserves top 10

**endcreditouilles** (10): chuck them deuces up ladies

**hikkaru** (10): iconic, we need to rate pink friday at some point

**ignitethephoenix** (10): top 3 Nicki song and if it’s not for you, you may be tasteless

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i will always drag nicki’s terrible “friends” and how she weaponizes the barbz to give 6ix9ine hits but wow she snapped on this.

**J\_Toe** (10): omg I love Ester Dean

**Kimchiprince** (10): cultural reset is played out but it really was

**ManofOranges** (10): We all know it already but it bears repeating that the opening verse is perhaps one of the greatest openings to a song of all time. Shit, even the opening barrage of sound from the song is iconic seeing how it is instantly recognizable. While it's maybe not Nicki's best song ever, it's the song that best sums up Nicki--loud, sometimes on the verge of abrasive, but immensely captivating.

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**nooodisaster** (10): Still one of my fav Nicki songs ever; insanely fun, was an actual cultural reset, and features the talents of Ester Dean what else could you want?

**notnotamotmot** (10): Possibly Nicki's best song?

**nowqueenofpop** (10): the barb sleeper cell activates in everyone age 18-30 when this comes on

**rickikardashian** (10): probably one of the funnest memories from the plug was seeing everyone root for this to win over blank space and bad romance

**runaway3212** (10): cremee play superlove by tinashe after this in the plug challenge

**s4mmymusic** (10): yasss grenade

**skargardin** (10): if you don't know every word to this then kindly leave

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): sorry to the barbz but nicki will never make another song as good as this again

**twat\_brained** (10): I'll pretend it's Sue Sylvester's version even though she's a R*publican

**vayyiqra** (10): Anyone who can rap this whole song has my undying respect

**Vultuxe** (10): This song AWAKENED my pophead senses. My 13 year old gay ass was never the same.

**wryn\_** (10): I'd excuse all of nicki's antics if she ever released a song this good again

**yatcho** (10): barb sleeper cell activator

**jackisboredtoday** (9.7): it’s me, i’m the boys with the boomin system top down A/C with the cooling system

**givebackmysweatshirt** (9.5): i have a hard time separating this song from the racist yt girls who sang this on my bus. still a bop idc.

**leira\_s** (9.5): all of the lyrics live rent free in my mind

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Serotonin

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): I think this is literally the first time I ever heard the bridge on this lol

**bookthieving** (9): this instrumental is bubblegum pop perfection

**izeasklapaucius** (9): minus one point because she bamboozled me into thinking that she sang on the chorus, not Esmee Denters (i just know about it recently)

**LuisEnRod** (9): (my biggest accomplishment at 14 years old was singing along to the first verse)

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): banger

**NotWith10000Men** (9): good lord this slaps even though I had to hit "allow to play this"

**waluigiest** (9): sue sylvester ate

**Stryxen** (8.5): I’m always surprised by how quickly this song ends but honestly it would probably get annoying if it lasted any longer

**Awkward\_King** (8): im one of the boys with a boomer system this is representation

**igorwithlicor** (8): Nicki is really good. And this song is really fun

**jsonphile** (8): hey in the reveal you should torture everyone with the glee version which might actually be one of the worst glee covers ever

**musical\_pyn** (8): Popstar Nicki is my favorite Nicki

**mynameistoo\_common** (8): the fact that Taylor is at least partially responsible for this song blowing up is hilarious

**rslashpoopheads** (8): a solid bop but I'm sick of it!

**plastichaxan** (7.8): i wish nicki was this fun again

**cherryices** (7.7): ester dean did that

**nightjesus** (7.5): Can still rap this with no problems.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): better than Starships

**steelstepladder** (7.5): The Say So of 2011

**TiltControls** (7.5): I actually really like pop Nicki. Not as strong as Starships, but still pretty good

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): i think its funny how we collectively ignore that nicki pulls a JLo with the chorus vocals

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): This was the first Nicki song I heard and it was over at my neighboors house and at the time I dont think my parents liked Nicki very much so It's not that I couldn't listen to her but you know. the song itself is good but it brings up too many awk memories of middle school that i dont want think about

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): i've never loved this but it's fun

**seanderlust** (7.1): it's fun! but like...that's all I have to say about it

cremeebrulee: ## Somebody please tell him who the eff I is

**brenda\_official** (7): verses are classic obviously but the chorus is so annoying sorry

**flavasavavandal** (7): Nicki had the potential to be a top 10 rapper of the decade (mainstream and underground) and just chose to spend the 2010’s making just some of her singles very good

**frogaranaman** (7): this song is good, I just hate seeing white twinks happy

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Because it’s not even Nicki’s best song.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): back then we had no idea what was waiting for us wow

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): barbs don't fucking come for me, i have three dollars to my name and i'm barely employed. but we will remember this song the same way some people remember my heart will go on.

**timothy444** (3): Maybe it's irrational and something to do with my childhood but there's something about this song that annoys the hell out of me.

**NFLfreak98** (2.5): thanks Nikki

Again I must ask, what is THIS hunny.... Rhythm Nation is another song expected to do well in this rate. And why wouldn't it? It's an incredible, insane, and iconic song that makes me want to overthrow my government and establish Janet as our leader. This song was our second best performing, never dipping below #21 and reaching as high as #2. Yet, it could never reach the coveted first place spot. It's an actual shame that this song hasn't won a rate yet, but when Redemption Rate 2 happens we better be voting this shit in.

## WE ARE A PART OF A RHYTHM NATION!!!

**kappyko** (11): janet jackson kick me in the teeth

**ReallyCreative** (11): Literally one of the best songs ever made, I genuinely don't know what more you can ask from a song.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): An explosive, meaningful banger that holds up to this day. The way she mixed industrial and new jack swing... her mind!!

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this rate is making me choose between two of my top 10 songs of all time AND I HATE IT!!! (the other song is smells like teen spirit)

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): WE ARE A PART OF THR RHYTHM NATION https://imgur.com/a/UuIlWz5

**Awkward\_King** (10): WIN

**bbfan132** (10): such a good intro to the album and an iconic song in general

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic. A worthy and obvious runner up but IWDWS(WLM) winning the rate was set in stone

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Maybe the greatest MV of all time? And a perfect song too? Lives up to the title so well.

**bulforster** (10): This got the highest score in its first rate of the songs here for a reason!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): some of the sickest percussion tbh we need a full new jack swing revival and not just bruno trying it for an album

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Relevant!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): How did Whitney beat this, I'm still flabbergasted...

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): step on my fucking neck

**ignitethephoenix** (10): literally iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOO

**jsonphile** (10): when is Biden declaring this as our national anthem

**ManofOranges** (10): Even though, at the end of the day, winning a rate doesn't mean anything, I kind of feel bad for Janet because this Rhythm Nation is great, this song is great, and if it weren't up against the absolute masterpiece that is I Wanna Dance With Somebody, this would've deservedly won. Maybe in this rate it could get a little redemption. I certainly wouldn't mind.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): talented brilliant incredible amazing show-stopping etc

**rickikardashian** (10): this is her black cat

**runaway3212** (10): Not as great as black cat but still very great

**sirpancakeXI** (10): She really delivered

**skargardin** (10): I would not be mad at this CLASSIC winning

**teenage\_meme** (10): this song has THE BEST production. i NEED new jack swing to come back. nobody does it better than janet, tho. an iconic, inimitable banger

**twat\_brained** (10): given the recent focus on posters whose careers were torn to shreds by the media, let's all remind ourselves why this woman is a legend independent of her family name.

**yatcho** (10): I've come to really love this song so much ever since hosting this rate. Janet deserves her flowers around here!!!

**pat-rickstar** (9.8): Spilled water over myself listening to this, Janet this is your fault

**nooodisaster** (9.5): A classic that you can just tell is a classic within an instant.

**Stryxen** (9.5): OH YEAH

**anothertown** (9): when Finesse outperforms Janet in the rate 🔪

**frogaranaman** (9): truly an iconic song

**musical\_pyn** (9): I absolutely love this industrial type of pop and Janet kills it as always

**timothy444** (9): dat breakdown tho in the bridge :fire:

**Vultuxe** (9): I enjoyed this one immensely.

**wryn\_** (9): The first two minutes of this are literal perfection but the rest doesn't keep up the energy imo. But if it was shorter, easy 11

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): Is he... y'know... a part of Rhythm Nation?

**akanewasright** (8.5): Iconic

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): what a vibe. Love the scream in the background

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): the production on this is just chef's kiss

**igorwithlicor** (8): It's good and boppy

**nightjesus** (8): I haven’t listened to much Janet Jackson in my life but damn this could very much be a Michael song but I’m glad it’s not. This is so good!

**vayyiqra** (8): based

**waluigiest** (8): I do really love that classic late 80s soundscape

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I get that it's iconic, but some of the lyrics could've used more work. This is hardly any deeper than 'Chained to the Rhythm'.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): I like the themes of the song, but the song itself doesn't really do anything for me, other than make me question it's length

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): bop!

**lillipup03** (7): This sounds like it should be in a generic 80s high school TV show... I'm not saying that's a bad thing, though.

That long climb to the top is entirely my fault guys, sorry ~~I just really hate this song.~~ Anyway, Like A Prayer is another song I heard little discussion about yet it was always doing quite well! Did people just underestimate how well Madonna would do in a rate like this? This song is definitely the highlight from this album and its music video is one for the history books. Alas, it couldn't do any better than #4 since the three songs above it just happen to have more fans. I would still count this a win for Madge fans since she manages to outlast Janet here, which is something she didn't do in her original rate. 

---

**LuisEnRod** (11): (I could be ANYWHERE, and I hear “life is a mystery” come on and I s2g I will drop everything I’m doing and give you a one-woman show)

**1998tweety** (10): one of the best and most iconic songs ever made

**bbfan132** (10): i feel like this song is one of the main reasons as to why the album is held in such high regard and it makes sense - this song is an excellent intro to the album and the video is iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): Madge's greatest song

**camerinian** (10): Event pop music will always be my shit, and this might be one of the greatest pop events ever created just for the sheer fact that it leans into its massive blasphemous scale 100% and makes every huge choice pay off to obscene effect. It is a high point for all of pop as a phenomenon

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): queen of blasphemy

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The 12" dance mix is an absolute serve.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): what can even be said about this song that hasn't already been said. it's a perfect song and it is peak madonna. no one else could've pulled this off.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i can see this being a sleeper winner

**jsonphile** (10): Madonna’s best song no I will not hear any other opinions

**ManofOranges** (10): That killer guitar opening played by Prince is the perfect way to set to the tone for the rest of the song and let the listener know exactly what they're about to get. Pure greatness. I wouldn't change a thing about this song, for better or for worse, because in all of glory and allusions to blow jobs, it's a delight to listen to.

**nbapip** (10): an 11 in any other rate

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this song is so good that I was listening to it nonstop in a bad time of my life and I still love it

**pat-rickstar** (10): Another 11 contender for me

**plastichaxan** (10): sometimes i forget madonna’s power and it’s nice to be reminded of it

**sirpancakeXI** (10): a cute bop

**steelstepladder** (10): Another possible 11 contender

**TiltControls** (10): There's a certain bombast to this song that makes it work so well. It's hard not to sing along anytime it comes on

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i demand that another pop girlie burns crosses in her next lead single's music video

**twat\_brained** (10): this is quite literally Madonna's magnum opus. And it pissed off an entire soda conglomerate which earned her a $5,000,000 paycheck. Say what you will about her, Madonna is a very clever woman for which she can never be discredited. No, wait, stOP DON'T CHECK HER INST-

**vayyiqra** (10): My thoughts on this song are too complex to sum up here so see here for more detail: https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/jurcio/80s_rate_reveal_day_3_dont_go_for_second_best/gcffmx8?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3

**Vultuxe** (10): Oh what I would give to be alive and gay when Madonna was at her prime.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): wikipedia saying this is about loving god...idk about that girl!

**cherryices** (9.8): took me there!

**ChandelierFlickering** (9.7): classic

**Brendon-Urine** (9.5): the way she sings "heaven help me" so painfully... gets me every time. and the choir? ugh. her best song imo.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): One of Madonna’s most memorable songs.

**akanewasright** (9): I fucking love this song

**frogaranaman** (9): religious queen

**igorwithlicor** (9): Not the best Madonna ballady song, but it's fantastic

**musical\_pyn** (9): Great chorus, great structure, just a great moment in pop music

**nightjesus** (9): I mean it’s a classic.

**ReallyCreative** (9): Take Me To Church couldn't

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The definition of extra. Iconic tho.

**seanderlust** (8.5): the background choir is transcendent

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): This song needed a better vocalist. The final chorus just doesn't hit as hard as it should cuz Madonna's voice is too weak and her vocals throughout the song are pretty meh

**pebbleheights** (8): Madonna took me there. The choir also took me there.

**Stryxen** (8): this does NOT need to go so hard

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): I easily prefer the Shep Pettibone versions from the Immaculate Collection, but this song is still good either way

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): is this the prequel to take me to church

**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): The original modern pop queen of controversy

=====

cremeebrulee: **rslashpoopheads** (7.5): madonna overrated!

**anothertown** (7): definitely i thought it was fun, i liked the beat..

**fadedblue09** (7): Like I said before, the chorus is monumental but the rest is really boring.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): good but overrated, and I don’t think it’s aged as well as everyone seems to think

**waluigiest** (7): it’s fun but I’ve never been that jazzed over it

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): She's not a very good singer, and this composition isn't pretty muddled...

**wryn\_** (6.5): The two sections that this song switches between have just never made sense to me together, I can never get fully into one

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): Most of Madonna's singles to me are nice but I don't really care what happens to them in a rate. This one is no different

**astrologicalangel** (5.5): I wish I liked this song. Or the album.

**s4mmymusic** (5): would be higher if it weren’t so fucking long

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.6): yup this song is still bad

**lillipup03** (4): Like A Virgin is twice as good. Literally... I would've given it an eight.

**runaway3212** (4): I liked it at first, but it has really shrunk on me now that I've listened to radio more, maybe someday I'll like it again

**timothy444** (4): Overrated just like her career

**Roxieloxie** (3): maybe one day we will rate madona/cher/some other old white woman and i will enjoy it

**kappyko** (2): im rlly sorry but i STILL dont get this after so long

Oh, this hurts :( I don't know who put a hex on Florence that stops her from losing every rate she's in, but it's so undeserved! Especially with this song, it's so uplifting and beautiful. I think a lot of us can agree that this song can take us out of a dark place because that's how powerful the lyrics and buildup is. But even with the huge amount of 11s this song got, Florence is once again the bridesmaid, but not the bride. 

---
## The dawn

**endcreditouilles** (11): Florence giving us EVERYTHING. I'm convinced she trapped someone's soul in song form, pure witchy pop perfection.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): this is my eleven and my reasoning is pretty obvious. Besides it being a bop and a tune, it's such a comforting song. Florence really said to get it together and go on with your life, and I think that's so important. Ok, wait, gotta add that dancing to this in your room all by yourself is so healing and freeing, ok done.

**NFLfreak98** (11): If your 11 is supposed to go to the song that makes you feel the best, then this was the easiest choice in the world

**nooodisaster** (11): Okay so umm the guy who appears at exactly 0:45 of the music video literally was my crush for a solid 12 months when I was a kid.... I was a deeply lonely gay. (but yea this is prob my favorite florence song, it's literally perfect from lyrics to production to the mv)

**pebbleheights** (11): I don’t think I ever had any question about which song would get my 11.

**worlds-okayest666** (11): so fucking stunning and powerful. a strong contender for my favorite song of all time. im very bad at putting my love for songs into words but it’s just so damn good!! still just as amazing as it was in 2011

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**akanewasright** (10): I might get threatened if I don’t give this a 10. Good thing I like the song a lot.

**bbfan132** (10): my favorite song in 2012… still love it

**bespectacIed** (10): A masterpiece. Modern day lovesickness but make it renaissance era. One of my favorite songs ever

**bookthieving** (10): the way this song BUILDS!!!!!!! it takes you on a whole fucking journey

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): hearing this live was one of the most cathartic experiences of my life

**CrimsonROSET** (10): florence and the machine might be the artist we’ve done the dirtiest in rates and i just KNOW this won’t be the rate to fix it but fuck y’all

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): https://twitter.com/osirispod/status/1358200343599996933

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): A classic, not debatable, not in front of me.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): absolutely love this song. My favorite from her

**igorwithlicor** (10): Etheral voice. Amazing

**jackisboredtoday** (10): monumental

**jsonphile** (10): you ever have a song that you remember being pretty good, but you haven’t heard in years, and then when you listen to it again, it’s actually far better than you remember it being? Yeah that’s me with this song. It’s such an incredibly beautiful, powerful song.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is just powerful. I just get lost in the feeling of this song. The idea of just shaking off the devil on your back can seem impossible, but when you listen to this song it's easy as pie.

**musical\_pyn** (10): I have to be in the right mood to listen to this song, but when I am, I get completely lost in everything about it. Just absolute catharsis

**NotWith10000Men** (10): one of my favorite intros ever

**pat-rickstar** (10): The chorus is so anthemic, I would love to see this live. I remember seeing her Glastonbury set on TV and this song went off

**ReallyCreative** (10): Excited for Florence to add to her silver medal collection

**runaway3212** (10): I once heard a cover of this that was so bad I ignored the song for so long, I only started relistening after I binged HIMYM and this was used in a season finale and I still can't believe how dirty that person covering did it.

**seanderlust** (10): absolute CHILLS. florence welch is legitimately one of the greatest lyricists alive.

**Stryxen** (10): I've never not stanned this woman (I’m british so we’re basically related) but there’s better songs here. sorry mum

**team\_kockroach** (10): Once upon a time I thought Imagine Dragons made the best pop rock music

**TiltControls** (10): Everything about this song is perfection. It's the best song that has, and probably will ever, come out of Florence. And I don't mean that as a bad thing. It's just that this song is so damn fantastic! Very, very close to stealing my 11

**twat\_brained** (10): "gingers have no soul" right okay so explain this phaguette. This is legitimately one of Florence's greatest musical triumphs and I LOVE the videos' aesthetic and color palette. This is my personal non-Cascada/Britney win pick

**vayyiqra** (10): The only word for this is "anthemic"

**zagreux** (10): This song is THAT bitch. So. Fucking. Cathartic. It's a song you can scream along to after a mental breakdown, and it manages to pull me out of a rough spot every time.

**yatcho** (9.5): most joyful song of all time? maybe so

**slimboyfriend** (9.1): This is one of those songs that you think is pretty good, and then you listen to it and realize that it's actually amazing

**ImADudeDuh** (9): percht for this to get 2nd place

**waluigiest** (9): I truly loved living in the age of all of her big singles

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): euphoric

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): The lyrics of this one are so raw and powerful, Florence has had a good career but I really wish that this had given her the momentum to go fully mainstream.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I've always been more of a fan of Florence's more subdued, lowkey songs, but I can't help but feel the power of this song

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The vocals, the production, the lyrics. Florence’s music is next level.

**bulforster** (8): The song that got me into Florence, so I still love it, but it's far from her most dynamic.

**frogaranaman** (8): my local radio station plays this a lot for some reason

**s4mmymusic** (8): i am not a florence stan but i know a collapse when i hear one

**letsallpoo** (7): when will we just rate ceremonials

**nowqueenofpop** (7): I appreciate whoever said Florence and the Machine us healing in musical form

**Vultuxe** (7): Florence's songs always blend together to me but it is not a bad song.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): I think this just isn't for me

**nightjesus** (5): there is only one song I like by Florence and the Machine and this isn’t it. (It’s What the Water Gave Me ugh yes what a damn haunting song).

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): i don't like this song, don't judge me.

**Roxieloxie** (3.7): It sounds really nice however it is just absolutely too slow for me im sorry. Is this my balladphobia? perhaps?

Congratulations to our runner up! After a whole rate full of disrespecting men, I'm not sure if this is a continuation of that or a redemption from that. What I do know is this song is one of the most perfect ones to ever exist and many of you seem to agree! This song was our first winner (tied with Gee when there were two ballots) but fell pretty badly after. But with each incoming ballot, it just kept going up and up. Honestly the best part of ballot collecting was cheering this song on, until it finally arrived as this deserved 2nd place spot. I would love if this could've won, but considering our strong top 2 I'm still pretty happy :')

**flavasavavandal** (10): There are a few songs on I Am that have this beat as the best EWF song, but this might be there most well put together song, every element just slots in so perfectly and gives off such a warm optimistic vibe that EWF do oh so well

**frogaranaman** (10): I do not remember! I was drunk

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Stream Gloria Bell wherever you get your movies!

**hunnybee12** (10): who doesn't like this song

**igorwithlicor** (10): Boppy! And a classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the absolute smasha, i wouldn’t be surprised if it won, but when white men go “what are some perfect songs?” can this stop being the only song by POCs they name?

**J\_Toe** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTkti85HEqQ

**jsonphile** (10): so this is a perfect song and I will hear no word otherwise

**lillipup03** (10): I don't think I could ever get tired of this song. Just the pure bliss and happiness through the entire song... it's infectious.

**ManofOranges** (10): I would've liked to have seen this song win the Disco Rate if Donna Summer wasn't going to win. It's just so emblematic of the happiness and dance-the-night-away attitude that you might think of when you think of disco. There's not a thing wrong with this song, and I honestly wouldn't surprised to see it snatch the top spot in this rate.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): so true

**musical\_pyn** (10): I don’t know what else I could say about this song other than there’s a reason it’s still a song everyone knows

**notnotamotmot** (10): Oh so good. This song has everything. Catchy beat, fun to sing lyrics, not too overly peppy. Just very very good.

**nowqueenofpop** (10): God this song feels like the sun hitting your face on a warm day it's so much fun. Deserved to go #1

**rickikardashian** (10): happy birthday akane

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song was absolutely robbed from winning and in another universe it did and we deserved that universe

**seanderlust** (10): well? DO you remember?

**skargardin** (10): classic

**slimboyfriend** (10): Pure joy

**steelstepladder** (10): This deserved to win the disco rate every day of the week

**timothy444** (10): There are only a select group of songs that truly never age. This is one of them.

**Vultuxe** (10): I can't believe how fresh this sounds even though it was so long ago.

**waluigiest** (10): what a joyous, joyous song

**worlds-okayest666** (10): if the infamous taylor cover isn’t the shitpost for this i will fume a little

**Stryxen** (9.8): :)

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Hell yeah! Wooooooooooooooooo!!! Play it again!

**TiltControls** (9.5): A classic!

**1998tweety** (9): Taylor outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Timeless excellence.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): legendary

**CrimsonROSET** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zzEDrYTkkg

**endcreditouilles** (9): still my favorite song edit memes ever

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): DO YOU REMEMBER

**nightjesus** (9): I dare you to try and sit still during this song. I dare you to try and not get happy and sing along. You can’t. It’s physically impossible.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): "I thought it had all the build of a one-story motel. But, I mean, the girl didn't kill anybody. She didn't run over your foot. She just cut a very calm and somewhat boring take of one of the peppiest, happiest, most popular songs in history."

**rslashpoopheads** (9): a classic

**sirpancakeXI** (9): I would've never listen to this song if it wasn't for this rate, this is better than i expected

**twat\_brained** (9): PARTY UP!!

**anothertown** (8.5): taylor swift cover of this song is not the worst cover out there! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xycnv87N_BU

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): If I actually liked disco this would probably be a 10

**Brendon-Urine** (8): a TRUE timeless song.

**Jackalope117** (8): if this was the Taylor Swift version it would be a solid 2

**nooodisaster** (8): remember the unnecessary & idiotic outrage when Taylor covered this?? How to touch grass, a much needed thread.

**runaway3212** (8): great but repetitive

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): I don't think any memorable event has ever happened in any of the September 21st's I've lived through

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): stan Demi Adejuyigbe

=====

cremeebrulee: **Ghost-Quartet** (7): I said this in the original rate but I’ll say it again here, back in college the same guy would dj all of the theatre parties and this was his lynchpin song, he would put it on and it would always be a highlight. Everyone would go wild! But then for some reason he would always try to play it again later in the evening and it always fell flat… like the moment had passed. Nothing kills the mood more than hearing “September” by Earth Wind and Fire for the second time at a party.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (7): this song is only a 10 on one day of the year and it's not today

**ReallyCreative** (7): another overrated song that really doesn't deserve to be here but hey, I guess there are more offensive songs, even in the rest of this rate!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): good but not the second coming of christ like people make it out to be

**vayyiqra** (7): Not a great meme but good song

**akanewasright** (5): This is a good song. A great one, even. But I just find it so overplayed and overhyped. It feels like one of the only disco songs that like... the average straight white boy thinks it’s acceptable to like, and that annoys me. Anyway, I’m not giving it the score I’d naturally give it because it is a good song and I don’t want to sabotage it for everyone else.

**s4mmymusic** (5): this just isn’t the style of music i like pls don’t bully me

**pebbleheights** (4): Maybe this deserves to be higher but dear lord I have heard this song so many times.

CONGRATULATIONS TO OUR WINNER!!!! Fast Car was aptly named because it was a FAST winner. Look at that rank graph, because as soon as this hit #1 it NEVER LEFT! With this song getting the crown, we have finally defeated racism, misogyny, homophobia, AND balladphobia-- how fucking powerful is that? Fast Car may not be my favorite song here but I can't deny how incredible and emotional that storytelling is and Tracy delivers it in such a beautiful way. What a way to celebrate Black History Month, we honestly love to see it. 
---

## Vroom Vroom 

**bbfan132** (11): had to give this my 11 - i’ve loved this song for years but when i finally listened to it closely, the song took on a different form. it truly is a special song and i think it will always be a song that i view as very special to me

**bigbigbee** (11): Unlike other songs, which I often need to be in the mood for, I can listen to Fast Car any time and it will always bring me to the same headspace of peace, nostalgia, and slight melancholy. If I’m really wired, it soothes me. If I feel sad, it gives me comfort. If I feel happy, this transforms joy into a more muted feeling of calm. One of the most enduring classics ever, to me.

**flavasavavandal** (11): So, I’m giving Fast Car my 11. There are a lot of reasons why I’m doing this, the devastating story of the song is one, so are the dreamy guitars that hit during the chorus but hit different each time due to the context each chorus precedes, or maybe it’s killer lines like: “He says his body's too old for working / His body's too young to look like his”. But I would here all day typing out paragraphs about why this song just hits different and no one wants to read that. I love this song with all my heart and I just hope it wins

**frogaranaman** (11): one of the best written songs of all time

**jackisboredtoday** (11): honestly a contender for the greatest song of all time in my opinion. The hook is captivating and the story is such a complete and heartbreaking picture that I feel like I just lived a whole lifetime by the end of the song

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): not to sound like a boomer but this is kinda one of the best songs ever

**steelstepladder** (11): Ready to be heartbroken over this placement but this is genuinely one of the best songs ever made

**1998tweety** (10): great song

**akanewasright** (10): I thought this was gonna be pretentious or go over my head but this is amazing wtf

**astrologicalangel** (10): how have I never listened to this full song before??

**bespectacIed** (10): Master class in storytelling, this is an Academy award winning film in a 5-minute song. Too bad she's allegedly a terf

**bulforster** (10): Masterful storytelling and the way that chorus hits after being held off? Unmatched.

**camerinian** (10): This is just one of the most perfect songs to have ever been written. Hopeful and heartbreaking in equal measure, managing to pack in mental health, poverty, generational trauma, and the frailty of human relationships tied into all of it, all in less than five minutes. It's a masterpiece, and knowing that my 11 definitely will not win, I hope this does.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): So many people have tried to re-do this, and none ever come close to the original. Why do they keep trying? This is lightning in a bottle.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Astounding.

**fadedblue09** (10): This is the first time I heard this and I got chills already. Just wow. Never thought there'd be competition for my 11 but here we are.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): the original, the remix, the bieber cover. I just love this song it's incredible

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I know if Taylor wrote this song, it would place higher than whatever it’s going to place at in this rate because people cannot acknowledge that old music can be good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): People will call this boring and honestly. that is a bad opinion.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): beautiful

**jsonphile** (10): just a perfect example of storytelling in music.

**Kimchiprince** (10): no words

**ManofOranges** (10): In my mind, perhaps one of the greatest songs ever written. It's certainly up there, which is especially interesting because it doesn't have a lot going on. In terms of instruments, all it has is a guitar repeating over and over, and yet it's so much more than that. The lyrics are some of the most understandable of all time--and by that I mean it's so easy to put yourself in the place of the narrator and imagine how that must feel. It's incredible. You can feel the tragedy, the hope, the loss, and the happiness all in that fast car.

**MrSwearword** (10): "We gotta make a decision/Leave tonight or live and die this way" alone warrants the score

**mudkip1** (10): i spiraled to this song during the november election results

**musical\_pyn** (10): driver's license outsold. Seriously though, I immediately fell in love with this song when I first heard it. The song captures the always elusive feeling of a dream perfectly through the spare instrumental, narrative, and incredible vocal performance from Tracy Chapman. Also, the drums coming going into the chorus is one of my favorite moments in a song ever. This easily could have been my 11

**NFLfreak98** (10): Absolute classic, if anyone does to this song what Ritt Momney did to Put Your Records On we’re hunting them down right?

**nightjesus** (10): Tracy Chapman’s story telling in this song is beautiful. Regardless that it’s mostly the same chords played over and over again she honestly just brings you in with her story and the energy of chorus just completes it so amazingly. Forever a timeless classic.

**nooodisaster** (10): invented the cycle of poverty. wait, no, i didn't phrase that right-

**NotWith10000Men** (10): "leave tonight or live and die this way"

**pat-rickstar** (10): At time of writing Harlequin on the Masked Singer UK sang this classic last Saturday, and they're definitely Gabrielle mark my words

**ReallyCreative** (10): gays and gen z robbed this the first time because they can't drive but hopefully now that they have their driver's license by olivia rodrigo they will give this song what it deserves

**rickikardashian** (10): [tracy chapman in her fast car](https://twitter.com/MsRebeccaBlack/status/1359550142983008256)

**Roxieloxie** (10): As a known Balladphobe I dont regret giving ballads low scores often but this is one where I truly fumbled the bag with. I gave this a 7 in the charity rate , because i truly had never heard of it before and It was a ballad which was whatever. The moment this got revealed and I listened to it in plug I knew I made a mistake. I see why so many people gave it their 11 in that rate and it was honestly so deserved. This song is so beautiful and it just manages to captivate you in such a visual way.

**runaway3212** (10): this song is such a pretty bop, it's amazing

**s4mmymusic** (10): remember when an edm version of this song became a hit? i wish i didnt

**sirpancakeXI** (10): classic for a reason

**SmileAndTears** (10): EXCELLENCE!!! I LOVE THIS MAN'S VOICE!! AND WHY DO I WANT TO CRY ALL OF A SUDDEN??

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Hey, this was my submission to the last charity rate! Anyways I love this song. It's just kinda tragic, but you can't help but feel entraced watching it all play out each time you hear it

**Stryxen** (10): you’ve got a fast car i’ve got a plan to get a fast car

**TiltControls** (10): One of the best written songs of all time

**timothy444** (10): sob emoji

**waluigiest** (10): Okay I lied about Unwritten this is actually the peak of songwriting. It’s gorgeous.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this is absolutely beautiful and i KNOW its gonna get robbed bc its “too slow”...i hate it here

**wryn\_** (10): Maybe my favourite piece of songwriting ever

**bookthieving** (9.5): olivia rodrigo could never

**seanderlust** (9.4): can't relate; drive a kia.

**twat\_brained** (9.2): I still have to play this album, I've heard great things about it

ReallyCreative: Janet still deserved and I will not be forgetting this transgression, but Fast Car is proof that we overcame our demons today and I'm moderately impressed.

September should never have been this close, girls it's February, lets look at those calendars and understand that it was NOT its time. Shameful, just shameful.

TiltControls: What a rate! Thanks to Cremee for hosting such messy results and being the first 2021 Kosmi test subject! So many great interludes and shitposts that had us all on our toes (when chat wasn't being spammed with gifs anyways). Fast Car is a perfect winner and it seems taste came through with the results!!! (Though someday we're going to have a rate that's just Donna Summer so y'all can pay her some respect.)

As usual the [leaderboards](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1863576184) have updated! (Some of this is copy pasted from my comment from yesterday's thread)

##Songs##
**Fast Car**

- Though the average seems a little low for a winner, it's to be expected coming from an All-Stars type rate

- Average-wise it lands #390. *Very* close to it is its score in the Charity rate at spot #388. It's the closest score between the same song now, taking the record from... I'm Too Sexy. Huh, not what I was expecting to hold that record.

[**Controversy**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_controversial_songs)

- Closer beats its own controversy record (that it held for nearly 4 years!) by a sizable margin then immediately after, Shoes comes and also breaks the old Closer record. THEN stupid horse comes in and takes the 4th place spot!

[**Most Zeroes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_zeroes)

- Closer (5th - 26) and Shoes (7th - 21) both made it on the top 10

[**Most Rated**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_rated)

- Closer and Call Me Maybe both jump to 2nd place with 5 rates a piece. Do either still have enough goodwill in the rating community to catch up to Rolling in the Deep's 6? Find out in 2021!

##Artists##
There's a lot of lists where artists shifted a little, but I'm just going to focus on major jumps and additions/removals

[**Averages**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_highest_average_score)

- Megan Thee Stallion and Jay-Z fell off the top 20
- Replaced with Kanye (19th) and Kali Uchis (20th)

[**Most Elevens**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_elevens2)/[**Zeroes**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_most_zeroes)

- Taylor still has both top spots safely locked down
- Charli XCX enters the top 10 for most 11's (10th) and knocks Kanye West off
- Halsey is rising quickly on the zeroes list to 3rd due to the Closer association

[**Zeroless Artists**](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_least_zeroes)

- Unfortunately Rico Nasty falls off the list for a few 0's on Tia Tamera

##Rates##

- This rate is both the 7th most controversial rate and has the 6th highest number of participants ever!

- It also lands at 8th for highest percent of people to use their 0

Great rate overall and everyone [DO THE NEOSOUL RATE!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kp2jtg/women_of_neosoul_rate/)
