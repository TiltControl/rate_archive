=====

bulforster: It measures how spread out the scores are. Like (5,5) has the same average as (0,10) so the controversy score (aka standard deviation) is a number that differentiates that out where the higher it is, the bigger the score spread.

=====

deleted: It's called standard deviation! Basically, two songs could have the same score (7), but maybe one of those songs has a bunch of users who all gave it a 7, versus the other song which had a bunch of 10s, but also some zeros. They both average out to the same score, but clearly the second one is more controversial. That "controversy" value is how far apart the scores of a song are in a sense.

=====

pat-rickstar: Maths explanation: it's the standard deviation, which is the measure of how spread out the scores are around the average. So basically, the average difference between the score someone gave a song, and its overall average score 

Simpler explanation: if a song has a high controversy score, it is controversial and not agreed upon, so it has a wide range of scores. If the controversy score is low, most people gave the song similar scores.

Congratulations to our first song out!!! Only a couple of people correctly predicted this would come last. (Maybe because few people remember this song after it ends.) While it's far from the song with the most 0s, Woohoo suffered from the fact that few people _really_ loved it. It had an okay start, but got stuck with a lot of lower scores until it never left the bottom 5 and then eventually the bottom 1. Personally while I don't think this is the worst song here, I don't find it anything special so I don't mind this coming last. 

---

## Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion - WAP

**igorwithlicor** (11): I love this song and I'm not ashamed. It's not deep, but it's fun and funny. Christina telling you only need your face ha! And Nicki's fun verse. What else do you need in life? Eat some cake ha!

**fadedblue09** (10): This will get dragged :(((

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): yes I am giving this a 10, I think Christina ate it up in this song and I'm so sad that Bionic was paid dust. The hyperpop girlies want what she had during this era.

**JunkyGS** (10): Ahead of her time as always. WAP wishes....

**ManofOranges** (10): Honestly, this song just kind of sounds ugly at some points. Not at all points though. And yet, I still like it all the same. I don't understand why either.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Bionic is divisive, and no one can agree what its best songs are. I stand by my opinion that if this had a proper radio edit and a video, it would be remembered as one of the great party bangers/slutty bops of the 10s. The intro makes me ascend, and the chaotic electro-hip-hop energy still gets me hyped. Christina is a vocal chameleon, switching it up between ditzy playfulness and the assertive power she's known for, and Nicki delivers a fire verse. Anyways, this is gonna be robbed even harder than it was in the original Futuristic Flops rate, and I'm scared.

**CritneySpearz** (9.7): iconic, one of Christina’s best songs unironically

**anothertown** (9): This song, all 5 and a half minutes of it, is one of the clearest signifiers of taste that we have in our culture today

**hikkaru** (9): a bop. overhated. some people don't want to put their lips where her hips are and it shows (aka most of the people doing this rate..)

**worlds-okayest666** (9): an experimental avant-guarde proto-PC masterpiece I fear...

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): You were all so mean to the four good songs on Bionic!!

**bigbigbee** (8): A bit overlong and the sex metaphor is a little eye-roll-y, but that “woohoo” is so catchy.

**camerinian** (8): See, I actually really dig this beat on this. If I heard this song on student radio done by some indie rapper, I honestly think I'd stan, but it's a fucking atrocious fit for Xtina and Nicki

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Should have been Acapella.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I don’t actually hate this, it’s a bop

**pebbleheights** (8): that little woohoo sample plays in my nightmares

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): justice for bionic

**rickikardashian** (8): i know bionic was obliterated in it's rate, but this unironically just bops

**runaway3212** (8): This is way catchier than it should be

**skargardin** (8): hoe anthem yas

**Vultuxe** (8): Enjoyable and Nicki serves as she always did back then.

**yatcho** (8): a solid 5 til Nicki came and elevated it, the generous queen

**twat\_brained** (7.8): wait how am I just realizing this is just a cheap retread of the Pussycat Dolls' "Beep"? if there's anything "ahead of its time" it's Christina getting on the Nicki feature train early. With time I think I could learn to appreciate this. I mean I still bump Slayyyter's early demos so by that standard there's certainly room for Bionic cuts

**akanewasright** (7.5): dammit why do I like this

**bbfan132** (7.5): don’t know why this was picked over other songs but it’s still pretty good

**1998tweety** (7): i like it but its way too long

**celladonn** (7): This song is soooo unsexy and way too long but it also slaps so

**nightjesus** (7): Naww it’s like an innocent version of WAP.

**sirpancakeXI** (7): i lowkey like the woohoo sound effect, overall a fun little song

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): this is weirdly catchy, but is it good?

**bulforster** (6): Kind of annoying but still kind of a bop

**vayyiqra** (6): This bops and often electro songs with sexual lyrics are a winning combo but this is a bit silly lol, and also too repetitive. I still like it though

cremeebrulee: ## Justin Bieber - Yummy

**jackisboredtoday** (6): The Sims teas… anyway how could even 2010 nicki not make this very memorable

**nooodisaster** (6): This actually aged well... but 5 and a half minutes is too long for a song that has like 1 sonically interesting thing happen after the first 30 seconds.

**waluigiest** (6): this would have been a 3 without nicki

**AHSWeeknd** (5): The intro really sets you up for something else then this happens.

**bespectacIed** (5): spotify needs to have a "skip to nicki minaj verse" button

**cocosairdep** (5): Christina was at her lowest...

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): I am shocked that this was picked to compete All-Stars Rate over "Elastic Love", which I think is a much better song than "Woohoo". I was so ready to give this a 0 but this song isn't as bad as I remembered. Still kinda unlistenable to me though.

**endcreditouilles** (5): white girl's WAP, one point for each minute the song dragged on

**J\_Toe** (5): look, there are other songs I like on this album. Just not this.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): can’t work out if i like this or not so settling for a 5

**musical\_pyn** (5): I actually don’t dislike most of this song, but the fact I dislike the woohoo, which is pretty much the entire song, brings it down for me more than it might otherwise

**mynameistoo\_common** (5): so annoyingly catchy but not enough that I’ll ever listen to this again

**ReallyCreative** (5): hmm

**wryn\_** (5): I feel like gaga's influence on the pop scene in the early 2010s was so destructive, everyone was chasing quirky when only like 2 or 3 people could pull it off

**leira\_s** (4.5): nicki verse added several points to this rating

**seanderlust** (4.4): this song was a plot point in ben shapiro's origin story I just know it

**Awkward\_King** (4): pls why is this song 5 MINUTES LONG

**hunnybee12** (4): woohoooo

**nowqueenofpop** (4): See Blow (2013)

**teenage\_meme** (4): the intro was heavenly and then... the song started. that was a goddamn headache, and usually weird pitched-up glitchy samples are my bread and butter. intro was gorgeous tho

**NotWith10000Men** (3.5): the beginning is SO bad

**delicately-fearless** (3): this was bad for both parties

**frogaranaman** (3): this did NOT need to be nearly six minutes long

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): In general I’m a defender of Bionic but I can’t deny that there were plenty of songs on it that were super obnoxious, and this is one of them. Like themes like sex and vanity aren’t inherently bad but you have to tread carefully when writing about them because it’s easy to end up with something that revels in a lack of substance, like this song does.

**Kimchiprince** (3): 2 legends, 0 charisma

**lillipup03** (3): This is like a cringier version of Selena's mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm mmm

**notnotamotmot** (3): Pretty annoying song. Nicki bumps it up from a 2 to a 3 though.

**Roxieloxie** (3): So heres the think I actually started on this rate lastnight but my laptop crashed when i got 2/3rds done so I actually dont remember what my original scores for the first half. That being said I have absolutely no idea what is going on here, I was gonna make a joke about me when i play the sims, but i truly have no idea what is going on here

**Stryxen** (3): I got bored oop

**timothy444** (3): Does Christina wonder why her songs never chart anymore?

**SmileAndTears** (2.5): What the fuck is this omg. This isn't 'ahead of it's time' it's straight up garbage

**team\_kockroach** (2.5): Kind of sounds like a hot mess, not gonna lie

**astrologicalangel** (2): this is so inexplicably bad

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): the less i say about colonic the better

**CrimsonROSET** (2): just no.

**FKJVMMP** (2): I’ve avoided listening to anything from Bionic despite popular opinion for years because Christina Aguilera is terrible and I feel so vindicated right now.

**izeasklapaucius** (2): no but at least it has old Nicki so prop to that.

**jsonphile** (2): what the hell is this mess. Nicki Minaj’s verse is decent but the rest of this song is just painful to listen to. And even though 5 1/2 minutes is not particularly long (some of my favorite songs are 8 minutes long) but couldn’t they have cut this shorter?

**moonagenightmares** (2): out of all the songs on the album...

**TiltControls** (2): Probably the best song about two Sims having sex ever released. Unfortunately that's not a big category.

**brenda\_official** (1): why is this song over 5 minutes long help

**givebackmysweatshirt** (1): this is barely listenable. the sims remain unbothered

**MrSwearword** (1): goddamn you Junky, we wanted Kelis here. Not some Bionic with Nutcase Mattress shit.

**nootnoot781** (1): wait… how bad is bionic if this was submitted to an all stars rate?

**RandomHypnotica** (1): This is… not good, AND it goes on for an eternity

**s4mmymusic** (1): i’m sorry but what is this i

**zagreux** (1): no <3. also, why the fuck is this 5 minutes long?

**flavasavavandal** (0): So I’m giving this my 0 over a song in this rate I might dislike more. And my basic justification is, I hear effort in that song, I hear some form of passion that transcends through the barrier of me hating it. I do not hear that on Woohoo, I hear an overlong, dull song that doesn’t sexy, doesn’t sound fun because Christina and Nicki do not sound like they are enjoying being on this song. This song just bores me the most at the end of the day, and no other score makes sense to me. Bad song, delete forever - grimes

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this is just Justin Bieber - Yummy, but because it flopped gays can say this deserved better/was ahead of its time/lie about it.

**jasannn** (0): I like the vocals and attitude but the annoying ass "woohoo" and noisy production makes this song unbearable.

**plastichaxan** (0): i am absolutely in for artists doing stuff that's more "out there", however, every "woohoo" in the middle of what could've been a decent song made me lose literal years of life and had me in physical pain

**steelstepladder** (0): There's four opportunities to go w00h00, it's basically asking to get zeroed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): hahahahahaha what the fuck

:well: 

Closer had an optimistic start and its vocal minority of supporters convinced me this could hold a cute late Day 1/early Day 2 placement. Alas, the vast majority of raters decided they hate fun-- making this not only the song with the most zeroes but also the most controversial song of the rate, beating its own controversy score from last year. We love record-breaking legends! Since this didn't come dead last, I fully expect to see the JPN Bonus Track Version in our next Charity Rate/All Stars 5. So to all the haters you may as well give it a better score next time.

## People with taste

**FKJVMMP** (11): I’m 21 forever y’all, fight me.

**rickikardashian** (11): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Closer by The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey. The artistry is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical poetry most of the metaphors will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Drew's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into his characterisation - his personal philosophy draws heavily from Greek life fraternities, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these references, to realize that they're not just catchy- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Closer by The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Halsey's existencial catchphrase "Stay and play that Blink-182 song", which itself is a cryptic reference to the transcendental video of a young Ashley Nicolette Frangipane in the very beginning of her career singing Blink-182’s “I Miss You” at a mall, I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as The Chainsmokers and Halsey’s genius unfolds itself on their Spotify accounts. What fools... how I pity them. 😂 And yes by the way, I DO have a Closer by The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- And even they have to demonstrate that they're within 5 IQ points of my own (preferably lower) beforehand.

**timothy444** (11): Words to describe Daddysmokers and Slaysey: Accomplished, adept, admirable, adorable, angelic, appealing, beauteous, bewitching, brilliant, capable, captivating, charmin, comely, cute, dazzling, delicate, delightful, divine, elegant, enthralling, enticing, excellent, exquisite, fair, fascinating, fetching, fine, flawless foxy, good-looking, gorgeous, graceful, grand, handsome, intelligent, refined,perfect, proficient, pulchritudinous, skilled, smart, striking, well-crafted, wonderful

**Awkward\_King** (10): i hate this god forsaken song

**brenda\_official** (10): Closer

**celladonn** (10): Todd In The Shadows was right about this song actually

**CrimsonROSET** (10): everytime we rate this i'm more tempted to give it my 11.

**flavasavavandal** (10): I want this song to win just to see the amount of “did a full 180” memes but not enough to give it a higher score

**frogaranaman** (10): giving this a perfect score so the controversy score rises

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): iconic, incredible, show-stopping, awe-inspiring, still-that-bitch, invented range rovers. if you did not blackout to this song on a shitty, beer covered frat basement floor, i pity you.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): I'm just doing my part

**hikkaru** (10): it's not a "joke" it's a genuinely great song !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! closer antis dni

**ignitethephoenix** (10): when I genuinely like this more than a lot of other songs here...maybe I’ve been Stockholm syndromed...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok can we stop rating it now

**letsallpoo** (10): https://imgur.com/MmGnlBU

**lillipup03** (10): The Chainsmokers are good. 2015-18 EDM-pop was the absolute best. Fight me, popheads.

**ManofOranges** (10): I laughed, I cried a number of times, I sweat, I danced, I got shot, I ate, and I had many epiphanies.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): okay, memes aside, this song goes slap the fuck off. it's like, two forces of mediocrity came together and created greatness. it's one of the two songs where halsey's voice doesn't sound like she's sitting on a running washing machine that got kicked down a hill. it's good for pregaming, it's fun when you're sitting on the sidewalk because you almost got curbstomped at a st. patricks day parade and you're puking into a beer mug and trying to catch your second wind for a foam party.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i am not a closer apologist because this song has never done anything wrong

**RandomHypnotica** (10): JPN Bonus Track is an 11

**Roxieloxie** (10): Okay just know this would be my 11 if fob was not here. I honestly do not know why yall hate this song, its truly genuinely a good song, It's fun to scream with friends, fun to dance to. I am personally going to ensure that we rate this song until it ends so sorry to all the people who gave this a 0 that stan various 80s woman who got their peak in like 1986 or w/e but im different

**runaway3212** (10): this song is a look into what it's like being straight and boy do they paint it as depressing, but still we gotta thank them for the effort

**steelstepladder** (10): Support the Closer rate!

**TiltControls** (10): Anything higher than 60th is a win at this point

**twat\_brained** (10): u/hikkaru how does it feel to be a soothsayer?

**jasannn** (9.5): Drop sucks but the chorus is amazing.

**camerinian** (9): http://imgur.com/a/NQtmMof

**Marshynarsh** (9): I went from hating this song to singing along at the top of my lungs in 4 years. How????

**akanewasright** (8.5): Is this score high enough to save me from CarlieScion and RoxieLoxie’s wrath? Anyway, I like this song and have since it dropped.

**endcreditouilles** (8): one point deducted for each brain cell The Chainsmokers have

**jsonphile** (8): I kinda want to give this a 10 for the meme but if I’m being perfectly honest....it’s still a pretty great song. Flawed yes, but those flaws are part of what make the song work. No I will not elaborate

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): i should hate this so much but one time i heard it play in a huge group of fellow kids waiting for a concert at the mall who were all shouting along and it was honestly a transcendent experience

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I love Halsey, but that still isn't enough to make me really rock with this. I do get "WE AIN'T EVER GETTIN' OLDEEER" stuck in my head every now and then.

**musical\_pyn** (7): you'll never get me to admit this song is better than above-average

**NotWith10000Men** (7): society.jpg if this had been their only song

**useless-sheep** (7): i like the song i guess, nothing else to it

**vayyiqra** (7): The song itself is around a 7 but the meme around it on Popheads is a 10

**wryn\_** (7): I literally just wish dj swivel had made the drop on this the same quality as the one he did on euphoria by bts cause it singlehandedly ruins this song for me

**nightjesus** (6.5): I mean...it’s okay. It’s a decent pop song but I think their only decent song is super overlooked which is Roses. Also any song the chainsmokers don’t uh, sing on...no shade they just have no emotion in their vocals. It’s like listening to plain white bread honestly.

**cherryices** (6): bing bong bing bing bing bong

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): This song has its place in the history of the subreddit. But please don't make Closer the winner of this rate.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): popheads and rating closer, name a more iconic duo

**mynameistoo\_common** (6): this song is overplayed, but over-hated tbh

**waluigiest** (6): you know that viral tweet that’s like “put an average person in each Olympic event so we can compare and see how talented the athletes are”? That’s why we should include Closer in every rate

cremeebrulee: ## People who may need to get COVID tested

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): Couldn't choose between a 0 (in protest that this was voted in over like… anything else) or an 11 (because if it won we could let this meme die already) so I'll go with the average of the two

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): where were all of you when we were memeing this song back in 2016?

**worlds-okayest666** (5): i cant decide if its a 0 or a 10 so im just gonna go right in the middle

**sirpancakeXI** (4): BEGONE CHAINSMOKERS

**igorwithlicor** (3): What is that horrible sound?! It makes my ears hurt! Whatever it's going on, I hate it.

**izeasklapaucius** (3): no

**notnotamotmot** (3): I feel like this song just drones on forever. I love Halsey, but even she can't break free from the boringness of The Chainsmokers.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): everytime you make me rate this i lower my score 1 point

**fadedblue09** (2): Can we start memeing Roses instead?

**Jackalope117** (2): Halsey is great in this but everything else sucks and I heard it 10,000 times in 2016-2017 so nahhh

**pebbleheights** (2): Ok, listen: I didn’t intend to join the Closer hate train but I just think there are so many better songs on this list. It’s laaaaaaazzzzzyyyyy

**zagreux** (2): The bass line is so irritating ugh.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): this joke got old years ago enough is enough

**J\_Toe** (1): still no

**jayjaysortagay** (1): no 💗

**joshually** (1): This top contender for “Straight Anthem for the 21st Century” is so basic that it actually physically hurts me to listen to it.

**Kimchiprince** (1): you’re lucky to not get the 0

**nooodisaster** (1): not the JPN Version, so it's a 0 :)

**nootnoot781** (1): no i didn’t forget the extra 1, this song is on the same tier as matthew morrision and dance monkey when it comes to hate crimes.

**nowqueenofpop** (1): No.

**plastichaxan** (1): i couldn't even go through the whole thing again i'm tired of this

**s4mmymusic** (1): this song isn’t even h&mcore or forever 21core it’s like jcpenneycore

**team\_kockroach** (1): stop, it’s not funny

**Vultuxe** (1): No.

**1998tweety** (0): im getting tired

**AHSWeeknd** (0): Not because it’s the chainsmokers but because of that terrible chorus noise. If you use a synthesizer use it right.

**bbfan132** (0): so sick of this it’s not even funny

**bulforster** (0): Is this song going to break its own controversy record?

**cocosairdep** (0): terrorist + hterosexual mn = hate crime

**CritneySpearz** (0): pls can we never rate this god awful song again. I would give it a negative score if possible

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): GET SOME NEW MATERIAL, PLEASE, I AM BEGGING.

**JunkyGS** (0): HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO TEACH YOU THIS LESSON OLD MAN?! If this was the Japanese deluxe version it would be a 10 tho.....

**LuisEnRod** (0): (this is hands down the worst song ever made)

**moonagenightmares** (0): i hate yall

**MoonlightByWindow** (0): FLOP

**MrSwearword** (0): fuck this song and the delusional stans defending it every hour on the hour, get fucking taste.

**mysario** (0): this is a bad meme

**racloves** (0): fuck you all I hate this song

**ReallyCreative** (0): it's interesting how the same users that mock the sub for overusing the same jokes over and over again are the same ones insisting that including Closer in rates is funny.

**rslashpoopheads** (0): https://i.imgur.com/qPkYV4J.jpg

**seanderlust** (0): this song is a fort lauderdale applebee's during spring break. it is waiting for three hours at the DMV, only to be told you need to go online to update your tabs. it is the wrong shade of foundation applied to the face, but unblended into the neck. it is the second to last season of community, or any season of the big bang theory. it is an acquaintance showing you an epic meal time video nine years after it was uploaded. it is that episode of the simpsons with lady gaga that even gaga fans hate. this song drives a 2004 kia sorrento with a thin blue line sticker on the back windshield. it is hiking down a mountain on a sprained ankle or starting a work zoom meeting talking about how it was nice outside earlier but now it's starting to get cloudy, or a conversation with someone who thinks people are too sensitive to get his standup routines. I get that it's a meme here, but this song is tedious and mediocre and the only song on this list that is actively unpleasant to listen to. it sucks. it is therefore the easiest 0 I have ever given out. stream paris by the chainsmokers BYE.

**skargardin** (0): its time to admit that this meme has run its course

**SmileAndTears** (0): I'm giving this a 0 cuz I'm still mad about it beating Your Best American Girl and I just know some of y'all will give this an 11 just for the memes so I'm counterbalancing

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Every time this is put in a rate I will give it my zero on principle at this point.

**Stryxen** (0): I will NOT give this my 11 so I’m having the only other strong opinion I can <3

**yatcho** (0): the meme is old, pack it up

Honestly, THIS was the song I expected to come in last. Unlike its peers from the Meme Rate, it's not a "real" song to start with. I didn't expect it to fare well with the younger /r/popheads members either. Yet this song manages to have fewer zeroes and be less controversial than Closer! (which is uh, not a high bar considering it still has 20+ zeroes.) While I never watched this video when I was younger, I can definitely appreciate it as an artifact of its time, though a lot of people seem to think that maybe we should've left it in the past.

## These comments RULE

**1998tweety** (10): masterpiece

**akanewasright** (10): Stupid boy... stupid boy...

**bulforster** (10): I want to be on the right side of history.

**celladonn** (10): The IMPACT this had on me in grade 6

**cocosairdep** (10): I’d never heard this before, but it made me laugh really hard. It deserves tbh.

**CreepyMannequin** (10): changed my life

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6gbT_QG75Z4

**endcreditouilles** (10): the very first youtube video I ever saw. Me and 10 others crowded around my friend's brand new iphone 3 during our lunch break from marching band practice. I can smell this memory, it smells like band kids and feet

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this literally invented hyper pop and made YouTube popular I better not see people robbing it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is art mawma.

**ManofOranges** (10): The most robbed song of the meme rate (except for maybe Caramelldansen, seeing as how that's not even in this rate). I think people have a hard time appreciating this song now because the comedy of the internet of ~15 years ago is vastly different from that of today. But if you can stomach it, I think it's genuinely pretty entertaining. Some shoes do suck, but these Shoes rule.

**MrSwearword** (10): THESE SHOES ARE THREE HUNDRED FUCKING DOLLARS

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**nightjesus** (10): Kelly has been my main pop girl since 2007 your faves could never. It was very hard not to get this an 11. It’s just so iconic.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): why is this unironically good has hyperpop ruined my brain forever

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This LITERALLY invented Hyperpop and I expect everyone who also participated in that rate to give this the 10 or 11 it deserves

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song RULES

**Roxieloxie** (10): Hello Cremee, quick question, I am allowed to reverse sabotage a song? This is another one of those things thats before my time so i dont have the connection to it that made you all love it. However I love that this got voted in and I know that this is apparently gonna be a 0 magnet, however i love this vision so im giving it a ten to help it go out 2nd to last instead of last

**s4mmymusic** (10): the subtle noise music influence on this song... the commentary on consumerism... this is basically rina sawayama’s xs but made in 2006

**seanderlust** (10): these shoes are $300. these shoes are $300. these shoes are $300 fucking dollars. LET'S GET EM.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Just bought a pair of shoes today so im gonna give it a ten. But for real though i unironically like this song please someone save me.

**skargardin** (10): let's get some shoes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song RULES!!

**teenage\_meme** (10): literally the first video i saw on youtube. endlessly iconic. also i think this is hyperpop's grandma

**TiltControls** (10): Popheads who don't give this legend of Youtube a 10 do not deserve the internet

**vayyiqra** (10): Unironically invented hyperpop and is better than most of it too. (Betch)

**waluigiest** (10): This is honestly the first YouTube video I have memories of. It is an incredibly iconic song and the video will live as one of the young internet’s best moments. I’m just praying this makes it to Day 2

**worlds-okayest666** (10): unironically a great song idc

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this is actually fun and the blueprint... noitstrue

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): LET'S GET EM

**jasannn** (9): is this hyperpop?

**musical\_pyn** (9): This song has an incredibly menacing aura that I have yet to encounter anywhere else

**runaway3212** (9): capitalist queen, taylor who?

**yatcho** (9): iconic

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Kelly is one of the first memes I remember from my teen years, so she has a special place in my heart. Stream Masks too!

**brenda\_official** (8): innovative electroclash classic

**cherryices** (8): fuck you!!!

**J\_Toe** (8): if you grew up liking this song you now listen to Charli XCX

**LuisEnRod** (8): (only 90s kids will understand)

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): now...why is this kinda bopping

**pat-rickstar** (8): @ anyone who gives this their 11: it's not going to happen! Remember the M11 Channel Theme?

**slimboyfriend** (8): do u think people would still laugh at this if it debuted on tiktok?

**twat\_brained** (8): I can't give this a 10 and then call "Sucker" bad that's not fair to Charli

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I don't know what I would've done if this hadn't made it in

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it’s a bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): foundational

**izeasklapaucius** (7): the best song that came from a YouTubers.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): ngl im mostly rating this on nostalgia factor but also this is high camp and was ahead of it's time

cremeebrulee: ## These comments SUCK

**bigbigbee** (6): Oops. I should have voted for Caramelldansen instead of this. While this is the more iconic meme, Caramelldansen is a much better song in a vacuum. However, score aside, I need to extol the virtues of the video. It’s perfection, and a relic of…if not a better internet, then at least a better YouTube. Anyway, con-damns and fiscal responsibility for one and for all.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (6): https://youtu.be/UWCgCmQt-YA this getting voted in... suddenly i hate democracy

**wryn\_** (5.5): what the hell is this????

**DaHumanTorch** (5): this is simultaneously a masterpiece and also the worst song ever

**frogaranaman** (5): oh my gawd. shoes.

**jsonphile** (5): okay the joke is not that funny

**nowqueenofpop** (5): Paved the way for Gaga

**camerinian** (4.5): I mean it is iconic but I haven't listened to this recently outside of its two rates and I don't really know why anyone else would

**lillipup03** (4): My mom's name is Kelly, and she does, indeed, have too many shoes.

**Stryxen** (4): simply no opinion

**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): kelly always scared me when i was younger. also this gay that stalked me on ig dressed up as her for halloween so it's just not happening for me today kelly.

**Kimchiprince** (3): meh

**pebbleheights** (3): betch >:(

**Awkward\_King** (2): iconic

**ElizabethDDoS** (2): I mean...

**FKJVMMP** (2): How do people talk so much shit about Chainsmokers when this is literally just #selfie.

**Jackalope117** (2): back to bad meme songs I see

**NFLfreak98** (2): Just no. I can’t even ironically like this

**Vultuxe** (2): I don't like random meme songs, I get it was probably iconic at the time though.

**bbfan132** (1): not funny at all to me - maybe i’m too serious, maybe i’m just too young lol

**bespectacIed** (1): nobody laughed

**fadedblue09** (1): Still don't get it sorry

**flavasavavandal** (1): You ever listen to Robyn’s Don’t Fucking Tell Me What To Do. I don’t know if this song is widely appreciated within the Robyn fandom but if it isn’t it ought to be. This is closest comparison to that song I can think of, and basically the biggest differences is DFTMWTD isn’t overly obnoxious, has a point, and it’s payoff is like carthartic. Instead Shoes feels basic, pointless, obnoxious, and it’s attempt of sounding industrially satanic is weak af. In short, Shoes sucks, wear sandals

**moonagenightmares** (1): what the fuck

**mynameistoo\_common** (1): this song is awful even as a meme song

**notnotamotmot** (1): God I hate this. I hated this video when it came out and I hate having to revisit it now. Why is this even here?

**NotWith10000Men** (1): these shoes suck? This SONG sucks

**plvstvcbvrds** (1): I have never found this funny.

**SmileAndTears** (1): No <3

**zagreux** (1): I don't get this song.

**astrologicalangel** (0): fuck this I'm not even sorry

**Brendon-Urine** (0): the fuck?

**ChandelierFlickering** (0): I get that it's like this on purpose, but I did not enjoy listening to that

**delicately-fearless** (0): whyyy??

**hikkaru** (0): I don't rly get this sorry!!

**igorwithlicor** (0): This might be the worst song I've heard in my life. It's a funny meme, but a terrible song. Is it a song? Whatever this might be, it's 2 minutes and 43 seconds too long.

**nooodisaster** (0): 100 gecs could never

**rickikardashian** (0): so this is the meme song yall chose to vote in over caramelldansen….. aight

**timothy444** (0): Do I regret giving this a 0 two times in a row? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMTAUr3Nm6I

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i have no nostalgia for this and i fear it inspired todrick hall - nails hair hips heels

Eliminated Men Count: 6

OneRepublic's Counting Stars was one of the highest rated songs eligible for this rate, only third to sub faves Janet Jackson and Lana Del Rey. Yet the motivation in choosing I Lived over that track is the fact it's apparently a favorite among Glee fans. Still, that wasn't enough to save this song from the bottom-- it never left the bottom 7 at all, making it one of the worst performing songs in the whole rate. While this isn't my favorite OneRepublic song, I do think it's pretty decent. I definitely think its underperformance (much like most songs today) comes from the fact that we can't seem to rate men fairly. Maybe it was for the best we didn't vote Counting Stars in either!

---

## Gleeks 

**TiltControls** (11): I was worried at first about giving my 11 away to what will probably be a day 1 elimination song, but then I remembered I gave it to Closer last year so really there's nowhere to go but up. Also this 11 is unrelated to Glee for anyone wondering (I only made it to season 2 or so). I just really love any "I'm going out to live my life to the fullest" type song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): If the high scores section is called 'gleeks' I'm gonna selegend myself. (Not actually.)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): here its me another gleek mentioning the series finale

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a bop but counting stars and love runs out and feel again >>>> fuck glee.

**mysario** (10): Gleeks rise up!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): manifesting at least day 2

**Roxieloxie** (10): Okay so if it we're up to just me, I was originally gonna send in a bastille track over this, but they won so i felt that was a little unfair, then i was gonna send in "If I loose myself' but this song got so many unexpected 11s and i was confused until i was informed this song holds value to the glee stans i guess, so I ended up going with this. It's probably going out day 1 and im okay with that

**twat\_brained** (9.3): it saddens me to think about Naya Rivera proudly proclaiming she lived in the final Glee performance… only to leave us 5 years later.

**fadedblue09** (9): Thank you for the hosts for putting a good OneRepublic song in (not that there's a lot of them though).

**ManofOranges** (9): The verses of this song are just alright in my opinion, but the chorus is deinitely where it's at. Listening to it makes me feel like I lived a life worth living.

**timothy444** (9): OneRepublic is like the cool version of Maroon 5. I'm not saying it because it's actually relevant to the song but it's a funny thought I had. Anyways, love this track and it hits on a personal level.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this is good

**1998tweety** (8): Wtf this is such a serve...what a bop

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): OneRepublic will always be my guilty pleasure. Ryan Tedder knows how to make a good bop.

**jsonphile** (8): OneRepublic isn’t anything amazing, but they’ve put out some good songs. This is a good song.

**musical\_pyn** (8): The song and lyrics are better than I remembered, but it falls into that kind of sound that I associate with every 2010s kind of inspirational pop, and I really don’t want to go back to that

**jasannn** (7.5): a little generic radio filler but the chorus hits different.

**bulforster** (7): No one in their right mind would choose to be a gleek, so it shouldn't be held against them.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Oh this is kinda cute.

**frogaranaman** (7): this was an annoying Tiktok trend but that’s okay because the song is good

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I don’t even like this song that much but it still should have beaten “Pompeii”

**hikkaru** (7): counting stars sweetie I'm so sorry

**igorwithlicor** (7): It's okay? I think?

**kappyko** (7): i live

**letsallpoo** (7): this song's inclusion in this rate is evidence of why gleeks should not be allowed to make executive decisions edit: nvm this is better than i remember maybe the gleeks made points

**NotWith10000Men** (7): 'I Was Here' but milquetoast

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): This song is just so mediocre in all aspects, I have listened to it 3 times and I have nothing to say about it

**bigbigbee** (6): I swear that I like pop that was written for Top 40 Radio, I do (see my It’s Time score), but something about this one doesn’t connect for me.

**SmileAndTears** (6): This song is brought to you by Jeep

**waluigiest** (6): I really rushed through this original rate in like a day lmao

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): when this became the final song performed on Glee… the best moment of that show truly was the fact that they mercifully let it end

**izeasklapaucius** (5): ennui

**joshually** (5): This is like Coldplay lite… and Coldplay is already Coldplay lite

**LuisEnRod** (5): (this is basically the same song that Onerepublic has done like 20 times now)

**nooodisaster** (5): it's.... okay? like it's already aged so much & just feels very generic to me, even if the melodies are pretty strong.

**sirpancakeXI** (5): This song is so bland

**skargardin** (5): I have no strong feelings one way or the other as far as onerepublic songs go really

**slimboyfriend** (5): I'm satisfied that we moved beyond that bland faux-folksy pop music made by men.

**steelstepladder** (5): I don't like this type of song... If it ever had power, the 2010s running the millennial whoop into the ground has robbed this song of it

**Vultuxe** (5): Not really my taste.

**wryn\_** (5): There are so many annoying indie pop songs I only know cause every ad in the uk has them in the background and this is one

**team\_kockroach** (4.5): For fuck’s sake, this song doesn’t know how to scale back

**bbfan132** (4): i sleep

**bookthieving** (4): and we sang this song for our graduation ceremony. now i’m sus u/Roxieloxie was on my senior year class council

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): this reminds me of that one tik tok that's like "my friends when i show up on time" and now i miss going out anyway this is whatever

**givebackmysweatshirt** (4): it's like the better, more masculine version of fight song. sad for them that a better version of a shitty song is still bad

**plastichaxan** (4): zzzz glee version superior

**redgold51** (4): I've sat through too many cheesy, nostalgic vids with this song playing to ever enjoy it again :(

**runaway3212** (4): This was worse than I remembered

**bespectacIed** (3): glee going out with a poof with a cheesy unknown 1rep song was a testament to its completely depleted cultural impact 💀 It's actually sad

**hunnybee12** (3): this is too optimistic i can't stand it

**jayjaysortagay** (3): why are y'all including all the most boring male pop songs of the 2010s 😭

**notnotamotmot** (3): Bleh.

**nowqueenofpop** (3): Remember when they released good music

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): this song was literally in a car commercial. onerepublic deserves the hate that imagine dragons gets.

**AHSWeeknd** (2): played at every WASP Cul-De-Sac barbecue.

**anothertown** (2): glee type beat

**camerinian** (2): if Ryan Murphy stans get this totally ordinary wonderbread-ass, X Factor golden buzzer crying montage-ass, "ask your doctor if this IBS medication is right for you" bullshit past day 1 I swear to God

**nightjesus** (2): I didn’t like this One Republic album and I didn’t like this song. Like it sounds so similar to everything else they had released on their previous albums. And the drums are very similar to Counting Stars. Basically this is watered down Counting Stars.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (2): OneRepublic have some good songs. This ain't it.

**zagreux** (2): this was so boring ugh

**DaHumanTorch** (1): this is the type of song to play in a teenage white girl’s birthday montage she made for her friend on PicCollage

**ReallyCreative** (1): fuck this granola bar/hemorrhoid cream commercial ass music

**s4mmymusic** (1): this song fills me with rage

**akanewasright** (0): oh. That’s what this song is called

**pebbleheights** (0): This is not a song it’s a Hallmark card.

While every other song so far has placed 10th or below in their original rates, we finally have our first song that actually could've won its original rate ~had I managed to submit my Hyperpop Rate ballot.~ And for a runner-up, this song is certainly divisive. It seems like you can only either hate or love 100 gecs, giving it one of our highest controversy scores of the rate. But don't count out the haters quite yet, since this track is also the one I received the most ballot changes about! (usually from people asking to raise their scores to 10.) Yet even with this track growing on y'all, it never could quite leave the bottom 10. Perhaps the duo will fare better if we ever rate their remix album, which seems to be more generally liked here.

## I just fell out of the Porsche

**Brendon-Urine** (11): yeah I like a lot of other songs here but at the end of the day I'm a gec stan. I live and breathe 100 gecs. I still remember exactly when and where I was when I first heard 1000 gecs and it just immediately clicked, I knew I found what I had been looking for for so long. Long live Laura and Dylan, this song fucks so hard.

**camerinian** (11): If I don’t give this my 11, I fear that nobody else will, and a world in which this doesn’t get an 11 is not a world I want to live in. This is the most raucous fun I’ve had with basically any song in the past three years, and it is genuinely irresistible if you let yourself get over any sense of "good" taste. This is trashcore at its absolute finest, it's serotonin injected directly into my veins, and I really wish more hyperpop projects ended up actually being this, y’know, hyper. Pick it the fuck up

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): if you made me do this rate 1 year ago id give this my 0 but quarantine really did something to me and now im obsessed with hyperpop and 100 gecs so i guess this is where i am now

**celladonn** (10): A strong 11 contender. This song scrambled my brain permanently and I couldn't be happier!

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): not going to let you tw*nks cyber bully me into believing this is good

**hunnybee12** (10): kick it up!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i actually like this oops.

**izeasklapaucius** (10): "THERE'S EVEN A SKA SONG"

**ManofOranges** (10): It hurts to see this song here, not because I hate this song, but because I actually really love this song, and if I had rated this song the first time around, it would've won because I vastly prefer this over Concrete Angel. Unfortunately, I can't change the past, I can only influence the future, so here I am, giving Stupid Horse a 10 to hopefully prevent it from getting done dirty once again (even though it's definitely gonnna get shat on hard in this rate).

**musical\_pyn** (10): when 100 gecs is good, they're incredible. Seriously though, this song has such an incredible energy and makes me want so much more from them

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): banger song thank you 100 gecs

**runaway3212** (10): People who hate this probably hate animals

**s4mmymusic** (10): this is going to get robbed i just know it

**sirpancakeXI** (10): BOP

**steelstepladder** (10): This is probably going out first but idk

**Stryxen** (10): i don’t care this is literally a good song and it’s fun and it bops (the choir at the end especially <3)

**teenage\_meme** (10): lbr i would give any gecs song a 10 because i love them SO MUCH they deserve EVERYTHING! pick it up!

**twat\_brained** (10): no thoughts only gec

**wryn\_** (10): It's no money machine but it is almost as funny. How do they even come up with songs ideas like this lol

**slimboyfriend** (9.6): It mashed up every genre and even some you don't! How could you not love it?

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i'll be honest all the original songs sound kind of empty now i've listened to the remixes so many times that i just can't enjoy them as much but it's still brilliant. this is out on day 1 isn't it...

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): has anyone mashed this up with stupid love yet because i feel like that would be enjoyably terrible

**anothertown** (9): Stop underestimating gecs 2021

**bbfan132** (9): banger

**bulforster** (9): PICKITUP!! This is so fucking dumb, I love it.

**frogaranaman** (9): should have won

**timothy444** (9): Even though the remix is miles better, this still bangs

**waluigiest** (9): emily montes outsold

**worlds-okayest666** (9): the gfoty remix outsold tbh but this is still great

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This is so trashy lmao I like this

**jasannn** (8.5): a banger

**seanderlust** (8.4): AU: the local race track wants to appeal to millennials and their new money, so they try to create a jingle to advertise to them a la education connection. however, they leave production to a well-meaning unpaid intern who pitches up the vocals by accident and can't figure out how to fix it. the jingle turns out as you would expect, but it unexpectedly works after it blows up on tiktok.

**1998tweety** (8): bops for a gec song

**Roxieloxie** (8): i gave this a 3 at first but its been haunting me ever since, so i listened to it again and i think i get it now

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.5): The Remix outsold....

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I more respect this song then I like it.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): I'll admit that I didn't get 100 gecs at first but now? gecgecgecgec

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i have no clue what to give this but i don’t hate it so...a 7 it is

**SmileAndTears** (7): Alright, it's not as bad as I expected it to be but I still got a brain aneurysm listening to it

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): i love nightcore!

**pebbleheights** (6): gecgecgecgecgecgecgecgec

**ReallyCreative** (6): well at least it's not Closer

**moonagenightmares** (4): money machine is the only good 0gecs song

**nooodisaster** (4): stoopid

**AHSWeeknd** (3): I just can’t get behind these vocals. The production is great though.

**igorwithlicor** (3): No, sis, I can't with this. I'm too sober for this

**jsonphile** (3): okay I guess 100 gecs just isn’t for me

**pat-rickstar** (3): Justice for Flamboyant

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): it’s one of their better songs but compared to everything else here? Trash

**FKJVMMP** (2): I’m still not sure if I don’t get it or if I do and I actually just hate it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I like a lot of artists who are influenced by and like 100 Gecs, but the Gecs themselves hold no appeal to me. This feels like I’m listening to a Monster Energy Drink, I feel like this song hates itself.

**lillipup03** (2): I really want to understand the hype behind 100 gecs, but I just don't see how y'all listen to this... though I do genuinely love the lyrics lol

**nightjesus** (2): what the hell is happening oh my.

**Vultuxe** (2): There's exactly one gecs song I enjoy but this is not it.

**bespectacIed** (1): an incredibly stupid song

**flavasavavandal** (1): Listening to this song, I have to consistently remind myself that just because I don’t get it, doesn’t mean it is valueless. But I despised listening to this, it aggravates me while reveling in an extended metaphor that makes less sense the more I think of it and isn’t even remotely as clever as 100 gecs think it is.

**J\_Toe** (1): no

**joshually** (1): this assaulted my ears, my brain and my spirit

**LuisEnRod** (1): (no <3)

**mynameistoo\_common** (1): I just really hate hyperpop

**NFLfreak98** (1): stupid song

**plvstvcbvrds** (1): i feel like i'm about to get hate crimed by somebody wearing purge mask every time i hear this song. and not just any purge mask, one of those shitty neon light ones, and you just know they'd have a bathroom dye job hacked hair cut and platform shoes. i'd get hate crimed by some scene kid in platform shoes, while this song played in the background.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): if Closer weren't in this rate this would definitely get my 0

**cherryices** (0): the vocals remind me of every naff jumpstyle remix i had to listen to in 2007. unpleasant!

**endcreditouilles** (0): this gave me war flashbacks from when I didn't make the cut for my high school bf's top 8 on myspace

**jayjaysortagay** (0): sorry this is bullshit and I judge people that like this, it sounds like Charlie the Unicorn ran across a DJ's decks and they just released the random shite that occurred as a result

**nbapip** (0): just had to google "are 100 gecs serious" didn't think anything would ever snatch the zero from smash mouth but they managed at the last second

**notnotamotmot** (0): wow, I hate everything about this. I would have loved to give my 0 to a more deserving song, like Shoes, but I can't in good faith say anything on this list is worse than this.

**NotWith10000Men** (0): I truly, TRULY do not understand the appeal

Eliminated men count: 11

I wished this song was the first out (like it was with the first few ballots) since it would be fitting to open All Stars with All Star. Personally, I thought this song would do better considering how much people (myself included) love Shrek around here. However, it seems like this song's underperformance has nothing to do with the fact that we hate men but rather with the fact that Smash Mouth is doing concerts during quarantine? Which is obviously yikes ... but let's be honest, that doesn't stop this song from being a banger. Hopefully y'all keep the same energy when we rate Dua in [Ultimate Ultimate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/laytk2/2020_ultimate_ultimate_rate_the/) next month ;)

## Well, the 10s start coming...

**anothertown** (10): You don’t see people doing all star memes anymore. A joke that was completely run into the ground until dead. What a fucking hook on this song btw

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): OMG i'm so used to the Shrek intro that the full version feels eternal… but how could I not give this a 10

**ImADudeDuh** (10): unironically bought this on itunes when i was like 11.

**Jackalope117** (10): except this one, this meme song is good

**ManofOranges** (10): This was originally my 11 in the meme rate before making a gut decision to switch it to the Mii Channel Theme. Ultimately I'm glad I made the switch, but there's a reason I originally chose this song as my 11, that being that I believe this is a genuinely great song. Call it what you want--nostalgia for Shrek, stupidity, lack of taste--the fact of the matter is that this song elicits such a strong positive reaction out of me that I can't help but smile, and I just think that's beautiful.

**MrSwearword** (10): I mean duh

**nooodisaster** (10): I think these meme songs literally JUST boil down to how much nostalgia you have for them, and not their actual quality at all. But I have the most nostalgia for this one so I think it's clever and catchy & timeless and the rest are trash :)

**notnotamotmot** (10): I dunno if other generations will feel the same way about this song, but I think this is my number 1 nostalgia song. I love listening to it (and have a soft spot for Smash Mouth in general). This song was just everywhere growing up, and I LOVED it as a kid. My family didn't have that many VHS tapes, so I wound up just watching Shrek and Rat Race over and over, and All Star is heavily featured in both of those movies.

**Vultuxe** (10): Fine, no sane person will say they dislike this song.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): the second verse…[DISCUSSION] are Smash Mouth climate change activists

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): imagine risking your life for a smash mouth concert in a pandemic ..thousands of people did that!

**izeasklapaucius** (9): hack one point because they did a gig in this Pantene

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): so true smash mouth

**nightjesus** (9): Great song with that Shrek nostalgia but shitty band.

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song ran the 2000s, I'm not expecting Gen Z to understand

**slimboyfriend** (9): This song is a muse to so many people in the world and I can't rate it any lower.

**twat\_brained** (9): would be 10 but I'm docking a point for "borelore". But if they tweeted "eversnore" it'd be another 0.5 because that one's fairer.

**waluigiest** (9): idc this song is good. Shriek soundtracks stay undefeated

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): This was the most played song on my iTunes for YEARS because of how often I played it growing up. Even though I’ve grown as a person and moved on from this song I have to respect the person I used to be

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): this would be a ten but i have to doc points off for them being anti covid :///

**TiltControls** (8.5): Remembered fondly for Shrek, but it's also a really fun song otherwise

**akanewasright** (8): I keep completely forgetting about the third verse.

**camerinian** (8): God I can't wait for this pandemic to be over so I can be back in a crowd throwing chunks of bread at the shrek song guy

**jsonphile** (8): if you want to know exactly what the end of the 90’s sounded like, this song is basically it. It just sounded like all star. And it was awesome. I mean, I was 2, but that’s my understanding of the late 90’s.

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Well! The years start coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and they don't stop coming and

**rslashpoopheads** (8): a solid bop but I'm sick of it!

**jasannn** (7.5): Get out my swamp.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Do I like this song or do I just like Shrek?

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): there's like 5 songs with this same sound from the late 90s that are better but this is still really fun

**1998tweety** (7): this kinda aged lowkey

**ChandelierFlickering** (7): like the chorus, but not the verses so much

**CreepyMannequin** (7): Stan Mystery Men (1999)

**J\_Toe** (7): this song is overshadowed by Shrek and the band is overshadowed by news of the COVID breach.

**bulforster** (6.5): Hosting a superspreader event is Not Good but I'm finding it hard to hold that against the song.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): someBODY once told me

**hikkaru** (6): it's catchy, we stan shrek, but idk I think I'm just over it

**lillipup03** (6): I wish I liked this song more, but that voice is... ugh

**LuisEnRod** (6): (this song reminds me of Shrek and the straight people who refuse to let this song die)

**NotWith10000Men** (6): shrek is love, shrek is--aw fuck it nvm

**pebbleheights** (6): The memes made me forget how much I like this song.

**timothy444** (6): Love this song but memes have ruined it by overplay and it doesn't need to win a rate. In fact, it should go to deserving songs such as Closer by The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey.

Eliminated men count: 14

I stand firmly with the fact that Emo Rate 1.5 was THEE messiest rate of the past year, surpassing even the dumpster fire that was Redemption Rate. After Fall Out Boy make a swift departure on Day 3, it was up to Panic! to defeat the monstrosity that was a potential Paramore top 4 ~which, spoiler alert, it couldn't do.~ Anyway I'm not sure why I bring this up considering that this song isn't even on the album we rated, but is rather a song Panic! did for the Jennifer's Body soundtrack. I think the idea was that surely fans of the movie would be more likely to rate this song well, but it seems like we all agree that Day 1 is a good placement for this. 

---

## Can we fast-forward ...

**anothertown** (10): I was 16 the summer this came out so I guess I just need to think about this whenever I can’t understand teen nostalgia about micro-eras in 2018 orwhatever.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I once dated a guy that used "can we fast-forward to go down on me" as a pick up line and I'm ashamed to say it worked. Can't say I'm surprised it ended with me and 2 other girls finding out he was dating us all at the same time. This song is still pop punk perfection tho.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck paramore

**mysario** (10): this is going out Day 1 but that's okay, at least it made it here

**s4mmymusic** (10): brendon urie has committed many war crimes in his life but this is the only way he successfully tried to somewhat make me forgive him

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I’m disappointed by how much I like this song

**kappyko** (9.5): i actually liked this i- (FUCK YOU BRENDON URIE!!!)

**hikkaru** (9): a bop but I wish ballad of mona lisa or nearly witches were here instead, those would be 11 contenders

**ManofOranges** (9): I never was a big fan of Brendon Urie or Panic at the Disco, but this song I can actually stomach and, better yet, enjoy.

**moonagenightmares** (9): great movie

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): now everyone watch jennifer’s body

**musical\_pyn** (9): old Panic :(

**Roxieloxie** (9): Never seen the movie but this is a bop

**Vultuxe** (9): I'll admit this is pretty good. Dated as hell though.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): this song forever being associated with Megan Fox is awesome.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): Why is the only song from the V&V rate to end up in All Stars not even from the album 😭

**bbfan132** (8): wish panic still made music as good as this

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I’m eleven years old again… I’m on a long car ride…

**igorwithlicor** (8): Just some good rock

**plastichaxan** (8): stream jennifer's body

**runaway3212** (8): very good

**seanderlust** (8): watch jennifer's body

**sirpancakeXI** (8): I don't really like him normally, but this song is pretty good.

**SmileAndTears** (8): bop

**rickikardashian** (7.8): i was going to give this a lower score, and then i realized this sounds like every 5sos song I'm obsessed with

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): listen jennifer's body is one of my favourite films i couldn't in good conscience give this any lower

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): why was this chosen over This is Gospel @ hosts you know who you are and I’m annoyed at your decision

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I know we're rating the music, not the person, but I can't listen to Brendon Urie's voice the same way after the allegations against him. Shame, since this is a genuinely catchy song and Jennifer's Body is a slayful movie.

**CreepyMannequin** (7): this is no “Through The Trees” by Low Shoulder but it’s still pretty good

**CrimsonROSET** (7): is this just the horny emo version of fast car

**frogaranaman** (7): this was my friend’s most listened to song on Spotify in 2020

**nightjesus** (7): oh I missed this in 2009. I would have jammed to this hard back then. Naw it’s cute.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): no comment

cremeebrulee: ## ...til these scores go down?

**1998tweety** (6): erm

**cherryices** (6): i’ve given up on ever liking pop punk

**pat-rickstar** (6): I normally strongly dislike Panic but I surprisingly don’t hate this

**steelstepladder** (6): Not bad but I feel like Panic! has released this song 20 times

**timothy444** (6): average

**waluigiest** (6): it’s fine but so bland for panic

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Which 2010’s coming of age movie is this from?

**akanewasright** (5): This is... fine?

**camerinian** (5): I enjoyed my memories of this song from 10 years ago more than I did relistening to the song for the first time since then and now I'll never have that feeling again. Gutted

**lillipup03** (5): I think Brendon is a really cool person, but god I absolutely cannot stand his voice.

**notnotamotmot** (5): Meh

**ReallyCreative** (5): It's impressive how despite how mediocre this is, it's still leagues better than Urine's solo stuff after Panic! became a vanity project.

**skargardin** (5): average as far as a p1atd song goes

**wryn\_** (5): Musically it's pretty bland and knowing brendon urie is/was a creep doesn't help it much

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (4): oh this aged badly for me

**nooodisaster** (4): I'm sure people like this song, and that's okay

**racloves** (4): hate this band and always have

**givebackmysweatshirt** (3.5): the me! guy makes music?

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): The way we rated this before Hypnotica's indie pop rock suggestions...

**NotWith10000Men** (3): since when does brendan sound exactly like the guy from fall out boy in $20?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): both the song and the movie its attached to are incredibly overrated

**TiltControls** (3): I'm not usually a huge fan of P!atD so I was surprised I liked V&V as much as I did. This however... does not really fall into that grouping. Something about Brendon Urie's voice leaves me disconnected sometimes and that is definitely true whenever I listen to this song.

**fadedblue09** (2.5): I'm afraid I don't get Panic, even though I like most of their pop-punk peers.

**team\_kockroach** (2.5): The fast-forward line is just so...slimy

**astrologicalangel** (2): one of my least favorite P!atD songs

**chillbumps5** (2): brendon urie

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): speaking of which. spencer was always my favorite.

**joshually** (1): it’s just not it for me

**LuisEnRod** (1): (this is what I describe as “teen movie rock music”)

Eliminated men count: 18

First some FAQs: yes, that IS Brendan Urie singing on this and yes, that ending IS abrupt but that's because this song leads directly into the next track in the album. (a transition I highly recommend you check out, it's great.) 

Interestingly enough, Fall Out Boy outlasts their peer, P!ATD, in this rate when they couldn't do it in their original rate. It could potentially be that Folie a deux is a grower of an album. It seems like there's dozen of us who have had the album on repeat after Emo Rate 1.5 ended. Still, I think the combination of being men + having the only the first half of a song essentially is what leads to this song's departure in the bottom 10. 

---

## Will stream West Coast Smoker after this

**Roxieloxie** (11): Heres the thing I know I am basically just asking to get my feeling hurt by giving this my 11 in a rate full of main pop girls. But all stars is about redeeming the song you feel was most robbed and honestly, this is it for me. I originally did the emo rate 1.5 to give The (shipped) Gold Standard my 11, and I did but It wasnt until the reveal that I truly truly fell in love with Folie A Deux as an album. The transitions are so so so good. The energy of this song is incredible, I Have 82 scrobbles of this song literally from fall when i first heard this to now, and im convinced had spotify not stopped tracking in November this would've been top 10. From the first line of the song 'Have you Ever Wanted to Disappear' It just goes from there, I've screamed the words to this song at 3am crying not so much from the song but just from the sheer emotion that this song conveys, just truly matches the intensity that i needed at the moment. This is probably going to get destroyed for the fucking outro but, first of all it is not that bad, second, the transition from that into West Coast Smoker makes me want to set myself on fire.

**akanewasright** (10): This is fucking adorable to me for some reason. Emo-rock boys should duet more often. Also YES THE OUTRO IS WEIRD BUT IT MAKES SENSE IF YOU LISTEN TO THE NEXT SONG ON THE ALBUM WITH IT

**celladonn** (10): Every second of this slaps including the 30 seconds at the end of Pete Wentz doing slam poetry while pots and pans clang in the background

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fuck paramore

**mysario** (10): have you ever wanted to disappear

**runaway3212** (10): slaps

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): underrated!! I really liked this when it was released and deemed a step down for FOB. The whole album is so anthemic and theatrical.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i’ll still never forgive y’all for how you treated folie during the emo 1.5 rate i hate all of you

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Singlehandedly taught me how to distinguish Brendon Urie and Patrick Stump’s voices. But man…even I, a card-carrying Fall Out Boy fan, can’t give this a 10 – the main part is incredible but I just can’t take the ending 30 seconds of this song seriously. Get a journal, Pete!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): This really does feel like a great blend of FOB and Panic's sounds. That outro is awful tho...

**anothertown** (9): im already embarrassed about everyone who is going to hate this,

**TiltControls** (9): what paramore did during that rate was criminal. How did FOB's best album not even make it past the top 7????

**waluigiest** (9): an incredible collaboration

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): love that call and response effect in the chorus! This was a 9 but I bumped it down because the weirdness at the end is very unpleasant.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): I didn't give this song a fair shake in its first rate, I didn't even realize that Brendon was on the song! Speaking of which, ME! probably would've been way better if Taylor featured Patrick instead of Brendon

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Back at a time where their lyrics were cohesive! Kinda.

**ManofOranges** (8): OK I was absolutely sold on this song as soon as I heard the horns during the chorus. In my mind, horns in a song can do no wrong. And then the last 30 seconds of this song just decided to exist, and that brought this song down by 2 points. I don't know what was up with that, but I could've done without it.

**musical\_pyn** (8): yep, this sure is a fall out boy song

**pebbleheights** (8): If I were 12 I would have given this my 11.

**rickikardashian** (8): the way this ends still bothers me. I'm not talking about the weird ass outro, i mean the "have you ever wanted to disappear". couldn't they have giving me an actual ending to song instead of just not playing anymore?

**skargardin** (8): banger

**steelstepladder** (8): This is like if new Panic! at the Disco was good

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**bbfan132** (7.5): kind of reminds me of weezer

**kappyko** (7.5): I SAIIIIII

**nightjesus** (7.5): oh that’s the ending that through me off. I was like damn this song has a weird beginning. Shows how much I listened to this song off this album I guess lel.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): I totally forgot brendon urie did vocals on this song lol

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): me getting nostalgic about Folie era like: Please take me back

**igorwithlicor** (7): Not my type of music, but I don't wanna give it a lower grade because it's not bad per se

**nooodisaster** (7): That outro was kinda weird, huh?

**notnotamotmot** (7): As much as I didn't like them at the time, I think Fall Out Boy will hold up better than most of the late 2000s angsty bands.

**racloves** (7): I remember being 14 and emo and being bullied at school

**ReallyCreative** (7): I love this kind of Matt & Kim production nonsense but the ad libs are grating and the sudden ending to the song is a choice. Overall though, this still blows anything they've done in the past decade out of the water

**SmileAndTears** (7): Does this feature Brendon Urie? This literally sounds like him wtf

**wryn\_** (7): I thought the only FOB song i'd ever like would be that 100 gecs remix but this is really fun

Eliminated men count: 23

I will be the first to say Imagine Dragons is wayyyyy too overhated but even I think this song is just okay. Surprisingly, it seems to have quite a lot of fans and did quite well in the beginning, but that couldn't save its placement as more ballots came in. 

---

## Maybe men made some points

**pantomime15** (11): It's Time by Imagine Dragons is such an amazing song. The mandolins in the intro gives off such nostalgic vibes. Fun fact: this song makes use of the Indian instrument called Sitar. The louder guitars towards the outro is the highlight of the song. Lead singer Dan Reynolds wrote this song in his kitchen at a time when he was suffering from depression. It's a really uplifting song and one of the best hits of the 2010s that propelled Imagine Dragons to the mainstream.

**astrologicalangel** (10): I cannot explain my choices, I just know I love this song

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Ugh it takes me back to my tumblr days, brb gonna mess with the code of my theme

**hikkaru** (10): so nostalgic, imagine dragons OVERHATED!!! PERIOD!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ngl I think they peaked with this song even though this was their first big song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When people say that Imagine Dragons is the worst band ever, they got to get off their fucking high horse and look me in the eyes and tell me this does not absolutely go the fuck off

**ManofOranges** (10): This song nearly got my 11 in the rate it was in. I understand some people find it annoying. The lyrics, for instance, aren't exactly groundbreaking, talking about "it's time." It's not like that's something no one's heard before. But it fulfills the need within me to be hopeful about both my future and my present. Listening to this song, I feel secure in being who I am in a way that is unique to this song. So I guess I've somehow attached some pretty meaningless of "It's time" and "I'm never changing who I am" to something a lot more meaningful to myself, and as a result, the song has managed to establish itself as a font of hope for me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): whatever this is good idc

**nooodisaster** (10): Literally got me through my trauma-inducing senior year.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): as the only person who likes imagine dragons, unironically, i want to take this time to defend them. their music gets a bad rap, and some of it deserves that, because it's stadium rock car commercial music that sounds like it was made in a lab specifically to torture retail workers. i'm pretty sure people who worked at sears when this song came out deserve reparations from the band. but listen. they make good music, and they don't seem to suck as people. check out at least one of their non single tracks and see what i mean!

**Roxieloxie** (10): Oh hey this is from my rate, what a time to be alive, the pandemic had just started, plug was done, i was stressed over trying to do art classes online, truly nothing has changed. I dont really have anything to say about this I just think its neat

**runaway3212** (10): I'm full with nostalgia for this song I don't care it's going out day 1 it's so good

**TiltControls** (10): Imagine Dragon songs have come and gone and still this is somehow their best track (though On Top of the World and The Fall both make points)

**timothy444** (10): "Radioactive" if it was actually good

**bulforster** (9): I feel the need to do affirmative action for these men to counteract their bad rap because this is a good song!!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): When Imagine Dragons was still good, this was my shit.

**izeasklapaucius** (9): This is probably one of two ID songs that I can say I really like.

**nightjesus** (9): I actually love this song as it helped me through a weird time in my life. Also when I hear this song I feel inspired to push at my goals harder. Look it’s just an inspiring song for me I love it.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): i know Imagine Dragons are #cringe now or whatever but this is such a nostalgic classic for me

**1998tweety** (8.5): This bops hard.

**akanewasright** (8.5): There was another song on the radio that sounded exactly like the verses of this, but WAY fucking worse. Anyway I’m giving this a high score to spite Best Day of My Life by American Authors.

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): oh me oh my, not me giving an Imagine Dragons the same score as a Carly song. I will bash Thunder, Demons and Believer cause they deserve it. But when Dan Reynolds really put his passion to it, he made an incredible song that feels emotionally resonant just on the sound alone. This song could’ve been about papayas and I would still stand by this an emotionally compelling song.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8.5): now i'll tell you what we're not going to do and that's slight these talented if somewhat vanilla m*n

**jsonphile** (8.5): hey remember when imagine dragons were good?

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i wonder how many middle school glee clubs did a medley of this and "cups (when i'm gone)" in 2013

**twat\_brained** (8.4): okay. this song is still sensational. ID though? pass.

**frogaranaman** (8): lowkey this album goes hard asf🥶

**musical\_pyn** (8): It's really weird to listen to this song knowing what path imagine dragons eventually goes down, because I really like this kind of sound from them and wish they kept the brighter, fun accompaniments of this rather than just being aggravating

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I'm sorry but the chorus is like crack to me

**slimboyfriend** (8): yes this is their only good song because it appeared in one of the movies in which Emma Watson played an American teen

**Vultuxe** (8): I really liked this way back when.

**Stryxen** (7.9): potential sex playlist

**bespectacIed** (7): there's something about straight people music I pretended to like when I wasn't out yet that still bangs to this day. Stockholm syndrome

**CreepyMannequin** (7): Brave move to submit Imagine Dragons to a rate where they’ll inevitably get dunked on. Respect.

cremeebrulee: ## Misandrists

**fadedblue09** (7): I feel like any Imagine Dragons hit song is just zero bait tbh. Should've picked a deep cut so that no can pull that "overplay" card.

**kappyko** (7): imagine dragon deez nuts across your face

**lillipup03** (7): This would be better if they didn't try to turn it into a rock song at the end.

**LuisEnRod** (7): (I remember being young and hopeful when this song came out... things have changed)

**rslashpoopheads** (7): very average, probably like the 7th best song on the album

**skargardin** (7): sometimes i wonder where they went

**SmileAndTears** (7): Gneh, it's fine. Doesn't really invoke any emotion in me but I see what it's trying to do

**steelstepladder** (7): Probably their best song? The bar aint high though

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): As far as Imagine Dragons songs go it's alright, but that's not very far overall

**bbfan132** (6): it’s not as bad as i thought it would be but it’s still not my thing

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): i feel like i'm listening to several ads

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Honestly, out of all Imagine Dragons song that could be picked, they really should've just gone with a Bastille one.

**igorwithlicor** (6): I didn't even realize it was playing

**J\_Toe** (6): someone remind me, what does this song sound like? I think a combination of American Authors and Love Story by T Swift

**jasannn** (6): not bad but I can't listen to this song without cringing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): maybe if this wasn’t overplayed i’d give it a higher score

**waluigiest** (6): it’s fine

**wryn\_** (6): Omg congrats imagine dragons for coming 60th place!

**plastichaxan** (5.5): zzzz glee version superior

**team\_kockroach** (5.5): Is anyone else bothered by how simple the instrumental is? Try harder, Imagine Dragons. Dan can’t carry you all

**cherryices** (5.3): innocuous enough but very earnest in a way that i’m not fond of

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5): my dad really likes this song and that's all I will say about it

**sirpancakeXI** (5): just another generic imagine dragon song

**vayyiqra** (5): boring

**seanderlust** (4.8): not me mixing up this song and that one that's like "I had a dream I could touch the clouds wo-o-o-o-o-oah"

**jackisboredtoday** (4.3): I actually kinda like Night Visions but I always found this song to be so cloying

**cocosairdep** (4): Imagine Dargons?? Don’t have time for this, I’m gay

**moonagenightmares** (4): alexa define mediocrity

**notnotamotmot** (4): This is the most palatable of Imagine Dragons songs. Sounds like empty, soulless Christian Rock.

**nowqueenofpop** (4): Imagine Dragons aren't /that/ bad but this isn't good

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): You can tell me this is a Bleachers song and I'll believe you

**jayjaysortagay** (3): 🥱

**joshually** (3): Is he actually just yelling this song out loud from somewhere remote?

**ReallyCreative** (3): to mute the plug

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3): at least there's a catchy chorus but the verses are so grating

**bookthieving** (2): my high school graduating class did a lip dub to this song so i have to rate this low due to the residual cringe from participating in that

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Coincidentally this song played at work today (as in the day I’m typing up this score) and it made me remember just how much I dislike this song, it’s everything that’s wrong with commercial pop-rock. You can’t understand any of the lyrics, it’s calibrated to just be vaguely positive background noise. Corporate music.

**AHSWeeknd** (1): I don’t know why I find most of these groups to be Coldplay-but-less-creative, I never got the hype.

**Kimchiprince** (1): Nut

**zagreux** (1): ew m*n. why is the lead singer screaming so much?

**DaHumanTorch** (0): I. HATE. This. Song. The instrumentation is so bad and so annoying and it makes me want to throw myself off a cliff every time I listen

**nootnoot781** (0): so my hatred for imagine dragons manages to top my hatred for cLOSER… interesting

**pat-rickstar** (0): Calling it now that this, Fall Out Boy, OneRepublic and Panic! all go out day 1

**s4mmymusic** (0): this is an imagine dragons hate account

King Princess' performance in her rate was understandably lackluster. Her album just wasn't strong enough to go up against Sigrid's and Maggie Rogers'. Hit the Back, however, was a worthy contender which I thought could manage third place. When it left a little too early, it was an easy All Stars submission. I do like this song, but I fear that it's a bit out of its league here. It's a bop for sure but I think no one will mind this song's exit rounding out our bottom 10.

## Thicc bitches

**Awkward\_King** (10): i have a lot of close 11 contenders in this rate but this song is just so perfect to me. it's so seamless but also raw, unabashedly queer ("staring at my fingers while i talk to you"), so fun.

**Kimchiprince** (10): hit me each way this song is amazing

**TragicKingdom1** (10): if a gay man sang these lyrics this song would go #1 on the popheads charts

**steelstepladder** (9.5): This is gonna be robbed I feel it

**hikkaru** (9): honey this record is a thicc queen

**nooodisaster** (9): BOPS BOUT BOTTOMING

**notnotamotmot** (9): I dunno. The buildup in this song just does something to me that I'll never get tired of. It just feels so good.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I don't like King Princess but we have to give her credit with this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): King Princess may be an industry plant or whatever but her music is actually pretty good, the lyrics of this one are kinda… obvious? But the chorus is fun. If the production were a bit more focused I think this could have been an even bigger bop though.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): It's no Ohio or Ain't Together but it's good

**Stryxen** (8.5): she made this song and then somehow got cancelled (!?) for being bad in bed. anyway i’d probably give this a 10 but I hate how she rhymes respect with pet

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): I kind of forgot this song existed but it’s good

**1998tweety** (8): The chorus on this is almost amazing, really could've been a 10.

**anothertown** (8): Miss Macys’ only good song and it’s a complete bop as well

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): lots of valid criticisms of the macy's heiress but this slaps idc

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I had to go on Genius because I honestly didn’t understand this song, and all I got was ‘She first teased the song on Twitter as “the anthem for bottoms everywhere”.’ which means it’ll probably be top10 or some shit. Bop your bussies out or something.

**pebbleheights** (8): The vocals and the lyrics are so satisfying, I really enjoy this one.

**rickikardashian** (8): still thinking about the time someone said that if Christine and the Queens grew her hair out and was more boring she’d be King Princess

**skargardin** (8): banger!

**static\_int\_husp** (8): While KP was robbed (probably justly) in this rate, this song is still a dance pop banger

**timothy444** (8): Never heard this before until today but I'm liking it.

**twat\_brained** (8): this is one of maybe 4 KP songs I don't mind all that much

**zagreux** (8): wow this is nice

**kappyko** (7.5): prophet deserved its place but alas popheads is bottoms

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): This song can hit the back (of my rate scores)

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Her voice is perfect.

**akanewasright** (7): Neat.

**bbfan132** (7): the chorus is fun but the song in general leaves something to be desired, even if it’s pretty good

**igorwithlicor** (7): I don't have much of an opinion. It didn't work for me but it was also not horrible so there you go

**musical\_pyn** (7): I really like the sound of the intro, but once it ends the song becomes a little more generic. I think the song could have worked, it just…doesn’t as much as I want it to

**nightjesus** (7): oooh I haven’t heard this before this is a little bop!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): horny rights!!

**waluigiest** (7): hope y’all are getting real horny for my record cuz I spent all morning listening to some final ass mixes and honey this record is a thicc queen. I can’t wait to give it to ya.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): honey this record is a thicc queen

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): I should like this more, I've just never been able to get into her music

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): kinda boring but pleasant enough i guess

cremeebrulee: ## Virgins

**fadedblue09** (6): I like her voice but this is really generic.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is better than i remember tbh

**team\_kockroach** (6): Repeats the chorus a little too much, and the instrumental isn’t too strong

**vayyiqra** (6): Most of her music is really boring but this is okay

**wryn\_** (6): The chorus and the beat are really good but i just think the verses have no energy at all

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): mid the back

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): This song played and I didn't even realize it was over.

**frogaranaman** (5): me to any hot bear in a five mile radius

**ManofOranges** (5): I did give this a 10 in the rate this song was in, but that was an act of charity and King Princess needed it in that rate. This song, I will admit, is cute, but as well know, when cute is next to gorgeous, gorgeous is gonna, you know, devour cute. And right now cute is surrounded by at least 30 other gorgeous songs.

Eliminated men count: 24

This song did pretty well for itself considering it was one of our many meme songs! A lot of people agree that it's unironically a bop but also that the meme around it is just wholesome, if a bit overdone. It's probably that fact that led to this song departing at a decent 50th place. 

---

## Never gonna let you down

**1998tweety** (10): An actual masterpiece, I'm so glad when songs that are actually good become viral memes. We love a vocal king who serves choreo and a good message.

**bbfan132** (10): unironically love this

**CreepyMannequin** (10): SAW are unironically some of the most underrated producers in music history

**frogaranaman** (10): the perfect meme

**hunnybee12** (10): happy 55th birthday king!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): internet king!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): its the smasha

**jasannn** (10): I lowkey want to add this to my playlists just to rick roll myself. Anyways, this genuinely a great song.

**ManofOranges** (10): I find it astounding how, even though memes seems to age like milk and in a quarter of the time, this song and the concept of rick-rolling have somehow persevered. Maybe it's just because of the simple but elegant idea of simply doing a bait and switch with this song, or maybe it's the great opening--whatever the case may be, I'm greatful that I get to be around to appreciate this song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): now this is an unironic 10

**MrSwearword** (10): Even I can see the use in this song

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): the only acceptable score for this legendary song

**nowqueenofpop** (10): I love 80's music so maybe I'm biased but actually I'm not and this almost got my 11. The longevity... many of our faves could never

**rickikardashian** (10): i know some of yall will give this song a low score because it’s a meme song, but if this was a song sang by a white woman it would have won a rate already (and i know that because heaven is a place on earth won the charity rate)

**Roxieloxie** (10): Yall are gonna rate this out day 1 because yall hate fun but unlike yall i am sexc and have enough taste

**runaway3212** (10): rickrolling aside this is such a sweet song, it makes me feel something weirdly

**timothy444** (10): Memes aside, it's still a bangin' 80s tune!

**twat\_brained** (10): the first time I got the dreaded RickRoll was when I clicked on a link to what I thought was a new iCarly episode. THAT's how old I am.

**vayyiqra** (10): I'm so glad this was a meme because this is an amazing song and Rick Astley seems like a wholesome guy

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): 80s excellence perhaps?

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Even though it’s a meme it’s just so good. Also Rick Astley has great vocals.

**anothertown** (9): This is a bop and I have never been upset to be rickrolled tbh

**bookthieving** (9): genuinely a banger

**celladonn** (9): Always a treat to pay Mr Astley a visit

**cherryices** (9): my mum calls him rick ghastly but this is an eternal bop. never gets old

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): it haunts me man

**racloves** (9): I know it’s like the meme song but I still don’t get tired of hearing it

**bigbigbee** (8.5): What the memers failed to realize is that I actually love this song. Every Rickroll is a nothing more than pleasant surprise. Checkmate!

**bulforster** (8.5): Like a lot of brits, my 2020 started with this song so I'm trying not to hold that against it.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): a genuinely good song, I let myself get rick rolled just so I can listen to it

**yatcho** (8.5): even for a meme this bops

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): meme reputation aside this is just a well-produced SAW song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Is rickrolling even that funny? I don't know. I found it the shit when I was 14, but that can be an argument for both sides.

**hikkaru** (8): overplayed old meme etc etc but can we talk about the fact that it bops

**jsonphile** (8): memes aside, it’s a pretty good song. But it’s not actually anything amazing.

**lillipup03** (8): The meme wouldn't have stuck if it wasn't a great song.

**LuisEnRod** (8): (the Ashley Tisdale cover is better)

**musical\_pyn** (8): A good meme and a good song. The chorus is actually really good, and though the rest of the song isn’t as memorable it still is really great

**nightjesus** (8): I mean every time someone rickrolls me I just get so happy like how can you not groove dance to this?

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): Those drums at the beginning always triggers my fight-or-flight response, but otherwise it's a perfectly good bop

**wryn\_** (7.5): I feel so bad for Rick Astley, he doesn't deserve the involuntary reaction of pure rage I have when I hear the drums in the first second of this

**seanderlust** (7.4): do you know how fucking hard it is to assess this as a standalone piece of music?

**cocosairdep** (7): I’m rating this on his bday so happy birthday Rick!!

**givebackmysweatshirt** (7): not going to pretend that this isn't unironically a bop, but it is overshadowed in this rate

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): the most wholesome meme out there, pure 80s pop

**igorwithlicor** (7): It is very catchy ngl, but I would never listen it on my own

**izeasklapaucius** (7): SAW's best work is still with Kylie but this is nice, memes aside.

**J\_Toe** (7): trolling aside this is a decent song for what it is. in fact, the first time I heard/saw this song (at a Ten Pin Bowling establishment) I didn't know what "Rick Rolling" was so I just didn't react, and didn't understand why everyone reacted so viscerally.

**skargardin** (7): well

**NFLfreak98** (6.9): nice

Eliminated men count: 39 (HELP)

A track that started off well and then just kept falling until it landed here. A running theme for this day's elimination seems to be the artists who were done especially dirty in their rates. Much like Fall Out Boy and King Princess, BROCKHAMPTON also suffered an early exit in their rate, with this track being their last one standing. It seems like most BH fans agree this is their weakest album, which can explain its underperformance in both its original rate and this one. But I can't deny this track is so smooth and just adorable? Perhaps the Dua Lipa remix would've been able to survive today's elimination, since y'all love to mention that it outsold.

## Ariana Grande - sweetener

**bbfan132** (10): viral kings

**camerinian** (10): Brockhampton are pop icons, these boys have hooks for days, and this is one of their dreamiest songs of the whole Bearface era. It's just a magic song that was rightfully their biggest hit (stream BOOGIE though)

**frogaranaman** (10): obligatory 10 since it’s the Pollen rate entry and y’all slaughtered BROCKHAMPTON too much in that rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when this was about to be a hit and then billboard said “erm, no more UGC for you guys lol” and it flopped

**jasannn** (10): amazing chorus

**ManofOranges** (10): In this song's rate, I was very torn on what to give SUGAR because I went back and forth pretty regularly on what I thought about it. Over time, I have come to really like this song, if not just accept its imperfections and embrace the aspects that I do like. It's not a perfect song, but it's good enough for me.

**musical\_pyn** (10): One of the best hooks/choruses I have ever heard, and the rest of the song is really good as well

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I love both versions of this song

**timothy444** (10): I don’t usually like rap music but this song, is simply amazing and the acoustic-y instrumentation adds to that!

**bookthieving** (9): a sweet, chill bop. the hook is excellent

**1998tweety** (8.5): Dua saved this

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): Dom’s verse brings down the song.

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): I've heard this song only once before but it exudes a lot of queer energy.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I can’t wait for the controversy score of this one.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I know Brockhampton is not well-liked, at least on Twitter. But like...this is such a good song omg. I am so sorry ksdfljkljfsd.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): dua remix outsold ... also justice for Ladders!!

**RandomHypnotica** (8): Can't wait for this to go out Day 1 because MEN, meanwhile if it was the Dua remix it'd be Day 3

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's a little all over the place for me, but it's pretty good

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The vocals here are great.

**igorwithlicor** (7): Not feeling at all. It's kinda boring, not chill

**J\_Toe** (7): I prefer Kevin's solo stuff

**s4mmymusic** (7): i was supposed to see brockhampton on this tour with my friend (i was only going for 100 gecs opening) and then she got the flu right before so i had to sell my ticket 😭

**skargardin** (7): cute

**twat\_brained** (7): I learned from Genius' Behind the Lyrics segment that a certain actor heavily inspired this song's parent album, which in turn most likely inspired this song. A someone who domestically abused an artist who I deeply admire. If I hadn't known that this would be a much higher score.

**wryn\_** (7): Why do i actually prefer the dua lipa remix???

**anothertown** (6.5): this softboy music that brockhampton makes now is 100% image rehab click for more

And here we have another track that came from an artist that placed third in their respective rate! While everyone knew that Mitski was going to win the Women Who Rock Rate, most of us also thought Lana would come in with an easy second finish. (After all most fans will say Ultraviolence is one of her best.) Yet, Lana failed to reach the silver when St. Vincent, once again, caused an upset. While the first half of Ultraviolence are some of my favorite songs ever, I could see why to a casual this song just seems long and dull. Shades of Cool is a gorgeous song, but a near 6 minute track was most definitely doomed to stay in Day 1.

## He calls for me ...

**1998tweety** (10): One of my all-time fav Lana songs ugh this is just so damn good. THAT BREAKDOWN good lorde. Everything about this is immaculate. Yall will sabotage this I just know it.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This production is just... how do you create something so phenomenal.

**bbfan132** (10): the second half of this song is glorious

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): Karen's best song tbh

**DaHumanTorch** (10): my favorite Lana del Rey song period, and honestly one of my favorite songs ever. The guitar solo….I ascend every time

**endcreditouilles** (10): the closest to Lana making a bond song we'll ever get, please let this comment age like milk

**hikkaru** (10): my fave lana song

**igorwithlicor** (10): Feels very Jame Bond like, which is what I've always thought her sound should be like

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song really took some time to grow on me, but once it did, it REALLY hit

**rickikardashian** (10): this song reminds me of a dude i used to flirt with when i was 15. he did cocaine, ghosted me, and made me cry every time I heard this song and florida kilos. i hope he's doing well

**Vultuxe** (9.5): A contender for one of her best songs... it defines the Ultraviolence era.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.4): lana racist MAGA anti-masker cop lover etc etc but this song is great

**akanewasright** (8.5): I hate that I still love this song

**TiltControls** (8.5): Ethereal and dreamy vocals make this one of Lana's best outputs

**seanderlust** (8.2): it's hard for me to choose between ultraviolence and NFR for my favorite project of lana's. this is one of the better ones from UV though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the only good lana del rey song

**vayyiqra** (8): Pretty good but there are better songs on Ultraviolence

**waluigiest** (8): this was one of my favorite albums I am so sad.

**jsonphile** (7.5): sweet guitar solo

**twat\_brained** (7.1): question for the culture, should I watch the video? I know one was filmed but I just never bothered to watch it so I'm not sure if I'm missing out

**lillipup03** (7): I'm not usually a huge fan of Lana's music, but her vocals are so pretty in this one.

**ManofOranges** (7): Like most Lana songs, this one is just kind of boring to me. But this one has got some more interesting stuff going on than a lot of her others, so that's a plus.

**musical\_pyn** (7): I like the more mature sound of Lana’s later stuff but this is still goo

**NotWith10000Men** (7): love the chorus, verses need more

**runaway3212** (7): not my favourite lana song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): "Shades of Cool" is an apt name for this, as there's hints of an interesting sound going on here, but the song itself drags for me. I still don't like Ultraviolence as much as I wanted to when it was released, after being a big stan of Born to Die.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): One of the best from Ultraviolence, no doubt

**bespectacIed** (6): one of her only 3 good songs alongside Off to the Races and Happiness is a butterfly

=====

cremeebrulee: ## ... and not for you

**racloves** (6): not as cool as cool

**ReallyCreative** (6): This song goes back and forth between being one of my favorite Lana Del Reycist songs and an absolute disaster. The strings? Her soft wails in the chorus? Iconic. Her baby voice immediately after? Not so much. Overall it feels like a missed opportunity and the song never quite does it for me.

**s4mmymusic** (6): zzz

**Stryxen** (6): would have given west coast a 10

**astrologicalangel** (5.5): I know this is not a popular opinion but this is one of the worst tracks on UV

**wryn\_** (5.5): Watch the same people that have dragged lana every day for the past month let this land in the top 10 lol. Memes aside it's pretty boring

**FKJVMMP** (5): This song was clearly made to play over scenes of movie villains falling to their deaths in slow motion.

**hunnybee12** (5): i love ultraviolence but i can never sit through this whole song

**SmileAndTears** (5): i sleep

**steelstepladder** (5): Just don't like you Lana... despite the pretty kick ass guitar solo

**team\_kockroach** (4.5): Prechorus sounds wack

**bulforster** (4): Were they trying to drown her in all that reverb?

**CrimsonROSET** (4): Everytime I see a Lana song that's longer than 5 minutes I feel mean because I always don't like them and am gonna get dragged in the comments, but like. If you're gonna write a 5 minute song, maybe have 5 minutes of material? It only scored as high as 5 because of the cool guitar section thing.

**nightjesus** (4): Just as I was about to write that this was actually a really beautiful vocal take on Lana, the chorus hit. Oh dear. That chorus was overpowering and really room me into if the vibe it was getting me in. The guitars also get too much in that bridge. And then that energy just goes in that last chorus like I thought we were ending then that build up just leaves? What?

**pat-rickstar** (4): This is dull and weirdly mixed

**rslashpoopheads** (3): ?

**zagreux** (2.5): this is a snoozefest

**frogaranaman** (2): blegh

**joshually** (2): this sounds …. Not good

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): This album did not deserve to be rated alongside Puberty 2 and Strange Mercy.

**fadedblue09** (1): This was my zero in its rate and honestly? I do not regret it at all. I fail to see what’s so pleasurable about this. Sorry Lana stans.

**pebbleheights** (1): eh :/

**Roxieloxie** (1): please stop making me rate these slow ass 6 minute lana songs

**timothy444** (1): this song sucks and is boring

**ignitethephoenix** (0): girl what are these vocals....not all star quality that’s for sure. Also the guitar over her vocals just sounds mixed so bad wtf...I sometimes like Lana’s music but this is not one of those times

What the fuck was the Hyperpop Rate even? I don't think half of us understood the elimination order at all and along that line, why was Slayyyter done so dirty? You would think /r/popheads would eat up this type of music but it seems like we don't seem to care for it.~Anyway while we're here, sis can you change the album cover for Troubled Paradise btw? Thanks.~

---

## Slayyyter: oh me oh my 

**Awkward\_King** (10): OH ME OH MY

**bbfan132** (10): deserved better in its rate

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i will NEVER forgive this sub for not making this at least top 3 in the hyperpop rate, a literal hate crime against infatuated gays

**hikkaru** (10): slayyyter flopping in the hyperpop rate was the most surprising thing tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (10): when this gets higher than stupid horse this time round as it should 😍

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Slayyyter really got done SO dirty in this rate, i hope we don't do the same here

**s4mmymusic** (10): bottom anthem

**seanderlust** (10): after rating this the first song, this is the song that really kicked off a full OBSESSION with slayyyter. for that reason, it gets a 10. slayyyter for president.

**twat\_brained** (10): look day 3 is Valentine's Day which means it's this song's 2nd anniversary so let's do something nice for Slayyyter and make this day 3. If you can't do that then at least please pre-order Troubled Paradise.

**vayyiqra** (10): We need more Y2K pop that's as good as this

**nightjesus** (9.5): I don’t know why I was expecting Mine by Taylor Swift. This is so good and of course is it’s Slayyyter bitch.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): The lyric may be a little bit repetitive but i love it anyways

**plastichaxan** (9.3): not the best use of “oh me oh my” in a song but still amazing

**1998tweety** (9): bopt

**Brendon-Urine** (9): This was my favorite Slayyyter song until Troubled Paradise came out.

**bulforster** (9): This is great but I like my Slayyyter songs more aggresive(ly horny).

**lillipup03** (9): Rina? Is that you? oh me, oh my...

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): i miss going out clubbing with my friends ugh

**camerinian** (8.5): I can't believe this song hasn't existed since the 90s

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): She saved house music. Jessie Ware who?

**AHSWeeknd** (8): a bop.

**frogaranaman** (8): slayyyter was ROBBED

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): A bit basic, like this does feel a bit “Garageband,” but you know what? If you can make that sound good then I have nothing to complain about.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is kinda a bop

**J\_Toe** (8): honestly sounds like the album Britney would have released in 2018 if her life took a different direction

**jasannn** (8): reminds me of sour candy

**LuisEnRod** (8): (come on Gen Z Britney give us everything!)

**MrSwearword** (8): it's a shame that a racist former Camila Cabello stan account of an artist got a beat this sick

**musical\_pyn** (8): this got me to listen to troubled paradise so it immediately gets an extra point—slayyyter just does a rally great job with this kind of sound

**ReallyCreative** (8): Alexa play the oh me oh my song. No, the other one.

**slimboyfriend** (8): It kinda sounds like Sonic music

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): -2 for making me support racism

**Vultuxe** (8): I'm confused about Slayyyter, she has obviously had her antics so stanning her is going to be awkward for the rest of time but this song is a genuinely good bop.

**Stryxen** (7.9): this has grown on me considerably oh me oh my

**bespectacIed** (7): controversial but this is cute

**CrimsonROSET** (7): that beat is extremely basic but she carries it, you go girl

cremeebrulee: ## Rina: oh me oh my

**igorwithlicor** (7): It's catchy but I feel like it's missing something to really work for me

**nooodisaster** (7): Really nice generic song

**timothy444** (7): hyperpop at its most basic

**waluigiest** (7): she wants what Rina has

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): it’s definitely no XS (Breemix) but a good “oh me oh my” still works

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.7): rina outsold

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): noah fence but this sounds like a Disney channel star debut single from 2010

**yatcho** (6.5): ok I love miss oh me oh my but she's simply out of her depth in this rate

**notnotamotmot** (6): Not my favorite Slayyyter song, but it's fine.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I didn't know she made this kind of music. Neat

**skargardin** (6): arguably the best of its rate but as a winner among winners..

**akanewasright** (5): Overplayed and overdone

**ManofOranges** (5): I was never a fan of this song. I don't think it's completely awful or anything, but I just never saw what others saw in it. It's too hectic, too frenetic for me.

**SmileAndTears** (5): Y'all listen to this? It's so lifeless and joyless for what's supposed to be a fun little dance pop number

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): oh me oh my i dont wanna hear no no only want a yes yes oh me oh my

**runaway3212** (4): I just don't love slayyyter

**flavasavavandal** (2.5): Britney clone is kinda soulless

**fadedblue09** (2): Is she one of Britney's ghost singers

**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): if i'm going to listen to a racist then i expect the music to actually be good

**pebbleheights** (2): oh me ooohhh oh oh oh me oh yea I wanna make you mine oh me oh my ohh ohhhhh ooooohhh oh oh

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): again, i don't get it.

Clairo was a newcomer to the Queer Pop Rate last year and with that in mind, she did pretty well! While Bags was always in the bronze spot, it seems like it has a pretty decently sized fanbase that is excited to see where she goes next. Unfortunately, we couldn't let her do any better than Day 1 in this rate. Sorry, [Shura](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/jhz1t3/2019_queer_pop_rate_reveal_day_3_oh_my_god_like/geev44g/) maybe MUNA will have some more luck.

## Gay rights!
**bbfan132** (10): deserved to win the queer pop rate

**bespectacIed** (10): industry plant gave us excellence here, why lie

**MrSwearword** (10): surprising triumph here

**RandomHypnotica** (10): A lot of Immunity is largely forgettable but nice Soft Indie Rock, but Bags will always be a career highlight for Clairo, it's just a beautiful song through and through

**rickikardashian** (10): never getting over the disrespect shown to clairo in this rate. this will murdered in the rate, and that’s why once this sub gets shut down, im not going to cry over it

**runaway3212** (10): Very pretty

**s4mmymusic** (10): any questions ?

**useless-sheep** (10): if clairo is an industry plant i will water her

**NFLfreak98** (9.8): just absolutely bops

**team\_kockroach** (9.5): No wonder it's such a Pitchfork darling

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): loooove the 90s alt feel more than i love a lot of actual 90s alt

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I should really get into Clario because I like this!

**twat\_brained** (9): see I may not be her biggest fan but I like Clairo because she's just being her adorable little twenty something self here

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Clairo deserved better this rate

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): is this from the perspective of seeing your partner walking out with their bags because they’re just going to the store to the store

**fadedblue09** (8): Ugh I really wanna like her more since she's one of the few Gen Z Kids that listen to Norah Jones. Maybe once she gets through her emo girl phase and adopts a more mature approach I'll consider stanning. Loved Alewife though.

**igorwithlicor** (8): Chill and vibey, I like it

**seanderlust** (8): this song absolutely nails what it feels like to have a crush on someone while you're in the closet

**timothy444** (8): I love the way this piano sounds

**waluigiest** (8): it’s a cute bop

**worlds-okayest666** (8): very cute song but i do think it could have been cut down to 3 minutes without much being lost

**steelstepladder** (7.5): Sophia deserved

**Stryxen** (7.5): but it’s not sof11a :/

**akanewasright** (7): This is cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is nice but it doesn’t need to be this long.

**nightjesus** (7): The queen of bedroom pop. This is neat. Feels like a song that you’d listen to during a summer road trip.

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's nice, but I don't know if there's anything exceptional about this song that separates it from the rest of this acoustic bedroom-pop-esque alternative sound that is really prominent right now

**static\_int\_husp** (7): Honestly, I know this is basically Clairo's signature song at this point, and it's fine, but I still don't see what a lot of people do in it.

**Vultuxe** (7): I liked it? It's dreampop-y sort of. I like that.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): forgettable

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): This song (and Clairo's music in general) would get bashed if it were by a male artist. Her music is uninteresting in every way when it comes to indie/alternative and this song is the definition of white bread

**givebackmysweatshirt** (6): the industry plant made some points w this one, but not too many.

**jasannn** (6): Sofia is better.

**lillipup03** (6): While I have your attention, Softly is the best song on Immunity and I would've given it a ten.

**ManofOranges** (6): Sorry to Clairo, but I still really don't care about this song. Sofia has grown on me more since that rate than this song because this song doesn't really leave me anything that I can truly enjoy. Sofia, in all of its ordered chaos, has moments of brilliance. This song just has moments of boredom, essentially.

**musical\_pyn** (6): I want to like this more? I think? Just not for me

**hikkaru** (3): clairo so boring im sorry

It's Charli baby ... did any of you expect to see a sub favorite this soon? I sort of did, after seeing Number 1 Angel kinda flop in its rate. Her highest ranking track "Lipgloss" stayed Day 1 for most of its run since it seems like a lot of people liked either Charli's verse or CupcakKe's, but not both. I will say, this track grew on me immensely since its rate and I wished it could have fared a bit better! No worries though, since sis still has another collaboration in the running for All Stars.

## SEPHORA 

**bulforster** (11): Where is Duck Duck Goose?? This song is fine too I guess

**celladonn** (11): I was tempted to give stupid horse my 11 but it really had to be this. Phenomenal production

**pat-rickstar** (11): I wrote a comment about how I wish I had a second 11 I could give to this song and then changed my mind, L1pg1oss it is. The instrumental is total ear candy, the hook is so sticky, Cupcakke's verses are incredible. RIP SOPHIE

**akanewasright** (10): I love Charli and Cupcakke

**anothertown** (10): BRING 100 GIRLS TO THE ROOM!

**bbfan132** (10): cupcakke did that

**bespectacIed** (10): Cupcakke could write hamlet but shakespeare could not write "Never trust a man who wear briefs / Cuz he's gonna wanna fuck and keep it brief / Call again when you need somethin to eat / So I could open my legs, bon appetit" .... UPDATE: REST IN PARADISE SOPHIE

**Brendon-Urine** (10): man. N1A is solidly a tier or two below pop 2 for me, but this song... what a song. that's all you can say. rip SOPHIE.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): CALL AGAIN WHEN YOU NEED SOMETHING TO EAT SO I CAN OPEN MY LEGS BON APPETIT

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): WHEN WE HAVE SEX FUCK ME LIKE YOU OBSESSED ORDER YOU PUSSY FOR YOUR LUNCH AND MAKE YOU WEAR A HAIR NET / FREAKY LOVE BITCH WHEN I’M OUT WITH CHARLI YEAH WE GET MORE EYES ON US THAN THE SHOW ICARLY / BAD BITCH MAKE IT SO YOU CAN’T GET OVER ME i don’t know what she says at this point OVARY / I’M TALKING EVERY DAY YOU GON’ WANT HIT ON THIS / SO STICKY WINNIE THE POOH AIN’T GOT SHIT ON THIS

**hikkaru** (10): cupcakke is amazing here and the production during charli's parts is crack infused, sophie did that 💔

**ManofOranges** (10): Seeing this wind up the highest rated song off of Number 1 Angel--by a pretty wide margin no less--was actually pretty surprising, but not undeserved. Thanks to Cupcakke this song is a wild ride from beginning to end. Honestly, this is more so Cupcakke's song than it ever was Charli's. I kind of wish that Charli was just completely cut out of the song so I could've had a third and maybe even a fourth verse from Cupcakke because that's how much she makes this song. And, of course, she gets bonus points for the "iCarly" lyrics. Pure genius.

**plastichaxan** (10): one of her best, sophie's production and cupcakke's verse add so much too

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): a winning combination

**runaway3212** (10): OHH DAMM THE FLAVOUR FLAVOUR SO GOOD YEAH

**s4mmymusic** (10): i turned 18 in quarantine and you might have to be 21 to go but i want to hear this in a club so bad idk if this even would work in a club but like make it happen

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I honestly love this song so much. Miss cupcakKe need to collab with charli more

**skargardin** (10): pensive

**steelstepladder** (10): I saw this performed live and they were both great. God I miss live music

**Stryxen** (10): give me another 11 please !! my pussy is too brave to only have one !!

**teenage\_meme** (10): this is what "woohoo" wishes it was. it's charli baby

**Vultuxe** (10): Definitely the most iconic song on Number 1 Angel.

**waluigiest** (10): this song is hot

**worlds-okayest666** (10): the outro is transcendent

**yatcho** (10): RIP Sophie

**seanderlust** (9.6): ....."pussy gooey like yolk before the egg scrambled".......

**camerinian** (9.5): I wish more songs had the balls to drop everything they're doing and just let Cupcakke be horny for a hot minute

**slimboyfriend** (9.2): The lyric "Come get you a sample/Lick between the camel/Pussy taste sweet cuz I ate my pineapples" to this beat is high literature in the realm of pop, but just another great bar from Cupcakke

**rickikardashian** (9.1): https://media1.tenor.com/images/82771b8eafc05a05e3cd1c625566749c/tenor.gif?itemid=5960917

**static\_int\_husp** (9): writing comments for this rate on January 30th, RIP SOPHIE, their production on tracks like this was something no one else was doing

**timothy444** (9): What an interesting collaboration. I'm still in awe at how this even exists but here we are. Quite frankly, Cupcakke sounds amazing here and with how sexual it is, it's really worth giving this track a listen even if you hate this kind of stuff. It's just so absurd that that song sticks with you. And also props to the production team (RIP Sophie :sob:) for making this track so incredibly hyperpop-esque.

**zagreux** (9): WHAT DID THEY DO? THAT! WIG SCALPED.

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): So much better than Fancy it's laughable

**AHSWeeknd** (8): A buildup to end all buildups

**Awkward\_King** (8): sex did not exist until december 2017

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is it too late to vote Cupcakke for president

**igorwithlicor** (8): Incredible flow!

**nightjesus** (8): it’s Charrrli baby, hey Cupcakke!

**nooodisaster** (8): Iconic. We love you SOPHIE.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): ugh i love cupcakke

**twat\_brained** (7.6): sticky icky is an icky lyric let's not kid ourselves

**1998tweety** (7.5): one of the few good songs on this album

**J\_Toe** (7): please listen to Lipgloss WAP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4X4Xc7-j1V4

**musical\_pyn** (7): Cupcakke is very hit or miss for me, and unfortunately this is more of a miss for me

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I thought this was Lil Mama for a sec and got really excited...

**TiltControls** (7): cupcakke carries this song

**vayyiqra** (7): Charli's parts being so energetic and then Cupcakke's being half-time never quite worked to me but it's still kind of a banger

=====

cremeebrulee: ## Rite Aid Clearance Section

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): honestly N1A era just isn’t it for me. Cupcakke saves this song with the iCarly line alone

**FKJVMMP** (6): If this was the first time I’d heard a CupcakKe song it’d probably be a 10 but the 100th version of the same song isn’t that interesting even with Charli making it better.

**frogaranaman** (6): the beat switch is always SO jarring

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): it's choli babi

**hunnybee12** (6): as a charli fan i never got the hype for this

**LuisEnRod** (6): (Miss XCX has way better music and y’all know it)

**notnotamotmot** (6): This song has nothing on Lil' Mama.

**ReallyCreative** (6): Angels on this sub really thought this was a top 20 Charli song... fortunately their delusion isn't completely unfounded, as CupcakKe carries this overrated sugar rush mess to a passing grade

**nowqueenofpop** (5.5): Gives us advice like “never trust a man who wears briefs” but then also gives us lines like “used to call you daddy but now I call you my majesty” and for that alone I have to say the lipgloss has dried out

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): The instrumental in Charli's parts sound like something you'd hear in a 2011 Flash Game, and cupcakke's part is alright, but it just feels like a mess of a track

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this is definitely one of the worse songs here imo. I don’t hate it but it’s not great. Cupcakke carries this song

**izeasklapaucius** (5): tbh I don't really care that much about n1a

**jsonphile** (5): I feel like I should like this but sorry it’s just a little much for me

**mynameistoo\_common** (5): I’m sorry I just don’t GET this type of music

**SmileAndTears** (5): No ma'am. No ma'am. NO MA'AM.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): cupcakke feat. charli xcx

**lillipup03** (4): The production during Charli's part is good... everything else is not.

**moonagenightmares** (4): the last 45 seconds of this song are godly, the rest…

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): i don't get it, i think i'm too old.

**flavasavavandal** (2.5): I just very frankly do not like this at all, the extended outro while better than a majority of the song felt unnecessary, cuppcakke is trying way, way, way too hard and comes up with bars like “Never trust a man who wear briefs (briefs) / 'Cause he gon' wanna fuck and keep it brief (brief)” and like am I supposed to be impressed?

**givebackmysweatshirt** (2): i had to take an aspirin just to finish the song

**fadedblue09** (1): Winnie the Pooh does not deserve this slander.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): n e ways

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): help this is awful

**NotWith10000Men** (1): that's certainly a transition

**pebbleheights** (1): All the pieces are here so WHY DON’T I LIKE IT. This collaboration could have been awesome but every time Charli says “sticky icky” I have an allergic reaction. It just feels like a lazier version of Shake It.

**chillbumps5** (0): popheads will find the pettiest most bullshit reason to hate a good song, therefore i do not feel bad nor care about giving this or any of the other songs a bad rating

So who does this sub hate more-- men or POC? If you read that rank graph right, YES this was our in fact, first winner, back when we had two ballots but unfortunately xenophobia has forced this song to keep dropping until its untimely Day 1 exit. This song is so robbed in my opinion. It's so bouncy and fun, who cares if it's not in English? Anyway this deserved better, so fuck y'all.

##  GEE GEE GEE GEE 

**bespectacIed** (11): THE k-pop manifesto. 3-minute cocaine high. The catchiest song of all time in any language. I'll always cherish this song for retroactively introducing me to the genre. But most importantly, this was my homosexuality Turing test: mindless neon-colored bubblegum pop tickled my young brain ✔, and I was attracted not to the nine pretty girls but to SHINee's Minho ✔ (still am, he's 10000% hotter now btw)

**useless-sheep** (11): best song of all time, not really but also yes really. stream tiff https://open.spotify.com/album/5Zf2IZLgKbo9RcktqIQxpU?si=rnJGV5c4Q1SpvfSyaoEtWA

**1998tweety** (10): classic, racism will snub it [2]

**bigbigbee** (10): I STILL know the dance to this. That’s called iconic, ladies.

**bulforster** (10): A song so powerful it broke international barriers.

**celladonn** (10): The first kpop song I ever heard and obviously not the last

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of the most iconic pop songs of all time i think

**CrimsonROSET** (10): This is what I expected 4 walls to sound like, like if someone told me this is the best kpop song I’d at least believe they believe it.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): pt 2 of I’m gonna lose it if I see any xenophobic “this is good (for a Kpop song)” comments

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Imagine having no taste because you gave Gee a score of less than a 9....

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Iconic fun!

**fadedblue09** (10): Timeless bubblegum pop classic.

**hikkaru** (10): I just KNOW this and 4 walls are going to get countless "7: pretty good for a kpop song" scores/comments and I hate it here… these two songs are so so good and not even like remotely dated/overproduced sounding like is the comment with quite a lot of kpop tracks... im gonna be so sad when they're out day 1 or 2 bc of xenophobia :onika:

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): kpop excellence [2]

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i'm not even going to explain why. listen to the song until you get it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Remember when THIS was the most famous K-Pop song in the west and not Gangnam Style? Good times

**rickikardashian** (10): i know this is going to get done wrong, like genie got done wrong in the winners rate, but this is a bubblegum pop masterpiece.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I still remember dancing to this song with my dad when i was like seven or eight in the living room. The nostalgia alone deserve a ten

**twat\_brained** (10): when Kpop cultists say how much they realize Western music is comparatively boring compared to songs like this I totally get it. I still fail to understand how this was only #5 in the rate, though.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this song plays in my head every time i say “gg” in a video game

**camerinian** (9): This fucking bops, it slaps, it bangs, it cums God damn I love electro punk

**ManofOranges** (9): This is probably one of the first kpop songs I had ever heard (after Gangnam Style of course). It still holds up.

**moonagenightmares** (9): this song is meth

**musical\_pyn** (9): This is the kind of K-Pop energy I love

**nooodisaster** (9): Okay seriously, there needs to be some bad songs in this rate wtf.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): this should've been Genie but it'll do

**seanderlust** (9): this is your favorite flavor of pixie stick in song form

**vayyiqra** (9): I keep thinking this song isn't even that good and yet it gets stuck in my head all the time

**bbfan132** (8.5): this bops

**astrologicalangel** (8): insanely catchy

**igorwithlicor** (8): RIP Monty Oum, first time I heard this song was one of his videos. It's so catchy and fun.

**skargardin** (8): they have better titles but this does slap

**slimboyfriend** (8): (Tits Mc)Gee

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): ok this is kinda a bop… i really need to get more into GG

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute!

**wryn\_** (7.5): Can't unhear suga from bts' version of the intro now. A ha. Listen boy! My first love story?

**givebackmysweatshirt** (7.4): it's a little too campy for me but it was still a trip

**akanewasright** (7): This is cute

**bookthieving** (7): +1 for choi minho — stream shinee’s 7th album don’t call me, out on february 22!

**flavasavavandal** (7): This isn’t anything special, but it hits enough spots with some great chemistry between the vocalists, a really catchy song and some pretty decent synths to make it worthwhile. If the bridge didn’t slow the down song for no reason, I’d probably say it was great

**frogaranaman** (7): gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Still not a huge fan of this one and the more I listen to SNSD’s discography the more I start to wonder why this was their big hit. On some level I understand it because it’s very catchy and certainly grabs your attention, but then I listen to something like “Kissing You” or “Run Devil Run” and I’m like… y’all picked this?

**runaway3212** (7): Don't love it but it's okay

**Stryxen** (7): oh gee this is a whole lotta fun

**timothy444** (7): Alright k-pop song, I guess

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i like this a lot for kpop!

Question for the culture-- why did y'all vote this in if you were going to rob it this early? Let's be real, if any Doja song deserved to win the Rap Girls rate it should've been this one. Doja and Rico are perfectly matched here and this song is so addictive and energetic. Still it seems like the wordplay here was divisive among you guys, leading to its exit here. 

---

## Big like Tia Tamera

**s4mmymusic** (11): the way this song invented music. there simply wasn’t a song in existence before this came out

**bbfan132** (10): gave this my 11 in the rap girls rate for a reason… still love it just as much now

**bespectacIed** (10): Comedic rap on par with popnika, highest praise I could give Doja. Btw, MAKE A BITCH SICK, DIARRHEA was the line that made me stan rico

**CrimsonROSET** (10): you don't understand i'm actually fucking obsessed with this song, like it just amazes me

**DaHumanTorch** (10): my third choice for an 11, and if a dojo song had to win the rap girls rate it should’ve been this and not boss bitch

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop bop bop, an amazing collab

**izeasklapaucius** (10): FUCK i love the chemistry between the two so damn much

**kappyko** (10): i wish i was her boobs

**mudkip1** (10): iconic bop

**pat-rickstar** (10): Her best song methinks. Also you can not tell me the lyrics aren't "dick in the thigh, dick in the waist" I don't care what Genius says, she is not saying "thick" in that line

**plastichaxan** (10): doja's best song and one of rico's best verses ugh such a serve all the way

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): so about the time i did three shots of henny, drank half a long island, and then rapped doja's verse flawlessly in the middle of a bar. yes there is video proof, no it is not ever seeing the light of day because i had lipstick on my chin.

**runaway3212** (10): Her boobs are big but her vibes are bigger!!!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Doja's best track it is not up for debate

**steelstepladder** (10): Spank me very much indeed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): best song about big fucking titties you’ll ever hear

**vayyiqra** (10): I love this song for being so bizarre and the lyrics making very little sense

**waluigiest** (10): they complement each other so well and this song is Doja’s best for sure

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i wish the outro from the mv was on the streaming version too but this is still a banger

**yatcho** (10): the TASTE this sub displayed in voting this in

**Stryxen** (9.4): tag yourself i’m the squeal in the background during spank you very much

**twat\_brained** (9.1): the bars are clever and hilarious but I've just never been able to vibe with the beat to this

**1998tweety** (9): classic

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): kinda the best song either one of them has done so far

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): when problematic people make good music… :(

**jasannn** (9): the bass is phenomenal in this song

**musical\_pyn** (9): Doja could say or rap literally anything and I think I’d absolutely love how she delivered it

**NotWith10000Men** (9): damn I really like her flow

**nowqueenofpop** (9): Zach and Cody could never

**pebbleheights** (9): I cannot even DESCRIBE the energy this song gives me.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This is a total bop but it always infuriates me how little sense "My twins big like tia tamera" makes. Like, Tia Tamera isn't a person, it's Tia & Tamera. I don't care if it's to make the lyrics not sound clunky, it still bothers me!

**wryn\_** (9): This is so gooood, should have been a cultural reset

**camerinian** (8.5): STAN RICO

**rickikardashian** (8.5): tia tamera, tia tamera, you were number number 3rd in the ~~voting~~ rap girls rate, i could NOT believe it

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): doja is so good

**Vultuxe** (8.5): Always liked this one, god damn the bass is real.

**bulforster** (8): I'm such a Rico stan and she ate this, without her it's like a 6.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): this song is trash but i never said i didn't like trash

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): i've never seen sister sister

**igorwithlicor** (8): Very fun! Great flow. I did love this show as a kid too

**seanderlust** (7.4): if these lyrics were delivered any less confidently, they would be entirely corny. for now, they're only partially corny.

**akanewasright** (7): Love this song, but I think I may have overplayed it a little.

**fadedblue09** (7): Eh it's okay but that beat gets on my nerves after a while. Boss Bitch deserved its win.

**frogaranaman** (7): strong showing from both girlies here

**nightjesus** (7): We always love a good Twitches reference.

**skargardin** (7): rico ate

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): Rico carries this so hard. Her verse has so much energy

=====

cremeebrulee: ## Make a bitch sick, diarrhea

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Not Doja’s best.

**anothertown** (6): rico saves this! As usual

**flavasavavandal** (6): references the song

**lillipup03** (6): This gained a full point just for the PETA lyric... and then lost it for the diarrhea lyric.

**nooodisaster** (6): Some of the verses are really sick, but the chorus gets old super quick for me.

**team\_kockroach** (5): Rico should’ve switched up the flow. This sounds like a Tkay Maidza outtake

**TragicKingdom1** (5): i really want to like this but its just not a good listening experience

**SmileAndTears** (4): I really don't like this I'm sorry. Even Doja's charisma can't save this song for me

**Brendon-Urine** (3): doja cat is not good. rico is the only good part of this.

**notnotamotmot** (2): I love Doja, but this is not it.

**TiltControls** (2): Didn't really like it in the previous rate and I still don't. Which is weird cause I like a lot of things from both contributors so this should work (I actually do like parts of Rico Nasty's section, but it doesn't save the song for me).

**timothy444** (1): If this song was a food, it would be a prawn cocktail (because this song is gross)

**zagreux** (1): no<3

**ManofOranges** (0): I just don't like this song at all. Sorry to this at all. The lyrics to me aren't charming or funny, just annoying and the song itself just drones on and on.

**NFLfreak98** (0): This honestly wasn’t gonna get my 0 and then they rhymed Sia with diarrhea. I don’t make the rules

Not another song voted in that's flopping-- the point was to vote in songs you think would do well 😭 Anyway I assumed this song would go further on nostalgia factor alone but it appears that some people were never that fond of it! (The BANANAS line is 100% responsible for that controversy score.) Lucky for Ms. Stefani, she does have another song in this rate so this won't be the last we see of her. 

---

## Hey kids, spelling is FUN!

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic, all I need to say. That little bit of tuba(?) in the second verse is something a genius can come up with.

**bbfan132** (10): i love courtney love

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Kween of spelling. ME! can't relate. /s

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): OMG THIS IS WHERE THAT SAMPLE ON CLUB FUTURE NOSTALGIA WAS FROM

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): You know songs like that they are stories that people can identify with… children were singing these songs at graduations, at weddings, at funerals

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song will never stop being a classic

**J\_Toe** (10): honestly I like the other singles from LAMB more, but this is still fun.

**lillipup03** (10): This song taught me how to spell bananas. I'm not kidding, my aunt played it for me when I was like four, and I absolutely loved it.

**ManofOranges** (10): Gwen Stefani invented "Spelling is fun" before it was cool.

**MrSwearword** (10): it taught the gays how to spell B-A-N-A-N-A-S

**racloves** (10): too iconic

**rickikardashian** (10): hey kids, spelling is fun

**runaway3212** (10): I loved it when she knew how to spell bananas, taylor who?

**skargardin** (10): THIS SHIT IS BANANAS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if you hate this song we can’t be friends

**twat\_brained** (10): I regret perpetuating the Sweetener hate jerk now because when Pharrell is on it he delivers

**vayyiqra** (10): Cheesy, memey fun. The high school theme is cringe but who cares? It "bops" as the kids say

**worlds-okayest666** (10): thinking about the Bratz cover of this that sounds the exact same but way more whiney https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLVjq8EOEOQ

**camerinian** (9.5): this song makes me want to punch someone in the face

**mynameistoo\_common** (9.5): just an iconic song tbh

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.2): call me basic but this is better than cool

**celladonn** (9): This song proves that sometimes spelling truly is fun

**CrimsonROSET** (9): LET ME HEAR YOU SAY!

**kappyko** (9): charly bliss cover >

**notnotamotmot** (9): Fuckin slaps and always has

**TiltControls** (9): There are too many iconic lines from this song than should be allowed

**waluigiest** (9): my favorite song in 2nd grade I remember it so vividly. I memorized this song and expected people to ask me to perform it. Bonkers.

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): This girl I went to high school with shoved a banana up her cooch and people always called her banana girl and I felt so bad for her for all the bullying she got. But this song always reminded me of that so I think it kinda ruined it for me oop

**jasannn** (8.5): Songs with bridges about bananas are superior. Stream So Hot, You're Hurting My Feelings.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): This song is so fucking annoying but every time it comes on I can't help screaming along

**anothertown** (8): Hyperpop

**endcreditouilles** (8): another one bites the dust found dead in a ditch

**frogaranaman** (8): this SHIT is BANANAS

**LuisEnRod** (8): (B-A-N-A-N-A-S is a cultural reset)

**nightjesus** (8): I miss pre Blake Shelton Gwen. I want her back.

**pat-rickstar** (8): I do like this song but I don't think it has aged that well for some reason

**Twerkus** (8): I admit I learned how to spell bananas from this song

**zagreux** (8): Unlike the last one, this IS a Gwen song I vibe with. This shit is truly bananas, B-A-N-A-N-A-S.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): this is fun but never was my favorite gwen bop

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Iconic and catchy, but I prefer Bubble Pop Electric as far as Gwen's annoying earworms go.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): maybe spelling IS fun?

**plastichaxan** (7.5): so along the way i noticed i may not love this as much as i have thought my entire life, it’s still fun and really good though

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Taylor get out of the way, the true queen of spelling has arrived

**Awkward\_King** (7): it always bugged me how rich girl and hollaback girl came one after each other on LAMB like those titles don't look pleasing together. anyway banger.

**Kimchiprince** (7): a problematic bop, but a bop nonetheless

**musical\_pyn** (7): The song needs to be at least a minute longer for everything that’s going on to be fully fleshed out, but what is here is pretty good

**nowqueenofpop** (7): Objectively? Probably a 5 but for nostalgia it’s a 10 so I rounded

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): my dad used to get annoyed at me for playing this when it first came out lmao

**wryn\_** (6.5): The production here has aged so much worse though compared to cool lol. wait actually that synth goes crazy

cremeebrulee: ## Has a potassium deficiency

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I never got the hype for this.

**akanewasright** (6): Yeah, I don’t like this song very much anymore.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6): sounds a bit dated now but yeah, this shit is STILL bananas

**pebbleheights** (6): thanks for the bop, Gwen

**Roxieloxie** (6): I am not old enough to really have that much of a cultural context for this song but it's wild how there are a good 20 memes that come from this song

**s4mmymusic** (6): i think i just don’t like gwen stefani

**Stryxen** (6): hey kids! spelling is fun!

**Vultuxe** (6): Not nearly as good as people think it is.

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): You think with a score like this I’d dislike or be meh on the entire song but the truth is I really like the chorus to Hollaback Girl, I think it is fun and obnoxious without going too far. So why am I giving it a middling score. The verses are painfully underweight. That’s it, if the verses had more punch I might have even given this song a better score than Cool, not bad for one of the most polarising songs of the 2000’s

**bulforster** (5): Half iconic banger, half complete waste of time

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I respect this song for how daring and almost experimental that it is, plus the impact that it’s had on music and culture, but is it something I want to listen to on my own time? No.

**nooodisaster** (5): Iconic, but... not in a good way.

**igorwithlicor** (4): Is it catchy? Sure. Ist it good? Well, that shit is bananas, and also not good

**steelstepladder** (4): I've never liked this sorry

**jsonphile** (3): I’m sorry I can’t stand this song it’s just loud and annoying. That said, I will absolutely quote “this shit is bananas B-A-N-A-N-A-S” whenever appropriate.

**sirpancakeXI** (3): this have been overplayed to a point that this no longer good for me, especially the banana verse

**timothy444** (3): You can tell who the target audience was for this song as soon as she started spelling out the word "bananas" during the bridge.

**team\_kockroach** (2): Even her The Sound of Music song is better than this

**teenage\_meme** (2): this song came out when i was 12, and i've hated it since then. idk why, i just can't stand it. sorry

**NFLfreak98** (1.5): I didn’t think I disliked this song. I guess I had never really listened to it before. There’s no music. Like at all? Just Gwen’s off-kilter rapping (?) and that kinda stomp-clap beat. No thanks

**bespectacIed** (1): this not my shit

**FKJVMMP** (1): It’s amazing how Pharrell is so good, and this song is so obviously Pharrell, but it sucks so hard. Gwen’s power.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (1): it's really just not pleasant to listen to and the drama behind what a hollaback girl is doesn't make up for it.

**SmileAndTears** (1): Hollaback Gril is Fergalicious' distant cousin and just like that song, Hollaback Girl is an atrocity that should never have seen the light of day

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I swear I don't remember the instrumental being this bad? It sounds so tinny and washed out and awful, the trumpets are so GRATING and ANNOYING. In my head it sounds like it hits so much HARDER. This sounds like the diet karaoke cover version made in garageband with stock samples. This is by far the worst case of a song sounding dated that I've ever come across in my life. I'm shocked to see that this was produced by Pharell, because I know he's capable of so much better!

And here is our last song for Day 1! A bit unexpected, but Maggie and a few other early Day 2-ers were on the border between today and tomorrow for a while. Unfortunately for Light On, she became the song that got pushed over to today. While I do love this song and how fresh and mature it is, I also don't think it's extraordinary enough to go further, so I don't mind this placement. 

---

## Light On

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this is so good. Good verses, good chorus, good everything.

**bespectacIed** (10): My 11 in its OG rate was this or Fallingwater (my eventual 11). This folk pop album is what y'all thought folkl/everm-ore was doing, and failed

**kappyko** (10): i like how maggie made a song about keeping the lights on that isnt about fucking. or maybe it is???

**ManofOranges** (10): I cannot in words express the amount of love I have for both this song and the album it's on, Heard It in a Past Life, but for this song's sake I'm going to try. I've never actually been in any kind of relationship or anything, but the idea of "if you leave the light on, then I'll leave the light on" is just so comforting, to me. "If you keep reaching out, then I'll keep coming back, and if you're gone for good then I'm okay with that" I think perfectly expresses what Maggie's feeling, and I can feel exactly what she's saying deep in my core being. It somehow gives me closure to the relationships that I haven't had, the relationships that I will have, the friends and family members I've lost, and everything in between. And this song did it within seconds of me hearing those lines. It took no time at all for me to feel this, and only a handful of songs have affected me so soon after listening to them for the first time. All this, in spite of the fact that it talks about leaving a light on, perfectly puts a close on every feeling I've ever felt.

**runaway3212** (10): This really hits

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is personally my favorite from the 2019 indie pop girls rate I hosted. It came out at the exact right time for me, and was a hugely comforting song as I graduated college and moved halfway across the country.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): out of all the maggie picks from that rate it's THIS? but okay whatever i will stan

**TiltControls** (10): One of my favourite albums of all time. This song, Burning, Overnight, and Fallingwater are all fantastic tracks that deserve all the love they get.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): not the biggest fan of her music but this song is so good

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Maggie Rogers is an international treasure. Her entire album is sooo good and this song is just... ugh we cry and turn ALL the lights on.

**frogaranaman** (9): this was dope live

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): this fills me with such melancholy, makes me want to reach out to all those almost relationships

**igorwithlicor** (9): Now this is what I'm talking about!

**musical\_pyn** (9): The rest of the song doesn't quite live up to how clear the opening sounds to me, but it’s still a great song and wow Maggie Rogers can really make a song

**notnotamotmot** (9): Maggie Rogers simply has one of the most beautiful voices there is.

**waluigiest** (9): her music is therapeutic

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I love the way she says "light on" the second time

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Motel 6 couldn't

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): Loving the chill vibe

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): file this under "songs i would appreciate more had i not worked at Target when it was in the electronics rotation and i had to hear not even the whole song but just one snippet like 20 times per shift"

**joshually** (8): Is this song about a late night bootycall?

**MrSwearword** (8): this is cutesy [and weirdly charted at #26 on the Dance Club Songs chart because a remix of this was poppin' with the gays in 2019 who knew]

**rslashpoopheads** (8): makes me emo

**Stryxen** (8): why does this song make me feel so tall

**timothy444** (8): triple j core

**twat\_brained** (8): good song but I don't think I'll ever see Maggie as anything but a poor man's Caroline Polachek

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is sweet

**bbfan132** (7.5): “if you’re gone for good, i’m ok with that” i wish i could relate rip

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): Her voice isn’t good enough to fit the instrumental yet, and her lyrics could use some work. I quite like this though

**Vultuxe** (7.5): Never heard this but I enjoyed it.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): On + Off from her EP >

**bulforster** (7): Never climaxes like I want it to.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): You can't convince me this isn't a Sigrid song.

**skargardin** (7): cute moment

**vayyiqra** (7): pretty

cremeebrulee: ## Light Off

**AHSWeeknd** (6): it’s good but not great.

**jasannn** (6): not bad but nothing amazing

**s4mmymusic** (6): i was obsessed with her after alaska came out but i kinda fell off

**zagreux** (6): no thoughts just vibes

**Roxieloxie** (5.7): So I unfortunately saw tall girl in theaters for a press screening for work and this song plays during the credits and its the only thing i remember from the movie because it has the most undeserved romantic plotline ever and the love interest kiss while this song plays so i cant hear this without remembering that and getting upset

**SmileAndTears** (5): I hate her voice so fucking much. She just sounds like a zombie

**camerinian** (4): More like Meh-ggie Rogers AHAHAHAHHAAHHA

**fadedblue09** (4): Never cared for this Urban Outfitters-core music.

**anothertown** (3): huh?

**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): this song is liking drinking milk, not even something fun like oat or coconut it's like skim milk. i did have a cackle at spotify recommending me the loved by ellen playlist after listening to this.

**izeasklapaucius** (3): ennui

**nightjesus** (2): My best friend graduated with Maggie Rogers. She was apparently a nice gal who knew she had talent and Was determined to make it and honestly am inspired by her hustle. Don’t like this song tho soz Maggie.

**plvstvcbvrds** (2): i just don't get it. i don't know what i'm not hearing, but i don't get the hype. there's like fourteen other people who made this song in the past five years and i didn't like it when they did it either.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): thanks retail for playing this song so much hearing a single note of it makes me physically recoil </3

**pebbleheights** (1): I don’t even hate it, everything else is just better and more interesting.
