TiltControls: Excited to see how messy today will get (though please not too messy - Fast Car NEEDS to make day 3)

A lot happened yesterday so here's some fun stats from yesterday's reveal before day 2 starts

- This rate is both the 7th most controversial rate and has the 6th highest number of participants ever!

- Closer beats its own controversy record (that it held for nearly 4 years!) by a sizable margin then immediately after, Shoes comes and also breaks the old Closer record. THEN stupid horse comes in and takes the 4th place spot! (So the top 5 is now Closer / Shoes / Closer / stupid horse / Ur So Gay)

- Closer (5th - 26) and Shoes (7th - 21) both made it on the top 10 for most 0's received (Both got 10's from me so I just think y'all lack taste)

- Unfortunately Rico Nasty received her first few zeroes yesterday so she falls off the exclusive "no zeros" list

And our first song out today does not come as a surprise! You Get What You Give, whilst a great song, was overdue for an elimination, due to its two personal failures of being sung by a man and being over 15 years old. I think we were all surprised when this song survived until today, but there was also a time this song was top 10 for a bit! I would think that would be a fun timeline to visit :( Too bad, it only took one low score to tank this and once more ballots started coming it, its placement only got worse and worse until it landed here. 

---

## You've got the music in you

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I end up forgetting about this track every so often, but everytime it re-enters my life, it's all I want to hear for a month. It's a politicial track, but unlike a lot of other tracks in the 90s, it's actually optimistic. I think we can learn from that in 2020. Even though there is some (fairly justified) doomerism surrounding the state of the world, we could all use some idealism, that not everything sucks, and if we all give what we have, we can get the change to kick Beck's ass

**bbfan132** (10): fuck this is perfect [2]

**bulforster** (10): Pop maximalism at its finest.

**camerinian** (10): Can't believe that we all still resonate with wanting to kick Marilyn Manson's ass 20 years later, God what a fucking stain

**cherryices** (10): this is the sound of coming-of-age

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): God I miss the ‘90s… I mean I was 1 when this came out but this is one of those songs that I grew up listening to on the radio and stuff, and while I don’t necessarily like all of those songs (I actually hate a lot of them lol) I’ve always had a soft spot for this one. I actually didn’t know what it was called and had no way of finding out until this rate so thank you for that! But seriously, I don’t know what it was but white people had soul back in this era, all of the vaguely rock/adult-contemporary hits from around this time just have a way of cutting to your heart like not a lot of music can. There’s just a wholesomeness, an earnestness, an optimism that I think we’ve lost. omg so this blurb is actually, like running commentary of me listening to this song for the first time again in years and I just hit the bridge and I’m legit getting emotional right now! Hope this one does well.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): an underrated classic! Not looking forward to this getting disrespected

**ImADudeDuh** (10): who do we think would be mentioned on the last verse if this were written now?

**jsonphile** (10): god this song just has so many great moments and great lines it’s like the WAP of the late 90’s in that it’s impossible to pick a best moment because there’s just so many of them. Ahhh who am I kidding the best moment is “we’ll kick your asses!” but there’s so many other great moments

**ManofOranges** (10): I've talked too much about songs that engender happiness and euphoria in this rate, but this right here? This is IT. Maybe there's a bit of a nostalgia factor here going on because it was in Scooby Doo 2: Monsters Unleashed, but this song has so many great things going on, and I say that totally unironically. From the beginning of the song with the "1, 2, 1, 2, 3, OWWWWWW" I'm immediately hooked in and the song just won't let go. It's carefree, and it's reassuring, especially in a world like new when "assuring" is hard to come by.

**musical\_pyn** (10): Absolutely love this hook, this instrumental, just everything about this

**nightjesus** (10): god I love this song. If you don’t scream ‘WE’LL KICK YOUR ASSES’ did you really listen to this song?

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i might be the only person on the planet who likes this song as much as i do, but i don't care! it's good!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): If this doesn't place higher than #20 this time I will cry

**runaway3212** (10): I really like this more after watching the todd in the shadows episode

**timothy444** (10): Sadly this won't reach day 3 because popheads has an irrational fear of men

**twat\_brained** (10): fuck Marilyn Manson

**jackisboredtoday** (9.6): shout out Todd in the Shadows for making me discover this cause its grown on me with almost every listen

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): longer than it needs to be but hopefully this escapes the bottom 5

**lillipup03** (9): Ok... early 2000s babies... you remember the movie Surf's Up, right? And this was totally your favorite song from it, right?

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): i didn’t pay this song enough respect during its original rate methinks

**ReallyCreative** (9): these men made a point

**Roxieloxie** (9): [2]

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): it sounds so sunshiney

**seanderlust** (8.5): had a friend in high school who loved this song but also sang "wake up kids we've got adrenal disease" at the start and now I can't not

**igorwithlicor** (8): It's good, chill and cool

**LuisEnRod** (8): (one of those cute 90s song that make you nostalgic every time)

**skargardin** (8): a good time i think

**wryn\_** (8): Joe Biden snapped on this one!

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): it's a perfectly okay song

**TiltControls** (7.5): Great song, but whenever I hear it now I get flashbacks to the terrible cover which puts a damper on the experience

**plastichaxan** (7.2): i wish i liked this more but it’s cute

**bespectacIed** (7): yass fuck the establishment

**frogaranaman** (7): that album cover is so 90s

**notnotamotmot** (7): This is one of my favorite songs for singing in the car if I have to drive for a few hours by myself. That's about the only time it makes it into my rotation though.

**akanewasright** (6.5): Oh that’s what this song is called.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I don't know, I always felt this song went on for too long. It has also not aged as well as some of y'all are gonna claim it did.

**nooodisaster** (6): I give this a 6

**rickikardashian** (5.8): I'm protesting over the fact that this was sent over [insert like 75% of this rate]

**Vultuxe** (5): Never heard this before and it didn't stick out to me so yeah.

**waluigiest** (5): stream You Are The Music In Me - Sharpay Version

**ElizabethDDoS** (4): Meh.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (4): it's the 30 second intro of just shouting for me

**s4mmymusic** (4): normalize telling artists that their songs don’t need to be as long as they are

**vayyiqra** (4): Catchy but boring

**AHSWeeknd** (3): I never liked this tbh.

**anothertown** (3): it’s giving 9th grader who just learned what the word capitalism means

**Stryxen** (3): it’s giving day 1

**chillbumps5** (2): i like this song because it was used in my favorite tv show glee

**SmileAndTears** (2): not this... not this... the way they sing "Dont. Let. go." is so fucking aggravating

Day 2 eliminations are really hard to watch because while a lot of meme/filler goes on Day 1, a lot of greats songs actually go out today. Cruel is one of my favorite discoveries from a rate and I say this as someone who thought there were too stupid to get into St. Vincent. That guitar riff is just so good and catchy. Surprisingly in contrast to the shitpost, Cruel was doing MUCH better than its infamous name twin, Cruel Summer, for a good portion of the rate. Its downfall appears to be that while people love this song, it couldn't quite escape the notoriety of sharing a name with a main pop girly.

## The guitar solo idk there aren't that many lyrics in this song

**hunnybee12** (11): the greatest bridge of all time!! i said it!!!!!

**akanewasright** (10): Perfect song.

**bbfan132** (10): my favorite st. vincent song, it’s so so good

**bespectacIed** (10): annie's guitar skills >>>>. Love the message

**bookthieving** (10): guitar!!!!!!!!!!!!

**bulforster** (10): It already defeated one "Cruel" challenger song, if we live in a just world that'll have granted it enough power to pull it off again 🙏🙏🙏

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): THE GUITAR SOLO!

**fadedblue09** (10): St. Vincent (and Strange Mercy in general) is too abstract for me but the instrumental here is just so inexplicably exquisite and catchy. In a parallel world, this could've won the rate instead of Mitski and I wouldn't even be mad.

**mudkip1** (10): i hope this does well but ik it won't. praying for at least top 20

**plastichaxan** (10): she's transcending (me)

**steelstepladder** (10): Annie queen

**TiltControls** (10): My 11 from the rate that I cohosted!!! I love the amazing guitar work and the great vocalizations throughout the song. Hoping it does well this time around!

**useless-sheep** (10): literally a perfect song

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): I kinda underscored this in the original rate, so time to make up for that!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Okay so this is one of the songs I hadn’t heard before the rate and I actually really like it? The guitar work on it is fun and I really enjoy the lyrics, they’re just the right amount of edgy while still being relatable.

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): I'm not letting my fav alt-girl fall so easily

**Stryxen** (9.5): this just gets me GOING

**anothertown** (9): I listened to this and was like “wow this is beautiful I should get around to listening to her” and then I heard her whole discography and loved it. It was great

**ManofOranges** (9): St. Vincent has been somewhat hit or miss with me, but I actually quite like this. I find it interesting how I song titled cruel doesn't sound even the least bit cruel.

**rickikardashian** (9): the hosts intentionally left st vincent’s name out of the ballot so people would confuse this with cruel summer

**waluigiest** (9): she can do no wrong!!

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I can see her vocals being controversial in this rate, but this is a bop

**frogaranaman** (8): iconic guitar riff

**igorwithlicor** (8): Viby and cool

**notnotamotmot** (8): Who doesn't love being serenaded by chainsaws?

**zagreux** (8): cant turn off what turns me on

**seanderlust** (7.7): it's interesting and a bit peculiar (in a good way), but do I see myself returning to it? probably not for a while.

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): This is going to go on day 1 but I enjoy it anyway

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.4): there are better songs on this album

**twat\_brained** (7.3): wait I'm just learning St V cowrote Cruel Summer there's so many meta injokes to be made

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I like this song but I feel like you could shave a whole ass minute if you tried.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why does the guitar sound like farts in the middle. I really like the build throughout the song but some parts just don’t work for me

**J\_Toe** (7): I want to like St Vincent, but she's just so off-putting. And all of her fans I've met IRL are smug as hell

**musical\_pyn** (7): I just don't think I get this song, I feel like it should be bigger but it just...isn't

**nooodisaster** (7): I actually... like St Vincent's song???

**SmileAndTears** (7): I like the guitar in the chorus, the rest is fine enough

**timothy444** (7): Alright pop song, I guess

**Vultuxe** (7): I love St. Vincent and I really want to love this more but it's a little beyond my taste.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): when she said crUeUeUeUeUeUeUeUeUEuEuel i felt that

**jayjaysortagay** (6): definition of average

**Roxieloxie** (6): You know what this is doing more for me than the taylor song

**s4mmymusic** (6): i feel like st vincent should be clicking for me more than it is

**endcreditouilles** (5): happy crimbus. merry chrysler

**pat-rickstar** (5): I don’t really care for this but I couldn't say why

**moonagenightmares** (4.7): ph really chose the most boring songs from each artist for an all stars rate

**NotWith10000Men** (4): I like everything except her in this song which is a shame bc I really like her masseduction album

**vayyiqra** (4): Didn't like this album but this song is okay yet something is kind of annoying about it

**AHSWeeknd** (3): Not too into it

**nightjesus** (2): I was kinda half expecting Cruel by The Veronicas and got excited. I can respect her vocals but I’m not really a fan of anything else in this song. Also that’s a long outro of the basically the same few bars. This is a little painful not gonna lie.

**joshually** (1): I listened to this song twice and could not remember it as soon as the track finished

Okay first of all, fuck you guys for this placement omg. My original 11 in the Rap Girls should've carried over here if I knew you guys were going to disrespect this. Yes, Big Ole Freak is one of Meg's older songs but her charm and energy is still so present here. It's an earworm and should've stayed Day 3 like it did in the beginning!

## Hot girl shit

**bespectacIed** (10): Megan's flow here, 10/10.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this deserved to smash like Savage did

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorites from her, wish this could have been a smash but she wasn’t as big then

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Hotties unite

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): when megan is in her bag, she is in her fucking bag. this is the essential meg song to just show how cocky, talented, and amazing she is. her ability to ride a beat is unparalleled.

**runaway3212** (10): Iconic

**s4mmymusic** (10): this is one of my favorite megan songs idgaf

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Megan went hard on this track

**skargardin** (10): no one else does it like megan

**twat\_brained** (10): this song is unrealistic Ms Megan would never rub up on a scrawny white twink like myself. Actually not even that's accurate she hooked up with the bile who abused Halsey so what do I even know?

**akanewasright** (9): Not one of my favorite Megan songs.

**camerinian** (9): Megan is and was always a pop icon and shame on us for being so slow to realise

**pat-rickstar** (9): The songs picked from the rap girl rate are all so good!

**rickikardashian** (9): the best way to sing this is singing along to the adlibs

**waluigiest** (9): her flow is unreal

**1998tweety** (8.5): Big Ole Bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): I really like the subtle backing vocals in buried in the mix, it gives the song a super unique feel

**CrimsonROSET** (8): what the fuck does brazy mean

**igorwithlicor** (8): Damn, this song doesn't stop. Amazing

**kappyko** (8): prefer stuff from Fever tbh

**nightjesus** (8): Fuck me up Tina Snow.

**nowqueenofpop** (8): Something changed for me when she said "come in the room and I'm giving commands / I am the captain and he the lieutenant" and I have since adopted that as my philosophy

**ReallyCreative** (8): it makes me feel sexy

**steelstepladder** (8): Megan has done better since this but it still slaps

**vayyiqra** (8): real hot girl shit

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): and you must be a pussy boy if you get offended

**bbfan132** (7.5): ngl i would’ve picked a different megan song over this one but it’s good

**bigbigbee** (7.5): The line “I got him swerving and breaking the law” made me laugh out loud in public the first time I heard this song. So much fun.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it’s good but Megan’s outdone herself.

**J\_Toe** (7): I prefer Good News

**Kimchiprince** (7): love Meg not her best

**ManofOranges** (7): Not my personal favorite from Mrs. Thee Stallion. Not really a fan of her singing voice compared to when she raps, but I do still have a lot to like about this song. Specifically, I love the "Is it love is it love" going on in the background of the song.

**musical\_pyn** (7): Megan's flow is good like always, but god those hi hats completely take me out of the song and I really can’t enjoy it

**nooodisaster** (7): Go in Tina Snow!

**NotWith10000Men** (7): she sounds like a bad bitch with everything she says

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i wish it had an actual ending and didn’t just end on a minute of instrumental

**zagreux** (7): AH👅

**wryn\_** (6.5): Megan is amazing on this as per usual but I'm not a fan of the beat, doesn't feel very sexy

**frogaranaman** (6): Megan’s done better

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Is this from the rap girls rate? I have no memory of this song. It’s okay I guess but we’ve heard better from Ms. Thee Stallion

**SmileAndTears** (6): AEH

**Vultuxe** (6): To me Megan Thee Stallion is a case where her music does not come close to the talent she has. Lots of potential but I just don't love anything she puts out.

**izeasklapaucius** (5): her singing is not as bad as in Don't Rock Me To Sleep but she's still singing in this so...

**rslashpoopheads** (3): don't remember a second of it

Honestly, shout out to the Mens R&B Rate hosts for submitting female collabs into All Stars because y'all would've sent a solo Charlie (Puth) song out yesterday. Undeservedly because there are some major bops on Voicenotes, this song included. Contrary to some comments, I think they actually have good chemistry on this track and it's equally matched (like I don't think Kehlani is carrying this). Alas, this is the end for Charlie here, but maybe his peer Bruno will fare better with his collaboration. 

---

## I'd die for you, baby

**CreepyMannequin** (10): incredible collab

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Repeat with me, men can make good songs!

**frogaranaman** (10): the writing on this song is genius, top to bottom

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): and that’s RATE WINNER Kehlani to you! She murders every track she’s on but I think Charlie actually holds his own on this one pretty well. Definitely the best song of the Voicenotes era, I wish that it had been a bigger hit. The storytelling in the lyrics is so strong, the way that he lists all of the things he did in his lower register then switches over to falsetto as he asks what she’s done in return is kinda brilliant? Plus having Kehlani there to balance him out was a smart idea because it turns the song into an argument, a competition, rather than just him whining about a girl.

**hikkaru** (10): voicenotes aotd no it's true it's true

**ignitethephoenix** (10): DONT ROB THIS SONG BECAUSE ITS DONE BY CHARLIE PUTH ITS EXCELLENT AND ITS JUST AS GOOD AS MOST OTHER SONGS HERE

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why was this not an absolute smash hit

**ManofOranges** (10): Voicenotes is one of my favorite albums of recent memory. It's got great song, after great song, after great song. And this was the one that actually enticed me to listen to that record at all, so it's got a special place in my heart as the song that led me to one of my most-listened-to albums. While it would've been nice to see Attention instead as I think I like that song itself a little more, the sentimental value mixed with the pure quality of this song make me just fine with getting to rate it again.

**nootnoot781** (10): kehlani is so disrespectful. how are you gonna demolish charlie on his own song?

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): charlie puth makes pop music for people who are scared to admit they like pop music just because and they need to be able to justify it with, yeah well he went to a nice school and has perfect pitch. but for all that he's a shitty trump loving asshole with a punchable potato face and a foot for a chin, damn can he make a good song. this is 80s pop perfection, his vocals are angelic, and him mixed with kehlani? amazing.

**runaway3212** (10): such a bop

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Charlie better stick with this kind of style, this suit him so well. He and kehlani fit so well

**timothy444** (10): "Done For Me" is a song that features a rebranded Charlie Puth and an amazing R&B vocalist Kehlani. In the past, we have seen her in heaps of collaborations like Playinwitme with KYLE, What I Need by Hayley Kiyoko, and Good Life with G-Eazy out of all people, but personally this track is one of Charlie's and Kehlani's best. From the switched perspectives when they get their chances to sing their verses, to the perfect harmonised bits in the chorus, this duet doesn't disappoint in the slightest. Charlie himself has said that his debut album with songs such as Marvin Gaye (puke) were to attract a radio-friendly audience so to see him release bangers like this; it just shows how mature of an artist Mr. Daddy Puth has become.

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): I feel like if this was a bit faster i would've enjoyed this more

**akanewasright** (9.5): Kehlani features >>>

**1998tweety** (9): one of the bests on the album

**flavasavavandal** (9): Man Charlie really fits that ungrateful egotistic man who thinks he’s doing god’s work for someone while barely lifting the bar way too well, and then Kehlani comes in and steals the show and calls out his bullshit and combined with some gorgeous well produced funk and an insanely catchy chorus, and it feels so good.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): okay bop

**nooodisaster** (9): Rate hosts have taste putting this one in, it's the hidden gem of this album.

**notnotamotmot** (9): Never heard this song before, but damn it's good. Wound up playing it a few times in a row before finally rating it.

**pat-rickstar** (9): I just noticed the two songs picked from this rate both have female artists on them, I see what you're doing hosts

**skargardin** (9): main pop boy things

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): imagine getting outshined by your feature in the only good song you’ve ever made. cringe!

**waluigiest** (9): ive never heard this but it kind of bops???

**worlds-okayest666** (9): wait wtf this is really good??

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): WAYYY better than it has any right to be

**twat\_brained** (8.6): Kehlani's grown on me a bit since SweetSexySavage let me down

**bbfan132** (8.5): his best song for sure [2]

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I always forget Charlie Puth, uhh, exists, but when I come across stuff like this, I remember that he actually bangs

**astrologicalangel** (8): this honestly could have been a solo song but it's still great

**Brendon-Urine** (8): go off kehlani! her and charlie together on the last chorus sounds great.

**camerinian** (8): The back-and-forth bitter breakup duet is the superior form of pop music and I will not be swayed on that

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): kehlani bumped this up 4 points

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): FUNKY

**igorwithlicor** (8): Very nice beat! Voices blend beautifully

**izeasklapaucius** (8): I prefer How Long but this is nice too

**jasannn** (8): .5

**jayjaysortagay** (8): Disco + Kehlani gets a yes from me

**jsonphile** (8): wow this Wham ripoff is really good

**nightjesus** (8): Voicenotes deserved so much better as did this song. I forgot how good this was.

**ReallyCreative** (8): everything in this song is working so well but Charlie still has to find the time to shriek out some high notes like his balls are being tenderized

**SmileAndTears** (8): bop

**steelstepladder** (8): Wild how Charli Puth started bad, got good, and then became bad again...

**vayyiqra** (8): Very smooth and 80s-sounding

**Vultuxe** (8): What happened to this Charlie Puth, a lot of these songs are genuine bops.

**cherryices** (7.9): wavy. really into this

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): cant lie this was better than i expected

**slimboyfriend** (7.8): My favorite republican singer behind Question For The Culture

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): this almost made charlie puth tolerable

**wryn\_** (7.5): I actually avoided this for years cause I was worried I'd like it too much and then I'd have to add a charlie puth song to my playlist. My fears came true

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it’s okay but it’s gets old fast.

**bulforster** (7): Nice production but they don't have much chemistry.

**jackisboredtoday** (7): fine background music but the pool in this rate is too strong for this to get more than just an ok score

**musical\_pyn** (7): I like the both sides dynamic, but the song never really reaches the place I want it to go

I feel similar about this song's elimination like I do with Cruel. An objectively good song that unfortunately has to get cut because it doesn't appeal to the general /r/popheads audience. I will say when I did the 2019 Pitchfork Acclaim Rate last year, I severely underrated Weyes because her album is so much of a grower. I ended up listening to it so much after the rate ended and grown really attached to it, so it hurts to see Natalie leave now :( But I'm proud that it survived Day 1 as a long, slow song and hopefully this puts a couple of more raters onto Weyes!

## The Star

**team\_kockroach** (11): Hits me in the gut every. single. time.

**Vultuxe** (11): I am floored by this song to this day... one of my favorites of the decade... there is nothing like it. It is somehow calming and cathartic at the same time, a complete journey from start to finish. Absolute titan of a song that will get paid dust here.

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**anothertown** (10): she’s giving Ari Aster, she’s giving Aronofsky, she’s giving Celine Sciamma

**Awkward\_King** (10): one of my favourite songs ever, the way it captures the feeling of wishing your life was as simple or as glamourous as fiction is just wonderful, truly the main character song. and the fucking violin break into crescendo halfway through like stunned me the first time i heard it, i adore it

**bbfan132** (10): such a glorious song, i will never regret picking this over andromeda

**bookthieving** (10): this song is just so majestic and (of course) cinematic, that last minute is insane

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is going to get robbed just because this sub has the collective attention span of a toddler but ugh i just get chills every time i listen to this

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I smell a robbery.

**fadedblue09** (10): Hey, it's one of my previous 11's. Unfortunately I do not have faith it'll do better this time, but it's still good.

**hunnybee12** (10): this transports me to another dimension

**igorwithlicor** (10): Emotions flowing through me! incredible song

**kappyko** (10): the correct song choice

**ManofOranges** (10): Back in 2019 I went to a Kacey Musgraves concert where Weyes Blood was the opening act and I can't believe I had the audacity to not really pay attention to her when she was probably performing this song. I was so stupid, oh my god.

**musical\_pyn** (10): This entire song is just one incredible build to the moment when the desire for everything to just be simple for once overflows. I could listen to this song over and over again just for that last moment

**nootnoot781** (10): why do i feel like this is going to be done so dirty? if this goes out day 1 i stg

**plastichaxan** (10): this is just transcendental

**skargardin** (10): transcending

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i really need to check this album out bc this song is absolutely stunning

**hikkaru** (8): this is so pretty!!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): wait this is a bop but runs a little long

**pebbleheights** (8): I wish I could live in this song. I got goosebumps so many times.

**vayyiqra** (8): Don't get the hype for this album overall but this is beautiful especially the first couple of minutes

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I really want to like this because I love the lyrics and really relate to the lyrical themes but it’s just… like not very fun to listen to? It’s hypnotic in a way and maybe if I were actually in a movie and there was the perfect moment for this to underscore it would really hit me but as Weyes and I both know, life isn’t like that. :(

**zagreux** (7.5): this is so haunting and creepy i love it

**runaway3212** (6): eh

**s4mmymusic** (6): haven’t been able to get into weyes blood but this is good just not rly my thing

**SmileAndTears** (6): I appreciate the sentiment and the production is nice but otherwise this song bores me

**twat\_brained** (6): I forget what I scored this but I've just accepted that I don't think I can convince myself to get into Weyes. She just doesn't do anything for me. Her songs aren't all that bad but like… what do I focus on? I like hooks. I like melodies. I don't hear that with her.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.9): This just bores me to tears. It's WAAAAAYYYYY tooooo drrrraaaawwwwwnnnnnn ooooouuuuuuuuut

**FKJVMMP** (5): It’s probably really good but I keep spacing out 30 seconds in.

**frogaranaman** (5): kinda boring

**givebackmysweatshirt** (4): the disappointment i experienced when i realized we were not rating the ashanti song

**notnotamotmot** (4): I wouldn't mind this in a movie soundtrack or something, but I don't want to listen to this at all otherwise.

**NotWith10000Men** (4): the beginning sounds like a zelda game, but not enough going on otherwise

**timothy444** (4): ResidentSleeper

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I'm sorry altheads I don't have the attention span for this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i liked it until she started singing

**joshually** (2): It sounds like she is trying to summon a demon

**nooodisaster** (1): Soooo sorry. This literally sounds like a shitpost to me, I wasn't sure whether I should be laughing or not. I also just really REALLY don't vibe with Weyes' voice, it was the reason I didn't do this rate in the first place even though I adored the other two albums.

**lillipup03** (0): Sometimes boring songs are worse than annoying songs... like, at least annoying songs somewhat stimulate my brain.

**nightjesus** (0): this feels like one of those awkward waiting room songs from a 90’s ‘relax’ playlist. I didn’t enjoy any of this.

McIgglyTuffMuffin: Agreed with your little blurb. While I haven’t listened to the record yet, I plan on it. I gave this song a 4 but there was something nagging at me the whole time that one day I could like it. So I went to the album on Spotify and just had to save it for the future.

Now it makes me wonder if anyone who did the rate this was originally in and then this has a higher score for it this time.

Oh this one fucking HURTS me. This song was honestly one of my 11 contenders but I knew there was no way it was going to do well so I had to just give it a 10 and pray it wasn't completely disrespected. Which I guess it isn't as a bad as a placement as it could be, but I honestly just love this song. Julian's delivery makes me emotional and sad in the best way and I think the music video for it is one of the best in the rate. Anyway, to the hosts who submitted this I love you but I'm sorry we couldn't get it any further!. 

---

## We will never be alone again

**izeasklapaucius** (11): we want The Strokes X Daft Punk record!

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): cries

**bespectacIed** (10): the song that memorializes my huge crush on cokehead-looking young julian casablancas who AGED LIKE MILK :( This song is amazing btw

**bigbigbee** (10): My other 11 contender. It’s been a while since I’ve fallen in love with a song this fast. I can’t stop listening to this.

**camerinian** (10): This is the only sadboi mumbling I will wholeheartedly endorse

**cherryices** (10): i’d never heard this one but i really enjoyed it!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I will NEVER forgive the sheer and utter robbery that happened to RAM.

**frogaranaman** (10): I’ve cried to this song, I’ll admit it!!

**runaway3212** (10): fantastic

**skargardin** (10): bliss

**steelstepladder** (10): If this doesn't do well I will cry

**timothy444** (10): Honestly, every single song on R.A.M. is a 10

**vayyiqra** (10): Daft Punk deserved to win that rate and this song was the most likely candidate

**plastichaxan** (9.5): so true, so sad

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): This got robbed originally and we WON'T let it happen again!

**rickikardashian** (9.5): if the music video for this caught me in a bad day, it would destroy me. sad ass story about some mannequins. it had no business making me tear up

**igorwithlicor** (9): So cool and chill. What a nice song!

**musical\_pyn** (9): Just very smooth and some of the best Daft Punk has done

**twat\_brained** (8.9): why have I spent my whole life without getting into Daft Punk

**1998tweety** (8.5): this bops tbh

**akanewasright** (8.5): bop

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): One of the few listenable songs on Random Access Memories

**Stryxen** (8.5): aweyanamnenaloneagaiin cusadhzdubaada everydAy

**s4mmymusic** (8): my brother was a strokes fan so he put me onto this song when i was like 10

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.7): i’m basic so get lucky >>. also lose yourself to dance deserved

**bbfan132** (7.5): it’s pretty good but i wish i liked it more

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I almost think this is better than get lucky but there’s something missing from it

**FKJVMMP** (7): Would be a lot higher if I had any idea what he was saying.

**ManofOranges** (7): Although I really wanna like this song a lot, there are a few things holding it back from greatness for me. I'm not really a fan of the vocal effects all throughout the song; I think I would've prepared just a regular sounding voice. Also the verses are pretty middling in my opinion since they don't do anything that interesting. The verses are pretty much just time spent waiting for the chorus, which I actually do enjoy. The production obviously sounds great because of course it does, it's Daft Punk, but it doesn't really make up for what the song lacks.

**nooodisaster** (7): quite nice... suspicious.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): goes on and on and on and on....

**waluigiest** (7): a grower for sure. It vives when you listen to the whole thing but no individual part is that good or interesting

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): I literally can’t make out anything Julian’s saying here… ariana who???

**AHSWeeknd** (6): meh, never found it too interesting.

**notnotamotmot** (6): I want to love this song, but the autotune makes that tough. Why was there so much horrible autotune in the early 2010s?

**ReallyCreative** (6): it has some cool moments but it doesn't stand out in this rate at all, a bit overrated

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): julian casablancas is my favorite vocaloid

**Vultuxe** (6): It's okay I guess... not my taste.

**nightjesus** (4.5): I’m not sure how to feel with the change up in the chorus and the verse/bridge. Oh the distorted guitars are a thing.

**anothertown** (4): I hate the strokes

**bulforster** (4): I hate the processing on Julian's voice, they made him sound like a mosquito.

**jayjaysortagay** (4): the vocal production is ugly af

**joshually** (3): Nothing exciting

**LuisEnRod** (3): (honestly never was a fan of this album)

**NotWith10000Men** (2): okay maybe I just don't like daft punk

**pebbleheights** (1): I listened to this song twice and forgot about it completely both times.

I gave this an 11 in its rate and I'll say I think this was due for elimination. It's a cute self-love bop but I think it's not really up to par with some of the other songs in this rate. The lyrics here are definitely cheesy which is probably what cause this song to just hang around in Day 1 for half its run until some good scores finally pushed it up here. Sorry Shura, no justice for MUNA and Clairo was delivered :( 

---

## This song's number one fan 

**nightjesus** (11): I did originally give DAMN DANIEL my 11, but this came on and I just. Ugh the production. The vocals. The e n e r g y. The lyrics. So iconic. Like big like stan. What can I say I’m just a Number One Fan ahahahaabahahahahaahhaabahahahahaaha.

**redgold51** (11): Easily one of my top three fav songs of all-time! Stan MUNA for clear skin!

**astrologicalangel** (10): I feel like I listened to this every day for a month after the rate ended

**Awkward\_King** (10): why am i scared this is going to get robbed when this is like the perfect pop song, please give it the respect it deserves

**bbfan132** (10): easily their best song

**camerinian** (10): One of these days, I will realise how badly this song is pandering to pop geeks and start to resent it. This is not the day, and I pray that day takes a long time to come

**CrimsonROSET** (10): My 2nd choice for an 11, I'm kinda bummed because this does deserve it. Always the bridesmaid, never the bride.

**ManofOranges** (10): I was totally thinking this song was gonna win its rate over Religion, and boy am I glad that it didn't. But just because I didn't want this song to win doesn't mean I don't think it's great. It really is. It's yet another song in this rate with an 11/10 opening. So here's the bad news: Nobody likes me and I'm gonna die alone" is an immediate attention grabber, and it pulls you into a fantastic song about self-love.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is just SO DAMN CATCHY! I can't help but chant along with that chrous, it's catchy, motivational and fun, what's not to love?

**runaway3212** (10): we love self love

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): I was playing the sims while listening to this playlist and this came on while i was throwing a party for my sim who's an aspiring comedian and it was honestly such a vibe

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Shoutout to the bathroom mirror for having to watch me lose my shit to this song so many times

**Vultuxe** (9.5): It's a bop, it is, it is.

**steelstepladder** (9.3): Probably the best song I didn't know before doing this

**1998tweety** (9): Love the production on this, some of the lyrics are a bit clunky though which is what holds this back from being a 10 for me.

**akanewasright** (9): BOP

**jayjaysortagay** (9): I've never heard this before now but it's going in the playlist

**lillipup03** (9): I think I stan the usage of vocoder in music more than I stan any individual artist...

**musical\_pyn** (9): I mean that’s one heck of an opening line. And the rest of the song doesn’t disappoint either

**pat-rickstar** (9): Self-empowerment bop

**skargardin** (9): these synths :chefskiss:

**SmileAndTears** (9): BOP

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i don’t know if im even my number 100th fan

**useless-sheep** (9): gave this a 10 in queer pop rate and regretted it so gonna give it a 9 and prob regret it later too

**vayyiqra** (9): same @ the opening verse

**waluigiest** (9): I’ve been bopping for years I have no idea how I first found this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.8): “I would give my life just to hold your hand” wow so that’s a hell of a lyric. Actually all of the lyrics in this one are pretty witty? Something is missing from the gumbo of this song, it’s missing some grounding bass or something but I have to respect what they did here.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this song should be a 10, but the vocals aren't quite there. Love how the chorus builds though

**seanderlust** (8.5): stan yourself queen!

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): This was a fun rate to co-host. Number One Fan is decent single, but I honestly hold the opinion that a lot of the deep cuts in this rate were better than the singles.

**wryn\_** (8.5): I used to get this song stuck in my head so much back in 2019 and I would find myself singing the first two lines out loud a lot...people were worried for me

**bulforster** (8): I was originally put off by the mildly cringey lyrics but nah, this is a bop.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8): i like this song a lot, but i think it could be better. i feel like the lyrics are a little clunky

**nooodisaster** (8): Instantly catchy and relatable and well.... we relate too much to this :)

**s4mmymusic** (8): i like their splice pack

**Stryxen** (8): this has grown on me since its rate lol oh my god babe!

**zagreux** (8): finally a good song after all this male rock bullsh*t

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I dig the vibe

Where I do I begin with this song ...........  Hailed as the best song off Lover, people were worried that the immense numbers of Swifties and their collusion skills would easily send this to the Day 3 of this rate. Well it literally never made it there. Yep, this song never even CRACKED top 25 because the low scores came in way before the Swifties this. There was even a time when this was going out Day 1 and I kinda wished that happened because it would've been hilarious to watch. Still, the Swifties pulled through with their collective 11s and gave this song a comfortable Day 2 spot. Now I do hate the Cruel Summer circlejerk as much as the next person, but objectively this song does deserve a little better. But also this is funny as hell so I don't mind too much LOOOOL

---

## Swifties are the most oppressed minorities

**ChandelierFlickering** (11): that bridge <3

**hikkaru** (11): pure euphoria captured in just three short minutes, absolute pop perfection, with one of the greatest bridges ever crafted. everyone sabogating this can choke xoxo

**Jackalope117** (11): "I love this song" ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?

**lillipup03** (11): If this wind, Taylor has to make a music video, right? ...and that's how Cruel Summer can still be a single.

**1998tweety** (10): should've been a single

**celladonn** (10): Hey guys, I don't know if anyone's ever had this thought before but this should've been a single

**cherryices** (10): he looks so pretty like a devil

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This song better reach the top 15 or else...

**FKJVMMP** (10): ME! would have got my 11.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): I DON'T WANNA KEEP SECRETS JUST TO KEEP YOU!

**jasannn** (10): The queen of bridges.

**jsonphile** (10): I don’t need to explain why this song is so great either you already know or you hate how overrated it is because this sub doesn’t shut up about it

**ManofOranges** (10): Undoubtedly the best song on Lover in my eyes. Shame it had to be in the same rate as Juice, otherwise it would've been my 11 without a second thought.

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): I have an entire lover rollout mapped out in my head with this song as a centrepiece

**skargardin** (10): when this inevitably gets sabotaged and is out day 1 omg!!

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Okay gorls here how we can still make Cruel Summer a single, even though Taylor's released two more albums since this came out

**waluigiest** (10): it’s pop perfection and it reminds me of the summer I met my boyfriend and we started dating 🥺 this song is just what it feels like to fall in love for me

**worlds-okayest666** (10): im sorry but i luv this song...im a basic swiftie at heart

**wryn\_** (10): I know i'm giving this a 10 but if this wins against all these actual pop classics I'm putting myself through conversion therapy. Goodbye gays

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): if this wins I swear...please stop being so predictable

**musical\_pyn** (9): I can easily see why this became a fan favorite and just like literally everyone else I am baffled this was not the lead single

**ReallyCreative** (9): here's how ME! can continue to be a single instead of this song

**seanderlust** (9): i'm a sucker for moments where the music cuts off and the only thing playing is the singer but her vocals are far back ughhhhh

**slimboyfriend** (9): Without Juice, nothing cans stop Taylor now!

**twat\_brained** (9): here's how Cruel Summer can still win a rate

**vayyiqra** (9): Basic take but this is good even if it's overrated because it's Taylor doing synthpop

**yatcho** (9): as much as I don't want to give this a good score, I know she amde some points here

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): the way Taylor shouts "HE LOOKED UP GRINING LIKE A DEVIL" makes me cringe everytime, otherwise it's no surprise it's the fan favourite from Lover (even if it did overstay it's welcome on the popheads charts)

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): [insert some joke about it being a single here i guess]

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): I’ll admit this one snuck up on me, but the sharp as hell writing and a genuinely terrific bridge sealed the deal on me to check out Lover at some indeterminate point in the future

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): It's a good song, but can we stop overrating it just because of nostalgia for the 1989 sound?

**AHSWeeknd** (8): a highlight off of Lover.

**camerinian** (8): this song doesn't actually get really good until the last minute, but holy fuck is that minute really, really good

**J\_Toe** (8): honestly don't love it the most. The vocals compete with the instrumentals at times. Also I do have a cold/fever right now, so maybe I'm currently biased.

**kappyko** (8): uwu oh its a cruwu summer

**timothy444** (8): From the energy in Taylor's vocals to the synthy and thumpy instrumental, this underrated track from Lover should have not flopped

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I used to genuinely love this but I like it less and less the more I listen to it

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I never really saw what y'all saw in this before but it really hits different on a good pair of speakers

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Like a lot of things Taylor Swift has done post-1989 there’s some really cool parts of this song but it falls apart as a whole, the chorus and bridge are great and I like the themes but the verses and her vocals are kinda cringey. Like I’ll get the hook of this song stuck in my head sometimes and be like “oh wow I should go relisten to that” and then I do and I have to experience the rest of the song. “It’s Nice To Have A Friend” was robbed!

cremeebrulee: ## Taylor Swift should be a stale topic

**hunnybee12** (7): if half the lyrics weren't gibberish i would like it more

**igorwithlicor** (7): It's okay, don't feel much for it

**mysario** (7): there's a reason it wasn't a single

**Vultuxe** (7): I feel that people were desperate to latch the next bop that Taylor makes hoping it will be the next Style or Blank Space but I don't think Cruel Summer is anywhere close to being that.

**Stryxen** (6.6): it’s not even top 5 on lover (although i got a soft spot for the whole album)

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): it's aight but not a stand-out on lover.

**izeasklapaucius** (6.5): this song WISHES it could be as fantastic as DBATC

**akanewasright** (6): I gave this a 10 in the previous rate, and I left a long comment explaining why. A lot has changed since then - namely that I’ve matured and don’t want to think about the stuff this song used to make me nostalgic for.

**fadedblue09** (6): This is so 2019.

**Kimchiprince** (6): stop trying to make cruel summer happen

**LuisEnRod** (6): (my most controversial opinion ever: this song isn’t that good)

**Marshynarsh** (6): I don't understand why people pushed for this song so hard. Yeah it was a standout in the album but that album was mediocre as fuck and this song doesn't come close to the highs of her other songs.

**nightjesus** (6): it’s cool but have you heard False God?

**notnotamotmot** (6): This song had a special place this year considering how cruel this past summer was. Not my favorite Taylor song though and I usually get bored with it part way through.

**steelstepladder** (6): "Here's how Cruel Summer can still win" not if I have anything to say about it

**plastichaxan** (5.8): blame popheads charts for this

**bulforster** (5.5): Here's why Cruel Summer will never be a single: because it's boring. It's not even the best song written by St Vincent with "Cruel" in the title in the rate.

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): anyway

**CrimsonROSET** (5): go away already

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5): uh something something make cruel summer a single??

**nowqueenofpop** (5): This is overrated by it's sad because it really would have worked as a single since it has that exact "horrible Netflix teen romance movie montage" vibe that gen z loves. Put it in the next Kissing Booth film

**anothertown** (4): there’s something very commercially uplifting about this.. like a song that a company gets written special for their super bowl ad

**CreepyMannequin** (4): I know every fanbase has a “This should have been a single, it would have smashed” but...this?

**letsallpoo** (4): go away

**Roxieloxie** (4): Okay i was kinda expecting more from this :/// everyone keeps saying that this deserved to be a single and i was expecting a bigger punch from it, I guess its better than ME! but again, call me when taylor drops a song that rivals blank space

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): swiftie oppression should be legal <3

**astrologicalangel** (3): I'm sorry pls don't come for me swifties

**joshually** (3): Bananarama should sue

**MrSwearword** (3): "devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes" ugh what a horribly written lyric

**Awkward\_King** (2): i love this song i just like watching white gays suffer. he look's so pretty like adele.

**bespectacIed** (1): loona - stylish better

**plvstvcbvrds** (1): don't doxx me, swifties. i feel like we have an agreement, okay? me, y'all, the barbz, and most kpop fans. we have an understanding, that i'm broke and sad, and that we don't need to try to ruin my employment situation because i don't like music that you like a lot. i fundamentally do not understand taylor swift, as a phenomenon at all. and this song is just one in a long line of songs that i don't get or like because i don't get or like her. and that's okay, we're okay with that. we are doing some breathing exercises if necessary and then moving on. do not doxx me, please. i'm actually begging.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): this song is just a blander Stylish by LOONA go stream the actual good song instead

**frogaranaman** (0): put me in the Taylor Swift stale topic comment section

**givebackmysweatshirt** (0): it's too loud why is she yelling

**zagreux** (0): I hate capitalism <3

Uhm what the fuck is this placement? I thought this was a lock for Day 3, but once it fell out of top 20 it never came back! Sure, it's not the best Bey/Jay collab but this song is an absolute serve and outsells a lot of the remaining songs imo. I don't even have anything else to say I'm just disappointed :(

---

## Everything I see is you
 
**AHSWeeknd** (11): I’m probably the only person giving this legendary bop an 11 but it’s what it deserves. Every aspect of this song is perfect, the bass, the hi-hat, the 808, the Jay, The Bey. And without a doubt one of the most iconic bridge’s in the history of music.

**MrSwearword** (11): Beyonce's best song, deal accordingly

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): you already know what the deal is. but this is beyond my beyonce love! this song is incredible. It's absolutely incredible. this is one of those songs where you just listen the entire time in awe because it doesn't make logical sense how somebody created something so amazing. This is pop perfection. This is pure pop.

**anothertown** (10): the robbery this will receive.. anyway.. A flawless song. Beyonce created this song to showcase the instrumental (which is great but would have been way better with live drums), but she didn’t rest on an ordinary vocal performance. The way she gradually intensifies the vocal to a peak creates a climactic bridge without feeling overproduced or corny. And that's talent!

**Awkward\_King** (10): magnum opus type shit

**bbfan132** (10): need to listen to this album again at some point, this song is excellent

**bespectacIed** (10): [A meme perfect for this song.](https://twitter.com/Ritawhoras/status/1343673896617320450?s=19). BASS HIGH HAT 808 JAY iconic

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Better than Crazy in Love? I can be convinced.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): My second favorite Bey song from my most favorite Bey album.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one her best songs imo, an absolute classic and also underrated

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen shit

**J\_Toe** (10): I prefer Crazy in Love from her first album, and Get Me Bodied from B'Day, but it's still fun

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BOP

**musical\_pyn** (10): Beyonce just has so much charisma here, and everything from the intro to the chorus is just so much fun to get into. Also, Jay-Z sounds really, really good on this track

**nootnoot781** (10): best bey & jay-z collab? more likely than you think

**Roxieloxie** (10): The song itself is a 9 but my moms commentary when we we're watching Homecoming and she just dragged Jay-Z the entire time he was on for this is so ingrained in my mind that I have to give this an extra point for elevating it

**runaway3212** (10): I'm just a sucker for B and jay's verse is fairly decent too

**sirpancakeXI** (10): hands down their best collaboration

**skargardin** (10): can we for once not rob Beyoncé thank you very much

**yatcho** (10): flawless bop Jay & Bey have yet to top this as a duo

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): her best collab with the man she's now married to

**akanewasright** (9): I’ve never heard this before but holy shit

**bookthieving** (9): love the contrast between the restrained, simmering instrumentals and beyoncé’s explosive vocals

**fadedblue09** (9): Weird way to spell Check On It

**FKJVMMP** (9): Damn I hated this song when I was a kid, what was wrong with me.

**nowqueenofpop** (9): The wrist flick at the end speaks for itself

**ReallyCreative** (9): me when Beyonce gets robbed for no reason again

**steelstepladder** (9): Is it weird I kind of like this better than Crazy In Love

**pat-rickstar** (8.8): Jay's feature is not my favourite but I love all of Bey's parts

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This is better than Crazy in Love and I will NOT hear otherwise. The only thing I don't like about it, and it may just be the spotify version, but her voice sounds super robotic and weird in the mix, to the point it's distracting (also it kinda sounds like it's even peaking at the end of that bridge?)

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): this beat is sick.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): in hindsight it was probably not the best idea to release a song called "deja vu" as your 2nd lead single with the same feature as your first lead single

**mysario** (8.3): this is a really good song but it's somehow the one song here I don't know by heart

**seanderlust** (8.2): oof. this one HURT to rate below an 8.5 I think if I had been here for the L.A.M.B. rate I would have given it a 10, but this is all stars baby... you gotta bring your A game. it's fun and I will absolutely scream along to the lyrics every time I hear it, but it's a bit repetitive musically, and I can't shake the feeling that if I hadn't grown up with it I wouldn't be considering rating it so high.

**1998tweety** (8): Bops a bit

**Brendon-Urine** (8): Why was this not as big as Crazy In Love? This is way better. I also think I'm rare in disliking Crazy In Love though.

**igorwithlicor** (8): Catchy af, but it's Bey, so what else where you expecting?

**kappyko** (8): i prefer upgrade u :C this is nice though

**slimboyfriend** (8): Aw, she sounds so young!

**twat\_brained** (8): great horns and Bey looks stunning in the video but this has never been a favorite Beyoncé track of mine

**bigbigbee** (7.5): The opening to this song is so cool. That’s the way to ramp up a track! Beyonce sounds amazing as per usual. I just wish I liked the melody line better.

**bulforster** (7.5): Horns are the perfect complement to Bey but there are much better songs on B'Day

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): crazy in love is the superior jay z/Beyoncé collab

**nooodisaster** (7): Screaming Beyoncé is honestly quite good, I dig. In Bey's pantheon this is average, but in terms of All Stars songs... okay, it's still average.

**Stryxen** (7): Beyoncé lowkey underrated but she has better songs

**timothy444** (7): Alright pop song, I guess

**waluigiest** (7): damn I forgot we rated this album last year and I could have campaigned for Freakum Dress or Get Me Bodied

cremeebrulee: ## Racism

**cherryices** (6.8): really like this instrumental, but as a whole the song feels a little flat

**frogaranaman** (6): me every day after I think of something: it’s déjà vu

**ManofOranges** (6): I'm getting deja vu because this song reminds of Crazy In Love and I like this song about as much as I like Crazy In Love. Also, I'm sure they purposely named this Deja Vu in the same that Britney has Oops I Did It Again which sounds a lot like Baby One More Time. Kind of a little tongue in cheek joke I think.

**nightjesus** (6): I mean it’s a classic but I never could really get into Beyoncé earlier music post Destiny Child. I think I only liked Irreplaceable off B’Day....

**s4mmymusic** (6): i like beyoncé’s newer stuff but i cant really get into her older stuff

**SmileAndTears** (6): Eh...

**izeasklapaucius** (5): people comparing Billie's Therefore I Am to this song because both exist under shadow of previous mega-single. At least TIA has its own memorable moments, this song doesn't. Sorry Bey, still love your s/t.

**mynameistoo\_common** (5): kind of generic tbh. I’m reminded of how little I like early 2000s production

**notnotamotmot** (5): This song has always just been whatever for me. People love it I guess.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): kinda like a less good Crazy in Love which is already overrated

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): can beyonce and jay-z stop making songs together already. it worked once with crazy in love you don’t need to do it 50 more times

**Vultuxe** (5): Sorry, I can't stand Jay-Z at all.

**zagreux** (5): Not a huge fan of Beyonce's pre-4 stuff

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): why wasn’t “World Wide Woman” submitted instead

**Kimchiprince** (4): she played it at Beychella..she shouldn’t have.

**team\_kockroach** (3.5): There’s a lot of missed potential here. The instrumental is cool, but Beyoncé keeps shouting through the whole thing, giving me sensory overload. Also this is one of the worst Hova verses I’ve heard in a long time

And here we mark Lana Del Rey's exit from the rate. Yes, both of her songs left before a single Carly song went out. I think it's obvious why Lana faltered this rate, given her Question for the Culture 2: Roman Reloaded exploits occurring in the time I was collecting ballots. Surprisingly enough, this song was Day 3 for a good portion (I wanna say because EVERYONE was being sabotaged so MAC just floated up into the top 20.) I used to really love Lana and NFR is still one of my favorite records. This song made me cry the first time I listened to it, but over time it shrunk on me just a little. It's a bittersweet way to wrap up the bottom half of this rate, but no worries because COCC is coming!

---

## Lana singing about  being embodied, feeling beautiful by being in love if the relationship is not perfect, or dancing for money - or whatever she wants !

**1998tweety** (10): classic, despite what yall say about her

**bbfan132** (10): originally picked the greatest for this and that probably would’ve done better but i prefer this so… that outro is glorious

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): you took my brokeness out of context at the Marina's apartment complex

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I am quite iffy with Lana these days, but I cannot give this song less than a 10 at all because I love it so much.

**endcreditouilles** (10): if Bad Guy is a perfect portrayal of my teen angst this is a perfect portrayal of my adult angst.

**J\_Toe** (10): I didn't like Lana before NFR, and I sure as hell don't like Lana after NFR. But I do like Marina's Apartment Complex, Venice Bitch and Doin' Time.

**LuisEnRod** (10): (my first time listening to this song I was on a bus on my way home at like 2am and I cried)

**musical\_pyn** (10): Lana just captures that disaffected yet still in love essence so perfectly on the entire album, but especially on this track

**plastichaxan** (10): i wish she just sat there and ate her food cause her music is soo good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I miss the time when this released and stanning Lana wasn't embarassing

**ReallyCreative** (10): Probably my favorite song by her. What a shame she threw so much good will away in favor of being an entitled, tonedeaf brat on social media.

**rickikardashian** (10): because of certain messages said by miss Lizzy, i will refrain from praising this song and album too much, just know that I scored this with my whole chest and meant

**runaway3212** (10): Yeah I'm a sucker for lana, sorry

**Vultuxe** (10): One of her best. Always preferred this one over Venice Bitch. Simpler times, before she had her question for the culture moment.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Repeat after me, 'Jack Antonoff can do no wrong'

**Stryxen** (9.2): this isn’t The Greatest >:(

**AHSWeeknd** (9): One of her best tbh.

**anothertown** (9): I’M YOUR MAN

**ManofOranges** (9): I hate to say it, but I do like this song.

**wryn\_** (9): This came on the radio once and my mum tried to change station but i stopped her and she listened to 5 seconds of it before saying "youre pretty emo, aren't you" so i stopped listening to it after that

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): y’know… these days i’m not sure if being in context helps Lana’s sadness or not anymore

**akanewasright** (8.5): Fuck you, Lana Del Rey for making music that I like. Someone else please give this a 0

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): :(

**igorwithlicor** (8): Dark and broody

**jasannn** (8): I associate this song with gentrified taki's from Trader Joe's.

**nooodisaster** (8): Jack Antonoff deserves a Noble Peace prize

**notnotamotmot** (8): I'm not usually that big on Lana but this song is just so fucking pleasant.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): one of my least favorites off the album and it's still an 8. damn

**teenage\_meme** (8): there's a sequence of three notes in this song that sound like britney's "born to make you happy." that's all i really have to say here

**timothy444** (8): Quite surprising how listenable this is

**vayyiqra** (8): You took my comments out of context at the popheads music subreddit :pensive:

cremeebrulee: ## Doja Cat, Ariana, Camilla, Cardi B, Kehlani and Nicki Minaj and Beyonce singing about being sexy, wearing no clothes, fucking, cheating, etc. 

**zagreux** (8): does anyone think Mariner's Apartment Complex is a bad song? I think that Lana Del Rey's best friends are rappers and her boyfriends have been rappers. She's not even storming the capital. She's just literally changing the world by putting her life and love and thoughts out there on the table 24 seven. Respect it.

**delicately-fearless** (7.5): one of her worst songs

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): I feel like Lana executed this concept better on other songs, like “The greatest” and “Cinnamon Girl”. Even “Doin’ Time” is more fleshed out than this

**twat\_brained** (7.4): smh she said "are you ready for it?" at the end why would you reference a lousy song after singing such a brilliant song no wonder your image is crumbling

**frogaranaman** (7): I associate this with Tiktok

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): when the worst lana had done was dating a cop

**joshually** (7): This is one of my newest favorites from Maga Del Rey

**waluigiest** (7): here’s what I have to say: she is undeniably racist and it makes me incredibly disappointed as a (former) fan of color to watch her and her fans be so callous. NFR was by far my favorite album of 2019 but I can’t bring myself to listen to it and enjoy it anymore. I want to rate this fairly, even though I don’t really believe in separating art from the artist, but this song is extremely well written. It pisses me off to no end.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I just associate this with the tik tok trend where you are the main character these days lol. It’s kind of boring though

**s4mmymusic** (6): the way i was obsessed with this album... it’s so fucking boring why was i

**steelstepladder** (6): Just not a Lana gal

**worlds-okayest666** (6): its like...fine

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This is gonna get tanked because everybody hates Lana now, but that’s not fair. This should get tanked because it’s nondescript. It’s like, just listen to Grandaddy.

**givebackmysweatshirt** (5): i can excuse racism, but i draw the line at bad pop music

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): i'm giving this a 5 purely because it references a much better song that is not in this rate (venice bitch)

**seanderlust** (5): "I fucked up, I know that but jesus, can't a girl just do the best she can?" ........who's gonna make the joke

**skargardin** (5): lana's antics have made me very indifferent on her music

**fadedblue09** (4): I’ve had enough of her this year, thank you.

**FKJVMMP** (4): I’m not generationally wealthy enough to listen to this song.

**kappyko** (4): this is pretty but its not very satisfying. i feel like i can still feel a bit of the atmosphere that was here for me before but it's faded by now leaving only a really sad emptiness

**Roxieloxie** (3.2): Not this directly after the high Gee gave me

**bespectacIed** (3): "you took my sadness out of context" is honestly a killer line. The rest of the song is boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): it sure is a lana del rey song

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): I saw one too many oomfs defend Lana's January 6 remarks with "you took her statement out of context", so that kind of ruined the song for me.

**nightjesus** (1): Yeah I don’t get the appeal to Lana Del Ray. This is...not something I would ever listen to again. I am not a fan of the talking singing. And she goes intentionally off pitch in the chorus. I mean the song writing is okay but everything else is not to my taste. I mean the musical ending is nice but it gets ruined with her vocal reverb.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): Another day, another Lana track that is a minute too long without the lyrics to back it up. Same shit, nothing new. There is absolutely nothing here for me, so it feels fair to give it my 0.

That one ballot that sent this to #13 .... yeah I wish I were back there </3 IGOR absolutely dominated the rate it was in and for good reason-- it's genuinely one of the best concept albums I've ever heard. This song was thought to be the clear winner, but came in second before fan favorite I THINK (which coincidentally has a woman on it ..... inch resting.) Even though Tyler is in fact a man, this song did well for itself, staying in Day 2 for most of its run. It's a great pop song and we love having Playboi Carti in an All Stars Rate!

---

## Don't leave ...

**givebackmysweatshirt** (11): the way this isn't even the best song on the album but it is the best song in this rate

**anothertown** (10): it’s crazy how igor was an instant classic and that this song is perfect and these are objective facts. The repetition of “don’t leave, it’s my fault,” until it loses its meaning, the way the music trails off when carti’s verse ends, the unfiltered vocals at the end, Charlie Wilson flitting in and out of the mix – perfect song!

**Awkward\_King** (10): if any man does well this rate please god let it be this one

**bbfan132** (10): such an addictive song, i listened to it 4-5 times on loop just now

**Brendon-Urine** (10): DON'T LEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEAVE IT'S MY FAULT

**frogaranaman** (10): obligatory 10 since it’s the Pollen rate entry

**Kimchiprince** (10): !!!!!!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): My 11 from this song's rate and one of my favorite songs of recent memory. Although honestly I kind of wish GONE, GONE / THANK YOU were here because it's grown on me since the rate to become my favorite song off of IGOR, this song will do just fine. It certainly makes my earth quake.

**rickikardashian** (10): while we were selecting the rates i straight up said “this is obviously the sugar vs earfquake rate”.... and then neither won….. anyway im sabotaging I Think in the next winners rate

**Roxieloxie** (10): The vibe this song creates is fun

**runaway3212** (10): yes

**skargardin** (10): slaps

**twat\_brained** (10): whoever decided Tyler the Creator should sing deserves a raise

**waluigiest** (10): THIS SINGLE SLAPS SO HARD and is amazing within the context of the album

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): the only Carti music I like at this point in time

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): This not winning still shocks me, it's just such a good song, the moody "dooooon't leeeeaaavvveeeee" is such an earworm.

**NFLfreak98** (9.5): Tyler’s performance at the 2020 Grammys gets my 12

**seanderlust** (9.5): CARTI LYRICS STILL CAN'T BE TRANSCRIBED

**Stryxen** (9.5): my favourite genre of song is taking blame

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I STILL HAVEN’T BEEN ANSWERED OVER IF THE MAGIC WAND WAS ABOUT THE VIBRATOR u/frogaranaman WHAT’S GOOD

**J\_Toe** (9): IGOR should have got AOTY for 2019

**pat-rickstar** (9): I still can't make out a single line of Carti's verse except the bit about Woah Vicky

**ReallyCreative** (9): really not excited to see popheads rob this one

**SmileAndTears** (9): I think with more time I could grow to adore this song but for now it's great

**timothy444** (9): Used to hate this but now I bang to this. What an absolute banger!

**slimboyfriend** (8.9): Men have feelings too I guess

**1998tweety** (8.5): iconic meme bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): This album is fucking brilliant, but the songs kind of demand to be heard together.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): insert playboi carti verse meme here

**AHSWeeknd** (8): one of his best.

**musical\_pyn** (8): A good example of a song that is just missing that one thing that would push it over the edge into greatness

**nooodisaster** (8): :D

Maybe I shouldn't be so shocked this did so well considering it got top 5 on the 90s rate. Even though we're a pop music subreddit it seems like there's quite a lot of us who are fans of this song. This song makes a respectable exit here for an all male rock group, so hopefully y'all aren't too disappointed. 

---

## Back in the 90s....

**jsonphile** (11): I considered giving a different song an 11 this time instead of this song again. Then I listened to it again and nope this song is just too good. Seriously just that drum fill right before the explosive chorus is just one of the best moments in music ever.

**bbfan132** (10): fuck this is perfect

**camerinian** (10): Boy, this grunge genre sounds like a lot of fun, can't wait to dig deeper and find more wild mosh tunes!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): popheads don't fuck this one up please

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Legendary.

**flavasavavandal** (10): Yeah like I’m going to dispute that Smells Like Teen Spirit is a classic, I’ll leave my hot takes for Britney and pretend to be a rockist for a day

**frogaranaman** (10): I mean of course

**ignitethephoenix** (10): grunge classic, this is such a good song, Ariana shaking at the lack of enunciatation

**igorwithlicor** (10): Classic? Yes. Cultural reset? Also, yes.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I’m a ladder, I’m a vinyl, A mosquito, not a feeler

**ManofOranges** (10): I've already said "What is there to say that hasn't already been said" in my comments like twice now, but this time I mean. Smells Like Teen Spirit is one of, if not *the* most culturally significant song in this rate, and perhaps one of the most significant songs this sub will ever rate. And for good reason. It truly was a cultural reset, and it sounded great while doing it. Kurt Cobain left this world all too soon, but he will live on forever because this song isn't going anywhere, anytime soon.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): heart shaped box is better but this song is still great

**Roxieloxie** (10): I support men in this house

**runaway3212** (10): perfection

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i don't think i would like a rock song this much but i did with this song

**skargardin** (10): banger

**steelstepladder** (10): Oooo so close to my 11

**TragicKingdom1** (10): gen X made points for once

**twat\_brained** (10): Kurt really was the voice of a generation

**vayyiqra** (10): Watch Popheads be tasteless and sabotage this all-time classic because they can't handle an electric guitar

**wryn\_** (10): The solo towards the end on this is just one of the most powerful pop moments ever

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This song feels doomed to fail on popheads but it is a total banger

**TiltControls** (9.5): A (hopefully not day 1) classic! Surprised it made it so far in the 90's rate, but definitely wasn't unhappy about it

**Brendon-Urine** (9): anyone remember the weird al parody? such a part of my childhood.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): I can't understand a word he's saying but the chorus slaps

**plastichaxan** (9): this is not my type of music at all, and yet i enjoy this and a lot of what kurt stood for, just incredible

**ReallyCreative** (9): the possibilities of this song being below things like Shoes, Call Me Maybe, stupid horse, and either (both?) of the K-Pop songs are both terrifying and exciting. I can't wait to see how this turns out.

**waluigiest** (9): not to be gross but I wish I was like 10 years older so I could have grown up with this music and vinyl and the 90s kind of aesthetic. Like not actually because Kesha was my Nirvana but like it would have been cool.

**rickikardashian** (8.8): this bitch is too long

**seanderlust** (8.8): i deeply underrated this one last time. I have since changed my mind as this and 'california love' stayed in my rotation for like two months after the rate

**akanewasright** (8.5): A bop. Not really for me but it does slap

**givebackmysweatshirt** (8.5): i'm worried that a group of 40's something straight men will throw a brick through my window if i rate this song anything less

**cherryices** (8.4): it’s hard to bargle nawdle zouss

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Quite an iconic song, surprised to see it here.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): I don't really enjoy nirvana but this song? Yeah, I get it

**lillipup03** (8): I hate hard rock... I have no idea why I like this song.

**musical\_pyn** (8): Yeah, this is actually good and not just because it’s one of the most recognizable songs ever

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): I love some Nirvana songs but this has never been my favorite. The lead-in to the hook still hits though

**nooodisaster** (7): ooooh, i HAVE heard this song!

**notnotamotmot** (7): Totally not my genre, but the way that the instrumentals in this song shift from hard to soft and back is beautiful.

**Stryxen** (7): it would just be so funny if this won

cremeebrulee: ## Smells

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok i guess

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): I enjoy this song, but I don't have super strong feelings towards it like a lot of other songs in this rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): this is a popheads, sir

**s4mmymusic** (6): eh

**racloves** (5): I’m not like the other girls I can name more than one nirvana song

**SmileAndTears** (5): A bit too aggressive for me luv

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (5): they have better

**Vultuxe** (5): Not my taste. Indifferent.

**timothy444** (4): I don't get the popularity of this song… like at all. I assume it was because of how overplayed it was on radio stations during the 90's but that's not really a valid reason to think a song should be remembered in the first place. Maybe if I was born earlier I would appreciate this more but as it stands, it sounds like the equivalent of an annoying buzz of a mosquito in my ear.

**fadedblue09** (3): Never understood why this was the highest rated rock song in the VH1 rate. I actually liked a lot of the songs there (Enter Sandman, Black Hole Sun, heck even Iris) but I don't get what's so special about this. I guess that's proof that I'm not a 90's kid enough.

**plvstvcbvrds** (3): sometimes when i'm wearing my nirvana shirt and men attempt to quiz me on nirvana, i just go oh huh i thought this was a watchmen reference and then their brains explode.

**DaHumanTorch** (2): minus 3 points for having the worst album cover of all time

**Jackalope117** (2): possibly the most overrated song ever

**zagreux** (1.2): no, just no. stop.

**nightjesus** (1): I’ve never liked this song and I ain’t starting now.

**rslashpoopheads** (1): grimy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i’m being to harsh with my score maybe but i will never understand why this is considered the best song of the 90’s when it has absolutely nothing going for it. i hate kurt cobain’s voice, the instrumental isnt anything to write home about, the lyrics are nonsense and you can’t even hear them when they’re sung so slurred and the music is so overbearing on top of it. what is there to like??? where???

**FKJVMMP** (0): It probably doesn’t really deserve a zero but goddamn if I never hear about how this song singlehandedly birthed the very idea of alt rock like some musical wolf spider again it’ll still be too soon. Normally when bands start musical trends by just banging their instruments harder they at least have something interesting to say to go with it. This is the mainstream 90s version of MySpace scene kid crabcore at best.

It appears we're back on our misandrist bullshit ! Crazy enough, this song hung around the lower rung of Day 3 for a while, no doubt carried by the Cardi feature. The original Finesse is fine, but the addition of Cardi was definitely a smart move and that music is super fun and well executed! Still, while we all liked this song, no one really LOVED it so it makes its exit in the decent late 20s. 

---

## Dripping in finesse

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): their chemistry on this track... incredible tbh

**endcreditouilles** (10): eeooowww

**frogaranaman** (10): absolutely Bruno’s best song. him and Cardi should do a collab album

**hikkaru** (10): cardi munches

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Cardi’s best verse 100%. Honestly a perfect collab

**ImADudeDuh** (10): please drop SOMETHING bruno

**izeasklapaucius** (10): this is still her best single

**ManofOranges** (10): Listening to this remix when it first came out (in early 2018, which is 3 years ago now what the fuck), I was taken aback by how good it was, specifically how well Cardi fits on the track. I'm typically partial to the original version of a song, but in Finesse's case I prefer this version over the original by a country mile.

**mynameistoo\_common** (10): Cardi B truly ELEVATES this song in every way. THIS is how remixes should be done.

**pebbleheights** (10): maybe this is the perfect pop song.

**runaway3212** (10): Cardi makes this song

**skargardin** (10): bruno comeback WHEN

**teenage\_meme** (10): i LOVE this song and i'm so sad it didn't start a new jack swing renaissance

**1998tweety** (9.5): she elevated it

**bbfan132** (9.5): his best song for sure

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): Cardi saved this hard, honestly.

**TiltControls** (9.5): Probably one of, if not the best, rap additions to a pop song in the past few years. Cardi is the perfect fit for this song

**seanderlust** (9.2): cardi really does take this to a whole new level

**AHSWeeknd** (9): One of Bruno Mars’ best.

**akanewasright** (9): What a good remix. We love Cardi B

**bookthieving** (9): when will new jack swing become the new pop throwback trend

**camerinian** (9): Cardi adds so much to this version, it actually makes the original feel empty. I want more of her living her Salt & Pepa fantasy

**igorwithlicor** (9): Super fun song. Cardi is like the best part but it's great in general

**J\_Toe** (9): probably the only Bruno song I would listen to, and that's thanks to Cardi

**musical\_pyn** (9): I've never listened to the original and I never want to, Bruno’s part is good but Cardi just completely elevates it

**notnotamotmot** (9): Not usually much of a Bruno fan, but this song just feels great and Cardi sounds amazing.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): it's a VIBE

**ReallyCreative** (9): the way it's going to be finessed out of a good placement

**SmileAndTears** (9): Cardi just brings so much life to this song

**timothy444** (9): Lmao I remember docking a tenth of a point just because it didn't have Ava Max in it but looking back at it, I think Cardi B is a perfect fit for this remix. Her delivery and style really fits into the the 90s throwback sound that they were going for.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): cardi ate! one of the best feature remixes out of all the ones we’ve gotten in the past few years

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This song gives me war flashbacks to the intermediate jazz class I dropped out of in college because it was the warmup song… anyways while this song is good I think it kinda peaks at the Cardi verse? Like that’s the part that gets me the most hype and then Bruno comes in and he can’t match that. Love the music video though!

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Cardi is undoubtedly the highlight of this song, no offense to Bruno

**Stryxen** (8.5): not sure how this song is CUTE but it makes me smile

**wryn\_** (8.5): One of those songs which just builds so well, by the time that its over I always feel so satisfied

**astrologicalangel** (8): this will never not make me dance

**Awkward\_King** (8): ok so it's like good i just resist it to an extent because it feels heterosexual

**FKJVMMP** (8): WAP is great and all but I’m still holding out hope that Cardi B spends the rest of her career just being Left Eye.

**jasannn** (8): I don't get how this song almost won that rate.

**lillipup03** (8): Now that I don't hear it 20 fucking times a day on the radio, it's actually pretty good...

**nooodisaster** (8): Cardi improves this song 10 fold.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): this song doesn't work without this intro cardi verse. it's just such a moment for her where if you didn't take her seriously, here is where her star power shines. she's lost a lot of respect and love from me recently, but i always have to give her props because this remix and video were just a moment for her.

**twat\_brained** (8): I'm over Bruno but this song still deserves credit where it's due

**vayyiqra** (8): Kind of torn between loving the original song and not liking Cardi's part much but still a bop

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): This just isn’t as fun as it was in 2018 but Cardi is stellar on this, but man Bruno should’ve given her an extra verse

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): forgot how much of a bop this is

**cherryices** (7.4): is it me or does cardi sound like hilda from ugly betty?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): Bruno really is the master of every decade

**givebackmysweatshirt** (7): it's a good song and always gets the straights and gays going at the pregame, but it's really just outclassed in this rate

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): this music video makes me so happy

**nightjesus** (7): Cardi really elevated this song and I haven’t been able to listen to the original since the remix came out. In my eyes that’s how a remix should be.

**waluigiest** (7): it’s good but I’m tired of it

So we continue our streak of eliminating men ... what happened to Daft Punk in its rate was atrocious and it seems like we couldn't save them here either. I think most participants asked for any other song but this one to be submitted, worried that its overplay-ness would tank it but it did quite okay in the beginning and even managed to be Day 3 for a good amount of time. Despite its broad appeal, the haters came out and it dropped down to here. It's a shame really, all I can say is stream Contact to make up for it.

## Check out Daft Punk's new single "Get Lucky" if you get the chance. Sound of the summer.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): Probably my favourite song from the 2010s. It just has an irresistable groove to it, and it's magical how it never wears out or fails to brighten up your mood

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): just pure genius. Nile Rodgers, Daft Punk, and Pharrell truly made one of the best songs ever.

**anothertown** (10): https://i.imgur.com/P8vnyZi.jpg

**bbfan132** (10): modern classic methinks

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Ra....dom Access Memories

**endcreditouilles** (10): instant classic

**frogaranaman** (10): Check out Daft Punk's new single "Get Lucky" if you get the chance. Sound of the summer.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): sound of the summer

**ManofOranges** (10): *This* is the song that I was expecting to win the Disco Revival rate. I mean, it's Get Lucky after all. Does anything more need to be said? The name of the song itself carries so much weight that that's all you need to hear to know of it's greatness.

**timothy444** (10): After all these years, Daft Punk still haven't lost their touch in funky electronic music and that's truly masters of their craft

**vayyiqra** (10): You know that meme about how this is the sound of the summer? It still is, even in the middle of winter.

**waluigiest** (10): I don’t even care this song is good as hell. It was overplayed but I don’t even feel diminishing marginal returns this song is a funky radio masterpiece

**worlds-okayest666** (10): [insert “like the legend of the penis” screenshot here]

**celladonn** (9.5): Check out Daft Punk's new single "Get Lucky" if you get the chance. Sound of the summer.

**cherryices** (9.5): Check out Daft Punk’s new single “Get Lucky” if you get the chance. Sound of the summer.

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): I just love the soft summery vibe this song provides so much I can excuse the excessive use of repetition

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): It is literally impossible to not tap your feet or dance in some way to this song

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): Bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): banger

**nowqueenofpop** (9): The disco revival of 2020 wishes it could be this authentic because at least it involved Nile Rodgers… also did y’all know Nile Rodgers was credited on Hotel Room Service and Get Lucky song was released in 2013, almost exactly 9 months before Pitbull had his last #1 with Timber... the dots they've been connected

**wryn\_** (9): I need a time machine to go back to 2013 right now

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this song was beyond overplayed but let's be real, the hype was accurate

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): bop

**twat\_brained** (8.5): no don't rob Mexicans that's petty theft- oh whatever other musicians at your level and above are let off scot-free doing far worse. It'd be hilarious if Pharrell ranks higher with Hollaback Girl tbh

**seanderlust** (8.4): not the genius annotation using a picture of pharell as a teenager

**Stryxen** (8.2): simply a bop

**akanewasright** (8): Iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (8): good but highly overrated in my opinion

**igorwithlicor** (8): Cool vibe and beat

**ImADudeDuh** (8): idk i just dont like this as much as i did in 2014

**lillipup03** (8): My mom ruined this song for me, now all I can hear is WHAT IS LOVE BABY DON'T HURT ME

**musical\_pyn** (8): The song sounds a little washed out for me after hearing it so much, but I can't deny how good it is

**notnotamotmot** (8): Hadn't listened to this song in years, but that disco beat holds up.

**racloves** (8): my dad loved this song like he doesn’t care that much for music but was heavy jamming to this when it came out

**steelstepladder** (8): Overplay has effectively killed this for me but I can still recognize a bop when I see it

**givebackmysweatshirt** (7.9): massively overhyped but still good

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): cute

**Kimchiprince** (7): lovely funky but trash

**skargardin** (7): this was voted in for what..?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ive been so overexposed to this song over the past almost 8(!) years that i feel nothing towards this anymore. still good though

cremeebrulee: ## I'm not like other girls, I don't listen to stuff on the radio <3

**TiltControls** (7): I've heard this song too much to properly appreciate it any more. It's fine, but nowhere near the best on the album

**yatcho** (7): honestly pharell sounds bored

**bespectacIed** (6): deserved its overratedness but I can't stand to listen to it anymore

Okay it anyone else kind of surprised how well this song did? ~~I mean I'm not because y'all will praise white women for the bare minimum all the time~~. Casanova is a bop but to me it's been overdue for an exit, so I'm not too sad to see this leave. 

---

## You're a heavenly creature

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Pure pop excellence.

**akanewasright** (10): This is a perfect song.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of her best songs, the bass is so simple but it stands out. the whispered bridge feels so obsessive and i love it

**hikkaru** (10): outsold the verite remix no it's true it's true

**ignitethephoenix** (10): so good, a Canadian icon

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Her 2nd best song besides Hello

**ManofOranges** (10): Probably the most surprising thing about the 2017 Electroflops Rate to me was seeing Allie X's performance in it. I was expecting her to get crushed, she actually had the highest album average of that rate, and she had the second place spot with this fantastic song. I'm glad she did so well, and I hope she does pretty well again.

**mudkip1** (10): iconic

**nightjesus** (10): Ugh Allie just fuck me up honestly.

**pebbleheights** (10): How have I never heard this song before???

**ReallyCreative** (10): literally one of her best songs, the way the chorus is constructed is just magical

**runaway3212** (10): incredible

**s4mmymusic** (10): this is h&mcore done RIGHT

**twat\_brained** (10): YOU'RE NO CASANOOOOOVAAAAAAAAAA btw still super bummed Allie's Cape God Tour didn't happen bc I would've seen her at Quartier des Festivales but it also meant I skimped out on seeing a girl who hates me but I have been seeing her on loads of Zoom parties lately so there's a bit of give and take in that sense

**vayyiqra** (10): Total banger. Allie has lots of good songs but I think CollXtion II is her best

**Vultuxe** (10): I actually think the solo version of this song is one of the worst on CollXtion II but I'm going to pretend this is the version with Verite which is one of her best.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): YOU'RE NO CASANOVA!

**1998tweety** (9.5): massive bop

**pat-rickstar** (9.3): Either of the 2 songs from this rate would've been a more worthy winner than disco t*ts

**Awkward\_King** (9): allie is possibly my favourite artist, and even on collxtion ii which is probably my least favourite of her works it still has so many gems, casanova is sublime

**CrimsonROSET** (9): What are the odds this has been used in an AMV?

**igorwithlicor** (9): Yes, yes sis! Love the beat

**notnotamotmot** (9): I love the beat to this song so much.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): i fuck with this.

**sirpancakeXI** (9): This song did fuck me over in a good way

**skargardin** (9): it slaps

**Stryxen** (9): this song is hot

**yatcho** (9): something about the allie x solo version just doesnt pop as much as the Verite version

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): kinda wish this was the VÉRITÉ remix actually but I do really like this song

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I love how the percussion builds into the explosive chorus that perfectly matches the vengeful lyrics. I think I like the Verite version better but both are really good, this one's just a bit more 'empty'.

**bbfan132** (8): it’s still very good but i’ve liked it less over time, unfortunately

**camerinian** (8): Kudos to this song for finally convincing me that Allie X isn't boring as tar

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Hikk's quadruple mashup outsold.

**frogaranaman** (8): pretty great bop

**LuisEnRod** (8): (tell me again why she’s never blown up)

**musical\_pyn** (8): Song is really chill, and I think it veers into too chill territory for me

**SmileAndTears** (8): bop

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): sounds very trendy

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): Allie X seems pretty cool, maybe I’ll check her out

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): I don’t get why Allie X isn’t super in-demand as a songwriter, I could see so many of her songs as hits with another singer

**joshually** (7): Not the best song on COLLXLKJTO but I still enjoy it

**racloves** (7): I honestly kinda flip flop between loving and hating this song

**steelstepladder** (7): Bit of a bop but a bit out classed

**timothy444** (7): Alright pop song, I guess

**waluigiest** (7): vintage deserved

**zagreux** (7): I love the song but something about the production is SO ANNOYING

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): cute and bouncy

**Brendon-Urine** (6): First time I've really listened to an Allie X song and it's alright.

**flavasavavandal** (6): Pop songs with a great build-up that leads into an extremely underwhelming chorus/drop with boring lyrics are a dime a dozen and deserve all the 6’s they get

**izeasklapaucius** (6): I like the new Cape God Allie X more than this. sorry :(

**seanderlust** (6): it's kind of boppy but it doesn't feel fully fleshed out? allie's vocal performance here feels unwilling to commit to a POV - either to lean into the "idgaf i'm gonna bop" vibe of the song or really being upset over the casanova fucking her over.

**anothertown** (4): I’m so sorry allie I don’t like this though

**givebackmysweatshirt** (3): me patiently waiting for this song to become interesting until the end but it never happened

**fadedblue09** (2): I have never heard a song with so many toxic-love metaphor clichés as this one.

We finally say goodbye to our first of three Carly Rae Jepsen songs. I honestly didn't think Julien was going to be the first to bite the bullet, but it seems like we have strong opinions on which songs from Dedicated we prefer. I truly love this song, it's so energetic and bouncy and I'm sad to see it go first. But to be fair, it is time we give the other girlies a chance, so I don't have a problem with saying a goodbye to Carly right now.

## In your heart, you must believe

**CritneySpearz** (11): if u dont like this song, ur homophobic

**akanewasright** (10): I posted this fresh thread, I have to give it a good score

**bbfan132** (10): bop alert

**bulforster** (10): Strong 11 contender right here, easily my favourite song from the pop girls' recent (pseudo-)disco revival efforts.

**celladonn** (10): This plays on regular rotation in the supermarket I work in and I have to restrain myself from doing a gay little dance in the aisles every time it comes on

**cherryices** (10): maybe not the best idea to make your opener the best song on the album

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is better than run away with me tbh

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of Carly’s best song ever. the glittery production is crack infused

**hikkaru** (10): one of the best opening tracks of recent memory, a full fledged BAWP

**hunnybee12** (10): it's great idc idc

**jasannn** (10): I'm forever haunted by our time.

**ManofOranges** (10): What's there to say about this song that hasn't already been said in this sub? It's great, I love it, Carly has done it again, etc. etc.

**NFLfreak98** (10): one of the better disco songs released in the past decade, not that that’s the highest bar or anything

**notnotamotmot** (10): <3<3<3 Pop perfection.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This not winning it's rate is why we don't deserve Disco Sweat (even though this isn't disco but let's not have that discussion again)

**ReallyCreative** (10): bitch it's the serve

**rickikardashian** (10): once again, in my mind, this song is about julien solomita, and each time i hear it i dream about him being mine

**Roxieloxie** (10): I'm very for this but i've only heard the first half of dedicate but I thought this was a very great opener

**skargardin** (10): one of her best i know that's right

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Justice for Disco Sweat

**twat\_brained** (10): psst. Calm still has the Jenna Julien podcast 40% discount. USE IT. BUT ALSO STAN CARLY.

**Vultuxe** (10): 100% the best song on Dedicated.

**waluigiest** (10): just a flawless pop song. It’s so fun!!! And an incredible album opener! I saw her on this tour and I love how she talks about the song, like she went on a few dates with Julien and he was very uninteresting but she thought his name was musical. I just love her so much

**worlds-okayest666** (10): stan Julian from Animal Crossing

**zagreux** (10): THIS is how one makes a bop, CRJ is serving slow glossy disco realness. The -shimmering- disco effect at the beginning of the chorus sounds great.

**yatcho** (9.8): that .2 is for the glitch before the second chorus, I HATE it

**anothertown** (9.5): The way this and No Drug Like Me fit her like a glove, so she went and made.. the whole rest of the album and side B…… girlie idk.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): one of my favs from the album but compared to lots here it’s not a fav

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): This is just so breezy and smooth and shiny. She really snapped on this

**Stryxen** (9.5): WOW it’s been a while since I’ve listened to this and I forgot just how good it sounds

**seanderlust** (9.3): this is a funky little number!!

**bespectacIed** (9): witnessing this live was a glorious experience

**bookthieving** (9): one of my favorite choruses here

**vayyiqra** (9): Remember when it was rumoured that Dedicated would be a disco album and then it wasn't? I'm okay with that but we did get this nu-disco kind of song and it was Good

**1998tweety** (8): This is probably one of my least fav songs on the album tbh. It's nice but I don't like the chorus a whole ton

**AHSWeeknd** (8): an amazing opener.

**bigbigbee** (8): This song reminds me of Barbie Beauty Styler the game on CD Rom (2002) https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/61T8QKTVGWL._AC_.jpg

**fadedblue09** (8): Cute but it's no Call Me Maybe or Turn Me Up

**frogaranaman** (8): it’s cute. this album is cute

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): this song sounds so good to me, like everything about it flows so nicely

**igorwithlicor** (8): Nice vibe, I really like the beat

**izeasklapaucius** (8): The glitch in the 2nd chorus still bothers me after i discovered it months ago :(

**musical\_pyn** (8): Not my favorite song from Dedicated but I admit captures that lovesick feeling really well

**nightjesus** (8): Carly is really an underrated pop Princess in the general population. I’m glad popheads pays attention to her. I liked Emotion more than Dedicated but that’s not saying this album lacked at all. This was a fantastic opener to the album. Such a smooth pop song.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): We didn't separate from indieheads to disrespect Carly like you guys are about to.

Holy crap, I thought this was a LOCK for Day 3 so imagine my shock when it hung around here for most of the rate. This song is INSANELY ROBBED and I'm not even a huge Kylie fan. It's pop perfection and just so fun to sing along to. I have no idea how many mediocre scores it took to tank all the 11s this got, but I guess you guys really thought this was overrated so it makes its  exit at the  end of Day 2. Maybe this will be the song to break the Closer Songeniality streak?

---

## Got no more to say...

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): VEGAS LET ME HEAR YOU MAKE SOME NOISE!!!

**ManofOranges** (11): This song gets me so pumped up with energy. I've choreographed very interesting dance moves to this song in my head because it fills me with a feeling of being able to overcome anything in my way. This song, despite being a runner-up, had an average higher than a huge chunk of actual rate winners, and I think that speaks to this song's greatness.

**nbapip** (11): rediscovered this at the beginning of locky d and it pulled me most of the way through. literal perfection

**nootnoot781** (11): ok so i put all the songs i was considering giving an 11 to into a random list generator and this won. will i regret this when the rate happens? quite possibly

**plastichaxan** (11): i love it it gives me that buzz

**skargardin** (11): nothing gives me instant serotonin quite like this song

**zagreux** (11): BOP. Get out of Kylie's way, bitch!

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE bop, one of the best pop songs I've ever heard. Def a contender for my 11.

**bbfan132** (10): that chorus… ugh perfection

**bulforster** (10): The chorus is one of the most delirious bursts of pure ecstasy in all of music.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): [gay screaming]

**CritneySpearz** (10): my gay awakening was seeing a bunch of gay pornstars poorly lip sync to this song on YouTube so thank you Kylie for making me gay

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this is one of my favorite pop songs of all time, and was my second choice for an 11

**fadedblue09** (10): Like Robyn, I don't seek out Kylie's genre of music but I can acknowledge its catchiness. This makes me want to storm out of a club on a rainy night (lowkey disappointed the MV was nothing like that).

**frogaranaman** (10): her best song lowkey

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Not to be, like, a gay separatist or whatever but I think that this really is one of those songs that plays differently for the gay community. Like I played it for a straight friend (as in sat her down and made her watch the video) and she said she liked it but she put it on a playlist and when it came on later she was like “what the fuck is this?” This kind of huge, anthemic electro pop just isn’t something that people mainly used to either mainstream radio fare or genres like hip-hop/rap/rock are going to understand, you have to fully buy into the pop bubble to understand this one but when you do WOW does it pop off. Not even my favorite song from this album, which I think is flawless.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): a bop that still bops, thank you Kylie

**hikkaru** (10): pop perfection. kylie is the QUEEN, if this isn't at least top 5 I will be upset

**MrSwearword** (10): stellar Kylie Minogue music, yath

**mudkip1** (10): love her

**notnotamotmot** (10): Some of Kylie's best work

**pat-rickstar** (10): Only 4 songs in to this rate and I'm so tempted to give this my 11

**ReallyCreative** (10): the quickest way to get a felony charge? be gay and listen to this while driving on the highway

**rickikardashian** (10): there is no heterosexual way to dance to this song

**runaway3212** (10): It should be illegal to bop this hard

**seanderlust** (10): i'm a simple man. I hear a mid-tempo dance track by a gay icon, I bop.

**TiltControls** (10): The queen's coming for her crown

**twat\_brained** (10): invented Alesso but also one of Kylie's 5 best songs in the last 15 years

**Vultuxe** (10): One of her best.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): one of the songs that made me stan Kylie...and it still fucking slaps!!

**yatcho** (10): yes im gay

**igorwithlicor** (9): Catchy, fun, great vibe. Love it!

**LuisEnRod** (9): (I didn’t wanna listen to this song for quite some time because it made me feel gay until I saw Kylie performing it in DWTS)

**musical\_pyn** (9): I wish the bridge went a little harder, but other than that I love this song

**nightjesus** (9): My queen. Kylie always deliverers. The queen of pop.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): me when i run people over with my car while listening to the pop music station in gtav

**timothy444** (9): If only we were rating Cool by Alesso :sob:

**vayyiqra** (9): I have some doubts about the lyrics to this song but will just put them aside because it makes me happy

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): it’s fine? I enjoy it but I don’t feel strongly about it

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): it's just fun :)

**Stryxen** (8.5): this song pushing its way to my top tracks this week on lastfm, WHY is it such a bop

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Kylie Minogue makes such beautiful bops.

**cherryices** (8): nothing groundbreaking, but very well executed

**flavasavavandal** (8): I like to imagine this song without those “gang vocals” that sound so poorly integrated and out-of-place. But I’m not rating my imaginary version of Get Outta My Way. I’m ranking the version that I heard, the version I hear is dragged down by that one small element

**wryn\_** (8): Despicably good

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): Pure, inoffensive dance pop, it sounds a little bit dated honestly, but it still bops

**jasannn** (7.5): basic but cute

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): It's good but also kinda forgettable? Idk this kind of dance pop just doesn't do it for me anymore

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this could be a krewella song

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): singing the chorus to “get outta my way” in 2021 has to be equivalent to living out the “move, i’m gay” gif

**akanewasright** (7): This is pretty cute

**nooodisaster** (7): Cute.

**pebbleheights** (7): This song is POWERFUL

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Y’all hyped this up too much, I’m whelmed.

**mynameistoo\_common** (6): rather generic but I like the glittery chorus. Unfortunately it seems like a less deft imitation of the 80s sparkle.

**camerinian** (5): Every time I see this title I'm reminded that I'd just rather be listening to Spinning Around than this Demi Lovato reject

I did not think we would say bye to another Carly song so soon after the first one. Unfortunately, it seems like we couldn't agree which Dedicated tracks deserved to be higher, leading to both of these track leaving late Day 2. I never got the hype for this particular track but even then, I'm sad to see it go ~~and make Call Me Maybe Carly's highest track~~ :/ Well best of luck to Ms. Jepsen in the Sub Flop Rates soon, it seems  like she'll need it.

## On the bed!

**jasannn** (11): carly + saxophones = perfection

**SmileAndTears** (11): She did what needed to be done, her best song by a long shot. Jack Antonoff can do no wrong

**1998tweety** (10): Carly surprisingly pulls off sexy so well, that outro is incredible.

**bbfan132** (10): the most ph-core song ever… and i’m with them on this

**bulforster** (10): The only Jack x Carly song that works for me, but this one time they struck gold.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): horny bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): maybe Jack Antonoff deserves some rights

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): The only bad thing about this song is that is so short, I normally enjoy edging but not like this Carly, Not. Like. This.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): probably my favourite Carly song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ANVAKDFVNAEUFVNDKJLFVNADIFJVNDAFV

**kappyko** (10): BRUTHFFHFHFFHFHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH this keysmash looks like a fart but if it was a fart it'd be for julien

**ManofOranges** (10): Watching this song's rate, the only thing that was more devastating to me than watching No Drug Like Me, Now That I Found You, and Too Much get cut too early was watching this song get cut too early. And yes, I know it got cut at #4, but even that's too early for this song. I would've loved to see it go all the way. It was an immediate stand out when I first heard Dedication and it still is to this day.

**plastichaxan** (10): her music just makes me so happy!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): Jack Antonoff stans will say this sucks but think Cumback is one of Carly's best, electric chair.

**rickikardashian** (10): at least one carly rae jepsen song will make the top 10, very likely higher… and i wont even be able to get mad at how predictable it will be, because when it’s right it’s right

**Roxieloxie** (10): So you might be asking yourself why I have never gone back to listen to the rest of dedicate, and its because this is literally my favorite song on the album and I feel no need to keep looking when this is clearly a top 3 song that Ms Jepson has decided to grace us with

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Pop perfection

**skargardin** (10): imagine hating pop perfection

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i would die for this song

**TiltControls** (10): Classic from the first time I heard it

**bookthieving** (9.5): love how this is one of carly’s sexier songs but she has a lot of fun with it and the production does too!

**runaway3212** (9.5): So fun and good, could be a little bit longer

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Carly said I’m going 80s and no one can stop me.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): strong contender for best song on dedicated

**jsonphile** (9): I want you in my room too Carly

**Kimchiprince** (9): <3

**musical\_pyn** (9): The chord progression in the prechorus is one of my favorite things Carly has ever done, and the rest of the song is really good as well

**notnotamotmot** (9): God I love horny Carly.

**steelstepladder** (9): I'm hesitant to give Carly good marks but this bops theres no denying

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): I kinda find this really fun

**seanderlust** (8.2): BIG screamalong anthem energy

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I'm kinda tired of dragging Jack at this point tbh.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): fun, just so much fun

**Stryxen** (8): why is this not me? is this too much to ask for?? was i not worthy??

**waluigiest** (8): this song makes me so fucking mad because it’s great but it’s so short like she just fully didn’t add a bridge. It’s incomplete.

**wryn\_** (8): Would be my favourite use of a talk box in a modern pop song if levitating didn't exist

**twat\_brained** (7.6): we voted this in but didn't have room for a Caroline song? Come on.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): cute

**igorwithlicor** (7): Don't feel any particular way about it

**nightjesus** (7): This song is way too short and the fade out annoys me. Like CARLY I need to hear that sax longer.

**s4mmymusic** (7): this album was such a step down from emotion idgaf

**team\_kockroach** (7): It’s just ok. Why do people consider this one of the best on Dedicated?

**timothy444** (7): Alright pop song, I guess

**Vultuxe** (7): It's cute... but short. Don't think it's as good as people think it is.

cremeebrulee: ## On the floor

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): I really love Jack Antonoff's work. I really love Carly's work. But whenever they make a song together, it doesn't work for me, it feels weirdly vapid and glossy

**CrimsonROSET** (6): The Carly choices? Rotten. Gutted. Gila monster.

**joshually** (6): the melody is pretty but there’s a weird sound to the beat that kind of detracts

**nooodisaster** (6): It's cheesy and kitchy but we all survived a pandemic & attempted coup so I'm giving this a few sympathy points.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): also inoffensive. I like the tropical vibe

**pebbleheights** (6): uncontroversial bop

**akanewasright** (5): I like this song but I’ve overplayed it and I don’t want it to win

**anothertown** (5): we get it the band bleachers

**frogaranaman** (5): background noise

**lillipup03** (5): I don't get the hype for a lot of Carly's stuff. Fight me, popheads.

**nowqueenofpop** (5): Boom boom boom boom I want you in my room let's spend the night together-

**CreepyMannequin** (4): sorry to a Canadian legend but both of her tracks in this rate are so boring

**MrSwearword** (4): decent production, terrible singer

**zagreux** (3.5): A cute bop, but I expected Carly x Jack to be better.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i hate the way she sings this

**bespectacIed** (1): My only skip on dedicated. Y'all seriously need to break free from the shackles of jack antonoff's bland repetitive production

**fadedblue09** (0): This trash narrowly escaped my zero in its rate, I think it's about time. Sorry not sorry. Should've been kept buried in her backyard along with Disco Sweat.

When I revealed that this song was voted in to the Discord, I was met with crickets. People were shocked that it had enough fans to give it a second chance, and again I'm sure they'll be shocked it made it this high! This song actually bordered onto Day 3 for some time, which I'm sure would've made some people really happy. This is a gorgeously sad song, but to me I never listen to it because it actually feels too hurtful and personal. We didn't get Ladders into this rate, but I'm glad we're nearly ending off Day 2 with a tribute to Mac. 


---

# I don't have funny headings for this 

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Am I delusional to think a ballad will win in an All-Stars? Yes. Do I Care? No. This deserves the 11. It's a track only Ari could've made, it hits all the right notes (figuratively and literally), it’s poignant, moving, personal and really portrays her unique situation in a beautiful way. I love this track so damn much, and anyone who thinks Into You is Ari's best song over this needs to go to Horny Jail

**1998tweety** (10): one of her bests. Im so happy she was pressured into making this song despite not wanting to.

**akanewasright** (10): This is a perfect song in my mind. One that does exactly what it sets out to do and finds genuine beauty along the way. This might have been my 11 if I didn’t know exactly how fruitless that would be. There are some dumb takes about this song out there 💀

**bbfan132** (10): beautiful albeit crushing ballad

**bespectacIed** (10): The emotional potency of this song is off the charts. One of her best. Rip mac

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I think this is Ariana's most heartbreaking song. The kinda washed out instrumental and her vocals come together so beautifully and are just pummeling. Into You is still my favorite of hers but this is up there.

**ChandelierFlickering** (10): so beautiful

**flavasavavandal** (10): This was one of the most devastating songs of 2019. It might not be as good as my score indicates but everything that surrounds this song just overwhelms my emotional response and I can’t help but love it unconditionally

**givebackmysweatshirt** (10): thank you scooter braun for forcing ari to put this song on the album lmao.

**hikkaru** (10): this song is so devastating and gorgeous. one of her best for sure

**hunnybee12** (10): her best ballad to date

**ignitethephoenix** (10): if this isn’t a top 5 Ariana song for you, you’re heartless and tastlesss tbh

**kappyko** (10): not listening to this ever again

**lillipup03** (10): Hard to listen to or really write about because it's so relatable for my life, but god this song is so beautiful.

**ManofOranges** (10): In this song's rate, I gave it a score of 5. Words cannot describe how deeply I regret that choice. At some point after that rate, I gave ghostin several more listens, thinking about what the song's about, and really, *truly* listening to it, and I came to realize that it's just oh so beautiful. The sheer contrast between beauty of the production and tragedy of the subject matter is so hypnotizing. And the way it ends with Ariana's absolutely breathtaking vocals just crescendoing and then dropping out the way they do. There's no other feeling like that.

**musical\_pyn** (10): From the synths to the lyrics this song just does such an incredible job of communicating the desire to let go of this ex but also the desire to hold onto the memories, even if doing the latter is more painful

**nooodisaster** (10): One of Ariana's rawest songs, it's just heartbreaking every fucking time.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Her best ballad, I adore the outro

**runaway3212** (10): Ariana I don't want to cry bye

**SmileAndTears** (10): 'He just comes to visit me when I'm dreaming every now and then' has to be one of the most heartbreaking and beautiful lines I've ever heard

**team\_kockroach** (10): Max Martin really pulled through

**twat\_brained** (10): we love you and we miss you Mac. Every single day.

**waluigiest** (10): in her recent efforts, Ariana’s best songs have been the painful, pre-breakup ballads (see also: Better Off). The vocal layers and nuanced writing are a subtle break from the rest of the album, and it all comes together and overwhelms the listener in the best way possible. I can close my eyes and feel completely lost in this song and in these emotions.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this song makes me cry like a lil bitch

**cherryices** (9.9): one of ariana’s most connected vocal performances. the outro is so dreamy

**bookthieving** (9.5): </3

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): "he just comes to visit me when I'm dreaming every now and then" god she broke my heart

**AHSWeeknd** (9): A discography highlight.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): brb crying

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): 💔

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (9): one of the best songs in tun, full of emotion and raw feeling

**igorwithlicor** (9): Nice, chill vibe. Beautiful vocals and music

**jasannn** (9): sad girl hours

**s4mmymusic** (9): the way i kinda despise this album except for this song

**skargardin** (9): beautiful

**Vultuxe** (9): Gorgeous song. Man, I miss the thank u, next era so bad.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.9): better than i remember

**seanderlust** (8.7): this song is honest to the point of honestly being kind of uncomfortable to listen to. I really love the maturity of this song.

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): This song is so sad :(

**wryn\_** (8.5): bit of a downer isnt it

**TiltControls** (8): I'm glad this was the Ariana song chosen since it's probably the best on the album (with NASA)

**vayyiqra** (8): : (

**zagreux** (7.5): yuh

**moonagenightmares** (7.2): the opening was so promising and the rest of the song kinda meh

**nightjesus** (7): ugh Ariana it’s gonna be okay gurl you’ll get past

**fadedblue09** (5): Big shrinker for me. I gave this a 10 before but I'm not sure if I'd do that now. In hindsight, this feels something she was expected to do and feels like a plastic attempt at being emotional. IMO, she even sounds more authentic singing '7 rings' or 'make up'.

To cap off Day 2, here's our last song! I'm not a huge fan of this one, but it's definitely a highlight for Miley and not a bad way to round off the day. This song actually hung around Day 3 for A WHILE but got pushed off imo for a more deserving song, so I'm not too mad. Miley will definitely be fine when we end up rating Plastic Hearts later.

---

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Miley Cyrus with Mark Ronson’s production is legendary. Also Late Night Feelings is one of my fave albums.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This was truly Miley's comeback.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This song is the only great thing Miley's put out tbh.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): should have been a bigger song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): thinking about how i hated this song for like a week when it first came out, yikes

**J\_Toe** (10): this sounds like if Jolene went to a disco. This country-disco sound is a perfect match for Miley (as is her 80s flashdance sound for Plastic Hearts, though)

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is great

**musical\_pyn** (10): This might be an unpopular opinion, but I actually prefer this kind of country-adjacent sound from Miley than something like Plastic Hearts, and I am so sad it wasn’t a bigger hit in the US

**pat-rickstar** (10): I'm giving out way too many 10s but idc, this song is excellent and so are all my other 10s

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): i think we've seen miley in this same groove or key a lot recently, and it works for her. but in listening to this song, i was reminded that miley needs good producers for her ideas to come across. this song does well what her entire recent album efforts fell a bit short with for me. it's referential without being in your face, and it's the closest thing to a musical identity that she's had ever.

**steelstepladder** (10): Anyone else feel obliged to give 10s to songs from rates they hosted?

**team\_kockroach** (10): Perfect strings. Perfect subversion of expectations in the chorus

**TiltControls** (10): Some of the best work from both Miley and Mark

**vayyiqra** (10): This isn't even the best song on Late Night Feelings yet it's great. That album was robbed

**zagreux** (10): THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE A BOP. TAKE NOTES, GIRLS!!

**yatcho** (9.7): her best song, no it's true it's true

**jackisboredtoday** (9.6): the fact that we didn’t get a whole album in this vein from Miley as soon as this song dropped still blows my mind. It’s the exact sound that fits her best

**anothertown** (9): The finest country pop that we have today. Fuck Kacey Musgraves

**jasannn** (9): why does country disco work so well?

**notnotamotmot** (9): When Miley is good, she's really good.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): her VOICE. And wow I need to listen to more mark ronson

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): it’s actually so fucking shameful that this song only peaked at 43 on the billboard 100 this shouldve been a top 20 hit easily

**timothy444** (9): Mark Ronson has this uncanny ability to team up with pop stars and create unconventional pop songs while still maintaining the quality we expect from him.

**twat\_brained** (9): imagine if this was on Joanne

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): This really was a precursor to all the good songs Miley was about to make, we just didn't know it yet

**bbfan132** (8): pleasant song to vibe to

**bulforster** (8): :pensive_cowboy:

**CrimsonROSET** (8): one of the funniest rate memories is in the disco revival how we revealed this before #3 because we knew this wouldn’t win so the tension would’ve been ruined

**pebbleheights** (8): Imagine if Dolly Parton were born in a different era. Miley’s voice is PERFECT for this song and this style.

**Vultuxe** (8): I remember when this released and people were so confused but pleasantly surprised. Rightfully so, it's still a great song.

**waluigiest** (8): I HATED this album but this song is good

**wryn\_** (8): I need more country disco in my life, is it really just this and high horse?

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): mildred's best song but it's grown off me a bit

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): this song suits Miley's voice so much

**igorwithlicor** (7): It's cool enough I guess?

**runaway3212** (7): I prefer Find U Again

**s4mmymusic** (7): i miss bangerz era miley

**skargardin** (7): if we can get a folklore 2 we can damn sure get a late night feelings 2

**SmileAndTears** (7): Those country-disco fusions just never work fully for me

cremeebrulee: **LuisEnRod** (6): (not a big fan but once a friend told me this was a “song for gays” so...)

**ManofOranges** (6): I really wish I enjoyed this song the way so many other people enjoy it, but I just can't. To me, while it's technically good, it doesn't do anything to push it past the point of just being a good song. It doesn't take me anywhere, it doesn't make me really feel anything. I can appreciate why other people like it, but I can't appreciate it on my own.

**nooodisaster** (6): I remember Smilers were so ready for this to be the cultural reset Uptown Funk was and it's... fine?

**Roxieloxie** (5): this feels like its building to something and then it just does not
