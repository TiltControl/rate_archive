**[All scores](https://paste.ee/p/ZM5am)**

**skargardin** (9): This song had a rocky climb to Day 3 (clock the graph!) but managed to sneak in towards the end of the rate process. As I expressed in my What's Your Pleasure? album writeup, I find this to be incredibly catchy with a lot of interesting production elements. Honestly, I probably would've preferred a couple other songs to take this song's place in Day 3 (Dance Floor Darling, In Your Eyes etc. I'm looking at you) but I'm not too mad at it seeing that it's the first song out today.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): The bassline is incredible, but the song doesn't really get going until the bridge/outro bit. Still slaps.

---

#[Ooh la la lalala la la](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RJqkUkmOUVw)

**jasannn** (11): If you're going to do camp, you better make every part of the song, from the lyrics to little details of the production catchy as hell.

**qazz23** (11): This one really grew on me the most. I like the bassline, the outro, and the little guitar flourishes throughout. I wish I could give an 11 two (two) times!

**targetguest** (11): I've been with a man 7 years now but didn't know I was gay until I listened to this song

**1998tweety** (10): this is a fkin serve oh WOW

**Awkward\_King** (10): me when im a city but im a sexy city

**bespectacIed** (10): orgasm

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I feel like I should be doing a mini-rate within this rate of best bass lines. This would place VERY high, probably second (I have first in my mind already)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this so glam and catchy. The bass line in the production is my favorite thing here.

**Leixander** (10): DRIVING FAST DRIVING FAST TECHNICOLOR STREET LIGHTS

**mudkip1** (10): there was a point in time where tidal uploaded this song incorrectly and like 8 seconds of the middle of the song was missing. but i thought it was intentional in some weird way because i never doubt miss jessica's talentry

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Funky bassline? ✅ Catchy Hook? ✅ Certified BOP? ✅

**shockdbinary** (10): if i was in a car listening to this song, i sure would hit the car.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The instrumental to this is so dirty, I love it

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): cheeky fun, and the bridge/outro is so deliriously fun

**bbfan132** (9.5): super fun single, not my favorite but still great!!

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): https://media.tenor.com/images/70c4c2a5f4b0da756d415c303fa53723/tenor.gif

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): violet chachki couldnt

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Better random sound effects than Hyperpop or The Blessed Madonna

**wavingwolves** (9.3): love this talking heads song

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.2): Love the way the bass struts

**AGM301** (9): the bass ugh break my heart tease

**artzpop** (9): i feel so posh listening to this

**daretheghost** (9): The bouncy bass, the Chic vibe, the way the car sounds at the beginning startle me every time, the BRIDGE. The serve. Docked a point only because I wish I could pick Jessie’s voice out of the verse harmonies.

**EnCaine** (9): i'm bringing chivalry back. those other (..?) don't know how to act(?) i'm flopping rn but this song is so suave

**just\_thonking** (9): This song in my mind has the exact opposite energy of drivers license

**Misentro** (9): The song is fine but it absolutely ascends at DRIVING FAST DRIVING FAST

**musical\_pyn** (9): there are like four hooks in this song and they’re all great

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): Single-handedly revived chivalry

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): the synth alone, the sound effects, the backing vocals, the sheer amount of sex pouring off of it. it's amazing!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): The playful retro vibe is really charming, this grew on me quite a bit, though the superior Ooh La La is still by Goldfrapp! Stream both!

**Stryxen** (9): these lyrics are far too cute i'm about to play this on repeat once im done

**vayyiqra** (9): Switch me on / Turn me up / I want to touch you /You're just made for love / [Chorus] I need la la la la la la / I need ooh la la la la whoops wrong song. Anyway this is a really strong track with a very solid groove. Listen to that bass and the guitar licks. This is a SLAPPER

**waluigiest** (9): it’s silky, funky bliss

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Great playful track

**Chevsapher** (8.9): Ridiculously cheeky, but still a strong track. The "cigarettes on the dash" (basically the bridge, but positioned between at the final chorus) is one of my favorites moments on the album.

**geraldinewww** (8.9): i don't looooove the singing part but the BASSSSSSS

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): When this came out I didn’t care for it much but in the context of the album it’s rather nice

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): the outro really spiced up the whole song

**bulforster** (8.2): The bassline hard carries to the outro.

**SmileAndTears** (8.2): Amazing bridge

**Alumineous** (8): Protect your hole, I mean, door.

**astrologicalangel** (8): the chorus of voices is a little weird, but damn if it isn't catcy

**booksandplantsand** (8): cute lil bop, greatly enhanced by the small sound effects

**conceptualromance** (8): chivalry was dead but you revived it!

**Exaltatus** (8): Great, but wish it was a bit longer or switched it up a bit.

**frogaranaman** (8): lookin’ for Ms like I lost a friend, jump out of my bed like “where’s the bread?”

**KennyEarthman** (8): that bassline really makes the song

**KuhBus** (8): Not a huge fan of some of the higher notes in this, but it's still very good.

**lolcevan** (8): i love how she delivers the line ‘that would make me happy’

**Parabox314** (8): A little less sexy than wyp but still kinda horny.

**proscett** (8): a little weaker than the others but those sound effects are chef's kiss

**Turpamutteri** (8): The bass line is cool

**cherryices** (7.5): great instrumental but i’m not vibing with the vocal melody here

**nooodisaster** (7.5): "Chivalry was dead but you revived it" is one of those lines so good you're shocked no one's written it before. This production is super kitschy and only Jessie could get away with it for me. Probably the funniest song here, or as Jessie said, "very cheeky".

**runaway3212** (7.5): super bouncy and fun

#Oh...

**seanderlust** (7.5): a little boring, but the musical flourishes are very interesting

**ManofOranges** (7): Girl I've had too many conversations with straight guys to think that chivalry is anything other than 6 feet under

**pat-rickstar** (7): Enjoyable but one of the more generic songs here

**thedoctordances1940** (7): it's good, but some parts of the instrumental are a little bit annoying

**akanewasright** (6.5): This grew on me a little. It’s so... flirty and tongue in cheek

**AHSWeeknd** (6): the producer on this said “sound effects bestie!!”

**Vromega** (6): I hated it at first but now it's just fine. I just do not feel anything listening to this

**maxrocks329** (5): On paper I should like this song but something about it just doesn't do it for me

**throwaway9374929** (0): i dont hate this anymore after relisten but theres still nothing about it that stands out

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): My initial favorite from the album eventually faded into the background with subsequent listens, though it still remains a certified bop™.

**skargardin** (9): This is a really fun one, but unfortunately it just misses out on the top ten! This is another fun and groovy track but as the rate comes down to the absolute wire I think ultimately this is a good placement. If you all haven't watched the brilliant video for this which showcases a dancer in a bowling alley I IMPLORE  you to watch it. THAT is how you do a music video on a budget and makes it look super expensive.

#Come Into My World (Radio Edit) - Radio Edit

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Wow, this track is phenomenal, the harmonies in the chorus are divine, the strings kicking in to deliver 70's cop movie chase vibes, it all just comes together to create this fantastic, elegant disco masterpiece

**AHSWeeknd** (10): take notes pop girls this is how it’s done.

**Alumineous** (10): 10,000 steps a day keeps the doctor away.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I absolutely have to stan this for the brass. Chills every time.

**corrodedbeauty** (10): me manifesting my crush’s attention

**jayjaysortagay** (10): the Earth, Wind and Fire vibes are immaculate

**Leixander** (10): pure happiness

**lolcevan** (10): THIS IS SO GOOD!!!!

**mudkip1** (10): the instrumental for this is so stunning

**pat-rickstar** (10): I have a feeling this is going to be underrated. One of the best instrumentals in the rate, this is an 11 contender for me

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this goes off

**runaway3212** (10): The vocal performance here reminds me of I Need A Hero by Fairy God Mother

**shockdbinary** (10): groovy groovy GROOOOOOvy

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the chorus are giving me life

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I am attracted to Bowling Twink in the music video

**wavingwolves** (10): layers and layers of harmonies yassss

**EnCaine** (9.8): i feel like i'm being so extra by not giving this the ten it deserves but i want to nudge it just slightly under the other 10s on this record because it feels right to do that

**Chevsapher** (9.7): The drawn-out chorus leading into the staccato hook is so smart. The combination of instruments in the arrangement is eclectic, but it works because of the strength of the songwriting.

**1998tweety** (9.5): good lorde this is a tune

**bbfan132** (9.5): doesn’t go all the way for me but the production is immaculate

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): The gay son to In Your Eyes respected middle aged actress.

**jasannn** (9.5): Kahoot music but make it gay!

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): James Bond COULDN'T he flopped, he could NEVER have a theme like this!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): the orchestra bits in this! straight out of the 70s

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): My favorite vocal performance. I love how she whisper-sings on this track. It just works so well and I adore how she sings “Now’s. The. Time. To. Step. Into. My. Life.” in the chorus.

**frogaranaman** (9): step on me

**lexarqade** (9): So chill. I LOVE the video for this too, gives me huge Tarantino vibes.

**Misentro** (9): Dripping in disco

**proscett** (9): this grew on me like months after the album dropped, and now i come back to it regularly lol

**vayyiqra** (9): The song on this album that sounds the most like actual disco, I fear, and it's great.

**waluigiest** (9): come thru glockenspiel!!!

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): The way Jessie sings this song fully convinces me that she really feels the lyrics, so good!

**bulforster** (8.8): We Got Together's stepping stomps this.

**akanewasright** (8.5): The song was nice but also... the bowling twink in the video owns my life

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): This song feels like I am listening to a James Bond theme song omg.

**engifear** (8.5): So sexy

**musical\_pyn** (8.5): I don’t like the hook as much as I like the rest of the song so I can’t give this a higher score but it’s still so good

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This is where the album kind of falls off for me, but a dip in quality is still very good

**targetguest** (8.5): nows. the. time. to. step. into. my. life.

**astrologicalangel** (8): I feel sparkly listening to this

**Awkward\_King** (8): jessie ware hates people in wheelchairs omg

**booksandplantsand** (8): oh YEAH we are GROOVING

**daretheghost** (8): The first song I don’t love. It’s fine. It’s fine! But not as strong as others on the album.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is groovy and I love the grand orchestral production on here

**KuhBus** (8): Lovely rhythm and strings.

**ManofOranges** (8): Me to any guy does anything nice for me

**MrSwearword** (8): this is serving some disco live performance realness but again, Jessie is NOT the vocalist y'all think she is.

**nooodisaster** (8): The instrumental breakdown.... chef's kiss. Everything here is really good, great even, though it's one of the less memorable tracks for me personally. Definitely one to slut drop to, tho.

**Stryxen** (8): right now? your wish is my command jessie

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): The lyrics of this song start with eyes; the transitions in this album!!

**KennyEarthman** (7): brings something different while still contributing to the atmosphere of the album

**Parabox314** (7): Not a bad track, kind of middling to me. Love some of the vocals.

#I'd rather stay away

**conceptualromance** (6): there’s a lot of good stuff here, but I don’t feel like it all quite works together

**maxrocks329** (6): The music video makes this song 1000 times better

**cremeebrulee** (5): the instrumental saves this tbh, i don’t like the chorus at all so i never revisit this

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I was like “there’s a song on this album that had a chorus that I thought sounded stupid but I forget which one it was” and it was this one.

**skargardin** (8): For the longest time, Kylie was not going to make Day 3 at all, and as the results rolled in, me and Niki gossiped about what a gag it would've been. Well, as it happens, Magic managed to pull a mid rate process push to Day 3 and ultimately the top ten, becoming Kylie's highest rated song from DISCO! Honestly I am a bit stunned that Magic out of all DISCO songs is the highest rated one? What about Say Something, Dance Floor Darling, Supernova etc? I like this song a lot but not nearly a lot as some of my absolute favourites on the album. Ultimately, I think it's for the best that Kylie made Day 3 and top ten because I would've felt terrible if she hadn't made it even if it would've made for a gag and a half.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Kylie releasing the synthpop confections Magic and Say Something as the first two singles from the album called **DISCO** is a real head-scratcher. This song is the worse of the two.

---

#Magician vibes only

**rickikardashian** (11): there should be more claps in this

**1998tweety** (10): that chorus is so excellent

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): What a great track to start off the album. When the horns come in on the chorus? Magic. The strings in the outro? Magic. The entire song? Magic. Yes, I believe in magic, Kylie.

**AGM301** (10): instant bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I mean no, but I guess I believe in magic when I watch AHS Coven

**bespectacIed** (10): My favorite discovery in this rate

**Brendon-Urine** (10): instant seratonin, come get your instant seratonin

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): almost every one of kylie's album openers is pop perfection and this is no exception. it just beautifully sets the tone of euphoria for the record

**Exaltatus** (10): Just a triumphant beginning for an album with no skips.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): ✨✨✨✨✨✨✨

**hikkaru** (10): magician queen

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a massive bop, honestly one of my favorite songs in this rate. Kylie will definitely be decimated this rate but if people have taste this should be top 5

**jasannn** (10): So simple but so fun. Also, do you all remember Magic by Selena Gomez for Wizards of Waverly Place? That was my bop when I was a kid and it's still pretty good ngl.

**KennyEarthman** (10): the chorus of this song is magic

**Leixander** (10): i can't be the only person who thinks this is eerily similar to Robbie William's Feel

**lexarqade** (10): LOVE this song.

**LuisEnRod** (10): Houdini has been real quiet since this song came out

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm literally obsessed with this song like yall have no idea. There would be nights when my roommates would be gone and I wouldn't have shit to do so I'd just listen to this song and dance around the living room and pretend that my life has any bit of magic to it at all rather than being the boring ass slog that it is. Legitimately an 11 contender for me.

**maxrocks329** (10): If only the rest of the album was this good

**Misentro** (10): Chained to the Rhythm walked so Magic could run.

**mudkip1** (10): iconic

**musical\_pyn** (10): such a strong opener, one of the best tracks in this entire rate

**Parabox314** (10): Yes that IS happening. Stunnin.

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): It gives me H&M vibes but I really like it! I’ve listened to this so many times now and it still slaps

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): kylie, baby, you will always have my heart.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This isn't really disco, but I don't care, it's such a mega-bop I just can't be upset when listening to it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Sets the joyful tone right away

**TiltControls** (10): Kylie chose all the best singles for the lead up to this album

**daretheghost** (9.5): Solid opener that sits well with the rest of Kylie’s work.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Definitely one of my favorites on the album and among the lower tier of “favorite Kylie tracks” (which is admittedly a very stacked list). It functions as a great thesis statement for the album (painting the dance floor as a magical place where you can escape your worries) and the lyrical imagery is a lot of fun! The chorus is fantastic and it’s definitely addictive but it’s missing a killer edge for me to take it to a 10.

**jexan13** (9.5): cocaine

**Chevsapher** (9.2): The songwriting is clunky at times, but this track's joyfulness makes it a delightful album opener. It's quintessentially Kylie in the best way possible.

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): a great opener, sets the tone for the whole album

**akanewasright** (9): This song is simply adorable and boppy.

**Alumineous** (9): Great start to the album. It's unfortunate that it only gets worse from here.

**bbfan132** (9): i feel like i should be listening to this at a roller skating rink while dancing around

**booksandplantsand** (9): what a great album opener!

**conceptualromance** (9): maybe I DO believe in magic

**EnCaine** (9): I like this a lot!

**jongin\_is\_shy** (9): An immediate Kylie classic

**luckyphase** (9): euphoric

**nooodisaster** (9): Flashback to when my best friend made me watch Now You See Me and we got into a huge argument over the concept of magic and whether believing in it was ignorant or celebratory.

**pros-and-connors** (9): Jenifer Coolidge Voice makes me wanna roller skate real bad

**qazz23** (9): Solid opener

**runaway3212** (9): super fun and bouncy

**targetguest** (9): This album is incredibly important to me, and this song, to me, best represents the entire collection

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the single version is better because the longer verses don't add anything

**waluigiest** (9): idk but it feels like her music is made to be listened to in the car

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): A very fun, lighthearted song!

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): I didn't like this at first but I've decided to stop hating fun and just embrace it

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): A cute opener

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): This is the weakest single out of the three but it is still very catchy

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I don't believe in Magic but I would lie to Kylie and tell her that I did

**cherryices** (8.2): very charming, in typical kylie fashion!

**SmileAndTears** (8.2): bop

**ACORGIORGY** (8): feels like a disco version of a forgotten Fever era single

**frogaranaman** (8): I got the magic in me, everytime I touch that track it turns into gold

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): I believe in magic now!?

**lolcevan** (8): i love chained to the rhythm

**MrSwearword** (8): it made better sense than goddamn Say Something as a single and has disco charms to it, but I've actually softened my feelings to this song enough to give it good marks.

**Stryxen** (8): someone in the listening party mentioned it sounds like there should be two claps after every other line in the chorus and it just feels empty now - this is an entire bop tho

**thedoctordances1940** (8): There's no doubt that this is a really fun track, but it isn't really much more than that.

**wavingwolves** (8): could have used a little more magic but it bops

#BAYONETTA SWEETIE?

**geraldinewww** (7.6): something about this one gives me bayonetta vibes. that bit right before the end...

#It's like been like little over half a year at best sob

**banananaise** (7.5): it's been like a year and i still honestly have no idea how to feel about this song

#It's just smoke and mirrors I fear..

**Flegasaurus** (7): i don't believe in magic

**Vromega** (7): I don't believe in magic, the lyrics are very boring but overall a good single without pretention.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Speed it up and add more strings and synths and it would bang.

**oscarbrierley1** (6): kinda boring

**proscett** (6): solid opener but not really something i'd come back to

**Awkward\_King** (4): i cant shake the association that it sounds like it was made by a child in that it just feels so... juvenile?

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I'm glad this version exists, and I'm also glad that the other one was chosen as the real Jealousy.

**skargardin** (7): I'm a fool for not scoring this higher in hindsight.

#JEALOUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

**Leixander** (10): this song is 11/10 in any form

**Stryxen** (10): whole entire bop

**ACORGIORGY** (9): this still stomps

**bbfan132** (9): i like the main version a bit more but this mix is great!

**bespectacIed** (9): outsold the original

**ReallyCreative** (9): a really great mix but I prefer the original

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.3): The song is at its core so, so good, but this doesn't come close to the album version (or the transcendent Extended Mix) for me

**daretheghost** (8): The energy of the album version is unmatched.

**wavingwolves** (8): YASSSSSS PILLS ALL THE WAY

**Exaltatus** (7): Never cared for house remix personally, but with that material it's working with, it ain't bad.

**KennyEarthman** (7): not as iconic as the original version but it's ok

**Chevsapher** (6.9): I know I would adore this if it were three or four minutes long. There's just not enough here to keep it interesting for nine minutes, which is a shame, because those basslines are amazing.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): imagine having a jealous sea

**booksandplantsand** (5): shooketh that a 5-year-old release was so masterfully adapted to the new album

#I'm so sorry

**lolcevan** (1): i don’t like this

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): [This last.fm shout](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/704742162843303957/816219731333349386/unknown.png) said everything better than I ever could. This used to be my 11 for the longest time, but I had to give in to We Got Together.

**skargardin** (10): Sorry The Kill stans but this is as far as it goes! Many of you all have expressed this being your favourite on the album and with good reason. Just as In Your Eyes this is another cinematic masterpiece that perfectly captures this one late night emotion effortlessly. This is another example of where the video is absolutely stunning on a budget so pleeease watch it if you haven't!!

---

#Bitch, she died

**jongin\_is\_shy** (11): It moves my insides like no other song before, still holding a grudge against a pophead user that said it was similar to Boys Will Be Boys.

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): I’VE BEEN WAITING MY WHOLE LIFE TO FIND SOMEONE WHO MAKES ME FEEL LIKE YOU DOOOOO!!!!!!

**oscarbrierley1** (11): this song really transports me to another place, I love it

**pietrohonkhonk** (11): This song is absolutely amazing. The synth line, the vocals, the violins (or whatever the instrument is), it’s all there. Also, I played this song for my dad and he loved it, so you know it’s good.

**shockdbinary** (11): it was love at first sight, it killed me. the story told, the soundtrack to a James Bond film. SHE KILLED ME.

**SmileAndTears** (11): oh bitch, this is it. This is A SONG!!!!!

**theburningundead** (11): I come back to this song the most out of any on WYP, it has such an addictive quality to it. It feels intense and captivating, a perfect execution of the understated elegance that makes Jessie Ware such a talent. It's a magical song to listen to late at night.

**TorchickenNuggets** (11): !!!!!!!!!!

**wavingwolves** (11): when this goes out on early day 2 and i blame it on one of the hosts 🥰😍😘💅🏻

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): If you were to change the production into something more orchestral, this would make a killer (pun fully intended) James Bond theme song.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THAT PRODUCTION

**bespectacIed** (10): fuck

**conceptualromance** (10): this song is sexy AF

**daretheghost** (10): for the outro alone but the whole song is immaculate. I’ve heard people say this song gives them ABBA vibes and I don’t know that I hear it but I know this song is as exquisite as half their discography.

**engifear** (10): So sexy

**Flegasaurus** (10): POGGERS

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): It really makes me want to seduce and kill a man omg

**JackStrait** (10): The intro sounds EXACTLY like it could be from a US Girls song

**jexan13** (10): I cannot descibe how beautiful this song is. I'm ded.

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): This is my favourite moment of the album, and one of my favourite songs of the year! Stands out from a tracklist with such a consistent vibe, but it somehow fits perfectly and sets the stage for the (also lovely) closer. I just adore it, especially the way the chords move against the melody in the chorus ("and I'll tell you everything inside"). Such a great song

**lolcevan** (10): the build up throughout this song is so excellent. love this one

**luckyphase** (10): it brought me to tears... I haven’t been this moved by a song since I was 12

**Misentro** (10): Dark and sinister in such a melancholy way. "I follow you through the night like a dog with the scent of your cologne" is an album highlight lyrics-wise.

**musical\_pyn** (10): ugh the atmosphere of this song is incredible, i can get lost in this forever

**plastichaxan** (10): alright imma transcend this is so beautiful

**qazz23** (10): I love the outro with the brassy section after the 3 minute mark

**ReallyCreative** (10): it's a little slow at first but that build up on the back half is delicious

**runaway3212** (10): the best song on this album tbh

**sirpancakeXI** (10): loving the dark vibe

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This song is absolutely beautiful. The production is so lush and make Jessie sound almost angelic and combine that with the great melody, you get the best track on the album.

**Vromega** (10): the 30 first seconds are already so good the song can't be bad. The addition of the vocals are very smooth with this great instrumentation and overall it's a real pleasure to listen to this song

**akanewasright** (9.5): this sounds makes me feel like a woman in a very long dress and obnoxiously posh gloves that go to her elbows descending a staircase very slowly.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): this song is so gorgeous and rich omg …….. its top 5 on the album for me personally but i know that the more boppy songs are gonna outrank it :woeis:

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This song was a massive grower for me, can't believe I thought it was boring when the album came out

**seanderlust** (9.5): i was gonna make a joke referencing "in for the kill" by la roux, but you know what i'm done pitting bad bitches against each other

**Chevsapher** (9.2): More layered vocals and strings—executed flawlessly, of course. The unexpected chords add some pizzazz.

**1998tweety** (9): I ascend at the end

**bbfan132** (9): i really like how this song gradually gets more intense/builds up

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): she killed me with this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): [Give “Killshot” by Magdalena Bay your 11s in the EP Rate!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/lw5ds0/2020_ep_rate_bree_runway_christine_and_the_queens/)

**just\_thonking** (9): So beautiful

**LuisEnRod** (9): reminds me of Monument by Röyksopp ft. Robyn with its whole dark, mysterious vibe.

**nooodisaster** (9): The lyrics here are dead simple: when you love someone deeply you feel vulnerable to them, to the point they could do anything to you. But the way James builds this song to it's god-like refrain, with the choir going in every direction, until it evaporates to the brass... Yeah the last 2 minutes of this are The Ki11.

**Parabox314** (9): Instant classic. Love this!

**proscett** (9): jessie served the ultimate bond theme. i'd give this a 10 if i hadn't given like 8 other 10s already lol

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9): Best disco outro I've ever heard.

**EnCaine** (8.7): i was gonna riff on jared leto and 30 seconds to mars here, but i didn't feel like dedicating that much thought to him when i could just listen to jessie ware send me to heaven instead

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): For some reason this reminds me of Andromeda by Weyes Blood, but with a disco beat

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Those horns 😩😩😩

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): Really dark and moody, but in a really good way

**frogaranaman** (8): let’s kill this love

**maxrocks329** (8): I'm surprised by how much I like this one; I feel like it should be boring but it just isn't somehow

**sarcasticsobs** (8): it’s a slower song so it’s a goner

**vayyiqra** (8): I'm going in for the kill / I'm doing it for a thrill / Oh, I'm hoping you'll understand / And not let go of my hand whoops wrong song

#Very much alive

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is gorgeous but not a fav

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): this is more understated than the rest of the music here, but I really like the vibe on this track

**booksandplantsand** (7): slow and vampy but I just want to get to the closer. i know this might be a hot take

**KennyEarthman** (7): has an ending credit vibe

**Stryxen** (6.5): it’s a great song don’t get me wrong but i’m simply balladphobic <3

**Exaltatus** (5): It's complicated, and I can't lie, I don't really care about this one.

**jasannn** (5): It makes me sleepy.

**Awkward\_King** (4): me when i kill someone

**ManofOranges** (4): This is the one track on the album where I just straight up can't remember how it goes like at all.

**MrSwearword** (1): this is just needlessly dour and also far too 80s but overdone for me

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This is indeed how we want it, and this is indeed how Jessie is giving it to us. Fiery masterpiece!

**skargardin** (10): But what a banger. I'm really happy that this made top ten honestly. The synths are so fun and the way they cascade over the song make me melt honestly and then we have the bassline which is absolutely killer too. Among the first couple What's Your Pleasure? tracks this definitely has a bit of more glamour and pizzazz to it than say Ooh La La. Looking at what's left in the rate however, I do think this is a worthy placement for it!

---

#That's how you want it

**Keno477** (11): Such a dance anthem, iconic

**WillamThunderfuck** (11): Tracks that fill my body with a rush of energy are the bane of my existence. This song just makes me want to get up and dance dramatically through my house! Amazing amazing amazing!!!

**1998tweety** (10): the Chemical Plant Zone serve

**AGM301** (10): earworm!!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): if this song was called magic it would be the best song called magic in the rate

**bbfan132** (10): i could dance to this for hours, such a fun song!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): Best song on this goddamn stunning album

**buddhacharm** (10): I always got a very distinct Janet vibe from this song

**bulforster** (10): I swear there's crack in this song.

**cremeebrulee** (10): a smash, would be my 11 if roisin wasn’t here

**daretheghost** (10): WOO!

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/InferiorFilthyAnura-max-1mb.gif

**Gonza\_90** (10): This was one of my most played songs of last year for a reason

**KennyEarthman** (10): this evaporated my soul

**mudkip1** (10): i love screaming the chorus

**proscett** (10): jessie ware is God

**qazz23** (10): Love the shimmering synths here

**RandomHypnotica** (10): That synth at the start really made me nervous I was gonna hear Axel F for a second. Fortunately, Jessie instead delivered a megabop

**ReallyCreative** (10): my Christian upbringing describing what Satan has over me

**runaway3212** (10): Gets better every time I hear it

**seanderlust** (10): youth pastor sitting backwards in a chair voice "yeah okay this jessie where is pretty cool, but you know who really controls your soul? the Lord."

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This song makes me want to hook up with strangers in a club (not during a pandemic of course)

**shockdbinary** (10): it was here that she took control of my soul and made me give 10 to all the songs.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): This song is what make me want to check out this amazing album so it is automatically a 10.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This was my favorite song on the album the first time I heard it. Noiw it's behind Step Into My Life and Remember Where You Are, but it's still a 10, baby

**targetguest** (10): This was the first song that clicked with me on my first album run through and I'm so grateful it forced me to relisten

**vayyiqra** (10): This, ironically, sounds way more to me like what I think Róisín Murphy sounds like than anything in rate that is literally by Róisín Murphy does. If you told me this was a long-lost outtake from Overpowered, and I had never heard it before, I would most likely believe it.

**waluigiest** (10): this is the essence of summer 2020 to me

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): WE TOUCH AND IT FEELS LIKE... WOO!

**Chevsapher** (9.8): Definitely one of the more accessible tracks on the album. It's more like 80s post-disco music than actual 70s disco, with that synthesizer bassline and and fast-talking chorus. The outro is pure shimmery retro goodness.

**geraldinewww** (9.6): baby it's automatic

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): The production on this is just amazing. I don’t know what the right term for it is but that 8-bit sounding piece at the beginning just takes the song to another level.

**musical\_pyn** (9.5): the intro is a little weak but the rest of the song is great

**ACORGIORGY** (9): baby it’s automatic

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Jessie Ware is a time traveller from 1979 trying to revive disco, confirmed

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Another strong contender for best bass line.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Walking in slippery areas requires Sole Control

**luckyphase** (9): this track is usually where I get too hyped and start the album over because it’s so good

**maxrocks329** (9): The synth guitar or whatever that sound is at the end slaps

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): this song is such a grower

**nooodisaster** (9): Another absolute banger, Jessie is absolutely a disco GODDESS here. Feels like a timeless classic that was finally found, and since she said she was going for Janet Jackson with this one, that doesn't come as a surprise.

**pat-rickstar** (9): I commented on the song When You Sleep in the indieheads rate that the outro sounded familiar and I later realised it sounds similar to the outro of this song

**jackisboredtoday** (8.9): what can i say i'm a sucker for rhyming titles and this song slaps harder than most others that exist in the world

**EnCaine** (8.5): you know you're doing something right when soul control is one of the lesser songs on your album holy shit

**SmileAndTears** (8.4): bop

**wavingwolves** (8.1): ended automatic by red velvet

**engifear** (8): So sexy

**jasannn** (8): Not one of the most notable tracks on here but that synthy outro is a highlight of the album.

**LuisEnRod** (8): that kazoo sound that is present throughout the song really drives it home for me

**Parabox314** (8): I often forget about this one when thinking back but it really delivers and reels me in again. The bridge and guitar outro are magnificent.

**conceptualromance** (7.5): I love the bridge on this one

**Alumineous** (7): It's definitely a song I have to be in the right groove for. It's very danceable, but otherwise, I just skip it.

**Exaltatus** (7): I'd never skip it, but it's not one of the songs I come back to.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I really hate the keyboard throughout it’s super annoying. This just feels like ooh la la’s lesser sister.

**Stryxen** (7): we touch and it feels like … woo!

#No Jessie, that's not how I want it

**booksandplantsand** (6): pretty indifferent but it's solid

**Vromega** (6): not a fan of the chorus. I know that's the point but it sounds too jerky for me.

**ManofOranges** (3): It's just very boring to me

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm not your toy, you stupid boy!

**skargardin** (10): This being the highest rated song of Róisín in the bonus rate has me shaking, we love to see it truly! I think this could've worked really well on Róisín Machine actually. A dancefloor filler for sure. The bass is so dirty and sexy, try not to move your body to this honestly.

#We definitely are a thing

**banananaise** (10): even the cover art is a masterpiece. everyone say thank you róisin

**getin2it** (10): , (can I use an 11 in the bonus if I used it in the normal rate????) literally one of my favorite songs of all time and SEVERELY UNDERRATED

**musical\_pyn** (10): oh i LOVE this

**Stryxen** (10): plaything more like bopthing

**waluigiest** (10): okay hold up. This is an instant obsession. If I was on the dance floor and this came on I really think it would be over for me

**wavingwolves** (10): finally something that i can give a maximum rating :slowcherry:

**Chevsapher** (9.2): WOW, this is ridiculously punchy. I need more time with it to form a proper opinion, but on first listen, I'm blown away.

**cremeebrulee** (9): “play with me til u get bored” - every ex of mine

**daretheghost** (9): I don’t want to just say “Bop!” but… Bop!

**jayjaysortagay** (9): this is better than anything on the album

**kirby31200** (9): Disco ASMR

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): sexy and fun

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.4): A pinch a' salt

**AHSWeeknd** (8): bop

**KennyEarthman** (8): um... this is kinky

**skargardin** (10): Prior to the album's release, this was my favorite pre-release single and at the time my personal SOTY. I'm so happy that it got treated with a longer intro for the album version as it allows the prodcution to really settle you into the song before the first verse. Ugh, this is so insanely gorgeous and longing in the best way. Another song in the rate that takes on a double meaning in the pandemic era as I can imagine that quite a lot of us long for affection.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Save A Kiss is the perfect song to come off of the Soul Control adrenaline rush. Grandiose and peaceful at the same time.

---

#This is where we ascend

**bbfan132** (11): :poohascend: x infinity - a perfect song

**bulforster** (11): Flawless cap on a spectacular opening run.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): GIRL WHO TOLD JESSIE WARE THAT SHE COULD GO OFF WITH THIS SONG? I LITERALLY NEVER HEARD A JESSIE WARE SONG IN MY LIFE BEFORE LISTENING TO THIS ALBUM AND THIS IS ALREADY MY 11.

**nooodisaster** (11): My favorite and is really personal to me as well.

**pros-and-connors** (11): this song told me I was going to die alone and I thanked it

**Turpamutteri** (11): I love this so much

**vayyiqra** (11): Idk why this is my 11. It's not going to win. It's just that to me it's that much-sought-after, highly prized and elusive thing, "Pop Perfection". While this doesn't really exist and is mostly an excuse to hype up some bland white girl synthpop album (not naming names of any), this song just feels like a classic. It's the best example of the synthesis between synthpop and disco sounds on this album and it just fucking bops okay. It sounds timeless, but there is no way it could be made at any time but the present. It's just That Song.

**ACORGIORGY** (10): this song is audio poppers

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Not bad for a podcast queen

**akanewasright** (10): Okay yeah this is nice. I feel like this has a certain euphoria, or vibrancy, or something that’s been missing from some of the other “disco” pastiche pop songs that have come out as of late

**Alumineous** (10): The beat is like your heartbeat when you've drank too many coffees.

**bespectacIed** (10): art

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is gay longing personified idc if she's not im claiming it as such! now my heart is racing passing all the places we've been... counting down the minutes til i give you all of meeeeee

**conceptualromance** (10): I love the melody, the synth that plays throughout, the orchestral swells - really a standout for me

**daretheghost** (10): I can copy & paste comments for most of the songs on this album but what sets this one apart for me is the urgency in the lyrics. When we get out of this club, we’re fucking.

**EnCaine** (10): 😳😳😳

**frogaranaman** (10): god I long for the day I can kiss someone again

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): The build up to SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR LOVE is so euphoric I'm so in love and full of energy. This is going to FUCK once it's performed live.

**jexan13** (10): im now an ex-homosexual

**KennyEarthman** (10): this song is so mesmerizing

**Leixander** (10): JUST SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF YOUR LOVE

**lexarqade** (10): This generation's heart-pumping anthemic bop. She truly did not have to snap so hard.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this sounds like a robyn track in the best way

**Parabox314** (10): THE SERVE. This was the track that had me hooked straight away on first listen and it remains one of my favourites from the album. "High anticipation" instantly gets me grooving, the little extra moan in "touch me like that"... everything comes together stunningly.

**plastichaxan** (10): this makes me...want to be with someone...like...i want kiss...

**proscett** (10): an immaculate emotional jam, almost on spotlight's level... the entire ending is orgasmic

**qazz23** (10): Her delivery on "no compromise" is just the best

**runaway3212** (10): This really builds beautifully

**seanderlust** (10): entrancing

**shockdbinary** (10): the best dance song of the year.

**waluigiest** (10): she really serves vocals here

**wavingwolves** (10): a song about something better than sex: anticipation

**Chevsapher** (9.8): The layered strings build such a warm, lovely soundscape. The strategic bassline dropouts are clever, and the shifts between predominantly major-chord and predominantly minor-chord sections effortlessly pull the listener through the track.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): not one of my favorites on here but it’s still excellent

**pheromenos** (9.5): one of my favorite finds

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): i'm a sucker for arpeggiators so this is great

**cherryices** (9.3): james ford appreciation comment

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): the push and pull of this song is just magnificent

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I love how hot and heavy this one is, you can really feel her desire coming through the speakers

**luckyphase** (9): DW feeling the rain with her arms raised

**SmileAndTears** (8.8): Ok hear me out. If What's your pleasure? is Future Nostalgia's older sister, then this is DEFINITELY this album's Physical. It's definitely a lot more subdued but it's just as intense and desperate in it's vocal delivery.

**Stryxen** (8.5): SAVE A LITTLE BIT OF YA LOVE

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): Another track on this album whose lyrics manage to makes me feel longing while the music makes me wanna dance!

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): This falls somewhere on the lower half of the album for me but it’s still a great track.

**engifear** (8): So sexy

**Exaltatus** (8): Love the build up in Save A Kiss.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Ctrl + S Mwah!

**ManofOranges** (8): I don't swing that way sorry!

**jasannn** (7.8): I thought I disliked this song but I found myself singing "High anticipation..." way too often. It is one of the better slower tracks on here.

**booksandplantsand** (7): wonderful simmer to this one

**cremeebrulee** (7): this is kind of boring other than the “save it save it lock it up” part tbh

**KuhBus** (7): The build up is great, but I wish it paid off more.

#Save it

**maxrocks329** (5): It's fine in the context of the album but I would never listen to it on it's own

#Spill

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): HOW IS EVERYONE IN THIS GODDAMN VIDEO SO HOT

**skargardin** (11): This had to be my eleven from the start, and I am GUTTED that it missed out on the top five. This song has such a specific theme to it with its absolutely cathartic chorus and hook "THE HEART OF THE CITY IS ON FIIIIRE!!", so true Jessie. I can perfectly picture myself listening to this during the summer nights walking through the city. This is the last time I'm going to mention the visuals perfectly capturing the essence of a song, but the video for this is absolutely stunning and leaves zero crumbs, please give it a watch if you haven't.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The Black Cat of this rate: the rate regulars' favorite that inevitably gets "robbed" of a higher placement. I'll be impressed if this becomes a top 3 Jessie song, because it genuinely deserves to.

---

#You're at the Nu-Disco Rate Day 3 Reveal! 

**brenda\_official** (11): kinda the best disco song of all time if you think about it

**frogaranaman** (11): I love being sad and gay

**geraldinewww** (11): i'm not going to explain this because it doesn't need explaining. if this isn't top 3 i'll riot

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): there are just no words for this one… this song was an absolute revelation when I first heard it. This album came out just before I moved back home after being on my own post-college and so I was just alone in this big house (because all of my roommates had left) and I was lying in bed listening to this album in the dark, kinda drifting off to sleep, and in this weird liminal space between worlds and phases of my life this song just swept in like a summer storm that swept through me and permeated every single cell of my being. I’ve been listening to it obsessively ever since, holding it close to my heart like some kind of totem that lets me drift rather than sink. She really did something special with this one. If this one wins I’ll post a recording of myself singing this a cappella in my bedroom alone at night because that’s definitely a thing that exists and I have access to

**Gonza\_90** (11): At first I didn't care much about this song, but after relistening this album, it grew to me to the point I consider it the best song of the album, and this rate.

**JackStrait** (11): Best song I discovered in 2020

**LuisEnRod** (11): this song is perfect for driving along the coastline at sunset with the top of the car off and even with how long it is, it’s a perfect song in every way and it deserves my 11

**Parabox314** (11): Absolutely the best track on the album and one of my top tracks of 2020. It has such strong "walking home through town at 4am when the clubs have shut with your best friends drunk af eating mcdonalds" energy for me. <3

**seeyanever** (11): What a way to end an album, speechless

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I just envision one day, after covid, getting back home to my city after a trip away, and ascending the steps from the subway onto the main street, and "the heart of the city is on fireeeeeee" blaring in my headphones, as the sun gleams off of the building around me. This song just has such a very specific mood associated with it to me, and it's kind of been missing in this past year, and I really want to feel it more.

**Stryxen** (11): i live in a tiny little village and i still get flashbacks to memories of watching the sunrise in a city i’ve never lived in

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (11): her voice is so heavenly on this song

**ThiefMotif** (11): This made me wanna listen to the entire album over and over just to get to this song again

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): This is the kind of song that plays during the end credits of a TV episode that ends with the character staring sadly into the distance.

**ACORGIORGY** (10): is this secretly a Janelle Monae song?

**Alumineous** (10): In Spotlight, Jessie was basically saying, "FUCK YOU, SUN!". But throughout the album, Jessie becomes comfortable with the finality of it all. RWYA starts with strings reminiscent of sun rays peering through your window in the morning. But at the end of the album, Jessie didn't raise her middle finger up to the sky. Rather, she embraced the end of this disco-filled night. She closed the album through acknowledging that the journey was all that mattered. Truly, all good things come to the end (by Nelly Furtado). Jessie's final wish is that they remember what had conspired—and that same wish extends to the listener, too.

**artzpop** (10): single-handedly changed my life

**Awkward\_King** (10): me when i have a panic attack and forget where i am

**banananaise** (10): her graham norton performance... MWAH an absolute triumph! everyone say thank you mr obama for convincing her to make this a single

**bbfan132** (10): gorgeous outro to the album, feels like i’m peacefully traveling through a city at night

**buddhacharm** (10): This is the song that ascends this album to a completely new level. It's equal parts cinematic and emotional and bookends the melodrama of this album perfectly

**bulforster** (10): The perfect cinematic yet comforting closer to a fantastic album.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this feels like the theme song of a movie from the 70s where the protagonist emerges victorious from something terrible and gets to go home to their loved one and it makes me feel very nostalgic. a perfect closer to an album that got me through 2020

**corrodedbeauty** (10): whew this album is perfection

**daretheghost** (10): My WYP hot take is that… I don’t love this song. It’s still phenomenal, and I get why others love it. I know what she’s going for, I get the references, but something keeps me from really getting into it. But coming out of 2020, coming out of a Porygon-Z, this song just hits different and finishes the album in such a dazzling way that I have to give it a 10.

**EnCaine** (10): a stunning closer for a stunning album

**jasannn** (10): This is the perfect closer. It feels like I'm walking off into the sunrise after a long journey at the end of a movie while the credits roll.

**jexan13** (10): oh my god that was so powerful

**just\_thonking** (10): When I think of the perfect closer to an album, I just think of this song. It literally feels like a sunset. It's the song they play at the end of a movie while the main characters are in the car together, driving away from their hometown to start the next chapter of their lives.

=====

skargardin: **LazyDayLullaby** (10): Such a fantastic closer! It's all good, but I particularly love the way it changes things up about half way through. Iconic ending

**Leixander** (10): the heart of the city is on WHAT? FIRE!

**lolcevan** (10): this is how you close an album!!!!!! dua take notes 📝

**luckyphase** (10): this song reminds me more than every other track of how much influence African-Americans had on disco and that Jessie Ware is white/British but it still hits!

**ManofOranges** (10): Just overall very delicious to the ear

**Misentro** (10): Perfect album closer. It's a little cheesy, but it's so earnest that it works. Really makes you feel like you're driving off into the sunset after a beautiful story.

**mudkip1** (10): what a triumph

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song is how I wanted 2020 to feel

**nooodisaster** (10): An absolutely beautiful closer that couldn't stop growing on me. There's such purpose and power to this, like Jessie herself is pulling the sunrise up over the city just for you. The chorus acknowledges darkness and evil, but reminds us to live in the moment, love fiercely, and consider whatever life gives with open arms.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I'm ascending

**proscett** (10): the perfect closing track to my fav album of 2020 :) it's hopeful, it's comforting, it's moving, and you can shake your ass to it. whats not to like?

**qazz23** (10): Perfect way to close the album, love when the backing vocals come in

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is how you close an album ladies!

**runaway3212** (10): what an amazing closer

**shockdbinary** (10): city's bop

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): An all-time great album closer

**TragicKingdom1** (10): immaculate vibes, the runner-up for my 11

**vagenda** (10): How does this feel so different, sonically and lyrically, from the rest of the album but still feel like the only possible closing statement? Honestly, her mind

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): This is sooo atmospheric and beautiful! It completely captures the feeling of going home after an adventurous night of clubbing while the sun has just started rising. Love this as a closer!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): this is gorgeous and a great closer

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): a FANTASTIC closer for this album, encapsulates all the sounds and themes of the album in this grand closing statement, I love it

**Chevsapher** (9.5): A fabulous closer.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): This feels like the end of a journey. Very cinematic

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9.5): Best disco closer I've ever heard.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Jessie said “leave amnesia behind”

**bigbigbee** (9): The music video for this song is gorgeous and I’m absolutely rating this as high as I am because I’ve seen it. I miss taking morning summer walks pre-COVID with music like this playing in my mind.

**booksandplantsand** (9): the heart of the city is on fireeeeee!

**cremeebrulee** (9): amazing closer “the heart of the city is on FIREEEE” is so contagious

**engifear** (9): So sexy

**Exaltatus** (9): Lovely end to a lovely album.

**jongin\_is\_shy** (9): I like the single edit... more

**KennyEarthman** (9): that choir chorus is so nostalgic

**vayyiqra** (9): I'm in bed doing this rate at past midnight on a Sunday (now technically Monday in fact) because I put off doing this rate to listen to eight billion other ones because I forgot to do album club despite having three or four months to do it, because I have ADHD and something pandemic and I've lost control of my life.

**waluigiest** (9): it’s a beautiful closer

**wavingwolves** (9): GORGEOUS!!!!!!

**akanewasright** (8.5): This feels very... classic for some reason. Not to talk about Obama, but it makes perfect sense to me why he highlighted this song over the other in the album.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): This is just one of those songs that couldn't be anything but the last track on an album, a really good closer for a really good album.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): this is such a nice change of pace to bring the album to a close, it feels more reminiscent of a lot of Jessie’s earlier, more adult-contemporary stuff, but it really helps make this feel like the end of a musical journey

**1998tweety** (8): cute closer

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): What an amazing closer to this wonderful album!

**shesdoingyoga** (8): A good closer but I find it somewhat overhyped

**maxrocks329** (7): A good closing song, but not something I would listen to on its own

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this is cute

**MrSwearword** (6): this is not a closer but at least it tried to be lush in its existence despite having the least capable vocalist for this album, sorry WAREhouses, she is simply NOT that gurl.

#The Kill the better closer squad

**seanderlust** (7): I get why this was chosen as a closer - it feels like a sunrise after an all-night party. however, I kind of wish this album closed with the kill since that track feels much stronger IMO

**bespectacIed** (6): boooo ballad-ish closer to a dance album

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): It’s kind of disappointing right after a song like The Kill, but it isn’t offensive.

**Vromega** (6): I wished the album finished a song earlier

#Excuse me?

**conceptualromance** (1): remember where you are, you’re listening to the worst song on the album </3

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Unlike Incapable, Jealousy doesn't suffer from being thrice shorter than the original mix, though I still wish it preserved the old outro.

**skargardin** (10): JEALOUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY....ahhhhhhhhhhhh!! If you neede a wake up call by the time the album comes to an end, this was definitely one hell of an intro. I'm so stoked that this made the top five because it absolutely deserves to the way it slaps. Sadly this was never a true winner contender but it came very close on one occasion early on in the rate. 

---

#JEALOUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): I was hooked the moment she belted out the song title at the beginning. Just like with “Something More”, she does a great job conveying what she's feeling through the production and sound of the song. It’s chaotic, hectic, loud, fast-paced and with every repetition of her singing “Jealousy” she’s becoming slightly more and more unhinged. I love the lyrical progression where she eventually gives in to jealousy in the end. Overall great track in every aspect.

**banananaise** (11): honestly such a fucking TRIUMPH!!! like after 50 minutes of gold miss murphy pulls a last minute banger out of her purse and it's such a MOMENT to go wild right at the end of the album

**booksandplantsand** (11): when she screams J E A L O U S Y i instantly pass out. fucking soty

**iniekcja\_** (11): left no crumbs

**KennyEarthman** (11): JEALOOOUUSSSSSSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH!!!!!!!

**LazyDayLullaby** (11): When the strings go wild, and Murphy soars from the soul-stirring verses to the show-stealing choruses, I feel alive. It’s an utterly flawless finale, and as much as I enjoy the journey of the album as a whole, it really is, for me, the absolute pinnacle

**Leixander** (11): inhales JEALOUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYEAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

**rayofgreenlight** (11): I love how it ends the album with a bang, it's instantly catchy on first listen, the beginning is brilliant (JEALOUSYYYYYYY!), the bridge is heavenly and I love how the bridge builds and builds

**sirpancakeXI** (11): Total banger, amazing from start to finish.

**TheCatWithoutAName** (11): The feeling every other artist ever gets when they hear this PERFECTION.

**thedoctordances1940** (11): God-tier bassline

**1998tweety** (10): where was this the whole album???? wtf this is a bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an eleven contender.

**akanewasright** (10): GOD, what an entrance.

**Awkward\_King** (10): me when im jealous

**bbfan132** (10): a total fucking bop, excellent outro

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): [nicki minaj "did i lie?" but edited with the intro to this song]

**daretheghost** (10): God, what a closer. An easy 11, but alas.

**engifear** (10): Titty gif

**Exaltatus** (10): This shit just slaps.

**Flegasaurus** (10): jello sea

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Okay but the 11 minute extended version is 11 minutes for a reason 😉

**Gonza\_90** (10): I love every single bit of this

**hikkaru** (10): JEALOUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHH

**KuhBus** (10): This one came right for my THROAT.

**LuisEnRod** (10): she sure began and ended this album with the two best songs. I think that’s genius on her part tbh

**maxrocks329** (10): It was really hard not to give this my 11, but Something More just barely beat it.

**MrSwearword** (10): what a motherfucking banging track to close on, werk diva.

**mudkip1** (10): now honey you did not need to shout like that

**musical\_pyn** (10): JEALOUSYYYYYYYYEEYEYEYEYEYEYUHHHH

**Parabox314** (10): JEALOUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAHHHHHHHH.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Such a banger

**proscett** (10): this and murphy's law are probably the top 2 songs in this rate

**qazz23** (10): Closing the album with a banger

**ReallyCreative** (10): what a fucking EVENT of a closer. Not just anyone could pull this kind of song off, but this is just cathartic. Easily a career highlight.

**runaway3212** (10): The last four tracks of this album are so good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Total banger from the moment she yells JEALOUSYYY! A mirror to Incapable where she re-evaluates everything she thought she knew about the way she experiences attachment and emotions.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): let me on a crowded, sweaty dancefloor, PLEASE

**shesdoingyoga** (10): She really said “Oh you want a finale? I’ll give you a finale”

**shockdbinary** (10): MY GOD I WASN'T WAITING FOR THIS. ok roisin, you got me. jealousy is that girl. NARCISSUS AND JEALOUSY SUPREMACY.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I'm pretty sure everyone involved with this song was on cocaine and rushing a few bpm too fast but they all still synced up and it really really worked

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): This track would have fit right in during the 70's, its incredible

**Turpamutteri** (10): Perfection

**Vromega** (10): this succession of chords is not original but absolutely perfect. The bass is a vibe. The instrumentation is brilliant. What a way to finish an album ! I wish I could give two 11s tbh

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): The "JEALOUSYYYY" scream at the beginning always reminds me of the beginning of Waka Waka (This time for Africa) lmao. Love this song and the bright energy it exudes!

**geraldinewww** (9.9): that bass. excellence

**wavingwolves** (9.7): jealousy never felt so good

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Now this is how you end an album!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): bop but I can’t stand the beginning of the song so I would have to dock a half point

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): that beginning “JEALOUSYYYYY” is literally laced with crack i swear

**pheromenos** (9.5): if a róisín song is gonna win i hope it's this one

**Chevsapher** (9.2): JEALOUSYYYYYYY! The production is fast and overwhelming, but I suspect that's the point. The songwriting is just as good as on the rest of the album; I just wish it didn't end with an abrupt fadeout.

**jasannn** (9.2): I love how she saved the highest tempo song for the closer. It's such a satisfying finale.

**bigbigbee** (9): This track feels the most “classic disco” to my (extremely uneducated) ear, and I really like it. Makes me want to get on my feet.

**Misentro** (9): JELLA SEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYUH

**SmileAndTears** (9): bopity bop

**Stryxen** (9): i wonder if she’s the jealous type :thinking:

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): Roisin really put the most energetic track on this album as the closer??

**EnCaine** (8.5): JEALOUSYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYAAAAaa

**cherryices** (8.4): what’s the best song titled jealousy? i’m think i’m giving it to will young

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I'm glad this album ends on a high note. I love this upbeat sound SO much more than the slower tracks.

**lolcevan** (8): the intro made me JUMPPPP but this sounds like it was ripped straight out of mario kart

**nooodisaster** (8): The first time I was listening to this album I only had this song left. It was really late at night and I pressed play, forgetting I had left my phone's speaker all the way up. My roommate BROKE A PLATE.

**waluigiest** (8): a fun closer for sure. Really an encore kind of song.

**bulforster** (7.8): Kind of a mess, but a banging one.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.8): This song didn't feel like a closer which is quite jarring because I thought I was going to listen to another song to wrap the album. Regardless, this song is pretty good!

**conceptualromance** (7.5): it's a shame that the album ends on my least favorite track. but i love the intro to this song so much

**JackStrait** (7.5): Easily the best song on the album

**targetguest** (7.5): this seems the most classic "disco" of any of the songs on this rate, to my very uneducated ears

**frogaranaman** (7): I’m jealous, I’m overzealous

**ManofOranges** (7): I think it's fun I like the beat.

**vayyiqra** (7): Róisín is not the jealous kind yet has a song on Overpowered about how she wants everybody to know she is your lady ... interesting ! Glad this rate is over it was fun !

For those who were looking for some actual lyricism and storytelling, she finally served it with this one. I bet that a lot of you thought this was going to be Róisín's highest rated song, well, think again! I love this song so much and it is also one of the songs on the album that exists in many different mixes. I think I prefer the album mix the most honestly but it's hard to pick a favourite one. Very happy that it managed to get into the top four even if it didn't go all the way.

#Our love is stuck.. on replay

**bespectacIed** (11): Disco is a life-affirming, joyous genre so naturally a song about letting everything fall apart and go wrong is the one I gravitated to the most in the rate. Also this song's a fucking masterpiece. Also this song has the EXACT same subject matter as Kelela's Take Me Apart which I gave an 11 on the neo-rnb rate

**conceptualromance** (11): genius

**Dual Eeper** (11): Murphy's Law - 11 (The first time I heard this song I was not impressed with it. The second time I heard this song was on Graham Norton, and I spent about 2 hours after that just watching Roisin's performance over and over again. There's something about the refrain "It's Murphy's law, I'm gonna meet you tonight" that has this hypnotic rhythm and sass to it. Roisin's spoken word intro and, most importantly, the whimsical and self-referential master stroke of naming the song 'Murphy's Law' sends me into orbit every time I'm listening to it.

**proscett** (11): the self-referential title and subject matter? the synths? the strings? the songwriting? this song is a masterpiece and is the only reasonable choice for your 11.

**ReallyCreative** (11): I don't know a better song, it's a pun on her name, it's relatable content, it's a bop, it's relevant to quarantine, it's perfection!

**runaway3212** (11): It's weird that this title references everything is going wrong, when this song does absolutely right

**shivof** (11): Nu-Disco peaked right here and even that might be an understatement because this song is THAT legendary. Róisín Murphy is a fucking genius and it's high time popheads give her the respect and recognition she deserves.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): captures a lot of emotions while also being a massive slutbop!!

**waluigiest** (11): Immaculate. I can’t get over how perfectly put together this song is. The way it grows over two minutes into the first chorus: the sexy intro/segue from We Got Together -> the bare funky instrumental -> a chill, melancholy verse -> a prechorus that leads into -> the explosive, punny, jammable chorus. It’s both fresh and nostalgic and out checks every box.

**1998tweety** (10): now HERE is the serve

**AHSWeeknd** (10): here are the lyrics.

**Awkward\_King** (10): f*** the law, even murphy's

**bbfan132** (10): i love how she named this after herself lmao, this is excellent

**booksandplantsand** (10): I like to chant the spoken word part like im in a church service

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): literally invented laws and being murphy

**cremeebrulee** (10): amazing song but its no narcissus

**daretheghost** (10): It hurts me to not give this an 11 and I hope the Murphy’s Law campaigners will forgive me.

**EnCaine** (10): wowwwww this one sounds even better than i remembered

**engifear** (10): I love the lyrics to this one. I don't tend to listen to the lyrics very closely on other songs, but they're good on this song.

**Exaltatus** (10): Manifesting a post-covid 2021 where I can get my back blown out to Murphy's Law.

**frogaranaman** (10): get money, fuck the system, break the law

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): 11 contender!

**Gonza\_90** (10): What can I say? It's just a vibe

**hikkaru** (10): queen of feeling her story is still untold and writing her own happy ending

**just\_thonking** (10): I'm not giving it my 11 but I would be very happy to see it win. The danciest song in the rate

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Oooooh yeah, it's just so, so good. If it wasn't for Jealousy, easy 11. Róisín Murphy made a Disco bop for the ages with this one!

**Leixander** (10): The 8-minute version is perfect, this one is pretty great too.

**ManofOranges** (10): Actually a thrilling song.

**maxrocks329** (10): "I'll make my own happy ending" is the energy I need in my life

**Misentro** (10): I don't know how to explain it but this song has big dick energy.

**MrSwearword** (10): the extended mix at eight minutes is where it's at, but still leave it to this queen to actually get what disco encapsulates. Best track on the album.

**musical\_pyn** (10): definitely the album’s standout even if it’s not my personal favorite, just incredible

**Parabox314** (10): She killed it. Mopped the floor with these hoes.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I can see this winning the rate

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): Ok this is just amazing

**qazz23** (10): One of the best

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The play on Róisín’s last name is so clever, and she taps into an universal feeling, though this is a track only she could make. It nails the bittersweet, vulnerable resignation that moving on isn’t linear, and a single turn of events may put you at square one emotionally, despite your best efforts.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Absolute bop, would be getting my 11 if I wasn’t a Warehouse

**Stryxen** (10): murphys like a melody in my head that i cant keep out got me singing like nananana everyday its like my ipods stuck on replay

**targetguest** (10): i get the hype

**TheCatWithoutAName** (10): Literal perfection. I mean what else

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I regret that I have but one 11 to give in this rate

**Chevsapher** (9.9): This is AAA-grade disco music. Thoughtful lyrics, throbbing production, melodies for days—it's all here, folks. It's a shame we're not rating the Cosmodelica remix, which is just as good as the original.

**\_SoulGlitch** (9.5): You wouldn’t think a song with this title would sound this hopeful and uplifting.

**jasannn** (9.5): I'm so glad she saved this clever song title for one of her best songs.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Probably the most pop-friendly song here and probably the best too lol

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Wait so does that mean that Ed Sh**ran will actually release a good song one day?

**artzpop** (9): amaz

**KuhBus** (9): HOT!

**mudkip1** (9): i used to hate this song but i've since seen the light

**vayyiqra** (9): Most things go right in this song in fact

**wavingwolves** (9): massive banger

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Very lush and pretty feel-good as well :)

**seeyanever** (8.3): The most "accessible" of her songs so far. Great beat, catchy chorus

**oscarbrierley1** (8.2): it's good but I don't really understand why it seems to be most peoples favourite on the album

**Brendon-Urine** (8): there's at least one banger on this album so I can't say I hate all of it. THIS gets my ass movin. I was so shook to see it's 6:21, it feels so much shorter.

**cherryices** (8): have to say i’m not really vibing with ms murphy’s voice. most of my scores are for the instrumentals

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I love the lyrics here!

**KennyEarthman** (8): made me search up Murphy's Law

**nooodisaster** (8): oh no this one grew on me... Róisín is just such a great lyricist with clear, poignant ideas for every song. And of course the groove her is funky so this'll be a popheads fav.

**pheromenos** (8): well...i tried

#The story is in fact told </3

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This is alright, but it's too long with too little variation for me

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): I know this is a favorite among the fans but I just find it very middle of the road and kind of more boring than other tracks on here.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): the transition from We Got Together into this is SO good, but the rest of this was kinda just ok to me

**luckyphase** (5): ok at first but I keep zoning out

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): this is fr the worst song on the album to me...sorry y’all </3 (the song title is a serve tho)

#Well, Niki

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): We shall see whether our setup for Kylie to win actually worked.

**skargardin** (10): WE LITERALLY INCLUDED THIS IN THE BONUS RATE SO IT COULD WIN AND THEN IT DIDNT! I HAVE TO LAUGH!! It was a major serve it really was. I really enjoy the production here, especially towards the last half of the song. What a smash. I had honestly hoped that this would win the bonus rate but alas. SAD!!

---

#We've got something better, GOT THAT REAL GROOVE BAYBEEE

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an actual remix instead of one that just adds an artist.

**bespectacIed** (10): YEAH THIS IS IT, CHIEF. Obvious bonus rate winner not just cuz of dula, this is truly a remix that elevated the original.

**jasannn** (10): It would've fit perfectly within Club Future Nostalgia (which is a good thing) but I wish there was more Dua Lipa tho.

**Parabox314** (10): This is better than half of future nostalgia.

**plastichaxan** (10): this was so incredible, i’ve seen studio 2054 a few times, with friends especially and this is just a vibe

**slimboyfriend** (10): This is the deep prodution missing from DISCO. Not only is this song better than the original, it's also better than every song in this entire rate.

**Chevsapher** (9.7): I love, love, LOVE this mix. The vocal mixing us odd, but holy shit, that bridge. The strings in the second verse are genius; I wish they were in the original mix. And can we talk about the remix of the remix? So good.

**jongin\_is\_shy** (9): Perfect combination of Kylie and Dua

**lolcevan** (9): dua’s involvement here is close to non-existent but i ate this song tf up anyway

**wavingwolves** (9): dUaS GoT tHaT ReAl GroOvE!!!!!

**engifear** (8.5): Hmm Disco and Future Nostalgia really are similar aren't they. Now I wonder if I underrated DISCO or if I overrated FN (probably the latter).

**booksandplantsand** (8): queens of dance serving as always

**Exaltatus** (8): Would love to hear some collabs between Kylie and Dua in the future.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): I love Disco tropes and this has a bunch of Disco tropes so I guess I love it?

**Stryxen** (8): the way this made me like the original less

**bbfan132** (7.5): it’s good but dua is barely here

**KennyEarthman** (7): it's fine but I would've loved a Dua verse

**maxrocks329** (7): It's definitely more in line with the vibe of Future Nostalgia, and I don't think that really works for it.

**daretheghost** (6): I kept waiting for Dua Lipa to have more of a presence on this. It’s cute and not too different from the album version but is a real missed opportunity

#The inital talk comments, and yes Leix, very much so


**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): This version is an improvement from the original, but once again, Initial Talk Remix > all other music

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.5): she's a cute girl but cute next to gorgeous (initial talk remix) gorgeous is gonna, you know, devour cute.

**Leixander** (7): the hosts must be seething that the superior version of this (initial talk remix) got released right after they started accepting ballots

**1998tweety** (7): the Initial Talk remix greatly outsold

**musical\_pyn** (7): initial talk remix is SO much better

**akanewasright** (3): the initial talk remix of this song shows us exactly how good this could have been, but then chose not to be. There are a few redeeming qualities to this, but in general... it’s just wasted potential

#PUT THIS ON THE DELUXE CHALLENGE, MISS JESSIE


**buddhacharm** (10): Naur because I'm still a little upset that it wasn't on the main tracklist...yeah ig it would be slightly out of place but she made room for Abore You sooo....

**daretheghost** (10): Justice for Overtime.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): JUSTICE FOR OVERTIME!!!!

**vagenda** (10): The only real criticism I can make of What's Your Pleasure? is that this song isn't on it

**Chevsapher** (9.9): It's shocking to me that this wasn't on the album. I was legitimately obsessed with it when it dropped. In fact, when the actual album came out, I was upset it didn't sound quite like “Overtime.” Thankfully, I've come to adore the album for what it is.

**oscarbrierley1** (9.2): this shouldve been on the album

**lolcevan** (9): paid dust 😡😡

**maxrocks329** (9): Wow this is great, I wish some of this production had made it onto What's Your Pleasure

**musical\_pyn** (9): oh my god this is up there with the best tracks on wyp?

**jasannn** (8.5): This would've fit perfectly on WYP.

**jongin\_is\_shy** (8): Did she really had to include Read My Lips and not this?

**KennyEarthman** (8): feels like an extension of What's Your Pleasure?


#We go into overtime!!!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): What a damn beat. That producer deserves a raise.

**bbfan132** (10): i forgot how good this was UGH, would be an 11 contender if it was in the main rate

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was a sign that something incredible was coming. if it doesnt win the bonus rate im suing

**sarcasticsobs** (10): exa-cuse me with this bass???

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): amazing, but not the What's Your Pleasure? Georgia Remix (ok but this song is actually QUITE the serve)

**engifear** (9): So sexy

**wavingwolves** (9): bop

**Leixander** (8.5): I don't like her voice in the chorus but the rest of the song is awesome.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Excuse me, how have I never heard this banger before?

**ACORGIORGY** (8): oh, she can do ‘90s revivalism too?

**banananaise** (8): i can't believe this smooth jam is written by the same person who wrote Touch by Little Mix

**booksandplantsand** (8): ooh dark and sexy

**Exaltatus** (8): I really need to get into the rest of Jessie's discography, don't I?

**seanderlust** (8): "I could drink you up like summer lemonade" oh werk girl

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): bassline is pure fire. deep down, I'm really just a bass slut.

**Stryxen** (7.5): this is so fu

#I fear a relisten is in order!

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Time and a half is better

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): ABSURD INTRO (x100). But seriously, I think I'm speaking for everyone when I say that most of us who loved Narcissus as a single were SHOCKED to hear the magnificently harrowing string section in the first 50 seconds of its album edit. An indisputable standout moment in the rate.

**skargardin** (10): I'm so sorry Narcissus stans but this is unfortunately where it ends. During the very early parts of the rate Narcissus was actually winning the whole rate, we should've stopped the count right there honestly. And we were devasted to see it retreat and never be able to truly contend as a winner again as the rate went on, but it did put up a REALLY good fight!! I would neve have thought that Róisín would take up 3/5 spots of the top five and she managed to do it! Honestly iconic given how much this sub loves Jessie. See you all in All Stars, give your 11s to Narcissus!!

---

#**PILAF PILAF PILAF...**

**ACORGIORGY** (11): Ovid whom? Absolutely arresting.

**akanewasright** (11): will probably get robbed somewhere along the way, but make no mistake: this is an actual masterpiece of a track. The strings in the bridge alone make this a 10, but everything else on top of it meant that there really wasn’t another 11 in the rate for me.

**bigbigbee** (11): OH MAN. I love this so much. I think that this is the most unique (?) track of any of the main rate songs. That string riff is spellbinding. Also the harmonies on the bridge feel like they’re encroaching on you in the best way possible.

**cremeebrulee** (11): i know this is like a hopeless campaign considering that it’s up against a sub fave and album everyone universally agrees as flawless, not to mention half of roisin’s 11s are (deservedly) going to murphy’s law BUT this is by a large margin my favorite song from this rate. the first time i heard this was when someone played in a plug reveal (rip) and i was immediately obsessed. it’s energetic, it’s addictive, and it deserves a better placement than what it’s gonna get!

**devilonmytongue0** (11): it was soooooo hard to choose my 11 but narcissus is defos the most played one sooo

**engifear** (11): If you don't dance to this song and whisper Narcissus along with it, I don't want to talk to you

**Flegasaurus** (11): obvious rate winner.... like holy shit

**kirby31200** (11): If I saw this song in my reflection, I'd stare at it all day

**ManofOranges** (11): Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love Be in love with me

**Onewal1** (11): The original single mix was already a 10 and then the album track intro took it BEYOND. The best intro to a song ever in my opinion.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): This is on par with Róisín's greatest bangers like Overpowered, the strings slap and the bridge is gorgeous. She strikes balance between empathy for the Narcissus character in her life, optimism for being able to change them, and knowing it's futile. I feel that calling someone a narcissist has become a cliché sometimes, but leaning into the Greek myth references gives the lyrics a pleasing timelessness.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): the strings my GOD, thank u eddie stevens

**undine\_** (11): Nothing makes me resent quarantine like this song, because I need a dancefloor

**Vromega** (11): I hesitated a long time to give this song my 11. But after listening a few times to the 3 albums, this song slowly became my definitive choice. This song itself is a journey. A 5 minute adventure, without any loss of rythm. By far the song from this rate that made moved me the most, in a rate where I had overall some difficulties to apprehend the universe painted by the artists.

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): The strings in this are so good. The intro, the outro and everything in between are a fucking serve.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don’t know what that word means and I don’t wanna find out

**booksandplantsand** (10): omg I wanted to give this an eleven too but i can't :(

**bulforster** (10): Greek mythology has never slapped so hard.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the frantic strings are everything, the bass is everything, her vocals are everything, she IS the moment

**daretheghost** (10): be in love be in love be in love be in love be in love be in love with me. An 11 in my heart.

**Exaltatus** (10): Narcissus, I'm sorry, but I have only one 11 to give.

**geraldinewww** (10): to everyone who gave this their 11, i salute you

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): 11 contender!

**KennyEarthman** (10): that short instrumental break goes off

**KuhBus** (10): Charming, smart, beautiful.

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Easy 10, unbelievably good. The fact that the next song is even better?! Saving tracks with this much energy for the end worked so well, Róisín really knows what she's doing

**Leixander** (10): is this... for me? 🥺👉👈

**lolcevan** (10): incredible

**maxrocks329** (10): I've literally spent hours staring at myself in the mirror listening to this song

**Misentro** (10): That bass hits my prostate like I'm in a LoveSense ad

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the song that got me into roisin yass grenade

**MrSwearword** (10): further proof that Roisin is still the only pop gurl to actually know what disco is.

**mudkip1** (10): oh mawma she came to SLAY

**musical\_pyn** (10): ovid main pop girl

**nooodisaster** (10): the best song about donald trump ever written

**nootnoot781** (10): god this track is so FUCKING GOOD. the production is fucking flawless, it’s so much fun. when i say i need to be in a gay club at 1:30 am dancing to this, ugh covid can you go away please?

**plastichaxan** (10): she's a game changer cause she changes the game...she has the mind of a mastermind

**qazz23** (10): Really great strings and bass!

**ReallyCreative** (10): pure campy fun, with some GORGEOUS harmonization on the bridge, yet another perfect song on this album

**runaway3212** (10): obviously

**seanderlust** (10): a dance-heavy track about a Greek fable? YES please.

**shockdbinary** (10): as I like dance songs a lot, narcissus is definitely my favorite, except that her vocals are perfect and shows versatility.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the instrumental is just immaculate

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This track makes me want gay bars to open back up so I can kiss cute twinks again

**TheCatWithoutAName** (10): House-electro-techno-disco-dance-pop perfection. Did I get all of them?

**waluigiest** (10): dramatic string intro. uptempo driving jam. the mythology of it all. I’m sold.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a 11 but it's not my 11

**Chevsapher** (9.7): Classical references in dance music are always fun, and the song just keeps getting better as it progresses.

**bbfan132** (9.5): very catchy! i wish i could say more but that’s all i can think of lmao

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): definitely one of the highlights of the album

**seeyanever** (9.5): Give me more violin! More!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): I love the urgency of this track

**Turpamutteri** (9.5): A religious experience

**vagenda** (9.1): whispers narthithith

**artzpop** (9): so good

**celladonn** (9): Great cover of Ovid's timeless bop

**cherryices** (9): that last minute with the strings is wonderful

**conceptualromance** (9): love a Greek mythology disco moment

**corrodedbeauty** (9): the second half of this song… yes

**jasannn** (9): The production here is phenomenal.

**LuisEnRod** (9): Narcissa Malfoy wishes she was as delightful as this song is

**Parabox314** (9): Self loving queen.

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): Those violins >>>

**vayyiqra** (9): The cover of The Golden Echo by Kimbra is a reference to the Greek myth of Echo and Narcissus, who stared at his reflection too long and turned into a flower for some reason, which is now named after him, as is a mental illness called narcissistic personality disorder. (Echo turned into a sound which is why an echo is called an echo.) This comment does not have much to do with this song because I'm out of ideas and want to go to bed ! No thoughts head empty

=====

skargardin: **WillamThunderfuck** (9): This is really good, those violins are especially great

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): I really thought she was singing "lesbian, lesbian, lesbian love with me" with a lisp at the start 💀

**just\_thonking** (8.5): The plucked strings are so fun

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Oh this is definitely the best song in this rate!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The myth of Echo and Narcissus has always been my favorite Greek myth, the Narcissus part of the story (a man so in love with his reflection that he stared at it until he died) has obviously become the larger cultural talking point but I feel like most people overlook the role of Echo, the nymph who loved him from afar until she too faded. What exactly are we supposed to take away from this other half of the story? Are we supposed to feel bad for Echo, pining away for a love she could never have until she died, or are we supposed to think she’s stupid for allowing the man she loved to rot away by a pond? None of this has anything to do with the song but it’s something I’ve been thinking about since I was a kid and I’ll probably never have another excuse to bring it up. The song is good.

**proscett** (8): i have nothing to say about this track except it's good

**Stryxen** (8): when i first listened to this i was staring at myself in the mirror

**frogaranaman** (7): 345’s where we stayed, she told me I’m a narcissist doing it again

#so true

**Awkward\_King** (11): who is narcissus he sounds hot

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Mine is spoiling the first few rate ballots on the rate server and then immediately regretting it. Jokes aside, this song is stunning all the way through. Also, the dance video outsold the mv.

**skargardin** (10): The final showdown of the rate would inevitably come down to the clash between this sexy banger and the sultry Spotlight. Honestly, even as the last ballot rolled in, it was still any one of the song's game. I think at most the differences were 2 points between Spotlight and WYP?, which made every single ballot count as to determine the winner. I honestly can not tell which one I still prefer as a winner over the other but this is the final results so here we are! I do really really love this song a lot and think it was obvious that it would stand as a winner contender.

---

#Why this is my pleasure

**BaconShoes** (11): Absolutely showstopping amazing groovy tune that always makes me wanna dance

**buddhacharm** (11): Genuinely an irresistible and heady nu-disco masterpiece tbh. It's just so unyielding and so endlessly replayable in a way that still ushers in new sensations with each listen. Not to mention that dance video...like please 👀

**cherryices** (11): what’s your pleasuuAH? those vocals make my back arch thank you jessie

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): this is like the horniest non-explicit song of all time and i'm MAD i havent been railed to this yet

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this song is SO smooth and catchy it’s literal crack. this was easily one of my favorite songs of 2020

**getin2it** (11): , Love the harkening back to "I Feel Love" and it's so incredibly dark, yet sexy

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): PUSH PRESS MORE LESS HERE TOGETHER WHAT'S YOUR PLEASURE STOP GO FAST SLOW https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D2yxXAUX0AAt0rC.jpg

**lexarqade** (11): Truly my favourite song of last year. What is there even to say?

**pat-rickstar** (11): Horny excellence, this is the classy version of horny music

**rotating3Dtext** (11): all the album is sooo good, but I have to give the 11 to the namesake and most iconic song

**SFbby** (11): Is this disco? Idk. Is this funky? YES. Is this sexy? YES. Is it a bop? ABSOLUTELY

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): I danced to this song in my room so much during quarantine last year, it has to be my 11

**wholahaybrown** (11): I have been sexily strutting around my apartment to this song for eight months and it's simply perfect

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): I can only dream about being as confident as Nicolas Hichard is in music video for this.

**ACORGIORGY** (10): this would be my 11 if Narcissus didn’t exist, easily the sexiest song of 2020

**AGM301** (10): the vocals aaaa

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Talk about an amazing title track, perfectly captures the album.

**Alumineous** (10): Confidence is sexy, and Jessie knows it. The songstress boldly follows the intro track with with her most seductive, erotic song on the record--and arguably her entire career. A midtempo song whose vocal delivery is just as sensual as its upfront lyrics. with Jessie whispering better than Selena Gomez's entire catalogue. Plus, a synth-heavy backing track that sounds like the auditory equivalent of strobe lights.

**bbfan132** (10): didn’t click with me at first but it’s grown on me immensely - love how sensual/spacey it is

**bespectacIed** (10): Perfection

**booksandplantsand** (10): this song fucks

**conceptualromance** (10): yes

**corrodedbeauty** (10): this is so sensual, her voice is liquid gold on this track

**daretheghost** (10): The first time I heard this song… whew. I’ve said about everything I can say about this song in every thread wherein /r/popheads throws around “disco” or about this album so I’ll refrain here. But this song gets me as excited now as it did on first listen. An 11 if I could.

**EnCaine** (10): why can't i have two elevens 😭

**Exaltatus** (10): Sultry, intimate, perfect.

**Flegasaurus** (10): my pleasure is eating cinnamon swirl bread omg this is so good

**frogaranaman** (10): the answer to this question is gay bears

**geraldinewww** (10): sexy

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love her voice here and just the overall sensuality of the song.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): this would be a boring winner but i can’t claim it would be an incorrect winner

**jexan13** (10): this song feels like laminar flow of liquid, flowing so beautifully

**just\_thonking** (10): Incomparably fun and sexy

**KennyEarthman** (10): this song is so hot

**LuisEnRod** (10): yes

**maxrocks329** (10): This bassline has been playing in my head 24/7 since I first heard it

**Misentro** (10): The way she sings the chorus is so hot. This would probably be my 11 if it weren't for Spotlight.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this chorus is sooo good

**mudkip1** (10): WHO GAVE HER THE RIGHT??? THE SHEER NERVE

**musical\_pyn** (10): this chorus (and, well, the rest of the song) is incredible

**Parabox314** (10): Jessie really released one of the best horny bops of all time in the middle of a panorama. Trust, you will be dealt with.

**plastichaxan** (10): oh to be as perfect as the person in the dance video for such a perfect song

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): it's unrelentingly sexy and smooth.

**qazz23** (10): Her vocal delivery is the best

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is HORNY and I'm here for it

**runaway3212** (10): literally the definition of a bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): :flushed:

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Bonk

**shockdbinary** (10): that beat and vocalization are my pleasure.

**vagenda** (10): Imagine starting your album with the 1-2 punch of Spotlight and then THIS. Nobel Peace Prize

**vayyiqra** (10): This would be the most boring winner but a deserving one. White woman make bleepbloops over vaguely disco beat; Popheads like.

**waluigiest** (10): chromatica ii can fade into this song

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): Love this cheeky, sexy song!

**bulforster** (9.8): love, sex, american express

**Chevsapher** (9.6): PUSH! PRESS! MORE! LESS! Jessie's light, soaring vocals contrast so well with the dark, pulsating production.

**1998tweety** (9.5): big bop

**akanewasright** (9.5): I once queued this song in discord while on call with a few people, and the song made a straight friend of mine (who already loved the album) so horny he had to leave the call shortly after. I honestly thought only the gays listened to this album, but I guess that’s because it’s too powerful for straight people.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this song is about sex

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): i overplayed the fuck out of this last year so i took off half a point, but it’s still a bop

**lolcevan** (9.5): i thought this album title was so clunky until i heard this song for the first time and my brain melted out of my ears

**seanderlust** (9.5): this song just exudes confidence.

**Stryxen** (9.5): idk jessie ask someone else i just got here

**Brendon-Urine** (9): and my ass just starts shaking uncontrollably, someone please help it's ruining my life

**ManofOranges** (9): Kind of a loaded question

**nooodisaster** (9): An absolute highlight in an album of highlights. This bangs from moment one and doesn't stop for a moment. I can't get over how goddamn classy a song about dry humping on the dance floor is, but I'll take it if it sounds this good.

**pros-and-connors** (9): this not being the lip sync song when Jessie guest judge drag race was a CHOICE

**proscett** (9): not being able to dance to this in the club rn is homophobia

**TiltControls** (9): the best way to describe this is ethereal

**SmileAndTears** (8.6): very funky

**engifear** (8.5): So sexy

**jasannn** (8.5): I constantly switch from thinking the song is meh to singing and dancing to the chorus. While it's far from my favorite song on the album, it has grown on me a lot and I can see why people love it.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.5): This song's a star

**wavingwolves** (8.2): this song called me a virgin and i said thanks

**sirpancakeXI** (8): the hook is a little bit meh but overall a good song.

#The few neutral takes sob

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): There’s some cool moments on this one but on the whole it’s missing that special spice

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): Is it a bad time to say that I don’t really like this song that much?

**Vromega** (7): nice but lacks some energy

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Manifesting Little Minoguesters and Ferrero Róisíns coming through and not making the winner of this rate glaringly obvious.

**skargardin** (10): This is the most anticlimatic conclusion to this whole thing let's be very honest, but congratulations to Jessie for winning the 2020-Nu-Disco rate with Spotlight!!! Spotlight had a really intersting run in the top five but as the rate went on and more 11s and 10s started to roll in, it started to cement its position as the ultimate winner and here we are! I definitely think this is a worthy winner. Imagine opening your album with this song like the sheer power that has! This is so gorgeous, cinematic, Jessie's voice sounds absolutely heavenly. There really aren't enough superlatives to express my love for this song. Given the amount of acclaim this album has received both by critics and fan reception on this sub, I think this is the most deserving winner.

---

#I just wanna staaaay.. in the moonlight, this is our time, in the spotlight..

**Alumineous** (11): I'm going to admit that I was a Spotlight skipper. But I grew to love this track where it is my absolute favorite from the record. Spotlight is the opening to What's Your Pleasure, but it doesn't open with joy. It opens with Jessie anxious because the night will eventually end. You can hear her efforts to draw out time, such as her sustained phrasing in the chorus. Despite that, it wasn't enough. Melancholy strings at the final chorus appears, indicating the sun’s wake—and the wake from her dream. The song ends with several vocal tracks battling for dominance, bleeding into each other. Even more so, it ends inconclusively. At this point, Jessie has stopped singing, but the instrumentals keep playing. The night is still young, just like this album. There's 11 more tracks until the sun comes up. Might as well continue on.

**Brendon-Urine** (11): Still the stand out from this album for me and by a good margin too. I love the slow build up, and even though it never gets loud it manages to grow and get so tense. Stellar bass line to carry it.

**celladonn** (11): Hmm kind of a perfect song!

**corrodedbeauty** (11): she ate this up

**CritneySpearz** (11): iconic album intro

**daretheghost** (11): Truth be told there are about 5 or 6 other songs I could easily give my 11 to and it feels a little cheap to award it to the first song of the rate. But this song is IT. Someone in the [FRESH] thread for this album said “What's Your Pleasure is Future Nostalgia's cool, mature, mysterious older sister who smokes and takes off on some guy's motorcycle at 1am every night but still somehow got into law school” and ‘Spotlight’ is the perfect example of that.

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): One of my favorite songs from 2020. Everything about this song is perfect!

**IDontWorkHereAtAll** (11): "Can James Ford produce all music from now on?"

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this is such a good song and sets the tone of the album. I love how it builds as well, definitely an epic song

**jayjaysortagay** (11): yesss

**jexan13** (11): this song deserves an oscar, an emmy, a tony, a grammy

**JunkyGS** (11): Jessie’s soft sultry vocals glide across such sophisticated lush production. Along with the great lyrics, such as “ Tell me when I’ll get more than a dream of you “ this is a sophisticated dance floor anthem!

**just\_thonking** (11): I genuinely think this is the best song of 2020, and one of the best of all time. It's a start-to-finish masterpiece. It's one of those songs, like "I Wanna Dance With Somebody," that simultaneously make me want to dance and make me FEEL all sorts of things. It literally has everything!! The longing lyrics, the immaculate production, the sweeping strings, that sensual, pulsating beat, those rich vocals. Perfection. And what's more, it's one of those rare songs that I just cannot get sick of. It's been on my On Repeat playlist literally since it came out last year. I think this is my favorite song of all time... please rate it well!!!

**letsallpoo** (11): can't wait to have sex to this someday. also jessie stop associating with zionism

**luckyphase** (11): I want this song to be the first dance at my wedding (I’m single)

**Misentro** (11): Some girls go their whole careers without an album opener like Spotlight. Beautiful, atmospheric, sexy, moody, romantic, nostalgic, smooth, it's a perfect song in every way.

**mudkip1** (11): i'm rendered inarticulate when describing the joy i get from listening to this. it's otherworldly

**musical\_pyn** (11): everything about this song is incredible. The intro, the harmonies on the verse and the chorus, the beat switch, jessie’s voice-- It’s a basic choice for my 11, but every time I think about giving it to something else I listen to those strings and I’m immediately captured by the sound again. One of my top 5 songs of 2020 for a reason

**NFLfreak98** (11): Too perfect for this world

**nootnoot781** (11): currently dancing around my room at 1 in the morning living my best gay life to this song right now. i am in HEAVEN. god get me in a gay club right now

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): you ever hear a song and your life changes permanently? i've never heard a song that feels as good as this one does. and it feels good. it's sensual, it's heavy, it's free flowing and it feels like velvet and thick smoke and dancing with married men while their wives watch on.

**shesdoingyoga** (11): Every time I listen to a new album, I always listen to the whole thing all the way through without repeating a song until I have gone through all of them. The one exception to this was with Spotlight (Jessie’s Version), it was so good I immediately listened to it again before going on to the rest of the album. One of the best opening tracks I’ve ever heard

**slimboyfriend** (11): You think it's gonna be a lush ballad, then it drops into a lush bop

**starla\_** (11): Feels strange to give my 11 to the first song in the rate but there was no one else. This song is a transcendental experience from beginning to end.

**vagenda** (11): Not an exaggeration to say this is an instant classic. The charm, sleekness, sophistication all refuse to lose their lustre on infinite repeat listens. The production is timeless, the atmosphere so lush and easy to get lost in. A serve, a smash, TRUE pop perfection.

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): I still remember the first time I heard this. I was really excited about new music from Jessie and was surprised how much this new lead single reminded me of “Running” from her debut which was my favorite track from her until this one came along.

skargardin: 
**AGM301** (10): GROOVY

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I mean WOW. The best here is insane.

**bbfan132** (10): yes.

**booksandplantsand** (10): the intro segueing into that velvety bass whew

**buddhacharm** (10): Absolutely breathtaking opener, it just unfurls in such a way that you could literally listen to it for hours on end. The superior Spotlight in this race and by miles

**cherryices** (10): the chorus and outro are so achingly lush

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): what an incredible opener... the absolute DRAMA. "tell me when i'll get more than a dream of you" hits a bit too close to home whew

**conceptualromance** (10): starting off with a serve. I love the dramatic intro

**Exaltatus** (10): A kiss is just a kiss, but Spotlight is the whole-ass foreplay.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I first got into Jessie because her song “Midnight” got a perfect ten in the popheads Jukebox (RIP) and *Glasshouse* was one of my favorite albums the year it came out so the bar was set high for the lead single for Jessie’s next project… and she cleared that hurdle with ease. This is so impossibly smooth

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): https://media.tenor.com/images/bafa71e73e6b6f8802672c0c663b9f64/tenor.gif

**Gonza\_90** (10): A great start for a great album

**hikkaru** (10): the melodies are heavenly

**JackStrait** (10): Unbelievably good production, unbelievably good writing, unbelievably good music video. Do I need to continue?

**jasannn** (10): This is grown-up shit right here.

**KuhBus** (10): Incredibly sexy, if a tiny bit too long.

**lexarqade** (10): just incredible. Makes me long for the love I've never had. I wish I was on a disco train.

**lolcevan** (10): a masterpiece

**Parabox314** (10): In love with this track, so groovy and smooth, sets the tone of the album perfectly.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I was sure this would be my 11 at first but it's grown off me a little. Still a 10 though

**pietrohonkhonk** (10): This song absolutely blew me away when I first heard it, easy 10

**pros-and-connors** (10): the cooler Daniel

**proscett** (10): utter perfection -- one of the contenders for my 11. i think it's the song that best represents WYP? as a whole.

**qazz23** (10): Great opener. Love the bridge and the extra percussion in the last chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The runner up for my 11, what a fantastic start to this album! The harmonies are gorgeous, Jessie's vocals feel dreamy and seductive, and it's a great way to tell the listener the amazingness they're about to experience

**ReallyCreative** (10): PHENOMENAL introduction, I can feel my asshole loosen as the song builds

**rotating3Dtext** (10): this is probably the most catchy song in the album for me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I yearn for a spotlight moon to dance under when playing this, her magnum opus tbh. Full of cinematic drama, joy and melancholy at the same time.

**shockdbinary** (10): album opener supremacy, no one above her.

**SmileAndTears** (10): This song has grown on me so much since I first heard it. The drums on the bridge and the outro are out of this world

**Stryxen** (10): gee jessie how come your mom lets you have two choruses

**TiltControls** (10): What a way to start the rate!

**vayyiqra** (10): I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight / I need you all night, come on, dance with me / I'm levitating whoops wrong song. Anyway this is a really good intro to this album and this rate. This feels like music for a dancefloor at night, which is good, because I am doing this in my bed and about as humanly far from dancing as one can be. It sets the mood, you know?

**wavingwolves** (10): this song has so many layers and textures and i love every single one of them

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): Such a stunning song, it feels lush, expensive, sensual and longing all at the same time!

**Chevsapher** (9.6): What an opener. The strong songwriting and lush, detailed production make this track feel shorter than it actually is.

**1998tweety** (9.5): when the song goes off at the end I ASCEND

**pheromenos** (9.5): as much as i love Kylie, this Spotlight outsold hers with ease

**seanderlust** (9.5): the instrumentation here is stellar. I love the little bubble pops at the end.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): Iconic opening track

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9.5): Yes girl.

**Turpamutteri** (9.5): This is close to perfection

**ACORGIORGY** (9): what a way to kick an album off

**banananaise** (9): i vaguely remember someone on Jessie's podcast saying he constantly heard this song on his partner's playlist while swimming and tbh i can sympathise because spotify constantly gives me this song no matter what i'm listening to, it's like So Hot You're Hurting My Feeling's twin sister

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Oh gosh I love this at first listen. This feels very lush and relaxing.

**EnCaine** (9): a stunning opener for a stunning album

**engifear** (9): So sexy

**Flegasaurus** (9): BANGER

**frogaranaman** (9): ain’t that the movie about the Boston Globe

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Gorgeous melody

**Vromega** (9): Fantastic opening. Nice orchestration + beat. Already a highlight of this album

**akanewasright** (8.7): This song took a while to grow on me, because I kind of found it too perfect, to the point where there was little appeal for the listener. It felt sophisticated to the point of not having a real hook or point of interest for the listener. But as I listened more and more to a song being dubbed an obvious potential winner, I found myself more and more transfixed by it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): IF ONLY I COULD LEEEEET YOU GO

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.3): Undoubtedly quite good, but I think the album has much better moments

**Awkward\_King** (8): what a fucking BOUJEE train

**cremeebrulee** (8): idk i never really loved this one so seeing it do so well on top 100 of 2020 was kind of shocking. i like the outro but as an opener, it’s not my favorite.

**KennyEarthman** (8): the intro sounds so disney-esque

**LuisEnRod** (8): the bridge is the best part of the entire song

**maxrocks329** (8): A great opener, it does a good job of introducing you to the album as a whole

**nooodisaster** (8): Great opener, tho I am less favorable to this than most (so therefore this is gonna win). Still, immediately I could feel that this album just dripped sophistication. Jessie Ware has this otherworldly ability of picking songwriters and producers to contribute to her effortless sense of classiness and grace.

**runaway3212** (8): I like this but I feel like it's a bit overhyped, there's a lot better on the album

**targetguest** (7.5): the high background vocals and the synthetic water drop MAKE this song

**MrSwearword** (7): Let me say this now for tracks one to six. The production on the first three especially are fire, but the vocals on the first half of the album irritated me with how fucking boring they are I'm only just now listening to the second half of this for this rate and probably never again. Scores for first half reflect this.

**waluigiest** (7): I love the intro and I love how it almost emulates a classic Donna Summer-esque structure, but then it drops into a midtempo song with so much lost potential.

#I applaud your bravery honestly

**ManofOranges** (3): I know I'm probably gonna be on the lower end of scores for this song but I'm actually just sick of this song. Mainly because I never found it that interesting to begin with. Like I believe that a lot of the songs on this album just don't take me anywhere and I get bored. And also because Spotify LOVES to shove this song down my throat it seems. No matter what I listen to--it could be Carly, it could be Phoebe Bridgers, it could be Green Day--Spotify will somehow find a way to play this song (and also So Hot You're Hurting My Feelings, what's up with that??) and at this point it just feels annoying to have to hear that opening. The words "ain't enough to say" trigger my fight or flight response at this point.

skargardin: # Kylie Minogue - DISCO

---

**Overall Average**: 7.452 **// Average Controversy:** 1.766

[All user averages](https://paste.ee/p/7mDtE)

---

**skargardin** (9.000): Honestly a lot of this album was done insanely dirty in this rate but I suppose that was inevitable give its track list length. I absolutely adore this album in all its glorious cheesiness and joyful escapism. Top six Kylie album for me personally!

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.625): Rhythm of Love, Light Years, Aphrodite and now Disco - Kylie continues delivering career highlights in the first year of every decade since the 90s. This is undoubtedly one of her best albums, it's unfortunate that it had to go up against the two nu-disco juggernauts of 2020.

---
**TheQueenOfVultures** (8.906): Kylie being able to do an album like this 20 years after Your Disco Needs You is legendary

**plastichaxan** (8.694): i saw some of the scores y’all were giving to this album and was hurt but also this has a special place in my heart, i got a drag family recently and my drag mom is a huge kylie fan, when this came out we met to do a family listening party with my drag sisters and it kind of feels like our haus album and it also just gives me that buzz

**AHSWeeknd** (8.563): Kylie made magic with this. This album is really welcoming, an aspect of disco only this album captures.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.406): Calling this album "Disco" when it's really just a collection of disco inspired synthpop with some extra strings is a very audacious move. It's an enjoyable album, but it's very safe, and struggles to have a real stand-out track

**ReallyCreative** (8.319): This album is a lot of fun, but can be a victim of its own success. Individual songs are better than the album as a whole simply because it's a little too campy, sugary, and bright to handle all at once. It's a lot of the same, and as a result it's really hard to listen to this all in one go, in stark contrast to the other albums in this rate. It's still fantastic Kylie though, some of the songs in here are absolutely among her best.

**daretheghost** (8.281): 8 An album that does what it needs and sets out to do, and that’s not a knock against it. An improvement over Kylie’s previous album for sure.

**KuhBus** (8.250): 9

**rickikardashian** (8.231): if this gets done wrong im throwing punches

**TiltControls** (8.156): I've heard people say that this album is the worst of the bunch, but I don't know I really love it. There are definitely songs that stand out more than others, but overall it's a great record.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.037): i'm a Disco Defender but i will admit that it is a bit weaker than the other two not because it's bad (it's great!), but because it's a bit bloated with tracks that end up being a bit redundant. trimming it down to 10-12 of the strongest tracks would've made it all killer no filler, but at the same time 2020 definitely needed fun pop like this so i get it

**runaway3212** (8.000): This was my first kylie album and it's so good. Even though now that I've listened to more kylie I think it's a bit weak compared to some of her other stuff

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.875): I remember listening to Fever in a rate long time ago and it's nice to listen to another Kylie project. This is a good pop album and the disco influences really shined here. It's sort of what I wanted from Future Nostalgia as a full-on disco pop project.

**bigbigbee** (7.813): This album feels like a k-pop album to me, but like, not really in a bad way. It’s very pop-friendly while not terribly innovative. When the tracks embrace cheesy fun, it really really works. I definitely don’t hear what people are saying when they say that this is the clear weakest of the three; I think it’s just hurt by being the longest (and I do think a cut or two would have improved it slightly).

**pat-rickstar** (7.781): Revisiting this for the rate made me like it a lot more than I had previously. It's definitely my least favourite of the three but there's still a lot of good album cuts here along with some fantastic singles.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.750): maybe too cohesive, some of the songs sound like repeats (especially the deluxe songs)

**conceptualromance** (7.706): I love Kylie but this isn’t her best work and she’s up against two of the best releases from last year

**buddhacharm** (7.688): This is the weakest album of the bunch but my average will probably be high even though I'm rather mid on it! I've been a Kylie stan for eons, I had to stomach the absurdly boring, dull, heterosexual (bar Raining Glitter), and insipid hillbilly dixie barndance music that was Molden so THANKFULLY this was a breath of fresh air (in comparison). I kinda hope she experiments more with her next album — Kylie + Garibay was an intriguing moment in her career that she never really followed up on, so while Disco is fun, I'd like her to venture outside her wheelhouse a little bit more

**CreepyMannequin** (7.594): What else can I say but we stan.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.563): Is Disco Disco, or is Disco Nu-Disco? Is Nu-Disco Disco?

**banananaise** (7.563): honestly it feels strange rating this album next to What's Your Pleasure and Róisin Machine, it just feels so different, more genuinely disco (kitsch and all) while the other two feel a lot more sexphisticated and house-influenced

**KennyEarthman** (7.469): pros: a very happy nostalgic album you can dance to, songs each have their own identity and very catchy hook // cons: a little bloated, the album could've ended after Dance Floor Darling tbh

**qazz23** (7.438): Most tracks are catchy but lack variety and sometimes too glossy; my least favorite of the nu disco albums

**geraldinewww** (7.412): i've had this on my itunes for months but whenever i remember it, it really just all melds together. it just feels like one very long song, but not really in a great way? i like it alright, none of the songs are bad, it just all kinda... is. the only one that really stands out and i like to listen to by itself is say something, and obviously that was as single

**Brendon-Urine** (7.344): Kylie killed it here tbh. Just banger after banger - no "slow disco" experimentation, just hooks upon hooks. I was obsessed when it came out and still am today.

**jasannn** (7.331): They're all fun and catchy earworms but it feels shallow and basic compared to the other albums here. But if that's what you're looking for or need at the moment, this cohesive retro album will do the trick. 7.331

**sirpancakeXI** (7.219): The second half of the album just isn't it for me, it is just filler after filler.

**waluigiest** (7.188): I think I like this album. It’s nice to put on and listen absent mindedly, and some of the tracks are massive bops. But when you take the tracks on their own a lot feel underdeveloped and uninspiring. Some of the “DISCO” works but some is quite generic

**nooodisaster** (7.125): she's good

**SmileAndTears** (7.119): There's just something about Kylie's voice that I cannot stand. Part of me just wants to call her a poor man's Carly but I know I'll get bullied for saying this sooo... Anyway, this is one of those albums where the singles are pretty amazing but the rest is just... bleh

**iniekcja\_** (7.000): doesn't sound as fresh as the other ones tbh

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.000): 7 There’s a lot of skips, but also a lot of fun bops

**Stryxen** (6.981): disco

**EnCaine** (6.862): Fever is one of my favorite albums and i like some of her early singles, but i never properly listened to later-era kylie before this rate. this was fun even if pretty flawed

**Leixander** (6.500): As a huge Kylie fan, this album was disappointing. Compared to the other two albums in this rate, the quality difference is huge. The lyrics sound like they were spat out by an AI. The first two singles however are pretty cute.

**corrodedbeauty** (6.469): Jessie Ware’s album is expensive Swiss chocolate, whereas this one is like jolly ranchers candy… very saccharine, easily consumable, and catchy, but in a cheap, outdated way

**vayyiqra** (6.438): This album is not as good as the other two ! I like Kylie Minogue and enjoy her music but did not enjoy this as much ! Oh no !

**lexarqade** (6.250): Unfortunately, this album suffers from just going on waaaay too long and kinda blurs into itself and not in a good way. Thankfully it starts out strong!

**slimboyfriend** (6.156): This album isn't bad, it just sounds like Kylie's label told her to make a generic disco album, and that's what she turned out. It's not as lush as What's Your Pleasure or as bonkers as Roisin Machine.

**LuisEnRod** (6.125): every single song sounds exactly the same. Why?

**just\_thonking** (6.094): It's an enjoyable listen but at the end of the day feels a little hollow to me

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.031): mid tbh...also why so long

**mudkip1** (5.813): the majority of this album aged like milk but the singles are still great

**bespectacIed** (5.313): This is the definition of disco fatigue. It was so tiring to finish damn. Also 90% of the album sounds like demos for everglow gfriend twice

**frogaranaman** (4.500): Pitchfork maybe had a point

skargardin: # Róisín Murphy - Róisín Machine

---

**Overall Average**: 8.276 **// Average Controversy:** 1.560

[All user averages](https://paste.ee/p/BNjiI)

---

**skargardin** (9.500): This album era introduced me to miss Róisín and I'm really grateful for that because man was I missing out. This album is a joyride front to back, even the interlude esque Kingdom of Ends and Game Changer work really well in the whole context. She really did that and I absolutely cannot wait to hear how this is going to reimagined on Crooked Machine, out April 30th!!

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.500): Listening to this album for the first time as soon as it dropped on October 2nd was the best hour of my 2020.

---
**Leixander** (9.850): With the perfect transitions and everything, this is what I wanted from her and more.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.600): tbt to me getting chosen to do a backup writeup for this album and then getting too busy with school to take the time to sit down and do it

**AHSWeeknd** (9.500): The only album here that actually captures disco rather than influenced by disco.

**LazyDayLullaby** (9.470): My 2020 AOTY. Even after dozens and dozens and dozens of listens of both the normal and Deluxe versions, it still thrills and delights. Jealousy is one of my all-time favourite closing tracks (especially the Extended Mix... just WOW)

**ReallyCreative** (9.460): I'm really loving that popheads is getting a proper introduction to Roisin Murphy. As a longtime fan, she has a way with pop music that transcends the expected and ordinary and Roisin Machine is no exception. This album is a wonderful party mix, but also feels in tuned to the isolated nature of quarantine. The themes of wanting, longing, and loneliness are contrasted with some of the danciest music 2020 had to offer. It's just impressive as a body of work, and the single edits are fantastic on their own. Stream Overpowered.

**waluigiest** (9.400): WOW. This was the album I was least familiar with coming in, but by far my favorite. The songs are all danceable, clean, fresh, and full of personality. I really feel like it’s just the ideal disco revival album.

**conceptualromance** (9.340): This album is literally so good I can’t believe it

**qazz23** (9.300): I love the funky disco style she brings here, some tracks are a little too long though

**engifear** (9.300): Easily my favorite album on the rate and I'm so glad I discovered it

**daretheghost** (9.300): 9 My second favorite album of last year! It’s difficult for me to articulate why I like some songs more than others because this album is more ‘vibey’ than the other two in the rate. The lyrics and instrumentation are more cyclical and trancey and I think it works in the album’s favor - and certainly makes it feel like something you’d hear in a Berlin nightclub at 3AM.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.200): I actually tried this album once last year but it didn't click on me that time. But relistening it now have made me realized how much i have missed for snubbing this album.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9.150): This album feels the most "Disco" compared to the others and I love it for that. Not many people are willing to put out tracks like these

**buddhacharm** (9.050): This was the first Róisín era that I was able to experience as a fan and it was absolutely worth the scattershot rollout. This album is so elegant and disorienting, it's like the even older sister of FN and WYP that routinely drops acid on the weekend. At first I wasn't into how the album was structured but it's cohered a lot for me since then — it has this weird and tense momentum that never really yields but diffuses in certain bouts of release. It's a very intriguing listen from one of pop music's most beguiling and charismatic voices for sure

**banananaise** (8.950): honestly in retrospect i don't know how i wasn't obsessed with Róisin Murphy before this album - so much of her music has followed me through my life from The Time Is Now to Ramalama (Bang Bang) and i didn't even realise it was her

**akanewasright** (8.940): Tbh I’d argue that this is the best album in the rate. The first half is all buildup, with the payoff coming very late in the game. It’s expertly done, and the back half is genuinely stunning in every regard, but you kind of have to be in a certain mood for it.

**EnCaine** (8.840): i listened to this right when it came out and had really polarized feelings - and i have no idea what tf i was on because this entire second listen was sooo good

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.800): smash after smash

**pat-rickstar** (8.770): I thought Jessie would run away with my highest average and 11 in this rate at first but after I listened to this album several times throughout the month, it really grew on me and I ended up giving them almost the exact same average.

**plastichaxan** (8.410): i was scared i wouldn’t like this, i listened to this only once before and didn’t remember much, i’m glad i was wrong in thinking i wouldn’t like this, there’s some stuff i feel like i’m underrating even and that i need more time with, but the last few tracks were just a great run and i’m glad i got to re-listen for this

**mudkip1** (8.300): she took me like 8 listens but i finally understand her now. i'm sure this album will get slaughtered but it fully deserves to be included

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.250): 8.25

**nooodisaster** (8.200): Thank you for introducing me to this album, I loved discovering it!

**oscarbrierley1** (8.130): this is the least accessible of the three, some of the songs are loooong but theres some real high points

**lexarqade** (8.000): Definitely the least familiar with this album but I love the vibes it gives off. Such a shame everything is closed because I'd love to just be in a dive bar with this playing on loop.

**just\_thonking** (7.900): Tbh the album for me is just prologue, Murphy's Law, epilogue -- but the prologue and epilogue aren't bad!

**KennyEarthman** (7.900): pros: very atmospheric, this album is a whole experience // cons: songs are kinda unnecessarily long and repetitive

**SmileAndTears** (7.780): This is probably blasphemous to say but I don't care. I don't like this brand of repetitive disco where every song goes on for way too long, it's boring as hell

**slimboyfriend** (7.680): This album makes Kylie's sound like children's music.

**Stryxen** (7.650): my hips are moving and i can't stop them

**vayyiqra** (7.600): This album is by Róisín Murphy who is from Ireland. I enjoy her music very much such as her albums "Ruby Blue" and "Overpowered". This album is not as good as those albums but it is still an enjoyable album. I like Róisín Murphy and how her name is pronounced in a very unintuitive way that rhymes with "machine". This allows for the album title to be an amusing pun.

**bespectacIed** (7.500): toss your disco shoes in my róisín machine heart baby bang it up inside

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.310): I really feel bad that I couldn't dig in this album as much as I wanted to because I do think this kind of project would be something worthy of critical acclaim. While I don't see myself repeating this album often (or maybe I might do so I can digest the album better), I feel like this is the most cohesive album in this rate and I definitely think that it should be a strength in this rate. I do hope at least Narcissus makes it to the top ten because it's the best song in this rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.230): This album did improve for me on follow-up listens, but overall I still found that most of the tracks went on for too long without enough interesting things happening to justify the runtime, a lot of the instrumentals just felt really harsh and abrasive but not abrasive to the level of hyperpop where that's the point. It's very much a mixed bag for me

**rickikardashian** (7.060): since i couldnt sabotage what’s your pleasure? so kylie would do better, i decided to sabotage this album >!for legal reasons that’s a joke!<

**LuisEnRod** (7.000): just came to say that even if I don’t love every song on this album, I definitely love the transitions between the songs. I’m always a sucker for that.

**KuhBus** (6.600): 8 Unique, interesting production.

**CreepyMannequin** (6.000): I can imagine coming back to this album in a few years and wondering why it didn’t stand out to me in 2020/2021, but for now I found it pretty underwhelming.

**Brendon-Urine** (4.900): I never set out to bully artists in rates but this is closest I've come to feeling bad. I just could NOT get this album. The only songs I liked are the fun upbeat catchy ones, the slower tracks just don't go over well. And yes I listened to the entire album multiple times, it honestly got worse the more I listened.

skargardin: # Jessie Ware - What's Your Pleasure?

---

**Overall Average**: 8.662 **// Average Controversy:** 1.351

[All user averages](https://paste.ee/p/ThY98)

---

**skargardin** (9.417): [I mean.](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/l5k4m9/popheads_album_of_the_year_2020_26_jessie_ware/)

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.167): Classy, sexy, cool.

---
**mudkip1** (9.917): get ready for my almost 10 avg ladies i love this album that much. it's almost perfect

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9.917): This was my favorite album of last year, it feels timeless

**qazz23** (9.833): My AOTY 2020. Really great production/vocals and everything just works

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.800): by far my favorite album of 2020, it was a gorgeous nugget of escapism. Jessie's musical journey has been so interesting, and I'm happy to see HER so happy about what she's doing. now we just need the deluxe, Ms. Ware!

**corrodedbeauty** (9.625): sophisticated, urbane, euphoric–Jessie is giving everything with this album

**Leixander** (9.542): Oh dear, oh dear. Gorgeous.

**EnCaine** (9.400): this album made a very miserable part of quarantine much more bearable

**RandomHypnotica** (9.375): I knew this album was going to be good but… WOW! The quality here shines through, the instrumentals are so lush and colourful and beautiful, Jessie's lyricism and vocals were the perfect accompaniment, and it truly feels like the definiton of "nu-disco"

**daretheghost** (9.333): 9.5 My favorite album of last year and in my opinion perfect with a few edits.

**oscarbrierley1** (9.308): almost perfect from start to end, really struggled not giving everything a ten

**jexan13** (9.292): this album feels like kisses. Not sex, just kisses from a friend, enough to make you start feeling things for them.

**lexarqade** (9.167): Truly my fave album of 2020 and maybe the decade. I listen to it front to back multiple times a week and never get tired of it. Does it make me biased? Maybe. But it is just THAT good.

**buddhacharm** (9.167): First of all, absolutely my 2020 AOTY — I've been a fan of Jessie's since 2012 and it's been so gratifying to see her bookend her discography with undeniably her best album since Devotion. If 2020 was the year of the disco revival, then What’s Your Pleasure? is undoubtedly the best it had to offer and probably the closest thing we got to true, electric dancefloor magic. Second of all, yes it is definitely Future Nostalgia's older sister like everyone says, though it's also prettier, smarter, sexier, more talented, more showstopping, more bombastic, and has a fatter ass than FN too

**ReallyCreative** (9.125): This album is an entire experience; wonderful fusions of city pop and disco creating a sultry, engaging, and mysterious masterpiece with only a couple low moments. I can attest there is no greater feeling than listening to Spotlight or Remember Where You Are while watching the sun come up on my drives to work, or even just driving at night in general. If "last night was a movie," this album is the soundtrack.

**vayyiqra** (9.083): This is the best album in this rate. It is very good and enjoyable. It is not really disco but that doesn't matter. I like this album.

**just\_thonking** (9.083): Favorite album of 2020 and one that only gets better with time

**runaway3212** (9.042): I love this album so much it's really great

**plastichaxan** (9.017): My favorite album of the 3 before doing the rate and it kept being the same way. Jessie did something here that I truly love and I’m sad to say it took me a while to fully appreciate how great of an album this is, but it truly became one of my faves from last year.

**bespectacIed** (9.000): Are we sure jessie is white, this is too flavorful and masterful of a disco album

**nooodisaster** (8.917): the way i could give every song on this album a 10 and you couldn't tell me shit.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.917): The cover could’ve been better tbh, but the album is a whole vibe.

**geraldinewww** (8.883): my 2nd top played album of 2020 right behind sawayama

**sirpancakeXI** (8.833): I am still proud of myself for suggesting this album to my friend and it end up being their aoty.

**engifear** (8.833): I'm just gonna comment "so sexy" on every song except Ooh La La because it's true

**Stryxen** (8.800): i am not sure this album will ever age - it still sounds unbelievably fresh

**twat\_brained** (8.792): I put this on and my sisters said it was "boring". Yes, they are in fact straight

**pat-rickstar** (8.767): Still haven't got around to listening to any of Jessie's other albums since discovering this because I haven't tired of it at all. It's fantastic and I hope she continues to make disco music in the future

**SmileAndTears** (8.708): But wow, what a moment. A moment that is most pleasing to me in my career. To be honest, I didn't love this album at first. I thought it sounded too chic, almost like sophistipop. But after repeted listens I grew to really like the album and it became one of my favourites of 2020

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.625): no doubt one of my fave albums of last year

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.492): The second best Nu-Disco album of the 2020s (so far!) is still quite good - always an enjoyable listen, particularly the last few tracks

**TiltControls** (8.375): I listened to a few songs from the album last year and then just passed over it. Uh, wtf was wrong with me?!? This album is amazing!

**KennyEarthman** (8.333): pros: a perfect blend of the pop bangers of DISCO and the atmospheric-ness of Roisin Machine // cons: there's some tracks that get lost in the blend but it's still cool

**waluigiest** (8.333): Great album. I’ve never been gagged over it, but it’s always a good listen. No skips.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.225): Wow I never noticed how long this album. You know an album is that amazing when you don't notice the length because of how you vibed with it full-on. I can totally see why Jessie Ware was so hyped in the subreddit. This is definitely my favorite album out of this rate!

**rickikardashian** (8.108): i wanted to sabotage this so kylie would do it but i cant in good faith do it to an album this good

**jasannn** (8.092): I don't know why it took me so long to get into this album when Future Nostalgia was my AOTY. It truly is Future Nostalgia's older and more mature sister that is over the dance clubs and chills into the night lounges. It also finds the perfect middle between the poppiness of DISCO and the instrumental focus of Róisín Machine.

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.042): 8.042

**banananaise** (8.042): her HAIR on the cover art (and on the single artworks too)... kills me every time! HOW is this woman

**KuhBus** (7.500): 8 Overall amazing, seductive sound.

**conceptualromance** (7.458): this album is too h*rny for quarantine smh

**CreepyMannequin** (6.333): Starts off super strong (Spotlight and Soul Control are 11 worthy) but none of the songs after the first four really stood out to me. I can definitely see why it’s popular though!

TiltControls: Thanks Niki and Skar for hosting! It was a fantastic rate with some perfect shitposts! Also the graphs and banners were amazing! And the hint comments too!

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_songs) updated like always!

###Songs

**Spotlight** takes a few notable achievements today (besides winning a stacked rate). First is a stellar #31 highest song average across all rates. Spotlight also takes the #8 spot for most 11's of all time as well! 

That's not Jessie's only achievement as **What's Your Pleasure** (song) follows right behind with the #35 highest song average of all time too!

###Artists
Well at least **Kylie** made a lot of new friends today

First (and maybe the most discussed so far) is D'Angelo. Kylie joins him in a tie for the earliest 3 album rate exit with The Charade/Magic both leaving at #10. While DISCO didn't deserve it, Black Messiah **definitely** didn't deserve it. At least both made top 10?

Kylie also tied the record for longest bottom leaderboard sweep, losing 8 songs before any of her competitors. She joins Lil Uzi Vert who did the same in his rate (though that was 4 albums). 

In a less depressing tie for Kylie fans, she rises to the top 10 of most songs rated with 76, joining Rihanna for 8th

Enough about Kylie though - **Jessie** had quite the rate didn't she? And while Kylie's records where her getting destroyed, Jessie was the one doing the destroying. 

This actually wasn't her first entry in the database as she featured in a song in the KAYTRANADA/Flume/Disclosure rate long long ago. Still, now that she has a full album rated her average took a definite leap. She lands in the top 10 for highest artist averages at #2! 

She also takes a record for day 3 song coverage, with 75% of the day 3 songs being hers (One Direction and Grimes held this record in a tie with 66% previously).

This was also **Róisín's** first rate too, though not as dominant as Jessie was she still had a fantastic go. She also lands on top 10 highest artist averages at #10 on the dot. We'll see if she can hold it in All Stars.

###Rates
I mentioned it on day 1, but this rate takes a number of '9' records. 9th highest average, 9th lowest controversy, and 9th most rate participants are all held by the Nu-Disco rate now.

Also from the stats coming in today it turns out the rate also lands on the list for highest % of people to use their 11s with 97.86% of the participants giving one out! I'll give you one guess what place they take in the top 10 (no joke, it's starting to get weird now)

###Albums
[I've added a new category onto the leaderboard page!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard#wiki_albums) (Although it's looking a little empty right now.)

For now it'll just be highest and lowest album averages, but I hope to also get controversy, 11% and 0% on there as well at some point. I'll also get the rest of the album averages on the spreadsheet hopefully.

For this rate we actually have a few new additions to the new list! **Róisín Machine** lands at #19 for highest album averages and **What's Your Pleasure** ends up at an even better #4.

Now since albums mean a lot of things, I've got a question about how to define them for this list. The two main options to include

1. Any of an artists' songs in the main rate. This gives a better picture to how they did in the rate. This would include any remixes or non-album singles included in the main rate by the host. ~~it's also easier for me to calculate~~

2. Songs only found on the album. This gives a better picture of how well liked the album is in the real world, but doesn't always match how the artist did in the rate. This would exclude any remixes or non-album singles not on the album (deluxe album tracks would still be included).

Let me know what would probably better to keep track of going forward!

[edit: also see Niki's comment for a much nicer looking and much more full album list!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mtgptp/2020_nudisco_rate_reveal_day_3_do_you_believe_in/gv07cx9/)

RandomHypnotica: Depsite it being more work, I think that the 2nd option is the right thing to do there for album averages, because like you said, it better represents our thoughts on the actual album. One big example is Melodrama, where the Homemade Dynamite Remix is the only Lorde song to go Day 1 in that rate, but when anyone thinks of Melodrama, do they really think of that remix?
