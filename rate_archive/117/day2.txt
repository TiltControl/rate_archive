Just saying this bc when she loses songs today it's because it's inevitable...unlike yesterday where there was room for her talentry to spare her ~~and it did~~

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The "From another galaxy, like Jupiter or Mars" astronomy blunder would be inexcusable in any other case, but, damn, does this song EXPLODE at you right from the start and maintains the same energy all the way through. Stellar (he-he) track.

**skargardin** (10): I have to LAUGH at the fact that we're right back on our bullshit. NASA employees are shaking in their boots at the gospel of Supernova. A lot of you got hung up on the "from another galaxy like Jupiter or Mars" lyric, which I personally think is a weird thing to get hung up on considering how much this SLAPS. We love an alien queen idc. This is such a banger from the in-your-face vocoder, the production, and Kylie manages to actually belt a bit towards the end. But it's too bad that it gets partly drowned out in the barrage of synths but it IS definitely there. I fear this was slightly robbed.

---

#Alien queens

**Chevsapher** (11): The vocoder hook, the massive strings, the descant, the thumping bassline, the intergalactic imagery—this track is three minutes of dancepop euphoria. I sincerely believe it is Kylie's best song since “Get Outta My Way,” and I am still hoping for a proper video.

**CreepyMannequin** (11): This is a song that I immediately fell in love with. The song is so joyful and futuristic, plus it's an absolute bop. Definitely my favourite Kylie song.

**1998tweety** (10): it was camp

**booksandplantsand** (10): the adrenaline rush that hits me as soon as that distorted voice starts the song needs to be studied

**Brendon-Urine** (10): And here we have my "best bass line mini rate" winner. DUH DUH, DUHDUH DUH DUH, DUHDUH DUH DUH, DUHDUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH DUH, DUHDUH DUH DUH, DUHDUH DUH DUH, DUHDUH DUH DUH DUH DUH-

**celladonn** (10): "From another galaxy like Jupiter and Mars" is so thuddingly stupid that I can't help but adore it

**cremeebrulee** (10): i also failed an astronomy class

**daretheghost** (10): Invented space travel. I needed to adjust all my scores for this album because I have to compare everything to this song, which I feel is the best on the album. My lone Kylie contender for an 11, oop.

**Exaltatus** (10): All I need is just a little more of Supernova.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Somehow this song made me gayer….

**hikkaru** (10): nasa heard this song and realized that yes, jupiter and mars are not only separate from our own galaxy but are also galaxies of their own. are jessica and raisin astronomers? didn't think so

**ignitethephoenix** (10): we love a NASA scientist !

**jexan13** (10): the battle hymn for when the g*ys finally decide to raid the scammy's HQ

**Misentro** (10): Where were you when Kylie accidentally revealed that she's from a different galaxy

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): SMASH

**MrSwearword** (10): a goddamn triumph

**qazz23** (10): Favorite off the album

**runaway3212** (10): the energy here is unmatched

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): It’s a banger and the unscientific lyrics are in the "so bad it actually improves the song" category. Pure retro-futuristic pastiche. Shout out to the galaxies Jupiter and Mars.

**seanderlust** (10): jupiter and mars are in this .....you know what, never mind. it's fine. you're gorgeous kylie.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Ma’am please take an astronomy class

**shockdbinary** (10): for me, disco music emanates energy that goes beyond galaxies, beyond interstellar things and nothing more characteristic than a supernova, a rising star that shines like never before.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): We stan a queen who is uneducated about astronomy

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Kylie intergalactic queen

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): probably my favorite kylie song

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): Songs with lyrics about space are always good for some reason, this is no exception!

**ACORGIORGY** (9): stole my wig and blew me out of \orbit

**akanewasright** (9): the biggest fucking song in the record

**bulforster** (9): Queen of astronomy, I'm sorry but she's the authority here.

**KuhBus** (9): Intense and delicious.

**lolcevan** (9): queen of astronomy!

**maxrocks329** (9): What's a better song about space, this or Lady Gaga's Venus? I can't decide, they're both amazing

**Parabox314** (9): We love a graduate of Barbz School Of Astrophysics!

**ReallyCreative** (9): queen of failing astronomy

**cherryices** (8.8): i’m an absolute sucker for interstellar imagery in sparkly pop songs

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): more like superyesva

**bbfan132** (8.5): not the bridge throwing me off again… the vocal production is a bit odd too but i think it’s done on purpose (i still think it’s very good)

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): strings and vocoders, baybeeeee

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Production on another planet. Its so good.

**bigbigbee** (8): This is also just a k-pop song. Loverholic Robotronic indeed.

**Flegasaurus** (8): why is kylie minogue shining like a fucking exploding ball of gas holy shit

**JackStrait** (8): Super catchy. I'll definitely be coming back to this one.

**KennyEarthman** (8): Venus outsold

**nooodisaster** (8): This is (neu)disco. [im also serious, like this feels like a mix of 2010s electropop and 70s disco production in a really great way]

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): i really like the chorus but the beginning sounds so much like it could be an old shinee song

**TheCatWithoutAName** (8): Would've given this a 7.5 but Supernova stans will come for me if they see anything below an 8.

**jasannn** (7.8): Super sugary.

**corrodedbeauty** (7.5): first half of the song is a 5, second half is a 10, divide it up

**Leixander** (7.5): I adore the Light Years mashup version of this, it gets the bonus one and a half points from that. (From another galaxy like Jupiter and Mars still makes me seethe though)

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): I'm gonna take a guess that Kylie had a C average in Science

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.2): Good but kind of fades into the background compared to previous ones

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): this grew off me a bit ngl

**EnCaine** (7): not crazy about the rest of the song the chorus is pretty nice and makes up for it!

**ManofOranges** (7): But Jupiter and Mars are in the same galaxy as us?

**musical\_pyn** (7): I like it, but the energy is kinda all over the place

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): “From another galaxy, like Jupiter and Mars”

**Stryxen** (7): something something barbz astrology university

#Jupiter this..Mars that...galaxy this.. galaxy that

**engifear** (6.5): Professor of Barb University, Dr. Minogue

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): it could be a better score but… “from another galaxy like jupiter and mars”

**frogaranaman** (6): isn’t this the PBS show

**vayyiqra** (6): haha kylie bad astronomy lol

**wavingwolves** (6): this song is relatable because i also don't know shit about astronomy or whatever

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I don’t really care for this one, the production feels unfocused and a bit generic given the lyrical themes. The chorus is flat too and even *I* find the hook stupid, and I’m the Megatron

**Gonza\_90** (4): From another galaxy like Jupiter and Mars?????

**proscett** (4): you can tell they were running out of space-adjacent lyrics on this one lmao

**SmileAndTears** (4): Can she stop with the "bring it back" refrain, it's so annoying 😭

**Alumineous** (3): Didn't even gravitate me.

**bespectacIed** (2): what in the disco gaga

**mudkip1** (0): sorry i dont stan at all:(

**skargardin** (9): Believe it or not but we've finally cut the first Jessie song from the main rate! Took her long enough to show up smh my head. It doesn't come as a surprise to me that this slow but sultry ballad is the first cut from What's Your Pleasure?. Balladphobia is a plague honestly. I enjoy this a lot more over some of the later songs on the album so I'm sad to see this go first from the album.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): This is a really surprising inclusion on the album. It's technically the lead single, but it sounds quite different from the other 11 tracks, and, arguably, even Overtime fits here better. Despite this, Adore You is a very cute moment of calm that still manages to be groovy.

---

#x artist outsold

**static\_int\_husp** (9): outsold H*rry Styl*s

**cherryices** (7.9): what is it about songs titled ‘adore you’?

**runaway3212** (7): miley outsold

**wavingwolves** (7): i can't believe harry styles made a better adore you than jessie this is so wicked and fucked up...

**waluigiest** (5): Miley outsold and I’m not afraid to say it

**maxrocks329** (4): Miley Cyrus did it better

#I Adore You <3

**EnCaine** (11): this is my favorite song on the record. The production on this is out of this world (want to mention that it kinda reminds me stylistically of portions of What It Feels Like For A Girl by Madonna which is a sound i LOVE and should be used more) and the lyrics resonate so hard with me. a personal song of the year contender

**bbfan132** (10): love how atmospheric this is, i could listen to it for hours

**cremeebrulee** (10): i rly love this track it’s so hypnotic in a siren sort of way

**ManofOranges** (10): This one is very low key but it's got that hypnotizing quality to it. I adore it.

**Misentro** (10): It's so soft and vulnerable, a real stand-out middle point for the album. The pulsing beat and repeated vocals are hypnotic.

**mudkip1** (10): i'm so glad she put this on the album it's so GOOD ugh I ADORE YOU JESSIE WARE

**proscett** (10): lots of people think this song is the weakest, but it gives me honey by robyn vibes and that's enough for me to love it. it gives me such a unique feeling that i can't even describe

**shockdbinary** (10): after dancing a lot saving kisses, we need to dedicate ourselves to compliments saying i adore you.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this song is so catchy helppppp

**TiltControls** (10): no i adore YOU, the control over this song is perfection

**engifear** (9.5): So sexy

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): Crazy to think this was the lead single, I loved the track when I first heard it but I had no clue how amazing the album was going to be (also I had no clue about the other big thing that was going to happen :) )

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): this is gonna get robbed bc it's softer and slower but it's such a great moment to catch your breath and luxuriate in a Total Vibe

**booksandplantsand** (9): emotionally vulnerable lyrics? in my sultry disco jam?

**lexarqade** (9): Definitely a track that I needed to warm up to, but now I love it.

**nooodisaster** (9): Ughhh, the production here... I will find you Joseph Mount. Like, I will only ask you for lessons once I do, but I will still find you.

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): One of my favourite things about rates is going back to songs I disliked at first and realizing that they were actually really good.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This almost sounds like it could be the background music for a cave level in some game

**Chevsapher** (8.9): This track never stood out to me before, but only because the production is understated compared to the rest of the album. The hooks aren't the best on the album, but they're still quite good. The real meat here is the mellow-yet-dense synthesizer backdrop.

**bulforster** (8.6): For such a chill track there's still a great drive behind this one.

**1998tweety** (8.5): deep sex bop

**conceptualromance** (8.5): this song reminds me of another song but I can’t think of what that song is

**daretheghost** (8.5): I played the hell out of this song when it released so a bit of its charm has worn off on me. I don’t know that it’s totally cohesive in the context of the album but I can forgive it for the audio bliss outro.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This one really surrounds you, I love the way it just bounces around you and grasps at you from all angles

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): This instrumental gives me "2008 YouTube tutorial video with Bandicam watermark and notepad instructions" vibes

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Her voice is what makes this good

**jongin\_is\_shy** (8): Wish it was placed in another spot on the tracklist

**just\_thonking** (8): A bit more low-key than the rest of the album but still great

**KennyEarthman** (8): has an underwater siren vibe

**Leixander** (8): Kills the mood a bit because of its placement in the tracklist, still a lovely song.

**luckyphase** (8): this is actually my first Jessie Ware song so it makes me nostalgic ☺️

**musical\_pyn** (8): great song but compare to the rest of the album not the best

**vayyiqra** (8): I wanna play a beautiful game / Even though we're gonna lose / But I adore you whoops wrong song. Anyway, at this point, this album maybe starts to drop off a tiny bit as it ends its very strong run of songs on side A, but it's still very good.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is actually really rad. Nice and subdued

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I like the production but the lyrics and melody are kind of weak

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.5): I: A Door. You:

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): This is a good break from the upbeat production of the album. This might grow on me with further listens. But for now this is getting my 7.

**Flegasaurus** (7): itá just alright compared to some of the other songs on this album... and all i can think about is the harry styles song of the same name, which i don't like 😭

**frogaranaman** (7): walk thru fire for you, just let me adore you

**Parabox314** (7): It's a cute bop, kind of forgettable at first but warms up as it progresses.

**SmileAndTears** (7): Probably the weakest song here. Not that it's bad but the autotune just doesn't fit the song imo and as a ballad it's pretty boring

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): My least favourite song of the album, which doesn't make it a bad song at all since the other songs are just that amazing. Just not a huge fan of how repetitive it is while staying kind of moody.

#Don't worry, I adore all of you too <3 

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): open the adore to another adore to another adore to another adore

**Stryxen** (6.1): more could have been done but i enjoyed it still

**bespectacIed** (6): album bathroom break but still bops

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the worst song on this album i fear

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's a sleeper for me

**Vromega** (6): The chorus is too repetitive !! However I'm giving some extra points for outstanding vocals compared to the rest of the album.

**jasannn** (5): A decent and necessary slower track but its one of the more boring songs on here.

**lolcevan** (5): would be good if it wasn’t so repetitive, such a waste of potential. she wishes she was carly’s gimmie love

**Brendon-Urine** (4): Too slow of a song to fit in with this album tbh, and not slow in a good way like Spotlight. Just kinda drags.

**seanderlust** (11): WE GOT TOGETHER!!!!!!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): YOU GOT TOGETHER DURING A PARAMEDIC??

**bulforster** (10): This song feels like it's stomping on you repeatedly and I love it.

**proscett** (10): a bona fide banger!! shake your ass or get out

**qazz23** (10): Banger. Don't care how repetitive the lyrics are.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I can unfortunately see this banger going out day 1, but Roisin can really pull off this in-your-face, intense

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): The cowbells (?) are great in this. Even though it’s essentially the same part on loop, it doesn't get boring at all despite its length because I was just so curious about what’s gonna happen next.

**Awkward\_King** (9): im so happy for you

**Exaltatus** (9): This is the part of the sex party where the leather daddy gets his Crisco out.

**musical\_pyn** (9): banger

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9): The backing track on this is FLAWLESS.

**Turpamutteri** (9): Sometimes repetitive lyrics bother me but this is not one of those times

**artzpop** (8.7): yup yup

**bbfan132** (8.5): excellent production but a bit too repetitive

**Chevsapher** (8.5): We love a 90s throwback. It's a great dance track, but it's definitely not is the same league as some of the other songs on the album.

**seeyanever** (8.5): I'm not sure how to describe this sound. Loud? Alarms?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): we really did get together huh

**booksandplantsand** (6): pretty good but I do get bored partway through

**KennyEarthman** (5): it's an interlude that didn't need to be this long, especially since she just repeats the same lyrics

**luckyphase** (5): beats to relax and study to

**Vromega** (4): 1st minute : hmm interesting. 2nd minute uh ? We got together ok I think we understood already, is it all you have to say ? 3rd minute god please end this song already 4th minute ok at this point this is trolling I'm skipping

**TiltControls** (3): did they get together though?

**jayjaysortagay** (1): this is 100 gecs for old ppl (I don't like 100 gecs)

#See you at the sub favs rate! haha!!.. jk.. unless...

**skargardin** (10): Now I'm fuming for real!!!! This is one of my personal favorites on the album and it didn't even make it to top 20?!?! **GROSS!** I honestly think this is a perfect pop song down to the melodies, the pace (the breakdown into the outro like hello??), and overall composition. It's a complete joyride from start to finish that captures the essence of a fun-filled dancefloor banger so perfectly. I really hope this gets the single treatement as I would love to see some visuals and hear potential remixes for it. 

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I never really understood the acclaim this song received. The final chorus is exceptional, but the payoff is barely worth the sloggy two-and-a-half minute journey towards it.

---

#My Dance Floor Darlings

**Exaltatus** (11): The tempo change snapped my head off and I'm not sorry about that.

**hikkaru** (11): when the yass grenade goes off and i pop my yass pills and the tempo changes i go feral

**lagozzino** (11): The tempo shift at the end lifts my soul to heaven

**lolcevan** (11): LOVE LOVE LOVEEE!!!!

**MrSwearword** (11): the absolute crown jewel on this album, as it actually comes the closest of the singles [maybe this is the next single by the time the rate is revealed who knows] to actually channel disco correctly. That aside, I love this song so much.

**rose** (11): pop perfection!!

#Exactly besties

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I love it when she talks because Australian.

**bbfan132** (10): i love when it randomly speeds up towards the end - excellent chorus too

**bulforster** (10): The outro makes me go feral every time.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the tracklist should've been rearranged with this as the closer because this is an EXPERIENCE! the explosion into the outro... one of the best things she's ever done. daft punk retired bc they knew they couldnt top this

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): 11 contender tbh!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I vibe with this one a lot

**KennyEarthman** (10): that ending bops. also it sounds like she's saying Disco Darling

**KuhBus** (10): This album just keeps hitting hard- funk guitar AND rock guitar are a great mix.

**pat-rickstar** (10): If Kylie gets any 11s in this rate they should all be for this song, it deserves

**proscett** (10): GONNA MAKE SURE THAT YOUR BODY WON'T FORGET

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): this one's so cute, pure serotonin!!

**seanderlust** (10): BANGER

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I love the tempo change

**targetguest** (10): Miss Kylie is gonna kill me for spending the 11 somewhere else

**TiltControls** (10): THE. TEMPO. CHANGE.

**Turpamutteri** (10): This makes me wish I was dancing at the club (fuck you covid)

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): Really cute and sparkly throughout, but that up-tempo part at the end is what truly elevates this song!

**conceptualromance** (9.9): not sure if the tempo change at the end really works but I love this song

**Chevsapher** (9.7): The chorus absolutely shimmers, and the tempo change (!) is fabulously bonkers.

**1998tweety** (9.5): excellence

**akanewasright** (9.5): I didn’t care for this song for a while, but now I think it’s really well done. The top line just rides the groove so well. It feels like a Carly song in the same way that Dua’s song Cool does, but Kylie does Carly better than Dua does probably because Kylie was doing Carly music before Carly did Carly music

**daretheghost** (9.5): The tempo switch at the end is me after I’ve had my daily cold brew.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): i believe kylie minogue's moans will one day save the world it’s just not ready to be saved by them

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): the speed up and bass on this one are just pure serotonin

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): I love the track speeding up at the end, give me Daft Punk - Discovery vibes

**booksandplantsand** (9): fairly average of the album UNTIL THE BRIDGE. extremely important moment

**cremeebrulee** (9): this outro goes crazy

**jasannn** (9): This was a big grower.

**Misentro** (9): C'MON TEMPO CHANGE

**Parabox314** (9): The ending takes this up a notch.

**rickikardashian** (9): this is a carly rae jepsen song

**runaway3212** (9): I love daft punk

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9): Most underrated song here and the rate results aren't even up yet. Outro SLAPS.

**wavingwolves** (9): daft punk meets carly rae jepsen

**oscarbrierley1** (8.7): the beginning is a little boring but the end makes up for it

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Finally. I was starting to wonder if this album had any great songs left

**Brendon-Urine** (8): will always support tempo speed ups. ALWAYS.

**jackisboredtoday** (8): the final 45 seconds of this have a wild energy that’s sorely needed on this album. Love this

**jexan13** (8): The hook is so terrible, but everything else is amazing

**Leixander** (8): last minute elevates this song kinda, the first two minutes are very meh

**luckyphase** (8): It’s the breakdown for me

**ManofOranges** (8): The sped up section at the end sends me every time.

**musical\_pyn** (8): I am a sucker for the tempo change at the end

**nooodisaster** (8): "gonna wake up feeling no regrets" NOT me after waking up in the 87th fucked up position this month [the rhythm and production Sky brings is sooo good, and the breakdown is awesome]

**sarcasticsobs** (8): that f*cking pick up

**thedoctordances1940** (8): One of the few highpoints of the final stretch of the main album

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.8): prince vibes

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): I like this one but I feel like this will be eliminated on Day 1 because many will deem it a forgettable filler which it kind of is. I really enjoyed the autotune at the end.

#Evacauate the dancefloor

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.5): I think this will grow on me with further listens.

**geraldinewww** (7.1): i miss chromeo

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Ending more like Daft Punk Darling

**vayyiqra** (7): This was :hanawinsExcite: until it sped up for no reason and Daft Punk started singing which sounds cool in theory but was handled poorly

**Stryxen** (6.5): the bridge made me open my mouth it fucks

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): no thoughts head empty

**Flegasaurus** (4): i don't know how to dance and this album is getting pretty boring

**frogaranaman** (4): I bet that you look good on the dance floor, I don’t know if you’re looking for romance or, I don’t know what you’re looking for

**maxrocks329** (4): I do like the over-the-top vocoder towards the end but that's about it

#I still have no idea what this "squeak noise" is referring to :deadbanana: please elaborate!

**mudkip1** (1): theres a squeak noise in the production that i can't unhear

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Ironically, this song comes right after the considered lackluster by many Kingdom Of Ends. Luckily, Róisín hardly misses from this point onward.

**skargardin** (10): This is another song that sparked a lot of differentiating opinions. Some of yall really wanting something more from this. I love this and especially the lyrics and the imagery it paints but ultimately not too upset at this placement.

---

#Perfect amount tyvm

**maxrocks329** (11): This is the best song I heard in all of 2020. It might be my favorite song of all time. Everything about it is so perfect—the vocals, the instrumental, the lyrics, the way it manages to perfectly capture Gay Yearning™ (the most powerful emotion). The number of times I've listened to this song while staring out into space and hoping for something is honestly kind of concerning considering it only came out a few months ago.

**ACORGIORGY** (10): the piano in the back half of the song sends me

**banananaise** (10): you want a castle deep in Spain and more land than Charlemagne? bitch me too, the fuck?

**conceptualromance** (10): this song is cool as hell. I like the sort of ominous feel of the intro

**cremeebrulee** (10): i know a lot of people don’t have patience for long songs but i’m a big fan of them if they take their time to build/layer which is something this song does perfectly! it’s great to disassociate to honestly

**Flegasaurus** (10): every single song on this album is 11 material i feel bad for the other albums honestly

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): https://media.giphy.com/media/l0IygVj76KkbXiJHy/giphy.gif

**KennyEarthman** (10): I, too, want all the cake

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Great lyrics, fantastic build-up, and all-around just fantastic track

**Leixander** (10): Got a lot better with the album mix.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BANGER [2]

**MrSwearword** (10): this fucking slaps

**musical\_pyn** (10): By far my favorite of the album, such a strong hook and development

**pat-rickstar** (10): The beat change elevates this from a 9 to a 10

**ReallyCreative** (10): absolutely iconic lyrics and vocal harmonies going on here

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Obsessed with these vocals

**waluigiest** (10): love the almost hymnal melody at the start, love the groove she gets into later.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): roisin is such a witty lyricist and i feel like this song really illustrates that. people often get distracted by the production in her songs (in a good way!) that they rarely take the time to hear what she's actually saying

**Chevsapher** (9.5): My favorite tracks on this album are the ones that incorporate pop songwriting structures; this is one of those. I adore how the vocal repetition reinforces the idea of constant wanting. Oh, and can we talk about the moment the piano stabs come in around the 4-minute mark? Wow.

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9.5): Ironic title considering she gave us everything on this song.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): I REALLY liked that shift halfway through, I was worried this was going to be yet another Roisin track that didn't really evolve

**AHSWeeknd** (9): There are no words.

**daretheghost** (9): The switch-up near the end is fab.

**lolcevan** (9): i love the build up here, the piano is so fucking good!!

**Parabox314** (9): When is roisin gonna step off my neck god damn.

**proscett** (9): the piano that comes in at 4 and a half minutes... NUT

**SmileAndTears** (8.7): Perhaps she made some points with this

**artzpop** (8.6): shes a queen

**bbfan132** (8.5): i wish i liked this more but it’s still v good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): it is indeed the first track on RM to leave me wanting something more, still very good

**seanderlust** (8.5): hell of a build, hell of a payoff

**Turpamutteri** (8.5): So ethereal

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**booksandplantsand** (8): so smooth! so fun to sing along!

**just\_thonking** (8): I like the spooky piano line in the background throughout the song

**ManofOranges** (8): I was wanting something more with this song and then around like 2 minutes from the end it really picked up and I was blown away

**nooodisaster** (8): Lyrically immaculate.

**qazz23** (8): Overstays its welcome a bit, weakest of the 3 long openers

**targetguest** (8): have already revisited several times since learning of it today

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): when the beat to this kicked in my ass started a tentative quake-like gesture… didn’t really progress much beyond that but that’s worth something I guess?

**pheromenos** (7.5): sorry róisín

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): This instrumental would fit perfectly on What's Your Pleasure

**buddhacharm** (7): This is the only song on the album where I feel like it could've/should've been truncated a little. It meanders for a little too long and the tempo is a little too lethargic and plodding for me. I get the theory behind it — it's supposed to heighten the tension for the album — but the payoff is a little less than I wanted

**frogaranaman** (7): just something I can turn to, somebody I can kiss, I want something just like this

**ignitethephoenix** (7): nice but kind of boring compared to the other songs

#I do, in fact, want something more

**wavingwolves** (7.3): i guess you could say i wanted something more out of this... but it's still good

**Stryxen** (7): spill me too

**runaway3212** (6.7): a bit repititive

**bulforster** (5.2): What I want from this song is...

**Brendon-Urine** (5): some of the vocal harmonies are nice and I like the piano on the second half buuuuuut that's about it

**JackStrait** (5): Very cool harmonies, but I'm getting the sense that this album has a lot of repetitive lines. It leaves me wanting... something more?

**mudkip1** (5): it's pretty but i unfortunately was wanting something more

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): This song just never fails to get this dumptruck body doing the most awkward dance moves imaginable while screaming along to the infectious hook.

**skargardin** (7): This is by far my least favorite song on the album and I'm a bit surprised that it made it all the way to top 20. If I had my way I would swap this with Adore You's placement. But on an album with so many excellent songs this is not the worst of duds to have, is it?

#Don't stop

**jackisboredtoday** (11): LOVE this, the song that made me get into Jessie at the end of 2019, and one of the best tracks of the last few years

**booksandplantsand** (10): truly a song to crash your car to

**engifear** (10): So sexy

**frogaranaman** (10): ‘til you get enough, keep up with the force don’t, don’t stop ‘til you get enough

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): that opening lyric into the pulsing beat is just NOT FAIR, it’s dirty radiation that makes all my hair fall out

**jexan13** (10): the chorus is cocaine

**Leixander** (10): the absolute ENERGY in this song

**Misentro** (10): Jessie is still serving time in horny jail for this one

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is gonna be so robbed

**proscett** (10): my average is going to be so high for this album, it's ridiculous... i adore this song though, the biggest banger on here

**Stryxen** (10): DONT STOP MOVING TOGETHER

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): she said "yes i fuck"

**geraldinewww** (9.9): i always forget i love this one until the pre-chorus/chorus kicks in and i lose it

**plastichaxan** (9.8): love when rates make me realize how much i underrate certain songs and make me listen to them more yass

**1998tweety** (9.5): i wanna have sex :/

**bbfan132** (9): love when the guy comes in, the chorus is very catchy/fun

**LuisEnRod** (9): this song deserves to be too 10 at least

**nooodisaster** (9): "Last night we dance and I thought you were saving my life" is the over-the-top lyrics I demand in every pop song. I always forget about this song and then I get the pleasure of falling in love all over again. It's hooky. It's classy. It's funky. It doesn't have the word 'mirage' in it which is probably why I forget what it sounds like.

**runaway3212** (9): Very nice

**Vromega** (9): love this vibe and dreamy atmosphere. That's a song I expected much earlier on this album and I wanted to have more I would say

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): This is so dreamy and funky at the same time!

**Chevsapher** (8.8): Yet another great dance track. It feels a little too long, but maybe Lil Nas X is just killing my attention span.

**EnCaine** (8.5): DONT STOP MOVIN TOGETHER DONT STOP MOVIN TOGETHER AAaAAAA

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Love this bass on this one

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Four on the floor, hiccuping bass, don't stoppp

**musical\_pyn** (8): very smooth and nice

**Parabox314** (8): Ooh love when that chorus kicks in. The rest is kind of a blur.

**qazz23** (8): Weakest of the album, just feels too long

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this song is nostalgic in a way I can’t explain

**Turpamutteri** (8): This is the weakest song on the album for me but it's still gorgeous

**vayyiqra** (8): Don't you stop, I know you won't / 'Cause I'm gonna make you keep on moving / I dress up to dress you down / And I'm gonna keep the rhythm grooving (Don't stop) whoops wrong song

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): Ok this sounds so much like that Micheal Jackson song (I think) that Rihanna sampled, it's kinda uncanny

**wavingwolves** (7.8): a song about mariah omfggg

**conceptualromance** (7.5): just a bit too same-y to receive a higher score for me

**daretheghost** (7.5): Overtime deserved this spot on the album. Feels like it goes on a little too long, which is a bit ironic for something flirting with disco.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s fine but it’s filler

**jasannn** (7.5): DON'T STOP!!

**lolcevan** (7.5): i have no idea if anyone will understand this reference but this song (the intro specifically) reminds me so much of the music in splatoon 2’s octo expansion. miss deadf1sh served here

**AHSWeeknd** (7): filler track but a glam✨ filler track

**Alumineous** (7): When the HUH comes up, I think of Street Fighter. And I have never played Street Fighter.

**Awkward\_King** (7): mirage simpson

**maxrocks329** (7): The way it gets more and more frantic as it gets closer to the end is really cool

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's a little annoying not going to lie, I kind of wish it went in a different direction

**shesdoingyoga** (7): The weakest and most forgettable song on the album for me, but like still not bad

#Do stop

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): Can't say I really care for this but it's still got its qualities

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): I think this is easily my least liked song off the album. Even after almost a year, it still hasn’t grown on me.

**cremeebrulee** (6): its drags a bit

**KennyEarthman** (6): it gets kinda repetitive by the end

**MrSwearword** (6): at least Jessie FINALLY tried something different but due to her limited range and vocal expression, she makes this one feel like a waste too

**ManofOranges** (3): Actually please do stop

#Extinct besties

**booksandplantsand** (9): totally new song but very good!

**cremeebrulee** (9): ok i’m listening ..

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Trap!

**Stryxen** (8.5): the way this would go off in any social situation and i’m just in my bed on my laptop :despair:

**ACORGIORGY** (8): the ghost of Patrick Cowley lives in the intro to this track

**Chevsapher** (8): It's a tight, fun, retro-inspired dance track, but it's not “Save a Kiss.” Sure, it samples a few words, but does that really count?

**ReallyCreative** (8): really good, but not the What's Your Pleasure? Georgia Remix

**daretheghost** (7): I can dig the Moroder-style bass but this otherwise doesn’t do a lot for me.

**KennyEarthman** (7): at least it's a remix that actually changes the song

**Leixander** (7): love their name

**musical\_pyn** (7): the song opening up in the middle gives it some more points

**wavingwolves** (7): outsold the other remixes just for the name alone it's true it's true

#Respect your elders

**bbfan132** (6.5): this didn’t feel like much of anything but it sounded pretty good

**AHSWeeknd** (6): imagine a raptor producing this

**engifear** (6): This feels fairly generic, but I would listen to it among other songs on a study playlist

**Exaltatus** (6): It's a miss for me.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (6): Okay but lowkey abolish remixes that only repeat the chorus

**bespectacIed** (3): it's too busy

**maxrocks329** (3): I'm not saying it's bad but it is really not my kind of thing

**Parabox314** (3): This takes most of the stuff I like about the song and strips it away.

**lolcevan** (1): not my thing and gave me a headache. had to skip lol

#And what about it

**jasannn** (4): this isn't Blessed Madonna??

#PLS


**LazyDayLullaby** (4): Dinosaurs probably went extinct waiting for this remix to end

**skargardin** (10): This is another personal favorite of mine on the album (but to be honest I've got a lot of favorites here :deadbanana:). I think this would be the perfect fit for a Bond soundtrack and I'm glad to see that many of you share that sentiment. It's so insanely cinematic with the strings and Jessie's vocal performance. I could picture a performance backed up with a whole orchestra in a threatre to this.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): What's Your Pleasure? has other slow songs I like more, like Save A Kiss and The Kill. Jessie's pretty vocal passages in the pre-choruses and the whispery hooks prevent this song from being a non-event.

---

# Stream your preferred In Your Eyes version

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The Weeknd WHOMST?!?

**cremeebrulee** (10): every song called in your eyes legally has to be a smash i guess

**Gonza\_90** (10): She did it even better than The Weeknd

**ReallyCreative** (10): it's been a great year for songs with this title, and this one is arguably the best on its album

**runaway3212** (10): outsold the weeknd but only by a little bit

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Almost as good as the Weeknd's one

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): The Weeknd >, but still a bop

**Parabox314** (8): Weeknd outsold but this also goes hard. But keep going! <3

**wavingwolves** (7.7): something something the weeknd

**hikkaru** (7.5): the weeknd washed a bit i fear

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): The Weeknd outsold I fear

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): i hate to say it, but Abel and Doja kinda outsold for a reason here

**frogaranaman** (5): I see there’s somethin’ burnin’ inside you, inside you~

#It's the fact that no one mentioned the masterpiece of [Kylie's In Your Eyes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OjETibEMbJY) by name when she is literally in this rate for me

**ManofOranges** (10): There's sumn special about naming a song "In Your Eyes" because between this song and the Weeknd song I am living

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Comment mentioning The Weeknd

**Flegasaurus** (8): songs named in your eyes are always bangers

#I just keep on dancing in your eyes

**Alumineous** (10): The juxtaposition of the strings and Jessie's heavenly head voice, with the beat that resembles a somewhat anxious heart. Strings indicate that morning is coming, but things are still uncertain. Will they stay with her after the night ends? I just have to note: the way she synchronized with the string's note in the bridge was angelic. It was notable because the pervasive beat in the background disappeared. For a moment, her heart stopped, her anxieties gone. She was truly lost in their eyes.

**bbfan132** (10): this is the most sensual song i’ve heard, i get totally lost in it when i hear it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the drama in this is amazing, it's like soaking in a bath of champagne

**daretheghost** (10): Sexy sexy sexy.

**EnCaine** (10): the chorus on this song is bone-chilling every. single. time.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): This song is so sexy it makes me feel so naughty https://media.tenor.com/images/60a9eb4b6789b11b49539efd987333b6/tenor.gif

**Leixander** (10): stunningly beautiful

**Misentro** (10): Nu-Bond theme

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song is sex

**qazz23** (10): I like how more harmonies are added in the second half

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This has such a sleek film noir allure, like disco Portishead

**Stryxen** (10): when i hear this song i’m walking through the city at night

**Turpamutteri** (10): What I learned in 2020 is that if your song is called "In Your Eyes" it's going to be amazing (looking at you Jessie and Abel)

**Chevsapher** (9.8): The more I listen to this album, the more I love this track. The dark soundscape, the string arrangement, and the lush vocals work together to create an emotional journey.

**engifear** (9.5): So sexy

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): This song is so sensual and sexually charged.

**akanewasright** (9): Every time I hear this, I fall more and more in love with it. The strength of the album, in my opinion, is less in ability to make you dance than its ability to hypnotize and transport you to a world of Moroder-esque synths and pure pleasure, and this song, the first I heard off the album, exemplifies that best.

**bespectacIed** (9): 2020 really gave us two excellent in your eyes-es wow

**lolcevan** (9): this song makes me levitate

**seanderlust** (9): it feels steamy and sensual but also dark

**Vromega** (9): This song is very satisfying to listen to. It hugs me, it tells me a story. Beautifully written and produced.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): jessie ware hates blind people omg

**nooodisaster** (8.5): This was the first song made for the album, and listening to it, it feels the most intimate and personal to me still. The vocals and production are just heavenly here, they float through the darkness of this song perfectly. I know popheads doesn't like ballads, but y'all gotta at least like this one.

**pros-and-connors** (8.5): Give Jessie Ware a Bond theme already you cowards

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): So stunning and sensual, not my absolute fave compared to other songs on the album but still great!

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**geraldinewww** (8): this makes me want to play a 90s low polygon point and click murder mystery game

**lexarqade** (8): Loooooove how floaty this makes me feel.

**vayyiqra** (8): This rather sounds a lot like Jessy Lanza, who is like Jessie Ware but Canadian and much less popular, but just as good.

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): bop but compared to the other songs on the album it's just ok

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.4): Disco-Slo-Jam

#I pretend I do not see

**jasannn** (7): Kind of a snoozer but it makes up for being one of the sexiest songs on here.

**KennyEarthman** (7): feels a little blended with the previous tracks but I still love the vibe it gives

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this song is good but i don’t really have any strong feelings on it

**MrSwearword** (7): the exact same fucking thing comes up here too. Let me just say it now, the production was wasted on such a boring vocalist, I CAN'T.

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): I love the violins or whatever string instrument is in the background. The song is kinda boring though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): This is kinda boring compared to the rest of the album, it’s not even bad but it is the one that has me reaching for the skip button unless I’m like fully immersed in the experience.

**proscett** (6): this song is decent but ultimately a bit boring. the kill did it better

**sirpancakeXI** (6): definitely a underwhelming track, i'm looking for something more memorable but it didnt deliver

**booksandplantsand** (5): well-done. doesn't necessarily hook me

**conceptualromance** (5): it’s certainly on the album!

**maxrocks329** (5): I always forget about this song until it starts playing, and then I immediately forget it again afterwards

**skargardin** (10): It was love at first listen for me omg.. This is the first of DISCO's proper singles to get cut. Real Groove has post-album release been released in many renditions, and I honestly think that the Initial Talk remix of this is the absolute best version, but this is no less of a ten for that! This absolutely slaps and is such a fun time. This had such a wild ride during the rate process, and it was even Day 1 at a couple of points, honestly wtf? Another robbery among the many Kylie robberies so far. UGH!

#you misspelled excellent i fear

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): A really odd post-album single choice.

---

#We've got something better, that REAL GROOVE BAYBEEHH!!

**1998tweety** (11): i know it gets a little repetitive but whew the chorus on the song is such a groove. I had to take it off of my evening walk playlist cause the line "bump in the night" kept reminding me of that Korean horror jumpscare webcomic and i was getting scared.

**AHSWeeknd** (11): They got that real groove, which is difficult to get… Not everybody has that.

**plastichaxan** (11): this 3-track run, Kylie’s mind to start off the album

**Brendon-Urine** (10): this was almost my 11, like this song is actually so addictive. the hook is just sublime I can't get over it.

**conceptualromance** (10): I’m pretty sure they play this at my local target 24/7 but it’s still a banger so

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a bop, why lie

**Misentro** (10): "Sure, she's hot, but can she dance?"

**Parabox314** (10): BOP ALERT. This took some time to develop for me but the more I listen the more I love it.

**qazz23** (10): Good run of tracks so far

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is like a sister song to Really Don't Like U with Tove Lo, both 10s

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I love the way she says “baby” on this

**Turpamutteri** (10): I could listen to this all day every day

**Vromega** (10): By far my fave on this album. I love the way this song is constructed. The instruments and Kylie's voice are shining. I can see their smile recording this song.

**daretheghost** (9.5): One of my favorites on this album.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.1): it's early morning and my brain is dying on me to keep churning out comments but it lives up to its name

**\_SoulGlitch** (9): This song is… really groovy. I’m sorry, I’ll let myself out.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is fine but also does too much at parts

**maxrocks329** (9): This is the kind of unrequited love bop I used to think only CRJ could make, but I guess I was wrong

**seanderlust** (9): this sounds like one of the better tracks from future nostalgia

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9): Got those real scrobbles baebayyehh

**waluigiest** (9): that drop is TASTY

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Kylie is soooo good at making mid-tempo songs that are still really groovy

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.7): this song is for you, you know who you are <3

**akanewasright** (8.5): this has shrunk on me overtime, but I think that’s mostly from overplay. It’s got such a nice hook on it.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): i hate to be THAT gay™,,,,, but the dua lipa remix? nut

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.4): This is, indeed, a real groove

**SmileAndTears** (8.2): They play this more often than Shawn Mendes songs where I work (not complaining, just a fun fact)

**bbfan132** (8): super catchy song, i wish the bridge was a bit more developed but i still liked it quite a bit

**engifear** (8): Bop

**Exaltatus** (8): I don't really care for the robotic voice bits but it's still a damn good song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Taking forty seconds to reach the chorus… bold move in the streaming era Kylie. Anyways this do be slapping just a little

**KennyEarthman** (8): that melody feels so familiar

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this is bopping actually

**mudkip1** (8): groovy

**nooodisaster** (8): she may be hot, but can she DAP??

**wavingwolves** (8): vocoder made points yas

**Stryxen** (7.8): i really cannot decide if i like the hook or not lol

**pietrohonkhonk** (7.5): The chorus is good but the rest is just ok

**geraldinewww** (7.4): that bass is really good and that alone made me raise my initial ranking from 6.9

**bespectacIed** (7): mom can we have break my heart we have break my heart at home the break my heart in question

**booksandplantsand** (7): kinda don't like the verses but the chorus saves it

**luckyphase** (7): this song is groovy but there is a time and place

#Real Groove has left the chat

**Flegasaurus** (6): this is alright

**kirby31200** (6): This album loves wacky vocal effects and this song has the worst of them

**Leixander** (6): This has potential but ends up going nowhere.

**ReallyCreative** (6): a little obnoxious, the remixes really reign this one in

**MrSwearword** (5): confession, I fucking detest this song's title and chorus. Aside from that...I did mention that a remix was better than the song and honestly, that's tea. Not the Dua for a few seconds adding nothing to it, one of the other ones.

**proscett** (5): rather boring in my opinion

**runaway3212** (5): This is a bit too jealous for me

#Du-du-du-du-DUA'S GOT THAT REAL GROOVE WOO WOO

**Chevsapher** (9.6): It's strange to listen to the original again after spending so much time with the Studio 2054 mixes. I wish the bridge was longer, but that's a minor complaint about what is probably the catchiest song in this rate.

**hikkaru** (9.5): initial talk remix outsold a bit i fear but it still bops

**jasannn** (9.5): It's missing a little oomph that the Studio 2054 remix gave it but this song is still super fun and one of the best songs on the album.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): Initial Talk Remix > all other music

**musical\_pyn** (8): this already sounds like a dua lipa song without the remix

**sirpancakeXI** (8): the initial talk remix really make me enjoy the original version less and less, but it is still a cute song.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): I honestly prefer the Studio 2054 remix but not because of Dua, she is unnecessary, I prefer the bridge and Kylie's vocals in that version

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): The perfection of the remix ruined the original for me.

**CreepyMannequin** (6): Underwhelming compared to the Initial Talk remix of the Studio 2054 version

**lolcevan** (6): dua remix ended her with ease

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I was going to make a comment about how reading one's lips is impossible during the pandemic, but I figured most of you are going to do it better than me.

**skargardin** (8): This is another What's Your Pleasure? cut that I think should've went sooner consider what we've cut already. I like it still but there's something about the kiss smacks in the chorus that I think drags my enjoyment of it down a bit. Still cute but yeah I'm not mad at this placement!

---

#👁️👄👁️

**Roxieloxie** (11): I actually dont know how popular anything in this rate is so this very well could be like a 'me giving my 11 to a day 1 cut' situation idk, this is a banger I like it so im giving it my 11

**1998tweety** (10): oh my lorde that beat is incredible, inject it into me

**Awkward\_King** (10): jessie ware loves deaf people omg

**bespectacIed** (10): sexy

**Exaltatus** (10): Read my lips, every second of this song is perfection.

**frogaranaman** (10): inclusive queen

**KennyEarthman** (10): what kind of lips is she talking about

**Leixander** (10): mmm the production in this just makes me want to listen to it on repeat till the end of time

**qazz23** (10): Simple, direct, and funky.

**shockdbinary** (10): she was so smart about using kiss sounds on this one.

**Stryxen** (10): thee funkiest song of 2020, i forgot just how good this is and immediately added it to a playlist as soon as it started

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): girl it was camp

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): bop!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): banger omg

**plastichaxan** (9.5): what a vibe

**bbfan132** (9): :puggodance: love the bass

**booksandplantsand** (9): the beginning laugh, the kissy lips, the whispers, oh my god

**Chevsapher** (9): The Madonna influence is insanely strong here. The melodies are catchy, and the production is deliciously punchy. I just wish there was more variation in the bassline, or that the production built more toward the end.

**engifear** (9): So sexy

**nooodisaster** (9): This is so bratty I just love every second of it. The lyrics could be seen as buying into the "Blurred lines" discourse, which is fair, verbal consent is super important.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I’ve definitely been sleeping on this song

**vayyiqra** (9): no interesting comment just a bop okay

**\_SoulGlitch** (8.5): I initially didn’t like it but it has really grown on me. I love how seductive it sounds - but not in an alluring or sexy way but rather in a playful, coy and teasing way. This one’s definitely a grower.

**pietrohonkhonk** (8.5): An underrated bop

**pros-and-connors** (8.5): This song feels like if Prince made a disco song, and I’m not mad at it

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I love this one but it just doesn't seem to have a pivotal moment like so many songs on this album does

**EnCaine** (8.3): you know you're doing something right when soul control read my lips is one of the lesser songs on your album holy shit

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.2): This is the part of the album where things really start2to pick up again, lovely stuff

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I know it’s her style of singing but the vocals could’ve been a little louder

**cremeebrulee** (8): not those kissy noises girl ……

**daretheghost** (8): Another song that feels like filler on an otherwise stellar album.

**KuhBus** (8): Funky guitar makes my head go brrr.

**Misentro** (8): 👁💋👁 Mwah

**MrSwearword** (8): this is like if Prince made another tacky nasty girl group or if Sheena Easton could get a third hit in the U.S. but WHY IS FIRE PRODUCTION WASTED ON JESSIE'S INFLEXIBLE VOCALS

**musical\_pyn** (8): one of my favorite bridges on the album

**Parabox314** (8): Is it just me or does she reference eyes a lot? Great song though.

**targetguest** (8): the laugh at the beginning gives me hot anime female villain vibes

**wavingwolves** (8): tbh 7.4 out of 8 of these points are just for the sound effects

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): Compared to other songs this lacks just a tiny bit, but it's still good for variation :)

#No thank you <3

**jasannn** (7.8): Basically an inferior version of Ooh La La but luckily I love that song.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.7): The way I hear the kissing noises from my left to right headphones...I love this detail of the production!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): https://i.imgur.com/tTlJdQd.gif

**akanewasright** (7): I didn’t love this song until I was talking to a friend who loved it, and he called it a big “uwu” song. Tbh I think I get that.

**maxrocks329** (7): The vocals and instrumental work really well together here, I love the three synths punctuating every line in the verses

**runaway3212** (7): This begins really good but goes on a bit too long

**conceptualromance** (6): one of the weaker songs on this album. Feels very H&M soundtrack. The outro slaps though

**jongin\_is\_shy** (6): HATE the lips sound

**ManofOranges** (5): I will not <3

**pat-rickstar** (5): This is my least favourite on the album mostly because it doesn’t feel very fresh or interesting at this point in the tracklist, it's just a worse version of some of the previous songs

**Vromega** (5): kinda boring

**proscett** (4): i really dislike this song for whatever reason, it's always been my least fave on this.

**bulforster** (3.5): The only bad song on an amazing album, the production here is so weak compared to how lush everything else on the album is.

#Fellow magician besties

**Exaltatus** (10): I fucking love Purple Disco Machine. It's disco-ception.

**seanderlust** (10): i'm a sucker for a house piano

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): this is a drastic improvement on the original

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Purple Disco Machine made magic with this

**musical\_pyn** (8): definitely more disco tbh but i do not like it as much

**wavingwolves** (8): :purplecherry:

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): I hope the remix a Florence song, so it'd be Florence and the Machine and the Purple Disco Machine

**Chevsapher** (7.4): I love the instrumentation, but the structuring feels undercooked.

**bbfan132** (7): fun enough but not totally remarkable

**daretheghost** (7): Could really use something to spice it up a bit.

**KennyEarthman** (7): this is just a disco remix I'd bop to somewhere else, the original is still immaculate

#smoke and mirrors

**Leixander** (6): feels like something I would hear at midnight on a radio station. I'd curse them for not playing the original

**Brendon-Urine** (5): doesn't really change all that much which is fine, but would so much rather listen to the original obviously

**lolcevan** (5): this adds nothing to the song but it’s nice i suppose. i like the drop

**maxrocks329** (5): Just a more boring version of the original

**Stryxen** (4): this feels emptier but its not that bad

**booksandplantsand** (3): feels too tinny and basic

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The polishing production touches on the album edit of Incapable don't fully compensate for it being a little bit too short! It feels like it ends too quickly, even though it can be attributed to me being too used to the extended mix.

**skargardin** (9): : I love this song in any mix but honestly if there was a Róisín Machine song that needed a couple extra minutes of breathing room, this is the one. It feels a bit too short and could do with some added instrumental sections. I would've gladly cut a minute from Something More in favour of this. But that is like the only complaint I have on this entire album. If you liked it then I fully encourage you to listen to the extended mix as it reaches it full potential with it.

---

#Very much capable

**bbfan132** (10): i love the swelling synths in the middle, i feel like i’m drifting away from a shore in outer space

**buddhacharm** (10): Another moment most pleasing to me in my career! This song is irresistible and sexy but also packs a punch — few songs on the album operate that way (and that's a plus I think)

**jexan13** (10): Perfection

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): The production is fabulous, especially the way the reverb builds and fades, and the rhythm of the bassline, and the Nu-Disco instrumentation, and the handclaps, and everything else...!!!

**Leixander** (10): aromantic anthem

**maxrocks329** (10): I love songs exposing my deepest insecurities that are also really good to dance to

**mudkip1** (10): LEGENDARY

**oscarbrierley1** (10): this would be my second pick for 11, the lyrics maybe hit a little too close to home

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I can’t unhear 19-2000 by Gorillaz but anyways, this hits. A turning point in the story of the album that sets up the following tracks where she finds out she IS capable of heartbreak

**TiltControls** (10): the 11 of the album

**waluigiest** (10): her voice is effortlessly gorgeous here. I’m hypnotized. And the industrial sounds in the lasts minute?? Incredible.

**Flegasaurus** (9.7): you know you made the album of the year when the worst song on your album is a 9.7... would be a 10 if it was the extended mix

**bulforster** (9.6): We should've rated the extended mix because this deserves 8 minutes, not 4.

**Chevsapher** (9.5): I didn't think I liked this album when it came out. A few months later, I heard this song and changed my mind. The chorus is so catchy, and I love the static-y noise in the background that slowly washes in and out.

**daretheghost** (9.5): Anthem for the emotionally distant.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): this beat is so good

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9.5): I'm incapable of not bopping my a*s to this.

**1998tweety** (9): im grooving

**booksandplantsand** (9): love her voice in this

**Exaltatus** (9): Extended version is superior, I never get tired of that beat.

**proscett** (9): the most relatable song in this rate

**seanderlust** (9): roisin: do I keep my romantic interests at too far of a romantic distance to make me incapable of truly knowing what it means to love someone? me: https://imgur.com/gallery/VgNKXQ0

**Stryxen** (9): me lol

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.5): might be the only song that i feel gets a bit hamstrung by its album edit because the original extended version is sooooo great, but it's strong enough to still be very good

**conceptualromance** (8.5): the annoying sound at the end >>>>>>>

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Mood

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Haven’t got a ten to give

**frogaranaman** (8): incapable of makin’ alright decisions and having bad ideas

**KennyEarthman** (8): ok wow I unexpectedly related to this song

**ReallyCreative** (8): probably the weakest track on the album but its still good, just a little uneventful for me

**wavingwolves** (8): i wish i could experience this song as it was meant to be: in hot club

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): Very nice and smooth

**nooodisaster** (7.5): "I've never had my heart broken" CANNOT fucking relate

#pensive

**musical\_pyn** (7): I wish this was longer

**Parabox314** (7): Cute but doesn't leave an immediate impression on me tbh.

**ManofOranges** (6): Me doing anything

**MrSwearword** (6): feels like a letdown after the previous track but I could use it in the future.

**vayyiqra** (6): The longer this goes on the less capable I feel of finishing it

#I'm sorry but the juxtaposition of the comment and the score made me scream

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It was a brilliant move to re-use Murphy's Law signature first line on the intro to the whole album.

**skargardin** (10): It had a good run but sadly this is how it ends. This came close to Day 3 on several occasions and actually managed to stay there for a while before retreating, sad! I really love this as an intro, a fantastic moodsetter. But this is also the part of the rate where we have to start make some really painful cuts. All I can say is that it gets worse from here!

#This IS a simulation

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE REPETITIVE LYRICS ARE SO DISCO I LOVE IT

**Awkward\_King** (10): one of the goddamn grandest most ehteral transportive album openers ever and i adore it

**bbfan132** (10): heavenly intro, i’m still transcending

**booksandplantsand** (10): absolutely unreal track to start us off

**bulforster** (10): based and róisínpilled

**conceptualromance** (10): Róisín is probably the only person who could make a convincing argument for the world being a simulation

**cremeebrulee** (10): me watching the elon/grimes/az**lia drama unfold

**engifear** (10): Fuck you engie

**Exaltatus** (10): Róisín Machine is to What's Your Pleasure as What's Your Pleasure is to DISCO and I'm not afraid to say it.

**Flegasaurus** (10): we are starting off with an AMAZING BANGER yep yep

**frogaranaman** (10): ‘cause I keep moving, I keep moving, I keep moving, stuck in a simulation

**jongin\_is\_shy** (10): Who knew music can make you feel like this,

**LazyDayLullaby** (10): Sets up the off-kilter but oft-killer vibe of the album. Love the lyrics and delivery, too!

**Leixander** (10): the intro is heavenly, THIS is how you start an album.

**LuisEnRod** (10): really comtemplated giving this song my 11. It’s eight and a half minutes long and it’s basically the same beat over and over yet i don’t seem to get bored of it when I listen to it? How did she do it? It’s sorcery!

**Misentro** (10): You can physically feel it pulling you into the album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): BANGER

**MrSwearword** (10): for the sheer audacity of having an eight minute opening track and it being fire.

**mudkip1** (10): THIS IS FUDKING AMAZING

**musical\_pyn** (10): all three of these albums have incredible openers—also, the way this song incorporates so many other aspects of the album? genius

**Parabox314** (10): Starts at a 10 and never lets go. 8 minutes of gorgeousness.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I want to live in this simulation, somehow sounds fresher now than when it was released

**sarcasticsobs** (10): e u p h o r i a

**seanderlust** (10): the LAST BIT. i am levitating

**sirpancakeXI** (10): If pophead tank this song because it is 8 minutes long. I WILL personally start a riot. long song phobia is not allowed.

**pat-rickstar** (9.7): Praying that popheads manages to develop an attention span for this one

**geraldinewww** (9.5): absolute power move to start your album with an 8+ minute track. nothing but respect for you róisín

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9.5): House at its sexiest.

**Turpamutteri** (9.5): A fantastic opener to the album

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): my sims gaining self-awareness

**1998tweety** (9): why did Indieheads drag us for not liking long songs when this is 8 and a half minutes long.

**banananaise** (9): absolutely fuck it up miss róisin, make that 8-and-a-half minute long song

**bespectacIed** (9): stun

**Chevsapher** (9): Long electronic tracks often feel repetitive, but not this one. The varied vocal melodies keep the song interesting, and the intro does a great job setting the tone for the album.

**corrodedbeauty** (9): perfect for background music at a strip club

**daretheghost** (9): You KNOW this is going to be a serve within the first 20 seconds.

**ManofOranges** (9): Finally an 8 minute track that I can get behind.

**maxrocks329** (9): Somehow I wish this song was longer even though it's 8 minutes long already. I usually don't get the appeal of those one hour loops on youtube but I'd listen to one for this

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): Me when asked what we live in

**qazz23** (9): A good opener, but a bit long

**waluigiest** (9): this just reminds me how much I miss dancing :/

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): Those breathing noises... that's hot

**EnCaine** (8.8): this do be a simulation! scared this is gonna do badly because of the length, i was scarred by the results of the indieheads crossover rate but i think most people doing this one will be tasteful

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is horny but also a vibe

**lolcevan** (8): i think it’s a simulation guys

**nooodisaster** (8): me during a disassociation episode :kappa:

**proscett** (8): after listening to some of kylie's deluxe tracks, this is some much-needed ear bleach

**runaway3212** (8): play the entirity of the matrix after this

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I came into this rate fully expecting to give this my first 0 in seven rates, but I didn’t absolutely hate it like I did when I first listened to the album so I have no idea what changed

**slimboyfriend** (8): If I rated this stoned.....

**vayyiqra** (8): haha insert funny meme about how we live in a simulation

**hikkaru** (7.5): it IS a simulation… wow cry gif…

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): honestly the only one of the 6+ minute songs here that feels like it fully justifies its length, but this is good

**ACORGIORGY** (7): I feel like I’m being hypnotized, and honestly, who doesn’t love free therapy?

**jasannn** (7): I like the build up but it really could've been 5 or 6 minutes.

**KennyEarthman** (7): it's like an intro to me, so this definitely didn't need to be as long as this is imo

**wavingwolves** (7): the intro is soooooooo good it makes the whole song tbh

#We live in a simulation

**targetguest** (6.5): perfect for hiking it up to 95 mph and shedding some time from your google maps ETA

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’m sorry but this didn’t need to be eight and a half minutes. I listened to it several times and when writing up these scores I just clicked around the song to refresh my memory of it and every spot I clicked sounded the same.

**rickikardashian** (6): :waiting:

**AGM301** (5.5): sorry but it's too long and the vocals are drowned out which i don't like

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): This truly is disco, in the sense that it's far longer than it needs to be, and doesn't do anything particularly interesting to justify it’s runtime

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (5): This intro is a bit too long for me especially for an artist I am not familiar with. I am so sorry Róisín stans. 😭

**luckyphase** (5): sorry but this song makes me stop paying attention it

**TiltControls** (5): drags on a little too long

**Stryxen** (4.5): I wish it was longer so something could happen

**JackStrait** (3.5): I see where she's trying to go with this more cerebral take on disco, but at least on this song, it doesn't quite pan out for me.

#Suddenly I get flashbacks to Donna Summer's Love To Love You Baby robbery

**KuhBus** (0): personally not a fan of breathing/moaning ASMR- makes me personally uncomfortable and sadly ruins the song for me.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The real opening track on the album. Kylie's inviting us to her kitchen disco and it's impossible to refuse her offer.

**skargardin** (9): The little album cut that could OMG!! I'm super happy with how relatively far this made it. On second read through of my score I definitely should've given this a full 10 but I promised myself I wouldn't go back and change them so it is what it is. The intro where she goes "Dance..." is one of the most blissful moments of the entire album for me. I find this song really irresistable in its charm and how glittery and cute it sounds. Again, really happy with how far it made it in the rate!

---

#idk who miss A thing is but we have to stan

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ms. A? Thing!

**cremeebrulee** (10): people misreading this as Ms. A Thing is so funny

**lexarqade** (9): Please welcome to the stage

**wavingwolves** (9): more like miss A+ thing am i right ladies

**Stryxen** (8): wonder what happened to Mr. A Thing

#Don't wanna miss a single second of this song

**artzpop** (11): has not aged a single day and we love her for it

**ACORGIORGY** (10): the cadence of this song is chef’s kiss

**AGM301** (10): LOVE IT

**Alumineous** (10): Easily the best track on this very mediocre record by Kylie Minogue.

**booksandplantsand** (10): the fading in synth that breaks through when Kylie starts singing, goosebumps. perfect song

**Exaltatus** (10): I'm gonna be giving DISCO a lot of 10s huh...

**KuhBus** (10): Incredibly fun!!

**ManofOranges** (10): Outsold Aerosmith

**Misentro** (10): If your song opens with "Dance!", it's a good song. I don't make the rules. The chorus is so slick!

**MrSwearword** (10): this came so close to being my top top scorer, but goddamn what a song

**mudkip1** (10): vibe

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): absolutely amazing

**ReallyCreative** (10): this really deserved the single treatment yup

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Outsold Aerosmith, I fear… it’s catchy, seductive and an 11 contender that IMO stands up to the best of her career

**seanderlust** (10): the echo on "girl" in the first verse...the instrumental as if "instant crush" by daft punk went more 70s...miss thing snapped here

**Chevsapher** (9.9): A disco masterclass. The airy vocals, sleak bassline, and lush production can make it easy to overlook that the song itself is incredibly well-structured, with a strong hook and that chant-like bridge.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): there's something about her voice her that sounds soooo silky and i love it

**1998tweety** (9): soft sex jam

**bbfan132** (9): i don’t wanna miss a thing, don’t wanna miss a thiiiiiiiiing :daisybop:

**jasannn** (9): DANCE!!!!!

**luckyphase** (9): ok hatsune miku!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): underrated

**musical\_pyn** (9): the beat dropping out on the second verse might be the best moment on the album

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the strings really make this song, could maybe be like 20 seconds shorter

**WillamThunderfuck** (9): I love any Kylie song in which she exudes sensuality, so I love this!

**daretheghost** (8.5): Gets lost in the shuffle a bit, I think, but still gets me moving which is really the goal of all this.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): boppy

**Leixander** (8.5): So close to perfection yet so far

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Aerosmith did outsell but this is still good. [did she just say 'i'll fall out your feet'?]

**Flegasaurus** (8): i just don't wanna miss the deadline for the nu-disco rate (i probably will)

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The verses are great but the chorus is a bit tinny in comparison, even though I like both parts I think that both would be better if they were in different songs that flattered them.

**jexan13** (8): Good, and catchy, but it needs something more

**maxrocks329** (8): The vocals are kind of overshadowed by the instrumentals but it's still really good

**Parabox314** (8): This is cute!

**proscett** (8): smooth af. this is the hoe anthem of the album and i live for it!

**Vromega** (8): A lot of interesting instrumental elements. Well constructed song, good production. Kylie's voice is a bit too "superficial"

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.6): I don't wanna clooose my eyes

**akanewasright** (7.5): idk, this isn’t a standout or anything, but it’s really calming and sweet

**runaway3212** (7.5): Lovely

**KennyEarthman** (7): her vocals sound so airy and sweet

**waluigiest** (7): AWOOOOO

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Kylie releasing the synthpop confections Magic and Say Something as the first two singles from the album called **DISCO** is a real head-scratcher. This song is the better of the two.

**skargardin** (10): CAN YALL GIVE KYLIE A BREAK ALREADY. Love is love and it does end right here. Before we even started compiling ballots I was sure that this was a winner contender, honestly WHAT happened?? This is one of the most shocking placements of the rate for me. Say Something was released as the lead single off of DISCO and imo this song is a massive return to form following some missteps with her previous albums. The banging production sets the tone from the very start and it doesn't let go until the very end as it just builds and builds until the final euphoric chorus. I love this song so much and had hoped that it would make the upper half of day 3 but this is as far as it goes sadly. UGH

---

#Love is Love 

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): what a great comeback after a 10 year hiatus

**TiltControls** (11): some of the most fun I've had with a song in a long time

**1998tweety** (10): this took a minute to grow on me but whew it bops now

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This really grew on me, love it.

**banananaise** (10): i was sceptical at first but it grew on me! it's a grower ladies

**bbfan132** (10): so fucking good UGH :woeis:

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): wish i had another 11 because this is kylie's best song since like, love at first sight. its breathtaking in every sense

**conceptualromance** (10): I’m obsessed with this

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I remember listening to this song and the lyrics really hit hard to me as it was around the fifth month of quarantine lockdown when the song was released. I am not sure if this was intended to be a song written during the pandemic, but I feel like the lyrics retrospectively speak about missing the important people in our lives while we are isolated in our homes. As Kylie sings "Love is love, it never ends. Can we be as one ever again?", it begs the question if we would see the people we love the most ever again during this scary historical event. Kylie sings that line with an affirmative answer that we will indeed be as one ever again. This is overall one of my favorite songs in this album.

**Exaltatus** (10): Can these government hoes give me my vaccine so I can get pounded in the bathroom stall of the nearest gay club while Say Something plays in the distant background like I deserve?

**Gonza\_90** (10): I felt like I had to give Kylie at least one 10, and this is the best song from Disco.

**jasannn** (10): What a breath of fresh air.

**jexan13** (10): deserved to be #1 everywhere

**KennyEarthman** (10): that chorus is very jarring, yet it somehow works

**KuhBus** (10): A Dream.

**Leixander** (10): this is hypnotically repetitive in a good way and the best song she released since Skirt Aphrodite era

**LuisEnRod** (10): I didn’t properly get into this song until fairly recently, and boy, was I missing out. That chorus is euphoric and if it doesn’t get you going then you do not have a soul.

**ManofOranges** (10): I very distinctly remember also listening to this song on late nights, when I was alone in my apartment, and all that I had to accompany me would be the sight of the people doing capoeira outside, the screech of tires from yet another car crash, and my own thoughts. And on those nights when I would listen to this song I would close my eyes and let the song take me to another dimension as it slowly just builds to the end. It's actually just oh so beautiful to me. Yet another 11 contender.

**Misentro** (10): This song feels like a love letter to queerness

**mudkip1** (10): magical

**musical\_pyn** (10): this just has such a warm sound that I love

**Parabox314** (10): Yeah yeah single bias but it's still the best song on the album nawritstrue.

**pat-rickstar** (10): She knows how to pick good singles, this is one of my faves from this album even though it's not really disco

**proscett** (10): this song founded the united nations

**ReallyCreative** (10): the correct lead single

**runaway3212** (10): I love this more than other people I think, but it's so good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): a soothing bop, It’s more low-key than the other songs while retaining the disco feel, the slightly noisier part right before the last minute makes me ascend

**sirpancakeXI** (10): TBT the day when i said i would never like this song to my friend and then end up bopping to this song three days later.

**Turpamutteri** (10): Such a bop

**wavingwolves** (10): this is my most scrobbled song in this entire rate so... yes i do love it

**WillamThunderfuck** (10): This is such an anthemic song! I love when she repeats the "'Cause love is love..." parts, very healing for some reason.

**plastichaxan** (9.8): this personally made me hyped for the album, maybe it wasn't the best choice for lead single but i come back to it so much

**Chevsapher** (9.6): A massive track that gets better the more you listen to it. Kylie isn't normally known for innovative song structures, but here we are.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): This song is really cute, it makes me so happy. I'm not sure why she chose it as the lead single tho.

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Is it me or is the song is kinda mixed weirdly? Other than that it's amazing

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9.5): Kylie is good at disco and also choosing lead singles who would've guessed

**artzpop** (9.3): came in with a bang

**nooodisaster** (9): The centerpiece of the album, an absolute highlight, and a stunning lead single. It's simplicity comes off minimalist and intelligent. It's nostalgia comes off warm and refreshing. This is a bit of an enigma that it works SO well, but it absolutely deserves all the praise.

**pros-and-connors** (9): easily one of Kylie’s best

**static\_int\_husp** (9): "We're a million miles apart / In a thousand ways" big fucking mood after the past year

**Stryxen** (9): so smooth it makes me do the scarlett johansson in marriage story dance

**geraldinewww** (8.9): this is my favorite song on the album but yes, i do think it's because it was a single. i listened to it a bunch before the album and it slaps

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.6): This gets pretty ethereal towards the end!

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Argh. I love the first 2/3rds of this song so much, and then “love is love, it never ends / can we all be as one again” part kind of falls flat (I think the lyrics are super clunky). The ending brings me back with an incredible threading of the original melody through the song, but then they fall out again to a stripped down version of my least favorite part of the song. A mixed bag, but the good outweighs the bad for me.

**Vromega** (8.5): I'm not a huge fan of this single tbh but I remember listening to this on the breakfast show on the BBC with my popheads friends and it was really fun so... lemme give it a good score

**\_SoulGlitch** (8): something something something. There, I even said it three times.

**hikkaru** (8): something

**Flegasaurus** (7.5): wewowow wewowow

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is cute but kind of boring

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's got a good arpeggiator so that's a plus

**daretheghost** (7): I didn’t care much for this when it was released and it made me apprehensive about the album as a whole, especially because I didn’t love Golden. But this song is nice enough even if it doesn’t quite reach the same highs as others on the album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Kylie really had the nerve to call her album *Disco* after this was the lead single

skargardin: #It does end, right now

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this was gonna be good but the hook is just kinda a dud

**booksandplantsand** (6): it's a good song I'm just ambivalent

**lexarqade** (6): Unfortunately not the biggest fan of this song :/

**RandomHypnotica** (6): This song doesn't really do it for me, it feels like a more poppy version of Dancing (which I didn't like in the first place)

**vayyiqra** (6): Day to night to morning, keep with me in the moment / I'd let you had I known it, why don't you say so? whoops wrong song but a better one than this

**lolcevan** (5.5): i don’t understand the hype behind this song. it feels like it’s building up to something but it doesn’t quite go there

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): twice outsold

**akanewasright** (5): I really hate that “love is love” bridge. It just feels so corny and pander-y. If I didn’t like the production on this song as much as I do, it would be my 0, but I do love the guitar

**MrSwearword** (5): a horrendous lead single that embodies the DISCO label on synthpop shit that annoyed me so hard. Five generous bonus points because of the Basement Jaxx remix.

**frogaranaman** (4): I’m giving up on you, I’ll be the one if you want me to

**maxrocks329** (4): I don't hate this song, but it doesn't work with the rest of the album and it's kind of boring

**Awkward\_King** (0): unlike love, i wish this song would end
