**skargardin** (8): What do you know, guess it really was stoppable! I don't think this will come as much of a surprise to anyone. Most of you found this to be filler or otherwise unremarkable and I agree in parts. I think there are songs on DISCO that do what this does but better, HOWEVER this still bops a lot. And I do think this gets a bit of unfair treatment considering how it's far along in the backlist and melds in with the album's way already established sound. But at the end of the day I'm not sad to see it go i guess.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I've heard it all before... Fine Wine and Hey Lonely deserve this song's spot on the standard edition of the album.

---

#UNSTOPPABLE LAAAHVVV

**AHSWeeknd** (9): this beat is IT.

**waluigiest** (9): that bridge.... sex

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The lyrics are nothing to write home about, but I do love the bridge. I disliked the chorus initially, but it's grown on me.

**bbfan132** (8.5): that chorus is irresistible

**1998tweety** (8): a cute lil bop

**MrSwearword** (8): having to follow the best track of the album and not be the best thing ever works against it, but it does knock.

**Stryxen** (8): UN STOP A BLE LOVE

**Turpamutteri** (8): I like this but the chorus isn't the best imo

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): not a big fan of the chorus but other than that, this is a really fun song.

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): This is around the point where it feels like this album has a few too many songs

**WillamThunderfuck** (7.5): Very cute, but doesn't really compare to the rest of the album.

**daretheghost** (7): It’s fine.

**Exaltatus** (7): I wouldn't skip it, but it's not nearly as good as the others on the album.

**musical\_pyn** (7): I mean the song is done better by literally the next song on the album so…

**runaway3212** (7): fine

#well, guess what, Kylie?

**rickikardashian** (6.8): this is a kpop b side that gets called underrated on a tweet by a gay man that gets only 15 likes and 2 rt's

**LazyDayLullaby** (6.5): Somewhat stoppable

**Alumineous** (6): I like Kylie's "oohs", but otherwise, I will stop and move on.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Lianne La Havas outsold

**thedoctordances1940** (6): That ooh yeah is really irritating, rest of the song is decent though

**vayyiqra** (6): This album starts to feel by this point like it will never stop indeed so true

**targetguest** (5.5): It's not bad by any means, it just falls through in a sea of 10s

**booksandplantsand** (5): feels like filler

**EnCaine** (5): 🤷

**jasannn** (5): Inoffensive filler

**KennyEarthman** (5): kinda underwhelming

**maxrocks329** (5): It's honestly pretty good as background music, but actively listening to it is boring

**Misentro** (5): The only real dud on the album, that "Ooh! Yeah!" kills the energy.

**Parabox314** (5): This feels like filler.

**ReallyCreative** (5): it's annoying and there are several other songs that do this better

**seanderlust** (5): this makes me feel like i'm in an old navy commercial

**artzpop** (4): just no

**corrodedbeauty** (4): it’s… a song

**cremeebrulee** (4): a skip

**Flegasaurus** (4): i could do without this one

**frogaranaman** (4): don’t stop me ‘cause I’m having a good time, having a good time

**just\_thonking** (4): As soon as the song ended I already forgot how it went

**Leixander** (4): utterly unremarkable

**nooodisaster** (4): Please stop it

**sirpancakeXI** (4): this just feel like a filler track

**Vromega** (4): ooooohhhh yeeeeaaaaahhhhhh.... no

**wavingwolves** (4): this is the opposite of unstoppable because right when it comes on it makes me want to stop it and skip it

**akanewasright** (3): ...this song exists. Can’t say much more about it.

**ManofOranges** (3): Another song title about not stopping and another case where it should've stopped

**proscett** (3): putting this right after the masterpiece that is dance floor darling is... bold, to say the least

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): I mean, it's just filler, is it not?.. It's cute, but skippable, like most Kylie deluxe tracks in general, to be fair.

**skargardin** (6): The first DISCO bonus track bites the dust and I'm not mad at this to be honest. I find this to be the overall weakest song in the rate. It's pleasant enough but doesn't really go anywhere and it also ends really abruptly. I think this could've used a fadeout to give it more of a proper closure to the album instead of it just.. ending.

#DAE Jessie outsold?

**hikkaru** (8.5): good. but jessie washed a lil i fear

**Exaltatus** (8): I'm sorry Kylie, Jessie wore it better.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): (Kylie’s Version)

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): The inferior spotlight

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): Cute, but it's got nothing on Jessie

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The podcast queen’s Spotlight was better.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): This is cute but I think Jessie Ware outsold with her own Spotlight.

**qazz23** (7): Jessie will steal the spotlight here

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Why listen to Spotlight (Kylie) when you could listen to Spotlight (Jessie) though? And when is Spotlight (Róisín) dropping??

**rickikardashian** (7): kylie set herself up by naming a disco song the same asnay jessie song

**vayyiqra** (7): The less good Spotlight but it's still okay

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): Jessie wiped her here

**pietrohonkhonk** (6.5): Jessie Ware outsold

**TiltControls** (6.5): Jessie > Kylie sorry I don't make the rules

**Turpamutteri** (6.5): Jessie's Spotlight is better, sorry Kylie

**Alumineous** (6): She knew Jessie's lawyers won't come for her, but Aerosmith would.

**wavingwolves** (6): outsolded by jessie but the competition wasn't even fair

**jasannn** (5): It just seems super generic when you have Jessie Ware's Spotlight here.

**nooodisaster** (5): Jessie outsold

**slimboyfriend** (5): I bet Kylie wanted to put this on her album but heard Jessie Ware's Spotlight and got embarrassed

**Brendon-Urine** (4): love Kylie but the Jessie spotlight is vastly superior.

**just\_thonking** (4): The inferior Spotlight

**akanewasright** (2): ...this having the same title as a Jessie song just makes it seem so much worse. This is lifeless

**shivof** (0): I barely give out any zeros but this album got so insufferable gradually with the songs in the second half sounding like rehashed versions of each other that I couldn't help myself. Jessie opened her album with the best Spotlight and Kylie closed hers with the worst.

#Wanna stay in the spotlight

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): it's funny that kylie should have started her album on spotlight and jessie arguably should have ended her album on hers. also this song goes the fuck off.

**runaway3212** (10): another amazing closer

**Chevsapher** (9.1): The bridge is so Daft Punk, and the strings in the chorus are a clever touch.

**daretheghost** (8.5): This is going to get compared to JWare’s ‘Spotlight,’ and perhaps unfairly, because this is a really nice song and the best of these four bonus tracks.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): i want to love this even more but it feels just a bit incomplete? like there's a great start but it feels like it wants to grow a bit more

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): me @ anything with a vocoder: omg so fun, I’m getting Daft Punk vibes

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**Leixander** (8): this is a lot better than I remember, the chorus is very nice

**MrSwearword** (8): it doesn't make that much sense to be the closing track on the album. However, it's cute.

**waluigiest** (8): it feels like an encore, which I guess is a nice conclusion

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun but forgettable

**bigbigbee** (7.5): It’s really not bad, but I suspect it would have placed higher if there wasn’t a superior song with the same name in the same rate; hard to avoid the comparison, but I genuinely think this is fun and at least in the top half of songs in this album

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): Song is just fine, feels like a filler to me.

**corrodedbeauty** (7): the difference in production between this album and the other two… LMAO

**KuhBus** (7): Closes out a bit weak, still good, though.

**Parabox314** (7): This album is still going?

#Spotlight on me and I'm ready to break

**vagenda** (6.7): You really don't want to be the other person with a song called Spotlight in this rate

**EnCaine** (6.5): the talkbox was cool

**pros-and-connors** (6.5): Daniel

**ACORGIORGY** (6): literally none of the deluxe edition tracks were worth it :(

**banananaise** (6): tbh the songs which most honestly pay tribute to the way disco music actually sounded back in the 70s are the least interesting songs on DISCO. i like the idea and the feeling of disco music, but like 80% of real disco music was kinda boring.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Spotlight (Kylie) this, Spotlight (Jessie) that… what about Spotlight (Jennifer Hudson)?

**KennyEarthman** (6): those robotic vocals... Daft Punk tease

**ManofOranges** (6): Meh. In terms of quality it's probably the inferior spotlight, but probably will get a higher score than the other one from me.

**ReallyCreative** (5.8): it's fun but it's nothing special and stands out as a bit redundant

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): I forget about this song immediately after listening every time

**pat-rickstar** (5.5): This is ok but I can never remember what it sounds like once it's finished

**bulforster** (5): She's a cute girl. Cute... next to gorgeous.

**Flegasaurus** (5): heyyyyy heyyyyyy woo woo

**Stryxen** (5): just kinda started and then ended

**booksandplantsand** (4): more filler

**lolcevan** (4): flop

**proscett** (3): hearing kylie sing "it's a vibe" is simply too much for me i'm sorry

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): why are people dancing greasy ?!? what does that mean???

**mudkip1** (2): i am SICK of these daft punk-esque vocoder noises shes doing with her voice, i don't like it one bit i'm glad this album is over

**musical\_pyn** (2): when I first listened to this song it was a 5 but every subsequent listen has made it worse so I’m going to stop before it becomes a 0

**skargardin** (8): Another bonus track gets cut! Fun fact, this is the "official" b-side to "Magic" on the vinyl single relase, so there's that! Not too surprised at this one's placement either as it's .. definitely a bonus track. I still think it has some pretty melodies and has some nice late night energy to it. Unfortunately it was never going to make it far in the rate. Sad!

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): It's fitting that this was the B-side on the LP of the worst single.

---

#We appreciate bonus tracks

**Exaltatus** (10): Cause I'm a better dancer with youuuu!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I kinda forgot about this one but listening to it again it’s actually fantastic? It’s a nice middle ground between a dance pop song and a ballad, the kind of emotional track you’d dance to over the credits of a movie, and Kylie’s performance here really sells it. The lyrics of this one actually kinda get to me, for some reason any song with the lyric “dancing in the moonlight” is a song that I like. I have this one pegged as an early out but I’m gonna be sad about it.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I don’t have a whole lot to say about this album since the songs are all consistently good for similar reasons but this might be my favorite chorus from it

**AHSWeeknd** (9): come through synth

**Chevsapher** (8.8): There's nothing innovative here, but it's another well-structured pop song, so I'm not complaining.

**1998tweety** (8): a bit snoozey but still good

**booksandplantsand** (8): im so single, this hurts coming off of Celebrate You, but it slaps

**bulforster** (8): Basically a worse version of Celebrate You with too much reverb on Kylie's vocals but it's still the best of the deluxe tracks.

**daretheghost** (8): I could use more of this giddy optimism in my life.

**Misentro** (8): Cause I'm a better dancer with youuu~!

**MrSwearword** (8): it still has that cheesy sunny quirk that always finds its way into Kylie's music but at least the production is fire.

**mudkip1** (8): pretty cute!

**seanderlust** (8): i kind of wish the synth solo at the end was longer and extended into a full outro! it was the most interesting thing happening instrumentally

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why do I like the more than a bunch of other songs on the main version lol

**bbfan132** (7.5): it’s definitely good but i wish i connected with it more

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Well produced, lyrically generic

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Pretty good, but nowhere near as vital as the Róisín bonus tracks

**proscett** (7): this should've been on the main album over monday blues or unstoppable tbh

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's cute, but it's filler

**Stryxen** (7): unfortunately i don’t!

#Singles squad i fear

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I think the melody of this song is…kinda bad

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): Not really a lot happening on this song.

**artzpop** (6.2): forgettable

**ManofOranges** (6): And when's that gonna be, huh?

**Parabox314** (6): The album is kind of losing steam at this point :/ Needed to be a lot tighter imo.

**runaway3212** (6): a bit bland

**Vromega** (6): I appreciate the effort of going for high notes, but the melody is just not interesting at all besides that.

**Flegasaurus** (5): i can see why it's a bonus track

**frogaranaman** (5): I don’t want your body but I hate to think about you with somebody else

**KennyEarthman** (5): unremarkable bop

**musical\_pyn** (5): very forgettable, sorry to this man

**thedoctordances1940** (5): this exists ig

**akanewasright** (4.5): She sounds so nice here, but like... idk, Celebrate You was such a good closer. Following it up with a track like this makes it seem even worse. Plus, Kylie’s performance is the only truly memorable part of the song imo.

**wavingwolves** (4): kylie proving me once again i don't know what it is to love someone

**Leixander** (3): the chorus is beyond annoying and the rest of the song is not even worth mentioning

**LuisEnRod** (3): at this point in the album in just bored

**waluigiest** (3): it’s shapeless to me

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): kylie please stop making that noise

skargardin: Up next our first bonus rate cut! Our idea behind the bonus rate was bc of this being a dance pop rate, and remixes being so essential to the culture, we wanted to showcase the variety of remixes that exist for these albums. So hopefully if you did it you found at least something you liked sdfjs

skargardin: [Róisín said it better than I ever could but here is an actual quote from her:](https://www.prsformusic.com/m-magazine/features/interview-roisin-machine/)

> The art of the remix is so important, some remixes and reworks are some of my most favourite things in the world ever. Dance music is meant to live on, to be repurposed and even at the point of consuming it on a dancefloor it can be manipulated, changed, looped and different frequencies can be pulled out of it, if you are clever enough sonically. And the remixer has to feel something for the tune.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): The worse of the two Greek-mythology-inspired songs in the rate.

**skargardin** (8): This is a really cute reimagining to be honest, not something I listen to all the time but I think it does stand out from the rest of the remixes here! The synths are really mysterious and cool I think. Actually kinda shocked how it placed last in the bonus rate but oh well..

---

#fly high

**Chevsapher** (8.9): That lead synth is a mood in and of itself.

**daretheghost** (8.5): When I was in high school the local ~alternative~ radio station would have a few hours late every Friday night where they’d play dreamy Royksoppy remixes and electronic music like this and listening to this is really taking me back.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): great, but not the What's Your Pleasure? Georgia Remix

**engifear** (8): I was mixed on this one at first, but after I started treating it separately from the original song I realized I actually kind of enjoyed it.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): This sounds like it belongs in her first two albums. Also if I close my eyes I can hear her sing like Kylie lmao.

**Parabox314** (8): On first listen this was like a 5 for me but I gave it another chance and found myself enjoying it a lot more.

**seanderlust** (8): i'm gonna be honest, I think this remix detracts from the original a bit, but it still bops

**bbfan132** (7.5): pretty remix but too repetitive

**Exaltatus** (7): On first listen, I didn't care for this remix, but I like that it diverges just enough from the original that it becomes its own thing.

**KennyEarthman** (7): like the original more


#fly low 

**maxrocks329** (6): Not bad, but it takes away some of the intensity that I liked from the original

**musical\_pyn** (6): aw this takes away most of my favorite parts of spotlight

**Stryxen** (5.5): not as good as the original but i more or less enjoy it. I don't like that synth lick tho

**AHSWeeknd** (5): these sorts of remixes get made for modern-day discos, which doesn’t mean they’re good.

**jasannn** (5): It's way too busy and it ruins the elegance of the original.

**ACORGIORGY** (4): tonal mismatch imo

**bespectacIed** (4): unnecessary

**wavingwolves** (4): well

**waluigiest** (3): wow I feel like this remix takes any existing character or emotion from Spotlight and erases it

**booksandplantsand** (2): this song did NOT need a remix stfu

**Brendon-Urine** (2): kinda disgusted by this

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): What *am* I doing for the rest of my life?..

**skargardin** (10): Kylie really chose to call out all the lonely bitches like this, huh?! This one hurts a bit because it's actually one of my favourite tracks on the whole album, it's super cute. Kylie actually served some vocals and cute melodies, I wish it had been done better in this rate. But bonus track phobia decided to show up yet again, sad!!

---

#I FEEL VERY ATTACKED

**Parabox314** (9): As a lonely bitch I can relate. Also this is a good track.

**ReallyCreative** (9): my sleep paralysis demon to me

**runaway3212** (9): 'Hey kylie thanks for calling me'

**Flegasaurus** (8): omg hi kylie!!!! i'm not doing anything for the rest of my life

**Stryxen** (8): great question kylie, i don’t really know what career i want to go into but i’m hoping my degree will open quite a lot of doors in a few different industries so i hopefully won’t be short of work for the rest of my life. In terms of my social life, I’m definitely not ready to settle down yet, but I’m not lonely haha!! I’m just having fun with seeing people but i’m completely content being single atm, what about you kylie, what are you doing for the rest of your life?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I have a name bitch…

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): well thats a bit rude

**ManofOranges** (6): Not Ms. Kylie addressing a song towards me

**seanderlust** (6): i don't KNOW!! I don't KNOW what I'm doing with the rest of my life!!! is that what you wanted to hear kylie?!

**Exaltatus** (5): Kylie calling my lonely single ass out in the middle of a pandemic is homophobia.

**frogaranaman** (5): ‘cause I’m so fucking lonely, I’m so lonely, I’m so lonely

**jasannn** (5): No need to call me out Kylie...

#Bestie vibes only

**bespectacIed** (10): sounds like a carly track

**bigbigbee** (10): Perfect pop song, has a nice throwback sound to it (I’m reminded of something like “Let’s Hear It For The Boy”)

**targetguest** (10): another slept on song. This took my #1 spot for Kylie in the most recent TOP TEN POP TEN. I stand by it

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): I didn't expect much from the bonus tracks, but this has got a really nice vibe, a cute melody and surprisingly good vocals

**Chevsapher** (9): A little rough around the edges, but what a sweet song. “My sweetness and devotion, all of that emotion” is my favorite part because it has such an interesting flow.

**pietrohonkhonk** (9): I think of all the songs in this rate, this one best captured the feel of a classic disco song

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Me greeting the best track on Ungodly Hour

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute lil bop

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This production really deserved better lyrics

**bbfan132** (8): this is a cute bonus track

**conceptualromance** (8): she’s cute

**MrSwearword** (8): at least it makes sense on the album in terms of placement.

**nooodisaster** (8): Okay this is cute the fuck

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): This seems like a lock-in for Day 1. It’s a good song but it doesn’t really stand out amongst the other songs from the album.

**booksandplantsand** (7): quite cute!

**daretheghost** (7): Cute but forgettable.

**LazyDayLullaby** (7): Only Lonely

**vayyiqra** (7): :hanawinsLuv:

**EnCaine** (5.3): it's whatever

**akanewasright** (5): Didn’t Bebe Rexha have a hook like this?

**KennyEarthman** (5): filler bop

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'M ALREADY UPSET AT THIS SONG'S INEVTIABLE LOW PLACEMENT! I hope Skar elaborates why.

**skargardin** (10): This feels.. wrong. If you hated DISCO by this point of the album, this track is not going to win you over, I'll give it that. I'm not going to discredit the fact that this is cheesy as fuck, you all are definitely right about that. However, I do think this is a fantastic closer that feels like a warm hug, even if the writing is incredibly cheesy I think there's a lot of enjoyable moments here from the melody and the euphoric production. It really feels like it gives a sense of finality to the album. INCREDIBLY robbed imo!!

# But wow the way you spilled

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Queen of bringing up one of the most important aspects of disco, celebrating those who looked for a haven in a society that shunned them.

#Mary stans, assemble!

**lolcevan** (9.5): idk who mary is but i’m living for her, go get it ig. this song never fails to put me in such a good mood

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): "I’ve never written a song in the third person before. The character of Mary was born out of mumble-singing melodies." Folklore is shakinggggggg. Jokes aside, I think this is a great closer to an album full of bops and I am so glad this isn't a ballad or anything.

**nooodisaster** (9): Sooo wholesome and cute and also a bop??? We stan Mary.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.3): a wholesome bop, we love and support Mary

#I CELEBRATE ALL OF YOUU-U-U-UUU HONESTLY

**Exaltatus** (10): Beautiful end to the album.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): This is such a great closer 🥺❤️

**ManofOranges** (10): There's something so calming, soothing about this one. A lot of the songs on this album are very--for lack of a better word--annoying, but this one never goes too far in, it always stays restrained enough to keep me wanting more, but never giving too much. It's a very tasteful celebration.

**pheromenos** (10): such a beautiful album closer (not counting the deluxe tracks)

**Turpamutteri** (10): I can't explain why but this song just makes me incredibly happy

**bulforster** (9.8): The Mary, Mary refrain is pretty clunky but the chorus is so wholesome I barely care.

**conceptualromance** (9.5): u know the addy.

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): feels kinda warm and comfortable, like a song hug

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9.5): We love supporting our friends

**1998tweety** (9): this is surprisingly good

**booksandplantsand** (9): okay this one actually gets me kinda emotional i wanna sing it to my friends ;-;

**Brendon-Urine** (9): this song feels like I've been sobbing for hours all day and Kylie doesn't know how to help so just gives me a huge warm hug and suddenly everything is ok and I'm happy again

**Chevsapher** (9): Not the strongest track on the album, but it has so much heart. I would love to see Kylie go in this direction for her next project.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): sis is straining them vocals but it's cute enough to not matter

**musical\_pyn** (9): extremely strong closer, just another warm song

**runaway3212** (9): This is super sweet but I love it

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Despite the album being pretty inconsistent, this is a fantastic closing track

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): https://78.media.tumblr.com/a70b7946a89013e6b8390eecf071f436/tumblr_inline_pfkjz2M7va1rbgerg_540.gif

**plastichaxan** (8.5): the line “everything i like about myself is better with you” makes me yearn i can’t lie

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This one is cute

**akanewasright** (8): A really solid closer. Cheesy as hell, but really sweet.

**bbfan132** (8): nice closer to the standard album!! it ties things together nicely

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is so cheesy and cute i’m on the borderline of hating it BUT kylie’s delivery of it makes it seem genuine to me

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Didn't click right away, but a nice little closer - just not as good as the other two!

**LuisEnRod** (8): this is a really cute and romantic song, and I see myself dedicating it to someone in the future

**pietrohonkhonk** (8): Why does the intro sound like one of those bad Facebook videos, you know the ones I’m talking about

**rickikardashian** (7.8): is this religious

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): cute i guess

**jasannn** (7.5): Super cheesy but so is the rest of the album which makes it a suitable closer.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's cute but I think she's done this before, and better

**seanderlust** (7.5): aw this is sweet :)

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): Women supporting other women, we love to see it. But this will be out on Day 1 because popheads

**artzpop** (7): its cute but i kinda cringe at it

**daretheghost** (7): Cute!

**luckyphase** (7): a wonderful song that I don’t have the emotional range for

#Too much cheese I fear

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): a nice closer but it’s a bit cheesy for me

**targetguest** (6.5): okay maybe not a sea of 10s

**WillamThunderfuck** (6.5): A little too cheesy lmao

**EnCaine** (6.2): this is kinda cute

**KennyEarthman** (6): when she rhymed you with you... lyrical genius

**Stryxen** (6): aww this is so cute instantly forgets about it

**wavingwolves** (5.5): i fear that even birthday by katy perry outsold this

**Flegasaurus** (4): yet another very safe boring song rip i expected more

**jayjaysortagay** (4): this song is such a stain on the album, it's the only one I don't like. The opening is so annoying.

**Awkward\_King** (3): why does she sound like that

**frogaranaman** (3): celebrate good times, come on

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): help this album is so frontloaded

**MrSwearword** (3): eww I remembered not liking this track because of how goddamn saccharine it is. It's not quite as cringy like release day but jesus fuck.

**Leixander** (2): I detest this so much. She somehow managed to combine everything wrong with Golden, some of the worst songs on Aphrodite and X in one song.

**mudkip1** (2): what the fuck are these lyrics

**waluigiest** (0): this pisses me off. It’s corny. It’s unoriginal. The writing is bad.

# Who IS Mary?

**proscett** (8): y'all who is mary? anyways this is a bop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): who the FUCK is Mary???

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): why doesn’t Kylie singing to Mary get the attention gays give betty, this is a much gayer song from a straight blond pop girl in 2020

**kirby31200** (6): The "Mary Mary"s make me feel like I'm listening to a kid's song

**corrodedbeauty** (5.5): who tf is mary

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The song that's grown on me the most in the entire rate. The snappy guitar riffs and the high energy beat compliment Kylie ~~screeching~~ climbing up those high notes in the choruses.

**skargardin** (9): Honestly this one is a bit shocking to me? Kylie is reminding us of all the weekdays and this is how we choose to repay her?? Do you all hate having fun? Honestly try not to get this chorus out of your head! (sorry, pun definitely intended.) MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY IT'S THE WEEKEEEND!!!!

---

#MONDAY TUESDAY WEDNESDAY THURSDAY FRIDAY IT'S THE WEEKEEEND!!!!!

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday...it's the Weekend!

**pheromenos** (11): someone's got to give Kylie an 11 and i'm happy to be that one. please get this to top 10 at least or i'm gonna be...very blue...

**throwaway9374929** (11): this barely got my 11 but the production is too good to not give it to this

**akanewasright** (10): fuck it. This is adorable

**bigbigbee** (10): This is just a k-pop song. Genuinely, if this had a Korean version, they wouldn’t even change the chorus, I think. Anyway, I think that’s a good thing; this song is SO much fun. PS stream Hurt Locker by Nine Muses.

**booksandplantsand** (10): if I was technologically savvy enough to make this my alarm I would wake up to this every monday

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): If I had two 11s this would get one of them! I have a huge soft spot for cheesy Kylie (*Enjoy Yourself* is great actually) and this feels like a sequel to “Disco Down” (my favorite Kylie song) filtered through the lens of “Spice Up Your Life.” It’s a silly song but I find it to be the catchiest on the album and one of the most memorable of the rate in general.

**jexan13** (10): do i tell you a little secret? i like other men too :)

**KuhBus** (10): LOVE the energy!!

**MrSwearword** (10): kitschy fun from start to finish, don't let me be the only high scorer on this

**mudkip1** (10): i love this idk why but i do

**runaway3212** (10): I love this so much, dancing trough pain or sadness is probably my favourite lyrical theme

**targetguest** (10): Everyone hates on this song and I think it's just misdirected loathing of capitalism

**waluigiest** (10): Sunday Scaries gone so so right

**wavingwolves** (9.5): cheesy but when the cheese is good it makes everything just as delicious

**artzpop** (9.2): idc i love this song

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): Rebecca Black outsold

**Chevsapher** (9.1): I had mixed feelings about this track initially, but I've grown to love it. It's campy and fun and has a fabulously funky bridge.

**Exaltatus** (9): This song just makes me so happy. It's the sequel to Friday we all deserved.

**hikkaru** (9): rebecca black could never, black eyed peas who, etc etc

**qazz23** (9): I like it despite the cliche lyrics

**seeyanever** (8.8): Yes queen remind me what the days of the week are

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is a very fun song but the bridge felt a bit lazy :/ still enjoyed it a lot

**plastichaxan** (8.5): songs that tell me the days of the week yass >>>

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this sounds like a kpop b-side

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Kylie is a Garfield stan I see

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): I love the energy of this song, but there's something about her naming the days of the week that feels a little too kindergartenish, which takes me out of the mood

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.4): this song gets a lot of hate but it is camp! y'all just dont understand!

**geraldinewww** (8.2): monday tuesday wednesday thursday friday IT'S A WEEKEEEENDDDD

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): it's very fun but very mindless, it's grown on me surprisingly though which I didn't expect

**BaconShoes** (8): an underrated bop

**daretheghost** (8): A bop, but I’m never thinking, “I need to listen to ‘Monday Blues,’” you know?

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Rebecca Black collab when?

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): It's Friday, I'm in love

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): It's ten years as later, now it's Kylie on Friday / I'm sick of living through these Monday, Tuesday, Wednesdays / But then Thursday comes along and we are saying / "Friday, here comes fucking Friday"!

**\_SoulGlitch** (7.5): kylie said no monday rights

**engifear** (7.5): There's a little bit where she says "getting me through those Monday blues" and it kinda reminds me of American Boy where Estelle sings "you'll be my American Boy, American Boy"

**Flegasaurus** (7): i have monday blues every day of the week

**luckyphase** (7): 🥺

**seanderlust** (7): queen of understanding the passage of time

**Turpamutteri** (7): I already know the days of the week okay

#Wish they got blue monday out of their head (sorry.. I had to)

**buddhacharm** (6.5): Something about this is a serve but something about this is also painfully grating? It's so...dynamic like that or something

**jasannn** (6.5): It's so annoyingly catchy.

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): ended Monday

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): the production here feels so thin, and the lyrics feel corny but not like Kylie’s campiest classics

**AHSWeeknd** (6): I mean, she nailed some of the cringe lyrics that came with the peak of disco.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the Black Eyed Peas ended her

**maxrocks329** (6): I can't explain it but this song has the same vibes as that annoying, overly enthusiastic coworker you hate

**musical\_pyn** (6): black eyed peas did it better

**Stryxen** (6): an assault on my ears! i love it!

**thedoctordances1940** (6): I'd probably pick this song if I had to choose just one to represent the whole album. It feels like Kylie intended to make a bunch of fun tracks with this album, and she definitely managed that, but the moment you start to properly listen to them, is the moment they start to fall apart and this one is a prime example of that. Incessantly repetitive, silly lyrics and overall pretty annoying, but also quite fun.

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): I am now glucose intolerant after listening to this song

**ACORGIORGY** (5): this.... gives me the Monday Blues

**Leixander** (5): eh-eh-eh

**LuisEnRod** (5): this song feels so full yet so flat at the same time

**nooodisaster** (5): kylie does not have a monday to friday job why the fuck is she singing about "monday blues"

**Vromega** (5): I feel completely left aside on this song. It's already hard to follow her rythm in the first verse and then I'm just completely lost when the chorus starts. I feel like she is only singing with herself. Have fun I guess

**just\_thonking** (4): "Monday Tuesday Wednesday Thursday Friday it's the weekend!" -- she truly is a master lyricist

**vayyiqra** (4): Can't Get Blue Monday Blues Out of My Head is the mashup we need. This song, though, is not something we need. It's just obnoxious for some reason and also I hate when songs list random stuff like days of the week or placenames. It's so low-effort.

**corrodedbeauty** (3): why does this sound like Celebration lmao

**pat-rickstar** (3): The chorus is very annoying

**pietrohonkhonk** (3): Annoying. This song would say “konichiwa” to the waiter at a Mexican restaurant

**Awkward\_King** (2): i really like the production of this but i dont like... any of the rest of it

**Alumineous** (1): Initially, I was disgusted. Now, I just laugh because it's so bad. Especially when she goes through the days of the week. When the song ended so abruptly, first thought was, "Wait, that's it?" and then I was just laughing, thinking "She really ended the song on the corniest lyrics SHE PULLED OFF FROM THE CALENDAR." The gays truly will listen to anything, I guess.

**ManofOranges** (1): It's just not good

**conceptualromance** (0): not a fan of this use of acoustic guitar

**frogaranaman** (0): I can picture this song perfectly over a children’s show dance segment

**Parabox314** (0): Something about this is so obnoxiously "BBC Radio 2"-core. Too loud, and not the good loud but the noisy school disco loud.

**proscett** (0): this is the corniest song on the album, which is saying a lot.

**Parabox314** (10): Pops the fuck off.

**musical\_pyn** (9): i'm very surprised by how good this is

**banananaise** (8): finally some good fucking remix

**Chevsapher** (7): “Say Something” has no end of interesting elements; it deserved more than this generic tropical house nonsense. If I'm going to stream Syn Cole, I'd rather listen to “It's You” or “Horizon 83.”

**Exaltatus** (7): Doesn't really add enough to the original in my opinion.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7): This is the exact type of song that gets played in some Ibiza beach club

**ReallyCreative** (7): fine

**KennyEarthman** (6.5): Say Something but make it generic

**bbfan132** (6): this isn’t bad, it’s just boring

**daretheghost** (6): It exists.

**Leixander** (6): very generic

**AHSWeeknd** (5): this removes that subtlety out of the song, which is what made the original one good.

**booksandplantsand** (5): no real opinion on this one

**Stryxen** (5): the most neutral i’ve been this whole rate

**maxrocks329** (4): At least this one isn't worse than the original, but it isn't any better either

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): It's quite funny that a song written to subtly promote Kylie Wines is actually a bop and a half.

**skargardin** (9): Drinking fine wine with the besties! Honestly when the track list to DISCO was announced I feared for this being a shoehorned-in Kylie Wines ad, which I guess it still kind of is, but god does it help that this bops hard as fuck in the best Mom-Pop type of way, cheers for the final DISCO bonus track getting this far!

---

#THE WINNER IS ROSÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉÉ

**AGM301** (11): LOVE IT

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): This one is an unabashedly good time and the “Jump in my ride beep-beep” made me actually lol with how unexpectedly cute it was.

**booksandplantsand** (10): no more sadness only pussy popping!!

**hikkaru** (10): the best deluxe track

**lolcevan** (10): beep beep!

**ManofOranges** (10): "Drinking fine wine if you like the finer things in life" sounds exactly like a sign that my mom would hang up on the kitchen wall somewhere and I'm not sure how to feel about that.

**Misentro** (10): I already know Fine Wine won't get its dues but it's one of the best songs on the album. I don't know a funner song.

**MrSwearword** (10): granted nothing on an album called DISCO should be shorter than three minutes and thirty seconds unless you're "Shame" by Evelyn Champagne King. Still, this track bangs.

**qazz23** (10): beep beep! Favorite of the bonus/deluxe edition tracks

**ReallyCreative** (10): what 20% of my blood consists of

**shesdoingyoga** (10): When I first saw the name of this track I assumed it was going to be a MILF anthem about how she aged like fine wine or something like that

**targetguest** (10): I drive 500 miles round trip every weekend to see my fiancé and this song occupied my highway playlist for a veeeery long time based just on how easy it is to dance and drive to this song. beep beep!

**1998tweety** (9): it was camp [3] i just know this is gonna be her first song out though

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): Vroom Vroom's impact

**waluigiest** (8): wine aunts unite

**WillamThunderfuck** (8): TOOT TOOT HEYYY BEEP BEEP

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): this won’t age like wine but who cares this is so fun to listen to right now!!!

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.8): "Jump in my ride (Beep beep)" is so cheesy but I am absolutely head over heels in love with it

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): why is the pre-chorus basically a super catchy hokey pokey

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): toot toot! Beep beep! Good girls...

**TiltControls** (7.5): The KylieGram™ DISCO Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more difficult as it continues. The 16 song pacer test will begin in 5.6 seconds. Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to strike a pose, and shake that thing from left to right as long as possible. The second time you fail to take a sip before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word "disco". On your mark, get ready, disco.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): an acquired taste just like wine YAS

**banananaise** (7): blatant Kylie Wines marketing but idc

**Brendon-Urine** (7): she kinda rocks the shout style verses

**jasannn** (7): Live, Laugh, Love & Drink Wine.

**KennyEarthman** (7): made me an alcoholic

**vayyiqra** (7): Wine that is low quality but still kind of enjoyable is known to wine snobs as "quaff". This song is that.

#Must be beer stans

**Stryxen** (6.4): i don’t know how much i liked this but i cannot stop thinking about it

**AHSWeeknd** (6): “beep beep” queen of referencing Donna Summer on such a bland song

**nooodisaster** (6): Wait I really thought this was a song about how she was old bye

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): I'm sorry I can't take this song seriously with those "beep beep" 💀

**conceptualromance** (5): perfect for wine mom Facebook post captions. Also, beep beep!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): just saying “beep beep” doesn’t mean it’s good Kylie, don’t interpolate an iconic song if you aren’t gonna live up to it

**thedoctordances1940** (5): This is simultaneously awful and amazing

**corrodedbeauty** (4.5): Pitchfork was right about this album

**KuhBus** (4): The beep beep is annoying.

**frogaranaman** (3): must be some knockoff fine wine

**Gonza\_90** (3): Kylie, what are you doing? This is so bad.

**proscett** (2): the bad girls beep-beep singlehandedly saves this from receiving my 0

**mudkip1** (1): kylie WHAT are these lyrics

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Your Disco Needs You to not rob this song! Since when does popheads not love high-energy bops?

**skargardin** (9): Again, you all seriously hate having fun don't you? This is so high energy and simply such a good time that I find it hard that anyone could seriously hate this. But some of you found this annoying so what do I know really.

---

#Where DOES the DJ Go?

**Awkward\_King** (10): idk maybe hes in the bathroom

**static\_int\_husp** (10): home Kylie, he goes home.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): To Chromatica, probably

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): The DJ is not sleeping tonight and that’s on God

**seanderlust** (8.5): he goes to do blow in someone's basement kylie this isn't hard

**AHSWeeknd** (7): idk to his house I guess…

**pietrohonkhonk** (7): when we all fall asleep, where does the dj go?

**conceptualromance** (6.9): Kylie asking the real questions!

**frogaranaman** (6): the DJ goes home and sleeps

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): the dj and this song kinda go nowhere

**Flegasaurus** (5): gone he left

**proscett** (5): he probably goes home kylie

**vayyiqra** (5): Home to go to bed which is what I want to do right now instead of listening to this bland song

**Alumineous** (3): I rather go to where they're going, to be honest.

**ManofOranges** (3): Home, probably

#Hey Mr. DJ, put a record on, I WANNA DANCE WITH MY BAYBEE

**KuhBus** (11): That funky guitar came right for my p***y.

**1998tweety** (10): it was camp [2]

**booksandplantsand** (10): i was OBSESSED with this song immediately and it's still great

**jexan13** (10): when the prechorus hit and my soul gets disconnected >>

**KennyEarthman** (10): this song radiates theater kid energy

**Misentro** (10): I'm running out of good things to say, this album is just banger after banger.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song FEELS like I'm disco

**plastichaxan** (10): my favorite this album, underrated bop about djs and their whereabouts

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is like poppers for the soul

**Stryxen** (10): why is this the kylie song i will be defending to my death

**targetguest** (10): THE INTRO!!!

**waluigiest** (10): I’ve been obsessed since my first listen of the album. The dramatic intro is soft, but they know it doesn’t need to drag on longer than 8 bars. The groove is fantastic. It’s perfectly danceable, and I’m patiently waiting to shake ass to it in the club.

**oscarbrierley1** (9.7): wish the intro was a bit longer and more grand (like last dance by donna summer)

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): oh when the party is over 😔…… 😳…….😏 DJAAAAAAAAAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

**hikkaru** (9.5): she said "you can have 5 seconds of ballad, as a treat" and then went right back to bopping (as she should)

**WillamThunderfuck** (9.5): This song matches my quick-walking speed when I'm rushing but I don't wanna run.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): I appreciate that a song titled "Where Does the DJ Go?" has an instrumental that sounds like it's a DJ Mix

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Short and campy... just like Kylie!

**Exaltatus** (9): Only thing I don't like is those occasional woop woops in the background.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Honestly I’m starting to think that the best Kylie songs are the meta ones that are literally *about* discos.

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.7): Yes! That's the disco guitar, strings and handclaps I love! Favourite on the album

**bbfan132** (8): the intro is kind of odd and it feels a bit repetitive but i like it overall

**daretheghost** (8): Cute lil dance bop.

**Parabox314** (8): The I will survive reference is nice.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): this is so cheesy i like it

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this song I find hilarious idk why and it also bops

**cherryices** (7.1): lost a point for the “woot woot” in the last chorus

**kirby31200** (7): Decent filler

**luckyphase** (7): fun

**pat-rickstar** (7): It’s a bop but a bit too frantic for me

#The lady said GO HOME!

**\_SoulGlitch** (6.5): I lowkey wish that intro had led to a piano-tinged sad bop instead that you could have still twerk your ass off to. The song itself is fine, I guess.

**EnCaine** (6.5): gets extra points for making me smile bc of the dumb subject matter

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Hmm....I am not sure about this one.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): this is groovy but...eh

**nooodisaster** (6): I thought this was gonna be a "who watches the watch men" thing, but its more "Fuck him he's a DJ"

**corrodedbeauty** (5): why is this album so lyrically subpar… this song is giving me Disney channel vibes

**JackStrait** (5): Liked the Gloria Gaynor reference, but the melody didn't grab me like some of the other songs

**LuisEnRod** (5): I’m not a fan of this super sped-up disco sound but go off sis

**buddhacharm** (4.5): Kylie said this song was "inspired" by Gloria Gaynor but it's actually inspired by fucking ugly

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): This just feels like it's being played sped up and not in the good way

**akanewasright** (4): …this is okay. There’s nothing really here. This is where the album actively started to drag for me, and it seems like I’m not alone in that sentiment

**jasannn** (4): This song gives me cringey soccer mom vibes.

**maxrocks329** (4): It's only 3 minutes but even that's too long

**bulforster** (3.3): Knockoff S Club 7

**runaway3212** (3): honestly stupid

**wavingwolves** (3): this song is like kids noticing that teachers have inner lives but if you're a cokehead who parties too much

**MrSwearword** (1): hate me later, this is just trash from the jump, iCannot.

**rose** (0): I don't necessarily think this is THAT bad for a 0 but why would she ruin a perfectly good disco album with this... why Kylie why

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Some will say that this is basically a 6-minute interlude and I'm not gonna argue. I still like it a lot.

**skargardin** (8): Fucking FINALLY our first main rate non-Kylie song is out! And it really is one of the least remarkable songs on Róisín Machine. Not really surprised at this since a lot of you were expecting it to actually go somewhere and then it just.. does not. Honestly I find it admirable that she chose to showcase some restraint in this song, I think it's a really cool element to keep the listener on their toes. I haven't really heard anything like this before. But admittedly it feels very much like an interlude at the end of the day so I think this is a fine placement overall. Maybe it deserved to go sooner even over some imo tragic DISCO cuts, but alas.

---

#In theeeeee Kiiiiiiiiingdoooooom of Eeeeendssss

**\_SoulGlitch** (10): If you listen to this with your eyes closed, you suddenly find yourself in the most intense guided meditation session.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is what Taylor Swift meant when she said “this sick beat”

**Flegasaurus** (10): yet another BANGER. i really appreciate the longer length of these songs

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I mean yeah, I get what she’s talking about with this one lol. I love how harsh and kinda sinister it sounds, not what you’d expect from a “disco” album but it works and it’s kinda cathartic in a way, plus it actually builds to something interesting.

**qazz23** (10): Good transition from the opener, love the backing vocals

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love how the relentless synth builds into an ominous, unsettling vibe, this is epic and fits seamlessly with the previous track

**shockdbinary** (10): the longer the progression, the more immersed my mind gets in that "indie" disco.

**waluigiest** (10): this sounds like when you party for so long the sun comes up again

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): so true king

**daretheghost** (9.5): Alexa play ‘All About That Bass’

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): the production here is so interesting

**bbfan132** (9): super trippy, i like it quite a bit!

**engifear** (9): Young dumb and full of cum, saur trew

**Exaltatus** (9): This is the kind of after party I wanna be invited to.

**jongin\_is\_shy** (9): A great successor to Simulation but can still be great if it wasn't?

**mudkip1** (9): her MIND her sheer POWER i kinda wish there was a sickening beat drop but roisin isn't your average basic queen, she has bigger plans in store

**plastichaxan** (9): after long thinking and listening i decided i love this after thinking i did but i also didn't

**ReallyCreative** (9): haunting and delicious

**runaway3212** (9): truly heavenly

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9): Kingdom*

**Chevsapher** (8.8): The track never really goes anywhere, but it does manage to create an interesting soundscape. Besides, I could listen to her talk for hours.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): idk what tf she’s saying but gurl I’m living

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this was an 8 at first but i kicked it up half a point for that excellent buildup that starts around 2.5 minutes into the song

**seanderlust** (8.5): I feel like I just joined a cult

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): If Donna Summer had a bad acid trip

**banananaise** (8): the intro to this track gets me goinnnnng

**frogaranaman** (8): our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. thy kingdom come, thy will be done, on earth as it is in heaven. give us this day our daily bread and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us. and lead us not into temptation and deliver us from evil, amen

**LazyDayLullaby** (8): Awesome transition from the opening track (but then again, this album is filled with seamless transitions)

**maxrocks329** (8): This whole album, and this song in particular, cultivates such a specific atmosphere and it's amazing.

**musical\_pyn** (8): has such an incredible atmosphere but unfortunately I feel like the payoff is found elsewhere on the album so I can’t rate it too high, but in the context of the album this works incredibly well

**wavingwolves** (8): "it's basically edging in musical form" as my good friend niki said

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song is perfect at what it sets out to do, but I have never quite been in the mood for it.

**jasannn** (7.5): This would be perfect for Halloween night at a gay club.

**TiltControls** (7.5): perfect transition into the song

**1998tweety** (7): i needed this to explode and then it didnt :/

**just\_thonking** (7): Kind of drags on

**lolcevan** (7): first time listening to this album and the transition into this song had me ASCENDING

**MrSwearword** (7): it's trippy as fuck and I like it but I wish the drums went harder or that it had something of a progression.

**nooodisaster** (7): The production is insane and so hypnotizing and there's like no sonic structure for 6 minutes.

**vayyiqra** (7): this is cool and all but it's a lot of buildup to go nowhere

**WillamThunderfuck** (7): It sounds cool, but I constantly have the feeling it's building up to something which doesn't really come?

#That's when we come to the endddd, hopefully 

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): very atmospheric and epic but… I can’t imagine listening to this outside context of the album at all

**cremeebrulee** (6): probably my only dud on this album :deadbanana:

**KennyEarthman** (6): has an atmosphere of an abandoned disco bar

**KuhBus** (6): Witchy vibes.

**proscett** (6): i could listen to that bassline forever, and that is exactly how long it goes on for

**Vromega** (6): what is happening here I really don't get it

**Stryxen** (5.5): love this woman but she is starting to scare me now

**celladonn** (5): More like Kingdom Of Never Ends

**luckyphase** (5): white noise for the brain

**ManofOranges** (5): This one kind of just exists to me.

**ACORGIORGY** (4): the payoff is not worth the buildup at all

**RandomHypnotica** (4): This was a painful 6 minutes, the track never goes anywhere, it feels like a series of weird surreal chants and droning synths, and it's just an overall unpleasant experience.

**targetguest** (4): I won't give a song a zero

**booksandplantsand** (3): i have never vibed with this one and i always skip when I listen through

**brenda\_official** (0): 6 minutes of build up to nothing. dont know what she was thinking with this one

**Brendon-Urine** (0): this sounds so cheap to me, like the mixing (especially those synths) are just so bad imo. and the song goes absolutely nowhere, it's a 6 minute long interlude.

**jayjaysortagay** (0): I don't get it :(

**lagozzino** (0): An absolute nothing of a song

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I had I Love It on repeat back when it came out, but have hardly returned to it since the album dropped, even though I still like the song a lot. A great pre-release single that sounds like classic Kylie.

**skargardin** (8): Aaaand we're right back on our bullshit!! Thought Kylie was getting a break, did you? I don't love this song as much as some other songs on DISCO, but it is still a ton of fun, especially the strings which i loooove, hah!!

---

#I LOVE IT

**bespectacIed** (10): Kylie when asked who's the buzzcut girl with superpowers on stranger things

**hikkaru** (10): woo-ah! kim petras found dead

**jexan13** (10): the strings on this is soooooo damn addictive. I get immediatly happy

**ManofOranges** (10): The violins in this one are KILLING me OMG

**Misentro** (10): I love it (Woo! Ahh)

**MrSwearword** (10): I went from not being into this song to realizing that of the singles/promo singles to date, this is the one that's the most disco.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I do 10ve it, this is so breezy and charismatic

**Chevsapher** (9.6): The songwriting is a bit clunky sometimes, and the vocal production feels rough. My brain knows that, but my heart doesn't care; this is one of my moet-streamed songs of all time. The bassline is warm but punchy, the hook is fun, and the ad libs near the end are the cherry on top. I've always wondered if this track was inspired by Miami Sound Machine with the horn parts and the “come on let the music play" bit.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): the chorus is so good

**artzpop** (9): sooooo good

**KennyEarthman** (9): that chorus is oddly familiar

**proscett** (9): ugh these strings scalp me every time

**TiltControls** (9): title

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): fun as hell all the way through

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I fell in love with this one when it dropped but it doesn't quite stand up with a little time. Still a bop

**WillamThunderfuck** (8.5): I love it

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): when your album is flopping so you resort to subliminal messaging

**luckyphase** (8): 😭

**musical\_pyn** (8): strong intro but the rest of the song doesn’t quite match it

**runaway3212** (8): Charli outsold

#I think it's fine

**bulforster** (7.8): The most representative track on the album: slick if a bit basic production, pretty good but not great.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.5): love this on my running playlist tbh

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): She crashed her car into a bridge and she doesn’t care

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.1): I don't love it, but I do like it

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): I don’t think popheads will love this enough to send it to Day 2, let alone Day 3.

**akanewasright** (7): a cute track. if I had more affection for this, I’d probably score it higher

**corrodedbeauty** (7): icona pop + charli xcx outsold

**daretheghost** (7): It’s fine.

**KuhBus** (7): Beautiful, but a bit too repetitive for its length.

**nooodisaster** (7): okay, THIS is disco [this song feels like its been a disco classic for years that's just been dug up again. it's not a GREAT classic, but still.]

**vayyiqra** (7): I crashed my car into the bridge, I don't care! I love it! but not this song alas.

**qazz23** (7): I like it, but not quite love it

**lolcevan** (6.5): i think she loves it guys

**kirby31200** (6.5): I don't love it but I don't hate it either

#Thanks, I hate it

**AHSWeeknd** (6): Apparently we have different tastes… I don’t love it.

**Leixander** (6): the chorus is so lazy, could be done so much better

**pietrohonkhonk** (6): I Don’t Love It

**wavingwolves** (6): i thought this fucking song was big in popheads, what the fuck are you doing???????

**EnCaine** (5): like, it's not bad but it just feels so inconsequential

**Flegasaurus** (5): i don't love it

**frogaranaman** (5): you’re on a different road, I’m in the Milky Way

**maxrocks329** (5): I don't love it. How many other people made the same joke? Probably a lot

**Alumineous** (4): In this song, Kylie tries to convince herself that her album is the shit.

**booksandplantsand** (4): this one suffers from being an earworm I don't enjoy :/

**seanderlust** (4): (insert I dont love it joke here sorry i'm tired)

**Stryxen** (4): if i ever went outside this would probably be higher

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i thought this song was fucking big in... i cant think of anything funny just pretend i said something funny

**skargardin** (8): I'm honestly stunned that this made it this far. I thought for sure that this was going to be among the first songs out. But I guess no one hates it like that and just overall it seems to be kind of underestimated as it managed to beat a large chunk of DISCO songs. I have seen next to no discussion about this pre-reveal honestly sjfgs. This is another pleasant song that I mostly enjoy on the album context as it has the "keep on.."s that call back to Murphy's Law. 

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Game Changer is rather unfortunately stuck in the middle of four monstrous tracks, so its tepedity doesn't let it stand out from the rest of the album. It's a solid tune, nonetheless. The sudden "keep on" repetition in the middle of the song shook me to the core when I first heard it, and, oddly enough, this soundbite can be traced all the way back to Ramalama (Bang Bang).

---

#She changed the game

**Flegasaurus** (10): the synths.. omg..................... game? changed

**Leixander** (10): This grew on me a lot since release, a highlight for sure.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): she really is one huh

**EnCaine** (9.2): realizing róisín murphy might be the coolest woman on the planet

**booksandplantsand** (9): a hazy auditory cocoon

**LazyDayLullaby** (9): Her voice is a game changer, and I love the way this song layers multiple Róisíns with ethereal synths. Very lush, and a sort of calm before the next two bangers

**seanderlust** (9): god I love the synths playing triplets

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Sierra Dawn Thomas is shaking

**sirpancakeXI** (9): the lyrics might be a bit repetitive but who care when it is still a bop.

**bbfan132** (8.5): that synth along with her vocals make the song

**Chevsapher** (8.5): Another track that doesn't really go anywhere, but it's chock-full of fun production. I enjoy that the "keep on, keep on, keep on” hook from “Murphy's Law” makes a cameo.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): when i got a dual monitor

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): the echoing reprise of "keep on, keep on, keep on!" is a highlight but otherwise this is just lovely background music

**runaway3212** (8.5): This has grown on me

**AHSWeeknd** (8): this whole album is a game changer.

**bespectacIed** (8): i love future bass

**bigbigbee** (8): I love the triplet beat of this. I haven’t heard a lot of Roisin’s music before this, just a few songs off of Ruby Blue, but this song reminds me most of the songs I’ve heard before.

**musical\_pyn** (8): would be higher if the song went somewhere

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): I wasn’t really vibing with this one. I felt like it lacked something and the synths became rather distracting halfway through the song.

**daretheghost** (7): The only track on the album I could do without.

**KennyEarthman** (7): it goes nowhere, but I love the vibe it gives off

**ManofOranges** (7): When I get a blue shell in Mario Kart

**proscett** (7): i always zone out during this

**qazz23** (7): Weakest of the album, just feels very repetitive

**Stryxen** (7): the way she howls so primally at the start always catches me off guard

**Turpamutteri** (7): This is fine but kinda forgettable

**vayyiqra** (7): Look, this is fine, but all of the songs on this album are so repetitive I'm tempted to skip it to finish the rate on time. (But I won't because skipping songs is for the WEAK)

#trip the station, change the channel

**bulforster** (6.6): The "1, 2 buckle my shoe"-like flow takes me out.

**1998tweety** (6.5): hello first out

**frogaranaman** (6): I wanna be your endgame

**jasannn** (6): Not a game changer.

**Misentro** (6): I really can't tell if I love or hate this song. "The game changed / You changed the game" sounds so goofy, and it really shouldn't work on paper, but something about it is really captivating.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The chorus has no right being that good. An instantly catchy earworm that's definitely getting robbed. 😭

**skargardin** (10): Fucking mega robbed honestly!! Kylie channelled her very best ABBA esque energy for this banging song, especially the chorus, and I absolutely love every second of this. Definitely deserved better than Day 1 you all are sick for this. Random thought, but I think this song could work so well in a drag performance, as it has the perfect bassline for a runway walk.

---

#BOP ALERT

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Bop of the century, this gets stuck in my head way too often.

**akanewasright** (10): I’ve said this a few times, but this sounds exactly like the kind of song my abusive high school choreographer would stan. Unfortunately we have very similar music taste, but thankfully he hasn’t ruined this one for me (yet, I still occasionally worry about him coming back into my life)

**cremeebrulee** (10): the chorus is so high energy it really makes the song

**Exaltatus** (10): Kylie continuing to serve you bops.

**Misentro** (10): Can't even put into words how badly this song makes me want to dance

**musical\_pyn** (10): this might be my favorite song on the album

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.7): THIS IS SO FUN AND GAY!!!!!!!!!!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): Kylie said she was inspired by ABBA and I totally hear it, very cute bop

**Chevsapher** (9.4): The ABBA influence is palpable. Another incredibly solid album cut that could have been a single.

**daretheghost** (9): I know I’m not the first to liken this to ‘Voulez-Vous,’ but.

**Vromega** (9): BOP. This chorus is perfect.

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): the mods to me after I post an "folklore appreciation thread" that installs malware that replaces all of Taylor's music with Folklore by Nelly Fertado

**banananaise** (8.5): i said this before but the chorus kind of reminds me of Take Me Back To Your House by Basement Jaxx and i love it

**bbfan132** (8.5): i really like the energy here, it builds up quickly and doesn’t let up throughout

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Why is this album so much better than I remembered?

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Yasss we stan using "supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" in a lyric for a disco pop song!

**Leixander** (8): very cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute but definitely not a standout

**LazyDayLullaby** (7.3): Last Chants

**\_SoulGlitch** (7): A little forgettable but cute nonetheless.

**booksandplantsand** (7): uptempo and fun!

**Flegasaurus** (7): my last chance to actually turn in my ballot for the nu-disco rate we believe in me

**KennyEarthman** (7): really old school disco

**MrSwearword** (7): I don't use this as much as any other DISCO or One True Kylie fans might, but I get its appeal.

**runaway3212** (7): Not bad but could've been better

**TheCatWithoutAName** (7): Kylie says last chance 29 times in this song. Yes, I counted. Yes, it's stuck in my head.

**vayyiqra** (7): The prechorus kind of sounds like "Hallucinate" and it drives me up the wall but still this kind of bops. In fact, it just sounds like a Future Nostalgia reject on every level, but it's okay enough.

#Last chance to give it a good score!!!

**maxrocks329** (6): This just reminds me of a different, better song that I can't quite place. Maybe something by ABBA? Either way, this song doesn't have whatever that one does.

**nooodisaster** (6): The hook is hooky. But overall this album can feel kinda blunt and hurried, and I definitely feel it here. This feels like the demo of a good song.

**Parabox314** (6): Not really feeling the vibe.

**proscett** (6): forgettable but still cute

**EnCaine** (5.5): ehhhh

**JackStrait** (5.5): I can really hear some ABBA influence on this one

**Awkward\_King** (5): last dance outsold

**ManofOranges** (5): I feel like Kylie was very bold having a song about a last chance for a dance on an album called "DISCO" because all it does is remind me that there is a much better disco song about a last chance to dance and that song is "Last Dance" by Donna Summer and you know what lemme go listen to that song right now.

**Stryxen** (5): i liked about half of the things in the song and equally disliked about half the things in this song

**wavingwolves** (5): i just wish this had a stronger chorus

**bulforster** (4.5): Her vocals are quite grating here.

**Alumineous** (4): This is the last time I'm gonna listen to this.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Dare I say that this song name is camp? Yes, I do dare to. Shellfish Mademoiselle is a campy song name. Albeit the track itself is not *that* campy,

**skargardin** (10): In the words of Róisín herself: *How could you*? This is the last cut of day 1 and this stings, it really does. I think this really is a poignant song in the pandemic era especially considering how the dance floors are all empty as she sings in the chorus "how dare you sentence me / to a lifetime without dancing / when my body's built for feeling?" Also the title is the biggest serve of the century noitstrue, a ten for that alone!

#I'm totally in love with you, I'm head over heels

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THIS IS DISCO. Go listen to actual disco songs and you’ll find this.

**buddhacharm** (10): A moment most pleasing to me in my career! This song is so colorful, kaleidoscopic and whimsical but it's also like...very lowkey? Her mind

**MrSwearword** (10): OH MY FUCKING GOD this is like if the universe of River City Ransom had a gay bar in it. SLAY.

**wavingwolves** (10): suddenly i'm not allergic to shellfish anymore

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): Boom boom baby, pick you up in my Mercedes, I’mma be a little shellfish, be a little shellfish

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): makes me feel like i'm in a spacey lounge

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Frustration, playfulness, dismissiveness, cautious joy—so much is happening at the same time.

**bbfan132** (9): best song title ever

**cremeebrulee** (9): what a title lmao

**daretheghost** (9): I don’t know what shellfish have to do with anything but girl, I am living.

**nooodisaster** (9): "How dare you sentence me/To a lifetime without dancing" is such a mic-drop of a line.

**ReallyCreative** (9): a little bit of a sonic shift but definitely a pleasant one

**TheCatWithoutAName** (9): To this day, I still don't know wtf this song title means...but anyways timeless banger

**LazyDayLullaby** (8.7): Róisín Murphy knows how to make a great song title

**artzpop** (8.6): so cute

**1998tweety** (8.5): hold awn this bops a bit

**bulforster** (8.5): I love the hyperactive bass and claps on this one.

**Stryxen** (8.5): this is where the album really starts going

**jackisboredtoday** (8): this baseline is so good

**Parabox314** (8): The transition into this song leaves me wet.

**runaway3212** (8): this is really fun

**vayyiqra** (8): What a silly title ! She is so quirky ! :zany_face: Love her !

**waluigiest** (8): 🦀🦀🦀

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): The instrumental sounds like it would play in a menu in Gran Turismo

**banananaise** (7.5): i understand the title is a pun but i also imagine an Irish version of Miss Baltimore Crabs every time i read it

**EnCaine** (7.2): a bit of a low moment tbh but still full of personality

**booksandplantsand** (7): bubbly and nice

**Exaltatus** (7): It's not that I don't like it, I do, I just think the rest of the album's better.

**KennyEarthman** (7): I vibe with this one

**maxrocks329** (7): By far the weakest song on the album, but it's still a 7/10 because this entire album is just that amazing.

**mudkip1** (7): the transition from something more into this??!?!?! WHAT!!!

**musical\_pyn** (7): the first song I’m kinda meh on, don’t really have a strong connection to this one

**shesdoingyoga** (7): My brain refuses to read this as anything other than Selfish

**rickikardashian** (6.5): like 50% of this album is waiting for the thing to actually start

**frogaranaman** (6): anybody in this chat got a shellfish allergy

**proscett** (6): the weakest song on the album, but still preferable to most of DISCO

**JackStrait** (5): Might get murdered for this comment, but a bunch of these songs start interesting, but then they don't develop enough to keep me engaged.

**jasannn** (5): I wish the song was as much of a serve as its title.

**ManofOranges** (5): Shellfish Mademoiselle is what you call the lobster protagonist of Dua's "we're good" video

**Vromega** (5): I hate the clapping on the background

**LuisEnRod** (4): I don’t like songs with weird beats, I love me my 4/4

**Brendon-Urine** (3): the bass line is sick and a worthy contender in this rate, shame every other element is meh to bad.

cloudbustingmp3: everyone complaining about Adore You is ugly btw, just say you don’t understand love and keep it moving

vagenda: I really thought slowsongphobia would get Adore You today but she just stays winning (I called it out as a song I wouldn't mind seeing go just cause I'd already braced myself for it but I did give it like a 9 lmao)

I'd say I'm sorry, Hypnotica, but your Roisin scores prevent me from doing that.

artzpop: God damn this, apparently, is NOT a Kylie safe zone. Hate to see Fine Wine, Monday Blues and especially I Love It leave with so little grace.. well at least Miss A Thing is still in..

fairytalehigh: I'll be honest, I've been a pophead for a while now and while I saw rates getting posted/mentioned a lot, I never really looked into it until today. I'm pissed I missed out on this one because a) I have a LOT of opinions about these albums and b) these comments have me crying. I'll have to join in next time!

andrewno8do: Hi I am just here to campaign on behalf of Dance Floor Darling. Where Lady Gaga’s Sine From Above evokes the true essence of 90s pop in the final moments, Dance Floor Darling does the same with the Daft Punk-esque feel of the early 2000s. When we speak of nu-disco, we mustn’t forget the “nu-“ aspect, and I think it’s important to respect and celebrate the efforts made by artists who attempted to revitalize the disco sound when it was not popular to do so. A vote for Dance Floor Darling is a vote for the true definition of this particular prompt. VOTE DANCE FLOOR DARLING.
