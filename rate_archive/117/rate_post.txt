Hello everyone and welcome to [the 2020 Nu-Disco Rate](https://imgur.com/a/fwUx3NI) hosted by yours truly and /u/ElizabethDDoS! But before we get into the albums we will be rating, how about some good old genre discourse?

***

[**What is nu-disco?**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/575930044212576271/811673635860774917/isthisdisco.jpg)

If you have been a part of the pop music conversation for the past year, you have undoubtedly heard of the so-called "disco revival" term being thrown left and right, sometimes with, but more often than not, without the right intent.

Nu-Disco is not anything new and the term has existed since the mid 90s to describe music that calls back to the classic disco era. "Nu" refers to a modern take on something, which in Nu-Disco's case is 70s disco. Nu-Disco is therefore not about replicating the sound of the 70s, but rather incorporating elements of it in fresh, modern takes. Nu-Disco influences can be everything from euro dance, heavy synths, electro, house, just to name a few genres. Drums and synthesizers are a heavy part of Nu-Disco as well. All of this is just scratching the surface of what entails the genre, but it's just to give you all an idea of where the genre is coming from.

We will be rating three contemporary women who have all made their unique take on the current Nu-Disco wave with stellar results. So strap on your best dancing shoes and get comfy in your kitchen disco because these albums are sure to make you want to dance!

## [**Jessie Ware - What’s Your Pleasure?**](https://imgur.com/E9xasZ3)

[~~She’s on the download. Podcast queen and singing sensation Jessie Ware is here!~~](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/575930044212576271/816012338343837766/154969839_576908776600062_934255730549085587_n.png)

Rising singer-songwriter star Jessie Ware stands as a relative newcomer to the dance-pop and nu-disco scene, at least in comparison to the other two artists in this rate. That’s not to say that she’s a newcomer to the music scene at all. Originally she got her career start doing background vocals for the likes of SBTRKT and DJ Joker, while also appearing as a background vocalist for Florence and the Machine on *Ceremonials*,  Her fourth studio album, *What's Your Pleasure?*, sees her doing an evolution from her early soulful, adult-contemporary oriented albums ["Devotion"](https://imgur.com/c1CPXPG), ["Tough Love"](https://imgur.com/24XoGKv) and ["Glasshouse"](https://imgur.com/siTxN8q), to becoming a fully fledged disco diva. The album is filled with mature themes and Jessie songwriting is as strong as ever, with themes such as lust, sex and temptation being explored. [In an interview with Glamour UK](https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/jessie-ware-glamour-cover-interview-2020), Jessie jokingly said that she wanted to make a record for people to have sex to, a statement that can hardly be denied listening to the album. 

What's Your Pleasure? was released to critical acclaim, reviews praising Jessie Ware’s new direction while still staying true to her artistry. Additionally, the album appeared at the top of several year-end album lists.

## [**Kylie Minogue - DISCO**](https://imgur.com/WBcz3ty)

Feigning all the subtlety in the world, pop music icon Kylie Minogue has named her 15th studio album *DISCO*, yes, stylized in all caps, as if it wasn't clear from the starry, glittery and sequins-filled album cover of what direction she was going for. Following a decade of sonical detours with the EDM-tinged *Kiss Me Once*, the country-pop flavoured *Golden*, *DISCO* sees Kylie finally make her proper return to dance-pop.

DISCO was largely produced and finished during the quarantine season, with Kylie learning to engineer her own vocals from her home studio. With DISCO, she yet again proves that she's excellent at crafting albums that are so utterly fun. Kylie has taken some inspiration from the classic disco era for this album, DISCO having nods to Donna Summer, ABBA and Gloria Gaynor just to name a few. 

DISCO is a milestone album in Kylie's career, as the album debuted at #1 in the UK and Kylie thus became the first female solo artist to have a #1 album in five different decades, the only other artist to achieve the feat being Bruce Springsteen.

## [**Róisín Murphy - Róisín Machine**](https://imgur.com/wjB5s14)

Irish singer and producer Róisín Murphy has had a career spanning decades in music, first becoming known in the 90s as the vocalist of the iconic duo Moloko (do yourself a favour and familiarize yourself with ["Sing It Back"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1eN8vyVFIM) and ["The Time Is Now"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-GY9DWIfpwc) if you haven't) and has since then embarked on a solo career spanning five full-length albums, the latest of the bunch being titled *Róisín Machine*.

Róisín Machine is the result of nearly a decade's work, with the release of "Simulation" going as far back as 2012. The pre-release singles have all received a new coat of paint on the album, which is crafted as a singular, continuous mix. Róisín is no stranger to pushing pop music to its very sharp edges, Róisín Machine being no exception. There are stark contrast such as with the maximalist "We Got Together" and the more subdued "Shellfish Mademoiselle". There are elements of experimental pop, house, disco, etc. which all blends together beautifully thanks to Róisín's vision. Róisín Machine has many production quirks and quips that will have the listener coming back for repeat listens to really soak it all in. Róisín Machine became Róisín’s biggest charting hit to date, as it debuted in the top 20 of the UK albums chart. 

Tracklist:

1. [Simulation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k5D2K889XBc)
2. [Kingdom of Ends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YOib86q90JM)

Please note that **you do not have to do this rate**, it is entirely optional. But it is more fun if you do it. You do not have to rate every song, and **you can not give any of these songs your 0 or 11.** 

***

**The Rules**

If you’re new to rates or simply need a refresher of the rules, here they are.

* **Listen to every song listed and assign them a score of 1 to 10**. Decimals of one are fine, but don't go past that - 6.5 is fine, 6.54 is not.
* **Rate all (38) songs in the main rate!** If you skip any songs, your ballot will not be counted. If your ballot is missing a score, I will message you repeatedly until you fix the errors.
* It is highly recommended, but not required, to write comments after your scores! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart’s desire, here are some examples:  
`Spotlight (Jessie): 10 Rupaul outsold`  
`Spotlight (Kylie): 10 Greatest song ever recorded I think!`  
**This is the only way your comments should be formatted, any other format crashes the system.** You may also leave a comment for an album! To do so you simply add a colon after the album title and type, same as song comments!
* **You may give ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11** across the entire rate, **not** per album. These scores should be reserved for your least and most favourite songs in the rate. **You must leave a comment for these scores.** You are not required to use these scores if you don't want to.
* **Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.** Feel free to share them and campaign for your favorite song to win and bully those who are more tasteless than you 
* Please use the prepared link to send in your scores! Every other format crashes the system we run to compute the scores. Your ballot should not be edited in any way other than adding scores and comment, **please include the entire ballot even if you don't do the bonus rate!** We’ve prepared [a pastebin](https://pastebin.com/mEqapjQD) should the submission link not work as intended.
* **Don't sabotage!** It goes without saying that you can't give an album a significantly lower score than the othhers without any justification at all! I WILL NOT accept your scores if I suspect you of willfully sabotaging an album's scores!
* **You may change your scores at any time before the deadline!** If you want to change your score after you've submitted, feel free to message me /u/skargardin and I will make the changes!
