2020 Ultimate Pitchfork Acclaim (Fiona Apple / HAIM / Phoebe Bridgers)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mjy31r/2020_ultimate_pitchfork_acclaim_fiona_apple_haim/

Hello, ladies ladies ladies ladies and, of course, non-ladies too. Welcome to the **2020 Ultimate Pitchfork Acclaim Rate**, hosted by yours truly and u/SideBTrack8! 

This month, we will be rating three widely critically acclaimed alternative albums by women in music, who were also all curiously nominated for Best Rock Performance at the 63rd Grammy Awards ~~but fuck the Grammys, actually~~. The albums we will be rating were all denominated Best New Music by Pitchfork last year, which is where our title comes from. Even more recently, at 2021 Grammys, Fiona Apple was able to snatch a couple of awards from both HAIM and Phoebe, but will we see a reprise of that happening here? Join and find out! 

***

If you're ready to listen to sad alternative music and give each song a score without having to sit through a bunch of album descriptions I wrote at the middle of the night, you can just go ahead! Just make sure to carefully check the rules at the bottom of the post.

# Fiona Apple - Fetch The Bolt Cutters

One of the most prestigious and critically acclaimed singer-songwriters of all time, Fiona Apple makes her comeback with her fifth album *Fetch The Bolt Cutters*. The title was inspired by a specific scene from the crime drama series The Fall, where a sex-crimes investigator says the line "fetch the bolt cutters" while in a crime scene in which a woman was brutally tortured. Fiona has explained the title saying it's supposed inspire listeners, and herself, to ["fetch your tool of liberation and set yourself free."](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/22/841401198/fetch-your-tool-of-liberation-fiona-apple-on-setting-herself-free).

The album deals with themes such as gender dynamics, sexual assault, oppression, jealousy, bullying, freedom and liberation. Sonically, it features a lot of conventional instruments, but it also uses non-musical objects as percussion. It was fully recorded on Fiona's home and you can even hear her dogs in a few points throughout the record. It's usually seen as strange and at times hard to digest experience, but it's surely an unique one. It's as necessary and warm as a hug and as brutal and unflinching as a punch. 

If you are curious about the Pitchfork review, you can find it [here](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/fiona-apple-fetch-the-bolt-cutters/). *Fetch The Bolt Cutters* received a full 10 from them ~~and it was deserved.~~

# HAIM - Women In Music Pt. III

The queens of long walks around urban scenarios came back with a wide-ranging sophisticated album! The American soft rock band, consisting of the multi-instrumentalist sisters Este, Danielle and Alana, has proven to know how to make deliciously catchy and heart wrenching tunes. In their third album, we find them in their most honest and emotional form, while also branching out and experimenting more sonically. It all comes together to create their most intimate and complex body of work yet, and yes, it's great. 

Filled with remarkable melodies, memorable guitar riffs and intricate production choices, *Women In Music Pt. III* is a celebration of the complexity of relationships, both the one we have with ourselves and the ones we have with others. With songs that deal with subjects such as death, illness, depression, sex and love, this album feels vast and warm in every way possible. I personally recommend to take a walk while playing it, it makes you appreciate the world and the music differently.

# Phoebe Bridgers - Punisher

With the release of her heart-wrenching sophomore album, Phoebe Bridgers made a lot of us amazed. Just like the two previous albums, *Punisher* also presents multi-dimensional songwriting with a more broad sound. It features tracks that take direct inspiration from the candid and gut-wrenching style of Elliott Smith, pairing it with a fuller rock sound and her folk roots. 

After fully experimenting with indie rock in two different projects, [Boygenius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZlR6DjehDc) and [Better Oblivion Community Center](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXzReYLuavg), the singer-songwriter came back with a record full of unique story with small details what will make you understand her in a way you are not able to understand yourself. 

If you want to know what Pitchfork had to say about it, you can check it out [here](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/phoebe-bridgers-punisher/). It features a nice 8.7 score. 


Tracklist:

2. [Garden Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1u8rIx65QgA)

**These songs are not eligible for 0s or 11s and you don't need to do this rate.** It's merely a way of rating some jams that couldn't be included in the main rate. Are you going to miss the chance to rate the REAL Shameika? Nah, you won't.

And please, **make sure to include the bonus rate in your ballot even if it's not filled in!** I explain more about it below.

# Rules

And now, the not so fun part... to participate you'll have to carefully read and follow all of these instructions: 

* **You must listen and rate to ALL the songs listed.** If your ballot has songs without scores it won't be eligible. 

* **Each song should be assigned a score of 1 to 10.** You can use decimals of one, but don't go too crazy: a score of 9.9 is fine and dandy, but we won't accept 9.87 or 9.955. 

* **You are invited to assign ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11.** These are valid for the whole rate and not one per album and it not includes the bonus rate. It's not obligatory and it should be given to songs you might have strong feelings for, that being positive or negative. 

* **Scores of 0 and 11 require comments!** Comments are generally greatly recommended and appreciated, even if *not entirely* obligatory! You may share anything you want as a comment for any of the songs,  **but if you don't include a comment with your 11 or 0 the ballot will be rejected.** Your comments should be made by adding a space after the score and then typing it out whatever you might  want to share. Here are some CORRECT examples, **any other format besides this will get your ballot reject**:

	> Relay: 10 If all sports were like this song I would be a fitness queen  
	> 3 AM: 3 Halsey outsold  
	> Halloween: 7 I prefer Christmas, actually  


* **You can also make comments on the album overall.** For that you just need to write your comment right after the name of the album on the *album* line. This is the correct format and anything different from this is **wrong**:

	> Album: Fetch The Bolt Cutters: Left me crying on the bathroom floor, 10/10 would do it again.
	> Album: Women In Music Pt. III: The summer summer album of 2020!
	> Album: Punisher: No words to describe how much I have cried to this.

	Make sure your ballot follows this exact format and **include the entire ballot even if you don't do the bonus rate!** We've even have a [pastebin](https://pastebin.com/JdwxZ98e) should the submissions link not work correctly.

* **Your scores are NOT confidential!** They will be shared on the reveal and you can campaign for any song you would like. Let your taste be known, for better or worse.

* **Don't sabotage!** We will keep an eye out for absurdly low ratings, especially if they have no comments justifying why. If we deem that you're actively trying to sabotage the rate, we will question you and potentially turn down your ballot.

* **You may change your scores at any time before the deadline!** A song that you rated a 3 grew to an 8? Great! You can just message me here and I will change it for you.
