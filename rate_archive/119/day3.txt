**SideBTrack8** (9.5): When I first heard this song I actually really didn't like it. I just felt like such a departure from the other singles, and the pitched up vocals felt so grating. But the more I listened to it the more I fell in love, and now it's one of my favourites on the album. It hits especially hard after the year we've all had.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): I really thought this would do better, so this being placed here is very much a surprise. It's very loved and wildly appreciated, but I think not enough to be scored over other songs. I personally love the lyrics in this and I can tell why so many consider this the definitive quarantine bop. Still, while I love most of the songs, I don't like every choice in this and I still have problems with the highly autotuned vocals at the breakdown of the song. It doesn't take away my enjoyment that much, but it's still something I can't get totally behind on.

---

# Know everything

**babygrillx** (11): the bangerest banger of all 2020 bangers

**RobbersbyThe1975** (11): A massive bop, with probably the catchiest hook in this rate. Definitely one of HAIM's absolute best songs.

**xcjm** (11): !!!!

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): My boyfriend asked me if this song was Charli one time when I played it in the car. Thought I'd share.

**bespectacIed** (10): The chokehold this song had on me last year... This is HAIM's greatest song. The girls scalped me with this one. i know alone like no one else does, so true besties

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): "Yes, I listen to experimental music."

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): okay same

**conceptualromance** (10): this is one of those songs that’s so perfect, you can’t believe it didn’t exist already

**cremeebrulee** (10): need two other bitches to learn this choreo with me

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): There have been many songs made about being alone but HAIM really hit the nail with this one personally. Being lonely is not a unique experience but it's something that feels very personal in the sense that my definition of being lonely is quite unique to me. What makes this song so relatable is that loneliness makes me forget about the concept of time as pointed out in the lyrics "'Cause nights turn into days / That turn to grey / Keep turning over". I am so thankful of HAIM for writing this song that very much summarizes my own experiences with loneliness.

**ggal2020** (10): I once listened to this 20 times in a day

**hunnybee12** (10): how prophetic for 2020 release

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Can I just talk about the music video? I'll do it anyway. It's so simple yet so entertaining. They got the moves and they got me moving. This is a bop.

**leviswift13** (10): ultimate depression quarantine lonely spiral

**llieno94** (10): a poignant and melancholy meditation on isolation and depression. The last 60 seconds where the song slows down and fades only to kick back in and repeat the title over and over is the best part.

**ManofOranges** (10): The way this song perfectly describes the nights I would spend alone in my apartment, wallowing in my own sorrow...

**nishidahall** (10): Even more of A Vibe

**OberionSynth** (10): after losing most of my friends during lockdown bc i had to move back home, i relate to this song a little too much rn

**plastichaxan** (10): get that tiktok choreo queens

**proscett** (10): let's stare into the void now i guess

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is definitely the most standard "pop" song on this record, and whilst I do love that part of it, the lyrics really just hit hard as well, that feeling of loneliness is captured perfectly.

**runaway3212** (10): bitch me too dafug, ME TOO HAHA YOU AINT SPECIAL

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I think we ALL know alone these days… and that’s why this song is a mood

**sarcasticsobs** (10): so i’ve really been missing out on this “HAIM” thing, huh?

**shhhneak** (10): I’ll always associate this song with my stupid little quarantine walks.

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): My quarantine anthem.

**wasian-invasion** (10): me stuck in my tiny studio working from home for all of 2020

**savemeaseat143** (9.5): fantastic chorus

**CzrLandWhale** (9): I don't trust people who don't like this song.

**just\_thonking** (9): just realized the irony in them singing "I know alone like no one else does" all together in a sort of chorus. It's like we each sing along to it thinking "no one is alone the way I am," not realizing that we're literally not alone in this feeling because everyone else is lonely and singing along too. Pls tell me that made sense

**skargardin** (9): me during the entire pandemic

**steelstepladder** (9): This album is filled with tracks that shouldn't work as well as they do

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): the original quarantine anthem. love the garage-inspired beats too

**Turpamutteri** (9): I need more songs about being lonely

**jman457** (8.6): Love the charli xcx feature

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): is this garage?

**bbfan132** (8.5): this would be better if the production didn’t sound so muffled

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): lot to like here, but I really enjoy the both sides now reference

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): This seems a bit out of place on the album but it’s not bad at all.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I like this title, it has four vowels.

**Alumineous** (8): Sounds like Bleachers.

**bulforster** (8): If Ariel and Danielle get married, he should take her name so he can be an official HAIM member because his vocals in this outro are beautiful.

**fadedblue09** (8): Not fond of the tin-can vocals but it's catchy and the lyrics capture the feeling of being burned out

**iniekcja\_** (8): I guess it's supposed to be like that, but the bridge is just so apathetic

**kirby31200** (8): Torn between loving and hating the weird robot voice

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): quarantine anthem

**thedoctordances1940** (8): It's a really good song but I'm not all too keen on the mixing of the vocals

**Uberpigeon** (8): oh this one actually slaps

**vayyiqra** (8): oh this is a song about depression good I love it

# Know nothing, not even alone 

**nick1372** (7.5): Would be a 10 if it wasn’t for the outro

**1998tweety** (7): shes boppy but some of the lines in the weird voice took me out a bit

**akanewasright** (7): bizarre choreography intensifies

**CrimsonROSET** (7): it’s friday friday gotta get down on friday

**waluigiest** (7): beat shift aw yes

**notoriouspge** (6.5): sorry y'all kinda don't like the pitched-up vocals; pales in comparison especially when this song's surrounded by amazing

**kappyko** (6): this is so uncomfortable sounding. theres neat stuff going on but rostam did something stupid here which sucks cuz the concept of an atlanta bass (i know its more of a garage beat but whatever) / arthur russell haim song is sooooo good

**NotWith10000Men** (6): vibey but too muddled for me

**Stryxen** (6): I Know Alone that this is overrated

**jayjaysortagay** (5): not that bandcamp drum n bass beat

**flavasavavandal** (1): Please delete the vocal effects from my memory immediately

**wavingwolves** (10): I don't even know if it's insanity to say this, but I find this weirdly... romantic. It's just such a raw and honest portrayal of relationship expectations and I find very reassuring to know that Fiona has the same kind of worries I have about it. Sonically, this as interesting and powerful as the rest of the album. The way it builds and climaxes gives me life every time I hear it. Just... ugh!!!! No words left.

**SideBTrack8** (9): I adore the delivery of the chorus, especially at the end where she goes from shouting to whispering. The fact that she wrote this for a movie and they didn't even use it?? Their loss I guess.

---

# Started off, started off, started off, baaaby

**a8i13** (11): Her voice has never been better switching from rage to vulnerability to apathy all in a single line

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (11): Banger and a half! Just the perfect melding of melody and experimental production. Sometimes the album becomes too obtuse for me to latch onto, but this song makes that balance seem effortless.

**theburningundead** (11): I expected to have a hard time picking an 11 in this rate given all the great songs but after listening to the three albums again this was a clear standout. The combination of intensity and vulnerability and that build to the final post-chorus are executed so perfectly that I couldn't go with anything else.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I had to look up what that meant.

**bbfan132** (10): START START START START!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): the gradual realization that this isn't a romantic song whew

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): when she does the velociraptor sound... yes

**cremeebrulee** (10): its a tad overrated by fiona fans but its still very good

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): A massive grower!

**endcreditouilles** (10): wow go off!!! The vocals, the lyrics, the production, the composition, the flow, the balance, the emotion, the build, 10/10 on everything. The pulled back parts almost feel like a Rebecca Sugar/Adventure Time song (in the best way).

**fadedblue09** (10): I cannot believe that this was one of my least fave tracks at some point. This song honestly feels like a journey, witnessing the development of a relationship, the way it grows, endures and embraces their flaws...it captures a perfectly imperfect relationship. I’ve never been in a relationship myself but this song just gets me, y’know?

**flavasavavandal** (10): HOLY FUCK THANK GOD THIS WAS NEVER ATTACHED TO A JUDD APATOW MOVIE, that would’ve been a T-R-A-V-E-S-T-Y on the level of that line from ME!

**forgetquick** (10): Every single choice in this song is perfection. The choral backing vocals? The sort of bluesy first verse? The "started off" build and climax???

**ggal2020** (10): I can’t listen to this without being disappointed that I’m not Fiona Apple because I’ll never be able to write a song even 10% as beautiful as this

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): SUCH an 11 contender, the amount of passion this song has it makes me ascend.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is probably my favorite Fiona song I’ve heard other than Criminal

**leviswift13** (10): there is something about this that is devastating in a way that feels quintessentially fiona

**proscett** (10): stot it off baby!

**skargardin** (10): START IT OFF START IT OFF

**steelstepladder** (10): The end is just so perfect

**survivorjdmarina** (10): The ending on this is amazing.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): It's definitely the most accessible song on the album but that doesn't detract from how gorgeous the chorus is, in fact it feels like the peak of the album, combining the more experimental instrumentation and phenomenal drumming, with a more conventionally beautiful vocal melody.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): this is vintage Fiona. the backing vocals are out of this world (pun intended)

**totallynot14\_** (10): she came into the studio mad as hell

**Uberpigeon** (10): In my opinion, this is the best song from FTBC. I can't get enough of the peculiar chanting voices during the prechorus, the way the heavily layered chaos all comes together in an absolutely blissful way, the screaming ending, ugh its just a perfect song

**xcjm** (10): OBJECTIVELY the best song on the album. Einstein's real quiet now huh

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): I love the enormus range of emotion in this song. From the sparse, quiet chorus, to the loud anger of the post-chorus and everything in between, it's a very authentic and honest song of relationships

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): girl are you asking me to do drugs? are we getting cosmos? whatever, you snapped

**1998tweety** (9): isnt this that video game

**kirby31200** (9): I can't believe she wrote this for a Seth Rogen movie

**NotWith10000Men** (9): god this is such a good stretch of songs. The chaos in the started off part adds so much

**Stryxen** (9): yas i love astronaut in the ocean

**akanewasright** (8.5): The backing vocals alone are sooooo good

**jman457** (8.5): such a whimsy nature to this track, I love it

**outsideeyess** (8.5): extremely Regina Spektor

**plastichaxan** (8.5): imagine being the "worst" song on an album and still being an 8.5, her power

**runaway3212** (8.5): after the philosophytube video I can't hear a cosmonaut again

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Such a cool and unique love song.

**celladonn** (8): The fact that this was originally written for a Judd Apatow movie is so funny to me

**CzrLandWhale** (8): Queen of being like a couple of Russian astronauts

**llieno94** (8): even with a screaming outro/bridge, this is the most accessible song on the album, one of two songs written for 2012’s Judd Apatow film This is 40 (the superior “Dull Tool” would fit in on this album and if you haven’t heard it listen ASAP).

**OberionSynth** (8): where were y'all when fiona invented space travel

**UrbanisminEgypt** (8): Really good ideas but the overly repetitive structure kills it and it doesn't progress at all.

**waluigiest** (8): toxic of me but I find this romantic

# Started NOTHING!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): wait what are they gonna be like?

**SmileAndTears** (7): why did she start screaming :(((

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I think that this one is a low-key fan favorite but I really don’t like the melody on “you and I could be a couple of cosmonauts”, which is too bad because there are some other great small moments

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): ugh i originally wanted to tank this but the “START IT OFF START IT OFF” bit is amazing

**IIIHenryIII** (5): The background vocals are spot on, but I feel indifferent to this one.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (5): I'm a red blooded American and I refuse to support the Soviet Union and their attempts to reach outer space, the moon and the far beyond. John Glenn, Scott Carpenter, Gordo Cooper, Gus Grissom, Wally Schirra, Deke Slayton and Alan Shepard would kick this song's ass if it had one. Hell, the New Nine along with NASA Astronaut Group 3 would like a turn as well. Fuck the cosmonauts, fuck Sergei Korolev, fuck Sputnik 1 and fuck Yuri Gagarin. And fuck Soyuz-Apollo, the real name is Apollo-Soyuz. And god bless those we lost in the pursuit of greater knowledge of our solar system and beyond.

**vayyiqra** (5): By convention, an astronaut employed by the Russian Federal Space Agency (or its Soviet predecessor) is called a cosmonaut in English texts. The word is an Anglicization of kosmonavt (Russian: космонавт

**CarlieScion** (4): I am so sorry to whoever told her to leave that voice crack in here

**welcometoNY** (3): cute but excruciatingly repetitive

**wavingwolves** (10): If I could give a 11 for the bonus rate, this would be it. I find it to be such a sweet duet and I guess this is the excuse I found to get Andrew Bird rated somehow.

**SideBTrack8** (8): I'm not familiar with Andrew Bird but this song is really nice, I especially love the production. Violins always make songs better.

**SideBTrack8** (7.5): The fact that this even exists is so cool. The random person Fiona made a song about just happens to also be an artist?? Unfortunately Fiona's feature is the weakest part of the song for me.

**wavingwolves** (5.1): I love that this exists and the story behind it, I find it so sweet, but the execution itself is less than perfect. I love Fiona's vocalization and the Shameika's rapping in this, though, I just find the vocal filters really off putting.

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this has to win

**EnCaine** (10): okay wait i didn't actually listen to this until right now i didn't think it would be this GOOD okay shameika!!

**leviswift13** (10): LOVE that this happened

**ReallyCreative** (10): a feel-good story and a bop to boot

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the story of Shameika and Fiona reconnecting gives me all the emotions, I stan!!

**seanderlust** (10): shameika gets an auto-10

**waluigiest** (10): I could write a dissertation on why I love this collab so much. The interplay of racial politics, gender, mythology, socioeconomic status, memory...... I could go on

**shhhneak** (9.6): I better not be the only one saying this is better than the original.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): the fact that this exists at all, and it's actually really good is insane?!

**fadedblue09** (9): Cute chill rap

**Leixander** (9): the way this collaboration happened was so awesome

**pat-rickstar** (8): I don't know what I expected this to sound like but it wasn't this, it's pretty good though

**celladonn** (7.5): "She stood up for me, I wish I could have done the same for her" awwwww

**bbfan132** (7): production is a mess but i love them

**OberionSynth** (7): shameika did not come to play y'all

**kirby31200** (6.5): Kind of a so-so sample integration

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I wish her voice was mixed louder

**plastichaxan** (6.4): i don’t know how to feel about this

**pheromenos** (6): what is this 😭

**wasian-invasion** (6): I feel like im missing some context here

**endcreditouilles** (5): I like the original so much more than this one, it feels discordant and monotonous at the same time.

**outsideeyess** (5): adore the premise but

**thedoctordances1940** (5): I imagine this is what FTBC sounds like to people who don't like FTBC

**IIIHenryIII** (1): Why do people like to ruin songs? Oh, that is not good at all.

**SideBTrack8** (10): The contrast between the heavy verses and the almost silly chorus makes the song so interesting. I get what she means (...after reading the Genius page), but it's still a bit jarring. In a good way though.

**wavingwolves** (10): This is infectuous and it has best portrayal of depression I've ever seen in a song.  It was an immediate favourite of mine from the first time I listened to this album, because of how impactful it is. It's has both such a honest expression of how depression works in your mind and a marvelous defiance against it. The third verse in this is probably one of my favourite lyrical moments: "people like us get so heavy and so lost sometimes / so lost and so heavy that the bottom is the only place we can find / you get dragged down, down to the same spot enough times in a row / the bottom begins to feel like the only safe place that you know"

---

**iniekcja\_** (11): the chorus is just so

**kappyko** (11): various dancing gifs

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): The just unbridled intensity of her vocal performance on this song is fantastic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Her voice here is crazy.

**akanewasright** (10): Every now and then I forget which track this is, and then I hear it and just start screaming “I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRIES”

**Awkward\_King** (10): i love this song because it feels like it represents the ebs and flows of being sad and being confused so well! its so angry then suddenly its so soothing then its confused and i love the bluntness of the lyrics

**bbfan132** (10): that chorus… damn

**bespectacIed** (10): how did fiona steal my life story without my permission, run me my cheque !!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRIES!!!!

**CritneySpearz** (10): whoahhh it took me like 5 listens but when I got it, I GOT it.. depressed bitches unite

**forgetquick** (10): The EMOTION in the chorus!

**kirby31200** (10): "I spread like strawberries, I climb like peas and beans" I don't know what she's saying but I'm living

**Leixander** (10): I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRIES

**leviswift13** (10): I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRIES I CLIMB LIKE PEAS AND BEANS

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): queen of depression

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I love the rougher energy. The echoes on the chorus are magnificent

**passionfruits2** (10): My no. 2 option for the 11. Of course a song about depression is one of the hardest hitters in the album. Fiona vocalizes her pain so masterfully, FTBC sometimes sounds like talking to a friend about deep shit, but this time your friend is 43, and it's Fiona Apple.

**pat-rickstar** (10): This is incredible

**ReallyCreative** (10): I spread like strawberries too ma'am but climbing like peas and beans? only indoor activities here

**rosecult** (10): i adore this song

**runaway3212** (10): this hits

**skargardin** (10): so true

**steelstepladder** (10): This song starts out the best three song stretch in the rate

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Lord give me STRENGTH! The chorus is absolutely crazy, and it’s now one of my favourites on the album.

**Tedyonce** (10): I know that strawberries spread because of this song, we stan Fiona the botanist

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): such a powerful song. definitely one of the most meaningful ones off FTBC for me. the chorus goes so hard too

**Turpamutteri** (10): I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRIES

**welcometoNY** (10): THAT depression anthem

**zagreux** (10): fuck. this is such a chillingly accurate portrayal of depression. depression. The 'You get dragged down, down to the same spot enough times in a row / The bottom begins to feel like the only safe place that you know' part is very relatable, it's like life has fucked you over so many times that the state of being fucked is the only constant you know.

**jman457** (9.6): I love fruit, make me a garden

**xcjm** (9.6): slutty little strawberries

**fadedblue09** (9.5): One of the quirks of Fiona’s songwriting is how she likens herself to the most unusual of things, it’s like she’s creating new metaphors.

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): Maybe I’m just a sucker for songs about being in love while depressed. No I am just a sucker for that and this song is fantastic

**ggal2020** (9.5): I want to get a strawberries and peas tattoo sooo bad

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): beans

**Uberpigeon** (9.5): I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRYS, I CLIMB LIKE PEAS AND BEANS. When I first heard the lyric about the boar standing on a hose I paused the song and went "wow." I cannot state enough how much of a genius lyricist Fiona is.

**endcreditouilles** (9): wooooow I love the raw emotion in this, I don't even mind these lyrics.

**llieno94** (9): I once read in an interview with Fiona that she enjoyed reading parenting and childrens books to sort of parent her self, and the main metaphor of this song seems to be inspired from that. Using the growing motions of fruits and vegetables, Fiona compares her resilience in the face of depression to Strawberries and Peas. Its just weird enough to work.

**nishidahall** (9): This was a 10 for me but I think I overplayed it last year.

**OberionSynth** (9): me nine months after hearing that chorus for the first time 🤰

**plastichaxan** (9): i have underrated this before… never again

**vayyiqra** (9): Giving this a high rating because I have severe depression like this song describes! Relatable!

**waluigiest** (9): when she yells “I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRIES” I turn this depression anthem up!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): I don't really know what "I spread like strawberries, I climb like peas and beans" means, but Fiona sings it with such passion I can't help but be compelled

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is serving a bit too, she sounds great when she does that snarl thing

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I don’t know what she means but I’m living. Edit: I learned this was about depression and I definitely see this in a different way now ... still unsure about the strawberry’s and beans tho

**notoriouspge** (8.5): Fiona teaching us about plants and I'm down

**shhhneak** (8.5): my god I hate these lyrics but it goes so hard.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): One of the darkest songs sonically in this rate. I really love the strawberries and peas line in the chorus too, and how it's just kinda shouted out

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8.5): I don't know what this song is about but it sounds relatable.

**CarlieScion** (8): red balloon who

**CrimsonROSET** (8): maybe the true heavy balloon were the friends we made along the way

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): I'm disappointed with the second verse here. I feel like these exact descriptors and metaphors for depression have been used numerous times before, so this is the only spot on the album where I'm not hearing anything new.

**just\_thonking** (8): I SPREAD LIKE STRAWBERRIES!!!! Best song on the album yup yup

**proscett** (8): Woo cheelay, I'm busting at the seams. Busting busting

**shesdoingyoga** (8): The only part of this song that I remember is the way she says strawberries/peas and beans and you know what? That’s ok

**totallynot14\_** (8): i don't love this

**wasian-invasion** (8): Damn she really do be spreading like strawberries tho

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): fuck eating disorders, all my homies hate eating disorders

**cremeebrulee** (7): sis chose the whitest foods possible please

**slimboyfriend** (7): she sounds vegan

**Stryxen** (7): idk have you tried a helium one it might fix your issue

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I wasn't crazy about the first half but I do like the outro to this.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): Not a fan of this one. I hate the chorus. Despite feeling this way, I still gave it this score cause it's kinda good, but it's definitely not for me.

**SideBTrack8** (10): Some artists spend more time talking about using their platform for good than actually doing it (am I thinking of someone in particular? maybe), but Fiona absolutely is not one of those artists. When she says she won't shut up, no matter the repercussions, she means it.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): This one has one of my favourite FTBC lyrics, "*I would beg to disagree / but begging disagrees with me*", which I think summarizes the song really well. It's about subverting power dynamics, one of the recurrent themes of the album. About the song, Fiona has said it was "inspired by a particular dinner where there was lots of expensive wine and lots of bragging about things I wouldn’t brag about. I won’t say too much about it, but somebody said something I thought was offensive. It was not the kind of dinner where you’re supposed to call somebody out. But I didn’t want to be there in the first place. So I called the guy out. And may have messed the dinner up a little bit. But I was right."

---

# Begging disagrees with me

**1998tweety** (10): now this is a serve

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): Anyone who begs to disagree can get their lame ass under the table

**Awkward\_King** (10): this grew on me so much, i never disliked it but its slowly become one of my favourites the more i pay attention to the lyrics. "or rather to help the bodies that you step over along the way" is one of my favourite lyrical moments of the album for sure

**bbfan132** (10): yes.

**bespectacIed** (10): Mood

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She went in on whatever loser this is addressed too.

**cyborglilith** (10): another serve

**CzrLandWhale** (10): Having never listened to Fiona until last summer, this was the song that really made me pause because I really felt it. Unapologetic as fuck.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I WOULD BEG TO DISAGREE, BUT BEGGING DISAGREES WITH ME!!!

**fadedblue09** (10): An anthem of self-assertion with that classic Fiona sound

**ggal2020** (10): I WONT SHUT UP NO I WILL NOT

**kappyko** (10): various dancing gifs

**proscett** (10): representation matters for people who wont shut up.

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way she says "I won't shut up" queen shit

**sarcasticsobs** (10): what a 4-track run to kick off this masterpiece

**seanderlust** (10): defiant as fuck. 11 contender quite honestly

**skargardin** (10): I WON'T SHUT UP!!

**steelstepladder** (10): I WOULD BEG TO DISAGREE BUT BEGGING DISSAGREES WITH ME!!!!

**TiltControls** (10): This track is filled with so many great lines

**Uberpigeon** (10): "I would beg to disagree but begging disagrees with me" Is one of the best lyrics I have ever heard in my life. The premise of this song is so gripping, and its full of classic Fiona wit.

**waluigiest** (10): even though this is clearly a specific anecdote I feel like this is a universal feeling- being out of place and appalled and wanting to cause a scene because you’re such an outsider

**zagreux** (10): Men who one-up you or try to silence you because what you're trying to say isn't "appropriate" are the worst. AMAB.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.9): "KICK ME UNDER THE TABLE ALL YOU WANT! I WON'T SHUT UP, I WON'T SHUT UP" has to be one of Fiona’s catchiest hooks ever.

**bulforster** (9.6): I love how when she starts putting all that force behind her vocals, the whole instrumental growls with her.

**celladonn** (9.5): Queen of calling people out at dinner parties

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I would beg to disagree but begging disagrees with me, I love how that sounds! The way she sounds angrier and angrier as the song progresses is so clever. What about that second bridge? Those banging sounds can bring one from the dead!

**AHSWeeknd** (9): That bridge itself is an experience.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): this was the first song I got into from FTBC, the refrain is powerful and catchy at the same time.

**conceptualromance** (9): brilliant use of the word “cookie”

**cremeebrulee** (9): “kick me under the table all u want, i won’t shut up” my phone @ me when i accidentally blasted good form at the dinner table during a serious discussion

**CrimsonROSET** (9): ‘I would beg to disagree but begging disagrees with me’ is a killer line, even if I don’t care much for the rest of the song.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): let the woman talk damn

**leviswift13** (9): is this the *banger* of the album? raw and angry fiona is one of the best fionas

**llieno94** (9): piggybacking off the childhood musings of the title track, Fiona channels her angsty, sullen youth and gives an almost bratty delivery that at some point, with heavy repetition of the title, turns into a confident and assured adult.

**notoriouspge** (9): "I would beg to disagree but begging disagrees with me" serving LINES

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): A Feminist Anthem!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): the bass on the bridge is transcendent

**wasian-invasion** (9): My nonconfrontational ass wants what Fiona has

**welcometoNY** (9): i find the bridge a bit annoying but it manages to be a pseudo-inspirational song that doesn't revert to over-used, under-cooked metaphors and that's impressive

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.6): Call them out, Fiona!

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): The catchiest song on the album, it’s hook snuck up from under the table into my ear drums and now I want to kick the nearest guy in the shin

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): ended misogyny

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I love the second time the "I would beg to disagree" part comes in

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): I would beg to disagree with anybody who doesn't love this album

**jman457** (8.3): Love the vivid storytelling with the nursery sounding song with a huge build

**OberionSynth** (8): me calling out my racist relatives at thanksgiving dinner

**runaway3212** (8): bop!

**Stryxen** (8): this is so relatable i have never wanted to go to a dinner either

**totallynot14\_** (8): i just know her shins hurt

**vayyiqra** (7): today I read an article about all the hundreds of dead bodies on Mt. Everest of climbers who died trying to reach the summit and some of them are buried under rocks by other climbers, or by the snow, or dumped into a crevasse, but some just lay there so everyone else has no choice but to step over them on the path up the mountain and that kind of fucked me up a little to think about it

**QustoMar** (6.5): my fire alarm with a dead battey that i'm hiding from my apartment inspector

**CarlieScion** (6): I low-key hate the mindset of this song but eh

# Just found out who's this song about

**SmileAndTears** (4.5): Oh how I wish she'd actually shut up

**SideBTrack8** (10): Instantly became my favourite song on the album, the guitar melodies are so addicting. The deep background vocals add so much to the song and have always sounded a bit like Leonard Cohen to me, apparently it's her tour manager?? That's so random but it works so well.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): A song about recurring nightmares, dreams, manifesting and doing your best, or at least that's what Phoebe says. I definitely see that easily and I think this is overall just a very comforting song for me. I personally really love the second verse and it feels like something that really summarizes much of my own more introverted experiences and thoughts, especially when she sings "and when I grow up, I'm gonna look up from my phone and see my life". 

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): It's the most beautiful song in this rate. The instrumental is exquisite - it almost sounds like it's being played underwater, which goes so well with the themes of water in the lyrics. This song also stands out on Punisher because it's one of the few with mostly positive, happy lyrics, but it's no less personal and emotional. There's so many songs about growing up and getting more negative and seeing how terrible the world is (which is valid), but Phoebe paints a picture of growing up as a person and getting better and getting happier. Fantastic.

**BoneStreetSand** (11): Glad to find a song where I can relate to every single word.

**forgetquick** (11): Kyoto and I Know the End will probably get all the love off this album (which is fair, because they're both brilliant), but this is my top track and most listened to song of 2020. It's dreamy and a little dark and lush and just the right amount of off-kilter; the super deep voice on the chorus, the guitar strumming gently in the background that reminds me of rippling water, and lyrics are gorgeous ("she told me my resentment's getting smaller"!!!). Perfect for my mood during the pandemic where I need to be both soothed and anxious at the same time.

**totallynot14\_** (11): I don't know wtf this song is about or what she's saying but I relate to it so deeply except for the part where she says she's not afraid of hard work

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): Beautiful, stunning, showstopping, etc.

**bespectacIed** (10): I've said this before, phoebe is such an effective "stream of consciousness" songwriter, she pieces up these continuous little vignettes and observations of life into kinda incoherent but super beautiful songs... Love that for her, truly.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): this song is pure magic. puts me in a trance every mf time.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I've never been a big fan of Phoebe's voice, but the vulnerable aspect of it works here, I actually really love this. Especially when the low voice comes in to give it support, that part is beautiful. The lyrics are really well written too, full of emotion.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Can we talk about the strings on this song? Pure eargasm!

**llieno94** (10): the true opener of the album and a perfect introduction to Phoebe. This is the first song I’d ever heard by her and I had to pick my jaw up off the floor a few times. The quiet frankness of the lyrics, mixed with the lilting melody and the sort of dream-like subject matter make for a 11/10 composition.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): me when i write a song about a garden

**RandomHypnotica** (10): tag yourself, I'm resentment

**runaway3212** (10): gardens are literally so great

**salivantsonority** (10): The most underrated track on this album imo.

**slimboyfriend** (10): This song is the saddest coming of age movie

**Stryxen** (10): any other rate and this would easily be my 11 but it’s probably only top 5 for me in this rate lmao

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I broke up with a guy who didn't like this song (also he "wasn't into politics")

**TiltControls** (10): probably her most well-writen song on the album. Absolutely gorgeous

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): 'and when i grow up, i’m gonna look up from my phone and see my life' love that lyric. such great storytelling in this one

**xcjm** (10): as a queer woman I was disappointed to learn that the lyric was not actually "and when I grow up, I'm going to look up from my phone and see my wife". Still, I would like to be Phoebe's wife

**cyborglilith** (9.8): I grew up here till it all went up in flames except the notches in the doorframe :<

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): inclusion of the deep male register was a genius move

**savemeaseat143** (9.7): the guitar is gold

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.6): love how fragile her voice sounds in this, it really works w the lyrics

**conceptualromance** (9.5): When I first heard this song I thought it was Matt Berninger was doing backup vocals lol

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): In the words of the lyrical mastermind Flo Rida: I cry, just a little

**AHSWeeknd** (9): The doctor’s a WOMAN???

**Awkward\_King** (9): belb i dont think im stable enough to do this ballot rn brb

**celladonn** (9): Like a haunting dream

**CrimsonROSET** (9): invented whoreticulture

**CzrLandWhale** (9): Y'all ever have dreams where you spend the whole time trying to get to a Baskin Robbins and the moment you get your ice cream you wake up before you eat it?

**OberionSynth** (9): the bass voice in the chorus, ugh that'll make your bussy throb

**pat-rickstar** (9): How is that man's voice so deep

**plastichaxan** (9): this has yass vibes

**Quiet-Tone13** (9): I love this song. It's Twin Peaks in music form.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): God I looooove that hazy guitar that plays throughout the track. Inject that shit into my veins.

**vayyiqra** (9): :hanawinsSad: This is really pretty. [Side note: my grandfather was in the Polish army during World War II and he literally killed Nazis out of self-defense, and I do not recommend doing it for real; it will fuck you up a lot more than you think]

**Vromega** (9): This deserved to be the first song of the album

**waluigiest** (9): every line cuts like a knife - this song is so beautiful

**bbfan132** (8.5): gorgeous intro to the album! a bit one-note but still great

**fadedblue09** (8.5): This feels lacking when separated from DVD Menu

**nick1372** (8.5): the imagery is so good

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): I think this is the most phoebe bridgers song there is

**1998tweety** (8): this is kinda vibey

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Wow...there's so much to take in from the lyrics. Idk what it is but it's quite beautiful.

**frogaranaman** (8): well, I don’t have everything! I’m still looking for dick

**leviswift13** (8): i've never loved this song the way other people do or the way i love almost every other song. i think it's because it felt on first listen like derivative of smoke signals. it doesn't pack the punch that song does, but when taking it for what it is you see these lyrics are stunning. i mean "the doctor put her hands over my liver, she told me my resentment's getting smaller"

**ManofOranges** (8): Do y'all hear the backup singer with the voice lower than the Marianas Trench? He sounds hot.

**notoriouspge** (8): major vibes

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Probably my least favorite on the album but it works as a first song because it sets the general tone for the rest

**skargardin** (8): this is gorgeous

**wasian-invasion** (8): Today's fun fact: the best fertilizer is made from bodies of skinhead neighbors

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is pretty but just a bit too subdued for me

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Phoebe is right to make the skinhead "go missing"

**jman457** (6.3): Its very subdued?? I like the vibe on its own but feels weird energy between this and Kyoto.

**ReallyCreative** (6): where the fuck is Rebecca Sugar

**NotWith10000Men** (5): it exists

**proscett** (0): this almost got my 11

**SideBTrack8** (9): Probably a controversial opinion but I definitely prefer this to the album version. The new production completely changes the mood of the song, and the strings are just so beautiful.

**wavingwolves** (7): It feels a lot less triumphant than the original version and I'm not that into it.

---

**endcreditouilles** (10): love this orchestral version, it's just as good as the original. Alternate versions usually fall flat for me as they're either too similar to the original or they're just not as good, but this is incredible. An unique and emotional take on a well composed song.

**OberionSynth** (10): kyoto is already so good, but this version just gets me in the feels ab my father issues. def going in my "this is why i hate men" playlist

**pheromenos** (10): it's kyoto

**rickikardashian** (10): pain

**Leixander** (9): gorgeous

**pat-rickstar** (9): I still like this a lot but it doesn't work as well as the original

**ReallyCreative** (9): Phoebe girl can you invest in an orchestra

**seanderlust** (9): I love that this version is a very different vibe than the original but both work so well

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Honestly, I originally did not "get" Kyoto when I first heard it, but this version made it click for me, and now it's one of my favorite songs of 2020

**team\_kockroach** (9): Rob Moose kills the strings. This is so beautiful.

**waluigiest** (9): I can’t in good faith give it a 10 because it’s not as good as the original. But it’s great and I love the concept of reorchestrating like this

**shhhneak** (8.2): Beautiful but part of the appeal of Kyoto OG is the bounciness of the music.

**fadedblue09** (8): Gorgeous instrumental

**ggal2020** (7.5): Rob Moose is a legend but these versions feel unnecessary. However, they do prove the true strength of the songs. If Kyoto sounds this good without those incredible horns it means it really is a great song.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): OG stan over here.

**skargardin** (7): the strings >>>

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It lacks a lot of what makes the original so amazing, but it's still pretty.

**plastichaxan** (6.5): i like her voice and the lyrics to this song a lot, it's my favorite in the album, however, i feel like a lot of what made it special for me got lost in this version

**bbfan132** (6): the strings are pretty and she sounds fine but this song needs percussion to really stick out imo

**engifear** (5): A lot of the appeal of the original version of Kyoto was the sad lyrics accompanied by more upbeat instrumentals. This completely takes away that contrast and just makes for a more boring version of a good song. I like the momentum that's built a little towards the end though.

**sarcasticsobs** (4.5): i feel nothing after listening to the original version prior. think i'd like just a pure instrumental version only b/c strings

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (4): this whole thing doesn't work

**RandomHypnotica** (3): this is just Kyoto but... far more boring. The orchestration is really pretty, but it just feels like it doesn't match the track at ALL

**nick1372** (2): I’m conflicted. On the one hand, I absolutely hate this song. It sounds like personified anxiety. There is something so chilling about the vocal line being the exact same as the original despite the instrumental being much slower. On the other hand, if its goal was to make me deeply uncomfortable it absolutely accomplished that.

**SideBTrack8** (10): I don't even know what to say about this song. The production is so bouncy and fun but the lyrics are so heavy. I'll never forget the first time I heard that line.

**wavingwolves** (10): I love everything about this song and I could never begin to tell how much it means to me to be able to hear something like this without cracking.

---

**akanewasright** (11): I feel like this could get some comments about the song being “disorienting” or some horseshit like that, instead of thinking for two goddamn seconds about why that could possibly be the case. Songs like this, songs about marital abuse and sexual assault are important, and I honestly think that them being easy to listen to would undermine the point.

**avg-vag** (11): somehow cathartic and unnerving. a masterpiece.

**Awkward\_King** (11): this lyrically is possibly my favourite song ever ?? all the first few verses are so rich with multiple meanings and rhymes and magic its so im just so enamoured by it. it sounds almost like a twisted nursery rhyme. then the way it transitions into the second half of the song, with the obviously heavy lyric in the middle that's repeated and then it transitions into a heavenly outro, i love it so much this song makes me feel so safe

**bbfan132** (11): that outro might be the most blissful moment in all of music… so fucking powerful

**DaHumanTorch** (11): this is one of the easiest 11 choices i've ever made in a rate. everything about it is just perfect. this song is definitely the highlight of the album. i love how after songs full of intricate metaphors and poetic lyrics, she just flat out says *that line* in the bridge. it makes it punch you in the gut 10x harder. i just love this song so much

**engifear** (11): Absolutely devastating song

**flavasavavandal** (11): best song in the rate, from that line, to Fiona’s commanding and righteous performance, probably the best song Fiona will ever release.

**JunkyGS** (11): Masterpiece. I do not possess the proper vocabulary to describe how brilliant this song is and anything short of that is a disservice to the song.

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Devastating. My jaw dropped during at the bridg

**steelstepladder** (11): What a lyric. What a fucking lyric.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): Something about the chant idea for this song just works for me. Hypnotic, even!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Is she rapping here? What a great exploration of hip-hop.

**bespectacIed** (10): speech less

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not only lyrically powerful but beautifully constructed. The switch up in the middle is executed perfectly.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it feels disrespectful to call this a bop

**CzrLandWhale** (10): This was almost my 11, ALMOST!

**EnCaine** (10): the bridge on this track is one of the most powerful moments in music of 2020

**endcreditouilles** (10): This is incredible. The lyrics what the fuck!!! I'm speechless. I sound like a broken record but the emotion in this!!! It gets more raw and intense with each track.

**fadedblue09** (10): The delivery, the lyrics are just… I don't think I can do justice to this. I'll let the target audience speak for this.

**forgetquick** (10): Jesus christ. Never heard a song that hits harder.

**ggal2020** (10): I made a tiktok dance to this song <3

**kirby31200** (10): I thought this was going to be a fun song :(

**leviswift13** (10): .

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): just so good and moving

**mudkip1** (10): sometimes i feel bad, or guilty might be the better word, for loving this so much sdvnskdjn but it's such a good song, screaming the lyrics is so cathartic. i love how she added a track as poignant as this on the album

**notoriouspge** (10): fuck the bridge hits so hard. A true contender for my 11

**plastichaxan** (10): this is extremely hard to listen, and very powerful, fiona is just on another level

**proscett** (10): a contender for my 11. so harrowing and devastating but also ridiculously catchy!

**ReallyCreative** (10): my jaw dropped the first time I heard this song and it still drops today

**skargardin** (10): this is a lot, extremely heavy subject but sonically it really is everything

**Stryxen** (10): aww good morning to you too fiona! what a lovely song

**team\_kockroach** (10): the r*pe line took me by surprise, and tbh I’m not sure it fits the song. The rest of the song was very innovative, though.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): I gasped when I first heard the "It's the season of the (a)ward and she's trying to cut the cord, she's tired of planting her knees on the cold, hard flooooor..." part. Fiona snapped.

**totallynot14\_** (10): that line..

**waluigiest** (10): its extremely powerful and discomforting. It’s the emotional peak of the album, and the dense lyrics leading up the the apex is masterful.

**welcometoNY** (10): this song hit me like a truck

**zagreux** (10): fuck **all** men

**survivorjdmarina** (9.9): The tone shift in the second half is one of the best moments on the album, although it seems a little underproduced at points. Still amazing though.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): I'm sure I'm not going to be the only person to talk about "that" line, but like, WOW. This song is certainly more than just that line, but I think it's all designed to build up towards that. It's dancing around this delicate, painful subject, only for Fiona to go ahead and rip off the bandaid and reveal it for what it is, a horrifying, digusting act. And it's an extremely powerful moment.

**xcjm** (9.7): fuck. This hits like a punch to the gut

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This is a blast! One of my favorites. I still have a hard time digesting the outro but it's growing on me.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Fiona might be one of the best if not the best at putting raw emotion into a song

**shhhneak** (9.5): this is—with all due respect—a bop that goes off.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): absolutely ripped me apart when I first listened to this. one of the best songs I rarely listen to.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this is so hard to listen to but so important

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Damn, Fiona ended misogyny with this song.

**iniekcja\_** (9): the way the bridge never fails to hit

**llieno94** (9): maybe the closest Fiona has come to a rap delivery? The bridge brilliantly takes the refrain of the cheery Good Morning from Singing in the Rain to deliver the gut punch twist of the song

**NotWith10000Men** (9): goddamn that line. I feel strange even giving this a score.

**QustoMar** (9): wow... artists making song short for streaming smh

**runaway3212** (9): goodmorning!

**seanderlust** (9): the gut punch that is that "good morning" part. 11 contender

**static\_int\_husp** (9): That bridge hit's really hard

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The first part of this song isn't all that great but the bridge/outro more than makes up for that, I was completely shocked the first time I heard the lyrics and that hasn't really changed since.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): such a gut punch of a song

wavingwolves: **celladonn** (8.5): That Line hits me like a ton of bricks every time

**jasannn** (8.5): Although I'm sure I'll never seek it out again and forget it exists, this is my favorite song on the album.

**jman457** (8.5): Sings such a traumatic experience with such simplicity yet poignant.

**OberionSynth** (8): the bridge tho

**Uberpigeon** (8): good morning

**vayyiqra** (8): :hanawinsSad:

**wasian-invasion** (8): Never really got this far in the album before the rate but now I regret it

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this feels like the climax of a musical about her life ... the lyrics are powerful and you can definitely hear the pain

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): i’ve been thinking about this song a lot lately, mostly because there’s been some discourse around it on the sub/server and it’s made me realize i overscored it on a first listen because i was kind of fearful of the backlash of being critical of this song. not to get too personal, but being assaulted in the past has made it really hard for me to consume media with sexual violence content and this song unfortunately falls under that category. if i do listen to it, i will skip past the bridge because listening to that line will send me to a very dark place. i know that this is not universal— many survivors do find comfort in having their experiences being put into words publicly; i hope whoever fiona wrote this for has found solace in the lyrics and maybe one day i will too. it just wouldn’t be honest for me to give this a high score rn when it makes me relive one of the worst moments of my life. uhm anyway i definitely overshared but if you’re still here, considering donating to RAINN/your local women’s shelter/something bc i’ve seen some takes on this song that are really bad (treating it as a “plot twist” or something meant to shock listeners) and you might be alienating more people than you think

**just\_thonking** (7.5): that one line is always a gut punch

**jayjaysortagay** (7): how do I even rate this? It feels inappropriate to put a number on something so personal so I'm just going to put a 7 but consider it equivalent to recusing myself bc I don't know

**1998tweety** (6): theres a lot going on here and i dont know how to feel about it

**CarlieScion** (5): the voice effect made me feel more uncomfortable than watching most scary movies

**SideBTrack8** (10): Unfortunately relatable, knowing you're "in it" but not knowing how to get out. And then even when you're not "in it" you still know it's coming, you know exactly when and why it's going to happen.

**wavingwolves** (10): One of my favourite songs by them, and maybe even my favourite. The pulsating rhythm of it, how it grows and then climaxes and how every single word hits too close for comfort while still being such a hopeful and powerful song. Every time I listen to it it's like a wake up call in the best way possible.

---

**Doninoes** (11): this song is aggressive therapy

**frogaranaman** (11): me when I’m finally in it and have been trying to get back for a minute

**letsallpoo** (11): i love men

**mudkip1** (11): now ~~why am~~ i'm in it, now see how i get thrown in stuff, i ain't even did nothin

**nick1372** (11): just go on a long walk and cry while listening to this song. You’ll feel it. When the final chorus kicks in you’ll ascend to godhood

**salivantsonority** (11): This song saved me so many times in the five months after it dropped and I can't in good conscience not give it the 11, even though I know it'll probably be an I Know The End or The Steps or Kyoto win.

**vayyiqra** (11): alternative girl band make synth bop about depression = pander to me more Haim

**WeakProduct** (11): This track really just hits all the marks for me. This is in my opinion HAIM’s best song. I’m a big HAIM fan. When I first heard the song day it came out, it had me SO hooked that I remember where I was vividly. This is a top 10 song of all time for me. That transition that takes place around :56 is just legendary. It combines the sound that HAIM usually brings with pop beats we see from the likes of Robyn and Betty Who.

**1998tweety** (10): its the smasha

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This production went off

**bigbigbee** (10): This reminds me of MUNA, and I love MUNA.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is better quality synthpop than what a lot of the sub faves have produced the past few years.

**CarlieScion** (10): bops

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is their best song tbh

**cremeebrulee** (10): a crime that this is a bonus track

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The other two sisters carrying Danielle in the stretcher in the MV is a fucking MOOD.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): My second favorite Haim song. This is perfect. It's so cathartic.

**leviswift13** (10): again there is this desperation to the lyrics, melody and vocal that is so grounded and real. captures the manic quality of fighting to get out of *it* ... whatever that *it* may be.

**notoriouspge** (10): should have been on the official release part 1/2; the other contender for my 11.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This was the first HAIM song that I heard and actually solidly bopped too, it's so good

**ReallyCreative** (10): when this comes on in the club you had better stop what you are doing and hand me my fitbit, daddy's going WALKING

**seanderlust** (10): i'm always a sucker for sixteenth note guitars

**shesdoingyoga** (10): If I’m listening to a bonus track and like it more than all but one other song on your album, it means you did something wrong

**shhhneak** (10): every HAIM strutting anthem is an automatic ten.

**skargardin** (10): some of these bonus tracks are actually my favorites on the whole album

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Amazing how the bonus tracks on this album are the best parts

**TiltControls** (10): a classic from the start

**Turpamutteri** (10): My summer anthem

**xcjm** (10): ooooh the production kicking in over the second verse!!!! The piano over the bridge is very Modern Vampires of the City but make it xx chromosomes. Also, I think Paul Simon would enjoy this one a lot.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): soo catchy

**team\_kockroach** (9.3): Rechtshaid is an underrated producer.

**akanewasright** (9): BOP and a half

**Brendon-Urine** (9): just... why is this a bonus track? this is easily better than everything on the second half of the album

**llieno94** (9): this song is the best blend of their old sound and the new sounds they’re trying on. I’m a sucker for multi layered vocal/lyrics so this is a standout for me.

**proscett** (9): i cant understand these verses at all but i agree!

**QustoMar** (9): reminds me a lot of the sound from days are gone for some reason

**runaway3212** (9): should've been on the main album

**survivorjdmarina** (9): You can kinda tell this was an earlier released song since this sounds completely different from the rest of the album lol

**waluigiest** (9): the piano in the bridge clears my skin

**wasian-invasion** (9): the vocal effects near the beginning are a bit much but this song is so damn catchy

**bulforster** (8.9): the drum solo bangs

**jman457** (8.8): an uptempo synthpop bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the anxious energy here, relatable

**conceptualromance** (8.5): sweet like a chica cherry cola I guess

**Stryxen** (8.5): me when the stephen king clown suddenly eats me and i'm explaining where i am

**bespectacIed** (8): very 2016 indie pop, i dig

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait why wasn’t this on the album this is cute

**endcreditouilles** (8): The production feels all over the place from the previous song, it's a bit distracting. The consistency in production is off for me with this whole album, it doesn't feel cohesive. That being said, I absolutely love the piano/vocal interlude about halfway through, I 100% need more of that. That part elevated this song, it wouldn't have been an 8 otherwise.

**forgetquick** (8): This sounds like a solid, classic Haim track so I understand why they made it a bonus track. It's good but not as adventurous production-wise as some of the other songs on this album.

**iniekcja\_** (8): https://youtu.be/_jZuz3NEr18

**plastichaxan** (8): me when i re-listened and realized the album was actually good

**steelstepladder** (8): LIKE A CHIC OF CHERRY COLA

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I'm a sucker for arpeggiators

**Alumineous** (7): I hear Bleachers.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.7): I like the faster tempo and that's all I can think to say about it

**OberionSynth** (6): i wouldn't skip this, but it's not exactly a bop either

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Very catchy but also very overproduced. Those synths were not necessary at all. I can see why it's a bonus track.

**flavasavavandal** (4.5): I mean I don’t love the muddy haze the rest of the album has, the critical establishment and this sub just seems to love so :shrug: I know I’m going to get flamed for these scores anyway so I’m just gonna repeat myself with calling this album mid

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): bonus track for a reason

**SideBTrack8** (11): My 2020 song of the year, and one of my favourites of all time. This was the easiest 11 I've ever given. I was excited for the album before this song, but as soon as they released this I knew WIMPIII would be my AOTY. Everything about this song is pure dopamine, the drums especially just hit so hard. This was in 3rd for SO LONG, then kept bouncing between 3rd and 5th, but then with the final ballot tragically fell to 6th.

**wavingwolves** (10): Wow, the journey we had with the placement of this song... It was a ride, I'll tell you that much. For most of it this was at placed at #3, while Fiona was going out at #7, and I was so sure that wouldn't change until it did. And then this plummeted, as did other HAIM songs. I absolutely hate to see this placed this low, but I still think this is a worthy top song for them to have. It's one of the haimest HAIM songs and it truly feels like it was specifically crafted to be heard while you walk around your own neighbourhood on a Sunday afternoon.

---

**CritneySpearz** (11): this song deserved a grammy, it was ROBBED… god its so fucking good

**hakkerj** (11): this was my song of the summer and most played song of 2020. I love it’s vintage sound and Daniel’s vocals!

**outsideeyess** (11): damn can't wait to blast this in the summer

**Pam\_Beesly157** (11): I've been obsessed with this song since the day it came out. My sister and I especially love singing along to it in the car, she does the melody while I do the harmony

**rrsn** (11): Just such a good pop song that I never get worn out on. The guitar sounds amazing, the vocals are great, I just love this song so much.

**shhhneak** (11): At this moment in time on this day in this universe it is my current eleven but there’s honestly three other competitors in WIMPIII alone.

**Stryxen** (11): This song reminds me to not care too much about the little things - and sometimes when i’m about to leave my house feeling anxious and full of worry, I can put this on, turn it all into anger against the people who might judge or make it hard for me and walk about like i’m the third HAIM sister. Thank you HAIM for this certified banger <3

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Staircase steps or steps that are on the ground?

**akanewasright** (10): Seeing them do this on the Grammys REALLY sold me on this song

**Awkward\_King** (10): if i go right and you go left? did someone say looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left looking left narcissus

**bbfan132** (10): it feels like it’s constantly moving, great track

**bespectacIed** (10): come on first world problems. Love this song, very preppy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Definitely the biggest banger in this rate. YOU DON'T UNDERSTAAAAND MEAY!

**bulforster** (10): That wailing guitar is so good.

**celladonn** (10): Absolute bop

**CrimsonROSET** (10): an anthem for walking (out of toxic relationships) by icons who walk

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): How come I end up where I started? How come I end up where I belong?

**frogaranaman** (10): Apple Watch rings anthem

**getin2it** (10): This Sheryl Crow meets Shania Twain is an instant classic.

**ggal2020** (10): Their Grammy performance blew my tits off

**ignitethephoenix** (10): idk what else to say other then I really like this

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The transition from Los Angeles is so smooth. The drums on this album… I can't get enough of them. This is another 10, for sure.

**leviswift13** (10): a fucking banger. took a while to hit me and then it hit me like a semi.

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember first listening to this song and kind of being disappointed by it but over time I've slowly grown to really appreciate it.

**musical\_pyn** (10): Those drum hits are absolutely incredible.

**nick1372** (10): I was iffy on the guitar in this one at the beginning but it’s just so anthemic

**nishidahall** (10): A Vibe

**notoriouspge** (10): SOOOOOOO BABYYYYYY

**plastichaxan** (10): they did take those steps, queens

**ReallyCreative** (10): EVERYDAY I WAKE UP AND MAKE MONEY FOR MYSELF

**seanderlust** (10): this is one of my favorites off the record. that little crying guitar is brilliant

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): a bitter yet empowering anthem! such a great song to listen to in the summertime while driving

**Turpamutteri** (10): I just wanna scream the chorus every time I hear it

**survivorjdmarina** (9.9): That guitar is sliiiiiiiiick. Danielle sounds amazing here also.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (9): I like it very much a lot but not quite the 10 that some songs are here.

**fadedblue09** (9): One of the vocal highlights here. Feels very emotive compared to the rest of the album

**just\_thonking** (9): frustration is my favorite emotion to be conveyed in a song. Not to mention it's a bop!

**OberionSynth** (9): as someone who ends up being the only one trying in basically any relationship i've ever had, i can totally see myself belting this out in my car at 3am once i'm finished rating everything

**skargardin** (9): bop

**thedoctordances1940** (9): This was the early standout from the album for me as it was released and it's an absolute bop

**jman457** (8.9): A fun little jam that gives good springsteen vibes

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): this is simultaneously so good but also so prototypically haim that I sometimes don't care? idk its weird

**conceptualromance** (8.5): the chorus fucks, baby!

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): "We can go toe-to-toe with any male rock band and blow them…"

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**CzrLandWhale** (8): Does this make them The Step Sisters?

**llieno94** (8): the most HAIM sounding song on an overall experimental (by their standards) album

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): groovy

**runaway3212** (8): im ignoring a text of a dear friend of mine while this is playing and it fits the vibe

**waluigiest** (8): the way they say “you don’t underSTAND” oh yeahh

**CarlieScion** (7.5): is this weirdly mixed? It feels like the sound is peaking in the loud parts. There’s good ways to get a warm / old-timey vinyl sounds in digital media, but it’s not this lol

**proscett** (7.5): a cute classic rock moment. fun!

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): The hook slaps. The instrumental is just okay, and I’m a little disappointed by the third verse.

**endcreditouilles** (7): I'm not as fond of the production, it's grainy/gritty and gets too taxing after a while. But I like the overall groove and vibes.

**kappyko** (7): still bafflingly shitty sounding. intentionally so? probably but the chirpiness is aggravating at points EDIT I WAS STOCKHOLM SYNDROMED INTO LIKING THIS I HATE YOU ALL!! I HATE YOU POPHEADS INDIEHEADS MUSIC CRITIC INDUSTRIAL COMPLEX! I HATE YOU ROSTAM!!! I HATE YOU HAIM!!!!!!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (7): cute and summery. I like the guitar lick.

**Uberpigeon** (7): i like the guitar

**vayyiqra** (6): The steps are the steps they take while walking in their music videos aha get it (this a reference to the meme about the band Haim and how they walk a lot in their music videos)

**cremeebrulee** (5): the instrumental is great but this song does literally nothing for me, i would rather be listening to other tracks on here

**flavasavavandal** (4): This has one of the best hooks in the rate hands down, I love this hook. I just hate the fact that Haim sound like their singing from underwater, the ugly guitar line, and the fact this song sounds colourless. I can’t give a song a high score it would’ve deserved if it sounded different when it doesn’t.

**wavingwolves** (10): That's such a good cover, she fits this song soooo well. It just feels so calming and I love how raw her vocals sound in it. It deserves such a high position.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): I'm not familiar with the original, but Phoebe's cover is beautiful. I also love Maria Taylor's background vocals, though I selfishly wish it could have been Lucy Dacus since this song would have fit really well on her 2019 EP.

**wavingwolves** (9): And this is our winner! This was actually almost always winning, and at the times it wasn't it was Summer's End at its place. Considering how HAIM were treated in the rate I like the fact they won at least this. I love the original 3 AM and this is no different, I think Thundercat really fits in here and makes the song better, but the lack of voicemail makes me unable to give it a full 10.

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): I really like the production changes and Thundercat's vocals but taking out the voicemails is tragic, they add so much personality to the song. That being said I'm happy HAIM won the bonus rate considering how they fared in the main one.

---

**engifear** (10): I swear everything Thundercat touches turns to gold

**jman457** (10): Thundercat rules

**ktajlili** (10): I love this version too!

**pat-rickstar** (10): This is a great remix, the vocals, instrumental, everything is improved from the original here

**skargardin** (10): wait thundercat is such a good fit here omg i love this

**steelstepladder** (10): This shouldn't work and here I am giving it a 10

**totallynot14\_** (10): they absolutely killed this

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): A fun, chill, alternative to the original. This is a collaboration that works.

**seanderlust** (9.5): BIG improvement imo

**Alumineous** (9): I am missing that intro from the original.

**cremeebrulee** (9): now if it had the voicemail in the beginning this would’ve been perfect

**vayyiqra** (9): Thundercat is a king and needs more respect.Let him play bass on literally everything.

**nick1372** (8.5): I don’t think this works conceptually as a duet but I like Thundercat’s voice and he really fits the vibe

**akanewasright** (8): I miss that voicemail.

**bespectacIed** (8): Elevated the song

**endcreditouilles** (8): Love Thundercat, it does justice on the original but I do like the original better.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I prefer the original. The song was not ruined at all, which happens frequently with remixes. It's just not better than the album version.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): I prefer the original, this just has a different vibe that I don't dig as much, everything feels way "lighter" i guess

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Thundercat can make anything better

**waluigiest** (8): an interesting remix. I’m not sure that it adds anything, but the source material is already so good

**bbfan132** (7): don’t feel like much was added but it still sounds nice

**plastichaxan** (6.2): i'm just giving these songs the same rating as the album cause nothing at all was added to them i fear

**salivantsonority** (6): Again, it's just not as good as the original

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): Original isn't that interesting, neither is this version, Thundercat is only a small improvement. Stream 3am by Halsey instead.

**fadedblue09** (5): Why are they the remixing these filler songs

**OberionSynth** (4): not every song needs a remix bestie

**wavingwolves** (10): This got so high and I can't say I don't understand why with a song like this. This is probably the one that most hits for me, mostly because I have had many struggles when it comes to faith and wanting to believe in something to suffice the ways in which I can't believe in myself and wanting someone to know and accept me in all the ways I can't truly do that for myself. This is such an intense feeling that I always had and every time I listen to this song I'm reminded of how big that still is in my life. This is one of the songs that I feel that is able to express all of my own feelings in a way that helps me understand myself better, and for that I'm so grateful.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): As someone that's struggled with faith and wanting to believe I can really relate with this song. It's also just a beautiful song with some of the best production on the album.

---

**cyborglilith** (11): Beautiful. The lyrics resonate with me, the production brings a tear to my eye. I recently read the famous/infamous haikyuu fanfics "In Another Life" and "the galaxy is endless," and the lyrical content reminds me of them both. God, my heart still aches. Yikes.

**NotWith10000Men** (11): I too love screaming at evangelicals. I thought I would give my 11 to fiona but as soon as I heard this song again I knew what I had to do

**OberionSynth** (11): as someone who left my religion during lockdown, this one hits way too home. the constant wondering if anything is worth it, and not believing any of it but still wanting there to be a forever somehow. this is definitely gonna be another of my "sad at 3am in my car" songs.

**team\_kockroach** (11): On first listen, Punisher didn’t click with me. All of its songs felt too low-energy and subtle, with the sole exception of “Chinese Satellite”. “Chinese Satellite” has by far the best production on the album. A clucking acoustic guitar, big rumbling drums, and a haunting violin line all give the song so. much. atmosphere. Are they upbeat or downbeat? Depends on which mood you’re in when you listen to the song. Phoebe sings a simple melody with utterly bizarre lyrics. In the song, she drowns out morning birds, screams at evangelical Christians, and sees tractor beams. But these lyrics represent hopelessness perfectly - she performs and imagines pointless actions because she can’t see a divine presence in the sky, just Chinese satellites. The song’s most impactful when I superimpose my life experiences on top of it. Unlike Phoebe, I’m a boy from Hong Kong - and Chinese satellites, especially the political kind, are more relevant to me than they are to her. The protests and COVID-19 have both devastated my city over the past two years. I can’t see a divine presence when I look at the sky either, and I’m not feeling hopeful in my current situation. I can’t wait to see what Phoebe does next.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That beat is great.

**akanewasright** (10): Uh... this grew on me a lot lmao.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i think this should start with phoebe saying "god" in the same tone kendrick says "sex" at the beginning of these walls

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah, THAT line was just a 2020 rehash of hayley's iconic airplanes line...But idc. This song slays so hard. 2nd fave on the album. I wish I wrote it, but I didn't, so I made it one of my most scrobbled songs of all time

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The lyrics here really strike a chord with me. I'm not religious at all, but I'm torn between wanting to be wrong and being terrified of being wrong. The theme of desperately wanting to see the people you've lost again - whether you're religious or not it's universal.

**bookthieving** (10): "i want to believe / instead, i look at the sky and i feel nothing" with the strings is such a fucking gut punch

**celladonn** (10): Phoebe scooped this song out of my soul I think, it hits a little too close to home

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): yes I love a good existential crisis

**conceptualromance** (10): probably my fave Phoebe Bridgers song. Everything is top notch here

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): SWORE I COULD FEEL YOU THROUGH THE WALLS, BUT THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE

**fadedblue09** (10): One of my personal favorites here, I love the subtle buildup. The spacey instrumentals and her vocals have this cinematic quality.

**forgetquick** (10): Lyrical perfection.

**iniekcja\_** (10): I never realized how much I listened to this song

**Leixander** (10): the only song from this album that's memorable for me, very beautiful

**leviswift13** (10): the most overlooked song on this album. perfectly captures the feeling of realizing there is no magic in this world while still hoping to be wrong. there's a sense of loss and whimsy to it that i love.

**nick1372** (10): listening to that “you were screaming at the Evangelicals” line is what I imagine smoking crack is like

**runaway3212** (10): THIS IS SO FUCKING GOOD I LOVE THIS SO MUCH

**sarcasticsobs** (10): best choruses on the record

**savemeaseat143** (10): I also want to see people after death

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was one of the immediate standouts for me on my first listen, especially the second verse

**shhhneak** (10): Chinese Satellitarinas let me feel your presence!

**SmileAndTears** (10): I don't really relate to the song cuz I've never been a believer, nor have I ever tried to be one, but the song just sounds sooooo fucking goooooooood

**Stryxen** (10): on her sophomore album punisher, phoebe covers mature emotional themes such as: light pollution

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): a lot of great production moments on this one

**Turpamutteri** (10): I love this song so much

**Uberpigeon** (10): This is such a standout track for me, even if only for the "BUT THATS IMPOSSIBLE!" that makes me want to astral project. The production is amazing and spooky and cool, the lyrics are outstanding.

**vayyiqra** (10): Think I like this so much not because of the music itself, but because I like listening to music late at night and looking at the stars and outer space and so on, and it makes me think of that. The religious themes are there but not really why this hits for me. Also the strings are pretty.

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): My favorite song from my first listen of the album! "I'd stand on a corner embarrassed with a picket sign if it meant I would see you when I die" gives me chills every time

**xcjm** (10): the drums really came THROUGH

**zagreux** (10): Lyrically, this is the best song on Punisher. The part about wanting to believe and have hope but not being able to hits so fucking hard.

**bulforster** (9.6): I ascend with the guitar riff in the outro.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I love how this song starts so calm and quiet but then it picks up its pace at the second verse.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): i never loved this song as much as others do but it’s still great

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (9): I wrote the writeup for this one on the year-end, I'm biased

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I read the genius articles for all songs on the rate, and I found this to be the one that most stuck with me. Just wanting to believe there’s something out there- just to believe someone’s watching out for you, just to believe it all has meaning. It’s something I think about a lot (I’m religious, and a big part of it is because of that) and it’s such a sad, poetic topic.

**CzrLandWhale** (9): Very few songs make me cry, but that line about the picket sign hit me hard.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): "I want to believe / Instead, I look at the sky and I feel nothing" Fuck. As someone who grew up in a Christian household but no longer practices it, my agnostic guilt is hitting me real hard with this song.

**just\_thonking** (9): I was debating between an 8 and an 8.5 so I went on genius dot com and pulled up the lyrics and now it is a 9.

**seanderlust** (9): "But you know I'd stand on the corner / Embarassed with a picket sign / If it meant I would see you when I die" - sincerely, one of the best parts of any verse ever written

**steelstepladder** (9): Phoebe heard Airplanes by BOB and said "this concept is too good for a song this mediocre"

**thedoctordances1940** (9): The violins, the drums, her voice, the guitar, it's absolutely gorgeous

**waluigiest** (9): the verse about the Evangelicals is perfection

**wasian-invasion** (9): you can be my vegetable all you want bb

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): the way the Chinese rocket is reentering the atmosphere as I'm typing this comment, if I'm not in the reveal thread just know I'm enjoying my Dead Like Me era

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): ouch this hit too hard

**jasannn** (8.5): No vegetables allowed

**totallynot14\_** (8.5): I wonder if people from the Chinese space program get annoyed when they try to search up their products

**1998tweety** (8): i like how she gave us some energy here

**frogaranaman** (8): I wonder if a satellite has caught me getting dick

**proscett** (8): i heard someone call this an emo disney song which is all i can think of when i listen to it. this has one of the best melodies on here tho, and phoebe definitely is at her best when she's bringing some drama

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Screaming at evangelicals: the #1 passtime when I was in college

**llieno94** (7): another great metaphor of a title. She’s so desperate to come out of the place she’s in, she wishes on a satellite in the smoggy sky when no stars are in sight.

**jman457** (3.7): I liked the guitars but feels very filler with the rest of the album

**SideBTrack8** (10): I had no idea this song was controversial. For a while it looked like it might not even make top 10, but the later ballots really saved it. It's such a fun and unique song, and the fact that it led to Fiona reconnecting and collaborating with Shameika is so cool.

**wavingwolves** (9): Can you believe this was day 2 for most of the rate? I was very surprised at that, but I also admit that while I think this is incredible, there's songs I like better on the rate as a whole. Still, it made this far, and I'm actually glad. It has such an addictive rhythm and powerful piano, it's definitely one of the most contagious and memorable songs we have here. It's about Fiona's experience with a middle school classmate, who she didn't even know if it was a real person or a figment of her imagination, but nevertheless it was a girl who was important for her. The song in itself talks about how the image others have of you helps to mold your own self perception. It also starts the themes of gender dynamics within women in the record, which goes for several songs.

---

**Alumineous** (11): I don't know what to say for the 11. I found myself singing Shameika said I got potential the past few weeks. Love that piano in the background.

**Hulnia** (11): Literally a perfect song...

**jayjaysortagay** (11): the fact she managed to make a classic out of one random comment from her childhood, iconic

**ReallyCreative** (11): me when someone asks me who said I had potential

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): There can be a hundred people in the room, and 99 don't believe in you, but Shameika does.

**UNDINE\_** (11): Hurricane Gloria in exclesis deo

**waluigiest** (11): It took me a bit to get into the album but I was obsessed with this song from Day 1. It’s hard to describe all of the elements that make it so perfect to me. It’s the way her writing paints such a clear beautiful picture even though she wasn’t even sure of the facts when she wrote this song. It’s the legacy of how Shameika and Fiona, who quite explicitly were not friends, reunited after so many years. I think most of all it’s the frantic pre-chorus, which is truly perfect songwriting: “in class I’d pass the time / drawing a slash for every time / the second hand went by a group of 5 / done 12 times was a minute but”

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I hope Shameika has a great day.

**akanewasright** (10): Idk what to say about this song. It’s like perfect. Listening to this song, I know Fiona, I’m there with her in her childhood.

**bbfan132** (10): this song just hits hard

**bespectacIed** (10): A black woman made fiona who she is right now, I know that's right

**bigbigbee** (10): She’s so good at taking something that isn’t really common language and making it emblematic and inspiring. “Shameika said I have potential” is such a great mantra to repeat to yourself. See also: peas and beans, strawberries.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That piano is going OFF. Really interesting and specific lyrics here too.

**CarlieScion** (10): she was right

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): need a shameika in my life rn

**conceptualromance** (10): can you imagine reconnecting with a classmate because they’re an immensely talented critically acclaimed singer songwriter who wrote a song about how much they admired you because you stood up for them when they were bullied 🥺

**cremeebrulee** (10): an 11 if i had more 11s to give! i love this song so much— i love the way it captures the feeling of having that one right person believe in you and that piano goes crazy

**CrimsonROSET** (10): well shameika had a point

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ok but does she have potential? i missed it

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The only song that instantly resonated with me on my first FTBC listen back when the album came out. Killer piano.

**EnCaine** (10): i love it when people are correct about things

**getin2it** (10): A classic middle-school memory. It's funny but also schmaltzy and angry and every single emotion tied into one.

**iniekcja\_** (10): Shameika spilled

**jman457** (10): Keeps and builds the energy of the opener and the lyrics pain this vivid story.

**llieno94** (10): some of the most interesting percussion in her catalogue, along with songs like Tymps and Fast as You Can.

**ManofOranges** (10): Shameika was right!!

**notoriouspge** (10): Fiona Apple ended bullying

**plastichaxan** (10): oh to be someone fiona apple names in one of her songs

**proscett** (10): this song is so metal

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is just… wow… the flow on this is incredible, the use of repetition is masterful, the instrumental is so full of colour, and "Shameika said I had potential" is just SUCH a great line.

**runaway3212** (10): I love this song so much it's literally so great

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Shameika said I had poTENtial

**skargardin** (10): the piano

**steelstepladder** (10): The scream going into the verse... HEAVENLY

**survivorjdmarina** (10): What I love about this song is the meaning behind it, about not submitting yourself to society expectations, about "having potential". Inspired by a tough girl at her school named Shameika, Fiona writes about how Shameika told her she had potential to branch out on her own and find her own voice. I also think it’s heartwarming that Fiona reunited with Shameika and recorded a song with her. :')

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): an incredible song and the bridge!?!

**Uberpigeon** (10): Hearing the manic piano playing at the start of this song let me know I was in for the ride of my life. The songwriting is immaculate.

**vayyiqra** (10): this song has potential

**Vromega** (10): the chorus is absolutely perfect.

**wasian-invasion** (10): the production is pure chaos and I love it

**xcjm** (10): Shameika was onto something after all

**zagreux** (10): the "I didn't smile because a smile always seemed rehearsed / I wasn't afraid of the bullies and that just made the bullies worse" hits close to home. I hate the narrative that "bullies pick on you because they're jealous of you / you're afraid of them, be a #girlboss and it'll all be ok!" no. bullies pick on you because they're assholes and you're an easy target.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): We all have potential 🧡

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This song gives me a good idea of what I should expect from the album. It's so clear why this song is such a stand-out track in the album considering the subject of the song. It's cool that the real-life Shameika actually got to reunite with Fiona Apple!

**endcreditouilles** (9): I like the production and vocals on this one a lot more than the other tracks on the album, it's got such a bluesy groove. THE PIANO is killer, I'm in love with it.

**fadedblue09** (9): Ngl I kinda don't want this to be her highest ranking song. It's good and essential to the album's theme, but I love the other songs more.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): we love Shameika

**leviswift13** (9): potential is something that can be so personal

**OberionSynth** (9): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, my alarm went off midway through this and i just thought it was a part of the song, spectacular, never the same

**seanderlust** (9): fuck pitchfork, NPR, stereogum and any other music reviews. we only trust shameika's opinions on what has potential

**Stryxen** (9): yeah I guess this unknown underground rising artist has some potential

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i love the writing of this song so much, it feels like a complete vent but is also so well paced and measured and so poetic. i know its not a perfect comparison but it kinda feels similar to supermodel by sza in that aspect to me

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): It was my favorite on first listen, and maybe still is. God, the piano is mind-blowing.

**QustoMar** (8.5): shameika is a girlboss methinks

**NotWith10000Men** (8): "But she got through to me and I'll never see her again." ugh happy tears

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): It’s weird that Shameika became the song that everyone gravitated to on Fetch The Bolt Cutters when it dropped, because initially I was really cold on it, and the way the chorus has developed a small meme following, it’s grown on me since but I wouldn’t call it amazing with the small details that make this song seem very adolescent, still isn’t among the best on Fetch The Bolt Cutters but I wouldn’t be that upset if it lasted to Day 3

**CzrLandWhale** (7): and Shameika was right.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): imo not as good as other songs on this album but i still like this, it’s cute

**rosecult** (7): i wish i had potential :(

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): Who the fuck is Shameika? I want to like this more, but it sounds annoying.

**SmileAndTears** (4.5): Well I'm not gonna say shameika was wrong or anything but...

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (4): I don't like this song and I understand that makes me tasteless.

**cyborglilith** (0): I can't stand the chorus.

**mudkip1** (0): my problem with shameika isn't the lyrical content or anything like that, i find it to be rather unappealing to listen to even after all this time. the bridge isn't very pretty to me, she sings it in a rushed manner which i'm sure is the intention but i don't like the delivery. everything after the bridge isn't enjoyable to listen to either. i tend to enjoy the album a lot more when i skip it. sorry fiona and shameika

**wavingwolves** (10): And here it comes, our highest rated Fiona song. And his was almost always the case, for at least 99% of the rate. I adore this song and think the way it grows and pulses is a marvelous experience. It expresses one of our most deepest and common wants: to love and be loved in return by someone, anyone. It also showcases a big determination to affirm your place in the world as well, as we can see in the second verse. About that, Fiona has said "“If a tree falls in the forest and no one’s around to hear it, does it make a sound?” Yes, it does. Because a vibration happens. Whether or not you’re there to hear it. I exist whether or not you see me. These things about me are true whether or not you acknowledge them. That’s at least the second verse." and that's probably one of my favourite things I've read last year, it was incredibly reassuring in times of isolation, when no one sees you and you spend so much time with yourself and looking inside that it becomes maddening. Just for that I think this song deserves its place and all the praise in the world.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): This song is such a mood. "I know that time is elastic" hits especially hard after the year we've had. What even is time anymore?

---

**bespectacIed** (11): Also my 11 to the indieheads ultimate rate. And lost. This rate won't be any different, I have accepted defeat to the sad blonde guitar smashing bimbo overlord. But this is the greatest written song in this rate, possibly of 2020, arguably of all time. The lyrics are just exquisite, my gawd.

**brenda\_official** (11): most streamed song of 2020 yass

**chookyboy** (11): the first time i heard the opening notes to this song i knew this was going to be the album of the year and i was right

**fadedblue09** (11): Throughout this album, Fiona uses her songwriting to convey emotions that speak to people with specific experiences (to women, to abuse victims, among others). But in this track, Fiona captures the simple idea of desiring love, and does it in a nuance that is so universally human (the second verse says it all). And the fact she did this with a piano (a.k.a my favorite musical instrument) is just the cherry on top. I wish I could go on and gush about this more, but you get the idea.

**getin2it** (11): The 11 is merited enough just from the dolphin sounds at the end. The piano sounds so pure and crisp, and Fiona sounds better than ever. It's so good as a long-time fan to hear her sound this good, both vocally and mentally.

**jman457** (11): Brilliant opening to the album, lyrics feel universal yet the performance feels so unique. Also love the uncredited sextina aquafina feature.

**Leixander** (11): pure happiness

**martintorov** (11): this song is perfect and somehow elevates the live recording of 2013 that was already magical.

**musical\_pyn** (11): this opening piano line is so so good, very regina spektor esque, and the lyric "but I know a sound is still a sound around no one" might be my favorite on the entire album (and yes the dolphin noises are good). Every single time Apple sings "I want" I ascend a little more.

**nootnoot781** (11): giving this my 11 because 1. reddit user mudkip1 said i should, 2. it’s a fantastic song, 3. BANG IT! BITE IT! BRUISE IT! and 4. for the dolphin noises outro

**plastichaxan** (11): the dolphin noises at the end, the whole breakdown... chef's kiss

**rosecoloreds** (11): i wouldn't be able to look in the mirror if i didn't give it an 11

**survivorjdmarina** (11): This song blew me away the first time I ever listened to it. Although it’s the most "Fiona Apple" song on the album, it perfectly encapsulates the themes of the album and showcases a new side of Fiona we hadn’t seen. However, the obvious standout of the track is the last fifteen seconds, featuring the "dolphin noises", which I absolutely love and was enamoured by the first time I listened to it. A truly perfect opening track.

**welcometoNY** (11): I continue to be blown away by this song. The second verse, and especially the bridge, are some of the most heartwrenching, evocative lyricism I can think of, and although I thought the vocal take was a bit rough at first, I've come to appreciate how emotional it is.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): Pretty much a perfect song. Great opener. Love love love. Should have been as popular as Blinding Lights, basically.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Queen of the dolphins

**Alumineous** (10): The last 20 seconds is my childhood goldfish's dying last words.

**Awkward\_King** (10): not me treating this rate ballot like a therapy session

**bbfan132** (10): once the piano comes in… pure bliss

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is the best opening track out of the three albums.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I still remember hearing this as soon as I woke up on release day (I was going to bed really early at the time) and holy shit the chills this gave me... it's so powerful

**conceptualromance** (10): this is my favorite song on the album!

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is the girl moving with a porpoise that black midi was talking about

**DaHumanTorch** (10): queen of dolphin noises

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm not seeing how this song is more likely to win than Shameika, but it's amazing nonetheless.

**kirby31200** (10): Oh god, she's gone full dolphin

**leviswift13** (10): an exquisite opener. "while i'm in this body i want somebody to want and i want what i want and i want you" is one of the greatest musical moments of the last few years

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): great opener

**mudkip1** (10): one of my 11 contenders. i wrote a cute lil thing about the song in the popheads top 100 of 2020 list. you can read it [here if you'd like](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/kyrcji/the_top_100_tracks_of_2020_according_to_rpopheads/gjj9vp3/)

**proscett** (10): i want you all to display taste and give this a high ranking!

**ReallyCreative** (10): me to all of my friends' pets

**seanderlust** (10): ft. sextina awkafina from bojack horseman

**skargardin** (10): this is how you start an album!!

**Stryxen** (10): this song hits me so hard it went right through me and became a part of me and it wasn’t even an 11 contender - this rate is so strong

**thedoctordances1940** (10): An absolutely gorgeous opener for the album, the piano is absolutely beautiful.

**totallynot14\_** (10): youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu

**Uberpigeon** (10): An amazing first track. When I first sat down to listen, having never even heard of Fiona before this, this track immediately grabbed me and I knew I was going to enjoy myself. The joyous pining that takes an dramatic turn at the end never gets old.

**waluigiest** (10): I love how unmoored this song feels. When she sings “I know none of this will matter in the long run” in her raspy voice in a different meter than the piano..... that’s an artist baby

**wasian-invasion** (10): queen of the dolphins

**xcjm** (10): I know that time is elastic.. Miss Apple with the big brain energy

**zagreux** (10): it's the dolphin noises for me.

**outsideeyess** (9.7): tense but also very calming, a great opener

**bigbigbee** (9.5): People have compared FTBC to a “one woman off-Broadway show”. If you accept that premise, then this is a fantastic opening number; I can picture the lights coming up on a bare stage. This song outlines the main theme of the album – the desired to be loved – that motivates the emotions in all the other songs. The presence of this song subtly changes how I understand many of the other songs, and for that, it’s one of my favorite openers I’ve heard.

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Dolphin queen

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): love everything about the piano playing.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): absolutely love the production and piano riff on this but her vocals when she says “you” at some parts are just not it for me. Also why the dolphin noises at the end I-

**rickikardashian** (8.5): *dolphin emoji*

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): English & Dolphin; a bilingual queen

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I love the intro to this song. Also… BANG IT BITE IT BRUISE IT.

**forgetquick** (7.5): Great song but I can't deal with these dolphin noises.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): really great intro to the album, but the dolphin noises at the end kind of take me out of it and knock it down a peg

**just\_thonking** (7): I subtracted 0.5 for the squealing

**SmileAndTears** (7): why did she turn into a dolphin at the end plz...

**endcreditouilles** (6): Interesting opening and uniquely composed, but there's a lot that I don't click with. The vocal style especially, not my cup of tea. But I love the piano though.

**flavasavavandal** (6): If this is one of the last Fiona songs in the rate, I will actually snap, this is mediocre compared to the majority of the album

**NotWith10000Men** (6): the piano is so lovely. The elongated youuuuuus, not so much

**QustoMar** (6): a real, i am here, listening to artsy music type of intro

**wavingwolves** (10): More like Weeby Bridgers, am i right? ~~joke stolen from my wonderful friend u/bigbigbee~~ This was for the whole rate second place and I don't think this is going to be a surprise. This is a song I absolutely love and it brings me both comfort and also absolute catharsis, while still being a full on banger, and I know this is true to a lot of people too. Phoebe while talking about this song says it's about "always wanting to be where I’m not, which I think is pretty not special of a thought, but it is true" and that's exactly why it resonates so much with people, especially in the last year where our homes became almost unbearable places at times. This also touches on family dynamics and explores the complexities of that and how intense and almost violent our feelings can be towards our parents sometimes, and how difficult that is when they're the people we are "supposed" to love. That's something that touches me a lot and I appreciate it so much more for that.

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): This song has just never totally clicked for me. There's been so much hype for it since it came out which I've never totally understood, even though I think it's a great song. It also just sticks out a little too much from the rest of the album for me.

---

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): This is (obviously) the first song I listened to from Phoebe before starting this rate and I really loved the production and Phoebe's vocals here. When I looked at the lyrics, however, that's when my love for the song increased so much. Not to make a typical daddy issues comment about the song but I have such a hugely conflicting relationship with my father so I totally feel her resentment. For that, I'll be awarding this song with my well-deserved 11. It's definitely not only my favorite track in the album but also the entire rate.

**EnCaine** (11): yes i'm giving my 11 to a basic pick 😭 sometimes you find one of those songs that just hits way too close to home and this is one

**hikkaru** (11): filing it under bops about ur shitty father

**ManofOranges** (11): There was a time when I used to not really understand Phoebe or her music. I found it annoying and overly candid without anything really interesting going on. To me it was just very boring acoustic music set to some kind of depressing lyrics. That all changed one night when I listened to this song one fateful night. Earlier this year, close to the beginning of the semester, I was having a major crisis rearding my future and my career. I genuinely wasn't sure if I was going down the right career path, if I would be happy doing what I would be doing, if I should just drop everything and switch my major on a whim because of how I was feeling at that moment. It was all just so much. And it all came to a head on January 17th of this year. I had spent the early part of the evening listening to the Main Pop Boys of 1987 rate because it was literally due that night and I ended up giving Man in the Mirror my 11 because I was in actually in a very self-reflective mood and looking at the man in my mirror was what I felt like I needed to do in order to get over these career problems of mine. So the night goes on and I continue doing some thinking over my future and it only gets more and more grim because the fact of the matter is that I was literally 19 and was having to choose what I wanted to do for the rest of my life and felt like if I fucked it up then I would literally negatively impact my entire future. My mood slowly declines as time goes on. Light fades from my apartment. At this point I'm sitting alone in the living room and I just feel a sense of dread that I only feel when my state of mind is at a truly low point. The last song on Sign O' the Times fades out, I finish my scores for that rate, turn them in, and am left wondering what the fuck I am supposed to do now. I remember hearing about Kyoto and hearing how Punisher was a critically acclaimed album and all that and decide that I would finally give them album a shot because obviously I was in the perfect emotional state to do such a thing. I listen to DVD Menu and Garden Song just fine, although I can feel like the emotional flood gates are going to give way at any time. And then this song comes on. And immediately I start to feel the tears coming. There's something so wonderfully candid about the lyrics even from the jump with "day off at Kyoto," that just connected with me. And by the time Phoebe started singing "I don't forgive you, but please don't hold me to it" I was bawling on my couch, alone and in the dark. And the trumpets just gave me a sense of euphoria that I truly could not have gotten from any other song at that point. I felt so free. I felt like, in that moment, everything had been lifted off of my shoulders. For those 4 minutes of the song, I felt like whatever I chose for my career was going to be okay, that I would be alright, come rain or come shine. And then the song ended. And I played it again. And again. And again. I must've listened to it at least 20 times that night. Because it truly gave me a feeling of being alive. And even though at the she says she's a liar, I always heard it as "I'm alive" because sometimes there's nothing more reassuring than just telling yourself that you're still alive. It absolutely meant the world to me.

**martian\_pet** (11): This might not be her best song but it got me into Phoebe and i love it for that reason

**midnight\_thief** (11): reminds me of Sufjan's Chicago... really bright, summery, yet introspective lyrically

**NecroDolphinn** (11): 2020 SOTY

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I love when songs include really specific and personal details in their lyrics, and this album does that a lot

**slimboyfriend** (11): Finally some daddy issues representation

**SmileAndTears** (11): "I don't forgive you" is one of the most heartbreaking line I've ever heard in a song

**thedoctordances1940** (11): Kyoto (/ˈkjoʊtoʊ/;[4] Japanese: 京都, Kyōto [kʲoꜜːto], officially Kyōto City (京都市, Kyōto-shi, [kʲoːtoꜜɕi], is the capital city of Kyōto Prefecture in Japan. It's also the best fucking song of 2020!

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): Horns! This was the song that got me onto her (thank you, diary of a song)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The trumpet is a nice addition. Is it a trumpet? Well it’s certainly a horn instrument.

**akanewasright** (10): Why do I relate to songs about parental issues, I don’t even hate mine

**Awkward\_King** (10): i hate my dad

**bbfan132** (10): i am winnie the pooh in the poohascend gif/emote when the chorus hits

**bespectacIed** (10): Just impossible to hate. The wry songwriting, the classic indie rock production, the bait-and-switch of making a song named after an exciting, lively city -- be about boredom and disillusionment with her life. Phoebe easily made a modern classic with this. Shoutout to the lyric "I WANNA KILL YOU IF YOU DON'T BEAT ME TO IT" ... her mind?????

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): AND THE TRUMPETS THEY GO

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I'd let Phoebe kill me tbh

**bulforster** (10): This song dredges up a lot of shit for me. I can relate to a lot of the dynamic with her dad that Phoebe's singing about but also my parents are immigrants from countries I've never lived in and don't feel fully at home in so the line " I wanted to see the world so I flew over the ocean, then I changed my mind" really hits and by the time she gets to the last "I'm a liiiaarr" I'm always a wreck.

**CarlieScion** (10): I would be v happy if this wins

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): when the brass kicks in aaaaaaaaaahhhhhhh

**conceptualromance** (10): I fucking love horns. Anything with horns is amazing. Also really like the vocal harmonies. woo!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ok but the orchestral arrangement in james corden kinda made some points

**cyborglilith** (10): holy shit

**CzrLandWhale** (10): woo!

**endcreditouilles** (10): I love the songwriting, her lyricism is incredible. And the composition is so warm and nostalgic, I love the trumpet. It reminds me a bit of Noah and The Whale.

**fadedblue09** (10): An instant classic at first listen. The production, Phoebe’s delivery and the lyrics have this cinematic vibe, it’s like listening to this song feels like watching a movie. I hope that one day y’all will realize that this is the true standout track of the album.

**forgetquick** (10): Love the Sufjan-esque horns that disguise the absolutely devastating lyrics. The outro is everything.

**frogaranaman** (10): I would love to get dick in Kyoto

**ggal2020** (10): According to lastfm this is my number one most listened to song of all time. It’s honestly cruel that we can’t have more than one 11

**ignitethephoenix** (10): definitely one of the best from the album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The little woo after the first chorus is so cute.

**iniekcja\_** (10): banger

**jasannn** (10): This is the perfect indie-rock song.

**jman457** (10): Doing this Phoebe can get more than one high energy/up-tempo song per album!!

**leviswift13** (10): for a song that is so sad and dark it sounds so FUN and breezy. the horns really add so much atmosphere.

wavingwolves: **MoonlightByWindow** (10): me when i write a song about the international treaty which extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change that commits state parties to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, based on the scientific consensus that global warming is occurring and that human-made CO₂ emissions are driving it

**musical\_pyn** (10): I completely believe the reason this album was so well received was because of this track, showing that phoebe's lyricism works not just in her traditional tracks, but even on something upbeat--plus those HORNS. an 11 contender

**nick1372** (10): those fuckin horns man

**notoriouspge** (10): DAAAAA DADADADADAAAAA

**OberionSynth** (10): queen of traveling but only in lyrics (dua what's good), queen of daddy issues (same girl)

**pat-rickstar** (10): All Phoebe has to do is put horns in a song and it's an automatic 10 from me

**pheromenos** (10): i'mmmm gonna kill youuuu ^if you don't beat me to it

**plastichaxan** (10): her music usually doesn't click with me but this is a real hit, everything about this is incredible and if i could give two 11s this would be the other one

**proscett** (10): after listening to garden song, this feels like hyperpop

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Phoebe Bridgers: "There's so many songs about Tokyo, it's kinda cliche, guess I can't write a song about Tokyo… unless?"

**sarcasticsobs** (10): this is better than every single slow version she keeps putting out

**seanderlust** (10): one of the easiest 10s in this rate

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I also hate my dad

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The twin choruses "I'm gonna kill you/if you don't beat me to it" and "I don't forgive you/but please don't hold me to it" both have such interesting and raw eotions, and really show progress and change in Phoebe's relationships as time goes by

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Far and beyond the best song here. A rock banger!!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): people with bad relationships with your dad rise!!!

**Uberpigeon** (10): an absolute fucking banger, probably her best vocal performance and her screaming "I'm gonna kill you" hits me hard every single time I listen. Also I relate to having daddy issues.

**waluigiest** (10): I am in love with this indie-esque sound - the upbeat blend of electronic, rock, and more orchestral instruments. It’s truly excellent and the lyrics are fun too.

**wasian-invasion** (10): Ms Skeltal goes Doooot Doot Doot Doot Doot Dooot Dooot

**xcjm** (10): I had a great relationship with my father before Phoebe dropped Kyoto

**xxipil0ts** (10): It really is baffling how this song was meant to be a slow ballad and yet it managed to get the point across. The song became more passive-aggressive than it was with the song being more Folk Rock.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.9): This is full of lyrical layers that reveal themselves upon repeated listening. It’s more than a jaunty indie song about feeling homesick. The craving for familiarity can be read as a metaphor for continuing to care about people who have been toxic, out of habit or a sense of obligation (hello Savior Complex!), and I love the way Phoebe weaved those concepts together.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): parental resentment BOP

**rosecult** (9.5): i miss being in Kyoto :(

**TiltControls** (9.5): a little overrated, but still fantastic

**steelstepladder** (9.3): Not one of the songs I go back to often from the album honestly but still a great choice for a single.

**bigbigbee** (9): This is not related to the song’s quality whatsoever, but why are there so many songs about Japan by white artists? Why not Berlin, or Chiang Mai? This is why we need to support Oli London. King of promoting South Korea.

**ReallyCreative** (9): would have liked the album to have a little more of this, I really think Phoebe shines with a less cramped sound

**runaway3212** (9): SCORPIOS SUCK

**Stryxen** (9): I can’t even begin to describe the relationship I have with this song, just like Phoebe and her father

**totallynot14\_** (9): this is probably going to win

**UrbanisminEgypt** (9): One of my least favorite songs off of Punisher, meaning its amazing.

**zagreux** (9): the horns here omg

**1998tweety** (7): this is appropriation

**jayjaysortagay** (7): i thought y'all said she was edgy? I'm genuinely shook listening to this because I was expecting rock

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the chorus is really good, wish it kept more of that energy in the whole song but the change from verse to chorus is fine too.

**vayyiqra** (7): Feeling kind of bad because this song seems to be a critical and fan favourite and is about her fraught relationship with her father and I had one of those too (not now though we're good now) and should relate to this more but idk

**welcometoNY** (6): i do not get the hype

**salivantsonority** (5): I'm sorry; I just do not connect with it lmao.

**wavingwolves** (10): Most predictable winner ever? Maybe. Still a worthy one? Totally. This song is catharsis and liberation. It starts slow and it builds till it can't build anymore and then it just breaks. It feels not too dissimilar from watching a tide wave coming your way, but in a good way. This is probably one of the best closing tracks I've ever listened to and it makes the whole experience of the album that much more worth it when it get to the last 2 and a half minutes of it. This was one of my absolutely anthems of 2020, a year where I felt pure desolation and hopelessness. And, even with all the anguish this showcases, the climax of the track feels so triumphant that it makes me feel both hopeful and comforted about what the future brings.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): An unfortunately predictable winner, it was never even close. That being said, it's still an amazing song and absolutely deserves the win. Once the buildup starts it doesn't stop until the final screams, and what an amazing way to close the album. I don't know how Phoebe is able to end such an emotionally heavy album with quiet giggles and have it fit so perfectly.

---

# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**bookthieving** (11): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**pheromenos** (11): i love catharsis. i love album closers. i LOVE cathartic album closers. this is like 2020 in a song. AHHHHHH

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Phoebe's strongest songs tend to fall into one of two categories for me; songs that let you wallow in emotion, let it all engulf and consume you (Smoke Signals, Garden Song etc.), or songs that are just pure, intense emotional catharsis, scream out all the pain and get it out of your system (Kyoto, Motion Sickness etc.). The beauty of I Know the End is that it's both of these things. The first half let's you soak in loneliness, only to build towards one big fuck the world, fuck all this bullshit, we're all gonna die anyway so just scream it tf out and move on. And it works, and that's why I adore it so damn much. Anyway, with that out of the way.... AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHH

**rickikardashian** (11): there's nothing I can say that hasn't been said before or won't be said in the other 11 comments so I'll just AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**seanderlust** (11): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**static\_int\_husp** (11): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**TiltControls** (11): Back when this came out I think I had this whole album on repeat constantly. It makes me think of isolation caused by the pandemic. Not in a bad way, but it provided me a good outlet for all the feelings and reminds me of that fact. The pick-up at the end is also the perfect way to end both the song and the album. It's a sparse song already perfect for a warm lonely summer night, and charged with those feelings are enough to bump it up to the 11 (though I love Punisher title track and was heavily considering it too). Also 'AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA'

**wasian-invasion** (11): AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHH AAAAAAAAHHHHH AAAAAAHHHH cough AAAAHHHH

**Awkward\_King** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**CzrLandWhale** (10): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!

**ManofOranges** (10): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!! Talk about a fucking ending. HOLY SHIT. I wish I could hear this song for the first time again.

**plastichaxan** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**sarcasticsobs** (10): AAAAAAUUUGGGGHHAAAAGHHHAAAAAAAAAAA

**skargardin** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH

**Stryxen** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA etc.

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): AHHHHHHHH is one of my favorite lyrics

**engifear** (9): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

# They know the end

**\_SoulGlitch** (11): wilhelm scream left in shambles

**Brendon-Urine** (11): The Virgin "Kyoto" vs. The Chad "I Know The End" (I still vividly remember the CHILLS I got hearing this song for the first time, life-changing tbh)

**bulforster** (11): The perfect culmination to the album; towards the beginning of lockdown when my sleep schedule was completely scuffed and the album had just come out, I would time my listens so I could watch the sun rise to this song and that scream marking the dawn feels extremely appropriate for 2020. If this is what the apocalypse sounds like, sign me up.

**celladonn** (11): Nothing makes me feel the way this song does

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): i know most of the comments are going to be about the screaming (either positively or negatively) but its just one of the most cathartic things I've ever heard tbh

**corrodedbeauty** (11): The scream, the horns, the apocalyptic feel... yes

**CrimsonROSET** (11): I mean, what do you want from me?

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): Beautiful song and a highlight of last year. The perfect way to end an amazing album.

**endcreditouilles** (11): "Somewhere in Germany, but I can't place it. Man, I hate this part of Texas." As someone who was born in Germany but doesn't remember much about my life there because I moved to Texas when I was young, I very literally feel this. It amazes me how specific and accurate her lyrics are for me. How does she do this lol. Overall, lyrics are brilliant in this track as they were throughout the album. They hit home in such an unique way, and they add so much to each song. The build is exceptional, a perfect climax to an emotional and heart-wrenching album.

**ggal2020** (11): Last week I drove to Joshua Tree in the dark and I saw the craggy mountains and silhouettes of joshua trees rising above me as I drove up the valley out of Palm Springs. The stars were faint above my head as I screamed this song and bawled my eyes out. The end IS near. And it’s wonderful.

**hunnybee12** (11): the last verse in one of the greatest pieces of music in modern history no doubt

**ICanBeAPhantom13** (11): Literally the best song of 2020, no competition

**ignitethephoenix** (11): A no brainer 11 for me. Ngl this rate isn’t my typical genre of music and this song did not click with me the first time I heard it. However after a few more listens, this just hit for me especially by the ending. It’s a perfect build up. I wish their were more songs like this on the album but then again this being the ending song and it sounding like this is worth it.

**IIIHenryIII** (11): It's so chaotic, so majestic and so dramatic. This is one of my all time favorite songs. It's high up there on my list. The trumpets on the other tracks sound so good, but their sound can't keep up with the one on this song. Also, the most perfect final track I've heard. Those screams give me life every single time. I just wish my wording was better so I could do this masterpiece justice.

**jasannn** (11): This is how you make an ~6 minute song interesting.

**ktajlili** (11): I don't even like this album but Kyoto / Garden Song / and this show so much potential. There were a lot of songs that I would be happy to give my 11 to, but this one just felt so on point for 2020.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (11): This would be a great song in any spot on the album but it being the ending of the record just really really makes it. That final scream? It encapsulates every emotion that precedes it on the record. I don't want to put Phoebe down in her young career, but she is going to be hard pressed to make a better album closer than this, and maybe even a song better than this. It's her best track by a mile and a half.

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): is this a basic choice for an 11? yes. do i care? no. (also the part with the horns really reminds me of something off sufjan’s illinois album, another album we need to rate)

**Ngee301** (11): the main reason why i gave this an 11 is because of the third verse and the outro, i knew from the first listen that i'd be obsessed with it

**nishidahall** (11): My song of 2020 from my album of 2020.

**notoriouspge** (11): This song truly captured the existential crises we were having during this pandemic. Easily the best closer for me out of these three albums.

**pat-rickstar** (11): These albums are all great but there was never any question over this being my 11, I could write an essay on how much I love this song, especially the buildup and outro

**Quiet-Tone13** (11): I love the lyrics, the build, the melody, the structure, and how it fits into the album as a whole.

**quinnpsych** (11): I mean obviously, gives me chills when the horns come in every single time
[/r/popheads/comments/ndty8i/2020_pitchfork_acclaim_rate_reveal_day_3_yeah_i/gyd7ms9/]

=====

wavingwolves: **Raykel** (11): I feel like albums with a narrative usually end happier on the last track, or at least accepting of what is. But with this it's literally the end of the world and Phoebe does not accept it at all. It's horrifying, uncontrollable, and complete chaos– and all she can do is scream. I felt that.

**runaway3212** (11): the best closer ever

**SFbby** (11): *INDISCERNABLE SCREAMING* The slow but steady buildup of this song leads into a cathartic swirl of voices and instruments screaming to release all the pent-up emotions of 2020 - a perfect song to close the year on.

**shesdoingyoga** (11): This was one of my favorite songs of 2020. The first half of the song is gorgeous and would stand on its own, but then the way it switches and the build up to the release at the end is just phenomenal

**subject\_memory\_2417** (11): - the apocalyptic images, the tempo build up, everything is just intoxicating. The dusty small-town America background completes it.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): Man, I hate this part of this Texas

**tinyleapsoffaith19** (11): it is hauntingly beautiful!!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): such a cathartic song, especially after the switch-up when the 3rd verse starts. the horns, the screaming,the backing vocals, the fake audience roar Phoebe makes at the end of the song... its all just perf

**TragicKingdom1** (11): incredible lyrically with an Americana aesthetic that panders directly to me, plus an incredibly satisfying buildup and release of tension. the 6 minutes fly by effortlessly. my 3rd favorite song of 2020

**Turpamutteri** (11): This is an absolutely perfect song. The way it builds into this explosive ending is just fantastic.

**Uberpigeon** (11): My favourite song of 2020. I would call this the perfect slow-burn song but indieheads would crucify me for giving that title to a 5 minute track. It starts out as a very minimal ballad, and then the drum beats kick in and I feel like I'm getting teleported to on a roadtrip to hell. The apocalyptic build up at the end is absolutely PHENOMENAL.

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (11): literal perfection

**xxipil0ts** (11): This song was a slow burn from the get-go but once you reach the next half, it felt so Sufjan Steven-esque and it fits so much to the message of the song. The nihilism the song exudes was also something new to (probably) everyone since most pop or rock songs felt 'relatable'. This was also a perfect way to end the album as I can hear DVD menu playing at the background; it felt as though the slbum hit full-circle at that point.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A phenomenal closer.

**AquariusTeaSpilled** (10): I would argue that this is the best closing track of all time

**bbfan132** (10): absolutely brilliant

**bespectacIed** (10): Ugh most predictable win ever and undeserving because that means fiona loses a rate again ... but also kinda deserving because this is a motherfucking epic legendaric life-changing smash. Cue in the indiscriminate, guttural screaming

**bigbigbee** (10): Both sections of this song are just perfect; on their own, they’d both be incredible, but together, they’re even better. Between this and Should Have Known Better on Carrie & Lowell, I think I have a special spot for songs that are able to pull off a transition. I also may be biased because screaming (well. typing.) “AHHH” in the plug (RIP) at the Top 100 song reveal was actually hugely cathartic for me. And more horns in music, please.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was the runner-up for my eleven. It's a self-evidently fantastic song.

**conceptualromance** (10): I expect this to be in the top 10 100%. This really feels like a Black Parade moment to me

**cremeebrulee** (10): congrats to our winner, i will be shocked if this doesnt have like a 9.8 average/break the 11 record bc it deserves! if fiona wasn’t here i would for sure 11 this, like i was obsessed with listening to this before bed like a lullaby lol. also if you werent in plug when this song was played in the top 100 2020 tracks reveal, u missed out bc it’s a top 5 ph moment for sure

**cyborglilith** (10): brought me to tears. somehow

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I'm giving this a 10 and I'm still going to be upset at this song winning, even though it deserves to.

**forgetquick** (10): The scream. THE SCREAM. Really solidified Punisher in my head as the ultimate pandemic album.

**frogaranaman** (10): something something the end of dick I dunno I’m running out of creative energy to continue this comment theme

**getin2it** (10): Literal perfection -- Point Blank Period.

**iniekcja\_** (10): the end literally went there and came back here again, this is such a strong track

**just\_thonking** (10): blows me away every time. Can't wait to see it win

**leviswift13** (10): a close runner-up to moon song for the 11. i mean, it is the end of the world in a way that is gory, grotesque, brilliant, sad and glorious. hearing the end of this song for the first time is an experience that is unlike anything else. one of the only songs that captures that first-time thrill EVERYTIME. perfect closer.

**llieno94** (10): I’m a sucker for any song that has two distinctive sections, and this song perfectly escalates from one side a spectrum to the other and kind takes you by surprise. It’s explosive end is as perfect a closer as Garden song is as an opener and the two songs (the best on the record imo) mark the creative an emotional journey of an artist whose work I can’t wait see to develop further.

**martian\_pet** (10): The best song in this album, would be my 11 if not because i gave it to kyoto

**musical\_pyn** (10): there is so much here that I like, but my favorite moment is 1000% "some America-first rap country song"

**nick1372** (10): also the music video from this one is INCREDIBLE

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is the one song that I think Phoebe really capitalizes on her potential, from start to finish, a masterpiece. come on trumpets!!

**shhhneak** (10): SOMEWHERE IN GERMANY BUT I CAN’T PLACE IT MAN I HATE THIS PART OF TEXAS CLOSE MY EYES FANTASIZE THREE CLICKS AND I’M HOME. Elevenworthy. This song is modern poetry and outsold an entire book of Rupi Kaur.

**steelstepladder** (10): One of the best closers in music history

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Yeah, this is a stunning closer. The change up in the middle is great.

**team\_kockroach** (10): “America-first rap country song” might be the funniest line that Phoebe’s ever put to paper.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I actually gave this my 11 when I did the Indieheads Ultimate rate but I swapped it around this time. The buildup in the third verse is nothing short of incredible, driven by the guitar and drums you can tell it's leading to an epic climax and what an epic climax it is. The sufjan-esque horns, the booming drums and that. fucking. scream. This is how you close out the best album of 2020.

**totallynot14\_** (10): the end of the rate is here because this is #1

**UrbanisminEgypt** (10): One of the best songs ever made.

**waluigiest** (10): this is the best Sufjan Stevens song I’ve ever heard

**xcjm** (10): and also 10 because I see this song as like I Know / The End. Also more screaming on tracks please!

**akanewasright** (9.9): I will be kind of upset when this beats Fiona, but I’ll understand

**savemeaseat143** (9.6): guitar smash!

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): "some america-first rap country song" yes step on their necks

**OberionSynth** (9): the end of this song perfectly describes driving through the south and i hate it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): Anyone who lives in a shit country can definitely relate to this song. I am anyone.

# They don't, I guess

**1998tweety** (8): u know the first time i heard this i thought the screaming was amazing but now its just ok

**vayyiqra** (8): *Darkness took me, and I strayed out of thought and time ... Stars wheeled over, and each day was as long as a life-age of the earth. But it was not the end. I felt life in me again.* :pensive:

**zagreux** (8): it's her coughing at the end for me

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7): don't connect with this song the way other people do but the craft is just soooo high level

**CarlieScion** (7): the ending goes off but the start is like ,,, meh

**rosecult** (7): *softly smashes guitar on SNL to this song*

**jman457** (6.5): I feel like I will listen to this song in 6 months and regret this rating

**fadedblue09** (6): Idk, I never revisit this outside the album. Not to mention most of the lyrics are disjointed and don't make sense. Maybe one day I'll understand why everyone obsesses over this so much. But not now.

**proscett** (6): i know this score is sacrilegious... but i don't feel anything for this song. i like the horns on it though!

**Vromega** (6): the 5 first minutes of the song are so good but I just hate the last minute. Why is it here ? Why It just ends the album on an horrible note for me

**jayjaysortagay** (5): it's just generic... I genuinely want someone to explain what is special about this album pls.

wavingwolves: # Women In Music Pt III

---

**Overall Average**: 8.027 **// Average Controversy:** 1.516

[All user averages](https://paste.ee/p/kUAwa)

---

**SideBTrack8** (9.438): One of my all time favourite albums. I was already in love with the first three singles, but as soon as I heard The Steps I knew this album was gonna be something special. I was a casual HAIM fan before, but now I consider them one of my all time favs. I can't wait to see where they go from here.

**wavingwolves** (9.025): [How it makes me feel](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/40/52/66/40526689a6c4b7288086a8edb0f62c79.gif)

---
**AquariusTeaSpilled** (9.688): best album of the year

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.500): 2019-2020 was a wonderful time to be a HAIM stan.

**ggal2020** (9.500): I waited for this album for over a year and release night felt like Christmas Day. It's a 16 track record and still every song is better than the best song in most artists' discographies.

**ReallyCreative** (9.431): As a long time HAIM fan, this is the album I was waiting for. This has a little bit of everything while remaining cohesive, coherent, and without compromise. An absolute powerhouse album that will unfortunately be tanked.

**shhhneak** (9.300): I have a deep love for this album but it’s become a struggle to listen to. It was THE album in my last relationship. I have so many memories of us dancing around the kitchen and screaming out the lyrics to this. WIMP3 is still just as good but it’s bittersweet alone.

**leviswift13** (9.125): the album i've been waiting for from haim! it really feels like a *level up* in so many ways. their previous two works are both immaculate, but the songwriting here is just so fucking good and elevated and strong and sturdy. as always, their musicianship is outstanding. the way this world they've created feels so light yet dark, broken yet hopeful. i love love love wimpiii

**IIIHenryIII** (9.063): I love this. It's one of my favorite albums that came out last year. It's up there on top 5. I love how organic it sounds, but we still get some computerized sounds on some tracks. I experience something so unique whenever I listen to it: it makes me want to dance. I never had this need before. That's so weird.

**welcometoNY** (9.031): I was never really able to get into HAIM prior to this album, but after listening I finally understood what all the hype was about. The melodies and harmonies are where they really shine here, but the lyrics and production can't be discounted either.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.025): I listened to this pretty late in 2020, and it’s now one of my favourites from that year. I’m especially impressed with the guitar work here. Really great album!

**nick1372** (8.844): The collection of disparate styles and sounds on this is actually insane. Upon first listen it means that a lot of the songs don’t necessarily stand out because they’re all just so different. But I never ever get bored of this record and have probably listened to it more than some albums I think are actually better. Every song on this is great and they’re all so different that you hear something new on each listen.

**CzrLandWhale** (8.750): It's wrong, but Haim can do no wrong.

**skargardin** (8.688): It's a tiny bit front-loaded but then thankfully picks up near the end again. Love it as a whole project though even though there are a couple tracks I don't care for as strongly.

**conceptualromance** (8.656): making a great case for never letting men touch music ever again!

**xcjm** (8.613): the Haim sisters invented music for the third time confirmed

**AHSWeeknd** (8.563): They should make a podcast called Women On Music

**zagreux** (8.519): I don't have much to say about this except that this album is perfect for idyllic summer afternoons

**Stryxen** (8.500): INVENTED women INVENTED music, this wasn’t even in my top 10 albums of last year but this has grown on me a large large amount and I already loved it! I wish there were a few tracks not here so my average could reflect that it’s probably my favourite overall but eh, that’s what the comments are for

**SmileAndTears** (8.438): Bop after bop after bop. One of my favourites of last year

**musical\_pyn** (8.375): this album grew on me a lot, some of the weaker tracks do blend together and as an album I think it's the weakest of the three, but it is still a really great direction for HAIM. Now I'm In It and The Steps are two of my favorite HAIM songs ever.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8.375): I love this album! Loved what P4k wrote in their end-of-year wrap-up that there *is* inherent value in making music that is nice to listen to. Obviously, that's not all there is to this album, but this is the only one in this group I'd listen to with a large group of other people.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.363): I haven't checked HAIM's music in a while other than Gasoline so this is a great listening experience. While their debut album is still my favorite album from them, this album still slaps with the lyrics and the production. You can tell that the group had grown a lot since their debut and this album showed their maturity and progress.

**hikkaru** (8.250): this was my first time listening to ham and i rly enjoyed this album will be sure to check out their other stuff!

**kirby31200** (8.250): These women sure are in music! This album is all over the place in a very good way

**jayjaysortagay** (8.188): light and fun in the middle of the two heavyweights, and that's why it's my fave whoops

**EnCaine** (8.169): I didn't really have a lot (well, anything at all) to say in the comments, but this is a pretty great record. I definitely like it a lot more now than I did on my initial listen (not that I thought it was bad) so i'm glad i did this rate!

**just\_thonking** (8.125): A quality album, what more is there to say

**iniekcja\_** (8.106): I've always had mixed feeling about this one, because the songs are definitely GOOD, but almost all of them sound like they're missing something that would really push them over the edge

**wasian-invasion** (8.031): In a screaming-heavy rate, this album has multiple screaming songs, therefore it wins. Sorry, I don't make the rules

**pat-rickstar** (8.000): This one was a grower for me, I listened to it once when it came out and didn't care for it despite liking all the singles. It has a bit of filler but overall it's a great album

**proscett** (7.969): i think this has my highest average in the rate, which is interesting. i kind of thought that honor would go to fiona, but oh well! this is my most played album of the three, so i guess it makes sense. the sisters showed a lot of diversity on this record and most of the risks they took paid off. it might not be the grandest or the most hyped, but it is probably my favorite!

**jasannn** (7.938): Although the second half (not including the bonus tracks) started to muddle with each other, I loved those guitars and the production. This album got better with every listen. Its a great studying album which I'm not sure is compliment or not.

**pheromenos** (7.937): credits for NOT losing momentum towards the end, we love a consistently good album.

**shesdoingyoga** (7.906): I listened to all three of these albums in 2020, but this is the only one that I never went back and revisited, so listening to it for this is like listening for the first time again and reminds me why I never went back to it. I enjoyed it in the moment and scored it well, but other than a few songs there was nothing that really stood out to me compared to FTBC and Punisher and if I’m going to choose something to listen to in my free time it would be one of the other two and not this.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7.750): The first half of this album is incredible, but falls off hard in the second half. Luckily they included the three singles as deluxe tracks to close on a high note.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.688): Punisher and FTBC were my two favourite albums of last year and this doesn't really stack up against them at all for me, in fact when making my top 50 albums list for last year, I didn't for a second consider putting this on there and I can quite easily say why. Don't get me wrong it's a good album, there's no doubt about it, and I can absolutely see why other people would really love it, but simply put, it's just not really my thing and outside of that, my only real criticism would be the mixing of the vocals.

**bespectacIed** (7.688): aka white girl pandemic. This album slays, it feels like a 'trying to find normalcy in the pandemic' kind of album. This is the type of in-your-face celebration of female caucasity that I don't find annoying, take notes ******

**OberionSynth** (7.688): It was suggested that I listen to this while taking a walk, but it was 2am when I listened to this so instead I sat in my room and did crossword puzzles.

**jman457** (7.475): Definitly the most consistent album on here, doesnt reach the highs of the other too, but also doesnt have the lows.

**plastichaxan** (7.331): Okay, I think from the comments you can tell this album was not my favorite when I first listened, in fact, it put me off the album for a while, re-listening for this rate brought me back, there are very good songs, even if it’s still not incredible, it’s really good, just could do without some filler.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (7.188): I'm actually really surprised at my average. One of those albums that is better as a whole than individual tracks. On the surface I'd give this album a strong 9, but amazed to see that breaking it down it's barely over a 7. The middle songs, while I didn't rate them all that great, are still really great tracks in the grand scheme of things. Everything works together in harmony for a complete listening experience. I'm glad this record eventually resonated with me. If this was done release weekend this score would be very very different.

wavingwolves: **vayyiqra** (7.063): Insert Haim meme about how they sound like Fleetwood Mac and are just LARPing as a 70s soft rock band. Okay, they kind of are - so what? Is that bad? That kind of music is good sometimes. Boomers weren't always wrong. Haim is a band that often get called boring, and I get that. The first time I heard this album, I found it pretty boring, kind of the musical equivalent of interior decor that's all shades of beige, grey and off-white. Pleasant enough, but also not interesting. Now after going back to it, that might be a victim of how long it is - 16 tracks is a lot to sink in upon a first listen even if they aren't that long. It's also not nearly as "80s revival synth indie-rock" as one would think with an album that has both Ariel Rechtshaid and Rostam Batmanglij on it, but those guys don't miss no matter what sound they do, so. Also, like all the albums in this rate, it is much better to read the lyrics and see how hashtag Relatable they are! (!!!)

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.969): listening to this album for the first time due to this rate and it has some great songs but is the worst album here

**CreepyMannequin** (6.625): Very inconsistent quality-wise but definitely my favourite of the three here

**Brendon-Urine** (6.500): this is good but really could have been trimmed. the second half goes a little bit downhill IMO

**team\_kockroach** (6.356): I’m not impressed at all. The bonus tracks are head and shoulders better than the rest of the album.

**fadedblue09** (6.344): I am honestly confused by this album. I feel like it’s trying to be poppy and alternative at the same time? Most songs here are indie soft-rock sprinkled with left-field production choices probably done to make it sound ‘experimental’, but it mostly felt pretentious and unnecessary. Furthermore, their songwriting and vocals did not stand out to me, which is why my comments mostly just nitpicked the production. I’ll admit that I’m not fond of the Urban Outfitters/ nu-Fleetwood aesthetic in general so maybe I’m not their target audience. Maybe this might grow on me in the future, but for now I’m not very impressed.

**flavasavavandal** (6.313): So hot take, I think this album is pretty mid. I think this album does not play to Haim’s strength (probably due to the presence of those two vampiric names in the production credits), I think some of the choices made in this album straight up ruin songs, Haim should never be put on the same song as reggae beat, and the vocal effects on I Know Alone and 3 AM are just ugly and unpleasant, they make me want to punch a hole in the wall. And the album overall just sounds muddy and uncolourful leaving what could be some fairly good songs about entitled dudes, and what makes these dudes attractive, overall feeling unengaging. There are a few exceptions though, and the lyrics are mostly good at falling in that plain straightforward poetry that works really well in pop-rock, and Danielle is a great presence when she isn’t being drowned out by the instrumentation, vocal effects, and production. But there just isn’t enough good here to justify the hype.

**xxipil0ts** (6.125): As much as this was a good album, the singles carried the album more than the rest of the tracks. This felt very one-note and yet, remained true to the brand that HAIM had.

**cyborglilith** (4.463): There is an extreme amount of filler.

wavingwolves: # Fetch The Bolt Cutters

---

**Overall Average**: 8.297 **// Average Controversy:** 1.634

[All user averages](https://paste.ee/p/zh99V)

---

**wavingwolves** (9.515): [How it makes me feel](https://media.tenor.com/images/e553a06f3d871955abe749fedeb5dff6/tenor.gif)

**SideBTrack8** (9.154): Even though there are so many lines that make absolutely no sense until you look them up on Genius, you can still appreciate even on first listen how well written everything is. I only became a Fiona fan a few months before the album came out, so I can't even imagine the wait long-time fans had to suffer through. I hope the wait was worth it for them.

---
**steelstepladder** (10.077): Genuinely my favorite album since TPAB

**zagreux** (10.077): I didn't know who Fiona Apple was before Pitchfork gave Fetch the Bolt Cutters a perfect score on its release. At that time, I was just getting into pop music and decided to listen to the album that critics were raving about. I hated it and put it off as one of those pretentious indie albums everyone pretends to like for cool cred. Flash forward to early 2021 - nearly a year had passed and I'd finally come to terms with my sexuality and a lot of other things when I randomly stumble across this album again. I decided to revisit it just to see if my opinions on it had changed, and, fuck. The lyricism cut deep and Fiona's experiences with bullying, depression, and constantly being undermined or one-upped by men were eerily similar to mine. It's been on repeat for me ever since and is now my second-most scrobbled album ever on lastfm. Not to be cheesy but this album literally fucking changed my life, thank you Fiona for your bravery.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.854): One of the very few albums that has completely blown me away the first time I listened to it. The range of emotions I felt during the album’s 52 minute run time was unreal. Hell, pressing play on a new Fiona Apple album in 2020 was a surreal feeling in itself. The pandemic has just started when it came out, and the album’s themes of confinement and isolation perfectly matched the issues facing the world at that time. This album, despite being a year old, has helped me and inspired me personally, and is an album I’ll always have a deep love for.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.800): Pitchfork 10.0 deserved. That’s all. Just an unbelievable record and discography. Kind of a bummer to do this rate when it’s almost guaranteed this is going the same way as indieheads, and that either “I Know The End” or “Kyoto” has it locked up.

**Leixander** (9.731): her best along with Idler Wheel and among my favorite albums ever

**ggal2020** (9.692): Getting into Fiona Apple this past year has changed my perspective on what it means to exist in the world as a woman. Her anger and strength are evident from her earliest work, but I think she makes the audience really feel it on this album, her best yet.

**ReallyCreative** (9.662): An excellent album from top to bottom. The back half has a couple moments I'm not super enthused about, but by and large, this is an exceptional addition to Fiona's formidable discography.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.615): Every prominent swiftie that gave this album their lowest average is getting RES tagged.

**plastichaxan** (9.600): I think it’s pretty clear that this is my favorite album in the rate, this is near perfect to me, the lyrics that either speak to me or make me empathize, the percussion, Fiona is on another level and I’m so happy I got to experience this album once more.

**kirby31200** (9.577): It took several listens and multiple articles but I think I finally get it and it's amazing. Fuck you Manthony Mantano you are not my friend

**bespectacIed** (9.538): Greatest written album of all time imo.

**iniekcja\_** (9.538): it's amazing how this album doesn't have a single forgettable moment, even the moments are original and unique

**xcjm** (9.408): consider my bolt cutters well and truly FETCHED!!! Fiona and I went on many, many quarantine nature walks together last year

**conceptualromance** (9.400): I haven’t really listened to this album since it came out because when I was listening to it that night I made myself really sick lmao

**kappyko** (9.385): look this is going to go very similarly to the indieheads rate. fiona will take up a good portion of the top 10 and then get shafted at like #4 or #3 with Kyoto and I Know the End in the top two spots. maybe a haim single or so above her as well

**musical\_pyn** (9.385): I would say this album objectively (lol) is a 10/10, but I don't personally quite click with everything. I think in 10 years when I revisit this album it will hit so much harder. I think my favorite part of the album is apple's vocal delivery, I can feel every emotion she wants to convey with every lyric.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.308): A whole trip. This production is on some other level of greatness.

**skargardin** (9.308): I get the acclaim. She really did that, honestly. Excellent songwriting all around and you just have to admire how she's in a complete lane of her own.

**waluigiest** (9.231): this album turned me into a huge fan of her work. I listened because of the critical acclaim, and after a few listens I was hooked. The lyrics and melodies and orchestration are all so inventive and beautiful and captivating. This album is a masterpiece

**leviswift13** (9.231): a genuinely refreshing body of work that is challenging, raw and fucking weird as hell. this isn't my favorite fiona album (it's still behind when the pawn and the idler wheel), but it is a raw and unfiltered musical vision that deserves every accolade it's received. i also love that i think this album has cemented her legacy in so many ways ~ to go from the sexist bullshit she endured during her debut to getting a 10 from pitchfork. it's a beautiful full circle moment

**fadedblue09** (9.038): Tbh, I still prefer Extraordinary Machine/Idler Wheel more, but I get why this got so much acclaim. People are gonna hype the unusual production, but the real highlight is how Fiona evolved as a songwriter (which is saying a lot considering how she is already). In her past albums, Fiona was more known for writing her own stories, but here she finally uses her own voice to speak for others whilst weaving her own experiences into them. I kinda see this album as a counterpart to other masterpieces like Lemonade/A Seat at the Table in that regard.

**Stryxen** (9.000): female liberation and empowerment makes me so feral and i’m not even a woman and honestly outside of a rate, this is a 10 - but i wanna differentiate between my most favourite and least favourite

**thedoctordances1940** (8.962): Before the album was released I was pretty excited about it, I hadn't actually heard any of Fiona's stuff before but I at least knew of it and knew to expect nothing less than her best efforts and that's exactly what we got. I remember waking up the morning it was released and seeing that pitchfork 10 and suddenly my expectations went through the roof, maybe a little bit too high even, as I was ever so slightly disappointed on my first listen, I liked it, but I didn't find it amazing. The more I listened to it though, the more I fell in love with it and while I wouldn't call it a 10/10, it ended up being my second favourite album released last year out of the hundreds I listened to, only behind one other certain album in this rate.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.923): I enjoyed this when it was released but probably wouldn’t have put it in my top ten albums of 2020. Revisiting it a few times this year, it has just gotten better and better with every listen. The songs may sound a bit strange compared to what is generally considered pop, but the strangeness works better on repeat listens when it isn’t as much of a surprise to a new listener. Fiona’s lyrics and vocal performances are probably the consistent standout elements in all of the songs.

**bulforster** (8.877): Hey queen! Girl you have done it again, constantly raising the bar for us all and doing it flawlessly. I’d say I’m surprised but I know who you are.

**Awkward\_King** (8.846): in the first lockdown one morning after i couldn't sleep, i just went out and sat in the garden for fifty minutes in the cold to listen to this. it was comforting. it was a test of my patience because i struggle to sit still listening to music and just taking it in and i dont think i could do it again but this album is really special to me. i need it right now i think.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.731): the album that finally made me get fiona’s music yass grenade

**EnCaine** (8.731): is this a 10? i don't really think so, there's a couple of lowlights. would i ever want pitchfork to change the score? nope she earned it

**flavasavavandal** (8.538): This album takes a minute to really get going into what makes Fetch The Bolt Cutters one of the best and one of the most special albums of 2020. But once it gets there, it becomes an unstable musical journey against instuitional patriarchy that critiqued the actions of men who abuse the power they are given (especially if that abuse is against women) and the women-vs-women competitions/fights they encourage. The songs are constantly threatening to break under the strain of the percussion-driven production and are only held together by Fiona’s voice and will. It was among my favourites of last year, even if it never hit the uppermost echelons of what I loved most in 2020. Excellent album!

=====

wavingwolves: **pat-rickstar** (8.446): I was scared to listen to this in case it didn't live up to the hype so put it off for ages, but it's great. I still need more time with it for it to fully sink in though, I think it will grow on me

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8.308): The album deserves the 10. It's not a "perfect album" imo (see scores below) but I don't care. It captured the moment, it felt singular, and I think it will be influential without ever being able to be copied directly.

**jman457** (8.200): such a primal sounding album, a lot of hits the target

**walkeddowntheblock** (8.192): I think I'm not smart enough to fully appreciate this album lol. There are songs that I absolutely adore, and I can see how masterfully everything on this album has been put together; but even after several listens after it first came out till now, I don't think I emotionally connect to it as a whole. I think maybe I just don't ~vibe~ with the percussive instrumentation and the sing-talking style in some songs, because I love the lyrics all around.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (8.154): It's one of the hardest albums I ever gotten into, so to speak. I don't know what it is about the instrumentals, but while impressive, they sound incredibly unpleasant to the unaccustomed ear. I'm happy I made the effort though. It's a very interesting album, for the lack of the better word. I don't know how often I'll be returning to it once the rate is over, but it made me want to go and listen to Fiona's other albums so there is that.

**TiltControls** (8.115): Though it was my least favourite album of the 3 (I mean it still got a 8+ so its still good) I can really see why its gotten such praise.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.992): As someone who is not very familiar with Fiona Apple's work, this is quite an interesting album. This is a pop album by spirit but this is definitely an experimental album in execution. I don't know how to explain it well but the pop sensibilities complement the non-pop elements of the production. Fiona Apple's vocals also elevated the songs here. It's like she is talking right to your face but it doesn't feel preachy. I can definitely see why this album won a Grammy for sure.

**OberionSynth** (7.923): I gave this album generally good scores bc I appreciate them musically and thematically, but I probably won't listen to most of them again unless I'm going through the whole album. It's a bit too experimental for me, and parts of it seem different just to be different. It's a solid album, just not for me.

**CzrLandWhale** (7.923): This album is heavy as fuck. It's sad, but not in the same way Punisher is. It's like confronting a deeper pit of emotions and insecurities and telling it to fuck right off.

**proscett** (7.808): yet another great album by fiona. what else is there to say? i do think the idler wheel is better and should have received the overwhelming praise this album got, but this still has some of her best songs on it and is probably her most adventurous work. she gets very deep with the subject matter on some songs but lets her dry humor shine often. and she's arguably the best lyricist alive - fight me! yeah anyways i like it

**jayjaysortagay** (7.692): This is such a hard album to rate because almost every song individually is brilliant but as a full project its samey and tiring. I think I like it.

**vayyiqra** (7.462): This is said to be an album that's hard to "get". It's a little weird yes, but I'm not a stranger to this genre of "weird artsy piano women who make alternative pop". I don't want to make the dreaded cliché Kate Bush comparison, but it's kind of right there since she literally quotes Kate Bush (my favourite song ever, in fact) on this album. But even more than that this reminds me of Regina Spektor's older work which was a key part of the indie-snob-to-pop pipeline for me in the 2000s, so this sound is like an old friend to me. To quote a popular meme, she is kinda quirky tho! Also, there's some undertones from jazz on this, and I love jazz so much I named my cat Miles Davis (RIP he died last year). Many thinkpieces could be and surely have been written about the themes on this album. I could write one right now if I had time but I don't, so I'll just say that reading the lyrics helps "get" this album a lot. Also (might be hot spicy take!) I understand why bald music review man didn't totally love this album either. I hope he's changed his mind a bit on that though since then. I know I have.

**team\_kockroach** (7.462): Reminds me of Kids See Ghosts. The instrumentals are rock-inspired and are downright weird, the choruses are so quirky, and the verses meander from topic to topic. Must be why I love it so much

**xxipil0ts** (7.462): Encapsulated the bizarre production of Fiona Apple and represented the very angst she feels in every song. The album did not feel very one-note and each song is different from each other.

**nick1372** (7.462): Listening to this album, you can clearly tell that it is an incredibly well-crafted album. It’s deeply emotional yet extremely polished and artistic. Not everything here is for me, but I struggled to give anything below an 8; even if I don’t listen to these songs on a daily basis their quality is undeniable

**hikkaru** (7.423): This is a good album and I get why it received so much acclaim. I feel like I have a completely smooth brain doing this rate though because while I recognize that it's good there's really no context I would see myself listening to this unlike the other two albums just bc it's like, so heavy lyrically and sonically. I hope my scores aren't dragged too much for being middling (i guess they're not actually middling but like idk I feel wrong not being like OMG YAS THIS ALBUM IS THE BEST THING EVER) and now i'm having a crisis about music taste/preferences and just not being as receptive to stuff like this that has so much acclaim. anyways

**Brendon-Urine** (7.308): I went through trying to make myself like this more than I do, which is sad, but I came out liking it anyways. I don't really think it's all that hard to listen to, but it's much more interesting in concept than it is enjoyable to listen to. Love the first run of songs but it falls off a little bit.

**wasian-invasion** (7.308): I don't know if I'll ever get into her older stuff, but this was a thoroughly enjoyable album.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.292): There's just something about it that doesn't appeal to me. I just think this is really overrated. I might be just talking shit, though. I know nothing about music. For me to like a song or album, I just have one request: it has to make me feel something good, sad, happy, confused or any other way that makes me go back to it lol. I like the way most of the tracks sound, but I'm not a fan of Fiona's voice. Her songwriting is brilliant though. She is great at it. I've been meaning to go back and listen to some of her older stuff to appreciate her talent, which is undeniable. I had never heard of her before the hype this album got.

**welcometoNY** (7.154): This album was my first introduction to Fiona, and one of my favorites of 2020. While it was not quite as life-changing, genre-defying, and overall akin to perfect as the reviews insisted, I'm glad I had it to get me through a hard year. I appreciated how accessible it was, something I was told it explicity would not be, but...it's a pop album. It's catchy - which I loved, but definitely didn't expect. There are some weaker moments, and the production overall is very same-y, but the lyrical prowess exhibited here cannot be overstated.

**AquariusTeaSpilled** (6.977): it’s a little overrated in my opinion

**jasannn** (6.731): I listened to the album a bunch of times but I never understood it. It's not bad; its just not for me.

**just\_thonking** (6.654): Fantano kind of had a point

**CreepyMannequin** (6.615): Not for me but I appreciate that this exists

**SmileAndTears** (5.808): I promise I didn't try to tank Fiona's scores I just really don't like this album. It's just sound to me

**cyborglilith** (5.769): her creativity is astounding but some of the songs just sound annoying

**shhhneak** (5.692): This is like the 3rd time I’ve tried to get through this album for a rate and fortunately I’ve struggled through it. It’s honestly grown on me A LOT but still doesn’t hold a candle to old school Fiona music. It’s the antithesis of my preferred production style.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (3.538): This just isn't fun to listen to. It wasn't the first time and it wasn't now. I'm not knocking anyone who actually enjoy this, because lord knows I have some stuff 99% of you wouldn't touch with a twenty seven and a half foot pole, but it's not for me. Every single song my only emotion is "Is this over yet?" I think Fiona has a great voice and I do really enjoy some of her other music but FTBC is just not an album for me, and that's okay.

wavingwolves: # Punisher

---

**Overall Average**: 8.324 **// Average Controversy:** 1.577 

[All user averages](https://paste.ee/p/ad1e8)

---

**SideBTrack8** (9.136): I had tried a few times to get into Phoebe's first time, but it never seemed to click. But straight away I knew Punisher was something special. It's one of those albums that, even though I've listened to it over 50 times at this point, it still feels so fresh. It's not the kind of album I can loop endlessly, but I still return to it often. Now I consider Phoebe one of my favourite artists, and love her first album almost as much as Punisher.

**wavingwolves** (9.027): [How it makes me feel](https://media.tenor.com/images/62891d0e4fde1c1a1d3c2cdd92f4e809/tenor.gif)

---
**IIIHenryIII** (9.727): This would be my favorite album of last year had Taylor not released "folkmore". I used to like Stranger in the Alps better, but now I think this is my favorite Phoebe's album. All tracks are so beautifully haunting. It's a really sad album that has the amazing capacity of making me feel so happy. Nothing about it puts me in a sad mood. Even the saddest songs here are not capable of doing this, they straight up bring a smile to my face. I used to have only one Halloween album, Dead Man's Bones, but now I have two!!! They both are perfect for the best holiday ever. And we don't even celebrate this holiday in my country, I mean, not in the American way lol

**bespectacIed** (9.455): Not the most original sounding album of all time, she wears her references on her sleeves far too much. But the songwriting is what made me fall in love. Phoebe just gets it, phoebe just gets me. One of my most listened to albums of 2020, a beauty of an album

**xcjm** (9.364): punisher? I 'ardly know her!

**walkeddowntheblock** (9.318): Definitely my favorite album of 2020, if not of all time (and I say that as a hardcore Swiftie of years)! I think a lot about why I connected so much with it- one thing, of course, being the serendipitous timing of it being released during quarantine while I was depressed. People talk a lot about Phoebe Bridgers being music for depressed girls, but honestly I think Punisher is more comforting than anything. It's such a serene nighttime album with fragmented lyrics that distort reality and time, blurring the line between what is real life and what is a dreamscape and beckons to question; it creates its own, little yearning world world in this ambiguous space that feels so much more separate and beautiful than real life and its responsibilities.

**xxipil0ts** (9.273): This album brought something new to the table with its themes, melodies, and productions that felt somber yet comforting. It was truly an album that was so perfectly released amidst the pandemic.

**AquariusTeaSpilled** (9.236): Probably the saddest album I have ever listened to

**AHSWeeknd** (9.182): an A24 production.

**OberionSynth** (9.182): Why did nobody tell me about Phoebe Bridgers before?? I blame everyone but me for this. This album took me on a journey I was not prepared to go on while sitting in my room eating cheese blasted goldfish

**leviswift13** (9.182): phoebe is one the greatest artists currently working. she has crafted a true universe across this album ... it feels dark, sinister, emotional, sad, apocalyptic, funny, bitter, hopeful. her lyrical perspective is so unique. the way her sadness is so intertwined with her biting sense of humor feels so personal. punisher forever.

**TiltControls** (9.182): My favourite album of 2020 and honestly one of my favourites of all time now. There's so much good about it and it doesn't stumble anywhere. I'd feel bad for overrating it if I didn't also love the other albums in the rate

**shesdoingyoga** (9.136): This was definitely the album out of these three that I’ve gone back to the most since its release. Every song stands out to me for one reason or another, whether that be the lyrics, her vocals, the overall sound of the song, or some combination of those and other factors. If I had to pick one album from this rate to recommend to someone else it would definitely be this one.

**pheromenos** (9.055): i already knew i would favor this album from the get-go. and it deserves. there are some meh tracks here and there, but as an album it is hauntingly beautiful, and i can tell it will only age better with time.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.000): As I first listened to the album, I wasn't actually that impressed, but luckily Kyoto piqued my interest enough for me to revisit the album a bit more and thank god I did. Due to a lot of the songs being as quiet and soothing as they are, it takes a couple of listens to appreciate them but once you're there, you notice it's the best album of 2020.

**iniekcja\_** (9.000): this album has multiple tracks that could've been my 11 if it wasn't for Fiona, the melodies are powerful and memorable, the lyrics are touching, chef's kiss

**Stryxen** (9.000): my life changed when my bisexual friend told me to listen to boygenius and garden song released like two days later omg the collapse,,, anyway this was my #1 album of 2020 but I’m definitely starting to see the cracks after over listening and the circlejerk over it is getting a tiny bit como se dice irritating - however the memories i have (and the fact that it’s banger after banger) mean it’s still gonna be one of my highest averages in a rate ever

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9.000): This album is incredible. Her writing is incredible. She sounds incredible. I don't have much to say about it.

**conceptualromance** (8.855): unprecedentedly impeccable timing on PB’s part that this was released when it was

**steelstepladder** (8.855): I'm so glad this album finally clicked with me before I did the rate or else y'all would have had some words for me

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.818): my fave album of last year!!

**nick1372** (8.818): This was my favorite album of 2020 and upon relisten it’s obvious why. Phoebe’s incredible songwriting plus her hushed delivery makes it sound like she’s whispering these incredibly specific, personal stories in your ear, and it just makes you so fucking sad.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.800): https://i.redd.it/qn4lltq9g4m61.jpg

**EnCaine** (8.791): the fact that my second highest rated song is DVD Menu- i'm keeping it. i'm convinced i am correct.

**Brendon-Urine** (8.727): It really is that good.

**survivorjdmarina** (8.682): It’s cool. That’s all.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.627): I have always wanted to check out Phoebe Bridgers but I didn't have a lot of expectations coming. But wow, I cannot believe I actually relate to many of the songs in this album. I projected many of my feelings through these songs. And wow, Phoebe has a way with her words and lyrics. Fucking beautiful. I'll definitely grow to love this album with more listens.

**hikkaru** (8.591): i barely know her!

**kirby31200** (8.591): I wouldn't normally seek this album out so I'm glad I heard it here. It's a bit of a grower. Her songwriting is so unique, she's able to take these very seemingly mundane lyrics and show such specific yet relatable feelings

**musical\_pyn** (8.545): a really great album, some of the tracks do blend into each other (looking at you, Punisher/Halloween/ICU) but the ones that stand out are some of the best songs that came out of 2020

**team\_kockroach** (8.545): My personal favorite album of 2020, though What’s Your Pleasure? came close. I’ve seen criticisms that she wears her influences (Elliott Smith, Sufjan Stevens, Josh Tillman, etc.) too close to her sleeve...but I like her way more than Sufjan, Josh or Elliott.

**just\_thonking** (8.527): sonically cohesive, emotionally poignant

**waluigiest** (8.455): This album is gorgeous, but I struggle to get into it the same way I get into Fetch the Bolt Cutters. I admire it and appreciate it but I have only listened to it a few times.

**useless-sheep** (8.364): Boring in the best possible way

**SmileAndTears** (8.364): I overplayed this album a lot cuz I used to listen to it in the morning when I was trying to drown out the noise my parents made in the hosue but i still love it

**skargardin** (8.364): This simply gets more stunning with every listen.

**jasannn** (8.327): Tbh, I don't understand what most of her lyrics mean but they all sound beautiful and this is one of my favorite album covers ever.

**bulforster** (8.309): This sadgirl indie album was my comfort album of last year after the pandemic killed my love life and I had to move back in with my parents. It helped me feel lonely, which it turns out was exactly what I wanted after kind of losing my own space.

**CzrLandWhale** (8.273): The kind of albums you listen to while lying on the floor with the ceiling fan on.

**shhhneak** (8.145): Still great, but I’ve replayed it so aggressively that it’s lost its luster a bit.

**Awkward\_King** (8.136): i hate men.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (8.136): This is just a great fucking album. I don't have anything else to say about it, it's just a great fucking album and I'm glad it exists.

**pat-rickstar** (8.091): I heard IKTE for the first time in December last year and got hooked immediately, this album doesn't completely match that level but it still made me into a Pharb

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.000): I did a full 360 on this album over the course of the year. I disliked it on release, loved it around New Year's and became obsessed with Chinese Satellite and IKTE, but now I'm kind of tired of it for the most part. Stream Home Video by Lucy Dacus out June 25th.

**wasian-invasion** (7.909): This took a few listens to work for me, but now I see why Elton John was so ready to throw hands on its behalf. Definitely biased towards the more upbeat songs, but I appreciate the slower cuts

wavingwolves: **ReallyCreative** (7.873): well girl, I like your sound for the most part. But unfortunately, this album gets lost in itself at some points. I really am not a huge fan of some of the more ambient tracks on the album, and I think lyrically Phoebe still has some work left to do. More things like Kyoto/I Know The End, less things like the title track.

**flavasavavandal** (7.500): This should be the easiest of sells for me. Out of all the albums in this rate this should be the easiest. I love me indie country sung by women, it should stand to reason that I love indie folk sung by women. But man Phoebe Bridgers voice just doesn’t have enough texture to engage me, and a significant amount of these songs just into pretty but forgettable, but I wouldn’t say there is a single bad song here

**zagreux** (7.391): I overplayed punisher last year so I can't listen to it anymore without being reminded of the shitshow 2020 was :(  I feel like I gave it a lower average in comparison to the other albums becuase I can relate to like only three songs here. This is still a great record though, I hope society is able to give the other boygeniuses the phoebe treatment.

**jman457** (7.291): I honestly dont really get the hype about her. The songs are good on their own but front to back this album is a bit of a slog


**frogaranaman** (7.273): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/823334183053033494/832086659486973972/Ey3YRWbWQAEGCO_.png

**vayyiqra** (7.182): Maybe the album I wanted to most revisit here because of its acclaim, I have to admit when this album came out I found it to be more or less just campfire music, and didn't get the hype over it. I still don't quite get it, and haven't gotten Phoebe-pilled to the point I'm going to give every song on here a 10 and listen to this album on repeat 1000 times and memorize every word, and to be blunt I don't think I will ever get to that point - but now I can agree that while much of it is soft acoustic nighttime campfire music, it's also *good*, pretty, moving and well-written.

**fadedblue09** (7.182): Honestly I love this album and it was one of my favorite releases last year, but I really don’t think it’s the masterpiece everyone claims it to be. Phoebe’s songwriting is hit-or-miss: she has a distinctive POV, but she gets caught up too much in details, which causes her to be on-the-nose and sometimes even childish. She definitely has room to improve as a songwriter, and this album lacked the maturity of recent indie breakthroughs (Titanic Rising, Be the Cowboy). I have a feeling this album will slowly grow off me (I think it’s starting to do now) and I doubt I will be carrying this album far into the future.

**plastichaxan** (7.091): I wish I could like this way more, even if my average for this is decent, I wish I could click more with her music

**welcometoNY** (7.009): Of the albums in this rate, this one took the longest to open up to me, but once it did I saw how special it was. I still don't care for some of the songs, but there are enough moments of brilliance to make up for it.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7.000): I do really like the whole Phoebe Bridgers thing, for all the parodying and memes, this album does hold up for me

**cyborglilith** (6.791): im dead inside. this makes me feel emotions.

**proscett** (6.273): i really didn't like this album when i first heard it, which was disappointing considering i was pretty into stranger in the alps when it dropped. after repeated listening i bumped up my scores a bit, but this is still easily my least favorite album of the three in this rate. i wish phoebe brought some more drama instrumentally to complement her tight lyrics, but a lot of the songs here are very slow and plodding. plus her melodies usually aren't very distinctive... i really wish i liked this more than i do!

**CreepyMannequin** (5.773): hmm I wasn’t into this

**jayjaysortagay** (5.727): This is an unbelievably disappointing album to me. I guess I just don't get it.

TiltControls: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!!!!

Thank you Belb and sideB for hosting today! Some amazing picks for intermissions/pre-show and great shitposts!

As always updated [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/u/1/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=28287180) here!

##Songs

**I Know the End** secures the win for Phoebe and lands in the top 10 for highest scoring songs of all time at #10 exactly!!!! It also ties the record set by Blinding Lights earlier in the year for most 11's at 45! (is 45 the new 36? discuss). It does just barely miss the leaderboard for 11 magnets though, getting 28.3% of the rate's 11s (minimum for the top 10 is 29.6%)

(**Kyoto** also does very well, landing at #42 highest score for all songs!)

##Artists

Though **HAIM** had a bit of an early exit, they still did really well! Their average gained quite a boost from the rate, though still no leaderboard in sight. Still they did much better than people were expecting. WIMPII pushes them from #82 to #51 on the artist leaderboards. WIMPIII also does land a spot on the albums chart at least! It sits at #40 across all rates

**Fiona** was already in the top 20 for artists at #8 and a strong showing with her FTBC scores moves to... #9. Only because Pheobe came in and knocked her down. Well it's still a high spot to have on the board at least. Unforunately for Fiona, she loses her "no 0" title with this rate, but a great #18 place on the albums chart can maybe give some happiness for FTBC fans (which means it WILL be on the wiki leaderboard for albums)

**Phoebe** is the one newcomer of the rate and she starts off her rating career very strong, getting a win and placing at #8 for artist averages (and taking Fiona's spot)! Punisher also ends up at a high spot on the albums chart landing at #16 (and just ahead of FTBC)

##Top 100 Album Chart

Niki (u/ElizabethDDoS) isn't available to comment the updated album chart today, but they passed along the chart outline so it's still here! Huge thanks to them for this!

**[Top 100 rated albums](https://i.imgur.com/0NphzgK.jpg)**

##Rates

This rate takes the 5th highest average, 9th lowest controversy and 5th most participants across all rates! Great work to the hosts for getting so many people to do the rate!

##Leaderboards Update!

There's a lot of songs we've rated, so why not bump up the criteria to show the best (and worst) of them? Below are some of the charts on the rate leaderboard wiki page that have been bumped up to fit more rate stats!

Songs

- Highest Scores (20 -> 25)
- Lowest Scores (10 -> 25)
- Most 11's (10 -> 25)
- Most 0's (10 -> 25)
- Most Controversial (20 -> 25)
- Least Controversial (10 -> 25)

Artists

- Highest Average (20 -> 25)
- Most songs rated (20 -> 25)

Albums

- Highest scores (20 -> 25)
- Lowest scores (10 -> 25)

Not enough rates yet to bump up those numbers (a 25/25 split would cover almost half of all rates anyways!)


##Upcoming

This rate is done, but there's still two more days to send in a ballot for the [Sub Faves Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/mjy37h/2020_ultimate_sub_faves_rate/)! (Carly/Charli/Chloe X Halle/Rina)

Also next month's rates are both accepting ballots: [2020 Breakup Pop Rock](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/n3ikze/2020_breakup_poprock_rate_halsey_miley_cyrus/) (Halsey/Hayley/Miley) and [Video Game Vocals](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/n3ilq2/video_game_vocal_rate/)!
