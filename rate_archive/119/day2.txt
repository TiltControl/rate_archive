# Hello, vegans! 

Welcome to the second day of the 2020 Ultimate Pitchfork Acclaim Rate! How are we feeling? A little down from the ham's massacre we saw yesterday? I'm sure today I'll give you more reasons to get mad at strangers on the Internet, but this is what we call fun.   

Today we'll be revealing songs placing at **#26-#14** in the main rate and **#11-#6** in the bonus rate.

**We'll be starting at 3pm EST**, so an hour from now. Be here OR ELSE!!!!

**wavingwolves** (10): This starts favourite stretch of the album: Newspaper to For Her. Any of these songs could be 11s of mine, they all hit me in very personal ways and I'm pretty sure I have cried to all of them at least once. Newspaper, in specific, is such an interesting song both sonically and in thematic. I love her vocal delivery in this so much, and I especially love the background harmonies, done by her sister, and I love the perspective this illustrates, the complex relationship between women who feel like they have someone between them. I can never tell if I'm projecting my own experiences into songs too much, but when it comes to bad relationships I've lived I always feel kinship towards the people who happen to date the people I have dated and this songs showcases that experience so well.

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): The vocal delivery on this song is so raw. I haven't personally experienced anything she's singing about but she still makes it feel so relatable.

---
# Read the news 

**kirby31200** (11): I love how she admitted in an interview that she has no idea why the song's called newspaper

**1998tweety** (10): ok now THIS is good. her voice and tone actually helps the song a lot here

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Come through other-woman bop

**akanewasright** (10): This is just arresting.

**bbfan132** (10): the loud percussion alongside these lyrics… perfect

**bespectacIed** (10): I think it isn't stated enough how wonderfully feministic FTBC is. So many songs about solidarity.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): GET HIS ASS.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The dogs are back!

**iniekcja\_** (10): it's so powerful

**kappyko** (10): various dancing gifs

**llieno94** (10): personally this is my 11/10 of the album, but I’m strategically giving my 11 to the title track, cause I know this will most likely be in the bottom 5/10 of the rank no matter what, and understandably so. It’s one of Fiona’s most alienating and least accessible song (along with songs like Jonathan and Daredevil) because of its intensity and lack of pleasing melody and chords, but for me this is where Fiona shines brightest and where her work transcends the medium of song and music.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): definitely an 11 contender...this song is such a grower omg i used to not like it at all

**OberionSynth** (10): this song brings me back to the time my best friend's ex tried to turn her against me. and the other time that exact same situation happened with a different friend. and the third time.

**plastichaxan** (10): i connect to this song a lot, no i won't elaborate

**Quiet-Tone13** (10): I find this song so insightful. The relationship women have to other women who have been abused or tormented by the same man is so complex and difficult. I love that Fiona gave us a song about it.

**QustoMar** (10): is this hyperpop?

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way this song could theoretically be about Maya Rudolph...

**runaway3212** (10): I love how she's inspired by katy, legend inspiring legends

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is stunningly dark and almost gothic, the opening beat reminds me of a Nine Inch Nails track. It’s perfect as a cathartic prelude to Ladies. Fiona goes all the way IN on misogynist abuse as a tool to divide and conquer women, and chooses passionate empathy over continuing to compete over the approval of the men who make us suffer.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Oh this is the one I had been sleeping on

**steelstepladder** (10): Another song that puts feelings into words that I've never seen tackled so well.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Okay now THIS track was a very interesting first listen. It feels spacey yet claustrophobic, and Fiona’s shrieks here give the track a lot of conviction.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): Is it true that Fiona and one of Haim sister's boyfriend had an affair and this song is about this? If it's true than F U Fiona! The song bops though!

**xcjm** (10): we were cursed the moment that he kissed us? I felt that one so deep in my bones

**bookthieving** (9.5): the background vocals + percussion on this are gorgeous

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): "you're wearing time, like a flowery crown" is a gorgeous lyric

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the pots and pans of it all

**frogaranaman** (9): whack (positive connotation)

**leviswift13** (9): something about this melody feels so ... intoxicating and dangerous and sinister. perfectly bleeds into ladies

**outsideeyess** (9): lyrically one of her best

**skargardin** (9): this absolutely hits

**static\_int\_husp** (9): By the end when she's just belting... ugh it's so good

**Stryxen** (9): Miss Ogyny will be to blame for this not coming day 3

**waluigiest** (9): the way she writes about her relationships with other women who have been with the same men is fascinating

**cremeebrulee** (8): this isn’t my favorite bc i think ladies does the subject matter a bit better but it is written so well (“we were cursed the moment that he kissed us” is just a gorgeous lyric— tbh the whole chorus is)

**vayyiqra** (8): She just said she wasn't good at drums but listen to this!!! It bangs!!! I play drums I know

**Uberpigeon** (7.7): As is the case for a lot of FTBC songs, this is really unique premise and perspective for a song, but it isn't one of my favourites.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): I was going to write a proper comment but "Bowser's Castle type beat" feels more appropriate

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): not my favorite melodically or sonically, but the lyrics are so cutting, especially "I wonder what lies he's told you about me / To make sure that we'll never be friends"

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): the production is too “percussion CD i had to review in band class (again)” which is distracting me from everything else about the song.

**jman457** (7.1): the songs stays its welcome a little bu the song feels like a mid 2000’s r&b hit in a good way

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7): Call me basic, but I do like it when the album has just a bit more melody.

**bigbigbee** (7): This one feels a little long to me but I love the harmonies and I LOVE the song’s theme. It’s a perspective I feel I don’t hear much.

# Read the Daily Discussions thread

**bulforster** (7): I like the vocals but I feel like the instrumental is a bit cluttered so there's nothing in it to grab onto.

**jayjaysortagay** (7): Fiona often writes interestingly about things that are not interesting at their core, that is an interesting contradiction to me and I don't know whether it is good or bad

**team\_kockroach** (7): Leonard Cohen vibes

**Vromega** (7): not a fan of the beginning of the song. But the chorus is a vibe. Lovely background vocals too

**wasian-invasion** (7): Just send this poor woman a dm

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Only song that hasn't grown on me. I appreciate Fiona for trying to take a feminist approach to this overdone cheating/love triangle story, but her vocals just feel so unemotional and phoned-in, it’s like the song was not from her experiences or something. I’m glad it has its fans though

**shhhneak** (6.5): Probably my favourite song in terms of lyrics on FTBC.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Like I said before, lyrically this is amazing. She is undeniably a great lyricist, but I don't know how I feel about this track either. Maybe it's her voice or the melodies of some of these tracks. I don't know… I still like it, though.

**ManofOranges** (6): Can I get a witness?

**NotWith10000Men** (6): it's nice I guess. She does some cool vocal things in the chorus and the flowery crown part

**proscett** (5.5): the internet outsold

**endcreditouilles** (4): By this point in the album I'm getting pretty fatigued by these type of disjunct vocals and industrial/percussive production, especially if it's as front and center as it is here. I'm not fond of the flow or composition with this track either.

=====

I_googled_for_this: u/ThObsceneBirdOfNight i think you’re talking about PTA. Fiona & PTA was in relationship around 2000. PTA has been with Maya for over a decade & has children with her.  Haim’s dad is PTA’s teacher so he’s been close with Haim & directed many of  their music videos. One of Haim sisters currently acting in his next film. but none of Haim sisters are in relationship with PTA.

we’re not sure whether ‘Newspaper’ is about PTA or any of her exes.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): I'm not that surprised this didn't make it terribly far, it's a very slow and moody song, but for me it's one of the most beautiful on the album.

**wavingwolves** (9.2): A non love song about love. At least, some kind of it. I feel like this one of the songs that most benefits of the anecdotal style she takes on songwriting. It tells such specific experiences she has had and it still feels so papable and real that it's almost like hearing a story from a friend where you can see yourself in it and making the same type of choices because you have once. Still, I think I don't have enough words to even describe this song and its themes, but as Phoebe herself says, this song is about how "caring about someone who hates themselves is really hard, because they feel like you’re stupid. And you feel stupid. Like, if you complain, then they’ll go away. So you don’t complain and you just bottle it up and you’re like, “No, step on me again, please.”"

---
# Know their birth chart

**leviswift13** (11): it's hard for me to talk about this song because of the immense love i have for it. first of all, the craft here is unparalleled. the way this is structured, the imagery of the lyrics, her biting performance, the swell of the production. it is desperate, romantic, tragic, haunted, grieving. the centerpiece of the album and maybe her career. "you're sick and you're married and you might be dying, but you're holding me like water in your hands" hits.

**Tedyonce** (11): ur sick and ur married and u might be my 11

**walkeddowntheblock** (11): Moon Song wasn't initially one of my favorites from my first few listens of the album, but then it suddenly hit. Describes being so deep and desperate in your feelings for someone that you are willing to give all of yourself to, but who isn't at the time emotionally able to give it back.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): The dog motif is the best thing she ever came up with

**AHSWeeknd** (10): depression

**bespectacIed** (10): This is so good i still don't get the hate. "You couldn't have stuck your tongue down the thrOAT of somebody who loves you more" -- i cant be the only who GAGGED at her delivery. powerful shit

**bulforster** (10): The most traumatic nightmare I can remember involved watching my best friend die. This is just those emotions in song form and yet I love it.

**CarlieScion** (10): I too would give u the moon if I could 🥺

**fadedblue09** (10): This will be robbed but it's one of my personal favorites. I love the low-key yet intimate atmosphere here, and features some of Phoebe’s most emotive performances.

**hunnybee12** (10): but if i could give you the moon, i would give you the mooooooon 🤕

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): me when i write a song about the moon

**nick1372** (10): the specificity in this just makes my heart break every time

**notoriouspge** (10): "stuck your tongue down the throat of somebody who loves you more" I'm emo

**runaway3212** (10): one thing i love about punisher is how the songs itself can climb to incredible highs while still being small and this one fits there perfectly

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I didn’t connect the two mentions of the bird but when I did wow this one hits different

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (10): YOU ARE SICK AND YOU'RE MARRIED AND YOU MIGHT BE DYING, BUT YOU'RE HOLDNG ME LIKE WATER IN YOUR HANDS. WHEN YOU SAW THE DEAD LITTLE BIRD YOU STARTED CRYING, BUT YOU KNOW THE KILLER DOESN'T UNDERSTAND

**TiltControls** (10): which moon? i'm imagining it's about the LoZ crash-into-the-earth moon

**Turpamutteri** (10): My crying soundtrack

**waluigiest** (10): the writing is untouchable

**welcometoNY** (10): this is the one

**shhhneak** (9.7): I love love love the ambient sounds in this production.

**seanderlust** (9.5): "you know the killer doesn't understand" does wendy williams have a writing credit on this?

**akanewasright** (9): The one song on the album I consider genuinely emotionally difficult to listen to.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I am projecting so many personal things into this song over a damn crush but goddamn the lyrics are so spot-on.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Lyrically is the most beautiful song off of the album, but it's also my least favorite song. That doesn't mean that I don't like it, I love it actually. There's not a single bad song by Phoebe. In that way, she's just like Taylor.

**kirby31200** (9): And you take the moon and you take the moon

**OberionSynth** (9): not entirely sure what this song is ab but i'm obsessed

**survivorjdmarina** (9): One of my favourites on the album.

**totallynot14\_** (9): i never know wtf she's singing about but it sounds especially profound and smart here

**xcjm** (9): I'm lying on the moon rn

**conceptualromance** (8.5): I feel like I don’t like this one as much as everyone else

**Stryxen** (8.5): wait no cos,,, the way that if i could give someone the moon, i would literally give them the moon

**EnCaine** (8.2): this song has maybe the strangest relatable moment in music history for me. I do not like tears in heaven by eric clapton (and don't like eric clapton in general - both musically and as a person) but that song is about such a terrible terrible tragedy that i've always felt so awful for not enjoying it. hearing that sentiment expressed in a song made me feel very seen

**bbfan132** (8): “we hate tears in heaven/but it’s sad that his baby died”

**bigbigbee** (8): This song is so similar to Savior Complex, but somehow I like the latter way more. The final minute really saves this for me: the line “But you’re holding me like water in your hands” is so evocative and gorgeous.

**forgetquick** (8): More great lyrics from Phoebe, but I do think melodically it drags a bit.

**frogaranaman** (8): I love getting dick under the moonlight

**wasian-invasion** (8): lol that Eric Clapton line is so hilarious for some reason

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): heartbreaking

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's pretty when it finally gets where it needs to go

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): hating on clapton is always the right thing to do

# Flat earth believers

**CrimsonROSET** (7): you’re SICK and you’re MARRIED give me 200$

**endcreditouilles** (7): I like the lyrics on this one, but the songwriting and production feels like a hundred other songs I've heard before. The build towards the end is nice though.

**jasannn** (7): All I can think about is Gru from Despicable Me.

**llieno94** (7): maybe the most uninspired melody on the album, but some of the strongest lyrics. Idk her creative process, but many of her songs read like poems without a real structure.

**steelstepladder** (7): Good but kinda gets drowned out by the rest of the album

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): not my favorite but gets a bonus point for dragging Eric Clapton

**jman457** (6.9): Its def a grower

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is probably one of the least interesting songs musically on the album, so I didn't go very high. But I also just find it enchanting to listen to for some reason. I love the story painted by the lyrics.

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): John Lennon slander is not enough to sell me a song.

**vayyiqra** (6): In fact, I like Tears in Heaven. Not Clapton though, he's kind of a douche.

**1998tweety** (5.5): a whole lot of nothing

**proscett** (5.5): i do like the lyrics, but the rest does not interest me

**team\_kockroach** (5.5): It’s...fine. I’ve always thought this song interrupts the flow of the album, even though the lyrics are amazing as ever.

**jayjaysortagay** (5): Moon Song by Karen O outsold

**ManofOranges** (5): I would cry too if I for some reason I had to talk about John Lennon.

**Awkward\_King** (4): oh wow i love everyone more than they love me and as soon as someone actually loves me back as much as i love them i get scared and throw them away

**NotWith10000Men** (4): yawn

**cyborglilith** (1.1): shit

**brenda\_official** (0): freaking yawn

**SideBTrack8** (10): Popheads, I will never forgive you for this. This is one of the best songs in the rate, going out in the middle of day 2 is a travesty. If we never get a second Boygenius project I'm blaming all of you.

**wavingwolves** (10): This one is for the sapphics and the sapphics only! This is a song about her relationship with Julien Baker, one of the members of critically acclaimed supergroup [boygenius](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hZlR6DjehDc), who has struggled a lot with addiction and mental health issues that she has shared in both her work and interviews. This shocases how devastating it is to see someone you love make the worst possible decisions for themselves and suffering in your own way through it while being incapable of doing anything besides believing in them and their potential. This is one of my favourite songs on the album because it is, essentially, a boygenius song. Lucy Dacus voice steals the show even when she's just doing background vocals and it's my favourite thing to hear her sing in anything. The tenderness of all of their voices layered together in the final chorus + outro make my heart melt.

# Boygenius fanclub

**King\_Tyson** (11): I feel as if this is Phoebe's best song. It's slow and beautiful. I adore her soothing voice on the track.

**UrbanisminEgypt** (11): I may be biased towards this album in general because I was listening to it a few months after beginning finasteride before I realized that it was making me severely depressed (Just let yourself bald everyone, its not worth it). But listening to end of this song, starting from "so we spent what was left of our serotonin", was one of the most beautiful musical experiences I've ever had.

**bespectacIed** (10): My absolute fave track on the album!!!!!! Boygenius can do no wrong. The audience needs a boygenius album

**conceptualromance** (10): fuck yeah...whatever she wants

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): :akanewassapphic:

**IIIHenryIII** (10): A country ballad? What else can we ask for? The harmonies are so spot on! Another exaggeratedly beautiful song.

**leviswift13** (10): stunning is the only word i have. the calm before the storm that is i know the end. feels genuinely romantic and hopeful.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): i’m not saying this is about julien baker but it’s not not about julien baker

**mudkip1** (10): we LOVE lucy dacus we LOVE julien baker

**pat-rickstar** (10): So gorgeous, I hope this doesn’t get robbed

**runaway3212** (10): the rhyming here is exquisite

**Stryxen** (10): i have attachment issues

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): Phoebe, please break up with Conor and date Julien Baker (or me) <3

**xcjm** (10): THE GIRLIES ARE BACK! Also yeah I think we'd all do anything for Julien Baker too, Phoebe

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): if I had good songwriting skills like Phoebe I too would write a song about Julien Baker.

**avg-vag** (9.5): i'd do anything for julien baker too

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): WOMEN

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): such a sweet, gut-wrenching song

**steelstepladder** (9.4): If Graceland is so good why isn't there a Graceland T- Oh wait there is

**akanewasright** (9): If this is what boygenius songs sound like, I need to listen to boygenius

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this one goes out to the violin

**endcreditouilles** (9): I really like the Graceland-inspired elements in the instrumentation, it feels very well thought out.

**OberionSynth** (9): song gives me "fresh out the mental hospital" vibes, and honestly same girl

**ReallyCreative** (9): lo-fi yeehaw beats to study to

**savemeaseat143** (9): I would grade higher but I don't like the serotonin line

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This was my favorite song on Punisher the first time I listened. Pretty depressing and personal, but also beautiful sonically and lyrically

**Uberpigeon** (9): I don't know how else to describe it but this song feels like a breeze through a meadow on a summers day

**Vromega** (9): very pretty mix of atmospheres

**bbfan132** (8.5): very comfy!!

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Sonically different from the rest but that is not at all a bad thing

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): absolutely gorgeous

**celladonn** (8): We love a boygenius reunion

**cremeebrulee** (8): omg when the rest of the boygenius girls come in …. nut

**iniekcja\_** (8): it's cute

**llieno94** (8): one of the most straightforward narratives on the album, about a girl who gets out of some rehab while the narrator realizes their loved one’s mental health is out of their hands and they have to come to peace with it.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): this is a damn good country song

**skargardin** (8): julien and lucy sound so good here

**slimboyfriend** (8): gal pal anthem

**totallynot14\_** (8): I know the song is about very serious topics and it's well written but the monotone is putting me to sleep especially after a half an hour straight of pheobe bridgers

**1998tweety** (7.5): the instruments are nice ill give ha that

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Love the country-ish influences in the instrumentals but this honestly felt like filler to me. Not helped by how it got repetitive in the end.

**Turpamutteri** (7.5): this sounds like being in a magical cabin deep in the forest

**proscett** (7): the banjo's cool, and it's good to hear lucy and julien on background vox!

# People who hate to see sapphics win, idk 

**wasian-invasion** (7): slightly confused yeehaw?

**nick1372** (6.5): Sweet but a bit sonically out of place

**AHSWeeknd** (6): this beat following ICU…

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh no there's banjo! I'll try to be fair because of the lyrics having some interesting themes.

**QustoMar** (5): stardew valley vibes

**jman457** (4.8): alright

**cyborglilith** (4.5): PrEdICtAblY WiNdS uP thInkinG oF eLvIs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This is probably the song I skip the most on the album. Just find it kinda boring.

**wavingwolves** (10): I love the concept of this, probably one the few christmas songs I would ever listen to in my own volution. Still, this being placed here makes kind of no sense to me, but we roll.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): We love a crossover episode! Especially when it's between Phoebe, Fiona, AND Simon & Garfunkel. Not gonna lie, I can barely tell Fiona's on the song, but I still appreciate that it exists.

---

**IIIHenryIII** (10): It's so sad yet so beautiful!

**jayjaysortagay** (10): I don't understand but I'm still glad this exists

**plastichaxan** (10): i listened to this a lot when it came out, i don't know why, i was just really drawn to the mix in my headphones and their voices going so well together

**ReallyCreative** (10): things to deconstruct: Matt Berninger continues to have a VIP Express Premium Pass to this bussy, this is a cool cover/update, this is a really cool collaboration, Silent Night still fucking sucks

**skargardin** (10): wow

**jman457** (9.6): xmas sad bop

**ggal2020** (7.8): So good with one earbud in

**static\_int\_husp** (7): decent cover, not entirely sure how I feel about the voiceover, or how it will age

**bbfan132** (6): where were matt and fiona? i guess i heard fiona towards the end a bit but still

**pat-rickstar** (6): ... I have no idea what to think of this

**team\_kockroach** (6): Worth listening to once and never again. The Simon and Garfunkel version is better by a mile - maybe because the audio mixing is better.

**celladonn** (5): There is something very haunting about this track and the Simon and Garfunkel original, but I also find both versions kind of unlistenable

**nick1372** (5): not a huge fan of songs that put a piece of politics in there with zero commentary on it. Please have an opinion that is why I’m listening to you

**engifear** (4): Pretentious and there are moments that just sound really off, beat wise

**thedoctordances1940** (4): Just because Simon and Garfunkel had a bad idea, doesn't mean you need to copy it

**shhhneak** (3.5): Imagine this coming on shuffle at the family Christmas party. Like damn way to kill the mood.

**fadedblue09** (3): Wtf is this

**CritneySpearz** (2): too much going on for my tiny brain

**vayyiqra** (2): This is bearable if you listen to the left channel alone. Otherwise it's auditory terrorism to try to focus on a Christmas carol and screwed-up news stories at the same time. My brain does not like it! Not good!

**endcreditouilles** (1): This is one of my least favorite Christmas songs, and the newscast is jarring, it's not something I would listen to after the rate.

**SideBTrack8** (10): The production is so haunting and beautiful. The lyrics are unfortunately a little too relatable.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): A thematic sequel to Moon Song. This seems to be a least favourite song on the record for a lot of people, and that was the most surprising thing about it for me. I personally really love the instrumenal, it feels almost fairytale-like, while the lyrics are devastating to me. Phoebe has said she wrote this song in a dream, it was like it came to her, and I feel like I hear that. It feels so tender, but it describes such emotional violent things. It's as if you can feel how much she's giving in into this relationship and how much that takes from her. Who has never felt like you're giving too much of yourself in order to try to make someone else better? I've been in this situation so many times that this feels to me as if I'm looking at a mirror that shows both my past and my present. It's ruthless.

---

# Knights 

**Vromega** (11): Absolutely gorgeous melody and voice. The instruments are talking to each other, dancing in a splendid atmosphere. Perfection

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The production went off.

**bespectacIed** (10): when phoebe tweeted about being sad slash grateful she wasn't making music yet during the twilight saga era because she would have inevitably been a part of the soundtrack... And then hayley quote tweeted her disagreement lmaoooo. That was a classic. Oh and yes this song is flawless

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me, crying while pussy popping over my insecurities about the intimacy i have with my friends

**CzrLandWhale** (10): Alexa, make me fucking weep.

**endcreditouilles** (10): ohhh I love this. So warm and nostalgic. I'm a sucker for that major IV to minor iv chord progression, it's gorgeous and very well done here, the production really highlights it. The composition overall is brilliant, the synths and strings both are emotional and virtuosic. The non-resolving chord at the end is just heart wrenching, absolutely nails. And the lyrical contrast is the cherry on top, beautifully composed on every element. Perfect song. If I could give a second 11 this would be it.

**just\_thonking** (10): a big grower for me; very beautiful

**notoriouspge** (10): the violin is simply beautiful

**skargardin** (10): THE STRINGS

**conceptualromance** (9.5): an underrated moment imo

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): The pissing contest line throws me off every time but otherwise this is probably one of the prettiest sounding songs released last year

**akanewasright** (9): Watch me sing this as a lullaby to my kids, teaching them about pissing contests right outbid the womb

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): My only complaint is I feel like 20 seconds could have been cut out of this.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Goddamn this song feels like an attack to me. I tend to help people more than solving my own problems so yeah...Jesus Christ the pain is too real.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): It sounds so pretty.

**runaway3212** (9): my ex bff be like

**Stryxen** (9): she knew she was going to break my heart with “show me yours and i'll show you mine”

**thedoctordances1940** (9): All I can say is that this isn't the kind of song you'd expect to hear the words "pissing contest" in

**savemeaseat143** (8.7): *saviour

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): vintage Phoebe. this probably would've scored lower prior to the music video dropping, but it really elevated the song for me

**totallynot14\_** (8.5): it's a pheobe bridgers song

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): I like the way this song builds and flourishes, absolutely loathe how it ends

**Awkward\_King** (8): phoebe fuck off im not in the fucking mood

**iniekcja\_** (8): it isn't bad at all, I just think that the copycat killer version is miles better

**leviswift13** (8): has the misfortune of following what is in my eyes phoebe's best song. still, so so so good.

**nick1372** (8): this is the kind of song I refuse to think about too much because I won’t enjoy what I think about

**OberionSynth** (8): phoebe bridgers stop exposing all my problems challenge

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute a bit

**bbfan132** (7.5): v relaxing to listen to

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I do love the warm folk vibe of this, but I’m not fond of some lyrics (namely ‘pissing contest’ and those vampire/skeleton references kinda send a hideous imagery for me).

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): i like them strings

**seanderlust** (7): "one hand on the wheel, one hand in your mouth" https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EhLCMixVoAAGr4g.jpg

**Uberpigeon** (7): like punisher, it's very slow but I do like the lyrics in this one a lot

**vayyiqra** (7): I am a counsellor who works in crisis intervention as in I'm the guy who talks to suicidal persons in the middle of the night so I am deeply familiar with the saviour complex and how unhealthy it can be. Surprisingly this song doesn't seem to have *that* much to do with it though. Still a good concept to name a song after though.

# Villains

**jman457** (6.8): Lyrically I really like and relate to this even if the execution is a little, eh

**frogaranaman** (6): men shouldn’t have a savior complex unless the dick is good

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (5): Never connected with it like I did with the rest of the stuff on the album

**NotWith10000Men** (5): it's okay i guess

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): “Baby, you're a vampire / You want blood and I promised” omg i love this song about bella and edward’s love story

**proscett** (3): this is one of my least favorites :(

**zagreux** (0): This song ruins the flow of the album for me. It's boring sonically and the lyrics aren't that good.

**wavingwolves** (9.7): Featuring Cara Delevingne meows, the title track was inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/eKhMgNUUQw0) scene of The Fall, where the main character says "fetch the bolt cutters" to her partners in order to release a woman who has been tortured. The message is the song is the same of the whole record: in Fiona's own words, to "fetch the fucking bolt cutters and get yourself out of the situation that you’re in — whatever it is that you don’t like." Its about self liberation, about being freed from prisons you made for yourself and being freed from the expectations others put onto you. It's powerful and warm, it feels both reassuring (*I need to run up that hill / I will, I will, I will*) and brutal (*I got the idea I wasn't real). And oh, I love the dogs at the final minute of the song. It really makes it for me.

**SideBTrack8** (9): Originally I had a slightly lower score since I find the song a bit repetitive, but it's honestly such a great song with a great message, a little repetition is fine. I love that Fiona and Cara's dogs started barking while they were recording and she decided to just keep it in.

# Meoooooooooow

**llieno94** (11): anyone who has ever felt depressed or trapped in their own life and circumstances will surely feel this song on some level... Fiona’s flow and rhyming are part of what makes her one of the best living songwriters and those skills are so effortlessly incorporated here, it’s almost hard to notice. Her singing on this album is closer to poetry recitation.

**useless-sheep** (11): love the outro so much

**zagreux** (11): this song captures being bullied in school so well. the ''while i'd not yet found my bearings, those it girls hit the ground comparing the way i was to the way she was saying I'm not stylish enough and i cried too much / and i listened because i hadn't found my own voice yet / so all i could hear was the noise that people make when they don't know shit / but i didn't know that yet'' part made me cry with how relatable it was - when you're young and impressionable as a preteen you tend to believe what the bullies say, and whenever kids would walk up to me and call me a fag or make fun of me for being feminine i'd internalize all that and it took me a **long** time to get rid of that internalized homophobia. thank you fiiona, for telling me to fetch the fucking bolt cutters.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): Of course it's a ten, what do you take me for, an idiot?

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This production is insanity.

**Awkward\_King** (10): thinking about how that's cara delevigne meowing

**bbfan132** (10): absolutely love how this flows, the spoken word nature of it at times works perfectly

**bespectacIed** (10): vegetable cutters

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Leo, Alfie, Mercy and Maddie are the true icons here

**cyborglilith** (10): the production is mindblowing

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i can't listen to this song without thinking of the [fetch the poppers](https://imgur.com/a/uQg8qgj) meme

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): In love with the "and you maim on your offence, but you kill on your defence" line... Brilliance.

**fadedblue09** (10): Instrumental is ominous and unique. But the real highlight is Fiona's confessional and autobiographical songwriting.

**forgetquick** (10): Probably my second choice for my 11. She manages to be determined, angry, hissing, frustrated, and hoping at different points during this song and it's all amazing. The percussion and lyrics are perfect.

**hunnybee12** (10): i cant explain why this song makes me cry everytime but it does

**ReallyCreative** (10): me approximately 37 seconds after clocking in for work

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): l need to run up that hill!! Kate Bush's impact <3

**sarcasticsobs** (10): spit it, girl

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I may or may not be planning on getting a tattoo of a pair of bolt cutters once I'm fully vaccinated next month because of how much this resonated with me when I first heard it last year

**Stryxen** (10): invented running up that hill

**totallynot14\_** (10): my first introduction to Fiona and she ended up my 2020 most played artist, i couldn't stop listening to this song the first time I heard it

**waluigiest** (10): little red’s grandma after the wolf eats her

**xcjm** (10): Kate Bush approves

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): this song got me through quarantine god bless

**survivorjdmarina** (9.9): Listening to this for the first time was also surreal, since the intro was the only sonic existence we had of the album for half a month. I really love Cara Delevingne’s contribution here too. Not too sure about the dogs though.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): bonus point for kate reference

**kirby31200** (9.5): A Fiona Apple song with references to Kate Bush? Of course Pitchfork ate this up

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9.5): the song is pure poetry

**CzrLandWhale** (9): meow!

**EnCaine** (9): i cannot blame the dogs i'd be excited if i was there too

**iniekcja\_** (9): there's something about incorporating dogs' barking in a song that always gets me

**leviswift13** (9): perfect title track!

**runaway3212** (9): 'ive been in here to long' me @ the basement im currently doing this rate from

**seanderlust** (9): i'm usually not crazy about "the media sucks" songs - not that I think the artists are wrong (they're very right), but it just feels overdone. however, this is a fairly good rendition of the theme, so i'll give it a pass. when it comes to the media sucks songs, we will never outdo piece of me by britney let's be honest

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This is probably my favorite lyrically

**skargardin** (9): this hits

**welcometoNY** (8.5): the dogs barking at the end is just annoying in the name of artistry, but otherwise brilliant

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I love the chorus on this one but I'm not as crazy about the verses. I'm sure this really hit people when it came out last April for obvious reasons. Also the dogs went off.

**CarlieScion** (8): pleasant to listen to

**cremeebrulee** (8): there’s so much here i love, how home-y it feel when she’s talking about the pressures of being famous, the running up the hill reference, the percussion. but as a track i don’t revisit it as often as the others.

**vayyiqra** (8): "Running Up That Hill" is a song by the English singer-songwriter Kate Bush. It was the first single from her 1985 album Hounds of Love, released in the United Kingdom on 5 August 1985.

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): Probably the only song on Fetch The Bolt Cutters that could’ve used a shortened edit, it does drag towards the end

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): serving the percussion CD’s I had to listen to in band class

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this is the part that made me save it: "I grew up in the shoes they told me I could fill / Shoes that were not made for running up that hill / And I need to run up that hill"

**pheromenos** (7.5): cara delevingne's main pop girls

**bulforster** (7.3): Could do with a bit more of a melody.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): woof woof bork woof bork bork

**frogaranaman** (7): thought that was my dog for a second then I realized that I am living in my dorm room and my dog is like 500 miles away

**jayjaysortagay** (7): we don't really need pointless long outros like this do we bestie, ruins the flow a bit

**OberionSynth** (7): just found out cara delevigne is on this track ?? i was like "why is fiona doing a british accent here" lmao getaway car who??

**pat-rickstar** (7): Vegetable cutters, I've been in here too long

**QustoMar** (7): me to my child when i need to clean up the vines that have grown out all over the fences around my house

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (7): I could be persuaded to rate this higher, but right now the dog barks in the background enrage me.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.8): The random noises in the background just enhance the quality of this song. Please, give us more animal sounds on your albums!

**jman457** (6.3): for the title track it gives a little more to be desired

**Vromega** (6): not fond of this "speaking" style. It lacks lyricism for me. Also I'm more of a cat person

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): kicked it up half a point for the last minute

**endcreditouilles** (5): Not a fan of the spoken vocals, but once "Fetch The Bolt Cutters" comes in I'm starting to feel it. Overall it's too disjunct with the vocals for my taste, the animal SFX lose me too.

**just\_thonking** (5): if a song is gonna be this repetitive it should at least be enjoyable or interesting. Nothing really happens

**proscett** (5): boring, but the dog barks are cute

**SmileAndTears** (5): what a mess of a song lol

**Turpamutteri** (4): I'm sorry but nothing happens in this song

**1998tweety** (3): shes just talking here, minus 1 point for the dogs barking

**shhhneak** (0): not the title track having dogs barking as an outro. Ma’am just press pause and come back later!!

**WeakProduct** (0): Fiona’s sound is definitely unique, this much we know. Usually, I don’t have issues with it, but sometimes i just cannot vibe with her songs. I can’t get past a certain noise or rhythm. This is one of those songs. I do consider this album to be good but good god I hate this song so much it is just not it for me.

**wavingwolves** (9.1): A very sweet sounding sound with one of the most emotioanl deliveries of the whole record. It's about a very unique subject too: parasocial relationships. In this case, the idea of Phoebe's relationship with her favourite artist, Elliott Smith. The one other song that I know that touches on this subject is [Idle Worship](https://youtu.be/gIFz9xNibNs) by Paramore, and even that doesn't treat it with this level of delicacy. This is one of the songs that every time I listen to I notice a different thing about it. The processing of her vocals on the first verse is especially noticiable for me now, it feels layered and dream-like. This also features one of my favourite lyrics of the whole album: "I love a good place to hide in plain sight". It's just such a weirdly reassuring thing to be put into words.

**SideBTrack8** (9): I love this song but for some reason I can never remember what it sounds like. Name any other song on the album and I can think of a melody or some lyrics, but this one always escapes me.

---


# Elliott Smith, in spirit 

**bigbigbee** (11): I criticize parasocial relationships a lot, but mostly because I’m very much not immune to them. I think this song is an achingly beautiful ode to the way that your idea of a person can impact you, even if you don’t know them personally. That feeling of “you mean so much to me and yet you’ll never know me” is one that a lot of us must have had: the love you feel. The sadness. A fear at the concept of actually meeting face to face. This song has some of her best one liners, too: “A copycat killer with a chemical cut” is such a cute, tongue in cheek way to acknowledge how much her music draws on Elliott Smith’s.

**bespectacIed** (10): I didn't like this the first time, I thought this was a "should've kept this in the drafts" moment...But in retrospect, phoebe admitting her elliot smith plagiarism is such a girlboss moment that I have to applaud

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Possibly the most beautiful chorus on the entire album. And THAT ENDING chef's kiss

**CarlieScion** (10): this is a comfort song

**leviswift13** (10): feels so delicate and personal to me. "wouldn't know where to start, wouldn't know when to stop"

**llieno94** (10): this song took me awhile to understand, but when I heard the explanation, that it’s about her late, artistic idol, Elliot Smith, it made the song so much more impactful. Wanting to walk in the steps of your creative inspirations, almost to a fatalist point, is a familiar feeling, but not something usually captured in many songs.

**runaway3212** (10): I love snow white, but this is a bop

**TiltControls** (10): this the most gorgeous that Phoebe has ever sounded and I hope it gets enough love in the rate

**totallynot14\_** (10): can i give a song a 10.5? this is a beautiful song even if i don't have as many depressed hours looking at the ceiling of my room logged to it as i do with garden song

**xcjm** (10): my current fav on this album but it rotates on the regular. Wouldn't know where to start? Wouldn't know when to STOP?! WHEW!

**conceptualromance** (9.9): this song is really dreamy; love the way it ends abruptly

**akanewasright** (9.5): Just fucking gorgeous

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): The melody in the chorus is so beautiful and her voice sounds so soothing! I love it!

**AHSWeeknd** (9): “What if I told you I know you?” Why did that line scare me?

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): murder me queen

**cremeebrulee** (9): i think i have more appreciation for this after the IH rate/listening to elliot smith so shoutout to that

**OberionSynth** (9): i've never heard of elliot smith, but this song perfectly says how i feel about one of my favorite artists who passed away in 2017

**shesdoingyoga** (9): This is the one that I personally underrate the most I think

**SmileAndTears** (9): awww

**team\_kockroach** (9): “I can't open my mouth and forget how to talk” is the best line of this song.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): love the vibe, the vocal effects, the story behind the song, one of the more underrated songs off Punisher

**Vromega** (9): nothing outstanding but everything is so satisfying

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): oh :/

**jasannn** (8.5): How did I have this song on repeat for an hour while doing homework?

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Like many of the other songs here, this falls under hauntingly beautiful, but slightly too passive. When you're in the mood for it though, there's nothing quite like it.

**jman457** (8.4): feels very nostalgic, I like the sentiment of the song even if most of her songs feel very “Colorless green ideas sleep furiously” Or in popheads terms “Buttered noodles on the veranda”

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8): I like this song.

**bbfan132** (8): very pretty, i like how honest she is in the lyrics about her being an unpleasant superfan lol

**CrimsonROSET** (8): no really this song is so fucking specific but its also almost about nothing

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Only Phoebe can write a beautiful song about her having a parasocial relationship with her dead favorite artist. Like jeez, this is one of those songs you wish you could write.

**kirby31200** (8): Punisher? I hardly know her!

**NotWith10000Men** (8): this is really lovely. She floats over the song

**pat-rickstar** (8): This one is underrated I feel, it's so dreamy

**survivorjdmarina** (8): I like the theme behind it being a imagined conversation between her and Elliott Smith.

**waluigiest** (8): learning what she means makes me appreciate the album title more

**zagreux** (8): her vocals here oh my fucking gosh

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**proscett** (7.5): quite a nice track i can't lie!

**frogaranaman** (7): I feel like I know you, but we never met because you decided you didn’t want to get dick that night

# Punishers

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why is the ending so abrupt ...

**nick1372** (7): The most boring song on the album if only because it’s central concept is a music industry inside joke.

**Uberpigeon** (7): Punisher and halloween are my least favourite songs from the album, they're just a bit slow and dull for my tastes. The lyrics pull it up to a seven for me though

**vayyiqra** (7): "When the speed kicks in" is me doing this rate 90 minutes before the hard deadline on Vyvanse so I can try to focus because time has no meaning anymore and depression is sapping my will to life! but I am making myself do it! for Belb!

**Stryxen** (6.5): the least good piano song in the very good piano heavy rate

**wasian-invasion** (6): I think the first time I listened to this album I was at the gym and was annoyed it didnt pump me up as much as kyoto

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): you can do better than this phoebe xx

**fadedblue09** (5): Never have I been so underwhelmed by a title track in my life

**ktajlili** (5): idk it annoys me that she mentions drug use in like every other song. like it seems like she's trying too hard to be edgy.

**ReallyCreative** (5): this song shows up, does nothing, and leaves

**bulforster** (4): I'm not Elliot Smith from beyond the grave, so I feel like there's a limit to how much I can get out of this.

**cyborglilith** (3.4): who the fuck is Elliott Smith

**SideBTrack8** (7): We tried so hard to keep Taylor out of the rate but she still snuck her way in at the last minute. I've never been the biggest Taylor fan, and this definitely isn't doing her any favours. She tried to emulate Danielle's shouty vocal delivery but it just doesn't work.

**wavingwolves** (4): 🧍

---

**CarlieScion** (10): im giving this a 10 specifically to piss off SideB <3

**CritneySpearz** (10): wish Taylor featured Haim the same about she's featured here oop

**endcreditouilles** (10): This absolutely deserves an equal rating to the original. On top of it being a great song, where else are we going to hear America's Sweetheart say "you needed ass, well what's wrong with that?" What IS wrong with that?

**ggal2020** (10): Nearly a carbon copy of the original with just a little more star power

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Any song with a Taylor feature is enhanced naturally.

**leviswift13** (10): I GET SAD

**pheromenos** (10): would be hilarious if this wins, it won't tho. but it's still good.

**waluigiest** (10): original Gasoline is great and Taylor fits in well

**xcjm** (10): Haim on the OG Gasoline: I get sad :(. Taylor on the remix: I!!!! GET!!!! SAD!!!!!!!!

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Doesn't deserve to get tanked just bc of Taylor, it's a great song with or without her

**savemeaseat143** (9.3): improved bridge

**kirby31200** (9): She doesn't really add anything but she doesn't detract either

**ktajlili** (9): I like both versions but honestly this doesn't add much that wasn't already in the original

**rosecult** (9): Taylor's "I get sad! >:(" versus Danielle's "I get sad :("

**shhhneak** (8.6): Taylor’s verses are jump scares.

**akanewasright** (8): ... I was gonna give this a 10 to piss off my dear friend SideB, but... Taylor’s verse isn’t that good. Her backing vocals are nice though

**OberionSynth** (8): imagine taylor letting HAIM sing this much on no body no crime, take notes girly

**slimboyfriend** (8): Oops I think Taylor makes this song better and it fits her voice perfectly

**totallynot14\_** (8): [STALE TOPIC]

**martian\_pet** (7.9): ily taylor but nothing of substance was added to this remix, same rating as the original

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Taylor doesn’t really make this better or worse

**nick1372** (7.5): Don’t think this really improves upon the original. The harmonies on the second half are really nice though

**notoriouspge** (7.5): The epitome of a bonus remix, unnecessary but cute

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): not as good as the original

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): taylor is the top in her relationship with haim

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7): Yeah, sure. The only thing it really adds to the song is Taylor shouting "I get sad!"

**Alumineous** (7): Nice of HAIM to let Taylor Swift have her own verse!

**bbfan132** (7): taylor actively detracts from the song, sorry swifties… still good though

**celladonn** (7): I like Taylor but the concept of giving this a lower score than the original is too funny to not do it

**engifear** (7): I prefer the original, but Taylor doesn't make this significantly worse. It mostly just feels like an unnecessary remix.

**outsideeyess** (7): i mean taylor really does ruin it

**RandomHypnotica** (7): Haim was FAR more generous than Taylor to provide her with actual words for her feature, but this just ultimately feels really pointless

**seanderlust** (7): something about taylor's voice bothers me here.

**salivantsonority** (6): It's just not as good as the original

**plastichaxan** (5.8): it's the way i'm giving it the same rating cause i didn't notice taylor in this for me

**CzrLandWhale** (5): I'm sorry but this one doesn't really work for me. I was really excited when this was announced, but now I'm mad that it plays before the bonus tracks when I play the album on Spotify.

**fadedblue09** (5): Literally nothing changed

**skargardin** (5): I mean it's still Gasoline but Taylor added literally nothing of interest to this

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I literally can not tell the difference between this and the original, and since remixes should be different, that means this gets a lower score

**vayyiqra** (5): Look I like Taylor but I've had enough Taylor lately. No more for now.

**cremeebrulee** (4): why is she oversinging like this help ….. should’ve just gave her some bg vocals instead xx

**TiltControls** (4): Taylor is here... but she doesn't really add much

**NecroDolphinn** (3): Because I hate seeing white gays happy (he says as a hardcore swiftie)

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): The answering machine messages add so much charm to the song, I'm sad they got taken off for the remix. I guess some people might think it's a little weird or out of place but it really makes the song for me.

**wavingwolves** (9): Okay, the voicemail in this is soooo *chef's kiss*. This is still such a fun song that I wished it had gotten a bit higher than this. It's just so smooth and I love the production and effects in it. It just feels so much fun to listen to, I'm sure it's a more fun experience than getting a call at 3 AM.

---

# People who wish they got booty calls

**CreepyMannequin** (11): A standout from the first time I listened to the album. Lyrically strong and still a bop.

**QustoMar** (11): what an enjoyable fun dance tune! love the voicemail

**sssaaage** (11): halsey and haim queens of having 11s called 3am

**1998tweety** (10): i already know this is gonna be controversial but I love the phone call bit

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): This is the portion of the album that just really works perfectly for me

**bookthieving** (10): the textures are impeccable [chef's kiss]

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): so dreamy

**conceptualromance** (10): Halsey 🤝 Haim: releasing a song called 3am in 2020

**cremeebrulee** (10): the only people allowed to put voicemails on their tracks

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): :niki:

**endcreditouilles** (10): This is a whole vibe, the balance on everything is fantastic. I wish I could hear this one live in a small venue.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): love the sound on this one it’s just so lush and dreamy.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): all songs called 3AM released in 2020 are classics

**kirby31200** (10): This is what Spiderwebs would've sounded like if Gwen Stefani went pop a decade earlier

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): more like 10 AM haha am i right ladies

**notoriouspge** (10): didn't know Haim created late-night booty calls

**ReallyCreative** (10): insomnia slutdrop anthem!!

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Songs titled 3 AM and being my favorite on an album I otherwise don’t really care for, name a more iconic duo

**totallynot14\_** (10): they were in their RnB bag with this one Destiny's HAIM

**waluigiest** (10): it’s incredible and reminds me of like.... Steve lacy? I also love a good booty call song it’s really excellent

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): https://media.tenor.com/images/62891d0e4fde1c1a1d3c2cdd92f4e809/tenor.gif

**rosecult** (9.5): ended Halsey again

**shhhneak** (9.3): This is the only good song released in 2020 with a voicemail on it.

**akanewasright** (9): a motherfucking JAM

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Besides I Know Alone this is probably the best chorus on the entire album. Also, girl you are not picking up for the last time and we all know it.

**CzrLandWhale** (9): I just can't stop staring at it 👀

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is giving me some kind of late-80s psychedelic vibe. I love it!

**leviswift13** (9): it's so camp

**llieno94** (9): the most outwardly funky and rnb leaning song HAIM has ever done, they surprisingly pull it off with ease, hope they make more like this.

**nick1372** (9): love a good hookup anthem

**OberionSynth** (9): me pretending i've had a booty call when i'm too scared to even download grindr

**survivorjdmarina** (9): Another interesting switch up. Sounds nice.

**vayyiqra** (9): if you told me in 2013 that Haim of all bands would write a late-night sex jam funk song in 2020 and it would be pretty good I might laugh and yet

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Bringing the 90s back. Thanks. Aren't you all just tired of the 80s? C'mon. It's literally what every pop act has been pushing over the last few years. I'm not hating on any of them. I actually really like some of the stuff they have put out, but it's kinda overused now.

**steelstepladder** (8.2): Idk if this is an unpopular opinion but the Thundercat version is better

**jman457** (8.1): we love a funky bop

**bbfan132** (8): this feels like a unique take on bedroom pop/etc to me, it’d be fun to hear more like this from them without the issues i have with the production

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this one isn’t better than the remix!

**runaway3212** (8): Charli outsold

**skargardin** (8): I wonder how this would hit at 3AM

**Stryxen** (8): this song transports me to an unbearably hot summer night and i can’t explain it

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): someone get these girls some ZzzQuil

**AHSWeeknd** (7): EST or PST?

**Awkward\_King** (7): who tf checks their voicemails still?? if you send me a voicemail i will not be listening to it and also will look at you funny next time i see you

**bespectacIed** (7): bop

# Halsey stans who will do the Break Up Pop Rock rate

**CarlieScion** (7): a MAN???? In this rate ?????

**fadedblue09** (7): I really don’t get why the intro sounded like that. The rest of the song is fine but doesn’t fully click.

**frogaranaman** (7): is this about Grindr

**ggal2020** (7): The one and only weak point in this entire rate, and it’s still a good song

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the beat saves it from being too mellow. The record scratches are cute

**pat-rickstar** (7): Kinda gets eaten up by the Thundercat remix

**SmileAndTears** (7): My least fave on the album

**TiltControls** (7): Matchbox Twenty > Halsey > Wild World > City Folk > RAC > New Leaf > HAIM > GCN > New Horizons

**Uberpigeon** (7): this is groovy

**wasian-invasion** (7): Who wants a phone call at three in the morning? Oh boy! 3 AM!

**xcjm** (7): Also prefer the thundercat remix!

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): Yes the distorted vocal effects are back, that didn’t get annoying. Haim on a reggae styled beat shouldn’t work, it shouldn’t work, and it doesn’t really work, but I think the harmonisation, and the great hook save it enough from some distracting vocal effects

**forgetquick** (6.5): Wish there was a second verse or something to make this a little more substantial.

**proscett** (6.5): tbh not my favorite! its decent tho

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6.5): Halsey outsold.

**seanderlust** (6): literally no dick is worth being woken up at 3 am. none. I am SLEEPING. leave me alone.

**thedoctordances1940** (5): The song is alright at best but the vocals are just really poorly mixed imo

**ManofOranges** (4): This one is cute and all but I really just don't like how the chorus sounds at all. It just kind of drones along and does nothing for me. If I'm being perfectly honest I find it very annoying.

**SideBTrack8** (9): I know this probably sounds like I'm just hating on Taylor, but the remix really made me appreciate the original more. Taylor tried to emulate Danielle's delivery but it just really didn't work. Danielle has such a unique voice and is able to do so much with it.

**wavingwolves** (7.8): I must admit this shrunk on me since release, but I still find it immensaly enjoyable and just such an easy listen. It's a very charming little track, a little bit funky, a little bit sexy. Makes me think late afternoons in bed where the sun is hitting the room just right and it makes you feel like you could melt. I think the best moment of it is the bridge, when that filter comes and it changes it up and then the last chorus comes on. Feels very sophisticated.

---


# Arsonists 

**conceptualromance** (11): no it’s literally insane how good this is you guys

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (11): Ever since my first listen this song became my fav of the album, is soooo smooth and sexy, it just screams SUNSET to me.

**rosecult** (11): ended Halsey

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is the music that people associate Coachella with

**bespectacIed** (10): Fucking flawless. Pussy eating anthems are never not a 10 in my book. There is no remix in ba sing se

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the only good version of this song yup yup

**CzrLandWhale** (10): Cars, but make it sexy!

**endcreditouilles** (10): I'm sorry but this is my slut anthem, this song makes me feel so sexy. Production feels so dreamy, the processed-feel works for me on this one. And the melody/lyrics are perfect for belting in the shower. I GET SAD!

**ggal2020** (10): That bridge into the instrumental...it gets me man

**leviswift13** (10): yeah ......... *yeah*

**outsideeyess** (10): my cat loves this song

**pat-rickstar** (10): The chorus is one of my favourites in the rate, so smooth

**ReallyCreative** (10): but why male models

**SmileAndTears** (10): I don't have time to do the bonus rate so I'll say this here: The original is amazing but the Taylor remix is utter garbage. I'd even argue it's worse than the bad guy remix

**survivorjdmarina** (10): Inject this shit into my veins.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): the bridge is excellent and takes the song to a whole new level

**Turpamutteri** (10): steamy

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): This song, appropriately titled, is straight up gas.

**waluigiest** (10): the chorus melody is really really pretty

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): I can’t think of this song now without thinking about Taylor screeching on the remix.

**CarlieScion** (9.9): i’m giving this a lower score than the remix to piss off sideb <3

**runaway3212** (9.9): the taylor version slightly outsold

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): this is so good, the remix on the oth- [GUNSHOT]

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This is a dangerous song to play in the kitchen, cuz it's flammable!

**proscett** (9.5): sheryl crow realness. i am fuming...

**steelstepladder** (9.5): Really love the guitar in this one

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): chorus feels like a smirk

**bbfan132** (9): great road trip song

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As someone who is used to listening to the Taylor remix version, it takes a while to adjust to a differently sung second verse by one of the HAIM sisters as well as the absence of added ad-libs. However, I really dig this version and I can definitely see this in the top 10 list because it's definitely a stand-out track on the album.

**llieno94** (9): the catchiest and most easy going chorus on this rate. The bridge and following outro are one of the strongest moments of this album, like driving over a hill at dusk to reveal a sunset and open road.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): sex anthem

**nick1372** (9): I also get sad

**skargardin** (9): I GET SAD

**notoriouspge** (8.5): i gET SAD big mood and so smooth

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8): I like when a song is from the perspective of a terrible person. And I, also, get sad.

**Awkward\_King** (8): it makes me feel like i am sat on a chair in the middle of the road ? help ?

**flavasavavandal** (8): Oh cool there are actually great songs on this album. The hype and acclaim this album received isn’t completely undeserved. It’s not the hottest song ever, but it does get there, and it’s cool we aren’t drowning out Danielle this time with that summery haze this time

**kappyko** (8): wtf and now their vocals are good??

**ManofOranges** (8): I love the smell of gasoline.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): very mellow but it like it. the harmonies in the chorus remind me of soak up the sun

**Quiet-Tone13** (8): Simplistic and boring lyrics, but a nice vibe and melody

**seanderlust** (8): is it weird singing a horny anthem with your sisters?

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I love the melody but again the vocals are just mixed a bit too far back for my liking.

**totallynot14\_** (8): eh

**wasian-invasion** (8): Dame más gasolina

**xcjm** (8): sorry Haimies, Gasoline (Taylor's Version) wins this one for me

**jasannn** (7.5): We love horny songs.

# Swifties 

**jman457** (7.2): its a throwback, but seems a little too derivitive

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I love a good horny anthem and this is really pretty but it does bore me a teeny bit.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this one is better than the remix!

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): I think this has always been my least favorite song on the album. It doesn't stand out to me sonically at all, albeit the guitars in the verses (and that gorgeous outro) are quite pretty.

**OberionSynth** (7): pretty sure my car wrote this song bc of how often i ignore the gas light

**vayyiqra** (7): Verse 2 is so true so relatable

**iniekcja\_** (6.5): love the lyrics, dislike about everything else (but it's with great sadness and remorse)

**fadedblue09** (6): Very unemotional and goes nowhere.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): kinda slow and boring

**Stryxen** (6): gasoline gatekeep girlboss

**useless-sheep** (6): first song i heard from this album and it made me not want to listen to the rest

**wavingwolves** (10): Hey, u/roxieloxie, I dedicate this one to you! This is one of the most fun songs in this album and every time I listen to it I can't stop myself from looping it a bit. It's just contagious and feels like the ultimate HAIM song, it just fits them better than any other song in this album. The outro feels like a celebration, it's the most triumphant moment in the whole record and I'm fully obsessed with it since I first heard it.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): It's literally impossible to not sing along to the chorus, it's infectious. The lyrics are a bit repetitive, but the buildup during the second half makes it so you hardly notice.

# Love ham

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (10): One of my faves from last year.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why do I feel like this’ll be an early out

**akanewasright** (10): I don’t care, this is just too much of a bop

**bespectacIed** (10): Gorgeous

**bulforster** (10): I love how blissfully bright this one is, especially that closing guitar hook and the horns in the final chorus.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): When I had to reveal the remaining Roisin songs in #5-#3 placements.

**fadedblue09** (10): Very fun and catchy sound, and there's some vocal vulnerability here. Definitely one of my favorites here.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Another one that gets my feet going. It sounds so good. I love it so much.

**kappyko** (10): wait a minute this is The Greatest Song Ever Made

**ManofOranges** (10): Me when there's something that I don't wanna do.

**nick1372** (10): there’s so many examples of Haim experimenting with new styles and finding unique sounds but this is the closest track on the album to their earlier sound and it’s honestly one of the best here

**pat-rickstar** (10): I can see why people might think this is generic but I love it, especially the last minute

**ReallyCreative** (10): my favorite HAIM song, excited for it to not make top 10 in favor of like 6 phoebe bridgers songs that are super cohesive (derogatory)

**shhhneak** (10): The Haim Sisters laced every chorus in this album with pure crack.

**skargardin** (10): but what a banger

**survivorjdmarina** (10): My favourite on the album by far.

**TiltControls** (10): summer song perfection, summer girl outsold

**totallynot14\_** (10): they were in their 90's mmBOP bag with this one HAIMson

**1998tweety** (9): this is cute and bops

**bbfan132** (9): feel like this is the song that best defines their sound

**bigbigbee** (9): This is just so cute. It’s serving me mid-00s romcom; think The Princess Diaries or something.

**notoriouspge** (9): The cymbal crash going into the last chorus? BOP

**RandomHypnotica** (9): the ending of this track goes off hard

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Not much to say about this, it's just a really good song

**conceptualromance** (8.5): I’m always just really impressed with Haim’s songwriting abilities. They’re so good at coming up with something catchy

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I really like this but I wish the production was a bit more full throughout

**just\_thonking** (8.5): love the way the song subtly opens up. Also the guitars

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Queens of walking to nowhere in particular

**steelstepladder** (8.5): All these songs are really really good but theres always something missing from really ascending the songs into great status

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): it’s a jam what can I say

**CarlieScion** (8): this goes awf

**leviswift13** (8): feels like it could exist on any haim album, but it still has the grit that feels essential to this body of work.

**llieno94** (8): the most obviously apparent radio hit from the album. In the wrong hands it could be a watered down vanilla adult contemporary radio single, but thankfully Haim’s rock edge keeps it from being boring.

**martian\_pet** (8): For some reason this reminds of that Shaggy song

**proscett** (8): this is haim concentrate (in a good way)

**Uberpigeon** (8): Ive only heard this from far-away tinny speakers at work I did NOT know it went that hard at the end!

**Stryxen** (7.5): this just makes me happy and there’s nothing wrong with it but i have not once related to it

# Vegans

**Alumineous** (7): Sounds like Bleachers.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It's got a catchy chorus but it just doesn't stick with me much.

**OberionSynth** (7): this song reminds me of mcgee and me for some reason and i'm def aging myself with that reference

**runaway3212** (7): this is super mid

**vayyiqra** (7): Haim soft rock 70s so true

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): cute but kinda nothing

**jman457** (6.3): there is a time and place for this song and sound

**CrimsonROSET** (6): me listening to the middle of this album after it starts off with a bang

**flavasavavandal** (6): I mean it’s perfectly serviceable, doesn’t particularly excite me, still has the problem where the little details feel drained of colour

**hunnybee12** (6): this reminds me of something that would be on their last album it's not bad just blah

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): wouldn’t last a day in itzy

**cyborglilith** (1): What's the point?

**wavingwolves** (10): SMASH! I remember when I first found out about this song and became immedietly obsessed with it. It sounds chrunchy and I understand how that would be a problem for some people, but I just absolutely love that aspect of it.

**SideBTrack8** (9): Really love this sound for HAIM, I just wish Cudi actually had a verse or was at least on this a bit more.

**Leixander** (10): HEY!

**OberionSynth** (10): holy shit that intro hit me before the water was clear (aka i wasn't prepared)

**pheromenos** (10): it's a bop

**ReallyCreative** (8): pretty cool that Kid Cudi has collabs with 2 artists in this rate, this feels a little of the time but it's pretty good

**endcreditouilles** (7): love the way they say "red eye", but other than that I'm not a huge fan of the production.

**plastichaxan** (7): is it just me or is the mix really off for this one? is the only thing keeping it from being very good to me

**bbfan132** (6.5): kind of feels like a mess but i like the melody in the chorus

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I like the first couple of lines in the chorus; their voices sound very good together. That's it. Nothing else interesting happens in the song. Too monotonous.

**celladonn** (3): I find the production on Indicud actively unpleasant I'm afraid

**SideBTrack8** (10): My favourite duet in the bonus rate, their voices work so well together, and the production is fantastic. I don't know who Matt Berninger is but I will definitely be checking him out.

**wavingwolves** (7): Not my favourite, but it's good. I find this to be incribly overrated in general and also in this rate. It's nothing to write home about.

**wavingwolves** (9): Yeah, this is banger breakup song, and it also features one of my favourite lines in the record: "I've been playing dead my whole life / and I get this feeling whenever I feel good / It'll be the last time". The portrayal of scepticism when it comes to good things really resonates with me. Nothing is scarier than having a good day, knowing that you'll be soon back to old ways and old feelings.

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): It's kind of funny that this song is about her drummer ex but the first thing that jumps out to me is the drumming. He also has writing credit, I wonder what it's like to help write a song that's about you but from someone else's perspective?

# Medical students

**CarlieScion** (11): I FEEL SOMETHING WHEN I SEE YOU NOW !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**mylps9** (11): i have to write a comment and i’m not good at explaining things but this is my favorite song in the rate.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A damn good beat.

**Awkward\_King** (10): P

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ‘If you’re a work of art, I’m standing too close because I can see the brushstrokes’ is one of my favorite lyrics of all time. It just puts extremely well not only finding imperfections in people you’re the closest to that people that aren’t that close don’t see, but also identifying that sometimes those imperfections come not from them, but from those who had made them who they are. I don’t know if she meant it like that, but it’s always how I took it.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I love her lyricism so much, it really elevates this album to a whole new level. The songwriting is great on this one too, and her voice carries a lot of strength and emotion here that I like.

**forgetquick** (10): So many great lines in a song about that too-familiar feeling of just not being ready to do anything. But my favorite has line has to go to "I hate your mom. I hate it when she opens her mouth." because that's truly a line you can't come back from. That relationships is dead, done, over. And the little bit where she sings "I used to light you up, now I can't even get you to play the drums" and the drums drop out is genius.

**frogaranaman** (10): I feel something (your dick) when I see you

**getin2it** (10): DON'T SLEEP ON ICU. YES THE OTHER SONGS ARE GREAT BUT THIS GUITAR AND THE LYRICS. Even my Mom laughed at "I hate your mom. I hate it when she opens her mouth."

**IIIHenryIII** (10): She hates my mom, but I don't care. I love her!

**leviswift13** (10): gets better every time i listen to it. so many of these lyrics have that perfect phoebe mix of clever bite and holy-shit-that-is-depressing. i mean, the way that bridge builds...

**nick1372** (10): I can’t get over the fact that she wrote the lyrics “I hate your mom / I hate it when she opens her mouth” and released this song to the public when it’s about her bandmate and friend!! What the fuck!!

**OberionSynth** (10): queen of getting in a fight with her ex's mom who is a trump supporter

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I also hate my mom

**steelstepladder** (10): My mom died and all I got was a free churro

**Stryxen** (10): this song has never stopped growing on me

**TiltControls** (10): I feel something, when I (hear this) now

**totallynot14\_** (10): she ate

**Uberpigeon** (10): One of the best tracks on the album, this is a banger. Amazing production, the lyrics are cutting and evocative. I fucking love this song.

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): This almost got my 11 over Moon Song, because musically, and lyrically, it's so damn cathartic. Those drums, man! I think about Phoebe's performance of this song that aired on Colbert, of her driving around recklessly and screaming, at least once every two days. "I don't know what I want until I fuck it up" is so simple yet so evocative.

**waluigiest** (10): Phoebe Bridgers, queen of the Verse 2! It’s literally the peak of all of her songs, the brush strokes/mom lyrics are bomb

**savemeaseat143** (9.8): I feel something when I listen to this song

**avg-vag** (9.5): i would like to see marshall’s mom’s rating

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Easily the best song of the second half

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Hey, aren't you the horse from horsin' around?

**bespectacIed** (9): Fun. Another great stream of consciousness song from fibby

**ManofOranges** (9): P

**slimboyfriend** (9): This song, but it's just Phoebe saying "I hate ur mom" on a loop

**survivorjdmarina** (9): I like the groovy keyboards that play throughout the song.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): "I hate your mom, I hate it when she opens her mouth'' might be one of the best lines of the entire album

**zagreux** (9): the drums.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Spell ICUP out loud…………..…EW! Well then you should look away, then! Ha ha, I got you! (I think this song is pretty underrated. That final chorus is just euphoric.)

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): “Cause I don't know what I want until I fuck it up” ouch I got read to filth

**jasannn** (8.5): 👁👄👁

**jman457** (8.5): A favorite of mine on this album

**kirby31200** (8.5): Imagine playing the drums on a song that says your mom sucks

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): love the sound but the lyrics... we can do better than this

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I feeeeeeel something, when I play this song

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8): Glad she included something with a little more tempo later on in the album

**bbfan132** (8): i like how it’s indie rock but still dreamy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This has one of the coolest instrumentals on the album.

**Vromega** (8): i like the instrumentation a lot but her voice seems a bit too "distant" at some point

**wasian-invasion** (8): i bet you cant spell ICUP

**cyborglilith** (7.9): that second verse though

# Non medical students

**1998tweety** (7): shes giving us energy, too bad demi ended ha

**conceptualromance** (7): my least fave song on the album. I just don’t think it’s as good as the rest of the tracks.

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): The instrumental here is very good, but the song overall is kinda lifeless.

**iniekcja\_** (7): it breaks the fantasy of the album for me but it's still a really good track

**llieno94** (7): a much needed pick me up towards the album’s end. Kinda reminds me of Out of The Woods, thematically. How a serious event can help put into perspective how you really feel about someone. The refrain “I feel something for you now” sounds just how you’d imagine... the music quiets down, everything but the one you love fades away in slow motion and you only see them.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): wait i was gonna tank this but it’s kinda hitting rn

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): There's something about this that doesn’t click for me and I can’t work out what it is, I feel like I should like it more than I do

**NotWith10000Men** (6): more energy is better but it's still just there

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh this is a breakup song. I don't feel bad about giving it a mid score because I find those boring but it gets some points for also being about depression.

**akanewasright** (5): ...honestly this song has never done anything for me. I feel nothing when I hear this song, you could say.

**jayjaysortagay** (5): end credit music

**proscett** (5): not a big fan of the production here, it's a little grating

**runaway3212** (4): fuck you u/akward_king

**wavingwolves** (11): Weirdly enough, I feel like in comparison with other songs I don't have that much to share about this one, even though it's my 11. I just find it to be one of the most charming and well crafted songs in the album and I love every single lyric in this and all the ideas she is able to express. And, to be honest, this also has my favouriteeee part of the whole album which is her vocal delivery on "i didn't fit in it, it was never mine" and just for that this is a 1000/10.

**SideBTrack8** (8): One of the few songs on the album that I enjoyed a bit less the more I listened, but it's still a great song. This almost feels like a sister song to Newspaper but with a very different message.

# Women

**cremeebrulee** (11): i rewrote this comment like 18 times bc i don't know if I'm coming across, but i’m really trying 🥴 but this song’s approach of the relationship between you and your ex’s new partner is so nuanced and refreshing like there’s so much here?? like the idea that there’s comradery between you two because you both are going through the same experience but also that doesn’t mean that your relationships aren’t comparable and one of you isn’t necessarily a better partner than the other and UGH its perfect its perfect especially in a landscape where most songs love to pit exes (especially when they’re both women) against each other

**akanewasright** (10): I just think that ladies-

**bbfan132** (10): ladies ladies ladies ladiessssssssss

**bespectacIed** (10): The kindness and maturity, far too much. God-tier opening verse.

**bulforster** (10): I'm glad middle aged white women now have their version of SZA's The Weekend (and also that it's so good).

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i didn't even know fruit bats needed to be reclaimed but pop off?

**CzrLandWhale** (10): Sisterhood of the travelling dress that belonged to the ex-wife of another ex of mine.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the way we are pitting women against each other and rating a song critiquing pitting women against each other. anyways….FRUIT BAT

**forgetquick** (10): The whole verse with the dress and "I don't know if I'm coming across, but I'm really trying" is amazing.

**ggal2020** (10): Fiona Apple changed the way I think about being a woman

**jayjaysortagay** (10): so true

**leviswift13** (10): not only one of the best songs on the album, but easily one of the best songs in a career full of best songs. i remember when this song full hit ~ it's packed with so much wisdom, experience, perspective, grief, loss, reflection and wit that it overwhelms. never heard a song tackle a topic like this. you won't find a more cathartic musical moment than the section talking about the dress left by the ex-wife.

**llieno94** (10): The word play on this song is relentless and never lets up. Its funny, wholesome, mature, and hopefully a preview to the type of songs ahead in Fiona’s work.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): …what is the fruit bat part??? Also, is this ironically or unironically women supporting women? Also also I love the proper use of whom

**ReallyCreative** (10): come on feminism!!

**rosecoloreds** (10): ended misogyny

**sarcasticsobs** (10): [clenches fists] women

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Popheads when asked who they listen to

**skargardin** (10): ladies ladies ladies ladies

**steelstepladder** (10): me when I walk into a lesbian bar

**Stryxen** (10): it was an arbitrary choice to choose my other 11 contender over this - when i first heard the chorus of this i had an entire spiritual awakening at 1am

**survivorjdmarina** (10): The theme is pretty sentimental, although I can’t really speak on it from my perspective. I do love the "ladies, ladies, ladies, ladies" refrain, and the arrangement too.

**waluigiest** (10): Every time I hear this song, I discover something new. It’s somehow both lyrically dense and unpretentious. It’s beautiful and reflective and mature and the verse about the dress in the closet is one of the highlights of the album.

**xcjm** (10): ladies INDEED

**zagreux** (10): feminist bop.

**kirby31200** (9.5): Girl power!

**welcometoNY** (9.5): i adore everything about this; the "you'd look good in it" part in particular is very special

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): stream ladies code

**celladonn** (9): Love the message of this

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This is a great track! I love the percussion and the bassline. It sounds so classy and has such a nice mood.

**notoriouspge** (9): Fiona saying "ladies" united the world

**proscett** (9): ladies indeed.

**seanderlust** (9): LADIES, LADIES, LADIES, LADIES

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (9): Fiona have you thought that the reason you can't get through to other women on your views about cheating is because you're wrong?

**Uberpigeon** (9): ladies ladies ladies ladies ladies! This song has such a different vibe to the others, almost like the calm in the eye of the storm of this album. It doesn't stand out much on its own per se, but the album wouldn't be the same without it. Ladies ladies ladies ladies ladies take it easy!

**plastichaxan** (8.8): laid ease laid ease laid ease

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): fiona apple maya rudolph besties headcanon <3

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i originally gave this a 7 but it’s really grown on me

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): feels very ad-hoc, but in the end it comes together well

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): Ladies, Ladies, Ladies, and I can't stress it enough, Ladies

**jman457** (8.4): I love how this has an open mic at a local coffee shop feel.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8): I don't think I've ever heard a song about this before?

**CarlieScion** (8): the way she sings the word ladies reaches a crease of my brain in a way that gives me tingles

**OberionSynth** (8): i could go on for days about society pitting women against each other, but this song sums it up pretty well

**SmileAndTears** (8): The best song on the album I guess xd

# M*n

**1998tweety** (7.5): the song is cute but the chorus kinda drags it down a bit

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Don't @ me, but this is really overrated. Cute message and soul influences but it's more of a speech than a song. Reminds me of a Tidal filler track.

**Turpamutteri** (7.5): I can't listen to this song because then I will just hear "ladies, ladies, ladies" in my head for the next few days straight

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Love the use of “whom” in this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Ladies, ladies, ladies...can we cut a minute off this song?

**runaway3212** (7): sorry im more into men

**vayyiqra** (7): *–]RuizaP 14 points 1 year ago* What's your favorite animal ? *[–]fionaappleofficial[S] 43 points 1 year ago* fruit bat!

**shhhneak** (6): slams table Ladies ladies LADIES

**team\_kockroach** (6): I know a lot of people love this...but it feels like such a drag

**Vromega** (6): I really can't connect to this song at all. There are some interesting elements but overall I just don't feel anything

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (0): It's funny, going into this record I fully expected to give this song something higher. From prior listens I remembered enjoying the instrumental at the very least. But then it started and just, wow the repetitive "ladies ladies ladies" just grates on me. Far more annoying than I remembered it being. And that's a general thing for me in music, off the top of my head I can think of more songs than not that bug me due to that little lyrical quirk. And I think existing in the Tik Tok era it has become more annoying than ever.

**SideBTrack8** (10): I'm still in disbelief that this only placed 15th?? It's such a beautiful song, and it was such a great first taste of one of my favourite albums of all time. I love that they went all in with the Walk On The Wild Side influence, it adds so much to the song. I also love that the album starts and ends with a sax solo.

**wavingwolves** (10): I'm sorry, there has to be a mistake... how is this not top 10? Did we hear to the same song? I don't think we did, or else it would not be DAY TWO?? Well, enough complaining, I just love this soooo much and it has such a perfect breezy summery feel to it, it's the warmest song in the whole rate. It really just makes me want to go out and walk around the suburbs while listening to this on repeat. For some reason I love hearing Danielle's "walk beside me, not behind me" so much I usually go back each time so I can listen to her saying it again.

**savemeaseat143** (11): the sax! feels like summer

**skargardin** (11): its the sax, the echoing vocals, the insanely catchy chorus and the overall summer vibes for me!! they snapped honestly

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): The clit of the album. (I'm sorry, kappy, I will never let go of that Betray My Heart comment)

**endcreditouilles** (10): I love this. Absolutely love. Great balance in production and I love the blend of jazzy/folk/rock/country/pop elements throughout. The vocals are sweet, clear, and present-feeling as well. This song is such vibes.

**hunnybee12** (10): perfect song

**leviswift13** (10): "i need you to understand these are the earthquake drills that we ran. under the freeway overpasses, the tears behind your dark sunglasses, the fears inside your heart's deepest gashes. walk beside me, not behind me. feel my unconditional love." yeah.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): it has the best bridge on the album and that's saying something bc this album is stacked with great bridges

**Vromega** (10): Instantly fell in love the first time I heard this song. Still my favorite on this album

**waluigiest** (10): the sax hook with the bari in its highest register (especially in the bridge) is everything. I just listened to the Song Exploder episode about this song and have just that much more love for it

**wasian-invasion** (10): why tf was this not on the standard edition

**xcjm** (10): justice for Summer Girl!!!!!! I like to think that she was relegated to a bonus track the same way sitcoms introduce special guest stars by giving them the "featuring" credit. or "with". Women in Music Part III. featuring Summer Girl

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): :wig:

**zagreux** (9.7): omg the horns here

**totallynot14\_** (9.5): summer 2019 was a vibe

**steelstepladder** (9.2): This album needed more sax

**bespectacIed** (9): i love the simplicity of it. Haim was all about that bass

**cremeebrulee** (9): starting and ending ur album with a sax ….. their minds

**CrimsonROSET** (9): well it’s winter so fuck off my property

**CzrLandWhale** (9): That sax is everything.

**Leixander** (9): used to hate this but it grew on me a lot

**notoriouspge** (9): should have been on the official release part 2/2

**NotWith10000Men** (9): I cannot hear a brass instrument without making a stank face. They really saved the best two songs for last huh?

**conceptualromance** (8.5): just what it says on the tin - a summery, breezy song

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): bumping it for the refrain

**jman457** (8.2): a great little closer to this album

**team\_kockroach** (8.2): I’m a sax hoe

**akanewasright** (8): The bonus tracks aren’t really part of the album, but my god they’re so good, and this works so well as an album closer.

**cyborglilith** (8): damn

**IIIHenryIII** (8): The saxophone is so relaxing. I love it!

**RandomHypnotica** (8): "Walk beside me, not behind me" - Danielle to Alana and Este when they're filming a music video

**seanderlust** (8): "walk beside me, not behind me" - me when I fart

**jasannn** (7.5): I like how it flows nicely back to Los Angeles when you repeat the album.

# White Walkers

**proscett** (7.5): love this sonically, but doesn't really feel right at the closer

**flavasavavandal** (7): I’m always a bit of sucker for some easy-going pop that incorporates saxophones, even if the saxophone and the song don’t really go anywhere. Maybe the song where the summery haze works the best, even if the (I’m just assuming because they sound fake) fake drums are a tad too loud

**llieno94** (7): a hazy, mellow, fun song that lets the record peter out on a light note.

**runaway3212** (7): overrated

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's the least memorable of the bonus tracks but it's still decent, I especially like the saxophone.

**vayyiqra** (7): I wouldn't like this that much but I love Ariel Rechtshaid and he was a big influence on me musically and just seems like a really cool and likeable guy so it fucked me up a bit to find out he had cancer and I'm glad he is okay now.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): :/

**OberionSynth** (6): this is literally just elevator music

**fadedblue09** (4): I'm not sure why this is so liked? This is just Los Angeles minus the interesting lyrics. Very flat vocals and boring, repetitive lyrics, redeemed mostly by the sax.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): This song doesn't have a chorus.

**wavingwolves** (10): Oof. This not even getting to Day 3? Yeah, it feels wrong. Every single layer of this feels sooo well crafted and well though-tout. Probably the best opening song in the whole rate and one of my favourite songs in this album.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): Having a love-hate relationship with your hometown while also knowing you're never gonna leave is such a mood. The sax opening is perfection.

---

**1998tweety** (11): this feels so summery wtf I love it

**just\_thonking** (11): IKTE is gonna win anyways so I'm giving this my 11 instead. This song is just such a moving cry of despair and desperation, of feeling restless and stuck and lost. The lyrics are so evocative -- "These days I can't see no visions" gets me every time -- and I love the instrumentals so much.

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**fadedblue09** (10): The album standout for me. Very memorable, and I really love it when artists dedicate a whole song to their home city, or any place for that matter. And compared to the other songs on the album, this one actually felt like it was telling a story.

**ggal2020** (10): I’m not from LA (I hate it there) but this song reminds me of my hometown and it makes me tear up a little because of how much I love my home

**hunnybee12** (10): the sax makes this

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Perfect intro. Right in the beginning we already have a taste of what the album is going to sound like. All the instruments sound so good together. I am not much for dancing, but I can't control my body when this starts playing.

**jasannn** (10): I'm not sure its because I love my home state of California but this is oddly my favorite song off the album. It's just so summery and it feels like home (even though I'm from Northern California instead of South California.)

**leviswift13** (10): so close to my 11. one of the best album openers of the past few years. captures the complex relationship one has with one's hometown perfectly. there is added weight when taking into consideration how important la has been to haim's identity. "i'm breaking, losing faith. these days. these days."

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): they really put the best song on this album first in the tracklist

**notoriouspge** (10): My east coast ass is buying a plane ticket now

**ReallyCreative** (10): that saxophone lick to start the album, they knew what they were doing

**skargardin** (10): when the yasssgrenade pops at the outro i ascend

**Turpamutteri** (10): this sounds like a warm summer afternoon

**xcjm** (10): I've never been to LA but goddamn if this song doesn't make me agree that it's the best city in the world

**zagreux** (10): "I can't win" holy fuck they didn't have to come for me like that

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): NOPE

**rosecult** (9.5): West Coast best coast!

**steelstepladder** (9.5): Any album that opens with a sax is gonna be good

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): such an exciting opener tbh

**savemeaseat143** (9.4): I tried the winter there once. NOPE

**akanewasright** (9): This is just... so well done in every way.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): the word "vibes" has been ruined but still - the VIBES on this song. I'm immediately walking down the beach in LA living out my hot girl summer fantasies.

**bulforster** (9): Love the backing vocals on this one.

**conceptualromance** (9): west coast best coast, as they say

**CzrLandWhale** (9): Reminds me of driving my drop-top convertible through Malibu in the summer of '98, except I don't own a drop-top, I've never been to California, and I definitely wasn't alive in 1998.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): I trust belb to not play the St. Vincent song after this.

**ManofOranges** (9): Yup yup yup

**runaway3212** (9): NY overrated so true

**Stryxen** (9): i have one very nice memory of this song walking through my city after house hunting for my second year and just finally feeling at home

**survivorjdmarina** (9): The intro is funky. "I tried the winter there once, nope!"

**waluigiest** (9): Rostam had his paws all over this album and I LOVE that

**wasian-invasion** (9): aw wow this song actually makes me miss living in LA

**shhhneak** (8.7): if there’s a saxophone intro you just know the album is going to serve.

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the ska influence quite a bit

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): the “NOPE” sends

**nick1372** (8.5): saxophone… dissatisfaction with los angeles… how could this song not speak to me on a spiritual level

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): first haim song I've ever listened to. I dig it. they sound great and harmonize well

**jman457** (8.3): Such an easy breasy vibe

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8): Nice opener for sure. Love the sax as the first thing you hear on this album.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): American cities are so oddly significant.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I never have experienced a New York Winter and I never want to. Nope.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i’m sure people from LA have much of more of a connection to this, but I’ve never been there so bop I guess?

**forgetquick** (8): Solid opener that sets the vibe of the whole album. And the little "nope" re: NY winters is great.

**jayjaysortagay** (8): very cute but a bit generic

**kappyko** (8): starts skanking

**NecroDolphinn** (8): Los Ageless outsold

**OberionSynth** (8): this is everything "welcome to new york" wanted to be

**static\_int\_husp** (8): the guitar line through this is definitely very interesting

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Really cute opener

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): if you think NYC is cold, wait until you get to Canada

**kirby31200** (7.5): God knows we didn't have enough songs about LA

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): this song is simultaneously corny, nostalgic, and hilarious. great opening track to WIMPIII

**bespectacIed** (7): fun

**llieno94** (7): a funny and touching love/hate letter to the city

**Quiet-Tone13** (7): It's a perfectly nice song that sets the tone for the album nicely, and I love the vocal flutter on "losing faith", but it isn't interesting enough to rate higher

**vayyiqra** (7): "I tried the winter there once, nope" so true @ Canada

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6.5): Los Angeles sucks but the song is cute

**Uberpigeon** (6): its cute I like the outtro

**proscett** (5): a weak opener, but the 'i spent a winter [in new york]... nope' is so funny

team_kockroach: I love Chinese Satellite a lot. I think the production is probably the best on the album (maybe I Know the End has better production...they're basically tied), especially when the drums kick in on the pre-chorus. I think Phoebe belting out the chorus was one of the most desperate, saddest things I've witnessed in 2020.   


Most of all, I think the lyrics about feeling hopeless are heartfelt, accurate, and raw.
