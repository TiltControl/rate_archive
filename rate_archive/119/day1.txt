2020 Pitchfork Acclaim Rate Reveal Day 1: You wrote me a ballot, but I don't have to read it
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ncg8bp/2020_pitchfork_acclaim_rate_reveal_day_1_you/

# Hello, people in need of therapy! 

[Welcome](https://data.junkee.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/fionaaaa.png) to the first day of Fetch The Punishers Pt. III a.k.a. 2020 Ultimate Pitchfork Acclaim! We hope you're ready to have get mildly passive aggressive at other people for giving low scores to the songs you've been weirdly emotionally attached to since last year. 

Today we'll be revealing songs placing at **#40-#27** in the main rate and **#17-#12** in the bonus rate! 

**We'll be starting at 4pm EST**, so an hour from now. Be ready!

**Joins u/SideBTrack8 on the [BeatSense](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj?ref=beatster&u=D17894700fb3E) room**, where all the eliminated songs will be played followed by a few intermissions and shitposts.

**Make sure to keep this thread open as well!** I will be unveiling your comments and scores for each of the songs as they go out.

#Cinephiles 

**1998tweety** (10): idk why i find this so good but it just is. like it has this weird energy of me being outside at the place pictured on the cover; and im all alone and its dark and im looking around and see things flicker in the corner of my eye but nothings there and its a whole anxiety-inducing situation. NEways its kinda sad she started so song with this album and then fell off :shrug:

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Really sets the tone for the album

**Alumineous** (10): At this point, all interlude-adjacent songs are getting 10s from me.

**bespectacIed** (10): early out but i payola'd because this transitions to garden song flawwwlessly

**Brendon-Urine** (10): this feels like a part of Garden Song to me so I'm rating them the same, but regardless this is super nice.

**EnCaine** (10): i swear this score is not a shitpost 😭 the combination of the aesthetic of this song + the title does a lot for me. Some of my biggest childhood nostalgia is from title menu music on DVDs i would fall asleep to or stuff like the save screen music in resident evil 4 - the most important one was the gamecube menu music which is really unsettling but also super calming?? and that's how this song feels to me. It captures such a niche thing that I have very strong emotions about and I have to love it

**endcreditouilles** (10): Haunting, gorgeous composition. I love this title too, especially for an instrumental intro. Such an artistic piece and deftly done, could 100% see it in a film.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This is literally 100x better than any actual song out there. It sounds so haunting and ominous. It sets the vibe of the album very well.

**iniekcja\_** (10): I absolutely love it and if it ranks low I'm gonna be pissed

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): when this has a tina taught me-esque run omggg

**pheromenos** (10): i love a good foreshadowing

**proscett** (10): best song on this rotten album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is literally just an intro to Garden Song, so I'm giving it the same score because it deserves honestly

**rickikardashian** (10): interlude solidarity

**runaway3212** (10): lovely

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This is what I imagine a spooky premonition would sound like. I’m obsessed with how this gives the listener a preview of I Know the End’s ending, ensuring that we WILL know the end (and making the album infinitely loopable), Phoebe’s mind!!!

**jman457** (9.4): I love this intro, slut for a good strings

**flavasavavandal** (9): I think it says a lot about how much Phoebe’s voice is just not for me that I’m giving the opening instrumental one of the highest scores on Punisher

**nick1372** (9): so pleasant to listen to

**Stryxen** (9): it serves the album well and this was my album average

**survivorjdmarina** (9): A nice intro!

**just\_thonking** (8.8): it always bothers me when these short intro/interlude tracks are included in the rate because I can't in good faith rate them very high, but I also don't want to lower the average of the album. I guess I feel that this track slightly improves the overall album experience, so I'll rate it slightly above my album average

**AquariusTeaSpilled** (8): I love a good intro track

**bookthieving** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QOtuX0jL85Y

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): atmosphere!

**CzrLandWhale** (8): I like to think that when Garden Song starts that's when the DVD logo hits the corner of the screen.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Oh...?

**kirby31200** (8): How do I select special features? I want to see if this album has any TV remote games

**OberionSynth** (8): coming back to this after i listened to the album, it's a nice little intro the rest of the album. unfortunately i do not listen to instrumentals bc i tend to think during them and i take 10 psychic damage per thought, so i will not be coming back to this song

**thedoctordances1940** (8): This is ultimately going to suffer from short-instrumental-intro-phobia and go out first but I really don't think it deserves that. It sets the tone beautifully and the album would definitely be worse off without it.

**Uberpigeon** (8): It's a great moody opener and flows into garden song really nicely

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's cute and it's a cool foreshadowing for the closer, but to be honest, I'm not sure this is a great intro to the album

**steelstepladder** (7.4): A fine opener. Can't wait to see it go first.

**cremeebrulee** (7): she’s spitting here

**ignitethephoenix** (7): honestly this is way better that I was expecting for an intro reminds me of game of thrones for some reason

**jasannn** (7): It serves its purpose.

**leviswift13** (7): invented dvd menus

**llieno94** (7): conceptually love this, the DVD menu always picks the perfect section of the score to set the mood for the feature, and this little intro does that.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the violin is so spooky

**sarcasticsobs** (7): strings, baybeeee

#Cinephobes

**slimboyfriend** (7): Isn't it kinda just an intro

**pat-rickstar** (6): It's a really nice intro that transitions well into the the next song but after Tina Taught Me I can't be too nice to it

**savemeaseat143** (6): I would not listen to it on its own

**shesdoingyoga** (6): Mentioning DVDs in a song title? Dated on release.

**skargardin** (6): it's a nice intro

**static\_int\_husp** (6): I'm interludephobic

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): Well, it's an intro.

**vayyiqra** (6): Nice and moody but too short to rate properly.

**Vromega** (6): it's very good honestly but it doesn't fit the vibe of this album at all

**wasian-invasion** (6): Feels like I'm underwater at 2 am

**bigbigbee** (5.5): It’s not that it’s an instrumental. It’s that it’s an instrumental that I don’t really like. I’ll still give it an above average score because it’s an interesting way to open the album.

**martian\_pet** (5.5): I'm indifferent about this one sometimes i start the album with Garden Song

**team\_kockroach** (5.2): I’m guessing that everyone else’s average score will round out to 5.2.

**bbfan132** (5): pointless intro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is a beautiful, atmospheric intro but it's just an intro.

**CarlieScion** (5): how does one even rate this

**conceptualromance** (5): it’s an intro

**CrimsonROSET** (5): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand DVD Menu. The sadness is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical music theory most of the melodies will go over a typical listener's head. There's also Phoebe's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her lyricism - her personal philosophy draws heavily from tumblr literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual cap

**ElizabethDDoS** (5): Tina Taught Me what to do with pretty interludes.

**fadedblue09** (5): Very ominous and atmospheric.

**forgetquick** (5): It's fine and all, but Garden Song would have been a perfectly good opener and mood-setter so it's unnecessary.

**frogaranaman** (5): this is so me whenever I open up a DVD menu while getting dick

**hunnybee12** (5): i see how the album needed something before garden song but why couldn't it have been something interesting

**musical\_pyn** (5): I'm not interludephobic I just believe that interludes shouldn't win rates

**SmileAndTears** (5): why does this exist (Yes I know it's kind of a preview of I Know The End but like... why?)

**totallynot14\_** (5): pheobe sounds so good here omg i love her vocal delivery

**waluigiest** (5): it’s not bad it kind of just is

**Awkward\_King** (4): i love the ambience of it and its very pretty but if tina taught me one thing its that interludes cant be fucking trusted

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (3): Yeah sure, okay

**plastichaxan** (3): ??

**TiltControls** (3): its one benefit is bringing down my album average to make me seem less biased

**CritneySpearz** (1): what's the point..

**akanewasright** (0): Listen. After watching “Tina Told Me” beat out 90% of D’Angelo’s Black Messiah in the BCC rate, I now consider myself an out and proud interlude-phobe. I will not fucking let this track beat For Her. I know that plenty of people are probably already on the job, but I don’t fucking care. This is fine, but it is the worst song in the rate by virtue of it barely being a song

**jayjaysortagay** (0): something has to go firdt and hopefully it will be this

**ktajlili** (0): not really a song

**NecroDolphinn** (0): just an interlude. Nothing special

**notoriouspge** (0): Forgive me, Mistress Phoebe, one had to fall so the others could live

**quinnpsych** (0): love the vibe it brings but would never listen to it

**Tedyonce** (0): lol

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (0): sorry Phoebe :-(

**wavingwolves** (9): This was a MASSIVE grower for me and for that it hurts to see it as the first actual song to go. At first it was not that much of a standout song, but then it hit me one day. It feels unique for them, while still being one of the songs where they're using their inspirations on their sleeve for their own benefit. It works wonderfully, I don't care if it's placed at the bottom, I just think you're all wrong about it.

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): I'm really sad this is the first real song out, but I kind of get it. I appreciate that they worked in actual things said to them by interviewers, but it can feel a bit clunky. It's disgusting that they've had to go through shit like this, and this obviously isn't an isolated issue.

#DAE Joni Mitch-

**engifear** (9): This reminds me of Joni Mitchell and I love it

**CzrLandWhale** (10): Why do men

**Leixander** (10): but you don't know how it feels

**leviswift13** (10): joni mitchell ghostwrote

**totallynot14\_** (10): get his ass

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): This is a cute ballad. Don’t understand why people don’t like it.

**llieno94** (9): a quietly seething composition that never lets up as it critiques of music journalism, specifically the sexism women in rock face.

**runaway3212** (9): my dad was once on the cover of a magazine and all of our neighbours came to celebrate him and it was honestly a great time

**Stryxen** (9): me when i mishear the man from the magazine

**waluigiest** (9): the music store anecdote is powerful

**bbfan132** (8.5): great song, powerful lyrics and i like how it practically sounds live

**pheromenos** (8.3): 'to be the cunt' had me gasp, wtf was that lol

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.2): HAIM ended misogyny in the music industry.

**bespectacIed** (8): bopppp

**celladonn** (8): Not my favourite sonically but the lyrics are great

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): It's quite underrated, but also not really above an 8.

**notoriouspge** (8): alright ladies you won me back from those last two songs to serve the tea

**OberionSynth** (8): i will vibe with any song that tells society to fuck off

**seanderlust** (8): 2020's least expected c-bomb

**xcjm** (8): Joni's coming to collect her cheques

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.8): I ended misogyny in music journalism by giving this above a 7.7

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.6): love the lyrics but the music is just whatever

**CarlieScion** (7.5): the intro really sounded like Hayley Williams

**nick1372** (7.5): I think this one suffers from being a bit too acoustic

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I love the melody of the "it is what it is" part but it's too short

#Gave Boys Will Be Boys a 0 

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): ended misogyny

**ReallyCreative** (7): I love the message of this song but it's way too sleepy, there's just not a lot going on

**jman457** (6.6): a lil basic but fun

**AHSWeeknd** (6): That last line is great

**iniekcja\_** (6): I forgot how it sounded midway through the next song

**shesdoingyoga** (6): I genuinely think I zoned out and had to go back and listen to it again, I’m just bored at this point and it’s starting to impact my scores when these songs would probably be better on their own

**wasian-invasion** (6): tw: m*n

**akanewasright** (5.6): Idk this song is good? But it doesn’t stand out that much

**fadedblue09** (5): Almost feels like an interlude

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I have mixed feelings about this one. It's usually a skip.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): feels fairly derivative of similar "conversations", I feel like they could have done it better

**Awkward\_King** (4): this reminds me of something

**CrimsonROSET** (4): This is just nothing. It’s hot air in music form. It doesn’t do anything other than extend the runtime by… two minutes.

**thedoctordances1940** (4): I think the big problem I have with this song is the guitar, it's got a really strange tone to it that I just don't like at all and an alright vocal performance can't save that.

**conceptualromance** (3): I feel bad for not liking this very much. I think the lyrics are good, but everything else about this song irritates me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Sounds like an interlude and also kind of like it was recorded in a dumpster.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): I love the shouty delivery of the first two verses so much, it's impossible to not sing along. The delivery throughout makes the song feel almost happy and hopeful, but the actual lyrics... not so much. I had no idea this song was so controversial, this being their second song out is inexcusable.

**wavingwolves** (9): This one hurts me. I love this song and I have to say I find it to be extremely underrated by most of you, be ashamed. This was one of my quarantine anthems and a song I would go back to a lot in moments where I needed comfort and understanding from something other than texts from the friends that are so away from me. I just feel like it describes so perfectly the experience of the first few months of lockdown where I just feel weighted by everything around me. Besides that, it's also just catchy and has such interesting details and new elements being introduced till the end of it.

#People who need therapy and a hug


**Awkward\_King** (10): felt

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Installed tiktok because of this.

**rosecult** (10): underrated

**waluigiest** (10): It’s a beautiful song about depressive experiences, and I love the writing: “love of my life sleeping by my side / but I’m still down.” Bonus points for some wonderful Rostam background vocals

**forgetquick** (9.5): The "well I've been feeling pretty foolish" bit keeps me coming back to this song.

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): bitch me too the fuck

**CrimsonROSET** (9): saying you don’t have a clear identity isn’t doing you any favors to the tracks you’ve shown off

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Oh I just know this song pops off live.

**endcreditouilles** (9): I love the shouty, belt-friendly vocals contrasted with the soft low vocals, it feels warm and encompassing. The production is very spacious on this one too, it gives it kind of a live performance feel.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This song is criminally short.

**leviswift13** (9): this song is brutal. to anyone who can relate it just hits ... hard. it perfectly captures the desperation of a mental breakdown.

**rosecoloreds** (9): i don't care what anyone says it slaps

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.9): I’m down bad so true

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like this!!! relatable yet comfortable

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): Love the chorus.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): It feels like there's a bit of a clash between the guitar and vocal melody but it somehow works really well I think

**conceptualromance** (8): I really like the kick drum on this one

**flavasavavandal** (8): Danielle’s delivery and some pretty potent lyricism make this song great

**llieno94** (8): a much needed pick me up in the records second half. The sisters harmonies are on best display here.

**runaway3212** (8): sure

**skargardin** (8): self isolation anthem yass

**xcjm** (8): very relatable girlies

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**jasannn** (7.5): Me all quarter long.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I love when they chase their Sheryl Crow fantasy

**Stryxen** (7.5): IT’S BEEN MAKING ME FEEL CREEPY

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): I don’t think the talk-singing works that well but the rest of the song is nice

**jman457** (7.2): we love a happy sounding sad bop

**AHSWeeknd** (7): The house from UP can’t relate.

**iniekcja\_** (7): I really want to like it more...

**ktajlili** (7): there are no stupid questions, just stupid people

**OberionSynth** (7): "tik tok, killing time" same girl it's an addiction at this point

**shesdoingyoga** (7): Scuba divers after resurfacing

#Cardi B, probably 

**notoriouspge** (6.5): nice bass but otherwise not as good as the first half of the album

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (6): This album is a *little* long for me. I'd cut this.

**bigbigbee** (6): I GET it. Is it also Halloween, and can we be anything? And YES before you ask, I do like songs like Forever or Big and Chunky. This song is no Forever. And it’s DEFINITELY no Big and Chunky.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is relatable but not the best depression anthem on the album.

**CarlieScion** (6): down bad

**hunnybee12** (6): the bridge barely saves the terrible chorus

**jayjaysortagay** (6): what direction have they been? I didn't quite get it

**NotWith10000Men** (6): people I've been sad is way better

**plastichaxan** (6): me when i first listened to the album

**proscett** (6): greatest song of all time

**static\_int\_husp** (6): I've listen to this album multiple times at this point, and going back to write comments, I do not remember this song at all

**vayyiqra** (6): same bestie

**steelstepladder** (5): Kind of the lul in the album imo...

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.3): title suits the song

**fadedblue09** (4): Wow what a lame chorus. Points for some relatable lyrics even though the song as a whole is so bland lyrically.

**kappyko** (4): i hate the drums here idk sometimes i think i might just have shit taste in drum sounds but it is so arghhhhhh

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): worst song on this album by a mile

**mudkip1** (2): definitely the lowest part of the album for me

**BoneStreetSand** (0): I feel like the lyrics of this song are just describing how you feel after you listen to this song.

**SideBTrack8** (9): While a lot of the album is repetitive this song takes the cake, so I'm not surprised it's Fiona's first song out. Even though I know she's just repeating the same thing over and over again for most of the song I usually don’t even notice.

**wavingwolves** (8): This was from the get go the lowest placement had in this rate. It was for a while below DVD Menu even, which tells me enough about what y'all think of it. I agree it's the weakest song in the album, but it's still marvelous. The best part of it is the story behind it, though, as Fiona tells it: "This was my version of the Vipassana chant that I sang in jail. I sang it during the night just to calm myself down. When we were all in the waiting room, there was a camera and I was stupidly, defiantly, singing towards the camera. It’s not a good idea to have any sarcasm or personality at all when you’re dealing with cops. Just politeness and, “Okay, sir.” As much as it fucking hurts to do it, that’s the lesson."

#People who only move to move

**AHSWeeknd** (10): An insane closer.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i do not have synesthesia but this song is such a rich purple i am in love with it

**bbfan132** (10): love how it sounds like a chant, perfect outro

**bespectacIed** (10): Perfect album ending, very mitski 'a burning hill' passive acceptance of life sucking balls and just living like a programmed robot. Mood forever

**iniekcja\_** (10): ENERGY

**kappyko** (10): various dancing gifs

**steelstepladder** (10): A perfect closer. Genuinely deserves more love.

**zagreux** (10): ah, fuck, shit

**akanewasright** (9): Perfect song to close the record.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): queen of going on and only moving to move

**runaway3212** (9): 'I only move to move' me when I've already lost a chess game but I dont wanna resign yet

**skargardin** (9): this is such an amazing closer

**survivorjdmarina** (9): Solid closer on an amazing album. Mwah!

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Me having a nervous breakdown before a major exam

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I was stunned to find out this was one of everyone’s least faves...and then I read the lyrics and I realized that this was just one line again and again lol. But I don’t mind, it’s catchy and it ends the album on an ominous yet resolved note.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Kinda harsh, but adds to it really well

**leviswift13** (8): can't listen to it out of context, but it ties up the threads of the album really beautifully.

**llieno94** (8): Fiona chants away her worries in this meditative percussion driven final track. It takes all the emotional turbulence of the previous 12 songs and releases them into the ether, making her and us better for it.

**shesdoingyoga** (8): Kind of a weird choice for a closing track but I don’t know what else I would have used for one

**Stryxen** (8): i feel like this will be me one day and I’ll regret not giving this an 11 but right now i’m pre my on i go era

**waluigiest** (8): the album starts and ends with songs about the long run….. okay Lorde let em talk the house down boots

**xcjm** (8): Jailhouse rock for the art crowd

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): I love the mantra at the core of this song, but how much I enjoy the frantic repetition absolutely depends on my mood. It either irritates me or makes me go “yes gawd what a BANGER!”

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I can’t say that this is my favorite song on the album, not even close, but I really love how it’s used as a closer; the driving rhythm and repetition gives this song so much forward motion. It feels like looking straight ahead, which is a great way to end an album that is so much about introspection and catharsis.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): It's fine but it's a pretty meh closer for such an incredible album

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): an awesome closing track and Fiona messing up the lyrics mid-track and keeping it in is so iconic


#🧍

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7): I like the sentiment, but it is not a song I return to often.

**CarlieScion** (7): cute but very repetitive and exhausting

**cremeebrulee** (7): “But now I only move to move” me in quarantine like

**CrimsonROSET** (7): ‘aw, fuck, shit’

**endcreditouilles** (7): very rock n roll, but I'm feeling pretty weary with this percussion/vocal style. It feels lacking, like it's fizzled off from tracks 9-11. I like the string interjections; I wish there was more of that to give it more texture, right now it feels washy.

**flavasavavandal** (7): Kind of a weak ending but not bad

**OberionSynth** (7): not as memorable as the other songs on the album, but it does close the album well imo

**proscett** (7): chaotic evil hot knife

**jman457** (6.6): for album that starts so strong its ending is kind of weak

**1998tweety** (6.5): go on girl give us nothing, the production hits a bit tho

**celladonn** (6): A bit of an underwhelming closer but it works

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I love how messy it sounds. The percussion is once again so amazing (I don't know how many times I've said that). However, I still have mixed feelings about it. I kinda want to like it so bad, though.

**rosecoloreds** (6): i'm sorry fiona but wtf was that

**Uberpigeon** (6): Now I only move to move

**vayyiqra** (6): What the fuck Fiona Apple was in jail once oh it was drugs well they should legalize them!!!

**wasian-invasion** (6): I think this just suffers from fatigue due to being the last song

**ignitethephoenix** (5): oh we are going to end on a percussion CD sounding track...well I enjoyed the previous songs a lots not sure how I feel about this being the ending

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): I disagree with Pitchfork's perfect 10 because the last two songs of the album come off like an afterthought. Such a great project deserved to finish with a bang instead of a whisper.

**just\_thonking** (4.5): honestly I find it kind of annoying

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): ...onto the next album.

**Vromega** (4): Dissonances + only percussions and bass + speaking voice. This song combines every elements I don't like on this album. I have to skip

**NotWith10000Men** (2.5): I think this is self-explanatory

**UrbanisminEgypt** (0): On I Go is like nothing Fiona Apple has done before; in the sense that she usually makes really good music and this is awful.

**waluigiest** (8): she can, against all odds, do any genre. It needs to be 3 times as long

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): While it's not one of my favourites on the album I really appreciate how unique the production is. There's so many little things throughout the song that add so much, adding and removing instruments, and sprinkling random sounds throughout.

**wavingwolves** (7): This was pretty much from the get go one of the lowest rated HAIM songs, and I do understand why because it's no favourite of mine, but I still find it very interesting and unique. My biggest problem with it is that it feels too subdued and drowned out and I wish it really went for it.

**j1ndoshb** (11): The production is flawless, I love the vulnerable lyrics , Danielle’s vocal performance is beautiful and that outro is phenomenal

**AHSWeeknd** (10): What a chill bop

**bespectacIed** (10): That mariachi band at the end is genius, for a long time this was my 2nd fave song on the album solely cuz of that. Such a great detail, it made the song more summery than it already is

**TiltControls** (10): underrated, but one of the best on the album

**shhhneak** (9): They really got me crying during a trumpet outro.

**waluigiest** (9): from a sound POV it’s so similar to a lot of Rostam’s solo album. And it’s so fun

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I kind of hated this at first but then I couldn’t get it out of my head, and now I’ve come to really like it. I love the melody on that first verse.

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): I was in the middle of typing up a comment about how the songs on this album have all been good but generally a bit boring to me but then the way this one switches up at the end changed my mind

**cremeebrulee** (8): those ending horns are so euphoric

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this album, convincing me to give it another try by introducing new elements it’ll never incorporate into another song

**endcreditouilles** (8): Love the smoothness of the production, very vibey, I wanna chill on the beach listening to this. But it gets away from me towards the end; I love the brass but the production becomes all punchy and weirdly balanced, it takes me out of it.

**steelstepladder** (8): I saw the sign, and it opened up my mind

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): such a great summery song and the bridge is so nostalgic-sounding

**iniekcja\_** (7.7): they had me until the first hook, not gonna lie

**bbfan132** (7.5): didn’t care for it too much at first but by the end, it gets better

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the changeup near the end with the horns is cool

**jman457** (7.4): love the ska sounds and horns

#This person, in special, would go back to their ex but it doesn't mean they should

**OberionSynth** (7): maybe i should text my ex after all

#Already seeing a new person

**fadedblue09** (7): This is...literally just a rehash of Don't Wanna (and nowhere near as good).

**leviswift13** (7): the verses have never gelled for me, but that chorus is so glimmering

**static\_int\_husp** (7): hawaiian luau type beat

**totallynot14\_** (7): I skipped this song halfway through but then remembered I was doing a rate, it's cute even if I won't be giving this song another try -- edit: the last minute of the song barely saved it from being my 0, they had to think of something quick for the final chorus to save their Pitchfork rating

**vayyiqra** (7): I am glad I am giving this album another try because I found it really boring the first time! now it's not bad!

**xcjm** (7): I LOVE how left field the bridge feels. Like ok....!

**Stryxen** (6.5): slight snooze compared to the rest

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): is this supposed to be caribbean? hmm

**CarlieScion** (6): this sounds weirdly tropical compared to the rest of the album

**llieno94** (6): love hearing Este kill it on the bass in this song. The bridge, brass inclusion and beachy sounding chorus are the strongest parts of this song, but one of the weaker spots on the album.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the second half of this album.. :grinny:

**skargardin** (6): This isn't a favourite of mine but it's nice enough

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): More reggae influence, it surprisingly didn’t completely ruin Gasoline and it doesn’t really ruin Another Try either, but this is a very unexciting song

**akanewasright** (5.4): This is cute? But like... I don’t know, it just doesn’t hit the standard of the other songs in the rate

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5): words can't convey how much I hate the mixing.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I almost made this my only song without a comment. That pretty much sums up how I feel about it.

**plastichaxan** (4): me forcing myself to like this song (it didn’t work)

**seanderlust** (4): eh i'm just not crazy about this one

**xxipil0ts** (0): The track seemed to be buried in the album and it was one of those tracks that seemed to be something I thought they wouldn't really produce.

**SideBTrack8** (8): The writing and production are still top notch but there aren't any melodies that hook me. A great song, but still my least favourite on the album, not surprised it's Phoebe's first real song out.

**wavingwolves** (4): Oh, look, it's a tie! I guess this is one of the most simple songs on the record, both thematically and in sound. In the words of Phoebe herself, "it’s about a dead relationship, but it doesn’t get to have any victorious ending. It’s like you’re bored and sad and you don’t want drama, and you’re waking up every day just wanting to have shit be normal, but it’s not that great." When it comes to my own enjoyment, unfortunetely, not even a line like "I can always count on you to tell me the truth when you've been drinking and you're wearing a mask" can make me like this one very much. My "problem" with it is mostly he weirdly repetitive chorus and the overall melody that I find to be a tad annoying. And well, if this is placing here, I'm guessing this is not an uncommon feeling.

#Michael Myers himself

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is gonna flop so bad and i hate all of you for it

**runaway3212** (10): this is so great

**TiltControls** (10): another gorgeous song, that's maybe a bit weaker lyrically but sounds good enough for me to love it

**totallynot14\_** (9.5): China Anne-Mclain has competition-- also this is a great song about a failing relationship but wtf does the dodgers fan that gets beat to death have to do with anything? is it just for the depressing ambiance? pheobe needs to do more genius interviews

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Once again, the strings kill me! How come one come up with these beautiful sounds?

**iniekcja\_** (9): and it's fuck relationships!!

**llieno94** (9): a melancholy whimper of a last attempt at an almost dead relationship. I love main metaphor of the song, that the costumes and roleplaying of the holiday could help you feel more open to be your true self.

**OberionSynth** (9): this song makes me sad bc i never even got to celebrate halloween

**seanderlust** (9): I had a comment for this but I was reading genius and her saying on twitter that the craziest thing she's done for love is shit in a sandbox uh.....derailed my train of thought

**walkeddowntheblock** (9): I love how the guitar sounds on this.

**xcjm** (9): Conor Oberst in the final outro is divine!!! Also love Phoebe's dark humour coming through

**jman457** (8.9): But if this were fall Phoebe would score a lot higher, spring is a weird time to be listening to her, esp with thisalbum.

**bbfan132** (8.5): enjoyed how mellow this was

**forgetquick** (8.5): Chorus is admittedly basic, but there are a few lines and something so sweet about this song that keep me coming back to it.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): invented holidays

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The lyrics here are a good reminder that sports fans are still probably worse than pop stans. Love the chorus and the male vocals at the end. Outro kinda goes a little long.

**conceptualromance** (8): reminds me of a National song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TCFK1k8-Uz8

**endcreditouilles** (8): I love the production on this, but I wanted so much more of the background instrumentation. I feel like I had to strain to hear it over the vocals. I both love and hate the minimalism, like it's got such a gorgeous and delicate touch but I just want more from it.

**nick1372** (8): hopefully Halloween songs replace Christmas songs for good

**skargardin** (8): this is just so sad omg

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Lo-fi Indie beats to chill/fall asleep to (in a good way)

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): she likes this holiday so much she wrote a song about it and dresses as a skeleton at every opportunity

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7): A little "Phoebe on autopilot"

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Having a song named Halloween in an album that was released in June was a bold move.

**just\_thonking** (7): just a little too boring

**leviswift13** (7): my least favorite phoebe song ever. does nothing for me in the way these other songs do. i mean, it's still a phoebe bridgers song so the level of craft is there. just not for me.

**proscett** (7): this is boring yet good

**ReallyCreative** (7): this song has so much potential but it just doesn't hold my interest before it really gets to the point, and the ending just feels lackluster

**Stryxen** (7): I knew which of my acquaintences were gay when they all posted this song on their story on halloween

**vayyiqra** (7): I was told this song was the best pick for a 0 in this rate and I don't like Halloween (it's overrated! not sorry!) as a holiday but can't in good faith give this song a 0 it's not bad it's kind of pretty even as melancholy as it is

**waluigiest** (7): I adore the hospital line, less enamored with the rest

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i wore my jumper that looks like a pumpkin today!! its may!! its just nice and warm and comforting and im quite sad right now!! i miss things

#Santa Claus and his friends, I'm guessing 

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): spooky scary skeletons make me go sleep sleep

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): This is too extremely minimal for me to enjoy, it feels just… lacking

**bigbigbee** (6): The metaphor in this feels too obvious to me to be interesting. It’s not bad, but I’m like…yeah. I get it. The song isn’t really a “head empty bop” either. Plus her excellent diction means it’s hard to listen to the song and not pick up on the lyrics, unlike something like, IDK, the Cocteau Twins, who could be singing about mashed potatoes and I’d bop in happy, ignorant bliss.

**Brendon-Urine** (6): I like the lyrics but this is one where the songwriting is a tad boring

**CarlieScion** (6): a bit too mellow

**frogaranaman** (6): great night to get dick

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this just sounds really similar to the previous song making it worse than it actually was

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I love that bit about the hospital sirens… morbid humor works so well in songs

**shhhneak** (6): A lil bit of haunted house noises would spruce this track right up.

**SmileAndTears** (6): Idk this one is kind of a skip for me ngl. It's just really unsettling and it makes me uncomfortable

**static\_int\_husp** (6): If we can be anything, I choose to be not this song

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): one of the few songs that i wish was shorter. cool idea lyrically, but i think it drags on a bit

**bespectacIed** (5): Least fave song on punisher, a bit boring. Two elephants in the room --> the skeleton onesies are ugly, and her friendship with conor oberst is weird

**jayjaysortagay** (5): come on this is boring I can't believe she's like the best big thing in music. Stream Bree Runway or something 😪

**pat-rickstar** (4): This is what I imagine all of Phoebe's music sounds like to people who call her boring/can't get into her

**Turpamutteri** (4): this is pretty boring and the album would be better without this track

**1998tweety** (3): please dont call your song halloween and serve me this bland ass song. i 100% get what shes going for with the line "its halloween and we can be anything" but this feels like a missed opportunity to add some variety to the album especially when this song sounds sooo similar to everything else here

**fadedblue09** (0): Phoebe’s songwriting is a double-edged sword. On one hand, I like how it contributes to the haunting aesthetic of the album but sometimes she just gives off the energy of an edgy, gore-obsessed middle schooler who’s like “HAHA blood”. This song is the worst offender of the latter.

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): The only acceptable justification for the "bonus tracks" being bonus tracks is that this works so well as an album closer.

**wavingwolves** (8): Well, I guess you guys don't like album closers unless they ar- ANYWAY, I think the heavy guitar in this steals the show completely, but in comparison with the rest of the album I can see this is a much less dynamic song and that probably hurt its chances.

---

#ILY

**proscett** (11): Farisma, Uniqueness, Berve, and Talent

**conceptualromance** (10): kinda reminds me of a replacements song, idk if that’s just me though

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I know this is getting robbed for being too short, but "you beat yourself up and I let you take it out on me, another day, another hour, no apology" is a SAVAGE line. The realest, rawest song on the album.

**llieno94** (10): best song on the album for me, bar none. It took me longer to come around to than a lot of the record, but it’s a close to perfect song.

**Stryxen** (10): this reverberates in my soul and when i listen to this im crying in the car listening to the radio at 2am

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): I know this song is probably going to leave early, but it's one of my favorites from WIMPIII. The guitar is catchy, and the feelings described are...too real :)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): “I spend my mornings overthinkin' all my old mistakes / But I would never judge your problems in the same way” OOOF!!

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): I love the slinky guitar.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): I absolutely love the guitar on this track, the tone perfectly fits what they're going for and it complements the vocals really well.

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): that guitar!

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (9): They really do know how to write a toxic guitar bop

**bbfan132** (9): absolutely love that guitar, sounds perfect

**CzrLandWhale** (9): Fub-Tee

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This song is FUBTerribly great. Sorry for my failed attempt to be funny or clever, I'm very bad at this, I know.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The guitar solo here is a really good proper ending to an album

**xcjm** (9): This is a song to lie in the dark to

**CarlieScion** (8): im so sorry but after watching the circle I can’t read this without a hashtag #FUBT

**OberionSynth** (8): this is a really serious song but the title just makes me think of "FUPA" and i have the sense of humor of a six year old

**ReallyCreative** (8): why did they make this title an acronym. it's fucked up. but it's true

**runaway3212** (8): pretty

**steelstepladder** (8): The guitar at the end slays

**1998tweety** (7.5): the guitar at the end is nice

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): good closer

**NotWith10000Men** (7.3): I hate how nothing in this album so far has gone beyond "yeah this is good" to "YEAH WOW this is good." if the guitar had been there the whole time in this song it would be a lot better

**AHSWeeknd** (7): How do you pronounce that title?

**akanewasright** (7): Good ending to the album, even though no one ends the album with this song lol

**Awkward\_King** (7): for us by tk

#WTF

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Hmm...interesting closer. I was expecting more but okay.

**leviswift13** (7): it's always felt slight compared to the rest of the album. there is a great momentum to these last tracks that just gets halted by fubt

**seanderlust** (7): I like that they tackle this material, but I don't see myself returning to it

**wasian-invasion** (7): now from the top make it drop thats some fubt thats some fubt bring a bucket and a mop for this fubt fubt fubt

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): was the acronym really necessary, just call it Fucked Up (But True)

**endcreditouilles** (6): The instrumentation is too loud here, I'd like a better balance between guitar and vocals. I know the over-produced vocals are kind of their vibe but it's losing me here.

**flavasavavandal** (6): You know I should probably like this more than I actually do, it’s a nice guitar-driven ballad, and if I was judging this for the first half I’d probably give a much higher score, but the cacophony of instruments that collide towards the end just sounds bad

**jman457** (6): I like that its kind of recycled of gasoline, but also I kind of dont

**kappyko** (6): why would you just remake the steps

**vayyiqra** (6): *I wanna play a beautiful game / Even though we're gonna lose / But I adore you*

**notoriouspge** (5.8): Now I'm In It was RIGHT THERE for the album closer

**cremeebrulee** (5): shouldn’t this have been called FUBIT

**rosecult** (4): forgettable

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): The guitars are too damn loud.

**fadedblue09** (3): For the first few minutes, there's nothing but a guitar riff that doesn’t build up. It tries to pull a stunt in the end with a guitar solo, but honestly it just felt very unrewarding.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): One of the warmest moments on the album, this is about a time after a breakup where Fiona was too in her feelings ~~like Drake~~ and thought her bandmates were mad at her after coming back to her house and noticing the drumset was gone. She immediately sang what she felt to her phone and it ended up here, without any alterations. If feels very raw and unpolished in a way I really like, but I know it might have been a problem for others, especially since this come right after the heaviest song in the album. I feel like the placement is this one for a reason, and I really appreciate it the warmth of it. I also want to mention that every single time I hear this song I think of what she said to Vulture about it: "There’s a certain part where you can sort of hear me laughing because I’m playing the chair and Mercy comes up to me and starts kissing me while we’re recording. No one else would be able to hear it, but whenever I hear that song, I’ll be able to remember that moment."

**SideBTrack8** (8): As someone who tends to immediately think of the worst-case-scenario for every situation, especially when it's about what others think of me, I can relate to this so hard. Gotta love anxiety!

---

#Drummers

**fadedblue09** (10): I don't get the hate, this is really catchy and fun to hum to. Maybe I’m biased but it’s a very calm, breather follow-up to the emotional intensity of the previous track.

**leviswift13** (10): this song feels slight at first but for me it's always the one stuck in my head and the one i go to first when i'm *feeling* things. the loneliness is really delicate and beautiful.

**steelstepladder** (10): A fantastic come down from For Her

**Stryxen** (10): i just know her neighbours stole the drumset and then got mad when she started slamming doors for percussion instead

**walkeddowntheblock** (10): Describes my anxious attachment style so well <3

**zagreux** (10): (tw: suicide) >!I know this song isn't about suicide but the *Why did you take it all away? Why did you not want to try?* part always makes me feel better when I'm thinking about suicide, like I love the whole "Why didn't you try once more before just ending it all" vibe!<

**survivorjdmarina** (9.9): This song is so underappreciated! I think it’s cute and simple, a very easy to listen to track.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): overhated this is really pretty

**llieno94** (9): "Now I understand, you're a human, And you got to lie, you're a man, And you got to get what you want, How you want it, but so do I, And I wanted to try, Why did you not want to try? Why did you take it all away?" has to be one of her best lines to date

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): :(

**seanderlust** (9): I love her but I feel like fiona would be such a messy friend to have. I mean that as a semi compliment

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Probably the most underrated track on the album and also the right one to bring up the percussion on the album overall. Amy Aileen Wood is the drummer for most of the album and this song is about her titular drumset and how Fiona was worried Amy wouldn't work with her anymore after a breakup but boy am I glad that didn't happen, the percussion is probably my favourite element of the music.

**vayyiqra** (9): I miss my drumset :frowning:

**waluigiest** (9): “the drumset is gone” ah so that explains this album

**xcjm** (9): Jonathan Ames has some EXPLAINING to do

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I misread this as Drumstick occasionally and it makes me hungry

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the rhythm quite a bit but it didn’t really need to be on the album imo

**akanewasright** (8): This following up For Her puts an impossible weight on it, but it’s a really good song

**CarlieScion** (8): this went off

**endcreditouilles** (8): I like the groove on this, but it feels like a fall off from the previous 3 tracks in energy. It's missing something, but overall a nice track.

**kirby31200** (8): Is it a good song? Yes. Would I notice if it was gone? Probably not

**OberionSynth** (8): the backstory of this song is very relatable bc i also immediately find the worst case scenario in any situation imaginable

**runaway3212** (8): this is good but strangely for this album

**skargardin** (8): this pales a little bit in comparison to for her and on i go but it's not bad by any means

**static\_int\_husp** (8): A lot of repetition in this song, but I feel like it represents the constant questioning after an event like a breakup fairly well

#People who would take the drumset out of Fiona's house

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this is probably the weakest of the bunch

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): this is good but I think it suffers from its position in the track list. It doesn’t really do anything she hasn’t done before on the album and it feels a bit empty following For Her

**jman457** (7.1): it feels slower than its track time would suggest but its cute

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**AHSWeeknd** (7): She got all that from a rug?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U2Rk_06DpLc

**team\_kockroach** (7): reminds me of Fleet Foxes

**wasian-invasion** (7): mmm that bass

**forgetquick** (6.5): By Fiona Apple's (very high) lyrical standards, this is just fine.

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (6): I think it's mostly a cooldown from For Her, which is helpful but also not the most exciting

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): This is nice but doesn't stack up with the rest of the album.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): Once again, the percussion is spot on, but that's all.

**jayjaysortagay** (5): this is a genuinely exhausting listen to me

**NotWith10000Men** (5): sometimes her repetition works for me and sometimes it doesn't. this isn't one of those times

**Uberpigeon** (5): It pains me to give such a meh score but I don't really like this song. Its the only thing from FTBC that I don't really like that much.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Probably the most forgettable song on the album.

**ManofOranges** (4): I honestly just don't remember this one at all I hate to say it!

**proscett** (3): too percussive

**wavingwolves** (9.1): This has no right being as good as it is for a lullaby. If I had Fiona Apple to sing to me as I fell asleep every right with this amount of tenderness I wouldn't be this depressed.

**SideBTrack8** (9): One thing I learned from putting the bonus rate is that Fiona has featured on some very random projects. Like, a song for a lullaby album??

---

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is stunningly gorgeous wow, i wish i heard this as a lullaby

**skargardin** (10): this was so insanely pretty wtf

**bbfan132** (9): i now want a full-on album of lullabies from fiona, this was gorgeous

**kirby31200** (9): What's this doing on the same album as "My Baby Likes Bacon"

**ggal2020** (8): I’m gonna cry?? She says my name at the beginning wtf?? How did I not know this existed???

**pat-rickstar** (8): This is sweet actually

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): This song puts me to sleep but in a good way

**fadedblue09** (7): Love this folk tinged lullaby

**IIIHenryIII** (7): It's good, but not my cup of tea.

**celladonn** (6): Sweet but there's not much to it

**static\_int\_husp** (5.5): A random lullaby with less than 200k streams? How did the rate hosts even find this

**waluigiest** (5): the Fiona bonus rate was honestly so chaotic

**OberionSynth** (2): this song cured my insomnia

**CritneySpearz** (1): creepy for some reason..

**SideBTrack8** (8.5): I really thought this would be one of the top songs for the bonus rate, but it was actually losing for a bit. Danielle's (I'm assuming it's Danielle?) delivery is so different from HAIM's own music, but she sounds beautiful.

**wavingwolves** (6): This isn't *bad*, but is it good? Debatable. I guess if it's placing here, we could argue it isn't.

---

**vayyiqra** (10): My bestie stolenbicycle from Discord (a huge Boygenius MCU stan, as fate would have it) told me to listen to this saying it sounds like early Grimes. I was skeptical because it's Haim but holy shit, it kind of does. (It also sounds like Banks.) I love this. Gesaffelstein is a really talented producer.

**shhhneak** (9.4): this sounds like a lost Kingdom Hearts theme song.

**OberionSynth** (9): I feel like I like HAIM's features more than I like their albums at this point lmao

**ReallyCreative** (9): so it sounds to me like a The Weeknd/HAIM collab would absolutely snap

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this is a weird stylistic departure for them but I dig it! more electronic Haim please

**seanderlust** (8.3): .....siiigh. (deletes pretyped comment that said "so bad is right!!!!!")

**bbfan132** (7.5): really liked the production, they sounded good here

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Production is nice, but it's not all that interesting apart from that

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I kinda like this. It's not as bad as the title suggests.

**skargardin** (5): This didn't really grab me at all, maybe bc it's so sonically different from everything else in the rate, idk

**plastichaxan** (4): the way i only retained something from this song at 3rd listen cause i only noticed it when it ended

**Leixander** (2): yeah... the title speaks for itself

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): The screams originally sounded so jarring and out of place, but now they're my favourite part of the song. They really tried something different with this song and it paid off, it's such a memorable track.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): Now, how is this placed so low? I had the impression you guys were songs-with-screams fans, but I guess I was wrong if this is here! Well, that said, I love the dynamism of this song and it's personally one of my favourites from WIMPIII. Every time I listen to it I'm amazed by layers of sound they introduce throughout the song and ooooooh that guitar. It's a yes for me.

---

# AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**CzrLandWhale** (11): All that ever mattered was that godawful banshee screeching noise that I absolutely fucking love for some reason.

**Awkward\_King** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**conceptualromance** (10): I’m a fan of screaming noises, what can I say

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): FUCK ME UPPPPPPPPPPP, this song is just perfect. I want to stand in an open field AND SCREAM ALONG WITH THE WAILING BANSHEES IN THE CHORUSES, UGH. Belb, send me to therapy, please.

**getin2it** (10): I NEED people to notice the screams in this track -- They're such a release and so fun in the car.

**iniekcja\_** (10): THIS IS GREAT (though it might be a compensatory ten)

**Leixander** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-

**leviswift13** (10): NOT TALKED ABOUT ENOUGH. so cathartic and charged and angry and INCREDIBLE. THE WAILS !!!

**mudkip1** (10): this is the shit i fuck with yas haim

**proscett** (10): screams in pop music always result in me stanning, no exceptions!

**rosecult** (10): the only way this song could be improved is if you put my own screams into this

**totallynot14\_** (10): there's so much screaming in this rate but I'm here for it

**xo\_acrangel\_xo** (10): Love the screams in this

**bulforster** (9.5): There's some stiff competition but this definitely has the best scream in the rate.

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): Man fuck, I didn’t expect this album to just go for some raw potency but at least it did, even if it close to the end. Those screeches, those guitars, the fact the song just straight up rocks. Best song on the album by a long shot

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): The chorus is brilliant.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): that scream is gay I can't prove it, I can't explain it, but it's gay

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): does this count as screamo

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (9): Banger banger banger

**celladonn** (9): Obsessed with that horrible shrieking sound

**kappyko** (9): this is going out with a shit ton of zeroes lol

**nick1372** (9): please more random screams in albums

**runaway3212** (9): banger

**seanderlust** (9): I am dying to know how popheads rates this one. personally, high marks as a reward for trying something new. go HAIM!

**shhhneak** (9): I used to HATE this chaotic production. You know what that is? Growth.

**skargardin** (9): the guitar solo yup yup

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The screams in the background,,, Caroline Polachek teas

**Stryxen** (9): this is lowkey the better AAAAAAAAAGHHHH in the rate

**survivorjdmarina** (9): This track is crazy.

**Turpamutteri** (9): The screams elevate the song

**bbfan132** (8.5): that guitar solo…

**forgetquick** (8.5): The vocals and production are great, but the pretty average lyrics hold this back.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): This is on my "screaming" playlist with I Know The End, Tears, STFU! etc, it's great

**pheromenos** (8.5): what's up with those shrieks 💀💀💀

**savemeaseat143** (8.4): fun production

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): this kinda sounds like a demo but it works

**plastichaxan** (8.3): another standout that i wonder why it didnt stand out to me before but i'm glad i saw the light

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Why does this sound like something from Taylor Swift’s Reputation?

**akanewasright** (8): One of the most memorable in the album imo

**bigbigbee** (8): I actually really like this, but those screeching sounds remind me of Minecraft phantoms and it sends me every time.

**endcreditouilles** (8): Hooked me on that first line, this song is perfect (especially the guitar at the end) EXCEPT for that screamy vocal effect. For me it's way too loud and in your face, it completely takes me out of the song. The energy and production are a perfect balance here otherwise, but that effect makes me not want to listen to this. Without that it would have been a 10.

**OberionSynth** (8): not sure how HAIM got a recording of me playing silent hill but it goes really well with the track

**steelstepladder** (7.8): Bit of a bop!

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): The chorus is the only part worth caring about, but it’s pretty good, so go off?

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Is this... hyper-indie-pop?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): Danielle's screams, that is all

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.4): the screaming makes the entire song but it’s no I Know the End

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): If you told me this was a Caroline Polachek song I'd believe you

#[Silence]

**1998tweety** (7): this is ok

**ignitethephoenix** (7): do I hear weird shrieks in the background? Not a fan of that

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the screaming is a choice. The guitar is sick tho

**xcjm** (6.8): very big fan of those backing screams

**CarlieScion** (6.5): once again with the peaking sound

**llieno94** (6): this one sounds more like a bonus tracks than the actual bonus tracks, but it does have one of the strongest full force rock moments on the album.

**vayyiqra** (6): 90s alt rock song but make it deranged and full of shrieking

**cyborglilith** (5.5): at least it's interesting

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (5.5): This is so annoying

**jman457** (5.1): eh, alright but feels kind of average

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The screaming (?) brought this up for a me a little but meh otherwise.

**CritneySpearz** (5): the wailing in the background... it's too much

**Vromega** (5): what is this scream on the background uh

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): no comment

**fadedblue09** (2): Wow this is chaotic. So many questionable production choices, none of which fit the song at all

**ManofOranges** (2): What is going on with that screaming noise???

**Brendon-Urine** (0): the chorus is super awkward I'm just not here for it. tears by chorli perfected the "screaming in chorus" thing, this doesn't do it for me at all.

**SideBTrack8** (9): I love the acoustic production so much, it makes the track really stand out. It feels so breezy, I just wanna drive through the countryside listening to this.

**wavingwolves** (8.3): First off, I'm very sorry to my dear friend u/ElizabethDDoS for this one — it was pretty much always a day one song. This is one of the songs that most grew on me throughout the rate and it's one I would now give it a higher rating to. It's just so tender and honest and it proclaims such a common feeling of being afraid of to fuck things up with someone and at the same time admitting that you need to lean on them for support and you need the reassurance that it's not one sided. Lovely, really, and very very charming.

# Doing all the leaning

**AquariusTeaSpilled** (11): The guitar moment could make me go into cardiac arrest

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): This is a 10 for the lyrics alone, but then that instrumental bridge just rumbles over you like an avalanche and takes you apart. I've cried rivers of tears listening to this and I'm not planning on stopping any time soon.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I'm a sucker for this folksy sound, absolutely love this. The lyrics hit home with me, and the guitar is so well performed and composed, I feel transported.

**ggal2020** (10): I want to inject the instrumental break straight into my veins

**IIIHenryIII** (10): The guitar is superb. I love how organic the instrumentals sound on this album.

**runaway3212** (10): Friends are important

**Stryxen** (10): it’s taking all that I’ve got not to sabotage

**Turpamutteri** (10): Fleetwood Mac vibes

**savemeaseat143** (9.7): uplifting somehow

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): this is really cute and sweet!

**ReallyCreative** (9.3): the music industry to Emily Montes

**outsideeyess** (9.2): love me some banjo

**CzrLandWhale** (9): This song is so friggin cute. Makes me feel like the 4th Haim sis.

**fadedblue09** (9): This one's a bit of more on the folk side which makes me appreciate it more. I love the old school vibe.

**llieno94** (9): stripped back and the most Lilith Fair they’ve ever sounded. Very Sheryl Crow/Patti Griffin late nineties inspired. The acoustic. The acoustic guitar solo is the best part of the record, a very timeless sounding song on a record tinged with modern productions flairs.

**OberionSynth** (9): def gonna listen to this at night when i wish i had a bf

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): major Fleetwood Mac vibes. the harmonies too!!

**celladonn** (8.5): This is so warm and sweet

**engifear** (7.5): I really like the guitar solo

**rosecoloreds** (7.5): it reminds me of that one fleetwood mac song

**akanewasright** (7): This is just lovely

# 🚶‍♂️


**static\_int\_husp** (7): A lot of the middle of this album just kinda fades into the background for me

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's nice enough but nothing too remarkable

**conceptualromance** (6.5): it’s so Fleetwood Mac-esque it feels a bit derivative imo

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This would be featured in the soundtrack of the Greta Gerwig movie. Which isn’t a bad thing.

**notoriouspge** (6): unfortunately, the start of a small lull for this album

**steelstepladder** (6): Gotta be honest and say this song just kinda washes over be.

**ThObsceneBirdOfNight** (6): I appreciate the harmonies, but this is filler

**vayyiqra** (6): "I might sleep in past all my alarms" girl it's a certainty by now

**wavingwolves** (9.2): One of my favourite moments of the album when it comes to instrumentation of it. The rhythms and production in it are so fun and the song themes are very subversive and the kind you will always think of something new while listening to it. Fiona has said this was one of the songs she most worked on, for about 10 years, and it definetely feels like it to me, it feels almost well worn, in a way I find warm. It's just sassy, fun, daring and contagious.

**SideBTrack8** (8): I really love her delivery in the chorus, you can literally hear the heartbreak.

---

#Respectful people only!

**bbfan132** (10): i love when she screams in songs, it sounds so good ugh… i can feel every line

**cyborglilith** (10): never heard anything like this before

**Leixander** (10): coochie-coo-coo

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): love the emotion in her voice here

**OberionSynth** (10): queen of man titties

**Vromega** (10): Perfect orchestration. The bass line is so good

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): i’m gonna be honest i’m still not too sure what this song is about entirely but it bangs

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): that chorus is so good. I love the melody of the first two lines.

**endcreditouilles** (9): There's something raw about these vocals and the production that reminds me of the energy on Criminal, but more crisp and sparse, and it works for me. Love the personality in this, it feels very unapologetically Fiona.

**leviswift13** (9): i have always LOVED how this song sounds. it's a kind of anger that feels so nuanced and pure

**llieno94** (9): it wouldn’t be a Fiona record without at least a couple of problematic ex boyfriend songs... however instead of pining for lost love, she gives a searing critique of the egomaniac at hand- rumored ex and touring guitarist Blake Mills. Brilliantly she switches tenses in the song multiple times to reveal she still loves this guy.

**ReallyCreative** (9): Check out that rack of his, look at that set of giant bara mommy milkers

**runaway3212** (9): intense

**survivorjdmarina** (9): Since I unfortunately can’t give every track a 10, I’m letting this song fall victim. It’s great but I just listen to it less than other tracks, that’s all.

**xcjm** (9): I know rack of his refers to his guitar rack but I really do be imagining a big ol' set of moobies

**seanderlust** (8.5): miss fiona you know DAMN well you can write

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This beat scares me

**fadedblue09** (8): This grew on me a lot because of the unique instrumentation. And Fiona's delivery here is very emotional yet quirky.

**Uberpigeon** (8): Not a standout track but its still a good song

**useless-sheep** (8): the first song from this album that actually clicked for me, not one of my favs anymore but it’s still so good

**waluigiest** (8): my two favorite parts of this song are 1) her raw vocals in the chorus and 2) the word “non-holidays” in the opening line

**just\_thonking** (7.5): I like the riff

**Stryxen** (7.5): sir im checking out that rack of yours respectfully

**jman457** (7.2): giving more previous era’s fiona apple, but a continuation of the pure emotion of this one

#Hey, ahaha, what a nice rack ;)

**1998tweety** (7): this feels like a lot of nothing, the tune in the background is giving me background music in the loading screen of a party game though

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7): Love the rasp, never stood out to me on the album

**bespectacIed** (7): drag him

**CrimsonROSET** (7): It was cute I guess?

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I like the instrumentals a lot, but that's it. I don't know how I feel about the rest of the song. Still a good track, though.

**vayyiqra** (7): "I try to write" me rn adding a comment to everything despite having no thoughts head empty

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): Me when I pass a shirtless jogger

**jayjaysortagay** (6): the countermelody sounds like music from a 2000s lifestyle PC game

**ktajlili** (6): I thought you would wail on me / Like you wail on them / But it was just a coochie-coo-coup / makes me cringe. This song and drumset are the only ones I dislike on this album

**proscett** (6): forgettable but decent!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): His rack is decent at best.

**shhhneak** (4.5): “You know what, your microphone did blow out. I heard it.” - Trisha Paytas

**team\_kockroach** (4): the only interesting thing is the mixed meter 6/8 -> 3/4 pattern in the song.

**welcometoNY** (4): i just feel very meh about this

**wavingwolves** (10): THIS IS CAMP! I'm such a sucker for this kind of very cheesy metal-adjacent sound. It's just very fun and contagious to listen to.

**SideBTrack8** (6): Not a huge fan of this one, I almost didn't want to put it in the bonus rate because I thought it was such a clear loser. Obviously I was wrong about that, sorry to the songs that placed below this. It's a fun song and the production is good, but the lyrics are just so bland.

---

**endcreditouilles** (10): This is so fun, I absolutely love this. The drums and guitar sound so classic, they remind me of a mix of ACDC, Guns and Roses, Joan Jett, etc. I want a whole album of this. Come on sisters.

**jayjaysortagay** (10): yet another camp classic from the family Haim

**pheromenos** (10): yasss i felt it haim

**seanderlust** (10): me: hell yeah I'm into heavy metal!! the heavy metal:

**savemeaseat143** (9.3): too good for the croods

**pat-rickstar** (9): This slaps idc

**RandomHypnotica** (9): why is this way better than it has ANY right to be

**ReallyCreative** (9): ok but let's make an album with this sound challenge?

**waluigiest** (9): I’m floored

**celladonn** (8.5): This rocks so much harder than a song written for The Croods 2 has any right to

**kirby31200** (8.5): My mom is gonna love this

**nick1372** (8.5): I love how unabashedly corny this is

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): HAIM doing cock rock is so camp but also incredible because they sound like they're having so much fun.

**CritneySpearz** (8): it kinda slaps even though it sounds like it should be on Kids Bop 124

**fadedblue09** (8): This is cute actually lol

**sarcasticsobs** (8): HAIM hair metal album when?

**skargardin** (8): they snapped

**jasannn** (7): Why would this feel out of place on Plastic Hearts?

**plastichaxan** (7): okay, this caught me off guard, i didn't expect something this energetic(? in this rate and when i went to look what song it was...it was a song made for the croods? i don't know what to make of this

**bbfan132** (6.5): super cheesy but fun

**IIIHenryIII** (6): It's a good song. Nothing stands out besides the guitar though.

**OberionSynth** (6): this is an absolute rager and it's from the soundtrack to the CROODS we are in the strangest timeline

**static\_int\_husp** (6): is this camp

**thedoctordances1940** (6): I like the energy and guitars, but it seems to lack something that would actually make it good

**shhhneak** (5.4): This reminds me: HAIM needs to make a Hex Girls cover album.

**ggal2020** (4.5): They did what they had to do, but what they had to do wasn’t good

**vayyiqra** (4): I was afraid this would sound like Imagine Dragons but instead it's Haim LARPing as Guns'n'Roses and idk how to feel about that. This is clearly a knockoff of "Welcome to the Jungle". Are they serious? Are they trolling? Weird as it is to say, I think I would rather just listen to Guns'n'Roses, or Joan Jett would do.

**mudkip1** (1): i hate this song

**wavingwolves** (10): This deserved so much more, I don't understand why it's placing so low. It feels like such an odd duo for a collab, but for some reason it works really well, even if it's strange to hear Phoebe's voice in a more pop production.

**SideBTrack8** (7.5): It's alright, but I think this duo had a lot of potential and the song just didn't live up to it.

**waluigiest** (7): fine, but I can’t help but feel like any kid cudi after his debut is missing that magic

**plastichaxan** (6.8): i don't know what i expected from this collab but i still don't know how to feel about this

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I like how androgynous Phoebe's voice sounds in a lower register

**bbfan132** (6): not bad, just kind of boring

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Is it just me or Phoebe's voice sounds different on this track? It sounds so deep. I'm not sure how I feel about it. It's definitely not bad, but it doesn't captivate me.

**SideBTrack8** (10): My second favourite song in the rate. I wasn't expecting it to do great but I wish it could have at least made it past day 1. The guitar solo makes me ascend. I love the little things they added, like the yawn and the seagulls and the alarms, it really adds to the dreamy sound.

**wavingwolves** (8.3): *Yawns* This being day one? Yeah, not a surprise but it still hurts, as most placements from today do. I must admit this grew on me and if I was to rate this today I would rate it highly. I personally really love the production in this and how there's little elements being added as the songs goes, it keeps it dynamic and interesting for the entirety of it. The bridge in this is one of the best moments in the whole record, it was made to scream out of a moving car or in a karaoke bar.

---

#Awake

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “We were on the beach, running in the sea” Why did I instantly think of Contact starring legend Jodie Foster.

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I LIVE for the distorted guitar solo/freakout, i SO wish it were longer. this song is amazing.

**getin2it** (10): That guitar is killer -- It's loose and shreddy and so fucking cool.

**Stryxen** (10): the gasp yawn sign makes me just AGKJKGSJSGSGHHK

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): this one absolutely slaps

**shhhneak** (9.5): “and you have changed in the blink of an eye” always smacks me.

**bulforster** (9.3): Yes, the 15 second guitar solo is responsible for at least two of these points on its own.

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): insomnia dishwashing anthem!!

**cremeebrulee** (9): underrated!!!!

**endcreditouilles** (9): Love the energy in this and the effects on the vocals works here. Harmonies and composition give me big The Wire vibes.

**jayjaysortagay** (9): why do I stan the yawn at the start of this so hard? That fact it sounds so fake makes it iconic camp

**kappyko** (9): this song actually does something rlly cool with the shitty sounding mixing

**nick1372** (9): Alarm clock opening of a song is out, dramatic gasp is in!

**pat-rickstar** (9): This production is so cool, banger

**runaway3212** (9): simple but effective

**sarcasticsobs** (9): wild production

**survivorjdmarina** (9): I think the vocoder on this track fits surprisingly well. Nice groove too.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): this almost has like a tame impala vibe to it

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): That distorted yawning sounds amazing. I'm not even gonna talk about the outro. What a great way to start and end a track named "Up From A Dream". So clever.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): my favorite discovery, i don't know how this wasn't an album standout for me before

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Bop!

**jman457** (8.4): the instrumental is so sick, Like Elephant by tame impala with some strokes' influence. I can see Este’s bass face in this

**1998tweety** (8): bopt

**CarlieScion** (8): cute! loving the bass

**conceptualromance** (8): feels like an Angel Olsen song

**just\_thonking** (8): Does this remind anyone else of Paul Simon?

**leviswift13** (8): has the misfortune of following a terrific one-two-three, but still great

**OberionSynth** (8): queens of rhyming "up from the dream" with "up from the dream"

**proscett** (8): the bridge/interlude section might be my favorite part of this album tbh

**shesdoingyoga** (8): This is probably the first one from this album so far that has stood out to me in some way, that being the production/instrumental

**TiltControls** (8): if only it didn't have that annoying alarm at the end

**Uberpigeon** (8): The really deep bass makes this sound really cool and fresh

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7.8): That alarm clock at the end sounded like it could transition well to Sky Ferreria's 24 Hours so I turned on the crossfade feature on Spotify and holy shit it actually fucking works [Here's the video of the mindblowing transition.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lAlyNbyL5V8)

**cyborglilith** (7.5): reminds me of St. Vincent

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (7): Doesn't necessarily stand out to me on such a great album. Not quite filler, not quite *not* filler

**bbfan132** (7): the psychedelic swirl in the background is intriguing… like the intro/outro too. however, it sounds like their mics are covered with bags and it turns me off from the song a bit

**bespectacIed** (7): that vocoder-ed yawn, i came a little bit. Cute song

#*Yawns*

**bigbigbee** (7): I didn’t think it was possible for a song to remind me of Tainted Love and also be kind of uninteresting to me, but this one did it!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): girl if the first thing you’re doing when you wake up is washing the dishes you need to GET IT TOGETHER

**CzrLandWhale** (7): Wake me up! Wake me up inside from a dream!

**llieno94** (7): muted, distorted vocals delivered almost deadpan, yet knowing, like being lulled into sleep, only to erupt into a buzzy blitz of electronic flourishes, a crazy dream beginning.

**skargardin** (7): morning alarm anthem

**vayyiqra** (7): Why does this sound like Katie from MUNA is singing (not a bad thing)

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): eh it's fine. Too low energy

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): You're in a dream and then you're up from a dream and you go back to sleep and you're still in a dream and then you wake up from the dream and you're in a dream

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): kinda confused by the middle third going so hard. I like it more than the other parts, but it feels really weirdly placed

**ktajlili** (6): weakest song in the album tbh

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): good but probably the worst song in the first half of the album

**flavasavavandal** (5): Again I’m left pondering the choices, like why do the guitars sound like this, why does album think the consistent summer haze style works better than it actually does.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): this song makes me weirdly anxious maybe it's all the alarm clock sounds

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Overproduced and annoying. Also I swear this felt longer than 3 minutes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This song feels like a dream but like one of those you forget within a minute of waking up.

**SideBTrack8** (10): "Evil is a relay sport / When the one who's burned / Turns to pass the torch" instantly became one of my favourite lyrics ever, the fact that she wrote it when she was 15 is crazy. This being out day one is tragic, it deserves way better.

**wavingwolves** (8.8): I love songs that are able to fully demonstrate sonically what the lyrics are about, and this is one that does that really well. The sense of urgency you feel while listen to this song is the same one Fiona expresses in lyrical form when talking about cycles of abuse, making this such a complete and interesting experience. I love the verses of this and how it goes from resenting someone for having an ultimately better life than you to resenting someone for being a little taller. The idea what you will look at someone else who might have it different and wish that were you in their place is an ugly and human thing. I really love it the portrayal of that.

---

#Sports people

**passionfruits2** (11): The final lines of "I'm sorry.", signaling that Fiona is passing the evil ("Evil is a relay sport") is SO chilling. It makes me emotional almost every listen.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): What sort of genius is required to make this excellence?

**bbfan132** (10): so FUCKING good ugh, love the percussion

**bespectacIed** (10): So good, the song does feel like a relay, the metaphor is genius, gahd fiona's mind is just unreal

**cyborglilith** (10): holy shit

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Ah, influencers, the people that are just as unnecessary as landlords and billionaires.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): Evil Lizzo???????

**iniekcja\_** (10): this is unbelievably catchy

**kappyko** (10): various dancing gifs

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the percussion here is so good! also the last bit really reminds me of bjork’s hyperballad (another song i can’t wait to rate)

**plastichaxan** (10): her resentments are valid and also shared

**ReallyCreative** (10): so evil is an olympic event? can't wait for this rate to win the gold

**steelstepladder** (10): I don't think that there is a lyric that helped me unpack as much personal trauma as "Evil is a relay sport when the one whos burnt turns to pass the torch"... And it's still not getting my 11

**zagreux** (10): Glad to know that I'm not the only one who straight-up resents others, whether it's for being horrible or being taller than me

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): This is my favorite track! I love the line, Evil is a relay sport when the one who's burned turns to pass the torch. Another lyrical masterpiece. She is a lyrical genius!

**kirby31200** (9.5): I too resent the tall

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): The switch between the chorus and verses is just so good

**Stryxen** (9.5): fiona when she has to lay something again. idk i didn’t listen to the song

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): God I love the opening lyric of this song. "Evil is a relay sport when the one who’s burnt turns to pass the torch" 🗣🗣

**bulforster** (8.8): The fact she wrote the chorus when she was 15... an honestly disgusting level of talent...

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I feel sorry for all the college students that are going to be subjected to a cappella performances of this song

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.5): The vocal runs at the end tho. Beautiful.

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Oh. Wow. Sports.

**forgetquick** (8.5): I don't care for the chorus, but the verses are undeniable. The layering and percussion are genius and the song goes a million places and never gets boring.

**runaway3212** (8.5): i hate relays but this song is good

**savemeaseat143** (8.5): she made points

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): the instrumental layering on this is just fantastic

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8): Great song, does get a little overlooked for me on such a great album.

**conceptualromance** (8): I dislike the “evil is a relay sport” part if I’m being honest. I really like the rest of it, though

**cremeebrulee** (8): “evil is a relay sport when the one who's burnt turns to pass the torch” bitch this line reads so clunky but she makes it so catchy??? what kind of witchcraft

**CrimsonROSET** (8): it wouldn’t be me doing a rate if i didn't have strong opinions about an outro that goes on for too long

**jayjaysortagay** (8): this is what my soul sounds like on a daily basis 😌, had to take 2 points off tho bc again with the damn outro

**jman457** (8): The album picks up steem again, can feel the emotions she dings about

**ktajlili** (8): reminds me of newspaper...with less rage.

**llieno94** (8): the grittiest song on the album and the closest to her early career signature mad girl vibe. It makes sense she wrote the main refrain as a teenager, as it evokes the same feelings songs like Sleep to Dream from her debut. It ends in a much more matured Fiona though, with funky bass line jam before fading to just Fiona and her sister harmonizing on a eerie, music box-esque poem Fiona freestyles.

**proscett** (8): the 'evil is a relay sport' couplet is so sexy but the rest of the song sadly lets it down a bit

**seanderlust** (8): this one is a little chaotic for my taste, though the lyrics are brilliant

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Fiona really said fuck nepotism 😍

**waluigiest** (8): yeah I don’t know what this means. But the drums and strings and chanting are lit!!!

**xcjm** (8): I'm going to gold in the Evil category at the next Olympics

**EnCaine** (7.5): not my favorite but i love the energy

#Gay people

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Catchy chorus but gets repetitive. It's okay but it loses steam after a while.

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): what demon does chanting the chorus summon

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The chorus to this is really good but I don't really like that extended part in the middle/at the end with no lyrics besides "wooing." Cool lyrics tho.

**celladonn** (7): Influencers are trembling

**leviswift13** (7): the central lyric is very clever and interesting, but it does kind of drag on for me. i think something this album struggles with is repetition that doesn't always feel earned

**nick1372** (7): love this concept so much but the chorus is a bit grating

**NotWith10000Men** (7): "But I know that if I hate you for hating me / I will have entered the endless rage." love the message, it's just too repetitive for me. but considering how repetitive it actually is, it doesn't feel as repetitive as maybe it should.

**Uberpigeon** (7): One of the weaker songs on the album, but still a banger and I love the craziness of the second half.

**1998tweety** (6.5): this feels sooo repetitive to the point it gets annoying

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this feels like an experiment rather than an actual song

**just\_thonking** (6): she really does love her repetition

**OberionSynth** (6): the comparison of abuse and a relay race is genius, and the transitions in this song are killer, but the chorus (aside from the last one) really drags it down imo

**vayyiqra** (6): true I am tall she got me there ... feeling guilty now ... some crimes can never be forgiven :pensive:

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): do u think maybe evil is a relay sport when the one who's burned turns to pass the torch?

**CarlieScion** (5): why are you YELLING

**notoriouspge** (5): I'm allergic to exercise

**Vromega** (5): nothing original, too repetitive for me... and boring last minute

**welcometoNY** (1): boring, half-baked, melody is suffocating, and the message is a bit heavy-handed

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): I love that there's at least one song on the album, even if it's a bonus track, that each sister has their own verse. These are their most personal struggles, but they've all got each other for support. I cannot believe this (just barely) didn't even make day 2.

**wavingwolves** (9): One of the rare moments in their discography that truly showcases each sister's individuality. This is just really sweet and heart crushing at the same time. As someone who has been in Alana's position, I basically can't really listen to this without trying to hold back tears or fully crying. Missing someone always hurts, but it's a totally different experience when you're fully aware there's absolute no way in the word for you to see that person, no matter how much you want to.

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is sweet.

**akanewasright** (10): legitimately gorgeous. Also idk HAIM super well, but I think one of the girls gets to sing more here than on the rest of the album, and she sounds great

**AquariusTeaSpilled** (10): One of the saddest songs ever written

**celladonn** (10): Breathtaking, this gets me so teary-eyed

**conceptualromance** (10): this song makes me cry so hard

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Fuck it, this is adorable. We need more friendship anthems.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Alana :sadyell:

**leviswift13** (10): makes me become a pool of little baby tears

**proscett** (10): it's actually criminal this didn't go on the standard album

**ReallyCreative** (10): Why am I crying at the bar mitzvah

**seanderlust** (10): this is so beautiful. the last verse...crying in the club right now

**skargardin** (10): this is so pretty ughhh

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I originally thought this was gonna be a Leonard Cohen cover when it released, but even though it's not I still love it

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): such a timeless-sounding song with a great story behind

**Turpamutteri** (10): I love that all of them got to sing a verse on this song

**shhhneak** (9.9): Alana’s verse has me in shambles.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): This is stupidly pretty and nice, and it's going to get robbed because of both balladphobia and bonusphobia

**IIIHenryIII** (9): One single word: gorgeous, ding.

**llieno94** (9): This track is the most clearly you can hear all the sisters voices and their separate narratives interweaving instead of one cohesive sentiment, like the majority of this record's song. It pairs perfectly with Leaning on You and I hope they do a striped back folk/country sounding record that sounds similar.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): they do a country vibe really really well and the harmonies shine in this one

**rickikardashian** (9): ma'am I'm already crying please stop

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Throughout the album they definitely tried to catch an old folk/country feel and to mixed results but here it's achieved perfectly, so much so that this does not sound like it was released in 2019 at all. I would absolutely believe anybody who said this song was released 50 years ago.

**totallynot14\_** (9): depressing as hell

**bbfan132** (8.5): beautiful verses

**nick1372** (8.5): wish we had more main vocals from non-Danielle

**AcidBettyNeedsASpank** (8): did we need another song called Hallelujah? probably no. Is this song really good? Yeah of course.

**cremeebrulee** (8): :(

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): Awww this is so nice to see HAIM's sweet and vulnerable side here.

**flavasavavandal** (8): yeah this works well, especially when Alana’s verse hits and when the strings gain greater prominence after that. Great song. Probably should’ve been on the album proper

**iniekcja\_** (8): it is quite cute but nothing too spectacular

**ManofOranges** (8): Walked so Leonard Cohen could run.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): sob emoji

**runaway3212** (8): shrek outsold

**steelstepladder** (8): It's nice!

**Stryxen** (8): women !

**xcjm** (8): Jeff Buckley who?

**fadedblue09** (7.5): This has a cute old-school folk vibe to it.

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): wait do the other haims not sing on any of the other songs?

**waluigiest** (7): it’s beautiful and I also understand why it was a deluxe cut

**jman457** (6.6): while I love some Canyon style folk it does feel like a Weyes Blood b-side.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I had to listen to this like three times because I saw the Billie Eilish British Vogue cover during my first listen and was so shook I kept getting distracted. Very pretty but not super memorable.

**CarlieScion** (6): I understand why this is a bonus track

**OberionSynth** (6): lyrics are cute but i can't relate to any of them so

**vayyiqra** (6): :hanawinsCowgirl:

**bespectacIed** (4): 2yeehaw4me part II

**Awkward\_King** (3): well this song just makes me bitter about the relationship they have as family
