None of this information has changed since yesterday!

* Number of participants: [77](https://pastebin.com/d15LwCZc)

* Average Score: 7.723

* Average Controversy Score: 1.697 (meaning anything above this is controversial, anything below this is surprisingly noncontroversial)

[Join us in the Beatsense room where the songs will be revealed!](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj) Today we'll be revealing **#33-17** I would recommend turning on subtitles on YouTube first, many videos we'll be seeing have them.

[/r/popheads/comments/qe9zep/the_east_asian_pop_royalty_rate_reveal_day_2/hhs5kp8/]

=====

LesApfels: Their song Coconut reminds me of a Mario water level theme and is kinda funny in that it's just a massive double entendre.

They also have Doki Doki and Koko Soko which are eurodance bops quite similar to Butterfly

In case you were wondering, their first album was themed around travelling the world, so they had a bunch of songs meant to represent different countries (which I guess kinda explains why Butterfly . . is what it is). Once that song blew up for them with DDR they kinda pivoted to immitating that sound a lot more.

DilemmaOfAHedgehog: If it helps I sped run on Spotify and mostly only learned the context of Jolin‚Äôs songs because I need to translate the mandar√≠n to know which songs to rate.

Jhe116: Due to time zone difference I can‚Äôt join the reveal unless I have a very terrible sleeping schedule. Anyways the womxnly robbery is expected (but somehow I forgot about it and voted the Greatest Artist in the survey on which song would be robbed) but I‚Äôm glad there is some learning for some people today (I didn‚Äôt know A Bouquet for You is a tribute to Utada‚Äôs late mother either) 

Can‚Äôt believe Only One is eliminated on Day 2, but there are still many great songs left so I‚Äôm content. Please don‚Äôt fail Kiss My Lips popheads
