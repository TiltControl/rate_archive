Artist: Jolin Tsai: OK after listening, I see why she has stans on this sub, she has very main pop girl energy. Ugly Beauty has been on repeat for me

Living With The World: 5 Her voice sounds really good but the song feels dated for me

Don’t Stop: 7.2 Very fun cover and the song sounds surprisingly good in Mandarin (assuming that's the language she sings in, feel free to correct me)

Show Your Love: 7.8

Honey Trap: 6.3 I like parts of the song but it doesn't really come together for me

Butterfly: 5.0 ghost please don't @ me i know you chose to include this because you like it i just...i truly feel nothing.

Honey Trap: 10.0 this reminds me for some reason of blackout by britney spears, which yes is a HIGH compliment. or maybe if late 2000s-early 2010s kylie minogue had been produced by danja.

The Great Artist: 10.0 leave him sis (jolin version)

Sakura Drops: 10.0 this is beautiful. i absolutely love the instrumental - i'm not sure what's making that pinging sound but whatever it is it is gorgeous

Traveling: 10.0 the dance-pop/house transition in this album eats. this song is so good for road trips btw. also they truly ATE on this album

Easy Breezy: 4.0 i just want to log that this album is very hit or miss. unfortunately this is one of the misses for me, but when it hits it HITS. stream kremlin dusk and hotel lobby and wonder 'bout, which features both timbaland and danja!!!

Keep Tryin’: 10.0 i don't care about anything except this song making it to day 3 tbh

Living With The World: 10 wow this song feels like I’m experiencing an entire film. What a way to start off this rate! 

Don’t Stop: 8 love this so much. I’ve heard the s club 7 version but this is actually better 

Show Your Love: 7 this song makes me feel like I’m in a movie theatre in 2002 staying through the end credits of the film so I can stay in the bubble of the movie theatre for a little longer 

Say Love You: 10 obsessed with this song doesn’t even begin to cover it. Before I looked up the lyrics I didn’t know what she was saying but also I totally did. It just completely translated through the music for me. Love this song so much can’t stop listening to it. Was very VERY close to getting my 11. 

Dancing Diva: 7.8

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 8 this song actually totally won me over. I had it rated like a 2 but I came back to it a couple of times because I couldn’t stop thinking about how much I didn’t like it and now I love it. Can’t get enough of the cheese. 

Sun Will Never Set: 5 one of the weaker songs in this rate 

Butterfly: 10 yes. Yes. It’s very Britney blackout era for me in the very best way. This song is ADDICTING. 

Honey Trap: 9 if you teach a spin class and this isn’t on your playlist you legally have to give everyone a refund 

The Great Artist: 7.8 how is it possible this song wasn’t on one of the fast and furious soundtracks??? 

“I”: 7 it’s hard to fully appreciate this one when it’s surrounded by bangers but it’s beautiful 

Play: 5 okay I don’t love this sound but I love that she took it there and tried it. Just doesn’t fully work for me 

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 8.7 mirror mirror on the wall boys are stupid let them fall 

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 6 it’s pretty but I was honestly just bored. I’m not into trying to be inspirational music. 

Ugly Beauty: 10 this song is just COOL. very cool production and it sounds like it could be a hit right now. How is that drop not a popular tik tok sound????? 

Womxnly: 7.5 I feel like I could totally hear this as an Ariana grande song and I mean that in a good way!!

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 8.7 so so so good. And it just came out!??? I’m obsessed. Please God let me dance in a club to this song ASAP. 

Artist: Utada Hikaru

Automatic: 8 all of the 90s/early 00s vibes and I am obsessed. Probably did not need to be as long as it is lol

Addicted To You: 10 okay this gives me Jessica Simpson vibes in a very good way!!!! This song is crazy catchy (even though i don’t know most of the words this song is totally stuck in my head)

Sakura Drops: 5 not my favorite and I don’t like the sound mixing on this one at all. 

Traveling: 9.5 I absolutely love their voice on this one!!!! The last minute of the song is PERFECT. 

Easy Breezy: 10 this song is SO 2004 and that is why it’s a 10!!! It should be illegal for a song to be this freaking catchy. This is one I keep coming back to!! The outro is a literal MESS but I don’t care 

Keep Tryin’: 4 this one didn’t resonate with me at all!!! It’s a song that exists. 

Colors: 7.5

Come Back To Me: 8.5 I have had this song completely stuck in my head since the moment I heard it!! That chorus is just so catchy! 

Flavor Of Life: 6 I just wasn’t excited about this one. Sort of forgettable. 

Beautiful World: 11 this song is so DREAMY and CATCHY and BEAUTIFUL. it was close with a couple other songs but there was no way I wasn’t giving this my 11 

A Bouquet For You: 7.5 their voice is incredible!!! But compared to all of the amazing bops in this rate this one just didn’t excite me 

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 9 this is just stunning. And I assume it’s been used in a million movies because it’s incredible and so cinematic 

Play A Love Song: 7

One Last Kiss: 8 fun and catchy! 

Face My Fears: 8.5 I feel like they were so close to making this INCREDIBLE but it just fell a little short. Sounds very dated I was surprised this was from 2019 (I would’ve guessed 2013/2014)

Sun & Moon: 7 it is so amazing how they cover so many different sounds! I appreciate this one for what it is but the mixing isn’t great and it isn’t my absolute favorite. 

Pink Blood: 8.5 

Artist: BoA

ID; Peace B: 8.5 sounds like all of the pop music I grew up with in the early 00s so so good 

Listen To My Heart: 7 I did bop 

Atlantis Princess: 10  I LOVE THIS SONG so much!!!!! This is one I had to keep coming back to. So catchy and makes me feel like I’m living in the Lindsey Lohan classic film Get a Clue 

Shine We Are !: 9 seeing this song live must be so incredible!!! This one went right on my hot mom walk playlist it’s so fun 

Eat You Up: 10 I would give up my entire life to hear Britney do a cover of this song!!!!! This is so good!!!!

Hurricane Venus: 10 giving Britney blackout in the best way. I would’ve lost my mind to this song in college 

Copy & Paste: 10 this song goes so crazy hard it really does 

Only One: 9 I love the piano in this one so much. So catchy 

Disturbance: 9 really smooth and beautiful 

Kiss My Lips: 7.5 this song is so close to being perfect but it’s a little muddled in the middle. Still so good. 

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 10 I really wanted to hate this one but I kept coming back to it!!! It sounds like an Ariana grande song in a great way!!! Their voices really play together well. 

Lookbook: 9 this would be so good on Drag race!!! Can you imagine! I can. I want it. 

One Shot, Two Shot: 10 obsessed doesn’t get close to how I feel about this song. 

Jazzclub: 7.5 I totally appreciate going for the cool play on jazz but it doesn’t totally work for me. Sounds a little Madagascar movie mixed with Madonna ish. 

Woman: 6 is this score my internalized misogyny talking???

Better: 9 the hook is absolutely killer 

Feedback: 8 had to knock points for the rap. None of these artists need these pointless features

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 8.5 I feel like this duo could do more than this, but it actually sounds better than I remembered

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 10 The MV tells the story of 張淑月 and 邱秀滿, a lesbian couple for 30 years, based on a true story. Basically 張 passed away due to illness, and when asked about the relationship between them, 邱could only answer “she’s my friend.” And when 邱 could finally said “she’s my partner/wife” out loud, it was all too late. I believe that Taiwan gets to be the first place in Asia to legalize same sex marriage has a lot to do with Jolin

Ugly Beauty: 8

Womxnly: 10 This song is a tribute to 葉永鋕. He died in 2000 at the age of 14 or 15. The cause was an accident; he went to the restroom and tripped. However, he was also bullied for his effeminacy, to a point that he dared not go to the restroom when there’s other boys in presence. As a result, he usually went to a restroom that’s relatively remote in the campus, during class, alone. The accident happened during one of his visits to that restroom. It appears like a safety problem in campus, but you would wonder if we could’ve avoided all this had people had a different mindset. Three years after the accident, Taiwan hosted our very first pride march. Whenever Taiwan reached a new landmark in Queer right movement, we would rewind on this tragedy.

Artist: Jolin Tsai: i had never really listened to much chinese language music outside of a few song here and there, so this is pretty much my first time listening to music from taiwan. after listening to all of jolin’s songs, i can definitely see why she’s as popular as she is, and its interesting to see how much she evolved over the course of 20+ years. if i had to pick one era represented in this rate i enjoyed the most, id say the muse era was the best in my opinion.

Living With The World: 6.5 lowkey this sounds like a charity single an artist would release to help spread awareness for keeping the earth clean or something like that

Don’t Stop: 6 i was gonna make a joke about how this sounded like an s club 7 song before i realized that it literally is an s club 7 cover

Show Your Love: 7

Say Love You: 7.5 this is a cute little song :)

Dancing Diva: 9 this is a really weird complaint to make about a song but the part around 2:35 where theres a flute playing sounds really out of tune to me? its honestly really distracting and takes me out of the song a bit which is a shame bc the rest of the song other than that one small bit is really good

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 4 idk guys i think they want you to know that jolin is in the house and dt is in the house

Sun Will Never Set: 6

Butterfly: 7 this sounds like a eurovision song

Honey Trap: 8 extra points for the hyperpop break at the end

The Great Artist: 11 she wasnt lying she IS the great artist. also unrelated to the song itself but the music video for this is a serve as well (EDIT i kept coming back to this song even when i was trying to rate the other artists bc its so good. id say that makes it 11 worthy)

“I”: 9 really pretty sounding, usually not a fan of pop star acoustic ballads but this one is nice

Play: 3.5 i hate when songs have choruses like this. i dont wanna hear fart noises when i listen to music.

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 7.5 toxic girlboss anthem

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 5 good for her for supporting gay rights but this is kinda boring

Ugly Beauty: 8 this is hyperpop

Womxnly: 7 artists taking words that have “man” in them and spelling it as “mxn” isnt the serve they think it is

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 7.5 is she sampling another song in the chorus. it sounds so familar when she goes da da da da but i cant place my finger on it.

Artist: Utada Hikaru: im almost disappointed in myself for how low my scores for utada were. considering ive been a fan of jpop for over a decade and utada was the only artist i was familiar with in this rate before doing it, i was fully expecting to give them my highest in this rate off name recognition alone. unfortunately, the majority of their songs mostly go in one ear and out another for me. im just not a fan of slow rnb/pop songs like so many of their songs are and if you asked me to hum a single note of any of them i probably couldnt recall what they sound like. honestly i feel like i was being too generous with these scores but i dont wanna get accused of sabotage. sorry utada, ill make it up to you by giving simple and clean a 10 in the winners rate.

Automatic: 7 if an american pop girl had released this in english it probably wouldve been a really big hit

Addicted To You: 6 this is about a minute and a half too long

Face My Fears: 8.5 this is the second highest score i gave utada in this rate. what does that say about my taste in music (it means its bad)

Sun & Moon: 9.5 OH YESSS this is what i love. the modern take on jazz sounds so sexy and i love the way their voices compliment each other. also theyre playing tetris in the music video so im giving it an extra half point based on that alone.

Pink Blood: 6 danganronpa characters be like

Artist: BoA: if jolin was mostly highs for me and utada was mostly lows, boa in sitting nicely in the middle between them in terms of enjoyment. im big into electronic pop/hyperpop so i really enjoyed the run of songs from peace b to copy and paste but everything after that is very hit or miss to me bc of the difference of styles. still an enjoyable listening experience considering im not very big on kpop outside of a few songs.

Username: QustoMar

Artist: Jolin Tsai: Jolin is definitely the pop diva of this trio I know the least about. From this rate I feel interested to explore more of her 2010s discography. Her material from her debut to around the late-2000s at least based on these singles is  not my kind of thing. But the artistic journey she has been on from Muse to Ugly Beauty is very interesting to me and I think I’ll explore that more (though I’ve already listened to the Play album quite a bit). There’s a parallel here between Jolin and BoA because both of them have ~2 decade long careers, and both I feel in the late-90s to late-2000s were putting out pretty commercial material, but have really found themselves through the 2010s.

Living With The World: 4 This is a very regular ballad, it doesn't do anything for me.

Don’t Stop: 3 This was trying to be a cute bubblegum pop classic but like… it’s not rlly giving anything :/

Show Your Love: 5

Say Love You: 6

Dancing Diva: 7.5 Oh jolin kinda served here, this is way more my type of song phew. A bop.

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 4 A generic cafe acoustic song with a man, anyways.

Sun Will Never Set: 8

Butterfly: 4 I feel this way about quite a few earlier Jolin Tsai songs here but this one especially, I feel like there’s a lot of potential within the song to have some kind of super grand or big moment and nothing happens. Like I feel more is possible but right now this is just a meh late-2000s electropop beat and vocal delivery that does not match :S

Honey Trap: 6.5 This kinda feels like it is what Butterfly was supposed to be, but I still need more pizzaz and action.

The Great Artist: 8.5 A lot of Jolin's earlier material feels like something great was hidden in there, waiting to be unleashed but was not quite there yet. This song is more what I wanted to see, this has much more personality, production is powerful and punchy, Jolin is switching up her delivery and has way more emotion. Jolin feels like she is finally HERE.

“I”: 5

Play: 11 Oh I adore everything about Play. The production, attitude, music video, everything. IDK it's just all perfection for me. One thing that is quite funny to me is that the fake Sims UI in the video is much cooler graphic design than anything done by EA. If Jolin Tsai produced The Sims, half of the expansions would've been in the base game I just know it.

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 9.5 Objectively, this song is not that good and the lyrics could use some work. HOWEVER, if you embrace this as an iconic early-2010s bop with one of the top divas of China and one of the top divas of Japan… you can get let go of that. This is excellent. I love how Namie did not get up for a moment in the music video in while Jolin powered through the choreo and sets.

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 7 For the most part, Jolin’s ballads get better and better in her discography. This is nice and uplifting, plus I appreciate the dynamic production.

Ugly Beauty: 8.5 An experimental moment. This isn’t an immediate bop the way that a song like Play is, but idk I feel kinda satisfied hearing this after listening to all of Jolin’s other singles because of the artistic journey she has been through.

Womxnly: 9 So so gorgeous and heartfelt.

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 4

Artist: Utada Hikaru: In contrast to BoA and Jolin Tsai, Utada Hikaru figured out their niche immediately from album number one (which is extremely impressive with how young they were???). Yet this hasn’t stopped them from always reinventing and serving some uplifting bops! Like Jolin and BoA, I like seeing how in the last few years, Utada has experimented even more with their artistry, challenging what you may expect from them. This is resulting in new highlights of their discography, 20+ years into their career when many would typically write off an artist.

Automatic: 8.5

Addicted To You: 9 This feels like an obvious successor to Automatic but in a way that does not feel reductive whatsoever, like it truly builds on top of it.

Sakura Drops: 6.5

Easy Breezy: 4.5

Keep Tryin’: 8.5

Colors: 8.5

Come Back To Me: 5.5 If there is one thing to say about this track, it's that the lyrics are DIRECT.

Flavor Of Life: 7

Beautiful World: 6.5 These Utada Hikaru songs around Flavor of Life/Beautiful World feel kinda more by-the-numbers ballads from them if you know what I mean. Like I need more personality from this track!

A Bouquet For You: 5 Belongs at a school graduaton.

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 7

Play A Love Song: 7.5 I think that this more laidback vibe is an interesting switch-up for Utada from their more typical sound while retaining who they are as a music artist.

One Last Kiss: 10 This is so so gorgeous, and I love how this song keeps what you expect in the core of an Utada Hikaru while still switching up the formula. The production in the second half??? EXCELLENCE

Face My Fears: 5

Sun & Moon: 9.5 I love hearing Utada experiment more with their songs because I think this is when they truly shine. Like in this song, the more sensual yet weird vibe is so great, and I think Sheena and Utada's voices really meld together.

Pink Blood: 8.5 The first time I heard this, I was underwhelmed, but it's kinda been a grower.

Artist: BoA:  Just based on the selection of songs here from each artist, I think BoA is my fave in this rate. I’m a pop diva music girlie, and BoA here delivers everything I need . Well, I wasn’t a big fan of her 2000s discog as much when she kinda was just putting out whatever the SM machine had in store. However, once BoA started taking more control over her music starting around the Identity album in 2010, everything changed. She has really carved out her own unique and fresh sound, and I think she improves with every release. Also, what's interesting about BoA is she is the only true "pop diva" of K-Pop. You look at the US or Japan for instance, and you can list so so many different iconic divas, but in K-Pop it's really just BoA... maybe Lee Hyori or IU? But BoA is the only one you could compare to like the Madonna/Janet Jackson level. This puts her in a very unique position within the fast-paced K-Pop industry as sorta the only 'foundational' pop star figure (from my knowledge). I think she wears the glove very well, she embodies so much of why people love K-Pop, and though maybe in the past years she hasn’t been tearing up the MelOn charts, she constantly refines her craft and I love to see it.

ID; Peace B: 4 This whole song kinda sounds like a verse if that makes sense. Like the production and vibe was dying to have some sort of major serve moment, and it never happened.

Listen To My Heart: 5 This sounds like a very very watered down version of He Loves You Not by Dream.

Atlantis Princess: 6.5 This song is cute but I don't see what makes it such an iconic part of BoA's discography? Like it's quite regular, Y2K teen bubblegum pop vibes.

Shine We Are !: 6

Eat You Up: 8.5 I will eat up any trashy late-2000s club banger idgaf.

Hurricane Venus: 9 Objectively, Hurricane Venus may be considered an absolute hot mess of a song, birthed out of the electro-pop craze that took over SM between singles such as Ring Ding Dong, Nu ABO, and Run Devil Run. But imo, Hurricane Venus is camp, it’s iconic, it’s a bop, it serves, yeah…

Copy & Paste: 8 The opening monologue is so contrived I love it, it reminds me of Gina Liano's [deck of cards metaphor](https://twitter.com/nevermindaj/status/1367643014202540036?s=21).

Only One: 9 This is kinda the turning point of BoA's Korean discography when she started becoming who we see her as now. I love hearing how much she has grown as a vocalist, and on top of that the [choreo](https://youtu.be/PQjovLrnvVo)??? Iconic.

Disturbance: 9 I think this is really nice, it's the type of glossy, pop-R&B that would become a signature sound within SM.

Kiss My Lips: 10 This song is so so so good, and it’s very important in BoA’s Korean discography because it lays out the template that many of her following title tracks would follow. One Shot Two Shot, Woman, Better, etc. never would’ve happened without BoA establishing her new identity that began with Only One.

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 7.5 This is a solid and smooth song, not necessarily something you would single out in BoA’s discography but it’s serviceable. More of the very glossy Pop/RnB sound that dominated SM between BoA here and other artists like EXO around this time.

Lookbook: 7 This is a bop but I’ll be honest, it doesn't really make much sense at this point in BoA's discography? Like electro-pop diva singing about how she is the hottest QUEEN of all time is more something that belongs on Hurricane Venus, not something to be released by a post-Only One BoA. It kinda reminded me of Namie Amuro's Genic album more than anything.

One Shot, Two Shot: 10 This is just like the definition of what you think of when you think “K-pop bop.” Like everything about this song is so so polished and infectious, it’s impossible not to adore this imo.

Jazzclub: 6.5 One thing very apparent in BoA's later discography is she loves herself some jazz, which you can see here. I think this song is alright, but it's not necessarily something I would put on by itself which you need for a single.

Woman: 6.5 This song is decent enough, but doesn't really stand up (haha) that well by itself without the performance.

Better: 9 Better both the song and album are a culmination of so much that BoA has done the past 10 years. This song is so powerful and sinister sounding, but it feels effortless and true to BoA. The Better album is the definition of a solid pop album imo, though I would have taken off 1 or 2 of the slower songs and maybe replaced the more "SM Machine" tracks.

Artist: Jolin Tsai: I don’t really follow Cpop but I’m surprised how much I recognize some of her early stuff (granted, Taiwan had quite the grip on our pop culture back in the 2000’s). Also I really liked how she is committed to her musical themes, which is apparent in her later work. I doubt I’ll ever immerse myself into Cpop (given the increasingly tense political atmosphere) so I’m glad this rate made me give her a chance.

Living With The World: 6 Honestly it's so typically 90s but still very pleasant to hear

Don’t Stop: 8 If Kpop has Gee, then Cpop has this. Thank you popheads for unearthing this childhood bop! Apparently this was a cover but this is the version I’m used to.

Show Your Love: 7.5 Key change won me over

Say Love You: 5 I probably heard this one before [2]

Dancing Diva: 8.5 I love the distinctive Cpop flavor of this

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 4 Cute harmonica but ultimately bland. And wtf was that outro

Sun Will Never Set: 11 Idk how this is received within her discography but this just unearthed some nostalgia in me

Butterfly: 7.5 Reminds me of early T-ARA. I can see the hook drilling into my ears very soon (edit: yes it did) 

Honey Trap: 4 Not too fond of this dark club sound, and the outro feels shoehorned

The Great Artist: 8 A lil overproduced, I love the message and lyrical metaphors used

“I”: 10 The instrumentation in Cpop ballads is something else

Play: 10 Very cheeky and irreverent, from the lyrics to the MV

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 9 It's a crime this isn't on Spotify cuz wow what a serve! The drop is off putting at first but I can overlook it

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 9.5 By no means an uncommon message, but I love the lyrical nuances ("love isn't just an abstract art of faith"...damn!)

Ugly Beauty: 7.5 The drop feels a lil empty

Womxnly: 9 Love the message and subtle vocal delivery 

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 8.5 I expect an EDM collab like this to be drained of soul, but thankfully it isn't

Artist: Utada Hikaru: Idk if this is because of their vocals, or maybe just something about Jpop’s aesthetic as a whole, but their music has this distinctive flavor. The instrumentals have a lush quality and the melodies have this tinge of angst and dramatic emotion which gives their discography a certain vibe. My knowledge of Jpop is mostly limited to anime music but you can really tell how the genre is consistent on its own. 

Automatic: 10 What a slick slice of R&B. Probably the best debut single here.

Addicted To You: 6 So much emotion in their voice but ultimately feels boring and too long

Sakura Drops: 5 Sonically unique but doesn't do too much for me

Traveling: 10 Very unique instrumentation, and the lyrics add to its dreamy quality

Easy Breezy: 3 Idk why but it sounds basic and the lyrics made me cringe 

Keep Tryin’: 8.5 Gorgeous vocals, and the MV is adorable. Idk how to feel about those hazy background sound though

Colors: 6 Beautiful lyrics, but ultimately pales in comparison

Come Back To Me: 10  Look I just love late 2000s Stargate R&B production, okay???

Flavor Of Life: 7.5 Their vocals are gorgeous and the instrumental is lush, but this song ultimately lacks punch.

Beautiful World: 6 Very lush arrangement but honestly underwhelming for a 5 minute song

A Bouquet For You: 9 Heartwrenching ballad

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 10 That final minute is hair-raising

Play A Love Song: 10 This is like a dancepop song sent from heaven

One Last Kiss: 8 I get that is one of their frontrunning songs but something's quite amiss. 

Face My Fears: 8 Kinda grown on me after realizing their sonic imprint on this song. Never has dubstep sounded so angelic

Sun & Moon: 4.5 The instrumentation is all over the place

Pink Blood: 7.5 The beat feels off. Not familiar with this anime though so might check this out

Artist: BoA: Running through her discography is almost like taking a Kpop history lesson, you really can see the trends and changes of the genre in the last 2 decades. A lot of her early stuff feels like her talent is being sabotaged by some...questionable production choices but once it hits a certain period, it becomes serve after serve. Definitely the most inconsistent discog of the three, but still enjoyable nonetheless. 

ID; Peace B: 4 those alien noises are obnoxious

Listen To My Heart: 3 honestly she serves vocally I just find the production unbearable

Atlantis Princess: 8 Sounds typical bubblegum pop for its time but still enjoyable. 

Shine We Are !: 7.5 The last minute elevated this

Eat You Up: 4 The MV is a serve but I just dislike how this sounds. Also the lyrics are an awkward mess, serving SNSD - The Boys (English ver.) teas

Hurricane Venus: 0 gurl BYE this excessive AutoTune mess is making my ears bleed. 

Copy & Paste: 5 I think at this point she has grown vocally but the production is really irritating

Only One: 10 FINALLY. A song that does her vocals justice

Disturbance: 9 Cute R&B bop 

Kiss My Lips: 8.5  A very spicy vocal performance

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 7.5 The rap really dragged this down but I enjoy the chorus a lot

Lookbook: 5 This is from 2015 but somehow sounds older than the last 4 songs

One Shot, Two Shot: 6 Banger but those distorted beats in the chorus are driving me nuts

Jazzclub: 9 Expected a more chill song but this will do. Her vocals really elevate this

Woman: 10 Solid performance but the guy whispering “woman” always catches me off guard

Better: 10 maybe recency bias but this was my favorite song of hers on the list. A laid back R&b style that suits her vocals well

Feedback: 9.5 Very summery vibes. Shame the rap verse sabotaged this

Living With The World: 6 I felt like this started off very strong but then it dragged a bit. It also felt like a Disney original soundtrack...

Don’t Stop: 2 also giving me Disney original movie...

Show Your Love: 7 this is so fun, strong 90s vibes

Say Love You: 8 took me on a sonic journey, really interesting melodic progressions 

Dancing Diva: 9 I definitely felt like a dancing main character!

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 5.5 fun karaoke song; actually at first I was indifferent to it, but the further along it went, the more I warmed up to it.

Sun Will Never Set: 6 I think this is one of her more generic dance songs, but it still does it for me!

Butterfly: 6 this is heavy 2000s vibes, it's fun in that regard

Honey Trap: 7 such a dirty beat, needs to be heard in a club

The Great Artist: 7 it's like Charli xcx joined K/DA

“I”: 7 lush ballad, it's as simple as that

Play: 7 I'm actually familiar with this song/era, I should have gotten into Jolin back then!

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 8 queens of women empowerment!

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 8 another lush pop song

Ugly Beauty: 8.5 this is like one of the tightest production I've heard so far, then I saw that it's from 2018 so it makes sense lol

Womxnly: 5 this sounds like any other trop pop inspired song

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 7 I realized this is actually such a pleasant bop! it's not pushing the boundaries of pop but it's still great

Artist: Utada Hikaru

Automatic: 8 such a chill track, pulls you in and lets you float with ease

Addicted To You: 7 another stellar track, Utada Hikaru is an ICON OKAY

Sakura Drops: 8.3 they never misses, this early spring-esque song is just another example of that

Traveling: 7.5 I love how this track also fits into the early spring/winterish sonic elements found in Sakura Drops. I do think it dragged a little too long, but it's still a great song

Easy Breezy: 8 Utada can pen some of the cutest, brightest lyrics in pop, and this whole song is an example of them doing just that.

Keep Tryin’: 7.5 so otherworldly, the chorus slams into you, but at times I felt like the verses didn't have that strong of a follow through

Colors: 5 wasn't so excited about this one, in fact it was one I kind of wanted to fast forward through because it was kind of boring...

Come Back To Me: 6 would have given this generic song a lower score, but Utada's voice and melodies are what make this standard 2000s love song unique

Flavor Of Life: 7 this song has some of the elements that make them the monarch of video game OST. Chorus is amazing, but other parts were disinteresting.

Beautiful World: 9 this was one of the songs that got me to seriously dive into Utada, and for that, I'm forever thankful

A Bouquet For You: 7 has a classic sound without sounding too predictable or familiar!

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 7.5 a very delicate ballad, it doesn't put you to sleep like I expect ballads to

Play A Love Song: 4 this would be rated higher but it melodically is too... common? I am just used to them really being unique in this area but this is like a lot of pop songs.

One Last Kiss: 7.5 Heart Station meets the 2020s, what's not to love

Face My Fears: 8 I'm surprised I really like this song because I think I've personally strayed away from that hard EDM sound but ugh the way Utada and Skrillex combine their strengths is just amazing

Sun & Moon: 6.5 love a jazzy duo, at time it felt too busy though, but that's also why I ended up giving it a slightly higher score because it's daring

Pink Blood: 7 here we see Utada bringing in their classic sounds with this new decade, and I think this is a very good attempt at that

Artist: BoA

ID; Peace B: 7 love this blend of rock inspired rnb, amazing for a debut album!

Listen To My Heart: 7.5 groovy, BoA knows how to do rnb pop!!

Atlantis Princess: 6 good song but personally not attached to it

Shine We Are !: 4 also not attached, kind of forgot it was playing...

Eat You Up: 10 I do feel biased and predictable for giving the only completely English song and probably most recognizable song for U.S. listeners a 10, but this is honestly the perfect pop song regardless of spoken language. It still holds up after all these years, or maybe that's there nostalgia talking

Hurricane Venus: 8 I loved this, title is amazing so I should have known a bop was in store

Copy & Paste: 8 I love BoA when she's spicy, I think this is one of my favorite spoken-word song intros ever

Only One: 7 very cute, easy listening

Disturbance: 4 got bored with this one real fast...

Kiss My Lips: 8 what a sultry track 

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 3 I felt like I knew exactly what I was gonna get from this song... but I loved the chorus

Lookbook: 2 an immature sound for someone with a long career tbh, the chorus had so much potential to be more interesting

One Shot, Two Shot: 7 one of her newer songs but I think it's one of her cooler singles. Has the elements SM was really pushing in a lot their artists during the late 2010s, which is why I brought my score down slightly... at the same time though, I think BoA stands out uniquely. I actually had a really hard time rating this one because I do think the MV really elevates it (which I think happens frequently in Kpop)

Jazzclub: 6.5 I do like the vaudeville type sound but I'm not obsessed with it. it's the perfect length though for this type of song.

Woman: 5 I do like it, but again, not attached to it.

Better: 6 unfortunately I do think BoA is better than this... it did get better in the second half but it was a little too late

Feedback: 4.5 I felt like too much was going on to really get into the song. And then the rap part brought it down.

Atlantis Princess: 8 the way the kpop fandom acts you’d think this song saved kpop but it really does sound like every other song from this era. The first thought I actually had is that it sounds like the 1st generation kpop version of Hyokori Hyotanjima

Shine We Are !: 6 you could tell me this was an S Club 7 cover and I’d believe it 

Eat You Up: 11 this is Cannibal for kpop stans ~~and it’s also better~~

Hurricane Venus: 8 this was really the turning point in BoA’s career. It started off her whole badass girl crush era. And please don’t come at me for calling it “badass girl crush”, it’s the closest approximation I had. Also the Jo Kwon cover… exists.

Copy & Paste: 5

Only One: 10 another turning point for BoA - where she transformed into badass mature woman even though she was only like 25 at this point. But such is the fickle nature of the kpop industry, where being over 20 at debut makes you an old maid.

Disturbance: 7 those opening piano chords are the rhythm to “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” but too bad it’s not as musically interesting as that.

Kiss My Lips: 2 this is about as sexy as crying on your floor to Once in a Lifetime 

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 3 I’m sorry but I will never forget the music video with Sehun as the love interest… Sehun is like the least sexy member of EXO. Also the rap sucks.

Lookbook: 6.5 the first representative from BoA’s Japanese discography, gosh I wish Meri Kuri was in here.

One Shot, Two Shot: 9 dance bops are where BoA shines best, such as this banger. The wub wub isn’t distracting, the vocals compliment BoA right and I guess it’s just good 

Jazzclub: 7 I wish she’d committed to the bit and made this a straight up jazz style song like Something. And I never want to hear BoA do scatting again

Woman: 10 the Girlboss-ification of BoA

Better: 8 this could be better 

Feedback: 0  I know she’s been at it for way longer… but this sounds like a bad Chungha impression

The Great Artist: 8 I liked this a lot more than her other late 00s/early 10s electro-pop bops tbh. The chorus was catchy, the video had a BUDGET and it was just good overall?

Artist: Jolin Tsai: A lot of her early stuff just really feels generic and/or didn't stick with me, but over time I found it to improve, but I think that ultimately she's the weakest of the 3 artists here.

Living With The World: 6.2 i feel like I've heard variations of this type of soppy ballad 100 times over, the guitar kicking in halfway through is a nice touch though. The MV is super camp.

Don’t Stop: 4 unfortunately for Jolin, I hate this obnoxiously cheesy kinda pop, so I don't exactly like the original song or her version. It feels so obnoxiously cheery, like it would be playing on the intro to Degrassi

Show Your Love: 8.3 this kinda reminds me of informercial music, but like, one that would play in a fever dream

Say Love You: 6.6 that chorus kinda just… never kicked in huh

Dancing Diva: 8.9 I love how dramatic this track feels, with those huge boomy drums in the verses and the little wind chimey keys, it's got a really cool sound.

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 5.2 this instrumental is NOT doing it for me, it sounds like something that would play in a western/desert town in a JRPG

Sun Will Never Set: 10 Really light and pleasant and dreamy, this just clears my mind and makes me happy

Butterfly: 8.5 when I watched this with the MV I liked it a lot more, without it, It just felt kinda like a generic bop

Honey Trap: 7.5 This was going great until we got to the outro

The Great Artist: 10 I love everything about this, the production is fantastic (that harpsichord in the bridge!!!), the lyrics are really interesting and the MV is absolutely gorgeous

“I”: 6.8 Lyrically interesting but musically it does nothing for me

Play: 10 ok the song is kinda bad but the MV is so good i don’t care

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 6.9 this is the east asian equivalent of cascada

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 6.7 the MV did some hard carrying for the emotional weight of this song

Ugly Beauty: 8.6

Womxnly: 10 The production on this track is so interesting, it's got this nostalgic, sad, kinda cold feel but also incredibly danceable, thematically the song is really beautiful, and it just really comes together as a delicate, yet upbeat track (that somehow manages to get airhorns to not sound obnoxious?!)

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 6 this is just generic, I have nothing else to say

Artist: Utada Hikaru: My favourite artist coming into the rate, and probably still my favourite coming out. They would be my highest average if not for the couple of duds in this tracklist, but I generally think that their discography has aged the best, they had a really futuristic sound, and their newest work continues to be innovative and unique, and I'm excited to listen to their discog more, and for what comes next.

Automatic: 7.9 classic 90's R&B but really well refined and smooth, what's not to like?

Addicted To You: 8.2 HEAVEN mix is an appropriate name, cause the track really feels very floaty and light and dreamy (although the underwater mix outsold)

Sakura Drops: 10 a beautiful, lush soundscape of divine strings, crazy synths and beautiful vocals, and the MV is breathtaking

Traveling: 11 idk where we're going but I am here for the ride

Easy Breezy: 6.4 honestly, they knew what they were writing, and how camp it was, the world just wasn't ready (but the song itself is kinda weak overall honestly)

Keep Tryin’: 10 "I don't care about anything" same bestie

Colors: 7.4

Come Back To Me: 8.4 this sounds like a song Leona Lewis would turn down

Flavor Of Life: 9.5 I want my life to taste like red skittles, but in reality it probably tastes more like purple skittles

Beautiful World: 7.2

A Bouquet For You: 7.3 why yes, I am being balladphobic rn

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 9.8 this is a song that I know would resonate even more knowing the context of it, but the ending of this is absolutely phenomenal wow

Play A Love Song: 8

One Last Kiss: 10 SO pretty, a super romantic song with AG Cook production? The vibes on this are so incredibly pretty, and it feels like a great mix of their early stuff with minimalist pop sensisbilities, and it works SO well

Face My Fears: 5 The song conflicts me so much. The verses and pre-chorus are geninely great, Utada's voice, vocals and lyrics are amazing as always, and skrillex's production there works well, but that drop is SO. FUCKING. UGLY!!! It sounds like every youtuber intro circa 2013, and it actively takes me out of the song, and it makes me SO ANGRY BECAUSE  I ENJOY THE OTHER PARTS!!! But it makes the whole thing unlistenable!!

Sun & Moon: 8.7 This feels too sophisticated and fancy to be listening to on popheads, it feels illegal, like I've snuck into a jazz lounge for smart people and I'm witnessing something profound that I should not be.

Pink Blood: 10 this is so different and spacious but I adore it! It almost reminds me of the Mirror's Edge soundtrack, in a really clean, futuristic way.

Artist: BoA: BoA may not be my favourite artist overall here, but she has incredible consistency, and even her "worst" tracks in this rate are honestly still great, and I think that's how she ended up with my highest average.

ID; Peace B: 9.6 this is just fantastic late 90's/early 00's r&b pop with that insanely overboard overfilled production where they just throw all the sounds at the wall and see what sticks, I love it so much

Listen To My Heart: 9.7 this lowkey sounds like something from the Splatoon OST

Atlantis Princess: 7.7

Shine We Are !: 8.1 a cute smiley bop (I hope it's happy it feels happy idk maybe it's about war or something I didn't look up the lyrics)

Eat You Up: 7.6 this would be a 10 if it was available internationally on Spotify (yes I am being petty she is denying me this bop)

Hurricane Venus: 7.1 oh this production really has not aged well has it?

Copy & Paste: 9 those little piano chords in the post-chorus sound so… sus

Only One: 8.8 we love a girlboss that writes and produces her own material

Disturbance: 7.8 it's ok, but  I feel like I've probabyl heard this playing in a café at some point

Kiss My Lips: 10 this is so sexy and smooth and hot and im flushed wow

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 9.1 I love the Persona 4 soundtrack

Lookbook: 10 This feels like a song that would appear in a Japanese version of the Pop Rap Rate (in a good way)

One Shot, Two Shot: 10 this is basic bitch synthpop, good thing i'm a basic bitch

Jazzclub: 7 this is kinda a mess, it gets so repetitive so quickly, it sounds like a worse version of we no speak americano

Woman: 9.3 using the sound of high heels walking as percussion… truly innovative

Better: 9.2 this *better* do well!

Feedback: 9.4 it's summery, it's cute, it's a vibe, it feels like driving down the coast of Nice in a convertible

Artist: Jolin Tsai: Jolin is the artist I had heard most in the rate before doing it, having heard *Play* and some of her other songs, plus the only one who does music in a language I can almost kind of understand if it's written out for me, so I'm biased here. Still I like her electropop/dance-pop style a lot, even if it's not as experimental as Utada's music nor as vibey as BoA's. I like pretty much everything she's done here, plus she has consistently neat visuals (but then, don't they all)

Living With The World: 6 So cheesy but kind of cute. 

Don’t Stop: 7 Well this sure unlocked some memories.

Show Your Love: 11 A total banger and the peak of the cheesy dance-pop in this rate. It came out in 2000 yet sounds like a 1990 track by Madonna, only sung in Mandarin. I love this lmao. It's ridiculous and amazing.

Say Love You: 6 A very 90s song given the time it came out.

Dancing Diva: 9 That vaguely Middle Eastern sample is so cheesy but this is still a banger. Also, the bridge is awesome. 

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 4 Oh no. I get that they're not being all that serious here (Jolin literally bursts out laughing at the end), but this is way too corny. 

Sun Will Never Set: 8 I want to see that movie where Jolin plays a secret agent of which Ghost-Quartet spoke. That sounds awesome.

Butterfly: 9 This is a very weird coincidence, but around 2010-11 I took Mandarin lessons from a Taiwanese lady named Butterfly. She said I was doing fairly well and often said my handwriting was good, but I pissed her off a lot by not showing up for and rescheduling lessons. I hope she's doing well now and forgives me. Anyway this song is good. I doubt that Butterfly would like it much though since she seemed to be really into ballads as far as C-pop goes. 

Honey Trap: 9 I totally hear the comparison with *X* here, and also the synths make me think of *The Fame*.  Also I'm not at all surprised Jolin would do voguing since I said in my comment on "Show Your Love" that it sounded like 90s Madonna.

The Great Artist: 8 This bangs and I agree, I love the futuristic vibe of the video and the lyrics are cool.

“I”: 7 This makes me think of one of Faye Wong's ballads from the 90s (can't remember which one). It's pretty.

Play: 10 Yeah this is aggressively early-2010s club music (god that EDM drop lol) but it bangs so I'm turning it up. Idc.

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 9 Unapologetic EDM banger; it slaps.

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 7 This is dramatic but it's not bad. The bridge is a nice ""ethereal"" moment. Also I had no idea this was a song about LGBT rights so that's based. 

Ugly Beauty: 7 This was one of the most interesting songs to read about. The concept being about body image and self-doubt was based at least, which made up for the song itself being kind of mid.

Womxnly: 8 As well as having a cool atmospheric sound, I like that this song (like "Ugly Beauty") also has a good concept, being against bullying and for acceptance of gender nonconformity. Once again Jolin seems based as hell.

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 8 R3HAB must never sleep because that dude is everywhere, but I can't say I dislike his work. 

Artist: Utada Hikaru: Utada is an artist I'd heard a lot about before doing this rate, but never heard before ... or so I thought, because it turns out I did know a few of these songs vaguely from *Neon Genesis Evangelion* and *Kingdom Hearts* (which I've never played oddly). I had heard they had a more experimental approach to music, which checks out on a lot of these tracks - many of the most interesting or unique instrumentals come from their tracks in this playlist. I didn't love everything here, but there were quite a few highs. I feel like perhaps Utada is not quite my thing but I plan to listen to at least a couple of their albums and see what they're like, so the rate succeeded at doing that at least. Maybe they'll grow on me, time will tell.

Automatic: 7 Yeah this is *very* 90s R&B, but I like it.

Addicted To You: 6 Yeah. My pet peeve is pop songs that throw around addiction and drug metaphors like they're going out of style. This is okay though.

Sakura Drops: 9 I really love that looping synth. It adds a lot to the song.

Traveling: 8 bop

Easy Breezy: 4 "I'm Japanese-y" is certainly a lyric that exists. Anyway. an okay enough song, I guess, aside from the dubious lyrics. I feel like I heard a million songs during the 2000s with this exact beat. It's nothing special. I almost gave it my 0 but felt like being nice and spared it.

Keep Tryin’: 5 Really don't like the melody in the chorus, sadly. The rest is alright.

Colors: 8 Normally I hate songs with lots of sudden tempo changes but this is pretty good.

Come Back To Me: 6 Not expecting a ballad in English in this rate but it's alright. I can hear the Mariah influence here. It's nothing special though.

Flavor Of Life: 9 Idk why but this is giving me the fuzzy brain chemicals. It's like ASMR.

Beautiful World: 10 I do not remember this being in NGE despite having watched all of it and the movies only last summer, but it is a really pretty song. This sounds very 2000s in the best way.

A Bouquet For You: 6 Why is this making me think of "Yesterday" by the Beatles? Oh, it's the strings I guess. 

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 4 I definitely don't remember this being in the NGE movies either, but it's ... alright. The title is better than the song, honestly. It's just another piano ballad with a dramatic guitar lead. Idk like what is this, "November Rain"

Play A Love Song: 8 How to do a piano-heavy song well in this rate.

One Last Kiss: 9 Okay how did I not know Utada did so many NGE songs this is making me uneasy I thought I'd never heard their music before this rate even though they were on my radar. Anyway this is really good. The vocal line is beautiful, but also listen closely to the instrumental tracks; there's so much going on there.

Face My Fears: 8 I guess someone has to defend this song from dubstep haters even though yeah that drop is a choice. Otherwise it's pretty great though.

Sun & Moon: 7 I feel like Sheena Ringo is too WaCkY for me to get the appeal of her music but this is good. I'm a big jazz fan and there's a strong influence from that genre here especially the piano. This song is kind of a mess but I appreciate they went for something different here.

Pink Blood: 9 Maybe the weirdest concept of any song in this rate but I'm for it. It's also a neat song in its own right. Listen to the bass and drums and how they interact with the keyboard. 

Artist: BoA: Boa is the artist I knew least about before this rate and the only one I had definitely never heard before. After hearing these songs I thought she was my least favourite in the rate, but I did enjoy most of her songs, and I gave her a couple of 10s even, so I must like her.  In fact, she got a slightly higher average from me than Utada. :thinking: Also, now I finally understand the difference between BoA and Bôa, who are a British alt-rock band who did the theme to the anime *Serial Experiments Lain*, which is a good show and a great song but they have absolutely nothing to do with BoA the K-pop artist. (Though it would be funny if she covered that song like I'd get a big kick out of it.) Anyway, glad I did this rate! I discovered a lot of cool songs I wouldn't have otherwise heard and now I'm just using this space to say that so hi /u/Ghost-Quartet thanks for hosting it

ID; Peace B: 7 This whole instrumental is so early 90s. I'm for it. Anyway, I guess I can add BoA to my list of artists who have named things after their screennames, which includes Charli XCX, Grimes and Hana among others I can't remember. New playlist idea. :thinking:

Listen To My Heart: 8 The vocals go off but also note that synth bass (at least I think that's what it is, or fretless bass with some kind of effect) is awesome.

Atlantis Princess: 7 look I've got nothing I'm super tired and have been doing this rate for hours now but this is good

Shine We Are !: 7 !

Eat You Up: 7 I always knew "Toxic" was an OVERRATED song (fight me) and this song being produced by the guy who wrote it PROVES it nah I'm just trolling. This song has weird lyrics and sonically it's trying too hard to be Gaga-like, but I don't hate it, though it should be sped up a bit. Otherwise it's fine I guess. (But for real "Toxic" is a bit overrated tho :eyes:)

Hurricane Venus: 9 ~~Rocket number 9, take off to the planet, to the planet Venus~~ No really, I hear a lot of Gaga influence on BoA, and I'm not mad about it. This is a banger. 

Copy & Paste: 10 The vaguely Middle Eastern hook to this sounds like pop music that would be playing in the background in the futuristic city setting of *Blade Runner* and I mean that in the best way possible.

Only One: 6 I wonder how many songs have the same name as this I feel like it's a lot

Disturbance: 8 This is what happens when you take chill lo-fi beats and speed them up

Kiss My Lips: 9 shoutout to the iconic /u/cloudbustingmp3 who loves this song and the taste that is on display here ... this funk groove is TIGHT what a SMOOTH song

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 7 Yet another 90s throwback in this rate and it's not bad

Lookbook: 8 this is the exact kind of electro trash we love here isn't it

One Shot, Two Shot: 8 Maybe being kind of generous here but it is a big bop

Jazzclub: 6 This title is confusing because this is not even close to jazz (if anything it's more like klezmer music) but anyway it's kind of catchy. (Oh wait you said electro-swing? Okay I can kind of see it idk.)

Woman: 8 look a predictable high score for an electropop song here on pop heads dot com

Better: 6 This has a very solid groove but not much else going for it I fear. wait maybe her second verse is pretty good idk

Feedback: 7 I like the funk guitar but this rap verse can go, unlike some of the other rap features in this rate. Otherwise a pretty good song. I love the chorus.

Show Your Love: 9 the videos in this rate ARE required viewing

Say Love You: 4 Sorry, there is just- so many ideas going on here, and most of them don’t work. This song had lost me from the start.

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 8 it feels like we’re on the way to kill a man are we gonna kill a man

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 10 why am i crying

Play A Love Song: 9 i like to imagine this is a direct sequel to flowing cherry blossoms where i’m just crying in the club and just want something cheesy to recover myself

One Last Kiss: 11 they’re an icon, they’re a legend, and they are the moment, come on now

Face My Fears: 3 Now, as you certainly remember, this was my 0 in Videogame Vocals. To quote myself, ‘this sounds like half minecraft youtubers intro, half song that got passed down like fourteen times before being sung by julia michaels on a movie soundtrack’ which perhaps was a bit harsh. It’s the truth, but harsh. I just think it’s absolutely insane the decrease in quality from Simple and Clean to this, but- was all the hatred warrented? … yes lmao

Sun & Moon: 8 me when they ask what is the generation 7 of pokemon games called

Pink Blood: 9 why are you reminding me i am a danganronpa fan i did not need to be attacked tonight

Atlantis Princess: 8 I like all the build up, but I wish it’d explode in the final chorus

Shine We Are !: 8 SHINee your turn

Eat You Up: 10 this MV looks like a mid 10s youtube cover but i have nostalgia so this is a compliment

Hurricane Venus: 10 *aggressive breakdancing*

Copy & Paste: 9 me grabbing the scores from the pastebin to the google doc and from the google doc to the reddit message

Only One: 10 oh she sounds lovely doesn’t she

Disturbance: 6 I’m not joking I listened to this song 5 times in a row trying to come up with something distinctive about it and I got nothing

Kiss My Lips: 7 are there gonna be any social distancing jokes or is it sasha velour dont joke about that

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 8 wait a minute…. Who ARE you

Don’t Stop: 8.5

Show Your Love: 9 Feels like I'm being transported inside a Sega Dreamcast world and I'm living for it.

Say Love You: 8

Dancing Diva: 9 Loving the Bollywood vibe behind it.

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 6 It's giving me Animal Crossing with hip hop sensibilities playing during the end credits.

Sun Will Never Set: 8 Feels like a hug from an old friend that you haven't seen in a long time.

Butterfly: 9 Homegirl coming after Gaga's wig. Surrender!

Honey Trap: 9 Notice how there's a clear cut between her sweet pop songs and edgy diva songs. I feel this is where it transitions.

The Great Artist: 8 Jolin asserting herself to the other two flop girlies.

“I”: 5 A bit too saccharine for my taste, I'm afraid.

Play: 10 Rhianna found dead in a ditch with a long pink ribbon wrapped around her neck.

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 8

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 7 r/popheads music taste in general

Ugly Beauty: 9.5

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 8.5

Automatic: 10 An automatic win for Utada! 

Addicted To You: 9 This only asserts my disappointment that we were robbed of getting a 2000s futuristic R&B rate.

Sakura Drops: 6

Easy Breezy: 5 Japaneasy really? I american't koreaneven with you right now.

Keep Tryin’: 7.5

Flavor Of Life: 7 Who's gonna tell Utada to grab that food item on their shoulder? It lowers your damage percentage.

Beautiful World: 7

A Bouquet For You: 6

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 5

Play A Love Song: 6.5

One Last Kiss: 10

Face My Fears: 11 If this song wins, this will be THE year for both Utada and KH stans, since it would be the second time they won and I would be grateful for witnessing both events. Also, did anyone notice that the piano chords sound identical to And Dream of Sheep by Kate Bush?

Sun & Moon: 7

Pink Blood: 8

Artist: BoA

ID; Peace B: 9 An interesting blend of disco strings and beats that sounds straight out of an Aaliyah song, topped with some campy opera. BoA ain't pulling no punches.

Listen To My Heart: 8

Atlantis Princess: 7

Shine We Are !: 8

Eat You Up: 10 BoA's threatening to eat up her rivals, Utada thinking this will be an easy breezy win, Jolin's snatching these bitches' wigs with her honey trap. Competition's heated!

Hurricane Venus: 8 Hurricane PENIS

Username: fkadizzy-1804

Artist: Jolin Tsai

Living With The World: 3 bonus point for the guitar solo but this is just too sappy and corny for me

Don’t Stop: 7 fun and cute with some great production flourishes but not really a standout

Show Your Love: 7.5 catchy af although I’m not sold on the kind of bored almost speak-singing vocal style she’s got going on here

Say Love You: 8

Dancing Diva: 9 yes I’m a sucker for booming fuzzed-out drums&bass and a bouncy synth line. This slaps

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 3 and now we’ve taken a hard left back into sapsville. Can’t deny the chorus is an earworm tho

Sun Will Never Set: 10 for whatever reason, instead of reading as corny/overdone, in this song EVERY musical cliche just works for me and by the end I’m losing my damn mind

Butterfly: 9.5

Honey Trap: 6 when she says “1, 2, 3, 4” at the start of the song she literally sounds EXACTLY like someone else saying “1, 2, 3, 4” in another song but I don’t know which one, I think it might be Kylie Minogue, but anyway it’s driving me nuts. More to the point, I can’t really make up my mind on how I feel about this song. The verses are kind of compelling but the pre-chorus and chorus bug the crap out of me. I like the bridge/breakdown too though.

The Great Artist: 8 most of this song I LOVE but I have to dock a point because some sections do drag on a bit

“I”: 4

Play: 7.5

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 7.5

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 6.5 of the ballads/“message” songs so far this one is definitely the best, and has some quite lovely moments and a few interesting production elements

Ugly Beauty: 6 this has some of the best production of all the Jolin Tsai songs in this rate so I wanna rate it highly but I just… don’t… like it all that much

Womxnly: 8.5 I hate that this has that airhorn sound effect in the background because it really comes close to ruining an otherwise gorgeous song

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 7.5

Artist: Utada Hikaru

Automatic: 8 I can’t fault the slinky beat or the angelic harmonies or Utada’s sweet, earnest vocals, but if I’m being critical there is something that feels a tiny bit unfinished/unpolished about this song. The line between chill and boring can be fine and this song just barely walks it imo

Addicted To You: 9 this delivers peak early-era Utada drama, complete with ear-candy production and slightly strained, pitchy vocals, and I love every second of it

Sakura Drops: 10 those opening synths ring out and boom! I’m in another world

Traveling: 10 considered purely as a pop banger, this may well be the best song in the rate

Easy Breezy: 4 something about the production and vocal stylings make this feel eerily like a Flavours of Entanglement era Alanis Morissette reject. All I can say is I wish it were Kremlin Dusk or You Make Me Want To Be A Man instead

Keep Tryin’: 10 this song is late-night loneliness and yearning distilled

Colors: 9

Come Back To Me: 3 truly one of the most meh, generic songs Utada has ever made. At least the missteps on Exodus were interesting

Flavor Of Life: 9

Beautiful World: 11 it’s only a masterpiece, right? Somehow it perfectly marries these catchy, bouncy instrumentals and driving groove with ethereal piano riffs and wistful strings and reverb-soaked vocals and lush harmonies and if I could only listen to one song for the rest of my life it wouldn’t be this one just bc Cloudbusting by Kate Bush exists… but if it didn’t, Beautiful World would be next in line

A Bouquet For You: 8.5

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 10 Heartbreaking and gorgeous, an agonizingly close runner-up for my 11. Utada’s vocals are at their best; the piano track is similarly beautiful (and perfectly encapsulates the title); and the moment towards the end when the drums kick in, and the ensuing build and climax, is some of the purest catharsis in Utada’s whole discography.

Play A Love Song: 9.5 one of my favourite things about Utada’s recent work is the way they’ve started to play (even more) with tempo and time signatures and composition/song structure. It makes everything such a delight to listen to. I’d never heard this song before this rate and I was constantly going “oooh” as I was taken through another unexpected twist or flourish. I do find the high-pitched buzzing synth in the chorus a tiny bit annoying tho.

One Last Kiss: 9

Face My Fears: 9.5 idc I love the production on this song

Sun & Moon: 5 I want to love this and on paper I should - it’s jazzy and ambitious and interesting! It has Shiina Ringo! And a harp drop! - but it just… doesn’t sound good to me. Too noisy.

Pink Blood: 8

Artist: BoA

ID; Peace B: 6.5 a cinematic banger and that quack-y synth motif just adds a certain charm. But it’s also… kind of dull?

Listen To My Heart: 9

Atlantis Princess: 6

Shine We Are !: 4.5

Eat You Up: 3.5

Hurricane Venus: 4

Copy & Paste: 5

Only One: 9

Disturbance: 8

Kiss My Lips: 7.5 the production on this is really really interesting and I guess I like the song but I don’t LOVE it y’know?

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 5.5

Lookbook: 8 the melody in the chorus could probably be a tiny bit catchier but the vibe and energy on this are so good it doesn’t matter

One Shot, Two Shot: 6.5 the verses are sooooo good and atmospheric and then the chorus just grates on me

Jazzclub: 8

Woman: 6 this grew with me, but as with most of the mid-tempo-banger style BoA songs in this rate, part of me also finds it weirdly plodding/hard to listen to

Better: 8

Feedback: 10 best for last for BoA & a strong finish for the rate!

Artist: Jolin Tsai: I’m more familiar with Jolin Tsai the public figure then I am her music and I am very excited to check it out for this rate :) 

Living With The World: 4  the guitar is nice and so is her voice, I’m just bored 

Don’t Stop: 6 this is a very 2000s song and it reminds me of a musical 

Show Your Love: 6

Say Love You: 3

Dancing Diva: 10 i love this kind of instrumental SO MUCH

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 8 this is cute.

Sun Will Never Set: 5

Butterfly: 8.5  I think it’s funny how well this album did commercial compared to its critical reception. 

Honey Trap: 8.8

The Great Artist: 10  I really like the use of effect on her voice, and the song is very bright and fun and dynamic to me. 

“I”: 4 I’m too impatient to care about ballads. 

Play: 8

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 7.5

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 11 the lesbian song gets my 11. If you’re unfamiliar with her I would look into her lgbt activism because while BoA has sung at pride event in 2009 and utada is queer, I feel like a lot of pop stars get credit for being allies just for being nice to lgbt fans when Tsai has had explicitly queer music videos advocating for marriage equality and had those songs banned in some countries for it and signed petitions in favor of it. Like she’s not someone who waited for public support to be open about her stance and i really respect her for not being daunted by potential criticism or loss of profits. 

Ugly Beauty: 10

Womxnly: 9

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 7.5 i feel like everyone likes EDM way more then me? It’s not a genre I hate but also I find it very uninspired. 

Artist: Utada Hikaru: Utada is the singer here I am way more familiar with because of video games and anime whether it’s replaying osts for video games I did not play or replaying Poppin’. 

Automatic: 9 lol it makes sense so many songs in this rate a very 2000s but also it’s so funny because this album is from the year I was born so my first reaction is just “this isn’t vintage but it’s dated”.  However ‘99 babies should stick together including me and this album. 

Addicted To You: 7

Sakura Drops: 7 I feel like the twinkly instrumental here is also very 2000s. 

Traveling: 7

Easy Breezy: 3 I don’t like the lyricism or the instrumental

Keep Tryin’: 6

Colors: 8

Come Back To Me: 8 I love this album so much. I was robbed of Utada being a US pop icon and honestly we deserve them giving up their US citizenship lol

Flavor Of Life: 7.5 I really like Utada’s voice, though I think this song doesn’t do much for me because I am of a generation with a shorter attention span. I do think some of instrumental choices are interesting and maybe would make more immediate sense to me if I spoke any Japanese. 

Beautiful World: 8 Utada is the only person whose ballads I am interested in.  

A Bouquet For You: 8 this song reminds how shocking I still find their mother’s suicide. I hope she’s resting in peace and wish her friends and family closure. 

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 9

Play A Love Song: 7.5

One Last Kiss: 10 my username is an NGE reference lmao

Eat You Up: 9 I don’t like the yum yum lyrics but otherwise I like it a lot and it’s very fun. 

Hurricane Venus: 7

Copy & Paste: 10 this intro was kinda misandrist and I love that.

Jazzclub: 7.5 this song’s pacing reminds me of being overly caffeinated but in a fun way

Woman: 10 feminist anthem 

Better: 9 I really like the strings in this song . I also really like the dance performance for this. 

Feedback: 8.5 I find her voice a little high for my taste but I love her style and Charisma so much and I loved the blue outfits here. Also this comeback always makes me laugh because I remember the blog Asian Junkie pretending as a joke that she was a newcomer to get more people in his readers interested in her and just him complaining about her scattered media presence around that time.

Show Your Love: 9.2 Disco is back baby (in 2000)!

Sakura Drops: 6 Not really a fan of the breathing (?) in this tbh. But I do like the chorus.

Traveling: 8.6 Now this is a classic dance floor bop.

Easy Breezy: 7.5 I love the chorus but I’m sorry these verses do not sound great. 

Keep Tryin’: 8.5 I like the guitar instrumental in this one quite a bit. And that xylophone (?) bridge.

Colors: 7.2 Appropriate title because this song is quite vibrant.

Come Back To Me:  6 This sounds pretty good but whoever this song is addressed to needs to stay away lol.  If they cheat once...

Listen To My Heart: 4.5 The hook is loud but not necessarily great.

Atlantis Princess: 11 Some of the best things about 2000s pop are embodied right here.

Shine We Are !: 3 Bruh why does the instrumental feel way too loud compared to the vocals.

Eat You Up: 4.1 Some bad Britney vibes here.

Hurricane Venus: 7.4 Some nice Britney vibes here.

Don’t Stop: 7.8 I can’t believe this is real…….. she really covered an s club song 

Show Your Love: 10 Yeah this is actually a really fantastic slice of dance pop 

Say Love You: 6.8

Dancing Diva: 7.7

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 4 OUR LOVE IN THE HOUSE

Sun Will Never Set: 8 There are a few songs before this that I like a lot, but THIS is the start of the Jolin music I really like 

Butterfly: 10 GOD this is so much fun. This isn’t *quite* my favorite version of Jolin yet, but this is pretty fantastic dance pop

Honey Trap: 9

The Great Artist: 10 THIS is where I truly fall hard for Jolin’s music. The production has aged a little, but it slaps and EVERYTHING is here artistically - the lyrics, the visuals, and a sense of Jolin being the absolute, undeniable center of it all. She OWNS this song completely

“I”: 9.5

Play: 10 THIS IS CAMP AND IT FUCKS ITS UNSTOPPABLE 

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 10 I did a song called “I am not yours” for choir! It was a really touching song about unrequited love, and it was easily my favorite of the concert. Anyway, Jolin and Namie could castrate me and I’d think they were right to do so. 

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 10 This is perhaps the best ballad in the rate 

Ugly Beauty: 10 I’m sorry ghost’s phcj “fetishes in Jolin videos” shitpost is all I can think of when I hear this now 

Womxnly: 9

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 7.5 this is generic and feels cheap but it bops?

Artist: Utada Hikaru

Automatic: 10 This is like… their very first hit, and it’s already this fully formed, and they already sound so mature

Addicted To You: 10 It makes me happy that while Utada usually works alone/with the same team of producers, they easily can work with the BIGGEST producers out there. The Neptunes, Timbaland, Skrillex, Tricky Stewart, Stargate, and, on this song, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. And yeah this song just bops like no one’s business 

Sakura Drops: 9 PERFECT album opener, no clue what the hell the video was doing. 

Traveling: 10 This song is just SO smooth and slinky and unlike so much of their output, but I love it with all my life 

Easy Breezy: 10 this is literal camp… also the rest of their first (available) English album is this weird but also a lot less… lyrically weird and more unironically good 

Keep Tryin’: 10 Ultra Blue is a top tier album in their discography and this is a clear illustration of that. I wouldn’t even call it my favorite or the best off this album, but it’s just… so nice. And the video doesn’t hurt either. 

Colors: 8 I think I know this song best for being the one that simple and clean was a b-side to… and of course simple and clean completely outsold and outstreamed this. This is cute though 

Come Back To Me: 8.3 I assume Easy Breezy is out by the time this goes out… so lemme say that I don’t have the same ringing endorsement of Utada’s second English album as I do their first. If you like this song, check it out, but if you don’t… this is pretty much the album lol. I still like the album, and I like a few songs on it more than this one (Me Muero and FYI especially), but if you don’t like this at all, you do not need to check the full thing out 

Flavor Of Life: 8.6 This song was essentially a full comeback for Hikki after Ultra Blue underperformed a little. Ultra Blue was really successful, don’t get me wrong, but the physical sales of the singles and album weren’t as high as they once were because people were buying the album and singles on iTunes. Japanese charts/certifications were based on physical sales at the time (the oricon charts didn’t count physical single sales until 2017), so while the album was pretty much a smashing success by today’s standards in EVERY metric, it wasn’t viewed that way. So to make a comeback from that, Hikki kind of… doubled down on their digital success. This song sold RIDICULOUSLY well across the board. Like… literally the best selling single in Japanese history, partially due to its success as a ringtone and in the full song. And the song itself? Yeah it’s pretty nice. Nowhere near my favorite Utada song, but still really good. 

Beautiful World: 10 Okay this version is incredible but the [Da Capo Version](https://open.spotify.com/track/611Za6hN3gmZiIrN5fxuzq?si=8-eFmSDzRlujaK0EkrpbsQ) released this year is one of my favorite Hikki recordings ever. Like literally fucking INCREDIBLE

A Bouquet For You: 9 barrelcat 

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 10 I can’t believe they wrote this song before everything that happened. This song is devastating either way

Play A Love Song: 10 Hatsukoi is probably one of my least favorite Hikki albums, but this song is wonderful and lovely. This, Chikai (aka Don’t Think Twice from KHIII), Goodnight, and Pakuchii No Uta are all 10s in a sea of mid scores imo

One Last Kiss: 11 One thing I really loved about Mariah Carey’s Caution was her ability to take hitmaking producers and make them make a perfect Mariah Carey song instead of a perfect DJ Mustard beat, or a perfect Skrillex song. Utada does that here with PC Music founder AG Cook. They took the prime producer of label known for sounding inhuman and artificial and made a song that sounds like a hug. I really didn’t know if I’d 11this or traveling, but when I sat down and thought about it, this was the song I was more attached to, and the song that would feel the best for me to see win. 

Face My Fears: 8 okay yeah this song isn’t their best but it’s still fun 

Sun & Moon: 7.5 when I throw ass to this jazz song

Pink Blood: 7.3 This song is a bit of a shrug for me, but it’s nice and the video is WONDERFUL (well it’s clamor shots but I like those, they look nice)

Eat You Up: 9.9 Kinda dated but it fucks and it’s been in my head all day

Hurricane Venus: 8.8

Copy & Paste: 8 I see how this would be annoying, but I like annoying things sometimes. I stan charli, I accidentally befriended a capital G Gamer once, and 

Only One: 9.2 is this score partially because the video has some of the best choreo in the rate? Yeah, and what about it?

Disturbance: 5 

Kiss My Lips: 10 Why are so many songs with kissing in the title so good? Save A Kiss, Kiss It Better, now this. 

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 5 I’m sorry can we talk about this music video where she flies without warning??

Lookbook: 6.5 I’m kinda aggressively mixed on this… can’t decide if it’s a total serve or kinda just loud for the sake of it 

One Shot, Two Shot: 10 red shot blue shot?

Jazzclub: 9 the way she’s stretching the vowel makes me hear that she’s singing about “the jizz club”

Woman: 9 

Better: 7.7 Hmm the verses are good and the video is EXCELLENT, but I don’t think I love the chorus…

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 10 I think hearing the context and the background for this one really made me appreciate it more so I'll take this comment do to my obligatory ' thank you ghost' comment because truly your information during the listening parties and everything really added to this.

Womxnly: 9.7 I just love her so much

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB):  8 you know choices were in fact made!

Artist: Utada Hikaru

Automatic: 10 my first experience with this album was hearing 'moving on without you' and i remember hearing it and being shocked how RnB influenced it was and I went to check to see what album it was from and was shocked to see it was from 1999. Anyway I love this so much the 90s rnb flavor is delicious

Username: throwaway7650

Artist: Jolin Tsai

Living With The World: 9 ignoring the fact that this score might be carried by nostalgia that doesn't even exist... the BPM is a tad low for me but bop!

Don’t Stop: 8 this score is purely carried by nostalgia I'm well-aware :soobcry:

Show Your Love: 7.5 I love disco

Say Love You: 11 the intro guitar, the chorus, the post-chorus... what a classic omg. hearing this during a beatsense listening party unlocked so many memories for me; I stanned this song HARD as a kid when people covered it on singing shows. over time I forgot the name of this song (and the artist who sang it) but it would pop into my head every once in a while... ofc it would be this legend honestly. I'm happy to give this my 11 and to come out of the rate having rediscovered such a defining song of my childhood!

Dancing Diva: 8 ethnic hip moment... also is that sticker I hear in the bridge? 

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 5 it's a pretty duet tbh but what was going through their minds during the "in the house" parts... I can't. EVICTED!

Sun Will Never Set: 10 the intro reminds me of viva la vida (I love disco [2])

Butterfly: 9.5 another great chorus, it's sooo catchy and addictive. mega bop!

Honey Trap: 9.5 she's serving cunt your honor (on the album cover too!)

The Great Artist: 9.5 jolin is really good at choruses huh... overall super solid

“I”: 8 a really pretty ballad but jolin has far more memorable tracks here

Play: 7.5 hyperpop - this song really just experimenting with different types of fart noises huh - but I can't get over the MV (an 11) encapsulating all of the wildest aspects of chinese CFs... it's the most camp thing in this rate by far

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 9 2 legends collabing again, I'm yassing

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 10 GAY PEOPLE ARE REAL YASS

Ugly Beauty: 8.5 the prechorus slays, the MV is an absolute serve too

Womxnly: 9 an anthem but what a tragic backstory to the lyrics </3

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 9 queen of choreo, your faves could never etc.

Artist: Utada Hikaru

Automatic: 8.5 utada's (intentional) intonation with certain notes is very hit-or-miss with me and it's more miss than hit on this track but I still really like it

Addicted To You: 8 very alluring/captivating production... perhaps addicting?

Sakura Drops: 9.5 not the best vocals from utada but the sparkly synths contrast the overall dark sound so well, I'm obsessed with the production

Traveling: 9 what in the lazy town is the MV for this... also I love disco [3]

Easy Breezy: 5 the lyrics seem like they were written for a kpop group except the ~~xenophobic~~ songwriters got the country of origin wrong... oops?

Keep Tryin’: 8.5 quite like the chorus of this one, cute MV too

Colors: 9 overall really like utada's vocals and the production on this one

Come Back To Me: 8 sweet song, really like the opening piano sequence

Flavor Of Life: 10 the guitar/strings... I'm ascending. the chorus melody is fantastic too. the intonation I mentioned earlier works on this track really well

Beautiful World: 10 the eva OSTs are literally so good, all 3 are day 3 material

A Bouquet For You: 8 good but very derivative of the "asian midtempo" genre

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 10 that part at like 2:40... I died. the drums, the electric guitar, the strings, the synths, the vocals, etc. absolutely heavenly. if I had a 2nd 11, it would go to this song (even though so many here deserve it)

Play A Love Song: 7 play a kpop* song because this could be one melodically

One Last Kiss: 10 an 11 contender and deserving winner. A.G. cook did that!

Face My Fears: 10 this was original a 7.5 until I watched a choreo by astro (crazy sexy cool) rocky where he used this as the bg music - sometimes a visual does wonders https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GAksgvR8nM

Sun & Moon: 10 this song featuring 2 legends is just exquisite. the dramatics, the jazz-y/broadway influence, the orchestral arrangement... *chef's kiss*

Pink Blood: 6 was kind of let down by this after one 1ast k1ss but oh well

Artist: BoA

ID; Peace B: 7 BoA deserves massive respect for debuting with this song + album at age 13. ***13***! unfortunately this song doesn't do much for me

Listen To My Heart: 7 yeah early BoA isn't really for me I fear. still a legend!

Atlantis Princess: 7 one of my favorite song titles in the rate but the song doesn't live up to it I fear. anyway stream atlantis by (rate winner) SHINee!

Shine We Are !: 10 free britney

Eat You Up: 7.5 I keep waiting for the song to speed up but it just doesn't

Hurricane Venus: 10 the titular hook is so catchy, great chorus production!

Copy & Paste: 8.5 that main instrumental hook is catchy af, I'll give it that

Only One: 10 BoA collecting men like infinity stones for this song... iconic

Disturbance: 8 solid but I feel like I've heard this SM song 20 times before

Kiss My Lips: 10 this was a massive grower, the vibes are immaculate

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 7.5 see my comment for disturbance... ctfu

Lookbook: 9.5 actually a massive bop and might be an unfortunate day 1 cut

One Shot, Two Shot: 10 immaculate production, boring rate winner though

Jazzclub: 5 not awful but starts sounding like a momoland song after a while

Woman: 10 the choreo for this is ICONIC, your faves actually could never

Better: 9 the better album isn't a bad starting point for BoA's discography tbh

Say Love You: 7.7 love the guitar in this

Dancing Diva: 9.5 love how mysterious this is. this is kinda the start of where it feels like she comes into her own style and vibe even with the musical metamorphosis she has

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 7.8 the "in the house" bit sends me but in a cute way! a good cheese. actually really enjoy the use of i think harmonica??? and theremin?

Sun Will Never Set: 8 tbh this reminds me a bit of Light Years Kylie

Butterfly: 9 loon/a bankrupt

Honey Trap: 10 thot bop is basically an automatic 8+ from me and this one legit BANGS

The Great Artist: 10 looove the harder electronic edge this has, contrasts wonderfully with how sweet her voice is

“I”: 7.2 taeyeon outsold

Play: 9.4 the drop is kinda dated but it slaps enough for me not to care

I’m Not Yours (feat. Namie Amuro): 10 extra point for namie (who would've fit this rate musically better than hikki tbh!)

We're All Different, Yet The Same: 9.3 she can say it but she wouldn't

Ugly Beauty: 10 loooove how percussive the production in this is, and the buildup to that "antidrop" right before the chorus is so good. musically one of the oddest songs in the rate and i mean that as a high compliment

Womxnly: 9.8 love how moody this is omg

Stars Align (feat. R3HAB): 8 il generic but pleasant enough to overcome that

Easy Breezy: 7.8 okay i actually love how uneasy the production in this is but the lyrics and their vocals in this bring it down for me

Keep Tryin’: 7 i like the vibe this is going for but it also doesnt really go anywhere? like it feels like it's building up with no real release so it kinda drags after a bit

Colors: 6.4 another one that feels like it wants to go somewhere and doesnt really

Come Back To Me: 0 i lied about nothing in this rate deserving a zero. this sounds like something mariah would've scrapped from anklemonitor and their voice sounds so damaged for some reason here (not in an emotional way but like physically). it's just boring and plodding and so LONG on top of that. love me a long song when it actually goes somewhere but this meanders with no purpose

Flavor Of Life: 4.2 there's really no flavor to this

Beautiful World: 5 way too long for a song that goes nowhere musically

A Bouquet For You: 7 the instrumentation is beautiful, i'll give them that

Flowing Cherry Blossoms: 2 this is the song where i realize i just dont like their voice most of the time

Play A Love Song: 7.6 the piano in this reminds me of Kylie's Magic (which obv came out much later but still)

One Last Kiss: 8.8 okay back to snapping i see thank GOD

Face My Fears: 3 im sorry but the drop makes me laugh it is not good

Sun & Moon: 10 ykw this actually came very close to stealing my 11 from boa like, the absolute DRAMA in this omg it could be a glamorous movie theme

Pink Blood: 6 eh

Artist: BoA: [adjusts tinfoil lacefront] No. 1 was omitted to give the others a chance to win despite being one of BoA's signature hits

ID; Peace B: 8.2 looove those synth strings and the general intensity

Listen To My Heart: 9.7 the opening always makes me think of He Loves You Not for some reason so its double iconic for that reason

Atlantis Princess: 10 grandiose!

Shine We Are !: 6.4 

Eat You Up: 4.7 you're perfect you're beautiful you look like linda evangelista you're a model everything about you is perfect did you stone those tights? oh you're smiling! they eat her up every single time she's on that damn stage she doesnt jhbsfjhasbjhsbjf she could release this song and they're like boa-tina your smile is beautiful

Hurricane Venus: 7.2 not actually as much a fan of her electropop phase as i should be on paper but i think it's because she just sounds better before and after so it might be how the songs around this time were mixed

Copy & Paste: 8.1 the prechorus is much better than the actual chorus tbh

Only One: 7.4 sometimes this hits much harder but this is not one of those times and i already know im gonna regret this score once the reveal happens

Disturbance: 8 this is just like such a pleasant vibe idk

Kiss My Lips: 11 yeah this is peak BoA for me like, legitimately one of those songs that absolutely floored me from the first time i heard it. the production is lush, she shows off her vocals in a masterful way without needing to make it some showstopper ballad, it's basically about wanting to get kissed and railed like this is everything i love in a bop. added bonus is how luxurious the stages for this song are but i dont count that when scoring bc it's just extra. if popheads robs this i wont delete my account but just know yall wont be seeing heaven

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 9 KML really was her horny era huh

Lookbook: 8.7 love how this has small moments to breathe before the production goes off

One Shot, Two Shot: 10 the way i absolutely used this in my ig story when i got my 2nd dose anyway this SLAPS ridiculously hard

Jazzclub: 9.2 kinda her bboom bboom

Woman: 9.8 she's serving c*nt your honor

Easy Breezy: 8.9 Americans were never gonna grasp the nuance that this song has, it’s camp but belies a very real anger at being fetishized and discarded, and it's delivered with attitude that sounds cathartic for Utada. The "Japanesey" line is a tongue in cheek moment that’s obviously meant to mock the racist way this careless lover thinks, but unfortunately it does land clunkily.

Living With The World: 6 I can’t score a bog-standard Chinese ballad too low, tbh. This sound is inextricably linked with my childhood memories

Don’t Stop: 6.5

Show Your Love: 5

Say Love You: 8 Reminds me of youth, both my own and in general. I like it.

Dancing Diva: 5

Marry Me Today (feat. David Tao): 6.5 If you go to any karaoke salon, you will hear two people warbling a song exactly like this to each other in at LEAST one adjacent room while you’re just trying to get down to Mr. Brightside by the Killers 

Sun Will Never Set: 7 This song reminds me of one that would be used in as the opening of a 2000s drama, and the final episode would have like, a piano ballad version of this song

Butterfly: 6.5 Yup, it’s 2009, that’s for sure! 

Honey Trap:  7 “I want your satisfaction. I want your satisfaction. I want your- (will. i. am voice) BRING. THE ACTION.” my enthusiastic suggestion for revising this song

The Great Artist: 8 The chorus lets this down (I want something more EXO, more loud and melodic – see Exo-M’s MAMA for the closest analogue of what I want) but it’s still great

“I”: 9.5 OH YEAH THAT’S MORE LIKE IT! THAT’S THE KIND OF SAD GUITAR BALLAD I LIKE! I scream inappropriately at Jolin’s concert, ruining the DVD footage

ID; Peace B: 7.5

Listen To My Heart: 6 Not a fan of the vocal performance here. Every line of the chorus sounds like a struggle for her to get out, almost like she’s out of breath. It’s okay otherwise.

Atlantis Princess: 11 This song was one of the first times I experienced nostalgia for something I didn’t experience. I heard it in college and I remember distinctly practicing the dance to this in secret in the studio before my friends would show up for rehearsal. I love the sunniness of it. The feeling I get listening to this song exemplifies what I think the best “idols” give to their fans – pure happiness. 

Shine We Are !: 8.5

Eat You Up: 6.5

Hurricane Venus: 9 I got into K-pop around 2010 so this was the first BoA comeback I experienced in real time, and even then I remember people talked about her like this was a legacy artist. It’s insane that she had ten years of experience under her belt then, despite being only 23. That’s the same as Irene of Red Velvet when she **debuted**! Anyway this song is probably somewhat divisive now – it’s VERY much of its time – but I looped it like crazy back then and I’m still fond of it now.

Copy & Paste: 8

Only One: 7.5

Disturbance: 9 This is the same song as Who Are You, but both are good.

Kiss My Lips: 6

Who Are You (feat. Gaeko): 10 This is the same song as Disturbance, but both are good. This is the one I knew before the rate – I used to listen to this all the time in college. Honestly this probably isn’t a full 10, but there’s a nostalgia factor for me because of that.
