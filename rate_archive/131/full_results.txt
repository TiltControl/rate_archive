**hikk** (11): i'm so predictable give me a kpop house track and i'll eat it up

**Osaka1268** (11): god i love BOA

**akanewasright** (10): red shot blue shot?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I only needed one shot to like this song (bad pun)

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Ughh I love this so much. The house-y sound to it is just perfect

**bookthieving** (10): vaccination queen!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the way i absolutely used this in my ig story when i got my 2nd dose anyway this SLAPS ridiculously hard

**duochromepalmtree** (10): obsessed doesn’t get close to how I feel about this song.

**GARjuna** (10): this song is SO GORGEOUS. Like jesus christ!!!! Tutting w this song would be fun

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): more like ten shot haha am i right ladies

**nt96** (10): One shot, two shot right into day 3

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): probably the most predictable rate winner but it’s so good so

**plastichaxan** (10): bop bop bop bop bop

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): yes

**QustoMar** (10): This is just like the definition of what you think of when you think “K-pop bop.” Like everything about this song is so so polished and infectious, it’s impossible not to adore this imo.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is basic bitch synthpop, good thing i'm a basic bitch

**Roxieloxie** (10): Im absolutely obsessed with this song and this video, the look with her where she has the sparkly outfit and her hair is curly,,,,, Ms. Boa i would kill for you

**runaway3212** (10): THIS GOES IN

**sage** (10): this song is so gay

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): more like Ten Shot

**saviorARMY101** (10): I hate how underrated this song is, it's literally her best song.

**seanderlust** (10): "one shot two shot just for one" BoA in her alcoholism era

**skargardin** (10): this is absolutely hypnotising

**throwaway7650** (10): immaculate production, boring rate winner though

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Who produced this? This is so catchy. Tbh I didn't think I would like cause of the title, but I was wrong.

**xavieryes** (10): more like 10 shot

**Kwcty6888** (9.6): we love a vaccine anthem

**1998tweety** (9): omg what a pussy popper

**2dina3dworld** (9): dance bops are where BoA shines best, such as this banger. The wub wub isn’t distracting, the vocals compliment BoA right and I guess it’s just good

**cremeebrulee** (9): one shot two shot red shot blue shot

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it feels like we’ve just returned from killing a man

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**bbfan132** (8.5): bopping rn

**jasannn** (8.5): I'll be disappointed if this pulls a Shinee - View.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.3): I like that sound happening in the chorus

**wavingwolves** (8.1): it's good but it fails to be amazing

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): the fact this wasn’t shamelessly plugged with the two vaccines shots is such a lost opportunity it makes me mad.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the sister song to lmfao’s shots

**rslashpoopheads** (8): banger

**vayyiqra** (8): Maybe being kind of generous here but it is a big bop

**abcd9muses** (7): one of her newer songs but I think it's one of her cooler singles. Has the elements SM was really pushing in a lot their artists during the late 2010s, which is why I brought my score down slightly... at the same time though, I think BoA stands out uniquely. I actually had a really hard time rating this one because I do think the MV really elevates it (which I think happens frequently in Kpop)

**hookerofpop** (7): it’s alright, what can i say?

**ivyleaf33** (7): this song refused to get out of my head for at least a whole month

**fkadizzy-1804** (6.5): the verses are sooooo good and atmospheric and then the chorus just grates on me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Six points, six points.

**fadedblue09** (6): Banger but those distorted beats in the chorus are driving me nuts

**akanewasright** (11): One thing I really loved about Mariah Carey’s Caution was her ability to take hitmaking producers and make them make a perfect Mariah Carey song instead of a perfect DJ Mustard beat, or a perfect Skrillex song. Utada does that here with PC Music founder AG Cook. They took the prime producer of label known for sounding inhuman and artificial and made a song that sounds like a hug. I really didn’t know if I’d 11this or traveling, but when I sat down and thought about it, this was the song I was more attached to, and the song that would feel the best for me to see win.

**BeauMeringue212** (11): It was very hard to decide which song would get my 11, but it's just gotta be this. I've had it on repeat since starting this rate, it's beautiful

**CrimsonROSET** (11): they’re an icon, they’re a legend, and they are the moment, come on now

**frogaranaman** (11): so true

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I haven’t watched the movie yet but this slaps

**sarcasticsobs** (11): get in the robot, shinji. truly do not know if this is actually the best song in the rate, but hot damn is it my favorite. full A.G. Cook + Utada record when?

**skargardin** (11): This song is so insanely stunning, it insantly captivated me the moment I heard it. Absolutely one of my favourite songs of the year, I really hope it does well in this rate.

**apatel27** (10): Utada + A.G. Cook + Eva = perfection

**cremeebrulee** (10): new personal rating rule, if a song has made me cry its a 10

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): my username is an NGE reference lmao

**Jhe116** (10): The production is different but still suits them sooo well

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): I was so tempted to give this my eleven.

**plastichaxan** (10): payola actually works cause the more and more y'all played this in beatsense it kept growing on me and look where we are now

**QustoMar** (10): This is so so gorgeous, and I love how this song keeps what you expect in the core of an Utada Hikaru while still switching up the formula. The production in the second half??? EXCELLENCE

**RandomHypnotica** (10): SO pretty, a super romantic song with AG Cook production? The vibes on this are so incredibly pretty, and it feels like a great mix of their early stuff with minimalist pop sensisbilities, and it works SO well

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay i really do love this, like is this the obvious winner, yeah , but also its really good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): A.G. Cook + Evangelion + Utada = instant classic

**saviorARMY101** (10): God I'm literally crying after hearing this, it just feels like a warm and soft hug. 😭❤️

**seanderlust** (10): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/425/697/2d1.png

**stryxen** (10): more like one last loop of this song it’s addictive

**throwaway7650** (10): an 11 contender and deserving winner. A.G. cook did that!

**xavieryes** (10): why are so many of their songs like "hmm this one's a 7 oh wait nvm it's another 10"

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): bop bop bop

**bbfan132** (9): this is super super pretty, ag cook’s production <3

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): wouldn’t be mad at all if this won

**vayyiqra** (9): Okay how did I not know Utada did so many NGE songs this is making me uneasy I thought I'd never heard their music before this rate even though they were on my radar. Anyway this is really good. The vocal line is beautiful, but also listen closely to the instrumental tracks; there's so much going on there.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): okay back to snapping i see thank GOD

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.8): this song grew on me so much in just a few listens

**celladonn** (8.5): We love an A.G. Cook produced bop

**GARjuna** (8.5): what does this have to do w eva?

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**drejski** (8): It's not amazing but there's something cute about it

**duochromepalmtree** (8): fun and catchy!

**fadedblue09** (8): I get that is one of their frontrunning songs but something's quite amiss.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I can't believe the melody for thank u, next came from the outro on this song!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I love the melody. This song is just a whole vibe and I love it.

**abcd9muses** (7.5): Heart Station meets the 2020s, what's not to love

**sage** (7): ive never got the hype for this song at all like whats so great about it... but actually on this listen it hit more so maybe itll grow on me more

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i'm surprised A.G. produced this because it gives more Mura Masa to me

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I saw a few people hyping this up in discord however I think it falls a bit flat to me compared to their other work

**runaway3212** (6.5): Not my favourite but cool lyrically

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): gneh, not a fan of this production

**ivyleaf33** (6.3): really gorgeous and floaty, but it barely feels like it's there

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): It gets a five cause there’s just no reaction.

**wavingwolves** (4): this seems to be such a favourite and i really can't understand why exactly this would warrant such strong positive feelings for anyone but maybe that's the beauty of the subjective nature of music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): sounds like generic retail store music

**runaway3212** (10): This is camp in the best way

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The perfect song to listen to on the bus, and I spend a lot of time there.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): this song is immaculate. the production, the lyrics, the synths, everything about this song is amazing. fuck that man, you don't need him

**celladonn** (11): Wow what a banger!!! I loved the video as well

**ivyleaf33** (11): the vocal effects and spoken parts are just so fun and cool and this mv is honestly just insane. her looks are insane. god i love her so much.

**Jhe116** (11): This is hands down her magnum opus. Like I don’t even pay attention to Taiwanese pop but I know how to sing this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): she wasnt lying she IS the great artist. also unrelated to the song itself but the music video for this is a serve as well (EDIT i kept coming back to this song even when i was trying to rate the other artists bc its so good. id say that makes it 11 worthy)

**akanewasright** (10): THIS is where I truly fall hard for Jolin’s music. The production has aged a little, but it slaps and EVERYTHING is here artistically - the lyrics, the visuals, and a sense of Jolin being the absolute, undeniable center of it all. She OWNS this song completely

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): looove the harder electronic edge this has, contrasts wonderfully with how sweet her voice is

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really like the use of effect on her voice, and the song is very bright and fun and dynamic to me.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love everything about this, the production is fantastic (that harpsichord in the bridge!!!), the lyrics are really interesting and the MV is absolutely gorgeous

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is very 2012 but im here for it

**runaway3212** (10): God im so gay

**sarcasticsobs** (10): love the guitar on this, then those chorus synths, baby!

**seanderlust** (10): leave him sis (jolin version)

**skargardin** (10): This video is a visual TREAT YASSSS

**xavieryes** (10): the title says it all

**throwaway7650** (9.5): jolin is really good at choruses huh... overall super solid

**Osaka1268** (9): shes serving looks in this video tho

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I don't even know what she's saying, but tbh I don't care cause this is a bop.

**QustoMar** (8.5): A lot of Jolin's earlier material feels like something great was hidden in there, waiting to be unleashed but was not quite there yet. This song is more what I wanted to see, this has much more personality, production is powerful and punchy, Jolin is switching up her delivery and has way more emotion. Jolin feels like she is finally HERE.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): kinda boppin

**BeauMeringue212** (8.4): Love the production here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.3): Electric guitar in a pop song? Rina's influence.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8): the little woomf woomf in the back reminds me of Rainism, it’s kinda like it’s less horny cousin

**apatel27** (8): This would bang live, not so much sitting at home

**bbfan132** (8): this bopped!!

**bigbigbee** (8): The chorus lets this down (I want something more EXO, more loud and melodic - see Exo-M’s MAMA for the closest analogue of what I want) but it’s still great

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she’s right and she should say it

**fadedblue09** (8): A lil overproduced, I love the message and lyrical metaphors used

**fkadizzy-1804** (8): most of this song I LOVE but I have to dock a point because some sections do drag on a bit

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I dig this futuristic sound for her

**nt96** (8): Jolin asserting herself to the other two flop girlies.

**plastichaxan** (8): good for her

**SmileAndTears** (8): I liked this a lot more than her other late 00s/early 10s electro-pop bops tbh. The chorus was catchy, the video had a BUDGET and it was just good overall?

**vayyiqra** (8): This bangs and I agree, I love the futuristic vibe of the video and the lyrics are cool.

**duochromepalmtree** (7.8): how is it possible this song wasn’t on one of the fast and furious soundtracks???

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): okay they went off with this MV budget

**abcd9muses** (7): it's like Charli xcx joined K/DA

**drejski** (6): A little dull

**jasannn** (11): Killing me softly with his song...

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): has such a beautiful and atmospheric type of feel to it - what a fitting song for an album centred around a “first love”, it’s so laidback and dreamy but emotional at the same time

**TragicKingdom1** (11): best production in the rate and thus the best song overall despite the slightly clunky hook

**wavingwolves** (11): there's just something so infatuating about this song ughhh i just love everything about it

**akanewasright** (10): This is like… their very first hit, and it’s already this fully formed, and they already sound so mature

**fadedblue09** (10): What a slick slice of R&B. Probably the best debut single here.

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): This song is really pretty.

**nt96** (10): An automatic win for Utada!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this song always makes me think of gfriend rough these days

**Roxieloxie** (10): my first experience with this album was hearing 'moving on without you' and i remember hearing it and being shocked how RnB influenced it was and I went to check to see what album it was from and was shocked to see it was from 1999. Anyway I love this so much the 90s rnb flavor is delicious

**sage** (10): one of the best debut songs ever actually, was almost my 11

**sarcasticsobs** (10): vh1’s i love the 90’s. 1st non-kingdom hearts song i heard from them and it still rules

**saviorARMY101** (10): A classic

**skargardin** (10): now this is how you debut

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): other than the disaster on PFRR i cant think of a song with Automatic in the title that i dont love

**plastichaxan** (9.5): they wrote this at 15??? kind of unfair to be so talented and cool and just perfect

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): an automatic hit

**1998tweety** (9): sensual bop

**bbfan132** (9): when this is your debut single…. they did that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Wish the hook felt just a bit more cohesive but otherwise this rules.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is just so smooth, holy shit.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): lol it makes sense so many songs in this rate a very 2000s but also it’s so funny because this album is from the year I was born so my first reaction is just “this isn’t vintage but it’s dated”.  However ‘99 babies should stick together including me and this album.

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**jaztinax** (9): i’ve been obsessed with the late 90s/early 2000s sound lately so this is right up my lane

**runaway3212** (9): They sound so incredibly beautiful here

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Love the late 90's r&b sound to this

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is the second song I’ve heard from this album and wow it’s just so fresh sounding even though it’s very distinctly 90’s

**seanderlust** (8.5): it feels very 90s but also like it would have done very well stateside in the 90s. it also holds up very well

**throwaway7650** (8.5): utada's (intentional) intonation with certain notes is very hit-or-miss with me and it's more miss than hit on this track but I still really like it

**abcd9muses** (8): such a chill track, pulls you in and lets you float with ease

**celladonn** (8): Very smooth

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is adorable

**duochromepalmtree** (8): all of the 90s/early 00s vibes and I am obsessed. Probably did not need to be as long as it is lol

**fkadizzy-1804** (8): I can’t fault the slinky beat or the angelic harmonies or Utada’s sweet, earnest vocals, but if I’m being critical there is something that feels a tiny bit unfinished/unpolished about this song. The line between chill and boring can be fine and this song just barely walks it imo

**rotating3Dtext** (8): it’s kinda long

**rslashpoopheads** (8): very warm and fuzzy

**stryxen** (8): lounge vibes got me moving my head side to side, maybe even wagging a finger slightly

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): classic 90's R&B but really well refined and smooth, what's not to like?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Their voice is so good! They were how old when they released this? Their voice sounds so mature.

**2dina3dworld** (7): that chika chika boom could have segued into My Name Is. Other than that, it’s very typical 90s jpop, this could’ve been a Speed song.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): it's time to get funky

**drejski** (7): The beat makes it good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): if an american pop girl had released this in english it probably wouldve been a really big hit

**vayyiqra** (7): Yeah this is *very* 90s R&B, but I like it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.6): This has such a nice groove. Reminds me of Robyn's first album, Show Me 11ove forever. But the vocals at the end leave a lot to be desired.

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): i love the instrumental but it’s too long

**bulforster** (11): pussy

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): yeah this is peak BoA for me like, legitimately one of those songs that absolutely floored me from the first time i heard it. the production is lush, she shows off her vocals in a masterful way without needing to make it some showstopper ballad, it's basically about wanting to get kissed and railed like this is everything i love in a bop. added bonus is how luxurious the stages for this song are but i dont count that when scoring bc it's just extra. if popheads robs this i wont delete my account but just know yall wont be seeing heaven

**cremeebrulee** (11): omfg i’m so obsessed with this, it’s such a sexy bop

**Roxieloxie** (11): this is so good , this is so good, this!!! is so!!! GOOD!!!

**1998tweety** (10): omg sex anthem

**akanewasright** (10): Why are so many songs with kissing in the title so good? Save A Kiss, Kiss It Better, now this.

**frogaranaman** (10): so true

**Jhe116** (10): I didn’t remember this song to be so good???

**nt96** (10): BoA could constrict me and force me to throw ass to all of her bops and I would thank her.

**QustoMar** (10): This song is so so so good, and it’s very important in BoA’s Korean discography because it lays out the template that many of her following title tracks would follow. One Shot Two Shot, Woman, Better, etc. never would’ve happened without BoA establishing her new identity that began with Only One.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is so sexy and smooth and hot and im flushed wow

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this song makes me want to own a jazz cafe with an adjoining night club

**sage** (10): this song kinda perfect actually

**saviorARMY101** (10): This song is sexy af

**throwaway7650** (10): this was a massive grower, the vibes are immaculate

**Kwcty6888** (9.6): a funky grower of a banger

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): Her voice is so smooth here I love it

**apatel27** (9): Can't go wrong with strong RnB

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): okay bop

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): !!!

**runaway3212** (9): me @ any guy

**skargardin** (9): bop!!

**SmileAndTears** (9): cute bop

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I knew I would love her newer songs. And her voice sounds so good too!

**vayyiqra** (9): shoutout to the iconic /u/cloudbustingmp3 who loves this song and the taste that is on display here ... this funk groove is TIGHT what a SMOOTH song

**bbfan132** (8.5): :listening: this bopped

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A very spicy vocal performance

**hookerofpop** (8.5): omg does this remind anyone of eclipse by kim lip??

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.4): Oh we groovin' now.

**abcd9muses** (8): what a sultry track

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): no thanks but your song is pretty good

**seanderlust** (8): the synths in the background are doing some REALLY interesting things.

**jaztinax** (7.9): the chorus is the only reason this is higher than a 6. also the production

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): this song is so close to being perfect but it’s a little muddled in the middle. Still so good.

**fkadizzy-1804** (7.5): the production on this is really really interesting and I guess I like the song but I don’t LOVE it y’know?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): are there gonna be any social distancing jokes or is it sasha velour dont joke about that

**wavingwolves** (5.3): the production is so good but it doesn't bring it to another level by not letting the song grow! and don't give me an empty chorus!!!!!!

**stryxen** (4): this makes me kinda uncomfortable i

**2dina3dworld** (2): this is about as sexy as crying on your floor to Once in a Lifetime

**BeauMeringue212** (10): This is so fucking good, like discovering a classic. R&B BoA is supreme

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): releasing one of your best singles nearly 20 years into your career who tf else is maintaining the longevity of quality like this!!! this song just drives me insane

**cremeebrulee** (10): i'm really coming out of this rate a full boa stan

**fadedblue09** (10): maybe recency bias but this was my favorite song of hers on the list. A laid back R&b style that suits her vocals well

**Jhe116** (10): Such a good song, what a way to finish this rate

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): how have i never heard this before??

**runaway3212** (10): Better than anything in this rate (note to self only keep this comment if this ends up being the 11)

**sage** (10): absolute smash

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): This song is so amazing. The melody! The vocals! The beat! It's perfect!

**wavingwolves** (9.4): i wish this was a shinee song but i'll take it

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): this *better* do well!

**1998tweety** (9): big bop

**apatel27** (9): Smooth

**bbfan132** (9): :listening: i like this quite a bit :celestial:

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I really like the strings in this song . I also really like the dance performance for this.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): the hook is absolutely killer

**GARjuna** (9): queen still has it

**jasannn** (9): Very modern. Very bass-slides. Very SM. Very BoA.

**jaztinax** (9): STILL GOT IT

**QustoMar** (9): Better both the song and album are a culmination of so much that BoA has done the past 10 years. This song is so powerful and sinister sounding, but it feels effortless and true to BoA. The Better album is the definition of a solid pop album imo, though I would have taken off 1 or 2 of the slower songs and maybe replaced the more "SM Machine" tracks.

**skargardin** (9): I forgot how fresh this was, and still is tbh. I should listen to it way more

**throwaway7650** (9): the better album isn't a bad starting point for BoA's discography tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): there’s just a lot of interesting elements I like in this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.4): Than a majority of the other songs in this rate I would say. Thumbs up.

**2dina3dworld** (8): this could be better

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): am I better than this though?

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): luv the bass in this

**rslashpoopheads** (8): somehow I knew this entire song without even recognizing the name at all

**ivyleaf33** (7.8): the little breakdown/bridge at the end is the best part

**akanewasright** (7.7): Hmm the verses are good and the video is EXCELLENT, but I don’t think I love the chorus…

**celladonn** (7.5): I like the slightly eerie feeling these strings have

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): are we

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): eh its good i guess but idk I dont really care for it either

**abcd9muses** (6): unfortunately I do think BoA is better than this... it did get better in the second half but it was a little too late

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): great song but tbh [awa did it better](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=7DIa-MolAUQ) so i'd rather just listen to the original

**vayyiqra** (6): This has a very solid groove but not much else going for it I fear. wait maybe her second verse is pretty good idk

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): i love this kind of instrumental SO MUCH

**GARjuna** (10): I love this????

**Jhe116** (10): One of the songs in her discography that was like completely inescapable at its peak. People quote “旋轉 跳躍 我閉著眼” A LOT

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): instant favorite

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): love how mysterious this is. this is kinda the start of where it feels like she comes into her own style and vibe even with the musical metamorphosis she has

**TiltControls** (9.5): took a while to grow on me, but it's a ton of fun!

**1998tweety** (9): omg a big bop

**abcd9muses** (9): I definitely felt like a dancing main character!

**apatel27** (9): Bit dated but still very good

**fkadizzy-1804** (9): yes I’m a sucker for booming fuzzed-out drums&bass and a bouncy synth line. This slaps

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**ivyleaf33** (9): this was so iconic i literally have no words

**lagozzino** (9): Jolin Davenport, the Dancing Diva of Taiwan

**nt96** (9): Loving the Bollywood vibe behind it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is a really weird complaint to make about a song but the part around 2:35 where theres a flute playing sounds really out of tune to me? its honestly really distracting and takes me out of the song a bit which is a shame bc the rest of the song other than that one small bit is really good

**vayyiqra** (9): That vaguely Middle Eastern sample is so cheesy but this is still a banger. Also, the bridge is awesome.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): I love how dramatic this track feels, with those huge boomy drums in the verses and the little wind chimey keys, it's got a really cool sound.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I love the distinctive Cpop flavor of this

**seanderlust** (8.5): alyssa edwards has entered the chat

**wavingwolves** (8.1): this has the same flavour as a pussycat doll song so it slays

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I like this

**BeauMeringue212** (8): This is very catchy, the bollywood sound is nice too

**throwaway7650** (8): ethnic hip moment... also is that sticker I hear in the bridge?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.9): If I could dance or had any charisma I would emulate the song title when this plays.

**sage** (7.8): SLAY

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): best song so far :beardance:

**QustoMar** (7.5): Oh jolin kinda served here, this is way more my type of song phew. A bop.

**bbfan132** (7): this was fine, it’s not too memorable but i liked it

**CrimsonROSET** (7): A song called ‘dancing diva’ that is extremely hard to dance to? Criminal.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): queen

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Ok, but why does this kinda vibe. What is that breakdown 💀?

**runaway3212** (6.5): The lint stealing the show tbh

**drejski** (6): Decent

**mengzhongmeng** (5): rhythmic gymnastics let's go

**jaztinax** (11): this sounds like if ashley tisdale and vanessa hudgens came together to make a k-pop song and honestly this hits all my spots

**rslashpoopheads** (11): retweet if you know about hurricane penis

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): the queen is here

**CrimsonROSET** (10): *aggressive breakdancing*

**duochromepalmtree** (10): giving Britney blackout in the best way. I would’ve lost my mind to this song in college

**GARjuna** (10): goddamn

**ivyleaf33** (10): electronicnetic supersonic bionic energy - sm's english lyricist strikes again

**mengzhongmeng** (10): AAAAHHHH-AAAAH HU-HU-HU-HURRICANE PENUSSSSS WHOA!  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ty_LKRa3XNU

**plastichaxan** (10): put on a robotic voice saying words similar to electronic supersonic and everything that rhymes and you got me there

**sage** (10): best song ive ever heard hyperpop avant garde

**saviorARMY101** (10): ELECTRONIC MANIC SUPERSONIC BIONIC ENERGY

**seanderlust** (10): this feels like a song from 2009 that charted poorly that popheads SWEARS is the greatest song ever recorded. and ykw? they might be right.

**skargardin** (10): BOP

**throwaway7650** (10): the titular hook is so catchy, great chorus production!

**wavingwolves** (10): the supersonic hypertrophic era of sm entertainment has yet to be topped

**Jhe116** (9.5): It’s a hit

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this is so early 2010s (non-derogatory) <3 BoA showing support for Bionic, so true!

**bigbigbee** (9): I got into K-pop around 2010 so this was the first BoA comeback I experienced in real time, and even then I remember people talked about her like this was a legacy artist. It’s insane that she had ten years of experience under her belt then, despite being only 23. That’s the same as Irene of Red Velvet when she **debuted**! Anyway this song is probably somewhat divisive now - it’s VERY much of its time – but I looped it like crazy back then and I’m still fond of it now.

**bookthieving** (9): sm peaked in their electronic manic supersonic bionic loverholic robotronic era (the kwangya era is coming close though)

**lagozzino** (9): I think this might actually be the first kpop song I ever heard. I remember the video playing in an internet cafe and deperately wanting to know what language she was singing in. I actually already knew who Boa was, but I had only ever heard of her as a jpop act and had no idea at the time that she was korean)

**QustoMar** (9): Objectively, Hurricane Venus may be considered an absolute hot mess of a song, birthed out of the electro-pop craze that took over SM between singles such as Ring Ding Dong, Nu ABO, and Run Devil Run. But imo, Hurricane Venus is camp, it’s iconic, it’s a bop, it serves, yeah…

**runaway3212** (9): This is good because it's Eat You Up again

**vayyiqra** (9): ~~Rocket number 9, take off to the planet, to the planet Venus~~ No really, I hear a lot of Gaga influence on BoA, and I'm not mad about it. This is a banger.

**xavieryes** (9): insert gaga comment here

**bbfan132** (8.5): an early 2010s electronic bop

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I'm living for the pre-chorus! The production is amazing! And her voice too!

**BeauMeringue212** (8.4): The auto tune is a bit heavy for me but the chorus is so catchy

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8): this was really the turning point in BoA’s career. It started off her whole badass girl crush era. And please don’t come at me for calling it “badass girl crush”, it’s the closest approximation I had. Also the Jo Kwon cover… exists.

**abcd9muses** (8): I loved this, title is amazing so I should have known a bop was in store

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (8): Could be an f(x) or a Shinee song.

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): OH OH OH HURRICANE VENUS [KOREAN VOCAL SLAYAGE]

**nt96** (8): Hurricane PENIS

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): is this her Witness / Artpop/ bionic/flop era?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.4): Some nice Britney vibes here.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.2): not actually as much a fan of her electropop phase as i should be on paper but i think it's because she just sounds better before and after so it might be how the songs around this time were mixed

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): oh this production really has not aged well has it?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): Giving early Gaga [2]

**Kwcty6888** (7): doesn’t really stand the test of time for me

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): “electronic manic supersonic bionic energy” is the cousin of “loverholic robotronic”

**fadedblue09** (0): gurl BYE this excessive AutoTune mess is making my ears bleed.

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): lady gaga caused a plague on pop music for years

**QustoMar** (11): Oh I adore everything about Play. The production, attitude, music video, everything. IDK it's just all perfection for me. One thing that is quite funny to me is that the fake Sims UI in the video is much cooler graphic design than anything done by EA. If Jolin Tsai produced The Sims, half of the expansions would've been in the base game I just know it.

**SFbby** (11): This song was my first introduction to Jolin, and it truly has everything you could want from a pop star - eye-catching visuals, a catchy beat, soaring vocals for a pre-chorus, social commentary, and a dance break with simple but effective moves - all bolstered of course, by Jolin's natural star power and ability to chameleon through any concept imaginable. Anyways, I played this song for my mom once and it was apparently "too loud" for her :/

**2dina3dworld** (10): this one actually goes hard, and it’s sounds like a song that’d have a fan chant section that also goes hard

**akanewasright** (10): THIS IS CAMP AND IT FUCKS ITS UNSTOPPABLE

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I miss the early 2010s when the songs were all noisy bangers like this one

**fadedblue09** (10): Very cheeky and irreverent, from the lyrics to the MV

**GARjuna** (10): A FUCKING SERVE I don't care what anyone says. You NEED to see her fucking mama performance. Eats the kpop stars for fucking breakfast

**Jhe116** (10): She has done it again. Another inescapable hit by Jolin Tsai. The MV is a little iam14andthisisdeep but yas anti-capitalism queen. I’ve been to the now-closed hipster café in the MV. The place was pretty and food was like, okay. Anyways stream her MAMA performance

**mengzhongmeng** (10): Gay gamers keep winning. Found this video through a tumblr gifset around the time it was released and it's still so! good! The scenes with the hipster couple battle is funny every single time, she looks stunning in all the looks and the song is iconic, dubstep in pop done well.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): hate the dubstep but bee was right, the MV for this totally did increase my score LOL

**nt96** (10): Rhianna found dead in a ditch with a long pink ribbon wrapped around her neck.

**Osaka1268** (10): queen of the sims

**plastichaxan** (10): this is hyperpop

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok the song is kinda bad but the MV is so good i don’t care

**Roxieloxie** (10): the music video is so iconic i have to give this song 3 points based on that

**runaway3212** (10): Work Bitch (non-derogatory)

**saviorARMY101** (10): ICONIC

**skargardin** (10): This music video might be the most camp thing I've ever seen omg

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah this is aggressively early-2010s club music (god that EDM drop lol) but it bangs so I'm turning it up. Idc.

**xavieryes** (10): I'm amazed at the diversity of her styles

**bbfan132** (9.5): such a bop ugh

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9.5): Ok, but the production didn't have to go that hard!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): the drop is kinda dated but it slaps enough for me not to care

**ignitethephoenix** (9.2): this transports me back to the early 2010’s

**wavingwolves** (9.2): sounds like something a kpop boygroup would release in 2014 which means i love it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.1): This takes me back to the kind of music they would play in my high school weight room except sung by a woman (and therefore better).

**1998tweety** (9): bops HARD

**rslashpoopheads** (9): stream Chungha - Play

**seanderlust** (8.5): very early 2010s (complimentary)

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): the faux-DJ Snake production really hits

**apatel27** (8): the EDM drops are a bit grating now but 10/10 MV

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Her rapping sounds good! Also surprisingly don't mind the 2012 dubstep chorus

**celladonn** (8): Teeters on the edge of being annoying but it's pretty fun

**jasannn** (7.5): It's giving drops in K-pop that are so bad that it's good.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): i’m not sure how i feel about the drop but the build up is soooo good

**throwaway7650** (7.5): hyperpop - this song really just experimenting with different types of fart noises huh - but I can't get over the MV (an 11) encapsulating all of the wildest aspects of chinese CFs... it's the most camp thing in this rate by far

**sarcasticsobs** (7.3): rap queen. pre-chorus rules. not high at all on the beat drop choruses

**abcd9muses** (7): I'm actually familiar with this song/era, I should have gotten into Jolin back then!

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**ivyleaf33** (7): this is so fucking weird but it's fun af so who cares

**drejski** (5): As mediocre as the Western versions of this sound

**duochromepalmtree** (5): okay I don’t love this sound but I love that she took it there and tried it. Just doesn’t fully work for me

**CrimsonROSET** (4): :grinny:

**sage** (4): giving early got7

**bulforster** (3.6): these ugly ass drops...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): i hate when songs have choruses like this. i dont wanna hear fart noises when i listen to music.

**SmileAndTears** (0): Oh god. Bestie what is this?

**mengzhongmeng** (11): the intro, the bridge, beginning to end pop perfection

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song goes so crazy hard it really does

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I really love the production on here and it’s just a solid bop

**nt96** (10): Me when I'm on Yahoo answers trying to finish my homework

**rslashpoopheads** (10): god this fucks so hard Bella Poarch can't relate BoA built that bitch

**TiltControls** (10): my BoA fave! Just such a bop

**vayyiqra** (10): The vaguely Middle Eastern hook to this sounds like pop music that would be playing in the background in the futuristic city setting of *Blade Runner* and I mean that in the best way possible.

**sage** (9.8): smash

**jasannn** (9.5): ✨hello mr. perfect ✨

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): luv the instrumental

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (9.5): I thought that the song was ending like a solid minute before it did lol

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): tech savvy queen

**stryxen** (9.5): omg i’m a crazy guy this song is for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.2): Oh yeah this is just the right type of weird for me.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me grabbing the scores from the pastebin to the google doc and from the google doc to the reddit message

**GARjuna** (9): queen rly decided to do straight bops huh

**RandomHypnotica** (9): those little piano chords in the post-chorus sound so… sus

**1998tweety** (8.5): i love britney spears

**runaway3212** (8.5): irreplacable could never

**seanderlust** (8.5): men are objects [2]

**throwaway7650** (8.5): that main instrumental hook is catchy af, I'll give it that

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): That hook is gonna be stuck in my head.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): the prechorus is much better than the actual chorus tbh

**abcd9muses** (8): I love BoA when she's spicy, I think this is one of my favorite spoken-word song intros ever

**akanewasright** (8): I see how this would be annoying, but I like annoying things sometimes. I stan charli, I accidentally befriended a capital G Gamer once, and

**apatel27** (8): Fitting lyrics in beat a bit awkward at times

**bbfan132** (8): the intro… lmfao

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Email my heart the re-up

**ivyleaf33** (8): i live for the choreography

**plastichaxan** (8): queen shit

**QustoMar** (8): The opening monologue is so contrived I love it, it reminds me of Gina Liano's [deck of cards metaphor](https://twitter.com/nevermindaj/status/1367643014202540036?s=21).

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): you have no idea how scared i was that the audio sample at the beginning was gonna be repeated throughout the whole song and this was gonna be the kpop version of the light is coming

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): the intro is a little cheesy but still a banger

**hookerofpop** (7): a bit forgetful

**fadedblue09** (5): I think at this point she has grown vocally but the production is really irritating

**SmileAndTears** (3): This aint it

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is grunge

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): banger but what's with the deep voiced man demanding that I give him satisfaction

**celladonn** (10): This absolute slutbop, she served

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): thot bop is basically an automatic 8+ from me and this one legit BANGS

**frogaranaman** (10): so true

**jaztinax** (10): this is lowkey everything

**lagozzino** (10): Oh shit this fucks.

**plastichaxan** (10): we love a hyperpop moment from the girlies

**rslashpoopheads** (10): an absolute serve they don't do it like this anymore

**saviorARMY101** (10): BANGER

**seanderlust** (10): this reminds me for some reason of blackout by britney spears, which yes is a HIGH compliment. or maybe if late 2000s-early 2010s kylie minogue had been produced by danja.

**wavingwolves** (10): glass breaking noises in pop song are one of my favourite genres

**xavieryes** (10): push me, and then just touch me, till i can get my

**pleasegivemeasword** (9.5): cmon cmon shimmy to me!!!

**runaway3212** (9.5): Rolling Stones simply could never

**throwaway7650** (9.5): she's serving cunt your honor (on the album cover too!)

**bulforster** (9.1): bi anthem?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): This slaps!! What a cool beat. I like when Jolin is in this pocket. And I love this bridge.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): if you teach a spin class and this isn’t on your playlist you legally have to give everyone a refund

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): i’m twerking

**nt96** (9): Notice how there's a clear cut between her sweet pop songs and edgy diva songs. I feel this is where it transitions.

**skargardin** (9): its the smasha

**vayyiqra** (9): I totally hear the comparison with *X* here, and also the synths make me think of *The Fame*.  Also I'm not at all surprised Jolin would do voguing since I said in my comment on "Show Your Love" that it sounded like 90s Madonna.

**ivyleaf33** (8.9): THE HIP THRUSTS

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes a slut bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): hold on, this is a serve…

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Darude Sandstorm but make it fabulous.

**mengzhongmeng** (8.5): joints and bones, who?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): This is so good. The production! The vocals! Everything is perfect.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): slutbop alert

**sage** (8): this is such a slay giving 2000s electro bops

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): extra points for the hyperpop break at the end

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): based on the album cover and song this sounds like her Good Girl Gone Bad Era

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): This was going great until we got to the outro

**abcd9muses** (7): such a dirty beat, needs to be heard in a club

**apatel27** (7): A club track through and through

**bigbigbee** (7): “I want your satisfaction. I want your satisfaction. I want your- (will. i. am voice) BRING. THE ACTION.” my enthusiastic suggestion for revising this song

**QustoMar** (6.5): This kinda feels like it is what Butterfly was supposed to be, but I still need more pizzaz and action.

**BeauMeringue212** (6.3): I like parts of the song but it doesn't really come together for me

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): when she says “1, 2, 3, 4” at the start of the song she literally sounds EXACTLY like someone else saying “1, 2, 3, 4” in another song but I don’t know which one, I think it might be Kylie Minogue, but anyway it’s driving me nuts. More to the point, I can’t really make up my mind on how I feel about this song. The verses are kind of compelling but the pre-chorus and chorus bug the crap out of me. I like the bridge/breakdown too though.

**drejski** (5): Starts off great but never really goes anywhere

**stryxen** (5): mess! Slightly enjoyable mess but mess!

**SmileAndTears** (4.5): "Welcome to my world boys and girls" 👀👀👀👀 Bisexual queen??

**fadedblue09** (4): Not too fond of this dark club sound, and the outro feels shoehorned

**CrimsonROSET** (0): the best part of the song is the extensive use of the pottery smash

**akanewasright** (10): I’m sorry ghost’s phcj “fetishes in Jolin videos” shitpost is all I can think of when I hear this now

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): loooove how percussive the production in this is, and the buildup to that "antidrop" right before the chorus is so good. musically one of the oddest songs in the rate and i mean that as a high compliment

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song is just COOL. very cool production and it sounds like it could be a hit right now. How is that drop not a popular tik tok sound?????

**GARjuna** (10): I LOVE the mv and this is my favorite album by her

**mengzhongmeng** (10): her best song and mv, methinks

**Roxieloxie** (10): another one thats really enhanced by the video, I just really love her having her 'fuck you im a bad bitch moment' with this song

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): I had a feeling that her newer songs would be great and I was right. This is so good!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): This is a very cool beat with all the tongue-clicking, I'm into it! And the chorus is one of the more unique and creative ways I've heard in a 10s EDM song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): BOP!! with good lyrics too

**2dina3dworld** (9): Jolin Tsai was doing anti drops before it was cool

**bbfan132** (9): total bop, great production

**cremeebrulee** (9): hm there’s a lot of interesting production choices i really like here but i wish it had more of a chorus

**runaway3212** (9): I liked this better the first time I heard it

**TiltControls** (9): fuck that food looked so good

**abcd9muses** (8.5): this is like one of the tightest production I've heard so far, then I saw that it's from 2018 so it makes sense lol

**QustoMar** (8.5): An experimental moment. This isn’t an immediate bop the way that a song like Play is, but idk I feel kinda satisfied hearing this after listening to all of Jolin’s other singles because of the artistic journey she has been through.

**throwaway7650** (8.5): the prechorus slays, the MV is an absolute serve too

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**apatel27** (8): The beat will be divisive but I like it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): kind of a mess but also a giant bop

**celladonn** (8): She made some points but I found the drop a little underwhelming

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the airhorns get me everytime

**ivyleaf33** (8): one of the few mando rap parts i can stand

**sarcasticsobs** (8): i still can only think of “drop it like it’s hot” when i hear tongue-clicking in a song. *Love* the beat for the first half of the chorus and those synths that kick in for a bit in the second verse. unsure of the rap but not a big deal

**skargardin** (8): Jolin is serving visuals with these videos OMG

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is hyperpop

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The drop feels a lil empty

**sage** (7.5): the drop ate

**rslashpoopheads** (7): thank you for supporting my makeup line Ugly Beauty! *is smoking hot even with no makeup*

**vayyiqra** (7): This was one of the most interesting songs to read about. The concept being about body image and self-doubt was based at least, which made up for the song itself being kind of mid.

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): this has some of the best production of all the Jolin Tsai songs in this rate so I wanna rate it highly but I just… don’t… like it all that much

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**SmileAndTears** (6): I don't really like it but it was very interesting visually

**stryxen** (6): the section that just sounds like someone in the studio was wearing really squeaky shoes kinda invented hyperpop actually

**drejski** (5): Boring

**seanderlust** (5): my hair stylist trying to be nice to me while describing my face shape

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): I CAN’T DO TONGUE CLICKS IN SONGS.

**moooo566** (11): between this and jazzclub, but i figured jolin will probably get slaughtered by kpop/jpop stans so i've got to represent

**akanewasright** (10): I did a song called “I am not yours” for choir! It was a really touching song about unrequited love, and it was easily my favorite of the concert. Anyway, Jolin and Namie could castrate me and I’d think they were right to do so.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): girl power anthem

**bbfan132** (10): it’s the serve.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): extra point for namie (who would've fit this rate musically better than hikki tbh!)

**ivyleaf33** (10): the world was never ready for jolin tsai and namie amuro girlbossing on the same track

**Osaka1268** (10): god i love namie amuro honestly we need a jpop divas rate

**plastichaxan** (10): two queens maximizing their joint slay

**saviorARMY101** (10): LEGENDS, ICONS, QUEENS

**skargardin** (10): NANANANANANANANA!!!

**TiltControls** (10): another 11 candidate!! this is so good!!!

**wavingwolves** (10): next time i lament i don't have a girlfriend i'll just say "i'm my own girl" to myself

**Kwcty6888** (9.6): queen shit only

**celladonn** (9.5): Serves on serves on serves

**QustoMar** (9.5): Objectively, this song is not that good and the lyrics could use some work. HOWEVER, if you embrace this as an iconic early-2010s bop with one of the top divas of China and one of the top divas of Japan… you can get let go of that. This is excellent. I love how Namie did not get up for a moment in the music video in while Jolin powered through the choreo and sets.

**fadedblue09** (9): It's a crime this isn't on Spotify cuz wow what a serve! The drop is off putting at first but I can overlook it

**runaway3212** (9): I really am enjoying the will.i.am drops here

**throwaway7650** (9): 2 legends collabing again, I'm yassing

**vayyiqra** (9): Unapologetic EDM banger; it slaps.

**duochromepalmtree** (8.7): mirror mirror on the wall boys are stupid let them fall

**1998tweety** (8.5): Two icons

**Jhe116** (8.5): I feel like this duo could do more than this, but it actually sounds better than I remembered

**mengzhongmeng** (8.5): stan a pair of smart queens, boys are INDEED stupid

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): queens. not into the post-chorus but loved the EDM of it all for the rest

**abcd9muses** (8): queens of women empowerment!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): it feels like we’re on the way to kill a man are we gonna kill a man

**GARjuna** (8): honestly it's a bit of a shame this is her most popular song internationally when there's so many better songs in her discog. It's a bop tho

**sage** (7.8): smash

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this era of her gives me Kylie Minogue vibes I have to admit

**jasannn** (7.5): It sure does sound like 2014 pop music.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): toxic girlboss anthem

**2dina3dworld** (7): it was good until the really weird drop

**drejski** (7): Reminds me of some other song

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this is such a gaga demo but i’m living

**seanderlust** (7): very early 2010s (derogatory)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): ✨ Girlboss ✨ anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): this is the east asian equivalent of cascada

**SmileAndTears** (6): This chorus gives me a headache. Cool video tho!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.2): sometimes these older EDM sounds work for me, but here it drags for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The nah nah nahs did bring it down for me. Not a big nah nah nah fan.

**stryxen** (5): it started it played it ended i forgot it

**bulforster** (4): these ugly ass drops (attached to better verses)...

**rslashpoopheads** (3): this sounds like a Monsta X song full offense

**fadedblue09** (11): Idk how this is received within her discography but this just unearthed some nostalgia in me

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (11): I love this song. I have never heard it before, but I love it.

**2dina3dworld** (10): this sounds like Leave it All to Me

**bulforster** (10): I'm a simple gay, give me an unts-unts dance groove and I'm sold

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): for whatever reason, instead of reading as corny/overdone, in this song EVERY musical cliche just works for me and by the end I’m losing my damn mind

**frogaranaman** (10): so true

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this song is laced with something

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Really light and pleasant and dreamy, this just clears my mind and makes me happy

**saviorARMY101** (10): This feels very nostalgic for me, even though I had never heard this song before this rate, it feels like a song from my childhood.

**throwaway7650** (10): the intro reminds me of viva la vida (I love disco [2])

**TiltControls** (10): me when i'm living around the arctic circle

**seanderlust** (9.5): okay it's a bop but for real, a place where the sun never sets sounds like hell. i need to SLEEP!!!! i am TIRED!!!!!!!!! leave me ALONE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**apatel27** (9): Has a really nice vibe

**drejski** (9): I'm pretty sure KARA's Honey has the same chord structure as this song and I love that song

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): okay finally she’s giving us some great songs. also gave this an extra half point because the MV is filmed in london

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I feel like this is the perfect New Years Eve song if that makes sense

**jasannn** (8.5): Sounds like V-Pop my parents will blast during karaoke

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): slaps

**1998tweety** (8): cute bop

**akanewasright** (8): There are a few songs before this that I like a lot, but THIS is the start of the Jolin music I really like

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): don't have much to say except it's a bop

**bbfan132** (8): this bops, i was dancing along the whole time

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): tbh this reminds me a bit of Light Years Kylie

**nt96** (8): Feels like a hug from an old friend that you haven't seen in a long time.

**runaway3212** (8): She went to the uk and immediately stole Coldplay's melody, we love reverse colonization!

**skargardin** (8): instant serotonin I think

**vayyiqra** (8): I want to see that movie where Jolin plays a secret agent of which Ghost-Quartet spoke. That sounds awesome.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): The vocals are soooo good!

**bigbigbee** (7): This song reminds me of one that would be used in as the opening of a 2000s drama, and the final episode would have like, a piano ballad version of this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It’s not necessarily standing out but this bop does it’s job.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): It kinda doesn’t go anywhere, but at this point, I’ll take it

**abcd9muses** (6): I think this is one of her more generic dance songs, but it still does it for me!

**sage** (6): i got bored by the end but its cute

**duochromepalmtree** (5): one of the weaker songs in this rate

**mengzhongmeng** (4): Song is sweet, I guess, but what put me off is seeing Alexander Bard's (Army of Lovers, BWO etc.) name in the credits... he got fired from his position as a judge on "Sweden Got Talent" in 2020, not for being rude and unnecessarily cruel to the contestants (which he was) but for being a racist piece of shit. Hate to see his name here, Jolin deserves better </3

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): Exposed for being in the Sheena Ringo hive, I regret nothing!

**lagozzino** (11): I'm a big Ringo fan and I dreamed of seeing these two perform this song together at the 2020 Olympics, but alas it was not meant to be

**sage** (11): this is actually so good wait.... i had never heard this before but im living

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): the jazz vibes on this track are immaculate

**bbfan132** (10): this pairing is iconic, i loved the jazzy sound here!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ykw this actually came very close to stealing my 11 from boa like, the absolute DRAMA in this omg it could be a glamorous movie theme

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I love this song

**skargardin** (10): I truly wasn't ready for this omg

**throwaway7650** (10): this song featuring 2 legends is just exquisite. the dramatics, the jazz-y/broadway influence, the orchestral arrangement... *chef's kiss*

**wavingwolves** (10): this is intense and i love it

**QustoMar** (9.5): I love hearing Utada experiment more with their songs because I think this is when they truly shine. Like in this song, the more sensual yet weird vibe is so great, and I think Sheena and Utada's voices really meld together.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): OH YESSS this is what i love. the modern take on jazz sounds so sexy and i love the way their voices compliment each other. also theyre playing tetris in the music video so im giving it an extra half point based on that alone.

**Kwcty6888** (9.4): I love this sultry vibe for hikki and their voice really pairs well with sheena

**1998tweety** (9): omg this is NICE

**apatel27** (9): Sheena Ringo never misses. Not a 10  or 11 cause this is her song and not Utada's

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**jasannn** (9): The harmonizing in this is amazing.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): i’m bopping

**runaway3212** (9): Pokemon could never

**SFbby** (9): Where's my sensual tetris game? Feeling scammed by Facebook Tetris Friends now :/

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I love the way that it just explodes into the chorus! Their voices really go well together too.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): This feels too sophisticated and fancy to be listening to on popheads, it feels illegal, like I've snuck into a jazz lounge for smart people and I'm witnessing something profound that I should not be.

**mengzhongmeng** (8.5): so classy, the music video is amazing, perfect fit for the song

**BeauMeringue212** (8): This is a lovely duet and the instrumentation is great

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me when they ask what is the generation 7 of pokemon games called

**jaztinax** (8): this is so chaotic sounding but i love it

**ivyleaf33** (7.7): i love homoerotic tetris

**akanewasright** (7.5): when I throw ass to this jazz song

**seanderlust** (7.5): the big band backing instrumentals is so fun

**duochromepalmtree** (7): it is so amazing how they cover so many different sounds! I appreciate this one for what it is but the mixing isn’t great and it isn’t my absolute favorite.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): the melody isn't particularly appealing but I LOVE what the band is serving here!

**vayyiqra** (7): I feel like Sheena Ringo is too WaCkY for me to get the appeal of her music but this is good. I'm a big jazz fan and there's a strong influence from that genre here especially the piano. This song is kind of a mess but I appreciate they went for something different here.

**abcd9muses** (6.5): love a jazzy duo, at time it felt too busy though, but that's also why I ended up giving it a slightly higher score because it's daring

**2dina3dworld** (6): I love experimental music

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.4): Kind of gets a little cluttered sounding in the middle there.

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): I want to love this and on paper I should - it’s jazzy and ambitious and interesting! It has Shiina Ringo! And a harp drop! - but it just… doesn’t sound good to me. Too noisy.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): The instrumentation is all over the place

**drejski** (4): Not into this type of jazz

**apatel27** (11): A strong LGBT+ anthem telling you to stay true to yourself. You are you and there's nothing wrong with you. Don't apologise for being yourself. Dedicated to Yeh Yung Chih.

**bookthieving** (11): i can't think about this song for too long or i'll start crying

**saviorARMY101** (11): I just wanna thank Ms Jolin for making this beautiful masterpiece. I'm so grateful for the lyrics and message of this song, they really speak to my soul. Absolutely brilliant.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Love this, this is gonna be on repeat for me

**Jhe116** (10): This song is a tribute to 葉永鋕. He died in 2000 at the age of 14 or 15. The cause was an accident; he went to the restroom and tripped. However, he was also bullied for his effeminacy, to a point that he dared not go to the restroom when there’s other boys in presence. As a result, he usually went to a restroom that’s relatively remote in the campus, during class, alone. The accident happened during one of his visits to that restroom. It appears like a safety problem in campus, but you would wonder if we could’ve avoided all this had people had a different mindset. Three years after the accident, Taiwan hosted our very first pride march. Whenever Taiwan reached a new landmark in Queer right movement, we would rewind on this tragedy.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): THREW THE FIRST BRICK AT STONEWALL!!! song bops, great lyrics with an emotional background...what more could you want??

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The production on this track is so interesting, it's got this nostalgic, sad, kinda cold feel but also incredibly danceable, thematically the song is really beautiful, and it just really comes together as a delicate, yet upbeat track (that somehow manages to get airhorns to not sound obnoxious?!)

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): love how moody this is omg

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): I just love her so much

**fadedblue09** (9): Love the message and subtle vocal delivery

**ignitethephoenix** (9): a solid song and a queer anthem we better be stanning

**QustoMar** (9): So so gorgeous and heartfelt.

**throwaway7650** (9): an anthem but what a tragic backstory to the lyrics </3

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.5): I hate that this has that airhorn sound effect in the background because it really comes close to ruining an otherwise gorgeous song

**runaway3212** (8.5): a bit repetitive but great nonetheless, especially the lyrics

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): yeah women

**bbfan132** (8): <3

**seanderlust** (8): trans rights baybey!!!!

**skargardin** (8): the dance video.. ok go off

**vayyiqra** (8): As well as having a cool atmospheric sound, I like that this song (like "Ugly Beauty") also has a good concept, being against bullying and for acceptance of gender nonconformity. Once again Jolin seems based as hell.

**wavingwolves** (7.9): the horns are so flavourful

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): I feel like I could totally hear this as an Ariana grande song and I mean that in a good way!!

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): chill bop

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**ivyleaf33** (7): honestly though her consistent support for the lgbtq+ community really means so much

**stryxen** (7): someone ik said this sounds like a vibrator ad so i think she succeeded

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): artists taking words that have “man” in them and spelling it as “mxn” isnt the serve they think it is

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): This is kinda calming. Idk it's just a vibe.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): she looks gorgeous in the album art, but that’s kinda it

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's aight

**sage** (6): idk how to feel about this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.8): The airhorn lmao.

**abcd9muses** (5): this sounds like any other trop pop inspired song

**jasannn** (5): Where's the energy?

**plastichaxan** (5): i understand how this is great it's just not for me

**2dina3dworld** (11): this is Cannibal for kpop stans ~~and it’s also better~~

**GARjuna** (11): UGGGH THIS IS SO GOOD!!! And her DANCING!!!!!!!

**runaway3212** (11): I love vore

**abcd9muses** (10): I do feel biased and predictable for giving the only completely English song and probably most recognizable song for U.S. listeners a 10, but this is honestly the perfect pop song regardless of spoken language. It still holds up after all these years, or maybe that's there nostalgia talking

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this MV looks like a mid 10s youtube cover but i have nostalgia so this is a compliment

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I would give up my entire life to hear Britney do a cover of this song!!!!! This is so good!!!!

**hookerofpop** (10): she ate

**jaztinax** (10): and ate me up she did

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): trashy electropop done right, take notes jolin

**nt96** (10): BoA's threatening to eat up her rivals, Utada thinking this will be an easy breezy win, Jolin's snatching these bitches' wigs with her honey trap. Competition's heated!

**plastichaxan** (10): i was ready to give this a very low score due to not finding it anywhere but the payoff when i could listen to it was too much

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): queen of cannibalism in music, Kesha is shaking

**saviorARMY101** (10): I'm afraid she was too ahead of her time for the American girlies.

**wavingwolves** (10): this not being available to me on spotify is a fucking CRIME i need to speak to the manager of spotify about this

**akanewasright** (9.9): Kinda dated but it fucks and it’s been in my head all day

**sage** (9.5): she ate this up

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): I don’t like the yum yum lyrics but otherwise I like it a lot and it’s very fun.

**ivyleaf33** (9): yes queen eat me up

**skargardin** (9): FINALLY some good food

**1998tweety** (8.5): she ate this up

**bbfan132** (8.5): this flopped?? it shouldn’t have, it’s a great late 00s song

**celladonn** (8.5): I did not like this on first listen but it keeps growing on me. There's a good chance that by the time the reveal happens I'll be kicking myself for not giving it a 10

**jasannn** (8.5): yummy yummy in my tummy

**QustoMar** (8.5): I will eat up any trashy late-2000s club banger idgaf.

**TiltControls** (8.5): eat you up, that's good for it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): reddit eating my previous rate submissions

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): The production is so good! This is a whole bop.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): this would be a 10 if it was available internationally on Spotify (yes I am being petty she is denying me this bop)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): Giving early Gaga, I'm not mad at it

**Roxieloxie** (7.5): Theres something about how they processed her voice and the track that almost makes her sounds like she's a half second off of the rhythm of the track in certain parts. like the fact that theres a version of this with flo rida on it tells me everything

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): where's Girls on Top

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): She reminds me so much of Britney its insane

**throwaway7650** (7.5): I keep waiting for the song to speed up but it just doesn't

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it gives me Britney Spears vibes

**vayyiqra** (7): I always knew "Toxic" was an OVERRATED song (fight me) and this song being produced by the guy who wrote it PROVES it nah I'm just trolling. This song has weird lyrics and sonically it's trying too hard to be Gaga-like, but I don't hate it, though it should be sped up a bit. Otherwise it's fine I guess. (But for real "Toxic" is a bit overrated tho :eyes:)

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.8): wait this is a britney moment

**seanderlust** (6.5): "i wanna take you to my room/i'll eat you up" - me getting a pizza delivered

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds like a song someone wouldve made a onceler amv to back when tumblr was still obsessed with him

**OliviaGodrigo** (5): janet would eat this up. but boa doesn't sound good on this.

**stryxen** (5): this sounds like a halloween song but too much halloween not enough song

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.7): you're perfect you're beautiful you look like linda evangelista you're a model everything about you is perfect did you stone those tights? oh you're smiling! they eat her up every single time she's on that damn stage she doesnt jhbsfjhasbjhsbjf she could release this song and they're like boa-tina your smile is beautiful

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.1): Some bad Britney vibes here.

**fadedblue09** (4): The MV is a serve but I just dislike how this sounds. Also the lyrics are an awkward mess, serving SNSD - The Boys (English ver.) teas

**1998tweety** (11): i know this 11 will flop cause theres no way this is a favourite to win, but come on now, the entrance of the video where shes walking in upside down in heels...pure cunt. the rest of the song is a major bop too.

**2dina3dworld** (10): the Girlboss-ification of BoA

**bookthieving** (10): [jo march voice]

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): feminist anthem

**fadedblue09** (10): Solid performance but the guy whispering “woman” always catches me off guard

**GARjuna** (10): THIS FUCKING UPSIDE DOWN DANCE queen boa invented gravity

**ivyleaf33** (10): i've replayed the opening choreo so many times it's burned into my brain. iconic.

**mengzhongmeng** (10): CHILLS every time, the click-clack of the heels, the upside down walk, I LOVE WOMEN

**Osaka1268** (10): the upside down strut is iconic

**stryxen** (10): lemme (a man) add this to my playlist with woman by doja cat and woman by little simz

**throwaway7650** (10): the choreo for this is ICONIC, your faves actually could never

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): she's serving c*nt your honor

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): bassline makes me ascend. maybe this song plays in Sweetie's head after she says "Let's Go"

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): i just think that woman

**Roxieloxie** (9.5): you know you that bitch when you cause all of this conversation

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): using the sound of high heels walking as percussion… truly innovative

**BeauMeringue212** (9): Love the heavy bassline in this

**runaway3212** (9): wish that were me

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): That baseline is sick! She is a powerhouse vocalist. She makes it sound so effortless.

**bbfan132** (8.5): totally bops

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): girl power anthem 2

**bigbigbee** (8): Good bassline go twangy

**plastichaxan** (8): oh she was serving LOOKS in this

**rslashpoopheads** (8): so true bestie

**saviorARMY101** (8): Could've been a 10 if it weren't so short and how ironic the robot voice who says "woman" is a male voice lol

**vayyiqra** (8): look a predictable high score for an electropop song here on pop heads dot com

**sage** (7.8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): why do the steps remind me of the beginning of Genie? Just need a engine rev

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**hookerofpop** (7): the man’s voice kinda ruined it for me a bit

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): it’s cute

**QustoMar** (6.5): This song is decent enough, but doesn't really stand up (haha) that well by itself without the performance.

**seanderlust** (6.5): this song just reached out to me with an opportunity to be my own boss by selling lularoe

**duochromepalmtree** (6): is this score my internalized misogyny talking???

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): this grew with me, but as with most of the mid-tempo-banger style BoA songs in this rate, part of me also finds it weirdly plodding/hard to listen to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): why does the voice clip that says woman sound so awkward. i hate the way it sounds so much

**abcd9muses** (5): I do like it, but again, not attached to it.

**apatel27** (5): I get what she was going for but the monotone woman is not it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Lmao that "woman" drop is so funny for some reason.

**drejski** (3): One good bassline and nothing else of worth

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): deciding which song got an eleven was so hard but i can’t stop coming back to this song

**xavieryes** (11): It was so fucking hard to pick an 11 because there are so many incredible contenders from all 3 artists, but this song is just pure perfection.

**akanewasright** (10): Ultra Blue is a top tier album in their discography and this is a clear illustration of that. I wouldn’t even call it my favorite or the best off this album, but it’s just… so nice. And the video doesn’t hurt either.

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): this song is late-night loneliness and yearning distilled

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "I don't care about anything" same bestie

**rslashpoopheads** (10): this is so pretty

**seanderlust** (10): i don't care about anything except this song making it to day 3 tbh

**celladonn** (9.5): This is so melodically interesting

**SmileAndTears** (9): OK MX UTADA!!! THEY FINALLY BROUGHT THE BOPS!!

**BeauMeringue212** (8.8): A whole bop

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): this music vid is cute

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): me trying to submit my scores when Reddit keeps refusing to send them

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): I like the guitar instrumental in this one quite a bit. And that xylophone (?) bridge.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Gorgeous vocals, and the MV is adorable. Idk how to feel about those hazy background sound though

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): bop

**runaway3212** (8.5): a very fun bop

**throwaway7650** (8.5): quite like the chorus of this one, cute MV too

**sage** (8): the chorus is saur good

**abcd9muses** (7.5): so otherworldly, the chorus slams into you, but at times I felt like the verses didn't have that strong of a follow through

**bbfan132** (7.5): definitely pretty, but it isn’t fully drawing me in although i do like it

**1998tweety** (7): bops a bit

**2dina3dworld** (7): keep tryin to make a 10, Utada

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): i like the vibe this is going for but it also doesnt really go anywhere? like it feels like it's building up with no real release so it kinda drags after a bit

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): What if I don't wanna keep trying? What if I just wanna be lazy all day and do nothing huh? Do you think about that?

**CrimsonROSET** (6): see the title is funny because this seems like just another attempt to make a better song

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**stryxen** (6): the ending is really weak and made me like this less

**ivyleaf33** (5.5): this song feels like a warm hug

**vayyiqra** (5): Really don't like the melody in the chorus, sadly. The rest is alright.

**duochromepalmtree** (4): this one didn’t resonate with me at all!!! It’s a song that exists.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this sounds like the music that would play when you get placed on hold over the phone

**TiltControls** (11): this song is just gorgeous. definitely one of my faves from their discography!!!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): So I looked up the English lyrics to this song... that was a mistake. They're so sad and happy and UGH I relate and I hate it.

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**akanewasright** (10): Hatsukoi is probably one of my least favorite Hikki albums, but this song is wonderful and lovely. This, Chikai (aka Don’t Think Twice from KHIII), Goodnight, and Pakuchii No Uta are all 10s in a sea of mid scores imo

**fadedblue09** (10): This is like a dancepop song sent from heaven

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): Yet another that just kept getting better

**Roxieloxie** (10): boppy

**seanderlust** (10): okay i like this song but also the "ooooooooh" note on the chorus reminds me of tyra sanchez singing beyonce in the drag race werkroom

**fkadizzy-1804** (9.5): one of my favourite things about Utada’s recent work is the way they’ve started to play (even more) with tempo and time signatures and composition/song structure. It makes everything such a delight to listen to. I’d never heard this song before this rate and I was constantly going “oooh” as I was taken through another unexpected twist or flourish. I do find the high-pitched buzzing synth in the chorus a tiny bit annoying tho.

**BeauMeringue212** (9): This is lovely, love the choir at the end

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i like to imagine this is a direct sequel to flowing cherry blossoms where i’m just crying in the club and just want something cheesy to recover myself

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.6): Play this song!

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): please do

**2dina3dworld** (8): the only thing I have against this is the nasally way some of the sentences are sung. It sounds breathless and through the nose and it’s not fun to listen to

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**SmileAndTears** (8): Bop but also a bit repetitive

**vayyiqra** (8): How to do a piano-heavy song well in this rate.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.6): the piano in this reminds me of Kylie's Magic (which obv came out much later but still)

**QustoMar** (7.5): I think that this more laidback vibe is an interesting switch-up for Utada from their more typical sound while retaining who they are as a music artist.

**runaway3212** (7.5): sure why not

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.2): nice piano

**bbfan132** (7): it’s pretty but not the most memorable song here

**ignitethephoenix** (7): backing choirs at the end of a song are not a choice everyone should so, this includes you Utada

**jaztinax** (7): kinda feels like a carly rae jepsen song

**throwaway7650** (7): play a kpop* song because this could be one melodically

**TragicKingdom1** (6): the kygoprint

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): meh

**abcd9muses** (4): this would be rated higher but it melodically is too... common? I am just used to them really being unique in this area but this is like a lot of pop songs.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): umm

**sage** (3): this is actually kinda bad wait.. what were they thinking

**wavingwolves** (3): actually maybe don't play anything

**bigbigbee** (11): This song was one of the first times I experienced nostalgia for something I didn’t experience. I heard it in college and I remember distinctly practicing the dance to this in secret in the studio before my friends would show up for rehearsal. I love the sunniness of it. The feeling I get listening to this song exemplifies what I think the best “idols” give to their fans - pure happiness.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Some of the best things about 2000s pop are embodied right here.

**bulforster** (10): blows the other early career songs in the rate out of water

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): grandiose!

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG so much!!!!! This is one I had to keep coming back to. So catchy and makes me feel like I’m living in the Lindsey Lohan classic film Get a Clue

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): I love the chorus

**jasannn** (9.5): Into the new world's older sister

**Kwcty6888** (9.4): the high note always gives me goosebumps

**celladonn** (9): Such a warm and fun song

**seanderlust** (8.7): it's giving 90s coming of age teen movie and i love that

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**runaway3212** (8.5): The whole bopper

**2dina3dworld** (8): the way the kpop fandom acts you’d think this song saved kpop but it really does sound like every other song from this era. The first thought I actually had is that it sounds like the 1st generation kpop version of Hyokori Hyotanjima

**apatel27** (8): Disney Channel orignal song

**bbfan132** (8): this bopped, i can see why many artists cover it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I like all the build up, but I wish it’d explode in the final chorus

**fadedblue09** (8): Sounds typical bubblegum pop for its time but still enjoyable.

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**rslashpoopheads** (8): surprisingly good for that generic beat

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this sounds like it would be in high school musical

**GARjuna** (7.5): eating carrots to this rn

**BeauMeringue212** (7.2): giving me very y2k bubblegum, it's cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this must have been used in a 2000’s Korean teen movie, i would bet on it

**jaztinax** (7): disney pop vibes and i’m here for it

**throwaway7650** (7): one of my favorite song titles in the rate but the song doesn't live up to it I fear. anyway stream atlantis by (rate winner) SHINee!

**vayyiqra** (7): look I've got nothing I'm super tired and have been doing this rate for hours now but this is good

**QustoMar** (6.5): This song is cute but I don't see what makes it such an iconic part of BoA's discography? Like it's quite regular, Y2K teen bubblegum pop vibes.

**seanderlust** (11): EVERYBODY FIIIINDS LOOOOVE :floating:

**akanewasright** (10): I can’t believe they wrote this song before everything that happened. This song is devastating either way

**apatel27** (10): The vocals on this

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): oh my god this is beautiful, that ending is on another level

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh this is lovely

**CrimsonROSET** (10): why am i crying

**drejski** (10): The only ballad of theirs I like

**fadedblue09** (10): That final minute is hair-raising

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): Heartbreaking and gorgeous, an agonizingly close runner-up for my 11. Utada’s vocals are at their best; the piano track is similarly beautiful (and perfectly encapsulates the title); and the moment towards the end when the drums kick in, and the ensuing build and climax, is some of the purest catharsis in Utada’s whole discography.

**frogaranaman** (10): so true

**jasannn** (10): The slow climb is so worth the climb.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): wait this song is by them??? i’ve heard another version before but didn’t know there was an original :o but this is just as good

**sarcasticsobs** (10): gorgeous, last minute euphoric

**saviorARMY101** (10): God Hikki is really good at making tearjerker songs. 🥲

**skargardin** (10): one of their best ballads no doubt

**throwaway7650** (10): that part at like 2:40... I died. the drums, the electric guitar, the strings, the synths, the vocals, etc. absolutely heavenly. if I had a 2nd 11, it would go to this song (even though so many here deserve it)

**TiltControls** (10): just gorgeous

**xavieryes** (10): they sure love flowers

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): this is a song that I know would resonate even more knowing the context of it, but the ending of this is absolutely phenomenal wow

**1998tweety** (9): when this song revs up, whew i ascend

**bbfan132** (9): this was gorgeous, wow

**celladonn** (9): Gorgeous ballad

**duochromepalmtree** (9): this is just stunning. And I assume it’s been used in a million movies because it’s incredible and so cinematic

**SmileAndTears** (9): the way this BUILDS. oof. I wouldn't listen to this on a regular basis but it's pretty epic

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): This sounds so beautiful. Their voice in this is amazing. And the prodauction is so good too.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.6): I like this slow burn of a song, very passionate

**mengzhongmeng** (8.5): last minute is euphoric!

**wavingwolves** (8.5): a slowburn song? who else cheered

**Jhe116** (8): They have a way of elevating a song during the second half and the whole thing just transcends

**plastichaxan** (8): this buildup is too good wow

**Roxieloxie** (8): support the anime rate

**BeauMeringue212** (7.7): This sounds so pretty

**abcd9muses** (7.5): a very delicate ballad, it doesn't put you to sleep like I expect ballads to

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is pretty but I am slightly balladphobic and this is making me sleepy even with the grand ending

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): a good ballad yass

**stryxen** (7): catcry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): first 3 minutes is a 4 the last minute and a half is a 10

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.3): Not the most exciting but I do love the drama.

**runaway3212** (6): the buildup is good but it's too ballad-y for me

**2dina3dworld** (4): balladphobia strikes again

**sage** (4): im bored [2]

**vayyiqra** (4): I definitely don't remember this being in the NGE movies either, but it's ... alright. The title is better than the song, honestly. It's just another piano ballad with a dramatic guitar lead. Idk like what is this, "November Rain"

**ivyleaf33** (3): haven't watched this eva movie yet; if i had, i would probably like this song a lot more.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): bit of a snoozer

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): this is the song where i realize i just dont like their voice most of the time

**duochromepalmtree** (11): this song is so DREAMY and CATCHY and BEAUTIFUL. it was close with a couple other songs but there was no way I wasn’t giving this my 11

**fkadizzy-1804** (11): it’s only a masterpiece, right? Somehow it perfectly marries these catchy, bouncy instrumentals and driving groove with ethereal piano riffs and wistful strings and reverb-soaked vocals and lush harmonies and if I could only listen to one song for the rest of my life it wouldn’t be this one just bc Cloudbusting by Kate Bush exists… but if it didn’t, Beautiful World would be next in line

**SmileAndTears** (11): BITCH??? THIS FUCKING SLAPS???

**akanewasright** (10): Okay this version is incredible but the [Da Capo Version](https://open.spotify.com/track/611Za6hN3gmZiIrN5fxuzq?si=8-eFmSDzRlujaK0EkrpbsQ) released this year is one of my favorite Hikki recordings ever. Like literally fucking INCREDIBLE

**Kwcty6888** (10): an euphoric pop masterpiece

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): This song just kept getting better.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): obsessed

**skargardin** (10): They really snapped with the Evangelion themes

**throwaway7650** (10): the eva OSTs are literally so good, all 3 are day 3 material

**vayyiqra** (10): I do not remember this being in NGE despite having watched all of it and the movies only last summer, but it is a really pretty song. This sounds very 2000s in the best way.

**xavieryes** (10): this songs's existence makes the world more beautiful indeed

**abcd9muses** (9): this was one of the songs that got me to seriously dive into Utada, and for that, I'm forever thankful

**mengzhongmeng** (9): *gets in the fucking robot*

**sarcasticsobs** (9): get in the robot, shinji. still prefer the da capo version

**1998tweety** (8.5): nice

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): I wish the world was as beautiful as this song

**Osaka1268** (8.5): bop but the rebuild movies were a mistake

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Sounds a little Eurovision-y to me, in a good way

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): Utada is the only person whose ballads I am interested in.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): why are all of these songs so good omfg

**seanderlust** (8): it is fine but it loses a point for dragging for a while without adding much

**bbfan132** (7.5): could’ve been a bit shorter but still good

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**sage** (7): it was dragging but its a cute bop

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I can't get over their voice! Their falsetto/head voice is so beautiful.

**QustoMar** (6.5): These Utada Hikaru songs around Flavor of Life/Beautiful World feel kinda more by-the-numbers ballads from them if you know what I mean. Like I need more personality from this track!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is lovely, it’s also so long when it doesn't have to be

**fadedblue09** (6): Very lush arrangement but honestly underwhelming for a 5 minute song

**ivyleaf33** (6): i like how the video is basically just an amv

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): This is pretty enough but it's not enchanting me.

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): way too long for a song that goes nowhere musically

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): nge is a very overrated anime

**runaway3212** (4): I'll be honest this is really boring

**2dina3dworld** (3): this is just a wall of noise

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): looks aren't the only thing she's serving, this is a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sP2TCwf2pSo

**ivyleaf33** (10): the rap verse, break, and the chorus are all so fun

**jaztinax** (10): this woman is full of bops wow

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): This is so catchy. I think I'm in love. Very strong contender for my eleven.

**plastichaxan** (10): the gay-pandering worked Ghost i can't lie

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This feels like a song that would appear in a Japanese version of the Pop Rap Rate (in a good way)

**seanderlust** (10): I wonder if saying things are camp will get old by the time this comment is published. anyways it's camp

**xavieryes** (10): banger

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): Oh this one slaps HARD

**throwaway7650** (9.5): actually a massive bop and might be an unfortunate day 1 cut

**drejski** (9): Her best Japanese song

**duochromepalmtree** (9): this would be so good on Drag race!!! Can you imagine! I can. I want it.

**skargardin** (9): this reminds of... something but i can't quite pinpoint what

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): love how this has small moments to breathe before the production goes off

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.7): graphic design is her passion

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): You gotta do the looking by the book!

**fkadizzy-1804** (8): the melody in the chorus could probably be a tiny bit catchier but the vibe and energy on this are so good it doesn’t matter

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): bop

**vayyiqra** (8): this is the exact kind of electro trash we love here isn't it

**wavingwolves** (8): i love a good trashy bop and this fits that bill perfectly

**bbfan132** (7.5): fun single!

**jasannn** (7.5): Bestie could slow down a little.

**stryxen** (7.5): i hate this it’s so good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i would listen to a whole song that sounded like the last 20 seconds

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.4): this sounds like a loud 2010s EDM song. great!

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**QustoMar** (7): This is a bop but I’ll be honest, it doesn't really make much sense at this point in BoA's discography? Like electro-pop diva singing about how she is the hottest QUEEN of all time is more something that belongs on Hurricane Venus, not something to be released by a post-Only One BoA. It kinda reminded me of Namie Amuro's Genic album more than anything.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): stream Shout It Out and Masayume Chasing

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Not my fav, but I still like it. Tbh it was the lyrics.

**sage** (6.8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): the first representative from BoA’s Japanese discography, gosh I wish Meri Kuri was in here.

**akanewasright** (6.5): I’m kinda aggressively mixed on this… can’t decide if it’s a total serve or kinda just loud for the sake of it

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): this sounds like snsd scraps

**runaway3212** (6): Maybe this is worse but I have a soft spot for it

**fadedblue09** (5): This is from 2015 but somehow sounds older than the last 4 songs

**TiltControls** (4): it's fine, but definitely one of the ones I care for least in the rate

**abcd9muses** (2): an immature sound for someone with a long career tbh, the chorus had so much potential to be more interesting

**stryxen** (11): invented genres

**akanewasright** (10): GOD this is so much fun. This isn’t *quite* my favorite version of Jolin yet, but this is pretty fantastic dance pop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this would go off at a club, or at least I think so cause I'm too young to go to clubs

**bookthieving** (10): if my mom was doing this rate, this would be her 11

**duochromepalmtree** (10): yes. Yes. It’s very Britney blackout era for me in the very best way. This song is ADDICTING.

**throwaway7650** (9.5): another great chorus, it's sooo catchy and addictive. mega bop!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): dance-pop deliciousness

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): loon/a bankrupt

**nt96** (9): Homegirl coming after Gaga's wig. Surrender!

**plastichaxan** (9): is this hyperpop?

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a very weird coincidence, but around 2010-11 I took Mandarin lessons from a Taiwanese lady named Butterfly. She said I was doing fairly well and often said my handwriting was good, but I pissed her off a lot by not showing up for and rescheduling lessons. I hope she's doing well now and forgives me. Anyway this song is good. I doubt that Butterfly would like it much though since she seemed to be really into ballads as far as C-pop goes.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.5): I think it’s funny how well this album did commercial compared to its critical reception.

**ivyleaf33** (8.5): invented corsets

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): poor POONA

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): when I watched this with the MV I liked it a lot more, without it, It just felt kinda like a generic bop

**runaway3212** (8.5): I love this song but I can't get over the shirt under corset combination

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.3): This is a bop! Taking me back to early 2010s pop

**BeauMeringue212** (8.2): Her voice really reminds me of Kylie Minogue here for some reason. Chorus is so catchy

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh c’mon electropop phineasdroids and ferbots

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): kind of dated but I dig it

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Reminds me of early T-ARA. I can see the hook drilling into my ears very soon (edit: yes it did)

**jasannn** (7.5): her blackout era

**sage** (7.5): this will probably be stuck in my head for a day

**wavingwolves** (7.2): that autotune moment really elevated my enjoyment

**2dina3dworld** (7): it’s aight but it lacks a certain oomph

**bbfan132** (7): fun production but not the most memorable

**jaztinax** (7): i can’t tell if i think this slaps a lot or not

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this sounds like a eurovision song

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Is it just me or does this sound like Poker Face by Lady Gaga?

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Yup, it’s 2009, that’s for sure!

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.1): this is straight out of the late 2000s

**abcd9muses** (6): this is heavy 2000s vibes, it's fun in that regard

**apatel27** (6): Very late 00s song

**drejski** (6): I like this type of rhythm a lot but I wish the instrumental had been mixed a little differently so the chorus sounds more impactful

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Crazy Town outsold.

**seanderlust** (5): ghost please don't @ me i know you chose to include this because you like it i just...i truly feel nothing.

**QustoMar** (4): I feel this way about quite a few earlier Jolin Tsai songs here but this one especially, I feel like there’s a lot of potential within the song to have some kind of super grand or big moment and nothing happens. Like I feel more is possible but right now this is just a meh late-2000s electropop beat and vocal delivery that does not match :S

**SmileAndTears** (4): Not a fan of this one. It sounds like an attempt at creating a late 00s Black Eye Peas/Lady Gaga song but it's entirely too souless

**rslashpoopheads** (2): yuck

**2dina3dworld** (10): another turning point for BoA - where she transformed into badass mature woman even though she was only like 25 at this point. But such is the fickle nature of the kpop industry, where being over 20 at debut makes you an old maid.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh she sounds lovely doesn’t she

**fadedblue09** (10): FINALLY. A song that does her vocals justice

**hookerofpop** (10): i guess i can’t give this two 1’s

**jasannn** (10): She makes this song and choreo look effortless.

**throwaway7650** (10): BoA collecting men like infinity stones for this song... iconic

**akanewasright** (9.2): is this score partially because the video has some of the best choreo in the rate? Yeah, and what about it?

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I love the piano in this one so much. So catchy

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (9): Classic. I was fourteen or fifteen when I first heard this!

**QustoMar** (9): This is kinda the turning point of BoA's Korean discography when she started becoming who we see her as now. I love hearing how much she has grown as a vocalist, and on top of that the [choreo](https://youtu.be/PQjovLrnvVo)??? Iconic.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): we love a girlboss that writes and produces her own material

**bbfan132** (8.5): really pretty ballad!! i like the vocals quite a bit

**Jhe116** (8.5): Didn’t age as well as expected but I still remembered how iconic when it was released

**GARjuna** (8): please please listen to gallant's cover of this

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I was so obsessed with this song when it came out and probably would've considered it one of my top songs ever. No idea why lol. But it's still a very beautiful song and we need more wholesome music in this day and age!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.8): One of the most musically compelling ballads so far.

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): good ballad

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): don’t love this but it’s really nice

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This is so nice. I love that melody in the chorus. Ugh her voice is so good!

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): sometimes this hits much harder but this is not one of those times and i already know im gonna regret this score once the reveal happens

**abcd9muses** (7): very cute, easy listening

**seanderlust** (7): the lyrics in this one are honestly really well-written and...wait, i'm sorry..this was available to own on USB? twice??

**runaway3212** (6.5): This is decent but compared to the previous songs not as great

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**vayyiqra** (6): I wonder how many songs have the same name as this I feel like it's a lot

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): A pretty boring ballad with weirdly placed EDM background noises

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (5): I don’t go to BoA for ballads

**ivyleaf33** (5): one of those super iconic songs i never got that into

**plastichaxan** (5): BoA's "good song but not for me" moment in the rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): me when im the only person who gives this song a 1 in the rate

**sage** (0): i actually despise this song so much like it has no good qualities + this album is also atrocious

**throwaway7650** (10): the guitar/strings... I'm ascending. the chorus melody is fantastic too. the intonation I mentioned earlier works on this track really well

**xavieryes** (10): if this is the flavor of life then life tastes fucking great

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I want my life to taste like red skittles, but in reality it probably tastes more like purple skittles

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.4): Song tastes good!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): bop

**runaway3212** (9): COME THROUGH STRINGS

**vayyiqra** (9): Idk why but this is giving me the fuzzy brain chemicals. It's like ASMR.

**akanewasright** (8.6): This song was essentially a full comeback for Hikki after Ultra Blue underperformed a little. Ultra Blue was really successful, don’t get me wrong, but the physical sales of the singles and album weren’t as high as they once were because people were buying the album and singles on iTunes. Japanese charts/certifications were based on physical sales at the time (the oricon charts didn’t count physical single sales until 2017), so while the album was pretty much a smashing success by today’s standards in EVERY metric, it wasn’t viewed that way. So to make a comeback from that, Hikki kind of… doubled down on their digital success. This song sold RIDICULOUSLY well across the board. Like… literally the best selling single in Japanese history, partially due to its success as a ringtone and in the full song. And the song itself? Yeah it’s pretty nice. Nowhere near my favorite Utada song, but still really good.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**sage** (8.5): rly good

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): cute bop

**bbfan132** (8): super pretty, liked this for sure

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**mengzhongmeng** (8): love the outro!

**rslashpoopheads** (8): *insert kirby gif here*

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I'm gonna have that chorus stuck in my head all day. And what's even worse is I don't know the words so I can't sing along.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): I really like Utada’s voice, though I think this song doesn’t do much for me because I am of a generation with a shorter attention span. I do think some of instrumental choices are interesting and maybe would make more immediate sense to me if I spoke any Japanese.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Their vocals are gorgeous and the instrumental is lush, but this song ultimately lacks punch.

**abcd9muses** (7): this song has some of the elements that make them the monarch of video game OST. Chorus is amazing, but other parts were disinteresting.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): tastes like cherry

**nt96** (7): Who's gonna tell Utada to grab that food item on their shoulder? It lowers your damage percentage.

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I just wasn’t excited about this one. Sort of forgettable.

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): there's really no flavor to this

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this song makes me feel like I'm walking through a mysterious yet beautiful forest on a foggy morning in late fall

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is beautiful, I love it! So soothing

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is so good wait

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): so dreamy holy shit i love it

**saviorARMY101** (10): Beautiful, gorgeous, brilliant

**Kwcty6888** (9.5): it’s the lyrics and the MV that really elevate this song for me!

**plastichaxan** (9): if i had a dollar for every song that i think sounds like a song from one of my childhood tv shows i’d have 2, which isn’t a lot but it’s weird that it happened twice

**throwaway7650** (9): overall really like utada's vocals and the production on this one

**1998tweety** (8.5): nice

**bbfan132** (8.5): i really enjoyed this! their vocals combined with the production… yes.

**akanewasright** (8): I think I know this song best for being the one that simple and clean was a b-side to… and of course simple and clean completely outsold and outstreamed this. This is cute though

**CrimsonROSET** (8): orange

**seanderlust** (8): reading the lyric translation I have no idea what this song is about but I vibe with it

**vayyiqra** (8): Normally I hate songs with lots of sudden tempo changes but this is pretty good.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I had to listen to this song twice because it didn’t register in my brain the first time for wherever reason. It’s not bad but idk why it doesn’t click

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.2): Appropriate title because this song is quite vibrant.

**apatel27** (7): The beat doesn't go hard enough for the vocal performance

**2dina3dworld** (6.8): it’s alright, except for the way they drag out their vowels at the end of some of their sentences. The way they do it just makes it sound a bit flat

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): stream Pocahontas - Colors of the Wind

**sage** (6.5): cute

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): Outsold Flopsey /s

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.4): another one that feels like it wants to go somewhere and doesnt really

**fadedblue09** (6): Beautiful lyrics, but ultimately pales in comparison

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**mengzhongmeng** (6): call me uncultured but all their songs so far has left me... not underwhelmed, just whelmed lol. the songs are all beautifully composed, they're truly a talented writer and singer, but maybe it's just not for me?

**stryxen** (6): a slight bop

**jasannn** (5.5): I like some of the production but the vocals and melody sucks.

**abcd9muses** (5): wasn't so excited about this one, in fact it was one I kind of wanted to fast forward through because it was kind of boring...

**runaway3212** (5): imagine having halsey outselling you

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): kept waiting for this to go somewhere and it never did

**saviorARMY101** (10): I feel like I'm traveling through space.

**seanderlust** (10): this is beautiful. i absolutely love the instrumental - i'm not sure what's making that pinging sound but whatever it is it is gorgeous

**xavieryes** (10): beautiful

**throwaway7650** (9.5): not the best vocals from utada but the sparkly synths contrast the overall dark sound so well, I'm obsessed with the production

**akanewasright** (9): PERFECT album opener, no clue what the hell the video was doing.

**sage** (9): avant garde. never done before.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): the background vocals in the chorus and the post-chorus instrumental, hell ya

**vayyiqra** (9): I really love that looping synth. It adds a lot to the song.

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I can't get over their voice, it's so smooth. That outro is so good too.

**runaway3212** (6.5): Im really sorry but this does nothing for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the instrumental sounds like an acoustic cover of a touhou song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Not really a fan of the breathing (?) in this tbh. But I do like the chorus.

**duochromepalmtree** (5): not my favorite and I don’t like the sound mixing on this one at all.

**fadedblue09** (5): Sonically unique but doesn't do too much for me

**ivyleaf33** (5): video effects is my passion but it's way better than jolin's attempt

**jasannn** (4): At first, I thought Drum Roll Sound Effect [Extended / High Quality] was added to the playlist.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): snoozer

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (11): the lesbian song gets my 11. If you’re unfamiliar with her I would look into her lgbt activism because while BoA has sung at pride event in 2009 and utada is queer, I feel like a lot of pop stars get credit for being allies just for being nice to lgbt fans when Tsai has had explicitly queer music videos advocating for marriage equality and had those songs banned in some countries for it and signed petitions in favor of it. Like she’s not someone who waited for public support to be open about her stance and i really respect her for not being daunted by potential criticism or loss of profits.

**akanewasright** (10): This is perhaps the best ballad in the rate

**apatel27** (10): Beautiful song with a beautiful message

**hookerofpop** (10): she said gay rights!

**Jhe116** (10): The MV tells the story of 張淑月 and 邱秀滿, a lesbian couple for 30 years, based on a true story. Basically 張 passed away due to illness, and when asked about the relationship between them, 邱could only answer “she’s my friend.” And when 邱 could finally said “she’s my partner/wife” out loud, it was all too late. I believe that Taiwan gets to be the first place in Asia to legalize same sex marriage has a lot to do with Jolin

**mengzhongmeng** (10): cinematic masterpiece, crying rn

**Roxieloxie** (10): I think hearing the context and the background for this one really made me appreciate it more so I'll take this comment do to my obligatory ' thank you ghost' comment because truly your information during the listening parties and everything really added to this.

**saviorARMY101** (10): It should be mandatory to play this at all pride parades everywhere.

**throwaway7650** (10): GAY PEOPLE ARE REAL YASS

**fadedblue09** (9.5): By no means an uncommon message, but I love the lyrical nuances ("love isn't just an abstract art of faith"...damn!)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9.5): Her slow songs just hit different!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): she can say it but she wouldn't

**bulforster** (9.2): charlixcxgayrights.gif

**Kwcty6888** (9.1): the video for this was everything

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we’re not so different, you and i. Also, this could be the opening number of a show and i’d be so in the mood

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): I don't know any of the words, but her voice really sells the emotion here, really good vocals

**celladonn** (8.5): Queen of gay rights

**runaway3212** (8.5): So true equality queen

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): The message is an 11

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I KNEW SHE WAS BISEXUAL

**abcd9muses** (8): another lush pop song

**bbfan132** (8): we love an lgbtq+ ally <3

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): this is why taiwan became the first asian country to legalize gay marriage

**stryxen** (8): it took a while to get going but the entire second half goes OFF i am skanking rn

**wavingwolves** (7.8): LESBIAN RIGHTS!

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): gay rights

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): this sounds like such a concert closer song which people emotionally sway along to. also lesbian rights

**ignitethephoenix** (7): look I’m sure what she is saying has a great message but I feel like it also has to be a tad on the nose just based on the title of the song

**nt96** (7): r/popheads music taste in general

**QustoMar** (7): For the most part, Jolin’s ballads get better and better in her discography. This is nice and uplifting, plus I appreciate the dynamic production.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): cute

**vayyiqra** (7): This is dramatic but it's not bad. The bridge is a nice ""ethereal"" moment. Also I had no idea this was a song about LGBT rights so that's based.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): the MV did some hard carrying for the emotional weight of this song

**fkadizzy-1804** (6.5): of the ballads/“message” songs so far this one is definitely the best, and has some quite lovely moments and a few interesting production elements

**2dina3dworld** (6): she’s singing a ballad while the bands playing an upbeat musical piece

**duochromepalmtree** (6): it’s pretty but I was honestly just bored. I’m not into trying to be inspirational music.

**ivyleaf33** (6): the mv makes me bawl my eyes out every single time

**plastichaxan** (6): this is too sad for no reason why'd the video almost make me cry

**seanderlust** (6): so true alexa play same love by macklemore

**jasannn** (5): I know it's fruity but it's still boring.

**Osaka1268** (5): ended homophobia

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): good for her for supporting gay rights but this is kinda boring

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.1): I wish this song were different.

**drejski** (4): They put the dialogue over the song for most of the music video for a reason

**jaztinax** (4): not quite my cup of tea but it is kind of an earworm

**sage** (3): crickets

**runaway3212** (8): Utada has so many song I find boring sorry, however not this one it's good

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): the rapper on this song sounds really hot

**bigbigbee** (10): This is the same song as Disturbance, but both are good. This is the one I knew before the rate - I used to listen to this all the time in college. Honestly this probably isn’t a full 10, but there’s a nostalgia factor for me because of that.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I really wanted to hate this one but I kept coming back to it!!! It sounds like an Ariana grande song in a great way!!! Their voices really play together well.

**sage** (9.5): smasha but not as good as kiss my lips

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): I love the Persona 4 soundtrack

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): KML really was her horny era huh

**ignitethephoenix** (9): as someone who is anti popheads misandry, this song I will be supporting a high position for this during the rate

**BeauMeringue212** (8.6): Wasn't expecting to like the feature so much, but they both sound good in this

**bbfan132** (8.5): this was nice, enjoyed it quite a bit!

**runaway3212** (8.5): This song is just her talking about some rando guy she saw on the train but it outsold so many people in the rate

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): boppity bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait a minute…. Who ARE you

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Remember kids, don't talk to strangers.

**1998tweety** (7.5): its cute

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The rap really dragged this down but I enjoy the chorus a lot

**hookerofpop** (7.5): don’t really like the rapping part but everything else is great

**jasannn** (7.5): This is pretty much the same song as Disturbance.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): i thought this was cheesy and the video just embraces that which i applaud, though we hate to see another case of men ruining what could've been a great song

**QustoMar** (7.5): This is a solid and smooth song, not necessarily something you would single out in BoA’s discography but it’s serviceable. More of the very glossy Pop/RnB sound that dominated SM between BoA here and other artists like EXO around this time.

**seanderlust** (7.5): stan twitter when an NPR writer puts out a tough but fair review of their fave

**throwaway7650** (7.5): see my comment for disturbance... ctfu

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**skargardin** (7): this video was so cute

**vayyiqra** (7): Yet another 90s throwback in this rate and it's not bad

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Kiss My Lips but not as good

**apatel27** (6): K-pop needs to learn to not stick a rap feature on everything. Just back and forth would've been better

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): it’s fine

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.1): I've feel like I've heard the better version of this song in this rate.

**akanewasright** (5): I’m sorry can we talk about this music video where she flies without warning??

**ivyleaf33** (5): bust out laughing when sehun appeared

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): maybe im not one to say this because i think jay park’s verse is the best part of unlock it. but why is there a man on this

**wavingwolves** (4.2): absolutely snooze of a song

**2dina3dworld** (3): I’m sorry but I will never forget the music video with Sehun as the love interest… Sehun is like the least sexy member of EXO. Also the rap sucks.

**abcd9muses** (3): I felt like I knew exactly what I was gonna get from this song... but I loved the chorus

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): This one really reminds me of a Cecy Leos song, so obviously I love it.

**Roxieloxie** (10): i love how sunny this one is

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.6): This is a great bop with great vocals

**BeauMeringue212** (9.3): Really like this low-key r&b sound from her, it shows off her voice so well

**bigbigbee** (9): This is the same song as Who Are You, but both are good.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): really smooth and beautiful

**fadedblue09** (9): Cute R&B bop

**QustoMar** (9): I think this is really nice, it's the type of glossy, pop-R&B that would become a signature sound within SM.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I wish I knew the words. I want to sing along so bad.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): like this a lot

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): this is just like such a pleasant vibe idk

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): i like RnB BoA

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**GARjuna** (8): SM really has a chokehold on me why do I like all these tracks

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the beginning sounds like Pokémon hometown music or animal crossing credits music

**throwaway7650** (8): solid but I feel like I've heard this SM song 20 times before

**vayyiqra** (8): This is what happens when you take chill lo-fi beats and speed them up

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): it's ok, but  I feel like I've probabyl heard this playing in a café at some point

**sage** (7.8): this probably wont do well but its a slay yass coffee shop music

**jasannn** (7.5): very vanilla but a good vanilla

**mengzhongmeng** (7.5): king and queen of kpop, stream IDEA for more Taemin+BoA

**seanderlust** (7.5): i'm not sure I agree with the critiques that this song is too similar to only one. I think its sound is unique enough to be separable.

**2dina3dworld** (7): those opening piano chords are the rhythm to “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You” but too bad it’s not as musically interesting as that.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): not super memorable but good

**bbfan132** (7): nice enough!

**runaway3212** (7): I love this song but it's kinda meh

**plastichaxan** (6.5): i can see how it's similar to Only One (hence my score) but it's also better

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is nice enough but I probably wouldn't ever seek it out.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I’m not joking I listened to this song 5 times in a row trying to come up with something distinctive about it and I got nothing

**abcd9muses** (4): got bored with this one real fast...

**rslashpoopheads** (3): bawring

**Rhea\_33** (11): I'm addicted to this song.

**akanewasright** (10): It makes me happy that while Utada usually works alone/with the same team of producers, they easily can work with the BIGGEST producers out there. The Neptunes, Timbaland, Skrillex, Tricky Stewart, Stargate, and, on this song, Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis. And yeah this song just bops like no one’s business

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): me @ this song

**duochromepalmtree** (10): okay this gives me Jessica Simpson vibes in a very good way!!!! This song is crazy catchy (even though i don’t know most of the words this song is totally stuck in my head)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): the R&B flavour in Utada’s songs is, well, addicting

**sage** (9.3): wait.. im listening

**fkadizzy-1804** (9): this delivers peak early-era Utada drama, complete with ear-candy production and slightly strained, pitchy vocals, and I love every second of it

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): this is great

**nt96** (9): This only asserts my disappointment that we were robbed of getting a 2000s futuristic R&B rate.

**QustoMar** (9): This feels like an obvious successor to Automatic but in a way that does not feel reductive whatsoever, like it truly builds on top of it.

**seanderlust** (8.7): hikki I love you but please pay your phone bill

**bbfan132** (8.5): this production… jimmy jam and terry lewis <3

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): addictive instrumental

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): HEAVEN mix is an appropriate name, cause the track really feels very floaty and light and dreamy (although the underwater mix outsold)

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Their voice is really good on this

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the early 2000’s R&B style here

**throwaway7650** (8): very alluring/captivating production... perhaps addicting?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Their voice is so powerful. I wish I knew the words to this song, it's so good.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): this one's funky too

**runaway3212** (7.5): avicci outsold

**abcd9muses** (7): another stellar track, Utada Hikaru is an ICON OKAY

**apatel27** (7): A bit too long

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this kinda sounds like a TLC track or am I hearing things

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I think a minute could have been cut off this tbh but that groove is good.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): very early 2000s (neutral)

**fadedblue09** (6): So much emotion in their voice but ultimately feels boring and too long

**SmileAndTears** (6): It's okay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is about a minute and a half too long

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah. My pet peeve is pop songs that throw around addiction and drug metaphors like they're going out of style. This is okay though.

**2dina3dworld** (5): kinda boring

**drejski** (5): Kind of all over the place melodically

**jaztinax** (5): the production exceeds the vocals + melody imo

**ivyleaf33** (4): this is at least a whole minute too long

**1998tweety** (10): omg this sounds so good inject it into me

**CrimsonROSET** (10): saxophone emoji

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): BoA goes Back to Basics

**hookerofpop** (10): a versatile queen

**moooo566** (10): i wish i had a second 11

**Roxieloxie** (10): another fun one!!! The video for this, i want to be in the club but also the song its self just bops

**xavieryes** (10): TIL jazz was invented in South Korea

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (9.7): This makes me want to dance

**nt96** (9.5): The closest thing to jazz that the basic gays will listen to since Gaga couldn't convince y'all to stream Cheek to Cheek.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): kinda her bboom bboom

**akanewasright** (9): the way she’s stretching the vowel makes me hear that she’s singing about “the jizz club”

**celladonn** (9): Queen of electro swing

**fadedblue09** (9): Expected a more chill song but this will do. Her vocals really elevate this

**racloves** (9): has anyone else put in the bee movie ‘ya like jazz?’

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): bold move to name your song jazzclub when it doesnt even remotely resemble a jazz song

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): ok gatsby soundtrack vibes!

**GARjuna** (8.5): electro swing!!

**jaztinax** (8.5): okay scat queen go off

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): this makes *interesting* choices and i love them

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Would definitely dance in a club to this. I keep saying it, but the production is so good.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): this is interesting but pretty good too

**bbfan132** (8): queen of scatting

**runaway3212** (8): ahead of its time

**skargardin** (8): Oh this is a really fun one!

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): this song’s pacing reminds me of being overly caffeinated but in a fun way

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): I totally appreciate going for the cool play on jazz but it doesn’t totally work for me. Sounds a little Madagascar movie mixed with Madonna ish.

**ivyleaf33** (7.5): that one percussion that sounds like somebody rummaging through a trashcan

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.3): pretty fun

**2dina3dworld** (7): I wish she’d committed to the bit and made this a straight up jazz style song like Something. And I never want to hear BoA do scatting again

**RandomHypnotica** (7): this is kinda a mess, it gets so repetitive so quickly, it sounds like a worse version of we no speak americano

**abcd9muses** (6.5): I do like the vaudeville type sound but I'm not obsessed with it. it's the perfect length though for this type of song.

**QustoMar** (6.5): One thing very apparent in BoA's later discography is she loves herself some jazz, which you can see here. I think this song is alright, but it's not necessarily something I would put on by itself which you need for a single.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I love you boa but this ain't serving ella

**SmileAndTears** (6): I dont like it much, but its definitely interesting

**vayyiqra** (6): This title is confusing because this is not even close to jazz (if anything it's more like klezmer music) but anyway it's kind of catchy. (Oh wait you said electro-swing? Okay I can kind of see it idk.)

**frogaranaman** (5): so true

**throwaway7650** (5): not awful but starts sounding like a momoland song after a while

**apatel27** (4): For a jazzy pop track this sucks hard

**jasannn** (4): Just stream My Copycat by Orange Caramel instead.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3.2): This is some not great jazz.

**sage** (3): i hate brass a lot of the time and well.... it sounds so bad here literally ruins the entire song... the prechorus is so good tho

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): chorus gets a bit annoying after a while tbh but bridge saves this..nvm this chorus is giving me a headache

**plastichaxan** (1): somehow the jazz elements are what make the song bad i get what she was going for but i just disliked it as it went on

**TragicKingdom1** (0): that horn is just really annoying sorry

**wavingwolves** (0): undefendable

**vayyiqra** (11): A total banger and the peak of the cheesy dance-pop in this rate. It came out in 2000 yet sounds like a 1990 track by Madonna, only sung in Mandarin. I love this lmao. It's ridiculous and amazing.

**akanewasright** (10): Yeah this is actually a really fantastic slice of dance pop

**frogaranaman** (10): so true

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): I really like this one

**Roxieloxie** (10): absolute bop

**TiltControls** (10): oh this is also a bop!!! Probably my 11 on the Jolin side

**xavieryes** (10): showing my love for it here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.2): Disco is back baby (in 2000)!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the videos in this rate ARE required viewing

**nt96** (9): Feels like I'm being transported inside a Sega Dreamcast world and I'm living for it.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): this kinda reminds me of informercial music, but like, one that would play in a fever dream

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): ooh a cute little banger!

**bbfan132** (8): bopping to this, it’s fun as hell

**GARjuna** (8): this instrumentation kinda foreshadows some of the choices she makes later

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is boppy

**jasannn** (8): Vogue

**jaztinax** (7.9): madonna vibes???

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): this sounds like kylie minogue

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Key change won me over

**fkadizzy-1804** (7.5): catchy af although I’m not sold on the kind of bored almost speak-singing vocal style she’s got going on here

**mengzhongmeng** (7.5): The bridge really pushed the score up from a solid 6

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): this is very early 00s (positive)

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Lowkey wouldn't sound out of place on What's Your Pleasure?

**throwaway7650** (7.5): I love disco

**plastichaxan** (7.3): the explosion at the beginning of the MV is cause she detonated a yass grenade

**abcd9muses** (7): this is so fun, strong 90s vibes

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this song makes me feel like I’m in a movie theatre in 2002 staying through the end credits of the film so I can stay in the bubble of the movie theatre for a little longer

**lagozzino** (7): My first thought was "Wow I didn't realize Jolin has been putting out music since the early 90s!" and then I found out that this is from 2000. I guess it took an extra decade for this sound to reach the sinosphere

**runaway3212** (7): For a lot of her ealier stuff I like what im hearing but it feels kinda basic compared to her later stuff

**bulforster** (6.8): bridge + key change saves it

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): score would be higher if it didn’t drag on so much by the end i fear

**sage** (6.5): cute bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): tbh i never remember this one after its done but i can pleasantly nod along

**seanderlust** (5): this is fine, though i don't like the cricket chirping noise on the pre-chorus

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (5): This is... interesting.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): I should watch the series this is from, because it’s so moving. Utada did it again, and they just keep getting better.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I like the backing vocals and beat hear, very shifting and keeps me engaged. Nice!

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): My lack of Japanese knowledge means that to me, this is just an AMAZING cult song. Anything that opens by chanting "blood" is a ten out of ten song, no questions asked.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i was gonna rate this lower but something just clicked when i was going thru the list again this is so fucking good

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is so different and spacious but I adore it! It almost reminds me of the Mirror's Edge soundtrack, in a really clean, futuristic way.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): why are you reminding me i am a danganronpa fan i did not need to be attacked tonight

**saviorARMY101** (9): Their vocals really shine here

**vayyiqra** (9): Maybe the weirdest concept of any song in this rate but I'm for it. It's also a neat song in its own right. Listen to the bass and drums and how they interact with the keyboard.

**bbfan132** (8.5): really pleasant song!

**QustoMar** (8.5): The first time I heard this, I was underwhelmed, but it's kinda been a grower.

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): vampire anthem

**moooo566** (8): this is such a chill vibe i keep tuning out, ive had to listen like 6 times to actually feel able to rate it

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The beat feels off. Not familiar with this anime though so might check this out

**akanewasright** (7.3): This song is a bit of a shrug for me, but it’s nice and the video is WONDERFUL (well it’s clamor shots but I like those, they look nice)

**abcd9muses** (7): here we see Utada bringing in their classic sounds with this new decade, and I think this is a very good attempt at that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Pink blood.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): raised the score because of the last minute yass

**TiltControls** (7): omg Utada doing Danganronpa soundtracks now??

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): This is really chill, very vibey. Tbh I was expecting something darker. Not my fav from them, but I like it.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.6): this is just too robotic for me at points

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): eh

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**sage** (6): its cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): danganronpa characters be like

**throwaway7650** (6): was kind of let down by this after one 1ast k1ss but oh well

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): the opening always makes me think of He Loves You Not for some reason so its double iconic for that reason

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): this lowkey sounds like something from the Splatoon OST

**Kwcty6888** (9.6): the most iconic hair dryer

**sage** (9.5): the best out of her older titles

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this is so 2000s (non-derogatory)

**CrimsonROSET** (9): boo’d up

**hookerofpop** (9): iconic bop

**plastichaxan** (9): i’m listening

**Roxieloxie** (9): the chorus bopssss

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I'm listening

**bbfan132** (8): fun song, i like the chorus!

**vayyiqra** (8): The vocals go off but also note that synth bass (at least I think that's what it is, or fretless bass with some kind of effect) is awesome.

**bulforster** (7.8): love the darting chorus phrases

**akanewasright** (7.7): I would have EATEN this up if I was into kpop in middle school

**abcd9muses** (7.5): groovy, BoA knows how to do rnb pop!!

**duochromepalmtree** (7): I did bop

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**GARjuna** (7): this has anime op energy

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): cute but nothing outstanding [2]

**rslashpoopheads** (7): feelin a lil funkay

**runaway3212** (7): We love a fun bop

**seanderlust** (7): D.H.T.'s Listen To Your Heart remains unbothered, but this is nice

**throwaway7650** (7): yeah early BoA isn't really for me I fear. still a legend!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): If she's were to rerecord this and update the production it would be sooo good!

**apatel27** (6): Repetitive

**bigbigbee** (6): Not a fan of the vocal performance here. Every line of the chorus sounds like a struggle for her to get out, almost like she’s out of breath. It’s okay otherwise.

**ivyleaf33** (6): me whenever i blow dry my hair except she's actually a popstar

**jaztinax** (6): not a fan of the transition to the chorus but other than that it’s cute

**QustoMar** (5): This sounds like a very very watered down version of He Loves You Not by Dream.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): The hook is loud but not necessarily great.

**fadedblue09** (3): honestly she serves vocally I just find the production unbearable

**BeauMeringue212** (10): This fucking slaps omg. Sounds like a UK Summer No. 1 if that makes sense haha.

**runaway3212** (10): R3HAB did what he had to do

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh we love a club queen

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**throwaway7650** (9): queen of choreo, your faves could never etc.

**duochromepalmtree** (8.7): so so so good. And it just came out!??? I’m obsessed. Please God let me dance in a club to this song ASAP.

**seanderlust** (8.7): the "da da da" hook is an earworm

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I expect an EDM collab like this to be drained of soul, but thankfully it isn't

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is generic but I am bopping

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): il generic but pleasant enough to overcome that

**jasannn** (8): the 2nd drop pops off

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): pretty good

**Roxieloxie** (8): you know choices were in fact made!

**vayyiqra** (8): R3HAB must never sleep because that dude is everywhere, but I can't say I dislike his work.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): “go through fire and water”, just swim it can’t be that hard to go through water, especially in comparison to fire

**akanewasright** (7.5): this is generic and feels cheap but it bops?

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.5): i feel like everyone likes EDM way more then me? It’s not a genre I hate but also I find it very uninspired.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): is she sampling another song in the chorus. it sounds so familar when she goes da da da da but i cant place my finger on it.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Her voice in English sounds so beautiful. But I swear I've heard this same beat drop before.

**abcd9muses** (7): I realized this is actually such a pleasant bop! it's not pushing the boundaries of pop but it's still great

**bbfan132** (7): it’s nice enough

**drejski** (7): It doesn't sound very distinctive or original but it's alright

**ivyleaf33** (7): the camerawork in the drop is...a choice

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.7): I like the da-da-da's. It's an alright EDM song.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): generic but a bop

**apatel27** (6): EDM drops in 2021 aren't nice

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): chungha's song was better

**RandomHypnotica** (6): this is just generic, I have nothing else to say

**rslashpoopheads** (6): very edm

**skargardin** (6): well, it does bop somewhat

**SmileAndTears** (5.5): She sounds different here and the song is a little generic ngl

**sarcasticsobs** (5): i’m good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.2): Just feels kind of generic unfortunately.

**sage** (4): its fun but i dont like it

**wavingwolves** (4): i'm not a big fan of dj + pop girl music but i have to admit this isn't horrible at least

**plastichaxan** (11): even after seeing her evolution, which is great, i just kept coming back to this moment, and the earlier stuff in general but just this especifically, i think it just captures what was coming for her and has big star energy in the late 90s which i just adore seeing

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): levels of iconic that were rarely reached again in kpop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This walked so Cyber Stockholm Syndrome could fly across the galaxy

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): this is just fantastic late 90's/early 00's r&b pop with that insanely overboard overfilled production where they just throw all the sounds at the wall and see what sticks, I love it so much

**seanderlust** (9.5): that chorus took me OUT. this is that perfect 90s drama track

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): BoA's off to a good start

**bbfan132** (9): a total bop, i’m happy i discovered this!!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it’s giving me spy, it’s giving me montage, it’s giving me shenanigans going down but make it quirky

**mengzhongmeng** (9): baby BoA already has IT

**nt96** (9): An interesting blend of disco strings and beats that sounds straight out of an Aaliyah song, topped with some campy opera. BoA ain't pulling no punches.

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): sounds like all of the pop music I grew up with in the early 00s so so good

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): looove those synth strings and the general intensity

**bookthieving** (8): she was 13 here!! that's insane!!!!!

**GARjuna** (8): super interesting how well this ties into the 'classic SM sound' !!

**hookerofpop** (8): invented hyperpop

**Kwcty6888** (8): honestly still slaps 21 years later

**Roxieloxie** (8): this feels like it would be a Britney song, which makes sense with the era

**sage** (8): a great debut actually

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): in the nicest way possible this sounds like it was made using one of those default keyboard soundboards

**BeauMeringue212** (7.8): Nice intro to her, I love how full her voice is

**sarcasticsobs** (7.6): *screams* 2000’s my god

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): what even is a Peace B ID

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Only true Queens put semicolons in their song titles.

**bulforster** (7.5): punchy production but her voice sounds too young for what she's trying to deliver (which is obviously understandable since she's like 13 here)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): I like her singing. It's a catchy R&B inspired song.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): this sounds so 90s lol

**akanewasright** (7.4): I feel like I like this song in theory more than in practice… with that being said this will probably grow on me

**abcd9muses** (7): love this blend of rock inspired rnb, amazing for a debut album!

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**ivyleaf33** (7): damn, k-pop's come a long way in the mv department

**jasannn** (7): Im surprised how mature her voice sounds even as 13 y/o.

**Jhe116** (7): Song has the potential to be great but this 2000s mixing is so…

**stryxen** (7): this song is so squelchy

**throwaway7650** (7): BoA deserves massive respect for debuting with this song + album at age 13. ***13***! unfortunately this song doesn't do much for me

**vayyiqra** (7): This whole instrumental is so early 90s. I'm for it. Anyway, I guess I can add BoA to my list of artists who have named things after their screennames, which includes Charli XCX, Grimes and Hana among others I can't remember. New playlist idea. :thinking:

**fkadizzy-1804** (6.5): a cinematic banger and that quack-y synth motif just adds a certain charm. But it’s also… kind of dull?

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): cute but nothing outstanding

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): I wasn't expecting her voice to be that low. Or powerful! She's a Vocalist!

**SmileAndTears** (6): She was 13 👁👄👁?? Tbf she does *sound* like a 13 yo I guess

**runaway3212** (5): This isnt bad but you can tell she's super young here

**skargardin** (5): there's a lot going on and i'm not sure I like much of it

**TragicKingdom1** (5): much less charming than the other songs in the rate with this Y2K sound imo

**fadedblue09** (4): those alien noises are obnoxious

**QustoMar** (4): This whole song kinda sounds like a verse if that makes sense. Like the production and vibe was dying to have some sort of major serve moment, and it never happened.

**drejski** (3): Nothing special

**rslashpoopheads** (2): this ain't it

**throwaway7650** (11): the intro guitar, the chorus, the post-chorus... what a classic omg. hearing this during a beatsense listening party unlocked so many memories for me; I stanned this song HARD as a kid when people covered it on singing shows. over time I forgot the name of this song (and the artist who sang it) but it would pop into my head every once in a while... ofc it would be this legend honestly. I'm happy to give this my 11 and to come out of the rate having rediscovered such a defining song of my childhood!

**duochromepalmtree** (10): obsessed with this song doesn’t even begin to cover it. Before I looked up the lyrics I didn’t know what she was saying but also I totally did. It just completely translated through the music for me. Love this song so much can’t stop listening to it. Was very VERY close to getting my 11.

**hookerofpop** (10): pop perfection

**jasannn** (10): Idk how this song got stuck in my head on multiple occasions.

**saviorARMY101** (10): classic

**Kwcty6888** (9.5): my first cpop love, this song will always hold a place in my heart

**pleasegivemeasword** (9.5): something’s so nostalgic about this

**SmileAndTears** (9): can we talk about that GUITAR THOUGH?

**1998tweety** (8): boppy

**abcd9muses** (8): took me on a sonic journey, really interesting melodic progressions

**bbfan132** (8): nice single! i would listen to this again, it has a specific early 00s sound

**bigbigbee** (8): Reminds me of youth, both my own and in general. I like it.

**drejski** (8): Actually quite catchy

**TiltControls** (8): it's cute

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): love the guitar in this

**runaway3212** (7.5): This has a slight case of the boperitus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is a cute little song :)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.4): This is catchy and super fun

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**seanderlust** (7): why is the album cover giving me overpriced meditation app?

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): that chorus kinda just… never kicked in huh

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): eh, it's alright but not really my thing

**GARjuna** (6): this whole album is rly good but this song is kinda boring. Definitely recommend listening to welcome to the j game or watching the iconic freestyle to it on sdoc3 if it isn't blocked in ur country

**ivyleaf33** (6): sketchy rooftops = taiwancore tbh

**mengzhongmeng** (6): Happy to see that Street Woman Fighter (2003) got a Korean reboot in 2021.

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): it was boring until that instrumental break

**plastichaxan** (6): me: "oh this is getting interesting"... the song: 03:12/03:46

**vayyiqra** (6): A very 90s song given the time it came out.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (5.5): Umm... it's catchy.

**apatel27** (5): This version is low energy

**fadedblue09** (5): I probably heard this one before [2]

**CrimsonROSET** (4): Sorry, there is just- so many ideas going on here, and most of them don’t work. This song had lost me from the start.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): forgot what this song sounded like as soon as it ended

**rslashpoopheads** (4): this is very early 00s (derogatory)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3.8): Not really a strong hook and some bad quasi-rapping.

**sage** (3.5): this is like painfully boring but its not bad

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh this is just gorgeous, i love the instrumentals

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Oh my goodness this is so beautiful. Wait why am I gonna cry?

**xavieryes** (10): a top-notch ballad

**bigbigbee** (9.5): OH YEAH THAT’S MORE LIKE IT! THAT’S THE KIND OF SAD GUITAR BALLAD I LIKE! I scream inappropriately at Jolin’s concert, ruining the DVD footage

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): I-

**SmileAndTears** (9): I'm a simple man. I hear a ballad, I give a high score

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is pretty but unfortunately I do prefer bops

**vayyiqra** (7): This makes me think of one of Faye Wong's ballads from the 90s (can't remember which one). It's pretty.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): Lyrically interesting but musically it does nothing for me

**2dina3dworld** (6): my personal balladphobia in play

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): best for last for BoA & a strong finish for the rate!

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): wait i love this

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Very summery vibes. Shame the rap verse sabotaged this

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): it's summery, it's cute, it's a vibe, it feels like driving down the coast of Nice in a convertible

**CrimsonROSET** (9): we love a song popheads will tank because of a male feature

**TiltControls** (9): here's my feedback - this song is a bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): big summer bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): i like the bassline, this is fun

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8.5): I find her voice a little high for my taste but I love her style and Charisma so much and I loved the blue outfits here. Also this comeback always makes me laugh because I remember the blog Asian Junkie pretending as a joke that she was a newcomer to get more people in his readers interested in her and just him complaining about her scattered media presence around that time.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): bop

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): the chorus bass, YES. the rap, NO

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): good song. if Reddit eats my submission again I am going to go ballistic

**duochromepalmtree** (8): had to knock points for the rap. None of these artists need these pointless features

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I think this is probably my favorite rap feature in the rate

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): a bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): cute but Janet definitely outsold

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): The song got better towards the end. Ngl I wasn't that impressed with the feature. I liked it, but not a lot.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.4): I like the 80's influence but I can't help feel like they could've made this better somehow

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.4): tbh i always read the feature as nutsack

**akanewasright** (7.3): This video is so “everything is 50% off at old navy” that I can’t quite shake that association….

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**plastichaxan** (7): this is cute but i just keep comparing the you-hoo-hoo to mee-hee-hee and i may just have ruined the song for myself

**throwaway7650** (7): the production is quite nice but nucksal's part lasts too long

**vayyiqra** (7): I like the funk guitar but this rap verse can go, unlike some of the other rap features in this rate. Otherwise a pretty good song. I love the chorus.

**ivyleaf33** (6.7): the nude fabric on her shirt is a choice

**drejski** (6): I can see why I forgot this song existed

**hookerofpop** (6): a bit noisy and vocals are weirdly mixed imo…

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): featuring nutsack?

**sage** (5.5): its cute but the rap is so bad pleek

**apatel27** (5): Rap Feature ruins it. Sounds like a generic UK summer anthem

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): this is mid and i have no thoughts

**abcd9muses** (4.5): I felt like too much was going on to really get into the song. And then the rap part brought it down.

**Kwcty6888** (4.5): the high notes at the end saved this from a worse score

**jasannn** (4): What in the Target Ad?

**runaway3212** (3): When I said Shine we are was the only boa meh song I forgot about this

**2dina3dworld** (0): I know she’s been at it for way longer… but this sounds like a bad Chungha impression

**fadedblue09** (10): Look I just love late 2000s Stargate R&B production, okay???

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): I love the intro and their voice in this.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): who remembers when Ne-Yo was popular and every sad song sounded like this

**Kwcty6888** (9.4): kind of safe but an earworm nonetheless

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): the first all-english song in this rate is pretty good

**CrimsonROSET** (9): you don’t need them! honestly!

**GARjuna** (9): LOVE the piano

**Roxieloxie** (9): vannesa hudgens:

**SmileAndTears** (9): not to be horny on main but I need to know this man's name. Massive bop too!

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): I have had this song completely stuck in my head since the moment I heard it!! That chorus is just so catchy!

**nt96** (8.5): Utada telling us to give them a second rate win.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): These lyrics! Pain. Pure pain. Ugh that bridge is so good! 😭

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): this sounds like a song Leona Lewis would turn down

**akanewasright** (8.3): I assume Easy Breezy is out by the time this goes out… so lemme say that I don’t have the same ringing endorsement of Utada’s second English album as I do their first. If you like this song, check it out, but if you don’t… this is pretty much the album lol. I still like the album, and I like a few songs on it more than this one (Me Muero and FYI especially), but if you don’t like this at all, you do not need to check the full thing out

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (8): Inexcusable behavior but a really good song

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I love this album so much. I was robbed of Utada being a US pop icon and honestly we deserve them giving up their US citizenship lol

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): vocals were served

**throwaway7650** (8): sweet song, really like the opening piano sequence

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why do I want to dock points for this atrocious album cover, the song is decent though

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**runaway3212** (7.5): this is a whole bop

**seanderlust** (7.2): it's...fine? but i know from the rest of the playlist, which is full of BANGERS and much more heartfelt ballads, that utada can do better than this

**apatel27** (7): Classic 00s RnB song

**bbfan132** (7): definitely of its time but it’s nice!

**stryxen** (7): oh they’re TOXIC toxic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): put me in the mariah carey section

**plastichaxan** (6.5): i can see where this is coming from but it's not really for me

**abcd9muses** (6): would have given this generic song a lower score, but Utada's voice and melodies are what make this standard 2000s love song unique

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This sounds pretty good but whoever this song is addressed to needs to stay away lol.  If they cheat once...

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): If I were the ex Utada is trying to get back, this song would not pop off enough to excuse the cheating. I can forgive a lot of things but I draw the line at making boring music!

**vayyiqra** (6): Not expecting a ballad in English in this rate but it's alright. I can hear the Mariah influence here. It's nothing special though.

**QustoMar** (5.5): If there is one thing to say about this track, it's that the lyrics are DIRECT.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): The production hear sounds so cheap. And photoshop our bad memories? Delete this layer tho

**ivyleaf33** (5): actually yea i would in fact get back together with hikki if they cheated on me

**sage** (4.5): this is literally just a mariah carey song but in a bad way.. this lacks like all the creativity the utada songs before this had

**wavingwolves** (4.5): i can't explain but i feel like the cover of this album is selling you exactly what the music sounds like

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): their only miss so far actually but even then it’s not that bad

**fkadizzy-1804** (3): truly one of the most meh, generic songs Utada has ever made. At least the missteps on Exodus were interesting

**Osaka1268** (3): stream exodus 04

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): i lied about nothing in this rate deserving a zero. this sounds like something mariah would've scrapped from anklemonitor and their voice sounds so damaged for some reason here (not in an emotional way but like physically). it's just boring and plodding and so LONG on top of that. love me a long song when it actually goes somewhere but this meanders with no purpose

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (11): I don’t care how bad this went in the other rate, I love it.

**nt96** (11): If this song wins, this will be THE year for both Utada and KH stans, since it would be the second time they won and I would be grateful for witnessing both events. Also, did anyone notice that the piano chords sound identical to And Dream of Sheep by Kate Bush?

**2dina3dworld** (10): the drop instantly makes this a ten, it’s the thing that’s stuck with me the most after hearing this in video game vocal rate. Also I originally gave this an eight! But look! A ten!

**frogaranaman** (10): so true

**GARjuna** (10): this is my kind of song

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this is shit. i love it

**seanderlust** (10): the smasha!!! i honestly love this collab between the two of them. also, please check out don't think twice which was used in KH3 promo and is a super pretty mid-tempo ballad.

**throwaway7650** (10): this was original a 7.5 until I watched a choreo by astro (crazy sexy cool) rocky where he used this as the bg music - sometimes a visual does wonders https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GAksgvR8nM

**TiltControls** (10): motherfucking sora in smash

**xavieryes** (10): wasn't expecting to see a Skrillex collab in this rate. it's just as perfect as i'd expect it to be.

**fkadizzy-1804** (9.5): idc I love the production on this song

**Osaka1268** (9): cant wait for kingdom hearts 4 in 2087!

**rslashpoopheads** (9): main edm girl

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): overhated asf, scored it a bit lower than in VGV though

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): I feel like they were so close to making this INCREDIBLE but it just fell a little short. Sounds very dated I was surprised this was from 2019 (I would’ve guessed 2013/2014)

**Kwcty6888** (8.5): this really grew on me since I first heard it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): this is the second highest score i gave utada in this rate. what does that say about my taste in music (it means its bad)

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**abcd9muses** (8): I'm surprised I really like this song because I think I've personally strayed away from that hard EDM sound but ugh the way Utada and Skrillex combine their strengths is just amazing

**akanewasright** (8): okay yeah this song isn’t their best but it’s still fun

**bbfan132** (8): it’s definitely cheesy but i still enjoyed it quite a bit lol

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): I love their ballads and their ballads only.

**fadedblue09** (8): Kinda grown on me after realizing their sonic imprint on this song. Never has dubstep sounded so angelic

**skargardin** (8): By far the weakest of the kingdom hearts themes but it still works surprisingly well I'd say

**vayyiqra** (8): I guess someone has to defend this song from dubstep haters even though yeah that drop is a choice. Otherwise it's pretty great though.

**celladonn** (7.5): The verses are so much better than the chorus here

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Ok the production didn't have to go that hard!

**Jhe116** (7.3): Listening to a Skrillex beat drop feels anachronistic. At least the verses are good though

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): you cannot escape the vgv rate. the vgv rate is eternal. stream simple and clean.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): not sure if Skrillex is the right fit for their voice…

**Roxieloxie** (7): okay but if we were gonna bring back a vgv song sanctuary was right there!!!

**ivyleaf33** (6.8): somehow had no idea this was a collab with skrillex

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Lmao weird but I kinda like it. Skrillex kind of carried I fear.

**plastichaxan** (6): oh that drop is controversial alright, this is way lower than i rated it in vgv sdkfjljkdsf

**apatel27** (5): This better not rank high due to the KH connection

**RandomHypnotica** (5): The song conflicts me so much. The verses and pre-chorus are geninely great, Utada's voice, vocals and lyrics are amazing as always, and skrillex's production there works well, but that drop is SO. FUCKING. UGLY!!! It sounds like every youtuber intro circa 2013, and it actively takes me out of the song, and it makes me SO ANGRY BECAUSE  I ENJOY THE OTHER PARTS!!! But it makes the whole thing unlistenable!!

**sage** (5): the drop was a jumpscare but actually this isnt bad

**saviorARMY101** (5): For sure my least favorite song they’ve done for Kingdom Hearts, Sanctuary/Passion and Simple & Clean remain superior.

**BeauMeringue212** (4): I'm sorry but I just hate the dubstep drop

**cloudbustingmp3** (3): im sorry but the drop makes me laugh it is not good

**CrimsonROSET** (3): Now, as you certainly remember, this was my 0 in Videogame Vocals. To quote myself, ‘this sounds like half minecraft youtubers intro, half song that got passed down like fourteen times before being sung by julia michaels on a movie soundtrack’ which perhaps was a bit harsh. It’s the truth, but harsh. I just think it’s absolutely insane the decrease in quality from Simple and Clean to this, but- was all the hatred warrented? … yes lmao

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): this drop.

**stryxen** (2.5): it's just too much im sorry it does not work its not horrific tho

**drejski** (2): What an atrocious drop

**wavingwolves** (1): this is the absolutely worst of what the classic dj + pop artist can offer tbh

**runaway3212** (0): I hate this so much more than I did when I heard it for VGV

**akanewasright** (10): Yeah this is kinda one of the best here. I went to go raise the score of this after seeing the video and realized it was already a 10 jdhdjrj

**throwaway7650** (10): free britney

**duochromepalmtree** (9): seeing this song live must be so incredible!!! This one went right on my hot mom walk playlist it’s so fun

**bbfan132** (8.5): brought me back to the early 2000s, super fun

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this just kept getting better my score kept going up as the song went on which is very yass

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): a cute smiley bop (I hope it's happy it feels happy idk maybe it's about war or something I didn't look up the lyrics)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): SHINee your turn

**seanderlust** (8): a ray of sunshine.

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The last minute elevated this

**stryxen** (7.5): yass !

**sarcasticsobs** (7.4): cute WAIT WHOA at 2:37 in wtf that was so good bring that back

**hookerofpop** (7): not really feeling this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this song also sounds like an s club 7 song. this one is not a cover as far as i know however

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I don't know why but this kinda reminds me of Love on Top.

**vayyiqra** (7): !

**bulforster** (6.6): cute but overstays its welcome

**2dina3dworld** (6): you could tell me this was an S Club 7 cover and I’d believe it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): the bridge elevates the song to a positive score but other than that it's pretty eh

**BeauMeringue212** (6): I like parts of it but there's just too much going on in the song for me

**frogaranaman** (6): so true

**duochromepalmtree** (10): wow this song feels like I’m experiencing an entire film. What a way to start off this rate!

**saviorARMY101** (10): Wow her vocals really shine in this, really impressive for a debut song.

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (9.9): I did not like the vocals combined with the beat at the start, but I loved the rest

**jasannn** (9.5): This songs makes me want to do community service

**plastichaxan** (9): that was so powerful

**throwaway7650** (9): ignoring the fact that this score might be carried by nostalgia that doesn't even exist... the BPM is a tad low for me but bop!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): cute! love the guitar solo

**sarcasticsobs** (8.2): when will balladphobia end?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ths is just… so soothing and nice. It’s like a warm bed.

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**GARjuna** (8): this was nice!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): the beat and whole vibe of the song, including the guitar solo, reminds me of Selena Quintanilla song, love that

**bbfan132** (7.5): cute ballad! kind of cheesy with the guitars in a fun way

**seanderlust** (7.5): it's pretty good but without the guitar this would be very "on hold with the pharmacy" music

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.3): she sounds so good and this is her debut??

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**apatel27** (7): neat little ballad

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): nice guitar solo

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the little guitar solo is sick I wish this song would be more, I feel like it’s holding back a bit

**jaztinax** (7): reminds me of the kind of mid-tempo ballads i grew up with. cute!

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): okay this electric guitar moment

**rslashpoopheads** (7): we vibing

**akanewasright** (6.5): I feel like if I was there at the time I would have LOVED this, but I kinda think this is only okay

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.5): kinda charming but not outstaning

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): lowkey this sounds like a charity single an artist would release to help spread awareness for keeping the earth clean or something like that

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): This sound like it would be in a disney movie. Seriously it's kinda giving Hercules vibes. It's not a bad thing though.

**wavingwolves** (6.3): it's giving charity single

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): i feel like I've heard variations of this type of soppy ballad 100 times over, the guitar kicking in halfway through is a nice touch though. The MV is super camp.

**abcd9muses** (6): I felt like this started off very strong but then it dragged a bit. It also felt like a Disney original soundtrack...

**bigbigbee** (6): I can’t score a bog-standard Chinese ballad too low, tbh. This sound is inextricably linked with my childhood memories

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Pretty but a little too Disney for me.

**fadedblue09** (6): Honestly it's so typically 90s but still very pleasant to hear

**runaway3212** (6): This is good but also it's very much taylor's debut in terms of quality compared to everything else (also sorry ghost for already mentioning taylor swift so quickly I'll try to hold it in the rest of the rate)

**TiltControls** (6): quality visual effects

**vayyiqra** (6): So cheesy but kind of cute.

**sage** (5.5): its cute but thats about it

**BeauMeringue212** (5): Her voice sounds really good but the song feels dated for me

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (4): the guitar is nice and so is her voice, I’m just bored

**Kwcty6888** (4): honestly pretty standard, bland early 2000s cpop

**QustoMar** (4): This is a very regular ballad, it doesn't do anything for me.

**drejski** (3): The only memorable part for me was the guitar solo

**fkadizzy-1804** (3): bonus point for the guitar solo but this is just too sappy and corny for me

**ivyleaf33** (3): video effects are my passion...

**Osaka1268** (3): giving me magic sing karaoke tease

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is better than the original

**moooo566** (10): i pretty much immediately lost my mind when i realised what this was. when are we rating s club?

**seanderlust** (10): s club 7 reunion tour when

**TiltControls** (10): I WAS GOING TO MAKE AN S CLUB 7 JOKE BUT I WASNT EXPECTING IT TO BE AN ACTUAL COVER. Anyways this song is and forever will be a 10 no matter who covers it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.4): Do Bop!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): the absolute THRILL I'm getting from this S Club 7 cover

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): idk who s club 7 is so like this is cute in bubblegummy enough

**duochromepalmtree** (8): love this so much. I’ve heard the s club 7 version but this is actually better

**fadedblue09** (8): If Kpop has Gee, then Cpop has this. Thank you popheads for unearthing this childhood bop! Apparently this was a cover but this is the version I’m used to.

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**racloves** (8): a bop, cause I grew up with S Club

**runaway3212** (8): A super fun bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): Jolin outsold S Club 7 by quite a bit

**throwaway7650** (8): this score is purely carried by nostalgia I'm well-aware :soobcry:

**akanewasright** (7.8): I can’t believe this is real…….. she really covered an s club song

**jasannn** (7.5): Super cheesy but i love it.

**stryxen** (7.4): this stopped so suddenly why would she lie

**BeauMeringue212** (7.2): Very fun cover and the song sounds surprisingly good in Mandarin (assuming that's the language she sings in, feel free to correct me)

**1998tweety** (7): this song sounded like it was going in one direction and then went in the complete opposite direction

**celladonn** (7): Legends covering legends... a point for every member of S Club

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): a little disney channel and the sudden ending takes me out but its still cute!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): there are so many artists i wasn’t expecting to hear this rate. S CLUB FUCKING SEVEN WAS VERY HIGH ON THAT LIST.

**fkadizzy-1804** (7): fun and cute with some great production flourishes but not really a standout

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (7): I thought the start was an advertisement

**Osaka1268** (7): sounds like an older precure ending song so i cant find it in my heart to hate this lol

**plastichaxan** (7): this sounds like a lazy town song but i cant really tell which one

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): that guy was right it’s a jam!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I swear I've heard this before.

**vayyiqra** (7): Well this sure unlocked some memories.

**bbfan132** (6.5): hmm… it’s fun but it definitely feels like a cover lol

**Jhe116** (6.5): The fact that she used to be an English major still feels so foreign to me

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): this is a bit too Disney sounding for me unfortunately

**apatel27** (6): Forgot this is an S Club 7 cover lol

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (6): this is a very 2000s song and it reminds me of a musical

**jaztinax** (6): a cute little y2k bop but sounds like it caters more to 10 year olds

**sarcasticsobs** (6): everything about the intro threw me for a loop. sounds very “of its time”

**saviorARMY101** (6): It's cute

**SmileAndTears** (6): The kidz boppery of it all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i was gonna make a joke about how this sounded like an s club 7 song before i realized that it literally is an s club 7 cover

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): its giving barney & friends

**ivyleaf33** (5): the intro caught me way off guard

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): uhhh it’s cute i guess but leaving day 1 probably edit: nvm i have been informed this is a cover of a song from some nugu group called “s club 7”. maybe it’s leaving day 2 instead

**bulforster** (4.4): I'm kinda missing the group vocals from the original's chorus

**RandomHypnotica** (4): unfortunately for Jolin, I hate this obnoxiously cheesy kinda pop, so I don't exactly like the original song or her version. It feels so obnoxiously cheery, like it would be playing on the intro to Degrassi

**rslashpoopheads** (4): this sounds like a Disney Channel song (derogatory)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (3): listening to this song gave me cavities

**QustoMar** (3): This was trying to be a cute bubblegum pop classic but like… it’s not rlly giving anything :/

**wavingwolves** (3): i feel mean for strongly disliking such a joyful chorus but god she's making it really hard for me not to with the way this gets repeated

**abcd9muses** (2): also giving me Disney original movie...

**drejski** (2): Please stop

**2dina3dworld** (10): “you look stupid” - me after my 11 goes out on day one again

**akanewasright** (10): this is literal camp… also the rest of their first (available) English album is this weird but also a lot less… lyrically weird and more unironically good

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this song is SO 2004 and that is why it’s a 10!!! It should be illegal for a song to be this freaking catchy. This is one I keep coming back to!! The outro is a literal MESS but I don’t care

**plastichaxan** (10): the youtube comments made me feel brave enough to give this an ironic 10 but idk how ironic it is now, at least she’s got a new microphone!

**runaway3212** (10): this is camp in the worst way

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (9): "Japanesey"......Pretending I don't hear it

**CrimsonROSET** (9): do the anime rate

**stryxen** (9): the two genders easy breezy and Japaneesy

**wavingwolves** (9): "you look stupid" well yeah i do but you didn't have to say it like that :/

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.9): Americans were never gonna grasp the nuance that this song has, it’s camp but belies a very real anger at being fetishized and discarded, and it's delivered with attitude that sounds cathartic for Utada. The "Japanesey" line is a tongue in cheek moment that’s obviously meant to mock the racist way this careless lover thinks, but unfortunately it does land clunkily.

**Kwcty6888** (8.5): you’re easy breezy I’m japanesey is all I need to say

**abcd9muses** (8): Utada can pen some of the cutest, brightest lyrics in pop, and this whole song is an example of them doing just that.

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.8): okay i actually love how uneasy the production in this is but the lyrics and their vocals in this bring it down for me

**sage** (7.8): easy breezy japanesey... lyrical legend

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): I do like this although "I'm Japanesey" took me out lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I love the chorus but I’m sorry these verses do not sound great.

**celladonn** (7.5): My opinion on whether this is outright terrible or a camp masterpiece changes with every listen, I don't know how to score this

**bbfan132** (7): i like the production

**jasannn** (7): I don't find this song that good but it was stuck in my head for a half a day so it gets some points for that.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): “you’re easy breezy and i’m japanese-y” holy shit

**Roxieloxie** (7): me: hi i- akane: * breaking through my window *  did you know that * climbing up the wall * that utada once had an english album and * waling through the window * once had a song on it called easy breezy * pacing around * and its essentially about wanting to fuck your neighbor * suddenly stopping * and they say the line 'your easy breezy and im Japanesesy' * pacing around again * did you know they self produced it , do you know these things, are you aware of them??

**SmileAndTears** (7): so that's where that line comes from 💀

**TiltControls** (7): it's something that's for sure

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): ...you are easy breezy and I’m japanesy?

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): Did they say "and I'm Japenesey" or am I just crazy?

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): honestly, they knew what they were writing, and how camp it was, the world just wasn't ready (but the song itself is kinda weak overall honestly)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.3): It's a cute beat. These lyrics are a thing

**drejski** (6): Not into this type of sound but I like the chorus

**ivyleaf33** (6): SHE'S GOT A NEW MICROPHONE~

**racloves** (6): Who (American?) wrote this?!? I’m not even Japanese but I feel offended on their behalf

**saviorARMY101** (6): YOU'RE EASY BREEZY AND I'M JAPANEESSY

**skargardin** (6): Dare I say camp

**GARjuna** (5): They sound pitchy for some reason

**nt96** (5): Japaneasy really? I american't koreaneven with you right now.

**throwaway7650** (5): the lyrics seem like they were written for a kpop group except the ~~xenophobic~~ songwriters got the country of origin wrong... oops?

**apatel27** (4): You're easy breezy and I'm Japaneesy sounds like a Kabukicho tourist trap slogan

**fkadizzy-1804** (4): something about the production and vocal stylings make this feel eerily like a Flavours of Entanglement era Alanis Morissette reject. All I can say is I wish it were Kremlin Dusk or You Make Me Want To Be A Man instead

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): it's easier to pretend this doesn't exist

**rslashpoopheads** (4): kinda annoying but saved by japanesey

**seanderlust** (4): i just want to log that this album is very hit or miss. unfortunately this is one of the misses for me, but when it hits it HITS. stream kremlin dusk and hotel lobby and wonder 'bout, which features both timbaland and danja!!!

**vayyiqra** (4): "I'm Japanese-y" is certainly a lyric that exists. Anyway. an okay enough song, I guess, aside from the dubious lyrics. I feel like I heard a million songs during the 2000s with this exact beat. It's nothing special. I almost gave it my 0 but felt like being nice and spared it.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (3): I don’t like the lyricism or the instrumental

**fadedblue09** (3): Idk why but it sounds basic and the lyrics made me cringe

**jaztinax** (3): “you’re easy breezy and i’m japaneesy” ???????

**sarcasticsobs** (3): oh

**cremeebrulee** (2): you’re a covergirl model and i’m katy perry

**1998tweety** (0): Not Japaneesy....

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (0): we are going to pretend we didn't hear that

**bulforster** (0): I just can't get past 'Japanesey'

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this song does not work I’m afraid, I can’t with them rhyming japanesy with breezy, and their vocals sound off here. Maybe it’s cause it’s in English although simple and clean is excellent so … yeah it’s definitely the whole song

**lagozzino** (0): At that point in time the chances of any asian popstar finding success in the American market were extremely slim, but if anyone had a realistic shot of pulling it off it was Utada who was actually born and raised in the US, is fluent in english, and was already known to a solid chunk of the American audience thanks to "Simple & Clean"'s association with Kingdom Hearts... and then "Easy Breezy" was chosen as the first single and it was over before it started.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): were they forced to sing these lyrics with a gun to their head or

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is like animal crossing music but in the best way

**seanderlust** (10): jolin in the house! this one is so cute omfg. it sounds like they recorded their vocals while snuggling

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (9): I think they're saying "our love in the house" which appalls me but I'm letting Utada say "I'm Japanesey" so I can't dock them for this

**celladonn** (9): This is actually extremely cute. Also before I heard this I was definitely pronouncing Jolin's name incorrectly in my head

**jasannn** (9): JOLIN IN DA HOUSE. DT IN DA HOUSE

**runaway3212** (8.5): We love a song about healthy relationship!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): "D.T. in the house! Jolin in the house!" (x3) 💀💀 What is this!! But seriously, apart from that the song is sweet

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): this is cute.

**duochromepalmtree** (8): this song actually totally won me over. I had it rated like a 2 but I came back to it a couple of times because I couldn’t stop thinking about how much I didn’t like it and now I love it. Can’t get enough of the cheese.

**GARjuna** (8): balladphobia coming back a bit.

**TiltControls** (8): it's cute [2]

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.8): the "in the house" bit sends me but in a cute way! a good cheese. actually really enjoy the use of i think harmonica??? and theremin?

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): up until the weird rap I could see how you could use this as a wedding song

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**apatel27** (7): Cute little duet. Quite cheesy tho

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): a man? in my east asian pop royalty rate? it's more likely than you think

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**Jhe116** (7): The chorus is still very iconic but there’s just too many cringy elements in this

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (7): Strange intros/outros have never made a song, but they break them easily.

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): lol this is camp

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I love the parts when they're singing, but the rapping parts are a no for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): It's fun but a little flat for me.

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): rap part not for me, everything else was nice

**bigbigbee** (6.5): If you go to any karaoke salon, you will hear two people warbling a song exactly like this to each other in at LEAST one adjacent room while you’re just trying to get down to Mr. Brightside by the Killers

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why does this feel like 5 genres blended together

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): cute

**mengzhongmeng** (6): Jolin! In! The! House!

**nt96** (6): It's giving me Animal Crossing with hip hop sensibilities playing during the end credits.

**skargardin** (6): this is pretty but not a favourite by any means

**abcd9muses** (5.5): fun karaoke song; actually at first I was indifferent to it, but the further along it went, the more I warmed up to it.

**bbfan132** (5.5): hmm…. it’s not bad but it bored me

**RandomHypnotica** (5.2): this instrumental is NOT doing it for me, it sounds like something that would play in a western/desert town in a JRPG

**BeauMeringue212** (5): This is a lil cheesy for me, her only big miss on here for me

**drejski** (5): Not the worst cruisy R&B ballad I've ever heard

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): “DT in the house!” me when i made a photo frame in year 7 Design Technology and gave it to my dad for christmas but it was made so badly it couldn’t hold a photo so he just put the empty frame on the windowsill

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): fuck the institution of marriage

**stryxen** (5): the cover art of this is killing me that can NOT be comfortable

**throwaway7650** (5): it's a pretty duet tbh but what was going through their minds during the "in the house" parts... I can't. EVICTED!

**akanewasright** (4): OUR LOVE IN THE HOUSE

**CrimsonROSET** (4): there’s some whores in this house there’s some whores in this house

**fadedblue09** (4): Cute harmonica but ultimately bland. And wtf was that outro

**QustoMar** (4): A generic cafe acoustic song with a man, anyways.

**racloves** (4): sorry this is just kinda boring

**sage** (4): what was that outro help.. also the rap was so emotionless it kinda sent

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): idk guys i think they want you to know that jolin is in the house and dt is in the house

**vayyiqra** (4): Oh no. I get that they're not being all that serious here (Jolin literally bursts out laughing at the end), but this is way too corny.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3.2): This is the kind of boring mid 2000s music I do not miss.

**fkadizzy-1804** (3): and now we’ve taken a hard left back into sapsville. Can’t deny the chorus is an earworm tho

**ivyleaf33** (2): the rap cracks me up every time, i can't help it

**wavingwolves** (1): even though i can admit sometimes corniness adds flavour and while several songs in this rate are proof of that this isn't one of them

**plastichaxan** (0): i'm heterophobic

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.353): there’s a reason why she’s known as the madonna of asia. kinda hoping she wins bc we’ve had japanese and korean rate winners before

**Jhe116** (8.159): I’m not afraid of admitting that as a Taiwanese, I pay no attention to Taiwanese music scene. It just bores me. That being said, if I said a Jolin Tsai song is a hit, then you would know it’s a HIT hit

**celladonn** (8.088): I wasn't familiar with Jolin before this rate and I'm super glad this introduced me to her, she seems lovely and has some amazing bops!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.029): damn, jolin got bops

**vayyiqra** (7.824): Jolin is the artist I had heard most in the rate before doing it, having heard *Play* and some of her other songs, plus the only one who does music in a language I can almost kind of understand if it's written out for me, so I'm biased here. Still I like her electropop/dance-pop style a lot, even if it's not as experimental as Utada's music nor as vibey as BoA's. I like pretty much everything she's done here, plus she has consistently neat visuals (but then, don't they all)

**fadedblue09** (7.824): I don’t really follow Cpop but I’m surprised how much I recognize some of her early stuff (granted, Taiwan had quite the grip on our pop culture back in the 2000’s). Also I really liked how she is committed to her musical themes, which is apparent in her later work. I doubt I’ll ever immerse myself into Cpop (given the increasingly tense political atmosphere) so I’m glad this rate made me give her a chance.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.659): A lot of her early stuff just really feels generic and/or didn't stick with me, but over time I found it to improve, but I think that ultimately she's the weakest of the 3 artists here.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.629): OK after listening, I see why she has stans on this sub, she has very main pop girl energy. Ugly Beauty has been on repeat for me

**jasannn** (7.618): I'm surprised I prefer her earlier cheesy pop stuff compared to her current electropop sound.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.441): was lowkey expecting more great songs from her #noshade and this is why faye wong remains queen but she still has some bangers

**hikk** (7.441): this was a pretty neat selection of songs that really show a change in sound across the years

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.429): I’m more familiar with Jolin Tsai the public figure then I am her music and I am very excited to check it out for this rate :)

**mengzhongmeng** (7.118): stream 戀我癖EGO-HOLIC by Jolin Tsai and Starr Chen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.029): i had never really listened to much chinese language music outside of a few song here and there, so this is pretty much my first time listening to music from taiwan. after listening to all of jolin’s songs, i can definitely see why she’s as popular as she is, and its interesting to see how much she evolved over the course of 20+ years. if i had to pick one era represented in this rate i enjoyed the most, id say the muse era was the best in my opinion.

**SmileAndTears** (6.647): She's cool but she had a lot more misses than BoA and Utada imo

**ivyleaf33** (6.641): at first i only listened to her to try and be a more cultured taiwanese and now im obsessed. so. i guess it worked?

**QustoMar** (6.500): Jolin is definitely the pop diva of this trio I know the least about. From this rate I feel interested to explore more of her 2010s discography. Her material from her debut to around the late-2000s at least based on these singles is  not my kind of thing. But the artistic journey she has been on from Muse to Ugly Beauty is very interesting to me and I think I’ll explore that more (though I’ve already listened to the Play album quite a bit). There’s a parallel here between Jolin and BoA because both of them have ~2 decade long careers, and both I feel in the late-90s to late-2000s were putting out pretty commercial material, but have really found themselves through the 2010s.

**sage** (5.494): i was rly underwhelmed with these songs actually but a few of them were memorable!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.518): My favourite artist coming into the rate, and probably still my favourite coming out. They would be my highest average if not for the couple of duds in this tracklist, but I generally think that their discography has aged the best, they had a really futuristic sound, and their newest work continues to be innovative and unique, and I'm excited to listen to their discog more, and for what comes next.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.253): a specific thing i noticed was that basically every song of theirs was basically 4 minutes or longer. the more utada the better

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.882): one of the most iconic artists to come from new york. easily the best vocalist in the rate. and best twitter. tons of ballads tho. kumi koda and namie amuro better match the level of cvnt of the other 2 artists.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.853): emperor of mystical bops (and kingdom hearts themes)

**SmileAndTears** (7.747): I was kinda worried listening to the first couple of songs in this rate but they kept getting better and better

**celladonn** (7.735): I previously only knew Utada's music from Kingdom Hearts and while I don't think anything here is going to dethrone Simple and Clean as my favourite song from them I very much enjoyed what I heard here

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.676): pleasantly surprised by how good most of these songs are

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.647): Utada is the singer here I am way more familiar with because of video games and anime whether it’s replaying osts for video games I did not play or replaying Poppin’.

**fadedblue09** (7.588): Idk if this is because of their vocals, or maybe just something about Jpop’s aesthetic as a whole, but their music has this distinctive flavor. The instrumentals have a lush quality and the melodies have this tinge of angst and dramatic emotion which gives their discography a certain vibe. My knowledge of Jpop is mostly limited to anime music but you can really tell how the genre is consistent on its own.

**jasannn** (7.559): I was so excited to listen Utada after listening to Automatic but I was pretty disappointed until Fantome onwards.

**QustoMar** (7.441): In contrast to BoA and Jolin Tsai, Utada Hikaru figured out their niche immediately from album number one (which is extremely impressive with how young they were???). Yet this hasn’t stopped them from always reinventing and serving some uplifting bops! Like Jolin and BoA, I like seeing how in the last few years, Utada has experimented even more with their artistry, challenging what you may expect from them. This is resulting in new highlights of their discography, 20+ years into their career when many would typically write off an artist.

**vayyiqra** (7.235): Utada is an artist I'd heard a lot about before doing this rate, but never heard before ... or so I thought, because it turns out I did know a few of these songs vaguely from *Neon Genesis Evangelion* and *Kingdom Hearts* (which I've never played oddly). I had heard they had a more experimental approach to music, which checks out on a lot of these tracks - many of the most interesting or unique instrumentals come from their tracks in this playlist. I didn't love everything here, but there were quite a few highs. I feel like perhaps Utada is not quite my thing but I plan to listen to at least a couple of their albums and see what they're like, so the rate succeeded at doing that at least. Maybe they'll grow on me, time will tell.

**hikk** (7.118): contrary to popular belief my username is not intended as a reference to utada (or a reference to anything actually). if it was i think i would be more interested in their music bc as a whole (in this rate at least) it was just... pleasant, a bit too slow in a lot of parts for my personal liking, but not bad. 7s, 7s, 7s across the board

**sage** (7.065): tbh the beginning of their career >>>>>> the later stuff going off of these songs exclusively.. the first few songs are all amazing, i really need to finish their discography

**ivyleaf33** (5.682): wish i loved their music as much as i love them as a person

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.647): im almost disappointed in myself for how low my scores for utada were. considering ive been a fan of jpop for over a decade and utada was the only artist i was familiar with in this rate before doing it, i was fully expecting to give them my highest in this rate off name recognition alone. unfortunately, the majority of their songs mostly go in one ear and out another for me. im just not a fan of slow rnb/pop songs like so many of their songs are and if you asked me to hum a single note of any of them i probably couldnt recall what they sound like. honestly i feel like i was being too generous with these scores but i dont wanna get accused of sabotage. sorry utada, ill make it up to you by giving simple and clean a 10 in the winners rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.788): BoA may not be my favourite artist overall here, but she has incredible consistency, and even her "worst" tracks in this rate are honestly still great, and I think that's how she ended up with my highest average.

**mengzhongmeng** (8.529): started and finished the rate BoA biased, she really is *the* Best of Asia

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.518): [adjusts tinfoil lacefront] No. 1 was omitted to give the others a chance to win despite being one of BoA's signature hits

**BeauMeringue212** (8.388): OK after this I gotta go through her albums, a queen

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.265): they don't call her the queen of kpop for nothing

**hikk** (7.824): i like kpop a lot but had never rly listened to boa, she was expectedly my fave of the three i think

**celladonn** (7.794): BoA's always been a major gap in my kpop knowledge so I'm glad to have made this little dent in listening to her discography (even though she has like 100 more singles) I especially loved her songs from the early '10s.

**runaway3212** (7.647): she makes a great case for SM bias

**QustoMar** (7.559): Just based on the selection of songs here from each artist, I think BoA is my fave in this rate. I’m a pop diva music girlie, and BoA here delivers everything I need . Well, I wasn’t a big fan of her 2000s discog as much when she kinda was just putting out whatever the SM machine had in store. However, once BoA started taking more control over her music starting around the Identity album in 2010, everything changed. She has really carved out her own unique and fresh sound, and I think she improves with every release. Also, what's interesting about BoA is she is the only true "pop diva" of K-Pop. You look at the US or Japan for instance, and you can list so so many different iconic divas, but in K-Pop it's really just BoA... maybe Lee Hyori or IU? But BoA is the only one you could compare to like the Madonna/Janet Jackson level. This puts her in a very unique position within the fast-paced K-Pop industry as sorta the only 'foundational' pop star figure (from my knowledge). I think she wears the glove very well, she embodies so much of why people love K-Pop, and though maybe in the past years she hasn’t been tearing up the MelOn charts, she constantly refines her craft and I love to see it.

**vayyiqra** (7.529): Boa is the artist I knew least about before this rate and the only one I had definitely never heard before. After hearing these songs I thought she was my least favourite in the rate, but I did enjoy most of her songs, and I gave her a couple of 10s even, so I must like her.  In fact, she got a slightly higher average from me than Utada. :thinking: Also, now I finally understand the difference between BoA and Bôa, who are a British alt-rock band who did the theme to the anime *Serial Experiments Lain*, which is a good show and a great song but they have absolutely nothing to do with BoA the K-pop artist. (Though it would be funny if she covered that song like I'd get a big kick out of it.) Anyway, glad I did this rate! I discovered a lot of cool songs I wouldn't have otherwise heard and now I'm just using this space to say that so hi /u/Ghost-Quartet thanks for hosting it

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.506): My Catholic Queen

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.471): i grew up on her music! she’s jesus where i live

**sage** (7.365): a lot of her older stuff has never really done anything for me (ive heard her entire discog) but she still has so many great singles

**SmileAndTears** (7.353): I said this in a comment already but she reminds me so much of Britney Spears.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.206): early songs are a rough patch but she has a lot of slays after that...was surprised she had my lowest average as i'm a kpoppie

**ivyleaf33** (7.000): the lack of masayume chasing physically hurts me, that shit was my childhood

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (6.953): She's good but feels less interesting than the other two

**fadedblue09** (6.824): Running through her discography is almost like taking a Kpop history lesson, you really can see the trends and changes of the genre in the last 2 decades. A lot of her early stuff feels like her talent is being sabotaged by some...questionable production choices but once it hits a certain period, it becomes serve after serve. Definitely the most inconsistent discog of the three, but still enjoyable nonetheless.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.412): if jolin was mostly highs for me and utada was mostly lows, boa in sitting nicely in the middle between them in terms of enjoyment. im big into electronic pop/hyperpop so i really enjoyed the run of songs from peace b to copy and paste but everything after that is very hit or miss to me bc of the difference of styles. still an enjoyable listening experience considering im not very big on kpop outside of a few songs.
