The East Asian Pop Royalty Rate Reveal, Day 1: Jolin in the house, Utada in the house, BoA in the house, sweet sweet rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/qdmid0/the_east_asian_pop_royalty_rate_reveal_day_1/

Hey y'all, after months of being badgered by me to turn in your scores the day has finally come where we begin revealing the results of the East Asian Pop Royalty Rate! I'm your host reddit user /u/Ghost-Quartet and I'm here to guide you through this harrowing experience.

---

Before we begin, here's what you need to know about the rate:

* Number of participants: [77](https://pastebin.com/d15LwCZc)

* Average Score: 7.723

* Average Controversy Score: 1.697 (meaning anything above this is controversial, anything below this is surprisingly noncontroversial)

[Join us in the Beatsense room where the songs will be revealed!](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj) Today we'll be revealing **#51-34** I would recommend turning on subtitles on YouTube first, many videos we'll be seeing have them.

DilemmaOfAHedgehog: People seem confused about them giving up their American citizenship (through it was mostly a joke) and basically Japan doesn’t let you have dual citizenship and they had both and had to give up one of them (also honestly it seems a lot harder to get naturalized as Japanese?)

Though there’s definitely dual citizens (maybe even Utada?)who are just like just keep your head low bc no one is going to check as long as you don’t show the wrong passport to the wrong government
