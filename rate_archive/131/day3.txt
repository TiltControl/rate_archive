The East Asian Pop Royalty Rate Reveal, Day 3: Can you give me one last day?
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/qexg2b/the_east_asian_pop_royalty_rate_reveal_day_3_can/

Alright folks, after months of preparation, dozens of ballots, at least three different languages, we're finally finishing the East Asian Pop Royalty Rate. I hope it's been as much fun for you as it has been for me, but we're not done yet!

If you need a recap of Day 1, [here's the link](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/qdmid0/the_east_asian_pop_royalty_rate_reveal_day_1/)

None of this information has changed since yesterday!

* Number of participants: [77](https://pastebin.com/d15LwCZc)

* Average Score: 7.723

* Average Controversy Score: 1.697 (meaning anything above this is controversial, anything below this is surprisingly noncontroversial)

[Join us in the Beatsense room where the songs will be revealed!](https://www.beatsense.com/ripplugdj) Today we'll be revealing **#33-17** I would recommend turning on subtitles on YouTube first, many videos we'll be seeing have them.

akanewasright: So here are my thoughts on how things could place. Feel free to use these to clown on me later:

So Utada got decimated a bit yesterday. That was hard to watch as a big stan of theirs. But I’m not too worried. 

* Sun & Moon is probably one of the first eliminations today. It’s a great song but it’s pretty out there, and I was honestly really happily surprised to see it made it this far. 

* Automatic probably makes the top 10 but not top 5. It’s a great song and an iconic one, but I can see a few people tanking it for some of the vocals 

* Traveling or One Last Kiss might win. Both have been really well liked by nearly everyone I’ve seen, and they both seem to have a lot of 11s. One Last Kiss I could see getting minor “not a bop” tankings, but both are top 5 at least 

Jolin came out of yesterday doing really well! Unfortunately I don’t know if she can win, although I’d be happy with a few of her songs winning 

* every remaining song of hers I can see being divisive. From the clicking noises on Ugly Beauty to the campy lyrics off I’m Not Yours to the ~~hyperpop~~ excess of Play and the datedness of the rest, I can predict some reason why someone wouldn’t like them. However, I gave most of them 10s and would like to be surprised  

While Jolin is a bit of a mystery to me, BoA I feel a little more solid about. I think I know better which songs can go far. 

* Hurricane Venus and Copy & Paste are ticking timebombs. I think they slap, but I know for a fact they both have 0s, and as much as I love them, they are a bit dated and could get tanked by others as well. 

* Better is a big question mark to me, because I havent heard people talk about it, and to be honest I don’t like it as much as some of y’all seem to. I think my guess is that it goes out before the top 10, but it could easily break through. I don’t think this wins, at least 

* Kiss My Lips and One Shot Two Shot are both top 10 locks, and One Shot Two Shot is probably top 5. It feels like everyone likes these, as we should. These are her best shots (ha) at winning

Anyway, a lot of these eliminations surprised me, but we can still get a good winner imo. Can’t wait to be proven wrong in beatsense lmao

cremeebrulee: rly cool write up akane!! one thing i wanna say about better and songs with lack of discourse in general is that they usually do a lot better (haha) than most people expect, because usually no one talking = more of a consensus on it being good (but not great) and it seems like recently that songs like that perform really well so i wouldnt be surprised if it went far

cloudbustingmp3: love Hyuna and Sunmi but you’d have to throw in multiple b-sides for either one to compete, they just don’t have huge solo discographies. that being said now I need Sunmi in a rate to give either Siren or Black Pearl an 11

ivyleaf33: Miku is weird, I feel like she would need her own rate considering Vocaloid culture and the vocaloid/producer divide. Comparing the top Miku songs with other east Asian pop royalty just feels a bit odd cuz of that. A Vocaloid classics rate would be fantastic though. Also lol not TXT pls.

And the final debut song leaves us, a full 43 spots above Jolin’s debut song and 36 spots above BoA’s btw. Utada wrote and co-produced this track themselves when they were just 15 years old and it remains one of their signature hits– for some artists selling over two million copies of a single would be the peak of their career but for Utada it was literally just the beginning. You can already hear the raw talent on display that they’d continue to refine over the many years of their career, although the ‘90s r&b sound has become slightly dated.

---

#It’s Bopomatic

**jasannn** (11): Killing me softly with his song...

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): has such a beautiful and atmospheric type of feel to it - what a fitting song for an album centred around a “first love”, it’s so laidback and dreamy but emotional at the same time

**TragicKingdom1** (11): best production in the rate and thus the best song overall despite the slightly clunky hook

**wavingwolves** (11): there's just something so infatuating about this song ughhh i just love everything about it

**akanewasright** (10): This is like… their very first hit, and it’s already this fully formed, and they already sound so mature

**fadedblue09** (10): What a slick slice of R&B. Probably the best debut single here.

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): This song is really pretty.

**nt96** (10): An automatic win for Utada!

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this song always makes me think of gfriend rough these days

**sage** (10): one of the best debut songs ever actually, was almost my 11

**saviorARMY101** (10): A classic

**skargardin** (10): now this is how you debut

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): other than the disaster on PFRR i cant think of a song with Automatic in the title that i dont love

**plastichaxan** (9.5): they wrote this at 15??? kind of unfair to be so talented and cool and just perfect

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): an automatic hit

**1998tweety** (9): sensual bop

**bbfan132** (9): when this is your debut single…. they did that

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Wish the hook felt just a bit more cohesive but otherwise this rules.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is just so smooth, holy shit.

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (9): lol it makes sense so many songs in this rate a very 2000s but also it’s so funny because this album is from the year I was born so my first reaction is just “this isn’t vintage but it’s dated”.  However ‘99 babies should stick together including me and this album.

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**runaway3212** (9): They sound so incredibly beautiful here

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is the second song I’ve heard from this album and wow it’s just so fresh sounding even though it’s very distinctly 90’s

**throwaway7650** (8.5): utada's (intentional) intonation with certain notes is very hit-or-miss with me and it's more miss than hit on this track but I still really like it

**abcd9muses** (8): such a chill track, pulls you in and lets you float with ease

**celladonn** (8): Very smooth

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is adorable

**fkadizzy-1804** (8): I can’t fault the slinky beat or the angelic harmonies or Utada’s sweet, earnest vocals, but if I’m being critical there is something that feels a tiny bit unfinished/unpolished about this song. The line between chill and boring can be fine and this song just barely walks it imo

**rotating3Dtext** (8): it’s kinda long

**rslashpoopheads** (8): very warm and fuzzy

**stryxen** (8): lounge vibes got me moving my head side to side, maybe even wagging a finger slightly

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Their voice is so good! They were how old when they released this? Their voice sounds so mature.

**2dina3dworld** (7): that chika chika boom could have segued into My Name Is. Other than that, it’s very typical 90s jpop, this could’ve been a Speed song.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): it's time to get funky

**drejski** (7): The beat makes it good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): if an american pop girl had released this in english it probably wouldve been a really big hit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.6): This has such a nice groove. Reminds me of Robyn's first album, Show Me 11ove forever. But the vocals at the end leave a lot to be desired.

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): i love the instrumental but it’s too long

#CTRL+F “90s” - 8 results

**Roxieloxie** (10): my first experience with this album was hearing 'moving on without you' and i remember hearing it and being shocked how RnB influenced it was and I went to check to see what album it was from and was shocked to see it was from 1999. Anyway I love this so much the 90s rnb flavor is delicious

**sarcasticsobs** (10): vh1’s i love the 90’s. 1st non-kingdom hearts song i heard from them and it still rules

**jaztinax** (9): i’ve been obsessed with the late 90s/early 2000s sound lately so this is right up my lane

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Love the late 90's r&b sound to this

**seanderlust** (8.5): it feels very 90s but also like it would have done very well stateside in the 90s. it also holds up very well

**duochromepalmtree** (8): all of the 90s/early 00s vibes and I am obsessed. Probably did not need to be as long as it is lol

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): classic 90's R&B but really well refined and smooth, what's not to like?

**vayyiqra** (7): Yeah this is *very* 90s R&B, but I like it.

And so Jolin, tragically but rather predictably, is the first one to bow out of the rate. I was a bit concerned with her having less name recognition than the other two artists but the positive reception she received from users and the way this song spent a lot of the first month at #1 gave me hope… but alas, it was not to be. I’ve grown so much in my appreciation of her over the course of this rate and all of the positive comments from users discovering her for the first time really warmed my heart– it’s strange that someone with millions of fans in her homeland could be so unknown in the West but now she’s got 70+ more people in her corner.

It’s fitting that this would be her last song though because, well, she really is a great artist! This is a complete tour de force that shows off her artistry to the fullest extent, an insistent banger with a strong message. For those of you who didn’t look them up the lyrics feature Jolin calling out to a woman who’s being used by a man to WAKE UP and realize that she is “the great artist” with all of the power inside of her, a theme carried over to the sumptuous music video which envisions a futuristic version of a salon (a place where French scholars would meet during the Enlightenment era to discuss) where Jolin exposes a wannabe intellectual for the lech he is. It’s good stuff.

#Woke

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): this song is immaculate. the production, the lyrics, the synths, everything about this song is amazing. fuck that man, you don't need him

**Jhe116** (11): This is hands down her magnum opus. Like I don’t even pay attention to Taiwanese pop but I know how to sing this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): she wasnt lying she IS the great artist. also unrelated to the song itself but the music video for this is a serve as well (EDIT i kept coming back to this song even when i was trying to rate the other artists bc its so good. id say that makes it 11 worthy)

**akanewasright** (10): THIS is where I truly fall hard for Jolin’s music. The production has aged a little, but it slaps and EVERYTHING is here artistically - the lyrics, the visuals, and a sense of Jolin being the absolute, undeniable center of it all. She OWNS this song completely

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): looove the harder electronic edge this has, contrasts wonderfully with how sweet her voice is

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): I really like the use of effect on her voice, and the song is very bright and fun and dynamic to me.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I love everything about this, the production is fantastic (that harpsichord in the bridge!!!), the lyrics are really interesting and the MV is absolutely gorgeous

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is very 2012 but im here for it

**runaway3212** (10): God im so gay

**sarcasticsobs** (10): love the guitar on this, then those chorus synths, baby!

**seanderlust** (10): leave him sis (jolin version)

**xavieryes** (10): the title says it all

**throwaway7650** (9.5): jolin is really good at choruses huh... overall super solid

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I don't even know what she's saying, but tbh I don't care cause this is a bop.

**QustoMar** (8.5): A lot of Jolin's earlier material feels like something great was hidden in there, waiting to be unleashed but was not quite there yet. This song is more what I wanted to see, this has much more personality, production is powerful and punchy, Jolin is switching up her delivery and has way more emotion. Jolin feels like she is finally HERE.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): kinda boppin

**BeauMeringue212** (8.4): Love the production here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.3): Electric guitar in a pop song? Rina's influence.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8): the little woomf woomf in the back reminds me of Rainism, it’s kinda like it’s less horny cousin

**apatel27** (8): This would bang live, not so much sitting at home

**bbfan132** (8): this bopped!!

**bigbigbee** (8): The chorus lets this down (I want something more EXO, more loud and melodic – see Exo-M’s MAMA for the closest analogue of what I want) but it’s still great

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she’s right and she should say it

**fadedblue09** (8): A lil overproduced, I love the message and lyrical metaphors used

**fkadizzy-1804** (8): most of this song I LOVE but I have to dock a point because some sections do drag on a bit

**frogaranaman** (8): so true

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I dig this futuristic sound for her

**nt96** (8): Jolin asserting herself to the other two flop girlies.

**plastichaxan** (8): good for her

**duochromepalmtree** (7.8): how is it possible this song wasn’t on one of the fast and furious soundtracks???

**abcd9muses** (7): it's like Charli xcx joined K/DA

#The Great Video

**celladonn** (11): Wow what a banger!!! I loved the video as well

**ivyleaf33** (11): the vocal effects and spoken parts are just so fun and cool and this mv is honestly just insane. her looks are insane. god i love her so much.

**skargardin** (10): This video is a visual TREAT YASSSS

**Osaka1268** (9): shes serving looks in this video tho

**SmileAndTears** (8): I liked this a lot more than her other late 00s/early 10s electro-pop bops tbh. The chorus was catchy, the video had a BUDGET and it was just good overall?

**vayyiqra** (8): This bangs and I agree, I love the futuristic vibe of the video and the lyrics are cool.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): okay they went off with this MV budget

#Jolin is gonna slap you

Oh my dear sweet “traveling.” If I were giving my 11 to Utada it would have gone to this song because it’s so much fun, Utada isn’t really someone I’d describe as a “dance pop” artist but they nailed this one to the wall. This song is just in a league of its own, it sounds both retro and futuristic at the same time and that house beat is to die for! True to its name this song travelled around the Top 20 a lot, but by the end of the rate it emerged as a strong frontrunner that unfortunately fell short. It still has one of the coolest music videos in the rate though!

#Globe trotters

**bbfan132** (11): holy shit this is great, i love how dreamy it is

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I would walk 500 miles and I would walk 500 more for this song!

**RandomHypnotica** (11): idk where we're going but I am here for the ride

**akanewasright** (10): This song is just SO smooth and slinky and unlike so much of their output, but I love it with all my life

**celladonn** (10): Very fun!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): where are we going

**fadedblue09** (10): Very unique instrumentation, and the lyrics add to its dreamy quality

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): considered purely as a pop banger, this may well be the best song in the rate

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): i wouldn't mind this being the winner

**plastichaxan** (10): okay but how do i get into this train

**runaway3212** (10): This is camp in the best way

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The perfect song to listen to on the bus, and I spend a lot of time there.

**seanderlust** (10): the dance-pop/house transition in this album eats. this song is so good for road trips btw. also they truly ATE on this album

**stryxen** (10): the way they invented the sad girl lowercase title trend ugh floplore wishes

**xavieryes** (10): a banger

**duochromepalmtree** (9.5): I absolutely love their voice on this one!!!! The last minute of the song is PERFECT.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): YASSS

**QustoMar** (9.5): Hold up this is my jam... the second I heard the production I was like why haven't I listened to this sooner??

**OliviaGodrigo** (8.353): there’s a reason why she’s known as the madonna of asia. kinda hoping she wins bc we’ve had japanese and korean rate winners before

**Jhe116** (8.159): I’m not afraid of admitting that as a Taiwanese, I pay no attention to Taiwanese music scene. It just bores me. That being said, if I said a Jolin Tsai song is a hit, then you would know it’s a HIT hit

**celladonn** (8.088): I wasn't familiar with Jolin before this rate and I'm super glad this introduced me to her, she seems lovely and has some amazing bops!

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.029): damn, jolin got bops

**vayyiqra** (7.824): Jolin is the artist I had heard most in the rate before doing it, having heard *Play* and some of her other songs, plus the only one who does music in a language I can almost kind of understand if it's written out for me, so I'm biased here. Still I like her electropop/dance-pop style a lot, even if it's not as experimental as Utada's music nor as vibey as BoA's. I like pretty much everything she's done here, plus she has consistently neat visuals (but then, don't they all)

**fadedblue09** (7.824): I don’t really follow Cpop but I’m surprised how much I recognize some of her early stuff (granted, Taiwan had quite the grip on our pop culture back in the 2000’s). Also I really liked how she is committed to her musical themes, which is apparent in her later work. I doubt I’ll ever immerse myself into Cpop (given the increasingly tense political atmosphere) so I’m glad this rate made me give her a chance.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.659): A lot of her early stuff just really feels generic and/or didn't stick with me, but over time I found it to improve, but I think that ultimately she's the weakest of the 3 artists here.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.629): OK after listening, I see why she has stans on this sub, she has very main pop girl energy. Ugly Beauty has been on repeat for me

**jasannn** (7.618): I'm surprised I prefer her earlier cheesy pop stuff compared to her current electropop sound.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.441): was lowkey expecting more great songs from her #noshade and this is why faye wong remains queen but she still has some bangers

**hikk** (7.441): this was a pretty neat selection of songs that really show a change in sound across the years

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.429): I’m more familiar with Jolin Tsai the public figure then I am her music and I am very excited to check it out for this rate :)

**mengzhongmeng** (7.118): stream 戀我癖EGO-HOLIC by Jolin Tsai and Starr Chen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.029): i had never really listened to much chinese language music outside of a few song here and there, so this is pretty much my first time listening to music from taiwan. after listening to all of jolin’s songs, i can definitely see why she’s as popular as she is, and its interesting to see how much she evolved over the course of 20+ years. if i had to pick one era represented in this rate i enjoyed the most, id say the muse era was the best in my opinion.

**SmileAndTears** (6.647): She's cool but she had a lot more misses than BoA and Utada imo

**ivyleaf33** (6.641): at first i only listened to her to try and be a more cultured taiwanese and now im obsessed. so. i guess it worked?

**QustoMar** (6.500): Jolin is definitely the pop diva of this trio I know the least about. From this rate I feel interested to explore more of her 2010s discography. Her material from her debut to around the late-2000s at least based on these singles is  not my kind of thing. But the artistic journey she has been on from Muse to Ugly Beauty is very interesting to me and I think I’ll explore that more (though I’ve already listened to the Play album quite a bit). There’s a parallel here between Jolin and BoA because both of them have ~2 decade long careers, and both I feel in the late-90s to late-2000s were putting out pretty commercial material, but have really found themselves through the 2010s.

**sage** (5.494): i was rly underwhelmed with these songs actually but a few of them were memorable!

A member of the rate committee who shall remain nameless revealed to me that one of the main concerns about this rate was that Utada would dominate and they did seem to be the favorite to win, so it might surprise you all to learn that Utada basically NEVER won this rate. After the first three ballots Utada never touched the #1 spot again, with “The Great Artist” and “One Shot, Two Shot” taking shifts in holding them off. I had assumed that the late ballots would push this one to the top but nope, despite getting the most 11s in the rate this is still about ten points behind our winner.

“One Last Kiss” would have made a fine winner though, it’s a gorgeous electropop song with surprisingly subdued production from A.G. Cook (yes THAT A.G. Cook) that’s just… beautiful to listen to, there’s no other way to put it. Although I really do love the song there is a bit of schadenfreude in the predictable winner losing, but then I guess “One Shot, Two Shot” wasn’t exactly unpredictable either, so…

#One last positive comments section

**apatel27** (10): Utada + A.G. Cook + Eva = perfection

**cremeebrulee** (10): new personal rating rule, if a song has made me cry its a 10

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (10): my username is an NGE reference lmao

**Jhe116** (10): The production is different but still suits them sooo well

**Necessary-Garlic2223** (10): I was so tempted to give this my eleven.

**plastichaxan** (10): payola actually works cause the more and more y'all played this in beatsense it kept growing on me and look where we are now

**QustoMar** (10): This is so so gorgeous, and I love how this song keeps what you expect in the core of an Utada Hikaru while still switching up the formula. The production in the second half??? EXCELLENCE

**RandomHypnotica** (10): SO pretty, a super romantic song with AG Cook production? The vibes on this are so incredibly pretty, and it feels like a great mix of their early stuff with minimalist pop sensisbilities, and it works SO well

**Roxieloxie** (10): okay i really do love this, like is this the obvious winner, yeah , but also its really good

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): A.G. Cook + Evangelion + Utada = instant classic

**saviorARMY101** (10): God I'm literally crying after hearing this, it just feels like a warm and soft hug. 😭❤️

**seanderlust** (10): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/425/697/2d1.png

**stryxen** (10): more like one last loop of this song it’s addictive

**throwaway7650** (10): an 11 contender and deserving winner. A.G. cook did that!

**xavieryes** (10): why are so many of their songs like "hmm this one's a 7 oh wait nvm it's another 10"

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): bop bop bop

**bbfan132** (9): this is super super pretty, ag cook’s production <3

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): wouldn’t be mad at all if this won

**vayyiqra** (9): Okay how did I not know Utada did so many NGE songs this is making me uneasy I thought I'd never heard their music before this rate even though they were on my radar. Anyway this is really good. The vocal line is beautiful, but also listen closely to the instrumental tracks; there's so much going on there.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.8): okay back to snapping i see thank GOD

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.8): this song grew on me so much in just a few listens

**celladonn** (8.5): We love an A.G. Cook produced bop

**GARjuna** (8.5): what does this have to do w eva?

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**drejski** (8): It's not amazing but there's something cute about it

**duochromepalmtree** (8): fun and catchy!

**fadedblue09** (8): I get that is one of their frontrunning songs but something's quite amiss.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I can't believe the melody for thank u, next came from the outro on this song!

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I love the melody. This song is just a whole vibe and I love it.

**abcd9muses** (7.5): Heart Station meets the 2020s, what's not to love

#I’ll [hate] you more than you’ll ever know

**sage** (7): ive never got the hype for this song at all like whats so great about it... but actually on this listen it hit more so maybe itll grow on me more

**TragicKingdom1** (7): i'm surprised A.G. produced this because it gives more Mura Masa to me

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I saw a few people hyping this up in discord however I think it falls a bit flat to me compared to their other work

**runaway3212** (6.5): Not my favourite but cool lyrically

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): gneh, not a fan of this production

**ivyleaf33** (6.3): really gorgeous and floaty, but it barely feels like it's there

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): It gets a five cause there’s just no reaction.

**wavingwolves** (4): this seems to be such a favourite and i really can't understand why exactly this would warrant such strong positive feelings for anyone but maybe that's the beauty of the subjective nature of music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): sounds like generic retail store music

#People who won’t be getting another 11 win

**akanewasright** (11): One thing I really loved about Mariah Carey’s Caution was her ability to take hitmaking producers and make them make a perfect Mariah Carey song instead of a perfect DJ Mustard beat, or a perfect Skrillex song. Utada does that here with PC Music founder AG Cook. They took the prime producer of label known for sounding inhuman and artificial and made a song that sounds like a hug. I really didn’t know if I’d 11this or traveling, but when I sat down and thought about it, this was the song I was more attached to, and the song that would feel the best for me to see win.

**BeauMeringue212** (11): It was very hard to decide which song would get my 11, but it's just gotta be this. I've had it on repeat since starting this rate, it's beautiful

**CrimsonROSET** (11): they’re an icon, they’re a legend, and they are the moment, come on now

**frogaranaman** (11): so true

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I haven’t watched the movie yet but this slaps

**sarcasticsobs** (11): get in the robot, shinji. truly do not know if this is actually the best song in the rate, but hot damn is it my favorite. full A.G. Cook + Utada record when?

**skargardin** (11): This song is so insanely stunning, it insantly captivated me the moment I heard it. Absolutely one of my favourite songs of the year, I really hope it does well in this rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.518): My favourite artist coming into the rate, and probably still my favourite coming out. They would be my highest average if not for the couple of duds in this tracklist, but I generally think that their discography has aged the best, they had a really futuristic sound, and their newest work continues to be innovative and unique, and I'm excited to listen to their discog more, and for what comes next.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.253): a specific thing i noticed was that basically every song of theirs was basically 4 minutes or longer. the more utada the better

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.882): one of the most iconic artists to come from new york. easily the best vocalist in the rate. and best twitter. tons of ballads tho. kumi koda and namie amuro better match the level of cvnt of the other 2 artists.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.853): emperor of mystical bops (and kingdom hearts themes)

**SmileAndTears** (7.747): I was kinda worried listening to the first couple of songs in this rate but they kept getting better and better

**celladonn** (7.735): I previously only knew Utada's music from Kingdom Hearts and while I don't think anything here is going to dethrone Simple and Clean as my favourite song from them I very much enjoyed what I heard here

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.676): pleasantly surprised by how good most of these songs are

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.647): Utada is the singer here I am way more familiar with because of video games and anime whether it’s replaying osts for video games I did not play or replaying Poppin’.

**fadedblue09** (7.588): Idk if this is because of their vocals, or maybe just something about Jpop’s aesthetic as a whole, but their music has this distinctive flavor. The instrumentals have a lush quality and the melodies have this tinge of angst and dramatic emotion which gives their discography a certain vibe. My knowledge of Jpop is mostly limited to anime music but you can really tell how the genre is consistent on its own.

**jasannn** (7.559): I was so excited to listen Utada after listening to Automatic but I was pretty disappointed until Fantome onwards.

**QustoMar** (7.441): In contrast to BoA and Jolin Tsai, Utada Hikaru figured out their niche immediately from album number one (which is extremely impressive with how young they were???). Yet this hasn’t stopped them from always reinventing and serving some uplifting bops! Like Jolin and BoA, I like seeing how in the last few years, Utada has experimented even more with their artistry, challenging what you may expect from them. This is resulting in new highlights of their discography, 20+ years into their career when many would typically write off an artist.

**vayyiqra** (7.235): Utada is an artist I'd heard a lot about before doing this rate, but never heard before ... or so I thought, because it turns out I did know a few of these songs vaguely from *Neon Genesis Evangelion* and *Kingdom Hearts* (which I've never played oddly). I had heard they had a more experimental approach to music, which checks out on a lot of these tracks - many of the most interesting or unique instrumentals come from their tracks in this playlist. I didn't love everything here, but there were quite a few highs. I feel like perhaps Utada is not quite my thing but I plan to listen to at least a couple of their albums and see what they're like, so the rate succeeded at doing that at least. Maybe they'll grow on me, time will tell.

**hikk** (7.118): contrary to popular belief my username is not intended as a reference to utada (or a reference to anything actually). if it was i think i would be more interested in their music bc as a whole (in this rate at least) it was just... pleasant, a bit too slow in a lot of parts for my personal liking, but not bad. 7s, 7s, 7s across the board

**sage** (7.065): tbh the beginning of their career >>>>>> the later stuff going off of these songs exclusively.. the first few songs are all amazing, i really need to finish their discography

**ivyleaf33** (5.682): wish i loved their music as much as i love them as a person

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.647): im almost disappointed in myself for how low my scores for utada were. considering ive been a fan of jpop for over a decade and utada was the only artist i was familiar with in this rate before doing it, i was fully expecting to give them my highest in this rate off name recognition alone. unfortunately, the majority of their songs mostly go in one ear and out another for me. im just not a fan of slow rnb/pop songs like so many of their songs are and if you asked me to hum a single note of any of them i probably couldnt recall what they sound like. honestly i feel like i was being too generous with these scores but i dont wanna get accused of sabotage. sorry utada, ill make it up to you by giving simple and clean a 10 in the winners rate.

=====

lagozzino: This rate reminded me that I generally have the wrong impression of what kind of artist Utada is. I always think of Utada as being a kinda alternative just-left-of-mainstream sort of popstar. I associate them mainly with songs like "Sanctuary" and "Bokyaku" and "You Make Me Want To Be A Man", which are all definitely still pop but have this kinda unconventional quality to them that you wouldn't expect from a bigtime hitmaking popstar. Kinda noisy, kinda edgy, kinda alternative. But then when I sit down to listen to the rest of their hits I'm reminded that they mostly release fairly straightforward pop songs with a heavy emphasis on simple ballads. I've ignored most of their output and cobbled together a version of Utada in mind that doesn't really exist based on like 1/10th of their discography.
[/r/popheads/comments/qexg2b/the_east_asian_pop_royalty_rate_reveal_day_3_can/hhwtw5t/]

=====

vayyiqra: Same. I always thought Utada was this bizarre, avant-garde, experimental art-pop artist and instead a lot of their songs are just ... 2000s R&B lol. But there were some left-field moments on a few songs so it's not totally untrue.

BoA has received many accolades throughout her career and now she gets to add one more: rate winner! And the first Kpop soloist to do so!

I’ve heard some people say that this is a “boring” winner and while it is a bit predictable that /r/popheads would vote a shimmery synthpop song as #1, this is such an immaculate pop song I really can’t complain. It’s intricate without relying on noise, the visuals are impressive without relying on flashy set pieces and stunts, her vocals are engaging without her needing to scream– a comeback like this would eat a lesser performer alive but BoA carries it all like it’s nothing because she’s got twenty years of experience behind her and she knows how to fucking give the people what they need! 

All hail the queen of Kpop, long may she reign.

#Party for WON!

**hikk** (11): i'm so predictable give me a kpop house track and i'll eat it up

**Osaka1268** (11): god i love BOA

#One bop, two bop

**akanewasright** (10): red shot blue shot?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I only needed one shot to like this song (bad pun)

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Ughh I love this so much. The house-y sound to it is just perfect

**bookthieving** (10): vaccination queen!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the way i absolutely used this in my ig story when i got my 2nd dose anyway this SLAPS ridiculously hard

**duochromepalmtree** (10): obsessed doesn’t get close to how I feel about this song.

**GARjuna** (10): this song is SO GORGEOUS. Like jesus christ!!!! Tutting w this song would be fun

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): more like ten shot haha am i right ladies

**nt96** (10): One shot, two shot right into day 3

**plastichaxan** (10): bop bop bop bop bop

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): yes

**QustoMar** (10): This is just like the definition of what you think of when you think “K-pop bop.” Like everything about this song is so so polished and infectious, it’s impossible not to adore this imo.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is basic bitch synthpop, good thing i'm a basic bitch

**Roxieloxie** (10): Im absolutely obsessed with this song and this video, the look with her where she has the sparkly outfit and her hair is curly,,,,, Ms. Boa i would kill for you

**runaway3212** (10): THIS GOES IN

**sage** (10): this song is so gay

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): more like Ten Shot

**saviorARMY101** (10): I hate how underrated this song is, it's literally her best song.

**seanderlust** (10): "one shot two shot just for one" BoA in her alcoholism era

**skargardin** (10): this is absolutely hypnotising

**throwaway7650** (10): immaculate production, boring rate winner though

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Who produced this? This is so catchy. Tbh I didn't think I would like cause of the title, but I was wrong.

**xavieryes** (10): more like 10 shot

**Kwcty6888** (9.6): we love a vaccine anthem

**1998tweety** (9): omg what a pussy popper

**2dina3dworld** (9): dance bops are where BoA shines best, such as this banger. The wub wub isn’t distracting, the vocals compliment BoA right and I guess it’s just good

**cremeebrulee** (9): one shot two shot red shot blue shot

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it feels like we’ve just returned from killing a man

**frogaranaman** (9): so true

**bbfan132** (8.5): bopping rn

**jasannn** (8.5): I'll be disappointed if this pulls a Shinee - View.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.3): I like that sound happening in the chorus

**wavingwolves** (8.1): it's good but it fails to be amazing

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (8): the fact this wasn’t shamelessly plugged with the two vaccines shots is such a lost opportunity it makes me mad.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the sister song to lmfao’s shots

**rslashpoopheads** (8): banger

**vayyiqra** (8): Maybe being kind of generous here but it is a big bop

#Cause of death: getting shot twice

**abcd9muses** (7): one of her newer songs but I think it's one of her cooler singles. Has the elements SM was really pushing in a lot their artists during the late 2010s, which is why I brought my score down slightly... at the same time though, I think BoA stands out uniquely. I actually had a really hard time rating this one because I do think the MV really elevates it (which I think happens frequently in Kpop)

**hookerofpop** (7): it’s alright, what can i say?

**ivyleaf33** (7): this song refused to get out of my head for at least a whole month

**fkadizzy-1804** (6.5): the verses are sooooo good and atmospheric and then the chorus just grates on me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Six points, six points.

**fadedblue09** (6): Banger but those distorted beats in the chorus are driving me nuts

#This was the first ballot I received

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): probably the most predictable rate winner but it’s so good so

**RandomHypnotica** (8.788): BoA may not be my favourite artist overall here, but she has incredible consistency, and even her "worst" tracks in this rate are honestly still great, and I think that's how she ended up with my highest average.

**mengzhongmeng** (8.529): started and finished the rate BoA biased, she really is *the* Best of Asia

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.518): [adjusts tinfoil lacefront] No. 1 was omitted to give the others a chance to win despite being one of BoA's signature hits

**BeauMeringue212** (8.388): OK after this I gotta go through her albums, a queen

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.265): they don't call her the queen of kpop for nothing

**hikk** (7.824): i like kpop a lot but had never rly listened to boa, she was expectedly my fave of the three i think

**celladonn** (7.794): BoA's always been a major gap in my kpop knowledge so I'm glad to have made this little dent in listening to her discography (even though she has like 100 more singles) I especially loved her songs from the early '10s.

**runaway3212** (7.647): she makes a great case for SM bias

**QustoMar** (7.559): Just based on the selection of songs here from each artist, I think BoA is my fave in this rate. I’m a pop diva music girlie, and BoA here delivers everything I need . Well, I wasn’t a big fan of her 2000s discog as much when she kinda was just putting out whatever the SM machine had in store. However, once BoA started taking more control over her music starting around the Identity album in 2010, everything changed. She has really carved out her own unique and fresh sound, and I think she improves with every release. Also, what's interesting about BoA is she is the only true "pop diva" of K-Pop. You look at the US or Japan for instance, and you can list so so many different iconic divas, but in K-Pop it's really just BoA... maybe Lee Hyori or IU? But BoA is the only one you could compare to like the Madonna/Janet Jackson level. This puts her in a very unique position within the fast-paced K-Pop industry as sorta the only 'foundational' pop star figure (from my knowledge). I think she wears the glove very well, she embodies so much of why people love K-Pop, and though maybe in the past years she hasn’t been tearing up the MelOn charts, she constantly refines her craft and I love to see it.

**vayyiqra** (7.529): Boa is the artist I knew least about before this rate and the only one I had definitely never heard before. After hearing these songs I thought she was my least favourite in the rate, but I did enjoy most of her songs, and I gave her a couple of 10s even, so I must like her.  In fact, she got a slightly higher average from me than Utada. :thinking: Also, now I finally understand the difference between BoA and Bôa, who are a British alt-rock band who did the theme to the anime *Serial Experiments Lain*, which is a good show and a great song but they have absolutely nothing to do with BoA the K-pop artist. (Though it would be funny if she covered that song like I'd get a big kick out of it.) Anyway, glad I did this rate! I discovered a lot of cool songs I wouldn't have otherwise heard and now I'm just using this space to say that so hi /u/Ghost-Quartet thanks for hosting it

**DilemmaofaHedgehog** (7.506): My Catholic Queen

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.471): i grew up on her music! she’s jesus where i live

**sage** (7.365): a lot of her older stuff has never really done anything for me (ive heard her entire discog) but she still has so many great singles

**SmileAndTears** (7.353): I said this in a comment already but she reminds me so much of Britney Spears.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.206): early songs are a rough patch but she has a lot of slays after that...was surprised she had my lowest average as i'm a kpoppie

**ivyleaf33** (7.000): the lack of masayume chasing physically hurts me, that shit was my childhood

**Apprehensive\_Guest** (6.953): She's good but feels less interesting than the other two

**fadedblue09** (6.824): Running through her discography is almost like taking a Kpop history lesson, you really can see the trends and changes of the genre in the last 2 decades. A lot of her early stuff feels like her talent is being sabotaged by some...questionable production choices but once it hits a certain period, it becomes serve after serve. Definitely the most inconsistent discog of the three, but still enjoyable nonetheless.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.412): if jolin was mostly highs for me and utada was mostly lows, boa in sitting nicely in the middle between them in terms of enjoyment. im big into electronic pop/hyperpop so i really enjoyed the run of songs from peace b to copy and paste but everything after that is very hit or miss to me bc of the difference of styles. still an enjoyable listening experience considering im not very big on kpop outside of a few songs.

Tr1skaid3kaphobia: Ugh I'm so sad this is over 😭😭. Doing this rate was a very last minute decision (I started working on it like two days before the deadline), but I'm so glad I did. I discovered so many amazing songs and it's all thanks to u/Ghost-Quartet. Thank you for being such an amazing host! This was such an fun rate and you made it even better.

Edit: Forgot to mention that this was also the first rate that I've participated in too which makes it even more special.

TiltControls: Thanks for the great hosting Ghost!!! The Jolin final out shitpost... I can't find words to describe how beautiful it was.

Anyways [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates!

#**Songs**

You know I was a little worried that Utada would sweep due to being slightly more talked about on the sub, so though they had some great songs I was cheering for - I'm definitely happy BoA came in with a win!

* Though this wasn't a full grab-bag, it did seem to neutralize the scores like one regardless. **One Shot, Two Shot** ends up on the lower end of the winner averages in the 9th lowest spot. In terms of its Winners Rate 3 competition it only outscored Concrete Angel and Time to Pretend. Overall it also places 519th across all songs

* It is also one of 8 songs to win with 2 or fewer 11's (Rolling in the Deep, Heartless, Love on Top, and Do I Wanna Know all also had 2; Party in the USA and Say My Name had 1; and Dancing Queen (infamously) had none)

* In its second rate, **Face My Fears** scored almost exactly like it did in VGV - with a 0.017 difference between each showing and near identical placement (44th and 46th)

#**Artists**

All 3 artists are added to the songlist! Utada's got 4 previous songs rated which affects their average a bit, but otherwise they all have similar to their average from this rate. Here's how they place on the overall rankings (also I think I'll keep doing placement comparisons here cause they're always pretty hilarious to compare)

* **BoA:** 70/278

 * Below: Mac Miller (69th), by 0.013

 * Above: Phoenix (71st), by 0.005

* **Utada:** 87/278

 * Below: Vince Staples (86th), by 0.003

 * Above: Lily Allen (88th), by 0.001

* **Jolin:** 111/278

 * Below: f(x) (110th), by 0.003

 * Above: The Killers (112th), by 0.010

Thanks again for the great rate Ghost!!!

Ghost-Quartet: Jolin 👏 Supremacy 👏

Ghost-Quartet: Well everyone, thanks for joining me! I initially proposed this rate almost as a joke but then the more I thought about it the more I came to love the idea, I was shocked when it was picked and I'm still floored by the positive reception it's gotten. 

This rate has consumed my life over the past two months, the past week in particular, but I don't regret any of the effort I put in. It was a bit messy and confused at times but at the end of the day we all had fun and that's what's important, plus we can all say we're a little bit more cultured now for having done this rate!

pleasegivemeasword: this is my favorite rate i've done! i had never heard of Jolin or Utada before (and finally listened to a BoA song that wasn't Amazing Kiss) and came out a fan of all three. my favorite thing about rates are listening to new music, and i probably wouldn't have heard any of these great songs without it. thank you for such a great rate!

saviorARMY101: Well I had a lot of fun doing this rate! Though I’m still salty about my 11 not winning, tbh there was a lot of great songs here so I think the win was deserved. I’m glad I was able to discover more music from these three incredible artists. Thank you for this rate!

kwcty6888: Thanks so much for hosting this rate with amazing commentary and shitposts! As a huge fan of all three for probably all around 12-13 years (though BoA's still my no.1) it was so fun to try to rate them all, but it was especially fun to see how people viewed their discography with fresh lens. I admit some of my ratings were definitely tinted by the nostalgia factor! Happy that more people go to check out music from the three legends :)
