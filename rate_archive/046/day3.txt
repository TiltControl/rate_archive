---

**Nerdy_boy_Chris** (10): This is fucking incredible, we have decided to stan forever.


**Raykel** (10): The first line alone is already euphoric

**rotating3Dtext** (10): makes me feel some type of way

**Saucymac** (10): Louis and Liam needs to hurry the fuck up and release their flop albums so i can give this song the 11 it deserves

**sn0wgaryen** (10): This song was the perfect way for Harry to show how different his personal style is compared to 1D, yet still sounds completely like him and like something he would do.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song's been used in enough sad media that I almost instinctually cry when hear it. It's perfect, but it's also approaching Amazing Grace territory where I almost don't want to hear it outside a funeral. I'd give it an eleven if it wasn't a bonus song.

**strawberryswing1** (10): a BAD lead single but great song that y'all will pay dust i'm sure

**twat\_brained** (10): This song never fails to amaze me just because of how towering and triumphant it makes me feel. Also Harry flying high in the video is super cool as well.

**Verdantshade** (10): it's probably my least favourite song on harry's debut but it's still better than any of the singles any of the boys have released solo (though miss you, it's you and still got time could compete with it). it's really the definition of an epic song - it's so good live and it's amazing how many fans it won harry with its change in direction

**jimmy345960** (9.7): A little long, but nice when I am in the mood

**1998tweety** (9.5): Probably the only song in this rate that /r/music actually likes.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): there's something so. beautiful and timeless about this. GREAT lead single.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I remember a time when I outright stanned this song because I thought Harry was cute. I no longer fangirl over it, but I still enjoy it for what it is; sure, it's nothing special if you listen to a wide variety of music, but in the context of today's pop landscape, the rock vibes are refreshing. Harry's vocals here are also excellent. It's easy to be overly critical of how original is, but maybe we should just let our nitpicks go and be optimistic for the guy's career.

**Roxieloxie** (9): I'm really shocked that I came around on this song. I wasn't a fan of this style of music but I love how thematic it feels. Also this song is peak Harry Styles, Cyrptid EditionTM

**therandomsinger13** (9): This so pretty. Everybody loves this song and so do I. Two Ghosts is Harry‚Äôs best though.

**dymokc** (8.5): i had an otherworldly orgasm the first time i heard this mr styles is really here to stay and slay

**Uber-A** (8.5): This song is stunning.

**hikkaru** (8): I like this for no other reason than the fact that a song like this was released in 2017 by an ex-boyband member and made the year-end list, I‚Äôm not even a big fan of rock ballads but it‚Äôs neat af

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): not bad for a debut single

**robbiec\_** (8): I don‚Äôt want to call this derivative because it does what it was intended to do really well and this was THE BEST solo debut of all of the 1D boys I love you Mr. Lawful Top Lane Stayer Styles

**surelychoo** (8): my throat hurts every time I hear this song because I think about Harry trying to sing it live

**poppinmmolly** (7): hot take but this is too long and was a terrible first single choice bye

**vayyiqra** (7): don't care about Harry or his incredible hair but this is alright

**janalng** (6.9): not what I wished for as Harry‚Äôs debut

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): I honestly feel like he takes himself a little too seriously here. I loved it the first time I heard it but it really died on me after a while

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.3): I‚Äôm not big on man pain. And this song feels so frivolous, I swear to god. I know it means more than that (there was a lot of speculation is that it‚Äôs about a death / diagnosis of someone close to Harry) but it comes across as utterly pretentious. I don‚Äôt want to be told to stop crying. I don‚Äôt want to accept anyway as being a sign of the times. Let me be, Harold.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): fuck this boring shit

**JanuraryFourteenth** (2): Goddamnit Harry you aren‚Äôt David Bowie you are Harry FUCKING STYLES DONT PRETEND YOU HAVE ARTISTRY

**kappyko** (1): I feel like I'll be asked to explain why I hate this. I swear on my life, I tried to really like this, but the falsetto passages disconcert me every time. While the story behind the song is moving in a way, I still remain entirely unimpressed by how melodramatic this is. Plus the fact that I was never interested in classic rock much... this feels disingenuous.

**prettylilsloths** (1): Not only does it go on for far too long (nearly 6 minutes was so unnecessary for this song) but I'd rather be listening to the David Bowie song he ripped off

---

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): I love that this is basically two different songs, and they both sound great

**rickikardashian** (8): I usually dislike when the verses and choruses of the song don‚Äôt seem to match, as if they were from different songs, but in here it‚Äôs very passable. The drums before the chorus creates a very nice anticipation that the chorus doesn‚Äôt let down. It is a pretty amazing song

---
#11:59PM 

**followingfreeways** (10): this song just makes me feel like everything is going to be ok

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): I‚Äôm gonna copy myself from my Pop Compass (which hasn‚Äôt been archived yet, go give mama her upvotes!!) (I am...,joking. please. i‚Äôm just a self-referential ho.) because I can‚Äôt put it any better than I did there. End of the Day is the grown up version of earlier 1D songs like Kiss You and Stole My Heart, and related in many ways to Happily. Upbeat and just plain fun, End of the Day contains one of my favourite 1D lyrics: ‚Äòjust me, her, and the moon‚Äô. In the second verse, Liam‚Äôs verse, a ridiculous scenario plays out: ‚ÄúShe said the night was over, I said it's forever / 20 minutes later, wound up in the hospital / The priest thinks it's the devil, my mum thinks it's the flu / But, girl, it's only you‚Äù. There‚Äôs something hilarious about a love so strong a mother thinks it‚Äôs the flu and a priest thinks is a devil, and it‚Äôs arguably the most fun song 1D made since their first two albums. It also carries an important lesson for all of us: ‚ÄúYou want what you want and you say what you say, and you follow your heart even though it'll break sometimes‚Äù.

**janalng** (10): what a bop, the drums are everything

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Louis‚Äô high note fucking scalped me, I want him to eat me tbh

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song is iconic for the fact that when it came out, all of us who were listening to 1D had figured out we were all gay. Like this song is an unofficial wlw anthem for the line "Just me here and the moon" I love it so much.

**surelychoo** (10): My lesbian anthem part 2. 'Just me, her, and the moon' first of all the way Harry sang that was perfect, secondly what kind of sapphic imagery, thirdly engrave this on my tombstone. Almost gave this song my 11, but there's that really weird transition from chorus to second verse that's just too sudden and jarring. At least give some drum beats like you did when you went from verse to chorus!

**prettylilsloths** (9.5): The lyrics paint such a vivid picture and it's one of my favourites on the album. The booming beat in the back almost forces you to bop your head along

**dymokc** (9): WHY HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE??? Love the chorus and tempo change <3

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Catchy verses with the clapping and music behind it.

**twat\_brained** (9): The lyrics don't make sense and the tempo change is disorienting but damn if this doesn't bang

**Verdantshade** (9): louis's high note makes up for the subpar lyrics and jarring chorus

**1998tweety** (8.5): I love the tempo switch into the chorus, serving West Coast.

**original\_doll** (8.5): I love this song but the verses and chorus kinda sound like two different songs mashed together...two great songs, but it's still a little weird

**poppinmmolly** (8.4): co-written by LunchMoney Lewis

**therandomsinger13** (8): I like the change between the verse. Reminds me of Giants by Lights. The lyrics are good. I actually truly like this one.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): it's a cute lil sing a long

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Songs full of clapping either really excite me or really annoy me, but somehow this puts me squarely in the middle. I do enjoy it, especially the lines, 'the priest thinks it's the devil/my mom thinks it's the flu', but overall it's one of the only songs on Made In The A.M I'd even consider skipping. Whether I'd actually skip it at the end of the day (heh) is another matter. And the chorus legitimately makes my heart warm sometimes, honestly.

**robbiec\_** (7.5): homophobia was defeated by that guitar

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): this song is funny to me

**Uber-A** (7.5): That chorus was super unexpected

**VeganSquash** (7.5): the verses are soooo disjointed from the chorus

**CarlieScion** (7): I like the non-Louis heavy songs the best

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): It kinda sounds like a better version of that Everything Has Changed song.

#12:00AM

**rotating3Dtext** (7): kinda forgettable

**strawberryswing1** (7): This song really annoys me. The first verse is absolutely PERFECT. It is so beautiful. Then for some reason they choose to juxtapose the cute, quiet verses with a shouty chorus???? I guess their thinking was "I'm shouting cuz I wanna shout to you how much I love you," but it just doesn't work. It sounds like two songs cut together and it makes me sad. A whole song like the quieter verses would be such an easy 10.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): feels like some of the musical transitions are a little abrupt

**Raykel** (6): This kinda sounds like last-era Big Time Rush

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Chorus moves so slow snails are passing it

**fifthchevron** (5): The switch up doesn't work, but "Just me, her and the moon" is such a lovely lyric.

**vayyiqra** (5): boring

**BearlyEvenAPun** (3.5): Twenty minutes later wound up in the hospital/The priest thinks it's the devil/My mum thinks it's the flu/But girl it's only you. Can I put up a nomination for 'Worst lyrical content in the rate'. Unless you're pulling a real life renactment of the ending of Romeo and Juliet it's a bit overdramatic. I actually quite like the rest of the lyrics in the song, but this part is just a bit too corny for my liking.

# "ping me when trash of the day is out" u/kappyko

**kappyko** (0): The chorus-verse transitions feel super weird. The lyrics are kind of immature and I really don't like the nursery rhyme chorus.

#can't get enough

**fifthchevron** (10): this shit go so hard, shoutout to niall's voice at 1:15 and liam's beatboxing throughout/screams at the end

**kappyko** (10): I'm glad I was proven wrong about how I was going to feel about this. Kind of amazing pop rock! it's a bit dopey considering how much it evokes "Don't Worry, Be Happy", but still

**Roxieloxie** (10): Do any of you guys remember when this song leaked way back before we even knew about the album and it sounded different and every one thought we were gonna get niall rapping. Fun times. Also Liam losing his shit towards the end of this song never fails to make me smile

**janalng** (9.2): you love it or you hate it

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): It's a little over the top and the No Excuses patented grunts are annoying but still I like this a lot

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Catchy, especially the weird noise the boys make throughout the song. Not particularly original in terms of lyrics. I feel like they‚Äôre something I‚Äôve heard before. But I love the instrumentation.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.5): OKAY DOES ANYONE REMEMBER THAT PIXAR SHORT WITH THE SNOWGLOBES AND SHIT???? THE SONG PLAYING DURING THAT SHORT IS THE INTRO OF NEVER ENOUGH AND THAT‚ÄôS WORTH AT LEAST AN EIGHT, LADS. But also Never Enough is just a good ass song. I‚Äôm bad at music criticism that isn‚Äôt related to Pitbull. Please leave me be.

**hikkaru** (8.5): finally a fun song on this album jeez

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): The folk influences on this album are in full force now, and Never Enough is a welcome return to the upbeat songs on this album that's perfectly place. I'm not sure what to do think about the shouting in the middle (it's so straight!) but the fiddle is perfect and the 'too much is never enough' refrain is amazing.

**PuggleMaster** (8.5): I like the band in the middle

**1998tweety** (8.1): I like the vibe of this song but I gotta take off points for the ‚Äúooha‚Äùs.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): A little weird but not bad

**prettylilsloths** (7.5): Liam's falsettos in this are probably the best part but it's a dance-y song anyway and very enjoyable

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Weird groans??? Ok...? Weird production. I like the chorus. This song really makes some unexpected choices. I was laughing by the end. ‚ÄúCOME ON!‚Äù

**dymokc** (7): tropical island?

**eklxtreme** (7): pretty fun track. the "come on" always reminded me of uprising by Muse.

**surelychoo** (7): ok I remember this was the first leak of the album when someone recorded it playing in a hallway and we were all like wtf is this new album going to be like...

**Uber-A** (7): Cute

**vayyiqra** (7): wow I'm sort of liking this who knew

# k enough

**Verdantshade** (7): it's been nearly 3 years and I'm still wondering what was going through niall's head when he wrote this

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): uneventful

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6.4): a little overbearing on the scream tbh

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5.5): What is with the backing track this is weird.

**VeganSquash** (5.5): it's missing something

**twat\_brained** (4): There's good cheesy and just plainly needless album tracks. I hate to say it but this is in the latter category.

**original\_doll** (10): 'how many nights would it take to count the stars, that's the time it would take to fix my heart' this is exactly how I felt after 1D went on hiatus :(

**sn0wgaryen** (10): Another really good love song. Perfectly paced and great songwriting, especially the ‚ÄúEyes can‚Äôt shine unless there‚Äôs something burning bright behind.‚Äù

**Verdantshade** (10): coldplay lite but still hella outstanding

**welcometoNY** (10): this is genuinely the most beautiful song but knowing popheads it will be paid dust

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): I still remember when the Radio 1 rehearsals footage leaked and Louis was practicing his part in Infinity and it was pretty much the best he‚Äôs ever sounded even though that‚Äôs the part of the song I don‚Äôt like. I love Niall‚Äôs verse, and I love the continuation of the theme (quiet devastation) from Perfect. That‚Äôs part of what makes MITAM such a good album, it‚Äôs so fucking cohesive.

**Roxieloxie** (9): FUCK YOU ZAYN. OT5 WAS REAL AND THRIVING AND YOU JUST FUCKING LEFT THEM OUT IN THE COLD MISSING YOU. IT'S BEEN 3 YEARS AND IM STILL MAD AT YOUR BITCH ASS

**janalng** (8.8): bet it‚Äôs great live

**dymokc** (8.5): one of the best songs on the album; love the pre-chorus A LOT

**twat\_brained** (8.4): **INFINIDEEEEEEEEH** I mean I see the humor in that but lbr nothing's ever gonna top "we took a chonce". +2 for the fantastic drum crash leading into the final chorus

**1998tweety** (8.2): I feel like the bridge into the last chorus could've gone a bit harder.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Another song that's just a little more pop than rock, Infinity is a classic song you'd expect to hear from a boyband-this does, in fact, feel like an updated version of their previous songs, although that's by no means a bad thing. While the 'infinnityy' part divides me-sometimes I think it's great, other times I think it's lacking-the song as a whole does a beautiful job with the imagery and does indeed make me imagine a night sky full of stars.

**surelychoo** (8): Not as bad as everyone said it was. I think it would have made a great single. They even filmed a music video? Where is it wtf??? 3 years into the hiatus and we're still left amidst deceit and broken promises.

**therandomsinger13** (7.7): Better than the others so far. Less repetitive and I like the production on the last chorus. Relaxing.

#thanos won

**prettylilsloths** (7.5): I love the lyrics of this song, especially the chorus but it does feel repetitive again with the chorus repeating taking up what feels like 80% of the song

**Raykel** (7): I wasn't feeling this to the bidge and last chorus. A pophead being a sucker for synths what's new?

**Uber-A** (7): cute I guess

**CarlieScion** (6): This song and Perfect could've been combined, bc they sure as hell sound exactly the same

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): It reminds of X&Y era Coldplay. I don't know if that's a good thing

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i could‚Äôve written this

**vayyiqra** (6): you know how /r/popheads says everything is generic, well this is generic

**fifthchevron** (5): There's nothing wrong with it but Louis is so underused and the vocal distribution is a bit boring.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): If this was on infinite loop, I‚Äôd want to die.

**kappyko** (5): This one kind of drags :( I like the synths coming in near the end though.

**robbiec\_** (2): ehYEHeYAHverything is weak

#me too

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): i wanna be gangbanged

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (9): A great album opener, and it won't leave my brain, which is great

**rickikardashian** (8): Total surprise for this song to be this high. When I first heard the song, although I liked it, I expected it to be a Day 2 song at best, especially because of how many other great songs 1D had, and how there were many other bops in the rest of the albums, I just could see it getting murdered by the sub (this was also my thought before realizing people really liked this album, and completely despised Fifth Harmony‚Äôs). I would have placed it a little lower, but it is nice to see that we can all appreciate songs that aren‚Äôt meant to be a slutdrop anthem.

---

#hey angel

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): All of the albums in this rate start out very strongly, but perhaps Hay Angel succeeds in doing its job even more than the other two do. From the surprising effective symbolism you often see in latter-day One Direction songs, to the intense, instrumental-filled production, you can tell upon hearing this track that Made In the A.M is going to be a heck of an album-at least for One Direction.

**poppinmmolly** (11): I think this is one of their best songs I love it so much it's a fantastic album opener.

**followingfreeways** (10): this song is extra as fuck and im here for it, SUCH a good opener, and the way harry sings "do you ever try to go to the other side" makes me die every time

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): does anyone here own a prostate massager?

**Roxieloxie** (10): I started off this rate talking about how I have to try my best not to give every song on this album a ten, and first song off the bat i'm failing. This song sounds like sunshine and i love it. Also Louis & Liam's duet in this song made me the person I am today.

**strawberryswing1** (10): such a good opener ugh,,,their minds

**Verdantshade** (10): louis's and liam's harmonies on the bridge?? like harry said, it's the clouds of mitam but it's even better

**eklxtreme** (9): I love that strong chorus and their fun, carefree vocals

**kappyko** (9): Wait this is actually a huge bop? I like those guitars.

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Great song to sing along to in a car. Simple lyrics. Beautiful vocalization. The bridge's more fast-paced delivery fits well with the rest of the song's more slower pace.

**surelychoo** (9): An amazing opener that showcases all of their voices really well and really gets you into the rock-pop-y mood of the rest of the album.

**VeganSquash** (9): this is not what I was expecting, I am surprised

**welcometoNY** (9): not gonna lie I kind of hated this the first few times I listened to it but then I realized it's epic and I was just wrong

**PuggleMaster** (8.5): Kind of repetitive but it sounds good

**1998tweety** (8.1): I'm conflicted with this song cause I think its a really good song for an intro but it's also pretty long and drags a bit.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): What kind of throws me off about this one is that it doesn't exactly *sound* like One Direction, and it shows listeners that it's not the same One Direction from previous albums, regardless of Zayn's absence.

**dymokc** (7.5): okay i have to admit i slept on 1D before this thread. this is a great opener

**Uber-A** (7.5): pretty beautiful!

**janalng** (7.2): solid start into the album

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Vocals are a little high for me but impressed with the production

**vayyiqra** (7): can't believe I'm listening to 1D of my free will but this just sounds like 90s Britpop?? not as bad as I feared idk

#hey demon

**robbiec\_** (7): sounds like a Robbie Williams song

**therandomsinger13** (6.5): It‚Äôs alright. Kinda basic. Production‚Äôs good. Very repetitive. Too long. It could have stopped at 3 minutes.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): something about the production sounds very off

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): I actually hate the way MITAM starts. I maintain that there‚Äôs not very much filler, but Hey Angel feels like filler to me, it‚Äôs a very empty-feeling song, and very, VERY Coldplay-esque (/u/strawberryswing1 thoughts?). In my perfect album reorder End of the Day is the opener and AM is (still) the closer, because this is a weak start that is mercifully immediately forgotten by the SUBLIME Drag Me Down.

**fifthchevron** (4): The first official lyrics we ever got from the album were Harry incessantly tweeting these ones. We all thought we were in for an ethereal power ballad and got...a stale Robbie Williams b-side instead. Only gets good with Liam's verse/vocal energy ("I come alive when I hear your voice/It's a beautiful sound/It's a beautiful noise" - a Lyric!). Also a fan of "SIIIIDE" from Harry at 1:48.

**prettylilsloths** (4): I like the concept of the song but it comes across as the lyrics being drowned out by the music in the background as well as being short on lyrics so being pretty repetitive. I do love the lyric 'Tell me, do you ever cry / When we waste away our lives?'

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): Man, they truly know how to nail those hooks, huh?

**rickikardashian** (10): Little Mix decided to go out with a bang with their last single with their most bombastic song. This was one of those times they decided a male feature would be necessary to make the song succeed ~~although we know it never is~~. This is kind of what I would call a Girlband Bop‚Ñ¢, because is just energetic, with every member having a moment to sing, and talking about their friends and boys, and I love it. This is the kind of stuff the Spice Girls would be singing if they were a thing now.

#16 inches real Brazilian hair, soft lace front cap

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (11): I didn't know if this was the regular one or the Sean Paul remix. It doesn't matter because both are amazing and both deserve 11s don't deny them you plebs

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): I LOVE HAIR SO MUCH. There is NO heterosexual explanation for the music video (LEIGH ANNE WOULD NEVER DATE MUCH LESS BE DUMPED SEAN PAUL, THAT‚ÄôS FALSE). I love how it takes a lot of tropes (wash that man out of your hair gals!!) and the ad libs make this song so fun (uh hum!!). I love a good upbeat girl song, it radiates the feeling I have when I‚Äôm with my girls. Around minute two, when the da da da dahs come in, ugh, I love it. And as if this song wasn‚Äôt perfect enough, the girls look so adorable dancing in the MV.... my wlw heart LOVES THIS SHIT. Have I mentioned I am gay yet.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Lady Gaga is shook

**poppinmmolly** (10): I actually like the Sean Paul version too

**VeganSquash** (10): wow this is a bop, but why did they censor "dick"? I mean, most of us here get dick, let's celebrate it not hide it.

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Okay so I know we like to talk about how all of little mix's male features are terrible... but this one really works with it. This would've been a ten but I like the Sean Paul version more

**1998tweety** (9.7): I actually prefer the remix version of this song cause I feel like Sean Paul fits in at parts where the song is a little lacking, but the solo version is still a huge bop. The frequent line switch ups remind me of kpop songs.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.6): disgusteng

**robbiec\_** (9.5): parts of this instrumental reminds me of Courtship by Bjork and if you know me that‚Äôs a good thing anyway BOP

**dymokc** (9): Kept going back to this music video unconsciously. Then I watched more of their videos and fell in love. This is such a fun empowering song.

**followingfreeways** (9): this song took a long time to grow on me but once it did, there was literally no going back. it's kind of dumb but also so relatable??? how many times did my dramatic ass chop my hair off or dye it from 12-18 because of a boy?? too many times.

**kappyko** (9): Oh WEW their minds!!! My wig!!! Disappeared!!

**sn0wgaryen** (9): BOP.

**therandomsinger13** (9): YES. Screw that guy. The ching censor is pretty funny. I feel like this early draft of New Rules. Also I love the video.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): i can only think of that pic of jesy with her hair flying in the air

**original\_doll** (8): didn't realize there was a version of this w/out Sean Paul. nice.

**Uber-A** (8): An excellent, fun bop!

**vayyiqra** (8): this is so fun and quirky wtf I love Little Mix now

**janalng** (7): the bridge is the best part of the song

**twat\_brained** (7): well I guess it's better that it's just them and not the Sean paul version

#bald 

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): that beat is driving me crazy

**fifthchevron** (6): Does "This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things" remind anyone of this song?

**static\_int\_husp** (6): The song is pretty average but the pre-chorus is annoying

**JanuraryFourteenth** (4): God they‚Äôre way too proud of that awful analogy

#free the dick

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): If you want to look for a track on Get Weird that's full of the crazy energy that all girl groups need, look no further; this is the song you've been waiting for. The production is a little messy in some places, and I'm not sure how to feel about the censoring, but otherwise this is an absolute delight; and, before anyone asks, I'd say it's on the same quality with Gaga's song on of the same title.

**surelychoo** (8): A jam! Honestly really fits the post-breakup girls' night out vibe. I find it funny that with the nasty subject matters on this album they still have to ding out the 'dick' lyric.

**welcometoNY** (8): okay I love this song but why even include the word dick if you're just gonna censor it. also I love them but the part at the end is low-key so cringey. still a cute bop.

**prettylilsloths** (7): I remember blasting this out of my speakers whenever it came on the radio, insanely catchy but only 7 because they don't actually say dick and I'm still bitter

#why would you say something so controversial yet so brave ^(~~and so wrong~~)

**Raykel** (3): Oh yall love this despite the uUuh in the background but disrespect The Light Is Coming for the highly catchy "you wouldn't let anybody speak and inSTEAD!" Get your priorities together.

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): ~~I'm not crying, you're crying~~ Ok so this was honestly the perfect farewell single, and they better give us that last album so we can actually say goodbye the correct way

**rickikardashian** (10): Opening the Top 10, the most bitter-sweet way to end the journey of a band like One Direction ~~and the album, if you're listening to the regular version~~. This is one of those songs that could be applied to every ‚Äúend of the story‚Äù celebration which is why a lot of people can relate to it in different context. I still can‚Äôt the see music video because I get too sentimental, because these guys were part of my early teens, so I guess they come with a lot emotion attached to them.

#the greatest team that the world has ever seen
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): WOW I love this a lot. It's a very nice piece man great guitars and a sing-along chorus.

**eklxtreme** (10): such a beautiful and thoughtful song when you realize it's a love letter to the fans

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A beautiful send off of One Direction :'(

**robbiec\_** (10): this song sounds like a hybrid of football stadium chanting, arena rocking Britpop and I just love this song even though I wish it was just Harry and ‚Äúlive forever‚Äù is a shit chorus climax and I dislike Louis‚Äô bridge

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): ah this one‚Äôs good

**sn0wgaryen** (10): Another song with great instrumentation. This song really shows how they‚Äôve grown musically. This song gets me emotional knowing that this was also their last performance together. ‚ÄúThis is not the end,‚Äù SO WHEN ARE YOU COMING BACK?

**VeganSquash** (10): great singles, but meh, this album has got hella filler don't @ me

**welcometoNY** (10): what an epic way to end an amazing career

**twat\_brained** (9.3): This was the perfect choice for a sendoff single before their hiatus. "This is not the end" and so long as Directioners are out here hyping up One Direction on Twitter and supporting the hell out of their solo careers, the band and us loyal fans will indeed live forever in music history.?

**janalng** (9): I am a fan of the clapping

**Roxieloxie** (9): This song is equal parts "Fuck you zayn we had it all" and a thank you letter to the fans. I wish i could talk about this song but im to busy crying again.

**surelychoo** (9): It has the same feeling of blaring vocals that Hey Angel has, but sung in a more celebratory, chanting, at a bar at the end of the day (ha) kind of way. I'm going to believe "this is not the end" forever...

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): this video makes me so emo also this is really fun to harmonize with

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): wow I had forgotten about this song. it's fine!

**followingfreeways** (8): stop I know I m trash for not giving this a 10 since this is their goodbye song kind of or whatever but honestly this song is jut alright..the music video makes me emo as hell tho

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): A bit overrated, honestly-it's a nice combination of all the sounds on this album, but the song's structure is not to my immediate liking. It is, however, a great ending to the standard edition of the album, as well as perhaps their career as a band as a whole. So, yes, I give permission for everyone to raise their tissues.

**Uber-A** (8): Love the chorus

**dymokc** (7.5): would def replay this

**prettylilsloths** (7.5): This was really the perfect song for them to bow out on since it fit the situation so well. It's also vague enough though that it could apply to a relationship or even Zayn leaving the band. So even though it's slightly bland it fits

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Chorus is nice to sing along to. I like the bridge.

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): Ah. This is another Pixar song. Let‚Äôs be real. It‚Äôs their ‚Äòyou‚Äôve got a friend in me‚Äô. N u kno what? I luv it.

#what the fuck do you even do with a history degree?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.5): the buildup could‚Äôve lead to something bigger

**Verdantshade** (9): unpopular opinion: this is one of the weaker songs on mitam. the sentiment is beautiful and all but it's a very underwhelming song (I do have a soft spot for louis's bridge though)

**1998tweety** (8.5): So I know that this song is pretty important considering its the last single 1D put out before they went on hiatus but honestly I've never really been a fan of the chorus. The bridge is great though.

**selegend** (7): it should be ‚Äúyou and i got a whole lot of history‚Äù

**vayyiqra** (6): idk idc this album is wearing out its welcome hard by now

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): Too many layered voices please stop

**kappyko** (5): Not really that catchy? It has a nice chorus aspect but I don't really like this. Kind of weak single material

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): Maybe they snapped y'all

**rickikardashian** (10): Hidden Gem of this album. I always find confusing when songs that are easily in the best songs of the album are put in the deluxe versions of it. Temporary Fix is one of those songs that captivated me since the first time I heard, not only did I really like it, but I couldn‚Äôt get it out of my head. I‚Äôm really glad most people gave this song the respect and love it deserved, because 1D sure never fucking did CONSIDERING THEY NEVER EVEN SANG IT ON TOUR. Also, from this album I've noticed, these guys would be terrible boyfriends, but an amazing one night stand.

---

#FIXED!

**Darkra01** (11): we stan a thinly veiled song about one night stand hookups

**Saucymac** (11): sorry Olivia fans

**fifthchevron** (10): It's all about Harry getting an ENTIRE second verse to himself then Louis annihilating that bridge. Also "You look like the kind of girl that's tired of speaking" - Niall just gets me.

**followingfreeways** (10): fuck me UP NIALL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! NIALLS VOICE WAS MADE FOR THIS SEXY BOP!!!!

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): I‚ÄôLL BE YOUR TEMPORARY FIX YOU CONTROL ME EVEN IF IT‚ÄôS JUST TONIGHT (YEAH YEAH YEAH) Theory: every song Niall is prominent on is a good fucking song. Harry‚Äôs verse is just so fun too.

**janalng** (10): just a very very sexy song (let me touch you where your heart is cough)

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a mega bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): is this AJR

**strawberryswing1** (10): overlooked pop perfection!!!

**surelychoo** (10): I couldn't believe Niall had written this because his previous attempt was Don't Forget Where You Belong??? I love the rhythm to the "i'll be your temporary fix" because it's like it's pushing you forward, and that's the energy of this entire song! And omg wow the bridge. Probably the sexiest thing they've ever done.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): love the 2000s pop rock influences on this

**sn0wgaryen** (9): This whole song is so sing-along-worthy. I love when their choruses have this specific sound with their voices, a sound I don‚Äôt really know how to word.

**1998tweety** (8.9): I like this one too.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is truly a deluxe cut that would fit anywhere else on the album, which is yet another rare occurrence, and by some coincidence it's also the song that's most obviously influenced by rock and punk. It's a bit derivative if you take a closer look, but damn if this doesn't get you shaking.

**VeganSquash** (8.5): a mini bop

**dymokc** (8): whatttt a pop punk song from 1D?! I liveeee they should do this more

**ImADudeDuh** (8): lets go upbeat bop!

**PuggleMaster** (8): this reminds me of the i'm gonna get you one way or another song

**therandomsinger13** (7.7): Fun. I like the instrumentation.

#still broken

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): I like the fast tempo but the verses are a little annoying

**vayyiqra** (7): the fuck is this, pop-punk

**kappyko** (5.5): It's nice rock, but kind of pales in comparison to the other rock songs!

**Uber-A** (5): Kinda generic

**prettylilsloths** (4): Doesn't really have any personality to me and the backing music drowns out the lyrics too much

#buy no control on itunes

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is No control pt.2 Niall Edition Extra .6 points for getting harry to sing fast again, it's no over again but i'll take it

**Verdantshade** (10): no control who? who knew niall could write something so sexy. I remember debating with my friend when we first heard the song if the lyric was 'let me touch you where your heart is' or 'where you're hottest'. an absolute banger

**twat\_brained** (8.4): It's rather evident r/therewasanattempt to remake No Control. When you're One Direction, though, it's hard to go wrong with a good pop rock tune filled with crashing drums and gnashing guitars. Wait I don't even know why I'm overthinking this it's clearly a revised draft of "Sex On Fire" by Kings of Leon.

**original\_doll** (8): fun song, but it can't top No Control

#ROBBIE WHY

# **robbiec\_** (4.8): I want to get high and fucked by Harry Styles on a yacht as a temporary fix for my longing for [redacted] and my self-esteem issues and insecurities. Speaking of Harry he sounds almost exactly like George Ezra here

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): The hidden gem of the rate for me. I love the '60s Beatles influence that basically turns into Pure Imagination in the bridge. And i love the prechorus so fucking much.

**rickikardashian** (9.5):  Fun fact: The members of 1D have explained that ‚ÄúOlivia‚Äù isn‚Äôt really about an specific girl, it‚Äôs about *A N Y T H I N G*, it could be your family, a hometown, it could even be about you!, so don‚Äôt lose hope and get mad at whoever Olivia is, because just like the rest of every One Direction song, this is about anyone so you can fantasize they're singing to you and you can spend all your money thinking maybe one day Harry will love you \*wink* ^jk

---

#  I love you, I love you, I love, I love, I love Olivia

**Roxieloxie** (11): I debated for so long what song I was gonna give my 11 to and until the last second it was end of the day. This song is also gay culture. Its a gay willy wonka fever dream. It's so beautiful, It makes me want to be in a field of flowers with my future wife while we dance like we're in a hollywood montage. Literal tears are falling out of my eyes as i type this . it's just so fucking beautiful

**welcometoNY** (11): The bridge is genuinely one of the most beautiful musical moments I‚Äôve ever experienced it‚Äôs truly a blessing

**fifthchevron** (10): A song only Harry Styles could've written.

**followingfreeways** (10): one of the best bridges of one directions discography

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): Olivia contains some of Harry Styles‚Äô most brilliant songwriting ‚Äî ‚ÄúThis isn‚Äôt the stain of a red wine / I‚Äôm bleeding love‚Äù, and ‚ÄúThe summertime and butterflies / All belong to your creation‚Äù ‚Äî and also served as foreshadowing as what he would do as a solo artist. This is Harry Styles on some 1989 Taylor Swift shit, particularly in this line of the chorus: ‚ÄúI‚Äôve been analysing the light in your eyes, Olivia‚Äù. In general, the chorus is infectious, manufactured for screaming along to the way Shake It Off was. Also, thank you god for Niall Horan.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the children's book outpeaked but still a bop

**kappyko** (10): Kind of cutesy old school rock, very '60s? The strings are wicked

**poppinmmolly** (10): I was debating giving this my 11 it's so good, so sweet. Reminds me of The Beatles :)

**surelychoo** (10): can't believe people think this is about TS's cat lmao what kind of delusion it's obviously wordplay... anyways I almost gave this my 11. It had real strings and real brass and real chorus vocals, and was recorded at Abbey Road, and has a Willy Wonka fever dream of a bridge sung by Harry's smooth vocals, followed by a glorious ending chorus with Louis' amazing gritty tone.

**Verdantshade** (10): an album highlight. the best use of strings and horns in a 1d song ever, and 'the summertime and butterflies all belong to your creation' is probably my favourite lyric harry has written. the song literally shines pure happiness and love

**janalng** (9.1): I‚Äôve been idolzing the light in your eyes Olivia!

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I know Galway Girl is the one song from Divide popheads likes, and if Ed Sheeran didn't listen to this song before writing it, I'd eat an Oreo without dunking it first. It's so rarely nowadays for an explicitly heterosexual love song to impress me, but Olivia is near-perfect in terms of execution. How do I know this? I hummed the chorus all day long.

**dymokc** (8): can see this song being in an ad or sth

**eklxtreme** (8): it's a sweet and cute song

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): OH WOW THEY MENTION A SPECIFIC GIRL THIS TIME...i think, i can‚Äôt really tell.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): Nice song.

**vayyiqra** (8): mainly because every girl I've ever known called Olivia was a looker tbh

**1998tweety** (7.9): I was expecting a different type of song based on the title.

**therandomsinger13** (7.8): You better not let him go, Olivia. This kinda reminds me of Panic! At the Disco‚Äôs Pretty. Odd.????

**robbiec\_** (7.4): bop but I forgot to pay attention because I‚Äôm planning my graduation/party

**Raykel** (7.2): Oof niall struggled at that Olivia. But this was cute. Gave me beatle vibes.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): The prechorus soup of Harry saying 'I love you Olivia' drags this down (lol) from a 9 or 10

**rotating3Dtext** (7): good instrumental

**Uber-A** (7): well that was cute

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): I love Liam‚Äôs lower register

#fuck you olivia

**twat\_brained** (6.4): Fun fact: my sister's name is Olivia and I think I sent a snapchat of me singing this to her for her birthday lol. Also I bet some superfan of Scandal has probably made a fan edit of this bc why not. The song itself is kinda cheesy and I find myself skipping it when I shuffle 1D

**CarlieScion** (6): This feels so random

**VeganSquash** (6): This is the part of the album I started getting bored. It's starting to sound so similar to each-other. Anyway, the bridge was AMAZING, like omg, but the rest of the song is boring.

**prettylilsloths** (3): I've never got the love for this song? It's really never stood out to me that much and I pretty frequently skip it :/

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): I was so worried that 1D wouldn't be good without Zayn, and I'm so glad they proved me wrong. This is a straight-up banger.

**rickikardashian** (10): The first statement the world would get from 1D after *He Who Shall Not Be Named* left the band. The band needed a strong comeback, to show the world who they were when someone was missing, and boy, did they deliver. The song went #1 in the UK ~~and a bunch of other countries~~, and it debuted #3 on BB100, giving One Direction another top 5 hit. The song is at #7 in this rate, but the impact it had on the public was immediate and it showed how powerful 1D was even in their latest moments.

---

#standing tall

**twat\_brained** (11): Timeless, classic, iconic, all the superlatives. I remember Twitter being shook as HELL the day it came out, and being even shook-ER when I heard Harold Styles' euphoric high note not ONCE, but TWICE live on the On The Road Again Tour. I don't know when or if I'm ever gonna feel the same love for an artist/band as I do with One Direction.

**1998tweety** (10): This bops hard. I'm pretty sure the verse just repeats itself, which I took points off for on a 5H song, but unlike the 5H this song bops hard.

**eklxtreme** (10): I was snatched when I first heard this and I still am. the instrumentation and those harmonies are crazy good.

**fifthchevron** (10): People like to pretend 1D fizzled out after Zayn left but they actually kept touring for like 7 more months, sold more concert tickets than Taylor, and dropped this song - which broke Spotify's streaming record, was the second highest US debut that year, and was #1 in twelve countries. I think this song is the biggest fuck you to everyone who wrote them off as a typical boy band. They're not. This song is their evidence.

**followingfreeways** (10): one of their most iconic singles ever honestly

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): I knew coming into this rate that Drag Me Down or What a Feeling would get my 11 (so now you know what does get my 11!) and if there‚Äôs any justice either of those songs will steal. (Or both.) I don‚Äôt even know how to begin to encapsulate how I feel about Drag Me Down. Sonically, production wise, vocally, it‚Äôs absolutely gorgeous, and I mentioned in my Pop Compass that Harry‚Äôs pronunciation of the song‚Äôs first verse is sublime in the ‚Äòotherworldly sense). It‚Äôs lyrically minimalist, but also heart-wrenching, because... it‚Äôs a feeling I carry about many people in my life, people I am actually crying thinking about right now. I also love ‚Äòfire for a heart / not scared of the dark / you‚Äôve never seen it look so easy‚Äô because, and I know this is cliche, but I feel these lyrics so, so deeply. They‚Äôre, to me, a reminder of things I have survived and that I will continue surviving on a daily basis.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): they SNAPPED

**janalng** (10): awesome song with an outstanding Niall Horan in the chorus

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): BEST 1D SONG

**surelychoo** (10): Best single decision ever, thanks @label for once. It's a bit repetitive but the repetition works because the formula is just so good. I also like that in this song (and also in the rest of the album) they've paired up Harry+Louis vocals and Liam+Niall vocals, because the tones for the two pairings complement each other so well.

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): I know any chance I get I talk about how bad 1d's singles are. This was one of the best single choices they ever made.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Night Changes was already the unofficial crooner of the spring in early 2015, but as somebody who was barely a teenager around this period I remember Drag Me Down's release being the exact point where people were unashamed to tell others like they liked One Direction. And there's a reason for that. This is a great song. It has an energetic, roaring and borderline pop rock composition that would soon prove to be a rarity in the increasingly depressing pop landscape, and the claps in the chorus really strengthen the song as a whole. This is an overused phrase, but Drag Me Down is absolutely a bop from start to finish and I will not let anybody else tell me otherwise.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): why do I like this song so much lmao

**sn0wgaryen** (9): This was a great way to introduce the new era. I think it was a good move to make a ‚Äúbreakdown‚Äù bit with an electric guitar rather than synthesizers or something.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): i feel like i only liked this because it was 1d

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Deserved to be their first number one in America not a number three debut smh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): apparently, this was a single? A little underwhelming tbh. The prechorus hypes you up, and then once the chorus drops, you‚Äôre back to being flaccid

**prettylilsloths** (8): Reminds me of Girl Almighty in that a lot of the lyrics make absolutely no sense but it's still a catchy ass bop. Louis sounds very shouty on the chorus.

**Uber-A** (7.5): This song is really good but Liam and Louis‚Äô vocals are really dull

**robbiec\_** (7.3): I hate the pre-chorus and not because of my hatred of Liam as a musician not a person but this is a great pop song and I wish One Direction did the 5H stage-pull stunt with a Zayn look alike TBH

**dymokc** (7): love when it picks up

#draggedt

**kappyko** (7): Okay, I'm sorry 1D stans, but I did not like this when it was bashed into my head for the years after it was released! It kinda bangs but it does feel a bit fodder-ish? It's not my thing. Anthemic pop rock sounds edges a bit too close to Imagine Dragons with the "oh-woah-oh"s. But it bops!

**therandomsinger13** (7): Ha ha I remember this playing at my school dance and me (Hater of One Direction for no reason whatsoever) running out screaming no or something. This feels like a meme. Again, repetitive. Not as bad as the last one. Catchy.

**vayyiqra** (7): tbh I hate that this is tolerable

**VeganSquash** (7): oooh, I didn't know they sang this. The chorus is catchy but the verses are a letdown.

**Verdantshade** (7): while a great single in the wake of zayn's departure, it's repetitiveness can't be justified (it's no mr brightside) and it feels like it doesn't belong on the album

**Raykel** (6): The best part of this song is the pre chorus and of course it's ruined by Liam's singing

**welcometoNY** (6): it's a nice message I guess but the song just doesn't really work

**BearlyEvenAPun** (2): I'm not sure what I don't like about this song. Back when I first heard it I liked it and listened a few times, but now it's one of my least favourite tracks from them. It's not like I hate any parts, I just have trouble finding things to like about the song.

deleted: Honestly, I don't understand the low placement for this score. It's not only one of the most influential songs of the last 10 years, but also better than almost every other flop in this rate. In fact, I didn't give it my 11 because I was scared that this track was so talented that it would surge to the top regardless, and I wanted to give every other track an advantage. Not even making it into top 5? This must be a cruel joke. /r/popheads has failed me many times before but today is the last straw. I have contacted /u/kappyko directly and we have decided to shut down /r/popheads. This slander for good music has gone on for far too long and has been far too damaging to the pop world climate. I'm scared of what will happen if a populace with this bad of taste is able to congregate and thrive as community and frankly, I can't have this go on any longer.

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): AN ALBUM OPENER. They truly fucking snapped here. And that sax is killer

**rickikardashian** (10): The highest Fifth Harmony gets in this rate, just one spot away and 0.044 points from getting to the top 5. People love female empowerment and catchy hooks, so it‚Äôs no surprise this did fairly well most of the rate. Sadly, with this song, 5H is completely out, so don‚Äôt forget to stream Camila‚Äôs Self-titled and whatever the other 4 will release by the time the rate is over.

#YOU GO GIRL!!!

**PuggleMaster** (11): My favorite 5h song and no other song in this rate reaches the quality from this. A PURE BOP. Oh and the version without Camila is lowkey better :skull:

**VeganSquash** (11): I LOVE this song SO MUCH like OMG

**1998tweety** (10): This is a huge bop, a FEMINIST ANTHEM, that deserved to smash and have as much success as WFH.

**followingfreeways** (10): I gave pretty much this entire album 7's because none of it stands out at all except this song is such a good song, it totally deserves a 10, I appreciate this song when it comes on my workout playlist :0)

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): This is 5H doing Jason Derulo better than Jason Derulo. Admit it. One of my favourite things about this song is that it‚Äôs pretty much the song that plays in my head when I watch my girls killing it. It‚Äôs also me giving advice to them. There is no heterosexual explanation for it, and god, what a STRONG opener. I love it.

**hikkaru** (10): LOVE the sax farts, Run Away With Me is shaking

**ImADudeDuh** (10): clapemoji FEMINIST clapemoji ANTHEM clapemoji !

**kappyko** (10): I STAND BY THE FACT THIS SONG WAS ROBBED BY THE CHARTS I was shocked to find out this was a flop because it's honestly so FUN! It isn't really too similar to "Worth It", it's just a really sassy and in-your-face bop that's good fun.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): someone took away Cantina‚Äôs adlibs probably as shade since it was released when she left this group, but I still lowkey prefer the original one with her

**poppinmmolly** (10): a booooop

**robbiec\_** (10): the first time I heard this song was actually another X Factor UK contestant singing it and although she got eliminated I thought it was a bang and wow it is girls x

**Roxieloxie** (10): A surprisingly strong start. Wow ,I was not expecting this at all?!? Dare I say, wig snatched????

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): invented feminism

**strawberryswing1** (10): such a good song to get you pumped up to!!

**Uber-A** (10): A BOP!!!!! Maybe they snapped.

**vayyiqra** (10): AIN'T NOTHIN' AIN'T NOTHIN' ALL MAH LADIES ALL AROUND THE WORLD

**dymokc** (9.5): THIS IS A MEGABOP SUCH AN EMPOWERING TRACK YOU JUST WANNA STRUT DOWN THE STREETS LISTENING TO

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): THATS MY GIRLLLLLLLLL

**janalng** (8.8): verses are stronger than the chorus but great beat

**eklxtreme** (8.5): this is straight up a banger, love that hard bass

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): The worst thing about this song is easily that saxophone. There's always some sort of obnoxious saxophone or trumpet in Fifth Harmony's songs that sounds more like a dying goat that an instrument. Now that I've got that off my chest, though, I can easily admit; this song is good. I liked it from the first time I listened to it on the radio, and it has a sassiness which a lot of girl power anthems don't nowadays. The 'Destiny said it' line is also very cute, although, sadly, it didn't prove to be a passing of the torch moment.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I like the brassy intro and the chorus is pretty good as well.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): I love girl power songs.

**therandomsinger13** (8): Bop! Very danceable. I can‚Äôt help but imagine the girls‚Äô sexy moves.

#feminism isn't necessary nowadays

**twat\_brained** (7.8): The saxophone did not work the second time around but I'm still somewhat fond of this song. Not a top 5 5H song though; and I'm not sure why this was the first song on the album, let alone released as a single and kept over Voicemail.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): I feel like i should hate this, but I don't

**surelychoo** (7): Reminds me of a Beyonce song but I can't place it. I really like the chorus, but it sounds really autotuned? Is that the effect they're going for?

**prettylilsloths** (6): The beat is a bit too much at times but it's still catchy. I like the harmonizing between Lauren and Camila on the pre chorus and also the build to the post chorus bit

Nerdy_boy_chris: # 7/27

---

**Overall average**: 6.822

---

**Nerdy_boy_chris**: I was pleasantly surprised by 5H this rate, I was not expecting to like them as much as I did

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a really great album for what it is. Personally I like the trop pop wave, I think it sounds really fresh and fun and isn't nearly ubiquitous enough to be inherently tired. The production and melodies are very polished and fun, and I've always loved the distinctness of the 5H girls' voices. My only complaint is that most of the songs are lacking that (excuse me) X factor to push them from the 7-8 range into the 9-10 range. There's definitely improvement to be made but I still like this album a lot. [Grade: B+]

**sn0wgaryen**: Better towards the end!

**robbiec\_**: 9.1 where there is filler there is serviceable/good filler and some of the best fucking bops this decade. Obviously we know what happened after this album but I think it says a lot about professionalism or even just pop star potential the girls have (especially Camila and Normani) that this album works really well as the sum of its parts (although I‚Äôd argue Little Mix‚Äôs harmonies and performances are as tight as me and my money) AND MOST IMPORTANTLY IT BOPSSSSS

**Verdantshade**: ngl I was expecting really bad r&b pop going into this, and it was nowhere near as bad as I though. it's nearly entirely forgettable generic dance pop

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: i‚Äôm tired of the 5H circlejerk. this is actually a fucking solid album y‚Äôall just hating on these women for whatever reason

**letsallpoo**: camila won

**SendMeYourSATScores**: reflection is better. anyway i had to say ‚Äúinvented [insert whatever] because i thought it would be mean to drag camila‚Äôs vocals in every song

**strawberryswing1**: how the fuck did my average for this album manage to be 7.2 i wasn't even trying to do that on purpose ugh my MIND

**patronsaintofaspies**: You know that generic phase in professional music reviews? 'This will excite fans of <insert artist name here>, but will fail to impress anyone else'. I wouldn't be as harsh, but I do think this applies to this album; your ability to enjoy it is dependent on your enjoyment of Fifth Harmony, and, unfortunately, a lot of people don't enjoy them for a variety of legitimate reasons. I thought it was cute, and I ended up liking it a lot better than I thought I would, although I'm not really a fan of the way they work as a group.

**kappyko**: this record is a little boring, but some choice album tracks are absolute fun.

**gowestyoungkanye**: I‚Äôll fuckin say it. 5H deserved better. I hadn‚Äôt listened to this album all the way through before the rate, but several songs from it found their way into my library.

**twat\_brained**: Voicemail is not in the rate but it gets a 10 from me anyway because BITCH GIVING IT ANYTHING LESS THAN A 10 IS BLASPHEMOUS. Also lol @ 17-year-old me being headass and preordering the entire goddamn album from iTunes who allowed me to do this

**dymokc** (10): KNEW THIS WOULD BE A FUCKING HIT WHEN IT FIRST CAME OUT AND I WAS RIGHT. PROBABLY MY TOP 5 MOST PLAYED SONG IN HISTORY

**hikkaru** (10): anyone who says this song would be better without Young Thug is WRONG

**janalng** (10): we all know this is one of the biggest bops

**kappyko** (10): about to win two rates in a row omg

**robbiec\_** (10): isn‚Äôt it?

**twat\_brained** (10): Pharrell's production here is flawless and while I wasn't big on Thugger's verse, it's grown on me with every repeated listen of this song. And I get a LOT of repeated listens whenever I turn on the radio. Not that I'm complaining; Havana is the defining song of Camila's debut solo era but hopefully not her career, there's far more potential to be tapped into. Also the last truly great Hot 100 #1 of our time.

**Verdantshade** (10): I thought all of camila's previous songs were awful, including OMG, but havana was amazing out of nowhere. young thug's feature is also a necessary part of the song

**1998tweety** (9.4): This first time I heard this song was at work, I listened to it once followed by OMG and then went back to Havana for like 20 listens. I'm so glad this blew up.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): Young Thug makes the song so much worse

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): One of the most iconic songs of 2017 in terms of Top 40 music, if not the most iconic pop song. No, seriously, it was so refreshing to come back from a terrible exam and hear this playing in the room you usually hanged out in. It's such a catchy, excellent example of Latin music that ended up saving Camilla's career, which was in then-murky waters. And, yes, I'm going to be blunt: having one of the best and most successful songs of the year be one by a Cuban woman during the Trump administration was AWESOME.

**poppinmmolly** (9): bop

**rotating3Dtext** (9): it's pretty good/iconic, but overplayed to hell

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): jeffery

**eklxtreme** (8.5): really unique and well produced. Camila has great vocal delivery here and everyone that worked on this song added something nice to this.

**CarlieScion** (8): bop

**surelychoo** (8): girl snapped, this song is popular everywhere (even in China and SK!) and for good reason. Young Thug's feature is nice and Camila's voice is finally non-grating because she's singing in her lower range.

**vayyiqra** (8): havana ooh-na-na approximately 50% of my cardiac muscle is currently located in the capital city of the republic of cuba, a single-party marxist-leninist state in the caribbean

**jimmy345960** (7.6): Overplayed

**therandomsinger13** (7.2): This is always a bop. BANANA OOH NA NA!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Would be a nine without Young Thug...his verse really kills it for me

**sn0wgaryen** (7): I wish there was more to the chorus. Something better for when it's stuck in my head.

**Uber-A** (7): A cute bop. Nothing special

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.5): Havana is one of the most overexposed songs I‚Äôve heard in a long time. Ask me for a rate a few months ago, and it would have been way heart, but there‚Äôs only so many times (a thousand. like, literally, a thousand) I could hear that piano-Camila combination before it was grating as hell. There‚Äôs no substance to it. None. The best part is Young Thug, and now I‚Äôm thinking about that Thugger-Offset-21 Savage meme, so you know what, I‚Äôll bump it up a few points.

**prettylilsloths** (4): I get why this was a summer jam since it does fit well but I have never been a fan of this song...

**Roxieloxie** (1): Chromecast customer support better be so fucking this song isn't in the main rate cause I would've gave this song the song a zero with the passion of u/amumumyspiritanimal ratting I know a place in the queer rate. I have been avoiding listening to this song for so long, but this rate made me listen to it and i want my spotify stream to be revoked for this song.

**CarlieScion** (10): no halsey slander allowed here

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): I‚Äôm a wlw (in case you‚Äôve forgotten somehow given how much I talk about it) and I‚Äôm probably obligated to love this song. Representation that isn‚Äôt hugely sexualised for us in songs is so hard to come by, and to have a song like this, a breakup song that slots in nicely with the other heterosexual breakup songs, it makes me... proud. I don‚Äôt know if that‚Äôs the right word, exactly, but I am so grateful for this song and for Lauren and Halsey for being visible bisexual women. Growing up with unapologetic bicons has made me who I am, to be honest. I love wlw love songs too, and there‚Äôs an element of that love. It‚Äôs also a song I relate to deeply. It‚Äôs something I feel. And I love it.

**JennNic91** (10): I'm sad i cannot give this my eleven tbh

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the biggest disappointment for 20gayteen has been the hype for this music video

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): This was one of the few 10s I gave Halsey in the 2017 alt pop rate, and I still stand by my judgement, even if I may have overplayed this a bit too many times. It's an excellent debut for Lauren, and it's great just for the fact that it's a lesbian bop of a duet between two queer women of color (no tri-bi memes,  please). An anthem!

**prettylilsloths** (10): This is actually my favourite song on this Halsey album, I played it so god damn much when it came out. Love it

**Roxieloxie** (10): We love a sad bi anthem that makes a wait a year for a disappointing video

**sn0wgaryen** (10): Halsey and Lauren‚Äôs voices mesh together well. The lyrics could use a bit more of a wow-factor but it‚Äôs a great song. I constantly jam to it. I wish this could be my 11.

**therandomsinger13** (10): YES. If I was allowed 2 11s, this would be my second. I listened to this on repeat for 3 days straight when it came out. When they perform this together it‚Äôs so cute. I can‚Äôt wait for Lauren to put out solo music. So good.

**twat\_brained** (10): Gave this a 10 in the alt pop rate and I'm giving it a 10 this rate because IT'S LITERALLY A 10 AND THE SUPER GAY AND VIOLENT VIDEO MAKES IT EVEN 10ER THAN BEFORE. Thankfully it's guaranteed a top 10 this rate but it's performed by two incredibly divisive figures on popheads so you know it's gonna get sabotaged anywayüôÉ

**Verdantshade** (10): my favourite song on hfk, truly a queer anthem

**eklxtreme** (9): they achieve the moody vibe rly well with their vocals and the lyrics

**followingfreeways** (9): Lauren's voice sounds great in this!!! she makes this song better

**vayyiqra** (9): although the ~zOmg literally the only qUeer synthpop song eveR~ hype was dumb still this is a great song also Halsey is underrated don't @ me

**janalng** (8.9): an anthem

**1998tweety** (8.8): Didn't we already rate this? I'm just gonna copy my score from before. Also this Ally and Dinah erasure, they have solo songs that could have taken this slot instead.

**dymokc** (8): the kind of track to play when driving down the road at sunset

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): Issa vibe

**surelychoo** (8): I like halsey's type of indie-ISH pop so this is really nice but I cannot distinguish their voices

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i don‚Äôt remember what i gave this in the other rate

**Uber-A** (7): it‚Äôs good but overrated!

**poppinmmolly** (6.8): boring

**Raykel** (6.5): I don't get everyone's obsession with this

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Elena Jane Goulding outsold

**poppinmmolly** (10): reminds me of Abba

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): what the hell this is good

**Uber-A** (10): One of Little Mix‚Äôs most underrated songs... Deserved so much better. It‚Äôs stunning.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): once again, they kill the harmonies on this.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): sounds like a song on Title but good.

**sn0wgaryen** (9): I love the pacing.

**surelychoo** (9): I love this doo wop vibe so much. The 'nasty' line takes me right out of the song though, and I can't tell whether I like that or not.

**welcometoNY** (9): queens of vocals. Beyonce, Christina, and Adele are shaking

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Really nice throwback to the earliest girl groups out there-it's essentially a song you hear on oldies radio, except with better production, and in a world where maximalism is everything, it manages to be glorious. The vocals are up to par here, as well. It's proof that Little Mix is a true girl group, continuing a tradition from several decades past and reflecting old influences several decades after the genre cemented its place in popular music.

**janalng** (8.2): cause shalalala

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Love the soul influence. Great track!

**therandomsinger13** (8): I never realized how kind of sultry this song was listening to it at 13. I love the music video. I always love all of layered vocals at the end.

**VeganSquash** (8): I love this throwback sound.

**prettylilsloths** (7): It was a fresh sound compared to what was on the charts at the time, while it isn't the stand out on the album it's still a solid song (still a weird single choice though)

**Raykel** (7): This is a cute little doowop inspired bop. I usually don't like these :meghan: but this was nice.

**rosesmp3** (7): sha la la la

**vayyiqra** (7): legit feel like I'm listening to the soundtrack of Grease rn but I don't hate it???

**fifthchevron** (6): Definitely works better when accompanied by the video.

#no one loves you

**tf2manu994** (6): would be 7 but -1 point because the lyrics are garbage

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5.5): Throwback melody is appreciated

**gowestyoungkanye** (5.2): Their vocals are sublime on this, but it feels very formulaic, a rehashing of something Amy Winehouse-y but without her emotion, I just can‚Äôt get into it.

#last christmas, i gave you my heart

**letsallpoo** (11): it sounds like meghan trainor, abba, christmas music. and cocaine all mixed togethed and its AMAZING

**followingfreeways** (10): my forever mood is playing the "christmas" version of this song, where literally all they added is bells

**1998tweety** (9.5): This song is a huge bop and has a dope Christmas Mix, but probably shouldn't have been the second single off the success from Black magic.

**dymokc** (9): this is such a fun and upbeat song. Love this and the christmas mix

**robbiec\_** (8.2): I used to think this was a christmas

**Roxieloxie** (8): This song either feels like a song from victorious or like it was a Christmas song that didn't work out. Either way the chorus is probably my favorite part.

**twat\_brained** (7.9): I love "Beauty School Dropout", but at least that didn't need a Christmas version to stay relevant

**strawberryswing1** (7): why the chorus of this remind me of a christmas song.

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): Yes, we all know this sounds like Style. But it still goes all the way off.

**rickikardashian** (10): An amazing piece of art. The way Taylor describes her relationship with Harry really hig... Oh, this isn't Style. Welp, this is an amazing song too. The sound is almost impeccable, and the "We might never be more than what we are tonight, but I still want to enjoy it" feel that it has is nice. I don't think the song ever left the top 5, and it shouldn't have. This was my prediction for the win and it wasn't far away from getting it.  With this song out, One Direction has only one song left, and it isn't even a single, which I guess is curious, to say something about it.

---

#flawless

**1998tweety** (10): This song is perfect.

**eklxtreme** (10): that chorus is POP PERFECTION I'm not delusional you are!! also that bridge is too real :(

**followingfreeways** (10): this is the best song ever to play with your windows down at night. im not kidding. go try it now. thanks

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a MUCH better single to precede the album tbh

**VeganSquash** (10): another great chorus

**Verdantshade** (10): my favourite single tied with night changes - whether or not it takes elements from style, it's a perfect pop song

**janalng** (9.5): smooth

**sn0wgaryen** (9): I think this is a nice pop love song.

**Uber-A** (8.5): the chorus on this is EVERYTHING.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): the lyrics can be kinda cheesy, but hey it's a jam

**dymokc** (8): what a great song, love the chorus a lot

**kappyko** (8): Once Harry gets in on the track, it becomes amazing. I'm nervous I'm actually going to become a Styler omg.

**surelychoo** (8): This song as a weird vibe, idk how to describe it. Something about the synth sounds in the back make this whole song feel like it's in an alternate Berenst√¶in reality.

#flawed

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): why is this mixed so weird i want to die

**vayyiqra** (7): hey girl, just give me a chance, I'm a nice guy, I'll treat you right unlike those other guys who are all jerks (Ricki's note: ....the song is literally nothing like this.....)

*Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Out of all the slow songs they could have chosen for the single, they chose this?

**robbiec\_** (5): I used to hate this song like it was a zero contender but it‚Äôs grown on me even if I am tired of songs with this message

#we never go out of style

^(stream delicate)

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): yeah it sounds a lot like Style, but Style is really good so I won't complain
**ImADudeDuh** (10): I love Taylor Swift - Style

**jimmy345960** (10): Wow! I love this song, Style deserves the world!! Taylor is shook, stream Delicate, I Did Something Bad, Gorgeous and Getaway Car on Spotify/Apple Music, thanks!

**original\_doll** (10): this song's got style

**twat\_brained** (10): I'm not even bothered by the "Style" comparisons, because I'm secure in knowing that it's one of Taylor's best, therefore any song which even slightly mimics it is a good one. This one is a great one, however, because it's by One Direction.

**hikkaru** (9): You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye And I got that red lip, classic thing that you like And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style You've got that long hair slick back, white t-shirt And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt And when we go crashing down, we come back every time 'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Well, yes, this is essentially Style, but I feel more like the songs are twins rather than clones, and even if I stan Taylor, I think Haylor was essentially faked, anyway, so I'm not personally affected by the lyrical content-though, honestly, the 'if you're looking for someone to write your breakup songs about' line made me scream the first time I heard it. And for what it's worth, while I think Style is a step ahead overall, this has better vocals. It does a great job in being one of the few pure pop songs on the album.
**welcometoNY** (9): ok so it's an inferior version of Style but Style is so good that even a bad version of it is still great

**Roxieloxie** (8.9): I don't like her that much but this is my favorite taylor swift song

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.1): Perfect is a strange kind of devastating, and it should only be like that in the first place if you were heavily invested in 1D, but I think it‚Äôs pretty obvious that this is not a happy song from the key it‚Äôs in. Especially when the Taylor Swift callout hits about, and the strings come in on ‚Äòbaby we‚Äôre perfect‚Äô... I take points away from Perfect because I find it to be lacking something (don‚Äôt ask me what, I think it‚Äôs vocal-related though) but it really is such a lovely little song.

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): This was the only 1D song I would listen to because it was about Taylor Swift. I remember I used to answer if she liked doing the things in the chorus because I was such a super fan and thought I knew everything about her. It‚Äôs a nice, chill song.

**CarlieScion** (6): I'm still mad that this ""answer"" to Style didn't get the same amount of hate by Directioners that Style did

**prettylilsloths** (5): This really is a rehash of Style though isn't it? It's pretty forgettable overall but not terrible

#LARRY IS REAL!!!! OPEN YOUR EYESSSSS

**fifthchevron** (5): Everyone loves Harry serving the Taylor tea, but the real tea was Harry AND Louis writing this song together and making sure they told as many outlets they could that this was THEIR song lol

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): Now this is how you do these kinds of ballads, next time at least get a man who can deliver some vocals.

**rickikardashian** (10): The better version of the mess that the original version is. This reached the top a few times, but ended up being in third, which i‚Äôm at peace with. The Gays^‚Ñ¢ got justice, feminism won, and we don‚Äôt have to play that video of Jason Derulo saying his name again

---

#good taste

**dymokc** (11): THE REAL REASON I DID THIS THREAD. THE PERFECT LGBTQ ANTHEM AND MY FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME. FROM JADE'S SOFT HEAVENLY VOICE TO JESY'S HIGH NOTE, THIS SONG IS PERFECT.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (11): A QUEER ANTHEM I DIG IT

**prettylilsloths** (11): This was the song that drew me back into Little Mix and I still stand by that because it is absolutely beautiful. The intentions behind the song, the lyrics and the feelings it emotes are all A+

**sn0wgaryen** (11): This is such a sad, but beautiful song.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): awww, sweet. And gay.

**fifthchevron** (10): Me @ Jade for writing this: "talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before"

**followingfreeways** (10): this song is perfection but unfortunately brings me back to the scary days of being a 1d fan on Tumblr when people connected this song to Louis and harry's "relationship" kill me haha.

**kappyko** (10): This arrangement is much more appropriate for the subject matter, and I really admire their vocals on this.

**original\_doll** (10): the obviously superior version of this song

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is so good. Jason Derulo kinda ruined the other version.

**PuggleMaster** (10): wow this is way better now that men are off it

**Roxieloxie** (10): I remember when this song came out and every teenage gay girl was freaking out about it, but i didn't listen to this version so I was so confused as to how it was a gay anthem. Then when I listened to this version some time later and I was brought close to tears. This song is so powerful and amazing. Like if wasn't rating this against MITAM This would really get my 11

**surelychoo** (10): My lesbian anthem part 1. Got robbed of single status by Jason Derulo, that bastard.

**twat\_brained** (10): I'm duo-bi, bisexual and biased since this is the gay anthem we all need in our lives and the only version of this song that I will talk about.

**welcometoNY** (10): the superior version of this song

**1998tweety** (9.5): I'm not gonna bother writing a long essay for this cause I'm sure 10 of you will retell stories about how you listened and wept to this after a date with your boyfriend. On a side note one thing I love is Perrie's little voice crack during the 2nd chorus.

**eklxtreme** (9): violin ballad, I'm in. jade rly kills this.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): and you fuckers added jason derulo to the original when the part 2 was THIS good????

**janalng** (9): a deserved calm part two to the best song on the album

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Yay! When you remove Jason Derulo from this it makes the song really, really good; it's an amazing ballad, which is hard to come across nowadays (the main exception, of course, is Praying). The girls compliment each other really well and this manages to be an anthem in the way the previous version never really was.

**Uber-A** (9): STUNNING!

**Verdantshade** (9): better than the jason derulo version but I feel the song would be better with male vocals

**therandomsinger13** (8): Sadness part 2 and they kicked out Jason.

**VeganSquash** (8): erase the Derulo version obese, this is so much better.

**Raykel** (7): Jason left and it became beautiful

**strawberryswing1** (7): cute enough

#bad taste

**vayyiqra** (7): okay what is with all the sappy ballads and also where is Pt. I p.s. this would be better as an album closer (Ricki's note: Well Tamar, did you hear the album?)

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): It's like the first part only somehow even worse.

**robbiec\_** (5): and with this Little Mix will be soundtracking a lot of charity ads however I am breaking-even because this is a belter

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): [Little Mix vc] ‚ÄúOh? You liked Part I because it didn‚Äôt sound really ballad-y with all that instrumentation in the chorus? Fuck you. Choke, bitch. Oh wait, you‚Äôd like that. Drop dead!‚Äù

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (8): This is really good, but I kind of don't get why y'all salivate so hard over it.

**rickikardashian** (10): What I would call the "All too well" of the album. A hidden gem in a very popular artist's album, that was never made a single but is almost unanimously declared by the fandom as one of their best songs. I knew this would place highly in the rate, because overall it has always received great critiques, but I'm actually shocked at it being this high. I always hated how many people wrote off 1D as just some dumb boyband, because this shows that they really were fully rounded musicians that could do more than just easy teen bops. ~~This also shows that they should have taken advantage of this era way more, considering they ended up having 10 songs in the top 15~~

**fifthchevron** (11): The best song from the past decade that no one knows.

**gowestyoungkanye** (11): What A Feeling is 1D‚Äôs best song, and we all know it, so instead, let me tell you all a story. /u/robbiec_, the Popheads twitter gc‚Äôs most beloved dumbass (get in on the action, send a DM if you want to take part, we‚Äôre a fun group of absolute dickheads), has been waiting for me to roast him for, like, a month now for some reason and I said I would do it in /u/nerdy_boy_chris‚Äô rate. And you know what? This is edging, Robert! See you in another month!

**janalng** (11): Best Song ever (pun intended)

**jimmy345960** (11): This song is magical and I love it thanks

**original\_doll** (11): one of the best songs in One Direction's discography, it just sounds like magic

**Raykel** (11): The visuals the production gives me has me in love. The only bad thing about this song is that it didn't come with a music video.

**strawberryswing1** (11): My most listened to song on last.fm. This song is perfection.

**surelychoo** (11): The perfect song. An absolute jam. I think I can listen to only this song for the rest of my life and not be tired of it. It's soooooo atmospheric, and everything just melds so smoothly together, especially their voices during the chorus. I am forever salty that this wasn't their third single before History...

**Verdantshade** (11): my favourite song ever and far and away the best song the boys ever wrote. everything about it is perfect. it's like fleetwood mac's dreams and taylor swift's sweeter than fiction had a baby. the atmosphere created by the song is magical; the harmonies in the chorus are beatle-esque and the guitar outro blends perfectly with the rest of the song. the song is so great because it's more than the sum of its parts - it's a product of louis's and liam's writing and each member has a verse to sing, while their vocals ride the soft but rhythmically solid bass, drums and guitar fills. take away any of these elements and the song is nowhere near as good - it's evidence that the band are best together, and at the peak of their ability

**eklxtreme** (10): this is probably the most mature song they have and it really shows how far they've come since their bubblegum pop days

**followingfreeways** (10): fux if I didnt give If I could fly my 11, this would get it 100%. this is one of the best songs they ever made, everything about the way this song sounds is perfection

**ImADudeDuh** (10): still a 10!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a chill bop

**prettylilsloths** (10): The vibe of this song? I love it! It transports me to a long road trip with the chilly wind in my hair. An underrated song

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song is funny to me because everyone says that this is 1d's best song. Like no matter what your personal opinions are, everyone also says it's this song. this song would've gotten my 11 except i still don't know who's singing at 1:39 (my money's on harry but everyone keeps telling me it's still niall)

**twat\_brained** (10): With or without rose-tinted Directioner glasses, this is a top 5 One Direction deep cut, right up there with Stockholm Syndrome, Stole My Heart and No Control. What makes it so good is that it's basically a 2015 version of "Dreams" by Fleetwood Mac. Yes, I'm serious.

**VeganSquash** (10): this is a bop

**1998tweety** (9): I love the mood and vibe this song gives off.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Joining the twice-rated club of popheads with many other worthy tracks, I find myself finally able to appreciate What A Feeling for what it is, although I wouldn't consider it the best song on this album most of the time. The 'through the wire, through the wire' part does exactly that-it's a wire, holding the song together and making it a solid, catchy bop. What's special about this is that it's the tenth song, yet I'm still not tired of what Made In The A.M has to offer. And, yes, I do wonder if the boys listened The Wire by HAIM before writing this...but it's a shout out! Only a shout out!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): it‚Äôs not in my face enough

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I love how vast it sounds. Like I'm hearing it inside a big room.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): Another nice song, but not particularly my favorite.

**dymokc** (7.5): can see this on a niall album

**Uber-A** (7.5): That chorus was so good

**vayyiqra** (7): ok suddenly the 1970s but not bad

#irene cara is better

**therandomsinger13** (6.7): Nothing all that special. Chorus is alright. One of these guys is super auto tuned and I‚Äôm not that into it.

**kappyko** (6.5): Really groovy but also snoozy and adult contemporary adjacent

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): BORRRING

#don't we all

**robbiec\_** (7): this reminds me of so many things but I‚Äôm not sure what other than that I want to be fucked by Harry Styles on a yacht

Nerdy_boy_chris: # Made in the AM

---

**Overall average**: 7.655

---
**Nerdy_boy_chris**: This was a great album, good job boys.

**TragicKingdom1**: On my first listen about a year ago, I didn't like this album at all. I found the production uninteresting and it to be generally bland. But now having heard Harry and Niall's debut albums, I can definitely appreciate the songwriting a lot more here. There are some KILLER hooks on this album. It does verge into hokey territory at points but the album is long enough to make up for that. This still isn't my favorite pop album by any means but I can't imagine a pop fan walking away from this without liking at least a few songs. [Grade: B]

**Saucymac**: wow there was a lot more filler songs in this album than i remember

**sn0wgaryen**: A MASTERPIECE

**robbiec\_**: 6 of all the albums in the rate I was dreading this one the most because One Direction do little for me but upon listening to it it‚Äôs a pretty serviceable pop album. But compared to Get Weird and 7/27 this album has the least interesting production, the weakest hooks, the most cliche lyrics and some bad performances (looking at Louis and Liam NEVER Harry). As well as this, a lot of the slow songs completely stall this album (Get Weird has the same problem) but anyway I liked this album because it sounds like an amalgamation of the ideas that would go on to become their solo careers and it‚Äôs just a cute little boy band album and was a good one to go out on

**Verdantshade**: my 2nd favourite album of all time and also my favourite album by my favourite band. while probably not one direction's strongest album, it best showcases their artistic growth and the songs deserve to be toured

**SendMeYourSATScores**: this was mastered so wrong does anyone else think it was pitched up a little bit and it pisses me off

**JanuraryFourteenth**: 7 I should have given 1D the benefit of the doubt and not just written them off as the worst things to happen to music. I miss them now.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I got the sense that this was One Direction's best album just by listening to the singles and observing the fan reception, but, woah, it did not disappoint. It's true that the rock pop songs on here can get in other artists' territory, which has always been a slight problem whenever the band is involved in anything, but it's still a great album that manages to be original and refreshing enough to capture everybody's attention. I really ended up loving it.

**kappyko**: Cute classic rock-esque pop, but i don't see myself revisiting this.

**gowestyoungkanye**: I already wrote about MITAM in my Pop Compass (refresher: ‚ÄúOne Direction‚Äôs last album, possibly forever, possible just to date, Made In The AM is their best, tying up their five year progression from getting third place on the X-Factor with a nice little bow. With the members having a hand in writing almost all of the songs, it uniquely foreshadowed some of what was to come from the members as solo artists. It‚Äôs also the album with less filler than hits, and is worth a full listen to. And then another. And another.‚Äù) but it‚Äôs worth stating again what this album and these boys mean to me again. It‚Äôs a bit of a cliche at this point, but I met my best friend (we met in real life for the first time in March and my heart is still !!) because of 1D. I started doing graphic design because of 1D. My songwriting and writing in general have improved because of 1D. I have made so many magnificent friends (here on reddit too! shouts to you, you know who you are!) and reached heights I never thought I could because of them. And I‚Äôm not really ashamed of that, but I used to be, so I try to talk about it a lot. I love 1D, and I love this album, and I miss those fucks every single fucking day.

**twat\_brained**: So when are we gonna get a proper tour for this album @1D?

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (11): This is the first Little Mix song I ever heard, and it's my absolute favorite. I love the '80s pop vibe, with the Girls Just Wanna Have fun riff throughout. THe girls sound amazing, they're clearly having a blast and it brings a smile on my face every time i hear it.

**rickikardashian** (10): Little Mix teasing this song as being all dark and scary and then releasing this bubblegum pop perfection will always be hilarious to me. This was the perfect lead single, it represents the album‚Äôs theme, lyrically (love stories that are working, but kind of aren‚Äôt) and sonically. This is just pop music at its maximum, fun, kind of cheesy and catchy. Honestly, as sad as it is, I‚Äôm almost sure Little Mix won‚Äôt cross over to the U.S. anytime soon, because if this ^(and the singles of Glory Days) didn‚Äôt make them catch on with the American public, I have no clue what will.

---

#i'll make you fall in love

**hikkaru** (11): if the gals from Little Mix thrust an unidentified liquid down my throat and used a mystic voodoo spell on me that is impossible to remove, well that would be just fine

**kappyko** (11): Oh wow rate winner

**Uber-A** (11): Pop perfection, one of the best pop songs of the decade!

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10. This was the first LM song I heard and it might me stan, at first I thought they were a less sexual version of 5H.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): queens of achieving their o.w.l.s in potions

**followingfreeways** (10): bonnie bennett wrote this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): That farting sequence in the video almost made this lose 4 points tbh.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I love these women

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Alright, imagine it's mid-to-late 2015 and you're a mildly depressed 13 year old; all of a sudden, this comes on the radio. You haven't listened to EMOTION at that point, so you declare that it's the catchiest song to ever hit the airwaves for the entirety of the year, minus Style, but Style is an exception. I'd never listened to a Little Mix song before it, but listening to it is one of the rare happy moments I can find in my late adolescence, and I'm not going to lie; I love witchy aesthetics.

**prettylilsloths** (10): This was such a great lead single choice, it's upbeat and catchy and even when listening now it doesn't feel dated

**robbiec\_** (10): so many of my friends lost their virginity to this song idk what that says about the time this song came out or the song itself but there you go

**twat\_brained** (10): Carlos Santana found sipping whiskey in his multimillion dollar home thanks to his "Smooth" royalties. This was an absolute thrill on the Dangerous Woman Tour

**welcometoNY** (10): this was the first Little Mix song I ever heard and it still goes HARD

**eklxtreme** (9.5): what a huge chorus, they absolutely kill these harmonies. this is getting top 5.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9.5): A BOP

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): I've searched for this song for years wow glad I found it because of this rate bless you r/popheads

**dymokc** (9): perfect pop song. Probably listened to this 10 mil times and watched them perform this live on youtube 100 mil times. And that Brit award performance!!!

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): I moved to the UK for the first time in 2015, and Black Magic was playing on the music video channel (I still have no fucking clue what channel this was, but it introduced me to the chill bop that is When the Beat Drops Out, those steel drums, ugh) in our hotel, and I absolutely adored it. I was a 1D stan so obviously I knew who Perrie was (and as a WLW I was VERY aware of Leighade‚Äôs existences) but I hadn‚Äôt really paid much attention to their music (aside from Wings, their best song) and seeing the video struck me so hard. I love this song because of that weird ‚Äòah yes, I live in the UK‚Äô nostalgia I have and it‚Äôs a genuinely good pop banger, and the video is aces. It loses a point because I feel strange about ‚Äòboy you belong to me‚Äô.

**PuggleMaster** (9): a cute single

**rosesmp3** (9): wow I love The Craft

**Roxieloxie** (9): This was one of the 3 little mix singles that crossed over to the US. This was one of the first song i heard from them after wings, and it's such a fun song to dance to. It's such a summer jam.

**Saucymac** (9): I had to go back and up my score on this one because it truly stood out compared to the rest of this album

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): idk what to say about this except this is my only guilty please that i‚Äôm not afraid to play around my friends

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Catchy song, very sing-along-worthy.

**vayyiqra** (9): a fun little bop, makes me happy :)

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): This song is such a bop. So many good memories flood in once I hit play. Super catchy, super fun.

**janalng** (8): A simply good pop song

#im a christian

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Why does this sound like the theme song to a Disney Channel sitcom?

**fifthchevron** (7): This took about a year to grow on me, and it was more the energy and personality that got me. The lyrics are pretty awful.

**strawberryswing1** (7): this sounds like something I would have stanned in the fifth grade, and I mean that in the worst way possible.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): this sounds like a song from a disney series about teenage witches

**surelychoo** (6): I just kept thinking about that poor girl whom they made fart in front of everyone for no reason. #stopbullying

**VeganSquash** (6): its a bit corny, like "girl-group" type music, which sounds sexist, but I don't know how to describe it.

Nerdy_boy_chris: # Get Weird

---

**Overall average**: 7.364

---

** Nerdy_boy_chris**: I fucking love this album, it's never left my rotation, and i'm so glad i got to rate it.

**TragicKingdom1**: This is one of those album with high highs and low lows. I think it starts out really well with sugary yet impactful pure pop that showcases the girls' talent really well. Then, things get really homogenous and messy and it loses me. There are glimpses into the previous greatness but it's generally pretty mixed and I don't think I can say that I LIKE any songs on the tracklist from I Love You to I Won't. This is good for a bubblegum pop album just for its first half alone, but imo you can skip the second half. [Grade: B]

**sn0wgaryen**: A pop masterpiece.

**robbiec\_**: 8.3 for me Little Mix tread a line between pop perfection and low brow which is good for people like me who like my pop music with a bit of age but also because I am usually the one in charge of music at pre drinks and EVERYONE LOVES LITTLE MIX. my super straight roommate wanted us to go to a Little Mix show as a group of lads, that is the universality of Little Mix who in no time will have snatched the Brit pop girl crown from Girls Aloud

**Verdantshade**: probably my favourite little mix album - it's filled with throwback girl pop bangers and it doesn't have any songs that I always skip (ahem you gotta not)

**SendMeYourSATScores**: i didn‚Äôt know how good this was for some reason wtf

**patronsaintofaspies**: Outside the UK, Little Mix manage to be some of the best underdogs in pop music despite relatively long-lasting success both locally and internationally; they're not very prominent on the charts, but everybody knows how their most famous songs go, and you'll always find some fans your class and in your group chat. Get Weird was a pretty decent introduction to them for me; it's by no means a record without flaws, but it hits in the right circle when you need it to and I can't call it a waste of fifty five minutes. I have some complaints about quite a few songs on it, but it's also made me curious to check out the rest of their discography.

**kappyko**: I've never heard this before, but it's like they're going from Meghan Trainor's Title era to Meghan Trainor's Thank You era in one album

**gowestyoungkanye**: This is probably my least favourite Little Mix album, despite the fact it has the best singles (and music videos). I found it really formulaic and disappointing, and they tried to weave some commonalities through it but ultimately, it‚Äôs a low point in their discography. I think my average came out to 5.7, and while it hurts my heart to put my girls so low, yeah, there are some really shit songs on Get Weird.

**twat\_brained**: Stopped being a Mixer round this era bc I didn't physically buy it like with DNA and Salute.

Roxieloxie: Listen this was so fun. I think the last time all of us 1D Stans got together in a thread was your pop compass one. even if we all have varying opinions on different songs it‚Äôs always to have an excuse to freak out about the boys together.

vayyiqra: TALENT WON YES the first two days had me mad that 5H was done so dirty by you middle-schooler Directioners but I'm happy that one of the best songs in the rate won as it deserved to, that's m' girls, I stan Little Mix now for this sole reason they are the true intellectual heirs to the Spice Girls üá¨üáß
