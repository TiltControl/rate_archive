Ultimate X-Factor Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/8ny2wn/ultimate_xfactor_rate/

Hello all! It's me, your favorite Ed Sheeran stan. This month's rate, hosted by me and /u/rickikardashian will be looking at 3 different groups, who all appeared on the [X-Factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_X_Factor), Simon Cowell's American Idol copy. All three artists appearing in this rate, clearly have that special something as they have millions of fans, chart success, and their fair share of bops. Will the 1D stans take overthe rate? Will 5H be dragged? Wll Little Mix pull a CRJ? It's up to you, folks. Here is the [pre-prepared message link](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Nerdy_boy_chris&subject=X-Factor%20Rate&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Get%20Weird%0A%0ABlack%20Magic%3A%0A%0ALove%20Me%20Like%20You%3A%0A%0AWeird%20People%3A%0A%0ASecret%20Love%20Song%20%28feat.%20Jason%20Derulo%29%3A%0A%0AHair%3A%0A%0AGrown%3A%0A%0AI%20Love%20You%3A%0A%0AOMG%3A%0A%0ALightning%3A%0A%0AA.D.I.D.A.S%3A%0A%0ALove%20Me%20Or%20Leave%20Me%3A%0A%0AThe%20End%3A%0A%0AI%20Won%27t%3A%0A%0ASecret%20Love%20Song%2C%20Pt.%20II%3A%0A%0AClued%20Up%3A%0A%0AThe%20Beginning%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Made%20in%20the%20AM%0A%0AHey%20Angel%3A%0A%0ADrag%20Me%20Down%3A%0A%0APerfect%3A%0A%0AInfinity%3A%0A%0AEnd%20of%20the%20Day%3A%0A%0AIf%20I%20Could%20Fly%3A%0A%0ALong%20Way%20Down%3A%0A%0ANever%20Enough%3A%0A%0AOlivia%3A%0A%0AWhat%20A%20Feeling%3A%0A%0ALove%20You%20Goodbye%3A%0A%0AI%20Want%20to%20Write%20You%20A%20Song%3A%0A%0AHistory%3A%0A%0ATemporary%20Fix%3A%0A%0AWalking%20in%20the%20Wind%3A%0A%0AWolves%3A%0A%0AA.M.%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%207/27%0A%0AThat%27s%20My%20Girl%3A%0A%0AWork%20From%20Home%20%28feat.%20Ty%20Dolla%20%24ign%29%3A%0A%0AThe%20Life%3A%0A%0AWrite%20On%20Me%3A%0A%0AI%20Lied%3A%0A%0AAll%20in%20my%20Head%20%28Flex%29%20%5BFeat.%20Fetty%20Wap%5D%3A%0A%0ASqueeze%3A%0A%0AGonna%20Get%20Better%3A%0A%0AScared%20of%20Happy%3A%0A%0ANot%20That%20Kinda%20Girl%20%28feat.%20Missy%20Elliot%29%3A%0A%0ADope%3A%0A%0ANo%20Way%3A%0A%0ABONUS%20TRACKS%0A%0AHavana%20%28feat.%20Young%20Thug%29%3A%0A%0ALove%20Lies%20%28feat.%20Khalid%29%3A%0A%0AStrangers%20%28feat.%20Lauren%20Jauregui%29%3A%0A%0ASign%20of%20the%20Times%3A%0A%0ASlow%20Hands%3A%0A%0AStrip%20That%20Down%20%28feat.%20Quavo%29%3A%0A%0ABack%20to%20You%20%28feat.%20Bebe%20Rexha%20%26%20Digital%20Farm%20Animals%29%3A%0A%0APillowtalk%3A%0A%0AReggaeton%20Lento%20%28Remix%29%3A%0A%0AEND%0A%0A%0A%0A%0A) to submit your scores. So without further ado, let's take a look at the albums!

[Little Mix - Get Weird](https://open.spotify.com/album/4bzVI1FElc13HQagFR7S1W)

Little Mix, the only group in this rate to actually win the X-Factor, and you can see why. This group, made up by Perrie Edwards, Jade Thirlwall, Leigh-Anne Pinnock, and Jesy Nelson, have all the best qualities a girl group can have, no internal drama, great chemistry, good vocals, bops, even distribution  of singing parts, and fantastic harmonies. And while I could've chosen any of their other albums, which you all should check out if you haven't, I chose Get Weird as it's one of their more diverse albums, with genre hopping, throwback songs, bops, and songs that show off their skills, it's no wonder that they're the 7th best-selling girl group of all time. (Except in the US apparently, get it together America.)

[One Direction - Made in the AM](https://open.spotify.com/album/1gMxiQQSg5zeu4htBosASY)

One Direction, the premiere boy band of the 2010s. They stole our hearts in 2012 and continued to serenade us and release bops for the next 4 years. Members Harry Styles, Niall Horan, Liam Payne, Louis Tomlinson~~, and Zayn Malik~~ first auditioned in 2010 as soloists, but ended up placed as a group. They placed third in the competition, but Simon must've seen something in them, as they ended up being one of the most successful acts on his label. This album is a departure from their previous albums, as this is the first album without original member, Zayn, as he left 1D the year before. And this the last album released before their indefinite hiatus and solo careers. As such, this album feels like a more mature and grounded album than any of their previous albums. With send-ups to their X-Factor past, a re-imagining of their original sound, and a whole lot of love songs, it's easy to see why this album is a fan favorite.

1.	Hey Angel
2.	[Drag Me Down](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jwgf3wmiA04)
3.	[Perfect](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ho32Oh6b4jc)

5.	End of the Day

14. Temporary Fix
15. Walking in the Wind
16. Wolves
17. A.M.

[Fifth Harmony - 7/27](https://open.spotify.com/album/0pF0oyuPNdOObniB1Ng0kW)

Fifth Harmony, the only American act in this rate. This group, made up by ~~Camila Cabello~~ Normani Kordei, Lauren Jauregui, Dinah Jane, and Ally Brooke, won 3rd place in their season of the X-Factor, like 1D and joined the American version of Syco. This album is their most polished and well-put together out of the three. They got good producers, actually good guest stars (looking at you Kid Ink), the girls all sounded like a group, and their most powerful singer was still in the band. This album contains their biggest and best hits, and the album as a whole is full of bops. It's too bad they couldn't keep the momentum going.

1.	[That's My Girl](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sY3rIlrTTh8)
2.	[Work From Home feat. Ty Dolla $ign](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GL9JoH4Sws)
3.	The Life
4.	[Write on Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7WuggM1WBiU)
5.	I Lied
6.	[All in My Head (Flex) feat. Fetty Wap](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jsbeemdD2rQ)
7.	Squeeze
8.	Gonna Get Better
9.	Scared of Happy
10. Not That Kinda Girl feat. Missy Elliot
11. Dope
12. No Way

#THE RULES

I. DO NOT MISS OUT ON ANY SONG

If you do, it will mess up the program, this includes the bonus tracks. Please listen to every song

II. Score each song from 1 to 10.

You are allowed ONE 11 AND ONE 0. Decimal places are allowed but only to the first digit, so scores like 8.2 are allowed while scores like 7.27 are not, as it will mess up the program

III. DO NOT SABOTAGE

With this rate, I honestly don't expect any sabotage, but I will be keeping an eye out for it. If i see any scores that look to be sabotaged (for example, giving 7/27 all scores under 4 while giving Get Weird all scores above 9 without any explanation for either album). Having Preferences are fine. Being a little messy is fine. Hate comments are not. Sabotage is not.

IV. Comments are encouraged

If you're participating in a rate, and you don't leave any comments, did you even rate?  


HERE is an example of a perfectly good comment:

>Perfect: 9 This is just Style again, right?

HERE are examples of improperly done comments:

>Work From Home: 10: Invented the labor force   
>	
>Work From Home: 10 - Invented the labor force  
>		>Work From Home: Invented the labor force (10)  
>		Work From Home: This gets a 10 because it invented the labor force!

Or anything that’s not the first example.

Here is the [SPOTIFY PLAYLIST](https://open.spotify.com/user/thepopheads/playlist/6lUbP6ELfea6sGfq3yfnmI?si=LekO4hIqRTyH-P9_jCM0LA) AND THE [APPLE MUSIC PLAYLIST.](https://itunes.apple.com/us/playlist/ultimate-x-factor-rate/pl.u-RDbWsDb2J0e)

Any questions or comments, leave a comment or message me or /u/rickikardashian

Please try to have your scores in by June 30th, but I will allow extensions if you let one of us know.

Again, I don't think this particular rate will get messy, but please be civil and respect each other’s opinions, this is just a rate for fun.

~~Give Black Magic & Get Weird your 11s!~~
