Little Mix completely stole the show here, and the fact that this wasn't massive in the US is a hate crime against women, gays, and the Latinx communities.

---
**dymokc** (10): PLAYED THIS 40 TIMES WHEN IT CAME OUT EVERY SECOND OF IT IS SOO GOOD.

**kappyko** (10): Omg Latin America WON the X Factor!!!!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i wanna be gangbanged

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song goes off, Like what more can I say

**eklxtreme** (9.5): I'll be playing this every summer for the rest of my life

**1998tweety** (9.3): Lowkey the Hair Sean Paul Remix should've been here instead. This is still a huge bop though.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): No explanation needed.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I wake

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Spanish speaker here who thinks CNCO are pretty good. I was wary of this remix when I heard it was coming out, but the two bands fit together well. The girls deliver the Spanish lyrics really well.

**twat\_brained** (9): This is CNCO's peak and it's not even because they're the main artists lol

**janalng** (8.9): replace Despacito with this please

**gowestyoungkanye** (7.8): I don’t care about CNCO but this song is fine, I guess

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I don't know how much little mix add to it

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Despacitres. Fun. I wish there was more Spanish.

**Uber-A** (7.5): A bop!

**prettylilsloths** (7): It definitely had more potential to be an even bigger bop but it's still a good song

**surelychoo** (7): so can Little Mix collab with SA superstars KARD next?

**poppinmmolly** (6.5): no

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): idk what to say about this song so i’m just gonna say listen to PRETTYMUCH they’re better than one direction anyway

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): It's a bop when you hear it and it stops being a bop when you put your headphones down. Perhaps I'm just not accustomed to Latin pop music but it's literally the definition of a serviceable song. At least Little Mix didn't try to speak fake Spanish.

**robbiec\_** (5): I’m breaking even because although issa bop it’s a shameless trend jump that I have completely accepted from Little Mix because they pull it tf off but this is just eh

**vayyiqra** (5): reggaeton is quite possibly the worst music genre to ever exist and even Little Mix can't save it

**fifthchevron** (1): TRASH

Nerdy_boy_chris: # #30: [All in my Head (Flex) [Feat. Fetty Wap]](https://i.imgur.com/aBbPf6A.png)

**Lowest Scores:** (0 x1) CarlieScion (2 x1) fifthchevron (3 x3) Darkra01, franklytheturtle, gowestyoungkanye 

---

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): Yes, this a rip-off of 679, but I fucking love 679 so i'll take it.

**rickikardashian** (10): And today’s first song out is the bop that took an entire Avengers assembly to write and produce. This is another shock, because I expected this to be liked way more by the sub, it’s fun, catchy and sexy, but maybe reggae is way too close to trop-pop and we are all a little bit traumatized by that genre dominating the charts for the last 2 years. 

---

#the flexing worked

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When i learned this was a sample I was shook.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a little overproduced, but still a bop nonetheless

**PuggleMaster** (10): a perfect summer bop

**robbiec\_** (10): I thought maybe Work From Home was a fluke but this song made me start to take 5H seriously

**eklxtreme** (9.5): I have grown to love reggae-inspired pop, especially this. that pre chorus!!

**twat\_brained** (9.3): Julia Michaels fucking did #THAT when she wrote this. IMO one of, if not her BEST song, which is kinda sad considering she doesn't even sing it but then I remember what happened when I tried to imagine Julia as a singer :grimacing: More importantly, can we FUCKING TALK ABOUT NORMANI'S BIKINI IN THE MUSIC VIDEO?  I STAN AN ABSOLUTE GODDESS

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): invented (pop)heads

**original\_doll** (8.5): this song deserved better, it's less annoying than WFH

**vayyiqra** (8): this song is good but Saran Wrap adds nothing to it

**Roxieloxie** (7.7): Im not a fan of the trop pop vibe in this song

**dymokc** (7.5): really catchy tbh

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): dumb lyrics but I enjoy the summer(?) feel

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Ha ha I remember I used to think “Flex! This song’s about sex!” while listening to this. Btw, what happened to Fetty Wap?? I haven’t heard anything about him for a while. Okay, I just Googled it and turns out he put out a series of “For My Fans” mixtapes this year. That’s nice.

**Uber-A** (7.5): A horny bop omg

**VeganSquash** (7.5): sex, sandy beach sex~

#not impressed

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This song was supposed to be a minor hit, but I've literally never heard it until now. Anyway, it's alright; the song is way less annoying than Work From Home, but the verses don't live up to the chorus and Fetty Wap, in my opinion, barely exists here at all.

**surelychoo** (7): lol what happened to Fetty Wap

**sn0wgaryen** (6): Nice enough.

**Verdantshade** (6): considering the song title and the artists on this, the fact it turned out as a decently listenable inoffensive summer song is shocking

**Raykel** (4.5): Reggae-influenced pop was like the worst trend in recent times

**fifthchevron** (2): So overrated.

# #FUCKFETTYWAP

**1998tweety** (8.8): My least fave of the singles but its still a bop. Listening to this now make me realise just how much of a fad Fetty Wap was. I feel like the era would've gone better if That's My Girl came out 2nd and this was 3rd instead.

**janalng** (5.6): would’ve been better without Fetty WAP

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5.5): Fetty Wap what are you even saying anymore

**hikkaru** (5): Fetty Wap’s mumbling really does kill this song

**letsallpoo** (5): i miss fetty wap. trap queen is a solid 10. he sounds so mushy-mouthed on this though

**static\_int\_husp** (5): Fetty Wap is not good on this

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): Fetty's crying/rapping drags this down from an already low score

**prettylilsloths** (4): Really had all the potential to be a beach bop, the girls bring their best but are completely dragged down by Fetty Wap who taints the whole song. Lauren's voice on pre chorus is hot as hell though and it's nice to have a song with Dinah & Normani on the chorus for once instead of Camila

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): Fetty Wap sounds like he’s singing into a box fan (see also: Ozuna). This song makes no fucking sense and I hate it. They all look super hot in the MV but hearing that they were uncomfortable about their looks makes it worse.

**CarlieScion** (0): Fetty Wap should never have been allowed to make music

#the only fetty wap sympathizer
**kappyko** (7): faux reggae is cute but i also dont remember this being as much of a snooze as it is. Fetty Wap saves it lol

#good comments (couldn't come up with a joke lol)

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): It's a rare moment when you're completely okay with two slow songs following each other on an album that's not from a 90s crooner or Lana Del Rey,  but you have a perfect example on Made In The A.M with that happening, and it involves Long Way Down. Somehow, this manages to be just as good as If I Could Fly, but even better. The folksy accent on the chorus does a great job at elevating the song's quality, giving you the impression that you're in a room full of bright candles and comfortable heat with someone you love. Brilliant.

**prettylilsloths** (10): One of my favourites, the verses and the structure they follow really works

**surelychoo** (10): My emo jam part 2. Unpopular opinion but this is one of my favourite songs on the album. People think it's kind of country-like but not really? I really like all the analogies during the verses, coupled with them singing in a really defeated tone, and then transitioning to an angsty af chorus, and then culminating in the literal falling down of the notes, YES UGH.

**VeganSquash** (10): Ok this is a great ballad what they snapped sis

**Verdantshade** (10): easily the saddest song on the album - it's straight up indie rock like home and has some of the best lyrics on mitam

**followingfreeways** (9): @zayn

**1998tweety** (8.2): Another ballad.

**dymokc** (8): this song has a timeless quality wtf 1D has great songwriters

**Roxieloxie** (8): It's a chill bop.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): I think this is one of their best heartbreak songs.

**fifthchevron** (7): why zayn... :( "Built a cathedral, but we never prayed/We had it all, yeah, and we walked away..."

**therandomsinger13** (7): Man there’s a lot of slow songs on here. I like first verse’s lyrics. Also the drums.

**vayyiqra** (7): finally something tolerable after three garbage tracks

**robbiec\_** (6): Why does Louis’ second verse remind me of Ameer from(!) Brockhampton lmfao this started with a really low score but it reminds me of The xx a bit and it’s just not a bad song

#down

**janalng** (6.8): a bit boring

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): This is 1D doing what I assume John Mayer sounds like, cause I’ve never heard a single John Mayer song and tbh? Give me a cookie. (Ricki's note: Stream Dear John on Spotify)

**twat\_brained** (5.3): This song feels just as long because of how downtempo and mellowed out it feels

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): It's so boring get on with the fast tempo stuff

**eklxtreme** (5): nothing that special

**kappyko** (5): It's moody, yes, but if this direction of slow, sappy songs is the way this album is going I'm not sure if I'm feeling it.

**Uber-A** (3): Meh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): zzzzzzzzz bye to this on day 1

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): Invented acapella if we're keeping it 100.

**rickikardashian** (10): :woot: for harmonies. I love when they do acapella stuff, and this is one of the best times they have done it.

---
#dont want it to ever end

**Roxieloxie** (10): I love the acapella here. It really works for them to show off there vocal talent.

**sn0wgaryen** (10): I love that this song is almost an acapella song. You can really pay attention to their voices.

**Uber-A** (10): Brown cow. STUNNING.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a nice accoustic-ish closer!

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Why am I giving this one of the highest scores on Get Weird? Well, basically, it's exactly how I expect a girl group record to end; a soulful, tender ballad that stays true to its roots. Despite the simple language, Little Mix once again exerts enough talent to make their performance seem genuine.

**therandomsinger13** (9): That’s right! These girls can A CAPELLA! Did your fave ever???? Very satisfying. Get that high note Perrie!

**dymokc** (8.5): a cappella queens. Also :( to the time Perrie broke down in tears performing this

**1998tweety** (8.3): This is a cute song to end the album with, its cool to hear a song with just acapella. The harmonies slay too.

**janalng** (8.2): liked it, but too short!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I love acapella!

**followingfreeways** (8): I cant listen to this song without remembering the video of the girls singing this live and Perrie breaking down crying because it was right after her and Zayn broke up:(

**letsallpoo** (8): this is what talent sounds like

**poppinmmolly** (8): I wish I had 3 singer friends I could sing this with

**surelychoo** (8): Little Mix a capella harmonies are my favourite!!!!!! A great end to the album that showcases their strongest point.

**robbiec\_** (7.6): this is some weird mid way point between the ballads and the bops

**eklxtreme** (7.5): not a bad ending

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): But there's 4 more songs tho

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): The acapella is such a bold choice. And ultimately, I enjoy it far far far more than I would if this was another dull ass ballad. (PS That high note, bitch.)

#this is the end

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): this is clearly a showcase of their voices and I mean they are good and all but the music is not that interesting

**rosesmp3** (6): Every time I hear this the only thing I can think about is that video of Perrie crying while singing it (Ricki's note: Fun fact: that video was the only one that worked on the plug, so we all we'll see Perrie crying on the reveal)

**vayyiqra** (6): okay this isn't Pitch Perfect enough a capella

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this song is so funny to me it’s like they’re all trying to outdo each other

**kappyko** (4): This isn't even the end

**prettylilsloths** (4): Their harmonies are (as always) beautiful on this and they sound great but it's never one I go back to since it's always kind of boring to me.

**twat\_brained** (4): I'm interested to know if there's ever been an acapella song on an album which isn't just blatant filler

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): Y'all hear these vocals? That's why they won Ex-Factor. And Leigh-Anne most definitely snapped.

---

#love me

**1998tweety** (11): Obvious choice for an 11 on this album would be Black Magic, but honestly this song makes me want to cry. Y'all are gonna rob and I'm gonna cry again. Casual fans probably won't appreciate this as much, but hearing Leigh-Anne come in strong on that last chorus felt so good. Leigh was easily the weakest singer during their time on the X-Factor and didn't get a huge chance to show off her vocals much on the first 2 albums (she actually got a lot of rap verses). Hearing her belt at the end is a bit of a fuck you to the haters who say she can't sing. With all that aside the song does a great job at conveying emotion, the instrumentation is pretty simple to, its really just a piano and violin(?) for most of the song.

**followingfreeways** (10): their vocals are incredible in this song and it's just sooo heartbreaking, this is one of their best ballads ever

**prettylilsloths** (10): this is probably in my top 5 Little Mix songs of all time. The lyrics and emotions are heartbreaking. Who hurt these girls :(

**rosesmp3** (10): My fave ballad by them!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I'm not really a fan of slower songs, but the vocals in this song are amazing. This is that perfect, driving down the road while it's raining as you stare out the window thinking about your first love

**dymokc** (9): why did they never perform this live? :'(

**hikkaru** (9): V O C A L S

**JanuraryFourteenth** (9): This song is beautiful

**PuggleMaster** (9): i love a good ballad and this one is great

**robbiec\_** (8.1): it’s not that I am coming to Little Mix just expecting bops (but I am) but these ballads are just such momentum breakers like girls you have already won the X Factor you don’t need these songs these are sing off songs to save yourself from elimination and I am pretty sure I have heard this song as the “moment song” when someone tells their sob story on Britain’s Got Talent HOWEVER GIRLS SIIIIIIIINNNNNG

**eklxtreme** (8): a little slow but i cant deny that this is a great ballad

**poppinmmolly** (8): I love all the wailing

**sn0wgaryen** (8): Their voices are beautiful in emotional songs.

**surelychoo** (8): My emo jam part 1. They've even got a sad violin in the background accompanying the piano lmao

**therandomsinger13** (8): More sadness. So dramatic! Pretty pretty.

**Uber-A** (8): We love a ballad... Excellence!

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Great vocals but the song is merely whelming

**kappyko** (7): I'm not suffering like on "I Love You" but hey

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Very standard in terms of the kind of ending ballads you can expect to hear at the end of these sorts of records, but that's not too bad of an archetype in this case; the vocals here are very good, and the pleading manages to seem genuine, which is the most important element if you're trying to perform songs like these.

**janalng** (6.5): a solid ballad

#leave me

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): i'm not a fan of when they shout sing

**vayyiqra** (6): sounds like one of Demi's lower-tier ballads tbh

**VeganSquash** (5.5): meh

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Yawn - another boring ballad

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): I hate love / breakup ballads. I can’t relate to them, I can’t be moved by (most of) them, I just find them dull. And their vocals are a little pitchy here. I really really hate rating Little Mix so low but I can’t in good conscience say this is a good song to me.

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): This was gonna get a 7/10 until I heard that gospel choir in the bridge
---

#i will

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This damn piano line and clapping has me F U C K I N G S H O O K

**twat\_brained** (10): "We wrote this with Jess Glynne" I think you mean Jess kept this off her album and passed it onto you guys because that's what it sounds like. This sounds incredibly powerful though so maybe I'll finally stop sleeping on Jess and give her music a listen.

**kappyko** (9): The piano loop is a little odd... but the chorus is really catchy! The bridge is beautiful, too.

**therandomsinger13** (9): This always makes me so happy. Serve me that kinda cheesy motivation, girls! I strongly remember singing this to myself in art class while making a horrible papier-mâché project. I should have made something else.

**Verdantshade** (9): wHY DO THE VERSES SOUND SO FAMILIAR?

**janalng** (8.6): great beat!

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is cute but also kind of filler.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Goddamn this album has three tons of gospel/soul influences.

**dymokc** (8): love the claps and rhythm

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): This is another song in the vein of Hair, upbeat and girl power-steeped, and I adore it. Their harmonies are lovely. It’s probably the closest song to their sound on my favourite Little Mix album, Glory Days, which is probably another reason I love it so much.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): It's a bit of a shy song compared to the ones that followed it, but it's pleasant enough; the gospel-esque piano at the beginning is very charming, and this is quite a good song for Little Mix's target audience to pick themselves up to. Very cute, and I don't mean that condescendingly!

**Roxieloxie** (8): this sounds like the ending song of some christian centered Disney channel movie.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): Catchy song but not my favorite here. I don’t come back to this song much.

**Uber-A** (8): This song gives me carnival vibes, lol I can’t explain why... but regardless it’s excellent.

**vayyiqra** (8): finally this is boppin' again (woo!)

#i wont

**PuggleMaster** (7.5): This sounds like any x factor winner song

**eklxtreme** (6.5): thumping foot stomping beats are way too dated, maybe i wouldve liked this in 2012

**surelychoo** (6): I keep imagining Little Mix hamboning to this song the entire way through. Can't focus on the song because of the vivid imagery.

**robbiec\_** (5.6): not feeling this repetitive chorus and I’m an XCX stan but the harmonies are strong although after a while my score kept climbing

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i can’t tell if i like this or not

**prettylilsloths** (3.5): I was so unsupervised that this was a Jess Glynne song when I first found out because it really does sound like one of hers. It's not bad but it doesn't really sound like Little Mix :/ The chorus doesn't feel like it's packs a punch either

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (8): I love that they made a Hair metal-inspired sex jam, but it's too acoustic for my taste. They should've honestly went full-force. ~~Also I'd love to give it to y'all one last time~~

**rickikardashian** (9): I’m actually kind of disappointed this song didn’t do better. This might be a weird comparison, but I has a very nostalgic vibe, and it really reminds to the type of [Dad Rock my dad would listen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zpOULjyy-n8). It feels like a different song than what 1D would do, but I love it for that. For me, this is in the top 10 best songs of One Direction (and I have a fuckton of those so this is like a big thing for me)

---
#love you

**prettylilsloths** (10): A very well written song about a break up that cuts deep. Liam's voice in the verses sounds great and Harry really carries the chorus well. Maybe the most romantic song about break up sex ever?

**robbiec\_** (10): this isn’t a ten. it’s not interesting enough to be a ten. It’s pretty generic and therefore does not deserve my ten. Anyway I gave this a ten because it is relatable, it’s well performed, it reminds me of Blue by Marina and the Diamonds, but most importantly THE FUCKING GUITAR and I know a lot of you 1D fans are kids but THE FUCKING GUITAR OF FUCKING LITERAL FUCKING THIS IS A TEN

**twat\_brained** (9.6): The intro and the verses are gorgeous and I love the guitars at the end of the chorus. And LOUIS WILLIAM FUCKING TOMLINSON, WHO GAVE YOU THE RIGHT TO FUCKING STOP MY HEART WITH THAT HIGH NOTE?! Top 5 on the album for me.

**1998tweety** (9.2): I like this ballad, its the first one so far that I can see myself listening to again.

**followingfreeways** (9): I so badly wish they toured this album so we could hear them change the lyrics on tour and sing "let me fuck you goodbye" cause u know they would've!

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): I love this movie soundtrack song, idc! WHY YOU WEARING THAT TO WALK OUT OF MY LIFE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Loses points because the guitar is grating.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): at some points this sounds like “Apologize” by Timbaland

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Yeah, maybe I'm being a bit too generous about the scores at this point, but then the chorus of Love You Goodbye came on and my heart fucking melted. It's a beautiful return to slower songs and the vocals hear are once again top notch, bringing me back to my candle analogy. I'm making no sense here, so IM, just going to say that sad songs are what we need.

**poppinmmolly** (9): https://akphoto1.ask.fm/649/810/951/-169996978-1tii3ho-h8kdtico65k3hj5/original/file.jpg

**Roxieloxie** (9): this song used to fuck me up badly cause Louis said he wrote it about his girlfriend at the time, and how they broke up but now im okay with it because they got back together last year and I'm so happy for them. But His solo here is still heartbreaking

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Another great heartbreak song, of which I would rank this higher than Long Way Down. Although goodbye sex isn’t a good idea, it makes for a great song.

**janalng** (8.9): Harry’s voice really gets to shine in the chorus

**dymokc** (8.5): okay whattt this is such a good song

**eklxtreme** (8): I love the mellow vibes on this, kinda feels like like a nostalgic throwback

**JanuraryFourteenth** (8): I sung along to this even though I’d never heard it before.

**original\_doll** (7.5): a fun song but on an album with so many awesome songs it doesn't really stand out

**surelychoo** (7): ah yes the boyband standard. They're being awfully romantic and angsty in a song where they just want one last fuck before a breakup.

**therandomsinger13** (7): Is this semi about the end of 1D?? There are so many slower songs on this album.

**Verdantshade** (6): 2 points for louis's high note and then 4 points for following the louis solo with a harry solo

**Raykel** (5.8): This sounds like a When-You-Look-Me-In-The Eyes-era Jonas Brothers song

#goodbye

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Another boring ballad but at least this one has some life in it

**Uber-A** (5): Well.

**vayyiqra** (5): boring and forgettable

**kappyko** (4): Reminds me of church music...

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): hm

**fifthchevron** (1): They're usually pretty good with how their songs "speak" to women but this one just really rubs me the wrong way. Mainly the "oh why are you wearing that then??". Like unless she showed up in bondage gear...shut up?? It also sounds a bit too much like Apologise.

**rickikardashian** (9):  This being a single is kind of curious for me. Their entire era they went with the most energetic hoe anthems that you drunkenly dance to whenever it gets played in the club or Walmart, and in the middle of them is just this midtempo song that sounds like it was made to be covered by Glee on the ending of an episode where they all remember they are a family after they went through some rough shit that almost made them hate each other.

#im a writer

**original\_doll** (10): quite possibly the best 5H song tbh

**poppinmmolly** (10): I love this song a lot

**1998tweety** (9.7): This is a cute wholesome song.

**prettylilsloths** (8.5): One of the better songs on the album. I actually like that it feels more like a mid 2000's song. In an album filled with dubstep-y, big beat, dance songs it's nice to strip it back and hear their voices a bit more

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): I was sad this didn’t get bigger. It was my favorite song for a little bit when it came out. Remembering the nice simple black and white video.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Loved the acoustic guitar on the intro. 'Tat me up' sounds awkward though

**kappyko** (8): This is super catchy wowww

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): the transition between the bridge sung by Camila to the next verse by Lauren is so jarring. Camila sounds like she’s oversinging, while Lauren is lax.

**Roxieloxie** (8): I wasn't feeling this one at first, but once I got to lauren's solo I was sold

**vayyiqra** (8): kind of weird but cute bop

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): does this sample some kind of video game music? It sounds pretty familiar

**dymokc** (7): their voices shine on here

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): I actually love Write On Me. It takes the concept from I Want to Write You A Song and is just a much more vocally interesting song. I think it’s the production that really makes Write On Me shine. It feels much more anthemic. The part where it loses me is, however, Camila’s, this is when her vocals become grating and her being poised to go solo at the expense of the other girls on the track gets annoying.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Fortunately, the next song isn't too similar to Work From Home or The Life, although it's not a masterpiece or anything. Write On Me has a softer chorus and better work from the group members, vocally speaking, which is a good thing. It's an unremarkable song overall, but it's not bad.

#illiterates

**eklxtreme** (7): the production starts to get rly nice at the end, but the vocals are bland and forgettable themselves

**sn0wgaryen** (7): The chorus reminds me of those power ballads from the 80s about getting through hard times. Now if only a chorus in this album would have more than just repeating the same line.

**surelychoo** (6): I'm kind of disappointed in this song because the melody is so pretty but the lyrics are just not up to par. This concept could have gone so much further but they did some basic "colour outside the lines" analogies and left it at that.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): Write me a better song please

**followingfreeways** (4): I feel bad giving this a low score but I dont really want to listen to this ever again

# buy it aint me on itunes

**CarlieScion** (10): I love Kygo

**robbiec\_** (8.8): Kygo actually quite did that y’know

**janalng** (8.5): Could be a Kygo song

**rotating3Dtext** (8): 'write on me' sounds kinda stupid but the song is nice. I see it was produced by kygo, that explains a lot

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Cute metaphor but the execution could use work. Also I don't know why Camila is straining her vocals here, it doesn't sound great. +0.5 for Kygo's production

**Uber-A** (7.5): the Walmart It Ain’t Me... but it’s still good!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): invented lazy kygo drops

**1998tweety** (10): I love this song, its a great duet.

**followingfreeways** (10): is Louis a future pop king? tune in in 26 yrs when his debut album finally fuckn drops to find out!

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): I don’t care if this is a X Factor Rate, BEBE I LOVE YOU.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the intro made me think i was listening to “Work From Home”

**Roxieloxie** (10): I love this song so much. Louis & Bebe's voices work so well together in this song

**Saucymac** (10): This 10 is for bebe, who truly carried this song.

**twat\_brained** (10): BUY AND STREAM EXPECTATIONS ON ITUNES AND SPOTIFY

**Verdantshade** (10): bebe rexha ft. louis tomlinson :( it's still a nice song but I'm not here for their subpar live vocals

**poppinmmolly** (9): a bop that didn't do well do to NO PROMO LOUIS wtf stop ranting on Twitter and get to work

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): bop

**surelychoo** (9): I love you Louis (and Bebe). Amazing. Fantastic. Marvelous.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I love both of their vocals on this, great song

**janalng** (8.3): this would’ve deserved more attention

**sn0wgaryen** (8): It’s a good song. I love Louis’ voice in it. Bebe sounds good in it too, although I don’t care much for her.

**strawberryswing1** (8): very generic but bopish nonetheless

**dymokc** (7.5): i like this song but it doesn't stand out much

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Hmm, this is an alright song. Bebe's voice is pretty mediocre in the first verse, but as a whole, it's alright, as well as the only solo song from Louis Popheads has a chance of even remembering. What bugs me about this is that the melody sounds pretty familiar. I only heard this once on the radio, so I suppose it sampled something, but...hmm.

**robbiec\_** (7.3): I actually quite like this even though Bebe steals it I just think Louis sounds cute and I don’t want him to

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): why doesh bebe sing like thish

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Bebe really drags this up from a potential four or five

**therandomsinger13** (7): Get it Bebe! Ok I think Louis is the voice I didn’t like those 1D songs. Sorry bro.

**Uber-A** (7): It’s a cute bop, nothing special.

**vayyiqra** (7): give this your 11s all you bad bitch rexhar perverts

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): This is for Bebe’s verse and the minimalist production. Otherwise, it would be easy to never listen to this song again.

**prettylilsloths** (6): Bebe really overshadowed Louis on this song but it's still catchy enough

**hikkaru** (5): it's interesting that on this song, Bebe is basically the lead artist, but on her smash hit Meant To Be she's basically the feature... anyways Louis can't sing

**Raykel** (5): Um did they rip off Coldplay's Hymn For The Weekend?

**ImADudeDuh** (3): I sleep

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (10): That drop is literally everything, and the bridge is the best one on the album. Maybe they snapped.

**rickikardashian** (10): First time I heard this song it was at like 3 a.m. after the album got leaked a few days earlier, and legit thought this was some satanic shit. This is one of my favorite songs of them, because they aren’t usually intense sonically talking, so this change was nice to hear. This kind of sound lets them harmonize and belt their hearts out, accompanied by the dubstep/satanic drop that would turn into choreo in live performances (fr, if you haven’t seen them, do yourself a favor and look it up)

---
#I wish I didn't love you.... but I do

**therandomsinger13** (11): MY FAVORITE! Love the rain sounds. Actually all of the production is great. Great imagery. Feels suspenseful. Love the buildup. The breakdown is kinda funny. Metaphors and similes! Also thank you Little Mix for teaching me Latin.

**original\_doll** (10): a music video for this could've been so epic

**prettylilsloths** (10): The atmosphere on this song is incredible! It's such an underrated song and I will defend it to my grave

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): what the hell this is beautiful and bops?

**sn0wgaryen** (10): Sounds very different from the first half but it’s great.

**Verdantshade** (10): an insane club banger, I can't believe this wasn't released as a single

**1998tweety** (9): I actually hated this song at first cause of the beat drop but after a while it has grown on me a lot. The bridge is with the choir is amazing.

**dymokc** (9): perfect song to listen to in the rain / during a storm.

**eklxtreme** (9): the slow, strong vocal part creates a nice dynamic with that dirty drop

**surelychoo** (9): Legendary live. Perrie's high note struck through me like lightning, which I guess is the point. Has the same intense atmospheric feeling as Salute.

**robbiec\_** (8.7): okay this PC Music-esque DROP I was not READY

**hikkaru** (8): the drop <3

**Uber-A** (8): That chorus... and that beat drop... Yes!

**fifthchevron** (7): The DNA sequel yessss

**VeganSquash** (7): hmmm, the PC pop drop is strange. This is another weird song, but it's kinda good!

**Roxieloxie** (6): thunder is shook

#I wish I didn't love you.... and I don't

**PuggleMaster** (7): this has song has no right being longer than 4 minutes

**twat\_brained** (6.8): This is 5 minutes long? Better be worth it. Why does this intro sound like a BTD-era Lana song? Honestly in many ways this reminds me of "Madhouse" from DNA, a song I really liked, but the production feels quite lacklustre unfortunately. They clearly didn't learn from "Grown" about antichoruses.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): This was going to be a nine or ten...and then came the hoard of robotic chipmunks

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6): did Pope Francis write the outro of this one

**patronsaintofaspies** (5.5): This song is such a waste. When it builds up you can see the song has a darker tone and production style to it, and you can hear the stellar vocals on it, too. The pre-chorus builds, getting you excited for the song's climax; and then, out of nowhere, that annoying, frog-voiced drop appears and ruins your day. Why? Even a generic chorus would have been better than this.

**kappyko** (5): Okay an extra point because of the GALL of them to do... that DROP

**welcometoNY** (5): it's pretty I guess but something about it just doesn't work for me

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.4): Beginning with a rain sample for a song called lighting is some kinda porn, I swear. The production is a little dated, and I didn’t like the snapping on I Love You and I don’t particularly enjoy it on Lightning either, the song gets so much better when the pre chorus hits and they revert to clapping. LORD FUCK I forgot about the ‘but I do’ part. Ugh, why do they do this? It never works. I hate rating them so low, but they keep doing this to me.

**strawberryswing1** (4): this song was shaping to be not that bad but what on earth it that drop?? yikes

**BearlyEvenAPun** (2.5): I think this would have done better without the weird drop in the chorus

**janalng** (2): wtf is that baby robotic voice in the chorus

**ImADudeDuh** (1): yikes

# \*listens to SOPHIE once*...

**vayyiqra** (8): okay wtf is that drop, [Japanese guy gesturing] is this PC music?

**robbiec\_** (8.7): okay this PC Music-esque DROP I was not READY

**VeganSquash** (7): hmmm, the PC pop drop is strange. This is another weird song, but it's kinda good!

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (9): This is an underrated bop honestly

**rickikardashian** (8): This song actually frustrates me, because I have vivid memories of them performing this song and after the “Can’t get with me now I’m grown” doing a dance with chairs, but that performance just doesn’t exist. I have asked people and searched like no one, and it’s just not real. I’ll end up in an asylum because I will die defending my believe that it truly happened.

#adult

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Chloe x Halle is shook

**Roxieloxie** (10): One of my favorite Little Mix songs. This is probably my go to song when i'm thinking about my old toxic friends and how I don't need them anymore.

**dymokc** (9): Catchy af and love how little mix played a huge role in writing this. The live performance is great too <3

**prettylilsloths** (9): More 80s vibes from this one, Leigh stands out since this song suits her voice so well. Also the beat drop in this gives me a heartattack it's so good

**sn0wgaryen** (9): THE INSTRUMENTS!

**therandomsinger13** (9): It’s so great this and Hair are back to back because they fit so well together. So much fun. SCREW HIM! Love the humming.

**welcometoNY** (9): another bop, always gets me feeling hella confident.

**1998tweety** (8.3): I like this song but I agree that its a little filler, at least they kept it short.

**poppinmmolly** (8.3): @ guys I went to high school with who holla now

**fifthchevron** (8): Very relatable but not often discussed subject matter.

**kappyko** (8): I love the production on this

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): too edm-y

**surelychoo** (8): A really great promotional single, because it's not as 'exciting' as a main single but a great and well-representative enough song to get people interested in the rest of the album. The album should have been named after this song.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7.5): I wish this song had gotten more radio play

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): Is that Jess Glynne at the beginning?

**eklxtreme** (7): it's average and alright

**ImADudeDuh** (7): a weird song but i can kinda bop to it

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): From conversations I've had with people, this appears to be the song I like the most. I won't lie; I'm not a huge fan of the sample. Not because of the quality; it's actually great. I can see why people like this. I'm just not a fan of the Elvis-style humming, which brings down the song a little for me. Objectively, this is pretty good, though.

**vayyiqra** (7): album's claim of getting weird holds up tbh and it's not terrible

**Raykel** (6.5): Ariana's Problem's impact

#grow the fuck up

**janalng** (6.8): gets a but annoying with time

**Uber-A** (6): It’s not bad by any means but it’s a skip!

**VeganSquash** (6): the horns were a bit out of place imo

**twat\_brained** (5.2): An anti-chorus is a big statement so if you think you can pull it off you have to make absolute sure you can knock it out the park. This chorus is a foul pop fly which goes right into the catcher's glove.

**robbiec\_** (5): this songs like a Fifth Harmony song with the bassy groan

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.3): Grown tries to do something that just... doesn’t work. I love the chorus but for it to follow Hair, which really pulls off the ‘better now’ concept... it’s not a song I particularly like listening to.

#but babe you do it right

**kappyko** (10): Oh thank God they're back in the doo wop!!!! I love the lowkey chorus. Remarkably unsexy for a song about sex, but I think it's a more playful take on the topic. What exactly is the most appropriate setting for this song to be played, though???

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is so flirty! An instant 10.

**prettylilsloths** (10): Wow 50 Shades of Little Mix, 10 stars out of 10!!! I still can't believe they were allowed to get this naughty (especially when they couldn't even say dick on Hair??). When will Leigh Anne fulfil her true potential aka a rap career?

**Roxieloxie** (10): Like this is what i was talking about with OMG, How are you going to sing a song thats so obviously about sex but not allow them to actually say the word sex. I really should take off a point for that, but this song woke me up after falling asleep to lighting, so i'll accept it.

**Verdantshade** (10): that drake lyric lmao

**twat\_brained** (9.1): Dream about what? Shopping? Shooting arrows? Sitting outside next to them? Also tell me I did not hear them shill for Drake in that second verse. I actually like this song for a change and I don't want it to be undone. Know what? It's fine, Leigh's bars at the end saved this.

**dymokc** (9): Nike is shooketh

**welcometoNY** (9): I can't believe they name-dropped Drake. amazing.

**1998tweety** (8.9): This will be robbed so hard by you guys. Leigh's rap goes OFF and honestly it's kind of cute how they don't say sex.

**followingfreeways** (8.5): I remember I avoided this song for so long cause I thought it was about the shoe brand

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): And here’s the one I wouldn’t play for my parents. The rap slays. These girls are talented.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Good doo-wop production...not so great acronym

**eklxtreme** (8): okay pause wtf is this title/chorus. it's not fair, this song kinda bops but the repeated line is so dumb!!

**robbiec\_** (8): this has a very distinctly British sound like it kind of reminds me of Amy Winehouse and Kate Nash but I don’t know what to call the specific style anyway bop

**sn0wgaryen** (8): The piano reminds me of All About That Bass and I don’t like that. Also thought this song would be about Adidas shoes. I LIKE THIS ACRONYM THOUGH.

**Uber-A** (8): Sorry bout it but I LOVE this song... It’s so dumb and fun, it’s great.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): I didn’t get the acronym until like the fifth listen.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Okay, I'm going to say this straight up: that acronym is iconic. The album seemed a little childlike for most of its duration (not that that's a bad thing, I'm a children's author) so when I figured out what it stood for I went '...wow.' Past that, though, the song is alright. It's not show-stopping enough to be great, and the rap happening in the last thirty seconds is...strange, but it's satisfactory in terms of entertainment.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): this made me a 6th grader again

**vayyiqra** (7): queens of shilling for tracksuits, Charli XCX found comatose

# r/incels

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): wtf is this acronym lmao

**VeganSquash** (6.5): UGH, WHY DO THEY CENSOR EVERY "BAD" WORD. SEX ISNT A SIN

**janalng** (6.3): good but nothing special

**gowestyoungkanye** (6): Honestly, ADIDAS deserves a 10 for fucking up the rags alone, and I wish I could give it but it’s lucky to scrape by with something above a 5. Certain people will hate me for saying this (read: this whole sub), but this song is very Meghan Trainor-esque. Especially because of the kitchen lines. You’re welcome!

**ImADudeDuh** (6): you don't know how long it took me to realize the "shh" was sex and not shit (Ricki's note: that's fucking disgusting wow)

**Raykel** (5.5): Oh jesus they didn't have a budget for a rapper on this track so they took matters into their own hands...yikes

**fifthchevron** (4): Would've been better without censoring the word "sex" in a song ABOUT sex...but I love the rap verse and overall it does actually sound sexy.

**surelychoo** (4): The melody is cute but the lyrics are inane and tacky. the title is probably pronounced "addydas" yikes.

**CarlieScion** (3): This song might've been fun when I was like 9, but there are so many other ways you can sing songs about sex who are all way less cringey than this

**PuggleMaster** (0): the rap on this is just horrible. I just hate this song

#alpha wolf

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): Headed straight for your heart like a bullet in the dark??? Who the fuck let 1fuckingD write songs like this????

**prettylilsloths** (10): Truly a groovy song, I want to marry this track

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): cool

**Verdantshade** (10): this deserves single treatment. the 'ooh's are charming and it's one of the only fun straight-up pop songs on mitam

**eklxtreme** (9 . 5): this song makes me happy and it's honestly single-worthy

**Roxieloxie** (9): This song is also gay culture for some reason. I don't know why but it just is. Also you can sync this song up with any dance montage from a movie and it fits perfectly. The harmonies in this song are harder to hear which sucks cause From what you can hear there really good. So i know this song would sound amazing live.

**surelychoo** (9): this is like What A Feeling at 3 AM (ha) after they've stumbled home from the club. as an EXO-L directioner, my headcanon is that the wolves are EXO and they're about to dance battle with 1D but while EXO are doing the insane tree of life dance 1D are stumbling around drunk.

**twat\_brained** (8 . 8): I'm sure this can be traced back to an old rock tune from like the '70s or something, but I can't imagine who. What I **do** know is that this is a fun little jam that I enjoy putting on every now and then when I want a nostalgia kick for my boys. Oh wait, I'm just learning what the lyrics mean. Talk about lyrical dissonance.

**1998tweety** (8 . 7): Another good song.

**janalng** (8 . 6): Could be a soundtrack for a 2000’s sitcom

**sn0wgaryen** (8): It’s a nice song, although it is not one I tend to come back to.

**kappyko** (7 . 5): This is catchy! A bit overlong but the hook makes up for it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7 . 5): wulves

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): This is the best song called Wolves, so much better than fucking Marshmello.

**strawberryswing1** (7): imma fix wolves

**therandomsinger13** (7): When this started I thought it was an ad. Cool song. Pretty average.

#beta wolf

**vayyiqra** (7): Selena is not shooketh

**dymokc** (6 . 5): it's okay

**patronsaintofaspies** (6 . 5): After five minutes of thinking what this song is about, I remembered 'I hear them calling for you' in the chorus, and the faux-howling. It's a sweet, cute song that manages to do its job for anything who likes those sorts of things, but it's definitely the only song I'd have more than a 50/50 chance of skipping.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Better than Kanye's song, worse than Selena's

**ImADudeDuh** (5): for a song called "Wolves," I did not expect the fun, doo-wop-ish opening.

**Uber-A** (4): Selegend’s Wolves >>>>>

**VeganSquash** (2 . 5): this is too "boy-band"-ish, same with Black Magic by Little Mix. I cant describe it.

#you can fly

**fifthchevron** (10): "If you're lost, just look for me, you'll find me in the region of the summer stars..."

**Roxieloxie** (10): Another beautiful 11 worthy song on this album. Harry Kills on the bridge of this song and just really elevates it to another level.

**surelychoo** (10): I think I may like the lyrics of this song the most on the album. It talks about losing connection with someone you used to be close with, but it doesn't angst about it. Rather, they talk about accepting what had happened and hoping that they will reconnect in the future, but also wishing the best for the other person if they don't. Now I don't necessarily know who Harry had written this song about, but that's a beautiful message to send out to zanyone whom this song might be about.

**Verdantshade** (10): this is proof that harry's songs are the strongest on the album. the bridge is outstanding lyrically, vocally and instrumentally

**janalng** (9.5): very easy to listen to

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Not if, but WHEN One Direction reunites you'll bet our ass I'm gonna fucking scream the chorus back to these boys when they perform it live.

**1998tweety** (8.8): A lot of songs near the end (this one included) have been quite good. I feel like they should've taken a lot of the weaker songs and but them on the deluxe version instead.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.8): It tugs on my heart I opened a new bottle of Jim Beam I have a peach popsicle and I am crying please let me cry thank you

**eklxtreme** (8.5): love the maturity and the nostalgic vibes

**sn0wgaryen** (8): I think this song encompasses the whole album’s sound.

**poppinmmolly** (7.7): makes me sad

**dymokc** (7.5): really well written guitar hook

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): This kind of reminds me of how it feels like Harry Styles follows me everywhere.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7.3): This is a pleasant song

#fucking fall

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Hmm, this is actually a pretty nice song, if we're being honest. Again, there's good lyricism here, which sends me running through a windy valley. The trouble is, despite how good of an album Made In The A.M turned out to be, it's still seventeen tracks with the deluxe edition. By now the power ballad-like structures are getting a little old

**Raykel** (7): The verses are so good. I wish the rest of the song lived up to it.

**vayyiqra** (7): generic twee boy indie-pop but okay idk

**VeganSquash** (7): the chorus was a bit long-winded (haha) but this was a good song

**kappyko** (6.5): I do feel a bit tired of this aesthetic by now. Upbeat, but nothing to my appeal at the moment.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): gay

**Uber-A** (5): generic

**prettylilsloths** (4.5): I really like the backing track at the start, feels pretty fresh. Otherwise it's a bit flat

**rickikardashian** (8.3): I’m sure they used “Kinda” in a wrong way there, anyway, how did this song get so high? Did you all forget to fucking kill it alongside the rest of the Fifth Harmony songs? Were y'all too scared to do Missy Elliot wrong?

---

#don't get fucked up

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): invented slut-shaming

**ImADudeDuh** (10): No - Meghan Trainor found dead

**jimmy345960** (10): a bop

**kappyko** (10): OKAY THIS SONG IS KINDA PROBLEMATIC... but! The production is absolute funk heaven!!! They have Missy Elliott!!! Everybody slays!!!!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SINGLE

**poppinmmolly** (10): back when I used to run I ran to this song a lot

**Roxieloxie** (10): DON'T ?? GET??FUCKED??UP?? . I mean say what you wan't about 5h but at least they got to say fuck.

**sn0wgaryen** (10): A bop.

**VeganSquash** (10): this is a bop (also recommend some missy songs, I want to get into her music so bad lol)

**1998tweety** (8.5): I LOVE the vibe of this song, nothing on the album sounds like it. If I'm being honest though this is one of the weakest verses I've heard from Missy.

**dymokc** (8.5): WAIT WHATTTTTT WHY HAVE I NEVER HEARD OF THIS BEFORE?!?! THIS IS A MEGABOP

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Yay! Another good song! That marks 3 in a row! Anyway, this song brings something to the table that this album lacked; throwbacks to older girl groups. Little Mix's album was full of them, but this is the only track on 7/27 that's a direct callback to Fifth Harmony's seniors, which is made only more obvious by the presence of Missy Elliot. Once you get used to that, you learn to appreciate it for what it is; a bop of a throwback.

**prettylilsloths** (8.5): This sounds so much like a Pussycat Dolls song and they're making it work

**eklxtreme** (8): pretty catchy and upbeat

**PuggleMaster** (8): They highkey stole little mix's sound and did it better. They also got a good rap feature ugh their minds!

**strawberryswing1** (8): oh wow this is so fun. missy is kinda the worst part tho no disrespect to the legend.

**Uber-A** (8): OMGGG THIS IS A BOPPPPPP!

**vayyiqra** (8): WHAT YOU THINK I'M A THOT? FORGET THAT kind of cringey lyrics but nevertheless bops hard sick bassline

**rosesmp3** (7.8): Baby please

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Cool. Feels kinda throwback.

**robbiec\_** (7.4): if you are going to bring Ms Supa Dupa Fly out you better fucking bring it and the girls did I guess

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): My hot take is that 5H have the grit Jesy Nelson pretends she has.

#What you think, I'm a thot? Forget that

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): Missy Elliot sounds so old, she’s a legend, but her saying “Thot” made me cringe.

**surelychoo** (6): this song exists.

**janalng** (4.8): that song just doesn’t do it for me

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): Not even Missy can save this 24K Magic soundalike (Ricki's note: fun fact: this was released before 24K Magic)

**twat\_brained** (3): Listening to this now I realize this is in many ways a put down towards other women which I can't vouch for. I'm sure all the members are above these lyrics (apart from maybe Dinah) but this isn't a good look for their "female empowerment" image.

**CarlieScion** (2): A trash song, but the Missy Elliot feature saves this from being a 0

**welcometoNY** (2): wow Missy is the only good part of this song

#stay weird

**dymokc** (10): THIS IS A MEGABOP AND THE MOST UNDERRATED LITTLE MIX SONG. IT IS THE PERFECT POP SONG AND MOST PEOPLE SLEEP ON IT. THIS PLUS THE TOUR PERFORMANCE + INTRO VISUALS GIVE ME LIFE. THAT'S ALL BYE.

**kappyko** (10): Little Mix is delivering bop after bop it's so Disney Channel but I love it

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I feel like this would’ve been a fun single with a really goofy music video

**Verdantshade** (10): this is hella underrated, it's so groovy and the male vocals and key change are lit

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Omg how nice of Little Mix to do a song based on r/popheads!

**poppinmmolly** (9): a BOP that I don't hear people talking about

**prettylilsloths** (9): God this was my song for what felt like 10 million years, I love the carefree vibes that so perfectly match how Little Mix were personality wise in this era too. Jade's voice and tone is this? Amazing

**Roxieloxie** (9): I Love the track in this song. I like how much it stands out from every other song on this album.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): what the hell

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Love the vibe.

**therandomsinger13** (9): Omg I love this song. Such a bop. This song always made me feel accepted. I remember dancing pretty hard to this. I love the robot. Lyrics are great. Bop bop bop!

**welcometoNY** (9): apparently people don't like this song but it's actually the biggest bop. it's just so fun and dancey I can't help but love it

**1998tweety** (8.6): I'm 99% sure this is one of the songs that was meant for the album before it got reworked, still bops. The “something 'bout that boy” line is a nice throwback to one of their older songs.

**eklxtreme** (8): very reminiscent of 2000s pop, but this time it takes some good parts and some dated parts

**vayyiqra** (8): this song is weird tbh but I like it, this band is so positive

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Holy shit, this really divides me. I'm not going to lie and say that the message isn't over-saturated, but, my God, it definitely is. The robotic voice near the end is weird as hell. And keep in mind, this is an autistic person saying this. I'm as quirky as hell. The song in itself, though? Huge bop. The rhythm and the melody are absolutely smashing and there's great charisma between every member of the group. I've no idea what to score it, but I'd be lying if I said it was unenjoyable, so I'll give it something just short of a great score.

**robbiec\_** (7.5): okay this is a bop

**Uber-A** (7.5): This song is so fun and underrated

#In case you haven’t noticed, I’m weird. I’m a weirdo. i don’t fit in. And I don’t want to fit in

**followingfreeways** (7): ughhhh im sorry I just literally cant get into this song ever :( its so mediocre to me

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): OMG WE’RE SO QUIRKY

**surelychoo** (7): I think Little Mix excels when they're utilising their vocal teamwork, so the last part of the song where they switch between members really fast is the best part of the song, but ultimately this song is brought down by it's wOw i'M So QuIRKy vibe. Also don't understand why the album is named after this song when it's mainly a post-breakup album.

**twat\_brained** (7): Good beat but the lyrics I find… get this… weird. Particularly the bridge.

**Raykel** (6.5): They have really surface level messages in their songs. Like I get it; be unique and different!
**janalng** (6.4): sounds like a High School Musical song, but not the best kind

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): That low robotic voice is really annoying. Good production though

**tf2manu994** (6): has a man so -1pt

**gowestyoungkanye** (3.7): This is the Little Mix I hate (see also Power). It’s not an interesting song, it’s a waste of their talent, and Little Mix are way better than this.

**robbiec\_** (10): this is the only Niall song I like and boy... those slow hands aren’t the only thing I want to hear clapping...

**Roxieloxie** (10): Niall delivered on his uptempo bops on flicker. Like don't get me wrong his sap ballads were amazing but when he wanted to make a bop he really made one

**Verdantshade** (10): apart from the dirty laundry lyric, it's a really good song. it was a surprising direction from niall especially after this town, but thank god he didn't limit himself to folk pop

**hikkaru** (9.5): What material is their clothing made of that allows liquid to drip down it as opposed to just being absorbed? Catchy af song tho

**1998tweety** (9.1): Huge bop

**gowestyoungkanye** (9.1): I am a Niam girl. So I’m biased, but Slow Hands is one of the better songs to come out of the post-1D world. There’s minimal production on Slow Hands, but Niall’s voice sounds gorgeous like this, and it’s just fucking hot, I don’t know what else to say. Tell me everything about your love life Neil. I love you.

**DrunkHurricane** (9): why is the audio so choppy tho

**Saucymac** (9): watch the soccer mums shoot this shit to number 1

**surelychoo** (9): the vocal chops are my EVERYTHING. wash your clothes Niall.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): it's really catchy and it shows that niall can really hold his own as a solo artist with a distinct sound

**original\_doll** (8.5): half a point deducted for 'sweat dripping down our dirty laundry'

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hmm, I have slightly mixed feelings about this song. I actually really like the folksy vibes here, if you can call them that, and the melody is really appealing given how depressing music in 2017 tended to be. Niall's voice is also pretty okay. My problems with it is the lyrics-sure, it is somewhat shocking to hear something so explicit from a former One Direction member at first, but after you get over that you can't help but feeling a little icky over descriptions like 'dirty laundry'. I mean, for fuck's sake, why did he sing that line at Manchester? It's still a good song, though.

**vayyiqra** (8): surprisingly kind of bops

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): i'll never get over 'sweat dripping down dirty laundry' and the chopped production

**dymokc** (7.5): pretty good song that I wouldn't skip

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.5): the vocal effect used for this is not cute

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6.5): sWeAt DrIpPiNg dOwN oUr DiRtY lAuNdRy

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Honestly, I still say that this is one of the worst songs off Flicker. I don't care for it. I'm sad This Town or On The Loose weren't the huge hit from the album.

**sn0wgaryen** (6): The weird break with no sound every other second throws me off.

**therandomsinger13** (6): Always found this kinda bland.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): fuck this even more boring ass shit

**Uber-A** (1): I LOATHE this song.... the production.... those crusty vocals.... the GREASE. I’m gonna get sick.

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (9): I instinctly screamed like i was at a concert the first time i heard this.

**rickikardashian** (8): I know they didn’t have to, but like, the album is called “Made in the A.M.”, and the literal phrase is said in it, I’m just saying, this could have just been a title-track instead of A.M., idk

---
#won't you stay 'til the A.M.?

**followingfreeways** (10): AM makes me nostalgic for moments in my life that have not even happened yet. such a great closer and one of their best songs ever in my opinion

**prettylilsloths** (10): My favourite song on the album. I always love this kind of song and it so perfectly fits and talks about the weird kind of high you have when you stay up super late talking to someone you've known since childhood

**Roxieloxie** (10): Maybe one day i'll be able to listen to this song and not cry. I love how raw it feels in sound and in lyrics. one of the last shows they did was with this song at this music festival in mexico and it sounds so beautiful. I still remember the chills I had the first time I ever heard this song. wow thanks im crying now

**sn0wgaryen** (10): Remember that end scene in HSM3 when the main cast is on a stage? This song reminds me of that moment.

**surelychoo** (10): People who bought the standard album (why though?) are missing out on the album thesis, which is to reminisce with friends in the AM. History serves a similar purpose, but I think History seems to be more of a celebration of all that they've accomplished, while A.M. talks about the relationships they've made with each other those past 5 years.

**Verdantshade** (10): if this is the end, this song is a perfect way to end their career. it's one of their strongest songs ever and its folky campfire feel is true to the band

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): My best friend lives in the US and I live in the UK and... this song reminds me of her. It’s 1D, it’s staying awake cause we love each other, It just gets to me every time and It kills me and you know what, 1D were write to make it the album closer.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Swearing! Nice! Wait, does ass even count as a swearword nowadays? Now that we've got that over with, I'll have to say that I enjoy this as a closer more than History; that may be heresy, I don't know, but Harry's voice is sweet and lovely here and I find it a soothing end to an album I ended up enjoying more than I thought I would.

**1998tweety** (8.8): Why are the best songs on the album on the deluxe version?

**eklxtreme** (8.5): very sweet and perfect as a closing track

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): stay to the ehm

**twat\_brained** (8.2): An apt closer, and one that's actually kinda deep when you consider their fans who have been by their side for years. That being said, I most certainly will stay with One Direction until the A.M., whenever it may come.

**janalng** (8): nothing special but still good

**therandomsinger13** (7.7): Cool story. “Talking out of our a**es” surprised me and made me laugh.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): I know Naps really likes this song and I don't really know why.

**dymokc** (7): oh the album title

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): they said ass

**kappyko** (6): Wow, these explicit lyrics have me shaking!

#go to sleep already

**fifthchevron** (6): It's nice but drags a bit.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): Funny how two rates have an A.M I’d give a 6/10

**vayyiqra** (6): dumb lyrics and it's kind of a mess but whatever glad this overlong and boring album is done

**CarlieScion** (5): hello hipsters

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Sucky song to end an album on. Don't you want to go out with a bang?

**Raykel** (5): Wow they really ended this with the worst song on the album and used it for the title of it

**VeganSquash** (5): I honestly forget how this song goes

**robbiec\_** (4.5): I can’t tell if the pronounciation of A-M?/AM??? is genius or a fucking disaster anyway this song is so fucking generic but I linked with some lyrics AND ANOTHER GUITAAAAAR

**Uber-A** (2): Super dull.

vayyiqra: what the FUCK r/popheads i'm so mad

i'm glad i still have my morals and didn't sabotage but i am legit regretting being so easy on 1D when i honestly thought their album was forgettable trash

if i'd known there would be so many directioners out here circlejerking them and so many 5H haters i would've been harsher but i'm just too nice i rarely vote below 6

anyway both 5H and Little Mix are being ROBBED especially Lightning that song is a bop and you know it

at least That's My Girl is still in I would die of laughter if it won over all this generic boy band shit
