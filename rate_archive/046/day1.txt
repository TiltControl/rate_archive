This song is more disappointing than actually bad.

---
**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): a bop and fuck everyone who doesn’t give this a 10

**DrunkHurricane** (9.5): this song is a major guilty pleasure of mine

**dymokc** (9): really sexy and slick hook. Ed Sheeran's impact (literally)

**poppinmmolly** (8.7): fuck y'all this is a bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is a big bop but I know y'all are gonna do it dirty.

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): OKAY LISTEN HERE BEFORE YOU CALL ME DELUSIONAL....THIS SONG IS NOT THAT BAD. I hadn't listen to this song in full before this rate cause everyone said it sucked. It really dosen't Like Is it the best song ever, no. It's not even Liams best song but It dosen't deserve the circlejerk level of hate it gets. It's a non harmful dance bop

**followingfreeways** (8): it's a straight up Justin Timberlake bop but featuring quavo makes me really sad so it gets knocked down a couple points for that :(

**prettylilsloths** (8): You can all hate on Liam but I like this song! But minus 2 points for the completely worthless feature of homophobic Quavo

**eklxtreme** (7.5): this is an earworm but it gets old quickly

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7.5): I really like the song but it reeks of “I’m not that boy band guy anymore”

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.4): the 1D reference was just painful. Other than that, this song isn’t that bad

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): It's cringy af but goddam if it isn't catchy

**rotating3Dtext** (7): i mean it's a pretty standard club song (did you know he used to be on 1D?)

**janalng** (6.9): I have to bop to it even though I don’t want to

**Saucymac** (6): this gets a 6 because i like the beat but this song is pretty fucking cringe

**therandomsinger13** (6): “You know I used to be in 1D” Really? Had no clue! Just another boring sex song. Also I despise that “skrrrt!” sound. Cringe.

**vayyiqra** (6): tbh I've come to dread any song featuring Quavo because they're all awful and this isn't an exception it's catchy but the lyrics are really dumb and the chorus is trash

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): I have had the pleasure of learning way too fucking much about 1D and one of the things I know very well is that Liam Payne is way fucking better than this. He’s a really talented singer and apt musician (and I’ll say it, probably the most talented member of 1D) and that makes Strip That Down torturous. It was penned by Ed Sheeran so it has that horrific ‘used to be in 1D’ line. When Liam actually writes his own shit, it’s a thousand times better, and I can’t help but dream of the world where he released Kind of Beautiful as his debut. Before anyone says anything, I’m resigned to STD being the lowest rate song in this rate but it’s way more enjoyable than fucking Sign of the Times. At least it knows it’s garbage.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I mean it kinda bops but I can not watch any performance because it's still kinda cringe

**Verdantshade** (5): it bangs and is way too fun for its own good because it's easily one of the worst songs I've ever heard. it falls into the 'so bad it's good' category

**hikkaru** (4): hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey

**sn0wgaryen** (4): Cringe.

**original\_doll** (2): I still can't believe how bad this song is. Liam, you're arguably the best vocalist in 1D, whyyy would you choose to sing this song??

**patronsaintofaspies** (2): It's been such a long time since I gave a song a score lower than 4 in a rate! Finally, I have that opportunity! I can't express how depressing Liam's debut is. The first chorus gives the impression that it's going to be an alright song, but then I USED TO BE IN 1D BUT NOW I'M F R E E comes and you want to DIE. The song only gets more and more unpleasant, especially when Quavo randomly pops in for no reason near the end. This is such a pain to get through-heh, heh? Get it? Pain? Payne? Hello? Anyone?

**Raykel** (1): Literally try and tell me one good thing about this song cause I don't hear it

**robbiec\_** (1): just know if I could give lower than one I would

**surelychoo** (1): Why Liam.

**twat\_brained** (1): Couldn't stand it then sure as hell can't stand it now.

**Uber-A** (1): Pathetic and terrible.

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (7): This is cute!

**rickikardashian** (7): First song out in the rate, and understandably, since it is probably the least good song in this album. It’s quite slow and doesn’t really have anything too exciting about it, unless you’re Taylor Swift and the song they want to write you it *Perfect*, in that case, you can kind of like the song.

---

#I love song writing

**Roxieloxie** (10): ? This really should be my 11 but it's too late now I love this song so much. It's my go to song when im having an anxiety attack and im crying my eyes out. It's so calm and if I ever have kids I want to sing this song to them as a lullaby.

**Verdantshade** (10): when mitam leaked in low quality from the listening sessions, this is the sole song I heard. at that point, I was worried mitam was a regression from four (drag me down, infinity and perfect were all poppier than anything on four), but I fell in love with this song instantly

**1998tweety** (9): Another ballad, but this is another one I enjoy.

**robbiec\_** (9): okay this is pretty good as well??? I’m not vain enough to pretend if this was released by Sufjan Stevens it wouldn’t be GUSHED over by indieheads including myself and just because it’s by One Direction does not change anything

**dymokc** (8): harry you wanna write me a song?!

**eklxtreme** (8): sweet folky vibes

**surelychoo** (8): Uh super cute????? and when Louis first came in his voice quality shook me to my core I was not expect that amount of grit while still maintaining his clarity and lightness.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Nothing particularly special but definitely one of 1D's cuter cuts in their lineup.

**strawberryswing1** (7.5): super cute :)

**poppinmmolly** (7.3): kinda basic but nice

**fifthchevron** (7): A song about writing a song with songwriting sound effects. If you consider it to be aimed at a younger sibling or baby, it makes more sense and is very sweet. But the last verse is to the fans.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): folk is not my thing. But this is nice, I guess.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Oh, no, a dreaded 7. Don't get me wrong. This song is actually pretty good, especially if you listen closely-the sound of scribbling on a paper is an absolute gem, and I can see why this would be a fan favourite. Perhaps my enjoyment of this is affected by the fact that it seems like a testing ground for Sweet Creature (actually, who am I kidding? This entire album is a testing ground for Harry's solo career).

**therandomsinger13** (7): I like the change at around 1:50. Sweet and cute.

#I'm not gonna write you a love song

**PuggleMaster** (7): finally something different oh a boring ballad

**janalng** (6.4): Too cheesy

**kappyko** (6): A lil dumb, but it's still really intimate guitar pop

**vayyiqra** (6): the fuck is this Raffi shit but it's kind of cute so idk

**original\_doll** (5.5): kinda boring honestly

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): This song should be higher because it sounds like it should be on the Spirit Stallion of the Cimarron soundtrack (that’s a cry album if ever there was one) but it’s so utterly cheesy it’s a real struggle for me to get through (the irony of me saying this as a 1D stan, I know. Please.). The writing scribbling adlib, though? Iconic.

**sn0wgaryen** (5): I do not like when songs reference how someone is writing a song, singing that current song, singing about them singing, etc. It’s cringey to me. I tend to skip this song.

**Uber-A** (5): Dull.

**prettylilsloths** (3.8): This song isn't bad but it always makes me feel kind of weird. It's about their other halfs but the way it's sung and written sounds weirdly childish? I like the touch of the pencil scribbling in the background since they're 'writing' a song though

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (3): Why are there so many ballads this is the opposite of what I wanted to hear

**hikkaru** (3): please don’t!

**JanuraryFourteenth** (2): Ew White Guy With Acoustic Guitar music

**jimmy345960** (0): Wow, if Taylor wasn't shook by Perfect she sure is left perfectly alone with this! This is boring and has all the bad parts of One Direction in it... I hate when I feel like the song is talking "to" a random "girl". It makes it feel fake, and I like pop music. Its like the Bo Burnham song "Repeat Stuff" its bad. Sorry, i still love 1d but yeah

**letsallpoo** (0): sara berilleis is shook

**SendMeYourSATScores** (0): i’m just a little bit buzzed right now and this song pisses me off so much fuck you

#ilysm

**Verdantshade** (10): queens of ballads

**vayyiqra** (9): tbh I will never not love 80s-inspired bedroom pop and the awesome bridge more than makes up for the basic af lyrics

**twat\_brained** (8.9): This is a very sweet tune and one of my preferred LM album cuts now.

**1998tweety** (8.6): Yeah this one is also kind of filler, it doesn't help that Love Me or Leave Me basically outsells it later.

**dymokc** (8.5): Okay I definitely slept on this bop for such a long time. Especially Jesy's voice on it. Great ballad.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Way better slow ballad than Secret Love Song. Plus no Derulo!

**prettylilsloths** (8): This was definitely a grower, I remember finding it a bit boring when I first heard it but the beat works well and their voices really carry over the emotion of the lyrics

**sn0wgaryen** (8): It sounds nice, and I get it’s a love song, but I can think they can use a better title. It’s blunt but eh.

**therandomsinger13** (8): Back to tears. The high chorus is fun to sing. I remember doing so under my breath in my junior high locker room. Again, cheesy, but good. Nothing will be as much of a sobbing block of cheese as These Four Walls.

**Uber-A** (7): Jesy and Jade sound so stunning on this song

**welcometoNY** (7): the lesser ballad on this album. they're still serving vocals though.

#i hate you

**poppinmmolly** (7.3): kinda filler

**eklxtreme** (7): kinda sweet but just alright

**Roxieloxie** (7): Not really a favorite of mine. It's not bad but it's not great either

**rotating3Dtext** (6.6): ...boring

**CarlieScion** (5): Please follow Dua's rules

**followingfreeways** (5): this song sucks and im not sorry about it at all, the album would be 10x better w out this song:/

**surelychoo** (5): Kind of boring.

**janalng** (4.2): too much falsetto for my taste

**Raykel** (4): I guess Demi Lovato isn't the only one who uses the nasal technique

**rosesmp3** (4): I love LM but I could never get into this song :/

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): I Love You reminds me of something from like, the mid 2000s for something? I think it’s the snapping in the production. But god, when the chorus hits, that vocal is so grating and completely off pitch. LITTLE MIX! YOU ARE BETTER THAN THIS SHIT!

**robbiec\_** (3): is this Cher?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): who would’ve guessed a song called “i love you” was boring

**VeganSquash** (3): ballads aren't their strong suit. A bit generic.

**kappyko** (2): I don't think this is it :/

**patronsaintofaspies** (0): Honestly, this is one of the most mediocre tracks on the album. It's not bombastic enough like Hair or Black Magic but it doesn't have the girl group magic present in slower songs like Love Me Like You or even Secret Love Song. It's too subtle and quiet for its own good.

**strawberryswing1** (0): holy moly these vocals yikes

#hug me<3 uwu

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): A soundtrack song (only the moon to guide). Lauren sounds phenomenal on this track, her verse is lovely too. Considering how silly the chorus is (put your arms around me and squEEeeEEeeEEEeeeeEEEEze [dated instrumental break]) I actually really like this song. God I need to get fucking laid.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): What always won me over with this one was just how airy and sweet it sounded to me.

**1998tweety** (8.2): I've never really been a fan of a beat drop chorus, the one in this song isn't really bad but I still feel like the song would be better without it.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): “And squeeze.” I think they could have come up with something better than that, but this is a good song.

**Uber-A** (8): that hook is SOOOO CATCHY I love this song

**vayyiqra** (8): put your arms around me bb and squee-e-e-e-eeze what a great hook

**therandomsinger13** (7.7): Simple. I just realized the post-chorus breakdown thing is a vocal sample of Lauren, so that’s cool.

**dymokc** (7.5): love the chord progression and snaps

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): this was cute

**robbiec\_** (7): even as filler this isn’t bad and I love Normani on this I want her to squeeze my throat shut

**janalng** (6.2): cute

#don't touch me

**Roxieloxie** (7): I mean it's cute, but It dosen't fit with the rest of the album

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): I was liking it until they said 'squeee-e-e-eeeze'

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Can't really remember but this sounded like

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): What...what is this lyricism? Squeeze? Who texts their partner 'Hey honey I'm crying rn pls squeeze me xoxoxo'. This sounds more like an ironic song about a strangler, but...alright. Aside from my misgivings about the title, I'm not sure I have any reaction towards this song; it sounds more like a solo ballad than a girl group project.

**surelychoo** (6): I've never heard anyone sing squeeze before and I think I know why now. Couldn't take it seriously when she sang squeheeEEHEEze and then the beat dropped.

**prettylilsloths** (5.5): I like Camila's more laid back tone in this, it's a lot more listenable. Overall it's a sweet song but just pretty forgettable

**CarlieScion** (5): Why are there so many weird and distracting production elements on this album??

**kappyko** (5): The album's pop drops are getting a little repetitive at this point

**Raykel** (5): The lyrics are just too awkward

**eklxtreme** (4): isleep

#Truther

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i can’t imagine anyone giving this pussy popper a 0

**PuggleMaster** (10): I'm shook i don't remember this album being this good omg

**Roxieloxie** (9): Another shocker. This sounds like a 2013 top 40 hit in the best way. I really like this

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Alright, this is the first song on the record after That's My Girl that I like. This is obviously very dependent on how Camilla sings the chorus, and while I have a feeling that her vocals may be divisive on this song, I actually love them; they're very unique, especially taking into account how generic this album can get. The way she just breaths the words and lets them slip from her mouth is gorgeous.

**robbiec\_** (8.3): this is the Lightning of this album what a bop. One thing I didn’t notice from this album as that the songs sort of blend into each other like this has elements of WOM and The Life

**twat\_brained** (8.2): NORMANI AT THE END BITCH I'M SHOOK

**1998tweety** (8.1): I like the verses but I'm not a huge fan of the chorus + beat drop.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8): Everything about this song just works except.... their harmonising (literally the most ironic girl group name ever). Some people might call the instrumental break bad, but I really like it. I like the premise, I like the chorus, I like the lyrics, I like everything except when Camila comes into the chorus. It’s not a knock on her (maybe it is) but the obvious nature of what the label was doing with her just makes me want to roll my eyes.

**therandomsinger13** (8): Fun! Good to sing along to.

**vayyiqra** (8): fuck I love the production on this album pure dance-pop perfection

**prettylilsloths** (7.5): A good song but it definitely needed more Ally (did she actually have any of her own solo lines??), more Lauren and less Camila

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7.5): invented signing the same track we same heard right before this one with an exaggerated drop

**dymokc** (7): okay pretty cool edm bop

**sn0wgaryen** (7): The choruses are getting better.

#Liar

**JanuraryFourteenth** (7): Whoever sings that part where she goes “BaaaAAAad “ should’ve been replaced instead of Camila.

**eklxtreme** (7): it's kinda generic I guess?

**followingfreeways** (6.5): this isn't bad but the way their voices sound in the chorus makes me uncomfortable and I cant quite explain it

**kappyko** (6): The chorus is kind of ass but i still cant say i have any other issues lol the drop is fun

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Soupy EDM drops and bad lyrics

**surelychoo** (5): I don't understand this song? are they trying to say that they're in denial that they're in love? also you know choruses don't have to one sentence repeated over and over and over again?

**janalng** (4.2): too much funky techno for me

**Raykel** (3.5): I'm usually on the side of liking Camila's voice but it just does not fit here. And that drop hurts my ears.

**letsallpoo** (3): the only thing more obnoxious and screechy than the drop here are camila's ad libs

**Uber-A** (3): I give it at least 3 because the beat drop is actually pretty cool

**VeganSquash** (3): the pop drop is meh, and again, this is generic. Also the synths are too loud.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this chorus production is so boring and then it switches to being irritating as fuck.

---
#YOLO

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is a motherfucking bop even though the lyrics are literally repetitive and this song is 90% Camila

**vayyiqra** (9): tbh love the production on this and infectious af chorus

**janalng** (8 . 7): reminds me of some other song but I don’t know which

**1998tweety** (8): I feel like the chorus could've gone a bit harder, so ultimately this song feels a bit lacking.

**kappyko** (8): Something about this really feels dated already but i like it still!!!

**therandomsinger13** (8): I always enjoyed this. Little repetitive. I was full on dancing by the end.

**twat\_brained** (8): "Eating good, gettin' lit" I live my life based on this alone; that's my ultimate goal and should be everyone else's tbh. Others may hate "The Life" but it surprisingly grew on me and is one of my favorite 5H tunes.

**eklxtreme** (7 . 5): this song is actually pretty dumb but it's very catchy

**robbiec\_** (7 . 4): this reminds me of 2008 when I was depressed because I was 11

**Roxieloxie** (7): Another case of a song not being terrible but not great

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): invented living

**dymokc** (6 . 5): a pretty cool trop pop track i guess

**patronsaintofaspies** (6 . 5): True story; I had trouble remembering this because the chorus was too similar to Work From Home. This is something of a guilty pleasure bop, especially since the parts of the chorus where they actually sing are great, but overall this is so similar to some of their other songs to the point where it doesn't stand out.

**prettylilsloths** (6 . 5): I'd forgotten about the weird autotune/dubstep effects they put on Camila's vocals in this and the fact that this might as well be a Camila solo song for the most part :/ Not bad but the fact that they really had lyrics saying 'eating good, getting lit' is amazing. I do still love the build up and drop of the beat in the last part of the song

#i want death

**CarlieScion** (6): I feel like I've heard this song a 1000 times before

**surelychoo** (6): Kind of repetitive and I still haven't figured out what the life is. This is my first time listening to the album and I can sense it's all very tropical/synth-y.

**VeganSquash** (6): catchy, generic.

**rotating3Dtext** (5 . 5): no!!

**gowestyoungkanye** (5): I hate the robotic chorus, which is unfortunately so much of the song it’s hard to ignore. In general, all of their vocals sound really robotic on this, which feels wrong given that I know they’re better than that (regardless of my own feelings about her, ah, choices, Camila does some pitch corrected vocal gymnastics on Work For Home).

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the mashup of this and that song from rugrats in paris >>>> the original

**sn0wgaryen** (5): That chorus was awful.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (4 . 5): This just doesn’t sound that good.

**Uber-A** (4): Makes me cringe.... That baby squeaking sound tho... Gross!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (2): I hate autotuned vocals used as instruments. Also the repetitive chorus is awful

#it got better

**fifthchevron** (10): I really appreciate that they wrote/sung a song about male insecurities because of outdated social norms. Wish there was more of this.

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Allie is the star of this song.

**janalng** (8.7): finally a not overproduced song, great tune

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Yay! Another good song! It's hard to believe that a ballad is my favourite track on a Fifth Harmony album, but I actually love this song's lyrical content; I know that it makes no sense because everybody singing here is a rich pop star, but I think that may make the concept of not choosing to leave your partner because of money problems much sweeter.

**prettylilsloths** (8.5): It's so nice to actually hear from Ally on this song(!!!). Kind of repetitive but a still a good song to chill out to

**Roxieloxie** (8.2): I let it slide on flex, but im taking point's of for the forced caribbean accents.

**1998tweety** (8.1): I really really wanted to give this song a high scores since there are bits of it that I really like, but at the same times this song has a few mistakes that add up and take away from the experience. First the verses repeat, like how hard is it to just write another one. Second the bridge is so so lazy, repeating the pre-chorus would have been better. Speaking of the pre-chorus, it sounds awkward at bits especially the one Lauren sings.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Bleachers outpeaked but lowkey still bops

**dymokc** (7.5): OMG ALLY'S VOCALSSSS IT'S SOO SOOTHING

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): A headnodder. The bridge is nice.

**robbiec\_** (6.8): another filler track but I can’t even call it bad I gave it less than Squeeze because it’s just a bit more generic even if it does slap

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): We can work without the perks, just you and me (Thug it out till we gonna get better)

**twat\_brained** (6): They had faith things would get better, which is honestly what 5H deserved :sadgery:

#it got worse

**vayyiqra** (7): production is fire as usual but this song does nothing for me especially good chorus though also Timbaland did the same concept first

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): it felt waaaay repetitive

**Uber-A** (6): I love the hook but that production is so fugly.

**gowestyoungkanye** (5.1): My initial feeling is ‘gonna get better’ is what I told myself about every abusive relationship I was in, and it’s a little hard to get past that. But ultimately it’s a song about them grappling with fame and saying that their man means more than wealth so that’s admirable, I guess. But I don’t understand where ‘gonna get better’ comes in. Like, wouldn’t the money make things better? Am I utterly brainwashed by capitalism? I don’t understand this song. Like, at all. What’s the issue. Does their respective mans not have jobs?? Is that it?????

**eklxtreme** (5): very forgettable

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): invented really weird vocal timing

**Raykel** (4.5): There's like nothing happening here

**surelychoo** (4): The girls securing their poor man demographic lol

**kappyko** (3.5): The lyrics to this aren't really good, and at this point I'm begging for a switch up.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a pussy popper

**sn0wgaryen** (10): Basic musical beat, but I like it.

**twat\_brained** (10): The late-2010s sound is apparent here with a 3-chord piano riff, the trop pop flavors and the vocal pitching. And 5H makes it sound fantastic. I don't see why these girls just didn't trend hop for S/T,

**gowestyoungkanye** (9): This is a song that just hits you where you live, and it’s a trop-bop to boot. I even like the break.

**vayyiqra** (9): okay idk what it is with this dance mix production but I can't get enough of it also this is such a bop they should've played this at Pride

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): So...please keep these good songs coming, Fifth Harmony... please...anyway, one thing I like about this song is the very stellar chorus; seeing the title, you'd probably expect it to be a ballad, and while this does fit into that category a bit, the hook 'Usually fearless/so why am I/scared of happy' is very, very catchy.

**1998tweety** (8.3): I feel as though I've written this comment before, another song that I like but gets ruined a bit by a beat drop.

**therandomsinger13** (7.7): Bop!

**dymokc** (7.5): okay this dance pop track is actually really catchy

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): invented contradicting emotions

**PuggleMaster** (8): ugh this drop is SO bad, but everything else is SOOOO good. Ugh i'm so conflicted

**strawberryswing1** (8): this started out super good but the drop is a......choice

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): I wasn't expecting that zigzag bass drop. Very nice touch

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i was feeling it but that weird nonononononononononononononononononono drop is just so out of place

**kappyko** (7): that drop is actually cool

**prettylilsloths** (6.5): The dubstep portion feels really out of place but Ally sounds beautiful on this so I forgive them

**janalng** (5.3): I was all positive and then I heard the chorus...

#Robbie why?

**robbiec\_** (7.9): THIS IS TRASH. AND I AM GARBADOR. i’m also scared of happy because when anything goes right in my life I always ruin it by the time anything challenges it because i’ve bothered myself with all the ways that it can be fucked up and all most every time the thoughts make me react in such a way that causes The Good Things downfall and I will never learn. My ability to learn from my overthought thoughts is as trash as the drop in this song. THIS BOP ABOUT THE BANE OF MY LIFE. This song is written about me even if Normani would hold her breath if I walked past her in the street because I am but a Trubbish I devolved during this rant about being scared of happy

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.6): What is it about this production that’s so haunting? I think it’s that persistent bell (is that what it is?) sound? It sounds like a pulse / ox monitor when you’re in the hospital actually. I really like this a lot. It’s so interesting, there’s so much going on, and not in an overwhelming way, either.

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is a nice song but I don't think its the best song to end the album with (I know No That Kinda Girl is the last track on the standard version and I don't think that's a good closer either). Big Bad Wolf was robbed and deserves 10s. (Ricki's note: BIG BAD WOLF IS NOT EVEN ON YOUTUBE HOW DID U WANT TO RATE IT)

**twat\_brained** (8.2): Used to love this but now I realize it's a bit basic and mellow. The girls use it to their advantage and it's easily in the better half of their discography.

**dymokc** (8): great song.

**vayyiqra** (8): surprisingly downbeat and introspective ending for these girls the depth ugh their minds

**janalng** (6): very monotone but not bad

#no way they liked this song

**Roxieloxie** (7): this song starts off like it's going to build up then it just falls flat

**eklxtreme** (6.5): not too exciting, it's just there

**surelychoo** (6): why is this entire album just great melodies and production with cheesy as hell lyrics??

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Not a bad song, per se; I just can't remember anything about it, aside from a line about an audience that has a double meaning, which is, I admit, clever. It's yet another boring closer, which is maybe why I'm annoyed by it. Closers need to be exciting, you know?

**kappyko** (4): Kind of an underwhelming outro

**Uber-A** (4): Ok...?

**JanuraryFourteenth** (3): NO WAY AM I LISTENING TO THAT AGAIN AMIRITE EHEHEHEHEHEHE

**SendMeYourSATScores** (3): invented talk-singing

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (7): I don't like their use of "dope" here, it reminds me of a Nick show using slang that people don't use anymore.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): The song deserved more recognition. In an album full of trop-pop songs that kind of sounded the same, this stood out for me for being a more chill song. I wish this was the direction 5H woukd have gone for, because as much as I like summer bops, I believe this kind of songs is when they truly shine through.

#pretty fucking dope

**ImADudeDuh** (10): honestly this track is so simple that I love it so much. Just saying "You're pretty fucking dope" is so sweet imo.

**prettylilsloths** (9.5): Probably my second favourite. The chilled atmosphere of the song is almost great and they all sound great but especially Normani & Lauren

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Very different but I like it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8.5): Ally Brooke shines on this

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): relatable

**1998tweety** (8.3): Really the only thing that makes this track stand out is the interesting sound effects used.

**PuggleMaster** (8): This song is pretty fucking dope

**surelychoo** (8): Love it! Such a chill song without having a drop just because, and the lyrics finally fit the vibe of the song!

**Uber-A** (8): LOVE that production!

**vayyiqra** (8): lyrics are a little cliche but the synth on this is great so whatever

**Roxieloxie** (7.6): Im sorry but the way the word fuck is forced into the chorus of this song makes me laugh to much to pay attention to the song

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Cute.

**dymokc** (7): is dope

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Hmm, we're decreasing in quality again. Compared to the previous three songs, this song is pretty plain; exactly what you'd expect from a Fifth Harmony song. Despite its flaws, I do genuinely enjoy it; I'm not sure who's singing here (roast me, I know it's not Camilla) but her laughs are cute. It's very much a song you enjoy at the end of the day.

**twat\_brained** (7): Anyone else find it hilarious that Lauren sings the chorus and she actually got caught with marijuana on a flight one time? Definitely a "high" point in her career :janet:

**VeganSquash** (7): oh, a creative song by Fourth Harmony? Wow I'm shook.

**Raykel** (6.5): Just by the title I thought this was gonna be awkward, but this is actually a really cute sentiment. They could've used a different word tho.

#don't do drugs

**eklxtreme** (6): what are these lyrics honestly

**robbiec\_** (6): this is kinda lame but also kinda good so

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): I'm glad it picks up towards the bridge because honestly this is pretty boring

**JanuraryFourteenth** (5): eh

**janalng** (4.1): dope? Nope.

**gowestyoungkanye** (4): This song really is a precursor to Gorgeous, and I hate Gorgeous, so I hate Dope.

**hikkaru** (3): “pretty fuckin’ dope” cringe

This song shrunk on me from the first time I heard it honestly. And Zayn hasnt impressed me with anything after his first album.

---
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I'm not even sorry I'm giving it this high of a score. I love this and it's still one of my favorites to this day (but Like I Would is better)

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the only relevant ZAYN song to the GP. Too bad because his debut album is actually good.

**poppinmmolly** (10): an undeniable bop that I didn't want to like

**Saucymac** (10): It's a shame that Yolanda had already left RHoBH with her fake Lyme because i'd much rather Zayn cameos than Cody fucking Simpson

**janalng** (9.3): as much as I personally dislike Zayn, this is a true hit

**1998tweety** (8.9): Another chill bop.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): this chorus is still so hard

**dymokc** (8): sexy track and great debut by ZAYN

**surelychoo** (8): Had no idea what he was saying half the time (e-nun-ci-ation, zayn bb) but love it anyways. very grandiose.

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): This song is actually my most streamed song of 2016 which is ironic because a few months after this came out zayn became my most hated artist of 2016

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): at first I couldn't understand a word

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): Zayn you fucking bitch. I don’t even want to talk about him, I swear to god. I have never seen someone so hellbent on destroying their own career. And the thing is, Pillowtalk is a bop. He really set such a high bar. It was really ‘okay Zayn wants to talk about fucking now’ but it’s a BOP and that makes up for it. God. FUCK OFF, ZAYTHAN.

**sn0wgaryen** (7): This was a good song for Zayn to show his style, however it is not his best.

**therandomsinger13** (7): Production is good. I remember trying really hard to avoid this song because I still despised anything 1D for absolutely no reason. Thinking about the music videos. Aw. RIP Zigi.

**vayyiqra** (7): this is okay idk forgettable

**robbiec\_** (6.7): it’s not bad but the video with all the flowers was such a desperate attempt to position Zayn as the Kidz Bop Weeknd and I guess it worked because... despite all the flowers he is the sex like Zayn actually looks like **that**

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): There was a period in my life (read: 2016) where I absolutely, positively hated this song and anything to do with Zayn, or should I say ZAYN. And, yeah, I'm still not a huge fan of his debut single, especially since his vocals are somewhat subpar (though they're not absolutely atrocious like they were in I Don't Want To Live Forever). But I can hear some spots where I like this song right now, and I do enjoy the production.

**prettylilsloths** (6.5): I'm still not really sure what he's saying in half of this song since his enunciation is so bad

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): It’s so big, yet I feel nothing.

**twat\_brained** (6): Not as big on this when it was released but I don't really get the hate for this song. If not for this rate I probably wouldn't have listened to it again but I don't think it's to be avoided like the Plague or anything.

**strawberryswing1** (5): this song just annoys me. Like I Would was such a bop though and I'm annoyed it got overlooked.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): will this lose

**hikkaru** (2): does this song have a melody?

**jimmy345960** (1): I hate this song, I hated it the first listen, and I hate it now

**kappyko** (1): I also hate this song... but this one is more out of radio overplay. I don't like the production and he sounds so whiny on this! I think "LIKE I DO" is a bigger bop.

**Uber-A** (1): I don’t like this song.

**Verdantshade** (1): zayn left the band dissing 1d for being too pop rock for his taste, yet he releases a pop song with rock influences as his lead single? not here for that. it's also incredibly boring and I have no idea how it went #1 because it's thoroughly unenjoyable

---
#idk what clued up means, so these are the good comments

**1998tweety** (10): One thing I really like about this song is that there's bits where 2 of the girls are singing together, that's pretty rare among LM's songs since its either 1 girl, all 4 of them, or 3 of them singing while 1 does adlibs. Not to mention its a cute song with a nice message.

**dymokc** (8): a cute song

**janalng** (8): Nice chorus with finally all four singing together

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Did somebody clue up? Resident detective fiction writer here! Jokes and nerdiness aside, I think this is the best bonus track on Get Weird that's completely original. It's obviously directed towards young adults, but unlike some of the other songs on this album, it's not as artificial as I dreaded it to be; the group manages to have enough charisma to pull an encouraging song like this off.

**sn0wgaryen** (8): Don’t care much for the lyrics, but their voices are great.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Interesting use of the millennial whoop after the second chorus. Also it's cute how this is merely an acoustic track compared to some of the bombasts on this album

**kappyko** (7.5): Sounds like something girls perform at talent shows lolol

**Uber-A** (7.5): It’s cute!

**poppinmmolly** (7): I hate the title of this song and how they have to make the hard "k" sound 3 times in a row it's ugly to listen to.

#these people didn't like it

**surelychoo** (7): It's good that the girls finally made peace with the breakup and became the wiser for it. <3

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Uh...okay?

**welcometoNY** (5): the guitar sound just doesn't really work for them

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): will someone harass me if i say this is lazy /indie shit/

**Raykel** (0): What the fuck happened here? Their voices don't blend well with a guitar. What makes it worse is the mixing, I can't even express how garbage it makes their voices sound. They're all mushed together... I just... I can't even write in all caps to show how disgusted I am I'm just... speechless....

#comparassions, woo!

**eklxtreme** (7.5): uh is this we are never getting back together

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Lol when this started I thought it was WANEGBT and got confused. This song is pretty good. I think it deserves more an acoustic guitar. It’s pretty generic. I still like it, though.

**vayyiqra** (7): yet another lower-tier Demi song wtf also get this acoustic guitar off my synthpop record nevertheless I don't hate it

**prettylilsloths** (6): It's kind of like a slightly more upbeat and Get Weird version of Little Me. A cute, meaningful bop but I feel like their voices on the chorus kind of clash or aren't mixed together super well

**Roxieloxie** (6): I thought this was a taylor swift song at first ngl. I feel like this song would work better if it wasn't acoustic

**VeganSquash** (6): call me crazy, but this sounds like Boo'd Up and Stay (by Post Malone) had a baby

**gowestyoungkanye** (4.2): This is Little Mix doing Taylor Swift and maybe that works for some people but absolutely not for me.

**robbiec\_** (3): I thought this was RED Taylor at first which is weird because this is the weakest song on the album

**Nerdy_boy_chris** (5): I hate that i can so clearly hear Jason's auto-tune in this. I never wanna hear it again.

**rickikardashian** (6.9): Am I shocked this is out so early on? No. The song itself isn’t bad, the production is really good and the girls’ vocals are outstandingly beautiful, but there’s just something that turns this song that could have been an easy 11, to a Day 1 song, and it’s the presence of Jason Derulo. I don’t know what I despise the most of his part in the song. The autotune is so obvious and annoying it makes the song barely listenable, and the fact that his parts explain that this “secret love” happens because he’s going out with a girl with a boyfriend just feels shallow, especially when in Pt. II we can see how other way the song could have gone.

---
#Secret love song

**dymokc** (10): This is the reason i became a little mix stan. I know most fans like part 2 better but i really appreciate the grand instrumentation and atmosphere on here. This is the perfect anthem and deserved 10x better. (fun fact: my homophobic dad liked this too despite disliking the lyrics lol even tho this version has a diff meaning)

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this has a really catchy hook

**sn0wgaryen** (10): I prefer Pt. II.

**janalng** (9.5): a tune where the girls voices can finally show off!

**1998tweety** (9.3): I know what all the comments are gonna be “smh Jason Derulo, homophobia”, but if I'm being honest this version is a massive bop too. Sure I prefer Pt.II, but and yeah I'd prefer if JD wasn't on this track but his singing is good.

**welcometoNY** (9): they really snapped with the vocals here. also I honestly don't even mind Jason Derulo here I think he sounds really good.

**kappyko** (8): i'm not into ballads, but this one is nice enough to justify its existence.

**robbiec\_** (8): this song is homophobic as if straight people need to hide their sexual desires, which this song is actually about, on the dance floor don’t make me laugh loo roll. Anyway this song is pretty cute regardless of its HOMOPHOBIA also I tried to make a vaporwave song sampling this once

**eklxtreme** (7.5): vocals are wonderful but everything about this screams mid, even the feature

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): why is this so much worse than Pt. II?

**rotating3Dtext** (7): I'm not used to hearing Jason Derulo in songs like this

**tf2manu994** (7): for the same reason

**gowestyoungkanye** (6.6): I’m a ballad hater. I just hate ballads if they don’t come from ballad-exclusive artists. But I like this song more than I always think I’m going to, I like the build up of the instrumentation, which works to cut through a lot of the ballad-y ness.

#Secret hate song

**Uber-A** (7): It’s cute I guess but it was never one of my faves.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): IDK, it's just kinda boring

**fifthchevron** (1): the worst "no homo" in pop history

**JanuraryFourteenth** (0): I actually like Jason Derulo and I still think this song is awful.

# #FUCKJASONDERULO

**therandomsinger13** (8): Oh no here are the tears. This song is pretty cheesy but I love it. It’s fun to dramatically dance to. Also fun to sing. I didn’t realize how auto tuned Jason Derulo was.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Uh, yeah, I have a hard time seeing Jason Derulo as anything other than the Wiggle guy and this highkey ruins the song for me, aside from his voice being nothing special. I actually really like the parts of this sonf that are just Little Mix, but when the Wiggle guy comes in it downgrades the song into another boring het ballad. No thanks.

**Verdantshade** (7): it's a fantastic song but i fucking can't stand jason derulo. in a perfect world a superior male vocalist would be on this

**twat\_brained** (6.5): "we got a love that is hopeless" …must resist Halsey reference. Also Jason's verse is honestly tragic. The fact that he needs a vocoder but Little Mix don't even touch it tells you everything about this song. Couldn't we have just kept Pt. 2?

**Raykel** (6): There is no reason for him to be here

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i didn’t expect the jason derulo feature to be the boring track, also -1 for that disgusting screech

**vayyiqra** (6): okay so this is a ballad and has a dude on it, whatever I guess

**CarlieScion** (5): Why would you ruin a perfectly good song by putting an autotuned Jason Derulo on it???

**static\_int\_husp** (5): A decent ballad brought down by Derulo and heteronormativity

**VeganSquash** (5): meh, Derulo is meh

**Roxieloxie** (4): This is honestly homophobic and it's all jasosn derulo's fault :/

**prettylilsloths** (2): I don't even normally hate Jason Derulo but to this day I don't understand why he was added as a feature on this song. It changed a song that very heavily hinted to be about LGBT love into a cheating song :(

**surelychoo** (1): Deleted this from my playlist because Jason Derulo had to come in with his unnecessary hetero feature. No offence but shut up Jason Derulo. Sick of straight angst.

I want nothing more than for my boys to get back together, but if they never do, I'm just glad I have this song. it might be cheesy, but this song makes me feel so much

**original\_doll** (10): a beautiful and special ballad, I love how this song shows off the guys' voices

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Okay, I know this melody from somewhere. I remember it being either a hymn or a folk song, but I doubt anybody's ever going to sue One Direction for this because you can tell that it's a very, very classic melody-again, it makes me think of a hymn. And I can tell why the melody is so familiar-it's perfect in small doses of songs, a somber, heartfelt set of notes that manages to get across legitimate sincerity. The vulnerability in this song is quite tangible, and I hope popheads refrains from sleepimg on it.

**Roxieloxie** (10): My favorite part about this song is the part towards the end where there 5 lines and 4 of them and they all sing one line and theres that 5th one left where zayn's should be.

**surelychoo** (10): thanks @Harry for my tears. I heard this live at his concert, but I won't be satisfied until I can hear the four of them do that refrain where they take turns singing one line each.

**Verdantshade** (10): harry absolutely slays the song and the bridge and quiet chorus after the bridge where the boys sing a line each is a highlight of the album

**welcometoNY** (10): ugh this album gets me so emotional

**janalng** (9.5): forgot how emotional this song makes me

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): why isn’t this titled “For Your Eyes Only”?

**sn0wgaryen** (9): I love the piano in this song. I love the concept of “for your eyes only” in songs.

**1998tweety** (8.3): This is a nice ballad, not much else to say besides that.

**CarlieScion** (8): This should've just been a Harry song. When he does it on his solo tour it's so much better

**prettylilsloths** (8): An intimate song, and a nice emotional song to slow down the pace of the album a bit. Some well written lyrics and a sweet song

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Goddammit I hate hearing the F major chord on piano now because I'm preconditioned to hear "Sign of the Times" whenever it plays.

**dymokc** (7.5): aww the lyrics

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): Pretty alright. I’m not 100% into the vocal at the start of the second verse. The bridge is nice. It feels like a Harry track and it says he wrote in the credits.

**eklxtreme** (7): slow but sweet

**fifthchevron** (7): Listen with headphones for the full heartbreak experience.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (6): I really like their voices more than I remember

# you should walk

**ImADudeDuh** (6): idk why, but this just sounds incredibly familiar to another song but idk whick one.

**vayyiqra** (6): oh great another dull ballad

**Raykel** (5.8): I'm bored but this is a little catchy

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (4): zzzzzz…..

**Uber-A** (4): Meh

**gowestyoungkanye** (3): I don’t like piano ballads, even if they’re 1D piano ballads. Points are higher because Liam and Harry sound good. Points are lower because where the fuck is Niall, sweetie.

**kappyko** (3): I'm never one for ballads, and hearing a ballad with a bunch of vocalists on it, and seeing that for some reason this is about Larry? I'm kind of annoyed.

**robbiec\_** (3): This is actually another gay anthem because gays can’t drive and wish they could fly rather than get get behind a wheel

**VeganSquash** (2): I am not a fan of these cheesy ass ballads about romance and shit

**SendMeYourSATScores** (1): actually, literally asleep

deleted: i know haha i think he should audible on more than three lines, if i could fly is his solo aesthetic to a t

it's not a 'he's not on it' where the fuck is he but a 'why isn't he on it more' where the fuck is he

if that makes sense

deleted: I'm guessing you listened to their solo work first before their group work? Because yeah they were always spread thin like this with the group. During their second album, the fans started a #letniallsing trend because he basically had zero solos. 

Also Harry wrote the song primarily so it's not exactly Niall's solo aesthetic.

#OMG MY SONG!!!

**vayyiqra** (11): HOLY SHIT THAT BASSLINE IS FIRE THIS BOPS SO HARD p.s. they did it again, Britney is shook

**poppinmmolly** (10): yas

**PuggleMaster** (10): a great song that i'm glad i discovered during this rate

**1998tweety** (9.2): Okay this is a huge bop and I know you guys are gonna do it dirty.

**followingfreeways** (9): stop I know people are gonna trash this song and it's gonna go out on the first day probably but I think this is suchhhh a bop, it would be a 10 but the fact that they say "oh my gosh" instead of "oh my god" really bugs me for some reason

**robbiec\_** (9): we did not need “Grown” and “I Love You” this should have come right after Hair this is a banger

**dymokc** (8.5): Most probably part of the original batch of music written alongside Pretty Girls. Slick hook and fun track.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): love this beat, this is one of the most modern sounding songs

**original\_doll** (8.5): the chorus is an oops! ripoff but issa cute song

**therandomsinger13** (8.5): What a fun bop! Kinda stupid but I don’t care it’s great. I was dancing the whole time. I remember changing the post-chorus to say banana instead of oh na na.

**Roxieloxie** (8): My favorite thing about this song is how they say gosh instead of god. It's so funny to me how weirdly censored LM is like they'll sing a song about car sex but yet cant say the work fuck. Like who is the audience they want to reach?

**VeganSquash** (8): a bit weird tbh, but it's grown on me

**twat\_brained** (7.3): WHAT A FUCKING HOOK! I just wish the verses could hold up just as well.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): oh ma gash

**gowestyoungkanye** (7): Obligatory just say ‘oops I did it again’. I really do love this song, I love the production, the playful lyrics, their vocals are on point, it’s much better, and it’s a little menacing too? Step on me, mamthers.

#OH MY GOD I HATE THIS

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): we’ve entered filler territory

**kappyko** (6): At first I was enjoying the dumb fun on this album, but now it's starting to get just dumb :(

**sn0wgaryen** (6): Catchy music but the lyrics are eh.

**Uber-A** (5.5): Skip!

**ImADudeDuh** (5): kinda annoying

**welcometoNY** (5): this is kinda where the album starts to falter

#just name dropping other pop girls

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): It's like a mashup between Summertime Sadness and Oops I Did It Again (Ricki's note: .....what)

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The first time this came on I was left scratching my head and saying 'God, what is this trash Britney ripoff?'. But now, I see the error of my ways...well, kind of. It's a little messy, but it's a bit of a guilty pleasure; the mild campiness is genuinely entertaining, although the rhythm and vocals get annoying occasionally.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): if you told me this was a charli xcx song i would’ve believed you

**janalng** (6.8): Some Gwen Stefani vibes

**prettylilsloths** (6): This song has such a Charli XCX 2012 vibe to it and I like it, but only in small doses. Perrie stands out on this one I think.

**strawberryswing1** (3): camila outsold

**surelychoo** (3): Charli XCX? LOL. WTF.

#the beggining

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): queens of knowing the state of their success

**Roxieloxie** (9): :') I love their friendship so much

**sn0wgaryen** (9): Great way to end the album.

**therandomsinger13** (9): But can your fave a capella TWICE??? I like how this a nice little LM history with some motivation.

**gowestyoungkanye** (8.9): I really do love you, Little Mix. I really do. I promise. Thank you for being you.

**dymokc** (8.5): this is the fucking beginning little mix will be the only group standing in 2199 mark my words

**twat\_brained** (8.2): Literally ended Destiny's Abortion

**surelychoo** (8): More a capella harmonies!!! A very nice complement to The End to cap off the deluxe album. Really nice placement, better than I can say for the rest of the album.

**1998tweety** (7.7): Honestly this song is meh and even I feel like it was unneeded.

**prettylilsloths** (7.5): This is the more grown up version of Always Be Together and they sound beautiful. I especially love the lines 'Let's take it back to where we first began / They turned us strangers into closest friends' since it rings so true. It's super short though so it's more like a snippet than a song

**robbiec\_** (7.5): it’s so odd that they put this at the end and it made me want to restart with Black Magic again

**Uber-A** (7.5): Cute!

**kappyko** (6.5): The concept of a track dedicated to their history on the X factor is a little weird lol it's not bad

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): aw that was kinda cute though

#the end (im bad choosing titles, sorry)

**welcometoNY** (6.5): the harmonies are nice but it doesn't really make sense as a closing song

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): Kind of a boring closer should have stuck this one in the middle of the tracklist

**original\_doll** (6): I feel like they only added this because they realized last minute they needed one more song for the deluxe edition

**vayyiqra** (6): ironically the ending and too short to make an impact p.s. coming for Dua Lipa

**janalng** (5.9): cute story of their beginning but quite a bit boring

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the END outpeaked

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Yeah, this is nowhere as memorable as The End. Clued Up would have by far and away made a better closer on the deluxe edition. I find the idea of ending an album with this sort of title kind of cheesy, and it being a meh quality song doesn't help matters. I wouldn't be able to distinguish this from a regular, boring interlude.

Khalid is boring and he brings down the song.

---
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This is slicker than a snake covered in oil

**gowestyoungkanye** (10): Bloody love this song. It’s gorgeous. Khalid and Normani have heaps of chemistry as vocalists and as a pair. I’ve always rooted so so so hard for Mani, and I’m so glad she gave me a song I could root for the way I have. There’s something that’s just so lovely about how they sing ‘waste a day and spend the night’. And the video is a stunner too. Dancing queen and the king of El Paso. Love love love it.

**JanuraryFourteenth** (10): Normani has such a nice voice

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): not to add to the Khalid hatejerk (i literally haven’t listened to his album yet, and I’m indifferent about him), but noah fence I can’t stand Khalid’s vocals here

**twat\_brained** (8.9): This is the solo debut Camila wishes she could've had. Also Khalid sounds better here than he does on most of his songs. Anyway KEEP STREAMING IT SO WE CAN GET IT TO GO TOP 20

**1998tweety** (8.7): A chill bop.

**dymokc** (8.5): the kind of repayable bop that doesn't stand out much but is addictive. Normani is coming for our wigs.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Before hearing this song, I'd always disliked any piece of music Khalid ever touched-whether it was Young, Dumb, and Broke or his verse in the Homemade Dynamite remix, something about his cracky voice just turned me off considerably. By some miracle, however, this song actually sounds really good to me. Perhaps it's because his voice's improved, but the melody drones on excellently for both him and Normani and this track ends up sounding genuinely tempting.

**eklxtreme** (8): love the smooth vibes and the production on this

**rickikardashian** (8): .5

**Roxieloxie** (8): We stan black pop excellence in this house. Also this song was on the love simon soundtrack, so if you hate this song not only are you racist but you also hate gay people

**strawberryswing1** (8): if i'm being critical this is superrrrr generic but then it hooked me

**vayyiqra** (8): don't care about Khalid but justice for Normani, thicc legend, one of the most promising 5H girls

**robbiec\_** (7.8): Normani shines here but with a bit of dim

**original\_doll** (7.5): would be better w/out Khalid tbh

**poppinmmolly** (7): eh

**sn0wgaryen** (7): It’s a bit lackluster. I expected more from this collaboration.

**surelychoo** (7): very cool something something industry plant

**Uber-A** (7): it’s fine

**therandomsinger13** (6.7): Idk kinda boring. I went to listen to this on YouTube when it came out but I’m pretty sure I quit halfway through.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): i hate this songwriting fml

**janalng** (6.3): Normani doesn’t get to shine at all

**kappyko** (6): This is a cute R&B tune but Khalid edges towards annoying on this.

**prettylilsloths** (2): I really wanted to like this song. I loved Khalid's album and even though I'm not the biggest fan of Normani's voice I want her to succeed but this? It just isn't working for me. It's so boring

**Verdantshade** (1): can khalid disappear? he has the most uninteresting voice and songs for a pop artist

**rickikardashian** (10): Maybe it’s because I don’t mind repetitive pop and hoe anthems, but it surprises me this is a Day 1 song. I thought this would go even further just by being their biggest hit, but it seems like overall people just don’t enjoy repetitiveness and [messy performances](https://youtu.be/jcU1tIJe3xM?t=2m3s) of this song

#What the actual fuck Robbie

**robbiec\_** (11): I fucking loathed this song, This wasn’t Work by Rihanna and Drake. What the fuck is this repetitive nonsense? Then deeper into summer we got and this song would come on the radio often and I’d gradually like it more and more. Then I heard it in the club. Now, as a closet bisexual apparently I come off as masc sometimes (I do not believe this I am pretty camp) so my dancing was pretty confined. This song came on, I was fucking plastered - my mojito; in hand, my ass; fat - SLAMMED INTO the tilled floor and my knees brought me back to the realm of the living. I had just discovered the slut drop, the verse had started again and work work work was coming. “YOU AINT GOTTA GO TO WoOoOork (noOoo)” Camila warbled, AGAIN MY ASS WAS GOING DOWN, BAM. What is this feeling? anyway this song is wrong and right in so many ways and side note this year The Middle is my ‘Work from Home’ in that I used to hate it but I’m addicted now

#DO YOU WANT TO MAKE 25$/HOUR IN THE COMFORT OF YOUR OWN HOME???!!!!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This song was my summer 2016. The CD player in my car was broken so I had to listen to the radio and this was on constantly. Nostalgia plays a big role here.

**fifthchevron** (10): The one true Bop.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the economy has never been the same (by camila cabello) since this song was unleashed to the workforce

**PuggleMaster** (10): a little overrated but still a bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): invented jobs

**twat\_brained** (10): Invented construction and made me realize these girls did not come to play after Reflection. Also the collab introduced Lauren to someone she genuinely seems to be in love with, so that's another plus :) Also I like Camila's runs at the end. Fight me.

**1998tweety** (9.6): I wanted to give this a 10 but I feel like there's something missing. The chorus is kind of monotone tbh.

**janalng** (9.5): we must admit, Issa true bop

**kappyko** (9.5): reminder of THAT performance of "work from home"

**vayyiqra** (9): gotta go to work work work work work work work queens of repetitive bops

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I love that performance when they pretend to drill and hammer that construction vehicle. timeless production on this.

**VeganSquash** (8.5): It's catchy but god-damn do I hate this song. It has no substance and is devoid of creativity.

**dymokc** (8): okay i have to admit i hated this when it came out but it grew on me now i dont mind it it's low key a bop

**surelychoo** (8): iconic and for good reason. Every part of this song is so pleasing to the ear, even the feature (unlike LM features lmao).

**rotating3Dtext** (7): haha sex is work

**Raykel** (6.5): I love the erh in the second chorus. THE pop moment of 2016.

#Working 9 to 5, what a way to make a living

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): I thought I managed to somehow avoid this song during the peak of its popularity, but apparently not, because I recognise the 'work, work, work' part. Or maybe it's because Down is a cheap reboot of this song. Either way, this isn't a great song, but I wouldn't mind hearing it at a party. (Though, let's be honest, why would I attend a party?)

**franklytheturtle** (6): This activates my fight or flight response (Ricki's note:idk what this means but i sounds negative so yeah)

**gowestyoungkanye** (5.3): It is iconic. Mani dancing on the tractor thing in the music video has awakened the sexualities of many baby wlws. But... it loses me because I hate my strong girls being reduced to ‘you’re the boss at home’ (like, I’m a sub too, but please). Maybe I’m PC / cancellation culture gone mad or whatever, and it is about a consensual adult relationship, but I can’t shake my dislike of that line especially after That’s My Girl.

**CarlieScion** (5): I couldnt decide if this was a 0 or a 10 so i gave it a 5

**therandomsinger13** (4.5): Oh my gosh I am so tired of this.

**jimmy345960** (4): SORRY, i never liked this. yikes

**sn0wgaryen** (4): Putting out a song that repeats the word “work” the same year as Rihanna was not a good idea, even if the songs sound completely different.

**prettylilsloths** (3): This is still such a generic and basic song I can't believe it was so popular tbh. The chorus is really just non existent

**ImADudeDuh** (1): absolutely fucking not. a terrible song.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): I don't get this song. I think they were trying to be sexy here, but with how bland the song is it comes across without any punch or impact. Also the lyrics don't really help, or the amount of repetition, or the track, or really anything about the song.

**Darkra01** (0): they should've stayed home and have released this trash

**hikkaru** (0): this is probably biased by hearing this everywhere a couple years ago but... this song is just the WORST. I hate the instrumental on this so much and the rent-a-rapper does not help it one bit

**Roxieloxie** (0): It's funny. Listening to this song I remember why I like He like that so much, It's this song but without crayola's vocals at the start. Also It gets annoying after a while

**static\_int\_husp** (0): I will forever maintain that this is one of the most annoying choruses in a 2010s pop song.

**Uber-A** (0): This song must pay for what it has done.

**Verdantshade** (0): why does this song even exist

**welcometoNY** (0): I once watched a youtube video that pointed out the panting noise in the production and it made this song unlistenable (although it had plenty of problems before that tbh)
