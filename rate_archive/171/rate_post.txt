St. Ratrick's Day Rate (aka Redemption Rate II)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/11tsnx1/st_ratricks_day_rate_aka_redemption_rate_ii/

Hello faithful popheads, and welcome to the very first celebration of [St. Ratrick’s Day!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/782381546749165629/1086052256895467613/image.png) 

Myself and the wonderful u/akanewasright are here to host a rate the likes of which have never been seen, combining two of the most successful and well-remembered popheads minirates of days past, [The Redemption Rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ifgwkh/the_redemption_rate_due_97/) and [Ratemas!](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/rfodd4/its_ratemas_time/) St. Ratrick's Day aims to celebrate the forgotten songs of rates past, whether it's a personal niche favourite, or a song that missed out on being included in a precious All Stars rate.

Over the past 2 weeks, a variety of rate regulars have hosted a series of challenges and games on the [popheads discord](https://discord.gg/popheads), along with spreading the teachings of the benevolent Saint Ratrick (they/them), who developed the art of assigning arbitrary numerical values to songs, a practice beloved by queers everywhere. The 13 different games each had 3 slots up for grabs, in which the winner could send a previously rated song of their choice for a chance at redemption that it never got. 

Those with keen eyes among you may notice that this rate in fact has 40 songs. The extra song in this case is the one and only [Closer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0zGcUoRlhmw). It quite blatantly breaks the rules of [eligible songs](https://github.com/RandomHypnotica/Eligible-Songs/wiki/Songs) that winners could choose from, so why was it included? Well, simply put, it was divine intervention from above. Ratrick quite enjoys seeing a good controversial entry, and [each](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/642hxl/rate_reveal_the_2016_ep_rate_day_1_lets_ride/dfz06p5/) and [every](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ak4fh7/edmpop_girl_collabs_rate_reveal_day_2_losing_my/ef1ryfh/) [single](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/f7fssf/all_stars_3_rate_reveal_day_1_hallelujah_amen/fib62qn/) [time](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/fi6rve/billboard_hot_100_decadeend_songs_of_the_2010s/fkfsguy/) it has been [rated](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/liih3b/all_stars_4_reveal_day_1_gave_my_11_to_a_stupid/gn3hhrg/) so far, the opinion only seems to become more divisive.

However, the last time it was rated was over 2 years ago, and since then the rate landscape has changed dramatically. Overall averages seem to be higher, and rates have a whole new array of regular participants who have never been able to witness the miracle of Closer, a song that seems almost impossible to come to a consensus on. Ratrick appeared to both of the hosts in a dream and delivered clear instructions to include the song in the rate, and as loyal followers, we simply had no choice but to listen. We hope that you can appreciate and understand the lesson that Ratrick is teaching here.

Without further ado, here are the songs included:

# Rules

* You must listen to and score every song in the rate. Ballots with missing scores will not be accepted.

* Your scores must be on a scale from 1 to 10 and can include one decimal place but no more. So 8.2 is fine but 8.25 is not.

* You may give one song in the whole rate a score of 11 and one other a score of 0. If you want to award these scores, save them for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate, respectively.

* We encourage you to leave comments of your general thoughts or reasoning behind your scores on any songs you wish. If you choose to do so however, they must be in this format, simply leaving one space after your score:

> The Chainsmokers - Closer (feat. Halsey): 10 I’m so glad we’re finally rating this hidden gem!

Any other format such as:

> The Chainsmokers - Closer (feat. Halsey): I’m so glad we’re finally rating this hidden gem! (10)

> The Chainsmokers - Closer (feat. Halsey): 10 - I’m so glad we’re finally rating this hidden gem!

will cause the rate machine to break! Oh no!

* Your scores will not be confidential and will be revealed, along with any comments, with your username attached.

* We reserve the right to reject ballots with ludicrously lopsided and/or lazy scores that may indicate sabotage against one artist or another. If you are worried of your harshness being perceived as sabotage, leave comments to explain yourself!

* You may change your scores up until the deadline by messaging u/RandomHypnotica or u/akanewasright on Reddit or Discord.
