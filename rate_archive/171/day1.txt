**akanewasright** (10): I can't say I'm very surprised by this placement, or even very disappointed with it, despite giving it a confident 10. I've summed up my thoughts on 4'33" previously, but in summary: I really love the idea of pushing the boundaries of what music is, and asking people to engage with silence and ambient noise as music... that's kind of badass. This song has made a lot of people very angry over the years, and many of them have looked very silly (in my opinion), but I can't really blame them. There isn't much here to latch onto here musically, you kinda either get it or you don't. As funny as it would be for this to beat literally anything in the rate, it's also funny that two people 11d literal silence and wrote a novel and an essay defending that. Can't really get mad about that.

**RandomHypnotica** (1): yeah this never stood a chance. For a majority of the rate, this song actually had an over 4 controversy score and was a clear record breaking entry, but now it’s fell to a pathetic 4th highest. I for one do not appreciate the gesture of this performance art, hence the low score, but I can respect those who do, i just wish it was a touch more divisive.

*submitted by u/mysario*

**mysario** (10): *before "The Halloween Puppet Show", before "Dopesmoker", before "Earth", we had... silence. So much has changed since the original charity rate in 2017, especially the Popheads landscape. I'm sure most of the people who are around these days don't know this masterpiece. I think it's one of the first "songs" I ever gave an 11 to. This will always be one of the greatest shitpost submissions (thanks to the absolutely amazing hosts) and it's about time it got some respect! Plus, think how funny it is how some songs didn't just get rated worse than silence but are gonna get rated worse than silence *twice*!*

# A Moment of Silence

**anothertown** (10): art hoes get behind me

**apatel27** (10): Is it pretentious art? yeah but is it also iconic? yeah

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): […]

**bogo** (10): since the intention of this song was to let the background noise around you act as music while this song was playing i just paid attention to the sounds outside my window and it was really soothing and meditative, 10/10 would do again

**bulforster** (10): for how hard the conductor in that one vid commits and my ambient noise was a train going past on the rail line outside my place which is a sound I really like

**Catrick** (10): this is “no thoughts, head empty” at its purest.

**cremeebrulee** (10): dead to me was actually a jumpscare when it started

**CrimsonROSET** (10): HIS NOSE LOOKS LIKE A DOWN ARROW

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): more hyperpop than Aqua tbh

**flava** (10): the peak of music

**frogaranaman** (10): this is gonna have a higher average than most of Midnights

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I’m so mad I didn’t know what the hell was going on that I decided to protest giving this a full score

**impla77** (10): I hope this beats another submission (that’s not mine)

**jay** (10): girl we gagged

**jman457** (10): just here to raise the controversy score

**just\_thonking** (10): 4'33" equals 4 feet 33 inches which equals 6 feet 9 inches... nice

**kvothetyrion** (10): **steps up to the mic** ahem: it may not mean nothin’ to y’all, but understand that nothing was done for me

**pijus41** (10): always have this stuck in my head

**qazz23** (10): ㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤㅤ·

**Roxieloxie** (10): id just think it be funny if this outlasted certain submissions

**sarcasticsobs** (10): ambientheads, lemme hear you make some (ambient) noise!!!!

**starla\_** (10): I love peace and quiet

**static\_int\_husp** (10): camp

**Uberpigeon** (10): silence outsold your fav

**vayyiqra** (10): Was going to make my comment "[...]" as a bit, but instead going to say (keeping it short because I know there are at least two full-length essays on this piece) that it's simply genius ... you cannot know what something is without knowing what it *isn't*, including music. I know John Cage was into the *Yi Jing* and Chinese philosophy, and I used to be into the *Dao De Jing* myself and know that's a very Daoist way of looking at things. See the ☯️ symbol ... note the opposites. Therefore is silence the opposite of music, or can it *be* music? And does silence ever truly exist? Maybe in the void of space. Deep stuff. My brother is a classical musician and John Cage stan so I've known of this for a long time, but there's still much to ponder about the simplicity of a song that's "nothing" and yet it's also "something" ... 🤔

**bookthieving** (9): 10 because i'm listening to my dog's asthmatic breathing, -1 because i start panicking thinking spotify glitched every time this comes on shuffle

**shipperondeck** (9): you know what? i dont care. this is a slay

**DirtyRat583** (8): this is good because i can imagine this is any song i want it to be, which means i can imagine it is good

**Frajer** (7.3): I totally understand John Cage's artistic vision hence me getting my score by adding 4 and 3 and using the extra 3 after the decimal point

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): look, in a world where all music is easily accessible from your pocket, I would argue that 4’33” actually becomes impactful because it makes you sit in silence and consider your surroundings and your use of noise and/or distractions. That said, I listened to this in an airport and someone’s child started crying so it put me in a wee bit of a bad mood. I didn’t dock points for that, but I do think there’s a discussion to be had on whether 4’33” has aged well as a discussion of whether silence is real and outgrown the context in which it was originally recorded.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): I mean........................yeah.

**1998tweety** (6): im not hearing anything so maybe this song is blocked in my country?? I'll give it a cute 6 so hopefully that doesn't shift the average too much.

**jasannn** (6): hold on i think im hearing something

**welcome2thejam** (6): Was originally gonna comment all the sounds I heard around me in the silence but I forgot I was wearing noise-cancelling headphones

**pig-serpent** (5.5): I'm not sure how you're supposed to rate a thought experiment like this.  I'm glad it exists because someone had to do it, but if I rated it as music I'd have to give it a low score because I don't enjoy it?  I guess I'll give it my abstention score.

RandomHypnotica: #...

**emayzee** (5): me in high school when it was socratic seminar day

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this is actually better than a lot of songs so I cannot score it any lower than a 5

**jsonphile** (5): so the first time I listened to this song, I was at the gym. Now the sounds of the gym are not pleasant, 2/10. The second time I heard it, I was going for a nice walk outside, the wind was blowing, birds were chirping, lovely sounds, 9/10. So we’ll just split the difference and give this a 5 because if it all depends on the sounds you hear when no music is playing, that could sound lovely or sound like ass.

**kwcty6888** (5): ????? I honestly don't know how ot rate this

**memezaharamole** (5): makes you think. (i don't want to think rn)

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): um

**Stryxen** (5): one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen Seventeen eighteen nineteen twenty twenty one twenty two twenty three twenty four twenty five twenty six twenty seven twenty eight twenty nine thirty thirty one thirty two thirty three thirty four thirty five thirty six thirty seven thirty eight thirty nine forty forty one forty two forty three forty four forty five forty six forty seven forty eight forty nine fifty fifty one fifty two fifty three fifty four fifty five fifty six fifty seven fifty eight fifty nine sixty sixty one sixty two sixty three sixty four sixty five sixty six sixty seven sixty eight sixty nine seventy seventy one seventy two seventy three seventy four seventy five seventy six seventy seven seventy eight seventy nine eighty eighty one eighty two eighty three eighty four eighty five eighty six eighty seven eighty eight eighty nine ninety ninety one ninety two ninety three ninety four ninety five ninety six ninety seven ninety eight - okay dead to me started. I did that to pass the time i was so bored

**vexastrae** (5): if i rate any song in this rate lower than 5 that means i would rather listen to literal silence than the song in question. anyways i would like for all my haters to conduct this piece for an indefinite amount of time thank you

**hunnybee12** (4.3): i disconnected my carplay twice thinking it was fucking up wow

**JIRACHl** (4.3): I just KNOW if I were in the audience I would've probably farted and it'd end up in the recording.

**phonethephoenix** (4.3): would've been more meditative if I wasn't driving home from work

**plastichaxan** (4.3): When the dogs started to bark omg that was so Fiona Apple coded

**Poydoo** (4.3): This is the musical equivalent of "touch grass"

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4.3): this is one to turn UP in the headphones!

**TiltControls** (4.3): i know, i'm a comedic legend

**bigbigbee** (4): it’s pretty cool as a concept and honestly whenever it came on in the playlist it took me maybe 30-60 seconds to realize I was alone with my thoughts, and then I had a cute little moment of introspection. That being said, these songs are hard to rate, and I don’t think I could in good conscience score this any higher than this. Oh wait I mean four-point-three hyuk hyuk hyuk

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): my roommate played the middle by zedd during this so..

**ImADudeDuh** (3): https://i.imgur.com/IOr6lrG.png

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): this is 0 bait and i will not fall for it!! i actually like it as an artpiece/concept like "the song is the ambience, appreciate it" but at the same time id so much rather listen to donttrustme so like,, sorry girl you lose

**pleasegivemeasword** (2.5): sometimes silence is needed

**dreamingpastel** (2): I see the vision, but I still thought Spotify broke

**shadowtheweedhog** (2): this really freaked me out i didnt like it get it away from me immediately

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): what song will place below 4'33 of silence

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.8): ‏‏‎ ‎ ‏‏‎ ‎ ‏‏‎ ‎

**indie\_fan\_** (1.5): [ ̶B̶R̶E̶A̶K̶I̶N̶G̶ ̶M̶Y̶ SILENCE... ]

**thedoctordances1940** (1.2): i made it about 12% of the way into this song before skipping hence my score

**Ambrosia42** (1): the lovely background sounds of my tinnitus

**babadork** (1): I never thought that I would find a song that sounds worse on noise cancelling headphones.

**imbaby122** (1): john cage you will NEVER be famous. the only reason i’m not 0ing this is bc it’s kinda funny the first time u hear it. the novelty maaaajorly wears off.

**moonagenightmares** (1): lol

**nooodisaster** (1): When the controversy score gets ruined by people rating this 4.3

**oscarbrierley1** (1): im not wasting my zero on silence

**ReallyCreative** (1): I looked on Wikipedia and it says this song is actually the environmental noise that is going on while you listen, unfortunately in my case this happened to be a vacuum cleaner

**seanderlust** (1): SALINA MOVE

**slimboyfriend** (1): I’d rather listen to this than Closer again

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): this joke died the first time

**throwaway-7650** (1): I'd give this a 10 if it was the meme rate itself but alas...

**TragicKingdom1** (1): I dislike my internal monologue sorry

**Adavman** (0): There is only one score fitting of this “song”

**bluetriangles04** (0): I really thought my headphones had died... or broke in someway... then I heard somebody step or something and I really bet they had a stern talking to that person after the recording ended like "John are you fucking serious?"

**hikk** (0): whoever sent this is truly doing charity work so less ppl have to see their pet fave song get zeroes

**krusso1105** (0): I made it 2 minutes in before realizing my playlist didn't in fact stop, it had just gotten to this song

**lexiareder** (0): I don't want to put too much thought into this, so 0 and move on

**Nagisoid** (0): I haven't had good experiences with silence in my life. Sorry Mr. Cage, I know you were a gay avant-garde icon but I just can't with this

**NotWith10000Men** (0): 3edgy5me

**runaway3212** (0): Silence is for losers fuck y'all

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): I'm so angry there's a few songs in this rate that could deserve my 0 but I am NOT letting this waste of my time and waste of a song slot get anything other than the lowest score possible

RandomHypnotica: #their comment was so long it needed it's own comment

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (11): Saintly 11 dispatched to probably the second best song of all time; right ahead of Leonard Cohen on the record but just behind Happy Birthday (i love happy birthday everyone sings it to me on my special day!). i can't trust this rating body to understand or reflect what resonates here or actually care to take the time to read a book on such things and tease out a different type of music listening. there is something profound of Cage realizing this piece halfway through his life and dying ROUGHLY 40 years and 33 days later. he spent a decade recalibrating his brain and learning of Zen when you didn't have that access in the 40s, he was building thought processes that are more apparent now and somewhat taken for granted. Truly, 4'33" reflects a significant vibe shift in the 20th century, a shift out of modernism and into (a very ascended, highest tier of) post-modernism; that was something immediately apparent when I discovered the piece in a college aesthetics course and then the following fall wound up reading Childhood's End, an Arthur C. Clarke pulp SF novel that thematically is obsessed with "have we reached the end of what we can do? is to transcend impossible?". 4'33" never comes up, but it always felt like a specter that loomed over the nuclear fallout that plagues humanity by that novel's end. I will never not be fascinated by this kind of shit my mind draws out to me that is typed into a text box. As a result of this being reselected (marmite, did you do it because you wanted to keep your bottom 11 flop streak going? or were you trying to get something out of me? if it wasn't you, I know someone dm'd me or told me but I wasn't listening. im just glad it was here when dopesmoker couldn't be), I decided to read Kyle Gann's "No Such Thing as Silence". It provides the layers of context that confirm not just the dada reading (There lies an immense humor to the fact that John Cage loved to say shit like "the silent piece is one of the only pieces I go back to". Like it is just an absolute dada sentiment) but that this was something that was eventually going to happen; the societal forces and where Cage was headed just happened to meet in late August 1952. Cage was radically sincere about trying to get outside of European composition ideas and consider composing from a uniquely American x Zen perspective based around chance and tinkering with all aspects of the form; the man's father was a tinker and it reflects an ethos of homemade fuckery from tuned pianos to water walk. He had spent a decade wrapped in thought that went from Thoreau to Suzuki to Black Mountain College and even a Harvard Anechoic Chamber (no one knows when he visited), contemplating if anyone at Muzak might purchase a 4 and a half minute silent piece or if such a thing was really attainable. When he was given the chance to perform new compositions in Woodstock, at one of the poorest points in his life (he sold stock in his chance works on the street), as part of a benefit concert, with a murderer's row of accomplices he'd spend his life with or building off of. This wasn't a fucking prank even if it was rooted in dada. No one can quite figure out how long it took to "write", but cage may have been actively swiftly as a result of A) the Anechoic chamber teaching him "there is no such thing as silence" (thus the original title that floated around "Silent Prayer" was dropped) & B) being exposed to Rauschenberg's White Painting from 1951 at Black Mountain College. As soon as I read that and looked at the sheet music (the 4'33" length comprised of 3 movements was determined based off of I Ching chance mechanics was applied to large charts of sounds, durations, dynamics, tempo and densities; he'd used it Music of Changes) and I realized he was just making White Paintings on a sheet. EUREKA! He had taken an art world movement happening around him and slotted it into compositional music to make the point he needed to. I love most art that does that; there is something spiritual there. And out of that duration comes a chance to recognize the way the sounds around you can play off of the music you listen to. When I walk around and listen to my hyperrealist Orange Milk or whatnot, I can hear the sounds play off and how it changes every listen from where I am at. When I smoke my morning bowl I reflect on the random construction, chainsaw, or bird sounds. I too, return to 4'33" daily like Cage I believe. The sounds are always there waiting for me, and from that will come the second half of the 20th century and its musics that cannot escape this simple point that now, feels taken for granted; the start of a spiritual revolution. It is, my second favorite song of all time and a perfect 11 to watch die in last place I suppose.

RandomHypnotica: #and THIS was so long it needed TWO...

**Raindrac** (11): You're probably wondering at this very moment: "Why did you give 4'33" an 11? You're joking right? It's nothing. It's not even music."

 And let me assure you here and now, I'm not joking. I've enjoyed 4'33" more than anything else in this rate. I'll describe how I've reached the conclusion that I should give 4'33" an 11 later on, but first, let's discuss what 4'33" even is. 



 4'33" is a silent composition written by John Cage that encourages us to open ourselves up to the sounds around us and experience the continuous beauty of the aleatory world in which we live in. It takes advantage of how we approach music to by using a composition to create a metaphorical frame around four minutes and thirty-three seconds of sound, a frame supposed to guide our attention towards the sound within. 



 It remains a controversial and frequently discussed piece to this day, raising questions about the very definition of both music and art. But from what I understand, that wasn't the sole intention of John Cage— maybe not even an intention at all. I couldn't find any quotes from John Cage where he referred to 4'33" as music, something that led me to believe that it wasn't an attempt to push the boundaries of what music is. Guiding our attention towards the sound around us by applying the frame of composition around "nothing" appears to have been the goal of 4'33". 



 > DUCKWORTH: Well, the traditional understanding is that it opens you up to the sounds that exist around you and... 

 > 

 > CAGE: . . . to the acceptance of anything, even when you have something as the basis. And that’s how it’s misunderstood. 

 > 

 > DUCKWORTH: What’s a better understanding of it? 

 > 

 > CAGE: It opens you up to any possibility only when nothing is taken as the basis. 



 But I don't want to avoid discussion about whether or not 4'33" is music and/or art because it's a fascinating one. It's a discussion that can lead to hours of philosophizing and potentially even change how you approach music as a whole. So how about I take some time to discuss it? 



 **Part 1: What is 4'33?"** 



 So, what is 4'33"? Unfortunately, there's no easy answer to this. The definition of music and various other forms of art varies from person to person, making it impossible to reach a consensus on whether or not 4'33" is music. That's because the word "music" is just a linguistic construct born out of a desire to talk about our listening experiences in social situations. A social construct, if you will. 



 But of course, that doesn't mean that we should just give up. Establishing a definition of music is important for ensuring meaningful conversations between each other. If I were to call the artificial purple hydrangea plant in the corner of my room "music" then well... I'd be called a lunatic! Nobody would know what I'm talking about. There are a couple of common definitions of music that I've noticed, so let's go over them. 



 **A. Common definitions of music** 



 The first and most primitive definition of what music is would be that it's defined by compositional elements such as melody, form, rhythm and/or timbre. It's this very definition that you'll often find used by people as a weapon to accuse genres that they don't like of being music, such as Ben Shapiro arguing that hip hop isn't music by pointing out how it can lack harmony or melody. These compositional elements simply aren't, and never will be, what defines music. 



 And as for an example that isn't motivated by bigotry, you'll often find this sort of argument used to accuse genres such as harsh noise of not being music as well. But as evidenced by how a substantial portion of listeners of harsh noise refer to harsh noise as music and enjoy it like music, it seems quite obvious to me that harsh noise is music. Perhaps a bit abrasive and unstructured, but still music. Merzbow's "Woodpecker No. 1" has never felt like it didn't belong on one of my playlists because it wasn't music. And really, if something is treated like music by a substantial portion of the population then for all intents and purposes it should be considered music. After all, if that definition is being meaningfully useful in conversation then it's doing exactly what it should be doing. 



 There's nothing logically contradictive about this definition, but if we're seeking a definition that can be universally agreed upon then this ain't it. There's far too much room for subjectivity in deciding which elements should be considered musical. 



 Another possible definition of music is that it is a form of organized sound, sometimes with the restriction that it has to be organized by a human. This definition is inclusive of almost every genre of music, but it does lead to the exclusion of music that's assembled by random chance rather than in an organized manner. 



 Some examples of this would be using a random algorithm to generate melodies, generating melodies based upon the movement of a fish in a fish tank, or creating melodies based upon the natural blinking of a performer. That last example is a fairly interesting one because the entire composition would still written by a human, despite the nature of it being up to chance. It would be hard to argue that it isn't music. Oh—  and before anyone asks, these examples were written off of the top of my head! I'm not referencing any real-world compositions here. 



 John Cage himself ventured into this terrain while pioneering indeterminacy. If you're not familiar with what that is, indeterminacy is a form of music which can be performed in substantially different ways because elements of it are left up to chance or to decisions made on the spot by the performer. 



 Despite how promising defining music as a form of organized sound may be, a closer examination into indeterminacy and aleatoric music as a whole is enough to expose some flaws with defining music as a form of organized sound. Boundary pushing as ever, ain't he? 



 Let's look back at the aforementioned example of using the natural blinking of the performer to write and perform music. Imagine that this could be accomplished by using a high framerate camera that analyzes the performer's blinking and then telling the performer what note to play through a monitor sitting in front of them. The rate of blinking would define the duration between notes and the length of the blink could be mapped to pitch. Really though, how this would be done is irrelevant. This is just an absurd thought experiment! 



 If this experiment were performed on an acoustic guitar then I think it would be safe to say that most people would consider it music, especially because the whole process is human-driven— from the performer's blinking to the decisions made while writing the algorithm that converts their blinking into music. But what if it were played on something else? 



 There are plenty of unusual instruments out there, from the good ol' pots and pans to [banging the door of an oven.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgHW02YF50s) Ah, classic. Theoretically, there's nothing stopping ourselves from using our own coughing as an instrument. You could manually cough along to a melody as part of your performance. It would be absolutely absurd, but it would still be music. It's just using coughing as a really... unusual instrument. I've established that random chance could be used to perform music, including chance driven by natural bodily functions such as blinking, so... couldn't natural coughing be considered music if coughing could be considered an instrument? 



 Absolutely not. But that's where the problem with this definition lies; either you've got to admit that some sounds are excluded from being considered aleatory music or you've got to exclude aleatory music altogether. The former has no logical basis, whereas the latter excludes a lot of what many people would reasonably consider to be music. I imagine that some people would be willing to make that sacrifice though, especially because most "chance music" happens to be generated by algorithms without much human involvement. Not much of a loss if it weren't considered music, especially because music is an art and many people consider art to be a fundamentally human experience. 



 **B. How I would define music** 



 The definition of music which I would encourage using is defining it as a series of sounds that share a relational element between each other. That relation element can be almost anything relating to physical qualities of the sound itself; pitch, timbre, and duration; along with abstract human concepts such as a shared intention behind their creation. The potential for music to be defined by intention means that anyone who performs successive sounds with the intention of creating music is doing so because they're imbuing that intention within each sound they're performing. 



 Whether or not other species can perform music remains up for debate as certain animal behaviors such as the chirp of a cicada or bird could be considered music by this definition. Personally, I'm inclined to consider those sounds music but my stance on this matter isn't firm; just remember that we are ultimately the ones who decide whether or not something is musical in nature because we're the ones who invented the label. 



 Ultimately, it is up to you to decide how you would like to define music. Just try and keep it reasonable by not going and labeling your hydrangea plants as music. Language is meant to be understood.

RandomHypnotica:  **C. Constructing a frame** 



 Under every definition that I've presented so far, 4'33" wouldn't count as music. Even the intentionally ambiguous definition which I prefer would exclude 4'33". Even if it were true that John Cage intended every sound that listeners hear during a performance of 4'33" to be music then it wouldn't count under this definition because he lacks involvement in the creation of those sounds. You could potentially make a stretch by arguing that any sound caused by a performance of 4'33 that intends to create music, such as jeering, is music; but if we're going to define what a performance of 4'33" is then there's something much more reasonable: Performance art. 



 I'm going to avoid getting into what the definition of art is as this is already far too long, but I believe that it would be difficult to argue that a performance of 4'33" isn't performance art. There is clearly an element of art involved with 4'33" and it's undeniably a performance. Even if 4'33" weren't music, that doesn't matter— it's still art. 



 But it's important to mention here that I'm describing 4'33" as a performance. It isn't always a performance. Sometimes it comes in the form of sheet music, and sometimes it comes in the form of an empty audio file that someone decided to label as 4'33" under the ID3 metadata. In those cases, 4'33" wouldn't be a performance at all. It would be something else entirely. 



 That's why I believe that, ultimately, 4'33" is the concept of nothingness surrounded by a conceptual frame intended to express the message that we should pay more attention to the sound around us. And that's further evidenced by how John Cage describes his experience with 4'33" in an interview with William Duckworth which I quoted earlier in this comment: 



 > CAGE: Well, I use it constantly in my life experience. No day goes by without my making use of that piece in my life and in my work. I listen to it every day. Yes I do. 

 > 

 > DUCKWORTH: Can you give me an example? 

 > 

 > CAGE: I don’t sit down to do it; I turn my attention toward it. I realize that it’s going on continuously. So, more and more, my attention, as now, is on it. More than anything else, it’s the source of my enjoyment of life. 



 You, too, could enjoy 4'33" in this manner. Pay more attention to the sounds around you and be present in the moment. As someone who has a habit of tuning out my surroundings to the point of losing my sense of satisfaction with the life I'm living, it's some advice that I should take myself. 



 With all of this covered, we can finally talk about why I gave something that I don't even consider music an 11. Thought this comment was long enough? You haven't even seen the end of it. 



 **Part 2: Why I gave 4'33" an 11** 



 Because of how abstract 4'33" is, I can't explain why I gave an 11 without taking a deep dive into how I approach rating music. Although this explanation might seem long, I assure you that it's simpler than it sounds in practice. This section will be split into two parts: An explanation of how I approach rating and an explanation of how I score something that isn't even music. 



 **A. How I approach rating music** 



 The way that I approach rating music is based in the understanding that rating music is based entirely on your own personal values. I've attempted to categorize some of the various ways of valuing music while rating, here they are: 



 * (A) Experiential Value — How much that you value your experience of listening to the song. 

 * (B) Consequence Value — How much that you value the impact that the song had on your life beyond the time that you've spent listening to it. 

 * (C) Artistic Value — How much that you value the song's "artistic qualities". 

 * (D) Influence Value — How much that you value the impact that the song has had on other people. 



 Everyone has likely taken each of these factors into account while rating music at some point. For example, giving a song a low rating because it contains a slur that people find triggering would be deciding to place value in the song's influence on other people. 



 How much that one value's a song's "artistic qualities" is the most nebulous thing here and there's a good reason for that; it doesn't mean anything. "Artistic qualities" are nothing but a meaningless construct. This is where irrational beliefs such as "Pop music isn't art. It's trash." factor into a rating. And beyond that, this is where things which people believe are ruining their experience of a song but are merely creating the illusion of doing so happen to factor into a rating as well. For example, someone might believe that autotune is ruining a song for them but they might've just constructed a mental barrier that is preventing themselves from enjoying it because they've learned from the culture around them that autotune supposedly makes music worse. That might even lead them to physically react to the autotune, going "eugh!" as soon as they hear it. But even that can be a learned behavior. It's easy to get caught in the illusion of believing that something is ruining your experience when it really isn't. 



 And to be clear, I do believe that autotune can ruin a song. I've heard plenty of examples of that before. But I chose that example based off of personal experience, because back when Pop 2 released I called that mixtape bad in response to how much autotune was being applied to Charli's vocals. With time, I eventually realized that I enjoyed the autotune and that my response to it was just a learned behavior. The widespread belief that autotune is bad had affected me to such an extent that I wasn't allowing myself to enjoy the music for what it is. I've also had similar experiences with "mumble rap", writing it off as bad for years until I eventually came to realize that I enjoyed that sound. 



 Anyway, what matters here is that it's easy to get caught in the illusion of believing that something is affecting your experience of a song when it really isn't, blurring the lines between experiential value and artistic value. Hopefully I'll have convinced you that you should keep an eye out for that kind of illusion while listening to and rating music. 



 My rating process brings all of these concepts together by the use of a spreadsheet that allows myself to separate each category of personal values into their own field and then using a formula to inform how I should assign my final score. How I decide to input my values into each of those categories determines the final score of a song. 



 Quantifying your personal values into a numerical score is a challenging process, but fortunately experiential value is much easier to calculate than the other categories and it's for that reason that it I use it as the foundation for how I rate music. I attempt to do this by taking my playtime of a song and then multiplying it by a value that's proportionate to how much that I value my experience with it. Diminishing returns are applied to my playtime as well, reflecting how I value successive experiences of a song less than my first listen of it. Fortunately, I've got years of listening history tracked on my last.fm which makes this process swift and easy. 



 Consequence value and influence value can't be mathematically calculated, but they can still be manually inputted through separate columns. The values that I enter into those columns are combined with the points rewarded from the formulas that estimate a score for my experiential values to inform my final score for any given song. But as you can imagine, quantifying those values into a number that can be meaningfully compared to the points rewarded for experiential value is challenging. Fortunately, you can make comparisons as a means of assigning those points. And that finally brings me to why I gave 4'33" an 11. Took long enough, huh? 



 **B. Scoring 4'33"** 



 When rating 4'33", experiential value is almost a complete non-factor. My experience of listening to it is irrelevant because I'm not really listening to anything. Though it has occasionally caused me to pay attention to my surroundings some, so I can track that even though the effect is miniscule. On the other hand consequence value is very relevant here, as 4'33" profoundly influenced my rating system and led me to spend a lot of time about philosophizing about how much meaning that music has to me. To estimate how many points that I should rewarded for that, I just have to look at my overall song ranking. 



 "Hung Up" by Madonna has 2463 points. The song directly above it, "The Man Comes Around" by Johnny Cash, has 2518 points. If I had to choose between either retroactively erasing Hung Up or 4'33" from existence then I would choose to keep 4'33". But if I were to make a decision between 4'33" or The Man Comes Around then I would choose to keep the Johnny Cash song. That means that how much I value the impact which 4'33" had on my life is probably somewhere between 2463 and 2518 points. For that reason, I strike right in-between by rewarding it 2490 points. 



 2490 points belongs to the top percentile of all music that I've rated. Because I usually assign a 10/10 to music in the 99th percentile, I gave 4'33" a 10. And it's the highest scoring song on my sheet, so it just happens to get an 11. And there we go! 



 This rating process might song tedious after how long you've spent reading it, but that's only because it requires explanation. I was able to use this process to rate hundreds of songs in a mere week, so it's not slow at all. And this method has allowed me to assign ratings far more accurately to how I really feel about music, exposing illusions and biases in the process. I'm really satisfied with how it turned out. 



 Anyhow... I sure had a lot to say about nothing, didn't I?

**akanewasright** (10): This song is... deeply campy in ways that I completely understand people not buying into. Like between the endearingly shitty localization job, the gratingly obnoxious vocal performance, and the deeply cheesy eurodance beat, there's a LOT here that could make a person turn away. But all of that is kinda why I love this so much. Like... I'm sorry this is just a WILD 3 minute ride. I personally think all dance songs should have an interval where the singer turns into a blood psychopath for a minute. But yeah, this was always doomed to fail, and I was sad to see it's quick fall from grace.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh Monkey Pink you deserved so much more… of all the songs from Video Game Vocals, this one occupies a special place in my heart for just being an insane rollercoaster of a ride from start to end. There’s storytelling, a genre switch, crazy screaming and as Dude pointed out, it elicits a strong reaction in everybody who hears it.

*submitted by /u/imadudeduh*

**ImADudeDuh** (10): *"It's just a silly villain song from a game where you run around capturing monkeys who are mind-controlling the human race by putting on mindless tv shows to keep them glued to the tv." That's what most people would think when they hear this song, and those people would be right!*

*I won't deny that [my original comment](https://i.imgur.com/iuuZvBv.png) on the song was just me saying shit for no reason. But, I can't deny that this song has so many happy memories from my childhood tied to it. It was a game me and my sisters played a lot and just has so many fun times exploring the levels and seeing what our horoscopes for each monkey said. We still play it occasionally to watch my sister try to speedrun the game (but like a normal person speedrun, she doesn't actively seek out glitches to cheat the game or anything). But, when there came a rate where this song could be involved in and I was happy to rate it and see other people react to it. It's not a well-known song. It's not even from a game that's that well-known, even if the series is. Seeing reactions from confused to happy to disgusted was fun to witness. Opinions that people can all agree to are boring! Songs with high controversy scores are fun.* 

*So, yeah, I wanted to rate this stupid song one more time. It's fun and nostalgic for me, and in the end, that's enough for me to be content. Just a fun song about an evil monkey trying to understand why her feelings aren't being reciprocated by the evilest monkey. I hope y'all enjoyed it.*

**akanewasright** (10): This song beating anything was a win, but it still could've beaten a few more songs idk...

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Yes, I did really want to payola this into the rate so it could be tied with Rolling in the Deep for most times rated. But if any song deserved redemption, it truly should be Closer. My biggest regret in life is when I looped this song about 120 times in 2016 and deleted the scrobbles from my last.fm out of embarrassment (as if anybody was checking). I should’ve been proud to have such good ears.

#WE AIN'T EVER GETTING OLDEEEEEEEER

**anothertown** (10): you will always be famous

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The best song ever made sorry about it!

**cremeebrulee** (10): thank u to all the 0s for getting this on the controversy board for a third time

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i missed you so much

**DirtyRat583** (10): this song is good and im sick of seeing it critiqued

**flava** (10): Popheads you have been given so many chances to let this song win. For the last time, don’t fuck it up

**frogaranaman** (10): LET IT BE KNOWN THE LAW OF CLOSER: For every 11 that comes in, a 0 must soon follow. For every 10 that comes in, a 1 must soon follow. This is known as ‘The Theorum of Chainsmoked Equilibrium’ and is done to ensure the highest controversy score available each rate.

**hikk** (10): THANK GOD WE'RE RATING THIS AGAIN ADELE U WILL NEVER BE FAMOUS

**ignitethephoenix** (10): every time this comes up I want to tank it but then I remember I actually like this song

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the way this song paved the way for Taylor’s infamous one

**impla77** (10): Finally some real music

**JIRACHl** (10): This carried my 2016 when I thought I was straight so I have to give it its flowers unfortunately

**jsonphile** (10): look I’ve already committed enough popheads crimes that fuck it I might as well give this a ten. Does it deserve it? Maybe. I don’t know. Closer is no longer an actual song in my mind. Trying to rate this is like trying to rate, I don’t know, the moon. It just **is**. And since this is going to get zeroed hard as it always does, I’ll do my part to protect it

**mysario** (10): ah shit here we go again dot gif

**ricki** (10): there’s no layer of irony in this 10. this song reminds me of simple, happier times.

**Roxieloxie** (10): maybe ill 11 this again.edit: nvm i thought this was the last song.

**runaway3212** (10): y'all just hate to see straight people winning

**Stryxen** (10): me and my rate buddies <3

**thedoctordances1940** (10): hey

**TiltControls** (10): rolling in the deep you're dead

**vayyiqra** (10): Both meme and the post-ironic enjoyment of the meme died years ago so it can have a 10 out of tradition, but also can we please never rate this again

**Raindrac** (9.5): Have you ever heard a melody on a song and thought to yourself "Oh, this is a hit"? Because that's how I feel while listening to Closer. The melodies here are infectious and some of the best of the decade. And even better, they somehow conveyed a sense of nostalgia on my first listen, which is difficult to achieve. I genuinely believe that Closer is a classic of the 2010s and it was actually in line for my 11 before being overtaken by another song. 



 It disappoints me that Closer continually performs poorly in rates and receives an overall negative critical reception. I mean, I can understand why— it embodies every negative cliché of mid '10s pop music. But honestly, I don't care, and if anything, they make it more earnest. There aren't many songs out there that portray the awkward moments of a relationship in a lighthearted manner, and Closer's willingness to approach that subject head-on makes it a much more realistic depiction of a relationship than the idealized version that you'll hear in so many other pop songs. 



 But ultimately, it's still those melodies that are what make this song a classic, and even if I were to dislike the lyrics, it wouldn't affect my experience of them. Those melodies could be played on a piano and still be instantly recognizable. They're timeless.

**Ambrosia42** (9): it’s a bop i’m sorry

**Awkward\_King** (9): ifmds sorreyffg

**bluetriangles04** (9): I had to go to a convention during high school, and during one of the gatherings in the huge concert hall, they played this song during intermission and literally everyone in the room was chanting the lyrics to this song. Like you could just hear a roar of people singing along to this and I'll never forget that experience... this song was literally EVERYWHERE back then. Inescapable. So luckily, it was a song I found enjoyable.

**jasannn** (9): such 2016 energy

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): lol

**throwaway-7650** (9): [AOA jimin voice] hey.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): excited for the controversy score update

**krusso1105** (8.5): I like this song a lot more that it's not constantly overplayed anymore

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): This shit was fuckin everywhere in 2016. I know we love to rag on about the Chainsmokers but you can’t deny that they’ve got some actually good songs! Yes I’m a Chainsmokers defender, whataya gonna do about it??

**bigbigbee** (8): I think I’ve given this an 8 every single time we’ve rated it - props on the Chainsmokers that even constant exposure doesn’t make me hate it

**camerinian** (8): The year's longest-running No. 1 on the Hot 100 was as predictable a smash as they come: Perfectly played duet drama, an immediately recognizable hook - maybe a little too instantly recognizable – and a Blink-182 reference that made every Millennial listening nod with begrudging respect. Overplay might've done The Chainsmokers and Halsey a temporary disservice, but just wait for the emotional rush that hits in 2025 when you're hanging in a hotel bar and hear this for the first time in years

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I could draw a random number between 11 and 0 and any number would be a justified score here

**welcome2thejam** (8): Can't wait til my kids get into rating and get to give Closer a score of their own one day

**emayzee** (7.7): listening to this after just hearing the news of her being dropped by capitol feels like the end of an era

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): https://i.imgur.com/f6BiAEW.png

**bogo** (7): at what point are we just gonna say fuck it and make this an honorary rate winner

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): why did I have to meme myself into unironically finding this song enjoyable, I genuinely like this song better than 2/3rds of Blink-182’s discography

**dreamingpastel** (7): The best thing about this song is that it's Todd's Best Hit Song of 2016

**Frajer** (7): Halsey to the Blink 182 song in Tuscon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBFG80N3EfQ

**kappyko** (7): bye

**pig-serpent** (7): The meme is funny, but overall it's always been just a fine song.  It's viby in a way that feels like it describes life in a way that other songs can't, but it's always annoyed me that the drop melody is just the same melody as the chorus which isn't that different from the verse melody.  The Chainsmokers also can't sing.  Despite all that, this really was one of the best hit songs of 2016 because that year was atrocious for pop music.

**Poydoo** (7): This song literally started World War I

**NotWith10000Men** (6.2): i wanted to bomb this one for the lulz but i do like listening to it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Maybe I'd be a bit more charitable to this song if the chorus didn't have one of the most ugliest-sounding synths I've ever heard

RandomHypnotica: #I know it breaks your heart

**shadowtheweedhog** (5.6): pros, i like the voices, cons, i hate the lyrics and the back beat is getting on my nerves but the voices are good and that’s worth something here for me

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5.5): US CHACHARINAS WON'T BE SILENCED.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): i don’t know how to rate this. This is not my thing, in an unironic sense. It’s camp only cuz of what popheads has done to it. Giving it a neutral 5 and moving on lksdklsd. it could have been a hard 0 or hard 1 in another world cuz I straight-up don’t like it; it’s catchy but that isn’t always inherently good. But it gets bumped to a centrist 5 from all the joy the memes and shitposts it has wrought.

**jay** (5): girl okay..

**vexastrae** (5): the way this white college party ass song is the most divisive song on this subreddit HELP

**indie\_fan\_** (4): it ain't really that bad but if i hear this one more time I'm breaking the nearest thing i can find

**jdmun148** (4): I have PTSD from how overplayed this was

**Catrick** (3): I guess being in the most controversial twice wasn’t good enough? Ok

**pijus41** (3): one of the staples of H&M-core

**starla\_** (3): I feel like we've rated this more times than every KKB song put together. Please never again

**Adavman** (2.5): Going in I believed this could be my 0but it manages to get a slightly than expected higher score due to the frightening discovery of some tracks that are worse than it on here. Still this is really not good.

**imbaby122** (2): the hold that this song has over r/popheads needs to be studied. or maybe it is a study? waiting to receive a message saying “Good evening, “Closer” was a 7 year sociological conducted by Harvard University. We are now complete with our study. Thank you for your time.”

**apatel27** (1): popheads digging out a rotting corpse to beat once again

**kvothetyrion** (1): Kinda cool how the greatest pop song of the last decade or so (Closer by Tegan and Sara) and this dumpster fire have the same name. What city rhymes with shoulder.

**memezaharamole** (1): Halsey's voice isn't too bad on this

**Nagisoid** (1): This song is impressive in the way it's somehow less than the sum of its parts, which is already awful by itself. The shitty deafening synth break, the finger clicks recorded in a bathroom and T*ggrt's awful voice. Halsey is fine except their lyrics as they mention Blink-182 and that reminds me of the I Miss You mall cover. The outro tries to save this, only to end up going out as a fart. This is truly a Greek tragedy of a song. Why do we keep rating this?

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W4aoaS6c2TU

**ReallyCreative** (1): doing my part to raise the controversy score

**shipperondeck** (1): i don't care. shoulder/boulder is unforgivable

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (1): At exchange I stated "Closer is a monster that was made for and NEVER should have left Bonaroo 2k16. it blends way too well w/jacob saritoius (why didnt poppyheads send us sweatshirt??)." The overplay at the iv habit hurt in fall 2016. i was not the audience and didn't wanna hear it. then i learned what "being buzzed" is and Closer WORKED but also still SUCKED. like you might as well put that on the playlist whether you like it or not no cap no bullshit here; walking around buzzed as left chainsmoker and halsey belt their hearts out is euphoric (in the worst way). Anyways, Left Chainsmoker and Right Chainsmoker really cranked out a stinker that noted-pop baddie Halsey def cleans house with. at this point, a borderline unrateable cut that has created a super stockholm syndrome in this community that can only produce shrodenger's cat-ass results. I honestly am of the mindset that the White House should have issued an executive order that would've forced Left Chainsmoker, Right Chainsmoker, and Halsey to never issue a studio version of it and BE FORCED to tour it around county fairs for the rest of their life. I think this would have been a net gain for society instead of hearing it every time I wanted fries.

**akanewasright** (10): Well... it's not last place at least! I don't think anyone is at all surprised that this song perhaps did not perform very well, but it definitely deserved a bit better. I've written about this before, but I deeply love how *visceral* this song is. Björk always go all out on every melody, every beat, and especially every vocal performance, and that's especially evident here. Her voice is nothing short of tectonic, and you *feel* like exploding by the end of the song. I think that's a good thing, but evidently a lot of people do not. And I don't blame them - this song is the go-to choice for explaining why Björk can be divisive, but there's a lot of magic there.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is a song you either get or you don’t. Bjork was truly ahead of her time here with this proto-hyperpop/industrial sound that instantly became a hardcore fan favorite, but it’s also easy to see why it ended up in the bottom 5. The literal screams and moans accompanied by chilling synths, and a music video with a fully nude man masturbating in a black void so hard his head explodes is the definition of a controversial song.

*submitted by u/Nagisoid*

**Nagisoid** (10): *I should probably explain why I submitted this. Björk is probably my favorite artist of all time so maybe it wasn't a surprise that I ended up sending a song by her, even though I knew well that she tends to flop HARD in meta rates. The fact that this song got last in its original rate, other songs deserved much more (not naming them for my safety) also it got 75% of the 0s given in that rate, which is disappointing to say the least. Very concerning that this didn't get a single 11 as well, which I hope will change (I don't 11 my own submissions out of principle). Who said promo for future Björk rates in PEGGED and EE ER too, remember to vote for them! Finally, I've been feeling very sad and lonely lately and this song gives me a little joy in its pure burst of energy and repressed emotions, which is something I can relate to a lot right now. Please don't think I set her up by sending one of her most abrasive and divisive songs to a meta rate, I just thought it would be very cool and let's be honest, she would not win even if I sent one of her most acclaimed or accessible tracks, so why not have a little fun? I won't be surprised when this makes bottom 5 or (in a good day) bottom 10 but I owe it to the riddle-obsessed Icelandic woman for getting me through so much.*

**plastichaxan** (11): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOEAOAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHHHH (best song ever)

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): [kirby](https://imgur.com/a/FeRowRv)

**Poydoo** (10): Björk - Pluto

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): industrial harsh noise hyperpop slay!!! I would've had a 10 average for this album jfc

**sarcasticsobs** (10): MUSIC

**starla\_** (10): OHHHHHHAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH!

**Stryxen** (10): a song that combines orgasmic head exploding chaos with the thrill of just pacing around your room

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): when björk said oooooaah oooooah oooooah oooooah ooooooah oooooah ooooah ooooah oooooah oooooah i felt that

**throwaway-7650** (10): hyperpop queen ([ex-]ratcom DNI) [reject their ballots PLEEK]

**vayyiqra** (10): Idk what to say, *Homogenic* is in my top 5 albums of all time, this is a bit abrasive but it's a total banger, I cannot understand why it's so polarizing. Here's to Bjonk getting robbed yet again in a grab bag rate, I guess.

**vexastrae** (10): this was faceshopping before faceshopping

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): dumbass: "this song is too scary and im having trouble finding a beat". the wise man: "this ditty is what the modern world sounds of. the hyperrealism of the simulation beckoning to the screen and finally coming to fruition and awakening; the screams beckoning an awaken from the matrix and a path towards taking the red pill and finally being able to fly n' do bullet time." me: "...yeah idk you two, i still think bjork peaked on medulla but homogenic is a lovely album and there really aren't any flaws here that are apparent". just such a staunch pop sound that we haven't really QUITE moved beyond 25 years later. doesn't sound dated one bit. glad to have it here and vibe.

**imbaby122** (9.5): the first time i listened to this song i was in boston south station on thanksgiving and i immediately understood björk’s screeching on a deep emotional level.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): so wish björk wasn't good

**anothertown** (9): remember when the most sane arianator posted this song on twitter and said "how can you defend this? how can someone convince another person that this is good music? because apart from the last few seconds, this is unlistenable, i fully believe that bjork bribed reviewers to write good reviews."

**Awkward\_King** (9): bjonk

**beeozan** (9): this song put the homo in homogenic

**bogo** (9): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH

**frogaranaman** (9): reinstate the bitch’s planet status if she sounds like this wtf

**qazz23** (9): i like the fast-paced beats with the howling vocals

**shipperondeck** (9): young teen me liking this song was a clear indication that i would be a hyperpop fan later in life, i just didn't realize it at the time

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is kind of a collapse

**Frajer** (8.5): if OPN was hyperpop , how the fuck is this from 1997

**JIRACHl** (8.5): ngl this took me like 10 listens before actually getting it but it was worth it

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): : AAAA!!!

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): Bjüssy popping music

**apatel27** (8): beautiful wonderful noise

**bigbigbee** (8): Sometimes this industrial, glitchy sound works for me, sometimes it doesn’t. Here, it really, really does

**DirtyRat583** (8): my phone after i drop it down the stairs for the 206541th time

**IIIHenryIII** (8): did I just vibe with a Björk song?

**phonethephoenix** (8): a+ lyrics and song title combination

**pig-serpent** (8): I think this song works better in the context of the album.  The whole album is a mix of industrial and classical, but tends to lean towards the latter, so having a shift of Björk going full industrial for a track really stands out there, but as it's own song it's harder for me to just vibe to it, even if it's still very good.

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): oh pluto

**runaway3212** (7.5): the good thing about this song is that it's by björk, the bad thing about this song is that it's by björk

**impla77** (7): Forcing myself to like this due to peer pressure <3

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Welp…. It surely is a Bjork song.

**ReallyCreative** (7): I hope that was cathartic for her

**welcome2thejam** (7): Oooooh! Ohhhhhh! Oaaaahh!

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): turned away for a minute and returned to the video from the playlist midway through…. wtf

**camerinian** (6.5): this is gonna be one of those "yeah its better in the context of the album" type tunes isn't it

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (6): me in the toilet after drinking milk (im lactose intolerant)

**jdmun148** (6): I feel like I should like this more than I do

**Raindrac** (6): Usually I love chaotic songs that unleash hell upon the listener, but this one just isn't memorable and I'm not sure why. I couldn't even remember how Pluto sounded before relistening to it for the rate. Much like the dwarf planet, Pluto hasn't cleared the neighbourhood around my memories.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I wanna explode too girl

**jman457** (5.8): I was gonna 10 this to raise the controversy/ bc I think its kind of good, but then she became restrictive in Coachella for no reason

**jsonphile** (5): stop giving me bjonk songs I don’t understand. I want to rate her highly but I don’t get any of her music

**moonagenightmares** (5): sufjans pluto outslays

**ricki** (5): anyone saw that one account that posted like 4 times about how this song is shit?

**seanderlust** (5): going straight from barbie girl into this is quite the 180

**flava** (4): insert shakey emote here, insert it more for the mv

**hunnybee12** (4): im a simple girl i cant this overstimulation

**babadork** (3): Even when I have headphones on, my dog hates this song. I’m not really a fan, either.

**bluetriangles04** (3): as someone who has never heard bjork befor- *gunshots*

**emayzee** (3): every time bjork shows up in a rate i think "maybe this will be the time bjork finally clicks with me" and it never is

**jasannn** (3): I keep hearing good things about Bjork but every song I’ve listened to her in a rate, I’ve disliked

**mysario** (2): perhaps I'm uncultured and don't get Bjork

**SinfulAnarchy** (2): abrasive and pretentious just like everything in Bjork’s discography. also why is she orgasming near the end

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): mickey's dog, the greek god, and the planet all outsold

**shadowtheweedhog** (1.5): it gets 1.5 because it made me feel something unfortunately that thing was fear

**CrimsonROSET** (1): how many people were scared? me too I was really really scared

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): no matter how many Bjork songs y’all shove into grab bags I’m not gonna like her!

**indie\_fan\_** (1): i (unfortunately) like a good amount of music by bjork. this is one of those exceptions however

**jay** (1): girl fuck

**NotWith10000Men** (1): y'all like this ironically right?

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I appreciate the experimental side of this but I would rather not listen to this again as I don’t like her screaming in the back half and I hate the glitchiness of the production at parts like I feel like my headphones are going to stop working

**ImADudeDuh** (0): https://i.imgur.com/cIbejZC.png

**oscarbrierley1** (0): so grating, every sound annoys me

**Roxieloxie** (0): im going to choose peace

**TiltControls** (0): I think Bjork is not for me. unfortunately for her she keeps showing up anyways

**TragicKingdom1** (0): last place again please and thank you

**akanewasright** (8): This is one of those songs that reminds me of why I was in so many musicals with emo band stans. The verses have fantastic theater kid energy that I find really charming... but of course I would, I lived in my high school's drama department for 3 years. And of course, they got Liza Minnelli, EGOT winner and [notorious survivor](https://twitter.com/LiZaOutlives), to sing part of the bridge. This was made for me to appreciate.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): MCR was the one emo band that I never really got into as a kid, because I had this idea in my head of what their music all sounded like, and that idea was exactly this song. The musings of an extremely depressed theatre kid with too much creative power. It’s a song that is absolutely steeped in drama, and  I can’t say I’m surprised to find that it bounced off quite a few people.

*submitted by /u/pig-serpent* 

**pig-serpent** (10): *This song is rightfully a MCR fan favorite for combining their raw energy with a manic carnival vibe, goofy voices, nihilism, and lines that are easily read as being about gender dysphoria, and when Emo rate 1 happened it was robbed like crazy.  I submitted it again so that hopefully we can give it the respect it deserves.*

# Drank from the mother lake!

**anothertown** (10): and if you would call me your sweetheart.. i'd maybe then sing you a song….but thE SHIT THATI'VE DONE WITH THIS FUCK OF A GUN YOU WOULD CRY OUT YOUR EYES ALL ALONG WE'RE DAMNED AFTER ALL!!!!!!!!!! THROUGH FORTUNE AND FLAME WE FALL!!!

**bogo** (10): mother

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): i used to play this song and pretend that I was a soldier writing back to my mother. Anyway, I was also a kpop stan at the time so I might as well have been fighting in a war.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): a classic

**jackisboredtoday** (10): one of MCR’s best songs ever, whoever sent this really displayed some impeccable taste with this one

**just\_thonking** (10): how much camp can we fit in one rate

**moonagenightmares** (10): iconic

**Nagisoid** (10): The fact that Gerard Way is literally mother right now

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Buster Bluth enlisting in the army:

**seanderlust** (10): ok honestly in terms of theatricality, MCR and liza minelli are an extremely obvious pairing. also jesus CHRIST what a banger

**starla\_** (10): this was an 11 contender for sure. This album is so fucking good, every song is an anthem.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): nobody is “born” trans, you listen to mama by my chemical romance and gerard way decides it for you

**mysario** (9.8): Meghan Trainor should've sampled this instead

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This isn’t really my thing at all, but I can tell it’s slay so I will stand with the emo rater coalition.

**camerinian** (9): god I wish that chorus hit a bit harder cos every other element of this song is MCR at their most theatrical, most camp, least fucks given, awe inspiring shit

**jsonphile** (9): this isn’t one of my favorites off of this album but this album is just so good that even the weaker songs are still amazing

**Frajer** (8.5): mama we're all full of lice

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): My mother abused me but this is fun.

**Poydoo** (8.5): Famous Last Words is better but I still do really like this song

**slimboyfriend** (8.1): Gerard Way knows Liza Minnelli was mother

**1998tweety** (8): mamamoo >>>

**babadork** (8): Could use more Liza

**beeozan** (8): lol wait i never heard this album is all of it as cabaret as this song

**bluetriangles04** (8): this album was my religion as an emotional middle schooler. Maybe I should fall back down the rabbit hole...

**CrimsonROSET** (8): throwback to all the mom songs from the randomized ballot

**flava** (8): Meghan Trainor outsold I fear

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I am your mama now listen to me

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://i.imgur.com/OnsgxAR.png

**runaway3212** (8): the crying is so mecoded

**sarcasticsobs** (8): where "The Sharpest 11ves?"

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Every day I count my blessings that I did not grow up an emo kid cause Gerard Way ABSOLUTELY would have been my gay awakening and I would have embarrassed myself on the daily doing cringy shit like putting on ugly eyeliner and reading vampire au fanfics and whatnot

**welcome2thejam** (8): I will not reference the lowest hanging fruit I will not reference the lowest hanging fruit I will not reference the lowest hanging fruit

**phonethephoenix** (7.9): okay everyone's right that line rules. love the flair in this song.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): don’t listen to this album that much these days. despite being a silly little bitch, i can have a weird aversion of intentional “circus vibes” music that can instantly make me despise a song (quite literally blame Dresden Dolls/Amanda Palmer). I think my prior MCR nostalgia and generally liking what they do has saved me from despising all this, it’s cool. rock on

**vexastrae** (7.5): the tumblr transmascs really latched on to this one huh

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (7.4): look they have a strong brand that makes kids become extremely online

**imbaby122** (7.2): i really feel like i could’ve gone down the emo path in high school. this goes really hard. too bad i found popheads and altered my brain chemicals forever.

**apatel27** (7): I just killed a man

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): This whole song is a fuckin' trip. Some parts sound like a demented Tally Hall song, some parts sound like a sea shanty on crack, some parts sound like an actual MCR song... It's fucking ridiculous, and I kinda like it?

**Raindrac** (7): Pretty good, although this is a song that'll probably be much better in the context of the album that it's from. I haven't heard the majority of The Black Parade and I really should get around to doing that because the tracks that I have heard— Mama and The Black Parade— are quite promising!

**ricki** (7): yeehaw

**static\_int\_husp** (7): "You should have raised a baby girl, I should've been a better son" is just a very trans lyric

**impla77** (6.7): I feel like this is good for what it is, but it’s just not really my thing

**shadowtheweedhog** (6.5): this song sure did something and when i figure out what it is i’ll let you know

# [Mama](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Oy4wVkxu1Kg)

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): the heavy bits are really good i just do not like the voice at all it's so annoying

**jay** (5): girl ok

**nooodisaster** (5): Like the chorus but not really anything else

**qazz23** (5): the intro is good, this isn't as annoying as their other stuff

**Stryxen** (5): I thought this was a different song oh… not for me sorry but not bad

**TiltControls** (5): well at least some mother-core made it in

**jman457** (4.5): I give my gratitude every day that I was a little too young to be peak annoying emo

**Catrick** (4): I’m will never be emo enough and I’m at peace with that

**emayzee** (4): not saying mama for an entire minute challenge [FAILED]

**throwaway-7650** (4): Liza Minnelli has outlived this placement

**Adavman** (3.5): Not a fan of this

**kvothetyrion** (3): I generally like this album but man this songs stinks! This band made Demolition Lovers!!! Go back to that!!!!! Also I’m imagining Vincente and Judy listening to this song and being very, very confused.

**oscarbrierley1** (3): annoying af

**NotWith10000Men** (2): vewy scawwy

**ReallyCreative** (2): this is so corny, the state of Iowa is litigating as we speak

**Uberpigeon** (2): this explains why the emo kids were like that

**Ambrosia42** (0): the way it kept morphing into new things i didn’t like and dragged on forever

**Awkward\_King** (0): im so deeply sorry to whoever sent this but my god i fucking hate this im not emo enough for this

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (0): this is literally a panic! song is disguise im sorry

**kappyko** (0): maybe any other time would be better but this was incredibly annoying

**shipperondeck** (0): this is the first time ive listened to mcr while knowing it's mcr playing. my response: ???

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): em0

**vayyiqra** (0): I refuse to engage further with this band than I already have, not sorry, I was a teenager in the 2000s and I know where I stand on this genre.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I can respect the hustle of trying to let one of your favourite songs ever get some redemption, unfortunately, that doesn’t work when your song is indie, features male vocals, and is not expressing mlm romance. The closest I have ever gotten to getting into The National is looping folklore and evermore a bunch, but before they even existed I became familiar with this song, and I looped that. Matt’s strikingly low vocals are enrapturing and i love the dreariness and oppression of the lyrics and the instrumental.

*submitted by /u/b_o_g_o_* 

**bogo** (11): *surprise surprise, i was the one who submitted this. i know the exchange rate was A Lot for a variety of different reasons and was not a great time for everyone involved but i just needed to bring this song back. i was still a lurker when exchange rate happened so i didn’t get a chance to rate this the first time, and to be honest if i was around to rate it i probably wouldn’t have given it a good score. over time though i completely fell in love with this song. the most striking element to it right away is the drums, they’re masterfully intense and powerful and gives the song an energy to it, and is probably the first thing i caught on to when i heard this song. however i eventually found myself super drawn to the lyrics, about how the lead singer gets drunk and realizes he has no ties to his home and feels completely lost in the world. now, i’ve never been too far from my home myself and i still am relatively young but having gone to college, i relate to these lyrics about feeling like you don’t have many meaningful ties to the places you used to live or the places you grew up in. i myself feel as if i’ve become completely disconnected from the town i used to go to school in, and mourn the fact that i haven’t really talked to my friends from high school nearly as much as i should. that feeling is part of why i love this song so much, it just perfectly conveys this sadness from feeling disconnected from places you used to have a big attachment to, and wondering where your real home is. shit, i didn’t mean for this to get so sentimental and sad it’s just a really amazing song*

#\#SaveTheBees

**1998tweety** (10): devoured

**flava** (10): maybe indie music is just better

**frogaranaman** (10): I like indie made for dads because I like dads

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this one goes hard and I'm all here for it

**jay** (10): girl okay i collapsed

**kvothetyrion** (10): Much like “Cause = Time” 8 years earlier, this song is just a perfect distillation of indie music - if someone didn’t know what indie rock was, you could show them this song and they’d understand it immediately. This band was so, so good back then, they’d just spit out 5-6 songs this good on every album. Shoutout to the drumming here especially.

**Nagisoid** (10): I feel bad for Ohio so why not give this a 10?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): "I still owe money to the money to the money I owe" me as interest accumulates on my student loans

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): the most positive song about Ohio

**TiltControls** (10): it's a 10 but honestly would not be surprised to see this lower than john cage

**Uberpigeon** (10): hes soo sexy in this i want him to fuck me so bad with his sexy voice please god

**welcome2thejam** (10): Looking back, a lot of my old Tumblr mutuals were The National stans/Matt Berninger thirst blogs. How I left that site still straight I'll never know

**phonethephoenix** (9.8): the older I get the more I like the national. maturity??

**camerinian** (9.5): “I still owe money to the money to the money I owe” - Karl Marx, Das Kapital, 1867

**jsonphile** (9): “I was carried to Ohio in a swarm of bees” hi sir what the heck does this mean

**nooodisaster** (9): Actually really liked this one. Will it be tanked bc of the vaguest association w Taylor? Probably!

**ReallyCreative** (9): yeah his voice is hot what about it

**seanderlust** (9): leave the national ALONE they are GOOD!

**Adavman** (8.5): This was such a welcome change of pace compared to the two songs before it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Apologies to the person who submitted this but it is going to FLOP with all capital letters. I like it though!

**shadowtheweedhog** (8.5): very atmospheric which I adore it feels like i might die listening to it and i’m okay with that

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): ended those fads tyler joseph + other flop

**bigbigbee** (8): a swarm of bees? more than one bee? pog

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Drummer tempting me by almost going dummy mode

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): still waiting for a song to surpass Miranda Cosgrove and this doesn’t come close

**imbaby122** (7.7): i can’t decide whether to make an ohio joke or a misandry joke. two fantastic options.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): this was already tanked for being indie but when you add the fact that popheads associates them with taylor now this is an all-time recipe for rate underperformance regardless of quality

**bluetriangles04** (7): insert something here about Ohio being one of the nine circles of hell

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the bees

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Aaron should just stick to producing for pop girls rather than this man with a rough voice

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://i.imgur.com/N9Wks3E.png

**Poydoo** (7): OMG are these the guys who made folklore?? 😍😍

**Raindrac** (7): The vocalist is Matt Berninger, correct? I haven't listened to The National before. Because, oh my gosh, that's one handsome voice. He sounds even better than he did on Coney Island. And there's a line about him taking off his shirt as well? ...No. I should stop. Maybe this'll be enough to finally get me to listen to The National though.

**ricki** (7): this kinda gives me taylor swift - evermore vibes

**vayyiqra** (7): Was worried I was going to hate this and have to give it a bad score when it's already going to flop because it's an indie band Popheads doesn't care about and then [redacted username] who sent it would feel even worse about it but turns out I like it okay so nevertheless 🫂 to [redacted username].

**NotWith10000Men** (6.7): ohio not remembering you sounds fine to me

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): unfortunately this is kinda good fortunately not that good

**DirtyRat583** (6): so sorry to hear that

**plastichaxan** (6): I wanted to be a hater so bad but they made a decent song :(

**runaway3212** (6): taylor's background singer spilled with this one but he spilled a bit too much so I overplayed this for 3 months after the IH exchange and now I cant hear it anymore

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sorry bogo

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ohhh I get it now. He appeals to the daddy kink crowd

RandomHypnotica: #Deep in debt

**pig-serpent** (5.5): After all this time my ears still refuse to process this song and have thoughts on it.  I guess I don't like the drony vocals, but I do like the "I was carried to Ohio on a swarm of bees" bit and I think a lot of the piano is cool.

**starla\_** (5.5): I've always found the National kind of boring

**jman457** (5.4): of course Taylor would collab with someone who would go hard for Ohio

**impla77** (5): This was ok.. maybe they could appeal more to me by collaborating with a world famous singer songwriter??

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (4.2): oh gawd man its the national! I paid $45 up front to see them play to a half empty santa barbara bowl with phoebe bridgers as their opener. she said "the national are my favorite band". bartees strange has said the same thing. does saying this mean I will not enjoy a majority of your output outside like 1 album? honestly I don't really know. But good christ this is such white bread streamlined nonsense. The drums are fantastic (no matter he gets to be besties with bon iver and tayswif), but I genuinely have to be in a "driving 100 mph straight to my grave" mood to feel the transcendence here. this is a good piece of music (most national cruises on 6/10 majesty harder than harry styles tbh), but also one that im not gonna coronate or rate positively (although 0s for this? goodness that's mean!). the piece simply isn't hitting rn

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): just not really my thing

**JIRACHl** (4): I was so bored

**qazz23** (4): the drumming is good but don't like the vocals

**Ambrosia42** (3): boring and long

**Awkward\_King** (1): indiehead sexchange

**beeozan** (1): people say rock music died in the 2010s, yeah no shit, what genre could survive the boredom-ification of monochrome indie men

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): “Sad Songs for Dirty Lovers” is a good album

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): dear lord this is just BORING

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): oh indie rock band you’re so talented, please, release me so I can tell the world

**Roxieloxie** (1): are these the people on exile

**Stryxen** (0): maybe slightly over reactive at this point but ugh I hate the vocal melodies and I really don't like his voice either it's kinda uncanny to me . (And it lasted too long the first time so im reprising my 0s role as this song)

**vexastrae** (0): at least closer keeps me awake || this is just absolutely mindnumbingly boring and devoid of character and life, this is ambient if it was bad and had a crusty white m*n talking over it like why tf did r/indieheads put this in the tracklist for the exchange rate like tell me why. why. anyways bmbmbm better

**akanewasright** (10): Man... Jill Scott deserves so much fucking better. She was the first artist eliminated in the Neo-Soul rate, and we barely did better this time around. I obviously understand why this flopped - this is a spoken word piece in a rate full of *song* songs - but it highlights Jill's personality, storytelling, and beginnings writing poetry in such a vivid piece. I would've sent a different Jill song (namely, one where she gets to use her brilliant voice to sing), but I can't fault this choice at all, and I'm happy it beat out a few songs.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Traditional values may lead you to believe that sending a spoken word interlude track was a setup. The placement and scores this song received may also lead you to believe it. This is because it is a setup. 

...but I don’t care, there is more plot development in this one song than some TV shows, it’s an engaging ride through and through, and I applaud Ghost’s vision in allowing a wider rate audience to experience this!

*submitted by /u/ghost-quartet*

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): *This was my pick and a lot of people seemed to be kind of confused about why, in a rate full of so many incredible songs, I chose to send this one, and the reason? I just thought it would be funny.*

---

#\*sniff\*

**beeozan** (10): .qp the best "hello" ever

**Catrick** (10): Popheads WISHED-no, they would get RELIGIOUS for achieving something this intimate 💅

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I love you Jill Scott

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Jilly from Philly you will always be famous!!!!!!

**flava** (10): as someone who did Neo-Soul Rate and saw the reveal, why are we doing this again, like we don’t need to do this again, why are you making the world relive Jillphobia

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/cV9aD1B.png

**nooodisaster** (10): FINE! You want me to rate the beat poem about sniffing a 10?! IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT?!

**qazz23** (10): good spoken word bit

**ReallyCreative** (10): please don’t rob this song it’s so clever and so good and spoken word is NOT a sin!!!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is quintessential Jill Scott im sorry,

**Stryxen** (10): the audacity… we had to acclaim

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): WHO IS JILL SCOTT?! idk album title! i just like a minimal sensual beat

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.5): this ending got me UP like dang this shot it REALLY high up on my rankings

**anothertown** (9): prices all over the dam place at that store

**JIRACHl** (9): She had a vision and she executed it in a camp manner. This was fun storytelling and it is one of the better ones on this rate.

**TiltControls** (9): how can anyone give a 0 to an album that has a pun like 'jilltro'

**vayyiqra** (9): 😳

**camerinian** (8.5): tbh girl should not be working the till if she's sniffling that much, go take a Sudafed and head back to bed with Raheem

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): she sniffed

**Adavman** (8): This makes me want to listen to spoken word poetry more often

**Ambrosia42** (8): oop!

**Awkward\_King** (8): this was a setup im sorry jill

**cremeebrulee** (8): the cashier said girl u reek

**seanderlust** (8): this story sends me every time

**slimboyfriend** (7.9): he eats MY ass EXCLUSIVELY

**phonethephoenix** (7.7): great delivery great journey

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Trying to figure out if whoever submitted this is a Jill Scott stan or…the opposite.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): ive been there (being really hungry afterwards . not the smelling part)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): Jill Scott can literally read a grocery list with this tone of voice & I would still listen huh

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**bogo** (7): so is the counter girl fucking her boyfriend or is she an ex, i need more details here

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this is fine, but having to listen to this song in an airport was… interesting!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (7): happy for her!

**ignitethephoenix** (7): an interesting submission but I appreciate the boldness of this (also it is iconic)

**indie\_fan\_** (7): has jill not suffered enough from the neo soul rate results

**Poydoo** (7): I am very confused

**imbaby122** (6.7): omg plot twist. *record scratch sound*

**Raindrac** (6.5): She's got a talent at telling an entertaining story, something that I don't hear very often in music. It's not meaningful or replayable enough to earn a higher score, but it's still great for what it is and I doubt she could've done the concept much better.

**runaway3212** (6.5): She's a slay but I think I would've preferred he loves me sorry gamers

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.5): why is this girl sniffing so much, like... relax babe

**bookthieving** (6): $1.50 for a pint of strawberries? just let her fuck your man jill

**jsonphile** (6): okay is this song ever going to start?

**pig-serpent** (6): The beat is really solid, but I'm trying to judge the spoken word part as poetry and it's not really doing anything for me.

**vexastrae** (6): when they recognize your man by his bed stank it is OVER for you

#\*SNIFF\*

**jman457** (5.5): A cute little skit but Jill scott was a bit set up with this pick

**starla\_** (5.5): low key

**frogaranaman** (5): sis she was on coke

**jay** (5): girl okay cute

**pijus41** (5): those are some expensive croissants

**SinfulAnarchy** (5): slam poets:

**steelstepladder** (5): This could have been any other Jill Scott song

**throwaway-7650** (5): 🧍

**welcome2thejam** (5): I commend the audacity to work so hard to win a Ratricks spot and send spoken word poetry

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4.5): Cool story bro.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): im very confused as to why this song was submitted to this rate because this sounds like an interlude?? like this album is good why did you send one of the spoken word pieces to this rate. that would be like if someone sent a song from a seat at the table but it was tina taught me. bad submission choice im sorry

**babadork** (3): I can’t tell if I’m grading this on a curve because I love Jill Scott or if skits/interludes are more acceptable when she does it.

**dreamingpastel** (3): A little strange at first, but I guess????

**impla77** (3): Don't know if the person that submitted this loves Jill Scott or hates Jill Scott

**bluetriangles04** (2): I have no clue what's going on here damn

**Nagisoid** (2): I was trippin' lookin' at my portfolio, wondering how I was gonna make enough dough, you know

**oscarbrierley1** (2): not a spoken word post sex interlude. its a no.

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): The one-two punch of this lady seductively reading her grocery list followed by 4 minutes and 33 seconds of silence was almost too much for me to bear

**kvothetyrion** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpvC8_NMXmU

**moonagenightmares** (1): uhhh…. okay 😭

**NotWith10000Men** (1): i am just not interested in other people's sex lives like that

**akanewasright** (10): I didn't grow up on Nickelodeon, so my first time hearing this song was actually in 2021... and well... I absolutely loved it. Between the silly ass songwriting (SMACK!) and Avril Lavigne's songwriting voice cutting through, I was absolutely enamored. I get why this was too much or too childish for some people, but MAN this song is a blast. Robbed a little I fear.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): SMACK! A song that was on my personal ratrick shortlist before it was submitted, i don’t care if it’s a clear Avril reject, or if Miranda has a strangely british accent in the chorus hook, this song delivers!!! i AM dancing crazy!!! i DID hear you say that!!!

*submitted by u/TragicKingdom1*

**TragicKingdom1** (10): *i know i submitted this but i really don't have a comment other than SMACK!*

---

#Everybody's raging raging crazy!

**1998tweety** (10): the SMACK takes me back to my childhood

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I think I may have only given Miranda Cosgrove 10’s in rates at this point…I’m correct for that tbh.

**cremeebrulee** (10): has anyone edited the SMACK into cupcakke's smack my ass like a drum yet

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/823335902268096532/982907368197214299/smack.gif

**DaHumanTorch** (10): SMACK!

**emayzee** (10): my favorite genre is "music that probably isn't objectively good but i just so happened to be 12 when it came out therefore it's excellent"

**frogaranaman** (10): PLUG.DJ ESSENTIALS

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): That “smack” she does during the chorus is her smacking the slay button.

**hunnybee12** (10): classic classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/u5U9ACr.png

**jay** (10): girl we all fainted

**mysario** (10): truly a masterpiece

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): i feel like anyone who remembers this being a popheads meme has spent too much of their life on this sub

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Loooooove the chorus.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Unironically this is so 2012 carly coded and I want her to cover it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): SMACK

**throwaway-7650** (10): SMACK!

**TiltControls** (10): SMACK

**Uberpigeon** (10): mirandroids rise up for your national anthem

**slimboyfriend** (9.8): mirstandas, get on your feet!!

**Ambrosia42** (9.4): why does this kind of sound like a Betty Boo song or something

**jackisboredtoday** (9): objectively terrible but god very few things have ever stuck with me like “I like you and you like me/we get together and we’re happy/didja hear me day that didja dijda dijda hear me say that? SNAP” so this one gets a rare camp high score

**seanderlust** (9): yes this is basic as hell but idc it's a bop! also i get that this is alphabetically sorted but if this came after Mama by MCR it would be peak playlist comedy

**Poydoo** (8.8): This song is pretty cute

**Frajer** (8.5): Carly finally taking advantage of Spencer's lack of authority

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Why did the disney/nick stars always do the british accent in these songs (see Hurricane by bridgit mendler)

**jman457** (8.3): camp Kesha core

**anothertown** (8): smacc

**jasannn** (8): SMACK

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): smack

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this is K-Mart Kidz Bop Kesha but I’m kinda living, dancing a little crazy rn

**vexastrae** (7.5): dan schneider you will not see the light of day

**bogo** (7): it’s very cheesy and a little juvenile but like, it’s catchy. SMACK

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): this is terrible but in a fun way

**impla77** (7): Imagine raging to this

**JIRACHl** (7): This would've been higher had I watched the show as a child

**Stryxen** (7): the random British accent ? 😭

**vayyiqra** (7): I feel like this is "objectively" really bad and clearly a Miley ripoff (whose music I cannot stand) but it also made me laugh and sometimes silly music is fun so it can have some points.

#SMACK!

**kvothetyrion** (6): Do you guys remember Hot Chelle Rae

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Why are you smacking me Miranda

**bigbigbee** (5.5): sounds like Love Letter by nugu kpop group Berry Good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): why does she sound british

**bulforster** (5): doing some of the cupcakke remixers' work for them I see

**pijus41** (5): am I crazy or is Carly pronouncing „dancing“ in a different accent

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (5): oh its the iCarly girl. i think i've established I never cared about the show but liked ned declassified. anyways rock on

**babadork** (4.5): It wasn’t until the day this rate was due that I realized that I’m not liking this song less the more I hear it and instead didn’t realize the song I like is “About You Now.”

**beeozan** (4.5): try and find an english comment on youtube

**flava** (4): SMACK

**jsonphile** (4): sorry miss Carly but man this production is god awful

**phonethephoenix** (4): I've always hated this refrain! there is something about it that works it way into your skull though. it is kind of a fun song

**pig-serpent** (4): The pre-chorus is absolute fire, but everything else about this song screams "cheap LADN teen pop" with little sonic coherence.

**starla\_** (4): this is annoying

**welcome2thejam** (4): I'm irrationally bothered by the way she pronounces "dancing"

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i cant do this anymore im sorry this is the end

**shadowtheweedhog** (3.2): this song would wake me up during anaesthesia to turn it off

**apatel27** (3): popheads take off your nostalgia goggles pls i beg

**bookthieving** (3): i just read jennette's memoir so +1 for being a good friend

**Nagisoid** (3): Wait, the SMACK! meme comes from this song?

**NotWith10000Men** (3): is she doing an accent?

**qazz23** (3): not a fan of this, sounds generic and too polished

**Raindrac** (3): Forgettable dance-pop. Dancing Crazy has a good enough hook that I can understand why there are some people out there who consider it the highlight of her discography, but it's just not good enough to draw me back. I've heard better. Can't say I'm surprised, though, as I had low expectations for Miranda Cosgrove and I usually don't care much for the music of ex-acts because music clearly isn't their best talent.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.5): no nostalgia, not vibing. actually the verses and post-chorus aren’t bad but the flat chorus aggressively lets it down for me.

**Adavman** (2): I had forgotten all about this track having not heard it since I was like 10 and I kinda wish that I could forget it again

**imbaby122** (2): i used to feel bad for miranda cosgrove and her failed music career but after hearing this song she definitely deserved it. raining sunshine is so good wtf went wrong here. i guess the melody is fine but why does she sound british? why are the lyrics so??? why???

**nooodisaster** (1): Oh god, what rate was this for

**shipperondeck** (1): god damn this shit annoying

#Avril Lavigne

**runaway3212** (10): What The Hell?

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): am I the only one who thinks she kinda sounds like Avril in this song?

**hikk** (8): all my life i've been good but now

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): main pop girl ~~Avril Lavigne~~ Miranda Cosgrove!

**bluetriangles04** (7): this might sound like an avril lavigne reject but its a good one at that

**oscarbrierley1** (4): d-side avril lavigne song

**camerinian** (3.5): finding out Avril Lavigne wrote this is the least surprised I've been about a bit of music trivia in an incredibly long time

**indie\_fan\_** (2.5): lmao this really is just avril lavigne - what the hell

**akanewasright** (9): I've said many times that Rihanna's sixth album *Talk That Talk* is HEAVILY frontloaded, to the point of me basically disliking everything after the halfway point. This song is the exception to that. This is an album cut written by Ester Dean, best known for writing hits like "Rude Boy" and "S&M", and her hard edged style continues to fit Rihanna like a goddamn glove. I probably overscored this just a touch, but I'm just really damn happy that a personal fave and non-single like this got sent to Ratrick at all. Considering how well known the competition is, this beating out a handful of songs is a win for RiRi. ~~I wouldn't be opposed to a GGGB rate if we *really* want to redeem her though...~~

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): I don’t really have much to say about this song, it’s just an alright album cut, and I think most raters ultimately felt the same, with this having one of the lowest controversy scores in the rate and still being in the bottom 10.

*submitted by /u/jackisboredtoday* 

**jackisboredtoday** (11): *Apologies for 11’ing my own submission but i want to make sure someone does, since its my most played song from my most played artist and I KNEW we are never rating talk that talk again. The best for this is so icy and ridiculously good and it’s one of Rihanna’s best songs from her peak horny era, with Rihanna bringing what she’s always done best: attitude. I know it’s a thing to talk about how her album tracks this era were bad but I really gravitated to this song since the first time I heard it in middle school and I really do think it’s a gem*

#for your ears only

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): hot hot hot hot

**runaway3212** (10): Just a perfect song all in all why lie

**seanderlust** (10): rihanna truly didn't miss with bangers during the talk that talk era huh

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): this reminds me of when i went to the local chinese restaurant / cuban restaurant / dance club and they played this

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): i miss her so bad...

**phonethephoenix** (9): rocking out to this song!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): These synths r fun

**Frajer** (8.5): we have Rude Boy at home

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): why is "I'm gonna let you in on a dirty secret, i just wanna be loved" such a gut punch. like top ten cinematic plot twists.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): Considering this is basically "Rude Boy Part 2" it makes me wonder why Knife Party/Pendulum never branched out into doing more pop productions, their style(s) could’ve worked really well in a pop sense.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**bogo** (8): idk the consensus on rihanna deep cuts so to me this seemed like a bit of a left field pick but hearing it for the first time i completely get it, this slays

**CrimsonROSET** (8): not my favorite rih song but it’s more than we’ll get for the rest of the decade so

**flava** (8): the way I saw this was on Talk That Talk and just assumed the song would suck

**pijus41** (8): this could play while a mafia boss settles a deal in the back of a club

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): honestly this sounds like an ai generated rihanna song but it slaps so who cares !

**vayyiqra** (8): Really like the dark sound of this but also I've never been *that* big on Rihanna and have never heard this before so no thoughts

**ignitethephoenix** (7.9): a filler bop, but a bop nonetheless

**kvothetyrion** (7.5): The verse melody of this one is noticeably similar to the chorus of Rude Boy, but it’s still Rihanna doing Rihanna things, it’s fun. I like the little single-line prechorus a lot.

**TiltControls** (7.5): interesting rihanna pick, but a tasteful one

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (7.5): "This daring Roc Me Out song by Rihanna is very thrilling to listen to and I am most likely going to remember the song for multiple years to come (especially knowing that this song was in one of my sleeptime dreams multiple years ago-at least well over 4 years ago)"

**jman457** (7.2): love Rihanna but this isn’t one of my fav deep cuts from her

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): it does kinda feel like all of Rihanna’s hits mashed together, like this was clearly a blueprint song but she really improved on the formula

**Awkward\_King** (7): thank u jack

**bluetriangles04** (7): I'm sure I heard this sometime in the early-mid 2010s when I had to attend every single volleyball game my sister played in. This just sounds like it was made to be played during that...

**hunnybee12** (7): this got me thinking if "yeah" is the most used song in popular music.. i bet it is

**slimboyfriend** (7): this is like rude boy with no sauce

**Stryxen** (7): this has randomly grows on me and I regret not 10ing it vibes

**vexastrae** (7): imagine if this rate manifested R9 OMG WHO SAID THAT

**welcome2thejam** (7): Scores solidly on the bad bitch meter

#i just wanna be loved

**imbaby122** (6.5): sooooooo 2010

**nooodisaster** (6): Screaming that I've literally saved every other track on Talk That Talk surrounding this one, like you chose the ONE deep cut that didn't click with me.

**Poydoo** (6): Roc? Like the bird?

**qazz23** (6): not very memorable, she definitely has better

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is like discount Rude Boy

**starla\_** (5.5): not one of her best, production sounds really tinny

**anothertown** (5): it's kind of giving generic club music on a cw show

**apatel27** (5): Of all the Rihanna songs available why this one?

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): you're telling me someone won a ratrick slot and chose this..

**camerinian** (4): radio station surfing while carsick type beat

**Catrick** (4): Rihanna has some great songs but there’s several that just don’t do it for me, this is one of them.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I love when artists recycle their own songs to make shittier ones

**jsonphile** (4): this sounds like a weaker version of rude boy, a song I already don’t care for

**Nagisoid** (4): Girl... The Bones

**Raindrac** (4): Hey, it's "Rock Me In" by Britney Spears on opposite day! Unfortunately, it's not as good. Fairly generic dance-pop with mediocre hooks and not much to say.

**shadowtheweedhog** (4): let me out actually im done

**pig-serpent** (3.5): I've never particularly considered myself a Rihanna anti, but the more of her music I hear the more I tend to find her music both unengaging and unenjoyable.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Yeah I don’t really miss this specific early 2010’s pop sound too much.

**akanewasright** (10): I've said this before, and I'll say it again: this song is how you stretch one joke into a full song without wearing it out. The sense of escalation is *excellent*, as are the screams from the delightfully demonic Lil Mariko. Some people didn't like this being here as a joke song, or didn't find it very funny (as someone who was in high school in 2018, I basically lived through this song, so it's *very* funny to me), but I like this one and am happy this rate reminded me of how much I love it.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I swear this song is not just a meme to me, it’s something special, it’s important, it’s history, it needs to be studied in a museum, it needs the respect it was so desperately deprived of here.

*submitted to The Wheel of Un-Luck by /u/thedoctordances1940* 

**thedoctordances1940** (10): *while this is a meme song I do just have to say that even without comedic lyrics this song would be fantastic which can't be said about a lot of musical comedy (which is part of the reason i tend to not like musical comedy very often) but like this just has amazing noisy production and lil mariko can fucking scream. anyway thank you for reading my overanalysis of a song that is so clearly not meant to be taken seriously.*

#hey guys, have you seen my rate win?

**bulforster** (11): real music

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Slaps. Next question. Not a hint of irony. Perfectly constructed and produced. Impeccable build. I am shooting a gun into the air. Should win. If it doesn't and I see you gave it less than a 7, I'm commenting "Coward. Fix your heart." on any post you make on this sub from now until the end of time.

**Uberpigeon** (11): Hey, have you guys seen my 11? I like literally just had it in my ballot... Like, you gave it a good score, right? I let you hit my 11, and then you gave it an 10. You didn't eliminate it, did you? You wouldn't do that to me. So like, have you seen it? Where is it? Seriously, like, where is it? It's not okay

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bigbigbee** (10): This is Asian American excellence

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): They actually made a very profound artistic statement here and if you don’t get it…idk maybe visit your local library??

**bluetriangles04** (10): I had an irl friend tell me this song was annoying when it was everywhere on TikTok and I get it but also... YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND UNTIL YOU'VE HAD THE FULL EXPERIENCE! genuinely any lil mariko and full tac song just hits different.

**cremeebrulee** (10): where is her pulitzer

**DirtyRat583** (10): thrilling thinkpiece on the effects of addiction on an individual and their fear of withdrawal being forced upon them. props to the chef

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/xPRPVqm.png

**impla77** (10): A harrowing tale of addiction

**jay** (10): girl the rate winner

**JIRACHl** (10): Listening to this gives the same effects as hitting a juul and it's way healthier! Protect your lungs kids!

**memezaharamole** (10): the background vocals of "OMG, help me look!" sound like field recordings taken from the habitat of some of the worst people you know. Sorry, guys!

**nooodisaster** (10): I feel like you can only rate this a 1 or a 10 for some reason. And for some reason, I'm feeling a 10. She's just really committed. And should be committed.

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): this song is actually genius and poignant social commentary on addiction and withdrawal

**plastichaxan** (10): The tanking I’ve seen for this that I almost 11d… Criminal. Us camp fans suffer so much in rates it’s sad

**Poydoo** (10): Remember, kids, don't smoke ❤

**ricki** (10): why is she romanticizing addiction? :/

**runaway3212** (10): if this was BABYMETAL y'all would eat it up

**seanderlust** (10): i'm sorry yall this just rips

**shipperondeck** (10): the impact

**Stryxen** (10): lizzo - phone

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): for some people this isnt even a song this is a lifestyle

**throwaway-7650** (10): should've won meme rate...

**TiltControls** (10): WHERE'S MY RATE WINNER

**vayyiqra** (10): The whole career of Lil Mariko is one nonstop shitpost and this is not an exception

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): did you use a michigan state ID of someone who looked vaguely like you to buy juul pods for a bro in yr freshman dorm? did you attend multiple house parties in 2017 and 18 where the juul was the most coveted item and people request "mint, nicotine, or mango" pods and ranked them? did you ever park your car on the beach and be introduced to a young woman who manufactured "bootleg" juuls that were 1% more strength than regular juuls? did you cry when they basically outlawed Juul bc big tobacco was taking such a huge L + Ratio from a new technology they needed to use old money and old 20th century tactics to fuck 'em over? all while never actually hitting a Juul in your life? I mean, in spite of being a chronic weed enthusiast, I've maintained a purposeful abstention from nicotine (Project DARE worked y'all!) especially having watched basically everyone around me get into vaping during late high school up through 2018. shit sucked ass and the juul was always there, as both a meme and an evil evil crux; while very rare, people died from this shit, but the Juul enshrined twitch mechanics in teenage nicotine consumption that are a legitimate plague and very very dismaying. anyways Full Tac, three years too fucking late mind you, captures the utter insanity of the Juul...the exact type of person (femme coded but not always femme) going through the exact beats under an instrumental that prolly captures what nicotine withdrawls feel like. brilliant meme. anyways has anyone seen my bong Bastro? It was just right here and I rlly need a snap. like it was just right her-oh whoops I moved it! you wanna split this bowl :)

**Ambrosia42** (9.4): exactly

**DaHumanTorch** (9.3): those that get it get it

**slimboyfriend** (9.3): I fell like I need to refer to this song as a “piece”

**Awkward\_King** (9): every girl wants to be her but few have been the trauma she's been through

**camerinian** (9): is this Lingua Ignota

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the fact a juul is already outdated

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Juuls are a blight upon society but this is fun

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the calm to ridiculously anxiously angry is so relatable as someone who is constantly losing stuff

**pijus41** (9): lovely song for a family picnic

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Rouge The Bat when her Master Emerald gets stolen

**welcome2thejam** (9): This is just Shoes for the modern era

**jman457** (8.6): I love how in the music video when she says pocket, she pulls it out of her bra.

**anothertown** (8): it's an important lesson to help keep your loved ones vape out of the bed or couch. this is the marriage advice of this day of age.

**beeozan** (8): so (not) cool!

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): elementary schoolers according to /r/teachers:

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): imagine a drag race lipsync to this…

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Gen Z stoner cosplay

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): it’s in your fucking pocket

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): art tbh

**vexastrae** (7.5): we need a modern day remake of dude wheres my car called dude wheres my juul

**bogo** (7): you're not gonna get the song the first time you hear it. after the second and third time, you're gonna be like, “whoa, what is this?”. it sounds nothing... nothing like anything that's out right now. um... you know, the lyrics are very... um...

**jasannn** (7): I despise vapers.

**Raindrac** (7): It's a humorous novelty song, but My Microphone by Poppy already did the "OH NO! I LOST THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO ME! ...Oh, there it is." concept better by having a strong hook that brought it some replay value once the novelty wore off. Where's My Juul got old quickly and I don't have any desire to revisit it. It's fun while it lasts, though— that production goes hard.

**pig-serpent** (6): It's not particularly good at being nu-metal so it's carried on novelty factor, which is pretty high specifically because of the loud barking sound that reminds me of "Who Let the Dogs Out?"

**qazz23** (6): where is it? try finding your jumper first

RandomHypnotica: #SO NOT COOL

**Adavman** (5.5): Genuinely have no idea how to rate this. This is somehow both the best and worst thing I have ever heard.

**Roxieloxie** (5.5): I think i didnt know how to rate this in its initial rate and so i gave it an unsure 10 and like 2 years later im still kinda unsure so im giving it the absolute middle because i dont know how ?? i feel

**imbaby122** (5): i am a fighter 💪 (i vape until i can feel my lungs collapse whenever i’m drunk but somehow have not developed a nicotine addiction and therefore cannot relate to this song) stay safe y’all.

**jsonphile** (4): this is somehow both hilarious camp and also just unpleasant garbage. I could give this a 1, or maybe a 7. So I’ll just split the difference

**kappyko** (3): aged like milk

**shadowtheweedhog** (2.9): can we stop inviting her everywhere she keeps losing her juul and i can't listen to her trying to find it

**frogaranaman** (2): points for creativity. not saying if it’s adding points or removing points

**babadork** (1): I’ve hated that 3OH!3 song too long to not give them my 0, but this was really tempting me.

**flava** (1): girl just give up the smoking addiction

**moonagenightmares** (1): cringe

**mysario** (1): if "Where's The Chapstack?" was Paranormal Activity 1, then this is Paranormal Activity 6 The Ghost Dimension

**Nagisoid** (1): A trap metal song about drugs sounds like it was engineered in a lab not to appeal to me

**NotWith10000Men** (1): yall have got to be fucking kidding me

**ReallyCreative** (1): what a moment this was (derogatory)

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): I had a roommate who was a nicotine addict like this

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): I hate this so much

**apatel27** (0): Just stfu already. This kind of song is the worst scourge on modern pop discussion spaces. Haha so ironic you see it's bad but that's the point 🤪🤪🤪. It's maximilist music made by people with no musical ability so they make up for it by being as obnoxious as possible but they get a pass cause the fans are usually just as obnoxious

**dreamingpastel** (0): Idk what this is, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask

**emayzee** (0): is this not vanessa hudgens

**Frajer** (0): Vaping is bad for you they're doing her a favor

**indie\_fan\_** (0): anyone who's familiar with my previous rankings should not be surprised by this 0

**kvothetyrion** (0): Grimes and her consequences have been a disaster for the human race.

**starla\_** (0): what the fuck

**akanewasright** (10): *sigh*. *Rare* may have been my least favorite in the recent Ex Acts rate, but I was a hardcore Selenator for a few years, and in particular, I fucking LOVED *Revival*. As someone who grew up with Selena and her music, it was so cool to hear her switch it up and do cool things with her voice and the production. This was one of my favorites off that album - a silly and simple little synth pop song with an octave spanning chorus that made me briefly think Selena could sing. And that bridge - it's corny and it's not that impressive, but after reading about how Selena had only *just* gotten comfortable with putting her speaking voice in her music, it was so cool to hear her make her speaking voice such a pivotal part of the song. I get why this isn't a favorite for a lot of y'all, but idk, this one makes me happy.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): This kinda outsold every song from Rare

*submitted by /u/oliviagodrigo* 

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): *yes i am 11’ing my own pick like that’s my mama, yall don’t make me delete my account again please i’m only 2 years old why would you kill a 2 year old*

#The Rhythm

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**hikk** (10): revival had a couple smashas we have to admit it!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/dOjCskg.png

**jasannn** (10): Y’all better not do my 11 runner-up dirty

**runaway3212** (10): Selena Gomez a bopster like we've never seen before

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): shoutout to /u/selegend! gotta be one of my favorite deleted users

**throwaway-7650** (10): SONGENIALITY

**vayyiqra** (10): In truth this should be my 11 because *Revival* is one of my favourite pop albums of the 2010s and this is one of the best tracks on it; however I am not so foolish as to 11 a Selena Gomez song in a grab bag rate.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): she was cooking with the neeEEeeEEeeEEd part

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): underrated understated bop

**Ambrosia42** (9.3): back when her music slayed

**cremeebrulee** (9): this is such a random song to send but it's one of my faves by her so idm

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): this is actually so good for a selena track

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): If she could sing this would be an 11!

**JIRACHl** (9): She needs to come back to making pussy music those liquid blushes can wait!

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Why did I think she was singing “Everybody wants to get touched, everybody wants to get sucked”? I genuinely thought that was she was singing “get sucked” but no, she’s singing “get SOME”. First the “farting carrots” line in Good For You and now this?? Selena is a mondegreen genius lemme tell ya.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): why is this actually good

**bluetriangles04** (8): I remember Shazaming this in an Under Armor store after my mom asked me "Doesn't that sound like Selena Gomez?" It was and... I am a fan of chill, boring, retail tunes like this one. Even though that bridge kinda sucks in comparison to every other aspect of the song.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): Selena Gomez & The Scene & The Rhythm

**jman457** (8): truly shows mediocrity can make bops

**Nagisoid** (8): "Let the chemicals do its stuff" Selena's new kidney after the transplant:

**phonethephoenix** (8): okay wait this is the best non-scene Selena Gomez song I've heard I think

**qazz23** (8): decently catchy dance-pop

**shadowtheweedhog** (8): gotta keep my ear out for selena gomez because shes really got it good, one of her best songs except for As A Blonde

**Uberpigeon** (7.8): ive been assuming her songs must be bad this whole time oh...

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this song has grown on me everytime i've listened to it so to fix that i will stop listening to it

**kvothetyrion** (7.5): Surprisingly fun! I like the idea of Selena Gomez, a teen pop idol who is also friends with elderly comedians Steve Martin and Martin Short. Good for her!

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I'm genuinely amazed at how well the producers managed to hide Selena's total lack of charisma as a performer!  That's not even something the best songs on Rare could do!  On top of that, I always forget how cool steel drums sound because of how overused they were in bad music around 2016.

**Raindrac** (7.5): Perhaps I should've listened to this sooner! I haven't heard much music by Selena Gomez, but this is very energetic and I'm surprised by how good her vocals sound.

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): me when I'm the spark and I am coming out of the dark

**vexastrae** (7.5): maybe if salina moved to this rhythm .....

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): a nice track but one I forget about sometimes when I put on Revival stuff

**indie\_fan\_** (7): alexa play Selena Gomez's mic feed Me & The Rhythm on the Today Show

**pijus41** (7): the semi-spoken bridge feels kind of pointless, but otherwise quite a fun song

**shipperondeck** (7): a pop song

**Stryxen** (7): I see the vision very clearly. Some of the transitions between lines of the lyrics are clunky as hell tho

#SALINA MOVE

**slimboyfriend** (6.8): not as good as when she’s with her girls

**imbaby122** (6.7): i swear i have heard this in an american eagle. or an aeropostale.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I think this is a good song, but it's missing something

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is a classic Selena 6.

**bogo** (6): ex-acts made me realize that selena’s typical brand of dance-pop didn’t really hit for me much, and while this song is a little catchy it’s still not an exception

**jdmun148** (6): Needs a stronger chorus hook

**nooodisaster** (6): Was gonna rate a 3 but then I remembered selegend <3

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I'm tired Salina

**impla77** (5.5): babes, we’ve all seen your dancing.. I think you need a bit more than the rhythm, also wtf is that bridge lol

**anothertown** (5): i fel asleep

**apatel27** (5): middle of the pack 80s throwback synthpop

**beeozan** (5): this is not the rhythm that's taking me to a different place

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I’m sorry but I don’t get the Selena Gomez appeal - she has like two 10s and then a bunch of “yeah this is fine” songs

**jay** (5): girl the nothing burger

**jsonphile** (5): Selena Gomez is not the best singer, so the quality of her songs depend entirely on how well the song fits her. This isn’t one of those songs

**starla\_** (5): it's certainly no Hands to Myself

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (5): ****me, seeing the album cover**** is that a vicki's secret bra? got cool straps ngl.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Sounds like a decent modern day pop hit

**bulforster** (4.9): is she always the worst part of her own music?

**plastichaxan** (4): Is the rhythm in the room with us

**ReallyCreative** (4): well it’s certainly not her and the key

**sarcasticsobs** (4): Her vocals have rarely if ever done anything for me. Utterly inoffensive. At least the instrumental isn't bad? Oop, bad bridge.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): this has got to be a set-up

**camerinian** (3): the chorus on its own immediately pushed this down from like an 8. Selena can't help but get in her own way every time she's on to something good and it is so frustrating

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): no nostalgia, not vibing. it sounds so hollow and mechanical, especially in the chorus.

**TiltControls** (1): there are some nice parts to the track, but everything else just weighs it down

**RandomHypnotica** (10): as much as I’m a ride or die for Leighton Meester (she was maybe my first celebrity crush), this song just isn’t quite as catchy as the other cobra starship song I won’t mention because everybody else did instead. That being said, it’s still a fun piece of late 00’s pop trash and I can’t help but love it.

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song is a lot of fun, but (imo) it suffers because a brasher, wilder, and trashier song was also in the rate (and beat it out). This obviously has a lot of charm on its own, but I've observed a lot of comparisons to the 3OH!3 song (and to "Make Me Feel") that probably hurt this song.

#Good Girls

**jsonphile** (11): am I a terrible person for giving this my 11? Maybe. Should all my other ratings be thrown out because this rating proves I have terrible taste and nothing I say should be taken seriously? Possibly. But am I doing it anyway? Absolutely. Something about this stupid, trashy song is just music to my ears. Nostalgia definitely has something to do with it, but I don’t know I just kinda love this song. I think part of it is the fact that it’s a joke song, like if this was played straight it would be terrible, but this almost sounds like a Lonely Island type of song in the best way.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): so aggressively heterosexual it loops back around into being a slutbop

**1998tweety** (10): the girl absolutely devoured this

**Ambrosia42** (10): a classic for real

**anothertown** (10): i wish they could have made more slop with kevin rudolf. i wish the world was difference

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Went double platinum on middle school BleepBloop’s orange iPod.

**bluetriangles04** (10): my sister forcing me to watch gossip girl with her as a kid and also my affinity for trashy pop radio classics culminated into this major event... what an iconic song!

**cremeebrulee** (10): to anyone who thinks “you make me feel…” is better than this, you are sick in the head

**CrimsonROSET** (10): POPHEADS DON’T FUCK THIS ONE UP

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): fuckin nerds

**dreamingpastel** (10): It's got everything! Synths, guitar, Leighton Meester of Gossip Girl fame sounding like a main pop girl, and a fantastic bridge and post-bridge breakdown!

**flava** (10): so unbelievably fun

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the best song ever made (this is an 11, damn you Clearest Blue) whose idea was to put two of the best songs ever made in the same rate???

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/6DwfZUI.png

**jay** (10): girl the collapse

**mysario** (10): why is this in a Redemption Rate? it's the perfect song, there's nothing to redeem about it

**phonethephoenix** (10): yet another middle school banger!! this changed my brain chemistry somehow

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): an eleven contender

**Roxieloxie** (10): I dont even know if i like this one that much but I think the girl having 5 best friends is really funny. I know earlier I was talking shit about dont trust me but this one outsells so hard

**starla\_** (10): still wishing I had 5 best friends

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this raised a generation

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): it’s giving university flashbacks

**amr** (9): I still maintain it's white colorism that blake lively blew up but leighton meester didn't. only one of them did good girls go bad...!

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): the way they made the perfect choice for a feature because leighton was the IT girl then

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i miss being 12

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): pop off Blair Waldorf

**emayzee** (8.7): i remember being 11 and going to a journeys mall store to buy a pair of converse while this song was playing and just thinking to myself "I feel so mature right now"

**bulforster** (8.5): ah so what DONTTRUSTME was missing was the hoe in question's perspective yes

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): If someone released this song today I would throw rocks at them but as a throwback it’s intoxicating.

**ricki** (8.5): we are heading into a recession can we go back to the 2010s glittery trashy nightclub aesthetic

**vexastrae** (8.5): OKAYYYY the nostalgia for the early 2010s this is giving me like ... im a sucker for this kind of trashy pop im sorry its true its true!

**Awkward\_King** (8): NEED the cobra starship/3oh!3/lmfao rate

**DaHumanTorch** (8): this camp classic

**Frajer** (8): okay but Leighton and Gabe would make a hot couple

**ignitethephoenix** (8): go piss girl!

**kvothetyrion** (8): My aunt went to high school with the lead singer of Cobra Starship. I met him once, he seemed nice. Fun song, love me some maximalist late-00s radio pop. Bonus points for the almost shockingly stupid breakdown section towards the end. Also go piss girl.

**nooodisaster** (8): Amazing depression-era pop. All the weird fun facts just seem so perfectly suited, like OF COURSE.

**pig-serpent** (8): A band that's more fun than good, but I always appreciate guitars being used for texture in electronic/dance songs.  As such, I'll always have a soft spot for their first album.

**runaway3212** (8): a whole banger and a few

**Stryxen** (8): gay son AND thot daughter

**vayyiqra** (8): Why did we let this band have the cultural grip on us that we did in the 2000s? Questions that defy answering. With your brain off, this bangs though. (Dear god, the Daft Punk vocoder and the "Hollaback Girl" vibes on the bridge. The 2000s were certainly a time for pop music.)

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): fun but repetitive

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Tag yourself, I'm the bit where the vocoder goes "Good girls go BaAaAa! BaAaAa! BaAaAa!".

**slimboyfriend** (7.4): I literally don’t remember ever hearing guitars in this song

**jman457** (7.2): What ever  happened to Blair Waldorf’s music career

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): I’ve seen an X-Men: Evolution AMV set to this song

**hunnybee12** (7): not as good as my 10 year old self made me believe

**seanderlust** (7): fun but also there's a little bleep in the background on the prechorus and chorus that does not go with the song which is hard not to focus on once you hear it.

**throwaway-7650** (7): rihanna >>>>>

**babadork** (6.5): Maybe streaming has made it too easy to find shitty but catchy songs, because this used to feel more special.

**shadowtheweedhog** (6.5): what donttrustme wishes it had

RandomHypnotica: #Gone Bad

**imbaby122** (6): you make me feel so… undeniably devoured good girls go bad. like ripped off the meat, snapped the bones, sucked out the marrow, left not a crumb of meat on the bone, and washed it all down with an ice cold glass of water. but all mindless party music awakens something in me.

**camerinian** (5.5): if we were rating on the pH scale this would be an instant 11 (heavily basic)

**apatel27** (5): The cheer section is like the rap section of kpop songs

**bigbigbee** (5): fake ass frayuns

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (5): this is 2 teen beach songs in a trench coat

**Raindrac** (5): Good Girls Go Bad has potential, but that potential is shattered by how the most important hook of the song sounds like garbage. Gabe Saporta's vocals just don't sound good in the chorus. It's a shame, as this could've been a fun late '00s dance-pop song.

**beeozan** (4): this actually grew on me a little bit but that bridge…

**bogo** (4): late 2000s/early 2010s dance-pop either really hits for me or it really doesn’t. this is a swing and a miss, the production is kinda weak

**lexiareder** (4): I don't enjoy the memories that this brings up. I don't know exactly what those memories are, but nothing about the song really forces me to ignore that

**sarcasticsobs** (4): I left this in the past, but happy if you're still having fun!

**Uberpigeon** (4): and zendaya is meester

**shipperondeck** (3): you will never be 3oh!3

**TiltControls** (3): this is like a time capsule pt. 2, except this one probably could've stayed in the ground

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): This is what I hate about late 2000s electronic party music, it appeals to the male fantasy

**pijus41** (2): Can't believe Rihanna was so moved by this song she centered an entire album about it's after effects

**Poydoo** (2): Sorry but this song is ass

**Adavman** (1): This is awful. But at least it is actually music, so it avoids the 0

**Nagisoid** (1): I'm sorry but Rihanna cannot be replicated and it offends me that this song implies that

**qazz23** (1): this is very repetitive and i hate the vocals

**ReallyCreative** (1): musical mustard gas

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (1): stop destroying women

**welcome2thejam** (1): If I was a spy trying to disguise myself as a pophead this is probably the score that gets me caught. (Their Snakes on a Plane song is a 10 though)

**DirtyRat583** (0): this isnt THAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT bad its just worse than everything else here

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): when I was a child and in scouts, on one particularly large camp they had this karaoke stage set up where all the different troops would go on stage and sing a song. I was sitting in the audience next to a friend we’ll call Liv, and there was another friend we’ll call Sabrina on the other side. I was just fiddling with the gravel we were sitting on when I felt a rock hit me and I looked up to see Sabrina flipping me off and really angry. We were all getting ready to go on stage a moment later and I was really confused and she was angry at me because she said a rock hit her and she knew it was me because I was playing with them on the ground, but I knew I didn’t do it and that it must’ve been Liv, but she was agreeing with Sabrina and saying that was so uncool of me. So i was confused and hurt and we all went on stage and started to sing this song, but I was crying all through the performance because of everything that had happened (i was also at the front because I was short). 

Anyway, this song is ok.

**akanewasright** (8): This was such a fun submission! On top of obviously being timely (nothing but respect for MY #1 summer blockbuster) "Barbie Girl" is just one of the catchiest songs ever. This hook is so silly, so inane, so simple that it's absolutely unforgettable. This didn't make it that far in the rate in the grand scheme of things, but it did come on top as the highest placing song from the "Meme Song" rate, which is a worthwhile accomplishment on its own.

*submitted by /u/vexastrae*

**vexastrae** (10): *hi everybody! this is my ratrick pick, inspired by the upcoming barbie movie and the phenomenal performance of vengabus in the indieheads charity rate as its rate villain >:) this beat out 50 contenders for my pick, including "Björk - Pluto" and "Rina Sawayama - Tokyo Love Hotel" which are both in this rate! "Charli XCX - Trophy" was one of my top contenders, but (un)fortunately she was spared from the tragedy of losing yet another rate rip*

*to give you an idea of what my pick would have looked like in a different universe, heres a few contenders that didnt make the cut: "black midi - bmbmbm"; "cupcakKe - Squidward Nose"; "Doja Cat - MOOO!"; "Kendrick Lamar - For Free? Interlude"; "Nicki Minaj - Stupid Hoe"; "Shygirl - FREAK"* 

*also i told the person who submitted bloodbuzz ohio i gave them a 0 and they said [this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/896148582699266058/1090659404044574780/image.png) not knowing i picked it ... jumpscare*

#It's Fantastic!

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**anothertown** (10): danish pop is the best subgenre of scandipop don't change my mind

**beeozan** (10): if I had raindrac's rating calculator and a retrospective omni-scrobbling last.fm I probably would've 11'd this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): If you give this a bad score, you should have something revoked. Not sure what…but something

**Catrick** (10): vote Eurodance rate pls ❤️

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): why were Aqua on an “All You Need Is Love” cover with LUCIANO PAVAROTTI and Enrique Iglesias and Eurythmics?? okayy thanks Spotify for telling me this…

**DirtyRat583** (10): this is the most culturally significant thing since the library of alexandria

**hikk** (10): THE SMASHA

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is honestly the Queen of all camp songs, no one can do it like them

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/0EZ1lCv.png

**Nagisoid** (10): The Vengabus in IH Charity walked so Barbie Girl could run

**pig-serpent** (10): Aqua was the pop act I loved when I still "hated" pop music, and it's always pained me to see how many people hate this song.  Aqua's instrumentation is always a surprisingly lush arrangement of classical instruments, some rarely seen in pop music like the harpsichord, which contrasts nicely with the bad sex gimmicks that give them their identity.  Barbie Girl may not be their best song, but it's representative of both their sound and their knack for great pop hooks and I just wish that mainstream culture would stop trashing it.

**pijus41** (10): this feels like something a scandinavian bubblegum pop would make in- oh wait, it is. a classic.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): 2023 is the year of the bimbo

**vayyiqra** (10): As a kid this song would get stuck in my head and the ironic lyrics being about gender roles of course went over my head (I was 8) so I thought it was simply a silly song about dolls, and did not want to admit to liking a song that was "for girls". But now I'm grown up and can fully see the vision ... I'll argue this aged very well and was perhaps even an important forerunner to hyperpop, and the video is also iconic, so I'm feeling "it's a serve why lie?". Here's another anecdote: a couple of years ago I was at my parents' house and couldn't sleep, and was on a Discord call with Tabby (love them) in the middle of the night, fully ADHD-rambling about how when I was a kid I didn't feel like it was cool to like pop music and named Aqua as one such group I liked but would never admit it back then, but now I would. Thing is I was talking louder than I thought and woke up my parents. Cringe! But great song. Also my brother had this album on CD and would play it all the time without caring what anyone thought so he was based for that.

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): "COME AWN BARRHHBEE LES GUH PAHHRRTEEE" she did nothing wrong except shine a mirror on a dystopian hellscape. we should have listened!! anyways what's the over/under on this ending up in the Barbie movie? if the greta gerbs + noah baumbachy brain trust could make it work, it'd rule.

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): iconic

**jasannn** (9.5): This Sim 2 FMV for this song, specially this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvP24g_Kcp4 was a core part of my childhood for some reason

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Aqua have so many better songs than this, we should have done that Aqua/Dee-Lite/RuPaul/Vengaboys rate I used to submit.

**oscarbrierley1** (9): yasss such a slay song

**phonethephoenix** (9): iconic and catchy as hell

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): This is one of those guilty pleasure kinda bops, y’know what I mean?

**seanderlust** (9): "i'm a bobby girl, in a bobby world" - me stanning bobby shmurda

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): had Mattel literally shaking

**kvothetyrion** (8.5): There’s nothing I love more than eurotrash, and while the instrumental Barbie Girl doesn’t live up to an Everytime We Touch or a Better Off Alone, the back-and-forth vocals are so fuckin’ dumb that I can’t help but love it. I mean, his voice is TERRIBLE. Other than Mew and LEGO, one of the mots important things to emerge from Denmark.

**emayzee** (8.3): personally i was a bratz girl

**shipperondeck** (8.1): so i guess "my boobs are made of plastic" was a line made up by my 3rd grade classmates on the playground

**bluetriangles04** (8): now this one's a classic... with that said though, looking through these lyrics on Spotify and whew... I should NOT have been allowed to jam out to this as a child

**CrimsonROSET** (8): kelly key you’ll forever be famous

**Frajer** (8): Candyman is an 11 but this song goes too hard on the whole Eurodance trope where Ken sounds like a John Wick villain while Barbie sounds like an angel

**impla77** (8): Points docked bc there is no way that in Ken’s voice

**jdmun148** (8): This is a guilty pleasure

**nooodisaster** (8): More influential & iconic than several main pop girls careers. I feel like I need to watch a few more video essays before I see the genius, but it's a full bop.

**starla\_** (8): Doctor Jones outsold

**Raindrac** (7.8): I thought that this would be my first time listening to the song before I clicked play, but once the chorus kicked in it became clear that I've heard it before. There was a slight kick of nostalgia, just enough to ring a bell. And unsurprisingly, it turned out that this song was a hit right near the beginning of my childhood. Barbie Girl isn't the most replayable song, but I appreciate it for the memories.

**jman457** (7.6): Its a fun summer song, but there always something a little annoying about it.

**slimboyfriend** (7.6): this song had such an irreparable yassification to any child who heard it

**apatel27** (6.5): It's a classic but only for the chorus

**ricki** (6.5): i feel so smart for knowing why this won’t be in the barbie movie

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): my city gets earthquakes every so often, and I remember a very vivid incident from when I was an adolescent where we got a little bit of a shake in a cafe while Barbie Girl played overhead.

**dreamingpastel** (5): The chorus is pretty great, but everything else is kinda not

**mysario** (5): if this isn't in the Barbie Movie (2023), we riot

**jackisboredtoday** (4.6): it’s camp (derogatory)

**TheQueenofVultures** (4.5): its a fun novelty but never really does much for me after that

**IIIHenryIII** (4): if this is not part of the movie soundtrack, I’ll be calling my lawyers

**jsonphile** (4): okay I don’t know how old I was when I learned this was a real song and not just a rhyme that kids in elementary school sang but it was probably embarrassingly old

**runaway3212** (4): Ava Max did it better

**just\_thonking** (3): Unfortunately I find it more annoying than endearing

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Okay, maybe ignore my 3OH!3 comment, maybe I do hate fun? Like, I LIKE a lot of Eurodance, but this does nothing for me. And the dude drops this score down even more for my tastes

**Roxieloxie** (2.2): im too young to have any feelings on this

**jay** (1): girl ava cleared

**moonagenightmares** (1): my god i cant stand this song

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): this song is honestly proof that europeans are awful

**bogo** (0): i don’t like europop, it sounds really plastic and fake, which yeah i get that this is a song about a plastic doll but still everything just sounds too clean and smoothed out here for me. also i hate ken doll man’s voice he sounds like a creepy middle aged man

**camerinian** (0): just as shrill and aggravating as the day it first came into my life, which may as well be the day I was born for how much this awful, awful song has felt like it's pursued me everywhere I go. The revisionism given by the reanalysis of all the baggage around Eurodance and Barbie as a cultural icon doesn't erase the fact that, at its core, this composition and performances are fucking insufferable dogshit. it's bubblegum in the worst way possible because it's unfathomably sticky, oppressively sugary, and yet with every single new chew it grows more and more unpleasant. Time has made me reevaluate a lot of songs I irrationally hated when I was young, but this might be the only one that continues to shrink, and what's worse is the movie looks like it's going to slap so I'm going to inevitably both willingly and unwillingly expose myself to it over and over again. Go me.

**Poydoo** (0): This song really grosses me out. Ken's voice sounds super aggresive and the lyrics make me very uneasy and have a very rapey vibe to them. I get that this is a novelty song and isn't serious, but it still makes me super uncomfortable

**akanewasright** (10): This is just one of the most absolute mad lad songs ever made. I don't think anyone can ever match the unhinged energy of "do the Hellen Keller" if they tried, and I think that's a good thing.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song truly is the epitome of “you just *had* to be there”. The lyrics are insanely tasteless and trashy, misogynistic and frat bro douchey and yet it all comes across in this strangely endearing and engaging way that makes it an all time classic.

*submitted by /u/cremeebrulee* 

**cremeebrulee** (11): *i don’t support men’s rights, but sometimes i’ll support their wrongs*

#Vegetarians 

**Awkward\_King** (11): i can't write an 11 comment to properly encapsulate my love for this song so i just want to say i am 100% sure 3OH!3 have had a 3OH!3some before

**phonethephoenix** (11): sorry I love this song so much. this song taught me that it's okay to be sexist if your song goes hard enough

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Misogyny…you win this round.

**bluetriangles04** (10): that vegetarian line is still genuinely one of the best lyrics of our generation

**bogo** (10): the casual misogyny adds to the flavor

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): beethoven’s been dead ever since this came out. really makes u think

**DirtyRat583** (10): they ate on this idc (ignoring the helen keller 🕴️🕴️)

**dreamingpastel** (10): The way this song has been etched into my brain since I first heard it back in 2009. The lyrics are just so memorable, and I really like the synths in the outro.

**emayzee** (10): is this song actually a 10 or was i just a middle schooler in 2009

**flava** (10): just pure camp enjoyment, maybe straight men do deserve rights

**hikk** (10): I'M A VEGETARIAN AND I AIN'T FUCKIN SCARED OF HIM

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love the Chainsmokers

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/HiKYYtu.png

**jay** (10): girl okay

**jsonphile** (10): am I a terrible person for ranking this a ten? This song is absolutely stupid. Complete trash. Incredibly problematic. And yet, I kinda love this song. Nostalgia for sure plays a part, but also something about how obnoxiously stupid these boys are is just fantastic. So yes, I am giving a 10 to the song with the lyric “do the Hellen Keller and talk with your hips.” Please feel free to ban me from popheads I probably deserve it

**kwcty6888** (10): for the vegetarian line alone

**mysario** (10): do you ever think if Helen Keller had sex

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the vegetarian line goes hard i'm sorry

**shipperondeck** (10): peak trash pop i love and hate everything about this stupid ass song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i m a v e g e t a r i a n a n d i m n o t f u c k i n g s c a r e d o f h i m

**throwaway-7650** (10): do the helen keller is such an unhinged lyric like

**vayyiqra** (10): Growing up in the Myspace era, I heard this song and other scene trash in its prime, and it's unfortunately a banger. We have no wish to go back to this era of course, but this song ... didn't even age badly lyrically because it was always pretty douchy and gross, but it does still go off. (Sorry to the memory of Helen Keller, who was a very intelligent and accomplished woman. Did you know she was a political activist? Not all of her beliefs were good but overall she was fairly based for her time.) anyway I have learned that one of the members of 3OH!3 is now married with a kid so hopefully they did some learning and growing and so on.

**welcome2thejam** (10): This went hard at the high school religious retreat weekend

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): the vegetarian line lives rent free in my mind after all these years

**imbaby122** (9.2): for the record i know this is the most disgusting and sleazy song ever. but i simply choose to live in peace and ignore it!

**anothertown** (9): actually i think being a 15 year old scene kid wannabe in 2008 LA damaged me permanently

**camerinian** (9): the current cultural zeitgeist is favouring the thrill of art crafted vicariously through the lens of characters acting reckless and cancellable by the standards of modern polite society, so in that way 3OH!3 were trailblazers ahead of their time

**CrimsonROSET** (9): YOUR HONOR IT’S CAMP!

**kvothetyrion** (9): Just bottom of the barrel stuff, I absolutely love it. Every lyric here is the most embarrassing thing I’ve ever heard. Also Helen Keller is a scam.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i mean theres so many iconic lines in this song…how do i pick just one to quote?

**DaHumanTorch** (8.8): this is the peak of lyricism if you really think about it

**jman457** (8.6): A great bad song. Proves straight men can do camp.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): so many classic lines in here that are good and bad and make me turn off the misogyny detector in my brain

**JIRACHl** (8.5): Lyrical masterpiece and nobody can tell me otherwise.

**krusso1105** (8.5): There are going to be lots of nostalgia high scores here I can tell

**slimboyfriend** (8.2): Ms. Keller would be honored

**Frajer** (8): I was so tempted to zero this but you heard him threaten that dude

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): I can't make the music not bop

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): It may be considered "douchecore" but at least it's good douchecore (that hellen keller line was SO not it though)

**ricki** (8): and to think that they were 7 months pregnant with the chainsmokers here

**runaway3212** (8): W for vegetarians everywhere

**sarcasticsobs** (8): To be honest, I was very much expecting to be a curmudgeon about this since I hadn't heard it in like 5 years and I think nostalgia is a disease a lot of the time, but I had a lot fun with this

**TiltControls** (8): this is basically a time capsule in song form

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.7): the only song to ever make vegetarianism sound cool

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Wow I’ve…actually never listened to the explicit version of this song. Honestly, it seemed on brand for 3OH!3 to make a song that was absolutely filthy but also technically clean enough to play on Top 40 radio… or maybe I was just. The nice legs daisy dukes song outsold this one btw

**1998tweety** (7): the chorus bops but the rest is kinda tragic

**Ambrosia42** (7): kind of a camp classic, but also some questionable moments

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): for better or for worse, “shush girl, shut your lips, do the Helen Keller and talk with your hips” is such a stupid line that always seems to get a chuckle out of me

**frogaranaman** (7): something ab the album art screams misogyny

**nooodisaster** (7): That's where the vegetarian line comes from?!? wait- AND THE HELEN KELLER LINE!?!?! this song is so Jean-Ralphio coded

**oscarbrierley1** (7): this song kind of annoys me because it has a genuinely catchy chorus, but the verses are so terribly corny.

**pijus41** (7): these guys are really not into gardening huh

**Stryxen** (7): deliciously trashy. nadia oh was taking notes. The non chorus parts aren't as good tho. They're more trash (literal) than trashy experimental electosleaze

**Uberpigeon** (7): i think helen would have loved this

RandomHypnotica: #Carnivores

**vexastrae** (6.5): wow so inspiring of 3OH!3 to promote disability rights!

**moonagenightmares** (6): incel vibes

**Nagisoid** (6): I don't trust men with using misogynistic slurs kinda

**Roxieloxie** (6): The vegetarian line is iconic however I feel like its holding up the weight of the song so much. Like in the trashy misognystic aughts pop cinematic universe I feel like this one is kinda mid compared to the material. Like shake it - metro station is eating yall up

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Welp

**jasannn** (5): this can’t be serious, right??

**starla\_** (4.5): I liked this at the time cos I was an edgy teenager but god it aged poorly. Some points awarded for the iconic vegetarian and Helen Keller lines.

**pig-serpent** (4): Despite a nightcore version of this song being my ringtone, I don't care for this song much.  It's certainly less obnoxious than a lot of other 3OH!3 songs from the time, but I never feel like I need to listen past the first chorus, and I especially turn it off before Helen Keller.

**Poydoo** (4): This song just doesn't work for me. Maybe it's the guy's voice, or maybe the song is just bad? I honestly can't tell

**Raindrac** (4): As a vegetarian, I can confirm that the lyric "You tell your boyfriend (Boyfriend), if he says he’s got beef / That I’m a vegetarian and I ain’t fucking scared of him" is one of the best lyrics of the 2000s. Unfortunately, the chorus comes in immediately afterwards and drags down what could've been an otherwise great song with misogynistic lyrics. One good lyric and a decent hook are barely enough to compensate for that.

**bulforster** (3.6): still haven't listened to the new gecs bc I'm mad at them for trying to make these flops happen again

**jackisboredtoday** (3.2): the literal only reason this isn’t a 0 is “tell your boyfriend that if he’s got beef…”

**beeozan** (3): some points for the catchy hook but like cmon

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Fortunately I have no attachment to this

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): the katy perry collab was way better

**qazz23** (3): don't like the vocals or lyrics; i'll give it a "3"OH!"3"

**shadowtheweedhog** (2.5): I think less songs should be about Helen Keller sex moves but that's just like my opinion man

**apatel27** (2): 3OH!3 reminds me of the racist "emo" kids in high school and this encapsulates that loser dickhead energy perfectly

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (1): no

**babadork** (0): I hate this song and have always hated it.

**Catrick** (0): I never liked 3OH!3. I’ve always lumped them with other groups like LMFAO. You know, that trashy, dudebro mess. Songs like these remind me of this https://images.app.goo.gl/RGZKrwZ8wWxy4aWK7.

**impla77** (0): Not sure that’s how Helen Keller communicated

**ReallyCreative** (0): one of the worst songs ever conceived. As someone in middle and high school during this era, 3OH!3’s fans fell into two categories: the most homophobic pieces of shit imaginable and very kind “mom” friends with tragic taste in men

**akanewasright** (8): And with that, the first K-Pop song has been eliminated. I'm not especially surprised this is the lowest placing one of the bunch either - this is the most mid-tempo one of the bunch, and that style isn't always popheads' thing. I didn't quite "get" the song myself until I saw videos of [feminist protesters in Korea chanting the song as they face the police who came to crack down on them](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eBCBht6_C4E). It kind of highlights how just... perfect and universal the melody is. I don't speak Korean, and I typically don't look up translations of k-pop lyrics, but the idea of moving past what's come before and moving into a new age, a new world... that being used as a mantra for feminist progress and solidarity (it was again sung as a celebration when [abortion was decriminalized in South Korea](https://www.womennews.co.kr/news/articleView.html?idxno=188223)) is really something special.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): I really like how this song became a protest in South Korea, that’s really cool! Unfortunately it doesn’t really work too well for me, it’s *fine* but just a little bit safe and muted, and the sound is very very of it’s time.

*submitted by /u/dream_fighter2018* 

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): *okay so I submitted this because it’s a nice slice of Y2K bubblegum pop and I thought that that was IN these days. Anyway, this is a beautiful song and I memorised the choreo when I was like 14 so it’s stuck with me through the years. Girls Generation DID the thing!!!*

#[A Whole New World](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0eWUhXPhIaE)

**jasannn** (11): One reason why I love SM groups so much is that they always know how to harmonize during a chorus. This is one of the best examples as it exemplifies the optimism and unity of the song and the group

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): they were insane for this

**1998tweety** (10): they lived they served cunt and then they died [2]

**bigbigbee** (10): I would give this a song a 10 no matter what those lyrics meant. It invokes a powerful nostalgia in me of watching the 480p MV in my school library, absolutely entranced. However, I’d also like to note that it’s cool that this has become sort of a common protest song of sorts in Korea. (“I leave behind this world’s unending sadness” “Don’t wait for a miracle, there’s a long road in front of us” “It’s something we’ll do together to the end…into our new world”) Very cool!

**bluetriangles04** (10): What an insane debut song! More or less the debut song of the decade(s), as we've seen a billion renditions and covers of it ever since, alongside songs that are obviously inspired by it. But I never get tired of it.

**bulforster** (10): I've been really getting into SNSD's discography this past year and this is easily a top 5 title track of theirs and their debut album it's on is p underrated too I think.

**dreamingpastel** (10): Everyone rise for the South Korean national anthem

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the world shifted on August 5, 2007. the cultural, political and industrial implications of this debut is unmatched.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Gawd DAMN! The 1-2 punch of Rough and this…  Two amazing k-pop masterpieces one after the other… That’s good playlist placement right there.

**runaway3212** (10): Finally some real music

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I’m getting Tears for Fears - Head Over Heels

**sarcasticsobs** (10): [distant (unsarcastic) sobbing noises]

**Stryxen** (10): relisten. Relistened and It’s still that good

**throwaway-7650** (10): SNSD is the greatest gg of all time

**vexastrae** (10): iconic kpop debut!

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): i feel like this was supposed to be in the credits for an og Full Metal Alchemist episode block. anyways, the remaster is fantastic, and I genuinely like THIS style of kpop music video than some of the others we've seen. Huge lack of CGI or group dance numbers (outside the main shot), focused on these people playing with motorcycles or making graffiti or at the dress store or flying a prop plane or dancing in like...a staircase. there's something really hype about all these women and their characters all having huge Ws at the end that actually feel fucking attainable. good christ this is the most "attainable, healthy" kpop dream ditty i've ever heard.

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): https://i.imgur.com/NK6OWtI.png

**Ambrosia42** (9): now that’s herstory

**CrimsonROSET** (9): wait this was a lot of fun!

**JIRACHl** (9): Every kpop fan knows this song by heart and as they should. This changed the trajectory of kpop forever

**jsonphile** (9): never thought I’d hear a Kpop song sample Don Henley’s The Boys of Summer but it kinda works. (That is a sample right? It’s too close to not be)

**phonethephoenix** (9): another classic vibe! great pop tune

**starla\_** (9): a CLASSIC!!

**vayyiqra** (9): Never got into this group in their prime and wish I had. Sad! I even knew a guy who was a stan. They were right there.

**shadowtheweedhog** (8.2): i feel like i had a fever dream in the middle of this song what the fuck happened there

**bogo** (8): if this is what the new world sounds like i’m sold

**flava** (8): slightly less cute but still cutr

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Sometimes the most iconic songs are not the best songs, and that’s okay.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Anime opening ass instrumentals & melody (complimentary)

**imbaby122** (7.5): there’s a certain video game end credits song vibe radiating from this song.

**steelstepladder** (7.5): If this had a smidge faster tempo I would love it

**beeozan** (7): do the anime rate (idk if shinsekai yori is in the anime rate)

**jman457** (7): its cute

**kvothetyrion** (7): Yeah this is another cute K-Pop song, but so what. We’re all gonna die anyway. Thank god for LOONA.

**qazz23** (7): i like the multiple vocalists but feels a bit too polished

**TiltControls** (7): me jumping off that first cliff in breath of the wild without the paraglider yet

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Omg I love this music video, they all look so normal and… melanated

#[Into The Unknown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jp-CVYGEsjg)

**babadork** (6.5): Too long

**Poydoo** (6.5): I don't understand what she's saying but this bops hard

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): this feels EXTREMELY dated and it’s cute but there are just better songs in this rate

**Nagisoid** (6): Cheesy and formulaic but the turntablism break left no crumbs

**pig-serpent** (6): In a world filled with 80s throwbacks that don't sound like 80s songs, it's nice hearing something that sounds like "Head Over Heals" or "Boys of Summer" had a bastard Korean child.

**Adavman** (5): This was probably the most forgettable track on the list

**IIIHenryIII** (5): longer than it should be

**jay** (5): girl we lost interest years ago

**Raindrac** (5): This was alright on the first listen, but I didn't feel to desire to return to it until the very end of the rate when I had myself relisten to it. And the second time around, it just didn't hit at all. It went in through one ear and out the other. There are some interesting melodies in the chorus, and the subtle touch of a guitar is nice, but it just isn't doing much for me.

**ricki** (5): ive grown to appreciate and respect this song for what it helped build more so than for whatever enjoyment i get from it, the same way i respect pre-colonial artifacts

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): that intro wants to be head over heels by tears for fears soooo bad

**Uberpigeon** (4.5): an interesting glimpse into the past of kpop before they all decided to sound like edm songs from 2014

**apatel27** (4): god the vocals on this are rough

**nooodisaster** (0): Conjures imagery of k-pop Aladdin/a One Piece opener I'd always skip

**akanewasright** (9): I've played like 1 hour of this game ever, but I find this song just so goddamn endearing. It definitely feels video game-y, so I get why this couldn't make it *that* far, but this absolutely deserved better, both in its original rate and here.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): to be honest, this is the most perplexing of the VGV submissions to this rate for me. The instrumental gets repetitive quite quickly, and it’s very video game bleep bloopy, which was sure to turn off anyone not interested in video game music, but I was quickly shown how ride or die the fans of this song will be. Unfortunately, it ends up with the exact same placement and a slightly worse average than it’s original rate. Better luck next time!

submitted by /u/thisusernameisntlong 

**beeozan** (11): *They put their entire Katamari Damussy into this. Poor attempt at banner comment aside, I might be a little obsessed with the early 00s video game infused Shibuya-kei music (that's a string of words!) and the Katamari Damacy soundtrack is like the genre going full circle in the best way possible. I was waiting in queue in the hospital for an operation the other day and I started humming melodies from Katamari to calm myself down and it was surprisingly effective. I even tried to sing Lonely Rolling Star for the ratrick musical like I love this song (it turned out horrible but we move on) and it means a lot to me in the most nerdy, Great Fairy Fountain in Scott Pilgrim way possible.*

#We Love Katamari

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Every single rate there’s a song I give an 8.5 and then six months later it’s one of my favorite songs… yeah.

**shadowtheweedhog** (11): this song, the moment i saw it, i knew i had to participate because this hits hard. Its got the vibes, its got the vocalist its got everything including someone saying Lonely Rolling Star and calling you one, no flops found, perfection in music.

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**Ambrosia42** (10): absolutely exquisite

**apatel27** (10): sparks joy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Yeah this does a great job of capturing the feeling of when you’re rolling a magical, highly adhesive ball called a katamari around various locations, collecting increasingly larger objects, ranging from thumbtacks to human beings to mountains, until the ball has grown large enough to become a star.

**Catrick** (10): I’m so happy we get to rate this again!

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): genuinely sobbed while listening to this what is wrong w me

**jay** (10): girl you know we love a bleepbloop beat and we love U bleep bloop! Wait im actually so gagged cause why do i wanna 11 this....

**mysario** (10): invented hyperpop ballads

**Stryxen** (10): makes me go aww. One of my fav rate discoveries ever but i had forgotten about it! Thank u for reminding me i loved this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): honestly this song isnt even that good but im giving it a 10 anyway bc katamari demacy is such a comfort game to me and it deserves all the love i can give it

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): loveeee this soundtrack

**RandomHypnotica** (10): As one of the songs I commented in the vgv voting thread to not only make it into the rate, but also place really really well, I was a little disappointed when it didn’t get sent to All Stars (although both picks sent *were* very good). Persona is just such an iconic series, and this song in particular feels like such obvious popheads bait when you think “Video Game Vocals”, and yet it seems that outside of that context, it didn’t fare so well.

**akanewasright** (6): I'm gonna be real: this song has never done that much for me. It's fun, it's boppy, but I like this in concept a lot more than I do in execution, which makes this (and other Persona music I've heard) frustrating to me. ~~It's especially frustrating that this beat out the Katamari Damacy song that I really liked, but oh well~~

*submitted by /u/crimsonroset* 

**CrimsonROSET** (10): *Oh, Dance!. What am I gonna do with you? Today isn’t the day where I share my tragic backstory with JRPGs and the Persona series itself, but I could talk in length about this song but instead I’ll use only one word: fun! Both because I’m having fun listening to it, and because everything about this embodies it. Lotus Juice and Shihoko Hinata just absolutely soar in the groovy instrumentals and the lyrics of a bubblegum connection- just the feeling of sharing something with someone- is so infectious I don’t see how anyone could hate this, and I sure hope no one did! Haha.*

# Dancing ALL Night!

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**Awkward\_King** (10): for girls who were thongs to the arcade

**beeozan** (10): a rate winner in my heart (and i submitted another song from vgv)

**bogo** (10): persona songs are always good that’s like an unspoken rule of the universe, i think if they made a bad persona song the universe would collapse in on itself

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): now this is the kind of light zaniness that always warms my heart

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I wish real music could be as good as this.

**impla77** (10): slayage on another level

**jay** (10): girl okayy

**nooodisaster** (10): Genuinely such a good song that the video game rate helped me discover, and has been in my rotation ever since.

**phonethephoenix** (10): this is a bop

**pijus41** (10): oh to have a ensamble of friends, including an anthropomorphised bear, to travel into another realm and win dance battles with

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I’ve never played a Persona game in my life but god damn the music is bangin’!

**shadowtheweedhog** (10): kanji tatsumi best boy also the way it connects to Pursuing My True Self is REALLY good lotus juice & Shihoko Hirata can do no wrong

**TiltControls** (10): maybe this should've gone to all stars over the flop glados

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): i love the house keys here. video game music always fun

**welcome2thejam** (10): All future games should come out with spinoff dancing rhythm games on the off chance it creates the ultimate bop

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): Groovy

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://i.imgur.com/ShXQC4r.png

**OliviaGodrigo** (9): we should have rated a lot of more persona songs

**qazz23** (9): certainly lives up to its title

**shipperondeck** (9): now why is this a whole bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this isnt just a song, its a command. when you hear this song, you WILL dance

**vayyiqra** (9): ❗

**Ambrosia42** (8.9): i am jamming

**Adavman** (8.5): I should really get round playing to a Persona game some day

**anothertown** (8): its fine but im sure people are hearing lonely rolling star and thinking its fine so im going to do a good turn

**bigbigbee** (8): The video game vocals rate was so amazing - just an absolute celebration of a wonderful subculture and the music that’s long existed in this little niche. At the same time, I love that as games get more and more mainstream, more of them have songs written for them!

**bluetriangles04** (8): the only way I can think to describe that sound in the background that I'm thinking about while writing this is when you push your straw in and out of a plastic/styrofoam cup

**vexastrae** (8): who knew i would be shaking ass to a persona song

**jman457** (7.7): this felt like a fun 90’s throwback

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Ya kinda like jazz?

**imbaby122** (7): you heard the song! dance!

**kvothetyrion** (7): A lot going on here. I think I like it though.

**Nagisoid** (7): Lose yourself to-

**Stryxen** (7): Yass!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Looking cool joker (also I'm screaming at how all my VGV scores are worse the second time around 😬)

#[Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby Baby](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6jFaoLrLzd4) Ears

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): Desperately need to get into non-P5 Persona already

**Poydoo** (6.5): Heaven is still the best P4 song

**Raindrac** (6.5): Energetic and fun, though admittedly I don't care about it enough to replay it. I've never been interested in playing anything from the Persona series, but fortunately, this song doesn't require knowledge of the series to enjoy it.

**starla\_** (5.5): interesting

**Uberpigeon** (5.5): every time a video game does a disco song it sounds like this

**apatel27** (5): idgi

**runaway3212** (4): my uneasy truce with rona ending in this ugh you hate to see it

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): why's the guy kind of giving JYP

**IIIHenryIII** (2): too danceable for my taste

**moonagenightmares** (1): could never stand this type of music

**ReallyCreative** (1): Persona music comes in two forms: iconic and corny, cheesy music to get bullied to

**akanewasright** (10): Fergie is something of an oddity in pop music. I've seen it said before that her success with *The Dutchess* feels like she dominated through sheer force of will, with some incredibly brash singles and... we'll be generous and say "unpolished" performances. I like this song a lot in part because it shows a different, less unhinged side of Fergie, and she pulls it off as easily as she does "London Bridge". And of course, Ludacris is the best featured rapper... maybe ever? And his verse here is no exception. All in all, really fun song, such a shame it withered away in public memory and nothing brought it back...

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I knew that Jack Harlow would have done *some* damage to this song’s reputation, but it fears I underestimated how much. I thought this song was widely adored in the same vein as Fergalicious was, but I was proven very wrong. The instrumental does a lot of the work here, it feels luxurious and classy in all the right ways, and Fergie’s lyrics are so corny and on the nose, but in a really sweet and endearing way that just gets me.

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Turning the socialist part of my brain OFF for this bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): no one else could sing about Taco Bell like Fergie did

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/ajrbQn7.png

**jay** (10): girl the serve

**kvothetyrion** (10): If you ain’t got no money take your broke ass home!!!!!!!!! That bitch Fergie love to spell!!!

**pijus41** (10): if I had a penny for every hit Fergie song that included word spelling I'd have two pennies which isn't a lot, but it's weird, that it happened twice

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): I can practically recite Luda’s verse off the top of my head haha. It’s that good.

**runaway3212** (10): I cant believe fergie invented shoe fetishes

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): gta V monster that melted straight kids. I have compared to nothing more in life than watching people dance via "VCAST" on a circa 2007 verizon flip phone. tHAT's the glamorous lifestyle.

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): oh the memories

**anothertown** (9): hello new york we are taking the subway! we are… woo!! hey what's up so we're taking the subway, because, tropical storm hit new york, and we had to get from… columbus circle, to, cipriani wall street, in my full white suit, check it out. august getty. and uh, check it out. through the rain, we are going to the paley honors, and i'm gonna be the first one there so, here we go!!

**Frajer** (9): I still go to Taco Bell drive thru raw as hell makes Shakespeare look like  E.L. James

**impla77** (9): will i continue saying ‘spelling is fun’ as my comment for any song where spelling occurs? yes

**kwcty6888** (9): I remember being confused as a kid why she was singing about floss

**NotWith10000Men** (9): inb4 spelling is fun

**oscarbrierley1** (9): mid 2000s spelling song slay

**Poydoo** (9): I love the effortless vibe of this song, she sounds, well, glamorous

**ReallyCreative** (9): we love a spelling queen

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): guess I will be taking my broke ass home!

**memezaharamole** (8.5): always felt kinda bad for people with no money trying to enjoy this song

**phonethephoenix** (8.1): def iconic.

**bogo** (8): pineapple juice

**IIIHenryIII** (8): hey, kids! Spelling is FUN!

**Stryxen** (8): ludacris

**throwaway-7650** (8): the last time I went to taco bell they were out of nacho fries. I was fuming on the way back, haven't gone since

**vayyiqra** (8): Not going to lie I was fully expecting this to be dogshit given Fergie's output is uh mixed in quality but I really like the instrumental to this.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): 8 year old me was OBSESSED

**seanderlust** (7.5): IF YOU AIN'T GOT NO MONEY TAKE YOUR BROKE ASS HOME

**bulforster** (7.1): will never understand people who say this is better than fergalicious

**bigbigbee** (7): You know, I have a ton of nostalgia for this song but listening to it for this rate, I think that other tracks on The Dutchess are a lot more timeless. This is still good though.

**imbaby122** (7): there’s an undeniable 2006 charm to fergie.

**starla\_** (7): sometimes I just get the line "enough lettuce to support your shoe fetish" in my head

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.5): don't be fooled by the rocks that she's got

#O R O U S

**jman457** (6.4): Honestly my least favorite Dutchess single

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): why did this song have a moment in 2017

**jsonphile** (6): I completely forgot Ludacris was on here so that was a jump scare for me

**qazz23** (6): decent hook, one of her better singles

**shadowtheweedhog** (6): I have yet to determine if Ludacris improves or detracts from this song, the search continues. Also not related to my rating but I love Apl.de.Ap in the music video.

**apatel27** (5): This is a faceless R&B album filler

**jackisboredtoday** (3.8): Ludacris snapped as always, so he saves this from the 0, but this has always been one of my least favorite Fergie songs

**flava** (3): I mean, I can’t fully hate it cause Ludacris even if it’s hardly his best. But this song makes no sense. It’s her Jenny From the Block song, but then Fergie just has this moment where her dad just starts yelling to child fergie “if you ain’t got no money take your broke ass home” like that’s supposed to be some life changing advice instead of infusing classist beliefs in Fergie at a young age and just an overall shitty thing to say to a child. Like when TLC made the song No Scrub, they made it directed at Fergie’s dad

**Roxieloxie** (3): i cant 0 luda but just know,,,

**beeozan** (2): the song manages to ruin a Luda verse I didn't know that was possible

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): I grew up poor so the opening lines made me cry when I was 8

#SHUT THE HELL UP ABOUT JACK HARLOW

**Awkward\_King** (10): jack harlow you did nothing wrong my meow meow

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Remember Jack Harlow. also: https://youtu.be/L6TuMhYg89E?t=103

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Jack Harlow is a war criminal but he deserves a medal for giving Fergie a redemption arc

**nooodisaster** (10): Easiest 10. If anyone votes low bc of First Class sampling this, I'll find u.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): and jack harlow?

**TiltControls** (10): jack harlow must pay for his crimes part 2

**JIRACHl** (9): Jack Harlow your damage will never be forgiven

**CrimsonROSET** (8): jack harlowe war criminal

**hikk** (8): jack floplow. flop harlow

**lexiareder** (8): Don't let Jack Harlow make you forget that this is a good song


**Raindrac** (8): Out of all the poorly aged lyrics in this song, "The flossy, flossy" aged the worst. I can't help but think of a Fortnite kid flossing, and that's absolutely NOT glamorous. But lyrics aside, Glamorous nails its aesthetic thanks to the polished production and strings. It's a shame that the song doesn't reach its full potential because of the clumsy lyrics, much like First Class by Jack Harlow. 



 And speaking of First Class, that song does make me yearn for a piano to be added to Glamorous. The subtle touch of a piano in First Class makes his rendition sound just as luxurious. I'm torn on whether Glamorous or First Class sound more luxurious; Glamorous has polished production and a string section; First Class has modern production and a piano, and both songs have lyrics that are awkward as hell.
 
 **ricki** (8): god, when i say i wanted a fergie renaissance i didn’t want it come in sample form in a jack harlow song
 
 **Verboten\_Prince** (8): I'm in the camp of "I never realized how much I loved this song until Jack Harlow ruined it"
 
 **camerinian** (7.5): not me involuntarily thinking "uh huh" after the A-M god get out of my head whiteboy
 
 **vexastrae** (7.5): jack harlow you will not see the light of day
 
 **static\_int\_husp** (6): That one white man sampling this kinda ruined this song

**welcome2thejam** (6): I don't blame Jack Harlow, it's a helluva hook

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): jack harlow you are not seeing the pearly gates

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (4): dare i say jack harlow outsold…

**sarcasticsobs** (4): I've never liked her enunciation but I don't think she deserved having Jack Harlow sampling this

**Nagisoid** (3): Blame the "Dua Lipa" crooner on ruining this song for me

**frogaranaman** (0): men (Jack Harlow) ruin everything

**pig-serpent** (0): Oh right, Jack Harlow didn't make this song boring, it was always that way.

**akanewasright** (10): I don't know what I can say about this song that doesn't sound like a deluded stan raving. *Blackout* is one of my favorite albums ever (I wrote about it [for it's fifteenth anniversary lol](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ydr8ct/britney_spears_album_blackout_turns_15/)). I'll basically defend any song on the standard edition to the death, and this filthy, distorted duet is no exception. The production is sick as hell, and Britney brings out every seductive tactic she can in the verses.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): of all the blackout songs to choose, this was admittedly a surprising selection, but I can understand it’s appeal to some. For me it’s just fine, catchy but also one of the songs that always slipped my mind when I thought about the tracklist of the rate.

**beeozan** (10): growing up is realizing that the man is good baaaaaby baby babyyyyy

**bogo** (10): love the way danja’s voice is kinda manipulated when he sings “BAAAAAAAAAAABY BABY BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAABY”

**bulforster** (10): the crown jewel of blackout

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): classique

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): Britney fought for our rights to be slutty and WON

**hikk** (10): obv i'm giving this a 10 anyways but we kinda wanted break the ice

**impla77** (10): This is for Jules!

**jay** (10): girl the serve

**JIRACHl** (10): Give me a pole and I would devour this track I'm so serious

**nooodisaster** (10): Danja was insane for this.

**plastichaxan** (10): Blackout pop bible yup

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): half of Sidney Bristows plans in Alias started like this

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): that's right britney

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): girl [danja] shut the hell up omg

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.3): Blackout is one of the best albums of all time, I won't argue about this, and this is one of the many reasons why. This would rank really high for me on a ranking of all of Britney's songs.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Me to myself when I’m about to take a shower.

**bluetriangles04** (9): I wonder what this song is about 🤔

**indie\_fan\_** (9): kinda hated this first time listening to it but it's grown on me quite a lot

**Nagisoid** (9): Britney really said that Crazy = Genius

**ReallyCreative** (9): Britney always had our best interests in mind

**Stryxen** (9): forgotten trashpop pioneers (aka blackout's thot daughters) rate nadia oh v heidi montag v kaci battaglia is coming in 2027

**vexastrae** (9): i appreciate your resourcefulness but maybe nows not the time macgyver

**imbaby122** (8.7): the bpm of this song (and most of blackout tbh) makes it perfect for strutting across campus and pretending that everyone wants you. let girls have hobbies!!!

**Adavman** (8.5): Was surprised by how much I liked this

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this random man ate her up im sorry

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): perfect title for an explicit Scooby Doo fanfiction

**Raindrac** (8.4): I can't believe that I used to call Get Naked one of Britney Spears' worst songs back in 2016; unfortunately, I even considered giving it a 0 during the Mid 2000s Dance-Pop Comebacks rate! But in hindsight, I just wasn't ready for Danja's vocals yet. Nowadays, I don't mind them. They sound fine, and more importantly, this is one of the most hot and sultry songs of Britney's discography. Get Naked sounds like getting down and dirty in the back room of a nightclub and is at the heart of what makes Blackout such a great album.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): need to actually listen to blackout already

**1998tweety** (8): the man kinda brings this down

**anothertown** (8): buaaaaeeeybe baaayyeebbbeaaaa

**DirtyRat583** (8): circus > blackout im sorry i have to speak the truth

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This song is like 75% Danja and 25% Britney. Still a bop though!

**ricki** (8): i almost sent piece of me

**vayyiqra** (8): I never quite got the hype over *Blackout* but yeah sure it's good, even if it is a little goofy how it almost-but-not-quite interpolates "The Streets of Cairo" at one point, which is a trope in pop songs I always find very funny.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): this is fantastic and its not even in my top tier of Blackout tracks (it might be the most experimental song on the album though)

**babadork** (7.6): I’m torn. Good for Danja for getting that Disney money, but he’s also been doing a lot of work with Chris Brown.

**kvothetyrion** (7.5): Britney I can’t hear you!!!! Speak louder!!!! The beat here is so damn cool, I just wish I could actually hear the words. I did hear when she said “get naked” though.

**starla\_** (7.5): goes on a bit too long, but Britney and Danja were really unstoppable in this era

**phonethephoenix** (7.4): the production on this album really is so great.

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): tiktok ass title

**camerinian** (7): it's boppy but is there a reason half of the song is just performed by some dude

**jdmun148** (7): Not of the best of this era but decent

#🤨

**bigbigbee** (6.5): moment of appreciation for the cheesy moment in movies and television shows when a character says “I have a plan….” and it zooms in on their face and cuts to a new scene, and you know that shenanigans are about to happen

**jman457** (6.3): I should do a deep dive in Blackout but this feels like a Pussycat dolls/Timberland rip-off.

**flava** (6): why does Britney want to “Get Nicki”, but I’m glad she got her for that remix of Til the World Ends

**IIIHenryIII** (6): one of her weakest songs ever

**ImADudeDuh** (6): https://i.imgur.com/I5d97Td.png

**qazz23** (6): good beats but not really a fan of the vocal

**seanderlust** (6): no patrick, let's save that for when we're selling real estate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Eww those voice sounds are so gross you are not Timbaland

**pijus41** (5): just doesn't hit as hard as the other songs on Blackout

**apatel27** (4): Very middle of the road 00s club filler

**CrimsonROSET** (4): julestie don’t look

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): why does timbaland sing like that

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): why is this song almost five minutes long

**pig-serpent** (3): They got so hung up on whether or not they could they forgot to ask if they should.

**welcome2thejam** (3): Comedy perverts in screwball action comedies:

**TiltControls** (2): this sounds like the tagline for some terrible forgotten 80's movie

**frogaranaman** (1): now what is this

**steelstepladder** (0): Kinda have to be honest with myself here and say I think this aged very badly. Those "eyyy ahhhs" built into the beat are just really not for me making this the only song in the rate I didn't really didn't enjoy listening to...

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): of all the indieheads exchange songs to be sent here, this one makes the most sense to me. It’s very indie, yes, but it’s also very gay, and very very catchy. It’s 6 minute runtime just flys by, and that simple guitar riff gets embedded into your skull quickly. Unfortunately, it just barely misses Day 2 after doing so well for so long. At least nobody can take away the rate it won on indieheads.

**akanewasright** (8): ...man. I don't know what I can say about this song that hasn't already been said, but this is such a perfect coming of age song. I really do love that it's just awkward and drunk and horny and gay as hell, it really rings true to me. This was always going to be a little bit doomed because well... "coming of age movie soundtrack" isn't usually popheads' preferred genre, and Will Toledo's voice is always gonna be a bit divisive among pop fans, but this is something really special.

*submitted by /u/welcome2thejam* 

**welcome2thejam** (11): *This is sheer, genuine, unbridled joy. Haven't heard a song yet that better portrays that nervous, sweaty energy of trying to talk yourself to put yourself out there for someone, and then the rush of saying "hell with it" and diving right in. Wonderfully builds and builds and, sure enough like Will promises, rewards you with an explosive, cathartic chorus that bursts to life. The perfect needledrop for the romcom playing in your head. And personally, I'm not that young anymore, and I sure as hell was never all that thin, but for six minutes of bliss, I'm not worried about anything but moving this body and dancing all of the dances right now. My second favorite song of all time! I just love this song so much and I am already mentally steeling myself for it to be nuked from orbit*

#Gay Rights

**Adavman** (11): My favourite song of the rate. I enjoy listening to this so much and despite this being easily the longest track in the rate it never once feels like its overstaying its welcome.

**apatel27** (11): It contains self referential indie humour but idk I have a soft spot for Will Toledo and the song is an absolute banger

**bookthieving** (11): reparations for iip

**jman457** (11): One of my all time fav discoveries in a rate. It perfectly encapsulates Car seat headrest.

**pig-serpent** (11): Car Seat Headrest has long been a band I felt I should love, but could never fully get into their work, but they just clicked for me and now I appreciate how amazing this song is.  Everything about the rhythm and constant build up of guitars is invigorating.  Absolute tail waggy music.

**Poydoo** (11): god damn I need a hug

**thedoctordances1940** (11): yeah fuck it this is one of the best songs ever made i'd be lying to myself if I didn't 11 it

**Awkward\_King** (10): if car seat headrest were able to reach this level of slay more often they'd be the best band in the world

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This has way too much going against it to make it very far at all, but Will Toledo can rest easy knowing that in my subjectively objectively correct opinion, it’s a megabop.

**bogo** (10): consider this reparations for what i did to them in IIP

**bulforster** (10): "go crusty white men go" - useless-sheep, Indieheads Exchange Reveal Day 2

**camerinian** (10): **Lucille Bluth voice:** oh, hello Popheads. Here's a chorus. No. I'm withholding it.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this was the only indieheads exchange song we needed in this rate

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): he’s so desperate!!! I love him!!!

**hunnybee12** (10): classic classic

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is long but I wish it was longer

**kvothetyrion** (10): I’m very here-or-there when it comes to William Headrest, but man, if this isn’t a perfect little ditty I don’t know what is. I almost always hate songs that try to be nostalgic and cutesy (if I ever to hear that fuckin’ “take me to your best friend’s house” piece of shit song ever again I will have a PTSD-induced mental breakdown), but this song just bursts through my critical front line with sheer melodic power. I’m always a fan of prolonging the chorus for as long as possible (see: Tiny Dancer) - it may be a cheesy line, but he’s right, it makes it more impactful. And other than the “these are my friends, don’t we have so much fun” lyrics, I find the songwriting really moving. Killer shit Toledo.

**Nagisoid** (10): CSH's bodies are certainly falling apart after getting tanked both in this rate (possibly) and IIP

**slimboyfriend** (10): thank u to whatever angsty twink picked this song because it would’ve been my redemption pick too lol

**Stryxen** (10): gay 😭

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): is it the rate winner yet? no, its just the building of the reveal. so when the winner does come, it’ll be more rewarding

**TiltControls** (10): furry rights

**Uberpigeon** (10): hes right because my body is falling apart right now

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): oh goddamnit its side B opener of my twin fantasy (face to face) tape, bodys. i love love the riff and the absolute "im at the top of the world and center of the show!" build. the chorus line is so fucking stupid that's reddit humor, but god man when he gets to the chorus its euphoric. this is will's dipshit flow state and i have to commend it. the entire chorus' conceit...which is basically just the fucking do you realize bit from TFL...stings in light of Will's long covid diagnosis. like fuck man :/

**emayzee** (9.5): ok the 7 minute runtime scared me but this is actually great

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this is Dancing Crazy for indieheads

**phonethephoenix** (9.3): I don't listen to car seat headrest very often but when I do it's like huh oh yes!!!

**frogaranaman** (9): furries won

**indie\_fan\_** (9): I recently finished the introspective indie pop rate on indieheads with CSH's 2014 album which was a less than pleasant experience (only with their album tho). So I'm glad this is in to cleanse my mind of that.

**jasannn** (9): ngl the indie exchanged rate opened my music tastes quite a bit. I need a sequel!!

**ReallyCreative** (9): I refuse to get sucked into the discourse of this band, I don’t know anything and it’s staying that way.

**starla\_** (9): LCD Soundsystem for younger millennials

**throwaway-7650** (9): if this was by paramore y'all would eat it up tbh

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): You know what i dont support indie rights but and i hated that this one is like 20 minutes and so i was going to see what i gave it in the exchange and just give it that but its kinda great background music. Like i dont know what the hell he said but i think it works in the context that I hear it and i think of a coming of age movie and this being on in the background durring a party scene and I kinda dont hate it and so i will reluctantly give it better

**1998tweety** (8): Megan's body >>

**bluetriangles04** (8): was instantly turned off by it being nearly 7 minutes, but those 6 and a half minutes were a journey, an experience that even my pea-sized attention span really enjoyed

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the genius annotation for this sends for no reason. ‘Will is in some social setting with a lot of dancing. It seems like he flips back and forth between being uncomfortable/critical of the dancing, and having a great time.’

**moonagenightmares** (8): the first 10 times i listened to this song i thought he was saying im gonna need an obasis at the end which i assumed was some type of instrument and i only just realized that was wrong

**Frajer** (7.5): when you order The Strokes and Pavement on Shein

**ignitethephoenix** (7.1): it’s fine? I wish the singer didn’t sound like his voice was going to crack any second, but like the production is good and it a solid song that is a bit long.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I tried to listen to Car Seat Headrest because I read Crow Cillers, which is by the girl who inspired this album… the music is not for me. But I appreciate that we’re finally rating a furry song.

**mysario** (7): why does he ask if it's the chorus yet? girl, YOU wrote the song, YOU tell us!

**shadowtheweedhog** (7): This song really hits right. I love the vocals in it and I love the chorus. I have no idea what's being said but girl, I am living!

**shipperondeck** (7): the metacommentary in this song is always entertaining

RandomHypnotica: #How can i be homophobic, I'm on popheads

**bigbigbee** (6.5): this dude doesn’t look like his voice

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): https://i.imgur.com/W9J52HG.png

**imbaby122** (6.5): immediately deleted this scrobble from my last.fm to preserve the sanctity of my spotify statistics and my reputation as the normal type of virgin. but i actually kind of like the song.

**Raindrac** (6.5): Perhaps I'll look back at this score in regret after a couple of years. For now though, I'm sorry to say... it just hasn't clicked yet. It's partly because I just don't relate to the song's lyrics. I appreciate the fourth-wall break after the first verse though, it's charming. 



 But just as important as not finding the song relatable is that listening to this song causes me to disassociate, hindering my experience of it. I experience that effect while listening to many forms of indie rock and emo rock, along with certain forms of punk, and I've honestly got no clue why it occurs. My best guess is that it occurs because music of those genres has a tendency to sound raw and intimate, snapping myself back to reality in an uncomfortable manner and triggering a dissociative response. 



 I've got a long-term goal of suppressing that dissociative response so that I can begin enthusiastically diving into genres like indie rock, emo and punk; but at the moment, I'm just not capable of it yet and it's hindering my experience of Bodys. Sorry, Car Seat Headrest. It's not you; it's me.

**impla77** (6): I can just feel the pervading aura of smugness that prevents me from rating this any higher

**nooodisaster** (6): who gave u permission to play a man. let alone a GUITAR playing man. the lyrics, feel like to me, think they're clever, but aren't. it does pop off eventually tho.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Sorry gays

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): i was on board right up until the “meta,” “self aware” spoken bits brought this right back to a mediocre score… and then the length brought it down just a touch more

**Ambrosia42** (5.8): kinda very long and not my style, but not bad

**jay** (5): girl i wouldve scored this higher if it didnt last a lifetime fuck

**oscarbrierley1** (5): sounds like every boring rock song. hate that they admit they are just wasting time

**runaway3212** (5): shoutout to the IH exchange rate where I thought the song was called Car Seat Headrest for the longest time because indie songs dont have logical names

**vayyiqra** (5): Ah, it's our old friend, More Rate Discourse (I'm trying to come up with a pun here, it's not working, that's the best I can do). No thoughts on this one. Surely it will do well! :grinny: (wait what the hell was that ending)

**DaHumanTorch** (4): reaffirmed my decision to never listen to this artist

**qazz23** (4): don't like the vocals and its quite meandering; let the bodys hit the "4"

**beeozan** (3.5): have to give this a couple points extra because it's like Bohemian Rhapsody compared to the National song

**vexastrae** (3.5): normally im against longsongphobia but these indie men are the exception i fear ...

**NotWith10000Men** (3.4): it was great until they started singing

**pijus41** (3): listen to this song 3 times and Rachel Sennott will appear

**sarcasticsobs** (3): I will cop to liking the percussion, but STOP making me rate this band, I swear to god

**plastichaxan** (2.5): I slept

**anothertown** (0): man not this highchair boosterseat crap.
