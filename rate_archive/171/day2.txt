**RandomHypnotica** (10): the little bop that could! I really love that this highlight from the Worldvision rate was put in here and brought to a wider crowd, and to mostly positive results! It‚Äôs just a really infectious and gorgeous song, and I‚Äôm glad it didn‚Äôt fall back into Day 1 like it was looking like it would.

**akanewasright** (8): I don't have too much to say about this song, because I just hear it and smile. This was a really lovely submission and discovery, and I have to hand it to Darj for finding this in the pile of songs in the long-discarded (and barely canon) Worldvision rate

*submitted by /u/darjeelingdarkroast* 

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): *I submited this! Why? Well, I was stumped on what to submit. I had some well-known ideas, and then felt like checking out Worldvision, a rate that was before my rating time. This is the one song that stood out to me, I really love it! I didn‚Äôt even intentionally think of the ‚Äúredemption‚Äù or ‚Äúforgotten‚Äù angle too hard, though this song/rate certainly qualifies, so that‚Äôs cool. This song is so warm and hopeful with a great, laidback house feel to it. Samthing‚Äôs vocals are so lovely and inspiring, great fluttery vibrato. Love the subtle build-ups and then drops throughout. This whole album is wonderful. I‚Äôve gotten a bit more into the Afro house scene and really enjoyed myself!*

#Ngiyam‚Äôthanda 

**kappyko** (11): not forgiving certain circles for tagging sun-el musician amapiano when it's obvious that this is closer to the tradition of tropical house than anything else. obviously still great, mind - sun-el musician still one of the most consistent producers out there and this manages to suggest that love really can conquer all

**apatel27** (10): vibes

**beeozan** (10): favorite surprise discovery? african house music with some deep house flavor I need to check this out

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was definitely one of my favorite discoveries of this rate.

**bogo** (10): probably my favorite discovery in this rate

**ReallyCreative** (9): this is just good summer music like hot girls will understand

**vayyiqra** (9): *(Me being a dork)* Ah I wonder what language this is in ... I hear lateral fricatives ... name looks Bantu ... Zulu! Why, of course. [Unironic] Good pick!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): What if a song from Worldvision won omg

**thedoctordances1940** (8.9): the longer this goes on the better it becomes, like this could easily be a few minutes longer and i would not get tired of it

**NotWith10000Men** (8.8): this is so relaxing

**kvothetyrion** (8.5): I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever heard any music in isiZulu (I‚Äôve heard some stuff in isiXhosa, as I‚Äôve spent some time volunteering in SA), and man, this just feels so warm and alive! I feel like I miss out on so much great music out of Africa, really something I should explore more.

**Poydoo** (8.4): I don't understand what he's saying but this bops hard

**shadowtheweedhog** (8.4): it‚Äôs got a good beat and i like the vocalists here

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**bluetriangles04** (8): Another song from this rate going straight to my chill/napping playlist. Hopefully this doesn't create any weird fever dreams... But this is genuinely just really relaxing and good.

**camerinian** (8): I have literally no idea when we would have rated something, but shit it's just a lovely energy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): stuff like this is why I‚Äôm glad we did worldvision even if I drag it

**DirtyRat583** (8): kept subverting expectations (both good and bad)

**imbaby122** (7.5): me when synth ü§©

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): headed to my summer playlist

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): Nice lil laidback groove goin on here. I‚Äôm cool with it.

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): its cute

**pijus41** (6): a chill song, but nothing too special

**seanderlust** (6): it's nice and breezy but i don't have many thoughts on this other than that i fear

**jay** (5): girl okay

**IIIHenryIII** (4): too monotonous

**JIRACHl** (4): This went on for way too long

**nooodisaster** (3): Keep listening to this and then keep forgetting I listened to this

**akanewasright** (10): This song's fall from the top was PAINFUL to watch. Because yes, this was winning very early on, and then everything came crashing down and suddenly it barely made day 2. I *really* like this song a lot - I'm pretty sure it was the first Green Day song I ever heard, and I immediately fell in love with it. I nearly switched my 11 to this early on... but oh well, a rock song by a group of men making day 2/the top 20 is still admirable

**RandomHypnotica** (10): when this was right at the top after our first few ballots, I thought it was going to live up there. Then it dropped a few and I thought ‚Äúoh well, it‚Äôll climb back up soon enough!‚Äù and then it just‚Ä¶ never did. Choosing any one song from American Idiot to champion behind is a hard task, but this song makes sense, it‚Äôs got the melodrama any good emo song needs, without the sometimes excessive attitude (and slurs) other songs from the album have.

*submitted by /u/tiltcontrols* 

**TiltControls** (10): *this not getting into All Stars was the start of my (occasional) rate villainy*

#Walking on a Dream

**NotWith10000Men** (11): my shadow's the only one that walks beside me is so overdramatic but it also hits so

**anothertown** (10): in this assay i will describe how american idiot is the ultimate mcbling album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Men, what‚Äôs stopping you from writing classic emo songs about how you‚Äôre walking a lonely road the only one that you have ever known?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): cover one eye with your hair anthem

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): my dad loves this song. I‚Äôm not elaborating, he just used to have it on his ipad.

**flava** (10): a hate crime against emo music that this wasn‚Äôt sent to All Stars

**frogaranaman** (10): very specific brand of person comes to mind listening to this song

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I'm 14 and this is deep

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the way i walked through the halls to this in fifth grade dramatizing the worst times of my life‚Ä¶ yeah that‚Äôs history

**jay** (10): girl the classic

**jsonphile** (10): look I didn‚Äôt have an edgy middle school emo era. But this song still slaps hard

**just\_thonking** (10): Throwback to when I was like 8 and went to a rock band summer camp thing and my ""band"" performed boulevard of broken dreams. I was the keyboard player and also did the ah-aahs in the background.

**mysario** (10): stream Boulevard of Broken Songs

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): i love how people reference this song every september omg

**Poydoo** (10): Literally what can I say about this? An all time classic

**Roxieloxie** (10): pretending that we're also rating holiday since its attached to this one on streaming so i can feel better about giving this a 10

**starla\_** (10): why wasn't this submission Holiday/Boulevard of Broken Dreams like the ALBUM INTENDED

**Stryxen** (10): wonderwall

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): it pains me to not be able to 11 this, american idiot is my favorite album of all time and im SO mad i wasnt able to participate in the rate that originally had it. the fact that this isnt even in my top half from that album and its STILL this good just goes to show you how much of a once in a lifetime experience it is

**throwaway-7650** (10): mayhaps yetti's dad rock spilled

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this album deserves a rate win but let it be via Holiday

**vayyiqra** (10): Can't wait for this classic to be robbed! At least it got #2 when we rated it before.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): BI RIGHTS!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): classic!

**1998tweety** (9): memes aside, this is still great

**beeozan** (9): finally some proper rock music

**bigbigbee** (9): When I first saw this MV I was very young and had just seen the trailer for the horror movie House of Wax, which terrified me. For some reason, little me was very scared that this MV would ALSO become horror-coded (they‚Äôre walking through an abandoned area!) and that‚Äôs why this great song and that maybe not that good horror film are inextricably linked in my mind

**bluetriangles04** (9): I remember my sister burning this on so many CDs back in the day. I also remember not hearing it for a good 5 years and then my high school Spanish teacher playing it in class one day. I probably should have asked him if he was okay üò≠

**bogo** (9): 100% pure uncut slay

**Catrick** (9): the collapse of 2004

**hikk** (9): green day having nothing in this rate's all stars was crazy

**pig-serpent** (9): I was introduced to this song by it being a musical prayer for my religion class freshman year of high school, and it had a hold on me until I got my dad to order American Idiot and I realized that it's not even in the top half of the album.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Put your lighters up for this one boys!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Old enough to remember the mashup of this and Wonderwall getting actual radio play. What a more innocent time that was

**thedoctordances1940** (8.9): this blatantly rips of the melody of jane remover's shoegaze-ambient-alt-rock-all-time-classic royal blue walls. unfortunately though it is very good

**slimboyfriend** (8.6): it‚Äôs okay for gay people to like Green Day‚Ä¶ right?

**Frajer** (8.5): the American Idiot era was so overexposed for me I no longer recognize this as music  until he starts talking about his shadow

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): https://i.imgur.com/DQfxCIa.png

**jman457** (8.5): A good ‚Äúemo song‚Äù

**seanderlust** (8.5): big girl walking down the empty street, boulevard of broken dreams, all the dirty feet

**DirtyRat583** (8): that 1 single note that starts the song annoys me so much. youd think its an album version holdover but this is the greatest hits version WHY IS IT THERE. rest of it is good tho

**impla77** (8): actually holds up tbh

**phonethephoenix** (8): holds up for sure

**qazz23** (8): Has a very strong hook but kind of repetitive, good outro

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): throwback to middle school english class when we had to do a project on a song that describes us and i didnt want to seem like a fruitcake so i picked something straight passing which was this song and then made my teacher cry thinking i hated life

**vexastrae** (8): emo kids and fandom amvs were never the same after this i fear

**babadork** (7.8): This is only maybe the fourth best song on American Idiot.

**imbaby122** (7.7): any song that played on alternative or adult contemporary radio in the late 2000s automatically gets a point boost bc nostalgia.

**camerinian** (7.5): Hypno don't make Take A Walk the interlude challenge

**shadowtheweedhog** (7.3): 2nd verse goes SO HARD and that's where most of my score for this song comes from. Nooooot a big fan of the ending but we can let that one slide.

**Ambrosia42** (7): not really my scene but it‚Äôs pretty good

**pijus41** (7): would've given this a higher score if it was raining outside and I was having a dramatic main character moment

**runaway3212** (7): kinda the weakest single but still a classic

**sarcasticsobs** (7): 13-year old me might've 11'ed this but it has not stuck with me as I have grown. Anyways, rock on, Billie, bisexual eyeliner-wearing king

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (6.9): slapping the same score and comment from 2000s Modern Rock Number 1s: American Idiot is a better cut + september ends has "iraq war music video"; BoBD sounds like a tony hawk hellscape at least tho so its chill. solid 6.9 here.

RandomHypnotica: #Living in a Nightmare

**apatel27** (6): It's a good song, just don't really care for it

**Nagisoid** (6): You'll Never Walk Alone outsold

**nooodisaster** (5): So sorry, but the homophobic bully in my school LOVED Green Day so I can't separate my hate of him and them

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): They did American Idiot  at my college‚Ä¶ one of the worst theatre productions I‚Äôve ever seen. I‚Äôve got beef.

**kvothetyrion** (3): A song that has seemingly been written for the express purpose of being a template for Minecraft parodies.

**oscarbrierley1** (3): trauma from every straight white boy breaking out a guitar at a party to play this song and it being terrible evert time

**Raindrac** (3): I had listened to this song at home for the first time during this rate, expecting that it would be my first time in my life ever hearing it. But as soon as the verse kicked in, I realized that I heard this song before. It was a stunning throwback to my childhood of growing up in the early '00s and hearing this song on the radio. And frankly, that nostalgia overshadows everything else about my experience with this song. The rest doesn't even matter. That's all I care about. (HOST NOTE: They intended to give this an 8.3 but nobody noticed until now)

**shipperondeck** (3): i walk this lonely road and the rest of this song is boring

**DaHumanTorch** (0): i'll take john cage's silence over this any day

**Uberpigeon** (0): my dad always played this in the car and i dont like that

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): thank god RC stans someone who makes damn good music

**akanewasright** (9.5): MAN Gavin Turek is such a fun fucking performer. It's pretty well established at this point that u/ReallyCreative is basically the one reason that she's a presence on the sub at all, but GOD, what a good artist to use your payola on. The song is just impossibly groovy and fun, and her entire catalogue is that much of a joy on the ears. Nothing really changed from the last time this was rated - Gavin once again beat out a bunch of established favorites only to place in the mid teens with a 7.8ish (although it is a slightly higher 7.8 this time!) All in all, this song fucking rules, and I'm glad more raters got exposed to it!

*submitted by /u/ReallyCreative* 

**ReallyCreative** (11): *my favorite song of all time, there‚Äôs an infectious joy for music in this song that speaks directly to my soul, and while I‚Äôm not expecting this song to do well in such a stacked rate, I am excited for more people to hear it for the first time!*

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://i.imgur.com/qARozNQ.png

**kvothetyrion** (7): Pretty groovy, wish it developed a bit more though!

**Nagisoid** (7): I like the bass and vocals but the rest of the song is not that good of a look in variety

**oscarbrierley1** (7): the bass sounds kinda bad, but the rest of the song is great.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's okaaaaay

**anothertown** (6): gay hair salon core

**Awkward\_King** (6): my favourite RC anecdote is when gavin turek was doing her ama and a group of us in an offshoot server RC is also in offered to send questions he'd written, so essentially like 15 comments in that thread were all ghostwritten by rc for us because of how much he loved gavin

**camerinian** (6): I really do admire the determination from one user to perpetually keep this song alive. I still don't really care for it, but the fortitude is inspiring

**Raindrac** (6): Good Look For You is a good and groovy throwback song, but it's not at all memorable and I doubt that I'd have ever relistened to it had it not been for this rate. All of the fundamental elements of a good song are here and there isn't much left to criticize, but there's also nothing that I haven't heard before and no hook to draw me back. It's an excellent demonstration of how nailing the fundamentals isn't always enough to make a great song.

#ü§®

**babadork** (5.7): Take away that one annoying noise that it uses repeatedly, and I think I might really like this.

**Stryxen** (5): it's alright. Kinda relies on the bass which is fine but leaves the rest a bit underdeveloped and I'm not sure I even like the bass sound

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (5): one of our tightest "yeah sures!" of the rate. the top comment "Her voice brings instant happiness and smiles and That's a Good Look for everyone üòÄ" sums it up perfectly.

**beeozan** (4): maybe its my headphones but the bass sounds horrible and it ruins the song for me

**runaway3212** (4): hmm I wonder who submitted this

**IIIHenryIII** (2): I guess you mean ‚Äúgood luck‚Äù ‚Äòcuz that‚Äôs what you gonna need

**moonagenightmares** (1): the farting instrumental wasn't it

**akanewasright** (10): This was the first CHVRCHES song I ever heard, having been played in some Old Navy while I was in the changing room, and I was immediately invested. Lauren Mayberry's voice is so uniquely bright, and it fits this song PERFECTLY, helping to give the song's anger and bitterness feel even more emotional and compelling. This still might be my favorite CHVRCHES song, they just utterly nailed it here.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The fact that we didn‚Äôt have a single duplicate artist in this rate until the VERY LAST SUBMISSION AAARRRGGGHHH‚Ä¶ but I guess the chvrches hive are very passionate! I am more partial to Clearest Blue, but this song is still a certified banger.

*submitted by /u/flavasavavandal* 

**flava** (10): *I mean this is just a masterpiece through and through. The ice cold lyrics where Lauren Mayberry cuts down this guy with a calm anger that could seethe through solid objects. The line ‚Äúyou talk far too much, for someone so unkind‚Äù is a fucking masterpiece of a line.*


---

#:relieved:

**camerinian** (11): my second choice pick for this rate was Empty Threat, so let me just channel my relief at not oversaturating my own market into this 11

**just\_thonking** (11): It was either this or clearest blue and I have a feeling this one is gonna get totally robbed so I'm giving it the extra point

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending [2]

**beeozan** (10): one of their best songs ever like "and I know! I need! to feel! relief!" part is so catchy and the synthwork jumped out

**bigbigbee** (10): CHVRCHES got two songs in this rate because they‚Äôre an extremely hot and sexy band

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Whoever the two people are who jointslayed on their Chvrches submissions, you are loved, cherished, and appreciated.

**Frajer** (10): Lauren Mayberry my beloved

**hikk** (10): flava my chvrchstie we'll be getting top 2 yup

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I used to believe Every Open Eye was their magnum opus, but then Screen Violence happened

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/qofl9GJ.png

**jay** (10): girl gag

**jman457** (10): One of my favorite CHVRCHES song

**kvothetyrion** (10): Just a step below the other CHVRCHES song, but this one is also functionally perfect and certainly an 11 contender. The one aspect of this song that is stronger than Clearest Blue for me is Lauren‚Äôs vocals, which are a **bit** more powerful here. Also Lauren‚Ä¶ hello.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): : we will leave no trace of Chvrchesphobia

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Love how her accent really comes in when she says "man"

**Stryxen** (10): songs to awkwardly choreograph a music video to at 3am in the middle of summer while trying not to make too much noise

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): only real folks rate this song higher than clearest blue

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't know okay I love the first two Chvrches albums and they fall off hard after that, and there isn't much to analyze with them because their lyrics are fairly meaningless and their sound is rote synthpop, but they were really good at it.

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): have to show clearest blue is >>> somehow

**phonethephoenix** (9.7): CHVRCHES choruses are so interesting to me but I'm not sure why!! love this one though

**pig-serpent** (9.5): That little vocal flourish on "Build what I don't need," and "Nothing I am told" in the later verses are incredible.  I love when pop songs do that with the chorus melody; easy trick to make every song better.

**Poydoo** (9.5): eeh ih ih

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.2): excuse me while i vibrate into orbit

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): a vibe

**bogo** (9): these chvrches songs are making a strong case for me to listen to every open eye

**TiltControls** (9): a great song, but a little outsold now that clearest blue is also here

**welcome2thejam** (9): Love her voice on this one

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Without a Trace absolutely traumatized me as a kid, but as an adult I‚Äôve come to learn that all these crime shows are part of a broader copaganda movement, which is even more traumatizing!

**ricki** (8.5): oo ee ee oo ee oo ee ee

**apatel27** (8): It's good but lacking a bit of oomph

**bluetriangles04** (8): I'm as sane as I ever was which... is... not at all?

**imbaby122** (8): less good than the other chvrches song but still good!

**mysario** (8): this chorus is an absolute earworm

**Nagisoid** (8): Pique after eating the strawberry jam:

**Raindrac** (8): At first I was going to give this a low score. Although it has a memorable hook, it was never quite enough to compel me back to the song. I heard Leave A Trace twice back in 2016 and didn't listen to it again until 2023‚Äî and that was for this rate. 

But while wrapping up my last couple of comments during the rate's extension period, I re-read the lyrics of Leave A Trace to make sure that I wasn't overlooking anything good and found out that these lyrics are... surprisingly relatable to a conflict that I had recently with someone whose now my ex-friend. And here I am, about to submit my ballot within a couple of hours and listening to this song again. Quite the last-minute grower, eh?

**seanderlust** (8): chvrches said FUCK camping best practices!!!!

**shipperondeck** (7.9): this one is much better than the other one

**Adavman** (7): Its decent, although ultimately this track was overshadowed by the much better track from the same artist that comes right before it

**nooodisaster** (7): Didn't hit as hard as the other CHVRCHES. Always a huge risk to put 2 songs by the same artist in one of these grab bag rates, as usually people pick sides and split the vote.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): More synthpop‚Ä¶ yaaaay‚Ä¶

#Clean up after yourself

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ok this is the ‚Äòwhy does this indie band get two songs ‚Äò the naked and famous effect

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I like the melody of this one more, I like the verses and pre-chorus. Not too big on the brief chorus that deflates it for me.

**thedoctordances1940** (6): there's so much to like about this melodically but chvrches so often find a way to just annoy me

**Uberpigeon** (6): clearest poo

**vexastrae** (6): the better song out of the two chvrches songs

**Awkward\_King** (5): scotland

**qazz23** (5): decent hook but feels too polished

**runaway3212** (5): those pophead bitches are back at it again

**starla\_** (5): also annoying

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (2.5): this one is more competent but also still so fucking YA coded and sleepy. good christ you all gotta read queer theory and actually spend time with the Knife and Fever Ray. or just get into everything but the girl? good christ if a fucking synthpop cut isn't radio ready there's like a 5/7 chance you will not give it a chance.

**anothertown** (2): very dull

**akanewasright** (10): My co-host can suck it, this song rules. This was my 11 in the indieheads exchange, and I'm happy to see it perform the best out of the songs that were sent here. Elizabeth Fraser's incomprehensible yet magical delivery brings the best out of a gorgeous, dreamy soundscape. Just an absolutely brilliant slice of dream pop.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): i never thought I would have to see you again‚Ä¶ this song is literally just vibes and nothing more. Having your lyrics be completely unitelligble and then actively ensuring they are as difficult to find on the internet as possible is just pretentious and obnoxious. Instrumentally, the song just feels like a vague blur of guitars and synths that goes right in one ear and out the other. Anyway it did fairly well but now it‚Äôs out so that is that!

*submitted by /u/camerinian* 

**camerinian** (10): *the echochamber has no control over me. I am free. I am thriving. I am giving my cherished ratrick slots to songs that I think are Very Good and that make me feel good for being able to give them a 10 again. No other criteria matters. Complain about the mumbling all you want, it makes perfect sense to me here on my higher astral plane. Join me.*

#SIMANIMA FEEBA STREE

**Nagisoid** (11): Some sounds, many beautiful sounds can be heard here

**qazz23** (11): incredible vocals, mesmerizing chorus, love that slide üé∏ solo

**slimboyfriend** (11): Reading the lyrics while I listen and I still don‚Äôt know what this song is about but it makes me feel like a benevolent enchantress drinking chamomile tea as golden sunlight streams through my pondside cottage and the morning birds serenade me while I ponder the endless possibilities of a new day

**starla\_** (11): it's the smasha. How could it not be?? Iconically indecipherable lyrics as ever, the voice of God herself, absolute perfection

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): its just so damn good

**zekkyzach** (11): cmon lol

**anothertown** (10): this sounds just like having to walk the entire length of the vegas strip wearing sandals through seas of promoters handing out softcore porno because your stupid friend wants to go to the observation deck and then having to get in a cab right away because it was broken or too expensive or whatever, i don't remember. but you get to look at the lights on the way back

**beeozan** (10): immaculate vibes who did it like them

**bigbigbee** (10): FEEBAS TREEEEEEEEE

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): https://twitter.com/bjorkspears/status/1640045572953341956 This tweet really sums it up better than I ever could

**bogo** (10): they committed to being unintelligible so hard they threatened legal action against genius lyrics to keep people from figuring out what the fuck they were saying

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): a 10/10 song and this is like Cocteau Twin‚Äôs 14th best song. where Lorelei @ indieheads

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): trinityidontknowwhatsheissayingbutimliving.gif

**ignitethephoenix** (10): queens of making a Simlish bop!

**imbaby122** (10): sul sul elizabeth fraser! you are so brave for singing in your native language, you are positive representation for simlish speakers everywhere.

**jasannn** (10): I know they‚Äôre singing in english but my head still registers it as German.

**jay** (10): girl the anthem

**kvothetyrion** (10): I will always maintain my opinion that Heaven or Las Vegas (the album) is mid-tier Cocteau, but it does have two perfect songs in the opener and the title track. My (unpopular) complaint about the record is that it feels like wheel-spinning, pure dream pop that feels lacking; where Treasure had magnificent gothic influence and Blue Bell Knoll was **purposefully** lacking, Heaven or Las Vegas feels as if its missing the ‚Äúalso‚Äù that Cocteau Twins often have added to their music (and it makes many of the songs rather forgettable for me). All that being said, sometimes the pure dream pop is so good that it breaks through any and all criticisms I have, and this song is a prime example of that. Never my first choice of Cocteau album to listen to, but I will gladly go singing on a feebo stree and want to bomba bomba bomba bee with Liz any day of the week.

**phonethephoenix** (10): dreamy!

**Poydoo** (10): I don't understand what she's saying but this bops hard

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is a sunset on a summer evening with a couple of the closest friends you have and lots of really high quality edibles

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Did this need redemption? Maybe not! Anyway, famed Faye Wong collaborators, the Twins of Cocteau! Stream "Treasure" and "The Moon and the Melodies" by the latter and  "ÊµÆË∫Å (F√∫z√†o)" and "Âî±ÈÅä (Ch√†ngy√≥u)" from the former!

**seanderlust** (10): the fact that lyrics are unavailable for this song on genius is kind of hilarious...cocteau twins really said "you have to guess :)"

**Stryxen** (10): I know what the lyrics are but it's still way more fun to ZIMINAVAFEMBORSWEEEEEEEEE

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.5): This song makes me feel like I'm floating above the world and I will soon enter orbit and it will all be okay

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): kinda the blueprint

**1998tweety** (9): slayed

**Adavman** (9): Tried in vain to google the lyrics for this song. But even without them this track is still great

**flava** (9): fun fact there are more scottish songs in this rate than there are people in scotland

**Frajer** (9): Simlish queens

**frogaranaman** (9): whenever this song comes on I just make up the lyrics to it because chances are I‚Äôll get it right eventually

**impla77** (9): Fuck I was enjoying this before I saw what this was, so now I‚Äôm obligated to give it a good score

**just\_thonking** (9): Cherry Coloured Funk slightly outsold

**ricki** (9): kpop

**SinfulAnarchy** (9): minus one point for the simlish

**vayyiqra** (9): I listened to this album a few days ago and have tried a bunch of times to Get It but feel like I like the idea of Cocteau Twins more than the band themselves. This is still a good song, good hook, but I'd rather listen to artists influenced by them like Faye Wong than listen to the album again.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yp4kglsxkvc

**bulforster** (8.3): reminds me of this random new age-y trip hop / native american fusion cd my dad bought in a gas station once

**jman457** (8.3): Its very good, but not like my fav dream pop song.

**Raindrac** (8.1): Despite how much I've listened to Heaven or Las Vegas, I still can't quite say that I understand the appeal of it yet. It's a great song, sure, but I just don't understand why so many people call it one of the greatest songs of all-time. Elizabeth Fraser's vocals are beautiful and angelic, and the atmosphere is great, but it doesn't impact to the extent that a 10/10 would. It's not as emotionally impactful, entertaining or meaningful as my absolute favorite music to listen to. 

Hopefully, I'll understand it better one day, but for now I'm content with the experiences that I've had so far. It's still a great song. Maybe one day I'll finally find the masterpiece that lies beyond the haze.

**apatel27** (8): Yeah i don't the hate for this

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Suddenly everything makes sense now‚Ä¶ The moody guitars, the lovelorn lyrics, the reverbed-to-unintelligibility heavily accented vocals‚Ä¶ this is the ur popheads track

**vexastrae** (8): this is proto-szanese

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): ive got no clue what they're saying but this is really good and atmospheric. a lot of this music at that time had this "floating" vibe to it I guess...

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): https://i.imgur.com/MtrUr02.jpg

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): I don't understand ~~but I luv U~~

**indie\_fan\_** (7.1): abel doesn't sound like he usually does here

**Awkward\_King** (7): hahahahahhahahahahahahahah cock

**IIIHenryIII** (7): for a moment I thought this was a Roxette song

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I feel like this has recently grown off me a bit like it's definitely good but whenever i've thought of the song of late i feel like my instinct has been to think of it very ambivently. But I still feel like there's so much fantastic dreamy stuff going on here so I can't really explain why this has happened

**TiltControls** (7): good song, just a little outmatched next to the legends of the rate. Like lil mariko. Or 3OH!3

RandomHypnotica: #definitely not heaven...

**DaHumanTorch** (6): wait this is so overrated actually. still cute though

**pig-serpent** (6): I get the appeal of dream pop but it mostly doesn't do anything for me.  That buzzing guitar tone is insanely cool though, so I'll bump my score up a bit for that solo.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sorry i dont like hearing the sims sing

**babadork** (5): I alternate between loving and hating the Cocteau Twins. Right now, it‚Äôs more on the hate side.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): https://i.imgur.com/YiVa1dt.png

**nooodisaster** (5): When you can only understand half the time that they're speaking English, that's how you know Pitchfork is about to rate it an 8.3 BNM

**welcome2thejam** (5): They copyright struck Genius and took down the lyrics so that we'll never know what they're singing again

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (4.2): got real mixed feelings about seeing this here. there's a series of indiehead exchange rate cuts that showed up that suggest either a) you have a weird stockholm relationship with this rate or b) you found 3 bands here that you think you need to rate. gonna be blunt gang, this isn't the cocteau twins album to rate (treasure and head over heels much more fascinating) and this cut really doesn't need redemption (if Ivo Watts Russell is saying its the best album his era of 4AD ever put out and slot half the album on a CT greatest hits comp you already have enough). It is like the 15th best cocteau twins cut once you actually sit with all the EPs/comps/singles/albums, read the story, and realize just how insane this whole run was. At its core, this is a band about marrying the worst fucking drum machines to the most blissful guitars while Liz, who is a very private and protective person hurt by childhood traumas & early band reviews, sings lullabies you aren't supposed to recognize; an incredible encapsulation of abstraction finding pop and reinvigorating it in novel form. What HoLV signifies is that critical moment where after spending basically half a decade exploring and understanding their sound and sort of signing to Capitol for US distro (a crucial achievement that will come to cause pain on their 90s run), they buy a studio to perfectly dig into the pop spectrum of it (and Robin also get asked to produce Chapterhouse and Lush, sort of picking their successors). It's the most goddamn coked out Robin's guitar ever sounded, having gotten big into coke around recording of Blue Bell Knoll, finally sounding like the buzz of driving 200 mph on I-15 into Vegas. It's also the first time really since Garlands Liz is somewhat scrutable...if only because body hormones from a pregnancy has shifted her vocal capacity and thus started a move back towards lyrics you can almost make out (and Four Calendar Cafe makes good on in shockingly cathartic, raw detail). With that chorus alone, that's the Eureka moment, undeniably haunting and just tangible enough to understand standing on the precipice of a moment; a desire, an impulse, an urge from beyond language coming into a focus that's so bright it almost seeks to crash the stars down. I can remember being up at 6:04 am walking in an early dawn to it and crying...so glorious, such an impeccably paced piece of pop. i still am as I listen, but that doesn't mean in this rate I want to see it "redeemed" or whatever. we can move on. we can take las vegas.

**akanewasright** (10): Ah man... This was one of the first k-pop songs I ever fell in love with. I'd seen "stan LOONA" memes around a fair amount in 2018, so they were kind of the first k-pop group I ever like... *wanted* to check out. I really only clicked with this song immediately because I was confused about the subunits and solo songs (I saw the light eventually), but this song is SUCH a fun, cute, and high energy track, I found it completely irresistible. Evidently, that was not everyone's experience here, but this making the top 15 (and getting an 8+ average!) is a BIG win imo

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it‚Äôs insane to think how Loona went from such incredibly gorgeous and deliciously well-crafted bubblegum pop into the strange abrasive sound they ended up with before everything fell to pieces, but at least we‚Äôll always have their early works. It‚Äôs no wonder why the Loona stans had such a pervasive presence on the internet, listening to this song gives you energy equivalent to 15 cups of coffee on just a single listen!

**bulforster** (10): their best song, just pure serotonin

**CrimsonROSET** (10): hi

**DirtyRat583** (10): UuUuUuUuUwa! :3

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): love a song by an artist that I am boycotting but that I also know their music well enough to be able to sing this song in its entirety in my head.

**frogaranaman** (10): am I supposed to stan them or not anymore I feel like I‚Äôm being gaslit over if I‚Äôm supposed to be liking this DDR video game dopamine bitch with the cunty high note in the final chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): You know it‚Äôs been a long (five years since debut) day. I haven‚Äôt seen you (my paycheck) today. You‚Äôre somewhere (BBC‚Äôs basement), I‚Äôm sure.

**hikk** (10): EVERYONE SHUT UP OMFGGGGGGGG

**hunnybee12** (10): love does hurt like college entrance exams so true

**jay** (10): girl the legendary anthem

**kvothetyrion** (10): I‚Äôve heard my fair share of K-Pop songs, I‚Äôm no expert or anything, but I know my basics. This is quite clearly a top 3 K-Pop song that I‚Äôve heard (and the + + EP is one of the best projects I‚Äôve heard in the genre). Just infectious fun, impeccable production (those fast-paced synths on the chorus are fuckin‚Äô crazy), impossible not to dance to this.

**Nagisoid** (10): Blockberry's finances are going Lo Low after what they did to this excellent group

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): fly high angels üíî

**Roxieloxie** (10): i miss listening to loonas music so bad

**runaway3212** (10): I will never forgot my LOONA concert which happend on the day the queen died and during this somebody yelled for the entire venue to hear "THE QUEEN WENT HI HIGH"

**sarcasticsobs** (10): STAN LOONA (and NOT Blockberry Creative)

**Stryxen** (10): my friend randomly hates loona I'm fighting for my life defending them every time she brings up kpop (every time we hang out) (and we LIVE together)

**thedoctordances1940** (10): the aesthetic loona had up until and including their debut+repackage was perfect and the music complimented it all so well and god early loona is just so fantastic how can i boycott them when the music is just so good

**throwaway-7650** (10): we love you jaden jeong. ARTMS DEBUT COMING SOON

**vexastrae** (10): blockberry creative you will not see the light of day

**jasannn** (9.5): It‚Äôs not what I love(d) Loona for but it‚Äôs high energy keeps me coming back for more

**imbaby122** (9.2): if chuu didn‚Äôt leave loona we would have hi high pt. 2 (ft. ice spice)

**bluetriangles04** (9): I will be brave enough to say I didn't like this when it first released. I preferred favOriTe over it and didn't really understand the hype underneath this but I've since seen the light. This is great, even if I refuse to stream it without using a third party or various other suspicious means. Fuck you BBC.

**bogo** (9): fuck those dickheads at bbc for ruining what was a joyful girl group with awful management and legal scuffles

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9): i almost skipped due to the boycott but i realized spotify streams are barely worth anything

**ignitethephoenix** (9): energy drink song but good

**qazz23** (9): love the "high" energy of this

**shadowtheweedhog** (8.6): on youtube someone said this song smells like laundry detergent, candy gum or grass and that just tracks way too well. Good song. Really love the bridge near the end.

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): someone please let me know if we are still supposed to be boycotting them... i wanna listen to so what so bad but i'm being brave

**TiltControls** (8.5): This hopefully places high high high high

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (8.5): why is this psy-op back and being rated? did they perfecvt the industrial "girls hanging out and learning to save the world" aesthetic? i still don't get it but this video is better than that last one from charity. and that was still good. fuck man starting the rate with this PERFECTLY sets expectations for the brainworms and love people have had to get their song rated again

**flava** (8): stan Chuu

**IIIHenryIII** (8): fine, but you're not getting higher than this

**JIRACHl** (8): Chuu carried HARD

**jsonphile** (8): song‚Äôs solid, but why the hell do kpop groups have so many members??

**phonethephoenix** (8): has never been my favorite LOONA but is a solid song nonetheless!!

**Poydoo** (8): I don't understand what she's saying but this bops hard

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a good song and has a lot of energy but something has always bothered me about the end of the chorus ... I swear it doesn't resolve right when they sing the last line of the chorus and it drives me nuts. Otherwise a banger!

**Raindrac** (7.8): Is it just me or are the vocals a little too low in the mix during the chorus? It drains their energy when their vocals sound faded away. Regardless, Hi High is a really good song and it was my gateway into LOOŒ†Œî. I prefer favOriTe nowadays, but Hi High Is still pretty good.

**Adavman** (7.5): This song is fast

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I‚Äôm admittedly not well versed in Kpop but I was surprised to see this came out in 2018, of the kpop I know, this fits much more in line with stuff from the early 2010s, or even the Girls Generation song in this rate from 2007‚Ä¶

**starla\_** (7.5): this is pretty good

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): me when the meth addicted twink who stalks me sends me a text message

**shipperondeck** (7.4): this sounded more interesting in the first 15 seconds but it's still fun. anyone know the song freedom dive from cytus?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): I said for so long that ‚Äúone day I will put in the time to fully dive into Loona‚Äôs concept and get hooked the way their stans did‚Äù and now look where we are :/

**Catrick** (7): I just think of this mashup I‚Äôve received psychic damage from: https://youtu.be/Ge9pkC1RdMY

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://i.imgur.com/UQnPA36.png

**pijus41** (7): feels like a sugar rush. appropriate name

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): if i was haseul and got 0.7 seconds to sing on this song i would want bbc to burn too

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The shit they‚Äôve been through recently makes me wonder if we really *should* have stanned LOONA

**welcome2thejam** (7): Can't believe they went this far to break the boycott smdh

#High

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): A little bit too saccharine for my taste, but eh I still like it. Also obligatory ‚Äúfuck blockberry‚Äù comment.

**pig-serpent** (6): This sounds like it should be a Monogatari OP.

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): me greeting my friend who smokes a lot

**jman457** (5.3): this is kind of unremarkable tbh

**apatel27** (5): copy paste kinda song

**dreamingpastel** (5): Heejin jumping off the edge at the end of the music video is symbolic of Loona's tragic but inevitable decline as a group. More specifically, it's a metaphor for how their creative director, who created the entire Loonaverse storyline that was integral to their predebut success, left and‚Äî

**nooodisaster** (5): I've listened to this song like 20 times and feel nothing

**NotWith10000Men** (5): sounds like video game music

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): i love sickeningly sweet kpop more than any other style; but this feels like it was made in a lab that would it make it me-core but i‚Äôm not feeling it? kind of has the same beat and tempo as my beloved Love Bomb but here it feels way more overwhelming in a bad way

**beeozan** (3): idk why my brain cant handle loona but everything in this song feels so random to me in a not enjoyable way

**RandomHypnotica** (10): everything about this song is very stereotypical kpop vibes but it‚Äôs done to perfection so it absolutely kills

**akanewasright** (9): Oh GFriend... y'all will never get a break huh? The uber-talented sextet were robbed at GUNPOINT in their first rate, and only fully won over the popheads raters with their (excellent) disbandment song (rate winner MAGO never ceases to bring me joy). This song was one of their first smashes in Korea, and it's easy to hear why - while this doesn't have the pop feel of some of their later tunes, it's just so full of energy and joy. And that guitar solo! Man, GFriend deserved better... but outpacing half of the other Kpop songs in the rate is incredibly respectable, and I'm happy for them for that.

*submitted by /u/bulforster* 

**bulforster** (10): *I don't really have a sentimental reason for picking this song or anything ~~to avoid being too scarred by the results~~ I just think it's great and was done unbelievably dirty in its original rate so be nice to VIVIZ in 2022 kpop and as always WE MISS YOU GODFRIEND!*

#Roughians

**hunnybee12** (11): GFRIEND created all life on earth with this

**1998tweety** (10): they lived they served cunt and then they died

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Putting GFRIEND on the list of groups/artists I need to listen to that continues to expand into eternity. We need a like three year moratorium on new music so I can get this under control.

**bluetriangles04** (10): This song and Crossroads/Sunrise by GFRIEND just always hit me directly in the heart. The lyrics and emotional delivery are perfection for me. "We're like parallel lines," just breaks my heart in the best of ways, because the song is such a nostalgic reflection of young love and promising to be there for someone even through the rough.

**bookthieving** (10): "if i could run through time, i'll hold your hand in this cruel world"


**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): GODFRIEND REUNION MANIFESTATION!

**jay** (10): girl the collapse

**jsonphile** (10): holy shit why can‚Äôt all Kpop songs slap this hard?? The strings?? The drums?? The guitar solo???? This is everything I could ask for in a pop song

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): fly high angels üíî

**phonethephoenix** (10): this song has such a classic vibe! the guitar solo pushes it to a ten for me.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): if into the new world wasn't on this list this would have totally been my eleven also I miss gfriend

**ricki** (10): the first song i thought of submitting when i won a spot was ‚Äúme gustas tu‚Äù solely bc gfriend was disrespected in such a vicious way that first rate and mago winning was not enough compensation

**runaway3212** (10): GODFRIEND WE DIDNT DESERVE YOU

**sarcasticsobs** (10): My beloveds. Queens. Stars. Sirens. Etc. 11 contenda.

**seanderlust** (10): That GUITAR SOLO!!! I am levitating. this was my 11 runner up

**throwaway-7650** (10): GODFRIEND would never have shit stains as album art!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Shoutout Ratricks spot winners for sending the two kpop songs that were on my shortlist for the next indieheads charity rate

**shipperondeck** (9.8): fun

**jasannn** (9.5): you had to be there for there 2x speed dance cover

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.5): this just makes me feel so happy and lovely and wish everyone had a good day

**Stryxen** (9.5): god friend

**apatel27** (9): ty kpop rates for introducing gfriend to me

**camerinian** (9): oh bitch that guitar solo

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): WE MISS YOU GFRIEND

**dream\_fighter2018** (9): if this beats Girls Gen then that will be my Joker moment

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Not my favorite GFRIEND song but even a mid GFRIEND song is probably better than what most of the girlies are putting out

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this would work so well as an anime opening

**impla77** (9): this is so dramatic.. love

**pijus41** (9): that guitar solo was too short!!!

**Adavman** (8.5): My favourite of the K-pop tracks here

**flava** (8.5): cute

**starla\_** (8.5): this is so cheesy but great

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (8.1): need BFRIEND ya FEEL

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://i.imgur.com/Ir7IHt2.png

**Nagisoid** (8): NMIXX wishes they could do this (I don't know much about kpop, but my gut instinct tells me it fits)

**qazz23** (8): this has a very catchy chorus

**TiltControls** (8): how can a song called rough sound so damn clean

**vayyiqra** (8): we all should listen to more GFRIEND they're good

**vexastrae** (8): the chokehold the schoolboy/girl aesthetic had on kpop during the early to mid 2010s like .....

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): i don‚Äôt think i‚Äôve heard this in full yet but i have heard a lot of snippets of it from when i used to watch ‚Äúmy favorite kpop songs of all time‚Äù compilation videos on youtube before bed

**Raindrac** (7.8): Wow, this is a very pretty song. The synthesizers bring to mind imagery of a sunset and the subtle sound effects provide a nice touch, even rewarding relistens when I notice a new one. Oh, and a guitar solo during the bridge as well? That's sick. 

I'm also getting some high school vibes from this song as well, especially after reading the translated lyrics. If this were written in Japanese then it would make for the perfect anime opener.

**jman457** (7.6): I liked this

**bogo** (7.5): smooth

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): their anime ed song slay

#Prim & Proper

**Ambrosia42** (7): I haven‚Äôt really listened to them much, but this is decent

**anothertown** (7): kind of fun boss battle music tbh..

**babadork** (7): I had completely blocked out the teddy bear jump scare.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): that wasn‚Äôt rough at all wtf

**imbaby122** (7): in every rate i participate in one comment will be along the lines of ‚Äúbring *insert instrument* back!‚Äù like where did the instruments go?!?? anyways bring strings back.

**kvothetyrion** (7): Cute! Why is it called Rough, this is the opposite of rough. I like the strings and lil‚Äô guitar solo, but it also feels a bit too ‚Äúexactly like hundreds of other K-Pop songs.‚Äù

**Poydoo** (7): I don't understand what she's saying but this bops hard

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): rip

**Awkward\_King** (6): this doesnt really make any impact on me but everyone else loves it so im giving it the benefit of the doubt!!

**nooodisaster** (6): It's not bad but it didn't hit for me

**ReallyCreative** (6): I see the vision but ultimately I just don‚Äôt like it

**Uberpigeon** (6): they look 10 years old like girl go back to school and sing peppa pig

**akanewasright** (10): As the person who submitted this song, lemme just say... I waited until basically the last minute to send my song. To make myself feel better about doing that, as the host, I took a look at what had been sent so far and thought about what was missing from the rate. And... the biggest gap at that point was that there were no rap songs in the rate. Like the closest thing to a rap song we had was "Glamorous," which was so horribly cursed that I *had* to send a rap song. 24k, which ended up beating this out, ended up getting sent to the wheel and getting into the rate as well, but this getting sent was an act of desperation as much as it was labor of love. But it was an act of love - Bree Runway is one of my favorite up and coming pop performers of the new decade, and this song shows off everything that makes her special, from her electric charisma, her pop instincts, and her fierce as hell flow. She's just fucking brilliant, and we BETTER all be streaming "Be the One", her new song with Khalid.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song truly gets better every time I hear it, the music video is absolutely cracked and the beat goes SO HARD!! This was doing really really well for most of the rate, but towards the end it started dropping and eventually ended up here, which is a shame because this would‚Äôve made such an amazing winner

**starla\_** (9.5): outsold Tinashe

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): where's the album queen

**imbaby122** (9): ascending to heaven during the choruses and immediately falling back down to earth to shake ass during the verses.

**qazz23** (9): good contrast between the beats of the verse and the smooth chorus

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Did I think this was going to be Tinashe because I wasn't paying attention/can't read? Ya. Was this a fun surprise? Ya.

**Nagisoid** (7): HEY YOU YOU YOU I DON'T LIKE YOUR GIRLFRIEND NO WAY NO WAY

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i wish she wouldnt try to sing

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): i wont leave this comment for every song because Im keeping my thoughts to my song but the song choices in this rate feel like you're going your favorite ice cream store ever and your excited to get something but then you find out that they are sold out of everything except vanilia, like no topings at all just pure vanilla and its like 'oh' and like youll get it cause you came all this way to get ice cream but its kinda like you didnt drive all the way to just get vanilia and its not a bad flavor at all its just not what you wanted so you just kinda leave with no comment

#2OFF

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): one of my least favorite Bree songs tbh

**kvothetyrion** (5): The chorus here is really good, but I do not like the rapping at all. Oh well!

**1998tweety** (4): this is a mess

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): yeah this exists

**indie\_fan\_** (4): most of bree's music i've heard isn't really my style

**PrimaryCrusaders** (4): Tinashe‚Äôs ‚Äú2 On‚Äù > Bree Runway‚Äôs ‚Äú2ON‚Äù.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (3): little nokia SWEETIE‚Ä¶

**pig-serpent** (3): The hardcore isn't working for her, and while the hook is fine I don't think it's good enough to make the rest of the song worth listening to.

**akanewasright** (9): Ah yes, the start of Kylie's artistic agency arc. Kylie's two albums under indie label Deconstruction are absolute gems, and this song, the first single from 1994's *Kylie Minogue* was essentially the blueprint for later attempts to gain critical credibility by playing around with elements of trip-hop and downtempo (ie this song basically invented "Frozen" by Madonna 4 years before that song came out). It's a massive gem, and (imo) it's not even the best song on this album! I'd really recommend giving it a listen if you're into 90s pop music or want to hear Kylie sing a good ballad. But this song proved to be a bit divisive, with some finding it a bit boring while others couldn't get enough of it.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): If there is one thing I appreciate about Kylie‚Äôs career, it‚Äôs how varied her discography has been in terms of sounds and influences, and it truly feels like she‚Äôs not afraid to push the boundaries of what a pop star sounds like. Unfortunately, this song just falls in a bit of a flat spot for me, but it still managed a strong showing here!

**DaHumanTorch** (11): *not ashamed to 11 my own submission! one of the few songs i would without hesitation call perfection*

#Will take your secrets to the grave

**pijus41** (11): brilliant, excellent, magical, Kylie convinced me to put her as my emergency contact

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): As soon as I saw this in the songlist you just KNOW I had to give it the almighty 11. Probably one of the best songs Queen Kylie has ever recorded, full stop. (Though full disclosure: If you can, go for the Master Mix with the extended intro, that's my favourite version by far - it's the one used in the video.)

**1998tweety** (10): this deserved to smash

**Ambrosia42** (10): this song is so cunt

**apatel27** (10): imagine she stayed down this route and ended up an indie darling instead

**beeozan** (10): the drama of it all like Kylie what can't you do queen

**bogo** (10): if popheads robs this again as much as indieheads did when they rated it i‚Äôm burning the fucking sub down

**camerinian** (10): music to give out fuck me eyes across the wine bar to

**flava** (10): this is what Madonna thought she was doing with Frozen

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this is so different for kylie like woah.

**impla77** (10): TIL there is a French version of this since Apple Music was so desperate for me to listen to that instead!!

**jay** (10): girl we fainted

**jdmun148** (10): Potentially her best song, a classic

**jman457** (10): A big surprise from this rate, really unexpected

**moonagenightmares** (10): this song awakening memories from the bottom of my brain omfg

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): i don‚Äôt care if this is one of the 5 pop star songs that indie music snobs tolerate, this is her best song!!

**oscarbrierley1** (10): she slayed so hard, this song is so beautiful. the most james bond song to never be a james bond song.

**phonethephoenix** (10): cinematic and alluring!

**runaway3212** (10): no cause she didnt have to spill so much

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): if I had 11ed Traveling in EAPR, I would have 11ed this here with no hesitation :noitssad:

**sarcasticsobs** (10): James-Bond-theme-ass song (complimentary)

**Stryxen** (10): the random trip hop benchmark the 90s gays were gaggingggg

**throwaway-7650** (10): this kind of paved the way for poor fake...

**vayyiqra** (10): This is the most 90s thing I've ever heard (complimentary).

**DirtyRat583** (9.6): ethereal

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): https://i.imgur.com/t92NdcP.png

**JIRACHl** (9.5): The gp really failed her by letting this flop. This is a masterpiece from start to finish

**starla\_** (9.5): Kylie's 90s era is so good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I‚Äôm so insanely overdue for a Kylie Minogue deep dive it‚Äôs not even funny. It‚Äôs very serious actually.

**Frajer** (9): absolutely criminal that she was never a Bond girl/did a Bond theme

**Nagisoid** (9): It's scary how well this transitions from Poor Fake despite the list being in alphabetical order

**nooodisaster** (9): That wonderful era in the mid-90s when everyone was making artistic psychadelic pop w/ psuedo spiritual lyrics.

**qazz23** (9): love the strings and trip-hop feel

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Alanis if the pill was big and easy to swallow

**imbaby122** (8.5): the aussie rlly comes out in that spoken bridge huh

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): that's really spooky and pretty

**mysario** (7.8): if Evanescence made sultry pop music

**bluetriangles04** (7.5): I feel like this song would be playing during a compilation of the main character in a vampire film investigating supernatural creatures trying to pin down what strange creature is causing chaos in town

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I love how grand and lush this is but also I won‚Äôt return to it ever

**kvothetyrion** (7.5): Did not expect this! Sounds like it could be a James Bond theme. Cool concept, would have liked it to develop a bit more.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Man this is getting ripped off by being right after Poor Fake in the playlist because it's just registering to me as a worse Poor Fake.

**Raindrac** (7.5): "But sometimes to release it / Is to set our children free" is quite the poetic way to sing about cum! ...Okay. Snark aside, I could hear the talent involved behind Confide In Me on my first listen but it wasn't until the third listen that I actually began to understand the appeal of this song. It's excellent with headphones because of the lush and detailed production, and very sensual as well.

**vexastrae** (7.5): not me watching the music video for this and unironically touching my screen im .........

**ReallyCreative** (7.3): well it‚Äôs a Kylie song

**bigbigbee** (7): She was kind of in her dark anime opening bag here

**CrimsonROSET** (7): battle of the bonds girlies make some noise

**shadowtheweedhog** (7): this is one of my least favorite kylie track but it still gets a good score because Kylie can do no wrong to me like she could punch me in the face and i‚Äôd be fine with it i‚Äôd probably rate it highly

**TiltControls** (7): probably wouldve been higher if the rate wasnt so stacked

**welcome2thejam** (7): Typing "is this Trip Hop?" as my comment when this was literally in the indieheads Trip Hop Bonus Rate

#teatime thread regulars

**cremeebrulee** (6.1): trip hop is such a :kermit: genre to me

**anothertown** (6): there are probably people in here who are obsessed with this idk it isn't hitting.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I love a lot of Kylie but was underwhelmed with this. it‚Äôs a vibe but wish it had more progression

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I like the version on *The Abbey Road Sessions* but on the whole this has always been a lower tier Kylie song for me. I appreciate the versatility

**Uberpigeon** (6): stick or twist... what does that even mean girl

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (6): not touching the screen its dirty enough already. Somehow ended up in the indieheads trip hop rate, so seeing back over here caught me. it's sort of just an example of an artist paying attention to club music in that 90s moment when it almost crossed over. samplers abound! decent ditty with cool affects but it never feels downtempo enough nor does this whole set up really ever grab me; although the way PJ Harvey dabbles with this sound on Is This Desire hits

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): naur

**IIIHenryIII** (4): you should stick to club bangers

**yahi** (3): nothing

**Awkward\_King** (2): niki i am so sorry :sadyell:

**akanewasright** (10): With the rise of a certain kind of ~~soul suckingly funkless~~ disco rising in prominence on the charts, I've kind of had to go back and question what makes a good disco song, and what's missing from the stuff I don't like. One part of it is "a great groove or bass line," but also... sometimes a good disco song just needs to be bombastic and broad and a little campy. Catallena taps into that side of disco *perfectly*. The big strings, the silly hooks, the incorporation of Hi-NRG synths, it all just comes together perfectly. THIS is how you make a great 21st century disco song. This is probably my favorite of the k-pop songs that got sent (although I love them all), and I'm happy with this being the top placing one.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): They truly don‚Äôt make em like this anymore!! This song has such a strikingly unique and charming sound, visuals and overall aesthetic that it‚Äôs no wonder it‚Äôs become such a beloved classic! Unfortunately, this is the end of the road for it‚Äôs journey, perhaps by virtue of being a kpop song in a non kpop rate, a previously well-established struggle.

*submitted by /u/bigbigbee* 

**bigbigbee** (10): *This little rate (Kpop Retirement Home) was what brought me into the rating world, and this song was the first ever 11 I gave <3 Thank you so much u/bespectacIed and u/agentofscranton for doing an amazing job with an amazing rate! I think that this song + concept combo is k-pop at its absolute best and I weep for Orange Caramel‚Äôs demise every day. Booo Pledis boooooo tomato tomato*

**bookthieving** (10): music for a sushi restaurant

**bulforster** (10): the way the song on its own is already a 10 but then it also has an all timer of a music video and iconic(ally memable) live performances

**cremeebrulee** (10): they invented pan-asian solidarity with this one

**CrimsonROSET** (10): but when you do iconicity

**shipperondeck** (10): BROOOOOOO MY GOD THIS TOOK ME BACK. i had had a cousin who loved this song and i literally havent heard it since 2014ish. damn

**throwaway-7650** (10): tfw u get a 63 on a test but it should be a 64

**vayyiqra** (10): Orange Caramel are one of those 2nd gen K-pop groups with a weird name who made a ton of bangers, got a small cult following and were quickly forgotten, but hopefully Popheads will see how much this rules.

**welcome2thejam** (10): #ReleaseTheHah!Cut

**shadowtheweedhog** (8.5): sometimes you just vibe and this song is a song to just vibe to i was living

**dreamingpastel** (8.2): (does a little dance) HA!

**Nagisoid** (8): We need more Bollywood inspired disco songs to kick nu-disco's ass!

**pig-serpent** (8): These girls are shouting "Oi! Oi! Oi!" like they're in a hardcore punk band.

**phonethephoenix** (7.8): a fun song!!

**bogo** (7.5): ngl with the name of the group for some reason when this got revealed for the lineup i thought it was caramelldansen üíÄ

**TiltControls** (7.5): god i love that chorus

**camerinian** (7): I don't really think this is very aesthetically pleasant, but I'd be lying if it doesn't also show up rent free in my head way more frequently than I'd like to admit

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it's fun

**imbaby122** (7): u have to be a different type of gay to recognize the cultural moment that this song was.

**nooodisaster** (7): Popheads doesn't ask, they tell you, you WILL be a k-pop stan.

**Poydoo** (7): I don't understand what she's saying but this bops hard

**Raindrac** (7): That "oye hoi hoi" is so ridiculous that it should've made the song worse, but it doesn't. If anything, it just makes the song memorable and fun. Catallena isn't my favorite K-Pop song at this rate, but it's still pretty good.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): my preferred of the 2 chvrches songs in this rate, the build here is absolute euphoria and it‚Äôs easier to see why it‚Äôs fans would die for it. But contrastingly, if you are very whelmed by the drop the song has‚Ä¶ not much else going for it.

**akanewasright** (7.5): I'm gonna be honest - I didn't really "get" this song until the needle drop in *Heartstopper*. Like that show uses music so well, but if I had to pick out a top 3 moments of the show defined by the music, that and "Don't Delete The Kisses" would be in there. Suddenly I see the color and viscerally *feel* the euphoria from the song. It's still not my favorite CHVRCHES song, and I pettily wish "Leave A Trace" was doing better, but I get it.

*submitted by /u/hikkaru* 

**hikk** (10): *WHOEVER SENT THIS IS SO HOT AND SEXY u/wavingwolves DNI*

#Crystal Clear

**IIIHenryIII** (11): they invented buildups

**jdmun148** (11): Choosing between the two CHVRCHES is near impossible but this one just pip it for the 11

**kvothetyrion** (11): There are few genres that light up the pleasure centers of my brain like synthpop, and shit man, this might be the best synthpop song since, I don‚Äôt know, Enjoy the Silence? In a year when several of my favorite albums came out, this manages to stand above everything else as my favorite song of 2015 (on most days at least; sometimes I‚Äôm so floored by 90210 that I have to call it the best). Lauren Mayberry‚Äôs voice is just so perfect in combination with her lyrics and the synths, this perfect mix of hope and longing - I spoke in another comment about how I normally hate songs that are trying to forcibly cause nostalgia through their lyrics; Clearest Blue makes me feel the way those songs try to make me feel without bludgeoning me in the skull. The drop is just one of the most joyous moments in music for me, at once I am overwhelmed with emotion and the urge to dance, and few songs are able to do that to me with the extreme force as this one (the only other one I can think of is Visions, but that‚Äôs more related to my personal experiences with the song than the sheer power of the songwriting). Unbelievably perfect tune.

**nooodisaster** (11): One of the things I realized I love most about pophead rates is their ability to introduce me to new music. I mean, I recently I went to a concert of a musician I first head because of a rate. So I'm giving my 11 to this song, a song I'd never heard before this rate. I instantly fell with Clearest Blue on first listen, and I still am hitting repeat a month later. So even though y'all have NO TASTE, thank you popheads for, I guess, choosing a few bangers.

**TiltControls** (11): whoever sent this had the right idea

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**apatel27** (10): Every synthpop song since has failed to reach this level of perfection

**bigbigbee** (10): I dragged my music buddy coworker to a CHVRCHES concert last year (he was not familiar with them). He was extremely patient as I got extremely drunk and lost my mind to this song. This almost got my 11.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Whoever the two people are who jointslayed on their Chvrches submissions, you are loved, cherished, and appreciated.

**bogo** (10): this is for gay people what running up that hill was for the general public in 2022

**cremeebrulee** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037525072950341732/1092895366313152574/IMG_1683.png?width=1284&height=1300

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh the chorus build up is actually insane

**DirtyRat583** (10): hey this was in a tv show idk if you heard of it its called h-*dies*

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): the drop is like a serotonin release‚Ä¶ it's so good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/G91oGbH.png

**jay** (10): girl wow

**pig-serpent** (10): The CHVRCHES songs based around a massive build up of energy that lasts the entire song are always some of their best songs

**ReallyCreative** (10): oh this has winner energy I fear

**ricki** (10): frat party anthem

**runaway3212** (10): Heartstopper was a 10/10 too

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): more like Clearest Skin because this synth work just cured my breakouts

**sarcasticsobs** (10): No, like, you don't get it

**Stryxen** (10): danced too hard to this in the shower once I thought I'd go straight through the floor THAT is what Clearest Blue means to me

**throwaway-7650** (10): rly hope u/IIIHenryIII comes through w/ the 11

**vayyiqra** (10): Yeah the drop is good but also a little overrated but also it's catchy and it just makes you happy so who cares? It's a 10. You know, maybe it's not even overrated. I don't know. I don't care.

**welcome2thejam** (10): I just wanna live inside this song

**Ambrosia42** (9.3): they smash the slay button like two thirds of the way through

**phonethephoenix** (9.1): love this production<3

**Adavman** (9): This grew on me a lot. Takes a while to get going but once it does its great

**bluetriangles04** (9): i'm absolutely in love with this now,,, I still have yet to hear this album fully but these two inclusions really make me want to

**ignitethephoenix** (9): serious question when is the next season of Heartstopper coming out anyway

**imbaby122** (9): after learning that immaterial was originally supposed to be the song for the clearest blue scene in heartstopper, i thanked chvrches every day for inadvertently protecting sophie‚Äôs legacy from chronically online teenagers. and then lime lips happened. can‚Äôt win ‚Äòem all.

**seanderlust** (9): god the catharsis on the drop >>

**Frajer** (8.5): stream Just Can't Get Enough by Depeche Mode

**jasannn** (8.5): Heartstopper was a highlight of 2022 tbh.

**Awkward\_King** (8): what sza saw looking down from the sos album cover:

**camerinian** (8): overrated bop, but a bop nonetheless. The drop is iconic, just a shame the verses are so barren feeling

**frogaranaman** (8): this song is so good I wish churches were real

**jman457** (8): A solid synth pop song

**OliviaGodrigo** (8): their best song

**Poydoo** (8): It go beep boop

**Roxieloxie** (8): this song being here being the domino of my friend finally starting heartstoppers

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this song feels like this video https://youtu.be/XCawU6BE8P8

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I still don't know how to pronounce their name

**babadork** (7.9): I‚Äôm not much of a CHVRCHES fan, but this is my favorite of their songs.

**shadowtheweedhog** (7.6): I get a lot of really good vibes from this song, I love the beat to it and how ethereal the vocalist sounds. It kind of feels like I'm being taken under.

**beeozan** (7.5): they have better drops than this Depeche Mode ripoff, we needed Tether in the rate instead

**impla77** (7): unironically the black eyed peas did this first

**Nagisoid** (7): Is this the synthpop girlie version of Perfect Blue?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): You can easily tell the drop was supposed to interpolate ‚ÄúJust Can‚Äôt Get Enough‚Äù but I guess they couldn‚Äôt clear it so it became this weird one-note melody instead. This one is kinda dope.

RandomHypnotica: #a deep deep very deep dark muddy blue

**flava** (6.5): if this places higher than Leave a Trace then I‚Äôm burning popheads to the ground. It‚Äôs a fine song but incredibly overrated and Chvrches cannot do a drop to save their life

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Wait I just realized, were they patient zero for the ‚Äúreplacing vowels with letters‚Äù trend?

**qazz23** (6): second half is better but still feels generic

**Raindrac** (6): Clearest Blue was never a song that stood out to me. I listened to it once in 2016 and forgot about it entirely until I saw that it got submitted to this rate. It's not bad and it's a perfectly pleasant synthpop song, but I can't say that I feel a desire to relisten to it or check out the rest of Every Open Eye. And that just about sums up my experience with the music of CHVRCHES, seemingly flawless synthpop that lacks the special spark necessary to draw me back.

**Uberpigeon** (6): clearest poo

**starla\_** (5.5): Chvrches are either amazing or annoying, this lands more annoying

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): Chvrches are the most background music band I can think of

**shipperondeck** (5): sorry everyone this is the first time i've ever listened to a chvrches song i think

**vexastrae** (5): out of all the artists to have two songs in this rate it happened to be chvrches. we needed two britney and janet songs i fear

**thedoctordances1940** (4.1): i do not like what the synths are doing here

**anothertown** (3): very dull

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I don‚Äôt see it for this I fear. A tepid buildup for 80% of the song and then the ‚Äúbig moment‚Äù is what sounds like the synths from Depeche Mode - Just Can‚Äôt Get Enough. This song does nothing for me but leave me very frustrated. It feels like it has no structure or intention and really underwhelms me as a generic synthpop cut. Sorry for the hot take I wish I was on the yasss side :pensive:

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (1): 1) why does she have terf bangs? 2) why does this video give such YA vibes? 3) what does this song accomplish that's novel that Robyn hadn't done on body talk? together, all 3 of these create the perfect opportunity so slap an auto 1. this band continues to create some of the most austere, smarmy "tory-coded" pop that I'm gonna have to refute at every opportunity. everyone who likes this band...you can kill yr idols

**akanewasright** (9.5): Kali Uchis is so good at what she does. I've seen people complaining with the release of her most recent album that she hasn't done much artistic evolution... but I think she's found her style of boppy, sexy R&B  so perfectly to the point where there's little point in expanding outwards. She's got better songs than this imo, but I can't say I don't start grooving when this comes on. This has the honor of being the least controversial song in the rate, meaning that that very few people actively disliked it,  with it being held back by a bunch of 7s instead of a few low scores. Congrats to Kali on landing a top 10 song, and here's to rate winner "Moonlight" in 2023!

**RandomHypnotica** (8): I never expected this song to make it into the Top 10, it‚Äôs never been one of my favs from Isolation, but I think it managed to get up here by virtue of being a largely uncontroversial and pleasant bop. I do find that it‚Äôs one of those songs that always gets in my head, thanks to the hook being a common phrase, and that‚Äôs the mark of a smasha to me.

*submitted by /u/awkward_king* 

**Awkward\_King** (10): *ok so this was unsurprisingly my submission! i was looking over my list of songs i was considering and this wasnt my favourite or like meant the most to me (although i do still love it), it's just a fucking GOOD song like... i dont think we will ever get to rerate isolation at least not for three years sjdje and it's easily one of my favourite albums ever. this is the closest we're coming*

**Ambrosia42** (10): real



**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Anyone who gives Closer less than a 6.

**bluetriangles04** (10): maybe the best song that describes the process of having to cut someone out of your life while they're still trying to desperately hold onto you, bcs its such a visceral emotion and universal experience

**bogo** (10): someone should send this song to jk rowling she needs to hear it

**Frajer** (10): reina

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): kali just has such a way with production‚Ä¶ this song is so pretty and luscious! like this is such a hot girls crying in the car song.

**Nagisoid** (10): I forgive her for naming her fanbase Kuchis because she made this song

**pig-serpent** (10): I came for amazing highlight of Kali Uchis' vocal skills and mostly stayed for her vocals, but the rest of the song grew on me too!

**pijus41** (10): just an all around catchy banger and Kali's voice is ethereal. the acoustic version is also beautiful

**plastichaxan** (10): I still can‚Äôt believe I heard this live I can die happily now it was a funish time goodbye popheads

**qazz23** (10): really good production and vocal delivery

**ReallyCreative** (10): shaking my ass in this Nordstrom Rack

**starla\_** (10): gorgeous

**Uberpigeon** (10): Addison is over

**sarcasticsobs** (9.8): Boppin'

**jasannn** (9.5): great bowling alley music

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): oh love the production and vocals

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.5): I felt the vibes and the vibes were right, spot on, fantastic.

**Stryxen** (9.5): sexy as hell and equally pissed off . You're obsessed just let me go ! me to Snore'33"

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): twitter to her during the week leading up to RMIV

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (9.5): KALI MALONE I LOVE YOU SO MUCH! EVEN THO WE COULDN'T GET DOPESMOKER IN THE RATE IM GLAD WE GOT LIVING TOR-oh wait it Kali Uchis. i mean she's good but i was never gonna pay $60+ to see her at the sb bowl. i was too young. great cut, really love the electro-drums that tic tf off as her voice goes all big kaleidoscope.  gonna go find the cd.

**runaway3212** (9): me @ the ice cream man when he forgot my chocolate sprinkles or whatever raye said

**vayyiqra** (9): I don't listen to Kali enough this rules

**vexastrae** (9): a bop for the girlies!

**imbaby122** (8.7): i‚Äôm dead üíÄ

**jman457** (8.7): Isolation is honestly one of the best albums of the 2010‚Äôs.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): jumpscare after the last song

**kvothetyrion** (8): I don‚Äôt love this record (thought her new one was much better) but this song has TWO (2) synth timbres that I love: those really weight bassier synths and then those spacey Guilt Trip synths that I adore so dearly.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i DO believe in the empowerment of angry women

**CrimsonROSET** (7): for the songs who are still alive

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): me after finding out she was dating don toliver

**Raindrac** (7): Kali Uchis has such beautiful and recognizable vocals that I'm surprised that I don't listen to her music more often. Dead To Me was the first Kali Uchis song that I've ever heard and yet I immediately recognized her voice despite having only occasionally heard her as a feature. It's a really well-produced song too, and that synthesizer reminds me of a song which Apple Music recommended to me around 2017 - 2018 that I enjoyed a while back. It's time for me to quit sleeping on this song. 

By the way, there's a snare sample in the chorus that I've recognized in dozens of other songs and I'm going to add this to the playlist. Did you know that this song utilized the same snare sample as Bring Me The Horizon's "Nihilist Blues", Lorde's "Sober II (Melodrama)", Travis Scott's "Antidote", ITZY's "Wannabe", Poppy's "Sit / Stay", Madonna's "Crazy", and Black Cray's "Guddah Princess"? Seriously, this sample is everywhere. I've got over 57 songs in this playlist and counting.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): lily allen realness

#King to these people after seeing their scores:

**apatel27** (6.5): It's missing something

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): more often than not kali is not for me. this has fun production tho

**akanewasright** (10): It truly takes me out how this is *the* song that every pop listener grabbed onto from this album. Like it makes sense, this is the only thing on the album that I'd call a straight up pop song, but it's still funny that a non-single became such a consensus fave among this audience. I find this song straight up irresistible, with its disco influences, campy bridge, and soaring vocals, but not everyone was as taken with it. Some were put off by the strings (which are Kelsey's specialty as a cellist), some were taken aback by the bridge, some didn't buy into the dance beat. But for the rest of us, this is a very real banger, and one I'm happy to see got a second chance after the worldvision rate

**RandomHypnotica** (10): whilst I didn‚Äôt end up submitting to the Worldvision rate, I did have a listen to it‚Äôs playlist and found myself pleasantly surprised that in a sea of fairly typical synthpop in the top of the rate, the US entry was actually a really beautiful, extravagant and camp song, capped off with the most eurovision core bridge I could possibly imagine. Kelsey Lu is a treasure and this whole album is great, I‚Äôm glad this song finally got to see the light of day in a ‚Äúreal‚Äù rate, but a little bummed it didn‚Äôt fully receive it‚Äôs dues.

**TiltControls** (6): it's nice, but the spoken part took me out a little

**IIIHenryIII** (5): why do all the bad songs have to be the longest ones?

**Raindrac** (4): Meh... It sounded pleasant, but I don't really feel a desire to go back to this one. It was a little boring, polished to the point of losing its edge. Their vocals are good, though. I'll give them that.

**kvothetyrion** (3): Oh man, none of this works at all. Ballad vocals, boring dance beat, random superfluous string section, and a spoken word that is obviously trying to be camp but just comes off as awkward.

**flava** (0): so clean and calculated, so fake, so poor, so emotionless

**akanewasright** (11): This being SEVENTH PLACE despite having the most 11s in the rate is actually disgusting... you tankers will not see heaven I'm so sorry. This song practically *invented* new jack swing, a defining sound of 80s and 90s R&B, and gave Janet one of the most bombastic vehicles for her endless charisma... let me stop writing before I yell at people by name. But at the very least, this outperformed the last time this song was rated, where Janet barely scraped into the top 10 with this track, and that's worth celebrating.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this was the very first song that got submitted to the rate, and I honestly thought that we‚Äôd found our winner then and there. And yet somehow, the song managed to continually underperform and find itself not even in the top 5! Kinda robbed and you should all feel bad

*submitted by /u/babadork*

**babadork** (11): *Janet Jackson needs to win a rate, and the results of Control vs. Like a Virgin vs. Purple Rain vs. Thriller are especially bad. Justin Timberlake has won a rate before her, and that is bullshit.*

---

#Don't Ever Change

**Catrick** (11): One of the songs that started it all. The run from Control to All For You is without a doubt one of most immaculate runs in pop music history. You know when you made such an impact when the FIVE consecutive albums you released are being analyzed at a scholarly level.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): ended created invented and cleared the concept of first and last names

**Frajer** (11): I'm not nasty so I don't know what to call her, so I'll just say Control/Nasty/What Have You Done For Me Lately is an insane run

**ImADudeDuh** (11): https://i.imgur.com/Bop3Dsx.png

**mysario** (11): rob this song once, shame on you - rob this song twice, still shame on you

**shipperondeck** (11): on god we are going to get janet a rate win

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): WHO'S THAT RATING NASTY SONGS? NASTY BOYS!

**vexastrae** (11): MISS JACKSON ........... IF YOURE NASTY!

**1998tweety** (10): *insert butterfly comment*

**Ambrosia42** (10): ms jackson if you‚Äôre nasty!!

**bogo** (10): it is indeed nasty (complimentary)

**DaHumanTorch** (10): would've been my 11 if not for my own submission. one of the best most iconic songs of all time

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorites from her

**jay** (10): girl we collapsed

**JIRACHl** (10): Would've given my 11 but traveling + Janet has way better songs

**jsonphile** (10): look I‚Äôve committed enough popheads crimes in this rate I‚Äôm not gonna ruin my credibility further by not giving Miss Jackson a 10

**oscarbrierley1** (10): yasss ms jackson

**plastichaxan** (10): Now that‚Äôs a beat

**ReallyCreative** (10): cultural reset

**ricki** (10): will this be strong enough to beat oldsongphobia and take the crown? find out in the next episode of rupauls drag raceü¶ãü¶ãü¶ã

**Roxieloxie** (10): this isnt gonna win at the last minute and its gonna be terrible but i know enough to know that theres no way this rate can have good results

**runaway3212** (10): Janet Jackson so iconic for inventing feminism

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Yeah.

**shadowtheweedhog** (10): Janet has so much talent it's WILD

**Stryxen** (10): Asia o'hara you were supposed to always be famous

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): honestly I should have like set a 10 cap and just given everything else spite 9.9s because this is here. Control has had a very long tail affect on my personal taste. It got 8th place in that p4k 80s list somewhat out of left field (but also totally made sense and foreshadowed the deserved Velvet Rope inclusion) and always sat in my mind.

**Raindrac** (9.6): They gave her a beat alright! Nasty has one of the most propulsive beats of the '80s, and even more impressively Janet Jackson doesn't let it steal the spotlight because of how much energy that she delivers with her own performance. Nasty is one of those songs where moving along with the music is irresistable. I'd even call it a headbanger, which is... quite unusual for a pop song! 

Nasty received my second highest score in the rate, only behind 4'33". I'm sure you've seen my massive comment about why I gave 4'33" an 11 by now; after all, there's no way that Nasty will go out before it. Because Nasty is my second highest score of the rate, if 4'33" wasn't in this rate then Nasty would've been my 11 of choice. But even if Nasty wins, I won't regret this. If I wanted a chance at winning then, I would've given my 11 to Nasty!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): If this doesn‚Äôt win I will be SHOCKED. However, I‚Äôm not sure it‚Äôs even in my top 5 on Control.

**jasannn** (9): this gives slinky dog energy

**qazz23** (9): love the synth throughout and the hard hitting drums

**starla\_** (9): this song is forever associated with Asia O'Hara for me

**TiltControls** (9): ü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ãü¶ã

**vayyiqra** (9): Title is fitting, that synth bass is filthy. This owns.

**welcome2thejam** (9): It's me, I'm the nasty boy

**imbaby122** (8.2): i‚Äôm so sure you could physically feel the culture shifting when this song was released.

**anothertown** (8): Janet Privacy Control

**CrimsonROSET** (8): its crazy this might not be in the top half for me it‚Äôs one of the janet songs i never really cared for but the talent is still there

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (8): this song brought back trauma

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Not my favorite Janet song

**jdmun148** (8): I will forever associate this with the Drag Race butterfly fiasco

**jman457** (8): fun throwback

**NotWith10000Men** (8): the drums in janet songs always go hard

**phonethephoenix** (8): you can definitely see how influential this song is!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i think my cat really likes this song bc she kept purring really loudly the whole time it was on

**Adavman** (7.5): Janet‚Äôs doing great but I‚Äôm just not the biggest fan of the instrumental here

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Very solid beat.  It's not my favorite song here but I won't be upset when it wins.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): I cannot get over the fact that there‚Äôs this weird annoying ticking sound throughout the song that sounds like Maggie Simpson sucking her pacifier on a loop. A bit distracting, but not enough to distract me from such a classic tune!

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): she eerily reminds me of MJ in the MV, intriguing that they share a last name as well. by chance, do they happen to be related?

**Awkward\_King** (7): ewwww yucky eww gross

**camerinian** (7): I think I wanted this to go somewhere earlier than it did. Neat little outro and brilliant riff but it‚Äôs static for 80% of its runtime and that‚Äôs disappointing

**frogaranaman** (7): she set up so many brand names for gay kink wear w this song

**Nagisoid** (7): I was sitting on the bus listening to the Ratrick playlist when this started playing and a short moment after a lady sat on my lap for no reason. I moved away because I was uncomfortable and she didn't even notice what she was doing??? At least it didn't affect my score....

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): i wish all catcallers a very drop dead

#WHO'S THAT THINKING NASTY THOUGHTS?

**kvothetyrion** (6.5): I don‚Äôt know why, I‚Äôve never been able to connect with Janet‚Äôs music. I love her brother‚Äôs music, I adore Prince, I love so much other similar pop, but I always just think she‚Äôs fine and nothing more. I hope it‚Äôll click with my more someday.

**bluetriangles04** (6): damn she really called them out...

**impla77** (6): RIP Asia‚Äôs butterflies

**nooodisaster** (6): Aged very harshly. That bridge tho remains iconic.

**apatel27** (5): Yeah sorry Janet but this is one of your worst singles

**IIIHenryIII** (5): it sounds like any other song from that time

**lexiareder** (3): I just don't get it I'm sorry

**bulforster** (2.8): I love Janet and think Rhythm Nation, janet. and The Velvet Rope are all amazing albums but I have just never got the hype around Control. It has some cute songs but compared to the three (or even five) albums after it? It just doesn't hold a candle to them and this song exemplifies a lot of reasons why - it's just so rigid and stiff (how robotic and lifeless the gated drums sound I'm especially not a fan of) and how punchy everything in the production is trying to be just does not mesh with Janet's voice for me at all.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): Despite having a promising early lead, the song ended up getting a series of low scores and never recovered. Personally I think it‚Äôs *fine*, the vocaloid producer‚Äôs touch is very obvious and I really enjoy it, but honestly weirdly the vocals are kinda just not really doing it for me. I do like [this live performance quite a bit more however](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1hft9Wjq9U)

**akanewasright** (8.5): Wow! We sure do like this song here don't we! I definitely enjoy this one a lot, although I do like [slowed down and groovier version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j1hft9Wjq9U) much more than the main version of the song. It's cool that a Japanese song did this well in a largely English rate, but man... this beat out so many all timers for me. In the end, this got held back by a few low scores, but this was briefly winning/in the top 3 before they started coming in.

*submitted by /u/takeonmebya-ha* 

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): *oh my beloved yoru ni kakeru, what can i say about you that hasnt been said a hundred times before? well for starters, this is basically one degree of separation away from being a vocaloid song so of course im gonna be obsessed with it. but even putting personal bias aside, this is just one of the most expertly crafted and majestic songs ive heard in my life. ikura‚Äôs vocals are so expressive and beautiful, and ayase‚Äôs signature production elevates this song to a whole ‚Äònother level of amazing, that piano riff is one of the most recognizable riffs in all of j-pop for a reason. and that final key change, giving the song such an anthemic ending‚Ä¶i wish i could create any form of art even half as beautiful as that. that‚Äôs not even getting into the lyrics, a retelling of the short story ‚Äútemptation of thanatos‚Äù, which i highly recommend everyone who loves this song to read, its super short and only takes about 10 minutes to read, but knowing the story behind this song only increases its impact for me. ok im probably writing way to much for a song thats gonna get #11 at best in this rate but üíÄ i just think its one of the best songs of all time!!!*

#voting for the Vocaloid Rate this cycle

**bigbigbee** (11): The official English version of this is so clunky that I thought it was fan-translated by a 14 year old, as is the rite of passage for all good Japanese songs. And so that my 11 comment isn‚Äôt JUST hate, I want to say that as soon as I heard this, even as someone who listens to a fair amount of j-pop, I knew that this was something special. The Tik Tok rate was in August, so I didn‚Äôt hear it until the 8th month of the year, and even STILL this song was one of my Top 5 in my 2021 spotify wrapped.

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (11): Literally one of the best songs ever‚Ä¶ the lyrics are so depressing but it is a flat out bop.

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**Ambrosia42** (10): wait this is hitting

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I need to listen to more J-Pop I just know there‚Äôs so much BleepBloopMusicFan-core to be discovered in that genre.

**bluetriangles04** (10): YOASOBI GENUINELY NEVER FAILS... even their most recent theme for Oshi No Ko was just *chefs kiss*

**bogo** (10): i have nothing interesting to say about this song lol it just goes off

**camerinian** (10): the energy of this track is all over the fucking place, but in a deliberately timed roller coaster type way. So yeah its the perfect TikTok type song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): let it be known saying something has anime opening energy is the highest form of praise

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): been obsessed with this probably since 2019? a smash!!!

**frogaranaman** (10): Tiktok you will be avenged

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): fuck yeah

**hunnybee12** (10): a mastery of music and storytelling and language and drama whew

**jay** (10): girl we fainted

**Nagisoid** (10): YOASOBI have one song that changes slightly each time but this is by far the best iteration they made out of that formula

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): i hope this wins

**phonethephoenix** (10): i like this!

**ReallyCreative** (10): more like YASSSSSSOBI

**ricki** (10): we need more western music so feel so badshit as this does

**runaway3212** (10): imagine making music this good... like some bitch was in the study and MADE this talented people are so insane ugh I love to be alive

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Doing backflips and sprints and and spinning kicks and karate chops in my room rn to this

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): the coolest piano ive ever heard

**throwaway-7650** (10): we hate you MGMT (yes I'm still bitter over AS5)

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): she needs my ten don't harm yourself just pull a weed or break a bottle

**shipperondeck** (9.8): holy crap i knew they were popular but i had no idea they were 440mil+ popular... anyway stream ayase's vocaloid work

**bulforster** (9.7): dang my b for not getting behind securing this a spot in AS5, thank you to whoever forced this slapper into my ears through this rate

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.7): songs about death are always so catchy what is this

**Adavman** (9.5): This is amazing. Could have easily been a 10 but even though I ultimately decided not to give it hat score I still absolutely  love this.

**kvothetyrion** (9.5): That bassline! That piano! This shit rules!!! Probably my favorite discovery of the rate.

**Awkward\_King** (9): i laughed, i cried, i cheered, i yelled, i partied..... i moved

**mysario** (9): I'm nostalgic for an anime I've never seen and probably doesn't exist

**pijus41** (9): what a song to close on, that piano-type sound is a highlight

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): still bangs

**qazz23** (9): good chorus, piano, and vocal delivery

**vayyiqra** (9): Swear every time I see this song's name I think "wow I love that song" but then can never remember how it goes but at least on some level I know I like it!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): That ugly-ass key change has not gotten any better sorry

**welcome2thejam** (9): I feel I've grown as a rater since Tik Tok rate one and a half years ago, and I'm proud to show it by giving this wonderful track ONE extra point

**Raindrac** (8.5): Â§ú„Å´ÈßÜ„Åë„Çã is a beautiful song, and I'm looking forward to understanding the depths of these lyrics once I learn more Japanese. I mentioned in my comment for Traveling that songs like these are what help motivate me in my journey of learning Japanese, and that couldn't be any more true here. And lyrics aside, it's a bop as well. It has been a long time since I've heard a pop song use the piano this well. Polished to perfection.

**starla\_** (8.5): love the chaotic piano melody

**TiltControls** (8.5): the world wouldve been a better place if this made it into AS5 instead of LDA

**vexastrae** (8.5): yall need to listen to The Home Take version of this it goes hard

**apatel27** (8): https://www.tiktok.com/@nearlyeveryone/video/6996271389720300806

**imbaby122** (7.5): omfg u play that piano girllll!

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): her voice is really pleasant

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): YOASOBI be like "üåà‚ú®I wanna kill myself‚ú®üåà"

**nooodisaster** (7): no thoughts just vibes

#Â§ñ‰∫∫

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): https://i.imgur.com/2Ys7lZE.mp4

**Poydoo** (6.5): I like the keyboard but the vocal performance is kinda flat

**jman457** (6.3): it had a fun piano breakdown

**Uberpigeon** (6): i feel like ive heard a million songs like this

**beeozan** (5.5): idk how i have listened to yoasobi for like 5 times maximum and the third chorus key change is tiring me out already

**Stryxen** (5): i wanna like this but no matter how many times i listen it just passes over me

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): too happy

**cremeebrulee** (0): overrated ass song

**akanewasright** (10): This is a gorgeous song, and one that I have on a playlist to calm myself down when I'm feeling anxious. There's so much I could talk about - Pharrell's production, Beyonc√©'s backing vocals at the end, the pop accessibility of it - but my brain has been utterly destroyed by the comment on the banner. Please give it a look, I can't be the only one who experiences this psychic damage.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): I haven‚Äôt really been able to get into Frank‚Äôs music yet (it feels like he makes every attempt to stop me sometimes), so I won‚Äôt say much here other than it‚Äôs really pleasant and i‚Äôm glad to see it made it this far

*submitted by /u/ignitethephoenix* 

**ignitethephoenix** (10): *I‚Äôm not the biggest fan of this album (which I know is a hot take) but this is probably my all time fave Frank song. Love how gorgeous he sounds and how mellow it is, and Beyonce‚Äôs backing vocals are such an amazing climax to the song.*

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): my top song of 2018

**ReallyCreative** (10): my robbery alarm is going off but I hope I‚Äôm wrong

**seanderlust** (10): prime riding a bike on a sunny day in spring or early summer music. just trust me on this one.

**shipperondeck** (10): his best song

**starla\_** (10): transcendent

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (9.5): evil blackpink

**imbaby122** (9.5): listening to this song while looking at the clear sky through my open window and smelling the lingering scent of spring air oh my god i just died.

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.5): i am feeling so many ways listening to this song i feel like i am in love and i have not been in love in years and years like i could be whisked out my door on a date immediately

**Ambrosia42** (9): gorg

**mysario** (9): his songs can't miss even if as a performer he misses all the time

**Nagisoid** (9): The good thing about doing rates really late is you can include comments about drama that happened close to the deadline. Anyways did y'all know Frank flopped at Coachella?

**vexastrae** (9): removing one point for whatever tf happened at coachella

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (9): frank ocean is so talented [voice of someone hearing this song for the first time and nodding up and down 1.5 standard drinks deep into the rate]

**welcome2thejam** (9): All this song does is make me even more upset that we've gone this long without a new Frank Ocean album

**phonethephoenix** (8.2): nice tune

**beeozan** (8): the beginning of the song reminds me of top gear

**bogo** (8): beyonce slaying background vocals here

**CrimsonROSET** (8): he‚Äôs just like me fr fr

**JIRACHl** (8): BEYONC√â??!!!

**qazz23** (8): i like the piano and vocal layering

**Roxieloxie** (8): if this rate happened like 2 months earlier than it did, this would've been my 11 but my phase with it ended, not because of anything he did at coachella but i've found a new frank song to get into now

**Stryxen** (8): frank ocean

**throwaway-7650** (8): ...light pink?

**bigbigbee** (7.5): Pink and white? like Lil Mariko‚Äôs outfit in the Where‚Äôs My Juul music video?

**Raindrac** (7.5): Very pleasant R&B with some beautiful lyrics. Still, I feel like I'm missing something here and I'll probably revisit it once I finally listen to the rest of Blonde.

**runaway3212** (7.5): A vibe a banger a slay

**1998tweety** (7): black + pink >>>>

**bluetriangles04** (7): "BEYONC√â?"

**Poydoo** (7): kinda boring tbh. I've never listened to any of his albums but I'm super unimpressed compared to the hype

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): we‚Äôre never getting the blond rerate now üò≠

**TiltControls** (7): A good song, but never really was my fave Frank track (I will be 11ing self control if we ever get that blonde rerate though)

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a zero discourse zone about Frank Ocean but I do not Get his music or quite why he's so beloved, I think he's alright though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This sounds like a hot summer day

#were at Coachella Weekend 1

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I don‚Äôt get it

**ricki** (6.5): me trying to justify sabotaging this song: i have to give it a low score in respect of people that spent hundreds of dollars to go see him at coachella

**jman457** (6.3): I was gonna 10 this so Frank can finally get a rate win, but then coachella happened, so ill me brutal in adminiting this is bottom 5 on Blonde. Good thing Beyonce is on this

**ImADudeDuh** (6): https://i.imgur.com/XmOPbvV.png

**OliviaGodrigo** (6): his favorite hole colors

**IIIHenryIII** (5): 3 + 2

**pig-serpent** (4.5): Yeah it's beautiful I guess but his music isn't really my vibe and I'm often bored by it.  With this song too the piano line is very similar to a massive early 2000s r&b hit that I can't remember the name of right now so most of my time listening to this song is me trying to think of the other one.

**nooodisaster** (4): just 8 more years of these grab bag rates and I'll have listened to all of Blonde

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): oh look it's that coachella LOSER

**akanewasright** (10): Well! This sure was a surprise! This song has always been a favorite of mine from Rina's debut, but I figured its ballad-y nature would result in a a few low scores. Which... I mean, it got a 0, but that didn't actually do much to knock the song down. Hell, this song was second place for AGES while having a 0. And like... as much as I like this song, I was actively rooting against it at points. Honestly, this beating out Frank and Janet still kind of makes me a little mad, but it is a really great song... just in a 10th place way instead of a 4th place way.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): This song came way too close to winning, for way too long for my liking. Look, I love Rina, i love this album and I do actually love this song. But not only did any song from SAWAYAMA need redemption, particularly from *that* rate, but I would sooner see half of the tracklist here over this song. It‚Äôs great, but it would‚Äôve been a very underwhelming winner, and in the end I think it‚Äôs 4th place feels right.

*submitted by u/impla77*

**impla77** (11): *Fuck it.. I have no shame. This was my submission, I knew I was most likely going to pick Rina, and even though it‚Äôs probably not even in my top 3 favourites from the album but it was just calling for me to pick it!! And it‚Äôs 11 worthy, so I want at least one person to give it an 11!!*

---

#I just waaaant your loooove, all to myself!

**1998tweety** (11): shes so rotten for placing this near the bottom of her Sawayama ranking. This song makes me ASCEND.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): the fact that she called this 2nd worst on the album is actually so damaging like this is life altering??

**Ambrosia42** (10): the way i thought this was about wanting a monogamous queer relationship at first

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don‚Äôt think I gave this the highest score when we first rated it but since then I have definitely checked into the Tokyo Love Hotel Love Hotel.

**bogo** (10): best song on sawayama

**camerinian** (10): it is actually insane how fucking good Rina is at putting social and racial discourse into pop music without watering any of the very important issues down. Like that is such a niche skill that I don‚Äôt think many of us would actually want from our pop stars, but Rina does it effortlessly while never skimping on the craft

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): honestly brilliant

**DirtyRat583** (10): the fact that [rina sawayama] is literally mother right now

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): THIS IS JUST THE BEST SONG ABOUT TOKYO!!!

**hikk** (10): when this supercuts the rate YUPPP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/EFaQW9w.png

**imbaby122** (10): take me back to when sawayama dropped it was the last time i felt pure joy (ignoring that april 2020 was peak covid times)

**jay** (10): girl we fainted

**JIRACHl** (10): This deserves a 10 just for the fact that it's on SAWAYAMA

**Nagisoid** (10): Day off in Tokyo, got bored at the Love Hotel

**pijus41** (10): Rina Sawayama vs. The Weeaboos

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Certified masterpieeeeece!!!!!!

**ricki** (10): for someone that has made such amazing music, rina sure has awful opinions about it

**runaway3212** (10): I love rina so much like im ready to give her a 10+ average in sub faves

**shadowtheweedhog** (10): i love her voice and this song showcases it SO well i have so many nice things to say about this song but i just am going to be vibing to it for the rest of the week

**starla\_** (10): I love the lyrics and message behind this

**thedoctordances1940** (10): even though sawayama has grown off me a bit, or at least certain songs, this is still just absolutely fantastic and probably my favourite track on the album

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): she ended weebs here

**throwaway-7650** (10): when this outplaces HTG (the album)

**vayyiqra** (10): Her fans and even Rina herself don't like this? I think it's great. üè©

**vexastrae** (10): the tokyo love hotel in question being the continental OMG WHAT

**welcome2thejam** (10): Transcendent

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): who up johnning they wick (i dont know??)

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): I'm super behind on the Rina Sawayama hype train but I can definitely see why she was getting so much recognition throughout this album rollout. This song is amazing...

**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): wish i was around when this album was rated

**jman457** (9.5): such a great pop track

**plastichaxan** (9.5): This is a 10 but I‚Äôve given enough sorry girl I still think you‚Äôre amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (9): do the anime rate

**jsonphile** (9): why do I always hear ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt want a chicken‚Äù

**nooodisaster** (9): Me planning a tourist trip to Tokyo this year: "We are going to pretend we didn't hear that!"

**NotWith10000Men** (9): i love the vibes of this one

**qazz23** (9): like the tokyooooo vocals and chorus, not quite the best off the album though

**sarcasticsobs** (9): John Wick 4

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): there was a time when i would call this my favorite song on sawayama. while i dont think i would say that today (akasaka sad sweep) this is still so touching and emotional in a way the rest of the album really doesnt that makes this such an easy highlight

**Uberpigeon** (9): i dont revisit this album as much as i ought to but seeing rina live was a transcendental experience so i will always love everything from SAWAYAMA

**Frajer** (8.5): this song and Kyoto by Phoebe are in the same cinematic universe

**apatel27** (8): weeb popheads in shambles

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I‚Äôve actually listened to a One Direction album now so I no longer think this sounds like a One Direction song

**kvothetyrion** (8): Is Tokyo Love Hotel a euphemism for something

**Poydoo** (8): Neither do I üòå

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this isn‚Äôt comme de garcons

**TiltControls** (7.5): I guess this is just another rate bound for the controversy leaderboard

**Adavman** (7): This really is just another song about Tokyo

**IIIHenryIII** (7): honestly, I don‚Äôt understand what the fuck one of the weakest tracks on Sawayama is doing here

**beeozan** (6): this is like my least favorite song from sawayama :( it's exclusively 2 of the rate for me

**Roxieloxie** (6): rina you know what you did and i will find you one day

**Stryxen** (6): its shrunk a bit but still good

**Raindrac** (5): I hate to say it, but the mix might've sunk this song for me. The instruments blend together to the extent that nothing stands out‚Äî not the hooks or Rina's wonderful vocals. The lyrics are alright, and I appreciate the dual meaning, but they just aren't captivating enough to carry the song for me.

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (0): irrational hate 0 rewarded to Rina Sawayama, who just continues to baffle me tbh. lyrics are fine and the beat is fine, but I just got out of the dentist and heard a bit of that 2010 bt album and wasn't vibing and then coming into the library and hearing this just makes me go "why THIS beat?" "why THIS set of semi-nonchalant lyrics?"; like it just feels like a lil vapid pop nugget. it's fine gang! the guitars here are better implemented than XS (which was total one trick bullshit bait y'all gobble up). But honestly with this, I feel like Rina is seriously lacking the art pop BITE that could take this cut to really warrant the idea of redemption. She really doesn't have the commentary that feels cunning OR a sound rooted in something that calls attention to the whole artifice of this all (if this song were actually funny perhaps it'd be an 11). it's too streamlined, too "released on Dirty Hit", too whatever to matter for me. thus, 0 points awarded.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Oh, Hikki, we‚Äôre really in it now‚Ä¶ despite a once promising lead and a strong showing of dedicated fans, traveling never really had a chance at winning. It did manage to finally overtake Tokyo Love Hotel thanks to the very last ballot. Also this does weirdly parallel Track 10‚Äôs journey from Cyberpop to AS6, both songs finishing in 3rd place in both of their rates to the disappointment of their hardcore fans.

**akanewasright** (10): Oh man... this was so close to winning at points, and yet so far. This is about where I expected "traveling" to end up (high up the rankings, but pretty far away from the winner points-wise), but man... the fact that this is the highest placing song that didn't get selected by the wheel mini-game is kind of painful to me. Like I adore the two songs ahead of it, I gave both of them easy 10s, but two songs that were selected by chance beat out one of my favorite songs by one of my favorite artists. But either way, I'm glad that this eternally danceable SMASHA got the respect it deserves from most of the ballots.

#We're ridin'

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I gave this an 8.6 in its original rate. I mean, (1) it should have been at least a 10 but also (2) the fact that I was using weird ass decimal scores back then‚Ä¶scary.

**flava** (11): it‚Äôs good

**JIRACHl** (11): I don't know where she's traveling to but wherever she goes I'm going with MOTHER

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): I really should have 11ed this in EAPR. Dreamy looking out the train window vibes, but also irresistibly danceable and life-affirming.

**seanderlust** (11): i cannot stress enough to everyone reading this to stream this album. it is honestly incredible

**vayyiqra** (11): I swear this song comes into my head every time I'm on a bus or train ... I don't like when songs have That One Line that gets hyped up a lot when the rest of the song is also great (see: "The Louvre") but also why *is* that line so good ... anyway this rules and so does the video and it would be a "slay" winner so I'm 11ing it, the vibe just feels right. When do we get to rate *Bad Mode*?

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**Adavman** (10): My favourite discovery of the rate. Just an absolute bop. Special mention to this song‚Äôs colourful music video which was my favourite of the rate (I did this rate through YouTube so I saw all of them)

**Ambrosia42** (10): a smash

**Awkward\_King** (10): jpop more like j pussy pop

**beeozan** (10): Sakura Drops was in more need of a redemption imo (its an easy 11 for me) but we love maximizing the chances of a hikki win. Traveling to the number one spot so true

**camerinian** (10): this literally just sounds like a Jessie Ware track in Japanese of course it's perfect

**CrimsonROSET** (10): where are we going utada

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): she travelled to the mother lake‚Ä¶

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): this is the best discovery of the rate for me - i have streamed this nonstop since the reveal! everytime i listen to this, I notice another new detail. this still sounds so fresh even 20 years later, and hikki's voice is unmatched here! they are the parent i never had etc.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Sorry for sending flop songs to All Stars Hikki!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): bop, my 11 from this rate!

**impla77** (10): mv is giving dystopian teletubbies

**jay** (10): girl okay the serve

**Nagisoid** (10): I want to travel to a universe where Hikki has more western fans!!!

**phonethephoenix** (10): i discovered this song through this sun and fell in love! sooo good

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): robbed in EAPR

**Poydoo** (10): I don't understand what she's saying but this bops hard

**qazz23** (10): love this dancey sound

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song would absolutely devour while in an airport they knew what they were doing!

**runaway3212** (10): She's so camp she's so legend

**sarcasticsobs** (10): [immediately stops after reading "Hikaru Utada" on the ballot]: oh cool, another 11 contenda.

**shipperondeck** (10): omg i need to listen to them more

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): common Hikaru Utada slay

**vexastrae** (10): omg representing the nonbinaries in this rate so true!

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (10): omg am i on toonami? or am i one of 'em japan-only ps1 video games. idk how they do it but this is such a slam dunk. i want them to come and play this in my backyard for my bbq

**kvothetyrion** (9.5): I‚Äôve been meaning to check out more Hikaru Utada after really loving last year‚Äôs BAD MODE, and I love this too! This songs feels like it could play as I‚Äôm going through a wormhole of some sort. This is a BIG compliment from me.

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.5): I don't think Hikaru Utada has a bad song and if she does, I haven't heard it.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): we love hikki in this house

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): we need to start including hikki in the ‚Äúwho would flop most in a rate: charli florence fob etc‚Äù conversation

**bogo** (9): it‚Äôs going places alright

**pijus41** (9): I guess Winona Ryder told her to go after all

**throwaway-7650** (9): closer/high controversy songs in their rank graphs:

**TiltControls** (9): one of my favourite discoveries from that rate. this song is just so full of joy

**Uberpigeon** (9): dont invite their ass to play basketball

**imbaby122** (8.5): hikaru no skip discography utada

**babadork** (8): I would watch an entire documentary about the making of the music video.

**bluetriangles04** (8): relaxing to an unbelievable degree. you best believe I added this to my nap playlist

**frogaranaman** (8): listening to this song was illegal during covid

**hunnybee12** (8): h&m core but japanese

**jsonphile** (8): Magnus Carlson GOAT

**nooodisaster** (8): They snapped. Anti-work anthem that feels and sounds as free as the lyrics describe. (Break My Soul wishes)

**pig-serpent** (8): This song is great, but just a little longer than it needs to be.

**starla\_** (8): Utada is one of those artists I really need to get more into

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): If I ever did a rate I would also advertise it by posting memes to phcj

**welcome2thejam** (8): Popheads Rates roadtrip with Hikaru Utada

**jman457** (7.5): a viby little track, even if it drags a but

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://i.imgur.com/WOYzdwo.png

#Stationary

**Roxieloxie** (6): if i speak the nerds will kill me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I‚Äôm not huge on hikki‚Äôs earlier stuff. This is fine but doesn‚Äôt do a lot for me. Something about the chorus sounds awkward to me. Their 2010s output is hugely more my thing, they really shine there. Stream ‚ÄúDarenimo Iwanai‚Äù wow what a song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i really wish i saw in utada what the very dedicated echo chamber of like 8 raters sees in them

**oscarbrierley1** (4): feels every second of its five minute run time. the word travelling has lost all meaning.

**Raindrac** (4): This is such a pretty song! The production is lush and the metaphors are vivid. Perhaps I should resume learning Japanese and explore the rest of Hikaru Utada's discography. Traveling would be worth revisiting once I understand more of the lyrics.

**IIIHenryIII** (3): the song isn't good to be this long; 5 minutes of pure boredom

**moonagenightmares** (3): this had nice moments but it was so painfully long for such a mediocre song

**akanewasright** (10): Tkay Maidza is such a goddamn gem. There has been so much talent among the new class of up and coming women in rap, but Tkay stands out even among that group for having such a clear artistic vision and for her pure *ability* in rap. This song goes viral on twitter every few months because she just rides that beat *that* fucking well. This was never close to winning, making it to #2 basically because the other songs in that range got tanked enough to allow this to spring slightly ahead of them. This marks the second time a song from this EP has placed second in a rate (along with "Shook" placing behind "Damn Daniel" in the 2020 EP rate), which... well, hopefully one day Tkay will find the right rate combination to pull off the win. Here's to hoping 2023 is the year of Miss Maidza's domination!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Once again, Tkay just narrowly misses out on a rate win‚Ä¶ I was so glad to see this get sent to the wheel, and then for it to actually manage to win a spot here too? Only to lose out to the *other* song chosen by the wheel? You couldn‚Äôt script this drama. This song is a divine transcendental ride, Tkay‚Äôs flow is fantastic, the production is meticulous and perfect, and I think this is a sign that we need to hurry up and find a way to rate LYWWV3

*submitted to the Wheel of Un-luck by /u/throwaway-7650* 

**throwaway-7650** (11): *well someone must carry on u/hikkaru's tradition of being the solo 11 of their own submission in a meta rate, in this essay I will-*

#Golden Girls

**CrimsonROSET** (11): i‚Äôm sorry she just SOARS on the beat and her voice is immaculate like it‚Äôs insane tkay isn‚Äôt big

**Roxieloxie** (11): I met tkay after one of her shows cause she came out while i was waiting for my uber and started talking to people and i was like oh shit so i just cancelled my uber and waited, she was really nice! And her set was so high energy despite the fact that i saw her in the tiniest room I had ever seen a show inside in my life.

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): this is azealia-core

**Ambrosia42** (10): smash

**apatel27** (10): gold

**Awkward\_King** (10): the vocal effect that makes it sound like the sound is coming and going is SO cunt

**beeozan** (10): magic in the air

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is such a bop I have no choice but to make a valiant but ultimately unsuccessful attempt at dancing.

**bogo** (10): ngl i can‚Äôt hear the chorus as anything other than ‚Äúplease fuck by with this‚Äù. i know that phrase doesn‚Äôt make any sense but it‚Äôs what my brain interprets

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is such a tasteful pick i wanna kiss its submitter on the mouth

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): true

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): maybe the second best person who came out of Australia (after Hypno)????

**frogaranaman** (10): this is sultry smooth silk

**jay** (10): girl the talentry

**Nagisoid** (10): Bruno Mars lost all his magic after he heard this collapse

**oscarbrierley1** (10): summer slay

**pijus41** (10): Tkay's flow is immaculate

**qazz23** (10): love the dance driven beat of this and the alternating between singing/rapping

**ReallyCreative** (10): what if Tkay and Bree collabed‚Ä¶ manifesting

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Boppin'

**shipperondeck** (10): idk what's cooler, the cover art or the song itself

**Stryxen** (10): instant modern classic

**vexastrae** (10): WE NEED TKAY MAIDZA TO BE A MAIN POP GIRL NOWWW

**welcome2thejam** (10): Wish I did this rate, got hard into this and the MagBay EP. The fattest damn groove around, the chorus sends my ears into another dimension

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): This is the first time I'm hearing this song but I really love this. Reminds me of Disclosure during their debut album era. Such a sleek and smooth song...

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.5): more songs should have a reference to tetris especially when they‚Äôre this good goddamn the chorus is smooth and the rap is good like hot dang

**starla\_** (9.5): I've been a Tkay fan since her early singles and am still so sad I didn't get to see her live last year thanks to Ticketek's servers going down and the concert she was meant to open for starting 1.5 hours late

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): lywwv2 still just being so amazing

**jman457** (9.3): ooh this fucked. I hope she is like a less problematic Azealia banks

**phonethephoenix** (9.1): so niceeee

**1998tweety** (9): im boppin

**Adavman** (9): A real groovy bop

**camerinian** (9): pretty hard to fuck up hip house. Unless you're Chance The Rapper. But this isn't by him, so it's good.

**kvothetyrion** (9): Definitely my favorite track off this project, love that four-on-the-floor beat. Her flow is so, so good here.

**TiltControls** (9): tkay just flies through this song and demolishes it

**vayyiqra** (9): Why do we all seem to forget that Tkay Maidza exists when we're not rating her even though her music goes hard

**Raindrac** (8.8): The groove in this song is fantastic, and the vocal manipulation in the chorus was a bold decision that played out perfectly. I don't have much else to say about this one, but 24K is still one of my favorite new discoveries in this rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): https://i.imgur.com/aUoq016.png

**Poydoo** (8.5): First Class, up in the sky

**imbaby122** (8): untz untz untz untz

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Wish there was less sidechain on the vocals but other than that, I‚Äôm rockin‚Äô with it. This is dope.

**runaway3212** (8): Bruno Mars your days are numbered

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): She's funky

**bigbigbee** (7.5): This song reminds me of a really fun Barbie dress up game I had for PC when I was a kid

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (7.5): fergie's glamorous is in the rate we already have a bougie banger! this one is more a booty twerk banger. I think the whole package is here but the video leaves a lot to be desired. should be more inventive than with the lenses and boxing setting it chooses to focus on

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): this rate was like a critical choice point in popheads history‚Ä¶ careers were made and broken here

#[24 Carrots](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFOe371W4AAKlTn.jpg)

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Perfectly nice. Didn‚Äôt grow on me as I relistened but check back in 6 months & it totally could.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): im very whelmed

**IIIHenryIII** (5): Bruno Mars continues unbothered, but I know it's an unfair comparison; his song has magic

**flava** (4): yeah im starting to think tkay isnt for me, something about this just doesnt make me want to shake my ass, and I feel like that is the sole purpose of this song, sorry Australia

**pig-serpent** (4): My ears don't like this type of beat where it cuts in and out like this.  It's a cool trick, but it makes my head hurt.  Besides that, The rap part is mid and the hook is nice.

**moonagenightmares** (2): probably my least favourite song on this album

**akanewasright** (10): On paper, this is 100% the most basic winner in the rate. This is probably the most iconic song here overall, and it not winning it's original rate is admittedly kind of surprising in hindsight, given Paramore's record of winning every other Emo rate they were in. Honestly, as much as I think this song is an undeniable banger, I was kind of rooting against it at points. Like, I love Paramore, and I love this song, but I wanted a bit more of an exciting winner! And then the 0s started rolling in. And... at some point, it just became funny. Like the first 0 knocked this song down, but if you look at the rank graph, I bet you can't tell where the latter two 0s even happened. I believe this is the first song to win while having four 0s, which... I can't even lie, that's fucking iconic. And it STILL has a 20 point lead on second place, that's fucking remarkable. This song is an eternal banger and deserving winner, slut shaming and all. It absolutely deserves the win if it's so beloved, not even the vocal haters can knock it down.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): So um‚Ä¶ when I sent this to the wheel, I was imagining if, by some small chance, it happened to get in, it would cause a lot of conversation and be a hot ticket elimination when it left at the bottom of the top 10. It‚Äôs a classic sure, but it‚Äôs also pop punk, has a very controversial line, had a whole resurgence in the public eye thanks to good 4 u, and Paramore has a reputation for dominating rates. I naively believed that the odds were stacked against it. However, the power of Hayley Williams has proven too strong once again, overcoming FOUR zero‚Äôs to both block my 11 and an Australian icon from taking the top spot, as well as highly damaging any chances of a full emo 1 rerate. But was it worth it for this absolutely iconic song to get the win it was so robbed of in it‚Äôs original rate, let alone even a place in the first All Stars rate? Yeah, yeah it was. Anyway, make sure to vote for 00‚Äôs Pop Punk this rate cycle!

#the comments just talk about the quality of the song

**bluetriangles04** (11): the way I screamed this when I was younger like WHO PISSED YOU OFF? the girl who sat next to your crush in class??? SHE'S LIKE TEN! I blame my sister for letting me hear this song so young because it has engrained itself into my head ever since and I will never ever not deliver that one line in question without enough venom to leave me breathless after the fact

**dreamingpastel** (11): Peak petty teen rage

**hikk** (11): i usually dgaf and just 11 my own submission bc obv i think i have the best taste ever but here i have no choice but to 11 this, it's THE pop punk classic, the rapid-fire verses and gargantuan chorus are just so insane even 16 years later WE LOVE YOU PARAMORE

**memezaharamole** (11): the jewel of a great discography

**Ambrosia42** (10): i mean it‚Äôs iconic

**babadork** (10): I get that I should like this song less on the basis of feminism, but it‚Äôs too good.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): it‚Äôs a classic idgaf

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.imgur.com/dd7vJZI.png

**jackisboredtoday** (10): this song changed my life when i first started playing guitar hero world tour

**jay** (10): girl the blueprint

**just\_thonking** (10): This will probably win and I will not mind

**kvothetyrion** (10): GREAT karaoke song. And basically the best that pop punk has ever been. So many great vocal riffs, not to mention that unreal double-tracked harmony when Hayley sings ‚Äúso good,‚Äù I love that shit. And then the part at the end when you only have the drums before the guitars come back in. One of those songs that‚Äôs guaranteed to live forever.

**nooodisaster** (10): Middle school me having their mind blown with the song title being "Misery Business" and the first line being "I'm in the business of misery"

**pig-serpent** (10): I get being put off by the lyrics, but musically everything about this song is basically perfect.  The riff is infectious and angry, Haley has an amazing vocal performance, even the drums are always on point.  The bridge that slows down only to immediately build up into that explosive guitar solo, which despite being incredibly simple is such and explosion of anger that it doesn't really matter.  One of the best pop punk songs every written, no doubt.

**pijus41** (10): impossible not to headbang to

**qazz23** (10): Hayley's vocal delivery is very good, love the üé∏ riffing too

**ReallyCreative** (10): we love an obvious winner

**seanderlust** (10): unsuppressable urge to scream along to this one

**Stryxen** (10): smasha (makes me want to smash things)

**throwaway-7650** (10): taylor was actually EXTREMELY problematic in the lyrics for you belong with me because she was not being inclusive to blind people who CANNOT see such as helen keller who talks with her hips

**vayyiqra** (10): I wish to have no more discourse over this song again. By now we surely can agree "yeah that sucks about the lyrics but also she was a teenager and we all know it's a banger"?

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): [cut to footage on me being dragged out of the rates world trade center building screaming about how it should've been aint it fun in the rate instead]

**shadowtheweedhog** (9.4): this song was a capsule of the time and i love reopening the capsule once every like 3 months and getting the good shit

**Wane\_RatrickAgnostic\_Lietoc** (9.1): wow. really impressive mallcore that def pervaded the halls and subconscious of early to mid 10s high school (if not early 10s middle school) with folks I would meet at the lunch tables. really just a solid layup sugar rush. the mathematics add up here more than on their sleepy new post-punk album. hayley williams...you are the most not-anonymous cool pop person ever make a few more bangers like this and update it to where you r NOW. you could save the world

**anothertown** (9): girl like, hourglasses dont tick

**beeozan** (9): used to have a huge childhood crush on Hayley Williams thanks to this mv

**bigbigbee** (9): SO iconic and great, and not even my favorite on Riot! (I love you That‚Äôs What You Get)

**camerinian** (9): look if Hayley is chill with the content now then so am I. I‚Äôm happy having no thoughts of my own anymore, thinking is exhausting

**Frajer** (9): I was a late convert to Paramore during the self titled era so this doesn't make me feral the way it may have as a teenager but it undeniably slaps

**NotWith10000Men** (9): god this goes hard

**Poydoo** (9): I love this song, but the production is not very good the guitars and the drums sound super flat

**shipperondeck** (8.5): when the godlike chrous steals the win from janet </3

**DirtyRat583** (8): mmmmmmmmmmmm oliviaaaaaaaüòªüòª

**frogaranaman** (8): that intro snare hit is CRISPLY put into the mix of this

**jman457** (7.6): all right I‚Äôll give a pass on this emo song

**Adavman** (7): 2023 Paramore is way better than this

**Catrick** (5): I slut dropped and got kicked out of my parents house for alleged infidelity üòî

RandomHypnotica: #the misogyny comments

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This is one of their best songs songs, whore and all

**imbaby122** (11): this song and music video are life changing experiences to any 6 year old. like yeah i hated women for a little bit but in the long run i think this song made me love women more than ever. everyone say thank you to 2000s causal misogyny and hayley willams.

**1998tweety** (10): misogynistic bop

**apatel27** (10): slutshaming is fine if it sounds like this

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): unoriginal ‚Äúthe feminism leaving my body‚Äù joke

**FreeCuddlesAnyone** (10): taking my feminist wig off

**IIIHenryIII** (10): misogyny rocks (I swear this is a joke, but I feel like I need to make that clear cuz I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ well, you can tell by my username)

**jsonphile** (10): look when this song is playing feminism just stops existing for three and a half minutes

**Nagisoid** (10): [shares link to the misogyny but it slaps playlist]

**phonethephoenix** (10): internalized misogyny but it absolutely slaps! soo satisfying to sing.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is a classic idgaf I‚Äôll just turn my brain off for 3 minutes

**ricki** (10): sometimes feminism isnt correct

**runaway3212** (10): The feminist brain could never recover

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Misery Business ü§ù I Write Sins Not Tragedies ü§ù Shake Tramp: the "listen, I don‚Äôt endorse derogatory use of the w-word but I‚Äôll make excuses for this BOP" trifecta of my emo 2000s

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i love being misogynist!

**TragicKingdom1** (10): /u/ImADudeDuh whore

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): To think this whole controversy could have been avoided if Hayley just started singing "A Para-whore, I'm nothing more, I'm sorry that'll never change!"

**vexastrae** (10): MISOGYNY WON!

**starla\_** (9.5): lyrics aged poorly but still an iconic song

**impla77** (9): Hear me out.. jukebox musical with the two leads singing Better Than Revenge/Misery Business respectively??

**sarcasticsobs** (9): Feminist anthem

**slimboyfriend** (9): no slutshaming allowed!! (unless your song also goes this hard)

**welcome2thejam** (8): NOOOOO HAYLEY!! DON'T USE THAT WORD! YOU CAN AVOID YEARS OF DISCOURSE BY JUST USING "BORE" INSTEAD!! HAYLEY NOOOOOO!!!

**moonagenightmares** (6): the internalized misogyny‚Ä¶ and over a MAN?

**thedoctordances1940** (4.8): I just do not get it I really do not like the chorus, it barely gets going before ending and that getting going part sucks. I also don't think I really need to say it hasn't aged very well

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): They stopped playing this because it was slut shaming but they should have actually stopped playing it because it‚Äôs middling.

#y'all really tried to do something here huh

**mysario** (0): ...whoa, stop! Freeze frame! I bet you're wondering how I got down here. Lemme explain; it all started out in 2007 when I saw this music video on MTV2... actually lemme fast forward a bit. 14 years later, "good 4 u" by an indie artist is released and this discourse around one of my favourite songs begin again. The re-emergence of this song in the spotlight after Paramore renounced it in 2018 made it another topic of discussion and made its rounds once more. "Misery Business", almost now being as old as "Smells Like Teen Spirit" was when "Misery Business" came out, becomes a staple at every party, event, and Spotify playlist and continues on and on accompanied by "Misery Business (Olivia's Version)". In 2023, I went to a Karaoke Emo Night where somebody sings with a backing band behind them and it was so fun! For the most part. Almost all of the first 10 songs played were Paramore songs. Obviously. "That's What You Get", "Ain't It Fun", "Crushcrushcrush", "Ignorance", "Emergency", and of course "Misery Business". But I heard the worst singers for each one (actually "Ain't It Fun" was really good), progressively getting worse and worse until we get to "Misery Business". This person carried a note like they were carrying a boulder. All this to say I stan Paramore but I feel ya Hayley, this song is soured for me and I'm sick of hearing it. It's become a "skip" for me on the album. If it was "Ain't It Fun" here, now THAT would be an 11! Alas the wheel is cruel. Now let's catch up to present day. Ahh, that's right! The angry mob...

**OliviaGodrigo** (0): on women‚Äôs history month?

**Raindrac** (0): Although Misery Business is pretty fun, and I understand the appeal of it, it's not anywhere near fun enough to make up for how problematic the lyrics on this song are. And it's not just the slut-shaming or the use of the word "whore" that I'm concerned about here; that's only part of the problem. Misery Business is rotten to its core, a celebration of bringing more misery to a woman who's already suffering enough in the aftermath of a breakup. And I cannot express how much I hate the attitude of "second chances, they don't ever matter, people never change", a line that I despise to my core because of how commonplace that toxic mindset is in our culture. 

Seriously, don't get me wrong; I'm willing to give a pass for problematic lyrics in contexts where they're not causing harm. I've listened to plenty of extreme metal with subjects more disturbing than a teenager being an asshole, ranging from murder to cannibalism. But we know what we're getting into, and nobody is going to go out and murder someone just because they listened to an extreme metal song. Misery Business is a pop punk song marketed towards impressionable teenagers, and with an audience as large and impressionable as that, it's more than likely that this song has contributed to the promotion of misogyny and broader toxic behavior. That's a real-world influence, not something that remains within the realm of fantasy. 

I'm good at brushing aside awful lyrics, so I don't deny I've bopped to Misery Business before. You can't take it too seriously these days, especially because most people know better now. But I haven't enjoyed it enough for me to just brush aside the problems with the legacy it left, and I doubt I ever will.

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congrats to **Misery Business** for winning the rate! Across all rates it places 597th overall. It ties in score with Flume's Never Be Like You (ft. kai). It places just above Kanye West's Street Lights and Tyler, The Creator's Who Dat Boy (ft. A$AP Rocky). Funny enough it still has some trouble against old demons as it sits one place (and also 0.001 points) below Fall Out Boy's Dance Dance from the first emo rate (which placed 3rd originally vs. Misery Business's 4th)

* Misery Business not only becomes the first song to win with more than 2 0's, but the first song to win with more than 3!


**Song Stats**

* Closer now joins Rolling in the Deep in the lead for most times rated with 6 each!
 * Closer has been rated at least once in each Winners' cycle with Winners 1 (2016 EP), Winners 2 (Pop Girl/EDM, AS3, Billboard 2010s Decade End), Winners 3 (AS4), and Winners 4 (Ratrick's). (In case you're wondering it won none of them)
 * On the other end, Rolling in the Deep had all 6 of its ratings happen within the first 100 rates (owing to a lot of Billboard appearances with Year End 2012, Year End #1s, Song of the Year, and 2010s Decade End. Its only non-Billboard rates are 21's album rate with Amy Winehouse & Lily Allen and the first Winners Rate)
* We have multiple controversy leaderboard entries this rate with 4'33 (4th highest), Closer (11th), and Where's My Juul? (15th)
 * Knocked off the list is So Am I [All Stars 6], 9 (After Coachella), and Blurred Lines. (Though So Am I still has its original rate entry on the list in 25th)
* Where's My Juul becomes the only song on the top 25 most controversial leaderboard to get a score over 7+
 * In fact, it's the only song in the top 50 most controversial to have a score over 7+
 * Previously the most controversial song to score above a 7 was Mii Channel Theme in Winners 2
* As with any meta rate, most songs ended up scoring lower than their first outing. The few exceptions
 * 4'33, despite coming last this time, gets a noticable boost in score (the highest in the rate!)
 * In a fitting thematic scenario, Misery Business redeemed itself and also rose in score from its first rate
 * Good Look For You, DONTTRUSTME, Hi High, Rough, 2ON, Confide in Me all saw increases too
 * Closer gets an asterisk here, as it outscored AS4 Closer but was beaten by the rest
* The biggest loser of the rate was none other than my own submission, Boulevard of Broken Dreams! It fell 1.566 from the first time we rated it, closely followed by Pluto and then Glamorous
* User Raindrac becomes the only user to have their 11 come in last and their 0 win a rate

## Artists

Since we have so many changes we're getting the shortened version for today! No new entries to the artist leaderboard either (rankings out of 358)

**Artist Stats**

* With Misery Business, Paramore picks up their 3rd rate win! They are now tied for 6th with Carly, Janelle, Whitney, and Mariah
* With Britney picking up her 18th rate appearance she is no longer tied with Kesha and Katy in 10th, knocking them off the list
 * Rihanna moves up to a 4-way tie for 2nd most with Charli, Taylor, and Nicki at 21 appearances each
* No major shifts in the most songs rated list, but CHVRCHES is sitting just under the list now in 26th. If they had one more rating somewhere they'd be on the list and tied with Fall Out Boy for 25th. 
* Halsey now has overtaken Katy Perry on the most 0's leaderboard, going from 3rd to 2nd with 146. Fun fact: if you rearrange those digits to a much bigger number you could have her catch up to Taylor Swift in 1st! (with 416)

## Rates

* With 111/112 11's used, St. Ratrick's Day takes 8th place for the highest 11's used by percent! Other than the 6 rates with 100% of 11's used, it's only beaten by one other rate (Winners 2 which had 154/155)
*  With 33/40 songs picking up at least one 11, Ratrick's also takes 6th place for highest 11 spread at 82.50%! 
 * The missing 11 songs were 2ON, Glamorous, Exclusively, Mama, Dancing Crazy, Dance!, and Closer (for the first time ever)
