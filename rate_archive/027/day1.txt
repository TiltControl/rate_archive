90s Personal Masterpieces Rate: Ray of Light vs The Velvet Rope vs Butterfly - Day 1 - Quicker than a Ray of Light...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/77lybm/90s_personal_masterpieces_rate_ray_of_light_vs/

##[**WELCOME EVERYONE!**](https://i.imgur.com/WwJIslu.jpg)

Today we will be beginning Day 1 of the 90s Personal Masterpieces Rate, hosted by me and /u/joshually!

Some quick stats:

- The reveal will start at **7PM EST**
- 44 people participated, much more than I anticipated so thank you all who voted!
- The average score for the entire rate was **7.8416**
- The average controversy score was **1.8433**
- We may or may not be hosting the plug.dj room... I've been so busy getting everything together I haven't even thought about this at all... oops. :P Maybe /u/joshually has it all planned?
- Remember, you can be messy and funny (that's what makes our rates so much fun) but keep things respectful and please no stan wars, we're here to celebrate three wonderful albums by three legendary women who are all deserving to win this rate.
- I have also used some fanmade graphics for each of the songs, so I have to stress that I didn't make these, I just thought they would look really nice for the reveals. If anyone has a problem with them being posted on here, I'll remove them as soon as possible, and my apologies.
- Today we will revealing songs from #44 through to #31. Day 2 will be #30 through to 16, and The final 15 for Day 3!

pretendstobeshocked.gif Yeah I think we all saw this one coming. Sadly suffering the same fate as its sister song, Cyber-Raga from the Music/Fever/In The Zone rate, Madonna’s first of two forays into singing in Sanskrit is the first to leave. The production is easily the best part about this song, blending electronica with (forgive me if this is incorrect) a Bollywood number makes this pretty enjoyable sonically, but it does go on for too long and should’ve been more like an intermission leading into the second half of the album, rather than a full length song. Still, I don’t mind it at all.
 
---
**joshually**: "I honestly wish I had gotten into yoga the same time Madonna did… imagine how much more bendy and flexible I would be now…. And bring all the boys to my yard"
 
**MrSwearword**: "Cyberraga did it better. NEXT."
 
**Saucymac**: "- I don't know whats happening in this song but i'm cool with it"
 
**mokitsu**: "honestly who thought this was a good idea...?"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Okay I did not like this song at all. It was just plain and the guitar did not fit in with this."
 
**zamomattel**: "The worst song on the album, manily because it's kind of inaccessible"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "It’s got a little bit of curry in it. (Seriously though, a fun to listen to song, props to Madonna for learning these lyrics and paying attention to the pronunciation.)"
 
**therokinrolla**: "what"
 
**Banananaise**: "it's crazy how she put the effort into learning the whole thing in sanskrit"
 
**awryj**: "The intro sounds exactly the same as Colin McRae Rally 2.0 menu theme and I got hit by nostalgia"
 
**VeganSquash**: "I LOVE how this serves a interlude type-thing"
 
**skargardin**: "What I could gather from the translation was a lot of religious imagery about peace, worship and such but most of it went completely over my head (am I just stupid?). Otherwise I enjoyed the track quite a bit."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "This one... i like this the least - as someone with an understanding of Sanskrit, her pronunciation is horrible and that ruins the entire song for me."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "I'm going to help this one's poor soul a bit because everybody is going to waste a 0 here since it's in Sanskrit. The xenophobia is real. Truth to be told, it deserves a 7, but I like to think of this one as an interlude instead of a full track, and I gave Intro a 8. No way in hell is Intro better than this. I think George Harrison did the Hindu chanting thing a bit better, but this one is adequately euphoric (oh, no, what have I done?)"
 
**jess_22**: "i genuinely don't know what to make of this..."
 
**Kaylaboe**: "invented sanskrit"
 
**Jelboo**: "Dis some spiritual energy type of summoning shit"
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I am really mixed with this song. This is straight up cultural appropriation but on the other hand, this is also a bop. I am going to cut some slack off because back in the 90s, people didn't even know what cultural appropriation is and I didn't know about it either. I am just going to remind everyone that this exists."
 
**jackcs903**: "Definitely different, and a good intermission of the album in a way"
 
**jamesfog**: "Ashanti/Anghami"
 
**LandoFreeman**: "She tried it lol"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "What is this This is definitely a candidate for my 0"
 
**rickikardashian**: "this goes AWFFFF, but I honestly feel bad twerking to the things my yoga instructor said"
 
**nooodisaster**: "I feel like opponents of cultural appropriation are kinda talking about things like this. Madonna takes an ancient prayer, turns it into a pop song for her millions selling record, and then discards all reference by her next era not two years later. Beyond the politics though, it's just a very average song."

I understand it doesn’t compare to the original, but I absolutely adore this cover. It does take a while to really get going, but the final 2:30 minutes of this are just heavenly. Mariah belts out some of her best adlibs on here, imo.

**MrSwearword**: "this offends my soul"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "this is my favorite Prince song so i'm just wary of ANYONE covering it"
 
**TragicKingdom1**: "Too long and plodding, plus Dru Hill doesn't contribute anything. Also I didn't realize Sisqo was part of Dru Hill until now."
 
**mokitsu**: "i feel like this is kinda hated in general but i loove it. everything is so dragged out and beautiful and classy and golden."
 
**gaymike219905**: "I love this cover so much, not much is changed from the original, but Mariah And Dru's vocals are beautiful together."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Mariah is one of The Beautiful Ones, she’s a skinny queen after all! THOSE SCREAM NOTES THOUGH"
 
**zamomattel**: "I love Mariah but I really didn't need or ask for this cover"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "Eh, this one just doesn’t do it for me. It’s just a little bit too long, they could have cut out quite a bit of this to make a tighter track. Like, there’s a certain point where I just think “why are they still singing exactly?”"
 
**therokinrolla**: "omg tha synths. That was unexpected!"
 
**awryj**: "THONG THO THONG THONG THOOONG"
 
**VeganSquash**: "it was okay..."
 
**skargardin**: "Dragged a tad bit towards the end."
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "I debated long and hard over which Mariah Carey album filler to tank with my 0, however after looking back at how long this track is, this had to get my 0. 7 whole minutes of Mariah Carey on just one filler song?! Mariah please think of the children!"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "Okay, that's a half point for the length, but this was originally a Prince ballad, after all. You'd expect it to be almost five minutes, at least. Mariah and Dru Hill's voices are epic together and the latter suspiciously sounds like Prince himself, if I'm going to be honest. This is going to go out on Day 1, because the rest of the record is too good, but it's an amazing penultimate track and I'll stand by that statement."
 
**jess_22**: "what justifies this being 7 minutes long? It takes way too long to build up to anything interesting and Dru Hill's vocals are annoying"
 
**rsmitty99**: "People don't like this cover. I actually think it works. It's a softer take on Prince's overlooked jam on Purple Rain. That may be the issue people have with it. It doesn't go as hard as Prince's original version. But I like it"
 
**Jelboo**: "What did they do to this song? Prince didn't just do it better - he's the only one who should have been allowed to do it."
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Damn, this song is really long......"
 
**jackcs903**: "Another song that manages to always put me in a better mood"
 
**omgcow**: "Honestly the only dud on the album..... Prince shouldn't be covered, even by the queen"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "I don’t know I don’t think it’s good and really could it be any longer"
 
**rickikardashian**: "the piano(?) in the background sounds like a perfect beat to demo for a rap song. The rest of the song is a bit meh"
 
**nooodisaster**: "Beautiful people are cunts, but you don't need to make a seven minute song about it Mariah."

And the first bonus track falls. It’s very twee and way too children’s choir for a dark album (even though Special kind of gets away with it, but God’s Stepchild doesn’t fit on the album in the same way Special does), still Janet has some gorgeous vocals here.
 
---
**joshually**: "Hokey lyrics aside, the message of this song could definitely help youngsters who feel lonely and forlorn and depressed. If you're reading this and you think you're alone - YOU ARE NOT. There are millions of us here who can relate to what you are feeling and going through, and remember, as bad as it may seem, it will ALWAYS get better, so hold on, boo! <3"
 
**MrSwearword**: "nope. Simply put, NOPE."
 
**MariahGr8rThnJesus**: "OMG I NEVER HEARD THIS B4 TY"
 
**JunkyGS**: "A beautiful song about finally accepting yourself and finding that you belong after feeling so rejected and like an outside to everybody."
 
**TragicKingdom1**: "Very American Idol but Janet's voice works well for that type of music."
 
**mokitsu**: "another boring ballad..."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "A great track, nothing much more to say really."
 
**zamomattel**: "Janet's Act my Age /s but seriously I think this is nice and it sounds like Mariah"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "This song sounds a lot like the title song from Sister Act: The Musical and I know the timeline doesn’t exactly line up but I think maybe that song might be paying homage to this one? I like that song better."
 
**awryj**: "Interesting message, but it sounds like an end credits song"
 
**VeganSquash**: "its like a Katy Perry song but good"
 
**stardustanddinos**: "yo why was this not on the main album? this could have been an amazing closer. could have replaced "Every Time" :eyes:"
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "God forgives all of his children, but I don't think even he could forgive someone responsible for a track this horrendous."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "Okay, I should probably give this a lower score, because it's WAY too similar to Everytime and Again. But Janet sings this with passion that's a bit hard to see in the previous two, and despite how much my parents used religious shit to abuse me I still relate to this. So, yeah, guilty pleasure. This is my favorite bonus track, probably."
 
**jess_22**: "even though I just listened to this I don't remember anything about it"
 
**Jelboo**: "This is a pretty song. You almost never hear Janet sing like this anymore."

Aw, I don’t think this deserved to be out so early. It definitely was one of the few songs on Ray of Light that did not click with me at first listen, but it does grow on you. I love how warm and inviting the tone of the song feels, in a generally cold-feeling, watery imaged album. Madonna’s vocals here are so seductive, you can feel her smile coming through while she’s singing here. It’s one of the more guitar laden songs on the album, but it keeps things interesting with the occasional blips and sputters of electronic sounds throughout, even if the final thing you hear before the song ends sounds like a wet fart. :/

**mokitsu**: "one of the weaker tracks here, although i love the guitar near the end"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "This gives me Rock Candy vibes and I hate that song so much"
 
**zamomattel**: "Works so well after Ray of Light"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "I’m not entirely sure what Madonna is going for on this track. It’s confusing and kind of not anything. It’s not bad, but also it’s not fun, it’s not sexy, it’s not sad, it’s not provocative, it’s just kind of a weirdly titled song with weird lyrics that’s not super musically distinct from the rest of the album. I was just looking more for a song like “Candyman” or “Babygirl.” So I ran into the issue of “am I rating this song for what it is or against what I wanted it to be” and honestly it came up short on both accounts."
 
**therokinrolla**: "I never really got this song like i did the others. It still sounds very gorgeous, but it doesn’t feel as painstakingly crafted and melodically excellent as the rest of the album. But still really pretty. I like, not love."
 
**awryj**: "It was a bit boring, except for the intro and the bit in the middle when it's only the synths and then BLAM MADONNA. Other than that it sounds like generic '90s trip-hop, which, of course, isn't necessarily bad."
 
**VeganSquash**: "weakest of the album imo. Its a bit weird and wtf is a Candy Perfume Girl lol."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "queen of grunge electronica"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is usually a decently scored song when it comes to rating Ray of Light, but it's not mourned for very much whenever it goes out, probably because of the common opinion that it doesn't fit in absolutely perfectly with the rest of the album. I won't deny that this is one of this album's less crucial songs, but by no means would I call it the worst. The imagery of the first verse is fantastic ('young velvet porcelain boy') and the continuing refrain of 'did I lie to you?' Is another welcomed emotional punch in the gut. So, yes, I won't be devastated if this is one of the last songs to go out on Day 1, but I'll be a bit angry if it ends up getting a average below 7."

I guess it was inevitable to go out early, but goddamn it people this song is stunning! Some of you didn’t seem to get how it works so perfectly coming after What About. It’s all about Janet feeling scared and unsure of finding new love after being damaged by her past relationship with an abusive man, but she just can’t help but fall in love with her new partner. It’s so calming. My favourite Janet ballad for sure.
 
---
**joshually**: "I consider this a poor man's "Again" but I feel like you'd have to be a big Janet fan to even know or care about that notion."
 
**MrSwearword**: "you mean after all this fabulous genre-hopping, this album has a sappy, awful, drippy ballad? Gurl BYE."
 
**Saucymac**: "- sorry i just can't feel it. It feels like it belongs in some b grade movie from 1992"
 
**JunkyGS**: "This song is about the apprehension Janet faces when entering a new relationship after getting out of an abusive one and being hurt again or it failing. It is a very calming and uplifting ballad."
 
**mokitsu**: "sorry janet but this is soooo boring....."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Janet doesn’t want to fall for in love again. This is a sweet little piano ballad that changes up the pace of the album and it works really well."
 
**zamomattel**: "expert in balladry, I love it so much"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "This is a very sweet song, it’s nice to hear Janet doing a straight up ballad and she still gives it that attention to detail she gives her more “soundscape” songs. My biggest issue with it is that it’s such a jarring transition out of “What About…” It makes sense but there should have been an interlude to break the two up because I actually jumped when the shift happened."
 
**therokinrolla**: "wow this is boring"
 
**Banananaise**: "cause every time (sigh)... my ears hate this song"
 
**awryj**: "Bronty did it better"
 
**VeganSquash**: "meh, her vocals are strong, but this song isn't good"
 
**skargardin**: "Really cute ballad."
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "But every time this song comes near / And every time I'm filled with fear / 'Cause every time I hear this song / My mouth does begin to outcry 'delete it fat'"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "My main problem with the last third or so of all of Janet's albums is that she randomly just decides to put her ballads at the end of her tracklist. Fortunately, this isn't that much of a problem with Velvet Rope, but, IDK, despite how pleasant this song is sonically Britney's track of a similar title still leaves more of an impression on me. That being said, if I had to listen to any of Janet's ballads I'd pick this one without hesitation."
 
**jess_22**: "a nice ballad, there's something really relaxing about this"
 
**Jelboo**: "Memories of early 80's Janet"
 
**jamesfog**: "We love a BALLAD!"
 
**LandoFreeman**: "The only song on this album I dislike"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "Another song that’s absolutely held back by Janet’s voice. The melody is gorgeous and the lyrics are great... but I feel like it would really benefit from a stronger vocalist and that just makes me sad cause as I get through this album it’s clear how much talent Janet Jackson actually is in every area except her singing abilities. I guess she wasn’t meant to be unstoppable"
 
**rickikardashian**: "This sounds like something else but I DONT KNOW WHAT FUCK"
 
**nooodisaster**: "A really sweet innocent song. You can really feel the trepidation in her voice before it explodes into optimism in the chorus."

One of the slowest songs on the album, and while it’s smooth as butter and definitely a great chill out track, it doesn’t go anywhere and I can see why most people think it’s one of the weakest on The Velvet Rope.
 
---
**joshually**: "Probably my least favorite song on the album. It's taken me THE LONGEST to get into it. Now I appreciate the production value, but on an album of complex and challenging songs, this one just felt… too simple for me"
 
**MrSwearword**: "the beat and vocal performance don’t quite jibe that well but still consistent for TVR."
 
**JunkyGS**: "Janet continues her exploration of her own sexuality and being so into somebody you’d do anything to please them. Janet when asked about this song said, "Some people are into pleasing others, some are into being pleased, and some into both.

You're willing to take it further than you've ever taken it before.""
 
**mokitsu**: "kinda filler-ish"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Janet wants everyone to taste her. Okay I see you."
 
**zamomattel**: "This literally doesn't go ANYWHERE"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "Probably the weakest link on the album for me. I totally understand what it’s going for by having Janet duet with the playback, but it leaves it feeling like it’s only half of a song. The instrumental feels kind of underdeveloped too."
 
**therokinrolla**: "sensual"
 
**awryj**: "This song helped me focus on my physics homework, thanks Janet"
 
**VeganSquash**: "not feeling this"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "Not as boring as the ballads she stuck at the end of her last two albums, but it's still pretty eh. This isn't placid enough to earn a 0, though, which is relieving. I wouldn't want to lower my album average for her..."

**Jelboo**: "At this point the listener becomes a bit oversaturated by all the sex jams. Still good tho!"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "The hand claps at the beginning had me hopeful for like 10 seconds"
 
**nooodisaster**: "In the winter of my junior year of college, I was really lonely. I spent a good amount of my time lying in bed in the dark, daydreaming about belonging to someone I didn't have. This song was one of the songs I'd replay during that time, and as such I have really mixed emotions towards it. The background noise of a thunderstorm really grounds the song in dreams, and most of the song seems gentle, romantic even. But then you hear Janet's voice repeating "anything" over and over, getting more and more desperate each time. And I remember those endless nights weren't a good place to be in, and offering yourself completely in hope of love isn't romantic. The interlude "Sad" directly following makes me think, at least, that these complexities were intentional."

joshually: > /u/nooodisaster: "In the winter of my junior year of college, I was really lonely. I spent a good amount of my time lying in bed in the dark, daydreaming about belonging to someone I didn't have. This song was one of the songs I'd replay during that time, and as such I have really mixed emotions towards it. The background noise of a thunderstorm really grounds the song in dreams, and most of the song seems gentle, romantic even. But then you hear Janet's voice repeating "anything" over and over, getting more and more desperate each time. And I remember those endless nights weren't a good place to be in, and offering yourself completely in hope of love isn't romantic. The interlude "Sad" directly following makes me think, at least, that these complexities were intentional."

You guys did this one wrong. The Japanese bonus track to Ray of Light, this track serves as that edition’s closing track, instead of Mer Girl. In a way, this feels like one of the secret endings in a video game which tell the true ending of the game, which has to be unlocked following certain requirements. This feels like a direct follow up to Mer Girl, where it ended the album on a very dark, sombre note, leaving listeners in the dark on where Madonna stood with her outlook on life, Has to Be brings in a ray of light (hehe) and assuring hope that Madonna has moved past her troubles and looking forward to the future. “I know there’s someone out there, there has to be” seems to directly reference her husband at the time, Guy Ritchie. The production on this is simply beautiful and the hushed vocals from Madge tie the song all together. It’s a great “true” ending to the album.

**Elitefourbrad**: "Meh, this could be better by Madonna standards."
 
**zamomattel**: "Kind of dreary but pretty otherwise"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "“Breathe in, breathe out, I say a little prayer” How cool of Madonna to reference both Hilary Duff’s amazing 2015 album Breathe In. Breathe Out. AND the iconic Dionne Warwick song! I don’t know if it was a wise choice though because I would rather listen to both of those than this song, which is quite boring. Not bad, but boring."
 
**therokinrolla**: "damn. I really connect to this. I heard this for the first time just now, and i dont know if she is talking about a soulmate or a god, but god, i understand madonna. I understand."
 
**awryj**: "Very soothing, the production makes the song tbh"

**BiPolarBear17**: "If you listen to this and straight afterwards don't feel like Mahatma Gandhi about to drop his spiciest, most soulful mix-tape yet then you ain't got a soul. This track is ethereal and I'll forever be salty that this was left for just bonus-track status. I know how important Little Star is to her, and how sure she was on having only 13 tracks, but gosh dingily darn it this so should have been on the main album instead of Little Star :fish2:"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "Hmm, I actually learned this existed only about a few months ago, and this is my first time listening to it. I was a bit bored at first, especially since the clicks during the first two minutes or so seemed too lazy. I tried looking for a better version, and I finally got some of this one's appeal, but something about it seems...too ambivalent, too in the middle. The emotion Madonna expresses throughout Ray of Light is the very thing that makes it a great album, and Has To Be just doesn't have enough of it. Some parts of it are very beautiful, but those parts aren't very Madonna."
 
**jess_22**: "meh, this doesn't really go anywhere"
 
**Jelboo**: "How have I never heard this? What a pearl of a song!"
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Apparently, this song was supposed to be included in the album but Madonna learned that in the Kabbalah, the number 13 is a lucky number so she had to remove one song from the album. Tbh, this song should have replaced 'To Have and Not to Hold'."
 
**jamesfog**: "Good? Yes. Boring? Yes."
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "This might actually put me to sleep"
 
**nooodisaster**: "Can see why this is relegated to a bonus track. The lyrics are actually really poignant (and relatable, omg), but the production is so simple it borders on annoying."

Aw man I knew it would go out early but it didn’t deserve this (at least it managed a 7+ average so I’m happy about that). This song is so haunting and in contrast with the song that opens the album, it ends the ~~standard~~ album on a dark note after the album opens with it feeling Madonna has everything figured out and ready to start life with a new outlook. The song is about her Madonna’s deceased mother, and the memories of her during her childhood before she passed away upon discovering her grave. It’s very minimalistic, but also very creepy as the song goes on. The final 15 seconds always leave me speechless.
 
---
**joshually**: "One of the most heartbreaking song ever recorded by Madonna :-("
 
**MrSwearword**: "so weird but it’s so right"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "i ran and i ran/i'm still running away"
 
**TragicKingdom1**: "sorry but this bored me"
 
**mokitsu**: "verges on boring"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "A great relaxing song, not much else to say though."
 
**zamomattel**: "So poignant, beautiful closer"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "I mentioned this song to a friend and she looked it up and said that Madonna was trying “to pull a Kate Bush.” Make of that what you will. Personally I’m not entirely sure what to make of this track, it’s an intriguing one. We’ve had a running theme of water throughout the album, especially as a healing/cleansing presence, but I’m not entirely sure why this song is called “Mer Girl.” I know it’s about the death of Madonna’s mother because I did my research, but I’m not entirely sure how. Still, judging it on what it is, it’s an amazingly atmospheric track that straddles the line between calm and creepy."
 
**therokinrolla**: "Simple, but effective. Incredibly fucking effective. A song for her passed mom, explaining how confining it makes her. Confined. And yet at the same time she is running. She is running from the departure of her mom. I cant put this songs into words honestly, hence the super awkward comment that this is lol. But the imagery at work and the simple instrumentation seriously push this song as the most depressing on the album. It finishes out her story very well. She ran and she ran from her mothers pass. And even as she released this album, she is “still running away.” A chilling final line. Excellence."
 
**awryj**: "Scary and beautiful. A strong contender for my 11."
 
**skargardin**: "The lyrics are so complex and personal."
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "It's a shame that this is probably gonna be a day 1 elimination when it's an absolutely stunning track, which delves into the death of her mother. ROL is jam-packed with so many interesting things going on throughout each track, however Mer Girl instead feels much more stripped back in comparison, making it feel more meaningful and sincere. The last 30 seconds of this track are phenomenal, and the final lyrics 'I ran and I ran / I'm still running away' are a perfect, haunting finish to the album. The album focuses more on spirituality and motherhood, rather than sexuality or her wild, celebrity lifestyle, which gives the impression of her living this care-free, cozy quiet life now. However this line reminds you that Madonna still has her demons, she didn't live a perfect life in the past and her life isn't perfect now either. She might have started a new chapter in her life but she's still the same girl that she always has been."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "An unlikely candidate for some of Madonna's best vocals of all time, Ray of Light's closing song ends not with the sadness or joy that act as opposite sides of Madonna's muse throughout the album, but with fright and unsettling imagery. Apparently there was an eery silence after Madonna finished recording this song. That silence is easily reenacted. The death of her mother more or less ended up starting the artistic revolution she underwent in the late 80s to the early 00s, and Mer Girl is, in all its creepiness, a fitting tribute to that."
 
**jess_22**: "jesus this is dark"
 
**Jelboo**: "Very subdued. Not the strongest song on the album - but what does that mean on an album as legendary as this one?!"
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "And this is how you fucking close an album masterpiece. This is one of Madonna's best songs in terms of songwriting because it's so poetic and cinematic."
 
**jackcs903**: "Another really interesting song from the album, but it's very relaxing"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "How is a Witness reject the album closer I’ve never been so disappointed"
 
**nooodisaster**: "Every time I listen to this song I nearly get a panic attack. And for this song, that's a very very good thing. For an album so much about optimism and spiritual awakening, this ending is an insane 180. Nothing is resolved here, and there's a sense of foreboding from the very first of the creeping beats, to the just-to-long pauses between verses, all the way to the demented imagery this album leaves us with. Perhaps it's a hint that the serene enlightenment of this era could never last. She ran to it, but she's still running away."

Definitely my least favourite off the album aside from Shanti/Ashtangi. It sounds nice, and almost serves as a bridging song from Drowned World to Ray of Light, but it kinda plods along a bit. Also, the “students rape their teachers” lyric just comes out of left field and feels out of place, this is the only time Madonna talks about social topics on the whole album which is meant to be about her and it just feels forced. She’s done better socially conscious songs.
 
---
**joshually**: "her voice is I M P E C C A B L E on this song. Flawless and full, like me after 2 hours in a vegas buffet."
 
**MrSwearword**: "Consciousdonna done wrong is just self-righteous drivel"
 
**mokitsu**: "woke pop done right"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Queen of swimming in the ocean."
 
**zamomattel**: "Michael Phelps could never"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "It’s weird, this song has two verses at four lines each, and then the rest of this song is chorus and instrumental. But both verses are about how terrible the world is getting. Like, that’s the most casual mention of child on child crime that I’ve ever heard in a song. However, it is perhaps the only mention of child on child crime that I have ever heard in a song, so points for that. I just kind of wish that there were a bit more to the lyrics, the ones that are there are great, there just aren’t that many of them. I really do like the message and vibe of this song, it’s sort of a laid back self-care anthem about escaping from the horrors of the world and cleansing ourselves when we can’t bear the weight of the world anymore."
 
**therokinrolla**: "there is something so delightful in this song, just being those wubbing synths. Of course, it isnt really a happy song with its references to rape, burning preachers, and child killing. But its something freeing almost. Its another song about her religion, its as if this song is a realization for madonna. She puts plainly everything she’s seeing and how it led her to where it is now, all in front of the sonic backdrop of synths and an eargasmic guitar. Slay me madge"
 
**Banananaise**: "the story behind this might be sad but idc, the song is boring"
 
**VeganSquash**: "not a bad song, but lyrics a bit weird"
 
**skargardin**: "The production is very.. aquatic in a sense. I like it."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "makes me feel like i'm at a beach, one of my favorites in the album"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "I've always thought that this was one of the poppier, more accessible songs on Ray of Light, and while it may be a little less stunning at first listen than some other parts of the album it's still a nearly perfect bridge between being a bop and being peak experimental Madonna. When she sings the chorus, specifically the part that goes 'we're gonna swim to the ocean floor', I can't help but visualise an entire ocean in my mind, crashing at my feet."
 
**jess_22**: "the production is interesting but that's about it"
 
**Jelboo**: "Relaxed, soulful, atmospheric."
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "I love the water imagery in this song. Reminds me a lot of Taylor Swift's Clean which deals with similiar themes of cleansing yourself."
 
**nooodisaster**: "Builds up the water theme, but seems like filler. It's very "generic self empowerment song" and there's way more interesting production elsewhere on the album."

This used to be my least favourite song on the album, but I’ve warmed up to it recently. It makes perfect sense for this to close the album, Janet has found the light at the end of the tunnel after a dark and treacherous journey through her conscious and now reflects on what she and others can do to achieve happiness and strong spiritual wellbeing, and how she probably still has more work/healing to do, hence the “work in progress” being the final line.
 
---
**joshually**: "I can't decide if the lyrics make me happy or sad. The fact that she starts the song "hey J…" makes me imagine she could be singing to me, and it makes the song even more poignant and relatable (not to mention the lyrics about a difficult childhood)"
 
**MrSwearword**: "GET YOUR MEDIOCRE BALLAD OUT OF MY GENRE-HOPPING SEX ALBUM"
 
**JunkyGS**: "Special summarizes the need to feel special and ends the album on the most introspective song about giving love to that inner child inside all of us, who may have been neglected or abused. Janet talks about needing to deal with the past to live completely free in the present. The song is about the pain you experience not being permanent and that it can be transformed with love."
 
**mokitsu**: "yasss take to me to church queen"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Okay Janet I love you, but I could not stand the beat in this song."
 
**zamomattel**: "This reminds me of Can I Get An Amen"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "The aborted ending of this song knocks this song down from an 11 to a 10. Like, I totally understand what she was going for and I admire it, but let me live the fantasy girl! Yes we’re all works in progress but let me have these four minutes Janet. Just four complete minutes, that’s all I ask. Other than that ending it’s a beautiful song, sure it’s intentionally kinda schmaltzy with that children’s choir but I really like it."

Not my favourite song on the album by any means so I’m not mad it’s out early, but it’s still nice. There’s a slight Latin influence on this track, no?
 
---
**joshually**: "Not one of my fave songs on the albums, with apologies to /u/yorjyefferson … it’s a gorgeous song, for sure but on an album full of stellar songs, this isn’t in the top percentile"
 
**MrSwearword**: "this song gave me a headache. Kill it with fire"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "another ROL track in my top 3 M songs of all time! the delicate vibe and the drama and pain in the lyrics/delivery makes it one of her finest moments tbh"
 
**mokitsu**: "this is my favorite song of the album i think. the production is soooo good and i love the muted chorus"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "This is such a relaxing song, I’d listen to this while meditating or doing yoga or something. Madonna’s voice is so pleasant on this album tbh."
 
**zamomattel**: "Sad and stunning, not as accessible as some others though"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "That “buh buh duh buh buh” is so much fun to sing along with. The Indian influences on “Shanti/Ashtangi” made perfect sense but I’m not quite sure why they’re showing up here."
 
**therokinrolla**: "The production here is really lovely, even though the song itself doesnt shine as heavily as the others. However, its still a real gut punch."
 
**skargardin**: "Another spiritual mid-tempo song that kind of blends into the mix. This one’s among the weakest tracks on the album."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "One of the most underrated songs on Ray of Light, this gradually turned from 'good, but forgettable to some of the other songs' to 'what a bop!'. The chorus makes me think of a musical, but in a different way that Sky Fits Heaven does; it makes me think of a song Madonna's set to sing after a fight with somebody, while she summons magical spirits who sing the 'ba ba ba ba da da' part while she destroys the furniture with her magic. What am I typing? This is almost certainly going to go out on Day 1 and I'll kill you all for it."
 
**jess_22**: "this song is decent but definitely forgettable"
 
**Jelboo**: "Rhythmic, mysterious, entrancing."
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Invented elevator music. On a serious note, this is my least favorite song on the album but I wouldn't call this a filler. I just wish there is something more to this song because it feels lacking."
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "So this is where my attention started to wander it’s not a bad song at all but how many songs over 5 minutes does one album need if it was like half as long I think I would’ve enjoyed it a lot more"
 
**nooodisaster**: "This is making me sleepy."

YorjYefferson: I found this post because joshually knows me so well, and summoned me over here from my cavern. It would be hard for me to pick the Madonna song I would say is my all-time favorite, I'm a big Madonna stan but this one always ranks highly when I try to make a list. And I've never been able to explain it in words, it just sends me into this almost trance-like state and I sort of weave my head, then it spreads to my body? I love how quiet the song is, it makes the beats register that much more inside me. And her voice, I already think ROL is her best album because of how she took voice lessons for her role in Evita and they hadn't worn off yet. But the way she understatedly sings this song is as close to perfection as I think I've ever heard her sound.

I’m pretty shocked and a bit confused on how this did so well? It’s nice but I just find it ultimately unnecessary (especially compared to the likes of Has to Be which felt like proper extension of its parent album yet was kicked out really early). The vocals are nice, but Mariah doesn’t come close to hitting the highs she does in the English version. I guess with the strong Latin influence she felt she needed to sing a Spanish version of this as well. Only song in the entire rate I feel is way too high.
 
---
**joshually**: "I feel like we just included this so people could make fun of her masterful Spanish pronunciation…."
 
**MrSwearword**: "no es magnifico pero su voz es muy rica. Su español es muy bien"
 
**tevinterimperium**: "Bilingual legend! Shanti/Ashtangi is shook."

This is a song about Madonna’s then new born daughter, Lourdes/Lola/whatever she goes by these days. The lyrics are a bit like a lullaby, which is probably this song’s intention, but for me the real star of the song is production. It’s exciting yet calming to listen to with its shimmery synths and blips. I love it when Madge whispers “little star” towards the end, as she hushes us to sleep before the nightmare that is Mer Girl.

**zamomattel**: "imagine Madonna being your mum, wild"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "It bugs me that she takes a breath before singing “little star” during the chorus because it’s really weird phrasing. On the whole though, this was one of my favorite tracks from the album. One of the few truly cheerful songs on the album, you really feel how much she loves her daughter. I love the instrumental as well, that violin does a lot to bring fresh energy to the track, the morose electronica was starting to wear on me by this point in the album so this sound was a welcome change. The way the melody sits on top of the instrumental is really pleasant to listen to for some reason. Lowkey should have closed the album instead of “Mer Girl.” Other than that, it was super nice of her to give Butterfly a shoutout, even Madonna is stanning for Mariah in this rate!"
 
**therokinrolla**: "a gorgeous ode to her child, Lourdes, who heavily inspired this album. Thank you Lourdes. Lourdes>Lorde"
 
**awryj**: "Sing to me mommy"
 
**skargardin**: "This is so cute. Made me smile through the whole song."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "Lucky Star was one of Madonna's first hits in her career, and it began with a fabulous, trend-setting video where she acted wonderfully bossy and dramatic. But she switched that authoritativeness for tenderness in Little Star, changing her tone to make it sound like she's singing to a child. Perhaps it's her daughter she's dedicating this too, or perhaps it's her younger self. Perhaps it's both. This is as close to a lullaby as Madonna gets. It's a song I'd sing to my children and grandchildren. Not going to lie, I actually feel like my womb is being blessed when I listen to this song, despite the fact that my womb is hopefully going to be inaccessible by the time I turn thirty. Ah. What a song."

This is a cover of the song by Rod Stewart, but Janet does not alter the gender pronouns here, alluding to her having a sexual experience with a woman. Whether this was Janet’s way of confessing that she has questioned her sexuality for sure, we can’t be certain, but this is a smooth track. Although it drags for a little bit which hurts my score for it.
 
---
**joshually**: "Such a beautiful song that would keep me up at night with its gender shift from "girl" to "boy"."
 
**MrSwearword**: "it is a ballad done better than its predecessor, but still much too sedate for my liking."
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "sexxx dreams found DEAD"
 
**JunkyGS**: "In a stark contrast to the last song Janet covers Rod Stewart (who would later go onto say when asked about her cover, “That’s an original song by Janet Jackson”) with the woman now taking charge and really turns the dial up on the sexual anticipation with this uneasy intense pulsating beat. The song alludes to Janet experimenting with bi sexuality / losing her virginity to a girl, which caused a lot of media criticism. Janet addressed that criticism by saying, “I have a lot of gay friends, men and women, and that’s why I did it. I knew people would say I was gay, and I didn’t care”."
 
**TragicKingdom1**: "Significantly better than the original but still dragged down by it."
 
**mokitsu**: "i know this got some heat in leaf's rate but i love it! add janet's sexy voice and some lesbian themes and it's a 10"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Queen of exploring her sexuality."
 
**zamomattel**: "ENDED Rod Stewart"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "It annoys me to no end when singers change the pronouns of a song to make it fit their sexuality, so mad props to Janet for singing the song as it was written. So often in the media we see examples of gay singers closeting themselves or making songs about women/without pronouns because society pressures them to, so I love that Janet flipped that on its head. What’s wrong with making a queer song every once in a while? 20 years later and really more singers should be taking a page out of her book."
 
**therokinrolla**: "a solid lesbian sex bop"
 
**awryj**: "A really nice cover, in some ways it's even better than the original, which is definitely creepier than Janet's version."
 
**VeganSquash**: "very chill"
 
**skargardin**: "Sensual, funky bop."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "It's funny. I gave the original a 1.5 in our Billboard rate, because it felt super rapey and creepy. To quote Rod Stewart, though, this does feel like an original composition by Janet Jackson. It has themes of sexual exploration and empowerment that say a lot more than the original, and it unleashes all the song's jazzy elements into full potential. One of the most improved cover versions I've ever heard."
 
**jess_22**: "instrumentally I prefer Janet's version, but that doesn't make up for the fact that this song is literal garbage"
 
**Jelboo**: "Memories of early 80's Janet, but this time with a vengeance. Excellent sex jam!"
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Wow invented bisexual threesomes!"
 
**jamesfog**: "A million times better than Rod Stewart's version."
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "Queen of sleeping with women"
 
**rickikardashian**: "Janet made one of the most uncomfortables songs to listen to really pretty and climatic. The line “Don’t say a word my virgin child” still makes me want to take a shower"
 
**nooodisaster**: "I can't get over the maybe-incestuousness/pedophilic meaning of the original version of this song. It's also just kinda slow and boring tbh."

MrSwearword: shit, Madonna lost half her album on Day 1; granted most of those tracks were trash, "Mer Girl" being the exception but oh my GAWD.

MrSwearword: it's true. Hard Candy is a wonderful album if you don't count "4 Minutes", "Incredible", "She's Not Me", "Dance 2night" or "Voices"

Itsafudgingstick: On The plus side none of the remaining Madonna tracks are noticeably filler/below average so Madge should be in a good spot by the end of tomorrow <3

Jelboo: Sorry I couldn't be here, I had a lot of sleep to catch up on.

Madonna deserves better, of course, but I understand why those songs were scrapped. I expected more of Mariah to go, though.

Nice rate reveal so far!
