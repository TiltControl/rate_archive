###[Welcome to the 90's Personal Masterpieces Rate!](http://i.imgur.com/WwJIslu.jpg)

###Hosted by /u/triptoyourheart and /u/joshually

1997 and early 1998 was an interesting era for pop music. It seemed like most artists were starting to swim into uncharted waters, playing with styles and sounds they hadn’t delved in before, and telling listeners tales of what had happened in their lives. Madonna, Janet Jackson and Mariah Carey are three legendary women in pop music who all released their most experimental and personal albums to date all within the same time period and now it’s time to pit these three albums against each other.

Words can’t begin to describe how excited I am to be co-hosting this rate for you guys. All three albums rank as some of my favourite albums of all time and have defined me as a pophead. They aren’t the most accessible albums in each ladies’ discography by any means, but are widely considered to be their magnum opuses and are must listens for any pop fan. I hope you can find something special in at least a few of the songs because they all have a different and special message to them, these albums are all about the lyrical content and the lush, smooth production, not too many ~BAWPZ~ to be found here.

###[Madonna - Ray of Light (1998)](https://images.genius.com/397e6b32d3580f01390cef6d7a4c08d4.1000x1000x1.jpg)

The beginning of the 90’s was where Madonna’s career took a left turn. Coming off her wildly successful ‘Like A Prayer’ album, her image began to become more and more provocative, she became more vocal on social topics such as LGBT rights and HIV awareness, to which the general public did not take a liking to. Upon the release of her album ‘Erotica’ and book ‘Sex’, she received heavy backlash for her overt sexual image. Sales plummeted, TV and radio stations banned her music and it almost ruined her career. Following the ‘Bedtime Stories’ era where she attempted to soften her image, Madonna underwent vocal training for her role as Eva Peron in the musical movie ‘Evita’. In 1998, Madonna returned with a more spiritual and minimalistic image, and a brand new sound with revered electronic music producer William Orbit and her vocals at their strongest in her new masterpiece, ‘Ray of Light’. This album spoke about her deceased mother **(Mer Girl)**, the newfound joy of being a mother to her daughter Lourdes **(Nothing Really Matters, Little Star)**, her spiritual enlightenment with Kabbalah **(Drowned World/Subsitute For Love, Ray of Light, Sky Fits Heaven)**, and her studies of Hinduism and Bhuddism **(Shanti/Ashtangi)**. This album has been credited to bringing electronic music into the mainstream spotlight.

###[Janet Jackson - The Velvet Rope (1997)](http://images.genius.com/6d02caa17c9a1e080af7ed70ed27bea3.1000x1000x1.jpg)

During her ‘janet.’ World Tour, Janet suffered a mental breakdown, caused from re-living traumas of childhood incidents such as being scolded by her school teacher in front of her classmates and her abusive marriage with James DeBarge. She developed depression and an eating disorder in the process. In combination of psychology, meetings with a spiritual guru cowboy and… coffee enemas, recording the album was like therapy for Janet, as singing about her past troubles in life was necessary for her to fully heal from the trauma. The finished product is R&B with elements of electronica, covering subjects such as depression **(Velvet Rope)**, domestic violence **(What About)**, racism **(Can’t Be Stopped)**, masturbation **(My Need)**, homophobia and LGBT issues including the memory of a deceased friend from dying of AIDS (**Together Again, Free Xone)** and even experimenting with her sexuality **(Tonight's The Night, Rope Burn)**. This album was a blueprint for alternative, electronic-laden R&B albums to come in the future, which can be heard in more recent albums such as FKA Twigs’ LP1 and Tinashe’s Aquarius.

###[Mariah Carey - Butterfly (1997)](https://images.genius.com/0d17342f2097b6207ecad565db5d3da4.1000x1000x1.jpg)

The conception of ‘Butterfly’ came about during the middle of Mariah’s divorce with Tommy Mottola, who had limited her creative input of her previous albums. When reports that Mariah had taken more control over her own career, media speculated whether the couple would split. Surely enough, they did, leaving Mariah to create an album she had always wanted to. A continuation of the more R&B oriented sound she began with her previous album ‘Daydream’, Mariah made the complete transition from syrupy pop ballads to smooth, sexy R&B and hip hop music. The album contains lyrics about breaking free of her ex-husband’s control over her life and beginning anew **(Butterfly)**, a night of carefree lust **(The Roof)**, reminiscing about her failed marriage **(Close My Eyes)**, the struggles of being biracial during her childhood **(Outside)** among other things.

###Rules

- Listen to EVERY song (including the bonus tracks I have included), and assign it a score from 1-10, inclusive. Decimals are allowed **but only ones that end in one number like .5 or .7**, nothing like a .64 or .734.
- Give every song a fair listen, the album tracks are among each ladies' best in their entire discography and are just as good as the singles (and in some cases, even better).
- You are allowed to give ONE song an 11 and ONE song a 0 (although why would you even want to do that in this rate smh), this is optional and meant to signify your favourite and least favourite song in the rate.
- I will be enforcing a minimum average for this rate. That means that if your average for any given album is below a certain threshold, I won't accept your scores and you'll have to resend them. I also reserve the right to reject your scores if I think you're intentionally trying to sabotage the results and not just rating songs based on how well you like them. You're allowed to dislike an album, but you're not allowed to be obnoxious about it.
- Also don't give every song on an album a 10 or something like that. Have some nuance in your scores.
- Use the [prepared link](http://tinyurl.com/y73gmb8c) to send in your scores. I will be using the program created by /u/letsallpoo so please make sure your ballot is formatted properly, i.e. do not mess with the prepared link's format.
- You may (and are encouraged to!) include comments with your scores. To include a comment, just write it directly after your score, like this:

> Nothing Really Matters: 0 KIMONO SHE BETTA DON'T!

- Please don't write tons of excessively long comments for multiple songs. I want to include everyone's comments but if they get too long it becomes hard to do so.

- You may (and are also encouraged to!) include comments for particular albums. Feel free to write essays for these. To include a comment, add a colon and write it directly on the album line, like this:

> Album: Butterfly: Mariah invented semen and insects on this album.

- PM it all to me. Then just sit tight until the reveal begins sometime in October!
