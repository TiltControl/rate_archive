90s Personal Masterpieces Rate: Ray of Light vs The Velvet Rope vs Butterfly - Day 2 - Joni Mitchell never lies...
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/77weji/90s_personal_masterpieces_rate_ray_of_light_vs/

##**HELLO AGAIN AND WELCOME!**

Today we will be continuing on with Day 2 of the 90s Personal Masterpieces Rate, hosted by me and /u/joshually!

The same stats again in case you guys need a refresher:

- The reveal will start at **7PM EST**, we will be looking to be doing Day 3 earlier so it's more convenient for more users, as I won't be able to do the reveals then, /u/joshually will be taking over then! More details on that later, I'm also willing to take suggestions on what would be the best time for everyone tomorrow.
- 44 people participated, much more than I anticipated so thank you all who voted!
- The average score for the entire rate was **7.8416**
- The average controversy score was **1.8433**
- No plug.dj room, sorry guys. :(
- Remember, you can be messy and funny (that's what makes our rates so much fun) but keep things respectful and please no stan wars, we're here to celebrate three wonderful albums by three legendary women who are all deserving to win this rate.
- I have also used some fanmade graphics for each of the songs, so I have to stress that I didn't make these, I just thought they would look really nice for the reveals. If anyone has a problem with them being posted on here, I'll remove them as soon as possible, and my apologies.
- Today we will revealing songs #30 through to #16, and Day 3 will be from #15 to #1

After tonight the Top 15 will be revealed! Madonna took quite a beating in Day 1, can she hold on? Will Mariah continue her unexpected dominance? Will Janet take some big losses? Will it be all singles come the finale, or will some deep cuts sneak their way to the top? Let's find out!

MrSwearword: Birthday dinner during the rate, but let me openly speculate on this...the Madge singles are probably guaranteed Top 15 status. Mariah has to take some righteous hits [that probably means "Babydoll" is about to die] and Janet will have some shocking chops that will piss off JunkyGS like a *motherfucker*.

That's just my take on it. Also joshually's comments are probably going to be word salad.

This is out waaaaaayyyyyyy too early, wtf guys. This song is fucking incredible. It starts the three track punch of this, Nothing Really Matters and Sky Fits Heaven and man is it a rush of blood to the head (do /u/strawberryswing1‚Äôs Pop Rock Bands rate as well btw). For over six minutes Madonna sends us into a high speed trance of lust and longing for another person‚Äôs touch and it doesn‚Äôt even seem that long. A real shame this didn‚Äôt go further.
 
---
**joshually**: "OMG that jungle trival beat makes me sweat like only the strong feeling of guilt could ever do"
 
**MrSwearword**: "this Sega Dreamcast beat‚Ä¶blurgh"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "underrated BOP! love to see it come back as a tour interlude or something tbh"
 
**mokitsu**: "dark and creepy but still a club banger"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "This song is literally everything. Madonna wants you now and you‚Äôre going to give it to her good."
 
**zamomattel**: "Honestly the most underrated Madonna song, so beautiful and like hyper"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "If she wanted to write a song about desiring love rather than just sex, that‚Äôs fine, and for what it‚Äôs worth the song DOES work well in that context, it‚Äôs just such a drag. I don‚Äôt want to be rude, but there‚Äôs literally no reason for this to be the longest track on the album. If you make a song six and a half minutes you better damn well have something to show for it, and this song just‚Ä¶ doesn‚Äôt. It makes lyrical shifts and key shifts but none of them really stick or manage to make any significant shift in the song. I remember during the 2013 albums rate Beyonc√©‚Äôs ‚ÄúRocket‚Äù got bumped pretty early on because people complained that it was too long and too sexual, so if this makes it further than that then this sub is full of hypocrites. She also hits a few noticeably flat notes (listen to any time she sings ‚Äúthing‚Äù it‚Äôs rough) especially after those weirdly unnecessary key changes, she gives a great vocal performance on the rest of this album so I‚Äôm not entirely sure what happened here. Not to be rude but she kind of sounds like a goat at certain points. I love goats, just, don‚Äôt really want to hear them on an album."
 
**therokinrolla**: "Mmm sensual. Sexual. Hot. ‚ÄúTouch Me I‚Äôm Dying.‚Äù I came."
 
**awryj**: "I like the trancey production, but it's kinda dated. I feel like the vocals don't match the instrumental."
 
**skargardin**: "This slaps hard but I feel like she hasn‚Äôt got much to say on this track. Feels a bit filler-y."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "ehhhh, stretches too long for me. i don't like this song, although the instrumental is amazing."
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "This is gonna be slaughtered due to it's length, but honestly I think it's a perfect track, and that the length of it is warranted. Skin is heavenly, and captures me every single time I listen to it. The track manages to remain beautifully ambient throughout yet have such an intense atmosphere at the same time. To put it simply: A bop."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "Skin is really hard for me to rate, because it's one of the most experimental tracks on Ray of Light. The other songs on this album ended up taking 8.5 MB to about 12 MB on my tablet, but this took up 15 or 16 MB. It's an event of a song, of course, and the sensory overload you get after 'put your hands on my skin' leaves you in shivers. Perhaps it's not the Madonna I want to listen to when I want a gay bop, but it's one of the songs that shows that she can pull of experimental well. That being said, it's one of the songs I relate to the least on this album. It's fantastic, but I tend to concentrate more on the production than the lyrics, and overall I feel like I lose some of the intimacy, unfortunately."
 
**jess_22**: "this dragged on for like 2 minutes too long"
 
**Kaylaboe**: "flume who?"
 
**Jelboo**: "Very 90's, droning, danceable."
 
**LandoFreeman**: "cyberpunk videogame soundtrack teas"
 
**nooodisaster**: "The production for this is BEYOND. It keeps building and building, adding layers until it's like we're swirling in the desire of the song. Classy slut anthems ftw."

The ultimate BDSM song, Rihanna could never. From the opening moan of ‚ÄúMy lips hurt‚Ä¶‚Äù you know Janet is about to take us on a wild ride. The thing is that Janet never really goes overboard with sexuality on a song about BDSM, but yet still makes this song oozing with lust and naughtiness. Janet is almost whispering the verses but explodes with the chorus, the harmonies are so nice and sexy and tops it all off with the moaning of ‚Äúrope burn‚Äù. It‚Äôs an amazing song and  true standout from the album.
 
---
**joshually**: "Literally the first song I ever heard about S&M... Rihanna featuring Britney who?"
 
**MrSwearword**: "this is a song to get fucked to and I LIVE"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "im in a sex dungeon as we speak"
 
**JunkyGS**: "Janet dives deep into her sexual fantasies and pushing the limit of pleasure with this exotic slow burn jam. It is a must have on a sex playlist and talks about exploring BDSM."
 
**mokitsu**: "my favorite janet song. so sexy and the bondage themes are the cherry on top."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "This is literally everything. Janet is into BDSM and this is everything I could‚Äôve ever wanted in a song!"
 
**zamomattel**: "The tie me up bit is so fucking good"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "This isn‚Äôt what I assumed Janet meant when she to ‚Äúcome with [her] inside [her] velvet rope‚Äù but I‚Äôm not complaining. It‚Äôs a good thing my boyfriend broke up with me because after listening to this song I would probably have made him do weird stuff with me."

**awryj**: "It sounds like a Sex Scene Song‚Ñ¢ from a 90s Action Movie‚Ñ¢ but I can jam to that"
 
**VeganSquash**: "Queen of BDSM"
 
**skargardin**: "And I thought ‚ÄòTonight‚Äôs The Night‚Äô was sensual. This amps it up even more and I just love it so much."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "the sexiest song on this album damn. the moans at the beginning, her voice, ugh. this legit got me hot and bothered."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "The sexiest song on this album by a mile, obviously. I'm too innocent to analyze it, so I'll take the time to applaud Janet for tackling a shitload of social issues on this album. Sex positivity, feminism, LGBT rights, and the overall theme of anxiety and mental health implied throughout? Wow. Just wow. I think this a more effective political album than Rhythm Nation, honestly. This is one of the best examples of woke pop and technically the album isn't even specifically dedicated to that."
 
**jess_22**: "well, Janet really did that."
 
**rsmitty99**: "this song invented sex"
 
**Jelboo**: "More erotic than anything Madonna's ever done."
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Fifty Shades of Grey is shook."
 
**Raykel**: "She used her moans for the production. Serving Donna Summer realness."
 
**LandoFreeman**: "TIE MEEEEEEEEE"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "The moaning is the best part of the song who knew women could be sexy. As much as I like ropes in the bedroom I don‚Äôt really like this"
 
**nooodisaster**: "S&M who? Love Me Harder what? No shame, this song is on every sex playlist I have. Janet doesn't mince words, telling her lover exactly how she wants him to take control. I love it because I'm a kinky bastard too, but also because it's a good portrayal of what BDSM is. Sexy, fun, but always based around communication and the sub actually holding the final power."

So this is the hidden track of The Velvet Rope which plays after Special finishes. Janet has always been one to speak out about social injustices, and here is an empowering anthem for black people and the discrimination they face ‚ÄúWe were born with blood of kings and queens‚Äù is such a great line. Along with a funky beat, this a nice way to truly end the album. Janet also acknowledged this song again in support for the Black Lives Matter movement last year.
 
---
**joshually**: "This empowering song, if it wasn't a hidden track, could totally have been a single and probably have done well. The message is even more relevant now with all the upheaval happening in our society."
 
**MrSwearword**: "barely above bland but not by much"
 
**JunkyGS**: "Can‚Äôt Be Stopped was to be directed at the young people who are victimized to it to not be discouraged by the discrimination they face. When asked about this song Janet said, ‚ÄúThis is a song to my sisters and brothers who have to deal with a world filled with racism and bigotry. I want them to know that their inner-strength is stronger than the forces against them. Don't let nobody tell you, you ain't strong enough.‚Äù That strength-to overcome obstacles, (personal, physical, emotional & political) is the whole mantra of The Velvet Rope."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "R&B GOLD! GUCCI MONEY! I LIVE!"
 
**zamomattel**: "Certainly not bad, but gets a bit lost in similar songs"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "LOVE the message of this song Janet but also I‚Äôm 100% not strong enough soooo‚Ä¶"
 
**therokinrolla**: "this hidden track is NOT Special"

This is my least favourite song off the album. Now don‚Äôt get me wrong, I still like it and I love the songwriting on this one, it‚Äôs arguably the deepest and most personal song off the entire album‚Ä¶ but I just wish it went somewhere. It just kind of comes and goes. I dunno, I wish I loved this song as much as some others do. Maybe one day it will truly click for me.

**rsmitty99**: "This song got me through a lot. It'd be an 11 if Breakdown wasn't Mariah's best written song in her repertoire. It's Mariah's story, starting off as a "wayward" child struggling to find confidence in her mixed race. She then grows up quickly as shes married off at 23 to the most powerful man in the music industry, Tommy Mattola. It'd be like if Whitney married Clive Davis back in the day. But she felt trapped and finally "woke up in time" and thanks her guardian angel (I think that's her fans) for sticking with her throughout all the turmoil. It's an amazing story."

A gorgeous ballad to follow up from Frozen (more on that song when we get to it), where Madonna has given up on her lover ever returning the love she had for them, so she learns to let them go. The production is gorgeous and Madge‚Äôs vocals are very nice, but my nitpick with this one is after how dramatic Frozen was, this feels a little underwhelming following it, but it‚Äôs lot better listening to it by itself.
 
---
**joshually**: "Ahh‚Ä¶ the song that got away‚Ä¶ From charting in the Top 10‚Ä¶ I remember how close it was‚Ä¶. Until the moment Billboard changed its rules and TPOG went down like 30 spots te week it was at like #11 and slooooowly climbing. ‚òπ"
 
**MrSwearword**: "I don‚Äôt hate it as much as I thought but this is still bad"
 
**Saucymac**: "- also an amazing song, would be higher if it weren't for frozen"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "i really want to fight her for never/rarely performing some of her greatest songs"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "I wanted to say goodbye to this song."
 
**zamomattel**: "beautiful, one of her best vocals in my opinion"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "The Pine-Sol woman was found left dead in an alleyway! The lyrics to this one are fantastic, some of my favorite on the album. I love the ‚Äúyour heart is not open‚Äù reference to ‚ÄúFrozen,‚Äù it‚Äôs a nice touch that an extra layer of depth to the track as it basically provides us with a whole backstory to the song: she details what‚Äôs wrong with this person in ‚ÄúFrozen,‚Äù and this song is her letting them go. It‚Äôs a nice little easter egg to reward the people listening closely to the album."
 
**therokinrolla**: "‚ÄúDo you wanna go higher?‚Äù is one of those ‚Äúchilling‚Äù moments from this album that really cement this thing as a whole. This song is further an example of the perfect combo of guitar and electronic. It is put together perfectly. Just.. perfectly. Fuck me up madge"
 
**awryj**: "This song is powerful enough to make one of the most generic chord progressions sound heartfelt and profound"
 
**skargardin**: "Really beautiful ballad."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "a ten/ten song again. her voice and the instrumental meld amazingly well, and the acoustic guitar gives me chills. a true treat for the ears."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "'Your heart is not open, so I must go'. Another brilliant comeback to the previous track, just like Drowned World and Swim. Madonna decides to give up on a relationship here, but the funny thing is that I can't tell whether she's indignant or desperate. She sounds sensitive here and deeply hurt, but you just can't deny how scathing 'Freedom comes when you learn to let go/Creation comes when you learn to say no' is. But then again, the way she sings 'I yearn to say goodbye' is heartbreaking. This is often how I feel after a hard, long, argument with people I know in real life. Defensive, yet regretful."
 
**jess_22**: "i nearly fell asleep listening to this. How does this manage to be so boring?"
 
**rsmitty99**: "This is the first song where Madonna's voice impresses me. It's fits so well with this song."
 
**Jelboo**: "One of those songs that makes you sad. Makes you yearn, makes you mourn, gives you that mixture of joy and sorrow - nostalgia. It makes me miss people, things, places, memories. Masterpiece."
 
**LandoFreeman**: "Hate the chorus"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "‚ÄúCreation come when you learn to say no‚Äù someone should‚Äôve said no to this song the guitar halfway through brings it up a point for me"
 
**nooodisaster**: "I'm kinda feeling Madonna here, but I'm also kinda bored. Hm...."

A great mid-tempo jam. This one‚Äôs about Janet needing to satisfy her sexual desires, whether with another person or by herself. The breathing and moaning heard throughout the song is very sexy and really adds to the atmosphere of it all. I also think Janet‚Äôs vocals are really nice.

**cloudbustingmp3**: "NUT"
 
**JunkyGS**: "This song addresses Janet questioning her & everybody‚Äôs need for their obsessive crave for attention. It is incredibly introspective and features beautiful harmonies and layered production. Janet also said the song is about sexual obsession, ‚ÄúAnd sexual obsessions may be the strongest obsession of all-when you see him; when you don't know who he is but wonder what he's like; and when you want him. I'm singing about the need to please yourself‚Äù."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "One of the best masturbation bops I‚Äôve ever heard. I live for masturbation bops, and Janet does it pretty damn good."
 
**zamomattel**: "of the many sex songs on here, My Need is very middle of the pack, vanilla if you will"

**VeganSquash**: "ungh, yah, unhhh....ohhhh, unnhhhhhnnnn"
 
**skargardin**: "Queen of masturbation. No but in all seriousness, this production is so tight and sensual. I love it."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "I'm not sure I like some of the heavier elements on this track, but the chorus is beautiful, acting as a clear example of why Janet just needs the proper notes to show her vocal skills. My least favorite part of this is the clicks and the clacks in the middle, since they're a bit too much for my ears, but they're not what I remember when I think of this is song, which is at least something."

When I first started listening to Butterfly, I usually skipped this track. It‚Äôs arguably the sweetest ballad on the entire album so I could see why some find it to be too much, but Mariah shows such emotion in this track and the key change at the climax and the final chorus is simply breathtaking. I have shed a tear once or twice listening to this.
 
---
**joshually**: "This song may get dimissed as a "standard ballad" or whatever, but musicians and vocalists will all agree this is one of the most technically difficult songs by Mariah to sinbg (and she has MANY)"
 
**MrSwearword**: "oh stop this shit. Her talent is there but NO MORE DRIP"
 
**gaymike219905**: "One of her best ballads imo."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Hit Mariah‚Äôs phone up sweeties!"

**Ghost-Quartet**: "My friend Doreen texted me over a year ago and I still haven‚Äôt texted her back‚Ä¶ I just cut her out of my life basically because I was so ashamed. I‚Äôve failed you Mariah. If I‚Äôm correct this is the only song on the album that‚Äôs a true solo, there‚Äôs no backing vocals or anything like that, and she still kills it."
 
**therokinrolla**: "me maybe"
 
**awryj**: "When the song began, I gave it a 3 because it sounded really cheesy to me. It got better as it went on though. Mariah really can convey emotions through her voice, despite all of the vocal runs and melismas."
 
**VeganSquash**: "the bridge was amazing, everything else? Very bland."
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "SadMariahBallad#47.mp3"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is another AC-style ballad and thus a suitable follow-up to Close My Eyes, but Mariah's whispery vocals and the melody of the chorus's 'wheneever you callll' makes this a tad better for me. I wouldn't complain if she did more ballads using this style in the future."
 
**jess_22**: "a beautiful ballad, I literally forgot that this existed until the rate"
 
**rsmitty99**: "A vocal masterclass, but I feel like it's a tad out of place on this album. I think Columbia pushed her to make a Early 90s Mariah style pop ballad to have as a backup if they couldn't get a hit. It's nice, though. The duet she does with Brian McKnight is better."
 
**Raykel**: "The key change saved this from getting a 2. I know a 2.5 ain't much of an improvement but it should've been less boring in that case."
 
**jamesfog**: "Her vocals are stellar on this song. The vocals, the instrumental... ugh, sheer perfection."
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "Another ballad that shows when Mariah gets it right it‚Äôs really right. Queen of harmonizing with herself Zoidberg who"
 
**nooodisaster**: "Even though this album was Mariah's emancipation into hip-hop, she can still churn out adult-contemporary power ballads like few else."

This song is so gorgeous, I can‚Äôt stress how much I adore it. Probably my favourite Mariah deep cut ever, which is saying a lot. Here Mariah is waiting on some guy that‚Äôs stood her up possibly after a previous one night stand, possibly thinking a real relationship could form from it, but he keeps her waiting in her hotel room only to never come. That‚Äôs how I‚Äôve always interpreted this track. From the lush opening synths to Mariah effortlessly crooning the verse to the flawless harmonies of the chorus, I really can‚Äôt find anything to fault. The riff she does in the second verse and the bridge are highlights. A beautiful song through and through.

**joshually**: "Missy + Mariah = Pure Magic"
 
**MrSwearword**: "simple and alluring"
 
**mokitsu**: "sexy and sultry"
 
**gaymike219905**: "Missy and Mariah are a dream team."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "A cute little love bop from Mariah, although I really hate dolls because they creep me out."
 
**zamomattel**: "Luscious vocals and production, love her so much"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "There‚Äôs two major kinds of hoe bops. There‚Äôs your aggressive hoe bops, the ones that you bump and grind to that make you feel like grabbing someone or doing a high energy choreographed routine involving the splits. Then there‚Äôs your sensual hoe bops, the ones that make you feel like you‚Äôre wearing a slinky silk robe and nothing else and you‚Äôre just kind of rolling around in candlelight touching yourself. This is the latter and it‚Äôs hot."
 
**therokinrolla**: "it isnt bad, like most of this album, it just doesnt grab me, vocally, sonically, lyrically. It doesnt do it for me."
 
**awryj**: "It drags on a little bit, but I really like the emotion in Mariah's voice"
 
**VeganSquash**: "whisper-singing = annoying"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "I didn't get to appreciate how much of a gem this deep cut was until last night, admittedly. I've never experienced romance except for a shitty period of infatuation with somebody that ended up using me, but the pain Mariah delivers here is all too relatable for anybody who wants another person to notice them. The part where she admits to drinking and getting high to forget the person she's singing about features some of the best lyrics in this song and it's depressing."

Yeah this bops, and hard. It‚Äôs more or less an interlude but it‚Äôs got such a great beat and those adlibs from Mimi, slay queen! If only it was a proper song, then I‚Äôd rate it even higher. I wish we got to hear more house influences on this album, as Mariah originally intended Butterfly to be a House/Dance album!
 
---
**joshually**: "When will your mainstream pop diva include a straight up house song on her album?"
 
**MrSwearword**: "serviceable but needless in general"
 
**Saucymac**: "- sorry this song is the trash of the album and wasn't needed."
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "invented house music! still waiting for the day she decides to bless us with a whole album like this!"
 
**TragicKingdom1**: "Works, but I would prefer if this was a sub-2 minute outro/interlude following the first version."
 
**mokitsu**: "honestly this song is pretty useless but i love listening to it for the fadeout at the end/transition into the beautiful ones"
 
**gaymike219905**: "My favorite of all Mariah's reprises. The whistle notes."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "We really did not need a reprise on this album Mariah, Lorde even did a better reprise that this."
 
**zamomattel**: "Ended Liability (Reprise)"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "Y‚Äôall know that I‚Äôm a theatre boy and so I‚Äôm a sucker for any song with the word ‚ÄúReprise‚Äù in the title and this song does not disappoint. Mariah is an amazingly versatile performer, she‚Äôs known for her ballads but this song really proves that she can make some bangers in equal measure. Mariah is really underrated as a producer, she blends her style perfectly with that of David Morales and creates a track that blends the finer points of house music with that classic Mariah sound."
 
**therokinrolla**: "omg a bop"
 
**awryj**: "So much better than the original Butterfly! The ambient intro and the boppy deep house chorus give me life"
 
**skargardin**: "Holy cow this complemented the title track really well. I‚Äôm usually not too crazy on reprises but this worked so well."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "damn the house beat! her whistle tones! aaaahhhhh my wig! i'm too shook to write a proper review!!!!"
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "This song starts off promising with it's atmospheric, delicate instrumental, however for me, the chorus derails a bit too much into campy happy clappy fun territory. Despite that, this is still a pretty strong track, and it's pleasantly surprising that the reprise is much better than the original song itself ( Õ°~ Õú ñ Õ°¬∞)"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "Maybe I'm being foolish. I'm essentially giving an interlude one of my highest scores. It's as if it's Intro all over again. But nothing can make me adequately explain what a fantastic interlude this is. This isn't some shitty interlude where Mariah just sings the chorus of Butterfly over a slightly worse instrumental. This is a reprise that takes the melancholy yet liberated tone of the original and turns it into a song of pure joy. The way she sings 'spread your wings and prepare to fly/for you have become a butterfly' goes perfectly with the production, and makes it seem like Mariah's become the muse of a gospel choir, praising the heavens for giving her delivery from her captor. Butterfly is a sad record, but sometimes, it carries hints of hope and freedom, and this reprise solidifies all those hopes into a glorious melody. Thinking about it now is honestly just making me realize how important Butterfly is to me. I'm going to cry."
 
**jess_22**: "look, this is cute and all but was it really necessary to include this on the album?"
 
**rsmitty99**: "A little club bop. Not my thing though"
 
**Jelboo**: "More like this, less endless whispering ballads pls"
 
**jackcs903**: "I'm so here for the house beat of this"
 
**Raykel**: "I know I was complaining about all these slowtempo songs, but she I'm realizing now that she should stick to those. It's not terrible, but I'm thoroughly confused by it."
 
**omgcow**: "I want this played at my funeral"
 
**jamesfog**: "A bop for a reprise!"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "At first I thought this was an unnecessary way to shoehorn in some more whistle notes but then the beat popped and so did my bussy"
 
**rickikardashian**: "I know its it's a reprise, but I feel like it went too far away from the original, but not far enough to be totally different and necessary. I think the album could have been released without this"
 
**nooodisaster**: "HOW IS THE REPRISE TO THE TENDERIEST SONG HERE THE BIGGEST BOP OF THE ALBUM?! True queen."

Simply a beautiful way to close out the album. This song is one of Mariah‚Äôs most personal, as it stems from her struggles of growing up biracial as a child. It‚Äôs song I think a lot of us can relate to, whether we‚Äôve felt different from the rest and shut out by people who won‚Äôt accept us for who we are. But as Mariah sings on, we can see the light at the end of the tunnel, and know it will get better, just like how it did for Mariah. Stunning album closer and delighted to see it do so well.
 
---
**joshually**: "You know, it's only later when Mariah started to slowly hint at how much she hated her life during her marriage with Tommy Mottola, and also growing up feeling ostracized, and then you listen to songs like this, that you realize she's been hinting at it for so very long‚Ä¶. :("
 
**MrSwearword**: "It‚Äôs a cute slow dance song"
 
**Saucymac**: "- This song is so beautiful. I think it means something different to everyone. For me, I listened to it during some rough childhood moments. I love it. always will."
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "Mariah is one of THE greatest songwriters of all time, and this song perfectly encapsulates that!"
 
**TragicKingdom1**: "Takes a little too long to build up to the end."
 
**mokitsu**: "i've cried so much to this track......the bridge/climax is one of the most powerful things i've ever heard. insanely relatable"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "I‚Äôd listen to this going on a run on a rainy day outside."
 
**zamomattel**: "Takes a while to get going but I do really like it"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "I had trouble understanding the lyrics of this one (Mariah‚Äôs voice is out in full force here) so I looked them up and apparently this song is about Mariah‚Äôs experiences as a biracial person and so I listened to it again reading along with the lyrics and it really hit me in my heart. As an interracial person myself this is something that nobody ever seems to discuss and yeah, she gets what it‚Äôs like. Maybe getting a little personal here when I was younger I used to look down at my skin and try to figure out which pieces were white and which were Vietnamese and imagine them tearing themselves apart from each other to make two people. Sometimes I felt like my blood would burn in my veins because I didn‚Äôt just have one kind of blood I had two kinds of blood and they weren‚Äôt supposed to mix. There‚Äôs a growing ‚Äúwhite genocide‚Äù movement that believes that interracial children are ‚Äúhate crimes against the white race‚Äù and that we exist in an attempt to water down the number of white people, and when I read about this as a child I was so hurt that someone who doesn‚Äôt even know me would think of me, and people like me, as something like that. For no reason! The reason I say these things is because it‚Äôs important for those of you who don‚Äôt carry this burden to have some idea of what it‚Äôs like so you can understand how important this song is. This feeling of being an outsider that she describes, the feeling of not really belonging to either ‚Äúside‚Äù because you‚Äôll never quite be enough for either of them‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs absolutely real and it‚Äôs something that affects an ever growing number of children and no one is talking to us about it! And Mariah was talking about it in 1997, the same year that I was born. That comforts me a little. It helps too that the song is absolutely gorgeous. If there was ever a doubt that Mariah Carey is one of the queens of ballads, this song completely obliterates them. If I had to point out one thing about the song it‚Äôs that Mariah‚Äôs voice is so powerful she almost overwhelms the lyrics at times, but that‚Äôs my biggest problem. That Mariah‚Äôs voice is too passionate and beautiful? You earned this 11 girl."
 
**awryj**: "Relatable, sadly"
 
**VeganSquash**: "high notes are great"
 
**skargardin**: "I think we all can relate to this song in one way or another. It has such an universal meaning even though being first and foremost personal to Mariah obv."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "I was sleeping on this song, too. I probably don't qualify for being biracial physically, but I'm one of the millions of pure or near-pure Chinese folks who's lived in the Philippines all their life. We're considered partially Filipino in spirit, and there are certainly parallels with concrete biraciality. I feel like I'm on the 'outside' a lot of times, too. You get scolded by your older family members for associating with anybody not East Asian, and you get shunned by some Filipinos for being presumably rich (I'm not). Sometimes you get harassed by both sides. It's getting a lot better recently, but the feeling of alienation still remains, unfortunately. Mariah's honestly a biracial icon, and it's a shame we don't appreciate that along with this song's gorgeous vocals."
 
**jess_22**: "relatable"
 
**rsmitty99**: "The gay anthem. If you struggled with being in the closet and don't cry to this song on your first listen, then you're doing it wrong"
 
**Jelboo**: "I had high hopes for this album. Turns out almost every song on it sounds the same..."
 
**omgcow**: "Being biracial I can relate to this 100%"
 
**jamesfog**: "The VOCALS, yes ma'am!"
 
**rickikardashian**: "this was the first song to really catch my attention and make me like it from the first time I heard it. The instrumental is very well.done and gives the song a really nice and warm feel to it, and the lyrics are really good explaining how it feel when you don't really belong anywhere.

This almost didn‚Äôt even make Top 20, but thankfully the last few voters propelled it into this spot, and I‚Äôm glad. A masterpiece of a song, and my favourite deep cut from Madonna. It‚Äôs actually a pretty special song to me, I feel like this was the song that helped me come to terms with my sexuality and to just follow my heart (it was a very good place to start hehe) not care about what other people thought or told me what to believe, which is what Madonna is telling us to do on this track. The production is sublime, possibly my favourite off the entire album, it‚Äôs fast paced song which blends orchestral sounds and electronic beats and drums to create this rush of euphoric bliss. I truly adore this song and I‚Äôm heartbroken it didn‚Äôt do better in this rate. :(

**zamomattel**: "Vast and absolutely stunning"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "Some artists make songs for commercials, but no, Madonna makes songs FROM commercials! 20 years later and we STILL aren‚Äôt on her level! Seriously though, this song feels like driving down a highway, it really takes you there."
 
**therokinrolla**: "I have no fucking clue what this song is about but it is such a huge bop. I know its somehow religious, but i literally dont understand the phrase ‚Äúsky fits heaven.‚Äù But luckily, this song also serves sounds. The chorus is one of the best on the album, and i feel as though this is one of the most underrated songs on the album, possibly even the best. The piano excellently accentuates the melody and the synths backing her. I fall in love every single time. Furthermore, the drowned out piano gives a really mystical sense to the song as the whole."
 
**awryj**: "A nice message, but the trancey chorus combined this really generic echoey piano sounds really tacky."
 
**VeganSquash**: "hypnotic"
 
**stardustanddinos**: "the instrumentals!!!!!! the lyrics are not doing it for me on this one."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "I was heavily debating whether to give this or Butterfly my 11. I ended up choosing the latter, but my justification for this one was going to be that while Butterfly represents my past, I'd like Sky Fits Heaven to represent my future. Emphasizing on the title track's themes, this song is another example of why personal can mean hopeful as well as melancholy. I love its lyrics; from 'hand fits giving so use it/that's what the Gospel said to me' (this is unintentionally meaningful for me, since I'm a trans man and I chose to name myself James after a verse from the titular book about helping the poor) to 'traveling down my own road/watching the signs as I go', the song's chorus ends on a Broadway-like note, as Madonna sings 'I think I'll follow my heart/it's a very good place to start'.

A true masterpiece of a song and one of my favourite Janet deep cuts. Seeing this continually get middling scores at the beginning was so painful to witness. This also was wrongly sitting outside of the Top 20 until the last cluster of votes thankfully gave it the 10‚Äôs it deserved. The song is about online relationships and how bittersweet they are, Janet sings of how the person you speak to on the net makes you happy and laugh, yet you can‚Äôt meet them in person and it‚Äôs incredibly sad at the same time. Little reminder that this song came out in 1997, back when the Internet was not widely available to most people, and how this song is still very relatable to this day shows how it has barely even aged, but lyrically and sonically. The Velvet Rope is seen as the pioneer album of Alternative R&B, where the album took elements of electronica and samples of different genres and voice samples as well such as the chanting heard in the second chorus. I think this song is a perfect example of what Janet managed to achieve with this record and how innovative it was.
 
---
**joshually**: "LOL this song is so dated with that AOL modem connection intro, but the crazy thing is when this album came out in 1997, the internet and chatting and all that was JUST starting to become huge, in a way we could never imagine it is now, but really the message is still so especially relevant - we are all SO empty with these shallow connections we make, whether online or in real life, and what we all need are meaningful relationships."
 
**MrSwearword**: "if it weren‚Äôt for the bouts of chanting it‚Äôd score higher because it fucks with the mood"
 
**Saucymac**: "- probably one of the more boring songs on the album"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "relatable & im still cryin"
 
**JunkyGS**: "This is all about Janet‚Äôs thoughts on the emptiness people who only connect with others on through the internet must feel. Janet said when asked about this song, ‚Äú"I like computers and use them to write and communicate with people all over the world. I believe computers are capable of tremendous good. But I also think about people whose only connection to other people is through a computer. I wonder what kind of reality that creates, and what kind of romantic frustrations it produces. After the machine is turned off and the electronic glow fades away, I wonder if you feel empty‚Ä¶‚Äù The song is very timely and incredibly relevant 20 years later, especially the gay community which connects primarily online through apps."
 
**mokitsu**: "this has some electronica vibes from ray of light, which make it a very interesting ballad"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Literally everything. Janet just loses her shit around this guy."
 
**zamomattel**: "For some reason this sounds like the scraps of Together Again"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "The instrumental for this song incorporates the sound of someone frantically typing on a keyboard and the sound of someone frantically clicking a mouse. I‚Äôm a big fan of chip tunes influenced pop, which is becoming more and more prevalent now but had waned at the time, and so Janet was really ahead of the curve on that one. Thematically Janet was VERY ahead of the time, she predicted loneliness in a digital age back when we were still using dial-up."
 
**awryj**: "[FRESH]"
 
**VeganSquash**: "the instrumentals are amazing, I love songs that sound like winter."
 
**skargardin**: "The production became so overwhelming at times but otherwise I really enjoyed it."
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "If y'all do this spiritual experience dirty I'm gonna be super pissed. This drum n' bass ballad feels not only musically ahead of it's time but lyrically as well."
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "This is my lowest score for this rate, which is disappointing, since I didn't expect to score anything lower than a 7. But...I just don't relate to this song. This may be a generational gap, but I don't feel empty when I finish talking with my online friends anymore than I would after talking with my friends in real life. I've spent all my life getting used to the Internet and I can't understand why anybody would regard this song as being completely relevant in 2017. Aside from that, the composition is fine, but it feels just a bit messy compared to the other songs on this album. I will credit Janet for being forward thinking, but in my experience her predictions were slightly wrong."
 
**jess_22**: "this was ahead of its time. It honestly sounds like something FKA twigs would release"
 
**Jelboo**: "Full of feeling and soul."
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Very timely, although I could imagine online dating looks so different back then since the concept of the internet was still new that time."

One of Janet‚Äôs most underrated singles which was severely mistreated (it got the ‚Äúlet‚Äôs just use tour performance footage for the music video‚Äù treatment and I don‚Äôt think was ever performed live outside of The Velvet Rope Tour, and I don‚Äôt think it managed to chart anywhere), which is such a shame because this song is a fucking JAM. It‚Äôs abrasive and unapologetic, Janet is telling us to pick ourselves up and stop blaming everyone else for our problems. A true self-help anthem, and one that‚Äôs actually helped me out a few times in life.
 
---
**joshually**: "the LAYERS of this song could keep me warm through the worst snow storms‚Ä¶ if the lyrics weren‚Äôt so direct and cold‚Ä¶. Yeouch! Also did anyone else get the ‚ÄúE C N E I C S N O C‚Äù adlibs near the end? I‚Äôm 14 and so deep y‚Äôall."
 
**MrSwearword**: "good but nothing that special, teebs"
 
**JunkyGS**: "This track is this ferocious groovy electronic dance song about all of us having to confront the fictitious versions of our lives. When discussing the song Janet said, ‚ÄúThose versions need to be challenged, because ultimately we have to take responsibility for ourselves-where we've been and where we're going‚Äù. Janet melts the listeners face with this deep voice that we have not heard up until this point, to really add anger & power to what she is singing. She fearlessly scrutinizes herself telling us (and herself), ‚Äú You can‚Äôt hide from you‚Ä¶ You gotta mean what you say You gotta say what you mean Tryin to please everyone Sacrifice your own needs Check in the mirror my friend No lies will be told then Pointin the finger again You can't blame nobody but you‚Äù This proves to us once we have entered Janet‚Äôs velvet rope she is not holding back, she bravely takes accountability for being the only one in control of your life & your own happiness which is incredibly personal, but manages to have a universal message we can all apply to ourselves."
 
**mokitsu**: "aggressive and in-your-face...one of her best singles"
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Another amazing sexual bop! You gotta mean what you say, otherwise Janet will literally end you. My wig was gone after listening to this."
 
**zamomattel**: "u by Kendrick Lamar is not shaking it is perfectly safe"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "I don‚Äôt like this song because, well, because it‚Äôs real. In the same way that Rhythm Nation 1814 was sometimes uncomfortable to listen to because of how real it got about problems with the world, The Velvet Rope is at times uncomfortable to listen to because of how real it is about the problems we hold within ourselves, and no song exemplifies that better than this one. This song is all about taking personal responsibility for yourself, and it‚Äôs a very tough pill to swallow and Janet does NOT hold back. She calls us out and exposes us on every level, and while it at first sounds like she‚Äôs just attacking us as the song continues she reveals to us that she‚Äôs placed herself in the role of our conscience, and thus rather than being an attack from her it‚Äôs an expression of the thoughts that we try to hide from. It‚Äôs also a surprisingly catchy song once you get a bit more familiar with the lyrics. Do I like being called out like this? No. I don‚Äôt like listening to this song. But I respect the hell out of it."
 
**therokinrolla**: "damn this chorus goes off!!!!!!!!! The whispering part is soooo good too!!!"
 
**Banananaise**: "Janet does whisper singing and moan singing so well, and the chorus goes hard. underrated gem"
 
**awryj**: "I'm not feeling it and I don't know why"
 
**VeganSquash**: "very hard to hear wtf Janet's saying. She also sounded like Michael in the chorus"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "See?! These are what receipts should be for! They shouldn't be used to propel an online community into an unhealthy circlejerk. They should be used to confront a person's issues harshly, but with everybody's best interests in mind. That's what Janet does on this track. The upbeat and complex production of this one blurs the lines between this being an empowerment song and a callout song, and Janet's lyrics reflect likewise."
 
**jess_22**: "the chorus is insanely catchy, it almost sounds like something Timbaland would produce"
 
**Jelboo**: "Janet with attitude and energy, the Janet I wish she would show more often in her post 2000 career."
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "The way she sounds deadpan in the lyrics is perfectly used in a song about self-loathing."
 
**LandoFreeman**: "yas jani braxton"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "The beat goes so hard on this song it drowns out Janet‚Äôs whispering. Selena who?"
 
**nooodisaster**: ""When you hate you, you hate everyone that day." How the fuck is this song so deep and yet such a bop."

The LGBTQ anthem for the ages, and one of the songs that truly made Janet an icon for the LGBTQ. It‚Äôs arguably the most fun and light hearted song on otherwise quite a dark album, which makes it a real standout to begin with, but here within the funky beat, Janet is telling us, whether we‚Äôre straight, gay, bisexual, transgender, etc. is to embrace who we are and to be accepting of everyone else, no matter our gender, sexuality or race. Such an amazing song, cannot praise it enough.
 
---
**joshually**: "Not the most "listenable" of songs tbh, but my god, the lyrics‚Ä¶ I remember being a closeted little boy listening to this and being SO uncomfortable at how close it hit home and this, along with her messages of hope and inclusivity, truly did help save my young gay life! Thank you Janet! <3"
 
**MrSwearword**: "how in the name of god does it go all over the place but still slay?"
 
**cloudbustingmp3**: "janet's LGBT activism is so underrated tbh"
 
**JunkyGS**: "This song features funky electronic production and is Janet‚Äôs protest song about the discrimination the LGBT community faces, while hoping for a world where people accept each other and arguing sexuality is part of who you are, and people deserves the freedom to be who you are."
 
**mokitsu**: "i'll be honest the lyrics don't make much sense to me...but it's gay friendly and a bop"
 
**gaymike219905**: "The jazzy elements, chanting/house beat, and radical (for the time) subject matter make this song a classic."
 
**Elitefourbrad**: "Janet‚Äôs LGBT song is amazing, pure R&B amazing-ness."
 
**zamomattel**: "Born This Way sounds different"
 
**Ghost-Quartet**: "One of the few ‚Äústraight people sing about how bad homophobia‚Äù songs that I‚Äôm going to accept. (Screw you Macklemore.) This was way back when coming out in support of gay people was legitimately controversial and not just trendy so I applaud her for taking a stand. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why she chose to spread this message in this oddly constructed dance track, but hey, a dance track has to be about something. Might as well be something of substance. Something about the way that she just kind of barks out the lyrics really makes them stick."
 
**therokinrolla**: "i love how this production just constantly switches up. This is a sampler of lovely production choices and i live for it. Also its gay so."
 
**Banananaise**: "resisting all temptations to just copy-paste 'GAY CULTURE' as much as i can"
 
**awryj**: "I absolutely love the production on this song, it's so hyper and there's so much layers of sound oh god"
 
**VeganSquash**: "This bops hard af, my wig is snatched. Best on the album imo."
 
**stardustanddinos**: "queen of gay rights, gaga who? madonna who?"
 
**BiPolarBear17**: "I meet a bop | bop finishes playing | I get the bop back on"
 
**patronsaintofaspies**: "I really didn't expect a freestyle from this album, but at this point I suspect that I can't really expect anything from Janet. A part of me suspects that this is only highly regarded because Janet had the balls to speak in favor of LGBT rights in 1998, but on the other hand, the beat goes off. (Also, FYI, Madonna did have a song about LGBT rights back during the Erotica era...though this isn't really a contest, so mad respect to both.)"
 
**jess_22**: "look I love the message that she's sending, but the instrumentals do nothing for me. Points for trying though"
 
**rsmitty99**: ""Then he found out he was gay. That's so not mellow" Dying"
 
**Jelboo**: "Meaningful, colourful. Could use something more to elevate it to top level."
 
**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "What a gay anthem. Interesting around in verse 3, she sings that the girl gets cute girl back instead of the girl gets cute boy back again. Truly a gay icon."
 
**jamesfog**: "Oh wow, a gay anthem!"
 
**PM_ME_YOUR_DICK_BRAH**: "Janet delivering yet again queen of the gays"
 
**rickikardashian**: "the trumpets and instrumental are really cool. The lyrics seem like random phrases thrown together and called it a gay song"
 
**nooodisaster**: "I want to love this song for being an outspoken queer anthem, but the production is just a mess imo."

Hogwartsreject1912: Okay I have a question:

So I just got back from your YT page (I decided to go on it after rewatching the Gaga/Sandy Texas video), and you have a video in which you claim that Chris Pratt is the hottest superhero from the MCU, which at the time, would've included Spider-Man (as in the Tom Holland one).

However, your flair is Spider-Man, and not Star Lord.

What's up with that? Where is your heart at? It's 3 AM, I'm sorta tipsy, and these are the kind of questions that are bugging me right now.
[/r/popheads/comments/77weji/90s_personal_masterpieces_rate_ray_of_light_vs/doppgt1/]

=====

DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy: Hottest does not equate to best overall.

My gay heart belongs to Star-Lord for obvious reasons. However, the superhero that speaks to me the most and the superhero that resonated with me since I was a kid is Spider-Man. For those reasons, Spidey is the best for me if that makes any sense.
