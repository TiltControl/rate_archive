Eclectic Artpop Rate (Tinashe vs. FKA twigs vs. Rosalía)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/12asaxg/eclectic_artpop_rate_tinashe_vs_fka_twigs_vs/

[Hello popheads.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1067127239147257896/1089403767964848128/ROSALIA.png?width=1200&height=1200) 

Welcome to the Eclectic Artpop Rate, affectionately also dubbed 333Caprimami (we dare you to create a name for this rate that isn't a mouthful). We, /u/cremeebrulee, /u/jman457, and /u/plastichaxan, will be your hosts as we rate some of the sub's favorite pop-adjacent releases of the 2020s: Tinashe's *333*, FKA twigs' *Caprisongs*, and Rosalía's *Motomami*.

While each of these three artists’ careers began quite differently, their latest works seem to coexist in the same dimension, thanks to their shared soundscapes, imagery, and production. Tinashe & twigs traverse supernatural themes for their projects, twigs & Rosalía share custody of The Weeknd as a feature and El Guincho as the executive producer of their works, and all three take on adventurous re-imaginings of the genres that brought them acclaim and their devoted fanbases. It'll be a competitive race to the top as we listen to what the future of pop, R&B, and reggaetón can sound like.

With that, let’s dive into the albums! If you're unfamiliar with rates, here's a [good video](https://youtu.be/iQ1SDlLZcpM) to introduce you to them. If you've done these before, here are the links to get you started:

# Tinashe - 333

> Who are you really though

> When no one can convince you different?

> Do you even know?

> If you could undo what you're going through, would you?

Tinashe always seemed to be your favorite artist’s favorite artist. Being well known enough where you know her name, but never truly huge where your grandma listens to her music. Getting her start in acting/voice roles (you may know her from her motion capture performance in the Polar Express or her one episode stint on Avatar: The Last Airbender), she first broke out in the musical world with her 2014 record Aquarius (shout out almost birthday twins). The record produced the moderate hit 2 On with Schoolboy Q and put her on a path to stardom. While her blend of electronic influences from the xx and ​​SBTRKT and R&B influences from Janet Jackson and Aaliyah made her a fan favorite, her record label RCA didn’t really know what to do with her. After her 2018 record Joyride failed to make any impact; Tinashe separated from RCA and went independent under her own label. Her 2019 record Songs for You felt like a reestablishment of Tinashe’s artistic values, becoming the first independent record since Blonde to hit number 1 on the iTunes Chart and getting some of her best reviews of her career. 

With 333, released in 2021, it felt like pure freedom for Tinashe. She had proved her artistic merit with her past album, and didn’t have the pressures of a big label like her early records. 333 has numerical significance as “the Angel number” and encourages growth and forging your own path. [It is associated with] (https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2022/12/19/angel-number-333-meaning/8251737001/) optimism, creativity, and intuition. [Tinashe stated that](https://notion.online/tinashe-digital-cover-august-333/) “I named it 333 because I really felt like I was on the right path, in alignment with what I was meant to do. I just wanted to acknowledge that.” That's where the beauty in this record comes from, it feels both experimental, yet conceptually whole, with a strong R&B through line with influences of house and synthpop. [Stereogum said it best with their review](https://www.stereogum.com/2156594/tinashe-333-review/columns/the-week-in-pop/): "whereas the similarly diverse Joyride seemed awkwardly stitched together, a result of too many cooks in the kitchen, Tinashe's post-RCA albums feel coherent no matter how much she experiments because they're so clearly an outgrowth of her own perspective. She's the one calling the shots, and she knows damn well what she’s doing." — jman457

# FKA twigs - Caprisongs

> I wanna be more confident, I really do (*"I really do"*)

> The universe, fam, the universe is so powerful. You're gonna be more free and you're gonna love more and you're gonna have more fun

> Do you think so?

> And I'm tell— no, I don't think so, I know so

Three years after the release of Magdalene, fans of FKA twigs waited eagerly on what the dancer-turned-singer-songwriter would do next. With her last album receiving widespread and unanimous acclaim, any follow-up would have enormous expectations to meet. So you can imagine how the excitement started turning into apprehension as twigs revealed more and more of what her next project will be like— a mixtape for starters, with double the amount of tracks that were on Magdalene. Throw in a lead single with one of the biggest popstars in the world AND this being her major label debut under Atlantic, there was cause for concern that the sub’s favorite [mysterious bitch](https://youtu.be/yDhVqgeRPJ8) was exchanging her enigma and mystique for mainstream appeal.

Luckily, these worries faded with when the project, Caprisongs, arrived fittingly on January 14th, 2022, in the midst of Capricorn season. Caprisongs is an ode to the stars on the day twigs was born and how they shaped twigs after the heaviest years of her life. The astrological theme is [woven expertly](https://youtu.be/Qx6VPYP4heI) through the mixtape, giving it that alternative edge that slots this nicely with the rest of her discography. It's undeniably twigs' most pop album yet, but with its intricate production and honest lyricism, it still feels quintessentially her. 

Caprisongs is exactly the type of project twigs needed to release after *Magdalene*. It's a document of rediscovery, with twigs proclaiming her intentions quite clearly: wanting to ["[fall] in love all over again but this time with music and with myself."](https://www.instagram.com/p/CYZeAVotLsp/?img_index=1) Like its namesake sign, it's playful; with words from twigs' close friends narrating the tape and the numerous, short *Capri*-vids she's released over the course of the rollout. It's also adventurous when it needs to be, venturing into untouched genres for her like [dancehall](https://youtu.be/7vJ9F9YAaxc) & [UK drill](https://youtu.be/HlilMZ1FwVA) and with the right collaborators to match. But it shares its lightheartedness with emotionally resonant moments, with brutally honest tracks about the singer's insecurities, state of mind, and hopes for the future. It's absolutely opportune that the project dedicated her unique astrological fingerprint is the one where we learn the most about the woman behind twigs' artistry, in some of her most adventurous musical pursuits yet.  — cremeebrulee

# Rosalía - Motomami

> And though I may be cursed behind my back

> From every little stab, I pull out my rage

> And though I may not have money or anyone

> I'm going to keep singing, because it comes from within me

Okay motomamis. This is it, we’re finally rating her. Rosalía’s third album, MOTOMAMI, has been defined as many different things, but I think my favorite is a collage, a collage of the different things Rosalía herself got inspiration from and wanted for the album. Separated as the “Moto” and “Mami” with the “Moto” songs being the songs that are faster, and a bit more experimental in sound, and the “Mami” songs being the ballad-type slower ones. However, the songs from both sides are put in the album in-between each other, and not having a clear separation, because they all have the elements that make MOTOMAMI an album as cohesive in theme and production as Rosalía herself wanted it to.

Motomami, as the album and the era, began with ["SAOKO"](https://youtu.be/6o7bCAZSxsg), which synthesized a lot of the elements and themes the album would have. Transformation, tongue-in-cheek lines and delivery, using the voice as an instrument, minimalist production that doesn’t seem too minimalist due to the filtering and use of chops in different instances, switches in the music, the finding of a balance between the lack of structure in the song with the making of a classic reggaeton song, among others. Her initial goal with the album was not to repeat El Mal Querer, and she definitely fulfilled it. 

During the album, there are themes from personal experience, especially with the fame she found after El Mal Querer, and the consequences of it such as [“DIABLO”](https://youtu.be/0GMeqmqUjEQ) and [“BULERÍAS”](https://youtu.be/Ncpw_4ioDQY) mentioning people’s way of viewing her art, as well as [“LA FAMA”](https://youtu.be/e-CEd6xrRQc), [“CUUUUuuuuuute”](https://youtu.be/PHvhnnMa7Dc), [“SAKURA”](https://youtu.be/5JeNKeb0glw), and especially [“G3 N15”](https://youtu.be/XlNtBPvPUTM) that warn about the toll fame can have on a person and their relationships. With this third album, after her last two, Rosalía wanted to try a more fun side of her music, where she just did things because she wanted to, such as “HENTAI”’s lyrics contrasted by the soft music, [“BIZCOCHITO”’](https://youtu.be/aG5C32aATKc)'s playful tarareo (which seems to be translated to humming but doesn’t sound right).

With an era as bold as her, that as she said herself is a reflection of the way your mind goes from one place to another, there is something for everybody, with the album spawning a lot of conversation among critics and the general public that got to listen to lyrics that didn’t seem to make sense until you interpret them, or listen to Rosalía herself explaining them, and music that while it seemed experimental and even abrasive at times, it’s very minimal in the elements it uses to get there. All in all MOTOMAMI is Rosalía’s way of seeing the art she is making at the moment and we are merely spectators and listeners, and while we can appreciate it or not, we can only hope she continues doing whatever she wants with her sound. — plastichaxan

* Any other format **will not be accepted.** 
* You can also add an album comment if you like by adding a colon (:) and then whatever you please:

>>>> 333: if you divide this by 33.3, you'll get my album average

* Lastly, **do not attempt to sabotage any songs/albums**. As long as you rate honestly, this should not be a problem, but we will reach out if we have concerns about your scores. If you have any questions about this, feel free to message any of the hosts as well.
