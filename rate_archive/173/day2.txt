Yesterday, we eliminated our 20 least favorite songs from Tinashe's *333*, FKA twigs' *Caprisongs*, and Rosalía's *Motomami*, and today we're going continue.

Today, my co-hosts [/u/plastichaxan](https://www.reddit.com/u/plastichaxan/), [/u/cremeebrulee](https://www.reddit.com/u/cremeebrulee/), and I will be revealing what placed **#38 - #19** in our main rate. We'll began eliminating songs at **5PM EST** or about an hour after this post goes up. Be sure to join us in the [**Queup room**](https://www.queup.net/join/caprimami333) where we will be listening to the songs as they go out, with some fun bonus content as well. If you can't make it to the Queup, we'll also be in this thread and on the [#rates channel on the Popheads discord](https://discord.gg/popheads) so feel free to join us there!

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): I like this song but I don't have a single take on the “whether this is better or worse than what she did on Caprisongs”-course. To me, it sounds like something that could fit very easily on the mixtape :confusedsob: It's very Piscean ven, with it syrupy melodies and lyrics, so people who were disappointed with the mixtape but loved this don’t really make much sense to me... At least the discourse made the placement of this song VERY unpredictable: this went as high as top 5 to right on the edge of Day 2, where it stayed for its actual elimination. Album purists everywhere rejoice, since this is the last of twigs’ loosies to have left. 

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Why the guy looked kinda hotter in the end it’s not right

**jman457** (8.3): I kind of wish the album sounded more like this, better integration of the pop elements.

**throwaway-7650** (10): CHVRCHES interlude pleek

**welcome2thejam** (6): Don't wanna die for love? Don't worry, I got someone in Sub Faves who's ready to step up

# In a crisis with a killer

**akanewasright** (10): I can’t believe I’m attached to another love song about matty healy

**alexismateofan** (10): One of my favorites by her, I LOVE this. Her voice is beautiful and this song lets it shine.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i hated this when it came out but listening now its kinda like?? the best song ever?? im sorry for not appreciating you twigs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She looks like she’s being exorcised in some parts of this music video but like the demon possessing her is also serving major cunt.

**bogo** (10): this rules idc

**Frajer** (10): yeah we're all in love Brandon Flowers

**ReallyCreative** (10): I believe this is the perfect infusion of twigs’ more mainstream sounds and her experimental roots, one of my favorite tracks from last year

**sarcasticsobs** (10): These bleeps and bloops hitting oh so right

**WaneLietoc** (10): this lady just really wants to dance in ways that express how much it feels to feel like you are being carried by your lover. she cannot stop dancing and expressing this catharsis. rock on FKA twigs!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i barely met her

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): :thekiller:

**indie\_fan\_** (9): i think i like the loosies more than most of the album

**RandomHypnotica** (9): I really thought she was singing "I never wanna call it dinner wanna call it dinner"

**amr** (8.8): chorus falls flat but the rest slays

**UselessTacooo** (8.8): overhated I said what I said

**seanderlust** (8.5): (jasmine masters voice) you a killer, bitch. get it together.

**krusso1105** (8): tiny desk version would have been 9 or higher

**Nagisoid** (8): This would eat in the Among Us soundtrack

**ss2811** (8): got me so hyped for her next album

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): ngl i wish this was on the album but i guess it doesn't fit the theme. still.

**Ambrosia42** (7.6): growing on me a bit

**lexiaredery** (7.5): This song has grown on me an incredible amount since it was released

**Lynflower680** (7.5): I thought the beginning was very strong but the rest of the song just didn’t have that same energy. Still like it though.

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I love the vibe but I wish the chorus was more explosive

# Murderers

**afs** (7): please dont go in this direction its so ok

**horridhendy** (7): Yeah it's good.

**runaway3212** (7): me

**uberpigeon** (7): this is the most 7 song of all time. it really cant get more of a 7 than this

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): A remarkably “fine” song

**vexastrae** (6.5): its bland to me i fear

**DaHumanTorch** (6): i mean it's a decent song it's just...so generic/bland for twigs. hope she doesn't continue in this direction

**Stryxen** (6): decent… redundant

**1998tweety** (5): how disappointing

**auntiegay2** (5): Dead on arrival I fear…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like it would be on euphoria. twigs if you get a call from sam levinson DO NOT ANSWER IT

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (3): Her worst song

**frogaranaman** (3): hifn c side I fear

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (2): That snare is so jarring. This song just doesn't have much going on, so a small detail like that snare can just ruin the whole thing.

**qazz23** (0): feel that this is the weakest track here, there's not a strong hook and nothing really stands out

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (0): idk it just feels phoned in to me. it has all the elements of a twigs song but none of them done well

**plastichaxan** (10): This song is extremely beautiful! Her voice is incredible and aaa I just love her making anything she cures my balladphobia but not everyone’s I see

**jman457** (7.2): Wish it built up to something bigger, but it feels weirdly nostalgic.

**cremeebrulee** (6.4): This is a really touching ode to Rosalía's nephew, Genis, who the song is titled after (get your mind out of the gutter people). I definitely relate to the song's mention of missing out of parts of a loved one's life, but it's never a track I find myself revisiting, so it's departure at the lower end of Day 2 checks out. I do like that there's that spoken outro by Rosalía's grandma at the end of the this track, since I've always said that this album and *Caprisongs* are super similar in a lot of ways, that being one of them.

—

# Loves their niblings

**alexismateofan** (10): This is just really beautiful and touching, sad and majestic. I really feel the heart in Rosalía come through here.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the lyrics to this are so touching i’m actually tearing up. and rosalia’s grandma voicemail? this is so poignant and lovely aw

**freeofblasphemy** (10): Holy fuck was not expecting to be hit with that much emotion when I started this album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): aunt Rosalía knows how to feed her niblings

**runaway3212** (10): one day rosalia will release a full ballad album and popheads will die but I shall LIVE

**saviorARMY101** (10): man these lyrics are so sentimental and her vocals are lovely

**throwaway-7650** (10): "familia" camila cabello cameo omg (it really it is a "cam"eo omg)

**beeozan** (9): i always read this as penis im sorry

**ImADudeDuh** (9): surprised how good this is

**Nagisoid** (9): I can't make a joke about this one, this is heartbreaking (but she is evil for putting this just before the title track, same energy as Taylor putting Soon You'll Get Better before False God)

**ReallyCreative** (9): I enjoyed this so I get the feeling it will not do well

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): yessss girl disrupt the flow of the album 😍

**Ambrosia42** (8.6): beautiful and touching

**akanewasright** (8.5): I’m mad, someone told me the song’s name was supposed to be “genius,” and now I find out it’s actually named after her nephew Genís? Now I can’t make a joke

**WaneLietoc** (8.1): this is some orange milk ass shit (complimenatry)

**-mczrv-** (8): the organ!? too cool

**1998tweety** (8): idk what this means but im living

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the organ really brings it together

**vexastrae** (8): the organ synth is lowkey funny to me for no reason

**afs** (7.5): ms your first letter is awry

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): The regretful feeling of work separating you from time to spend with your loved ones, especially a young child who's growing up fast, is beautifully put in here, even when the organ is not my preferred choice of backdrop to set it to

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): I was gonna make some stupid joke like "More like P3 N15" but then I read up on what the song was about and then actually listened to it and I'm like "...oh."

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): her “only one” moment a little bit with the autotune lullaby, this is nice

**qazz23** (7): i like when the loud vocal comes in midway

**sarcasticsobs** (7): I don't like the auto-tune but pretty enough. Sweet topic

**ss2811** (7): a much appreciated slower song

# G0 N00

**horridhendy** (6.5): It has grown on me but it's still not much better than fine for me.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): prettiest of the motoballads

**nt96** (6): it spells "Genius", shes so quirky

**Stryxen** (6): the minecraft soundtrack impact

**bogo** (5): i don't mean to sound rude but i just don't have any interest in anything happening in this song. it sounds kinda nice but that's pretty much it

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I got a “low battery” notif on my wireless headphones while listening to this and it’s probably the most memorable thing about this song 💀

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i don't really have an opinion on this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): who’s dog did they put autotune on

**RandomHypnotica** (4.8): genis

**jackismotomamitoday** (6.6): kinda a bop but interludephobia gets me here a little i can’t lie

****Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): motomami** (6.6): That one drum rules, oh fuck off, this already ended as I was typing? Bullshit. Make the song longer, coward

**freeofmotomami** (6.5): A decent appetizer that could’ve made an even better entrée

**MotoNagisoid** (6): And the MAMI? We crave the mothering

**welcome2themotomami** (5): Don't know if this works well after the last song. Lmao alright "produced by Pharrell Williams" a lot of pieces just fell into place

**jman457** (8.4): a sweet song, with cool beat switch

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): Tinashe's been able to pull off two-parter songs in the past before ([Know Better](https://open.spotify.com/track/5PjiqTsTLuK1xkTkg0o6go) off *Songs For You* immediately comes to mind). I don’t think the two halves of Unconditional suite each other, tragic since each serve so much on their own. The first half showcases some incredible, emotive delivery and the second half really spotlights Kaytranada's production. I definitely would’ve score a bit higher if they weren’t handcuffed to each other.

**plastichaxan** (7): Both parts eat for very different reasons which also makes me wish both were their own song in their own sound and I say it as someone who adores switches

---

# you got me, baby, I'm yours now

**amr** (11): not even her dad cosplaying as sza's grandma on ctrl could ruin this masterpiece of a song

**akanewasright** (10): This one actually took ages to grow on me but MAN it’s just otherworldly

**alexismateofan** (10): Every morning, I wake up, I slam my Tinashe CD into the CD player, and I pop off to Unconditional and that’s all there is to it!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Tinashe’s Dad is on the outro?! acclaimed professor/publicist?! https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/idth9b/tinashes_dad_promotes_her_new_single_to_his/

**qazz23** (10): love the sudden switch a minute in to the acoustic guitar-led smooth soul sound

**throwaway-7650** (10): UN CUNT DISH SHIEN LUL UN CUNT DISH SHIEN LUL LEE I

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): Tinashe is stuck waiting again!! This song seems like she is in a relationship that is really causing her to have a bad time, but she loves them so much that she is willing to do whatever it takes. Then her dad’s voice comes in at the end, talking about how people are revered for fighting in wars that we maybe shouldn’t have been fighting in the first place. It connects I think to the theme of fighting for a love that shouldn’t be fought for. Kind of genius tbh, and it connects the past (her dad’s old recording) to the present.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): the hard feelings/loveless print of it all… why did these 2 different sounds need to be joined when one is so much better than the other

**saviorARMY101** (9.5): I love this song overall but man that first half should've been a full song 😩

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): Beat switch???

**Awkward\_King** (9): olivia rodrigo HATES her

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): Has that late 00s forward thinking dance R&B style that I'm loving

**welcome2thejam** (9): My annoyance at the dude's voice early on in the beat was immediately forgotten when Tinashe's voice came in, holy moly. Oh shit, the switch up

**babadork** (8.6): I seriously considered giving this the 0 because every few listens I hear Tinashe sing something about her balls, but I never hear it when I have the lyrics in front of me.

**aquariuszns** (8.5): love the switchup

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): im a sucker for her 2 part songs, its just so fun to get a surprise bonus song.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Katy Perry when she’s applying to a noun and not a verb, adverb or adjective

**1998tweety** (8): ended katy perry

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Not a top-tier cut but that's relative on an album this good and I’m not gonna knock anything that manages to pull off emotional frankness and glitchy goodness  this well

**Lynflower680** (8): It was going to be a six for me until the chord change (is that what it’s called idk lol) kicked in. Nice fade-in to Angels as well.

**Nagisoid** (8): The first part is better than the second, foreshadowing for Bouncin

**runaway3212** (8): another moment honestly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the first minute of this song is a 10 but then the rest of it is a 6 so. i guess im making a compromise with my score here

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): tin "beat switch" ashe

**WaneLietoc** (7.9): gonna pretend this is an ari a/s/l cut...lyrics about getting ghosted?! lol we're back on aim! i like when she tries to put two ideas into one track that's aight

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): This beat switch is giving NMIXX levels of awkward…and yet it somehow works? I like the second section a lot more tbh.

**afs** (7): can i get a

**IIIHenryIII** (7): UN-CON-DI-TION-AL-LY, I will love you

**ss2811** (7): such a good track

# Conditional love

**pig-serpent** (6): There's a neat switch-up here, and both halves are decent, but I definitely like the second half better.

**UselessTacooo** (6): when I ask for progression this is not what I meant

**CrimsonROSET** (5): not the chipmunks

**horridhendy** (5): Kinda boring

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): never clicked for me, i think she's trying to do too much in this one song and after bouncin.... well that's a hard song to follow

**uberpigeon** (4): magdalena bay outsold

**beeozan** (0): maybe a weird zero but I didn't like the first part, I don't think it earned the switch-up (like what was the point) and then it also did the spoken word thing :(

**plastichaxan** (10): Creo que G3 N15 es la balada más bella pero esta es con la que más me conecto emocionalmente, la letra es increíble y su voz siempre siempre me va a parecer de las cosas más hermosas de este mundo

**cremeebrulee** (9): Easily my favorite of the albums’ ballads— it's just a gorgeous song with an amazing accompanying piano. I also can't get over Rosalía's insistence on naming the slow songs on her album the most out of pocket shit— Like a G, Hentai, etc. This song never made it further than Day 2, which makes sense with raters' typical balladphobia though if I had to choose one to escape that, it would've been this song.

**jman457** (7.5): kind of straight forward piano ballad, but it built nicely

---

# Real Gs 

**akanewasright** (10): This being an emotional ballad called “like a g” will never not be funny

**alexismateofan** (10): ohhhhhhhh fuck i can feel her working on my brain chemistry.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This album is like half frantic ass shakers and half the most beautiful ballad you’ve ever heard.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ambient smasha

**flava** (10): hentai wishes she was this

**horridhendy** (10): One of the strongest on the album, it was the runner-up for my 11 but just missed out.

**Nagisoid** (10): Balladphobia will be defeated when this goes out day 3 at #11 with a 8.165 average

**throwaway-7650** (10): ...oh this really does have james blake's fingerprints all over it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Gorgeous, warm voice. Gosh, the way it swells at the end. The ending vocals are such a championship-winning move, gotta love it

**Ambrosia42** (9.7): stunning

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): the way I just gravitate towards these songs that are this extra type of pining even if I don't understand what she's saying

**IIIHenryIII** (9): is this Spanish for Like a G(6)

**cocosairdep** (8.5): omg didn’t know she was a bottom G stan!!

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.3): The best ballad in the album

**bogo** (8): okay this made me feel stuff

**CrimsonROSET** (8): anyone who disgraces this song with a like a g6 joke you’re going to hell

**freeofblasphemy** (8): A very strong chilly number

**sarcasticsobs** (8): : (

**aquariuszns** (7.7): nice album finisher

# Como un flop

**afs** (7.5): that outro... babe you were so close

**pig-serpent** (7): My opinions of the ballads keep sliding up and down. Sorry if you wanted me to put this higher.

**ss2811** (7): another strong slower song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): her songs are always such bangers that it's easy to forget how strong her vocals are

**Stryxen** (6.5): started a bit meh but then got gooood

**WaneLietoc** (6.5): this one is sleepy

**dream\_fighter2018** (6): that end… she heard we needed to be taken back to streaming mvs on an Nintendo DSi

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): truly did not expect an album with a naked woman in a motorcycle helmet on the cover to have so many piano ballads

**beeozan** (5): ok maybe she missed once

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): ok whats up with all the ballads on this album i thought this was supposed to be a cunty pop album why are we so somber on like half these songs

**oscarbrierley1** (3): very bored

**runaway3212** (3): okay maybe hold back the ballad album for a few years

**plastichaxan** (8): She really made the video for us girlies who take the bus and stare out the window while listening to her music to feel something. Thank YOU FKA Twigs

**jman457** (7.2): It was a nice outro

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): I guess it’s time to admit I’ve never been huge on this song. While Tinashe had the most obviously named closer in the rate, this one has always felt too on the nose as a finishing track. The transition from christi interlude into “I wanted to die” is, of course, indescribably funny but I find the rest of the track too barebones and its melodies uninteresting. That isn’t to say, I’m not happy that twigs has found purpose and love again! I just don’t care to listen to as a song. I always thought that was an unpopular opinion, but seeing this song hold a bottom 5 placement for multiple ballots makes me wonder if maybe more people aren't as thankful for this track as I thought. It did eventually work its way up to Day 2, but it was a long, long climb.

# Thank you for these scores

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (11): Soul-crushing from the fall from the horoscope paradise of the previous interlude to the opening lyric; it's not the easiest listen but it's an understaning, necessary one sometimes

**akanewasright** (10): “I wanted to die” me after any slight inconvenience

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): And a thank you to Arca as well!

**flava** (10): that i wanna die coming right off an astrology reading in the interlude did more to make fun of that culture than Lorde ever did

**cremeebrulee** (10): There was no way I was going to hate this considering I'm a sparkling water fiend, but this track encapsulates that effervescence SO well. "Tap my heart / make it feel like you know me" are some of my favorite lyrics in the rate, just the perfect description of what it feels like to seek validation on a curated image on social media. I get the grievances about including the random fan on the outro, but I'm honestly having way too much fun bopping to notice. The ciara.gif of a rank graph is honestly really tragic, this should've stayed in Day 3 idc idc!

**plastichaxan** (10): Hypno seeing the vision and 11ing this like !! Also this is my most unhinged comment ever probably so kids of popheads don’t read this but.  It is too short but it gives me such a rush ~~kinda like poppers omfg~~. Also the f-- fan at the end is literally me except I walked the streets of Bogotá listening to that song

**jman457** (8.7): honestly a really good little track, hilarious ending

# Actually, the guy at the end was Hypno

**runaway3212** (9): how did they get tk on this

**CrimsonROSET** (8): but like did she release the song or did she leave benji hanging

# See:

**RandomHypnotica** (11): This is not a meme 11 I swear, I just absolutely adore this song in every way, and how it feels like it perfectly responds to the way social media is influencing our behaviour in the real world. "eight simi-haze looking girl scouts" referencing how social media chooses an *it girl* and hyperfocuses on their style and how to replicate it, losing all individuality in the process only trying to achieve a trendy look, and the lines "vogue filter face" and "swipe up to dream, tap my heart and make it feel like you see me" critique the false proximity of online dating and how little actually human interaction is involved in the process. 

The songs short length further adds to this messaging, it feels like a perfectly distilled endorphin rush designed to perfectly capture our shortened attention spans in the same way TikTok does, and then the speech about the unreleased Dua Lipa collab showcases the parasocial relationships and the kind of selfishness and entitlement the most unhinged fans can hold. I truly do adore this song and I hope it doesn't get too punished for it's short length.

**akanewasright** (10): hypno I’m so sorry for what they about to do to your baby…

**ss2811** (9): makes me wanna dance whenever i hear and extra points for the dua lipa collab mention at the end lol

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): she was sick and twisted for that part at the end

**impla77** (8.2): too short for me to give a higher score, but this is fun, and we love a bit of trolling

**Ambrosia42** (8): the audacity of including the clip of the gay wanting her leaked song and then still not releasing it

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I hope that twink was compensated omg

**horridhendy** (8): I appreciate the passion that fan has for that unreleased song.

**Nagisoid** (8): Putting a person begging for you to drop an unreleased track and still not doing it is so camp

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): lol at the utter irony of sampling some guy talking about the Dua collab but not actually including it on the album

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): twigs goes h****pop for 90 seconds, also her one friend stating facts

**shipperondeck** (7.5): and still no release of why dont you love me anymore

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): wonder if that gay did the unreleased rate last year

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Usually spoken word intros/outros don’t increase my score for a song, but this one is super cute! (even if I don’t necessarily agree with the person talking because that song did NOT sound great in Unreleased)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): not the leak discussion lol

**musical\_pyn** (7): I did the unreleased rate, why don't you love me can stay unreleased actually

**seanderlust** (7): her featuring that voice note and then not including it on the album, she's so funny

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Clearly y'all have some sort of trauma involving this song so I'm just not gonna say anything

**moonshxne** (6.8): i have no idea if that recording ultimately raised or lowered this score 😑

**bogo** (6): i heard that dua lipa collab in the unreleased rate, trust me it deserves to stay unreleased

**indie\_fan\_** (5): it's kinda funny hearing him go crazy about why don't you love me and then cut to how the song did in unreleased

# They know they love it (love)

**amr** (10): found out this is french for grapefruit which is ofc a goat fruit so

**buddhacharm** (10): me and the gowlles with ah phaurnes aouit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): anyone remember that very twee and cringe youtube band called pamplemousse. omg i just looked them up help https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oIr8-f2OWhs

**pig-serpent** (10): She's serving Charli on this one.

**saviorARMY101** (10): it's a crime this banger is so short 😩

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the best song ever made i couldn’t believe it

**throwaway-7650** (10): 🏳️‍🌈

**WaneLietoc** (10): the art of the sub two minute pop ditty is truly one of the hardest works to accomplish in my memory bank. you have a third of wire's pink flag and tmbg's lincoln (great pop album), dB's big brown eyes, and that hockey monkey ditty by the zambonis. also this. this is like grinding a rail in jsrf. do you understand how absolutely great it feels as the closer of side A? i am riding THAT dragon.

**lexiaredery** (9.5): not a ten because it's too short

**Frajer** (9): I don't think La Croix has a smell but if she says it does I believe her

**1998tweety** (8.5): boppin

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): I prefer Waterloo Sparkling Ginger Citrus Twist

**beeozan** (8): pimple

**qazz23** (8): good short song, speedy and energetic

**afs** (7.5): longer pls

# La Croix antis

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): la croix mid

**-mczrv-** (7.3): hit potential but it's so short :(

**Lynflower680** (7): I’ve seen people hype up this song and at first listen I didn’t get it but after a while it clicked. You know those fashion games that you could play on the Nintendo DS? The song reminded me of that and I think that’s why it grew on me slightly.

**alexismateofan** (6): La Croix, for when you want your beverage to taste like it was in the same room as the fruit.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): feel like this could go really hard if it was a full length song

**TiltControls** (6): Don't love the song, but pamplemousse is such a fun word to say

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): kinda fun, but doesnt do much.

**freeofblasphemy** (5): This feels like it was made both for TikTok and to mock TikTok

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the only skip on this grant album

**UselessTacooo** (0): I have been waging war against this song since it dropped why stop now

**plastichaxan** (10): The Weeknd cantando en español es básicamente Romeo Santos y nunca voy a dejar de pensar que es él asjdsjdsj

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): The lead single off *Motomami* makes its unassuming exit here; I would imagine that it got its status as the lead because of the name attached to it. I enjoy it, but it definitely not near the top of my ranking on this album. I think Abel's Spanish here is serviceable, but Rosalía definitely carries this song for me. My favorite thing about it is probably the bachata inspired beat, it just adds another interesting layer to the soundscape of the album. La Fama's performance has always been middling throughout the rate, so "tears in the club" was always winning the Abel-off, through by how much, we will have to wait and see...

**jman457** (7.8): too bad the weeknd didnt have a song with Tinashe

---

# Congrats to our now most-rated artist on the sub

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We really should have started a GoFundMe for Bouncin’, Pt. 3 (feat. The Weeknd) to complete the Abel Rate Trifecta…(and yes I used this comment twice)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): me giving a song with a Weeknd feature a 10 oh wow what a shocker (please ignore that I didn’t give tears in the club a 10)

**impla77** (10): ngl first time i heard this i thought this guy is doing a great weeknd impression

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (10): Wow. This rate has two really great Weeknd duets.

**alexismateofan** (9): The Weeknd makes for a good addition here, and I love the melody in the back, like damn.

**akanewasright** (8.5): my bad take here is that I really do prefer the solo version Rosalía does live. Like I think Abel is pretty decent here, and I’m happy that he helped boost her profile a bit, but the higher key and her vocals really do wonders for the song

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): I actually like Abel a lot in here, and I generally feel like his popgirl collabs are more miss than hit

**memezaharamole** (8): here is where "mom says it's my turn for a Weeknd feature next" entered my lexicon

**runaway3212** (8): okay maybe I forgive abel

**ss2811** (8): rosalia and the weeknd work so good together

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): of the two weeknd collabs in the rate... this one is definitely saturday

**welcome2thejam** (8): I feel like I should just start assuming The Weeknd will show up on songs we rate now

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): I know this is understood to be one of the less well-liked tracks here but what can I say I take whatever Abel does musically rn

**afs** (7): abel testayawaye

**bogo** (7): it's good but the weeknd just kinda sounds off here. tears in the club outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this bitch is in every album i swear to god

**qazz23** (7): kinda formulaic, Weeknd feature is decent

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Weeknd jumpscare

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Underwhelming for me considering the two people on the song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): for a weeknd feature, this does feel quite filler-y, especially in contrast to the rest of the album. the production is good however.

**flava** (5): Fka Twigs is laughing at this song knowing her collab with The Weeknd  is destined for the top 10 and this is getting day 1

**Stryxen** (5): he needs to not…

**uberpigeon** (5): what's he doing here again

**Awkward\_King** (3): abel feature more like i wish they were abel to make this song good

# Felicidades a nuestro artista mejor rated en el sub

**saviorARMY101** (10): Never would I have expected a Rosalia-The Weeknd collab to be a bachata, but it honestly slaps

**jasannn** (9.5): Yassss, El Fin de Semana

**cocosairdep** (9): omg that pronunciation… the weeknd put his whole duolingussy into this

**WaneLietoc** (8.9): the vocal lessons and effort mr. weeknd has done in order to become a global pop star who enunciates the same en español as he does en inglés. truly no one has wanted to be a pop star as bad as him, especially in this feature on one of a handful of the LP's cuts that are basically about being "famous and sad but also horny (and flexing)". this one def rocks and weeknd adds a lil' "spice" to. i get this colossal vibe from the weeknd's delivery on this cut that he pronounces "bistec" as "beef steak". if you know what I mean...anyways tbh I kinda like this weeknd black jacket/beanie and bleeding out mini era a lot; I think this is when abel decided he didnt wanna be da weeknd no more 4 realsies.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): need a native speaker to tell me whether abel sounds good here or not

**Ambrosia42** (7.8): idk if i needed the weeknd singing in spanish, but it’s catchy

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7.5): I'm glad she included a solo version on MOTOMAMI+ cuz like, did we really need to hear The Weeknd sing in Spanish?

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Even when singing in Spanish, the Weeknd still feels like he’s been phoning in his features

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): ok i cant describe it but the weeknd sounds like a vocaloid in this song. like ive heard people make spanish covers with vocaloids who are not meant to sing in spanish and that is what he sounds like in this

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): someone check in on the Weeknd girlies… hearing him sing in Spanish probably made them die from thirst

**nt96** (5): the better track that features The Weeknd, but not by much. As someone with a Spanish background, I feel Bachata is a bit harder to cover not only due to its sensual nature, but also its more fluid rhythm. I admire Rosalia for taking on different genres, however, not every experiment is a successful one. A bit too rigid for bachata.

# Everyone else:

**horridhendy** (10): When I first heard this one, I was a bit disappointed but honestly, it's really grown on me. Not quite top five on the album but it's still a 10 so that's just testament to how good this album is.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): average rater who makes it to the banner, listen up

**shipperondeck** (9.5): idc. its big vibes

**-mczrv-** (9.4): idk I loved this! respect for going such a traditional, low-key route for such a high profile collab

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): https://tenor.com/view/bailando-ni%C3%B1o-morocho-gif-20943266

**pig-serpent** (9): I get that this is the sell out track but it's catchy and has the distinct sound design I love about this album so in this case it's not a bad thing.

**vexastrae** (9): ouuu the sexiness is oozing out this song

**beeozan** (8): catchy song but flows a bit weird at times

**moonshxne** (8): so, so overhated (but hopefully i'm wrong)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): like despecha said, fuck la fama

**Nagisoid** (5): Lady Gaga dupe

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): ugh I don't want to relisten again to see how more it's grown off

**aquariuszns** (4): eh CHOP

**plastichaxan** (10): Something about a girl that makes music for f-words making a car related song makes them feel so laced idk what to tell you

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): honda is a song that slips my personal radar because of the tracklisting— it's between two of my favorite songs on the mixtape, so it gets a little overshadowed, though I do like it! Contrary to a lot of the comments, I do like the extended intro, it builds up my anticipation to twigs' disyllabic verses really well. I'm not familiar with Pa's work at all, but his feature absolutely killed it. There were times where this slipped into Day 3, which was really exciting, but alas its final stop is right before the halfway point of the rate.

**jman457** (8.2): cool production on this

**sarcasticsobs** (10): that "Look, conquer" changed something in my brain chemistry the first time I heard it

**WaneLietoc** (10): twigs u don't know how badly i wanna smoke in da honda fit;i hotboxed in vuelva usted (the name of the '92 volvo 240) instead. this cut had mongo bass really going for it that belonged in that car. but the fit really throws it up. I think here was when I was suddenly REALLY

**Ambrosia42** (9.4): I really enjoy the features she has in this album and how their voices mesh together

**akanewasright** (9): slut music

**oscarbrierley1** (9): intro too long, but the song is enough of a bop that i mostly forgive it. i love the jazzy piano in the background.

**qazz23** (9): good vocal delivery and bass, love the use of that sample in the background

**afs** (8): vroom vroom ?

**ss2811** (8): love the afrobeats influence and pa salieu’s verse is great

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): god i can already tell half my comments for this album are going to be "it's a chill bop". anyway the second half of this song is really good in particular

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): why does this take so long to start

**Stryxen** (7.5): almost great, gets a bit boring but i love the instrumental change towards the end

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.3): The intro I don't care about, it goes for too long, but the rattling bones beat and the chanting makes a magical atmosphere for twigs' voice to command, and the guest verse fits the vibe too

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): more of a mazda person myself

**frogaranaman** (7): why does Pa always sounds like he’s fighting with the beat

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): it's so fucked up that there's a car company called honda and an entirely different one called hyundai

**plastichaxan** (10): Okay while I have the issue with this being way too short what we do get is incredible. The drum and bass and just the speed it goes too hard I kinda need more of this sound from her wow

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): SHY GUY definitely has a sizeable hive of supporters, which explains why it performed so well as an interlude. While song is pleasant to me, I'm really only listening to it as an appetizer to Bouncin, and nothing else. (It's why the length doesn't bother me personally). I know drum n bass has more popularity across the pond and many have brought up pinkpantheress comparisons in their comments, but signs seems to point to Tinashe tackling more of this sound in the future so who knows? Maybe a full length dnb-Nashe song is on its way.

**jman457** (8.3): I really liked this, but like… yeah wish it were longer

---

# Yes!!!

**shipperondeck** (8.2): this can make day 2! right! right!!!!!!!

# Nearly every comment was about the length

**throwaway-7650** (11): she's going to hell for making this only a minute long like bffr rn

**aquariuszns** (10): need to snort this interlude like its ket omg it wouldve been way too powerful as a full song…

**oscarbrierley1** (10): still waiting on an extended version. jungle slay

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (10): Why is this so short? UGH. I love it though.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): [original thought voice]: WHY is this so SHORT?

**DaHumanTorch** (8.8): we were SO robbed of a full song on the deluxe it'll haunt me forever

**alexismateofan** (8): It’s a minute long and I just wish it was more but also it’s a DAMN good minute. Like last minute on earth kinda song.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is musical blue balls. Making a song this good 66 seconds needs to be a criminal offense

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): full version when

**TiltControls** (8): The fact that this isn't longer is criminal

**-mczrv-** (7.8): LOVE the production and vibe just wish it were longer :'(

**bogo** (7): WHY IS THIS SO FUCKING SHORT GOD DAMN IT

**impla77** (7): why isnt this longerr tinashe

**lexiaredery** (7): this is so good, but the length makes it hard for me to give a higher score :(

**Lynflower680** (6): Maybe if it was a little longer I would’ve liked it a little more. The 90s techno production is a big plus though.

**pig-serpent** (5): I love breakbeats but even with them it's hard to deny how much this feels like the introduction of a song that's going to hit a drop or open up into a different beat and instead just ends after one minute. Extremely close to being my favorite song on here.

**UselessTacooo** (4): this song being so short is actually my 9/11

# Though we did have some contrarians

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this song is the perfect length akshully, in this essay i will-

**moonshxne** (10): it's the perfect length fight me

**qazz23** (9): i like 1 minute songs, especially when they have good vocals and synths

# Either that, or about Mario

**Awkward\_King** (10): https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/nintendo/images/e/e1/ShyGuy.PNG/revision/latest?cb=20110929231546&path-prefix=en

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): short but so sweet. insert mario joke here

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): sounds amazing, but i kinda wish she expanded upon it more. Reminds me of video games which the title also hints at. Tinashe is trying to live in the MOMENT but these shy guys are taking too much time!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uh7oR1XRHlY This gets an extra point for reminding me of one of my favorite videos on the internet.

**vexastrae** (7.5): i didnt watch the mario movie did tinashe voice a shy guy in it

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): Me even I'm asked about my favorite Mario franchise enemy

**frogaranaman** (7): goated Nintendo character

**JIRACHI** (7): best nintendo character

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Yoshi liked this song

**seanderlust** (6.5): the yoshiphobia :pensive:

**welcome2thejam** (6): I mean if you told me this was a really solid remix of some Nintendo console menu music I'd believe you

# The guy’s a liar

**amr** (10): a little tribute to her halfrican cousin pinkpantheress

**nt96** (10): her pinkpantheress serve, mainly cuz of the length lol

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we need pinkpantheress feature on this beat STAT

**jackisboredtoday** (9.1): a one minute song with some UK garage influence in the production?? oh this really is the pinkpantheressprint huh

# Shygirl remix when

**afs** (7): papi bones its your turn to respond

**CrimsonROSET** (7): where shygirl

**uberpigeon** (6): its shy GIRL actually. and she should have been in this rate.

# The other guys

**akanewasright** (10): I need more drum n bass influenced Tinashe so bad you have no idea…

**freeofblasphemy** (10): We never got Tinashe x Sophie and it upsets me so

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is what elevator music will sound like in 150 years

**Stryxen** (10): she heard the Velvet rope once and needed to fuck the closest instrument and this came out

**WaneLietoc** (10): really glad we finally got back on the late 90s, pre-9/11 2k timeline where pop, high bpm drum machines, and "the idea of soul" are back...for a minute!

**Nagisoid** (9): Both this and pamplemousse are such fierce queens

**runaway3212** (9): interludephobia when I catch you

**1998tweety** (7): an icon

**jasannn** (7): maybe they're a grower, not a shower

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Feels weird to hear a drum-n’-bass track with no actual bass. Even if this is just an interlude, I would love to hear Tinashe on a proper liquid DNB track in the future. (EDIT: She's apparently working with Machinedrum for her next album, so her Love You Good is definitely coming!)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): not the breakcore drums loop

**ss2811** (6): its cute

**horridhendy** (5): It's okay

**IIIHenryIII** (5): you know another word that also rhymes with guy? five

**beeozan** (1): these drums sound so weak

**cremeebrulee** (10): jealousy was *Caprisongs*'s second and last single, but also easily one of the mixtape's highlights. The song is a dedication to twigs' heritage, with is Afrobeats-inspired sound, Jamaican imagery in the music video, and feature from Nigerian singer, Rema. The song is smooth, catchy, and honestly robbed of being in a higher spot! I don't know if this is a victim of popheads' misandry, but Rema's verse here flows so well it's no wonder than executive producer El Guincho immediately scouted him for the second verse. At least he’s outcharting every other artist in the rate here ig…

**plastichaxan** (9): “I just wanna go outside” Me everyday since I quit my job I really can’t stand being at home any more

**jman457** (7.6): good afro beat track

---

# the actual Gen Z / Millennial divide

**uberpigeon** (7): olivia rodrigo outsold

**beeozan** (6.5): roisin murphy outsold

# Rema fan club

**cocosairdep** (10): I want this man so bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): selena gomez ur OVA (the way this is about Slow Down and not jealousy from whatever is going on with Hailey Bieber. I care about the afrobeats genre, I don’t give a fuck about those white people Justin and Hailey)

**Frajer** (10): hi Rema

**alexismateofan** (9): Rema being one of the better features on the album, congratulations on stepping over the very low bar.

**ss2811** (8): rema did his thing on here

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.7): Love the cozy albeit slightly distant piano here with Rema and twigs' voices melding together in the last hook being my fav part

# Envious people

**akanewasright** (10): This being slammed on release was kind of embarrassing for popheads… like tell us how you really feel about African musical styles

**Ambrosia42** (10): the vibes are immaculate

**CrimsonROSET** (10): my goal this rate is to not internalize male features and i think its working

**IIIHenryIII** (10): …of people who got to know this one before me

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I'm floating. 11 contenda

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): one of the first friends i made at uni put this song into her DJ mix because i liked it so i have to give it a ten <3

**vexastrae** (10): girlypopcore if it was baptized during golden hour

**WaneLietoc** (9.2): this was really good with a chickpea sandwich.

**ReallyCreative** (9): slay tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): jealousy is kinda hot girl shit

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): remembering the collab video superfruit did with shoshana bean in like 2015 where they covered jealous by nick jonas in a pop music musical. idk

**jasannn** (8.5): oh its the calm down guy

**1998tweety** (8): bopping a bit

**horridhendy** (8): Yeah, this is good - of course it's a single. Lol. I'm so predictable.

**saviorARMY101** (8): it's honestly a bop

**shipperondeck** (8): i used to like this more i think

# You in your feelings way too deep

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): There’s almost something comforting about features as mid as Rema’s

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): how can she go from experimental baddie to yawning generic radio (she does it good though)

**bogo** (7): kinda the weakest full song here but still good

**afs** (6.5): real (2)

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): I love their lack of energy, go girls give us nothing!

**Lynflower680** (6): When I first heard this song I saw who the featuring artist was and it took me a moment to realize “oh wait Rema is the guy who made the Calm Down song that’s so cool” lmao

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): enjoyable but not outstanding

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (5): This song's hook annoys me. Nope, not for me.

**qazz23** (4.5): not digging the vocals on this, not as catchy as the others

**Nagisoid** (4): The fear of MOTHER will be studied in-depth in the future

**runaway3212** (4): meh

**cremeebrulee** (11): Part of me was hellbent on 11ing a *Caprisongs* track; I had just done a writeup on it earlier this year and I thought there was more merit to awarding a more serious song. But a bigger part of me just wanted to listen to this song and shake my ass :shrug: As time went on, I realize there was NO way this wasn't my 11. House-nashe was something I didn't know I needed until I heard it, but considering how strong her dancing skills are, it's not shocking she would kill a dancier track. Plus Channel Tres' voice will get me weak in the knees every time. This song is dark, sexy, addictive, and the end bit where it slows down is my favorite musical moment of 2022 bar none. I definitely knew I made the right choice considering how hurt I got seeing this place so low...

**plastichaxan** (10): A new classic I’ve literally played this at every house party/listening to music session I’ve been two since we announced the rate like !! Y’all did this too dirty

**jman457** (9.5): sexy House Track

**frogaranaman** (8): I definitely will hit up Channel Tres for a good time

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Channel Tres GET BEHIND ME

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me when I have a 2 liter of soda and a single bag of chips at home.

**Lynflower680** (10): BET YOU WANNA BE A FRIEND OF ME

**oscarbrierley1** (10): the demo of this that leaked is cute, but this is such a slay. hoping for more housenashe on her next album.

**Stryxen** (10): pussy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is such a banger and easily my fave deluxe track. i got so into it last summer (i'm in the southern hemisphere lol) and i would play it for everyone everytime there was a party. i understand why it isn't on the main album but i wish it was ngl

**throwaway-7650** (10): cunt

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): this is vogue but for the bathroom stall graffiti community

**UselessTacooo** (10): yeah girl keep this sound I’m begging (Broke my heart to not give this my 11, sadly channel tres makes my blood boil)

**vexastrae** (10): the bass is FATTTT on this one

**WaneLietoc** (10): yo yo yo hit my line for a cheesy time 760-745-5555!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): this song didn't hit until I was driving in the city at night with this blasting and then I *got* it

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): I hear this beat and her vocals and I'm stanning right away

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Two words: CLUB. BANGER. (p.s. "Heavy metal on me like Slipknot" is such a dope bar)

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): Involuntary head boppin' rearing it's head for round 3

**freeofblasphemy** (8): HEAVY METAL LIKE SLIPKNOT

**Nagisoid** (8): STREAM JUICE

**qazz23** (8): a bit repetitive but has a good dancey sound

**saviorARMY101** (8): I overplayed this song when it first came out so I'm kinda sick of it but it's still a bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): can someone turn the bass down even the TINIEST amount please

**welcome2thejam** (8): I want to see Tinashe wearing a Slipknot mask

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): we need the Tinashe house album

# Bet you wanna be an enemy of me

**seanderlust** (7.2): wait i'm sorry, she's mixing tequila with hennessey? that sounds vile tbh

**bogo** (7): it's really fun for the first half and then nothing else happens

**JIRACHI** (7): I do not like that feature oh at all

**ss2811** (7): enjoyed it

**afs** (6): debatable

**horridhendy** (5.5): The mixing on this is terrible. Tinashe sounds like she recorded this from the other room. But yeah, the song itself is fine.

**Ambrosia42** (5): a cool vibe, but it doesn’t really go anywhere? I don’t particularly enjoy whatever effect was done with Tinashe’s vocals either?

**runaway3212** (5): left of the original for a reason

**alexismateofan** (4): now what’s this basic ass club beat going on here

**moonshxne** (3.6): no >:(

**cremeebrulee** (10): And the robberies do not let up! twigs loses her incredible opening track next, a sultry, playful, and an incredibly self-aware number. ride the dragon has twigs playing with her audience and their perception of her. With all the worries about *Caprisongs* being her sell-out record, twigs assures us that she's still that elusive, mystical artist that we have loved for years. I found this song so dazzling and hypnotic on release; I had listened to it on loop for so long that I neglected the rest of the mixtape dsfgdfs It would easily be an 11 contender for me, but its performance in the rate has never been anything extraordinary.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is such an incredible opening. You made ME a mixtape??? You’re still that mysterious bitch??? The change in sound for miss Twigs??? She’s taking it

**jman457** (7.5): Nice intro track, but wish there was more

---

# Really wanna kiss these raters

**Awkward\_King** (10): twigs was terrorising the streets of london filming the videos for the caprimami rollout in 2022. you could not step outside without seeing her surrounded by dancers wiggling her arms in a bizarre way. want to go to the park? she's there. getting the tube? she's at peckham rye. going into central? they're filming the ride the dragon video.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "do it quickly 'fore the end of this song" is so fucking passionate and I love nothing more than a good pining song

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I've had [a redacted number of] people text me word-for-word "are you ever going to kiss me?" twigs would HATE me

**WaneLietoc** (10): 'hol up twigs i gotta smoke a bowl real quick...oh u made ME a mixtape?! an actual yellow tape i can listen to on my walkman!?! damn that atlantic money WAS worth it. anyways this imo feels like the first real "post-immediate pandemic era" pop banger. It promised that it was for me and dared me to kiss my boo b4 the end of the song. I did smoke that bowl b4 the end of the song.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): rah, rah

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): It’s nice to hear Twigs’ lovely voice and production without sobbing or something. This is a great introduction into the vibe of the album, and it seems like it could be a mixtape made to cheer up a friend or something which is cute

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): idk why but if you told me this sampled some extremely online cult favorite video game music i’d believe u

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (9): I forgot how good this was. Great start.

**saviorARMY101** (9): oh that beat drop was sick

**ss2811** (9): love this as the intro it’s so haunting but also beautiful

**vexastrae** (9): me when i buy a knot toy from amazon dot com

**moonshxne** (8.8): so effortlessly

**alexismateofan** (8): Those dragons sure are being imagined.

**auntiegay2** (8): Get in loser we’re riding the dragon

**CrimsonROSET** (8): is this about that big ass dildo

**flava** (8): it took me about 6 months to actually get through this album because of how moist that intro is

**Nagisoid** (8): Weaving a mixtape... with every crossfade

**qazz23** (8): good opener, i like the inserting the 📼 sound at the start

**Stryxen** (8): why do i just know grimes loves this song

**throwaway-7650** (8): [chainsmokers voice] hey.

**uberpigeon** (8): much like i can see the future... this song title is kinda wasted on this song. but its kind of cute

**afs** (7.5): unfortunately no dragons were ridden in the making of this record

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): once the song finnally gets going its kinda fun.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): her scalie era I’m sick

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): the euphoria I get from “ride the dragon **HAWWWWW**” cannot be put into words

**1998tweety** (7): the dragon = zhongli

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): "I'm still that mysterious bitch" is the best opening line out there

**horridhendy** (7): It took a couple of listens but this has grown on me.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it's a little chill bop

**welcome2thejam** (7): When Donkey from Shrek is feeling extra frisky:

# Not the target audience of twigs’ mixtape

**beeozan** (6.5): is it bad that the dragon im thinking of doesnt have wings or scales

**Lynflower680** (6.5): Kinda left me a bit underwhelmed ngl

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Really want to iike this more than I do. It’s got a few ideas up is sleeve, sure. But I’m kind of at a loss for what exactly it’s supposed to amount to. Is this supposed to be a steamy song? A cute one? A weird one? it’s not a total flop but yeah not a great kickoff

**runaway3212** (5): easily my favourite opener in this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): there are good ideas in this song but i am so violently turned off to any song that puts in those slowed and reverbed vibes in it and that outro completely takes me out of it

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): admittedly one of my least favorites and one of the reasons i had trouble getting into the record. it's grown on me a bit but i wanted a bit more oomph from a twigs song with that title

**plastichaxan** (10): SER UNA POP STAR NUNCA TE DURA! Con sólo esa línea se ganó un gran 10, increíble

**jman457** (8.8): really pretty ending that feels so intimate.

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): I really love the lyrics on this track and choosing to end both versions of your album on the ephemerality of fame really emphasizes how important that theme is to the project. It's another of one of those tracks that I wish I could score higher on a relisten, but it did do well for itself as one of the slower *Motomami* songs.

# [**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is my one ‘do the anime rate’ comment for this rate](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/135wz9l/anime_openingthemes_rate/)

**impla77** (10): starting to think rosalia should do anime rate

**Nagisoid** (9): What is this Cardcaptor erasure?

**vexastrae** (7.5): she really loves japan huh

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): Sakura?? What a weeb smh

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Sakura Ogami you will always be famous

**RandomHypnotica** (4.1): Sakura AND Hentai on the same album? Oh yeah she's definitely a weeb

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): something something do the anime rate

# Pretty like Sakura flowers

**akanewasright** (10): if this wasn’t a rate with two of my other favorite albums of the decade so far, I’d be a goofball and 11 this. Rosalía just always nails a final track for me, and this… fuck. I love her voice so much

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Rosalia: “Bеing a popstar never lasts” PHCJ: Rosalia poor

**JIRACHI** (10): this is so good if only it was actually a live performance

**runaway3212** (10): give us the ballad album actually

**saviorARMY101** (10): What a beautiful song with a great symbolic message to end the album

**throwaway-7650** (10): stream antifragile

**UselessTacooo** (10): ate (the cherries)

**WaneLietoc** (10): SING GIRL SING!!!!

**welcome2thejam** (10): The "live? in concert" gimmick is honestly working for me, think it works well with the whole "popstars are fleeting" thing

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): the vocals and lyrics are gorgeous and the production handles it just right

**alexismateofan** (9): Very little hiding her voice, it shines SO brightly here in this song. Love the comparisons to both flowers and fire. Hot damn.

**bigmojoshit** (9): her vocals are so beautiful

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Sakura’s stan assemble

**ReallyCreative** (9): my favorite restaurant in my hometown omg

**ss2811** (9): her vocals are just ungodly here

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.2): Including the live recording version of it is better than if it was a studio one, tbh

**beeozan** (8): I like how this still is the closer in the deluxe version

**freeofblasphemy** (8): This album is so good when it wants to be

**ignitethephoenix** (8): is this live??? Edit: no it’s not

**Lynflower680** (8): Feels other-worldly. Nice closing song

**Stryxen** (8): Her producer yelled “CONQUISTADOR” but she heard “CUNT QUEEN SERVE MORE!!” and that’s exactly what she did

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): I probably would’ve been harsher on this awhile ago but now that crowd noise & reverb at the beginning reminds me of Coachella so i’m like slay

**1998tweety** (7): we love sakura

**afs** (7): cute end

# These raters’ scores will never last

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): elise outsold i can't lie

**bogo** (6): it's fine

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's pretty but not much about it stands out to me

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Uh okay?

**horridhendy** (4.5): Honestly, I could have done without the faux concert effects on this song. It just makes it exponetially worse to me. I don't hate the actual song but it's a skip for that reason.

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i wish i could appreciate this as the really grandiose closer that im sure it is but it doesnt do a whole lot for me

**oscarbrierley1** (2): feels hours long, it just never gets going

**jman457** (10): It was already a beautiful Trad pop pastiche and then the Soulja boy interlude?!?!

**plastichaxan** (10): I love boleros, they feel like such a part of my culture and older generations of my family and seeing her transform it this way and getting that Soulja Boy sample in?? Incredible

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): I was already in love with this and then the Soulja Boy part comes in [10000+] I'm not really sure what we want from Rosalía because if she does a straightforward ballad, we eliminate it but if she does something interesting, we also eliminate it ...

---

# YOUUUUUUUUUUUU

**akanewasright** (10): I really do love the mix of the “moto” and “mami” side throughout the album… like she sings this gorgeous Justo Betancourt song and then throws in the soulja boy sample

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Soulja Boy rate winner I like the sound of that.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the lyrics to this (well, the English translation) rule. So dramatic and vivid. Love the horns as well. then the soujla boy cameo lmao

**seanderlust** (10): DAMN IT'S RIDICULOUS I GOT YOU SO DELIRIOUS KISS ME THROUGH THE PHONE WHILE I LICK YOU JUST LIKE LICORICE :yellingkirby:

**UselessTacooo** (9.9): why is Soulja Boy continuously being sampled on pop girlies critically acclaimed albums released in March with 16 songs

**nt96** (9): pretty good cover, the Soulja Boy sample was a clever touch.

**alexismateofan** (8): The Delirious sample took me by surprise but honestly? It works. It’s a vibe baby!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (8): this sample is actually so unserious it makes me ctfu

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): Goofy sample but it works

**vexastrae** (8): SOULJA BOY TELL EMMMMMM

**Ambrosia42** (7.6): a cover that fits in with the themes of the album, and then what i didn’t realize was a soulja boy sample

**afs** (7.5): the soulja sample is so funny

**qazz23** (8): good cover w/ the sample

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): can't believe we rate soulja boy again later this year

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Vocals. Soulja Boy?

**DaHumanTorch** (6): the random soulja boy is so funny

**welcome2thejam** (6): Paused the song thirty seconds in because I read ahead on the Genius translation and saw there's a Soulja Boy section in here so I needed a moment to regain my bearings. Oh that was less than I thought. Disappointing. Liked the horns though

**Nagisoid** (5): She was actually delusional for thinking she could cover Betancourt well, especially by adding Soulja Boy ontop

# Grand

**horridhendy** (10): UGH I'm sorry but this album is so good.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I’ve always had a soft spot in my heart for Spanish, Mexican, most traditional Latin music in general, and this album just highlights how great it actually is

**WaneLietoc** (9.1): HAWTER THAN DA SUN

**auntiegay2** (9): We need to revive Divas Live ASAP.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this mv feels like it should end in a gorgeous mansion getting caught on fire but in a cunty way

**saviorARMY101** (9): I honestly love the juxtaposition between the vintage sounding bolero instrumental at the beginning and the sample of a modern rap song towards the end

**-mczrv-** (8.1): that switch up really does something for me

**beeozan** (8): how does this song make the backing rapping man work

**oscarbrierley1** (8): this makes me feel the same way as watching an artsy movie. like i think i enjoyed it, but im not quite sure how to feel.

**bogo** (7.5): a little fun, would like it better if it was structured better though. in fact a lot of the songs on this album really don't seem structured all that well

**pig-serpent** (7.5): I love the classic bossa nova sound juxtaposed with the repetitive rap bar.

**moonshxne** (7.3): quaint

**ss2811** (7): a really strong song with links to flamenco roots i loved this one as an ode to rosalia’s native country of catalan

# Delusional

**runaway3212** (7): it's okay

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): just a tad forgettable i won't lie

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Well, it’s interesting…

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): this is nice but doesn't stand out to me

**plastichaxan** (10): Kinda glad King saw the vision (lol) and this got a deserved 11, slightly robbed tbh

**jman457** (9): really showcases the song really well, great title track

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): If there was doubt about Tinashe fitting into this rate, this track is what I would use as justification. This is the twig-iest Tinashe has ever sounded, and probably the most experimental song on the *333*; I find it interesting that this is the title track, even when a lot of the album doesn’t sound like this. I’ll confess that all the parts of this song do not work for me. I find it a little messy but I respect Tinashe for trying something different here.

---

# Aqua-songs??

**Frajer** (11): dick so good you make dolphin noises , I'm aware this also describes Twigs

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): I think there's been a mistake, pretty sure this is a twigs song

# My 333rd Century Blues

**throwaway-7650** (10): RAYE?

**DaHumanTorch** (9.3): raye having one sided beef with her over this was so embarassing 😭

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): Excellent harmonies in here, the light drill elements are pretty dope. (My original comment ended with me saying “Absolutely’s vocals remind me a lot of RAYE” and it turns out she’s literally RAYE’s sister??? What?!)

# [Not that friend being me omg](https://i.imgflip.com/73kb0j.jpg?a467928)

**akanewasright** (9.5): I looped this song while having an anxiety attack during an uber ride to a Tinashe concert where I was going to meet up with a friend and then Tinashe didn’t even play the song

# 11 11 11

**Awkward\_King** (11): the day after the album came out i was getting the train into london to see heathers with my best friend and everytime i listen to this album but specifically this song it reminds me of that and it's just a really nice memory. i'm not really sure why i love this song so much but it really works for me! it's so fluid and constantly changing, the feature is a great addition and its just really pretty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): 101010

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): why can’t this be h&m-core music….imagine how disoriented a bunch of iced coffee-drinking twentysomething would be when this comes on

**impla77** (10): I love how silence is utilised in this song.. john cage wishes

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (10): ARTPOP.

**UselessTacooo** (10): who tf is absolutely I’ve been searching for her for years

**WaneLietoc** (10): keep pitch fucking da voice into a gospel choir god this shit is based!!!!!

**amr** (9.9): decimal off cos there's never a valid reason to have a british person on Ur title track grow up

**saviorARMY101** (9.5): Honestly this song sends me to whole other dimension

**1998tweety** (9): this song is kinda all over the place but its good

**Ambrosia42** (9): This song seems to continue the themes from previous songs. It seems like she is having an almost heavenly or out-of-body experience because of the love she is receiving from someone, but there are these dark undertones as well (“it costs me time and time again, I’ve lost my friends, but now and then / I feel like you’re heaven-sent, so stay with me until the end”). In reality this person is not heaven sent, and it seems like her reality is much darker than this heavenly, imagined reality. I love how the song shifts so much into different unique sounds. She also references the sun again and time passing. This song really drives home for me how technology and love can be sources of escapism, and while the moment of escape can be almost heavenly, you’re abandoning the rest of your life and things you could possibly be doing to make it better.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): she put her whole 333ussy into this or something

**freeofblasphemy** (9): Just absolutely stunning. Could totally be indulgent “ooh look how experimental”-style art pop but it’s got such a vulnerability about it while also not falling into a navel-gazing lyrical trap

**Lynflower680** (9): ABSOLUTELY absolutely (heh) killed her verse. Everything about the song is ethereal.

**pig-serpent** (9): I feel confident calling this the most interesting song on 333.

**qazz23** (9): sing like a choir oohOoohhh

**shipperondeck** (9): absolutely totally sounds like raye haha. wait

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): look i added them together

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): The "Ooh, ooh"'s are doing something to my brain. Oh what da hell with these last 45 seconds (complimentary)???

**afs** (8): eeee3333333333333333333eeeeeeeee

**alexismateofan** (8): Tinashe you could have made this song 3:33 long, what happened art girly pop?

**IIIHenryIII** (8): (?) sorry, I’m bad at math

**ReallyCreative** (8): the mark of the devil but only on his mother’s side:

**bigbigbee** (7): little devil that Excel thinks is a number and not text ohhhhhh you are RUINING my spreadsheet

**jasannn** (7): I’m always stunned by the switch-up but I’m afraid it doesn’t stick the landing.

**Nagisoid** (7): ABSOLUTELY's verse is literally me

**ss2811** (7): love the transition on this

**runaway3212** (6.5): her experimental moment

**beeozan** (6): overambitious song but its kinda boppin cant hate too much

# 0 0 0

**welcome2thejam** (6): 666

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): i enjoy parts of this songs and then it changes lol

**indie\_fan\_** (4.8): this just happened to be the rate where i don't really like a single one of the title tracks

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I was hopeful at first, but this idea could have stayed in the drafts. Can’t stand her vocals here

**ImADudeDuh** (4): she named the album after THIS song?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): ohhh i get it. its three songs in one thats why its called 333

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): look I wish I could say I was doing this for the “hehe funny 333 song gets a 3” but did she chug helium before recording this because she sounds squeakier than Mickey Mouse

**horridhendy** (0): There's like 4 songs in this one song and they're all awful. This song wavers between boring and annoying, which is just the worst. The screechy vocals at the very beginning make me want to tear my ears off. Also, the "spoken word" bit is just horrible.

**cremeebrulee** (10): One of my favorite “genre” of songs is the chiller, lowkey flex song (think: Reminder by The Weeknd, Glamorous by Fergie, etc.) and this slots in there nicely. Rosalía and Tokischa are also an unstoppable duo, with this and Linda showcasing their musical chemistry perfectly. Also that breakdown at the end ugh, this is truly one of my fave *MOTOMAMI* tracks, I wish I've seen it get talked about more often!

**plastichaxan** (10): This and Linda are such cultural resets their combination just flows amazingly. I kinda wanted this to do better we need more Tokischa appreciation in the world

**jman457** (8.7): This bopped yet felt still so ethereal.

**plastichaxan** (8): The lyrics give me such a sense of nostalgia and the music bops it makes me kinda dance like that clip of Scarlett Johansson doing her white lady dance in Marriage Story (2019)

**jman457** (7): dragged a little

**cremeebrulee** (6): Balladphobia hits me here since I don't enjoy this song too much. I find the chorus a little grating and it definitely drags for me personally. However, this song got a lot of love from raters—  it had a brief stint in Day 3, thought it makes its eventual placement here.

# And what about it?

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): hosts giving the most dramatic extensions because we're desperate for ballots

**beeozan** (7): reject extensions, embrace last call for ballot submissions

# Pouring their hearts into their scores

**indie\_fan\_** (11): she rarely misses with ballads to me

**akanewasright** (10): The power ballad section of the album slays so hard I couldn’t believe it…

**alexismateofan** (10): I’m always into a really sad break up song with a beautiful melody behind it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): we needed this song on the boygenius album this year

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): my finger slipped and I accidentally added an extra “0” to my score. Hell yeah, this is a 100/10

**oscarbrierley1** (10): the melody really shows off her angellic vocals

**saviorARMY101** (10): Her vocals is so beautiful and emotional in that chorus

**seanderlust** (10): come on 6/8!!!

**throwaway-7650** (10): I'm sorry, the old taylor can't come to the phone right now. why?

**TiltControls** (10): This was my early album favourite, and while others have grown on me quite a bit more it's still an easy 10

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): I love the melodies and the lyrics…i am ascending. The writing on this song is so gorgeous and heartbreaking. She has finally come to terms with the fact that the relationship is over, that things aren’t good, that it’s for the best to end things. But even when it’s for the best, that doesn’t mean it doesn’t hurt incredibly. She feels like she was something her lover USED to feel better rather than a human being, and this is the last mf call so they better enjoy their last drink. This is the emotional centerpiece of the album for me, and a point of reckoning.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): You don’t have to go home, but you can’t…stay…here. I KNOW WHO I W-gets dragged off stage

**IIIHenryIII** (9): catchy as hell

**qazz23** (9): love the powerful vocals on the chorus

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): vocals. strings. what else do you need

**welcome2thejam** (9): Damn, some good heartbreaking stuff

**horridhendy** (8.5): Another really good track. the bridge is great. The middle of this album is kinda fire or is that just because the first 8 tracks were so mid?

**sarcasticsobs** (8.5): Aw, nuts, now I'm sad two songs in a row

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Has a bit of a “coulda been a bonus track” vibe to it, but it’s also just such a good stage-setting for the marvel just around the corner

**ReallyCreative** (8): the one thing about this album, she has like 5 songs that are either titled or sound like they should be the closer lol

**runaway3212** (8): her not putting this as the last song she's so funny

**WaneLietoc** (8): this song sounds like you should be crying into a big 'ol cuppa joe, a pastrami rueben, and small gumbo bowl. my 2am last call is exactly this meal and it is soul food

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): pub vibes

**afs** (7): is it ever really the last call

# Last place

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh alright

**Nagisoid** (7): Shitty mobile data anthem

**ss2811** (7): vocals are amazing

**aquariuszns** (6.5): cute but eh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): i liked this on first listen and then got over it super quick

**cremeebrulee** (9.9): Kinda wondering why my dumbass gave this a 9.9 rather than the 10 it deserves damn... I'm not surprised that I loved this song on release, considering that it was a *Songs For You* outtake. The lyrics feel really in line with the melodrama and heartache of that album, but the dancier production with those glitchy bleeps lets it feel at home on *333* too. Definitely a standout on the record, it's sad to let this go so close to Day 3, but glad it was able to break an 8.000+ average. (I also wished the graph kinda went down slowly for the shitpost potential, but it's pretty uninteresting).

**jman457** (8.6): Like the dance background on this, gives me Kelela vibes

**plastichaxan** (8): Me seeing popheads’ comments on this song: /j ofc, I appreciate all ballots.

# [Who the hell is this](https://youtu.be/L1QAcv2GSwA)

**ImADudeDuh** (9): suck it alec benjamin

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Alec Benjamin remains unbothered

**beeozan** (7.5): wasnt this a white man song

# Let Me Raise My Scores Quickly

**akanewasright** (10): glitchy Tinashe rules so much oml

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): When another rater has to break it to me that they 0'ed my 11.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): tinasheception https://rave.dj/G_3MVCsLog-q_Q

**Frajer** (10): Sam Sparro put his whole black and gold into this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is my poor little meow meow and I am begging for her to make Day 2 at any cost

**shipperondeck** (10): woeis woeis woeis woeis woeis w

**throwaway-7650** (10): not the genius bio for this song just saying it leaked

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): i am addicted to this song. the vocal loop is like crack to me

**WaneLietoc** (10): she really is trying to perfect some 1999-2000 shit i guess

**aquariuszns** (9.5): insaneeeeeeee

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): LOVE the flourishes on this one's production. Lyrics made me go : (

**Ambrosia42** (9.3): the Sam Sparro print! This is the moment when you are starting to realize the relationship was bad or that it’s never going to come back or be what it was, but you just can’t let go. It’s that feeling of powerlessness where you feel like the other person needs to do something to ease your pain, but you want to be able to handle it yourself. You want to focus on the present and move on, but you keep getting stuck on this person. It’s a beautiful track that makes me wanna cry and dance again.

**1998tweety** (9): this is so good but it could've been an 11 if the chorus had an extra kick in it

**alexismateofan** (9): Oh she’s taking it.

**Nagisoid** (9): I always remember the silly CUPID TikTok song when I listen to this and it kinda stops this from being a 10

**pig-serpent** (9): That bass slaps, and I love the staticy rhythm in my left ear.

**qazz23** (9): certainly not a let down, love the faster beats in the second half

**afs** (8.5): this cleanses my memory of that... thing

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Oh hey Sam Sparro did this beat? I don’t know much about him other than the name of that one song (which I can’t remember how it goes), but this beat and (song) absolutely rule. Kick drums never sound this good

**Awkward\_King** (8): me when im up high and its kinda scary

**CrimsonROSET** (8): huh she kinda fizzled

**horridhendy** (8): Okay, so the middle of this album is pretty great.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this was a big grower for me

# Let Tinashe Down Slowly

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): when this leaked pre album release i didnt love it and i was worried that the album would sound similar. luckily it turned out to be kind of middle of my album ranking.

**runaway3212** (7): kinda nothing but like it's still tinashe so

**uberpigeon** (7): la roux outsold

**ss2811** (6): strong track

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): it was boring

**cremeebrulee** (10): Our last elimination of Day 2 and it's... this? somehow? Naturally was hovering on the border of today and tomorrow for some time, but I'm really surprised that /this/ was the song that was pushed over. Maybe this is some of our deluxe-phobia appearing again, since this officially knocks all of *333*'s bonus tracks out. Regardless, this is just a solid, groovy pop tune, definitely worthy of a spot on the standard album. She ended Selena with ease, but also not a hard feat to do since I 0'd that in winners oop

**plastichaxan** (8.5): The Selena comments are kinda not original after reading some but like… This is not the superior Naturally (it’s still great)

**jman457** (7.3): rip selegend

---

# Gone, but never forgotten

**runaway3212** (10): when this wins and u/selegend comes back to life

**Awkward\_King** (9): selegend died for this

**ReallyCreative** (8): shoutouts to selegend

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): selegend’s influence knows no bounds

**beeozan** (7): someone check in on u /tinashero quick

**CrimsonROSET** (7): will this cause a selegend

**Nagisoid** (7): SELEGEND GET BEHIND ME

# It comes naturally baby

**1998tweety** (9): ended that fad selena

**IIIHenryIII** (7): sorry, but Salina’s can’t be outsold

**jasannn** (6.5): she’s no Selena

**seanderlust** (6.5): she wants to be selena gomez and the scene soooooo bad

# Everyone else loved this song, we cheered

**akanewasright** (10): GODDD this song is so fucking good like… this might be the smoothest song she’s ever put out, and the best bassline she’s ever had

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): 2:13 in the music video - me when I’m experiencing the biological process of menstruation.

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this is citypop

**JIRACHI** (10): this singlehandedly saved the deluxe tracks

**Lynflower680** (10): I can’t explain it SHE’S VERY GORGEOUS TO ME

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I'll take "unnecessarily violent music video" for 800 Alex

**sarcasticsobs** (10): We have our first encounter of VOLUNTARY head boppin', full control of my body at this moment. Groovy stuff

**saviorARMY101** (10): BANGER

**Ambrosia42** (9.7): i just wanna gyrate like

**shipperondeck** (9.5): used to be a 10 but got majorlyyyy overplayed (my bad)

**TiltControls** (9.5): Easily the strongest of the extra tracks in the rate. Could've been competing with the rest of the main album tracks

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): so dreamy :comfy:

**throwaway-7650** (9): this song grew on me like a hangnail [non-derogatory]

**uberpigeon** (9): all it takes for me is a light peppering of groovy bass

**WaneLietoc** (8.6): slick fit

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Tinashe can write sex jams til the end of time for all I care

**horridhendy** (8.5): Oh, so this album picks up again. This is really good.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): amazing bridge. the video is so bizzare and iconic.

**ss2811** (8): bopppp

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): i've ALWAYS been a natural... what i DON'T do is try try try

**afs** (7.5): organic queen

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): i enjoyed this for a few listens but got over it pretty quickly

**alexismateofan** (7): I had to listen to this song a few times more than normal to pick my score for it which is almost never good because it means I have way too many feelings on it. Let’s give it a safe-ish score and go on.

**vexastrae** (7): the texas chainsaw massacre inspired mv kinda slays like
