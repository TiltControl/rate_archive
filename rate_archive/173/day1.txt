Eclectic Artpop Rate Reveal Day 1: Abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/13smz8d/eclectic_artpop_rate_reveal_day_1/

Welcome ~~[internet losers](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1067127345359630477/1111458793461657641/Screen_Shot_2023-05-20_at_5.46.02_PM.png?width=2591&height=424)~~ raters to the first day of the Eclectic Artpop (or better known as 333Caprimami) reveal!  Over a month ago, we asked you to score songs from Tinashe's *333*, FKA twigs' *Caprisongs*, and Rosalía's *Motomami* and now we'll finally get to see how they all stacked up against each other. 

Today, my co-hosts /u/plastichaxan, /u/jman457, and I will be revealing what placed **#58 - #39** in our main rate. We'll began eliminating songs at **5PM EST** or about an hour after this post goes up. Be sure to join us in the [**Queup room**](https://www.queup.net/join/caprimami333) where we will be listening to the songs as they go out, with some fun bonus content as well. If you can't make it to the Queup, we'll be hanging around in this thread and on the [#rates channel on the Popheads discord](https://discord.gg/popheads) so feel free to join us there!

**cremeebrulee** (10): I will defend keeping this in idc! Unlike twigs, Rosalía only had this one interlude on her standard album so we didn’t think it would hurt her *too* much if it was kept in. Plus the alphabet motif is thematically consistent, since this follows CUUUUuuuuuute on the tracklist. Rates can always use a bit of chaos and seeing how high the average on this could go was one of the funnest parts of running results. I still wish it was breaking a 5.000+ like it was at some point, but even then this never left last place.

**plastichaxan** (10): I thought y’all would like fun more and give this a higher controversy so I was excited to see y’all react to this but maybe it was a mistake I’m so sorry Rosalía I’ll add you right below Lido Pimienta in the list of artists I screwed over in an internet game :(

**jman457** (4.8): Ok gayle, but yeah she is just speaking even if gives good insights into the themes of the album.

---

# Why didn’t you?

**seanderlust** (1): what if i gave this my 11
# Gayle flairs

**cocosairdep** (8): ended gayle I fear

**Frajer** (7): Donda esta Gayle yo quiero Gayle

**qazz23** (7): at least the last letter isn't "u" (original comment lololol)

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): she should try putting a u after the f instead of a g. idk kind of a fun idea for a song i think

**1998tweety** (2): ended that fad gayle (why was this rated?)

**welcome2thejam** (2): Sure, put me in the gayle outsold section, I don't even care anymore

**Awkward\_King** (1): slayle

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): gayle when she tried to write a family friendly version of abcdefu

**afs** (0): abcdefu rosalia shitpost
# I wasn’t expecting this many comments about Flux Æon ngl

**WaneLietoc** (10): "F for Flux Æon" wait rosalia are you watching MTV not anime but SF animated program Æon Flux?! yo that's based ez 10 for GOATED interlude

**nt96** (9): she mentioned Æon Flux?? Damn maybe she is a little freaky lol

**vexastrae** (6): her knowing flux aeon ouuu thats taste!

**sarcasticsobs** (5): You guys ever watch "Æon Flux"?

**jackisboredtoday** (4): we probably should have been kind enough to not set this up by rating it, however we stan the aeon flux shoutout

**PrimaryCrusaders** (2): Fluxaeon Ultrasonidos Coqueta- wait why did she skip two letters

**JIRACHI** (0): Flux Æon almost made me give it a 11 tbh
# Knows the alphabet

**freeofblasphemy** (10): Finally

**impla77** (10): SPELLING IS. FUN

**Stryxen** (10): it took nerve and it causes all this conversation i can’t not give 10s where 10s are due

**throwaway-7650** (10): F is for fuck elon

**aquariuszns** (7): not much to rate here lol but its a fun interlude

**auntiegay2** (7): Shakespeare is shaking.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): justice for christi’s interlude (points added for Willie Colón shout out)

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this is the abc I’ll be teaching my kids
# Interludephobes

**babadork** (6.5): I’ve never really had a reason to think about it, but I guess I’m not on board with the alphabet in songs.

**oscarbrierley1** (6.2): this shouldve been cut with the capriludes from the rate. so i dont tank the album any more im giving it my album average.

**DaHumanTorch** (6): C de conquistadora

**moonshxne** (6): one of those interludes idk how to rate

**pig-serpent** (6): People are going to tank this for being a spoken word interlude but I like her voice so I think listening to her say the album title over and over again is a good use of 1 minute every time I listen to the album.

**saviorARMY101** (6): it's a cute little interlude

**ss2811** (6): this was cute i love her so much

**Ambrosia42** (5.6): MOTOMAMI MOTOMAMI

**akanewasright** (5): I think this is camp to be clear, I just also think I would not care if it went out first

**beeozan** (5): she still hasnt missed once

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): okay this is a spoken word interlude, can’t really judge this as I would an actual song so here’s a nice 5

**horridhendy** (5): I love this album but how am I even supposed to rate this?! Frankly, this is an interlude in all but name so if the interludes on Caprisongs don't count (it's the same length as christi and is shorter than track girl) then this shouldn't either imo. There is no singing or music on this either so what am I even rating? I'm going to give this a neutral 5.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): me when I kept a Tale by Quincy in the Mens Ult

**Nagisoid** (5): Chacharinas will not be silenced in this house

**shipperondeck** (5): hahahahaha

**bogo** (4): this is just unnecessary

**CrimsonROSET** (4): rosalia watching game of thrones doesn't sit right with me idk

**flava** (4): part of me wants to be camp and give this a 10, but then I think what I would give it if KKB pulled this and it became clear that starting every line with the following letter of the alphabet is the kind of thing Kero Kero Bonito would pull and I had to rate accordingly

**ReallyCreative** (4): I love Duolingo

**Lynflower680** (3): She’s just reading out words in alphabetical order. That’s it.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): god sorry to be annoying but i can't speak spanish and bc it's not a song i can't rate it off vibes

**UselessTacooo** (3): why are we rating this ☠️

**-mczrv-** (2.6): thank goodness for an easy last place

**alexismateofan** (2): Fuc K and L, worst etters.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Respectfully why was this included

**runaway3212** (2): maybe interludephobia spilled too

**ImADudeDuh** (1): 1nterlude

**indie\_fan\_** (1): https://gfycat.com/embellisheddiligenthedgehog

**memezaharamole** (1): i wish I spoke Spanish :( I know this isn't the daily discussion, but my struggle to ignite the language side of my brain is something that really gets me down, I spent a whole year immersed in French, and I still wasn't confident to speak it, I could read and write almost fluently but my brain can't even handle English speaking. I do love this album, but just want to give an honest score for my position, I can imagine it's even better to those who understand Spanish.

**frogaranaman** (0): girl

**krusso1105** (0): this sure is a spoken word interlude

**lexiaredery** (0): It's just a spoken interlude? Thanks for teaching me the alphabet though

**RandomHypnotica** (0): bold choice to keep this in, lemme help with the controversy score

**TiltControls** (0): I probably would've given Gayle a higher score tbh

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): ¡Oye niños! ¡Deletrear es divertido!

**plastichaxan** (10): I kinda get this placement but also ouch. Se siente heavy verdaderamente (I will be making a few comments in Spanish y se aguantan 💋)

**cremeebrulee** (9.4): This means our first actual song to leave is, unsurprisingly, the shortest bonus track from *Motomami +*, the album’s deluxe edition. LAX may have suffered due to its length, but she is still very gorgeous to me! All 90 seconds of this track build to Rosalia’s beautiful post-chorus. The lines “se siente heavy”, referring to the weight of fame, would make this fit so easily on the standard as an interlude. However, considering that this was second out for 75% of ballot collection, I realize I might be the only one holding that opinion.

**jman457** (6.9): sure it feels half complete but I dug the vibe

---

# The highest commenter giving this an 8 is making ctfu 

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i dont know who invented those vip lounges in airports but they have saved my life so much shoutouts to them

**flava** (8): Airports are the place to be for lonely sadness so true Rosalía

**horridhendy** (8): If this was fleshed out a bit more this would be so great. It amps up and by the end I keep waiting for it to go somewhere that it doesn't quite get to but for what it is, I actually really like it.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): look out for my single "Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport" this june

**WaneLietoc** (7.8): no LAX is an ass airport!

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): never flown into LA so I don’t think I can fairly rate this

**Awkward\_King** (7): call me tinashe bc i can see the future and the rosalia plane video is gonna be played by poppy when this goes out

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I’m not sure what it actually is, but I kinda love how the instrumental for the first half of this just sounds like a pencil writing on paper. It’s nice!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): “I trust my worst enemy more than you” dude talking to TK- idk man im tired and wanna go to bed sob

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Music

**runaway3212** (7): sure why not

**ss2811** (7): good

# Lax with their scores

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): hopped off the plane at

**impla77** (6.2): production kinda sounds like that tiktok trend where they spray on a blackboard and you have to guess the song

**afs** (6): what

**alexismateofan** (6): It’s uhhh… well, it’s workable and nice to listen to? Kind of feels like it’s trying to be a spoken word interlude and a musical interlude together, which idk how much it works for me.

**beeozan** (6): rosalia really pushing the boundaries of what is called a song here

**Lynflower680** (6): It kinda sounds like pencil noises in the back like she’s writing this song out. I like that.

**Nagisoid** (6): PinkPantheress watch out for your gig

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): She writing an essay or somethin?

**welcome2thejam** (6): Lucky this is starting to sound nice, was super tempted to skip and just make up a score thanks to that scribbling sound

**sarcasticsobs** (5.5): In one ear, out the other for this user

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): R&B Pop New Wave Art Pop Alternative R&B Alternative Pop Experimental Pop Experimental Dream Pop Español Spanish Urban España

**Ambrosia42** (5): eh it was over so quick and didn’t leave a strong impression

**bogo** (5): that happened i guess?

**IIIHenryIII** (5): sorry, but I already have a jet queen

**oscarbrierley1** (5): i guess at least its short

**qazz23** (5): like when it picks up in the second half, otherwise 💤

**Stryxen** (5): okay, the distorted piano or whatever it is is really cool

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): honestly this song goes by too quickly for me to have a proper opinion on it

**uberpigeon** (5): i just blinked and apparently 3 songs just went by

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): is this her party in the USA but extremely dull and short without her butterflies flying away

**JIRACHI** (3): yeah i dont know what this is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): why is this asmr

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): With this elimination, twigs is the second artist we see in the reveal, thought *Caprisongs* isn’t the second album in this rate to lose a song technically. Since we left out the Capri-interludes on the ballot, we decided to add some of her loose singles to even out the rate tracklist. Don’t Judge Me was twigs’ first drop since *Magdalene*. And fans were pretty disappointed with how small and repetitive twigs’ role is in this song. caprisongs / christi interlude definitely would have done worse than this, so I don’t regret including it. Plus, Headie One’s verse has some great lyricism on what it’s like to be a Black Brit, a theme that’s also woven throughout *Caprisongs*, so this does not feel as out of place here as people claim.

**jman457** (6.9): I liked the production, but wish Twigs part wasn’t so repetitive.

**plastichaxan** (6): We all really said we are judging<3

---

# Judged twigs well

**alexismateofan** (9): One hell of a powerful message. Wish twigs was on it more but it’s still really beautiful.

**afs** (8): omg 3.33 min long queens recognizing queens

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): The autotuning on Headie's voice is giving those cupcakKe remixes

**runaway3212** (8): the past and future ratrick winner

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): first time listening to this but i really like it!

**WaneLietoc** (7.8): wait this one kinda bangs but loses an auto 2.2 points for being a vessel that hosts a dreaded fred again.. contribution; under no circumstances do you gotta hand it to mr. again..

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): the hosts after including this in the rate:

**Ambrosia42** (7.3): i like how it develops as it pulses along

# Judged twigs poorly

**CrimsonROSET** (7): not this title asking for the dunkening

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Headie One’s verse here is good enough to make up for twigs on autopilot and me having to figure out who “Fred Again” is 

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): Janelle Monáe outsold, outstreamed, outperformed

**IIIHenryIII** (7): stop being such a baby

**qazz23** (7): love the high vocals here and a decent rap verse

**ss2811** (7): pretty decent

**uberpigeon** (7): well its a rate i have to

**welcome2thejam** (7): Unfortunately that is literally the point of a rate so

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): y'all put this in but not Bliss??? smh

**horridhendy** (6.5): Nah, but I will judge this song...and it's okay

**bogo** (6): i'm judging headie one a little for that messy as hell verse

**Nagisoid** (6): There's two different songs going on here kinda and they don't mesh well to my ears

**ReallyCreative** (6): don’t have a lot of thoughts here

**sarcasticsobs** (6): [glares at Fred again..] I will judge whoever I damn well please

**Stryxen** (6): pretty good and headie one carries actually

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): I like the production but neither of them really feel like they fit together that well over it

**shipperondeck** (5.5): this is more a headie one song than a twigs one

**beeozan** (5): oh okay then i'll pick a random number from the generator

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): You’re in a rate! Request denied!

**DaHumanTorch** (5): why on earth is this in the  main rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): Headie One and Twigs sound good, but not crazy on the production or melody of Twigs’ hook

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I’m sorry, but I kinda have to Twigs. That’s the point of a rate

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): it's fine

**amr** (4.4): sure yeah

**akanewasright** (4): remembering how much her fans CAME at her for releasing this extended interlude from someone else’s album as her first single post-Magdalene

**aquariuszns** (4): fred again we dont like u...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): ok at this point i just have to ask it. who the fuck is fred again. ive seen this dude’s name constantly in the past few months but prior to 2023 i have never heard of him before. who is he and why is he everywhere now. and more importantly why did he pick the dumbest stage name of all time.

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (3): Fred again.. is just the most overrated house producer out there. Everything he does is so so so so boring.

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): the two associaations i have with frog are bears and fred again

WaneLietoc: gang every time you bully fred again .. it means he will collab with a random big name electronic bro to make the most 5/10 "yup, thats music" album of your life!!! Im already drowning under the eno collab I cant take any more of this man!!!!
[/r/popheads/comments/13smz8d/eclectic_artpop_rate_reveal_day_1/jlqxhfd/]

b_o_g_o_: next thing you know he's collaborating with aphex twin
[/r/popheads/comments/13smz8d/eclectic_artpop_rate_reveal_day_1/jlqy5lj/]

=====

WaneLietoc: The aphex twin could give him a "remix" track thats just a new ditty entirely. More realistically is that we get "Richard and Fred Twiddle With Knobs Again.." on rephlex by summer 2024

**plastichaxan** (9): Y’all kinda hate fun this has no reason to be her first song out ctfu

**jman457** (8.5): production went hard

**cremeebrulee** (6.6): We love a bottom 5 with all three artists showing up! I think a lot of people predicted this to be Tinashe’s first song out— it’s been relegated to a deluxe and it’s got a :who: feature that didn’t leave many good first impressions. Honestly, this song reminds me so much of another recent deluxe track we rated from a sub fave— [Charli XCX's What You Think About Me](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/13mankz/2022_ultimate_sub_faves_rate_reveal_day_1_rates/jkuhl03/), in that they’re both these brash tracks dedicated to the haters. Though I have to say I vastly prefer Charli’s take on it more; I think the she nails the attitude better and while I don’t hate Christian’s feature here, I also don’t register it most of the time. As a track, it leaves me quite whelmed and this is a good placement for it.

# Do Mouseketeers…?

**bogo** (7.5): why is the guy on this song doing his best mickey mouse impression

**welcome2thejam** (6): Why did he choose to sound like that

**seanderlust** (0): damn mickey mouse got bars

# Woke up like this

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i've already pre-grieved this banger leaving day 1

**qazz23** (10): best of the bonus tracks, love the loud bass and vocal delivery

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i never actually heard this bc i just stopped and looped hum for a good time every time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): me 2

**JIRACHI** (8.5): this is FUN music idc if it's objectively bad it's FUN

**memezaharamole** (8.5): hot take but this is the best track from the extended edition

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): the male rap verse…im gonna pretend i didnt hear that

**DirtyRat583** (8.1): fuck yeah call them out

**akanewasright** (8): this only just now clicking for me oh wow

**CrimsonROSET** (8): nevermind THIS is the closest we’ll get to rating Remi Wolf

**RandomHypnotica** (8): me on the one day of the month I don't wake up with a headache

**ss2811** (8): my fav from the deluxe tracks

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Gonna have to dock this as the one *333*-adjacent song that doesn’t quite know how to realize its ideas. But also I’m still giving it a 7.5

**horridhendy** (7.5): Yeah this is good. Better closer than on the standard release

**afs** (7): #bless

**Ambrosia42** (7): kinda feels like a throwback or a janet song. It’s a bit fun, but nothing amazing

**Lynflower680** (7): The label diss is golden good for her

**runaway3212** (7): me every morning

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): love some part's but particularly hate that higher pitched first verse. either way we love a manifestation anthem

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): her flow on the intro kinda sounds like the sophia grace part of the iconic "best friends on deck" mashup

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I woke up like this

**saviorARMY101** (6): Not my fav but she still ate

# Woke up broke

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): i want to like this so much more but this kinda feels like if a Nashe-era demo had worse production

**sarcasticsobs** (5.5): Hm. I get the sentiment. But: Hm.

**1998tweety** (5): cant relate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4.5): I like the energy here but this instrumental…it sounds kinda bad!

**flava** (4): her punk? era?

**moonshxne** (4): it;s not that i'm for abusive labels ofc but whenever ppl make songs about it it's just been not good??

**ReallyCreative** (4): Tinashe baby please explain how this is cohesive at all

**alexismateofan** (3): I woke up feeling blessed and then I put this on and I feel cursed.

**Nagisoid** (3): wokeuplikethis outsold

**indie\_fan\_** (2): well. least she kinda talkin her shit here

**shipperondeck** (2): tbh i don't get it

**ImADudeDuh** (1): literally why the fuck did she decide to tank my memories of the album by putting this right at the end

**pig-serpent** (1): Good riddance, have fun in the first boots rate coming never.

**throwaway-7650** (1): going to pretend it's a wrap still closes out 333 (deluxe)

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): what the fuck. That’s all I can come up with.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I mean good for her but this is such a stick out on the sound of the album 💀💀 sounds nothing like anything else on the album. I think if this wasn’t tacked onto the deluxe and wasn’t the last song I decided to listen to in the rate, I might have been nicer but this was such a confusing note to end on

**jman457** (8.5): There is a sexiness here that i really like

**plastichaxan** (8.5): The movie sucked but she ate this and she’s british she needs to do a bond theme like !!

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): I actually had no idea this existed until my cohost jman mentioned it… and I’m really glad he did, because I kind of love it. twigs doing a more cinematic, Bond-esque number makes so much sense and she really kills it over this more orchestral production. I honestly don’t have anything to say about Central Cee because I only know him as a Tiktok sound… but after seeing the comments and how this performed, maybe we should’ve used the solo version in the playlist instead. With this out, we round out our bottom 5, though twigs’ actual mixtape is yet to be seen…

---

# The popheads hivemind strikes

**akanewasright** (6.5): how can I be homophobic, my bitch is twigs

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): how can i be homophobic, my bitch is twigs

# This song measured well

**alexismateofan** (10): This feels like it could be a song that was made for a blockbuster movie and I mean that in the best possible way.

**horridhendy** (10): This is the best Twigs song on this rate for me. It's almost like alternative bond song. It really reminds me of a song but I cannot put my finger on it. Anyway, it slaps. I wish the mixtape was more like this tbh. Maybe her other albums are more like this?

**indie\_fan\_** (10): just like people that are rating No Love in my rate based on the album version, i'm pretending i'm rating the solo version

**ReallyCreative** (10): I love this I’m so sorry

**throwaway-7650** (10): the cinematic ~~aka solo~~ version is actually amaze

**UselessTacooo** (9.8): why is this like top 3 and not even on the album

**babadork** (9.5): I like the Bond vibes, but I wouldn’t mind if it didn’t have the rap feature.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9.5): The royal family namedrop askdnfjfk anyways... orphaned masterpiece, I love how cinematic it is

**1998tweety** (9): its giving drama

**amr** (9): why'd central cee beat on her head like bongo drums w his verse I'm so sorry women

**Frajer** (9): fake James Bond tunes always slap

**vexastrae** (9): removing a point for the feature i fear

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.5): This definitely screams action movie trailer music. Like, James Bond theme song type shit. I'm not just saying that because it was literally written FOR an action movie or anything. Love Cench's verse too.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): damn it i can't believe i like a central cee song but he actually kills it lol. twigs really bringing out the best in a man

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): why does this sound like a lana song

**buddhacharm** (8): only for the cinematic version!

**oscarbrierley1** (8): she looks so good in the cover art

**qazz23** (8): this has a trip hop feel to it

**afs** (7.5): why does this exist and why is it acceptable

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is very sound track coded clearly but I kind of like it?

**impla77** (7.4): I love the chord progression of movie songs. Sorry Twigs, Central Cee brings this song down (though its not as bad as it could be)

**beeozan** (7): how can he be homophobic his feature slay

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): oh so this is and minds of men are different songs… I was a bit confused

**seanderlust** (7): this almost sounds like it could be a bond theme

# How can I like this song, I’m misandrist

**uberpigeon** (7): 6.5 inches *

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I hate her vocals in the chorus, especially when she sings the song title

**Lynflower680** (6.5): Production goes hard. Nothing too spectacular though.

**shipperondeck** (6.5): admittedly i listened to this so much when it came out and i honestly dont know why i did that

**Stryxen** (6.5): she wanted bond theme royalties so bad

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): oh this had potential before we saw central cee and his consequences appear

**Ambrosia42** (6): sounds like a dramatic spy movie song, which is what it is

**auntiegay2** (6): No thank you!

**freeofblasphemy** (6): A remarkably okay song

**ImADudeDuh** (6): out of everyone she could’ve collabed with huh

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Yeah, this just screams "made for a movie"

**slimboyfriend** (6): at first I thought this was the “how can I be homophobic/my bitch is gay” guy, and then I felt bad because I thought I was just stereotyping because he had a British accent, but no I was right

**ss2811** (6): it’s for a soundtrack so idk, didn’t really like central cee on it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this song would be soooo fucking good if c***** c** wasnt on it but oh well

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is some tumblrcore shit

**welcome2thejam** (6): Why can I imagine Brendan Urie making this song and how do I make it stop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This and Don’t Judge Me were included specifically to lower my Twigs average and spite me personally.

**bogo** (5): the worse twigs song about men

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (5): not huge on this kind of soundtrack song, but her vocals are heavenly

**jasannn** (4.5): oh, this is the “how can I be homophobic?” guy

**-mczrv-** (4): just can't get into this

**aquariuszns** (4): eh

**frogaranaman** (4): sounds like a mediocre Bond theme

**memezaharamole** (4): cinematic version eats more than this w/ Central Cee

**pig-serpent** (4): I like the cinematic version but the normal one is fineish I guess.

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (4): Definitely sounds like movie soundtrack music, not in a good way.

**JIRACHI** (3): no

**runaway3212** (3): men??? in my fka twigs songs?

**Nagisoid** (2): I must mention the Central Cee song that samples both an American Football tune and Just for me by PinkPantheress, everyone HAS to hear it

**CrimsonROSET** (0): i’d say his verse is the worst thing i’ve ever heard but tk forced me to listen to his song that samples let it go by passenger so

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): Central Cee is :grinny: howeva i just think this whole song sounds awkward tbh! big skip. im so sorry but the whole vibes of this song remind me of this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1S37dLbR9WA

**WaneLietoc** (0): FKA TWIGS YOU ARE SICK FREAK FOR THIS! IS THIS THE PRICE YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR MAKING A REALLY GOOD POST PANDEMIC MAJOR LABEL MIXTAPE?! JUST SING OVER BOHEMIAN RHAPSODY NEXT TIME DONT WORK WITH CENTRAL CEE AND WASTE YOUR TALENT HERE!

**plastichaxan** (10): This bonus track has the most MAMI vibe so of course is the one I gravitated towards and I can’t believe what I had to push hard for was for it to escape bottom 5 I hate you all except for Jules that was incredibly hot of you to 11 this

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): Rosalía’s excursion into Brazilian funk on this track, while interesting, doesn’t feel fully fleshed out. I find it pretty catchy regardless, but I can see how this would sound aggravating to some other listeners. It makes sense why this was left off the standard (though it is my second favorite of the bonus tracks) and it also explains this song’s underperformance here.

**jman457** (5.7): This feels like a bonus track tbh

—

# It’s ambient if you get it you get it

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): whyd i think there was a goat bleeting in the background of this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): is that a cat meowing in the background????

**impla77** (5): whats with the cat meowing

**bogo** (2): the animal noises please she is not being serious

# She killed this

**runaway3212** (11): impulsive 11 but like look at the material

**1998tweety** (9): wait im hearing something

**Frajer** (9): in her Ariana Grande era

**IIIHenryIII** (9): she wants to be latina so bad she even got to feature Brazilian funk on the album

**saviorARMY101** (9): I feel like I'm at the Rio carnival

**aquariuszns** (8.5): girl we going to brasil?

**alexismateofan** (8): I mean work.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Making a playlist of just the bonus songs with select main record tunes

**ss2811** (8): the beat is everything

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): actually really like how jarring this song feels. like the melody does not match the production imo but it works

**throwaway-7650** (8): she was in her nelly furtado bag here

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): We’re having some real fun in bonus track land aren’t we

**CrimsonROSET** (7): AAAA LELEKLEKLEKLEKLEK

**horridhendy** (7): Good

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why does this sound like 3 steps away from being bollywood song

**qazz23** (7): some cool synths and percussion

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this is a mess (affectionate)

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): sounds like banks (not azealia)

# They killed her

**afs** (6.5): finally something id give below 7

**WaneLietoc** (6.5): regular ditty

**Ambrosia42** (6.3): not bad, but i don’t enjoy it as much as most of the main tracks

**uberpigeon** (5): i love kill la kill

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): OK chica your stint into hyperpop was fun but you're getting a little too close into cien gecs territory

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This was the only Motomami+ song to not have an English translation available on Genius like even they forgot about it.

**Nagisoid** (4): This is how the Brazilian Funk rate can still happen

**RandomHypnotica** (3.2): oh I fucking hate this drum beat its irritating

**Stryxen** (3): this is like she actively tried to make my least favourite song of hers

**flava** (1): I really needed this album to leave the dry and stiff percussion and the vocal effects that make rosalìa sound awful over a bunch of non-hooks on the standard edition of the album

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): On [deluxe release night](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/t5dy5v/tinashe_333_deluxe/), many have called this song a career high for Tinashe. I don’t know about all that, but I do think it is a pretty track with some cool, atmospheric production to match. Imo she’s incapable of making a bad ballad, though she’s outdone herself with slower numbers on this album alone. It placed a little lower than I expected, but I don’t mind to see it leave at all. Interestingly, I could have sworn that Tinashe would win the deluxe-off with Rosalía, but with elimination they’re both out two bonus tracks each.

**jman457** (7.7): Nice alt dance track.

**plastichaxan** (7.5): Kinda good for a bonus but maybe I overrated a little bit. It still didn’t do great so I don’t mind that

---

# Something like a BOP

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): Love her vocals on this one, like, especially so

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Truly a power move to have a line like “Did you even know it that you played me like a token” and have it come that smooth

**qazz23** (8): good bass/percussion in the second half

**akanewasright** (7.5): I basically never listen to this song, but this is really lovely and spacey

**afs** (7): somewhat like a bop

**alexismateofan** (7): I feel like the vibes are crossing all over the place and I can’t quite nail what this song is supposed to be doing. But also, werq.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Turning the bass all the way up on the speakers and making my house collapse

**Ambrosia42** (6.9): ok i played it in my car and the bass was hitting and it clicked a bit

# Something like a… I’m sure someone will finish this

**JIRACHI** (6.5): meh

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): meh

**runaway3212** (6.5): this doesnt do a lot but what it does like

**CrimsonROSET** (6): oh no the deluxe is gonna tank my average again isn’t it

**ss2811** (6): needs to still grow a bit on me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it took ages for the deluxe tracks to hit for me and this track exemplifies that. like i can tell its deluxe lol it's enjoyable enough tho.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): kinda feels like an outtake but come thru electronic music

**UselessTacooo** (5.8): she’s cute

**Nagisoid** (5): These vocalizations at the end remind me of an Ariana song but I don't even know which one

**IIIHenryIII** (4): more like Something Like a Filler

**shipperondeck** (3): this feels incomplete

**horridhendy** (2): Something Like A Yawn. Such a dull song.

**Awkward\_King** (1): something like a flop amirite

**cremeebrulee** (10): I had [originally clowned on her](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037525072950341732/1109609381902962699/Screen_Shot_2023-05-20_at_3.31.14_PM.png?width=1971&height=796) for naming a closing track something *this* on the nose, but when you put that aside, I actually enjoy this song a lot. Tinashe channels nonchalance so well; it reminds me of Like I Used To a bit, with the idgaf attitude turned up a bit. Fun fact, the two features on this are actually Tinashe’s brothers; I think it’s a really sweet gesture to include them on her victory lap on the album, even if they didn’t make it too far here.

**jman457** (7): A nice ending, but it wasn’t mind blowing or anything.

**plastichaxan** (6): Kinda giggling at the comments that say this isn’t a closer because we included the bonus but like it’s not the best closer so :shrug:

---

# Rated on an empty stomach

**Frajer** (9): when I'm being healthy so I don't order a sandwich

**ReallyCreative** (9): real burritos when they see a fake bitch with no rice

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): well yeah it's not a sandwich

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Someone get this girl a gyro

**uberpigeon** (6.5): me when someone asks what a burrito is

**vexastrae** (6.5): me when tinashe asks me what i want to order at the chipotle

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): me making a wrap:

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): me when someone asks me what i got from wawa for my lunch yesteray

# She ate

**throwaway-7650** (10): and nothing for tinashe mama

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): cute family moment

**akanewasright** (8): I skip this track a lot bc I think it’s one of the sillier songs on the album… But it does kind of work as a curtain call song, like it really is a wrap idk…

**beeozan** (8): nice little homogenic synths

**freeofblasphemy** (8): No, it’s not! There are bonus tracks to rate!

**ss2811** (8): great ending to the standard edition

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): me when i'm mario and you ask me what move ekans learns at level one. sorry

**saviorARMY101** (7.5): a nice chill bop

**Ambrosia42** (7.2): it’s fine and works as a closer, but the rest of the album is so much better

**afs** (7): wdym the album isnt over yet

**alexismateofan** (7): They always have the best ending album songs like in the middle of the album, especially with a name like that. Girl just put it at the end, it’s fine!!!

# Wrap it up

**JIRACHI** (7): it's okay

**sarcasticsobs** (7): Okay, finally it appears we have the near-miss for me

**static\_int\_husp** (7): kinda funny to have a song meant to be a closer suddenly not be because you tacked 4 bonus songs onto an album

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): it's a nice closer but kind of forgettable

**WaneLietoc** (7): it's so funny that this is the song title. the edits and memes create themselves

**jasannn** (6.5): naevis calling

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): this song being on the end of the main version is kind of corny. Also it literally sounds like bouncin again

**impla77** (6.3): ok obvious ending song.. oh wait, deluxe inc

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why isn’t this the end of this record this is so serious

**oscarbrierley1** (6): this song has potential, but something about it just doesnt quite fully work.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): Oh god oh no she doesn’t know that we’re including the four deluxe songs in this rate and that it’s actually NOT a wrap at all!

**Awkward\_King** (5): a nice closer!! not much else

**bogo** (5): i really don't get why we needed this song, like i feel like naming the closer "it's a wrap" and having it start abruptly with "you know it's a wrap" is a bit too on the nose

**IIIHenryIII** (5): not for gifts

**UselessTacooo** (4.5): pop girly lesson of the day: just because a song is about being done doesn’t mean it’s your album closer

**Nagisoid** (4): Can we convince the TikTok teens this is the Mariah song that went viral so that Tinashe blows up

**runaway3212** (4): tbh I wish we just could've gotten last call again

**horridhendy** (3.5): She sounds half-asleep on this track. I wish it was a wrap on this boring song

**jman457** (8.2): a really lovely understated moment on the album

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): Aislamiento sounds gorgeous and entrancing /while/ I’m listening to it; unfortunately it lacks a sort of memorable hook that makes me be able to recall the song I just finished listening to. It’s, perhaps, my least favorite of the bonus tracks, so I’m alright with it departing bottom 10.

---

# Joven, bonita, y brillante

**alexismateofan** (10): This feels so RAW. It’s majestic.

**impla77** (10): shoutout to the (translated) lyrics, really good!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): cool production here. Rosalia x Burial collab????? “Alone in the mirage, I go with no entourage/I believe the world is mine/If I shed a tear, God forgive me/For taking so many blessings for granted” damn

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this song is so dark and mysterious and cool???? like i need more stuff that sounds like this

**ReallyCreative** (9): oh kinda living for this one

**throwaway-7650** (9): KALI UCHIS?

**IIIHenryIII** (8): “shots fired”

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Enjoying the bonus stuff a lot more than the main record

**vexastrae** (8): i like it when she goes bapbapbap

**welcome2thejam** (8): Loving and hating the noise in the background that sounds like the time a strip of rubber stuck to my tire and shredded my car's wheel well

**afs** (7.5): everything reminds me of her (malamente)

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): the pop pop pop pop makes me think of pennywise everytime i listen 😭

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): YES DARK AMBIENT ROSALIA

**Ambrosia42** (7.1): not my favorite overall, but i liked where it was going at the end

**WaneLietoc** (7.1): it's a pleasant one to manually rewind tapes to I'll give it that

**horridhendy** (7): Good

**slimboyfriend** (7): I like this song because I too am young, pretty, sad, and brilliant

**ss2811** (7): pretty good

**Stryxen** (7): why did this last forever it was still good tho i liked the vocals and the chords

# Triste

**akanewasright** (6): I think I love her voice too much to truly dislike her boring songs… But I will not mind if this leaves day 1

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): love the production, but not so much the song

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): interesting sonically, i wish she'd played with her voice a bit more though

**Nagisoid** (5): Pink Floyd's The Wall is overrated, say it louder!

**runaway3212** (5): this does very little but it's not bad

**qazz23** (4.5): ballad that doesn't add much to the album

**shipperondeck** (4.5): thought she said dmc and i was like omggg devil may cry reference

**-mczrv-** (4.4): as high as the highs are, there are a couple lows with this album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): “im young, pretty, im sad” bitch me too

**Awkward\_King** (0): none of the bonus tracks bar despecha do anything for me really but this especially is just very nothing to me

**jman457** (8): Its a nice airy intro.

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): Not too long after saying goodbye to her closer, we also part ways with Tinashe's opener. "Let Go" sets the stage of the album quite well with its heavenly, distorted vocals, though what Tinashe is saying seems to be more vibes than anything truly relevant to the rest of the project. While it's a pleasant introduction, we all seem to agree that it doesn't deserve to outlast any more tracks from the album, which make this song wrap up our bottom 10.

**plastichaxan** (7): Wish this was longer it maybe could’ve escaped introphobia but shrug. I kinda wish I had given it a slightly higher score but it compensates because I feel the opposite for two songs here ouu

---

# Will save Tinashe

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): “waiting on somebody else to save me” - me looking at my student loans

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (10): Fantastic ethereal opener.

**saviorARMY101** (10): this intro is gorgeous

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): Such a lovely, relaxing introduction to the sounds and themes of the album. The production is gorgeous with the nature sounds weaved into it, which kind of hints at the idea of living in the moment and being aware of your surroundings, which I feel like is a theme in this album as well as nature vs. technology.

**akanewasright** (9): Avril Lavigne found DEAD, SLAYED by a 2 minute intro

**Awkward\_King** (9): girl let it go

**aquariuszns** (8): solid album start

**ReallyCreative** (8): bird noises and other environmental sounds are so cunty

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Pretty. I'm a sucker for birdsong

**TiltControls** (8): Maybe I'll regret giving it a score this high if it starts outlasting some other songs, but this is a fantastic intro to the album

**-mczrv-** (7.8): a beautiful but short opener!

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended elsa

**JIRACHI** (7.5): this is cute wished it was longer though

**WaneLietoc** (7.5): intro: the intro

**afs** (7): i fell in love with the devil,,, and now im in truoblee,,,

**Lynflower680** (7): Solid opening for a great album

**Nagisoid** (7): Tinashe learned to let go ❤️

**pig-serpent** (7): A nice mood setter and nothing more.

**ss2811** (7): strong intro to a strong album!

**Stryxen** (7): voqals

**uberpigeon** (6.5): its a cute intro

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): It’s pleasant!

**IIIHenryIII** (6): nature sounds just work on anything

# Let go of this song already

**oscarbrierley1** (6): its a good set up for the album, but i dont find myself listening to it on its own.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): what do you want me to say

**UselessTacooo** (6): really does a good job at setting the albums scene

**welcome2thejam** (6): When that deep bass rumbled in I rose to life

**beeozan** (5.5): iconic debut album by avril lavigne

**impla77** (5): okay obvious intro song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): it's an opener that sets the vibe and that's pretty much all the positive things i have to say

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): sure

**alexismateofan** (4): Rejected from ‘lofi beats to study/sleep to’ because it only did half of that.

**horridhendy** (4): I dunno, this does nothing for me but it's not horrible.

**runaway3212** (3): maybe introphobia is right

**amr** (1): having to listen to this album in full made me remember why I always leave this song out of my queue and it's cos she sounds like jar jar binks for no reason

**cremeebrulee** (9): Yes, we hate the slowed + reverbed trend, yes, originally Bouncin’ outsold, but have you considered that “kiss me ‘til my legs give out” is the cuntiest lyric on the album?

**jman457** (7.3): I liked this a little better than the first one.

**plastichaxan** (6): TikTok’s damage to society is irreparable this kinda deserved to do worse I’m sorry

---

# Waaaaaaatch ittttttttt boooooooouncin oooooooon thhhhhhhhhe grouuuuuuund

**bogo** (10): it's practically impossible to make this song not sound like a 10

**Lynflower680** (10): Bouncin (slowed and reverb) But in all seriousness, this song has me yearning holy shit

**ReallyCreative** (10): reprisephobia you will be dealt with omg

**saviorARMY101** (10): I love the original but man this version is gorgeous, those VOCALS!

**Stryxen** (10): Lord forgive me for the things this makes me feel

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): stream ded

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): what aphex twin THINKS he’s doing

**seanderlust** (9.5): bouncin...two!!! https://d220lhlugu3kfc.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/629529-Peggle2XboxGamePass.jpg

**shipperondeck** (9.2): bouncin more like FLOATIN

**beeozan** (9): if bouncin was so good then why is there no bouncin 2.. wait

**CrimsonROSET** (9): movie trailer slowdown but make it pussy

**freeofblasphemy** (9): Why is anyone else bothering writing sex jams when this exists

**runaway3212** (9): a remix slay but a slay nonetheless

**Ambrosia42** (8.9): slows down time as she is getting physical again with someone and possibly opening up to love again without rushing into things. I enjoy this being here even if it’s mostly the same song slowed down with some extra verses

**WaneLietoc** (8.9): omg they gave me a squeakquel! w/xtra deep booty voice

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): I like this more than part 1 [ducks]

**akanewasright** (8.5): I would pole dance to this

**babadork** (8.5): There isn’t anything to really dislike about this song, but I usually make it half way through before wanting to listen to the original.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): why do i like this better than the original

**JIRACHI** (8.5): i prefer pt.1 but this is cute too i guess

**TiltControls** (8.5): I think I'd like it a lot more if it were just Tinashe without the absurdly slowed down background vocal breaking things up

**cocosairdep** (8): bouncin (corpse singing in the shower cover)

**ss2811** (8): obsessed with this i love when artists drop this type of thing

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): never understood the "reverb" trend till this song. i love how both parts are sexy but in different ways. why does it feel so weird to call a song sexy.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): Bouncing (Slowed  & Reverbed) (TikTok's Version)

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): this is one of those cases in which the sequel isn’t better than the original, but I love it anyway

**1998tweety** (7): part 2 the sequel

**afs** (7): the sequel never lives up to the original does it

**alexismateofan** (7): if Bouncin was the PEP version, this is the dEd version (shout out to the Lights fans in the rate (it’s just me probably)).


# More like, how to make Bouncin a 2
**qazz23** (7): not as good as the first, feels pretty long and without a strong hook

**uberpigeon** (7): this actually kind of a vibe but this girl really cant resist making a song boring like she made a fun high energy bop and thought... no... i cant leave it alone like that

**welcome2thejam** (7): New rule: no taking anything before getting on the trampoline

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): great vocals but a bit unnecessary

**vexastrae** (6.5): wheres the ice spice feature :(

**buzzwhyte** (6): you will NEVER be Bouncin'

**ignitethephoenix** (6): most pointless song but it’s not terrible

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (5): Irrelevant to the plot

**Nagisoid** (5): The Midnight Rain vocoder made a comeback for this one

**DirtyRat583** (4): slowed + reverb

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): silly rabbit!!! Slowed and reverbed remixes aren’t fashionable, kids these days are all about their sped-up versions!!

**flava** (3.5): if you are planning on playing Trampoline by Kero Kero Bonito as the interlude for this please change my score to a 0

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): this is such a waste wait

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This is just unnecessary.

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): tiktok needs to be banned for slowed + reverb shit @ biden

**Awkward\_King** (2): i respect the gall of having a reprise of the most ass shaking song known to man as a slow r&b jam! i dont like the actual song but i respect it

**horridhendy** (2): This song sounds like it's been slowed down too much. It's a no. So boring.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): what was the reason

**impla77** (0): yeah, this doesn’t really add anything when there is a far superior version of this on the same album

**TragicKingdom1** (0): contractually obligated slowed + reverb version teas

**plastichaxan** (10): This makes me feel so good but also kinda cry?? We did her dirty guys

**cremeebrulee** (8): *Caprisongs* finally makes its first appearance in this rate, with us declaring lightbeamers as its weakest track. Perhaps this track was always doomed to the mixtape’s first elimination; I did compare twigs’ distorted vocals on here to those on [her collaboration with 645AR](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/lt3nds/charity_rate_iii_reveal_day_1_you_dont_understand/gov821m/). I wonder why we chose this as the mixtape’s first out, considering that its message of self-love is very applicable to our own lives. I guess we just favored the other songs on this mixtape more. Plus, no song on this project has a sub-7.000 average or appearance in the bottom 10, so those droplets were good for something.  

**jman457** (5): It was alright, production gave me lo-fi beats production

---

# Blinded by the lights

**mabellonghetti74** (10): Impossible for me to listen to this and not think about all that twigs has endured and overcome in the past few years, but also all that she has given us, musically and spiritually.

**seanderlust** (10): ok the phone bit is legitimately good advice for all my depresseties out there - you are great! don't be afraid to document why you are great in your moments of clarity

**WaneLietoc** (10): oh my googness im woozy

**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): "Lay down your fears, baby, ain't nobody die from a no" leave me ALONE

**Ambrosia42** (9.1): gorgina

**saviorARMY101** (8.5): omg hyperpop?!?

**alexismateofan** (8): Finally a song for the pretty and sad girls, who never get songs for them.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): she said don’t waste your money on therapy, take this

**Nagisoid** (8): Broadcast the boom boom boom a little loud and play it in your car

**oscarbrierley1** (8): most sonically interesting of the slow songs on the album.

**qazz23** (8): good mix of vocal styles

**vexastrae** (8): did more for the mental illness community than bett*rh\*lp ever did

**welcome2thejam** (8): Hot damn, that moment when the strings go from ear to ear

**afs** (7.5): Happy and Sad

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Feels like this is the right way for twigs to fuse her style with a more “traditional” one. It’s not the perfect realization of it, but it’s on the right track

**CrimsonROSET** (7): sorry i forgor

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (7): This is a weird one. Nothing about it really pulls me in, but nothing is bad. It just sounds too similar to her other stuff, like I'd probably listen to meta-angel over this one-hundred-percent of the time. But it still sounds nice.

**ss2811** (7): meh

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): remember when she dated matty healy. that was wild

# Don’t, don’t do it again

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): wanna like this one more than i do but alas its mid

**akanewasright** (6): “pretty and sad” me when my 10th grade English teacher told me I’m not an ugly crier as I had a breakdown in her office

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): sim-simma, who got the keys to my Bimmer? who am iiiiiiiiii

**runaway3212** (6): frankly im having a good time listening to this album but not because of songs like this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds like if hannah diamond and doja cat collabed for a song. im not sure if this is a compliment or not.

**Lynflower680** (5.5): Wasn’t feeling it

**impla77** (5.2): feels a bit disconnected

**beeozan** (5): when this album sounds like this then my face is mostly like :| like there was this glitchy part but i was too out of it to care (and i was trying to focus my eyes closed all in on the song)

**horridhendy** (5): Meh

**Awkward\_King** (4): this instrumental is a slowed down and reverbed gecs song

**ignitethephoenix** (4): kind of painful to listen to sonically but I do like the affirmation lyrics

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i appreciate one of twigs' appeal is her out-of-the-box songs but this just feels really incoherent.

**throwaway-7650** (4): ok mickey mouse

**slimboyfriend** (0): this zero more so represents my disappointment in this album as a whole, and I just picked the song that best represented how much of a slog listening to this album is for me

**plastichaxan** (10): Oh y’all need to go to jail for what you did to this I thought y’all liked El Mal Querer

**jman457** (8.5): A great return to her flamenco roots

**cremeebrulee** (5): don't look at my ELQ scores :didntseethat: I wasn't too keen on Rosalía's flamenco tracks then, so this just by default is my least favorite track on *Motomami*. It doesn't help that I find the build a little unsatisfying too. This track was always doomed to Day 1, which makes sense, since this song's untraditional structure seemed to turn people off.

---

# El Mal Querer fans

**CrimsonROSET** (10): DALE!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i am looking up the English translation of the lyrics and learning about so many different aspects of flamenco yasss

**IIIHenryIII** (10): that olé sounds so bad it’s good

**runaway3212** (10): oh no my one weakness autotune

**throwaway-7650** (10): EL MAL QUERER? wasn't hispanic art pop was like 2 years ago or

**cocosairdep** (9.5): this song is so well constructed

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): the flamenco bitch still got it!

**beeozan** (9): if you guys give this the kkb sometimes treatment ill be pissed

**Nagisoid** (9): Furiously submitting a hyperflamenco genre to the RYM database

**Ambrosia42** (8.9): An interesting development of sounds as it progresses, and it seems to kind of reference her older flamenco sound but propel it forward

**babadork** (8.7): Kind of want to bump this rating up for going full Alvin and the Chipmunks

**akanewasright** (8.5): I prefer the flamenco inspired songs on EMQ to this (if only bc of the thematic stuff going on there), but this sound does fucking rule and I am happy she’s not left it behind completely

**vexastrae** (8.5): an ass shaker!

**alexismateofan** (8): oh you better work goddamn YES.

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Okay! This has ideas! And shoutouts!

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): A lovely El mal querer throwback

**qazz23** (8): love her take on flamenco

**seanderlust** (8): did not see that lil kim shoutout coming but okay werk! we stan taste

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): basic comment but omg vocals. the way this song builds is also super satisfying

**welcome2thejam** (8): The drums buildup got me hype

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): moving and grooving a bit

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): I still cackle everytime I hear the song ending noise

**WaneLietoc** (7.5): "Just as much of a cantaora/When I'm wearing a Versace tracksuit/Or dressed like a bailaora/When I'm wearing a Versace tracksuit" OHHH SHE'S LIKE CARDI B. OH THIS IS A CARDI B DITTY *an unbearably loud incorrect buzzer that sounds like 2:02 of this song rings rings as I am swarmed by FBI sleeper agents trying to detain me*

**afs** (7): me when i find a portable fan to sing into

**bigbigbee** (7): man she has a set of pipes on her

**ss2811** (7): did her thinggg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): pentatonix but if they slayed

# Flamen-no :(

**sarcasticsobs** (6.7): GREAT percussion. That's all I got

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): ok girl sing

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): don't care for the use of auto-tune on this one, but the stripped sound is yass

**horridhendy** (5): Gosh, I know people love this but it just doesn't click with me much at all. It's not bad but I admit I do usually skip it. Meh, sorry.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why does she keep doing that thing with her voice

**pig-serpent** (5): Annoying

**Stryxen** (4.5): aggressively just there

**bogo** (4): i do not like el mal querer at all and this song sounds the most like that album

**JIRACHI** (4): i did not like the lack of an instrumenral

**-mczrv-** (3.8): for some reason this song kinda stresses me out but points for vocals!

**RandomHypnotica** (3.6): this would kinda pop off if it had some instruments that are capable of melodies

**flava** (1.5): look i can respect the lack of conventional song structure but that particularly egregious use of autotune (i think) after the halfway point. None of this sounds good, especially those drums that sound extra dry

**oscarbrierley1** (0): something about this feels like musical theatre energy. the drums are giving headache, the autotune is giving no.

**plastichaxan** (9): Kinda should’ve given this a 10 we really called this rate eclectic art pop but did this to the most eclecticy arty poppy song??? hello

**jman457** (7.5): Twigs had cool vocals on this

**cremeebrulee** (4): Sorry to miss twigs, but this song is a complete miss to me. ~~Mostly cause I can never fix a man, only make him worse :/ ~~ While this was probably not her intention, this track reminds me of those Tiktokers who try to pitch femininity but in a repackaged-patriarchal-way. And I can appreciate the idea of tearing down someone’s emotional walls, but I wished it was approached in a genderless way, rather than through the perspective of a woman’s “soft” or “profound” love. I just think [mary magdalene](https://open.spotify.com/track/77tQQM8iEswfiSVLbTrFPX) does this subject matter in a more interesting manner. This would’ve been my pick for a twigs-first-out (even over the loosies), but its exit here is fine as well.

**jman457** (8.3): A poppier “hours” from LP1

**plastichaxan** (8): I kinda missed this on my first few listens of the album cause every song is excellent but I’m so glad I saw the vision in the end

**cremeebrulee** (6.2): careless is a track I wish I liked more because I do like the elements that it’s made of. I think Daniel Caesar was a great choice of a feature; their melodies are exchanged wonderfully and symmetrically. I also love the double meaning of twigs’ partner being heedless both in sex and in their relationship. There’s this perfect mixture of adoration and trust but also melancholy when you really consider what twigs is giving her lover permission to do. Actually, as I’m typing this out, I kind of do wish I could raise my score up a few points, but my justification for its original score is that I never seek this track out on its own. It dims in comparison to a lot of the other songs left.

---

# Loves like a Pisces

**musical\_pyn** (11): oh it's perfect! if you don't get it I'm incredibly sorry for you

**alexismateofan** (10): Reading the words ‘twigs posted a snippet of the song on her Discord server’ on genius while reading the lyrics fucking SENT me and I don’t know why.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My laptop when I’m eating dinner in bed and watching YouTube.

**bogo** (10): hook gives me shivers every time

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): https://tenor.com/view/seulgi-cryingn-crying-gif-14614806

**IIIHenryIII** (10): you could be careless with me too anytime, Miss

**JIRACHI** (10): YOU CAN BE CARELESSSSSSSS

**sarcasticsobs** (10): 2nd verse : (

**WaneLietoc** (9.7): this is what i say to my fortnite trio when we drop into tomato town "we could be careless".

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i only know of daniel caesar because of the respect women juice rate and i think this branding works for him in this song

**saviorARMY101** (9): her vocals are gorgeous here

**Stryxen** (9): wow!

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): kinda like if you asked AI to make pendulum as a caprisongs track

**Ambrosia42** (8.6): i love the chorus, the rest not as much but it’s still good

**impla77** (8.6): im a slut for harmonies

**akanewasright** (8): YOU CAN BE CARELESS

**Nagisoid** (8): That's how I broke my 3DS screen

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): Daniel Caesar was like “Hey what if there was a feature from a male artist on this that was actually good”

**vexastrae** (7.5): daniel caesars voice doesnt work with twigs voice as much as id like it to but its still pretty good

**afs** (7): real (3)

**ss2811** (7): her vocals come through on here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i really enjoy daniel caesar on this, great feature!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Now where's the Miss Piggy remix for this song?

**welcome2thejam** (7): Honestly the dude kinda carried (oh, it's Daniel Caesar? Turns out I really liked his new album)

# Careless with their scores

**horridhendy** (6.5): It's riding that fine like of being too sleepy but I dunno, it's okay for me. I actually really like the feature

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why is twigs the worse part of this song

**uberpigeon** (6.5): alex winston outsold

**throwaway-7650** (6): 📝 note taken [tanks another point]

**ReallyCreative** (5): oh idk about this one

**runaway3212** (5): her voice here...

**qazz23** (4): a bit too slow and ballad-y

**UselessTacooo** (4): hot take this song is wayyyyy too slow

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (3): God this stretch between jealosy and careless is unbearable. The music definitely dips for a bit around here on the album.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): suf i am sorry but i still do not know who this man is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): its boring AND their voices sound annoying like pick a struggle

**babadork** (0): This might just be misandry, but this 0 is entirely Daniel Caesar’s fault.

**plastichaxan** (10): ROBBED!! I scream “I HAD A GOOD JOB AND I LEFT YEE!” every time as if I had ever had a good job omfg

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): which way straddles the line between song and interlude; it meanders in the same way a lost twigs does in its narration. I’m obsessed with how unseriously this song takes itself: the “left right left right”, its casual mention of running into the devil, and the iconic outro (she’s just like me fr!! I am the rockstar girlfriend!!) There was never a timeline where is song does absurdly well, but a girl could wish.

**jman457** (7.7): light little interlude

---

# Rockstars

**amr** (10): U can tell they're drunk as fuck cos I, sober, would've been embarrassed trying to explain the rockstar girlfriend thing after the second time

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is such a walking through london in the middle of the night a little tipsy song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i feel like this song just came alive for me, wow what fun eee :)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): ok, she ate, but where’s the I Got 5 On It credit?

**qazz23** (10): some good vocal styles, love the sudden beat switch

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i listened to this song like 5 times and i have no idea how to objectively give a score to this. i think it broke my brain and for that i have no excuse but to give this top marks

**TiltControls** (10): Whatever way this track is going is the obvious answer here

**WaneLietoc** (10): now dat's what we call a drum machine and bridge jump! THIS SHIT EVEN TELLS YOU ITS SO CRAZY AND LIGHTHEADED! I FEEL LIKE PAC-MAN IN THE GOOD TIME LINE BOPPING AROUND WITH MS. PACMAN DA BOO

**DirtyRat583** (9.3): underrated banger

**akanewasright** (9): I HAD A GOOD JOB AND I LEFT - me talking about making $10 an hour at Buffalo Wild Wings

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The devil went down to London (his family lives there and he was visiting).

**Nagisoid** (9): Me when I have anxiety crossing the street

**Stryxen** (9): this seriously sounds like one of those how im feeling now trailers (idk what they even were) where charli was just always in speaking depressed into a microphone and putting reverb on it. maybe i’m just thinking of the enemy bridge

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): love the song but the voicenote at the end is sooooo. it's not that complex a thought she didn't have to elaborate so muchajshsjlkls

**vexastrae** (8.5): this is so donna noble core

**CrimsonROSET** (8): twigs is absolutely a rockstar

**freeofblasphemy** (8): This does stuff and it’s good at it

**oscarbrierley1** (8): yass big brain anthem

**ss2811** (8): such a unique song as always with twigs but this one just hits the spot

**Ambrosia42** (7.9): couldn’t decide which way to go for my comment sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): that intro spilled about the energy of the song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): my mum as soon as we walk out of any building

**sarcasticsobs** (7.7): Could never get super into this one, but I'm bumping this score on yet another listen

**afs** (7.5): real

**impla77** (7.4): obsessed with the way she repeats the rockstar line, like its not easily comprehended

**alexismateofan** (7): Ranma 1/2’s Ryoga as a song.

**beeozan** (7): this is DEFINITELY not the perfect music to think. but i like it when it goes dadadododadadodo

**pig-serpent** (7): I love the good parts of this but they're so short

**ReallyCreative** (7): pov: you’re a western man being approached by a fascist with a Greek statue avi

**runaway3212** (7): this actually inspired cosmonauts by fiona apple

# The Devil

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): nice fluttery song but also not the perfect music to think… this is prob one of twigs most brain-off tracks for me

**aquariuszns** (6.5): its cute but bit of a throaway eh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i mean this is kind of nothing

**welcome2thejam** (4): Back half saved it

**horridhendy** (3): What kind of elevator?! I dunno about this one. It's kinda annoying.

**UselessTacooo** (3): literally headache inducing

**shipperondeck** (0): i also have no thoughts

**plastichaxan** (10): Quiero que la calle se enamore de mí omfg. Me alegra que sea la canción del bonus con mejor rating pero la manera en que ustedes la eliminaron en esta posición… Oh eso no es-

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): I love songs where you can /hear/ the artist smile or laugh in their delivery, so those "chi chi chiri's" are so adorable to me. It's definitely got some interesting production imo, but according to raters: L + weird production + deluxe track, so it makes its home in Day 1.

**jman457** (7.1): sure wish there was a bit more, but great production

---

# Hooked on this like cocaine

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): THIS IS SO GOOD HOLY SHIT!!!!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): really love this song, shame it didn't make the main album

**Frajer** (9): there is so much going on here musically but I think in a good way

**saviorARMY101** (9): honestly she's right, this song is addicting

**welcome2thejam** (9): Who wrote this chorus, The Weeknd?

**Lynflower680** (8.5): Right at the first note I was immediately like “OH HELL YEAH THIS IS GOING TO BE GOOD” and wasn’t disappointed.

**pig-serpent** (8.5): The bass on this one goes hard.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): Production sick

**alexismateofan** (8): That chorus really works me out, like damn.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): looking up this being a song about her fans being hooked on her….. No i get it like she put some crack in these

**qazz23** (8): love the background sounds and percussion

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): her saying heroína in this song makes me wonder if that's what camila was going for the whole time... maybe we were too harsh on her...

**horridhendy** (7.5): It has grown on me. Solid.

# Chiri please… you’re killing me…

**Ambrosia42** (7.2): some interesting sounds, but i think other songs handled it better

**shipperondeck** (7.2): overall the deluxe tracks are not all that to me

**afs** (7): chili is what we needed

**beeozan** (7): she forgot the do in chidori

**Nagisoid** (7): Now why does the chorus remind me of the "Nicoteen, heroween, morpheen" Camila Cabello meme

**slimboyfriend** (7): oh another white girl in love with the streets

**ss2811** (7): took time to grow on me

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): Yeah it’s pretty good but not “most-played of the bonus tracks on Spotify” good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Is there a beat em up arcade game playing in the background of this?

**IIIHenryIII** (6): a synth bop, wait…

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Should have called it "Chuck-e-Cheese"

**runaway3212** (5): she's fun but she's a 5

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): oof, I’m going to call this one a bit robbed, though many raters saw a slower, somber track like this not making it too far to begin with. There’s no lack of songs written about California or LA among pop girls and this one doesn’t bring anything new. (Is is blasphemous to call this my favorite California track on *333*? Sorry Pasadena). But it’s such a lovely mellow vibe, the line about “never [having to] force it” almost describes how well Tinashe slides on these downtempo tracks. I was hoping this could slip over past the threshold to Day 2 at some point, but it never could escape its fate here.

**jman457** (7.3): the spoken word intro was good, but wish there was more

**plastichaxan** (7): This is going on the floating playlist for sure. Deserved slightly better but I don’t mind the elimination

---

# Now I Don’t Hate California After All

**alexismateofan** (11): oh shit this is going to be my top song in my wrapped this year, isn’t it.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is gonna do so badly for no reason! atmospheric introspective slay!!!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): love the melody, love the vibe

**throwaway-7650** (10): what is "fandom of r/popheads sub fave that will never win a rate"

**shipperondeck** (9.3): ignore this comment but this is one of the main songs for one of my oc couples i love them so much . anyway

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): She literally slows it down (and even says “time slows down”), and this song to me is about how you’re so in love with someone that you stop paying attention to everything else. Time feels like it slows down and all you’re focusing on is the person you’re with, but time is ACTUALLY continuing to pass and you’re losing friends and maybe happiness. She connects it to technology again too (“and I'm not afraid, the FaceTime phase”). Sometimes you focus too much on an idealized situation (a perfect relationship) that you don’t see the reality in front of you: time is passing, your relationship is actually quite “tangled.” However, the way she never seems to spend the night with this person makes me think maybe their relationship is actually imagined, or maybe she is singing about the city of Los Angeles itself, or the sun, or maybe this is just a virtual relationship because of the pandemic and the FaceTime reference. I feel like there could be multiple layers to this song idk maybe i don’t exactly know, but it sounds gorgeous.

**sarcasticsobs** (9): So pretty. Hello KAYTRANADA.

**saviorARMY101** (9): this is a vibe

**bogo** (8): so serene so comforting

**freeofblasphemy** (8): DRAKE BTFO

**Nagisoid** (8): I'm gaslighting myself into thinking THAT line is a Queen reference and not a Drake shoutout to keep my sanity

**qazz23** (8): good transition from the previous track, nice smooth sounding track with punchy bass

**ss2811** (8): love kaash on this

**uberpigeon** (8): if this gets sent to all stars will it be a meta angel

**welcome2thejam** (8): Tense 3AM drive after a night out type track

**WaneLietoc** (7.5): work horse cut

**1998tweety** (7): ended charli xcx

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what happens in vegas i guess gets put in your newest critically acclaimed album

**Lynflower680** (7): I initially gave it a lower score but after a re-listen it grew on me.

**ReallyCreative** (7): I’m being SO not afraid right now

# Demons

**afs** (6.5): i didnt notice this passed by oof

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): But are they biblically accurate???

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (6): the imagery and aesthetic for this album... she was going for the shifting girls demographic

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): songs abt LA are always so romantic as if it is not a walkable city with no public transport :pussyeyeroll:

**horridhendy** (5): Kinda boring

**IIIHenryIII** (5): it’s pretty but it could be hot

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i was so bored

**runaway3212** (4): im sorry I just hate songs about LA

**cremeebrulee** (10): Everyone is so ugly for this placement like what the hell…I’ll admit I’m not too well-versed in reggaeton, so arguments calling it Tiktok-bait or stale go over me. Likewise, I’m not fluent in Spanish so anything about the lyrics isn’t something I can argue against either. I just find this to be a fun, harmless song that is honestly quite addictive and easy to listen to. When you take Abcedfg out of the picture, this becomes thee most controversial song in the rate, so its departure near the end of Day 1 isn’t surprising, though a little annoying imo.

**plastichaxan** (10): This was EXTREMELY robbed! Y’all really hate fun and I will never be able to forgive you for this popheads

**jman457** (6.7): It was cute

---

# Music for a Sushi Restaurant

**babadork** (11): This is one of my most listened to songs of 2022. The food is also one of the exceptions to my hatred of sweet meats.

**frogaranaman** (11): idc this song is absolute heat

**akanewasright** (10): now that the fans have all had their turn yelling about how much they hate this, can some of us admit that this kinda slays?

**Awkward\_King** (10): she need to make more purely ass shaking music. a song for the sluts who happen to be at the japanese restaurant

**bigbigbee** (10): Todd in the Shadows sometimes asks his followers what the best 2 seconds of music in the year is. For me, “la rosalia, HOO-“ is my contender, rivaled only by JHope going DUHHHHHHHHHHHHH in Arson lol

**DaHumanTorch** (10): not even spanish speaking people know what the fuck she's talking about

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the girlies who get it get it

**horridhendy** (10): I get that this is an egregious example of a song made for tiktok but who cares when it's this catchy and fun. One of those songs that I thought would wear out but I still love it.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): ate

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is so fun like u can't deny it. the beat is so infectious you can't help but move to it.

**throwaway-7650** (10): this/SAOKO are almost the same song idg the hate at all

**vexastrae** (10): one of my favorite things to order at the orange caramel restaurant!

**aquariuszns** (9): song slays idgaf

**Frajer** (9): bienvenida a Nuevo York we've been waiting for you

**JIRACHI** (9): Chicken Teriyaki the food is actually mid but this song is not

**ReallyCreative** (9): my order from Sarku she’s so real

**auntiegay2** (8.5): In which she ate, etc.

**-mczrv-** (8.1): chorus is undeniable

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): this song is fine but the haters are really fucking annoying

**Ambrosia42** (8): it’s fun, the beat is a bit weird but in a way that i enjoy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): her inspo board for this album was naomi smalls and sailor moon and she decided to serve cunt with just that

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Wow is she trying to be Young Nudy with that title

**qazz23** (8): i like chicken teriyaki 🐔

**Stryxen** (8): the tirando sombras como drag queen line is so low score rate comments trying to be shady queens coded

**UselessTacooo** (8): scootercore

**1998tweety** (7.5): yum

**afs** (7.5): hangry

# Chickened out with these scores

**pig-serpent** (7.5): This song's a bop but I wish it evolved more. I feel like there's a lot left on the table here.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this was such a choice for a single lmao

**runaway3212** (7): you know what I deserve?

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7): maybe if tinashe and twigs had mentioned drag queens and fried chicken more frequently

**sarcasticsobs** (6.4): Beat (for the most part) fine enough. One bit is a lil' annoying, that like, horn, or whatever

**alexismateofan** (6): out here making me hungry in the middle of the night WHERE am i gonna get Chicken Teriyaki huh. Didn’t think about THAT did you.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I go back and forth on this one and I’ve landed on it being pleasantly dumb.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (6): Hot garbage; entertaining and all, but garbage nonetheless

**ss2811** (6): tbh when it first dropped i was gagged but over time it’s grown off me, it’s cute but also just not as strong as the rest of this album

**TiltControls** (6): Well now I'm just hungry

**WaneLietoc** (6): five songs into the album and I think I'm surprised how fast I've gotten here. some cuts I want longer; then I get here and somehow I want to get off the ride. is the beat TOO *tries to find word* commercial for me? like that feels like such a stupid cop out for an obvious brevity-laden heater. but seriously, ~~Music For a Japanese BBQ Joint~~ the Chicken Teriyaki ditty felt way too minimal even in the dance choreography. rosalia is a delight, but the beat is on auto pilot and the lyrics, a woozy mess of rich flexes, comes off more as a pop advert than the strange tantalizing promise of pop art that a cut like this flirts with under its skeletal structure. the q-zone ratio was off I guess :/

**indie\_fan\_** (3.5): oigo "me tan tirando sombras como drag queen" y me acuerdo de los pesadillas que tenia cuando primer escuche taylor cantar "shade never made anybody less gay"

**apatel27** (3): It's bait

**bogo** (3): oh great, she made the most barebones reggaeton song i've ever heard

**ImADudeDuh** (2): the way she keeps mentioning drag queens on this album yet refuses to go on Drag Race Espana? the cultural appropriation LEAPT /s

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): this song has children’s educational music youtube channel vibes to it. like if you told me pinkfong made this song i would believe you

**flava** (0): as a camp enthusiast i feel, pandered to, but in a very condescending way

**moonshxne** (0): overcooked, stale, dry and flaky to taste

**Nagisoid** (0): The SNL performance of this song is really awful and I'm glad it's not on the official website anymore. Either way if you told a Rosalía fan back during the Mal Querer days she would make this song they'd probably think you were trolling, and for good reason. This is not actually a song; it's a beat and a bunch of TikTok bait drifting through sonic wavelengths, and that's one of the music trends I despise the most in modern music.

**cremeebrulee** (10): Our last cut of the day and it goes to a song I did not expect to take it at all. Diablo was one of the album’s immediate highlights for me— it’s a song that transcends language barriers because it really does sound /that/ demonic. It’s also a song that keeps you on your toes, from the way Rosalía switches her inflection to the respite that is James Blake’s interlude. I find the entire track immaculately made and I wished it could’ve made it over the border to Day 2, where it was hovering for a bit. But truly, this song deserved to place even better than that.

**plastichaxan** (10): Her making a song about the fans that wanted her to make another El Mal Querer she knew this album would be too controversial but also the best thing ever

**jman457** (8.6): Really nice beat switch with James Blake coming in

# The SweeTees are everywhere

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): 333 x 2

**CrimsonROSET** (7): whats with the devil messing with the girlies tinashe look out

# Godly

**akanewasright** (10): The way it goes from angelic to demon slut music >>>

**beeozan** (10): i have no clever comments so can i ask for a lexie liu - diablo interlude 🙄

**Frajer** (10): she's doing the Kendrick Lamar alien voice

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love her for featuring James Blake but I also hate her for underutilizing him

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): this is just wild

**nt96** (9.3): Imma play Diablo while this is playing

**DaHumanTorch** (9): describe my personal style in 3 words? 50% angel. 50% diabla. 100% me.

**saviorARMY101** (9): Damn all these switchups are so interesting, and didn't expect james blake to appear lol

**ss2811** (9): absolutely love the transition halfway through and james blake singing in spanish is the cherry on top

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): love the high pitched voice it scratches a little itch in my brain

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): very intricate and interesting song. much to think about

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): “James Blake makes a brief appearance, bringing contrast to the track.” oh okay. hey

**horridhendy** (8): Solid track but not one of my faves on the album.

**vexastrae** (8): charli plays xenoblade and rosalia plays diablo

**welcome2thejam** (8): Indie-coded. A James Blake cameo!?

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): thought this was named after the moshi monster then realised their name was diavlo this is so embarassing

**seanderlust** (7.5): oh hi james blake! really did not expect to see you here

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): James Blake being on this track makes so much sense

**WaneLietoc** (7.3): one of the more "par for the course" cuts. sorta just like a *spins wheel* orange milk filler track. also why is james blake here? wife guy go home

**afs** (7): omg i want to give a different rating to these songs but they all hit like 7s

**qazz23** (7): this has a hyperpop feel to it

**ReallyCreative** (7): one of the best video games ever released exactly exactly

# Diabolical

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): I kinda enjoyed the play between the chipmunk vocals and the "regular" vocals. Cool sounds around 1:30. Didn't like the James Blake thing

**alexismateofan** (6): Doing something to my brain. The parts where it’s slower and gentle are really good but the faster parts just seem to struggle in comparison. It’s trying to be two things at once, I fear.

**buzzwhyte** (6): hurts to give a song on this album any less than 7 but whew...

**Nagisoid** (6): Why are James Blake and Tara the Android duking it out?

**runaway3212** (6): the void that stares back

**freeofblasphemy** (5.5): Okay it’s like the slower songs here are either stunning or rather dull

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): emily montes unironically sounds like this but better

**flava** (2): oh that baby voice did nothing to endear me, and the fact it came back. But my biggest problem is mostly do the lack of any real hooks to make any of it tolerable

**bogo** (0): cannot believe she made such a pretty intro only for it to lead into one of the most annoying songs i have ever heard
