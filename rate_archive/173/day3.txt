Eclectic Artpop Rate Reveal Day 3: Tears in the Queup (cause this rate's got me fucked up)
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/13u5aj5/eclectic_artpop_rate_reveal_day_3_tears_in_the/

Welcome [raters](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1037525072950341732/1112311020296339496/Screen_Shot_2023-05-28_at_2.26.47_AM.png?width=2591&height=1174) to the final day of the 333Caprimami (or the Eclectic Artpop Rate if anyone is still calling it that) Reveal. Today we'll be revealing our top songs from Tinashe's *333*, FKA twigs' *Caprisongs*, and Rosal√≠a's *Motomami*, including our winner!

My co-hosts /u/plastichaxan, /u/jman457, and I will be revealing what placed **#18 - #1** in our main rate at **2PM EST** or about an hour after this post goes up. If you can, be sure to join us in the [**Queup room**](https://www.queup.net/join/caprimami333) where we will be listening to the songs (and some other surprises) as they go out. If you can't make it to the Queup, no worries, as we'll also be in this thread and on the [#rates channel on the Popheads discord](https://discord.gg/popheads).

**cremeebrulee** (10): This beautiful, show-stopping, incredible, amazing, stunning, gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous song. Every part of this works and all those beat switches are executed flawlessly. I especially love the ‚Äúlife feels so long‚Äù lyric, it almost serves as a somber foil to *Songs For You*‚Äôs glittery ‚ÄúLife‚Äôs Too Short‚Äù. This was definitely a song I considered 11ing, so I'm glad it got one and managed to slip over to Day 3, but I would've loved to see it go way, way further.

**jman457** (9.2): Now this is a great groovy summer track

**plastichaxan** (8): The hosts server, docs and spreadsheets:

---

# @uberbot remind me in 2 years to send this to Rateran‚Äôs Day

**akanewasright** (10): This whole album feels like Tinashe going back to her more alt-y R&B roots, and this song sounds like a more summery version of the stuff she‚Äôd put out in her mixtape era (or in one of the deep cuts on Aquarius). ‚ÄúI SPENT FIFTY FIVE ON THE FILL UP‚Äù is an album highlight, as is the beat switch at the end

**Awkward\_King** (10): she melted her vagina down, the particles formed air waves and they unionised to become the song you are hearing right now

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song is for the girlies who live their lives surrounded by a conscious flock of 10,000 sticky notes.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): small reminder to Tinashe Jorgensen Kachingwe when I went to your concert and you only played 45 seconds of best song ever ‚ÄúHopscotch‚Äù, I will never forgive u </3

**nt96** (10): if this doesn‚Äôt make day 3, I'll riot

**oscarbrierley1** (10): yass 3 songs in 1. each section on its own is great, but together they encapsulate the whole album so well.

**qazz23** (10): good transition to the funky part, also one of the best basslines on the album

**sarcasticsobs** (10): FUNKY BREAKDOWN??? God, this had 3 sections all that I loved and in opinion really meshed well together, fantastic

**saviorARMY101** (10): I love all the switchups in this song

**shipperondeck** (10): good 4 cool walks around town

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the first beat change was "damn" and the second was "OH DAMN"

**throwaway-7650** (10): rate hosts confirming my position on the extension list:

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): wanted to give this song a lower score so my average would look less suspicious but i can't help it every part of this is so good

**UselessTacooo** (10): I SPENT 55 ON A FILL UP FILL UP üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•üí•

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): I love how this song shifts into the funky section in the middle. This seems like an introspective song. She is thinking about what she really wants out of life, what makes her who she is. She seems to say that maybe the things we go through make us who we are and that pain is fleeting and can help us grow. She also makes a point that even though time can seem to move slowly and we can feel like we will live forever, it‚Äôs all actually very short and temporary, and we should enjoy the moment and not ruminate on past tragedies.

**alexismateofan** (9): This is the kind of music that would play during a sexy moment in a high stakes movie. Like the protagonist has seduced a man back to her room in order to get him away for the heist to continue and she has no feelings for him but pretends to distract him, while her best friend is unlocking the safe at the same time.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Her hit/miss percentage on this album's mid-song switch-ups gotta be craaaaazy

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): UGH I FORGOT ABOUT THIS BEAT SWITCH WHAT THE FUCK. But also what‚Äôs even better than how Tinashe pulls off these sudden pivots is how she goes back to where she was before, but she‚Äôs carrying over this new energy so that it doesn‚Äôt feel like a regression

**seanderlust** (8.5): what a vibe

**WaneLietoc** (8.4): right when i think "we hit autopilot" tinashe does that songwriting strategy she has on the album of putting two ideas together on one cut to co-exist in a vibe. and that back 2/3rds (well really, the bridge) immediately piqued me up a notch

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the closest we‚Äôll get to rating Remi Wolf

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is groovy and I like it

**Nagisoid** (8): Everybody's going crazy and we never stop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): this is kinda Neon White soundtrack coded

**aquariuszns** (7.7): love the second half

**DirtyRat583** (7.7): kpop type rap

**uberpigeon** (7.6): me using uberbot

**afs** (7.5): wait is that tinashe at the halfway mark

**ss2811** (7): super slept on

# RemindMe! 2 years 30 days did this lose Rateran‚Äôs Day  

**horridhendy** (6.5): Seems a bit confused as a track - kinda like two tracks in one and not sure it's in a good way? I like both separately but together it's a bit jarring.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this is a cursed comment but that rap verse is really k-pop coded

**runaway3212** (5.5): this isnt bad but it's nothing special

**plastichaxan** (11): This was my favorite song on the album since first listen. The mention of butterflies (which is very related to my drag character), the switches in songs that always blow my mind, the experience when I saw this live and it closed the concert and what I took that night hit in just the right way ugh I‚Äôm kinda glad this wasn‚Äôt too controversial to miss day 3

**cremeebrulee** (10): This song is absolutely unhinged, so I get why people dislike it, but it just hits the grooves in my brain just right. The switches flip just at the right moment and the unrelenting drums are incredible. I am so glad this managed to claw its way back into Day 3 after some low scores and give us a lot of shitpost material!

**jman457** (10): The drumline ate. Rosalia in her HBCU era ate, sorry.

**plastichaxan** (10): One of my favorite old reggaeton songs inspiring her to do this while sampling Burial I really cannot compliment her mind enough

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): Candy is a track I've found underwhelming on release, but has snuck up on me since. The melodies are sweet & sticky and I soon found it stuck in my head quite often since this rate started. My Spanish is very rudimentary, but the chorus is one I can understand, especially with how mournfully Rosal√≠a emotes in its delivery. It seems to be a track we all liked, but no one especially loved, so it‚Äôs exit here without any 11s feels apt.

**jman457** (8.7): a great Art pop track

---

# Sweet like candy

**-mczrv-** (10): would have been an eleven but its a three way tie between each artist for first place pt.3

**akanewasright** (10): the bait and switch of me finding out a song called ‚ÄúCandy‚Äù got a music video on the day of the album‚Äôs release and thinking it was gonna be another brash banger, only for it to sample Burial. It rules though

**beeozan** (10): balladphobia is OVER

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Cavities more like yassvities! Oh that‚Äôs horrendous lemme leave it.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this was near the bottom of my ranking when the album first dropped but slowly rose to the near top. love how shimmery and sparkly the production is

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): forgot about that Candy song and got a jumpscare seeing ‚ÄúPlan B‚Äù in the genius lyrics

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): Grateful for this song's chokehold, it's magical in its quiet grandiosity

**horridhendy** (10): This is beautiful. One of my faves - wish this could also be an 11.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it sounds sad but my ass is saying otherwise

**memezaharamole** (10): my second fav Burial song interpolated was the main reason I checked this album out, and then it was in rotation for the rest of the year, she does what any great interpolation does and makes it her own with full respect to the original.

**qazz23** (10): definite earworm, that melody really sticks with you, also love the Burial sample

**saviorARMY101** (10): sad perreando

**shipperondeck** (10): sometimes i like this even more than saoko so i debated a lot which one deserved the 11 (in reality i would give this an 11 but saoko actually has a shot at winning so)

**Ambrosia42** (9.5): gorgeous tbh and a bop, and i had to go listen to the referenced song because I was curious and it was fun

**ss2811** (9): love the lyrics on here

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): very cute

**seanderlust** (8.5): she sounds so pretty on the chorus

**alexismateofan** (8): you tell that man what‚Äôs what

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wasnt that her song with billie

**Nagisoid** (8): Imagine if the Chencho Corleone tankings in other rates somehow extend to this one too

**Stryxen** (8): ate‚Ä¶

**vexastrae** (8): and when i start infodumping about filipino kendis what then

**WaneLietoc** (7.8): every time I listen to this in the car I would brace myself for the crash after saoko. like really? atmospheric club? it wasn't until I saw the music video that I understood the purpose of the ditty was for karaoke kickbacks and whatnot. That's not my type of party or banger but I think I appreciate it. also the nothings and yas and naass are used properly here. also this video exists in the Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift continuity timeline

**afs** (7.5): is it the candy im thinking about

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DgA3VhnUwAAzfF4.jpg

**bogo** (7.5): hey look i love archangel by burial too but this song just kinda makes me want to listen to that instead so i gotta take points off for that

**Lynflower680** (7): Not my fave but I‚Äôm giving it extra points for the Burial sample.

**nt96** (7): the way I collapsed when I learned she interpolated Archangel by Burial

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): Feels weird to hear Burial's "Archangel" sampled in this. I really like the original and I love that Rosalia sang along with the melody but I'm still not sure how I feel about this. I'll just give it a 7 and be done with it.

**runaway3212** (7): we love rosalia

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i feel like this is such a whiplash from saoko lol

**sarcasticsobs** (6.8): Pretty vocals, not too much eliciting super super strong feelings, but I like some of the production flourishes enough

# No he olvidado estas scores

**flava** (6): ok this one was pretty great until I got to minute 2 and she started doing these weird moans, and then it got a lot worse when the weird moans got weirder towards the end

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Oh gee I think it‚Äôs a bit too soon for the melancholy crystalline art pop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): for a song about candy there sure is no sugar or excitement in this at all

**cremeebrulee** (10): This song really snuck under a lot of people's radars as a Day 3 entry; it was one of the better performing tracks on *Caprisongs*, nearly always here. It was also one of my 11 contenders (which makes me happy that it did get one) because it has the best songwriting on the record. I've cried to this song while doing my AOTY writeup; the lines "the world is out there I hear it calling / but home is a place that makes my heart sing" just struck me at the wrong (right?) time. I'm thousands of miles away from the place I would call home, the place I feel the least alone, and I often wonder if I made the right call moving away. Personal feelings aside, I love that darjeeling highlights an underrated step in the healing process: finding a community to support you at your times of need. So much of self-care that is preached emphasizes the "self" portion, but the truth is that a support system will do wonders for the struggles you face. It's a mesmerizing track that absolutely does South London, twig's declared hometown, justice. And honestly, this might be the most I've ever rooted for British people in my life...

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Kinda admire Jorja Smith giving her all in collaborations with some of my favorite artists and then giving (mostly) nothing in her solo stuff it‚Äôs kinda funny

**jman457** (7.8): Really strong lyrics

---

# We love you /u/darjeelingdarkroast!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): popheads users when they rate a song that sounds similar to an echo chamber rater‚Äôs username üòÆüòÆüòÆ

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this song completes the darj teaboo arc

**flava** (8): subs fave ü§ùcaprimami - artists including songs on the albums that are the name of other raters

**uberpigeon** (7): DARKROAST?????

**1998tweety** (9): they ate this

**alexismateofan** (9): I really love the interplay of the vocals where twigs is feeling lonely in London but Unknown T says how much he loves it. I think it‚Äôs really well done and one of the best features on this rate, no question.

**nt96** (9): https://i0.wp.com/the97.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Mariah-idkher.gif?fit=1280%2C720&ssl=1

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): music box + drill drum pattern production is wild but somehow works?

**horridhendy** (8): Omg, the Olive "You're not alone" interpolation! My Dad was obsessed with that album when I was a kid so it was total flashbacks - instant nostalgia for me.

**oscarbrierley1** (8): twigz youre from gloucestershire why are you trying to rap like a roadman, we've heard the way you actually speak on other songs.

**saviorARMY101** (8): this sounds like an ice spice song but better

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): honestly this is just a whole bop but in a muted way. it's a muted bop.

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): RAYE?

**afs** (7): i was scrolling through reddit and clicked off to write this comment, then something called "dwarf metal" played out of nowhere in the bg and i thought omg she still has in it her

# I‚Äôll wait for the end of this song

**UselessTacooo** (5.6): why is drill here

**Nagisoid** (5): I wish I liked this more but it's just okay, really enjoy the lyrics though

**cremeebrulee** (10): If I had to name the standout tracks from *333*, I would probably list 6 songs before I would get to this one. That isn't to say it's a bad song (I did give it a perfect score after all), but that "I Can See The Future" exudes a natural coolness that can get lost against the bigger and flashier tracks here. When isolated, it's easier to appreciate Tinashe's self-assured delivery, especially on lines like "...and it looks like you and I". On another note, I adore when artists are self-referential in their works; so the fact this song is named after a line from ["Indigo Child"](https://youtu.be/ikceJwAwazM) off of *Aquarius* just feels like an extra treat for longtime fans. I really expected this song to leave yesterday due to how mellow it is, but having it consistently stay in Day 3 has been unexpected, though appreciated.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Me when I mentioned hosting this when it was an idea that couldn‚Äôt be submitted then I wasn‚Äôt chosen as host but then I was omfg

**jman457** (6.7): I‚Äôll be honest this didn‚Äôt do much for me

# Yup, that‚Äôs me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): Raven Baxter would be so proud

**Frajer** (10): Raven be wilding

**TiltControls** (8): Ready to hear the That's So Raven theme whenever this goes out

**1998tweety** (7.5): okay raven symone

# Predictions of varying degrees of correctness

**Awkward\_King** (10): me too girl ur gonna win

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): She saw me getting two more 11 wins in May omg thank you Tinashe.

**seanderlust** (10): me claiming to be a psychic after i knew that midnights was mostly going out day 1 in 2022 ult

**throwaway-7650** (10): me predicting that charli's losing streak stays intact

**ReallyCreative** (9): she saw the Ratrick results and said NOTHING

**runaway3212** (9): me too this is going out day 2 with a 7.532 average

**welcome2thejam** (9): Forget about us for a second, can you see next week's Mega Millions numbers

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): my grandma when she had a dream about planes catching fire a few months before 9/11

**bogo** (7.5): oh yeah if you can see the future tell me who wins the rate then

**CrimsonROSET** (7): thinking about the perfect alex prediction that turned out to be a ruse this is why we dont trust men

# And it looks like you and I <3

**amr** (10): NIGHTRIDE...........TWO

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this has such mean girl energy (complimentary)

**JIRACHI** (10): this is such a tinashe track idk how to explain it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): bitch me too tf

**saviorARMY101** (10): BANGERRR

**Stryxen** (10): YASSSSS songs to crawl on the floor to

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): how come I‚Äôve never heard this pick-up line before? It‚Äôs genius!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): oh my GOD. STRINGS. Kinda wish the chorus hit the same highs for me as the verses and pre-chorus did. But still: oh my god

**shipperondeck** (9.5): so so cool shes the chillest the coolest

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): I appreciate the reference to Indigo Child. A lot of this album has to do with the past/present/future and life as a simulation and an imagined present or future, and this song takes a fairly simple concept (dreaming about the possibility of a relationship with someone) and turns it into something ethereal.

**freeofblasphemy** (9): And just like that she slips into total badass *Nightride* mode, every word dripping out with utter confidence and production and hooks to match. (OH I, OH I means ‚Äúohio, hi‚Äù)

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (9): Love the production.

**qazz23** (9): good vocals and love those background strings

**WaneLietoc** (8.7): no you can't see the future the bois are just oogling for u in bed and will go n' get it. my defense for this is tht every time she does the chorus she has a lil' climax in delivery

**aquariuszns** (8.5): bop

**indie\_fan\_** (8.5): we were robbed of this song having its own video

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): i love tinashe's deeper register

**alexismateofan** (8): Just a full ass vibe.

**beeozan** (8): it's an accomplishment how the yummy yummy part doesn't stand out immensely from the rest of the song

**Nagisoid** (8): Can we let her make the rate bingos?

**ss2811** (8): she ateeee on this one its super underrated

**babadork** (7.9): A point off for each time she says ‚Äúyummy‚Äù

**afs** (7): can you remove him from magdalene then pls

**frogaranaman** (7): me when I go into a record store and see a copy of HNDRXX in the distance

**horridhendy** (7): It's alright.

**vexastrae** (7): in her nostradamus bag

# She could‚Äôve probably saw these scores coming
**pig-serpent** (6.5): I've heard a lot about this Tinashe, and now that I'm listening to her... this is one of the plainest songs I've heard in a while. I really like the "and it looks like you and I" line but nothing out stands out here.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): 33333333333333333333333333

**uberpigeon** (4): a song about seeing the future could be really cool but this is really dull also theres a sound in this that sounds like the league of legends chat message sound and its messing me up

**cremeebrulee** (10): X brings the first dosage of energy on the album tracklist-wise; it's no wonder that this was pushed as a single 6 months after *333* was released. The beat is immediate, the lyrics are sexy, and the collaboration is ... a little divisive amongst raters. Tinashe has thrown out a couple of potential collaborators (one being Victoria Mon√©t who I can imagine sliding on this track *very* well), but we've ended up with Jeremih here as the biggest name on the record (I guess we all can't book The Weeknd). This track is another one I expected to leave in Day 2 and I think a lot of yall did too, considering how many people asked for this to go out already. But it consistently hovered right outside the top 10. 

**plastichaxan** (10): The people saying I outsold??? Thank you guys omfg

**jman457** (8.2): A fun little jam

---

# We love you, /u/plastichaxan!

**afs** (6.5): poppy found outselling this

**uberpigeon** (5): poppy outsold

# X as in the Roman Numeral

**alexismateofan** (10): I went for the easy joke but this song also slays so‚Ä¶

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ariana grande you have been marked.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i listened to the Tinashe episode of the popheads podcast, Main Pod Girl, where she said she wanted Ariana or Victoria Monet featured on this song (she also said Rina but that would be kind of awkward imo, giving Lady Gaga on Beyonce‚Äôs Video Phone lksdkls). I‚Äôd kill for that, but I love the rest of this song so much and I‚Äôve had several personal reflections and healing journeys to embrace with radical positivity Jeremih‚Äôs fuckboi feature <3

**IIIHenryIII** (10): ten, it‚Äôs literally the title

**Lynflower680** (10): BAD BITCH SHE LOOK FINE SHE DOES IT

**memezaharamole** (10): hopefully beats the male verse curse, even though it's pretty bad, Tinashe carries the rest so well. Video clip is amazing too, the seaweed dress is amazing

**pig-serpent** (10): This beat is a lot of fun. Easily my favorite song on this album.

**qazz23** (10): it marks the spot, and X means 10

**ReallyCreative** (10): what a cunty letter like she‚Äôs always multiplying something to the equation

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i didn't love this song at first, although i did enjoy it. then it ended up being my second most played on the album and one of my top songs for 2021. i do wish she got rina on the song like she initially wanted to bc the SERVE IT WOULD HAVE BEEN.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): unlike the pok√©mon game, this tinashe song is one of the best

**UselessTacooo** (10): man good?

**shipperondeck** (9.9): bop

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): This beat is INFECTIOUS omfg. Such a sexy song that makes me wanna dance. I do wonder how it would sound with someone like Ariana on the track like she originally wanted, but i like it as is too.

**akanewasright** (9.5): Jeremih‚Äôs just kinda saying shit here and I love that for him

**CrimsonROSET** (9): she was so one piece coded for this

**Frajer** (9): Jeremih go to horny jail

**JIRACHI** (9): Kylie Minogue in 2007:

**sarcasticsobs** (9): What in the video-game-soundtrack-sounding-ass intro? Oh god, it's still going as the song goes, thank goodness

**saviorARMY101** (9): BOP!

**throwaway-7650** (9): IX actually

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Trends I'd like to end in the year 2023: Women singing songs that talk about sex in metaphorical and seductive ways ft. men saying shit like "TIGHT PUSSY FUCK YO G-SPOT"

**1998tweety** (8.5): what i add to the end of a sentence when im being slightly flirty

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Really just love Hitmaka‚Äôs down-to-business but still lively beat. And yeah this could just be obligatory ‚Äúsex bop with extra-horny guest‚Äù and maybe it is but goddamn is it a really good sex bop with extra-horny guest

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): ‚Äúfuck your g spot trying to find your ass‚Äù - y‚Äôknow, at least he admits it was an accident

**aquariuszns** (8): not my favorite feature but still a bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Tinashe and the birthday sex king

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the porn horror film???

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (8): It sounds nice, but I think it runs a bit generic.

**ss2811** (8): i still wish ariana was on this but jeremih did a fine job

**Stryxen** (8): ohhhh its sex

**welcome2thejam** (8): The pirate outfits stay ON during sex

**WaneLietoc** (7.8): wait that's jeremih not famed twitch streamer jerma :/

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): the 2nd best final fantasy

**vexastrae** (7.5): [im a pirate arrrrrrr](https://twitter.com/TomHolland1996/status/279311973240414209)

**horridhendy** (7): It's fairly good.

**oscarbrierley1** (7): of course the most generic song on the album is its most streamed. its fun and catchy but not my favourite

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this chorus is so good im gonna conveniently ignore the rest of the song

# X as in the opposite of a ‚úì

**bogo** (6): who let the man in here

**beeozan** (5): hooks me from the start but tinashe's rapping + ohohoh part + the feature all bring it down a bit for me

**Nagisoid** (5): Give me just a little bit more, a little bit of...

**runaway3212** (5): this is a bit repetitive im sorry

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): i feel the need to justify this because i know a lot of people love it, but it just does nothing for me compared to the other singles/single material on the album! its not even like jeremih's verse or the production i dont mind any of it it just never really comes together for me.

**flava** (1): ok Jeremih, but you will never top Don‚Äôt Tell ‚ÄòEm

**plastichaxan** (10): The way this struggled to be day 3 for so long was insane to me and (I think) never reaching top 10??? Kinda criminal of us! This is why Charli is never winning a rate

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): Poppy is right in that this is the highest place this song has ever reached, which is a little tragic. meta angel is definitely the thesis of *Caprisongs*, a statement of rebirth. (The music video does have twigs killing a past, sadder version of herself in case you missed the message). There's no lack of relatable songs on the mixtape, but this tracks hits so hard when you feel like you have no control over the events in your life and when the insecurities speak over every other voice in your head. There's small pockets of hope in the track, reminders of what it feels like when you're a winner, or during its intro with twigs' close friends believing in her. It's a gorgeously crafted track with the most 11s we've seen yet in this rate.

**jman457** (7.3): took a while to get into, but when it took off it got good.

---

# It‚Äôs Charli baby?

**Nagisoid** (10): This is my visions by Charli XCX

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (10): Sounds a lot like Charli XCX but I'm not complaining.

**vexastrae** (9): in her choli xbox hyperpop bag

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): ch‚Ä¶chorlie????

**ignitethephoenix** (7): why did she get possessed by Charli XCX halfway

**PrimaryCrusaders** (7): The autotuned vocals at 2:03 are giving Charli XCX Pop 2 vibes lol

**Awkward\_King** (3): when a charli xcx fan is self aware

# Scores getting higher and higher

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): BUT WHEN IM WINNING IM A FLYER!!! SOPRANO IN THE CHOIR!!!!

**lexiaredery** (11): Going back and forth giving my 11 to this song, but this deserves it so much

**moonshxne** (11): ü•π

**akanewasright** (10): ‚Äúit gets higher and higher‚Äù little secrets mashup WHEN

**amr** (10): I REALLY DO

**buddhacharm** (10): this song literally inspired a playlist of mine entitled "biblically accurate cock and balls"

**cocosairdep** (10): she devoured

**IIIHenryIII** (10): holy angel, what a divine song

**Lynflower680** (10): Get‚Äôs me emotional every time.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I am so obssessed with that slurping sound at the start it's so aurally pleasing is this what ASMR feels like

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I hate this intro and I hate this song. I want to jump off a bridge

**throwaway-7650** (10): I keep thinking I heard a slur when she whispers "saggi moon"

**UselessTacooo** (10): that‚Äôs so meta of her

**WaneLietoc** (10): see now THATS an epic gamer intro. the restrained auto tune rules under the secondary voice. claps are nice. confessional and asynchronous tempos "is this microtime?"

**welcome2thejam** (10): First verse made me feel like a literal angel came down and blessed me with a lil kiss on the forehead, I legit felt like weepin a little

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): ‚ÄúI wish I had help from a deeper force, some kind of meta angel, then they could whisper all the answers, and maybe life would just slow down, I don‚Äôt think that I‚Äôll make it on my own‚Äù ‚Ä¶yeah I feel this

**aquariuszns** (9.5): this song <33

**auntiegay2** (9.5): In which Twigs confirms she‚Äôs a literal Angel.

**saviorARMY101** (9.5): man the production is insane

**shipperondeck** (9.5): intro again is a bit too long but ughhhh wow what a song

**-mczrv-** (9.4): this is a rate to listen to with good headphones if there ever was one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Idc I like (most of the) the conversational intros and outros on this album. I really do!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): also why did she end this song calling herself a bimbo

**Frajer** (9): Capri Sun Lunchables Gushers bimbo bimbo bimbo

**freeofblasphemy** (9): holy FUCK. It is insane how much this improves with this amazing track. Like, I heard the first two and was like ‚Äúwait is this mixtape actually bad?‚Äù But no it is at least good because it has this song on it. Why wasn‚Äôt this the opener? ‚ÄúIN MY IN MY IN MY‚Äù

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): I'm gleaming in self-reflection and quiet grandiosity here... The GoPro footage style video with her getting shot by an arrow was a gag too

**Stryxen** (9): throw it in the fire. it = something bad, idk i‚Äôll probably forget to finish this joke

**bogo** (8.5): i'm floating

**impla77** (8.5): one of the most endearing intros in this mixtape, followed by a beautiful song

**afs** (8): one day she'll have her metal angel moment and yall wont be ready

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): i fear there was a timeline where twigs would go heavy towards being a Facebook Meta Influencer aaaaa

**runaway3212** (8): some good food I must say

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i would appreciate it if she didnt keep calling me a bimbo at the end of the song

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): pisces moon, scorpio venus, libra sun... astrology nerds what does that mean

**seanderlust** (7.5): i really do :pleading:

**babadork** (7.4): There‚Äôs almost an entire minute of intros.

**beeozan** (7): *un-hypers your hyperpop*

**ss2811** (7): she did her thing

# But when I‚Äôm losing, I‚Äôm a flop

**qazz23** (6): don't care for the processed vocals but like the drumming

**uberpigeon** (6): if this gets sent to all stars will it be a meta meta angel

**horridhendy** (5.5): I think the spoken bit at the beginning is so charming. Not a big fan of the vocal modulation here, it's overkill. Kinda sounds all over the place. I dunno.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): the ironic thing is, no one who is ‚Äúmeta‚Äù is an angel. Oppression of mid and low tiers is inherently evil and therefore a barrier of entry to heaven.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): she hears voices? Her mind is so sick and twisted

**slimboyfriend** (5): ‚ÄúPisce Veen‚Äù sounds disgusting

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): it's not bad but i'm not enjoying myself either

**1998tweety** (4.5): we need to separate the speaking and the singing

**oscarbrierley1** (4): i hate the spoken intro, eyeyye realllyyy duueuue. the rest of the song is cute but doesnt make up for the cringe. i always forget how english she is.

**alexismateofan** (3): Spoken word segment (at least it adds something) and autotune? Oh we‚Äôre really going through it now.

**plastichaxan** (10): This is so good like I don‚Äôt even mind a man being in it omfg

**cremeebrulee** (7): The lead single from *333* is officially our last elimination before top 10. Pasadena has always been a track that sort of existed to me; I was actually really frustrated with its placement since I couldn't hear what everyone else did and I honestly would've preferred some other songs to have taken its spot instead. When I watch the music video, I can /almost/ start to understand what makes this song beloved to people, the summer-y vibe feels its most tangible with Tinashe's performance. My thoughts aside, this song did very well for itself, almost never leaving the top 10 until the last few ballots.

**jman457** (6.2): cute summery song, but a little basic.

---

# Feeling right, feeling right, feeling right

**akanewasright** (10): I would never say this is one of my favorites from the album, but I do love every second. SHE WANT SEX SO GOOD IT MAKE A TEAR FALL

**Awkward\_King** (10): do do da do do

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I live about as far away from the ocean as you can in the U.S. so I can‚Äôt exactly relate to the beachy vibe of this song, but I love it anyway.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): whats a pasadena

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i was kind of clowning this song on being corny however i had the self-awareness to be like ‚Äúgirl you ARE corny too!‚Äù

**Frajer** (10): I hope Vampire Weekend knows she borrowed their hey hey hey

**IIIHenryIII** (10): thank you for making a song about California and not using the obvious, overused title

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the middle of the album is fucking HITTING

**JIRACHI** (10): this is very ass shaking inducing

**Lynflower680** (10): SUMMER VIBES BABYYYYYYY! Recommending this song next time I head to the beach with my friends.

**qazz23** (10): love the melodies and backing vocals, Buddy's verse is good also

**RandomHypnotica** (10): WARNING! This song can and WILL get you addicted to Tinashe, take it from me, do NOT LISTEN TO IT!!! IT WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): this title makes no sense, we don‚Äôt need to pass a dinna, she already ate!

**runaway3212** (10): maybe I do like songs about la after all

**saviorARMY101** (10): A BOPPP!

**ss2811** (10): this is my fav song on this album without a doubt, love buddy‚Äôs verse!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a real bop that got overshadowed by bouncin (can't argue there) but it's such a cute summer bop i wish it wasn't so forgotten

**WaneLietoc** (10): omg i love pasadena. i love driving up to go see a feels like floating showcase of ambient music in a japanese garden while sitting on a picnic blanket watching claire rousay across the water get down to the electronics! anyways tinashe has some really inspired fits here. especially that first one that finally feels like someone took y2k nonsense and updated and moved forward

**welcome2thejam** (10): Got me clapping & bouncing along like I'm a backup singer

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): summer bop

**Ambrosia42** (9.2): This is an interesting song because she is singing about how great things are, how everything is such a vibe, but there‚Äôs a touch of dissatisfaction as well. She is feeling restless, she sings, ‚ÄúI got a vision of a perfect night, but every day I end up goin through the motions. I wasn‚Äôt built for the simple life.‚Äù It‚Äôs like she is really enjoying the sunshine, and nature, and seeing her family and friends again, and having fleeting love affairs, but she still has trouble focusing on the present and simple pleasures. She is always thinking about other things. Things are never quite perfect, are they? But this feels like that moment of relief after a rough patch

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): my first exposure to pasadena, california was in dog with a blog. would like to stop associating that with this song but she served

**vexastrae** (9): i think people from california should be humbled by spending a winter day in canada

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): Involuntary head boppin' strikes again

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Perfectly summery and I loved it since release

**impla77** (8.3): feel like tinashe should be on the tourism board or something

**bogo** (8): fun fact the guy featured on this song is apparently part of a rap supergroup with jid and smino called "zoink gang" and idk why but i find that way funnier than i should

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): she‚Äôs never leaving California? Well, I‚Äôm not entering it anytime soon! [CANNED LAUGHTER]

**freeofblasphemy** (8): Fun number! Love how after the big emotional release song Tinashe is like ‚ÄúOkay time for the bop with Buddy and a little bit of subtle existentialism to keep things interesting‚Äù

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Buddy kind of sounds like b.o.b

**throwaway-7650** (8): it's fun! I had fun! it's something for the summertime, something for the girls to get ready and party to anyway where tf is pretty bitch music ‚ÅâÔ∏è

**1998tweety** (7.5): not the intro making me think of Thats What I Want

**horridhendy** (7.5): Good, solid. Feature is good too.

**alexismateofan** (7): not without-drawals!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Tinashe I'm literally walking around Pasadena right now. The fuck kind of penthouses are you talking about? Where can you see the ocean from here??
# Now I Do Hate California After All

**afs** (6.5): eek that feature was not it

**pig-serpent** (6.5): That beat slaps but I don't think there's much to this song past that.

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): does someone want to tell me how this fits on the album

**Nagisoid** (6): What if California is bad actually

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i like the rap verse but it feels really out of place on this song? like it wouldve sounded better without it idk

**uberpigeon** (6): isnt this where remi wolf went to be a serial killer

**flava** (4): I would no longer be calling him buddy if he ruined my song like that

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh my love was hovering on the border of the top 10 for so long, I was literally pulling my hair out... I'm SO glad it snuck in last minute. There's been a lot of discussion over twigs' choice to include her friends' spoken interludes onto the tracks themselves. But her decision is totally justified with their usage on this song. The opening section strikes a chord with anyone who's felt led on romantically and the closing section is just so endearing and sweet; it feels like one of my own girl friends trying to pick me up emotionally. Plus, the song itself is so tender and smooth, the "fussy like a pussycat" line flows so well. Calling this a top 3 *Caprisongs* track was definitely the right call by raters.

**plastichaxan** (10): The feel to pitch my voice up and just scream along to every lyric is very physical I‚Äôm soo happy this is top 10

**jman457** (6.2): It has nice elements but it drags a bit tbh

---

# It‚Äôs Charli, baby [2]

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I can kinda hear Charli singing this

**ImADudeDuh** (8): is the post-chorus charlixcxcoded or are they just both british

# [It‚Äôs Doja‚Ä¶](https://youtu.be/JIAEPxLllZc)

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): wait, she kinda sounds like Doja here

**pig-serpent** (6): Shot in the dark; this song was written for Doja Cat.

# Everybody knows that I want your love

**bogo** (11): oh i'm in love with this it's so beautiful and comfy

**WaneLietoc** (11): raising my hands in the air while doing jumping jacks at the festival. the live screen tries to catch me, but I am in a ghillie suit. no one can detect what i am truly up to. anyways this one goes out to da gal who I worked with at da coffee shop; she loved her dab pen, the smiths, and fka twigs. this ditty about boys that is so fucken vibed out is absolutely like deadlock her fav shit I bet. and this cut does rule! like on the level that outro just so flush with positivity in a way that makes me go "yass". it shouldn't work but it really does! and i can tik tok dance to it?!?!?! AJAHAHAHAHAHHHHHHHHHH

**akanewasright** (10): If I knew how to choreograph or dance, I think there‚Äôs a 3 person routine in here

**auntiegay2** (10): Anthemic fuck men kiss-off, but so tender and generous at the same time. And her vocals here are just sublime.

**Awkward\_King** (10): twigs is so real.. i hate men but i love being wanted... mother

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was the runner up for my 11. Unfortunately for it‚Ä¶the Fortnite music video song exists.

**buddhacharm** (10): It's actually not even funny how many people I've gestured towards this song irl... like any of my girlfriends going through things with their partners, with their talking stages, with their own feelings of self-worth etc. etc. ‚Äî this song has crazy remedial qualities and is one of her best ever, idec

**CrimsonROSET** (10): fuck men!!

**JIRACHI** (10): this is one of those songs where you have to shout out the words to truly get it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): sometimes I forget twigs is british but this song makes sure to remind me

**sarcasticsobs** (10): I don't fckning need this right now.

**seanderlust** (10): BYEEEEE

**Stryxen** (10): one of my favs of last year :) why u playin baby boy wots up ?

**throwaway-7650** (10): the outro is giving I don't care if you've got a dick... or a WAP...

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): my favorite voice note, probably my favorite song overall on the record, and one of my fave twigs songs <3

**vexastrae** (10): playing this every time i want my gamer bf to stop playing halo

**shipperondeck** (9.8): hhhhhhrrrhghgrhghhhOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHwoeiswoeiswoeiswoeiswoeis

**Ambrosia42** (9.6): One of those songs that immediately sounded like a classic or something familiar without sounding too generic or recycled, and it just feels so comforting

**alexismateofan** (9): girl he ain‚Äôt worth it don‚Äôt do it

**amr** (9): had to take a point off for the extended british monologue at the end as if we don't already start the song w one like girl let's get U some friends w normal accents

**Lynflower680** (9): WHY YOU PLAYING BABY BOY WHAT‚ÄôS UP

**Nagisoid** (9): The definition of pussycat pop

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (9): Great song, but it has this album's biggest problem, too much talking. Please, shhhhhhh. Give me music.

**saviorARMY101** (9): that girl speaking at the end is kind of annoying but a bop nonetheless

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Possibly the most accesible and infectious song in the ~mixtape~

**TiltControls** (8.5): I'm not usually a spoken intros person, but this one works

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): something for the summertime, something for the girls to get ready to

**afs** (8): as ms paula abdul once said, aye yay yayy

**DaHumanTorch** (8): eye eye eye eye

**ss2811** (8): severely underrated song from this mixtape

**impla77** (7.7): ‚Äòfussy like a pussycat‚Äô-my cat attempts to eat her own sick

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): i love how lowkey whimsical this is - from the production to the vocals - till the end where twigs goes a bit harder

**1998tweety** (7): this would be a bit higher without the speak-sing part

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Just barely misses being the dgaf banger it wants to be. Still a great climax

**horridhendy** (7): This is pretty good. BYEEEEEEEEE

**oscarbrierley1** (7): the spoken part is right on the verge between real and cringy

**qazz23** (7): strong chorus but a bit repetitive

**runaway3212** (7): this is a bit forgetable but like I stan anyway

**bigbigbee** (6.5): (guiltily) haha I do that (listening to this song at a sensitive time convinced me to break it off with someone before I got to this point)

# Why you playing, baby boy what‚Äôs up?

**PrimaryCrusaders** (6.5): Kinda wish it had a 4/4 disco beat instead of a slow R&B trap beat but whatever.

**beeozan** (6): this is weird cuz I really like the part that goes "everybody knows i want ur love" but overall it sounds too lowkey to my liking

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): i feel like ive heard this song 20 times before

**jman457** (10): A really strong piano ballad honestly

**plastichaxan** (10): Kinda the most beautiful song ever like sometimes a girl just wants to cry and make a beautiful ballad because she wants some cock (me)

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): There's a tenderness and intimacy to this track which I can appreciate and the juxtaposition of calling it Hentai is definitely intentional, so I can't fault it fully for that. Unfortunately for me, the actual namedrop takes me out of the track so it's never been a favorite. I realize this is in contrast to most raters, since this now has taken the most 11s seen so far. People were really worried about this song‚Äôs placement, but it never once left Day 3.

# [You know the drill](https://redd.it/135wz9l)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): is rosalia in charge of the anime rate secret bonus

**slimboyfriend** (10): Do the anime openings rate I guess

**throwaway-7650** (10): put me in the anime rate section

**nt96** (9): weeb trash

**flava** (2): promo for anim√© rate I guess, idk if the hosts will appreciate it though

# [Do this rate too](https://redd.it/135wyy9)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Do Anthemic Indie Pop.

# Comments that audibly made me laugh

**Awkward\_King** (10): so fucking unserious

**seanderlust** (9.5): rosalia you know damn well i'm not telling anybody i like this song

# Touch-starved

**1998tweety** (11): my weeb-self had to 11 this song

**cocosairdep** (11): god this makes cry every time‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs such a masterpiece

**horridhendy** (11): This is just my fave. I have heard that if you speak spanish that the lyrics are cringe but I am blissfully ignorant and intend on remaining that way because this was one of my top three songs of last year. There's just something about it that pushes my buttons.

**mabellonghetti74** (11): This decade‚Äôs ‚ÄúVenus as a Boy,‚Äù aka an impossibly tender masterpiece about realizing you‚Äôre in love with someone while they‚Äôre balls-deep inside you.

**akanewasright** (10): need

**Ambrosia42** (10): a stunning, gorgeous, sexual song with incredible production

**auntiegay2** (10): Children were conceived as a result of this track.

**buzzwhyte** (10): SO SO SO SO SO GOOD

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it hurt so much not to 11 this, my full comment on this would be like 5 paragraphs long but just know that this songs themes of just desiring an intimacy that is so perfect in your head that you‚Äôre afraid that reality simply won‚Äôt live up to it is an extremely relatable feeling that sometimes keeps me up at night

**DaHumanTorch** (10): tw: emotional ü•∫

**Frajer** (10): she must have different experiences with hentai than I've had because all of mine were trauamatizing

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I blame Dean Winchester for popularizing it

**JIRACHI** (10): when i had to censor this word on discord that was so embarrassing

**musical\_pyn** (10): my 11 from this album, I love the beautifulness of the music while singing about, well, you know, just so real

**Nagisoid** (10): Rosal√≠a finally answered the age old question, "what if Frank Sinatra was a horny weeb"?

**pig-serpent** (10): Shes a nine, but "rate winner Hentai" is too funny to not give her a bonus point.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Better than most actual hentai

**saviorARMY101** (10): I honestly didn't care for this song when I first heard it but listening to it now I realized how gorgeous it is

**ss2811** (10): her vocal ability is showcased so well on this, will admit that i was very wary of this song before actually hearing it just based on the title!

**UselessTacooo** (10): when the song first came out and I looked for the English translation I did not get the results I wanted

**vexastrae** (10): filming a sex tape in the style of spike lee is so funny to me like imagine cumming while your partner double dollys you across the room

**WaneLietoc** (10): maybe there is an essential crux to this album it is this ditty that if you were to put a mic in my face and ask what is it about, I would reply *extremely bad dj shadow interlude voice* "this ditty is about how rosalia is an ass girl in a tig ol bitty world". this song is about being an outsider who likes to rock on; so naturally it has to have machine gun cornball shit at the end that is...lowkey endearing? I feel she just really has the voice to do this. it took about five listens for me to truly understand "yup she's a real one" for how much she loves to do it and just sing about it really well and with nothing held back. like this is truly a "spanish is the most beautiful language; when you want to say 'i love you' you say 'yo quiero comer culo'" level WOW performance. would get the 11 if not for that absolutely insane twigs mixtape cut

**shipperondeck** (9.4): so so so so so SO sooooooo

**alexismateofan** (9): One of the most beautiful tracks, like it really felt sensual. Thanks Hentai.

**aquariuszns** (9): insane

**beeozan** (9): hentai is brilliant, yes https://youtu.be/zIvnAFNXIYA (not a weird video i promise)

**bogo** (9): wonder how many people looked this song title up without knowing and had to quickly scrub their search history afterwards

**runaway3212** (9): She spiled

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): so we all agree she named it this in order to hide the actual rosalia hentai that's out there right?

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): https://youtu.be/kSVQtlQtxCs?t=155

**TiltControls** (8.5): Honestly I was not expecting a piano ballad going into this track

**-mczrv-** (8): the production on this album is crazy

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): the sound of post-nut clarity

**freeofblasphemy** (8): This album is just doing things right now and I‚Äôm quite into it. I hope it keeps doing things

**indie\_fan\_** (8): tengo que saber cuantos que no saben espa√±ol encantan este cancion pensando que es de algo triste cuando de verdad es referiendo a rosalia queriendo manejar la verga de alguien como moto

**Stryxen** (8): so so so real

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8): gagged me a bit... for sure

**welcome2thejam** (8): I ain't gonna even make a comment, way too easy

**impla77** (7.4): ok whatever works for you girl

**afs** (7): -3 for no hentai

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): It's very memey but I like a comedy ballad which is difficult to get

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the way she sound so gorgeous and emotional and then you read the lyrics üíÄ

**qazz23** (7): some good rapid percussion near the end, otherwise it's a bit slow

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): So much could have gone wrong‚Ä¶ but somehow it kinda works

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): i cannot understand what this song is about but i love how a song called hentai is this beautiful slow ballad

# Gross

**sarcasticsobs** (6.4): I felt very little until the last 45 seconds when those drums come in, saved it for me

**ImADudeDuh** (6): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/000/649/390/922.png

**ReallyCreative** (6): this is not the speed I would choose for a song with this title

**uberpigeon** (6): idk why the fuck this is called hentai

**amr** (2): the gunshot sfx is cool!

**oscarbrierley1** (1): its too jarring for me. the drums coming in is such a jump scare

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): how fitting that this song is called hentai because this gives me the same exact vibes that teenage porn addicted boys who wear ahegao hoodies in public have: slimey, gross, and lacking any taste whatsoever

**cremeebrulee** (10): The most incredible moment of ballot collection was getting our first three non-host scores and watching this soar up to first place. It‚Äôs officially the first song we‚Äôve seen to take the winning spot at some point! Maybe it's a bit goofy to call BIZCOCHITO our third favorite *Motomami* song, but the truth is that this song has a staying power other songs can only wish to have. Whether you've been exposed to it on Tikok, heard the toy phone version, or saw the chewing gum memes, it's earned its place in the top 10, even without any 11s (the highest track to do so). The track is addictive and wonderfully sarcastic, the lyrics are well worth a read if you haven't done that already.

**jman457** (10): I didn‚Äôt realize how short this was because it packs such a punch

**plastichaxan** (10): A song I have performed in drag chewing air gum and all so it has a special meaning on top of the song itself. I‚Äôm so glad it got top 10 after what y‚Äôall did to CHICKEN TERIYAKI (I‚Äôll never forget that)

---

# Roxie sent a ballot with an 11 for this and nothing else

**RoxieLoxie** (11): I can finish two games of solitaire in the time it takes to do this, this isn‚Äôt a drag or a flex but a secret 3rd thing

# Ta-ra-r√°, ta-ra-r√°, ta-t√°

**akanewasright** (10): hearing this song on my roommate‚Äôs IG reel feed was the biggest jumpscare of my life‚Ä¶ like of all songs to blow up, the internet landed on the one that‚Äôs chemically engineered to be obnoxious as hell‚Ä¶

**Awkward\_King** (10): michaela coel:

**beeozan** (10): bopcochito

**bogo** (10): this does not need to be any longer it's the perfect length, a minute and a half of pure energy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): ringtone music GOOD

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): probably one of the most fun songs in this rate

**horridhendy** (10): This song always gets totally stuck in my head in the best way possible.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): she said no hunger, everybody is being fed in this house

**nt96** (10): this is what eating a bowl full of Chupa Chups for dinner sounds like

**oscarbrierley1** (10): so fun, it makes me smile everytime i listen

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (10): I know some spanish, but I don't understand a word of this song. Love it though.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the non toy phone version of this genuinely sounds weird to me now

**seanderlust** (10): "i have hits because i formed the basis" SPEAK ON IT

**shipperondeck** (10): served cunt in a colonizer way or whatever the tweet said

**Stryxen** (10): music to 0ut your hand on your hip, pop it OUT, and pretend to chew gum cuntily to

**sufjancaesar** (10): please don‚Äôt win

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my most played on the album, it's an absolute banger with so much replay value. i just wish it was LONGER i feel like i'm being edged.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://youtu.be/UOuxOd3wGFE

**throwaway-7650** (10): this is the real reason despech√° smashed if you think about it

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): if i ever have to see a gay man imitate her eye-roll thing again it'll be too soon

**uberpigeon** (10): the toy cellphone meme changed my outlook on this album and im not joking

**vexastrae** (10): SHE CHEWEDDDDD

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): makes me shake my bum a lil or maybe a lot

**UselessTacooo** (9.6): biscuit

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9.5): Nokiacore clown music that will persist for ages and generations to come

**CrimsonROSET** (9): idc its camp

**jasannn** (9): stan Chaewon

**Lynflower680** (9): Ever since I saw a TikTok audio with this song and some sorta 2000s toy cellphone noise, I always associate this song with 2000s toys.

**memezaharamole** (9): chews my cud

**qazz23** (9): a bit silly but I like the energy on this short track

**slimboyfriend** (9): robot on a sugar rush

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I just think it's one of the best songs ever

**1998tweety** (8.5): iconic

**aquariuszns** (8.5): LATINAASSSSS

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): chews gum

**JIRACHI** (8.5): this is so cunt but it got annoying over time

**Nagisoid** (8): Do 2022 K-Pop https://files.catbox.moe/7uosft.mp4

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8): This stupid-ass song following the greatness that is Hentai is just üíÄüíÄüíÄ

**ReallyCreative** (8): I could give this song quite literally any score and feel justified idk

**sarcasticsobs** (8): oh thank god

**ss2811** (8): such an iconic song bc of tiktok and her tour, it‚Äôs just so fun!

**welcome2thejam** (8): The refrain's gonna be stuck in my head for days now

**WaneLietoc** (7.9): i rlly respect rosalia for being like "hentai is drawn well this is an aesthetic" and then one song later, trying to make basically a 110 second anime theme. however, this ditty basically has the same gripe that at least 5 cuts on this album suffer from...imo please just make 3 min 10 sec long cuts of this stuff! the sugar rush here sorta just tires me out

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): is her makeup actually inspired by korea??

**saviorARMY101** (7.5): ngl kinda sick of this song for overplaying it but still a bop

# Bizno-chito 

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this is kinda boppy but i can just feel how repeated listens to the instrumental riff will give me a headache

**freeofblasphemy** (6): Kinda feels like this one doesn‚Äôt really take off

**alexismateofan** (4): It‚Äôs not great but it is catchy, and isn‚Äôt that worth something?

**runaway3212** (4): this does very little to me im sorry

**flava** (3): im thankful it's very short but this one feels particularly half formed with it's non-chorus going "da-da-da" but that short runtime saves it from a worse score

**indie\_fan\_** (1): a veces musica que se escucha como que fuera de tom y jerry si funciona. pero este no es un ejemplo ideal

**plastichaxan** (10): A summer bop for the girlies! I was kinda hoping this got its setting on the top 5 idk wtf happened that weekend I was gone but well it got top 10 and a lot of the girls here got it

**jman457** (8.3): This vibes really well on the album, with high energy Mambo beat

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): Despech√° was our first tease into what a *Motomami* deluxe would sound like and it was an immediate crowd-pleaser. If there's two things this track is gonna remind you of, it's either the beach or a Mario Kart track theme. A few people even predicted this to be Rosal√≠a's highest entry in the rate, but it makes its exit before Top 5, where (to answer my cohost's question) it brought down by the extensions we got over the weekend. Rosal√≠a is officially down to one song, but at least she can argue that she won the deluxe-off.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The moment I heard this on the radio the first time I KNEW it was one of the best things she‚Äôs ever done

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): titty emote

**WaneLietoc** (8.5): OMG WE'RE HAVING FUN AT DA BEACH!

**shipperondeck** (8.2): it's a cute bop. a fun bop

**akanewasright** (8): This song has honestly grown off me a lot, but I imagine it‚Äôll be a favorite again by the time summer rolls around

**alexismateofan** (8): Love Rosal√≠a‚Äôs dedication to the alphabet. You better work, diva.

**horridhendy** (8): So much fun. Feels like summer.

**Stryxen** (7.8): twerk‚Ä¶ a little bit

**freeofblasphemy** (7): Look if there‚Äôs authentic laughter captured on the track I‚Äôm gonna give it at least a 7 (source: me)

# Let‚Äôs go get away (from these scores)

**bigbigbee** (6.5): (weeb voice) kokoro no what

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): honestly don‚Äôt get the hype for this one, the production is fun and is the highlight but it just feels one note to me otherwise. Her voice sound extra processed too for some reason and I love it more when her vocals shine.

**frogaranaman** (6): falls flat outside of the clubs tbh

**aquariuszns** (5): eh whatever

**flava** (1): you know it‚Äôs weird, with an album as experimental as Motomami, you‚Äôd probably think I‚Äôd be more partial to a more straightforward cut but this might be my least favourite song in the entire album, I could probably begrudgingly respect the songs above in the ballot (well except for chicken teriyaki), but I find it hard to respect this one, with its chintzy keys reminding me of the worst aspects of going to beach, the sand that gets everywhere, the constant need for sunscreen and I fact I forgot my goggles and the saltwater stings my eyes.

**cremeebrulee** (10): Surprised to see this already? I know I was, since I thought this had an actual shot of winning. This was my original 11 going into the rate, though it's not just because I'm a huge Weeknd fan. I've called *Caprisongs* my favorite twigs project, which makes me feel a little bit of an imposter fan at times. The truth is, that while I enjoy her past material a lot, it's not always the easiest to listen to. The emotions feel too immense, too palpable. In this era, twigs doesn't neglect that intensity at all, but packages it in a way more consumable way. She's made a pop song that feels quintessentially her and I love it so. The track‚Äôs all about the damage a lower can do to you, your body, and your self-worth, but it puts the autonomy back in your hands; it makes you wanna move, not waste away. 

I was so sure this was going to be twigs‚Äô highest placing track, but whether Abel-rating fatigue has hit us or we just preferred the sexier Shygirl collab, this was consistently in the lower top 10. With it gone, twigs and Rosal√≠a are each entering the top 5 with one song apiece, against Tinashe's 3.

**plastichaxan** (10): The superior Weeknd collab? Perhaps. Are both 10s? Yes. Am I surprised this made top 10? Not too much, but like seeing its original reception I‚Äôm glad everyone grew up ~~or maybe I was just reading the wrong people back then, who knows~~

**jman457** (8.4): Wish this was an actual hit for twigs

---

# I want you more, I want you more‚Ä¶

**flava** (11): I was going into this rate with pap11 bones in mind because it is the greatest song of all time, but then I grew some ears and realised it wasn't as perfect as this. An absolutely haunted banger with twigs' pushing her autonomy at the forefront. None of it is particularly healthy but it is her own choice and the fact it is fleeting just makes it all the better

**TragicKingdom1** (11): why did abel eat house down boots on this more than any song in the rate i hosted

**-mczrv-** (10): would have been an eleven but its a three way tie between each artist for first place pt.2

**1998tweety** (10): the bop of the album has arrived

**akanewasright** (10): remembering the time the restaurant I worked at last summer had its computer system randomly shut down throughout the day, and we had to close and un-close the place multiple times before cutting the shift short at like 6 or 7 pm and closing the restaurant for the day. I got yelled at and hung up on by so many customers for just trying to do my job and be like ‚ÄúüòÄ I‚Äôm so sorry, we‚Äôre not open right now‚Äù. Anyway, I put this song on in the car and YELLED this song in maybe my lowest point in years, so it holds a special place in my heart

**Ambrosia42** (10): a smash that is almost hypnotizing, like a mantra or something. I love a good dancey sad song

**beeozan** (10): my hips my thighs my head my shoulders knees and toes knees and toes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): We really should have started a GoFundMe for Bouncin‚Äô, Pt. 3 (feat. The Weeknd) to complete the Abel Rate Trifecta‚Ä¶(and yes I used this comment twice)

**bogo** (10): if this song hadn't come out right as the weeknd was entering his flop era maybe there could've been a 3% chance of this becoming a hit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): surprised this doesn‚Äôt have a Drake co-write. only Twigs and Weeknd could make a good ‚Äú2022 fresh take on Take Care&B‚Äù

**Frajer** (10): go girl let your horny flag fly you deserve it queen

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): Selling out never sounded this good for an alt pop fag girlie

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Abel is so lucky to get featured only on great songs so his average doesn‚Äôt decline

**JIRACHI** (10): a lot of ass shaking instead of tears actually

**memezaharamole** (10): she's a finalist

**oscarbrierley1** (10): i kind of hate to give the big single my highest score for the album, but its truly my favourite.

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (10): Banger.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): there really is no escaping The Weeknd in the rateverse

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Sigh. 11 contenda.

**saviorARMY101** (10): A BANGERRR

**shipperondeck** (10): yeah sorry ive loved this song since it dropped

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i read that people considered this her sell-out song and i can't speak to that bc i'm not rlly a twigs fan but i loved this ANYWAY

**uberpigeon** (10): she's the tear in my club im alive she's the tear in my heart im on fire

**vexastrae** (10): honey! i shrunk the weeknd!

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): damn when will this man take a break

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): deserved to be #1 on billboard

**auntiegay2** (9): Y‚Äôall totally gonna do this bop dirty...

**horridhendy** (9): This is the first song I've really solidly liked on the album but it is really good. After looking it up, it would be the single, I'm so basic.

**impla77** (9): wish Abel was a bit stronger on this track else this would be a 10

**Lynflower680** (9): Another Arca/FKA Twigs collab let‚Äôs gooooooo

**Nagisoid** (9): I would say that Camila Cabello has no tears left to cry but that's insult to both songs involved

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Someone on Last.fm called this "the smash hit that got away" and I think I might have to agree with them

**qazz23** (9): good use of the Arca sample, strong hooks throughout

**seanderlust** (9): appropriate feature for a song with this title because tears in the club is the entire experience of most of the weeknd's discog

**WaneLietoc** (8.9): i love doing da white girl wiggle to this slick, dreamy ditty!

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I have no idea how this song is going to do tbh but I enjoy it

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): this better not be her highest song

**alexismateofan** (8): ‚ÄòAin‚Äôt no crying in the club‚Äô??? False. Only crying in the club.

**Awkward\_King** (8): this collab makes so much sense but also is so funny to me bc like abel is the biggest pop star of the decade and headlined the superbowl and twigs is an alt-r&b artist the gays love who was a backup dancer for jessie j. like those are two different universes

**frogaranaman** (8): who is this Weeknd guy? I only know Abel but he sounds exactly like him

**TiltControls** (8): The new subtitle for Dance Dance Revolution - Legend of Zelda Mix

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Weeknd jumpscare except not as bad as La Fama because he's actually mixed into the track this time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): omg i love the new zelda game

**afs** (7): abel testayawaye

cremeebrulee: # Get those scores out of my hips, my thighs, my hair, my eyes

**CrimsonROSET** (7): abel bringing it down we hate to see it

**ss2811** (7): the weeknd was great for this song in particular and the choreo in the video is just wonderful

**freeofblasphemy** (6.5): This feels like twigs realizing a bit of an unrealized dream of writing a glittery club banger with an A-list guest, and yeah, she does a pretty admirable job at it. But it doesn‚Äôt really feel like her style? Or at least she hasn‚Äôt figured out how to bridge the gap between it and her style

**welcome2thejam** (6): Didn't see the listed artists. Glad to know I can identify the Weekend's voice almost immediately now. Didn't love it but do need to single out the bridge for being excellent

**lexiaredery** (5.5): I'm not a fan of the weeknd in this

**Stryxen** (5): offensively fine as a song but otherwise i dont like how it sounds really muddy

**nt96** (4): The Weeknd got some bops under his belt, but for some reason, his features are a miss for me. I guess its because of his image and how tightly knitted that image is to his music, thrown in the fact that he's one of the biggest stars on the planet and you got something that offers very little in versatility in my opinion. Because of this, his likeness often clashes with others when he's collabing with other artists, and not in a good way. Ultimately distracting.

**runaway3212** (3): this will go too far based on only abel being on it

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (3): i tried to be positive about this one when it came out but i really do not like it. i'm tired of songs about heartbreak/crying in the club/dancefloor. we got it girl we got it

**cremeebrulee** (10): If those "I NEVER DID THAT NO I NEVER DID THAT!" didn't do it for you, I don't know if I could trust you. This song hit #1 at 2 separate occasions, though it couldn't hold that spot for more than one ballot each. Regardless, it is one of the best performing tracks in the whole rate, never once slipping below a #7 placement. I would've loved for this to have won, if only to continue the [Charity Rate entry](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/wzyvx1/charity_rate_iv_reveal_day_3_there_was_a_rate/im5q2i8/) to Rate Winner pipeline, but considering that it's a deep cut against 2 singles from its own album, it was a long shot. At least it improved in every metric since we last rated it, with a higher placement, a higher average, and many more deserved 11s.

**jman457** (10): A great anthemic pop song

**plastichaxan** (10): She reached whatever she was chasing!!

---

# We love you, /u/BeauMeringue

**Awkward\_King** (10): whoever sent this to charity was so real this is the best song of all time like

**TiltControls** (11): To think I could've just helped Bouncin. I blame whoever sent it to charity 4 for making it grow on me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): this is going down the charity rate submission to rate winner pipe line guys trust me im not delusional [citation needed]

**akanewasright** (10): This making top 10 in the last charity rate was like the best thing that happened in that entire rate. Like that basically made everyone realize that we needed to rate this damn album if a deep cut from it was doing all that. But like‚Ä¶ Honestly this isn‚Äôt just some deep cut. It‚Äôs her first time reuniting with chart topping production team Stargate since leaving RCA, and it‚Äôs exactly as splashy as that would imply, even if they made a soaring ballad instead of a banger like their previous work.

# Runner‚Äôs High
**freeofblasphemy** (11): Was absolutely beside myself the first time I heard this. And really, that feeling hasn‚Äôt let up. Forgot how far into the tracklist this was, but it‚Äôs absolutely enhanced by all the frustration and longing that proceeds it. This is how you do an ‚ÄúI‚Äôm going to be okay without you‚Äù banger for the ages. I love everything about this so much

**oscarbrierley1** (11): killed the vocals, slayed the chorus, anthemic vibes. stargate put their whole stargussy into the beat.

**saviorARMY101** (11): Everything about this song is incredible, the vocals, the lyrics, the production, and that guitar in that last chorus! Everything about it is just chef's kiss

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I did this months rate in a state of extremely relationship volatility (which resolved positively btw) and this spoke to me way to much and also made me cry in my office while listening to it

**1998tweety** (10): ascending

**beeozan** (10): i was close to snoozing off but this bop refilled me with vigor

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I‚Äôm not gonna chase anything‚Ä¶because I‚Äôm lazy.

**bogo** (10): long time no see now here's another 10

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): best power ballad ever!!!!!!

**flava** (10): why have people been hyping up bouncin when The Chase is literally right there

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): The texture of her vocal performance and the infectious hooks wheew!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): ok, she need to make a full album of this sound

**ImADudeDuh** (10): drag those little british smart bitches

**JIRACHI** (10): NO I NEVER DID THAT NO I NEVER DID THAT NO I NEVER DID THAT NO I NEVER WILL

**qazz23** (10): really powerful chorus, love when her voice goes high

**ReallyCreative** (10): the way this one song eats some girlies‚Äô entire discographies alive‚Ä¶ oh I would be so mad if I were a mediocre pop girly kept afloat by inane social media antics

**runaway3212** (10): She slayed more than humanly possibly before, she literally raised the slaying bar

**seanderlust** (10): the guitar solo...i am truly levitating

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the "never came back" part is literal crack to me this song is so catchy

**throwaway-7650** (10): best kpop song of all time

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): this 11 material... has no chance of winning though i fear

**uberpigeon** (10): she did do that

**UselessTacooo** (10): Literally soty 2021

**Ambrosia42** (9.8): This song didn‚Äôt quite hit until I saw it live, and now I think it is incredible. She realizes her own self-worth, and she realizes chasing after lovers and fighting for broken relationships isn‚Äôt worth it. It‚Äôs a great lead into Pasadena. The way she sings ‚ÄúI can replace your body‚Äù is so stunning to me, and it ties back into this theme of (virtual) reality and physical presence. She can easily find someone else to touch her and love her and satisfy her physical needs.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Final Fantasy 7 - The Chase interlude I beg (this will not happen as none of the hosts are gamers)

**afs** (9): yasss chase the rate win

**Nagisoid** (9): I agree, we should rate that Aaliyah album

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): Feeling similar feelings to my comments about "Undo". Doesn't feel too "Fresh" but I don't care, another good score for Tinashe, I cannot be stopped. Also I liked the drums

**jasannn** (8.5): she really sounds like Rihanna here

**horridhendy** (8): Continuining a good run. Like this track.

**ss2811** (8): another great song lyrics on point

**shipperondeck** (7.2): idk why this one has always been a bit sleepy to me

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what‚Äôs she chasing

**Lynflower680** (7): I can‚Äôt explain it but the vibes remind of the vacation I went on in 2018 so I like it.

# Chased this out of the top 4

**alexismateofan** (6): This just lightly taps my face, doesn‚Äôt really slap unfortunately.

**WaneLietoc** (6): this one sounds a lil' too sirius xmu ready! pretty sure this is a 7" single that accidentally got released on domino or transgressive in 2k18

**nt96** (5): I feel like people really just slap a fat, reverberated beat and call it a day and people still mindlessly eat up cuz ‚Äúomg it sounds like 80s‚Äù. It‚Äôs a bit meh for me.

**pig-serpent** (4): I know this song is popular so I'm under the impression all my mid Tinashe scores are making day 3 and all my high scores are going out day 2.

**cremeebrulee** (10): It feels cruel to end twigs' album rate winning streak, but the truth is I never saw a timeline where *Caprisongs* could pull off the win against these two other projects. Which explains how crazy it was when papi bones was winning for a solid amount of time mid-ballot collection and then holding second place pretty stably after. I was so excited; I didn't think an album cut could pull it off, but I guess the rater base has turned around on Shygirl (just in time for the Alt Club rate next month yass) A few low scores eventually pushed it down to fourth, but when I tell you it was close... 

papi bones being twigs' highest placing track makes sense when you consider it's the funnest, most light-hearted song she's put out‚Äî a dedication to the activity she finds the most joy in. There's nothing better than seeing her shine so bright in this song, after a lot of the misery and heartache she's been through.

**jman457** (10): This was really good and catchy, twigs at her best poptism.

**plastichaxan** (10): When this won for like one or two ballots? I screamed I cried I threw up I kinda was like fuck Rosal√≠a for a slight second that‚Äôs how powerful it is

**akanewasright** (8.5): p4k was WRONG for what they said about this one

**moonshxne** (8.2): undeniably a bop, but i still have no idea who she is or

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): it starts off meh but I love how it builds into quite the bop

**horridhendy** (8): This is fun. It's kinda all over the place in a way that works.

## Y‚Äôall are bones

**Nagisoid** (7): Would a CupcakKe remix of this even change any of the lyrics?

**pig-serpent** (7): It would be really funny but also say something about our society if this scores higher than every Motomami song.

**alexismateofan** (3): If the two men weren‚Äôt on it, this might have gotten a ten or even eleven but no, men who don‚Äôt add anything to this song have to come up and fuck everything up.

**plastichaxan** (9.265): I will always stand by the tracklisting of this even if I would‚Äôve liked to rate christi interlude. Picking what could get rated or not is kinda hard so idk I won‚Äôt overthink anything. Anyway this was one of my favorite albums last year and I‚Äôm so glad y‚Äôall see the vision cause it‚Äôs reception even among people I knew loved her wasn‚Äôt the best and like ??? I always loved it, voice notes and all

**cremeebrulee** (8.588): I could talk forever about why I love this project ([and I have](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/10971ws/rpopheads_aoty_2022_10_fka_twigs_caprisongs/)), but it's truly just a beautiful project born out of love and hope. I don't know why I feel imposter syndrome as a twigs fan for calling this my favorite project of hers, but it's true. She manages to tug at all my heartstrings while also making this exciting and easy to listen to. Plus as a fellow astrology girlie, my Capricorn stellium relates to this project more than I would like to. I would've loved for this to have pull off a surprise win, but considering her competition, it's great to see her put up the fight that she did.

**buddhacharm** (9.206): This was straight up my 2022 AOTY idgaf! I don't care if it looks like I'm inflating this album's average, it truly wasn't intentional at all. I think every song on CAPRISONGS is fully-formed, immaculately produced, incredibly eclectic, and wholly intentional. Few albums last year (barring RENAISSANCE and Natural Brown Prom Queen) felt as diverse and multifaceted as this album to me. I'm just happy we finally got an album from her that was significantly less intense and brooding and something that's for the girlies, the gays, and everyone else in between! This album soundtracked all of my relationships last year for better or worse and I think it'll always have a special place in my heart

**sarcasticsobs** (9.165): This hits my Q-zone in ways you cannot imagine

**WaneLietoc** (9.088): While I had long admired FKA twigs capacity for perfection and finesse, I had really just long wanted a big zippy album that blossomed with love more that reserved sensuality. and hey wow! caprisongs did that. but also...it decided to play with twigs' idea of perfection by pivoting towards a mixtape. and released right at the tail end of the real first era of the covid-19 pandemic, its promise of a mixtape for "you [me]" actually worked. the playfulness of the mixtape allowed for an imperfection--the who is twigs and how does she interact in the club world?--that had been missing from her work. nothing here may be as striking as two weeks or water me or mary magdalene (or that era's videos) but what was traded in that for this easy hook "lemme bop for da tik tok" sound paid off substantially. easily one of the best of the decade so far. empathetic and inviting! now if only she didn't have to make that bloody kingsmen ditty...ah pop celebs will have to make some calls for their career I'm afraid.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.894): I've always felt like twig's works have been a bit hit or miss for me, but this album is both the most pop focused and my favourite of hers... and I do not think that is a coincedence

**IIIHenryIII** (8.588): I‚Äôve been meaning to listen to this album since it came out, and now I‚Äôm so glad I did. It‚Äôs so damn good. I‚Äôm obsessed with some of these tracks, I mean, papi bones, meta angel‚Ä¶ they are some of the best songs I‚Äôve ever heard. I was not a big fan of Magdalene (cellophane has always been that bitch though), but now I‚Äôm willing to give it another try.

**DirtyRat583** (8.518): londoner spotted

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.500): justice for christi interlude. also justice for Yung Lean ft. FKA Twigs - Bliss :(

**akanewasright** (8.324): I‚Äôm shocked by how much this grew on me lmao. Like when this dropped I pretty much thought it was ‚Äúpretty decent‚Äù and only listened to tears in the club much‚Ä¶ but honestly, you find more and more to love with each listen. Twigs allowing herself to have fun was SUCH a good choice and makes this album one I can put on at any time instead of one I have to prepare myself for emotionally ala Magdalene.

**nt96** (8.024): LP1 and M3LL155X are untouchable and I don‚Äôt expect her to surpass those any time soon. With that being said, it feels nice to see her branch into more upbeat territory especially after all the drama she went through in the past few years. Overall, Caprisongs feels like she‚Äôs enjoying some fun in the sun, and she deserves it.

**moonshxne** (7.959): "this is like elevator music, but you're going to the fiftieth floor." i'm relieved there's finally a really good mixtape for my sun sign (truly impressed by how organic and spontaneous and lived-in these songs are), feel like it shouldve existed a long time ago

**alexismateofan** (7.941): This was probably where I wondered if I should keep doing the rate because I wasn‚Äôt really vibing with most of the songs on this album. Yeah, there were a few good ones, but there were a number of them that just didn‚Äôt hit anything, but I‚Äôm glad some started to hit because near the end were all my favorites and I had a wonderful time listening to them, which is what I look for most when doing a rate.

**saviorARMY101** (7.941): This is the first FKA Twigs album that I've listened to, and considering that I wasn't very familiar with her other work I didn't know what to expect but I was pleasantly surprised. I think this is a pretty solid record with great production, lots of versatility, and plenty of bops. Overall I enjoyed it!

**flava** (7.882): this is a weird album/mixtape because quite frankly it is my favourite project from FKA Twigs. It feels lightweight with a summery breeze to it that makes perfect for warmer weather but it was released in January of all months. It‚Äôs still experimental in a lot of ways but it‚Äôs also trying to get some more mainstream attention. And that mix between accessibility and experimental just does it for me. But this album is a bit deeper than that, taking a route of self-healing and self-love that in a very specific way doesn‚Äôt even bother referring to what FKA twigs has been through in recent years. Which makes the album‚Äôs commitment to the journey of self-healing a lot more compelling, I‚Äôm sure it is possible to fill in the pieces, but I feel like doing that misses the entire point of letting it all go of it all, good shit

**shipperondeck** (7.676): this album got me through a lot [2]

**JIRACHI** (7.647): this is the first twigs' project i've ever listened to in full and i loved it a lot actually!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.471): I could kinda careless about Cellophane tbh (sorry) so I am SO glad this album appeals to my tastes a lot more! It‚Äôs so crazy and inventive and pretty!

**afs** (7.441): fka taking a left turn here was unexpected but appreciated! she surprisingly fits in this sound pretty well, while retaining her mark. however, i dont really feel the highs i get in the other 2 albums, which bring it down a bit, but i think this still does really well since im quite sure it will end up as my highest album avg!

**oscarbrierley1** (7.353): i really dislike the spoken parts throughout, i just want the song to start. a few of the songs kind of blend together for me.

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.353): this one took me a long time to get into but when it hit it hit. a quintessential london album and just so much fun. is it better than her first two? no, not to me at least, but it's got a special place in my heart. and every indie darling needs a controversially mainstream album

**qazz23** (7.088): good vocals and features, but a bit uneven as it drags in the middle; Tears In The Club and Papi Bones are the standouts

**Nagisoid** (7.059): Sadly my least favorite twigs album. I get that it's supposed to be more of a casual and fun collection of songs for her fans but it doesn't grab me the way LP1 or MAGDALENE does. Don't get me wrong though there's some gems on here but I don't tend to enjoy albums with tons of features generally (this is what stops me from liking Pop 2 more but I love it either way). It's good, just not on the level of her other material and she seems out of place in some of these tracks. The interludes get a bit cringy and uncomfortable at times so I'm glad we're not rating them at least.

**dream\_fighter2018** (7.000): I like this better than Magdalene

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.941): 6.67 not including the extra twigs songs in the average (that would make it 6.94 for anyone interested lol.) there are some great highlights in this album, but too much of it blends together for me. i think the first half is substantially stronger

**pig-serpent** (6.912): Very mixed feelings on this one. It's good, but it's also kinda bland except for when the sound design is amazing, and it's forgettable except for when it's catchy. On paper I should like 333 more but I think I agree with my averages that this is the more engaging of the two by a good bit.

=====

cremeebrulee: **freeofblasphemy** (6.735): Cool to see twigs cutting a bit looser but I don‚Äôt get the same sense of authorship as on her albums/EPs

**horridhendy** (6.735): The difficult thing with this is it feels all over the place and kinda messy but then it's a mixtape not an album so it's more forgivable. But this is just not really quite my taste tbh but I do sort of like it. It's certainly not boring. I've really tried to get into this because I can sense that it's quality. The problem becomes - how many times do I have to listen to this mixtape until it really clicks? I feel like if I played this another few times then my scores would be higher but I've played it three times through so that's where we are.

**bigbigbee** (6.706): I like the second half of the album more than the first!

**slimboyfriend** (5.647): why do I enjoy the interludes more than the actual songs

**cremeebrulee** (10): If I weren't hosting, I definitely would‚Äôve been right there with Undo hive, rallying for this to pull off a surprise win. Tinashe treads a lot of new, exciting ground on *333*, but Undo feels like a familiar lover, blending the sounds of "Save Room for Us" and "Perfect Crime", which co-credit Wax Motif also produced. His production is absolutely stellar here as well, a flawless complement to Tinashe's emotional delivery. I've heard arguments that it's a basic synthpop number and that Tinashe can do more interesting stuff than this, but isn't that the magic of versatility? Being able to experiment with new sounds and also deliver pop perfection in the same album? It's part of the reason why I find it so fulfilling to be a Tinashe fan.

On any other album, this song would be an obvious frontrunner and maybe winner. Unluckily here, it never made it past 3rd place. It's eventual landing here is even more precarious when you considered that it was only 0.1 points off from swapping with papi bones. It says more about the massive gap in points this had from our top two then it says anything about the quality of this song. After all, it has a huge base of supporters who got it this high in the first place.

**jman457** (10): Grovy little pop track, sorry im a sucker for a good synth

**plastichaxan** (9): This is just extremely easy to call pop perfection but the more I listen to it a little (very little) wears off I don‚Äôt know how to describe it. Also I‚Äôm kinda bitter this was 0.1 points above papi bones but I have principles

# :who:

**bogo** (10): did she outsell bjork? discuss.

**cocosairdep** (10): gagged Bj√∂rk a bit ngl

# Glad this got resolved

**amr** (8.8): still think this has no business being on the album but august 2021 me would've 0d this so let's cheer

**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): amr look away!

# Knows the way to Tinashe‚Äôs heart

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): I love absolutely everything about this song, even and ESPECIALLY its terrible music video.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this rate is basically just a test to see if I can find anything better than this song

**JIRACHI** (11): gave this a 11 because i need him back to my heart üòî

**ReallyCreative** (11): this song could be 20 minutes longer and still be an 11 let‚Äôs not kid ourselves

**uberpigeon** (11): undoodooheads rise up

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Great new entry in the "Obvious Popheads Rate Winners" genre

**welcome2thejam** (11): What a megabop. KICKass driving beat, killer melody, even the music video looks good with this playing on top of it

**1998tweety** (10): the mega bop has arrived

**Ambrosia42** (10): This song comes after a breakup, and the character of the song is still caught up in this idealized relationship she was in. ‚ÄúHate to think we‚Äôll never know‚Äù kind of drives this idea home that she is imagining an amazing relationship (throwing it back to ‚ÄúI can see the future, and it looks like paradise‚Äù), but she ALREADY HAD this relationship and it WASN‚ÄôT all that great. She is stuck on these heavenly moments rather than the reality of the situation, and caught up in ‚Äúwhat ifs‚Äù and imagined futures instead of the facts. Her vocals combined with the production make this one of those songs that makes you wanna scream and cry and dance at the same time. I think it‚Äôs a really powerful track that she was smart to stick in the middle of the album like she did. I also enjoy the way she says ‚Äúfind you way right back to my heart,‚Äù as if this happy place is a literal place they could visit rather than something imaginary or simulated.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): would you rather have frontline but no slay or frontline but slay

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): best power ballad ever!!!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song reminds me of save room for us (extremely complimentary)

**jackisboredtoday** (10): idk who tf wax motif is but maybe he should be put in charge of the music industry if he can make more songs like this

**Nagisoid** (10): EE ER why are you on the floor

**oscarbrierley1** (10): hypothetical pop hit of the album, it just goes so hard. shame it only got an animated music video.

**pig-serpent** (10): I love the contrast between the heavenly piano and the bouncy synthwave beat.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (10): Yeah this one is a banger. This is an actual smash hit. Fuckin love this one.

**qazz23** (10): really catchy dance pop, one of the best from the album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): FUN FACT: When you add SZA's first album and third EP to the same playlist on spotify, it automatically renames to this!

**runaway3212** (10): she did not have to gag me so hard

**saviorARMY101** (10): A BANGER!

**seanderlust** (10): that drop into the chorus is honestly one of the most sexy moments in music of 2021

**Stryxen** (10): It's something I saw in a vision where I met God and asked her to show me the essence of cunty and I then woke up dazed but knew the answer would be forever immortalised as Tinashe - Undo now available on all streaming services

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): something something synth

**throwaway-7650** (10): poppy after inputting flava's ballot:

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (10): most pleasing to me. the bridge to final chorus transition sends shivers down my spine every time

**UselessTacooo** (10): MV moment

**WaneLietoc** (10): lol they literally made a video that pretended to be a quarter 2 2k3 starcraft spin-off that you'd see an ad for on G4's cinematech trailer show as a kid, and then find out years later "it was in development hell and quietly cancelled in 2k6". one person doing this rate KNOWS EXACTLY what im talking about and I salute it

**flava** (9.5): bassy wobble makes my brain go dumb

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): banger
**sarcasticsobs** (9.3): I don't know, this feels like a vibe I've heard 100 times before by now, but, yet, I don't care. Maybe I'm just being nice because I love her voice and because my head involuntarily started boppin'. Doesn't matter, a 9+ bestowed upon this tune

**afs** (9): no nonono keep doing this queen

**akanewasright** (9): will never forgive her for this shitty ass video

**alexismateofan** (9): If you were to look up ‚Äòmusic that makes you want to writhe on the bed in the middle of the day‚Äô, this would come up.

**freeofblasphemy** (9): Why would anyone listen to Taylor Swift when this exists

**horridhendy** (9): This is the first song on the album that I can say I love. Total whiplash in terms of quality from the previous song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i try to resist it but i just cant fight that 80‚Äôs synth goodness!!!

**TiltControls** (9): It's grown off me a little compared to other songs on the album, but it's still a powerhouse of a track

**musical\_pyn** (8): wait, a popheads user who likes the basic electropop song? you've got to be joking

**nt96** (8): play Undo by Bjork for EE ER promo!

**ss2811** (8): standout track

**vexastrae** (8): tinashe accidentally bought a plot in decentraland and said "fuck it ill film the music video here"

# Undo These Scores

**shipperondeck** (7.5): good song but i kinda overplayed it and now im so tired of it. it's a bit "standard" for this album too so i got tired of it easier. also the mv. yeah

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (7): The features on this album all look like they were created through a random generator. Like these can't all be real musicians.

**Awkward\_King** (5): pop music!! idk i kinda prefer r&bnashe

There was even a period of 3 ballots where this & Saoko were tied and my co-hosts and I thought we should close the rate right then. During the last weekend of ballot collection, those two tracks had swapped positions four (!) times because of how small the point difference was. It was only near the tail end of extensions did the 11s for Saoko started rolling in, and this settled into a comfortable second place.

When I took on co-hosting this rate, one of the things I had hoped for was a solo rate win for Tinashe. She's one of my favorite artists ever, and her work is criminally under-noticed by the general public. This sub, at least, ensures that she gets her flowers; it's why this track was hailed preemptively as a winner. Many bring up its music video, a testament to her work ethic and talent as a dancer. Though sometimes I think the MV outshines the song far too much. Bouncin' is aptly named and it's just a effortless, sexy track that just encapsulates her artistry so much. (The line "I been sending dirty pics / hope they make it to the cloud" is probably the most Tinashe sentence ever). I'm just a tad heartbroken that a 333 album rate win isn't happening, but Bouncin did put up a great fight and got a well-deserved 9.000+ average in return. Best believe she‚Äôs gonna put up some big competition this coming all stars. <3

**plastichaxan** (10): Modern classic! Inspired the entire music industry as she has always done and while it was winning for the most time I‚Äôm kinda glad it didn‚Äôt for other reasons. I have to say those 3 ballots where this and Saoko were tied were kinda the best results ever

**jman457** (6): The bouncin motif got a little old, but I liked her voice otherwise.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): i'd like to think this is an easy win but everytime i do a rate bad taste prevails so here's me hoping u pick the correct option

**WaneLietoc** (9.2): big booty bouncin? tig ol bitty bouncin? its more the former and tragically, not as big booty as Cardi B's seminal cut "she bad". however, the choreography is a delight (she gives ava max energy at one point even though she's really not) and the "I been sendin' dirty pics; Hope they make it to the cloud (Uh, oh-oh)" lyric is a STAR

cremeebrulee: # Everyone else

**Ambrosia42** (11): a unique sound, catchy, lovely vocals, stellar production‚Ä¶everything about it is just perfect. She is finally having her moment with a lover and having a fabulous time. She hints at the themes of the album with ‚ÄúI been sendin dirty pics, hope they make it to the cloud‚Äù which adds this layer of technology to the natural sexuality of the song. I also love the line ‚Äúcancelled all my plans, all the side chicks‚Äù which is pretty blatantly queer

**impla77** (11): nothing more to say.. a megabop

**jasannn** (11): GOT THAT MAGIC TOUCH YOU CAN CALL ME MIDAS

**qazz23** (11): certainly lives up to its title; love those background beats, synths, and vocals - it's my favorite off the album

**-mczrv-** (10): would have been an eleven but its a three way tie between each artist for first place

**babadork** (10): If 11‚Äôs were awarded based on having the best music video, nothing else would have a chance.

**bogo** (10): it's probably a bit cliche to say it but man i wish i could give out two 11s here

**cocosairdep** (10): BOP

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is what i think i look like on zumba

**IIIHenryIII** (10): to the top

**JIRACHI** (10): MOTHER

**mabellonghetti74** (10): Poppers-as-pop song. Airy, effortless, transcendent. The Daughter of Aaliyah JUMPED out.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): such a grower and an earworm. the video is iconic, it made me want to take up trampolining.

**ReallyCreative** (10): the moment

**runaway3212** (10): a bop to jop to

**saviorARMY101** (10): BOPPPP

**seanderlust** (10): that pitched-down vocal line on the chorus has a permanent residence on my frontal lobe

**shipperondeck** (10): the mv is an 11

**throwaway-7650** (10): [KOREAN] DALLY DALLY [KOREAN] DALLY DALLY

**TiltControls** (10): This could've just been an easy 11 for me, but no - I had to let the other songs grow on me

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This is the kind of music that plays in the most sweetest softest dreams you could ever have

**1998tweety** (9.5): the bop has arrived

**aquariuszns** (9.5): BOP... real music

**Frajer** (9.5): I don't think this is what tigger meant


**afs** (9): eclectic artpop moment!!!

**alexismateofan** (9): If I could, I‚Äôd be bouncing on the ground rn. I‚Äôm stuck there though can someone call life alert.

**DirtyRat583** (9): i get the bounc11n hype but im sorry its too unintentionally wacky i cant

**ss2811** (9): magnificent.

**freeofblasphemy** (8.5): Really great thing about Tinashe is she knows how to time her songs just right, even ending them not when you want them to, but when they should. Like, this could totally have kept going for another minute or so and thrown on some embellishments to better justify it. But nope, she decides right before the three-minute mark is the right time for this bop to end. And I fully salute her for it

**uberpigeon** (8.5): girl u dont want your dirty pics on the cloud that isnt very secure...

**Lynflower680** (8): WATCH IT BOUNCIN ON THE GROUND

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Love that one bright sound effect/part of the beat. Don't get why I've seen this touted as one of her front-runners (unless I'm making that up, entirely possible)

**lexiaredery** (7.5): Pretty good, but I feel like there's better

**pig-serpent** (6.5): That synth line is a lot of fun and without a doubt the highlight of the song but Tinashe herself is doing nothing for me.

**flava** (3): it‚Äôs taken me a few listens to understand why I just don‚Äôt love this despite it being the fan favourite, and I think I just have to put this song in the same camp as 24k and Shook by Tkay Maidza where although there isn‚Äôt really wrong with it, I‚Äôm just left feeling like the song is too lightweight and hollow in its composition to really bop to

**horridhendy** (2): I don't get the hype for this at all. It's like Babycakes level annoying.

# What song is that.. cause this came out in 2021

**Awkward\_King** (10): its so fascinating how the best song of all time wasnt created until 2022 but then it was, and everyone agreed

**Overall Average**: 7.826 **// Average Controversy:** 1.663

---

**cremeebrulee** (8.860): As much as I love the other two projects here, this was the reason I was so excited to host this rate. I've been a Tinashe fan since *Aquarius* and it seems like with each subsequent release, I grow to love her artistry more and more. *333* with absolutely blew me away with the the breadth of sounds she tackles on and it's difficult to even name my 5 favorite tracks here, there‚Äôs too many options to pick from. I'm so, so glad we didn't let this project go unrated and that it was able to find a home with these other albums a year later. I would've loved to see any of the top 3 songs here pull off a win, but I‚Äôll take highest album average too.

**plastichaxan** (8.475): This is kinda not my favorite album of the 3 (lol) but it‚Äôs still SOOO good, every time I listen to it (or to any of her songs more) I fall more and more in love with Tinashe and what she does. I‚Äôm really glad this was rated and can‚Äôt wait for Bouncin to win all stars omfg

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.775): where ‚ÄúHopscotch‚Äù

**akanewasright** (9.350): I think I prefer songs for you to this, but that‚Äôs solely because the more emotional songs are among my favorites ever. 333 is a refinement of everything that makes Tinashe the artist she is, all blended into a remarkably cohesive package.

**saviorARMY101** (9.225): Tinashe is honestly one of the most talented and innovative artists of this generation, and that's why it pains me to see how overlooked this album is. Tinashe managed to create an incredibly solid and versatile record that served great visuals, bops, and VOCALS, and yet people still slept on it ü•¥ @Popheads y'all better give this album her flowers!

**qazz23** (8.975): good mix of R&B and dance pop, one of my favorite albums of 2021; beautiful vocals, catchy songs, the features are good, and enjoyed the bonus tracks; Favorites: Bouncin, Undo, Unconditional, The Chase

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (8.900): i know it's like a meme but she's so seriously one of the most underrated musicians out there rn. she has the full pop star skillset and consistently makes great, very artful music, but is underrated by both pop fans and musicheads. give her her flowers, this is excellence front to back.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.840): This was my proper introduction to Tinashe and I can't imagine how it could get better than this

**sarcasticsobs** (8.760): I listened to "Aquarias" SO much and then just completely fell of her despite the internet telling me she got even better. This record made me look like Boo Boo The Fool yet AGAIN. This was also the most consistent record out of the three, great stuff.

**WaneLietoc** (8.630): carpenters and plumbers are here rn a lot of shit is happening while I'm out in the garage having my tea time and looking at some zany three eyed fairy critter named "tinashe". anyways this album exists. its fine. good even. but it also just exists. i may never return to it but i had a blast!

**freeofblasphemy** (8.600): Exhilarating, heartbreaking, and overall glorious album which turned me from ‚ÄúOh yeah Tinashe is pretty cool‚Äù to ‚ÄúTinashe is a goddamn auteur‚Äù

**JIRACHI** (8.575): this was my favorite album of 2021 and for good reasons. a true skipless album for me.

**nt96** (8.520): I feel a bit ashamed for not diving into Tinashe‚Äôs music any sooner despite the constant acclaim surrounding her. This is a good start!

**oscarbrierley1** (8.500): I LOVE this album. It was my most played album the year it came out and has been top 3 ever since. i've listened to it so much that coming up with comments was lind of hard because the songs are just a part of my life. its like 2 years ahead of its time, some of the sounds she uses are only now becoming more wide spread.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.100): 8.1 i'm so happy we're rating a tinashe project its been SO LONG. i do love 333, however there were some parts that didn't quite work for me. overall, it's a really strong project and it's great to see tinashe able to experiment with different sounds. can we pls rate Songs For You ASAP

**TiltControls** (8.075): It's a fitting name cause I felt like I was giving out 9+s like candy

**shipperondeck** (7.930): this album got me through a lot [3]

**IIIHenryIII** (7.775): Even though my average doesn‚Äôt mirror what I‚Äôm about to say, this was one of my favorite releases of 2021. I feel like I liked this album a whole lot better back then, but I still love it to bits. She‚Äôs great.

**moonshxne** (7.765): i really, really like this brand of accessible but lovingly-created and intricately-woven r&b! songs that (lesser) critics might call "pedestrian" just hit in the best way. unfortunately, the album does kinda fall off near the end, especially w the lackluster deluxe tracks

**alexismateofan** (7.650): This album had a LOT of my highest highs. One of the few albums where I heard an 11 and knew it from the jump. However, when the lows hit, they HIT and I had a hard time trying not to compare her lows to her highs and being like ‚Äòwhy can‚Äôt you have done this all the time‚Äô. Overall, a fun album to listen to and I‚Äôll be adding it into my mix.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.450): As someone with 0 experience of Tinashe (down to not knowing how to pronounce her name), this album was a very pleasant experience to listen to! The combination of R&B with hyperpoppy touches just makes such a unique sound, and it helps that Tinashe can really SING out this songs to their full extent!

**afs** (7.350): this album has my top 3 fav songs of the rate (bouncin, undo, the chase)! unfortunately there are also several duds that brings this down, but still im happy i listened to this!

**buddhacharm** (7.300): I love Tinashe deeply (I've been parasocial about her for probably a decade at this point, I have a tattoo completely unaffiliated with her that I affectionately named "Tinashe", etc. etc.) but I was initially pretty hesitant about this album? Something about it felt a little too sprawling and experimental but in a superficial sense. I've grown to love this album deeply but I do think that it's structured a little strangely (the more straightforward tracks sort of backload the album). That being said the aesthetic of this album does feel... NFT-core so it conjures up depressing memories of her fleeting NFT-shilling era

**Nagisoid** (7.050): Actually the first Tinashe project I listen to in full. Thought it was pretty neat and maybe my favorite album from this rate despite not knowing much about her. Has variety in spades and Tinashe's voice fits those instrumentals neatly. Not a big fan of the bonus tracks but there are some nice ditties in the bunch. Glad she's out of her NFT era and entered her NMG (numerology) era.

**flava** (5.700): kinda underwhelming tbh, could use some extra punch

**pig-serpent** (5.650): I've heard a lot about Tinashe, but hadn't listened to much of her before this, and she didn't live up to the hype for me. Her music is extremely competently made with good production and singing, but there wasn't much that stood out to me outside of a few cool synth leads.

**horridhendy** (5.575): This album is all over the place in terms of quality. The first 8 tracks are mostly boring, nothing standing out to me at all (at least not in a good way) then it totally pivots and is great for a few tracks before it dwindles into sleepy mediocrity before picking up for the last two songs of the deluxe version. Honestly this album is one of the most inconsistent albums I've ever heard - some of it is great but most of it is so sleepy and boring. Overall, it's my least favourite album in the rate by far.

**jman457** (11): One of the best explosive intro tracks for an album. The Jazz breakdown makes this. Reminds me of I want you to love me from Fetch the Bolt cutters. Not being really familiar with the Tinashe album before this rate I was shocked of how it was pretty much considered the consensus win. So here is my moment to come out as an Out and Proud Bouncin Anti, and I probably would have 0‚Äôd it if I wasn‚Äôt hosting this rate seeing all the confusing love for it on reddit/discord. Even her generic synthpop tracks would have been better. 

**cremeebrulee** (10): I never once counted Saoko out; even when it got disparaged by its loud detractors, I knew it was the only real competition Bouncin' had. The fifth ballot had this song tumbling down to the cusp of Day 1, but with every new set of scores, this song fought its way back to the top. For every low score that it got, it got a few more 10s and 11s thrown its way. By the end of extensions, the winner was no longer a coin-flip; its supporters had finally shown up and Saoko had managed to stack a 9 point lead in a rate where the top two was often less than a point in difference.

And I'm so terribly happy that it did. This was one of my favorite tracks of 2022, a song that is just chaotically incomparable to anything I've heard. I remember the awe I experienced listening to this for the first time, wondering where else this song could go and what else it could do. It truly felt like I was listening to something out of the future. Anything from our top 5 deserved to take the crown, but it's fitting the most 'eclectic' track got it in the end ~~(Maybe I made some points with that name)~~ CONGRATS, for the first time, RATE WINNER ROSAL√çA!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): YES!!!! YES!!!!! I have never ever been happier! She finally gets her rate win and it was such a tough journey to get to it but we finally did it, ROSAL√çA rate winner! Can‚Äôt wait for this to go out day 1 in winners 4 but like !!

# SAOKO PAPI SAOOOOOOKO

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (11): Chica, ¬øqu√© dices? Saoko, pap√≠, saoko. Saoko, pap√≠, saoko.

**cocosairdep** (10): CHICA QUE DICESSSSS

**akanewasright** (10): YO ME TRANSFORMO

**DaHumanTorch** (10): MAKEUP DE DRAG QUEEN YO ME TRANSFORMO üï∫üï∫üï∫

**throwaway-7650** (10): SAOKO u/plastichaxan SAOKO

**UselessTacooo** (10): SAOKO PAPIIIIIIIIIIIIII SAOOOOOOKOOOOOU

**afs** (8.5): saoko papi saoko papi saoko papi saoko papi saoko papi saoko papi saoko papi saoko

# Yo Me Transformo

**auntiegay2** (11): As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a Motomami. Proof of concept. Song of the summer. A shape-shifting ode to the pleasures of transformation and the liberating freedom of making your influences your own. And it‚Äôs also the best music video of 2022. C√≥gela y c√≥rtala, y ya !

**beeozan** (11): boppest of them all

**bigmojoshit** (11): i love the sample

**buzzwhyte** (11): she went in the studio, motorbike in hand and bubblegum between her lips, and said "let's make history"

**ignitethephoenix** (11): hardest song of 2022, I absolutely love this

**memezaharamole** (11): strongest start to an album of 2022, the jazz piano interlude into the beat is unimaginable to a mere mind like me, can't imagine being sick of it ever.

**Nagisoid** (11): free jazz neoperreo industrial hip hop nervous music deconstructed club glitch pop coldwave electro-industrial

**nt96** (11): el poder que tiene esto, la inteligencia que tiene esto, la autorizaci√≥n que tiene esto, el acceso que tiene esto, la influencia que tiene esto, el perfil que tiene esto, las implicaciones internacionales que tiene esto

**seanderlust** (11): ABSOLUTELY FUCKING BATSHIT I LOVE THIS SO MUCH

**slimboyfriend** (11): chica que dithhhhhhhhhessssss

**ss2811** (11): this song is genuine perfection and there‚Äôs nothing like it!

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now, i feel like this will win

**Ambrosia42** (10): BOPPPPP very yas and very slay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This has such powerful fourth place energy‚Ä¶

**CrimsonROSET** (10): she put her whole saocu into this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is what black country new road THINK they‚Äôre doing sweetie!!!!!!

**DirtyRat583** (10): cutlery drawer type beat

**frogaranaman** (10): alright fine you win

**horridhendy** (10): It goes off. It's just so damn good. Love the video too.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): girl, what you sayin‚Äô? It doesn‚Äôt matter, my ass understands

**jackisboredtoday** (10): There‚Äôs so much going on here and it probably shouldn‚Äôt all work so well but it just fits perfectly no matter how audacious it goes, really a perfect intro track and tone-setter for this record

**JIRACHI** (10): this is so mother coded

**oscarbrierley1** (10): a real strong start to the album. i dont see anywhere listing it as an influence, but it gives mobb deep shook ones part 2 vibes with the high pitched sound at the start and the distorted piano

**qazz23** (10): love the piano breakdown and the drumming at the end (wish that went on longer)

**sarcasticsobs** (10): First 20 seconds were honestly not bad but certainly not promising, but then that demonic synth kicked in, Jesus Christ. Also very much enjoyed that lil' jazzy bit near the end. 11 contenda

**saviorARMY101** (10): A BANGERRR!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i remember seeing so many people recommend this album and i was like ugh fine and then as soon as this song started i was like wow ok i wasn't lied to for once

**vexastrae** (10): is there a drag queen transformer if so im kinning them immediately

**welcome2thejam** (10): This making Indieheads Ult Bonus is still brainbreaking in a positive way. Just sounds rad as all hell

**TiltControls** (9.5): I'm assuming it'll come down to this vs Bouncin, but really both tracks would earn the win. Rosalia navigates this track's production fantastically and just exhudes charisma here

**-mczrv-** (9.1): not many songs like this!

**aquariuszns** (9): extreme cunt

**Frajer** (9): we stan someone who appreciates drag as an artform

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): A vomit of genres in the best way

**Lynflower680** (9): The only issue is that it‚Äôs pretty short. Other than that, it goes hard. Perfect opener

**Stryxen** (9): the endless constant gaggery

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): how do you say cunt serven in spanish. co√±o servido

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (9): bangs

**uberpigeon** (9): nothing let's eat grandma couldn't do

**WaneLietoc** (8.4): this is a global populist ditty. it is also WAY too damn short

**Awkward\_King** (8): pussy music

**freeofblasphemy** (7.5): So this is the one album here I haven‚Äôt heard in full. But if this track is any indication, it‚Äôs gona be a trip!

# C√≥rtala (the cameras)

**bogo** (7): it's kinda growing off me tbh, it really needs some extra added length or something cause i don't think it's long enough to really make a bombastic impression

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): this song has genuinely shrunk on me every time I've heard it, it feels so unfinished or missing something to me, and whilst I like the jazzy breakdown that's kinda all it has going for it

**alexismateofan** (4): I‚Äôd like this to transform into a better song.

**ReallyCreative** (4): I never got this one I‚Äôm sorry to say

**runaway3212** (3): sorry but her voice sounds so bad here

**flava** (2.5): ok I‚Äôm sorry but what is that ugly sounding sound that runs throughout most of the song just sounds so bad and maybe it would be fine if Rosal√≠a had the flair or charisma to ride it, but she just sounds so thin over it, leaning on vocal effects to contort her voice in ways that may be thematically relevant but sound unpleasant, good vibes are not here

**indie\_fan\_** (2.5): no me gustaba este cancion cando le di la misma calificaci√≥n en r/indieheads y tampoco me gusta ahorita ü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

cremeebrulee: # Motomami

---

**Overall Average**: 7.559 **// Average Controversy:** 1.866

---

**plastichaxan** (10.048): This is kinda my favorite album ever. I can‚Äôt lie! I literally have the MOTOMAMI logo tattooed on my arm. I‚Äôm so glad a song off of it won, it makes me feel validated. I was really suffering for the first half of the rate like y‚Äôall can see the SAOKO graph it was bad for my girl

**cremeebrulee** (8.690): This album has only grown on me over time. At the end of last year, it was an honorable mention for my AOTY list, but I definitely would put this on my top 10 albums of 2022 right now. It took some time for me to appreciate the slower parts of this project, but Rosal√≠a‚Äôs lyricism and delivery can be unmatched at times. I know this got a lot of love on the general sub and I was worried that wouldn't full translate to the rater base, but thankfully it did quite well for itself after a very, very rocky start.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.143): The whiplash I have from song to song where Rosalia will sing about the deepest rumination of her soul on one track and the next track talk about stuntin in some Fendi lmfao. Incredible voice as always, thrilling production and some very cool lyrical moments as well.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.143): One of the best albums ever made. I can't emphasize enough how much I love it. Rosal√≠a could record an album of her fart sounds at this point and I would eat it without even thinking twice. She can do whatever from now on. I'm all here for her after this masterpiece.

**saviorARMY101** (8.857): As a person who didn't care much for Rosalia before, this album turned me into a fan. Everything from the concept, to the visuals, to the versatility felt so refreshing and unlike anything I've seen or heard before. As a Latino person, it was also amazing to be able to hear Latin American musical genres that I was familiar with being intermixed with avant-garde and experimental sounds. Overall, this album is incredible and definitely one of my favorites of this past year!

**cocosairdep** (8.786): Colonizer pop is on another level fr

**beeozan** (8.667): the way this clicked incredibly hard for me today... coming for one of my highest avgs ever I am surprised

**akanewasright** (8.571): man I love rosal√≠a‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs not every day you see someone with such a voice come into the game with such rich musical instincts. There are valid criticisms to be made of her and this album, but I am not the person to make them lmao

**nt96** (8.352): anyone who knows me, knows I love it when albums take a globetrotting approach to their sound and this is no exception. Despite some missteps, Rosalia had a solid vision and did a good job creating an eclectic album with disparate influences.

**horridhendy** (8.310): This album (mostly) fucking slaps - it's my favourite album in the rate by a country mile. I'm so obsessed with its weird vibe. Some songs took several listens to really get into but I dunno it's just so bizarre, cool and interesting that I just have come to really appreciate it. I think just a couple of tracks are weighing this down slightly but this was my third favourite album of last year (after Preacher's Daughter and Renaissance). I relistened to it for this rate and several times, I just thought: DAMN THIS ALBUM IS SO GOOD! It does the balance of bops and ballads so well. If you gave me five 11s then they'd all go to this album honestly.

**DirtyRat583** (8.195): motomami + is an EXCELLENT deluxe name. its different, its simple, its great. shame the tracks arent

**shipperondeck** (8.167): this album got me through a lot

**Too-Much-To-Dream** (7.810): i tend to find it difficult to connect with music that isn't in english, so i've been putting this one off for months and months at this point. it lives up to the hype though, the production is excellent and even my dumb monolingual brain can appreciate her top-tier melodic sensibility and vocal performances on this record

**pig-serpent** (7.762): One of the most consistent albums we've rated. Every song being a short ditty that never really aims to develop itself works for the album overall, but when rating individual songs it was hard for most of them to leave a great impression, even though I was liking what I was hearing. As such, almost every song got a 7 or an 8 from me.

**WaneLietoc** (7.729): I keep thinking, even after about 5 listens through several months and speakers, that Motomami is a fascinating misfire, moonlighting as a transitional album, that quite simply doesn't really want to be a major label pop album. that's what has made this an incredibly frustrating album to rate...like I appreciate the production and the ballsiness of the album's appetite. yet I repeatedly get this feeling this album is incomplete and doesn't really wanna be there. The bizarre touchpoint I kept coming to during listens of Motomami was Bjork's Medulla, an album that dug its heals deep into bjork's own personal history and brought out a capella in lieu of production swagger. Motomami really only does something that parallels that album a handful of times, if at all. still, the album's 35 minutes both trying to push forward Rosalia's production sound while also steeping herself back to the ground: the piano ballads and "street" percussion, more or less could have existed at any point in the past 40+ years. the problem is that Rosalia has not quite figured out how to sequence her songs or timing for this album. there's a version of this album that is 10 songs in 35 minutes and fucking rules. there's a version of this album that is 16 cuts over 50 minutes. instead we have this version that keeps trying to cut it both ways and somehow makes me end up wondering "what if Wire's Pink Flag philosophy actually doesn't translate for reggaeton that I rate highly?". a lot of cuts still basically slap, but even with the bonus edition add ons, I feel like the curation flopped. and yet, I want more rosalia. funny how that works.

**qazz23** (7.643): a good variety of sounds but some of the ballads drag it down, didn't care for the extra tracks aside from Despech√°/Chiri; Favorites: Candy, Saoko, La Combi Versace

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.548): 7.54 the deluxe edition brings down the average slightly however it is still an overall strong project! The production and melodies on this album is fantastic, and there are enough ballads to showcase her vocals.

**sarcasticsobs** (7.400): I just don't "get" big hype around this. Like, ya, her vocals are great, no surprise there. I even followed along with the translations and all that. Enjoyed the bonus tracks. But whatever, I'll be in the corner hanging with "El Mal Querer"

**freeofblasphemy** (7.238): This really goes places, huh? It‚Äôs a bit too messy without being totally unhinged. But I still like what she‚Äôs going for

**moonshxne** (7.162): part of why i'm submitting so late is that i spent so long angsting over how to score this. i wonder if the songs being mostly pretty good but ultimately also fleeting *song fragments* (that, combined with the overall sparseness also feels undercooked at points) makes me kind of (positively?) indifferent about most of this overall. obviously i prefer EMQ but i see why this was more popular lol

**afs** (7.048): veeeery consistently decent, a memorable album through and through. however, i wanted to see her try out wilder sounds more often, because she rocks the braggadocious vibe really well

cremeebrulee: **Nagisoid** (7.000): Supongo que escribir√© esto en espa√±ol como hice con Un Verano sin Ti porque es un √°lbum mayormente en espa√±ol tambi√©n as√≠ que le queda bien, lol. Pues igual que con twigs, es mi √°lbum menos preferido de ella. S√≠, prefiero hasta Los √°ngeles que esto (de hecho, a veces prefiero Los √°ngeles que El mal querer, pero s√© que no es una opini√≥n muy popular). No concuerdo con las cr√≠ticas que le tiran a Rosal√≠a de colonizadora totalmente porque creo que no son genuinas en el fondo, pero este proyecto me hace creer que tienen un argumento, m√°s no uno muy s√≥lido. Los estilos "urbanos" (no me gusta este t√©rmino, pero no puedo pensar en uno mejor justo ahora) s√≠ parecen apropiados hasta cierto punto, ya que ella es de Catalu√±a y toda su familia es de all√≠ si no me equivoco. Chicken Teriyaki por ejemplo me parece hasta una falta de respeto no tanto contra su audiencia pero para el reggaet√≥n. Me encanta la m√∫sica ecl√©ctica y experimental, pero no puedo decir que este √°lbum siempre ejecuta bien sus ideas m√°s art√≠sticas. A veces s√≠ me da la vibra de ser abrasivo y dif√≠cil de escuchar solo porque le dio la gana, y respeto eso pero no siempre sirve para m√≠. Amo a Rosal√≠a; sus otros 2 √°lbumes me encantan y me hicieron interesarme m√°s en la m√∫sica, pero hasta el d√≠a de hoy esto no llega al mismo nivel que esas dos joyas, personalmente. No cuenta con la misma coherencia gracias al concepto de las canciones MOTO y MAMI, y que est√°n separadas porque ella lo quiso as√≠. Mi opini√≥n sobre este √°lbum puede ser resumida en que le di mi 11, pero tambi√©n mi 0. Al fin y al cabo respeto su visi√≥n y trayectoria art√≠stica por donde sea que vaya, solo pienso que para m√≠, era m√°s integrante su fusi√≥n de flamenco con el pop que intentar ser una Arca de dieta, sin shade.

**JIRACHI** (6.929): though being my lowest average out of the three i still thoroughly enjoyed it.

**alexismateofan** (6.857): A difficult album for me to rate, not even because of the language barrier but I just didn‚Äôt know how to feel about these songs for the most part. There‚Äôs a good amount of songs that hit right for me but there were a number that kind of felt like a struggle to get through. I think she has one of the most beautiful voices, and would not be upset were she to come into one of my shuffle sessions.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.667): Well maybe hot take but I‚Äôll take this over Un Verano Sin Ti any day. There‚Äôs a lot more variety in these songs, with very little of that dembow beat that‚Äôs EVERYWHERE. Though I can‚Äôt say that there are as many moments of greatness here as there are on Bad Bunny‚Äôs album. She took a lot of risks but unfortunately some of those risks didn‚Äôt exactly deliver. Bizcochito is a banger though and I will die on that hill

**oscarbrierley1** (6.581): ive only heard snippets of this album on tik tok before so listening to it was an experience to say the least. the back and forth between fast and slow songs is so jarring. not being able to understand the lyrics may have hampered my scores for the slow songs.

**buddhacharm** (6.286): I will never get over her being into room-temperature mayonnaise. SICK! The colonizer "hot sauce in my bag, swag" for real. That being said this album was cute! I feel like it was slightly overrated and never really clicked for me like it did for others, but it's pretty eclectic and enjoyable overall!

**indie\_fan\_** (5.838): la verdad, muchos canciones aqui que me gusta y luego hay otros donde tengo sentimientos encontrados. y luego todavia hay otros canciones que casi no puedo tolerar. si estaba escuchando el mal querer, hubiera tener un promedio alto

**flava** (4.262): I‚Äôm so so so so so so so so so so so so so so sorry Poppy

TiltControls: Amazing job creme, poppy, and jman! Sorry I had to miss today but maybe it's for the best I didn't see The Chase leave

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## Songs

Congratulations to **SAOKO** for the win! Across all songs rated by the sub it places 159th. It sits one place below Madonna's Frozen (which has a 0.003 higher average) and one place above Linkin Park's In the End (which has a 0.001 lower average)

Like sub faves there's only one other 9+ song to talk about. **Bouncin** places 217th across all rated songs. It sits one place below The Beach Boys' God Only Knows (+0.001) and one above Cardi B & Megan Thee Stallion's WAP (-0.001)

**Song Stats**

* Again like our most recent rate, **SAOKO** joins the Loneliest Time on the 11's leaderboard with 23! It ties with Carly, Kate Bush's Running Up That Hill (Winners 2) and Taylor Swift's august in 21st place!

## Artists

All three artists have had album rates (or multiple) before so these averages are coming in with some outside influence.


* 105th: Utada Hikaru / Vampire Weekend (7.765)
* **107th: ROSAL√çA (7.757) [PREV 54th]**
* 108th: Grimes (7.755)

-

* 125th: Maren Morris (7.712)
* **126th: Tinashe (7.711) [PREV 164th]**
* 127th: Wonder Girls (7.705)

-

* 137th: Paula Abdul (7.658)
* **138th: FKA twigs (7.655) [PREV 128th]** / SZA (7.655)
* 140th: Jolin Tsai (7.653)

-

Feature changes:

* Shygirl: 126th -> 87th
* The Weeknd: 156th -> 152nd


**Artist Stats**

Nothing for the main artists, but let's talk about men for a sec

* With his 23rd rate appearance today, The Weeknd takes the uncontested record for most rate appearances now! Previously he was in a 4 way tie at 22 with Ariana Grande, Beyonce, and Charli XCX ~~(though in a few months Beyonce will be back up at the top with him with the Lemonade Rerate)~~ nvm, blame 2016 Beyonce for adding him as a feat. He'll probably have the record for the foreseeable future for now
* Also with his guest appearances bringing his rated song total up to 98, he is now also in an uncontested 7th place for 'most song ratings'! (Previously he was tied with Britney Spears and Lana Del Rey. Currently he is 1 song off from being tied with Lady Gaga in 6th)

## Albums
 
Maybe we could've just called this sub faves pt. 2

Also to note, since the deluxe tracklists were used those songs **are** counted alongside the album stats. The only ones that are not are twig's loose singles.

(Rankings are out of 392)

* 119th: Arca - KiCk i (7.827)
* **120th: Tinashe - 333 (7.826)**
* 121st: Chance the Rapper - Coloring Book (7.823)
* 122nd: Mac Miller - Swimming / The Beatles - The Beatles 20 Greatest Hits (7.820)
* **124th: FKA twigs - CAPRISONGS (7.815)** / Mitski - Be The Cowboy (7.815)
* 126th: Janet Jackson - Control (7.807)

-


* 199th: Hannah Diamond - Reflections / Kero Kero Bonito - Time 'n' Place (7.566)
* **201st: ROSAL√çA - MOTOMAMI (7.559)**
* 202nd: CHVRCHES - Screen Violence (7.558)


-

**Album Stats**

None to talk of, but here's the 11 / 0 split for whoever is curious

333 - 40.9% of 11s, 10.0% of 0s

CAPRISONGS - 18.2% of 11s, 9.1% of 0s

MOTOMAMI - 35.5% of 11s, 20.9% of 0s
