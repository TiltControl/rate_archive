Waking Up In Vegas was voted in from the 2009 Billboard Year-End rate, where it placed at #11 with an average of 8.493. Waking Up In Vegas is one of my absolute favourite Katy songs and I was super happy to see it get so much support in the voting. I gave it my 11 in the 2008 Ultimate rate, and it was definitely a contender in the 2009 rate as well. Katy is remembered for her mammoth Teenage Dream era, but One Of The Boys had its fair share of big hits, with Waking Up In Vegas deservedly peaking in the top 10. Seeing it squeak into Day 3 here is great and absolutely deserved!

---

#SHAKE THE GLITTER!	

**1998tweety** (10): Oh wow another 10. The lyrics aren't super complicated on this song; I think Katy is describing a relationship where you both take risks and it either pays off huge in the end or you lose big time. Again, I really love Katy's loud vocals on this song, It bops hard.

**alwayswords** (10): this song makes me want to makeout with someone in one of those vault money booths so bad

**DaHumanTorch** (10): THATS WHAT YOU GETTT FOR WAKING UP IN VEGASSS...still bops to this day, aged like rosé

**ditacarlita** (10): what the fuck this is song is so underrated in Katy's discography, it is definitely top 3 material and I'm so glad to see it here. Katy's vocals and delivery are incredible on this song, it should have been nominated for a Grammy. The pop rock makes me feel so good, "remember what you told me told me told me" before the final chorus, it has really good remixes and the video is hilarious. Everything about this single is wonderful. Ridiculous that it isn't a mega hit. SO UNDERRATED. THIS IS PEAK KATY! BRING BACK POP ROCK!

**fadedblue09** (10): Pop-rock Katy is best Katy tbh.

**fishingfor8** (10): SHUT UP AND PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS THATS WHAT YOU GET FOR WAKING UP IN VEGAS. This song is unequivocally amazing and the best Katy Perry song

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourite Katy songs although I feel like we have rated this way too much

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/ca4bd979340d46a1ee6ed95ce35a972f/tenor.gif

**kappyko** (10): YASAAASA

**ManofOranges** (10): I kind of miss Katy's old pop-rock music simply because it gave us gems like this (among others).

**skargardin** (10): iconic, I CO NIQUE

**twat\_brained** (10): when Katy performed this at her California Dreams tour I LOVED it. This is just one of those "you-had-to-be-there" songs

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): still the best katy perry song

**yourfacesucksass** (9.2): the under-respected tune from katy

**bandnitos** (9): this always seems to get forgotten in the collective of her singles but its such a banger

**bespectacIed** (9): One of katherine's best songs. Fuck dr luke btw

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.7): Até Que a Sorte Nos Separe 2 (2013, colorized.)

**materialqirl** (8.5): Katy has better songs def lol..

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): I used to not like this at all but now I do like it and it kind of makes me nostalgic for 2009

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): She's so good when there are zero expectations for her

**bulforster** (8.4): I'm pleasantly surprised that of the late 00s stuff here this has held up the best for me.

**dnugs\_** (8.3): amazing but could be better

**Misentro** (8): The verses don't hold up to the chorus, but damn, what a chorus!

**vhqv1997** (8): Katy peaked with this. Not joking, this song was Katy when I most liked her. She was sassy and brassy. Her vocal delivery was full of charm and personality. The simple backing electric guitar and drums added a lot of bite to the song. I don't know how it is but as Katy released more works, she just became even blander. One Of The Boys was her at her most provocative, which was an equally interesting and confusing realization.

**wavingwolves** (8): one of the boys was katy's best era (and it's still her best album) and you can't tell me otherwise

**CarlieScion** (7): the forced belting of early katy perry is way worse than any tumblr avocadis voice ever. change my mind.

**nightjesus** (7): Peak Katy Perry. OOTB and Teenage Dream will forever be albums that define the Millennial generation.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): This song is okay but it does NOT sound like a song that is about Vegas like ma'am this instrumentation and production sounds like waking up in Toledo where is the glam. That said, Katy's voice works well here even if nothing else really does

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): Pop rock Katy? Why didn’t she stick with this style?

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): I miss old Katy Perry

#SHUT UP AND PUT YOUR MONEY WHERE YOUR MOUTH IS

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): my least fave of the One of the Boys singles but the video still holds up SO well

**BlueMetalWave** (7): It's okay but she has better tracks.

**timothy444** (7): Okay song but forgettable and bland.

**anothertown** (6): I saw her at warped tour during this era. she was wearing a leopard print mini dress

**helpimbeing** (6): How many times are we gonna keep dredging this up for rates?

**SFbby** (6): IF I won the jackpot I would put it all into savings instead of blowing it all at Vegas

**runaway3212** (5): Katy's first era was very hit or miss, and this is a definite miss for me.

**vayyiqra** (3): Yeah I've always been lukewarm about Katy, and I don't like pop-rock, and this is boring. I don't think I've ever even heard it before, but it sucks. I feel like this is what passes for edgy music for 12 year olds.

**roxieloxie** (2): i now know what a class ring is but i still dont like the song

Die Young was submitted from the 2012 Ultimate rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 8.845. Hosting the 2012 rate was a treat for me particularly because Warrior is my absolute favourite Kesha albums. Die Young was the one very successful single from the album, peaking at #2, just like where it peaked in the 2012 rate! I'm not surprised that this ended up besting Starships when it came to seeing which song would break the tie, with it being quite a bit less abrasive. This is an iconic bop and as a Kesha stan I'm very glad that it managed to squeak its way into Day 3.

---

#We'll keep dancing till we die

**alwayswords** (11): pop perfection me thinks

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop that was robbed of going #1, too bad those kids had to die....

**bandnitos** (10): this whole album is nothing but classics

**bespectacIed** (10): Why does Dr luke have to be such a good pop machine, this is one of the best songs from the early 2010s golden era of pop.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Giving this the same score as to Starships just felt right, ya know?

**DaHumanTorch** (10): A CLASSIC...i know it did fairly well but it deserved sooo much better. also #freekesha

**helpimbeing** (10): Iconic music theft inception.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): slightly problematic bop!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/9e2b9161ed22ad4cb914fb7d76a181a3/tenor.gif

**rickikardashian** (10): I should have given my 11 to C'mon

**SFbby** (10): This song has a crazy good chorus and it's a damn shame it didn't hit #1

**timothy444** (10): 2012 Kesha was the peak of her music career and all of her singles during this era have been all bops. This is no exception and it's a shame that this song is overlooked after the unfortunate timing of a certain incident. Still, the hook is catchy and addicting to listen to!

**materialqirl** (9.5): was a bop for tween me

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Iconic from start to finish, there are so many little things in the production that make this song so great

**BlueMetalWave** (9): It's a bop.

**CarlieScion** (9): this takes me back to being in high school

**vayyiqra** (9): I love early 2010s electropop with white girls doing that sing-talk thing and I like this song so much I am going to overlook how much I hate the "we are young which means we are young and being young is awesome and young young young" lyrical trope that was everywhere in that genre. Ironically I missed out on having fun or clubbing or having a social life during the time that this kind of pop was big, so I am nostalgic for something that I didn't even experience, but maybe that's why I like it?

**waluigiest** (9): This was wonderful - a good evolution in her sound that was matured but still fun

**nightjesus** (8): Aww this song is my only good memory of Schoolies, which is like a 3 day festival for year 12’s after graduation in Australia. It was the only time I had fun when they played this song with my friends. Other than that my friends ruined it for me and I’m still salty about it tbh.

**yourfacesucksass** (8): y'all let this stall at two, she could've opened with another number one even if it is basic

#Dead

**runaway3212** (8): Kesha is just an amazing singer, the production is not great, but still okay.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): sorry but C'Mon is still the superior single

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): idk why but i always confuse this song and timber with each other and i was disappointed when i realized we weren’t rating timber for this rate

**dnugs\_** (7): good but eh

**twat\_brained** (7): it's okay but admittedly I've never loved this

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): looking up the video I realised that there's a mash up between this and 1Ds live while we're young. It's weird

**vhqv1997** (5): Parodies are always cringey and sometimes highkey offensive but I remember that Key of Awesome parody of this song that had a mash-up of most Kesha hits overlaid on top of each other and it sounded lowkey lit

**fadedblue09** (4.8): The verses were more awful than I remember? And that breakdown is just annoying. (What was going on with 2012 pop, anyway??). I don’t understand how you guys picked C’Mon over this but I’m kinda glad because I would’ve been harsher towards that (see my score on Starships).

**wavingwolves** (4): this is definitely a song from 2012

**gannade** (0): i HATE this sound so much. leave it in 2012 PLEASE

Don't Stop Me Now was submitted from the Classic Greatest Hits rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.386. To be completely honest I don't like Queen very much, I mean they're fine, but just a bit overrated in my personal onion. I didn't participate in the Greatest Classic Hits rate because it didn't really interest me, but I'm happy that Don't Stop Me Now was the song chosen to be submitted from it, as it's one of the few Queen songs I actually don't mind. It's anthemic and poppy and it's hard to not feel the energy eminating from Freddie's vocal performance. Ultimately it falls a bit shorter than some may have expected, but it still made day 3 with a decent showing.

---

#I'm having a ball

**1998tweety** (10): Extremely Iconic. Queen has many 10s but this one feels stronger than the others, it has an infectious energy.

**bespectacIed** (10): SHOULD HAVE WON ITS ORIGINAL RATE.

**bulforster** (10): Best Queen song. Even when I went through a phase of trying to be contrarian by hating on Queen I could never bring myself to dislike it.

**CarlieScion** (10): DONT! STOP! ME! NOW! IM HAVING SUCH A GOOD TIME!

**CritneySpearz** (10): actually the best song Freddie Mercury is involved with, I wish he slammed his eggplant into my mouth

**fadedblue09** (10): Hearing this just further justified my zero for that Harry Styles song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Freddie Mercury is a legend and you guys better respect this!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.giphy.com/media/XKGgPtoA1tgP50tPKp/giphy.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): This and Somebody to Love are probably the Queen songs I find myself coming back to the most. I used to be one of those people on the Bohemian Rhapsody train but over time I've just come to really appreciate this song a lot more. The energy and the happiness that comes with this song can't really be matched by anything else.

**Misentro** (10): The ultimate hype song. The energy is off the charts.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): woooooooooooooooooooh

**poppinmmolly** (10): an 11 contender. This is such a good song.

**rickikardashian** (10): Okay I love this song but like, Bohemian Rhapsody and Mamma Mia deserved to be rated again ^(the Beatles can choke ig)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If you give this song anything less than an 8 I feel sorry that you don’t know what fun is

**timothy444** (10): Timeless

**twat\_brained** (10): icons

**vhqv1997** (10): I always try to sing this song when I go out for karaoke. I never pull it off.

**waluigiest** (10): this was an 11 contender for me in its original rate. It’s electric, it’s well-written, it’s fun, it is bittersweet in its portrayal of 80s queer aesthetics. Fantastic.

**wavingwolves** (9.6): i wish i could always feel like this song makes me feel

**ditacarlita** (9.5): omg this song is so fun

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): finally a song /r/music and /r/popheads can agree is good

**helpimbeing** (9): .

**SFbby** (9): Nothing can stop him now

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): don't stop (caring) 'bout me now

**anothertown** (8.5): would they not call him mr. celsius?

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): I mean it's Queen.

#stream Don't Start Now

**DaHumanTorch** (8): Don't Start Now outsold

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): my homophobic moment of the day is calling this song overrated, because it is, it's just still really good at the same time

**BlueMetalWave** (7): Not into rock.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): The only reason it's only a 7 is that, when I was young, to conclude my English course I had to perform this in front of a fuckton of parents and the anxiety of it is still engrained in my soul. Otherwise, absolute banger.

**dnugs\_** (6.5): i can acknowledge the musical talent of queen i just am not exactly in love with their lyrics and don’t find their stuff catchy

**bandnitos** (6): call me problematic but i really can't get into queen

**worlds-okayest666** (6): ngl, i’m not really a fan of Freddie’s voice...a bit overrated

**materialqirl** (5): i dont like queen sorry

**nightjesus** (4): ONLY BECAUSE MY FIANCEE PLAYS THIS ALL TIME AND SINGS IT REALLY ANNOYINGLY SO HE KILLED IT FOR ME BLAME HIM. MEN RUIN EVERYTHING.

**vayyiqra** (2): yeah I can and I will stop you from getting to day 2 sorry Freddie no disrespect to the dead but I hate this song

**runaway3212** (0): it's annoying, stupid and irritating. I want to develop a time machine just to prevent this song from existing.

GURL, you got a fiancee and you're annoyed with the annoying singing? You 'bout to marry this mans; annoying singing should be one of those quirks that doesn't make you mad.

It's Raining Men was submitted from the One Hit Wonderland rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 8.153. A gay anthem? Absolutely! Everyone on popheads would be sure to appreciate if it were to rain men, and it shows with this song making it to day 3 and, despite ending up at a lower position than it did in the One Hit Wonderland rate, actually improving on its average ever so slightly. I'm not the biggest fan of this song personally but I'm okay with it making it this far.

---

#HALLELUJAH!

**runaway3212** (11): This song officially cancelled umbrellas

**1998tweety** (10): A gay anthem, one of the songs I bopped the most to in this rate when I was younger, it still holds up. The chorus bops so hard and this song gives me so much energy and makes me want to dance.

**anothertown** (10): Honestly this is one of my favorite songs of all time it just slaps so god damn hard. The way the thunder goes off. And their vocals are fucking immaculate. I stan!

**CarlieScion** (10): queens

**helpimbeing** (10): YUP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media.giphy.com/media/jzaZ23z45UxK8/giphy.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): I actually thought that maybe this song might win the one hit wonderland rate simply because popheads is extremely gay and the song has everything you could ask for. So when it got 5th place I couldn't believe it. I trust that those people who made it only get 5th will be dealt with and we can see it maybe get a higher spot but I won't get my hopes up.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): HALLELUJAH!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the OG thirst song

**ReallyCreative** (10): Call me old-fashioned, but I preferred the days when men were integral parts of the water cycle through precipitation.

**rickikardashian** (10): the logistics of raining men sound dangerous in every aspect possible. Who are these men? Were they already on earth? If so, who's throwing them from the sky? Are they even real men and not some alien species? What are their intentions? How intelligent and prepared for human society are they? Are they even landing safely? Will the government have to clean up a bunch of dead men off the street? Will they pay taxes? There's just many unanswered mysteries that I don't think will get ever resolved

**roxieloxie** (10): i would like to see lil nas x do a lip sync battle challenge to this song. Because hes the only one would get the vibe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): straight women and gay men solidarity = this song

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Gay Icons

**wavingwolves** (10): even when i thought i didn't like men i loved this song. it's a song for the PEOPLE

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): The power this has! This impact!

**untutorable** (9.5): hard to relate to as a lesbian but it still slaps

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Honestly, the green screen in the video makes this a 20/10.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): invented the meteorology

**ditacarlita** (9): whoever put this song in the rate I thank you because it is a classic jam.

**skargardin** (9): What a bop

**vhqv1997** (9): This song sounds like it could be used in Cyberpunk 2077 in a gun-blazing sequence but only if the protagonist is female

**waluigiest** (9): invented homosexuality. I’m not exaggerating

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9): the music video for this is such a meme

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): if it were really raining men most of them would die on impact

**materialqirl** (8): its rainin menn

**SFbby** (8): Please let it rain men that can actually respond to messages in a timely manner

**twat\_brained** (8): this may be the most extra song to ever extra and I know some of y'all are gonna hate me but my first exposure to this was from Geri Halliwell's shit cover

**CritneySpearz** (7.5): we love horny menopausal women, thank you for this bop

**bandnitos** (7): how im trying to be

#Rihanna - Umbrella (feat. Jay-Z)

**worlds-okayest666** (8): I kinda like Geri Haliwell’s version better ngl

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): is it bad i like geri harriwell's version better

**BlueMetalWave** (6): The chorus is the best part but the rest is a bit flat.

**dnugs\_** (6): ? a classic but not really a song i find that catchy

**fadedblue09** (5): This is actually messy?

**nightjesus** (5): I want it to be raining donuts tbh.

**vayyiqra** (5): No thanks, I'm not into guys. You go ahead though. (lol @ "get soaking wet" though). [Serious comment: I can't take this fucking song seriously, though I guess I'm not meant to. It's too much of a meme, and it's so goofy and campy and silly, and it's catchy but it's also so dumb. I don't even know what to rate it, so it gets a 5, though I would rather give it a mathematical variable like "x", or "undefined".]

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): have you ever known one of those people who won't listen to music that's been released in like the last ten years because it apparently all sucks now? And then they try to convince everyone at parties that we all should only listen to like 80s or at most 90s music... My roommate was one of those people and this song ended up in our goddamn party Playlist every time. That sounds okay at first but this Playlist got played at least twice a month... I lived with him for 3 years... I don't like this song

**gannade** (4): iconic gay anthem for the lyrics but for the actual song... hmm

What Kind Of Man was submitted from the 2015 Alt Pop rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.226. Poor Florence, she's been stuck in the top 5 of rates but never winning for quite a long time now. It happened with Dog Days Are Over (twice), it happened with Shake It Out very recently, and it happened in the 2015 Alt Pop rate with not just What Kind Of Man but also four other tracks from HBHBHB. Marina really has it out for her, snatching the win out of Florence's hands twice with Oh No and Froot. Unfortunately, What Kind Of Man doesn't get to repeat Florence's success-but-not-actual-wins here in this rate, but #16 ain't bad at all either.

---

#How Beautiful

**1998tweety** (10): The second those guitars crash in is incredible. I adore songs that start off slow but break out into mass hysteria, the super important thing is knowing when to make that switch, and What Kind Of Man accomplishes that perfectly. We get just enough of the slow sad bit, but not enough that it drowns out the rest of the song. For the upbeat rock bit, Florence lends her vocals to that style more than I usually see, and it really adds that extra touch that was needed to fully sell it. The lyrics overlap the instrumentation perfectly (trumpets always will be amazing if used properly, and this song knows exactly what it's doing).

**bandnitos** (10): BROOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**CarlieScion** (10): QUEEN FLOH

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this deserved to win over Froot, which is yet again a conversation ya'll aren't ready for

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Kind of mad how this didn’t win whatever rate this was in

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media.giphy.com/media/3MgLhAYvkqIz2UP5g9/giphy.gif

**Misentro** (10): Florence at her angriest and best. The disorted intro is so cool, you can hear so much emotion in her voice, and the song just explodes from there.

**ReallyCreative** (10): The ANGER this song has, this is pure witchcraft god bless

**SFbby** (10): Florence shreds this rock song and demands an answer from a man who has wronged her

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): The guitar coming in after that slow quite intro is a top 5 Florence+the Machine moment

**twat\_brained** (10): what kind of man would scold Florence like this knowing full well she'd rinse them like this? I'm thanking whoever did because we could a fantastic song out of it.

**vhqv1997** (10): If I knew that somebody wrote a song about me like this, I honestly would just fling myself out of a window onto a row of spikes. I mean, why bother living anymore, this woman just roasted me so hard there's zero point in sticking around to do any more damage to society.

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): WHAT KIND OF FUCKING MAN I LOVE THIS WITCH ASS HO, ENDED MISOGYNISTIC MEN

**materialqirl** (9.5): bop

**fadedblue09** (9.2): Thank goodness for having a decent Florence song in the rate!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): This 9 is solely because of that riff. You know the one.

**ditacarlita** (9): I remember this song coming out and meaning to listen to the album when it came out and I never got around to it. Where did the last 5 years go?! When this song kicks in.... Oof.

**runaway3212** (9): just great

**vayyiqra** (9): :kimbryell:

**waluigiest** (9): the shift with the guitar riff……. She ate it

**wavingwolves** (9): is this what a exorcism sounds like? sign me up for this shit

**gannade** (8.5): snorence snapped again

**yourfacesucksass** (8.2): what kind of man loves at all because i sure haven't seen THEM

**bulforster** (7.6): One of my least favourite songs off HBHBHB (I think the upbeat drums on some of the verses are a bit weird) but still pretty good, especially when she first comes in after the guitars pick up.

#Frooooot, lalalalala

**BlueMetalWave** (7): It's a great song but it doesn't go beyond for me.

**nightjesus** (7): Go off sis.

**helpimbeing** (6.5): Didn't love this song or album but Florence's intense vocals are always a treat.

**ManofOranges** (5.5): This song just sounds... weird to me. I can't really put my finger but it sounds off to me. I've heard better from Florence.

Empire State Of Mind was submitted from the 2009 Billboard Year-End rate, where it placed at #6 with an average of 8.836. This is definitely yet another classic from the 2009 rate. Alicia absolutely steals the show here, with her chorus being ingrained in everyone's memory - even if that is something involving tomatoes and wet dreams. Jay is there too, and he's definitely at least tolerable seeing as this song did well here and has done well in every rate it has been in in the past. A wonderful ode to New York that has Madonna and Taylor shaking.

**vhqv1997** (7): Concrete bungholes where dreams are made up, there's nothing you can do.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Cement forest moist sleep ketchup.

#It's been waiting for you!

**BlueMetalWave** (10): This song is iconic.

**fadedblue09** (10): Tidal won’t be missed.

**fishingfor8** (10): This song is why i like the Yankees better than the Red Sox

**helpimbeing** (10): If you don't give this a 10 you're probably from LA or some other sick shit.

**J\_Toe** (10): so glad this is finally on spotify

**ManofOranges** (10): Never been to New York but if I ever do, this might be the song that I'm thinking while I'm there. I love this song. I love Alicia's part and I feel like everything about this song is just so endearing.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Legendaric, an iconicism

**rickikardashian** (10): when I first rated this, I used the Glee version since it was also perfection, but now that the original version is on Spotify, I can say, the Glee version is kinda better

**materialqirl** (9.5): CONCRETE JUNGLE THIS IS WHAT DREAMS ARE MADE OOFFF

**1998tweety** (9): Iconic

**SFbby** (9): The most recent New York classic song

**waluigiest** (9): my third time rating this in the past year. It’s still so good but now it’s on Spotify!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): has this become the unnofficial anthem of New York? If not, why not?

**roxieloxie** (8.3): bacon pancakes remix outsold

**alwayswords** (8): another song i love just for nostalgic reasons :larrygiggle:

**bandnitos** (8): conk creet

**bespectacIed** (8): I used to put this song in the pedestal but now I'm realizing the verses are kinda patronizing and corny? Undeniably iconic and immortal song though.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/236918780129705985/638566958136033280/dance.gif

**nightjesus** (8): Look, at heart I am all about the West side and LA is my favourite city in the world. But this song really makes me love and appreciate New York City. Even though it’s super crowded and cold. It’s Alicia Keys belting out that chorus. She sings it with such power it makes you wanna raise a lighter and sway it side to side.

**skargardin** (8): boppy

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): now this is what you call an explosive chorus

**timothy444** (8): Don't like Jay-Z but this song is alright.

**vayyiqra** (8): I would've once given this a 10 because it's a great song and a classic, even anthemic, but I don't like it as much now because it reminds me of the cringey Star Wars parody of it (a tautology if there ever were one). I should listen to Alicia Keys more though because her voice is amazing.

**wavingwolves** (8): remember the glee version of this...

#New York is for little pussies who scream

**ditacarlita** (8): minus 2 points because I'm sick of hearing it

**CritneySpearz** (7.5): only good part is Alicia wbk

**dnugs\_** (7.5): i haven’t been able to listen to this song in years it’s amazing but it was overplayed to hell

**twat\_brained** (7.4): loses points since it blocked Bad Romance from #1. yes i'm a petty hoe

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): I'm just gonna say it. I prefer the Glee version

**bulforster** (7): I would probably like this more if I knew or cared more about NYC.

**runaway3212** (7): never really understood the hype about this one, but it's not bad.

**anothertown** (4): New york sucks and Jay-Z had part ownership in the Barclays Center

Untouched was voted in from the 2009 Billboard Year-End rate, where it placed at #24 with an average of 7.826. Untouched has the distinction of getting the "most improved award" in this rate, increasing its average from below 8.0 to above it. Wig! While I do like this song well enough, I've never viewed it as the pop perfection that others do. But clearly there were enough Veronicas stans in the audience to not only vote this song in despite its not-so-great showing in the 2009 rate, but also give it the average above 8.0 it deserves and a spot in the top 20.

#*string intro*

**bandnitos** (11): i remember in eighth grade there was a span of like three months that i was obsessed with this song and i can see why... holy shit this is so good and the chorus is fucking amazing

**Compulsively\_Epic** (11): BBOAT

**kwcty6888** (11): the most hype strings intro of all time

**nightjesus** (11): I SWEAR TO GOD POPHEADS IF YOU LET ME DOWN. THIS IS POP PERFECTION.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): CarlieScion? more like carlie suck my ass!

**untutorable** (11): pop peaked with this song

**1998tweety** (10): oh wow pop perfection

**bespectacIed** (10): My 11 is only between this and Groove is in the Heart and with a heavy heart I'm settling for a 10 for this pop bliss. It's a song that announced that it is one of the greatest pop songs of all time after the first 5 notes of violin. That bit in the bridge where the instrumentation suddenly switched from orchestral/punk guitars to heavy, pulsating synths is in my opinion the greatest moment in music history, it moves me to tears and makes me cream every time.

**BlueMetalWave** (10): I was absolutely floored! It was a new discovery for me and I loved it.

**ditacarlita** (10): I ♥ MySpace, violins and the Veronicas

**helpimbeing** (10): This shit betta be top 10 this time

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/d50b038c472d4b7c15bb37a5f7e17c93/dd5059bd223540c6-ed/s640x960/7cbf7e13e64500a37409ef31650d94d7e58f3913.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): This is definitely a grower

**materialqirl** (10): definitely almost 11

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is one of the most beloved treasures of Australian Culture you little fuckers better not disrespect it again

**ReallyCreative** (10): The title describes everyone who robbed this song again

**rickikardashian** (10): the video for this song is hilarious because the song is like badly edited to make it shorter, and the girls are literally standing still while singing, so it looks like "👁️👄👁️I feel so untouched and I-👁️👄👁️"

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): ya'll better give australians the respect they deserve

**timothy444** (10): The iconic duo of the 2000s do it again with this banger of a bop!

**waluigiest** (10): this was my 11 in the first rate I ever did! I want this to play every time I go out dancing it’s mind numbingly good

**wavingwolves** (10): so i thought for the longest time that the veronicas were a female fronted band like paramore and they had a concept thing where the singer had a twin on music videos. think the kill by 30 seconds to mars. yeah. and i only discovered i was wrong last year.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): “When I go ooh ooh, you go ahh ahh / La la la la la la” is absolute lyrical genius and you cannot change my mind

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): The perfect balance of fun, cheesiness, and emotion... Btw what does "untouched" mean?

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Must say, just belting out that chorus in the shower is an EXPERIENCE.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): my first song by them and it was so good...australia has taste! i'll definitely have to stream their discography when i finish this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (9): The production on this song and the chorus makes up greatly for the poor first verse (still a bop though)

**skargardin** (9): Queens

**twat\_brained** (9): this reminds me, remember that one Phineas and Ferb episode where Candace and Stacy snuck onto the Bettys tour bus? It just came to me the Bettys are an expy of the Veronicas. File that under "things I never noticed as a kid"

**dnugs\_** (8.9): been listening to this song since i was idk in the 5th grade and the strings in the beginning is still one of the toughest openings to a song ever lmao

**vayyiqra** (8): I need to listen to the Veronicas more, because they're like Blondie but edgier and more synthy, and therefore amazing. This is a huge bop.

#Going crazy

**bulforster** (8): The messiness does achieve the desperation they're going for really well, but it's still messy.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): kinda shrinker

**runaway3212** (7): just a very sold song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): Wow this sounds dated af. Kinda slaps tho

**fadedblue09** (4): As much as I stan female pop-rock, this one isn’t working for me? Must be the weak lyrical content or the production not complimenting their voices.

**CarlieScion** (3): jess is still a borderline pedophile (she dated michael from 5sos when he was 16 and she was fucking 27!!!)

**vhqv1997** (3): The instrumentals sound really dark and haunting, and this could have made for a great rock ballad but the cold turkey vocals ruined it. Avril Lavigne would have killed this.

**roxieloxie** (2): im gonna be so honest, maybe im just young but i dont really get what makes yall go feral for this song

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (1): I don't think i ever want to listen to this ever again

Reflection was submitted from the Disney Animated Classics rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.289. In the Disney rate, Mulan absolutely ATE. And it's absolutely what she deserves. A Girl Worth Fighting For can choke, but Reflection and I'll Make A Man Out Of You are two of my absolute favourite Disney songs and were basically my only two 11 contenders, with I'll Make A Man Out Of You getting it in the end. I'm quite happy to see this song do so well in this rate as Disney musical songs definitely aren't for everyone, but this song's universal appeal shows in its placement.

---

#WHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO IS THAT GIRL I SEE

**bandnitos** (10): and im ending this rate in tears that's fitting

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Beautiful ballad.

**CarlieScion** (10): WHOOOOOOOOO IS THIS GIRL I SEE

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Disney really said trans rights, huh?

**DaHumanTorch** (10): trans anthem !! miss mulan was ahead of her time

**helpimbeing** (10): Ended whitewashing.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is probably one of the most beautiful Disney songs of all time, if not THE most beautiful Disney song. It definitely strikes a chord with anyone having a tough time with their identity, and for that reason I've definitely been in a position where I could fall back on this song for comfort.

**ReallyCreative** (10): An event, Ms. Lea SERVED queer rights and my 5 year old gay ass was living

**rickikardashian** (10): if the new Mulan movie doesn't have this song, we riot

**vhqv1997** (10): Do not stan the new Mulan remake that's coming out folks. For one thing, the main actress is boring as hell, she's so stiff and wooden I don't think I saw her change facial expression once in all of the trailers and promo images I saw of her. Secondly, she also doesn't support democracy and Hong Kong. Thirdly, the movie doesn't have any song. I can go on and on but this movie looks like a mess from what I've seen and we're all better off watching the original, which included this heartbreaking ballad that all of us can relate to.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): obligatory bc lea salonga sings this and i’m filipino but also this is genuinely the best disney song

**bulforster** (9.6): I'm pretty sure listening to this song a lot when I was 8 or so helped me realise I was gay.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Ugh iconic af, we love a good ballad.

**runaway3212** (9.5): It's super introspective and at the same time sung so well.

**Compulsively\_Epic** (9): mulan fucked me up

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://media.tenor.com/images/0d4065cb182879cad37c084716ba9c1b/tenor.gif

**materialqirl** (9): mulannnnn MULAN

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): stunning song and best disney film

**waluigiest** (9): will Disney ever make an anthem this good again

**wavingwolves** (8.5): mulan is actually the only of the princesses movies i was allowed to watch as a kid so this is really the one of few disney song i can truly appreciate

**anothertown** (8): I think I underrated this in the disney rate. I viewed it as too simplistic when really its subject matter represented a sea change for Disney’s female solo songs and should be seen as such! :2 guys screaming about Wicked voice:

**bespectacIed** (8): 🇵🇭🇵🇭🇵🇭

#Transphobic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): confession time ive never actually seen mulan

**twat\_brained** (8): Christina outsold

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): Okay so I'm a stan of the Christina one more, but this is also a classic

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): If you have never sung this while dramatically staring out the window on a rainy day you're really missing out

**ditacarlita** (6): where is Christina?

Slow Burn was submitted from the NPR-Core rate, where it placed at #4 with an average of 9.210. The opener to Golden Hour, Slow Burn sets the tone and mood of the record absolutely brilliantly. It absolutely gives the vibes of just lying in the grass in the summer and staring up at the clouds as the sun begins to set. It may not be the groovy pop bop that High Horse is, and thus it's understandable why it is going out before it as it has less universal appeal, but it's definitely a great song and is exemplary of why Golden Hour won AOTY in 2018.

---

#I'm alright with a Slow Burn

**1998tweety** (10): This song is so cute and wholesome, love it.

**bespectacIed** (10): I just feel hopeless and helpless listening to this song, those two depressing moods captured brilliantly by a song. It feels like a dreary afternoon driving on an empty highway

**bulforster** (10): The Slow Burn of building up the perfect arrangement here... her MIND.

**CarlieScion** (10): my favorite from golden hour :comfy:

**DaHumanTorch** (10): when i say yee you say haw...YEE, HAW, YEE HAW, when i say yee you say haw...silence HAW I DIDNT FUCKING SAY YEE

**ditacarlita** (10): the first time I heard this song it was like the first time I ever listened to Jagged Little Pill - intensely moving. Nearly got my 11.

**helpimbeing** (10): A masterpiece.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is so soothing to me. The first song that I really enjoyed of Kacey’s along with High Horse.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/8d928b1033f21851016b870888b4d079/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Slow bop

**Misentro** (10): This song is pure happiness.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this was a possible 11 contender

**ReallyCreative** (10): This song is such a warm summer evening with a light breeze, the sun going down, the lightning bugs starting to come out, it just transports me

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): literally one of the best album openers ever. sets the tone for the album so well and the lyricism is amazing.

**waluigiest** (10): songwriting excellence. I want all five songs from this rate to share first place.

**wavingwolves** (10): one of the things i most hate is when people say they're always late like it's a personality trait so the fact i still gave this song a 10 is proof of how much i love it. kacey, manage your time better, girl

**twat\_brained** (9.6): did I mention I covered this in an artist showcase last year? I can prove it

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): why do I love this country ass binch

**fadedblue09** (8.4): Lovely country song

**dnugs\_** (8.3): kacey a beautiful songwriter but it’s so easy to get sick of her stuff it’s very generic formulaic

**bandnitos** (8): took a break from crying with the last song now we're back

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Rainbow would have gotten my 11 so fucking fast. We really robbed that song.

**rickikardashian** (8): that one line about people heading out to work in Beijing... that's just how timezones work Kacey

**BlueMetalWave** (7): Her voice is great.

#the only kacey song i like is high horse

**J\_Toe** (5): nope

**nightjesus** (5): I usually love Kacey’s songs but this one just didn’t hit me. I don’t know what it is because I love how she wrote it. Ugh I’m super annoyed at myself but I just don’t like the song. I love the song writing tho. So that’s why I rate it 5. Half for the songwriting and we stan artists who have an open mind.

**alwayswords** (4.7): :sleeping:

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): I really tried to like the whole album because everyone I know was praising it but in the end it's just so boring to me. This song especially

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah this song is pretty, but something about it doesn't work for me. I never quite got the love for this album. Maybe I just can't relate to the lyrics at all because I hate the idea of living a small-town, rural, slow kind of lifestyle. Also, it irrationally bugs me how she says the bar closes in an hour but then she wants to look at flowers. I was picturing it being sunset (you know, because she said the sun was setting, and also because the album is called Golden Hour) but I thought bars closed at night? Nobody looks at flowers at night because that makes no sense, so which is it? Make up your mind, girl. Anyway, stream The Golden Echo by Kimbra Johnson!

**vhqv1997** (4): I love a good country ballad, but this song is just boring, man. I heard it the first few times and I quite liked it then, but relistening to it now just made it clear to me what a chore it is to get through this without the context of the album.

**roxieloxie** (3): its slow alright

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): can one of you gays please explain the appeal of kacey musgraves for me bc she sounds like every other country artist and bores me

Lights was submitted from the Alternative Electropop Queens rate, where it placed at #6 with an average of 8.917. An ancient popheads rate meme, Lights unfortunately misses out on #2 by quite a bit here. This is an amazing song in my opinion, and is deserving of being in so many rates... but others are definitely tired of it. I would have had it higher than this, but it's nice to see that this song still has appeal and can easily make day 3 with a decent average.

---

#Can this please win a rate

**vayyiqra** (11): I'm going to give this my 11 because it deserves it, but I also know Popheads, being dumb, will make it lose yet again no matter what I do. But it's the single best song in the rate and a pop classic. It reminds me of my twin brother who has panic attacks and he likes Ellie Goulding (as I do). If only she were still this good.

**agentofscranton** (10): she'll never win but she deserves

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Everyone, stand up for our national anthem.

**ExtraEater** (10): Still a perfect song

**fishingfor8** (10): I will always defend Ellie she makes very good music fight me La Roux

**helpimbeing** (10): I'm really just gonna give a 10 to half the songs in this rate huh

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Ellie honestly peaked with the song. It’s so good in every single way.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/569651722646061058/648324183838949386/ezgif.com-video-to-gif.gif

**J\_Toe** (10): I'm no an Ellie Goulding fan and still don't exactly get her, but whereas I used to think this was a middle of the road song, I can now at least see why people like it

**ManofOranges** (10): I still remember the first time I heard this song was at the local pool my family went to during the summer. I heard it playing over the radio and I knew I had to make a mental note of the song. I tried my best to remember it so I could look it up when I got home because it just enthralled me immediately and I knew I would be disappointed if I forgot it. Thankfully I didn't forget it. I still haven't.

**ReallyCreative** (10): Literally one of the most perfect pop songs ever made, I can imagine it getting robbed since it still feels overplayed but at the same time, this song invented the concept of light and we have to appreciate it

**runaway3212** (10): Immaculate, Ellie Goulding is honestly very underrated and this song shows just everything she is capable of.

**SFbby** (10): Ethereal and dancey in one song

**skargardin** (10): Part of me wants to say "this again...?" but it's no less of a ten either way

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): My mom has a visceral hatred of this song and I never understood why

**1998tweety** (9.5): Mega bop, La Roux can seethe

**twat\_brained** (9.3): it's a great song but wasn't this in the first All-Stars? What's it doing here instead of Lovefool?

**materialqirl** (9): 2010s bop

**timothy444** (9): Let's be real; this song deserved to win the 2012 Billboard rate

#La Roux stans

**RandomHypnotica** (8): i mean this song is OK but pretty overrated on this sub

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): how many times have we rated this fucking song

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): a SHRINKER

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i'm surprised about how well this aged tbh still bops quite a bit

**roxieloxie** (7.3): you know what lemme not drag Ms.Ellie anymore that shes already been

**bandnitos** (7): this song gives me an uneasy nostalgic feeling so idk what memories are attached to this song but like as a song its alright

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i was prepared to shit on this and make a comment like "did la roux lie" cause i used to hate it but it isn't as bad as i remembered i actually kinda bopped to it this time? i guess i used to be tasteless wow, glad my palette developed

**kappyko** (7): How was this allowed

**nightjesus** (7): So back in 2010 Ellie Goulding appeared on an Australian radio show promoting this song and I just remember the male host going super far and creepily saying how pretty and attractive she was. It was super duper creepy. Regardless good lil bop.

**yourfacesucksass** (7): a friend once said she thought the lyrics were "you turn the lights on then you turn them off"

**\_wailordfan** (6): this bitch? again? Come up with something different popheads!

**dnugs\_** (6): hearing it again now it’s boring

**slimboyfriend** (6): My fav song to hear whenever I'm shopping at Kohl's

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): honestly i never understood the popularity of this song

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Generic. Why was this in an alt-pop rate?

**BlueMetalWave** (5): Meh.

**CarlieScion** (5): i REFUSE to give this another fair shot. please. stop. memeing. this. into. rates.

**vhqv1997** (5): I've never been able to really take to Ellie's voice. Sometimes it works, but this time it didn't for me, the song is still good, I just don't find it that interesting.

**alwayswords** (4): something about this song really bothers me maybe bc it was overplayed back when i still used the radio but ellie has much better work :deadbanana:

**Awkward\_King** (3): what la roux said was right she just shouldn't have actually said it

Girls Just Want To Have Fun was submitted from the 80s Dancepop Debuts rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 9.422. Look, I've never been a huge fan of this song, but I have to admit I can see its appeal as a cheesy 80s dance pop bop, perhaps one of the most well known of the genre. Cyndi sells the song incredibly well, so it's just up to you as to if you'll appreciate it or not. Clearly, a lot did, as this made it into the top 10! A great showing for an iconic song.

---

#Just want to have fun

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10. A feminist anthem that isn't obnoxious or misandric? We STAN

**bandnitos** (10): anyone rating this below a 10 is getting hate crimed

**bulforster** (10): The first song she ever released is one of the best pop songs of all time. A true icon.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): We really snapped in this stretch of the rate, huh? Time After Time also kinda deserved but we'll let it slide.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/beed09223a360ef55a319cb7773e9d06/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): I didnt actually do the rate this song was one but I was fully expecting it to win. Then I check in to see if it won and I see How Will I Know has an above 10 average and this didn't really get anywhere close to that, but don't let that distract you from the fact this song is IT. This is a Classic.

**Misentro** (10): Iconic, legendary, timeless.

**nightjesus** (10): It’s just legendary. That’s it. Cyndi Lauper is just a legend.

**timothy444** (10): Timeless

**vhqv1997** (10): Maybe I do want to have fun

**wavingwolves** (10): ...damental rights?

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): I too get asked by my father what I'm going to do with my life.

**anothertown** (9): I love the star wars beeps and boops at the end

**Awkward\_King** (9): i present to you the kacey musgraves and hayley williams live cover of this already phenomenal song

**bespectacIed** (9): Fucking godly instrumentals saved cyndi's atrocious voice. Classic pop song.

**BlueMetalWave** (9): Love this song.

**dnugs\_** (9): a great song will always be so catchy

**fadedblue09** (9): I wanted Time After Time, but this is good too.

**SFbby** (9): Cyndi reworked this song into a feminist anthem that is both playful and critical of the times

**CarlieScion** (8): im still mad that this got my rate announcement video blocked

**ditacarlita** (8): I'm sick of this song

**helpimbeing** (8): They sure do.

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's just a fun song, though the backing vocals must be locked out, because they are desperate to find the key

**runaway3212** (8): an amazing song that I have ruined for myself by overplaying it, but it's still amazing

#Misogynists

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i've never loved this song as much as most people but its still a legendary bop

**CritneySpearz** (7): I kind of hate her voice lmao still a bop

**twat\_brained** (7.7): I know it's a classic but there's just some part of me that doesn't understand the love everyone has for this one

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): the tune is catchy af but i never liked her tone in this sue me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): Overplay has tainted my enjoyment of this song a fair amount but its still a classic

**vayyiqra** (7): Yeah we know feminism rah and this is a bop but also I can't get over that this song was written by a middle-aged (I think) man who was horny and that makes it kind of weird.

**waluigiest** (6): time after time deserved this spot :-/ if it weren’t for How Will I Know (a perfect song) it could easily be a rate winner

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (2): every time I hear this song I have the urge to destroy whatever device it's playing on

Rather Be was submitted from the EDM/Pop Girl Collabs rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.222. Not to be entirely biased or anything, but in my opinion Rather Be has the most iconic loss(es) of 2019. Not only did it fall short in the EDM rate where it lost by just 1.2 points, but it also lost the UK Pop Girls rate to Touch by Little Mix. I personally think Rather Be is pop perfection - not even that it's one of the best pop songs in existence, because I don't necessarily think that's true, but more so that it's just so... clean. And it works - it's definitely a bop. However, I feel like it may have suffered a bit here due to it being rated again very recently. I thought it had a strong shot at top 5, but it never made it there. Still, top 10 is a good showing! Give Clarity your 11s in Winners Rate 2!

#There's no song I'd rather hear

**1998tweety** (11): Third times the charm right? This song is so warm and soft and makes me feel good, Jess is the perfect fit for it.

**anothertown** (11): IM READY! frigging large popcorn! Hot dog! Damn slurpy dammit! Don’t talk to me when I sit down to [listen to] this! Don’t touch me ! Don’t breathe in my direction ! This is it!

**kappyko** (11): ON GOD

**letsallpoo** (11): fuck you /u/tragickindom1

**ManofOranges** (11): I did both the EDM rate and the british girls rate and both times I gave this song an 11 and both times I witnessed this song just barely lose first place by a hair. And now here I am again, rating this song again. Do I give this song my 11 for a third time? Do I hitch myself to this wagon that's most likely bound to lose for a third time in a row? Do I triple down on what I've done? Do I reopen the wound just so popheads can rub salt in it for a third painful time? It's certainly a thought that's run through my mind. I honestly don't know if I can bear it again. I think I've come to terms with the fact that this song isn't gonna win (I haven't), and you know what? That's fine (it really isn't) because in the end, I don't think any other song is going to be known as the song that was robbed twice right at the end. That's kind of iconic at least, in it's own demented kind of way.

**timothy444** (11): I originally gave this a 9.5 in the EDM rate because while it is quite possibly one of the best songs ever released last decade, I felt that it didn’t fit in with the theme that well because it’s essentially a pop song rather than an EDM banger. Clarity rightfully won that rate but now “Rather Be” is a contending track in an All Star rate, it wouldn’t be justice to give a score lower than an 11. So I want to break down my reasoning on why this song is the pinnacle of pop music. Clean Bandit’s “Rather Be” is a song of perfection and one that does absolutely everything right from the simplicity of the lyrical content, the unique techniques of the production and how those two elements play off each other in an overarching theme. It was already a bold move to think about combining classical music with electronic pop music but to actually implement it without sounding like a novelty genre, you have to take the fundamentals from both genres and combine them in a way that sparks a fresh take on what a song could be. Sure, Lindsey Stirling combined classical with dubstep in 2012 but it went nowhere in the true mainstream market because of how strange and odd it would sound on Top 40 radio stations. So how did Clean Bandit (and Jess Glynne in the U.K.) get such critical acclaim and worldwide success over this fusion of two niche genres? The production needs to be analysed throughout the whole song first. It starts out with a short violin playing a short but memorable motif. It’s not simple but it’s not too complex either; these series of notes need to exist to set the tone of the song and also to draw the listeners in. Halfway throughout the intro, you can hear Jess Glynne’s voice singing in harmony to the motif and it’s at that moment where the repeated set of notes change slightly before the violin goes silent for the next minute. The first verse starts and the same set of notes are heard once again but the violin isn’t playing them; an electronic synth is. While this repeats throughout the first verse, layers of the instrumental get slowly added with the drums and bass growing prevalent. But then the chorus hits hard and that’s when the piano comes in with this majestic chord structure while Jess is pelting those vocals out. We hear all the instruments come to life in this first chorus, like they’re going all out trying to impress the listener, calling out to them to ‘give them a chance’! What makes this so genius though is how the violin joins in at the climax of the chorus, making the track expose itself as a classical electronic pop song, without startling the audience. From the beginning of “Rather Be” to the end of the chorus, the instrumental track was dedicated to transitioning a revealing the true nature of the song, from a great sounding dance-pop anthem to a masterpiece blend of both classical music and electronic synth-pop. All while maintaining the catchiness and feel of an underrated radio hit. Honestly, there’s just so much more I want to talk about this song such as the meaning of the lyrics but it would probably take up a lot more space. Rather Be is THE song of 2014 and quite possibly the decade so rating this song again gives me hope that it will get the #1 it truly deserves.

**bespectacIed** (10): My 11 in its original rate, how the fuck did stinky Zedd beat this perfection

**bulforster** (10): So self evidently flawless that trying to explain makes me feel like I'm not doing it justice.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): The Raven of /r/popheads, I honestly love it. Get that #2 spot, you're doing amazing sweetie.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of the most iconic pop songs of the 2010s, need i say more? glynncels really won with this one

**fadedblue09** (10): This is an EDM/pop girl collaboration done right, with both the production and vocals standing out equally. This really should've won at least 1 rate already.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/44d4d25208d08cc7cab080fc3c317700/tenor.gif

**materialqirl** (10): again!

**Misentro** (10): This song makes me so nostalgic for just a few years ago. I've heard it so many times and yet I'm still not sick of it, the energy is just so explosive.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the instrumentation alone sends me to heaven

**ReallyCreative** (10): It's a classic. I was streaming the hell out of it on release but even now it's aged pretty gracefully. This song was even good enough to turn me into a bit of a Jess Glynne stan for like 3 months

**roxieloxie** (10): god i cant believe i witnessed the clarity/rather be switchup live. that was truly a moment and ever since then i have not been able to trust a popheads rate results

**skargardin** (10): Pop perfection methinks

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): consistently slaps

**twat\_brained** (10): There's no point betting for this to win since this has ranked 2nd twice

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): pop perfection

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I can't think of this song without also thinking of this comment

**bandnitos** (9): i may have bleached my hair but i need this ginger solidarity

**fishingfor8** (9): It's so pure and light and was so incredibly impactful on the decade

**helpimbeing** (9): I was very disappointed when I learned that the girl in the MV wasn't Jess Glynne. A really clean, compelling melody with a pretty unique sound in the pop scene and Jess Glynne delivers a perfectly fitting vocal performance.

**waluigiest** (9): a manicured sparkly hit that deserves the world

**nightjesus** (8): Aww this song has always been a guilty pleasure of mine.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): fun story for my senior prom the theology teacher at my high school made the entire graduating class learn a dance to this song and everyone agreed that it was the worst experience of their high school lives. anyway the song itself is a bop

**vayyiqra** (8): Hard to believe this is the same Clean Bandit that made the awful Marina song "Baby". This is really good, and Jess' voice works so well with the instrumental track with the strings and piano. I can definitely vibe to this.

**BlueMetalWave** (7): it's cute.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.9): much better out of the context of jess glynne's shit album!

**SFbby** (8): Was an excellent song, sadly got overplayed into a good song

**CarlieScion** (8): i refuse to participate in the meme-ing of this song but its sorta a big bop

**runaway3212** (7): not my favourite of either clean bandit or Jess Glynne, but a solid song none the less.

**dnugs\_** (6.5): eh

**zadooi** (6): This song is just annoying.

**Awkward\_King** (4): i don't think this is that bad for a song, it's just very overplayed and i also can't think of jess glynne without thinking of jet2 airways and i hold that as a personal fault

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): it's not bad but I don't know how after years this song still feels completely overplayed to me

**vhqv1997** (1): I thought I liked this song before, but now I've realized that this song is just hella boring, filled with cheap tricks to pass off as entertaining. I love a nice strings section but they served no purpose in this song. The vocals are fine, but kinda emotionless. Everything was created just to show off the idea of a good song instead of using any creativity to make it so, and to be honest it just makes me hate it even more than if it was just straight up bad.

Hard Times was submitted from the 2017 Moody Pop Rock rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.374. Approximately one year ago, the 2017 Pop Rock rate had its results revealed, and Paramore stans lost on that day when Hard Times just barely fell short of the win, with Don't Take The Money by Bleachers snatching it instead. As good as Don't Take The Money is, that was truly a painful loss for me because Hard Times is one of my favourite songs, and definitely my favourite out of this group of 60 - as such, it received my 11. I truly thought that this would be a LOCK for the top 5, and have a really strong chance at winning the whole thing, but unfortunately I was proven wrong. In fact, this song never even managed to touch the top 5. A shame, because I would have loved to see this win, but alas...

#HIT ME WITH LIGHTNING!

**agentofscranton** (11): the greatest robbery in popheads rate history as far as i'm concerned

**DaHumanTorch** (11): "and i still don't know how i even survive"...this song is how. i feel like hayley stalked me when writing much of this song and others on after laughter. i have so many memories blasting this song on repeat during worse-than-usual bouts of depression in 2017/18. a definite 11 and one of my favorite song of all time.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): One of their best songs. They pulled off the move to a more poppy sound perfectly. And a happy sounding song about depression is such a mood. I think it’s one of the most relevant and best made songs as of recently so that’s why it gets my 11.

**rickikardashian** (11): have you ever heard a song you can't believe it's that good, but somehow it is? Like it shouldnt be humanly possible to come up with something so amazing, yet that song exist, that's how I feel about Hard Times

**skargardin** (11): Deserved the world, honestly there are few Paramore songs that I have instantly loved but this was one of them! They took the trope of mixing upbeat production with depressing lyrics and molded it to perfection and it will stand the test of time as one of their very best songs, periodt.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): this song started what was arguably paramore’s best era. it deserved so much more than it actually got, i’m still annoyed that it only peaked at #90 on the hot 100 and lost the 2017 pop rock rate. also if paramore is in a rate they automatically get my 11

**1998tweety** (10): An incredible pop song, the production on this is so so good. I especially love the breakdown at the end.

**anothertown** (10): For this song to have hit squarely at age 24 was an eternal blow

**Awkward\_King** (10): i dont have a comment on this song i just love it and think if you don't i really can't trust you as a person

**bandnitos** (10): you know songs like that they are stories that people can identify with you know what i mean anybody children were singing this song at graduations at weddings at funerals

**fadedblue09** (10): Not my favourite by them tbh. Why is this here instead of Told You So?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/569651722646061058/647115249010343986/dancin_gif.gif

**materialqirl** (10): period period PERIOD

**poppinmmolly** (10): big bop

**ReallyCreative** (10): Such an iconic song from start to finish. Killer chorus, killer bridge, the hardest times are being felt by our wigs!

**runaway3212** (10): This song deserved much more than it got, it's such an amazing song.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): the earworm to end all other earworms

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): The perfect opener to a perfect pop-rock album

**timothy444** (10): They went for a different style in the form of New Wave and it worked out great! Sucks that radio ignored one of their best songs of their career.

**twat\_brained** (10): words cannot describe how disappointed I was to learn this had placed 2nd overall. This rate I'm banking on a top 10 at the very least but nothing

**untutorable** (10): kind of an eternal mood

**wavingwolves** (10): upbeat sad songs? yes. upbeat sad songs by paramore? fucking YES.

**bulforster** (9.8): I just got into Paramore and am going through some Hard Times which this song is helping with. I wish it had a little more bite to it and it could've been my 11.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): I didn't do this rate because I literally could not listen to After Laughter without being super depressed. I binge-listened to it in probably the worst year of my life then quit it cold turkey. Still love everything about it though.

**SFbby** (9): Hayley Williams makes despair sound like another day in the park

**vhqv1997** (9): I love Hayley but she has never been a good lyricist and this song, perhaps aside from the chorus, is kinda low-effort lyrically. But thank god because the instrumentals are amazing, especially the solo at the end. Taylor York did a monumental job here, and his part was the highlight of the entire song.

**dnugs\_** (8.5): was obsessed at first but lost it’s magic....i can still bop to it here and there

**ditacarlita** (8): a perfectly appropriate and cute lead single to introduce us to the new Paramore sound and themes of After Laughter

**nightjesus** (8): I really liked the different sound Paramore had for this album. Also this song is more relatable then I’d like to admit. Lel life do b lik dat sometimes.

**roxieloxie** (8): the first time i heard this song i instantly loved it

**vayyiqra** (8): I used to love this song, and I really needed this album in the summer of 2018, when I was really depressed and thus vibed with it. It's still a bop, but while I would've given it a 10 for sure back then, maybe I've worn it out a bit. It is still a great song though.

**waluigiest** (8): been in love since the first strike of the marimba

#Rock Bottom

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): OK, this song is a biiiiiiit overrated. It's still great, but not the third coming of Jesus.

**Misentro** (7): Solid, but weird in a tacky way.

**yourfacesucksass** (6.7): not horrible but not great, i appreciate the new direction but it's forgettable instantly

**helpimbeing** (6): Palatable and catchy but a bit bland.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (3): I can't stand listening to this song for longer than thirty seconds

**BlueMetalWave** (3): just ain't it for me.

Screwed was voted in from the NPR-Core rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 9.140. Upon first listening to Dirty Computer, Screwed was one of my instant favourites. The guitar riff that opens the song is fantastic, and the lyrics are incredibly memorable. Janelle truly is a genre chameleon and can pull off anything, including the anthemic pop that Screwed exhibits. While it may not reach the heights of Make Me Feel, Screwed was by far the most desired wildcard song as it received the most votes by quite a large margin. In the end, it makes it to the top 10 with a very solid showing.

---

#Let's get SCREWED!

**Awkward\_King** (11): im just still so blown away by it like yes janelle please fuck me and then tell me about the ingrained issues our governmental systems have

**BlueMetalWave** (11): Everything she does is perfect, the 11 is hers.

**bespectacIed** (10): Luv the double entendre. Love the iconic Oscar Wilde bridge. Love janelle so much, Dirty Computer one of the best albums of the past decade

**bulforster** (10): Janelle saying “Everything is sex, except sex, which is power” is so powerful it reverberated back through time and snatched Foucault’s wig so hard he was bald for the rest of his life. Best song on Dirty Computer.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): It's a strange feeling because at the same time I cannot relate at all to the sentiment, I also want to call this song a revolutionary mood?

**CritneySpearz** (10): a fucking bop we stan our kween mod

**DaHumanTorch** (10): "everything is sex...except sex which is power...you know power is just sex...now ask yourself who's screwing you" wow my favorite bible verse

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is such a mood.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/d308a3c0a49eb48e98bf00f09eea0776/tenor.gif

**J\_Toe** (10): how can I give Janelle and Gaga both my 11s?

**ManofOranges** (10): Fucking bop

**nightjesus** (10): It’s like Santana mixed with Prince. I also love the song writing. Amazing job Queen Mod.

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song is better than Make Me Feel and Kamala voice I think we should have that conversation

**roxieloxie** (10): This entire album is iconic and after hearing all of *golden hour* i can finally say, dirty computer deserved the grammy. anyway this song is so fucking iconic. I witnessed this song second row from the stage and theres nothing like the experience of being sprayed with a water gun from her and her dancers

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): For someone who’s never had sex before this song sure makes me feel like a slutty queen

**vayyiqra** (10): As a horny person who lives in fear of the impeding end of the world from climate change ... same. But seriously folks, this is one of the best songs on a great album, and I would give it my 11 if it also had the brilliant coda section "Django Jane".

**waluigiest** (10): This song is my everything!!!! The front half is fun and funky and the back half is mechanical and funky in an entirely different sense. One of the best on Dirty Computer, and that’s high praise. My new favorite bit is the shimmering, higher harmony voice she layers over the bridge. It’s so wet.

**zadooi** (10): Will this song be song of the summer for the third year in a row? Sources say yes.

**wavingwolves** (9.4): when janelle said "everything is sex expect sex which is power you know power is just sex now ask yourself who's screwing you" i really really really really felt that

**1998tweety** (9): A highlight from the album, Screwed blends politics and sexuality together quite well. There's something so primal about wanting to have sex when (under the illusion that) the world is ending, and I adore it. The rap verse blends in seamlessly and keeps the flow of the song rolling. My 2 caveats though are that the feature doesn't really feel needed (half the time I can't tell if it's Zoe singing since she sounds so similar to Janelle), and I did find some of the lyrics in the rap verse to miss the mark, but with all that aside it's a pretty solid tune.

**bandnitos** (9): this song is pure joy

**fishingfor8** (9): Well now i want to screwed in a matinee. This is also better than Make Me Feel for the record

**rickikardashian** (9): I feel a lil dumb for not getting the sex is power thing

**runaway3212** (9): It feels amazing to listen to this song, it's just honestly a good time.

**timothy444** (9): Quite a decent bop that pops off hard.

**twat\_brained** (9): again… G A Y S W O N. But like… is everything sex? How can everything be sex? Then again who am I to question a moderator?

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): omg so funky how haven't i heard this before

**anothertown** (8): A bubblegum synth bop with that breakdown in the middle and the outro… We love it!!

**ditacarlita** (8): I've never listened to Dirty Computer, this song has told me I should

**vhqv1997** (8): Bonnie's arc on Big Little Lies S2 may have been an absolute mess, but that doesn't mean this song is bad

**skargardin** (8): Queen

#I don't care

**fadedblue09** (8): Hook is kinda eh but I like the verses here.

**helpimbeing** (7): Love the lyrics but the song is pretty forgettable to me.

**SFbby** (7): What if I don't like getting screwed?

**kappyko** (3): i still feel like this is really immature

High Horse was voted in from the NPR-Core rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 9.299. This was my 11 in its original rate, and while I'm a fan of the album as a whole, it's definitely my favourite from Golden Hour by far. Maybe it's not as ~sophisticated~ as its competition from both the rest of Kacey's album and her competition from the NPR-core rate, but WHEW it SLAPS! Mixing country sounds with disco elements was a surefire way to get the gays on Kacey's side, and it shows with its placement in this rate. This would have been a great winner in my opinion, but unfortunately it just barely falls short of the top 5.

---

#I'll take the Kesha - High Road

**moooo566** (11): i almost didn't pick an 11 here because it was so difficult to choose just one but i can't let kacey down so here we are

**Awkward\_King** (10): disco country feminism yee haw yee hoe

**bandnitos** (10): kacey musgraves is a main pop girl

**bulforster** (10): My introduction to Kacey, no choice but to stan for life.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I've met plenty of assholes in my life, I can relate to Kacey here.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this would have been my 11 if hard times wasn't in the rate. ya'll better do kacey justice

**ditacarlita** (10): nothing on Golden Hour deserves a score lower than ten

**ManofOranges** (10): This is a classic this is a classic

**materialqirl** (10): PERIODTTTT

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): yee haw

**ReallyCreative** (10): This is the top level of music, you're doing it right here

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): imagine not liking this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Now THIS I can get behind! If more country music was like this it wouldn’t be my least favorite genre

**waluigiest** (10): This song is joy.

**wavingwolves** (10): *sings this song to my own fucking self"

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): I love horses

**nightjesus** (9): I love this song. My dad and I love Kacey Musgraves and we love to talk about her songs and her songwriting. This one has so many people this could be about. I like to think that this is inspired by Donald Trump but it could be applied to anyone. Dad agrees but he also thinks it’s inspired by her trailer park town.

**SFbby** (9): When Kacey Musgraves tells you to get off your high horse it means you have a BIG EGO and need to tone it down

**slimboyfriend** (9): RIP Joanne

**alwayswords** (8.7): yeehaw

**BlueMetalWave** (8): One of the better tracks of Golden Hour.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://media1.tenor.com/images/2bf30b6dfae9bd44be613a13deb6b52b/tenor.gif

**helpimbeing** (7): Yeehaw.

#Classic in the wrong way

**1998tweety** (9): This is a bop but y'all overate it so much lmao. The lyrics aren't anything special and honestly the chorus could punch just a little more. Still bops though

**bespectacIed** (8): Used to love this song so much but now I feel the faint disco production is contrived and underutilized.

**roxieloxie** (7.5): i knew my neighboorhood was too late to be saved by gentrification when i heard one of the white neighboors blasting this at 10:03 in the morning when i went to go check the mail

**poppinmmolly** (7): I've said this before but I think this is meh. Disrupts the flow of the album and the lyrics are not up to her usual caliber.

**dnugs\_** (6): the first kacey song i discovered and i loved it at first but compared to the rest of the album it just like falls short for me

**vhqv1997** (6): This song degrew on me the more I listened to it.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Ok this was a downgrade after Slow Burn. I just hope this isn’t indicative of the rest of Golden Hour….

**anothertown** (5): I don’t really get the Kacey hype but that’s ok idc. What I do like about this song is the small details in the instrumentation, the instruments that come in just a little bit, like the spanish guitar in the bridge and the banjo in the final chorus.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): still don't really like her music but I think this might be my favourite song of the album

**J\_Toe** (5): nope

**vayyiqra** (3): I used to like this song or at least thought it was the least bad song on this album, but then I realized I don't really like it and was bamboozled because it was the least country-ish song on it. It's not even that good or clever, it just kind of bops. If I wanted nu-disco, I'd listen to Daft Punk, or Mark Ronson, or Chromatics

Paparazzi was voted in from the 2009 Billboard Year-End rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 9.048. If there's one thing I personally did NOT want to see happen in this rate, it was Paparazzi winning. I love the song, it's a 10 for me, but seeing Gaga win again would have been so uninteresting. The people definitely wanted to see it happen, seeing as it was yet another song voted in from the 2009 rate and did exceptionally well (as it always does), but unfortunately for the Gaga stans out there looking for her to get another All Stars win, it had just a few detractors that makes it come up just short.

---

#I'm your biggest fan

**Misentro** (11): What can you even say about this song? It speaks for itself. This is the top level of pop music, you're doing it right here.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): THIS is the supreme Gaga song and nobody can tell me otherwise and it's been robbed SO many times can we finally let it get the win it deserves

**1998tweety** (10): Love this song, so so iconic. Despite being kind of catchy, releasing this as a single was so risky cause of how broody it is and how weird the lyrics are.

**anothertown** (10): Her best song 8)

**Awkward\_King** (10): it's just so good y'know

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Another iconic song.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): imagine not giving this a 9 or a 10, couldn't be me

**ditacarlita** (10): this is her second best song after LoveGame

**helpimbeing** (10): pop perfection

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourite Gaga songs.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media.giphy.com/media/3o7aTq1zuUIvU3DOXS/giphy.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember watching the 2009 rate and being surprised by just how far this song got and I am fully prepared to watch it probably do the same thing again

**materialqirl** (10): its a gaga song they all 10 bih

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): iconic.

**poppinmmolly** (10): my 2nd fave Gaga song!!

**Tolk1en** (10): One of my favorite Lady Gaga songs, LG6 when ? :despair:

**vayyiqra** (10): The first Pophead to say The Fame is "dated" and has "aged badly" gets shot on sight. It's a great debut full of amazing songs, and this is one of them. Words coming to mind are "earworm" and "synthgasm". This is a strangely dark song to become a big hit (Blondie did it first I guess, and the Police) and for some reason I fuck with that concept. I am trying to forget she once performed it onstage in a wheelchair though.

**wavingwolves** (10): i remember waiting for the premiere of the music video on mtv.... good times... simpler times...

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): omg who would have guessed a makeup artist could make such a bop

**\_wailordfan** (9): I wish she had a bit more harmonies in the chorus

**alwayswords** (9): “That was a classic, that was a classic.”

**bandnitos** (9): why does this song sound so lo-fi like its really good but the instrumental sounds like a demo also the harmonies in the chorus are so nice

**bespectacIed** (9): The verses are laughably bad and don't make sense, but this is pop perfection

**SFbby** (9): This song is art

**skargardin** (9): The song that turned me into a longtime fan, ugh

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): iconic song and iconic video

**twat\_brained** (9): I love this woman and this song like nothing else. I don't quite love it like Poker Face, Marry the Night or Gypsy, but it's special to me nonetheless

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): vma 2009 for dayss tho

**dnugs\_** (8.6): was definitely my favorite gaga song when i was younger

**runaway3212** (8.5): I dislike the production of the fame, but on this song it really works and the vma performance really elevates this song the high heights.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): When I was younger I thought she was talking about a guy named Papa Razzi bc I didn’t know what paparazzi was

**waluigiest** (8): has she ever performed this with an orchestra? Honestly it’s made for that

#Dated

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): The weakest Gaga song in this rate.

**nightjesus** (8): Nothing against this song, love me some Paparazzi. But Poker Face is better. And I’ll take that to my grave.

**bulforster** (7.6): Obviously iconic but hasn't aged super well imo

**CarlieScion** (7): there are better songs on the fame

**fishingfor8** (6): It's fine but this is a stacked list so this better not win

**kappyko** (6): hmmm

**timothy444** (6): Overall, in my opinion, to put this song in a word: overrated. I'm feeling a strong 5 to a light 6 on this thing.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): I recently realized that I don't really like Gaga's music all that much

**roxieloxie** (5): the chorus reminds me too much of hearing the kids bop commericials play their versions of this every five seconds

**gannade** (2): this is so dated

**vhqv1997** (0): Everytime one of those electronic futuristic wobbling synths come on in a song, I feel myself age by 5 years. I just... can't stand them. They sound like robots farting.

Chandelier was voted in from the Alternative Electropop Queens rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.365. When conducting the voting for the wildcard spots in this rate, I was praying that Chandelier made it in. It broke my heart to see it not be chosen by its rate host, and I'm glad that popheads came through in getting this one of the extra spots. Its universal appeal is made apparent by its absolutely excellent showing here in this rate, making the top 5. In fact, for a decent chunk of the rating period, Chandlier held the top spot, which I was happy to see. Unfortunately, as it progressed, the song fell a bit, but #4 is still great. Definitely one of the best hits of the decade and a song that is very much deserving of being Sia's breakout solo song on the Hot 100.

#Party girls

**mudkip1** (11): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it

**Tolk1en** (11): This is pop perfection : production, vocals, lyrics,... Even the MV is a masterpiece.

**twat\_brained** (11): It crushed me to not see this win the Electropop rate which is why it's getting my 11 here; I can't imagine another song here outscoring this one

**1998tweety** (10): Love this song, the first time I heard it on the radio I thought it was super weird and unconventional but I kept wanting to hear it over and over again. Def a contender for my 11.

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Iconic track.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Chandeliers are really pretty. Like, crystals? Hanging from the ceiling? That light up? Urgh, the whole fantasy. This song is good too.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): 1 2 3 1 2 3 DRINK. such a good song, a classic

**ditacarlita** (10): throwback to me screaming when I realised it was Maddy from Dance Moms in the video and nearly crying with pride

**helpimbeing** (10): yup

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/2ee0549bb4cbe44d61aa9ec3ead13b77/tumblr_mzdma0q6oJ1qd8zg3o4_250.gif

**J\_Toe** (10): look, not really sold on all Sia does but the song's good.

**ManofOranges** (10): This was my 11 for the rate it was in and I was certainly floored when it lost simply because Chandelier is just like a tour de force of a song. There are few other songs, if any, that just pack the sheer emotion that this one has. I'm not entirely sure how good of a chance this song has at winning because I don't think it has the same draw as other songs here, but there's denying the power of this song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this got me screaming despite having a sore throat

**rickikardashian** (10): the only reason I didn't give this an 11 is because since it came eout I've tried to sing it, but it has always been way too hard and I'm kinda resentful towards it

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): i can't believe how many iconic music videos are in this rate

**vayyiqra** (10): I used to love this album, and I don't listen to it much anymore but it is really good and this is classic. I also appreciate that with so many pop songs in the 2010s being about popping bottles in the club and whatever, she managed to have a huge hit about alcoholism and the dark side of that culture. One thing I've learned in my 20s is that partying is overrated and binge drinking sucks.

**dnugs\_** (9.7): i can stil listen to this song or watch the music video and get chills on a good day

**wavingwolves** (9.7): i love songs that are actually sad but don't sound like it and this is one of the best at it. sia sings it with such despair but it's still incredibly powerful and quite upbeat sonically

**bulforster** (9.6): "I'M GONNA FLY, LIKE A BIRD THROUGH THE NIGHT / FEEL MY TEARS AS THEY DRY" is one of my favourite moments in all of music.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Had to dock 0.5 cause I have heard it too much and it doesn’t have the same impact as it originally did

**bandnitos** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDwVkXVHIqg

**runaway3212** (9): Sia is just an incredibly talented songwriter and singer. Amazing song.

**SFbby** (9): This song embodies the desperation of a lost drunk child and Sia delivers painfully emotive vocals

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): y’all already know what this is https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jDwVkXVHIqg

**vhqv1997** (9): I really like Toad's cover of this, but Sia's vocals are good too. Bonus points for this song for starting a craze where the song was so addictive that everybody tried to sing it and subsequently destroyed their vocal chords.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Pretty sure she has more alternative-leaning songs than this

**kwcty6888** (8): great song but exhausting to listen to

**nightjesus** (8): I love Sia’s songwriting. I also love Maddies dancing from Dance Moms in the video clip. She performed so well. Improved the song for me to be honest.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Not my favorite Sia song but it's good for sure. I like playful Sia a little more than belt-high-notes-loudly-enough-to-shatter-the-earth Sia but I love Sia either way

**timothy444** (8): Not as indie as her other songs but damn, does Sia belts out the chorus!

**anothertown** (7.5): :toad:

#Won't open my eyes

**bespectacIed** (8): Overrated as fuck but the prechorus is pure genius

**gannade** (7.5): this is a good song but sias voice...

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yKhmA-Jfqw8

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I like this song but my throat hurts whenever I hear Sia scream

**roxieloxie** (7.3): tbt electric heart >>>>

**Misentro** (7): Good but overrated. A bit too much mumble shouting.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): it's giving me a headache. I used to really love it though and now I'm kinda sad to realize I've soured on it

Disturbia was submitted from the 2009 Billboard Year-End rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.053. Here it is - one of the most iconic (and for a lot, frustrating) losses of the year. I personally was okay with Poker Face taking the win, but Disturbia is one of my all time favourite Rihanna songs, and it sucked to see it sabotaged just because it has a Chris Brown co-write. It was great for it to see it get another shot here and do very well, but unfortunately - yet again - it just misses the win. I would have loved for it to take the crown, but alas. Not all hope is lost though, as Umbrella is still alive and in - can it win against ABBA?

**bandnitos** (8): the music video terrified me as a child

**CarlieScion** (8): the autotune in this makes it sound very dated, but it still bops hard

**slimboyfriend** (8): tbt when Rihanna couldn't say "shit"

**waluigiest** (8): I was 12 years old bopping to this no idea what it’s about only awww yah disturbia!!!

**bulforster** (7.6): The sloppy autotune really holds this otherwise pretty great song back.

**anothertown** (7): https://vm.tiktok.com/X8dasM/

**vayyiqra** (7): I think this song missed me somehow, but it's a great dark pop song (like "Paparazzi" right before it) and it could grow on me.

**vhqv1997** (7): This song is very haunting, but too bad the melody was too samey and repetitive for it to really take off.

**dnugs\_** (6.5): eh

**Tolk1en** (6): She has done so much better...

**BlueMetalWave** (5): I didn't find this song interesting when it released and I still don't.

Umbrella was submitted from the Billboard Songs of the Summer rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.016. And so, Rihanna just BARELY falls short of the win. Yet again. Same shit, nothing new. This definitely hurts for me, as Umbrella is an amazing song, a smash 10 for me, but it just couldn't pull through. Popheads truly said fuck Rihanna, we need R9, no rate wins for her until that happens. So she'd better get on releasing that so that she can win a real rate that isn't just the videography rate. Anyways, congrats to ABBA and their stans, a two time rate winner!

#You can stand under my umbrella

**1998tweety** (10): Can Rihanna finally win a rate? This song is so good, everything about it bops so hard.

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Iconic song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): It was so hard to not give this an 11. I love this song, it's between my favorites of all time. R9 is still coming 2019, guys.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of my favorite childhood songs easily. it's physically impossible not to sing along to this chorus. truly iconic

**ditacarlita** (10): even the first one second of the song is iconic

**fadedblue09** (10): Reminds me that I should listen to Good Girl Gone Bad soon!

**helpimbeing** (10): Invented weather.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a classique

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.giphy.com/media/ejm8tkFonl8o8/giphy.webp

**Misentro** (10): BECAUSE!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): ella ella eh eh eh

**runaway3212** (10): Rihanna at her best, most carefree, a genius song.

**SFbby** (10): Rihanna will shield you with her umbrella under the pouring rain and make you feel like the only person in the world

**skargardin** (10): iconique

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): wish i had a friend to share their umbrella with me

**Tolk1en** (10): This reminds me so many sweet memories. Listening to this song on the radio twice a day while going to school by bus.

**wavingwolves** (9.2): i vividly remember covering the eyes of my little cousin when she appeared naked in the video. and this is one of her best songs ever.

**anothertown** (9): BE-CAUSE!

**Awkward\_King** (9): i like rain i dont get the hate i don't think umbrellas are very good they always break too, only good thing to come from umbrellas is this song

**bandnitos** (9): uh huh uh huh JYEaH

**roxieloxie** (9): lowkey everytime i hear this song, for 3 seconds i think it's Empire state of Mind. then i just think about tom holland

**twat\_brained** (9): i've always preferred the version without Jay-Z's verse because I don't think he adds anything which Rihanna can't supply on her own.

**ManofOranges** (8.5): I feel like Jay Z doesn't have to be here also I feel like this song overstays its welcome just a bit too much. Other than that though it's fantastic.

**materialqirl** (8.5): wheres the album bitch

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): how many singers have songs as iconic as this??

**vhqv1997** (8): I remember when r/indieheads rated the Billboad decade-end songs and they let this sit at the bottom of the pile. Truly homophobic.

#Got wet from the rain

**bulforster** (8.2): GarageBand really did that.

**vayyiqra** (8): Jay-Z does not need to be here but whatever, song good intro bad.

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): Probably gonna catch some heat for this, but it just doesn't stack up against Rihanna's better songs or the masterpieces in this rate. It's fine but I don't really get why Jay-Z is here (as usual)

**\_wailordfan** (7): I hate to say it, but the song has aged, and not like wine.

**alwayswords** (7): jay-z dragged this song down

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): this song feels a lot more lackluster than i remember

**dnugs\_** (6): catchy but u can’t that rihanna singing umbrella ella ella eh eh eh eh eh isn’t just like annoying at this point

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): like objectively I think it's a good song but personally I listened to it nearly non-stop for like three months when it came out and I never recovered from that

Dancing Queen was submitted from the Classic Greatest Hits rate, where it placed at #6 with an average of 9.210. All Stars rates are the definition of a "grab bag" - at least two of the most highly ranked songs from each rate in the past year are chosen to battle it out once more, but instead of being confined to their more niche rates, they're put up against songs from various genres and styles that appeal to people with different tastes and preferences. With songs ranging from hip-hop to rock to musical ballads to country to EDM to of course pure pop, as well as releases going back several decades in the history of music, the winner of the rate is going to be something that can unify the majority of r/popheads users and isn't held back by being something more niche. ABBA is a group that appeals to a lot of people, having a vast list of classic songs that nearly everyone can agree on. I'm not at all surprised to see Dancing Queen pull through with the win, as it's definitely one of the most iconic songs in existence, and accomplishes the task of unifying curmudgeonly oldheads that like their music from the 70s and young gays that stan Ariana Grande and don't know what a Beatle is. Even saying this, I'm one of the few that's not infatuated with this song or ABBA in general, so for me personally I would have loved for Rihanna not to fall short YET AGAIN, but it's 100% understandable and 100% deserved for Dancing Queen to take the crown, and for ABBA to join the elusive multiple-rate-winner club.

#Seventeen

**1998tweety** (10): A classic, gay bop.

**bandnitos** (10): all i want is for my high school to perform mamma mia next year bc im a junior rn but i know it'll never happen

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Flawless track by a flawless group.

**CarlieScion** (10): im scandi im contractually obligated etc etc

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Peak karaoke song. Mamma Mia really snapped.

**Compulsively\_Epic** (10): Would be 11 if not for Veronicas

**DaHumanTorch** (10): SEE THAT GIRL WATCH THAT SCENEEEE DIGGING THE DANCING QUEENNNN

**helpimbeing** (10): Timeless classic that y'all fuckers did so, so, SO dirty in the last rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A classic! Abba did what the other girls couldn’t do. Can’t wait until everyone underrates this again because they think it’s overplayed even though I know you guys are definitely not listening to this song on your own time because it’s old.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/fba15e983eacf4fe88271e93e9f4fb4e/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): I thought this would be the ABBA song that won its rate, but it didn't and I was surprised. Nonetheless, this is a 10.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): only abba can make me believe i can dance

**poppinmmolly** (10): this isn't my own rate so I don't have to deflate a score

**rickikardashian** (10): The day I turned 17 was the happiest day in my life, because finally I could play this song loud and proud knowing damn well I was the Dancing Queen™ myself. The day I turned 18 was also great because I got shitfaced drunk

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): oh god nothing less than double digits for this

**timothy444** (10): Timeless

**vhqv1997** (10): Dancing queen, feel the meat on the tangerine

**wavingwolves** (10): this song never hits quite the same after you listened to it on your 17 birthday but it's still literally one of the best songs to ever exist

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): a timeless bop

**bulforster** (9.6): Cheesy as hell and I can see why people say it's overplayed, but I don't think I'm ever going to get tired of it

**anothertown** (9.5): one of the top three abba songs, a shining midtempo masterpiece

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): this is a song that transcends generations and everyone can agree is just a solid bop

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): Friday night and my inbox is low

**CritneySpearz** (9): kind of slaps

**dnugs\_** (9): same as above

**ReallyCreative** (9): It's a classic but it's kinda slow for a song that's supposed to be about dancing. You still can't help but move when you hear it though

**runaway3212** (9): ABBA is a gift and this song though not their best serves to remind us of that

**waluigiest** (9): ABBA has some incredible songs. Justice for Lay All Your Love on Me (didn’t it lose Day 2???) but this song is timeless

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Iconic, but the instrumentation was weirder than I remembered?

**materialqirl** (8.5): kinda overplayed

**twat\_brained** (8.5): cute

**bespectacIed** (8): Iconic

**J\_Toe** (8): There are so many ABBA songs I consider better than Dancing Queen, but I guess it's still a good song

**SFbby** (8): What happens when you turn 18? Are you no longer the dancing queen? Are there millions of dancing queens that are all 17?

**vayyiqra** (8): ABBA have better songs but this is still a classic, wonderful, joyous, so good I'm going to overlook the slightly weird "only 17" lyric which I'm sure is only there because it rhymes. (ABBA: Ackshually, it's ephebophilia.)

**roxieloxie** (7): we were at a holiday party and there was a silent DJ with various stations and there was a an oldies station and my little brother was vibing next to me and he asked me if the song he was listening to was dancing queen and i checked and it was and told him yes and he said he loved the song

#Eighteen

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): hot take but i never liked abba that much and this song is severely overrated

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (1): I always thought I hated Abba. Nope, turns out I just really dislike dancing queen
