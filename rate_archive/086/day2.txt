Up In Flames was submitted from the 20Gayteen rate, where it placed at #4 with an average of 8.612. I would have liked to see Troye with something in this rate, but I really can't complaing because Up In Flames is a BANGER. It's probably my favourite song from Palo Santo, which is saying something because that album is ALL bops! I was actually kind of surprised to see this do so well in its original rate, since it wasn't even a single - I thought it would do closer to how it did in this rate. It was robbed a bit in my opinion as this is a 10 for me, but it's nice to see it make day 2.

---

#In 20Hunty we support gay artists

**CritneySpearz** (11): stan Years & Years gay icons!!!

**1998tweety** (10): Ok WOW why wasn't this on the standard edition?? It fits musically and it's not like it was packed anyway.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Flames, flames, flames on the side of my face.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): stream palo santo to help end homophobia for good!

**SFbby** (10): Olly provided a dance bop with this hopeful song about burning down the past and looking into the future

**wavingwolves** (10): powerful shit

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): I LOVE everything about this song. It's impressive from every angle, it just needs a little more oomph to push it to a 10

**helpimbeing** (9): Never heard this before but it sounds like better Jonas Brothers.

**rickikardashian** (9): just gonna say this, I'm kinda mad no Troye song made it to this rate. y'all don't support our Australian gay king

**waluigiest** (9): first listened to this album because of the 20gayteen rate and wow I love it. For like 3 months that album was at the top of my rotation. This song is a great heavy banging dance song wow

**anothertown** (8.5): this is the first years & years song i heard, alright bitch! i’m listening!

**Misentro** (8.5): Not their best but still great; the production is fire.

**bandnitos** (8): this is the first song that i haven't heard and omfg its a banger also it kinda reminds me of blood orange

**ManofOranges** (8): I don't really quite understand all the hubbub about this song. When I first listened to it for its rate, I thought it was just above average at best but not like anything special. I maintain the opinion that there are other Years and Years songs that deserve this spot more. That being said, the song is still above average though!

**nightjesus** (8): I need to listen to Years & Years more. Shine is one of my most played songs. And this is just a damn BOP.

**bulforster** (7.8): This is good but feels a bit hollow somehow.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): It's GREAT but there's no bridge :/

**vayyiqra** (7): While I don't like the vocals on this, it's kind of a banger, and has a cool darkwave kind of sound. I don't hate it.

#Burn it down

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I forget this song, much like the 20gayteen rate itself, so I can't say I care much for it

**roxieloxie** (7): its goos but i need more from it

**vhqv1997** (7): This song needed a long instrumental solo section, the beats were pulsating and pushing against the vocals, but neither truly broke and the tension kept building and building and then... died off... Why...

**runaway3212** (6.5): It's fine, but not that interesting.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): https://66.media.tumblr.com/08d0428fc953fa6b902170e86aabc6ed/b8bbd47232256058-1a/s400x600/9410b51eb84685b39e8ec0c79d4deb2fe59137c3.gifv

**J\_Toe** (6): weird this is the years and years song on the list. Wish it was one of the better songs (unless they don't qualify for the rank because they were too liked. I didn't actually read the criteria for this rankdown. I just joined).

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): decent enough i guess

**BlueMetalWave** (5): I was a bit bored.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5): srry but i already forgot what this song sounded like

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): it's one of those songs where I can never remember what they actually sound like

#Drag ha!!!

**CarlieScion** (6): /u/tragickingdom1 WHY did u choose this over troye sivan u ho

**kappyko** (6): tk kina literally brought poo into the rate server to bully everyone into picking choices that make sense what the fuck why not troye sivan. this is still a bop though but COME ON!!!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): IF YOU'RE OVER ME WAS RIGHT THERE YOU TWINK

**letsallpoo** (0): fuck you /u/tragickingdom1

LIKE I WOULD was submitted from the One Direction Solo rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 8.562. Although the lyrics to this are, uh, kind of exhausting (we love songs where men sing about how they're soooo much better than whoever the girl is currently seeing... can you come up with something else?) I have to say that the production SLAPS. Zayn's album was a bit of a snooze at times but this deluxe track is a BANGER! Seeing it just barely squeeze into Day 2 with much bigger names getting the axe a day prior was really satisfying to me because I really like this song and, truthfully, I would have loved to see it win the 1D Solo rate.

---

#BETTAH DAN HE CAN

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (11): so I might be completely biased towards zayn because I have been listening to Mind of Mine and Icarus falls way too much lately ( and by lately I mean like the last year, but whatever) but I really like this song... I mean I said it's a bit too fuckboy-y in the 1D solo rate and I stand by that but... I don't know. Its grown on me?

**1998tweety** (10): I have no idea why this is on the deluxe version cause it's easily the best song on the album. The chorus on this is so so good and bops so so hard.

**bandnitos** (10): hhhEEEE won't touch u like i do

**CarlieScion** (10): hey that was my rate! stan king zayn. also this gets extra points for being like the only song on this forsaken album without that awful spelling

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I grew a lot on this song between the 1D rate and now. Probably one of the best solo songs from a 1D guy

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media3.giphy.com/media/NGkKNZpijQyL6/giphy.gif

**twat\_brained** (10): zayn's BEST

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): FUCK ME ZADDY, LIKE NO ONE ELSE WOULD

**roxieloxie** (9.9): we didnt rate my favorite zayn bonus track (bRiGhT) but this is my second fave so it will have to do.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): easily my favorite zayn song (not like the bar is too high anyways)

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): omg damn i forgot about THIS BOP

**vhqv1997** (9): If you knew that it would sound wrong, why would you say "Promise it won't last long" anyway?

**waluigiest** (9): y’all did Zayn dirty in this rate. This song slaps so hard. Be nice to him!!!!

**ManofOranges** (8.5): This song is pretty infectious although the lyrics do kind of annoy me a little, which is saying something because I rarely if ever care about the lyrics. Anyways so, it's a cute song.

**anothertown** (8): this is a lesbian anthem

**fishingfor8** (8): How was someone this talented in the same group as Liam?

**materialqirl** (8): good but zayns kinda a flop so lol

#Stream Made In The AM

**wavingwolves** (8): i would by one direction outsold

**bulforster** (7.4): The instrumental of a bop, but Zayn's slightly soulless delivery somewhat nullifies it.

**ditacarlita** (7): Pillow talk it is not

**vayyiqra** (7): WHY ARE YOU SHOUTING, ZAYN? TURN OFF CAPS LOCK. THE KEY IS ON THE LEFT SIDE OF THE KEYBOARD. Okay this is kind of a banger tho.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): Why is this such a common topic? 'x doesn't treat you right, but I will!' It's not even the best song of this type.

**nightjesus** (6): Oh cool. I never listened to Zayn but this is kinda boppin. Like I’m not gonna save it on my Spotify but I’ll bop to it on a playlist if it came on.

**runaway3212** (6): Not my favourite

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Treat you Better but only slightly better

**timothy444** (6): ZAYN is so pretentious

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): i can groove to the beat but the lyrics feel too much like Zayn was browsing /r/niceguys a bit too long

**skargardin** (5): For the life of me i just cant get into zayns music

**BlueMetalWave** (4): Double Meh.

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): the production is okay I guess? Imagine how tired we are of straight men explaining to women how much better they are than their current SO like shut up and stream Juice by Lizzo

**helpimbeing** (3): Painfully generic.

**fadedblue09** (1): Never really liked the solo career trajectories of the 1D boys. They all seem try-hard and unoriginal. In this case, he sounds like a bad hybrid of Bieber and The Weeknd.

Holiday was submitted from the 80s Dancepop Debuts rate, where it placed at #6 with an average of 8.972. The Dancepop Debuts rate was one of only a couple I did not participate in last year because I am tasteless and think that music was invented when Britney debuted, but nonetheless it was interesting to see that Madonna fell short of the top 5 entirely, with Holiday being her highest song in the rate. Paula and Cyndi may have outpeaked Madge there, but she was given another chance to best them here and... it didn't work out. She's just barely making day 2, which is unforunate for her stans out there but for me personally I'm just fine with it... I'm not the biggest fan of this. But for the oldheads rooting for the other decades-old bops in this rate, not all hope is lost!

---

#This right here might make a bitch cry

**ditacarlita** (11): there are a lot of contenders for the top spot in this rate but imho nothing compares to this song, it is a perfectly crafted dance pop song, Madonna sounds great, the instruments are feel good, the hooks are catchy, I love Madonna cooing during the chorus, the lyrics are universal and relatable which has always been a part of M's charm. Madame X who? Go listen to the You Can Dance version of this song if you know what's good for you.

**1998tweety** (10): I've definitely heard this a lot before, a massive bop of my childhood.

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Another iconic song.

**fadedblue09** (10): Love those electric guitar riffs.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/8fad569df0a8fb287fb19970d29d0d6c/dd5059bd223540c6-2d/s640x960/fb381c80698bdb19f5ef2809690798717701e94b.gif

**materialqirl** (10): ITS MADONNA!!!

**vayyiqra** (10): Madonna (1983) is pop perfection and this is the best song on it, you can't change my mind. If you do not give this at least an 8, you are ageist and ungrateful to a true pop legend.

**wavingwolves** (9.3): this is what i call "end of the wedding party music"

**bulforster** (9): I don't even like this one that much in comparison to others but her hits have held the fuck up.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): queen of pop only is able to serve your honor, she loves to serve

**twat\_brained** (9): bit too instrumental in parts to be 10

**helpimbeing** (8.5): Classic bop.

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): A pretty basic but fun bop

**CarlieScion** (8): stan

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Happy holidays, everyone.

**runaway3212** (7.5): I don't know why but this is the most Madonna songs of all Madonna songs.

#For now let's get away

**bandnitos** (7): whenever i hear this song i just think of the kidz bop version bc like . does anyone remember the kidz bop cds that mcdonalds had for their happy meal toy like a long time ago??? mine had this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): Green Day’s Holiday is better

**bespectacIed** (6): i still object to Bordeline (a 10) being snubbed for Holiday

**anothertown** (5): I never knew this was a medoner song. Well, I don’t love it.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): It's okay but it could have been a good minute shorter

**RandomHypnotica** (5): if we took this song out, took this song out day 1, just one song from the rate, it would be, it would be so nice

**roxieloxie** (4): madona songs are always 5 minutes and borring to me but this on is only 4 minutes so il give it more points

**vhqv1997** (1): Holiday by SNSD outsold

What's Wrong was submitted from the 2017 Moody Pop Rock rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 8.581. Prior to listening through the albums for the Pop Rock rate that PVRIS was a part of, I had never listened to them, and was mostly participating to support Paramore. However, listening to their sophomore album All We Know Of Heaven, All We Need Of Hell was quite a pleasant experience! From the comments, it seems that a lot of people participating in this rate were not too familiar with this song or PVRIS, which probably affected its placement a bit. It still made day 2 though, which is neat! If any of y'all reading this haven't listened to any PVRIS past this song I definitely recommend doing so!

#Carly Rae Jepsen - Wrong Feels So Right

**\_wailordfan** (10): holy shit this slaps. I'm giving 10s to almost everything here.

**bandnitos** (10): in 2018 i tweeted them asking if i could get a free ticket for their show bc i had no money and they guestlisted me and my friend

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ...wow, just wow. i have never heard a pvris song until now and i am for sure checking them out right away. the lyrics especially whew...a masterpiece

**SFbby** (10): Hard to believe she didn't sell her soul to make such a good song. Love the bursting chorus with the rockier edge

**helpimbeing** (9): Never heard this before but I'm obsessed.

**ReallyCreative** (9): A bop. Not particularly unique or crazy but it has grown on me since we rated it last year

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Synth Rock perfection

**1998tweety** (8.5): a GOOD depression bop

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): big bop

**runaway3212** (8.5): Great sound and great lyrics

**rickikardashian** (8.2): I wish anything could top the feeling I felt when hearing that opening for the first time

**bespectacIed** (8): bop

**BlueMetalWave** (8): great surprise to start off the rate. Never listened to them before.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Bitch no one *wants* to buy my soul, I've been trying a pitch for over seven months!

**fadedblue09** (8): Bridge kinda drags the song, but has a weirdly appealing hook.

**fishingfor8** (8): i have a friend that's super into this band but i've never really listened to their stuff. This is definitely one of their better songs

**nightjesus** (8): Oh wow that bridge. She goes OFF.

**vhqv1997** (8): I don't listen to PVRIS that often but I always love how atmospheric their songs are. This track sounds quite suffocating, like you're being swallowed up by a storm of thick air. While the lyrics can be somewhat juvenile, at least the instrumentals and the vocals more than make up for that.

**yourfacesucksass** (8): Have never listened to this but I like it

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): wasn't really feeling it in the beginning but it got better the longer it went on

**slimboyfriend** (7): It's a little murky, but good

**timothy444** (7): Above average

**vayyiqra** (7): After thinking I should get into this band for probably years, I finally hear them and I love it! It has everything I want in a pop song and is so atmospheric. Now watch Popheads rob it because they have undeveloped frontal lobes and think five minutes is too long to pay attention.

#This song is what's wrong

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Don't Need a Metaphor to tell you , this song is repetitive

**roxieloxie** (7): I don't remember this song im sorry, its not bad but i dont think i would actively listen again

**skargardin** (7): I've never been to big a PVRIS fan, this song is quite good but doesn't really do it for me

**twat\_brained** (7): it's okay I guess. I wish we were rating Heaven instead :(

**alwayswords** (6.5): this drags

**materialqirl** (6.5): girl..compared to the other songs-

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): don't love it but i wouldn't skip it

**anothertown** (6): I figured out what makes this “not my thing” and it’s the oh-whoa-ohohs

**bulforster** (6): It kinda slaps but the lyrics just don't click for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): https://media1.tenor.com/images/611d394edb889cca7ca3e060bc17036f/tenor.gif

I Wanna Get Better was submitted from the Mid 2010s Synthy Pop Rock rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 8.683. Jack Antonoff, producer for many popheads faves, gets the axe fairly early here. I'm not entirely surprised, but maybe that's my bias in thinking Rollercoaster is a much better song and would have performed better than this. Nonetheless, I definitely get this songs appeal as an anthem about self-improvement, so my apologies to this song's stans that are undoubtedly upset with this cut.

---

#This song deserved better! Better, better better

**ImADudeDuh** (11): https://media.tenor.com/images/3e206565294f73b08e8b56eae235ff1b/tenor.png https://thumbs.gfycat.com/HarmfulMelodicKestrel-size_restricted.gif https://media.giphy.com/media/kigKjuS7wBrVk0hrox/giphy.gif

**1998tweety** (10): oh WOW this is a total mood.

**bespectacIed** (10): I truly regret that I gave my 11 to what I thought was the obvious winner (Somebody Else) on its original rate. This is literally one of the most important songs in life, the impact this song has to my psyche and well-being is profound and irreversible. This is my personal favorite song in the rate.

**CarlieScion** (10): YES.

**rickikardashian** (10): I'm such a hoe for Jack antonoff music, I hate myself

**roxieloxie** (10): this song makes me want to go feral and run up to a rooftop and scream the words to this song and it just be like that sometimes

**vhqv1997** (10): Bleachers' songs are always marred by one or two things: Jack's overindulgence of his own ideas, leading to a freaky tangled mess of music, and Jack's subpar vocals that fail to carry his songs to greatness. Thankfully, this song didn't suffer from either of that. Carrying a great message too, it's just a really phenomenal track.

**waluigiest** (10): fun. was my favorite band when this came out, so I listened to this song on loop exclusively for SO LONG. It’s beautifully written and I’m still so into it.

**wavingwolves** (10): no words for how important this song was for me when it came out! it's like instant serotonin!

**bulforster** (9.6): Same.

**Awkward\_King** (9): i actually love this song so i won't but i hope somebody who gave this a low score just said "i want this song to get better" otherwise that's a missed opportunity. it's not that funny, it'd just be missed

**bandnitos** (9): a fuckin VIBE im so unstable at the moment i had to go beg my counselor to give me indefinite extensions in my classes bc im such a fucking wreck rn

**ReallyCreative** (9): A classic, the bridge is my only complaint as its just a little too abrasive, but overall the song is just too good at capturing that almost manic level of desperation of trying to take yourself to a better place, whether that's emotionally, mentally, or physically

**SFbby** (9): Every time I listen to this song it somehow gets better

**twat\_brained** (9): I wanna get fun. reunited too but clearly that's not happening anytime soon so why should I try to get better

**yourfacesucksass** (8.9): Completely forgot about this until now but, yass

#rollercoaster >

**kappyko** (9): rollercoaster is better imo

**vayyiqra** (7): same, jackoff. same.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): Who turned on the blender halfway through?

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the message but this song just doesn’t grab me. It’s catchy but just too choppy for me.

**helpimbeing** (6.5): Cute.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): in my memory this sounded better

**DaHumanTorch** (6): not my type of music but i didn't hate it

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): still waiting for a bleacher's song i like tbh

**ManofOranges** (5): This song is a bit too much

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): I still stand by my statement that this song sounds like Natural by Imagine Dragons

**BlueMetalWave** (4): Not my thing.

**fadedblue09** (3.8): Maybe I’ll just take Rollercoaster and Wild Heart and go...

**anothertown** (2): I thought this song was annoying before, and then I went and heard the intro and actually listened to the instrumental. Fuck

**Misentro** (1): Oh man this is annoying.

Anywhere was submitted from the UK Pop Girls rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 8.930. I personally was quite surprised to see this perform so well not only in its original rate, but also here in All Stars. It's a fairly basic song that screams of being a few years old at this point, with the vocal chop chorus being a huge part of the song. Still, it's a cute bop, and I really like the pre-chorus build-up to the drop/chorus. I thought this would have been a Day 1 cut, but good for all the Rita stans out there that this did a bit better.

---

#Just take me anywhere

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this song is so so good, the drop is actually good and the lead up to it slays too. I remember when I first got into this song, I actually talked to someone in math class and felt super happy about it. After class this came up on shuffle and I've associated this song with that moment since (and the whole day I spent bopping to it). The song just has so much energy in it, pop perfection!

**anothertown** (10): The best chorus anyone could possibly have and it’s gibberish. She freaked it

**CarlieScion** (10): this deserved to win!

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): THIS SONG DESERVED BETTER even tho it was a hit in Aus

**helpimbeing** (9): :)

**Misentro** (9): Normally I hate these choppy vocal choruses, but it really works here! Catchy, fun, really good.

**BlueMetalWave** (8): A bop.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): I feel like the beat is too fast for this song, if it was a bit slower it'd be a 10.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): queen of getting 100,000 retweets

**vayyiqra** (8): A moment of silence for Rita Ora, the other Albanian pop girl from England, who never had a chance. :pensive:

**twat\_brained** (7.7): since Earth only has a sphere of approximately 25000 miles the only place you could conceivably go that's "a million miles from LA" would be on a rocketship to outer space. I mean, not even the moon is 1,000,000 miles away. That's how unrealistic this song is.

**runaway3212** (7.5): Rita Ora is really confusing to me, but this song is pretty nice.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): it's Rita Ora. It does its job of filling radio play time while being completely inoffensive

#Take me anywhere but this song

**materialqirl** (8): i was never really into rita lol

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): Is this not "It Ain't Me" by Kygo ft. Selena Gomez

**bandnitos** (7): not the best single from this album

**J\_Toe** (7): if a song sounds like it could play on my gym's randomised, inoffensive group dj/spotify account, it means it's probably generic. this song plays at my gym way too much.

**waluigiest** (7): this is a little bit wet

**ReallyCreative** (6.3): Pretty decent until those voice cuts like ma'am this is not Nick Jr.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): https://media.giphy.com/media/AmaQdkL4m0IMg/giphy.gif

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Ive said it before and ill say it again : cut up vocal choruses should’ve been over years ago

**fadedblue09** (2.5): I've been told this album was no filler, and yet here I am wanting to skip it throughout my whole listen.

**vhqv1997** (2): Bruh, this song is as basic as it comes, there's literally nothing special about it

Shout Out To My Ex was submitted from the UK Pop Girls rate, where it placed at #4 with an average of 8.676. This isn't really one of my absolute favourite Little Mix songs, but it's still a big bop. To be honest, I'm not really sure what to say about it other than it being a solid song that was enough to get it to day 2 but not enough to get it any further.

---

#Mixers

**1998tweety** (10): Ok I love Little Mix but I don't get why everyone loves this song so much, imo it was the weakest single off of the album. I mean it still slaps and the video is a massive serve but it doesn't have that punch I was looking for. It's a cute post-break-up song that suits the girls' image well so it def has that going for it. I actually prefer the verses over the chorus for once, the beat during the verses is just way too good.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (10): is it the best little mix song? No. Did I love it when I saw them performing it live and thus can't objectively judge it anymore? Yes.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I mean, duh. (x4)

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the best single of their career, period

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.giphy.com/media/l2JIi1fVBP5hMMjiU/giphy.webp

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): bop

**runaway3212** (10): Their best song, energetic and enjoyable.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): i get that some people can find it too Disney-esque but i am not ashamed to stan it

**timothy444** (10): Everyone knows that Little Mix is better than Fifth Harmony but this song objectively proves it. It’s such a solid track and the fact that a break-up song can be so filled with happy and joy says enough about the chemistry these four have with each other.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): rip zaddy

**twat\_brained** (9.7): this was an absolute EXPERIENCE live

**materialqirl** (9.5): THIS IS A SHOUTOUT TO MY EX

**rickikardashian** (9): This about to join the list of the 3 times loser, hilarious. It won the bonus rate of my rate tho, that's something ig

**SFbby** (9): Bombastic chorus

**bulforster** (8.3): Walked so thank u, next could run

**anothertown** (8): “Little Mix verses being better than the choruses comes as no surprise” - Jenny Holzer (1983)

**roxieloxie** (8): she really read zayn for filth on this one

**BlueMetalWave** (7): Cute song.

#Zayn/G.R.L. stans

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): kind of sounds very disney material

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): The only Little Mix song I genuinely love is Wasabi the rest of their stuff is just so immature sounding to me (including this).

**bespectacIed** (7): Hope she ain't faking it like Hadid.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): thank u next

**helpimbeing** (6.5): Basic self-love anthem and all that.

**wavingwolves** (6.5): well, i also hope gigi hadid is getting better sex than perrie was

**bandnitos** (6): stream ugly heart by g.r.l

**vayyiqra** (6): When we rated this the first time, this was my comment lol: Shout Out to My Ex: 4 I have a weird, oddly specific test for pop songs: if the chorus sounds like a cola commercial, I don't like it, no matter what the rest is like. This song is a disappointment after all the hype i've heard about it. I'm bumping it up a bit for being wholesome, which we need more of in our edgy times.

**vhqv1997** (6): thank u, next outsold

**ReallyCreative** (5.7): Nice vocals but do we really need yet another song about how an ex made us who we are? Did we need that? Especially with fairly generic production? I'll pass

**fadedblue09** (2): How I wished was American when this song was being overplayed tbh.

**nightjesus** (2): It sounds really familiar to Ugly Heart by that other girl band that I can’t remember the name of and the Google search bar is too fay away. Either way I don’t like either songs.

Curious was submitted from the 20Gayteen rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 8.958. Curious is decent enough, but like the rest of Hayley's discography there's just something about it that stops it from being incredibly interesting in my opinion. With Hayley's status as Lesbian Jesus I'd love to enjoy her music more, but it falls a bit short for me. I suppose some people agree with me on that, with Curious falling pretty much in the middle of the rate results. It's good, but not good enough to stand tall against the tough competition that is here.

**bandnitos** (10): she doesn't have a super strong voice but when i saw her open for panic at the disco she fucking bodied this also its a banger and my mom likes it so it gets bonus points

**CarlieScion** (10): im gay so im contractually obligated to give this a 10

**DaHumanTorch** (10): lesbian jesus snapped as usual, what else is new

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this song is so infectious to me.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/b5262bfb52bc57e5fe2f1917b97cd39f/tumblr_orrh695riP1rmidv8o1_400.gif

**poppinmmolly** (10): I forgot how much of a BOP this was. It came on while I was listening to the rate at the gym and I popped off a bit!!

**roxieloxie** (10): one of the girls who lives next to me is a lesbian and i remember one time me her and my roommate were in the lounge chilling and i hear her go "im just curious" absentmindedly and i jump in with "is it serious" and the girl turned to my roommate and goes "SEE I TOLD YOU IT WAS A GAY SONG" and im 57% sure thats how my roommate found out i wasnt straight

**twat\_brained** (10): gays won with this song. i NEED to learn the choreo to this

**bulforster** (9.2): Sharp and slick as hell

**1998tweety** (9): A MEGA bop. The chorus is so so good. I do wish it had a bit more of a bridge though.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): any song with a fast-sung section gets a high score from me

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): I could swear I've heard this song seventeen times already, but couldn't recall why. Then, I remembered I did the EDM rate, and half the songs sounded like this.

**ditacarlita** (8): have heard about her a lot on this sub and this is my first time listening to her, really digging this bop and will investigate further, your mission has been accomplished

**ManofOranges** (8): What I said for Up in Flames really applies here. Even though I do realize this was the runner up in its rate I feel like there are other Hayley Kiyoko songs that were more deserving of this spot. However, I do think this song is deserving as I do think it's really catchy and fun.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Playful and fun with some great production. Not a huge fan of Hayley's vocals but it's a fun little bop

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Love the chorus

**runaway3212** (7.5): the production is not great, but the rest is very good.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7.5): what a catchy lil tune

**bespectacIed** (7): greatest rapper of all time

#Lesbophobic

**helpimbeing** (7): A fun song but not that memorable.

**SFbby** (7): Do we ever find out if it was serious?

**vayyiqra** (7): I really like Hayley, and Expectations, but I don't really like this song. It's cute, but she has better. It is catchy though.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Honestly it's kinda unremarkable minus the queerness

**nightjesus** (6): I mean it’s good. The chorus is dope. I do like the video clip. It just falls flat in the verse for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Not a fan of the abrupt pauses before the choruses in this song

**vhqv1997** (6): I just... can't remember anything about this song the moment it ended

**BlueMetalWave** (5): Another song that bored me. I really want to like her but her music is just okay.

**kappyko** (4): this is fine in hindishgt but that bridge into the chorus suxx!

**Misentro** (2): I'm sorry, this is boring.

Honey was submitted from the 2018 Comebacks rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 8.929. Robyn just barely lost the win in the 2018 Comebacks rate, with Mariah taking the crown. I for one was absolutely ecstatic with these results as I am NOT a Robyn fan by any means. She dominated a bit in her two rates from the past year, with her stans having a great attendance rate, but unfortunately for them there's just a few too many people that aren't a fan of her work here in this rate. It falls right near the middle, which I think is apt for a song with many lovers but also quite a few people that think it's just a bit too boring.

---

#Come get your honey

**bbfan132** (11): this song…. whew. i don’t think it’ll win so i’m giving it my 11 because i adore it and want to support the underdog, but this whole album was excellent. stream honey.

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this song is incredible. You know those scenes in movies where after like an hour the main characters finally find out they have feelings for each other and have a steam makeout/sex session and the visuals are the 2 of them dancing in between what appears to be gigantic sheets that somehow have fans blowing into them? That's what this song makes me visualize. A weird feeling of floating but no actual contact.

**Awkward\_King** (10): robyn makes such consistent pop perfection can somebody ask her to stop i'm having trouble breathing

**bandnitos** (10): im just fucking vibing

**bespectacIed** (10): The line "at the heart of some kind of flower // stuck in glitter, strands of saliva" always gives me whiplash. The pure genius, sensuality, and faggotry of that line.

**bulforster** (10): A song worthy of building an whole album around so it can be the climax it deserves to be.

**CarlieScion** (10): queen of gays. also missing u deserved

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Maybe Barry B. Benson had a point.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): gay icon robyn serving as always

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is very hypnotic and enticing to me in a way that not many are.

**nightjesus** (10): I’M COMING FOR MY HONEY ROBYN!

**ReallyCreative** (10): Such a sweet, dripping, refreshing delight of a song. Queen of saving the bees and coupon apps

**runaway3212** (10): Pop princess serving pop perfection once more.

**twat\_brained** (10): I swore to myself I'd stop sleeping on Robyn after the Futuristic Flops rate and that starts with giving Honey the 10 it deserves.

**wavingwolves** (10): i rarely think that songs are sexy but this one... this one really is

**yourfacesucksass** (9.2): strands of MY saliva

**BlueMetalWave** (9): Fantastic song.

**poppinmmolly** (9): I have never heard this before and it's so good

**waluigiest** (9): pulsing Robyn goodness

**dnugs\_** (8): i have it in my spotify library and never really choose to listen to it but i’m never mad when it comes on

**timothy444** (8): That bassline gave my ear an orgasm.

**untutorable** (8): always makes me feel my oats

**vhqv1997** (8): An awesome synthpop song that is both very seductive and emotional. I love some of the little glitches near the end of the song.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): for the first thirty seconds I was like this is not gonna be good. But now I kinda like it

#Lambs

**vayyiqra** (8): I want to really like this song, because I like Robyn, and this song and whole album is really smooth and pleasant, but it doesn't bring me back much. It definitely is pretty and has a nice groove though.

**helpimbeing** (6): Don't really get the hype for this. The production is nice but it's BORING.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I feel like it’s just very one note even if it’s sounds interesting.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): https://media1.tenor.com/images/0cb1bec3f585a8e15f542bc3ec39a73e/tenor.gif

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6): ok popheads raves about this but i think it's kind of boring, srry

**J\_Toe** (5): still do not understand what there is to like about Robyn's music.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): I kept expecting this song to go somewhere but It just didn’t

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): This sounds like music that plays in the background in one of those “try not to be satisfied” youtube videos

**ditacarlita** (4): i don't want to hear her music anymore

Treasure was voted in from the 2010s Ultimate Male rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.228. My personal philosophy for choosing All Stars songs from the rates I've hosted is to pick songs that appeal to a wider demographic than just the niche that the rate in question fulfills - and not to drag the hosts of the 2010s Ultimate Male rate for the two songs they ended up submitting, but Bruno definitely has a wider appeal than Justin and Ed. As such, I was really hoping either this or Locked Out Of Heaven got voted in, and Treasure managed to do just that! It just barely misses the top half unfortunately, but still, given the decimation of all the men in the earlier parts of the rate, it did decently enough. I'm hoping someday we can rate 24k Magic!

---

#Treasure, that's what this song is!

**alwayswords** (10): this song just makes me want to dance i love it :twerkin:

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): This is fucking iconic. You can't reject the melody, it's infectious.

**fadedblue09** (10): Bruno’s GOAT song tbh.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): KING

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/8e5d0bab723e53ec85376019a90a8326/5c97962c84f0c6b2-47/s540x810/7c7ef0c28c683f771a5b31ac8fc386ac29fff4df.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Locked Out of Heaven deserved better

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is PEAK bruno mars, sexy, fun and retro vibes.

**rickikardashian** (10): Bruno might be the result of recycling the best aspects of other artists to create his own music, which isn't really the most creative thing, but aye, recycling's always good

**skargardin** (10): Bruno comeback when

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): A treasure indeed!

**timothy444** (10): The retro 80's inspired stylistic choice is amazing and the very beginning intro is the cherry on the top that sets the energetic mood of this classic.

**twat\_brained** (10): One of a few 11s I'd previously given which have ended up here. The competition here is so stiff though that I can't be certain it'll even make the top 5.

**1998tweety** (9.5): So funky and groovy, my brother was the treasurer at my high school and the rest of the student council was trying to convince him to sing this song in front of the entire student body. He declined.

**bulforster** (9.4): Huge bop, a lil too cutesy to be a 10 though.

**anothertown** (9): the immediate predecessor of uptown funk/24k magic, and better than both of them by being shorter and more tightly produced

**kwcty6888** (9): song for all the bby squirrels out there

**wavingwolves** (9): this makes me happy

**yourfacesucksass** (8.9): I feel so Vegas when I hear this

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.5): funky, i like it

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): People will hate Bruno but this sound works so well for him. He has better songs for sure but I really like this track

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i'm sorry did i hear that right? lemme adjust my hearing aid and listen again...i'm shook by that opening line, i don't think i have ever heard this song outside of the radio so it never included that part

**nightjesus** (8): mods please insert link here of that vine where it’s the two spidermans on top of each other and they slap each other’s bootys to the intro. Pls.

**SFbby** (8): Rated a point higher for the intro

**waluigiest** (8): funky and sparkly and sweet this is nice

**bandnitos** (7): it got like four points just for the baby squirrel line

**bespectacIed** (7): Earth Wind and Fire tribute act

**BlueMetalWave** (7): Really fun, good track.

**runaway3212** (7): a bit repetitive, but the base line makes it so that the song is still pretty awesome.

#MELODRAMA WAS ROBBED

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is fun, and I like nu-disco, but it doesn't have much substance. Iit doesn't matter though because this is going out early because Bruno Mars bad because he won over 1989. Oh well.

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): maybe men can make good music too? actually no never mind

**helpimbeing** (6.5): A fun bop but not that interesting.

**materialqirl** (6.5): its bruno mars and this is one of is better songs in my opinion

**\_wailordfan** (6): not the Bruno song that should've been voted back in tbh

**Tolk1en** (6): I have heard this too much on the radio

**vhqv1997** (6): My high school class once went on a trip together and we all stayed in different train cabins for a day during the travel, and at night we decided to party hard on the train and put this song up and danced. I vomitted for an hour in the morning. This song is cool.

**cremeebrulee** (4): this song is lowkey kind of boring

**gannade** (1): bruno mars is so unoriginal

Bad Girls was submitted from the Billboard Songs of the Summer rate, where it placed at #12 with an average of 8.246. Donna Summer is an icon, that's obvious, and this song is also iconic. "Toot toot, beep beep" did THAT! I like this song well enough but I think it could stand to be a bit shorter, and as a whole it's not really as interesting as it could be. Still, it's pretty decent, and many people appreciate the iconicness of it all, so I'm good with it making Day 2 and marking the exact halfway point of the rate.

---

#TOOT TOOT! BEEP BEEP!

**bespectacIed** (10): Dua couldn't do it

**fadedblue09** (10): groovy

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media2.giphy.com/media/5hosrYw837mJxRuXEF/giphy.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): How do you not like this song? I personally just love it so much. After spending a whole semester in a history of pop music class and realizing that we would be starting with the beginning of pop music history like at the 1890s and having to sit through all the music of the 1920s and 30s, getting to the 70s and getting to listen to this song in class was a breath of fresh air and reminded why I took that class in the first place. This song is great.

**materialqirl** (10): donna's best song imo period period

**ReallyCreative** (10): None of your faves would exist without Donna fucking Summer and Bad Girls and y'all are probably going to put so many inferior songs above this OG bop

**skargardin** (10): Yall better not do this dirty

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Beep Beep

**wavingwolves** (10): a fucking anthem!

**runaway3212** (9.5): Donna Summer is an icon for all the right reasons. This song does it all.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Tag yourself, I'm the sad girl.

**CritneySpearz** (9): TOOT TOOT queen of baby noises

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): the og beep beep lyrics charli could never

**untutorable** (8.5): listen to the jeffree star cover because it sure does exist

**bulforster** (8.4): M.I.A. outsold

**1998tweety** (8): Oh wow what a bop, we stan a homophobic queen

**bandnitos** (8): yes ma'am

**BlueMetalWave** (8): Fun track, reminds me of Pose.

**CarlieScion** (8): beep beep by little mix but make it actually good

**DaHumanTorch** (8): toot toot! beep beep!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Beep Beep bitches!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): great vibe just too long and repetitive

**anothertown** (7): I think my mom is having a mid-life crisis at 55 because she bleached her hair ash blonde and listens to nothing but Donna Summer now

**ditacarlita** (7): I really need to have a good hard listen to Donna Summer, I bet she has loads of hidden gems I'm unaware of

#Bad

**helpimbeing** (7): Bland disco bop.

**twat\_brained** (7): M.I.A was right but Donna does not do it as well as she does.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): groovy

**Tolk1en** (5): when does this end omg

**kappyko** (4): maybe im just dead inside

**vayyiqra** (3): Yeah, no. I like disco, but I hate this song. It's not horrible, but it's lyrically so empty, and catchy but goes nowhere. My god, why won't it END. Stream "Bad Girls" by M.I.A. which is an infinitely better song.

**vhqv1997** (1): I hate disco.

Straight Up was voted in from the 80s Dancepop Debuts rate, where it placed at #4 with an average of 9.366. This was one of the songs that received a LOT of votes to get a second chance, so the Paula stans really came in full force! Unfortunately for them, this isn't making it much further than the halfway point, seeing as it's an older song and we hate it there! This is a fun enough bop but I'm good with it getting cut here, personally.

---

#Love me forever

**materialqirl** (11): its what she deserves.

**1998tweety** (10): A MASSIVE and iconic bop. Deserved all the success it got and more.

**bespectacIed** (10): My second winner from its original rate, deserved better.

**CarlieScion** (10): biggest gay bop

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Here's another 11 contender. It's about love and foolishness. If only there were more songs in this rate about that.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i LOVE this song, how have i never heard till now. pop perfection !!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/e2b8ff9270ead9888aaf7814616d259c/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Damn you know I've never really heard of any Paula's music I just knew that she had a lot of hits and then I heard Cold Hearted and was like "this is good" and now I'm hearing this and I have to say Paula really had some great songs I guess I understand why she had so many number ones.

**rickikardashian** (10): I was talking about 80s music with my dad, and I mentioned Paula Abdul, and he did not know her, and I got so offended you would think I was out there in the 80s stanning her ass like no one else did. In reality I found out about her because of Drag Race

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): gimme them MIDI horns, amazing chorus

**anothertown** (8.5): Yes Paula! Tell me!

**bulforster** (8.2): I don't think I'd like this song nearly as much without the Drag Race lipsync.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): more like a straight up bop

**vayyiqra** (8): Madonna outsold in my onion and deserved to do better than she, but this was a good rate and Paula did have one of the best songs with this bop.

**yourfacesucksass** (8): Love Paula but idk why this one pales to Cold Hearted for me

**runaway3212** (7.5): We love clear communication with significant others!

#Madonna stans

**twat\_brained** (7.5): pretty good but not worthy of the #1 it achieved.

**ditacarlita** (7): True Blue's influence is all over this

**bandnitos** (6): did they clip the snare????? gated reverb isn't supposed to sound like this

**nightjesus** (5): Okay. So I’m a sucker for this type of 80’s production. But straight up, Paula Abdul sounds horrible. She sounds flat in areas and really nasally in others. It’s a no from me.

Sweet Nothing was submitted from the EDM/Pop Girl Collabs rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 8.473. This is personally one of my favourite songs that Calvin Harris has done. I love powerhouse vocalists alongside EDM production, and Florence absolutely kills it here. This is one of the songs that I myself submitted, and in hindsight maybe We Found Love would have fared better in this rate, but I felt that it wasn't necessary to have a third Rihanna song in the rate - not to mention the fact that we've rated that song a multitude of times, and currently are once again in the Decade End rate. Nonetheless, I'll always cherish this song as one of the best hits from the EDM boom of the early 2010s, and I'm glad to see it at least make day 2.

---

#STREAM 18 MONTHS!!!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): Mindblowingly good, florence's voice works magic in EDM

**cremeebrulee** (10): nothing but 10s for my queen florence

**ignitethephoenix** (10): EDM perfection.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the best Calvin Harris song (sorry We Found Love)

**ReallyCreative** (10): WHEW. Calvin and Flo work so well together. A depression bop for the AGES.

**roxieloxie** (10): whenever this song came on in 2013 on radio disney i would open up my ipad and start playing temple run 2 for some reason

**SFbby** (10): Give Florence more than your sweet nothings give her your 10s; she deserves it after delivering desperately wailing vocals on this song

**twat\_brained** (10): It's 2020 and I still can't believe Florence hasn't recorded more EDM hits

**worlds-okayest666** (10): you’re giving me sexy oven

**1998tweety** (9.5): Florence's voice isn't the kind you would associate with EDM production but somehow it works.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): easily one of my favorite calvin songs...i played this to death when it was popular. florence's voice really make this song so much better, i love her so much.

**anothertown** (9): YEAH!!!!!!!! YES

**CarlieScion** (9): stan :floh:

**timothy444** (9): It’s quite possibly the one of the most underrated Calvin Harris singles in his discography. It’s interesting to see how the production and instrumentation tries to blend the typical early 2010s EDM sound with Florence Welch’s vocals which are better suited for alternative pop. Regardless, it sorta works here in a way that I didn’t expect it to.

**vhqv1997** (9): A good beat, incredible vocals, awesome songwriting? What's not to like? How about the fact that this song never properly hit a peak because Calvin decided to chop off Florence's belting right before the final chorus? As a hardcore Florence stan, I'm aghasted.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): this song always plays at my gym and gets me through the treadmill

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): i came for florence with a bass drop

**BlueMetalWave** (8): fantastic track.

**ditacarlita** (8): haven't really paid attention to this song beyond the radio but now that I play it... Damn it's good

**gannade** (8): snorence snapped

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://media1.tenor.com/images/c050450f78956a2d691547d098ac9acd/tenor.gif

**nightjesus** (8): I didn’t fully appreciate this song when it first came out. But it goes off. I don’t know if I’m just really nostalgic for those days or if I’m really starting to dig Calvin Harris.

**skargardin** (8): Go off queen

**slimboyfriend** (8): Once in awhile Calvin Harris emerges from his sweaty bro-EDM gym to deliver a true banger and thank god he didn't mess up this Florence song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Florence’s voice is so powerful that it can elevate even a mediocre edm song into something great

**waluigiest** (8): this Calvin Harris era was iconic!

**helpimbeing** (7.5): A strange combination, but a nice one, to be sure.

#edm can choke

**bandnitos** (7): the drop kinda ruins it just sounds like boopboopboopboopboop florence served tho

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): This is... a bit generic, I find. That drop also is far from the best. Like, Japan-Ireland far.

**poppinmmolly** (7): this is alright

**vayyiqra** (7): I had no idea this song existed, and it's a bizarre combination of two totally different artists who I both like, and I'm not sure it completely works but I can vibe to it.

**alwayswords** (6.7): would’ve been better without calvin

**dnugs\_** (6): usually i love florences voice but this track didn’t do it for me... just not catchy

**fishingfor8** (6): I respect the hell out of Calvin Harris's production, but this song isn't his best work though

**runaway3212** (6): A song I really want to like, but ends up falling a bit flat.

**bulforster** (4.5): I love Florence, especially her voice, but the production here is doing way too much and not giving her enough space so it feels like it's competing with her for attention. The drops are also way too energetic so they really undercut the emotion she tries to build to in the chorus.

**Misentro** (4): I still have trouble believing there's an EDM song with Florence Welch. It's about as good as anyone could hope for.

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Friendly reminder that powerhouse vocalists and EDM do NOT mix well

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (2): I hate it

Starships was submitted from the 2012 Ultimate rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 8.845. In the 2012 rate, Starships and Die Young tied for #2 with the exact same average, leaving C'Mon as the winner. As the host of that rate, I thought it would be fun to submit both Starships and Die Young to break the tie, and, well, I'm really not surprised at all with the results of that. Starships gets the axe first, seeing as the abrasive EDM drop has NOT aged well at all for a lot of people. Unfortunate, as this is an enormous bop, but again, not surprising.

---

#Ninki Minjaj

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, I remember all the blonde skinny white girls getting their life from it in middle school.

**BlueMetalWave** (10): One of my favorite Nicki tracks.

**CarlieScion** (10): STARSHIPS WE'RE MEANT TO FLYYYYYY

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): HOT TAKE INCOMING: I kinda miss this. I love her going deeper in rapping, but I also LOVED the pop stuff she did. Stream Super Bass.

**CritneySpearz** (10): OMG I ALWAYS THOUGHT SHE SAID “My name is Nicki, you can call me Nicki” I-

**DaHumanTorch** (10): if any of ya'll give this lower than a 8, i will personally get your account banned from reddit. one of the most iconic songs of the decade

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/f49cb87f980b28878b312dd36fc5ada0/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Shoutout to Pitch Perfect

**materialqirl** (10): its nicki duh

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): twinkle twinkle little star motherfuckas

**rickikardashian** (10): ninki minjaj

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): this song never fails to GO OFF

**twat\_brained** (10): this may just be the best pop song to come out of 2012

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): the cheering added in the last chorus never fails to get my hyped

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): The epitome of Nicki pop, holy grail of Hawaii music videos

**bespectacIed** (9): Starships x Johann Pachelbel - Canon in D remix outsold. But I truly love this mindless, popnika anthem.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the very first rap song i remember liking

**timothy444** (9): The only good Nicki Minaj song

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): widow killed it on drag race

**bulforster** (8.2): An iconic club banger, but not something I really want to listen to outside of that context because the drops with the looped chants are pretty obnoxious.

**bandnitos** (8): ninki minaj

**SFbby** (8): Nicki Minaj recognizes the existence of aliens

**untutorable** (8): we higher than any other

**vayyiqra** (8): BEACH BEACH LET'S GO TO THE BEACH is what I believe the Allied high command said before planning the invasion of Normandy in 1944. Okay shitposting aside, this is a great song, a classic, but I have never liked the random electro drop and thought the song could do without it. It's still a banger though, that is scientifically demonstrated.

**waluigiest** (8): This song directly led to Lil Nas X. Thank you “fuck who you want and fuck who you like twinkle twinkle little star” for Old Town Road

**Compulsively\_Epic** (7.5): classic

**anothertown** (7): Ima blow all my money and don’t give two shits,.. i felt that

#Nicki was right to disown this song

**helpimbeing** (8): Iconic but also the drop is so annoying.

**kwcty6888** (7.5): honestly only enjoyable for nostalgia

**ditacarlita** (7): it would be okay if it wasn't that hideous post chorus breakdown that sounds like it belongs in a game arcade.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Nicki was right when she said she didn’t like this song. It’s personally overrated for me for sure.

**roxieloxie** (7): i was not a cool kid when this song came out so this just reminds of being isolated from my classmates in 6th grade cause i had no friends

**runaway3212** (7): A great enjoyable song, but Nicki sounds a bit bored.

**dnugs\_** (6.5): it was good at the time but like i can’t remember the last time i listened and don’t think i could sit thru it’s entirety without zoning out

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): Fun but nonsensical, outside the memes there really isn't a lot to love about this song, production is fine I guess

**vhqv1997** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nRTBM4UwnBs

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): drunk me loves this song. Sober me not so much

**gannade** (3): nicki snappt for the first 2 lines and then the rest of the song is overproduced MESS. lets go to the beach, beach will always be iconic tho

**wavingwolves** (3): sorry but i never forgave this song for having one of the most annoying chorus ever

**fadedblue09** (1): Sorry popheads, but I am NOT nostalgic for the bombastic EDM-driven pop of the Early 2010’s and I hope it rests in peace forever, especially this song as it exemplifies many of its worst clichés (that breakdown is super awful back then and not any different now tbh). Maybe if Pound the Alarm was here instead, I would’ve been nicer?

**nightjesus** (0): Look I usually really love most Nicki Minaj songs. But this. This is an atrocity to her talent. I hate it so much. It’s so bad. I was so disappointed when this was released. WHAT IS THAT ENDING WHAT IS THAT SOUND IN THE BACK GROUND. THAT SOUNDS HORRIFIC. Thankfully this song is just a little blip in her impressive discography but my god.

Geyser was voted in from the NPR-Core rate, where it placed at #6 with an average of 8.927. The NPR-Core rate stans really came in full force during the wildcard voting, with three songs from the original rate getting voted in. Among them is Geyser, which is also the first to fall. The buildup from basically nothing to some full-force guitar work is truly a treat for the ears, and it's definitely easy to see the appeal of this song. Personally I'm not a huge Mitski fan and this song is a bit too short for my liking but it's still decent, though I think this is a fair spot for it to get the axe. Nobody definitely has more universal appeal though, so it's not over for you Mitski stans out there!

---

#Indie hoes

**bulforster** (11): Mitski packs so much into this song and all of it is so expressive. From the tension and anticipation of the first half to the bombast of the second, every part fits together amazingly: from the shuddering bass that sneaks in under the smothering opening organ, to the jumpscare glitch, to the theatrical as hell electric guitar line, to the expectant then hyperactive strings and the brass that backs them up, to the bright synth hits that signal the arrival of the titular geyser and then crest the wave of noise in the outro, to the rolling percussion and the piano run that helps lead the instrumental into its final section, to her surprisingly ominous singing about selfless devotion. I can’t think of a more visceral 2.5 minute musical journey. I really love this song.

**slimboyfriend** (11): Against all odds I'm standing with my indie woman with emotions

**vhqv1997** (11): The way this song builds ever so slowly only to climax into a gigantic waterfall of emotion. God, just too fitting a title, isn't it?

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely gorgeous song; I adore songs with unconventional structures and Geyser pulls it off amazingly well. The way the song erupts halfway through like a geyser is genius and elevates the song to a whole new level.

**bandnitos** (10): the fact that this made me start crying

**bespectacIed** (10): A song title that describes how the song itself will progress. Brilliant lead single from a brilliant album.

**CarlieScion** (10): hauntingly beautiful

**DaHumanTorch** (10): the beginning startled me. insert mariah carey saying that was a classic

**fadedblue09** (10): My complaint is why is it too short? I do love the buildup and instrumental though. Maybe I should check more of her music soon.

**helpimbeing** (10): Brief but powerful.

**kappyko** (10): yes!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): /r/popheads when Charli releases a five minute song filled with beeps boops clangs and metal screeches: MY ELEVEN HAS ARRIVED LADIES! MOZART FOUND WISHING! THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION COULD NEVER! /r/popheads when Mitski puts a half-second staticy distortion in a song: the TRAUMA sis, the absolute trauma, get this ugly r@t out of here!!

**roxieloxie** (10): this is a strong 11 contender. I thank this rate so much for introducing me to mitski because i have fallen in love with her album and this song specifically. I haven't been able to stop listening to it at all.

**waluigiest** (10): I n*t at the glitch. This is a gorgeous, well-constructed song I’m in awe

**wavingwolves** (10): a PERFECT song. we fucking love mitski!

**Awkward\_King** (9): the song feels like im inside a geyser and it's screaming at me but like rly pretty

**ditacarlita** (9): wow my ears were not expecting this, I need to hear more of her stuff!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://66.media.tumblr.com/c3aaa32e72feb29b89f8cdacaf3ae90b/df63440ef8695847-b8/s640x960/a84d3f2ea3cecbd9af2b3430bc55f8ca991be9a4.gif

**SFbby** (9): This song bubbles up like a geyser and Mitski's vocal delivery fuels the rush of it

**runaway3212** (8.5): heavenly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): The only time when a jumpscare actually improves your listening experience

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): You guys really went ahead and put FIVE NPR-Core songs in this rate for them all to lose again, huh?

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): this was so relaxing

#Scalded

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this feels like it's missing a whole minute

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): It’s one of her better songs but I just don’t get Mitski I’m sorry.

**twat\_brained** (7): this one's a bit of a mishmash but I imagine it sounds very cathartic live

**poppinmmolly** (5): I really didn't like this at all I'm sorry

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): cant say I ever listened to Mitski before. Can't say I particularly want to again. It's not bad just not really my taste

**BlueMetalWave** (4): Wasn't really it for me.

**fishingfor8** (4): if i wanted too i could've listened to a lana reject and then switch to some emo 2000s song that no one likes anymore and gotten the same affect

**timothy444** (4): Overrated

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah, I'm a Mitski anti. I make no apologies for who I am. :pensive: Mitski frustrates me because I want to like her, but no matter how much I listen to her, I just ... don't. This song starts out being cool and dramatic, but it ends up being underwhelming and kind of boring. It's too short, and it leaves no impact on me. I tried, Mitski, I really did.

**nightjesus** (3): It’s like Lana Del Ray for me. I just can’t get into it.

**CritneySpearz** (2): I really just can’t get into Mitski like I wish I could ☹

Back To December was voted in from the Early 10s Country Classics rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 8.724. Taylor ended up winning the country rate with Enchanted, but this was her second highest song and the highest single from Speak Now. It's not really my absolute favourite from her, but it's still a really good song and is consistently cited for being very mature lyrically (something Taylor can't always relate to having oop). 

---

#Swifties

**1998tweety** (10): This song will always hold a special part in my heart cause it's the one that converted me to a big stan. I remember posting all the lyrics on my Facebook page (yes I posted the chorus several times too) and the next people asked me why I did that lmao. Yeah, I was that kid.

**bandnitos** (10): throwback to when i got the speak now target edition CD for my eighth birthday and within 2 hours i shattered the case

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Yeah, acoustic version outsold, but we got what we got.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of taylor's best song imo, especially lyrically. speak now is always in red's shadow and it must end!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/7190e4b3d733a804502f3efb01e1825b/tenor.gif

**rickikardashian** (10): Swifties rose up, do my rate in April

**runaway3212** (10): Taylor at her best. She's being sincere without faking any emotion and the songwriting is on point.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9.8): speak now is lowkey still the best taylor swift album

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Speak Now literally has a ton of solid songs, and y’all chose this? How basic and predictable. But whatever, it’s a track from her best album, so….

**materialqirl** (9.5): must i explain

**bespectacIed** (9): Country taylor is the bane of my swiftie existence but this one is iconic and actually good

**BlueMetalWave** (9): Great ballad with great lyrics.

**waluigiest** (9): This album is a great showcase of how nuts Taylor Swift’s career has been. Like for real - how was she writing songs like this as a teenager???? That’s so bonkers. Stream Miss Americana on Netflix

**bulforster** (8): I don't know if this makes me like it more or less but this really sounds like Sims background music.

**ditacarlita** (8): I haven't ventured into Taylor's country albums, I might give them a go soon.

**helpimbeing** (8): Used to love this a lot, it's still sweet.

**nightjesus** (8): I loved Speak Now. It’s probably my favourite Taylor Album. I love her song writing in Back to December. It’s not one I listen to often though I’m not gonna lie.

**twat\_brained** (8): I'm having an existential crisis because Taylor wrote and co-produced this whole album by herself when she was 20, and I also realize just how much of a precursor this is to All Too Well. Go Taylor!

#Winter depression

**dnugs\_** (7): a classic but nothing crazy

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): i think i ruined this song for myself by pining over my year 9 crush with it a decade ago but it's still a gorgeous song

**vayyiqra** (6): No thanks, I would rather go forward to March and skip my yearly winter depression, and I would also rather avoid ballads with acoustic guitars - wait did she just say "and in the cocaine"?? lol of course she didn't it's Taylor and that makes no sense.

**vhqv1997** (6): The spiciest of takes: Sad Beautiful Tragic > Last Kiss > Tim McGraw > Forever & Always (Piano) > Treacherous > Teardrops On My Guitar > All Too Well > State of Grace (accoustic) > Dear John > Back To December > White Horse

**wavingwolves** (6): idk what one of the worst songs from taylor's best album is doing here

**kappyko** (5): cute!

**ReallyCreative** (4): Yasss we love generic love songs that drag on forever!

**roxieloxie** (4): im kinda balladphobic sorry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): nothing happens in this

**alwayswords** (3): boring

**anothertown** (2): I can't do this

Blown Away was submitted from the Early 10s Country Classics rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.126. Carrie was INCREDIBLY close to stopping Taylor from getting a rate win YET AGAIN, but us Swifties banded together to give our 11s to Enchanted, what I think is the best song on Speak Now. Despite that, Blown Away is still a fantastic song - the dramatics of it all are conveyed so brilliantly in the plucky strings and Carrie's powerful vocals. I would have been fine with this doing even better and making it to day 3, but I'll take what I can get with its placement in the top half.

---

#FUCK enchanted

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): SO CLOSE to being my 11. This is honestly fucking iconic.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): SHATTEREVERYWINDOWTILLITSALLBLOWNAWAYYYYYYYYYYYEVERYBRICKEVERYBOARDEVERYSLAMMINGDOORBLOWNAWAYYYYYYYYY..one of the best country songs every created tbh and was definitely an 11 contender for me

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Still mad this didn’t win and Enchanted won because Swifties probably banded together to give one song all their 11’s

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://pics.me.me/the-power-that-that-has-the-intelligence-that-that-has-42465219.png

**nightjesus** (10): This song is so dark and so haunting. Her vocals her beautiful. I also just have fascination with tornadoes. All round banger.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): Carrie really did that with this song

**vhqv1997** (10): Carrie's best song, people. I know she has stronger albums that aren't bloated with fillers, but she hasn't been able to write a song as good as this. The stormy atmosphere, the destructive vocals, the bleak lyricisms, everything came together to build up one of the most gobsmacking country songs of the last decade.

**materialqirl** (9.5): tbh this song is what got me into music LOL-

**helpimbeing** (9): A modern epic.

**waluigiest** (9): MAGNIFICENT CHORUS

**bespectacIed** (8): i abhor country with every fibre of my being but Carrie Underwood is such a serve. She gets a pass for me

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The vocal production is a bit...off? Otherwise it’s fine.

**ReallyCreative** (7.1): It's pretty good but it just doesn't hold up to the competition in this rate

**anothertown** (7): There’s not enough rain in Oklahoma to wash the sins out of that house…. damn bitch!!!

**BlueMetalWave** (7): Good song.

**twat\_brained** (7): yeehaw queen snapped

**vayyiqra** (6): Yes this is a very dramatic and dark song and one of the few country songs I will admit to liking although (and it's barely a country song anyway) although I'm not sure I am comfortable with the moral of it being "it's okay to kill people if they're abusers" although it's understandable especially because it's a kid but this is maybe getting kind of deep so I will stop here

#blow me away from this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): why does this sound like a dollar store version of ready to go by patd

**bandnitos** (5): did glee cover this i feel like they did but im too lazy to look it up

Nobody was submitted from the NPR-Core rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.309. Mitski isn't really for me, but the general popheads consensus seems to like her quite a bit - or, at least this song in particular. It very nearly won its original rate, and I thought it truly had a shot in this one... only for it to fall flat and not even make day 3. I'm okay with it personally, but I can see this cut being a bit controversial. The main problem I think is that there's a good amount of people that aren't here for the repetitiveness and for Mitski's general style. Sorry to her stans, but Janelle and Kacey will carry on the NPR-core torch... and maybe snatch the win?

---

#I just need someone to kiss

**\_wailordfan** (11): I missed this rate when it came around last year and was so upset that I didn't get to rate Mitski, so now I'm gonna make sure Mitski gets her deserved 11

**ReallyCreative** (11): A legendary moment for music, reinventing the concept of a depression bop, truly no experience like drunkenly writhing to the beat while crying on the floor

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This was the runner up in my rate. It was at the top for the longest time. But slowly and surely, Make Me Feel (a very good song!) chipped into it's lead to take top position. But I still love Nobody. The chorus is a single word, but still conveys so many different emotions. And the rest of the songwriting is relatable as hell. "Give me one good honest kiss and I'll be alright..." Girl, same.

**waluigiest** (11): This was my 11 in easily my favorite rate last year. My comment then was some sarcastic bit about being lonely and using dating apps, but even when that scenario is less relatable to me the song is completely ubiquitous. It’s universal in its anxiety filled portrayal of isolation, and it’s floaty and gorgeous as it does it.

**anothertown** (10): I listened to this song so much in 2019 that it is encoded into my DNA basically… Best key change since Love On Top and proof that you can express wanting one more movie kiss well into your late 20s.

**Awkward\_King** (10): https://youtu.be/G30AtDEc5Do?t=231

**bandnitos** (10): this hit way too close to home like ms mitski please get your foot off my neck

**bespectacIed** (10): one of the best songs of all time. There's no song released in existence that connects to me more than Nobody. Spare one movie kiss sir please, just a crumb of movie kiss.

**bulforster** (10): Sometimes I think it's overrated, but then I actually listen to it again.

**CarlieScion** (10): NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY

**DaHumanTorch** (10): literally who dislikes this song? nobody nobody nobody nobody nobody nooobody noobody

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/5d1efd3ea948c712f562aced0edd2f4c/tenor.gif

**mudkip1** (10): we're spiraling 🤭

**rickikardashian** (10): mood

**roxieloxie** (10): Mitski gets it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I relate to this song far too much and it worries me

**twat\_brained** (10): oh wow look it's all the people who have ever loved me! :emofish:

**wavingwolves** (10): honestly this is what i call real christmas music

**zadooi** (10): I’ll never forgive the popheads community for not letting this song into the top 10 of the top 100 songs of 2018.

**dnugs\_** (9.7): one of my most played songs this summer and definitely one of my favorite songs to sing my heart out to really beautiful

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song always personally attacks me and I hate that, but it is very good.

**untutorable** (9.5): unparalleled lyricism

**vhqv1997** (9.5): One of my friends hated this song and called it "creepy", another loved it and called it "longingly emotional", and I was like "you're both wrong, this song is just horny"

**1998tweety** (9): I'm gonna be honest, you guys overrated this song just a little bit. There are at least 2 songs on the album better than this. With that being said though, it's still great and the lyrics are so so relatable and sad and depressing and amazing.

**BlueMetalWave** (9): Such a great surprise! I never listened to her before.

**kappyko** (9): this shouldnt win but it sure is fun!

**materialqirl** (9): queen of those roblox falling videos

**SFbby** (9): She says the same word 50 times and its still sounds unique with each illeration

**fadedblue09** (8): Love the instrumental! Not familiar with her music but I thought Geyser was better.

#Roblox avatar falling while “Nobody by Mitski” is playing.

**helpimbeing** (8.5): A bop but it feels like it's missing something.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): this song is much better set to the meme of the roblox girl falling off a mountain https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXUSb1dnZVQ

**runaway3212** (6.5): repetative, but still kinda fun.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (5.5): this song is just kind of.... there

**timothy444** (5): Yawn

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4): Mitski just... isn't for me. This feels like a radio remix. Not in the way where it's remade to make the song more danceable, but in the way where it sounds like they took the performance from a piano ballad and tossed a dance beat on top. I like them both separately, but together it feels jarring.

**CritneySpearz** (4): Decent I suppose…

**poppinmmolly** (4): My sister u/ayemies LOVES this song but I just can't get into it sorry

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (3): it's just so repetitive

**ManofOranges** (3): Someone please explain this song to me. Please someone tell me why everybody likes it so much I just don't see the appeal literally at all like I just don't get it. I feel like somewhere along the line when this came out everybody just came to the consensus that this song is amazing. I guess I just missed that boat then?

**nightjesus** (3): Oh god I find it so boring.

**vayyiqra** (1): [Warning: controversial hot take ahead] I never liked this song much, but the circlejerk around it has made me outright hate it. I'm kind of baffled why everyone loved this album so much when I thought it was just okay, and why they think this song in particular is some kind of transcendent experience when it's at best, kind of annoying. It starts off okay, and I kind of like the instrumental track, but by the end it all blurs together into an infuriating NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY NOBODY yeah we GET it Mitski you're sad

Talking Body was submitted from the Alternative Electropop Queens rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 9.292. This is absolute pop perfection. If it were up to me, this would have been Tove's huge top 3 hit and not Habits... but hey, at least this was still at a hit at all! The bombastic electropop of this song propelled it to a great showing in its original rate, but Miss Lo is unfortunately not for everyone, seeing as its just barely missing Day 3. Definitely very sad - I love Tove and this is one of my favourite songs from her. I would have loved for it to do better, but oh well.

---

#We fuck for life!

**alwayswords** (10): a vine edit anthem

**CarlieScion** (10): the FEELING OF YOUR SKIN LOCKED IN MY HEAD

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): The strongest Gaga song in this rate. (note: this joke only works if Paparazzi is already out, which I hope is the reality we live in.)

**cremeebrulee** (10): strong contender for my 11 but I didn't think it would get too far in this rate :/

**DaHumanTorch** (10): maybe a hot take but talking body >>> habits

**ditacarlita** (10): I was obsessed with this song and it's album for ages! It's sensual, romantic, primal and sexual flashes tits

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Habits and Talking Body was such a perfect one two punch of singles from Tove Lo.

**kappyko** (10): literally should have won and habits should have choked

**ManofOranges** (10): I didn't think this song would make it as far as it did in its orginal rate. I didn't think it was THAT good but over time I have slowly warmed up to it and definitely like it a lot more.

**materialqirl** (10): period.

**nightjesus** (10): Tove Lo doesn’t have enough appreciation. Queen of the Clouds was a pretty good album and one I didn’t expect to like. But this and We Got Love were big standouts for me.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): tove lo is unapologetically sexual in the best possible way and i am here for it

**ReallyCreative** (10): Tove Lo is one of those artists that surprises me whenever I hear her. She doesn't seem like she'd be my type but she just really sells the songs, and generally has really great production to back it up. This song is no exception.

**rickikardashian** (10): this song had been a victim to do many shitty acoustic covers, it hurts me

**timothy444** (10): A strangely sexual song with a modest chill beat. This is definitely not the sort of music I would listen to but it's hypnotising enough to drag you into its lure. One of Tove Lo's best for sure. It's a shame the song flopped everywhere considering how much of a bop this is!

**twat\_brained** (10): I am SO pumped to hear this live the night after I'm rating this! So too when Tove comes to town for the festival I'm hopefully interviewing one of the musicians at. I can only hope to talk body with someone someday the way Tove is here

**vayyiqra** (10): I love Queen of the Clouds and will defend it, and this is one of the best songs on it. Maybe hot take: this is just as good a song as "Habits", or even better, and deserved to be a bigger hit. The "day drunk into the night" hook is so good and the synth countermelody in the prechorus is just bliss. How can a song this horny be so beautiful? :pensive:

**ImADudeDuh** (9.9): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/WealthyImperfectHummingbird-size_restricted.gif

**1998tweety** (9): Sexual bop

**BlueMetalWave** (9): One of her best tracks.

**SFbby** (9): Tove Lo said ya'll have perfect bodies and should have fun with them

**Awkward\_King** (8): it's just such an infectious pop song, tove really knows how to write and produce a damn catchy chorus

**bandnitos** (8): look how she ate that

**Misentro** (8): Only Tove Lo could pull this song off.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): i forgot how much i like this song woops

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): I like this better than Habits tbh

**waluigiest** (8): Okay yes I love this hook

#Sunshine Kitty >

**yourfacesucksass** (8.6): even if it is kinda basic

**poppinmmolly** (8): also kind of a shrinker!

**helpimbeing** (7): The production is iffy but it's a fun song.

**runaway3212** (6.5): One of my least favourites by Tove Lo

**bulforster** (5.8): I feel like I should like this song a lot more than I do but for a song about sex it sounds weirdly sterile.

**dnugs\_** (5): eh

**fadedblue09** (5): Uhh...

**vhqv1997** (5): Bruh don't get me wrong this song is a banger, but there's also nothing special about it. I like songs with a bit more "oomph" in it, and this song is just short of it.

Somebody Else was submitted from the Mid 2010s Synthy Pop Rock rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 9.033. Somebody Else is a 5 minute long emotional journey, where you can truly hear the pain in both the vocal delivery and the production. It's easy to see why this got five 11s here, but it's also easy to see why it just barely falls short of making the third and final day, with it being just a bit too drawn out and uninteresting for some people. I personally was very happy with The Sound getting the win from this rate - it was my 11 - but I can see why people were expecting this to take the crown. Unfortunately, it's the final cut for today.

#Sad girls that think they're "indie" but really they're just the 1975 stans

**wavingwolves** (11): i can't believe i'm giving my 11 to this but, honestly, there's nothing quite like listening to a song for the first time and feeling seen and understood. yes, in 2016, this song was important to me because i was a very shitty person with a lot of confusing feelings and this described my situation in a way that i found very accepting. and, of course, the actual music fucking ROCKS. this song is absolutely perfection in every sense of the word, it takes my breath away how well crafted it is.

**worlds-okayest666** (11): Aged like FINE WINE. The 1975 are very hit-or-miss but this song is stunning. A synth-pop masterpiece methinks...

**1998tweety** (10): Such a good song. I love the lo-fi version where you're listening to it through the walls while crying in the bathroom at your highschool prom.

**bandnitos** (10): here come the tears

**bespectacIed** (10): Still hate that The Sound beat this, this is a textbook "perfect" song

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Fantastic song, I loved this one and Verité's version.

**CarlieScion** (10): YES.

**nightjesus** (10): If The Veronicas weren’t on this list, this would by my 11. This has to be one of the most beautiful songs released. It’s defiantly one of my favourite songs of all time. It’s one of those songs that just moves me to the core.

**rickikardashian** (10): thank god I have yet to have a breakup bad enough that I destroy this song to me listening to it over 10 times a day while drinking vodka and eating ice cream, it'll happen eventually tho

**SFbby** (10): F*ck love, get money; the synthpops are beautiful and the lyrics are sas

**fadedblue09** (9.7): Never cared for them, but I’m digging this one.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): LOVE the 1975, i need to go and stream their discography its been too long

**ditacarlita** (9): wow I really like this. Sold.

**helpimbeing** (9): A big mood.

**materialqirl** (9): i love the 1975 so

**ReallyCreative** (9): solid from start to finish, love the production, and I'm a sucker for sad synthy bops

**timothy444** (9): I don't listen to The 1975 but this was relaxing and soothing to chill to.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://media1.tenor.com/images/6c5f3a53057472f80f1de27ebb9e85e6/tenor.gif

**twat\_brained** (8): I've never really been much of a "bands" person since 1D went on hiatus, I ought to give these lads a chance.

**vayyiqra** (8): Idk if these lyrics are a bit incel-ish but it's such a pretty song with such a good atmosphere I am going to ignore that question and just vibe to it

**waluigiest** (8): okay honestly a relaxed nice bop

#LONG

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): this is just a little too long

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): i've never really gotten the major love for this song, it's alright but not a super standout from the album imo

**vhqv1997** (7.5): The 1975 is vastly overrated and underrated at the same time, I don't know why. I've always thought they were a decently good band that made pretty creative music with some nice hard-hitting lyrics, but I think that's mostly where their appeal ends. This track is a good example of that, it's cool, but it's also just cool and that's all. I do wonder if they could make something truly great and legendary though, it's truly a toss-up with them.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): In conclusion, stream The Sound.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I really like the synth pop sound of this song, but lyrics and vocals are just not for me

**anothertown** (6.5): This could have been 2mins30sec shorter

**dnugs\_** (6): cool vibes but like kinda boring

**Misentro** (5): Not quite interesting enough for how slow it is.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): I know I listened to the album yet I don't have the slightest memory of this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): im just gonna say fuck the 1975 and move on
