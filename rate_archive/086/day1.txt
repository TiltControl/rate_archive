Closer was voted in from the EDM/Pop Girl Collabs rate, where it placed at #24 with an average of 7.357. And so, Closer is the first to fall in this rate. Truly a tragedy if you ask me, as I 100% unironically love this song. But irony probably has something to do with the fact that it's here at all, seeing as it's somewhat of a meme here on the subreddit and in the rating community. It's not a surprise that it's the first out, given that it's the only song out of the 60 that didn't make Day 3 of its original rate. It's boasting a massive controversy score, which speaks to the divided opinions of this song. Be sure to participate in the Billboard Decade End rate and give this your 10s! Also be sure to vote it in to All Stars 4 next December so we can rate it for a fifth time!

#WE AIN'T EVER GETTING OLDER

**CarlieScion** (11): i am contractually obligated to give halsey an 11 in every rate she's in. i am sorry.

**roxieloxie** (11): ~~so i told u/NapsAndNetflix that i'd give closer my 11 in [all stars](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ehezzq/disney_animated_classics_rate_reveal_3_how_far/fcj4exo/) and im partially terrified to see what will happen if i dont follow through~~ But also i have a genuine love for this song. I didnt listen to the radio in 2017 so i pretty much missed all the closer hype of that summer so when i first heard it, i heard it for it being an actual good song. plus i saw TCS with 5sos on the WWJ tour in october and screaming the chorus of closer with my arm wrapped around my friend has been one of my favorite college memories

**TiltControls** (11): One of the best songs of the 2010's don't @ me

**zadooi** (11): This score is completely unironic. I’ve experienced nothing talked about in this song, but it manages to make me feel so nostalgic for those experiences. Listening to this song makes me feel like a normie and it’s powerful. Like I’m the kind of person that will look back at my college years with fondness and not despair. This song screams “college was the best time of my life” and there is an underlying sadness to that. I’m an absolute slut for songs that are a bit sadder under the surface even if it's just through my interpretation.

**1998tweety** (10): This song is gonna be snubbed so hard and I already know it. You guys need to not let overplay affect your overall opinion of a song. This song is such a summer song and is so nostalgic and so fun but at the same time bittersweet. The one thing I'm a bit lukewarm on is some of Halsey's weird lines but other than that its a super catchy fun song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): You're telling me Closer by The Chainsmokers, Closer by The Chainsmokers was number third in voting? I COULD believe it.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/fa9bb0a6a226695f9c82fdc97e604f03/tumblr_inline_p12qxy5Vct1r0rrd4_500.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Fucking banger yall better pay the chainsmokers the respect they deserve. You can say that you don't like this song all you want but you have to admit it is iconic.

**poppinmmolly** (10): haters stay pressed!!!

**rickikardashian** (10): Is Closer actually a perfect song? A song so good it gets a perfect score? No, in fact I'll probably give it like a 6 when we rate it next month, but All Stars seasons are all about the narrative, redemption, victory, and Closer got way more shit than it deserves, so I really hope we unite, put our differences away and just play [that Blink-182 song](https://youtu.be/DuweYhMNZAo)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): hey

**timothy444** (10): As we look back to the 2010s, no other tropical house song has had the lasting impact that Closer had in the Top 40 and as The Chainsmokers improve their discography, Closer will always be that song that divides everyone. It’s still one of the most controversial songs to be rated and there’s plenty of good and bad things about this song to be said. But, for me, Closer is the reason why Andrew and Alex cemented their legacy from a novelty joke artist to one that has to be taken seriously. The actual song itself is cheesy and corny at times but that’s why Closer is so charming. It’s the modern love song of our generation and to be frank, Andrew Taggart and Halsey just have that certain spark of chemistry together. They’re cute and hopeful of their future and that’s also shown through the production and instrumental backing track. The drop isn’t overblown, it’s relaxing. The vocals from the both of them aren’t forceful, they’re gentle. There doesn’t need to be some big finale or star power in this song because Closer achieves the meaning of simplicity. It’s a song that you can still listen to once in a while and smile. Not because it’s a masterpiece but because it’s timeless.

**twat\_brained** (10): every time I hear Halsey's voice in this song it's like I'm coming home to my favorite person in the universe. Hated as this may be Closer means so much to me because it's the song that saw one of my most beloved artists make the leap to superstardom and for that I'll forever be grateful.

**materialqirl** (9.5): 2016 BOP..

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (9): spend like three years not listening to it due to constant overplay. Forgot how much I loved it

**RandomHypnotica** (9): This song is so good they made it 10 more times and called it an album

**runaway3212** (9): I wish I could give this song a lower rating, because I think it's very bad and started a lot of music trends that I hate, but I just love it so much.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.2): it's a pretty good song don't @ me

**alwayswords** (8): this song is kinda annoying but it has nostalgic value to me so

**ditacarlita** (8): I am obliged to give this song a high score because it was riding high on the radio when I first got my drivers licence and it reminds me of an exceptionally good time, plus Halsey's emotional delivery of her verse is gorgeous.

**skargardin** (8): You know what? I gave this a zero in its very first rate but I'm done pretending that I don't like it. I LOVE it

**vayyiqra** (8): Even though the memes say that Toxic is the theme song of the gays and this is the theme song of the hets, I have never really liked this song. It's one of those songs where you listen to it a bunch of times but it never sinks in and you can never remember how it goes. It's a fine song, and I think both the Chainsmokers and Halsey are overhated artists, but it's not amazing. I think I will be generous and bump it up by 1 because of its cultural impact and because Popheads needs affirmative action for men singers, but really it's a 7.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): I forgot that I actually like this song and it was just totally overplayed

**fishingfor8** (7): Looking back, this is going to be the most 2010s song and it's going to be in so many movies about the 2010s it really is a classic

**fadedblue09** (6): A bit overhated and admittedly overplayed but honestly it’s one of their better hit songs. (I don’t wanna live in a universe where Don’t Let Me Down topped the charts for as long as this did).

hikkaru: 
#The roommate back in Boulder

**bulforster** (7.7): I think I somehow only really heard it in clubs when it was huge so I never really noticed the cringey lyrics, weirdly choppy, basic production and pretty bad singing. That chorus is still undeniable.

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i know many people on this sub love this song and are gonna give it 10s, but it has never been that good for me. still a bop though and was my introduction to the legendary ashley frangipane.

**dnugs\_** (7): same as above but way more generic

**SFbby** (7): It sounds like a regular EDM song

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): ok i loathed this song when it was released but tbh its grown on me and now i won't skip it if it comes on

**bandnitos** (6): why are y'all so hyped over this song its like . a mediocre pop edm song

**nightjesus** (6): sO bAbY pUlL mE cLoSeR iN tHe BaCkSeAt oF uR RoVeR that everyone in this song can afford lol.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): stop trying to make closer a rate winner it’s not going to happen

**waluigiest** (5): this song was huge and then Trump was elected.

**slimboyfriend** (4): ...Hey.

**wavingwolves** (4): i had never heard this song in full but god the chorus is still so incredibly annoying even if the rest is ok so i just really can't

**helpimbeing** (3): A beautiful prechorus followed immediately by one of the worst drops of all time. It's somehow both boring and annoying at the same time!

**ReallyCreative** (3): oh lord... again? a-fucking-gain. nothing new, nothing changed, same old shit. same old fucking shit. In seriousness this is somehow my first time rating this song. It sucks. The song is moving in way too many directions and the production of the chorus is lazy and obnoxious. The lyrics are pretty stupid too

**vhqv1997** (3): This song always sounds good when I'm not listening to it. Not even shade, I just mean that I always remember it better than it is for some reason. Everytime I listen to it it's just a cloud of disappointment because I am always sure beforehand that it's actually a good song.

**BlueMetalWave** (2): generic garbage.

**CritneySpearz** (2): Honestly without Halsey it's a 0 oop. Their worst song for sure, JUSTICE FOR SIDE EFFECTS

**bespectacIed** (1): one of the most heinous crimes in music

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): jfc this song is so obnoxious, i can’t believe i actually sat through all four minutes of it. still hate it as much as i did when it first came out, and it only missed out on my 0 because drake exists

**Awkward\_King** (0): when you can't decide whether you're givng it a ten or a zero you know it's a good song

**Compulsively\_Epic** (0): fuck no

Don't was submitted from the 2010s Ultimate Male rate, where it placed at #4 with an average of 8.565. A lot of r/popheads doesn't like men. This is something that has been knew. As such, the Ultimate Male rate is probably one of the most "niche" rates that we've done. However, out of the four men included in that rate, I think there's an extra special hatred for Mr. Sheeran and his brand of white bread folk-pop. For me personally, I'm not a big fan of the guy, but Don't is one of the few songs of his that I really like, and that's because it's not really that similar to most of the rest of his output. Unfortunately for the song though, it's still by Ed Sheeran, giving it a bottom two position in this rate. This is what happens when you come for Ellie - Matty Healy and La Roux better sleep with one eye open.

---

#La Roux stans

**DaHumanTorch** (10): d10n't, idc idc idc...hate ed all you want this SLAPS. a la mhm laaaa la

**fadedblue09** (10): Giving this a 10 to combat the Sheeranphobia in this sub, and honestly because it’s one of his best songs.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): his biggest bop. Going to be disappointed when this goes out day 1 because y’all hate Ed Sheeran.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/519de01ec4f4cea16fd1cbc715ab7704/tumblr_inline_pppm7nUmKA1rtyrv3_540.gif

**poppinmmolly** (10): I gotta save my boy Eddy

**rickikardashian** (10): We really don't give Ed Sheeran the respect he deserves, becaude Ellie Goulding cheating on him with Niall Horan sounds like the most white, British, bland story, and somehow he came up with this masterpiece

**roxieloxie** (10): this is a top 3 ed sheeran "fuck your new man" song

**runaway3212** (10): Sheeran's best song, super personal lyrics with a great sound.

**skargardin** (10): Go off king

**vhqv1997** (10): I would have preferred it if Thinking Out Loud made it in. Yall hate to admit it but it was Lover by Taylor Swift before Taylor Swift released Lover. But anyway, this song is such an amazing groove that was so understated in its genius. Ed is an amazing songwriter that forgot his own skill, and I seriously hope he finds it in him again because I'm still waiting for him to drop this generic trashy pop music that has absolutely no personality.

**alwayswords** (9.5): iconic bridge

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (9.5): fuck it. I love this song and it's really fun to sing in the car

**ManofOranges** (9.5): One of like the two Ed Sheeran songs that I actually like

**1998tweety** (9): Apparently this is sexist? I have to laugh, sometimes I can't with you popheads :snowflake:. This is one of the first Ed songs I bopped hard to, the chorus is so infectious. I didn't hear the uncensored version until recently so I thought he was just taking a breath between "Don't" and "with my heart". The first time I heard him say fuck shook me, I still bop to both the uncensored and censored versions.

**fishingfor8** (9): This is Ed Sheeran's best hit. it's such a groove and i could make a list of best 10 moments on the song.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): one of Ed's best songs

**timothy444** (9): It's an Ed Sheeran song, of course it's going to be good. He's an amazing songwriter for Christ's sake.

**bulforster** (8.6): Part of me really likes how specific these lyrics are in that trademark Ed Sheeran way, but another smaller part of me still cringes.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.5): Hot take hour, but On My Mind outsold. This song should have been the closest Ed ever got to rapping.

**CarlieScion** (8): AH LA LA LA LA

**Misentro** (8): My only real exposure to Ed Sheeran has been Shape of You, Perfect, and Popheads' opinion of him, so I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this song. It's a really fun track and he sounds great.

**nightjesus** (8): I mean it’s catchy and my favourite Ed Sheeran song. But holy he must have been really hurt to go in that hard.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): an Ed Sheeran song that's kinda sexy? and it kinda works? and i like it?!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Ed Sheeran can make such good songs when he actually tries

**twat\_brained** (7.8): this one's worn down on me in recent years but of all the Ed songs I love this one's still top 10

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i don't want to do the "remember when ed sheeran was good?" thing but remember when he was at least interesting?

**gannade** (7): i dont like ed but this is a good song (ellie is innacent tho)

**slimboyfriend** (7): Oh look an Ed Sheeran song I DON'T hate... ha ha... ha

**vayyiqra** (6): Haha DAE ginger Satan bad? I don't like Ed Sheeran and agree that he's boring, but he's not that bad and you all just hate him because you associate him with basicity (and because you're all Anglophobic jk I made that up). The lyrics are maybe a bit cringe, but you would all jerk off to it if Lily Allen or Adele sang it and you know it. Oh well, this is definitely going out on day 1 anyway.

#Gouldiggers

**waluigiest** (6): this makes me feel :woozy emoji:

**PointlessBibliophage** (5.5): i don't hate it, i don't love it. i can totally see myself listening to this if someone else puts it on.

**J\_Toe** (4): correct. don't. don't make this song. it doesn't need to exist. so dour. so blamey.

**SFbby** (4): I can't take this song seriously like this is Ed Sheeran trying to sound cool and indifferent but all I can see is a derpy Ed Sheeran

**helpimbeing** (2): I feel like I probably rated this pretty high in the original rate but I was probably being generous because I didn't want people to think I was sabotaging Ed Sheeran.

**yourfacesucksass** (2): i agree with this song title

**Awkward\_King** (1): i agree don't

**bespectacIed** (1): used to like this song but we're team Ellie thru and thru fuck Ed sheeran musty mysogynistic ass

**materialqirl** (1): I hate Ed Sheeran LOL

**bandnitos** (0): self care

**BlueMetalWave** (0): There's nothing I enjoy about Ed's music.

**ReallyCreative** (0): More like "Don't listen to this!" amirite fellow homosexuals? Low effort joke aside, this song is just... a polarized trainwreck. The chorus is actually REALLY good but every other aspect of this song just irratates me to no end. I went back and forth on giving this song a 0 because I don't actually believe that chorus warrants a 0, but holy hell the downright painful delivery of even more painful lyrics in the verses is enough to induce an ulcer. The entirety of the verses I'm left wondering "who asked for this?" Then the chorus rolls around and the instrumentation and catchiness kicks in, only for Ed to once again start graphically describing how interesting and successful he is? Or how much he's like us? Or something? In another dimension, the chorus is slapped on as a feature to an actual rap song, and it's a great song. However, we aren't lucky enough to be in that universe, and this song is another painful reminder that we are in fact, in hell.

Kiwi was submitted from the One Direction Solo rate, where it placed at #2 with an average of 8.589. I am... not a big fan of Harry Styles, especially not his debut self-titled album that was included in the One Direction Solo rate. It tries way too hard to call back to the rock styles of the past, and it's perhaps at its most apparent in Kiwi, a loud and obnoxious cut that your dad will be sure to love because it's "real music". Harry, especially in this album, set out to make music that doesn't fit into the pop landscape of the 2010s, and as such it's easy to see why the greater population of rate participants placed this so low out of the sixty songs. Would Sign Of The Times fared better? Probably by a bit to be honest, but it's still not really a song that appeals to the vast majority of people. Be sure to stream Adore You, one of the few songs by Mr. Styles I stan.

#New Zealand residents

**CarlieScion** (10): hey that was my rate! stan king harry but only sometimes! also since hosting this rate i got invited to listen to fine line before it got released and they sent me a free fine line vinyl so i guess i won even tho harry didnt lmao

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): That's nice and all but what about the kiwis?

**ignitethephoenix** (10): His biggest bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/97026b033c9a5ed1f517855884d58bf9/b8d77dfaae43b311-ad/s400x600/c4f5ceb20e9eac6e35c66714d304fd8268c04cfa.gif

**rickikardashian** (10): I really would love to travel to like 2012, and show my little 11 year old self what Harry would have turned into. I probably would have came out earlier

**twat\_brained** (10): slapper. I love this man more than my own family

**vhqv1997** (10): Remember how delusional Harry was when he said Watermelon Sugar would be a bigger banger than Kiwi?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): as a bisexual male, i NEED harry styles to impregnate me

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (9): it's just fun

**materialqirl** (9): its harry styles luv xx

**runaway3212** (9): Harry has for sure made the most interesting music after leaving 1D.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): someone on my European Topdeck played this song as their "guilty pleasure" song like............. ok

**waluigiest** (9): deserved the win over n*all like for real how did that happen

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): harry style's best fruit themed song

**1998tweety** (8): A mega bop

**anothertown** (8): Great example of the personality that HS1 had that Fine Line didn’t

**CritneySpearz** (8): One of the only songs on his debut that I enjoyed, Fine Line is way better thank f*ck

**ditacarlita** (8): I only know Harry's popular singles but this is catchy, I might give his two albums a listen

**fishingfor8** (8): How was someone this talented in the same group as Liam?

**nightjesus** (8): I could see this going OFF at a concert. Probably the most talented out of the 5 from 1D, no offence.

**roxieloxie** (8): hearing this after fine line is lowkey jarring, anyway sream sunflower volume 6 on spotify

**SFbby** (8): All I can hear is that he's having a baby?

**helpimbeing** (7): I haven't the foggiest what this has to do with Harry Styles but it's fun.

#stream On The Loose

**bandnitos** (7): it kinda goes off but it doesn't really click for me

**bulforster** (6.8): B+ Fratellis imitation

**ManofOranges** (6): You know that wasn't bad but it really proved to me that it's just not my thing.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): indistinguishable from the hundred different classic rock songs this song clearly tries to imitate

**ReallyCreative** (4): the repetitive guitar/shouting/"melody" is grating. This is y'all's king? This is just noise. Stream Adore You though

**BlueMetalWave** (3): Didn't enjoy it.

**vayyiqra** (2): Please no more Harry Styles being horny and trying to LARP as Elvis Presley but edgier and also WHY is this song called Kiwi?? Is he horny for a girl from New Zealand? I mean same but

**bespectacIed** (1): i hate him so much omg

**gannade** (1): this was not robbed at all

**DaHumanTorch** (0): this song is SO SO SO bad how was it #2 in its rate. the lyrics are shit, the screaming in the latter half just doesn't work, nothing about this works. also i'm allergic to kiwis. i love harry styles but this is 100% his worst song by a large margin

**fadedblue09** (0): I struggled to finish listening to this one. And I thought the Zayn song was already bad enough. Sorry, while I think Harry is a nice fellow, this kind of neo-boomer rock music he’s going for all just seems forced to me. Also, how did he dominate in his own rate??? Either (a) his music isn’t my cup of tea or (b) the other 1D members make unimaginably horrible music.

**wavingwolves** (0): harry styles is just very mediocre music with a pretty package. also everything about this song is horrible.

The Phoenix was submitted from the Emo Rate 2.0, where it placed at #6 with an average of 8.326. The emo rate sequel that was held last year was one of my favourite rates to participate in - I absolutely adore Paramore and Panic!, and while Fall Out Boy's album wasn't the greatest in my opinion, this song is absolutely stellar. It's the opener to the album, and sets the tone real quick with a blast of pop rock energy. Said rate might be one of the more niche of the past year, so I definitely understand why this is so low, but it definitely is disappointing. Hopefully This Is Gospel can go a bit further for all of us pop rock stans.

#PUT ON YOUR WAR PAINT!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (11): What can I say? I'm a predictable son of a bitch. This song has the trifecta of popheads hate (**men** in a **rock** **band**!) but, while I tried to come up with other arguments, I always went back to this song as being my 11. It is the best song in this rate, even if it won't be recognized as such.

**fadedblue09** (11): I'm a sucker for the whole Young Blood Chronicles and Save Rock and Roll era tbh. Sorry Paramore, maybe next time.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): The best album opener of the decade. Run Away With Me WISHES it was half as powerful as this song is

**CarlieScion** (10): IM GONNA CHANGE YOU! LIKE A REMIX!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/82a0beb4d4085b4f98e160288c23c94c/tumblr_p4jowcdToB1u0wl46o3_500.gif

**roxieloxie** (10): i actually love all three post hiatus FOB albums and this is one of my favorites by them. it reminds me of driving through new york for the first time

**timothy444** (10): Hardcore bop

**vhqv1997** (10): I really like that part in the music video where the women cut off Patrick's hand and he spends the rest of the era being a handicap

**waluigiest** (9): this fallout boy era was iconic and this song goes sooooo hard

**1998tweety** (8.5): The lyrics on this are kind of chessy but WOW it bops

**helpimbeing** (8.5): Reminds me of Sixth Sense by BEG. I dig.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): I love the whole album so yeah. I mean the lyrics are a bit meh but it's fall out boy, so whatever.

**DaHumanTorch** (8): i miss this fall out boy, the one that made bops. i hate the YOUNG AND MENACE ear torture fall out boy

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song is better than I remember

**rickikardashian** (8): this is an awesome song, but Ain't It Fun didn't make the rate, and y'all are just okay with that? shame

#Folie A Deux vs Brand New Eyes vs Vices & Virtues rate when???

**alwayswords** (7.7): bootleg version of novocaine

**twat\_brained** (7.3): FOB are great but they lean too far into tryhard territory for me sometimes

**bandnitos** (7): their best album prove me wrong but this is like . one of the worst songs from it

**Compulsively\_Epic** (7): shit this is 7 years old

**materialqirl** (7): the intro is ok

**yourfacesucksass** (6.7): I feel like FOB is just as confused as I am about who they are at this point

**CritneySpearz** (5): kinda dumb

**ReallyCreative** (5): It's amazing how every song of this genre sounds exactly the same. Interesting instrumentals and that's about it. The song goes on for way too long and just isn't distinctive in any way.

**anothertown** (4): They were trying to make something that challenges me physically because Patrick’s post-hiatus head voice and the strings and “put on your war paint” all gives me an ulcer.. Let’s rate MANIA btw because there are some bangers on there

**nightjesus** (4): I think I’d like it if it was like 2008.

**runaway3212** (4): This album really is not for me.

**BlueMetalWave** (3): Meh.

**J\_Toe** (3): boy, I sure hope songs like this don't stuff up by 2020 Spotify recomendeds like last years' popheads rate did

**bespectacIed** (2): sellouts

**vayyiqra** (1): yeah no I hate this, it's trying and failing to be bombastic and I hate the dude's voice, and also what the fuck were they thinking rhyming "remix" with "phoenix", which is such a cliche trope. This is like a bad parody of an anime intro song.

The Blackest Day was submitted from the 2015 Alt Pop rate, where it placed at #7 with an average of 8.466. A deepcut from Honeymoon, The Blackest Day clocks in a six minutes, which isn't incredibly friendly to listeners that might not already be inclined to listen to Lana Del Rey. I personally really like Honeymoon and this song is pretty good, but it was most likely propelled to being the highest placing Honeymoon song in its original rate because of the fact that most of the participants were probably already are familiar with the album and/or Lana herself, and thus would be kinder to her deep cuts. Unfortunately, it suffered a bit here due to not everyone loving Lana's work, being the first song out by a woman.

---

#Our Honeymoooooooon

**SFbby** (11): I am a hugeeeee Honeymoon stan, and even within Honeymoon, this song stands out from the crowd as Lana sings through a tirade of emotions regarding a lover and the ensuing breakup. The whole song has 5 different sections and each section meshes and molds together to evoke different emotions while still flowing coherently. It goes from the almost nostalgic view of a relationship that both parties know is going to end to the despair of losing a lover and being lost in the feeling to crying on the couch digging deeper and deeper into ice cream and realizing that the relationship was never going to work out to the angry lashing out at the ex-lover to the final resignation and acceptance that Lana is truly on her own again without her lover. This rollercoaster of emotions ends on a somber note where you can't help but feel bad for her, and hope that she can find a new, and better, love again. Bonus points for using the word trigonometry in a song and the sucker punch of "I don't really wanna break up, we got it going on/is what you gathered from my talk, but you were wrong"

**1998tweety** (10): People argue about Lana having really long songs, but she really needs the length to take you on a fully immersive journey. Oddly, this song feels loaded with hooks: the pre-chorus, chorus, and post-chorus are all catchy. The bridge and outro are so so good as well. The thing I love the most about this song is how hopeless Lana sounds. She sounds like she really has no idea what she's gonna do. Lana has so many sad sad songs, but she makes it so believable that this is her blackest day.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this deserved top 3 in its rate but ya'll aren't ready for that conversation...also that bridge is one of lana's best i mean WOW

**materialqirl** (10): it gave me chills OOp-

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): lana's voice continues to sound like an angelic choir

**runaway3212** (10): Just amazing

**vhqv1997** (10): I love the double chorus. Nobody builds a climax like Lana (I know how that sounds but yes that too).

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): It's far from my favorite Lana track and I'm pretty sure I hated it when I first listened to it way back when, but it really grows on you after a while

**BlueMetalWave** (9): Beautiful track.

**cremeebrulee** (9): honeymoon is on the lower side of my Lana album rankings but this song is so gorgeous

**ditacarlita** (9): I recently did the Lana rate and listened to nearly all her discography for the first time and for now many of the songs sound the same to me but this one definitely sticks out, I remember it quite well.

**Awkward\_King** (8): i like this lana song a lot, but it's not my absolute favorite like ride or brooklyn baby or venice bitch would get my 11's this is a solid 8 even among this tough competition

**bandnitos** (8): all i can do is stare at the ceiling

**Misentro** (8): This isn't my favourite Lana song, but the production is excellent. The song has such an oppressively heavy, dark, emotional feel to it.

**rickikardashian** (8): I like the theory that says this is about abortion

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): - This kinda feels like a taste of what L4L would become

**poppinmmolly** (7): okay if you know me you know I really don't like Lana's music but I found myself finding this alright

**sweetnsoursauce1** (7): this was v nice and soothing

#i sleep

**dnugs\_** (7.5): i love lana but this song just don’t do it for me

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): ... In conclusion, stream Froot.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): zzzz

**untutorable** (7): this song feels ten years long

**vayyiqra** (7): I have ... opinions about Honeymoon, and am not really in the mood for a six-minute track from it, though I don't have anything against long songs as a rule. It's pretty though.

**alwayswords** (6.5): a 6 for a 6 minute song xx

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): for a lana song I didn't mind it all that much

**CarlieScion** (6): im so sorry but most of the songs on honeymoon are so boring.

**fadedblue09** (6): Lana never really resonated with me tbh.

**slimboyfriend** (6): the mumble-moaning starts to get grating after the fourth minute

**timothy444** (6): Zzzzzzzzzzzz

**twat\_brained** (6): i'm thankful Lana moved away from this sound and now sounds as great as she ever has on NFR

**waluigiest** (6): tbh Honeymoon has a lot of excellent tracks but this is not one of them

**wavingwolves** (5): i love lana but honeymoon is a really weak album and this song is nothing special

**bulforster** (4): This is pretty much my first time properly listening to a Lana song and sorry to her stans, this one is so boring. I get that the dreariness is the point, but it's not for me.

**helpimbeing** (4): Atmospheric but so boring.

**ManofOranges** (3): I've never been a really big fan of a lot of Lana's songs just because for a lot of them I think the appeal is the feel of them rather than the melody or something? I don't know I can't exactly pinpoint but anyways my point is I think this song is boring.

**nightjesus** (3): Like the movie, I’m just not that into you. Like your music. I’m just not into it.

**bespectacIed** (2): i sleep

Sorry was submitted from the 2010s Ultimate Male rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 8.565. Yet another entry from the 2010s Ultimate Rate, Bieber takes the fall quite early. The Purpose era was huge for pop, marking the redemption of Bieber and ushering in a new sound, that being a fresh take on EDM that leaned more tropical. The album is surely infuential and was very successful, but Sorry is definitely held back by what I see as extremely douchey lyrics that do absolutely nothing to separate Bieber from the public perception of him - especially here on r/popheads where he's in very few people's good graces. I don't love this song, and I definitely see why it's placing so low here, but I will say that it's quite a bit better than his most recent album.

#Forgiven

**ditacarlita** (10): spit on me, Bieber

**ignitethephoenix** (10): idc what anyone says or thinks about Justin now, this song is a bop and a half and is one of the best songs he has done.

**J\_Toe** (10): I regret giving this a 10 but think it is honestly a good song out of this list

**nightjesus** (10): Justin. JUSTIN. THIS IS WHAT YOU’RE CAPABLE OF. I miss this kind of perfect bop perfection from the Biebs.

**rickikardashian** (10): I didn't notice how douchey Justin comes off in this song until I saw reviews that pointed it out, but to be fair, anything he says is quite irrelevant, what makes this song amazing is the amazing production on it. EDM can age fast and very badly, yet this song sounds as fresh as the first time I listened to it.

**wavingwolves** (10): sorry but i do love this song and i think it's one of the best hit songs of the 10s

**alwayswords** (9.5): im so ashame..

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.3): good song but it's still too late

**1998tweety** (9): This song bops but idk why exactly it was a bigger hit than WDYM.

**BlueMetalWave** (9): I hate how good this song is.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): mustinnnnn what happened??? remember when you made bops like this?

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://media1.tenor.com/images/ce95d744e2876cda22f41310d8cd06cc/tenor.gif

**materialqirl** (9): danceable bop

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): a good song but Justin is a whole douche bag so i will penalize this

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): It's certainly too late for Justin to say sorry about Yummy at least

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8.5): okay like i was OBSESSED with the song when it came out but it really hasn't aged well for me but still a banger

**bulforster** (8): Skrillex really snapped here, too bad the lyrics make my skin crawl.

**runaway3212** (8): Justin Bieber will never be my favourite artist, but this song is highly enjoyable and is one of his best from the purpose era.

**slimboyfriend** (8): I'm convinced we all had a collective hallucination that Justin Bieber made enjoyable music in 2015

**vhqv1997** (8): One of the few Bieber songs I actually like, because he doesn't sound like a stupid dickhead in this, but to be heonst, the real star of this song is the beat, those trebling horns that come in regularly during the chorus add so much power and earworm to this song it's insane.

**waluigiest** (8): I think this is the only Justin Bieber song I genuinely enjoy. Brilliant orchestration and melodies.

**bandnitos** (7): definitely of its time but still kinda goes off

**helpimbeing** (7): Nothing special but the production is nice.

#Got mad at his honesty

**roxieloxie** (7.5): if you remove the beat this song is nothing

**twat\_brained** (7): if you were truly sorry you wouldn't have let Changes happen. Hell, what "changes" am I to believe you've made to improve your image? NEXT.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): Remember when Pitchfork put this in their top songs of the 10’s list and for the writeup they compared it to the fucking black lives matter movement? bc justin bieber apologizing for his shitty action are somehow comparable to wanting to end racism? fuck pitchfork is what im getting at

**CarlieScion** (6): there are better songs on purpose (including the halsey feature sorry not sorry)

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): Repeat with me, everyone: apologizing only works once you show you've taken steps to fix your mistakes. This also suffers from 'uh we ran out of lines but the melody is still going, insert a random noise!' which is always a favorite of mine.

**vayyiqra** (6): This song makes me mad, because I'm Canadian and therefore it was unavoidable for a while, and I hate the Bieb, and it's infuriatingly catchy. I never want to hear it again, but I am forced to admit it's not that bad. Whatever, Popheads will tank it anyway because they hate the Bieb too, so justice served.

**yourfacesucksass** (6): i can appreciate some of his stuff but this one BYE

**bespectacIed** (5): it's actually not that bad and this will be the song that people will remember as we look back at the trop pop boom of the later 2010s

**ReallyCreative** (5): This song is moving in a lot of directions and very few of them are good. Justin's mumble singing at the beginning is just trash. The production can't seem to make up what kind of song it wants to be, though I do like the instrumentation/production of the chorus. It's still meh as hell tho

**gannade** (2.5): hate this, sorry (not sorry)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2.5): really can’t stand this song, sorry not sorry

**timothy444** (2): Justin Bieber just sounds so insecure and immature here that an apology song like this feels really hollow. Everything from the annoying intro to the cringey lyrics is just plain bad and it's only a hit because it has an A-list singer on it.

**JunkyGS** (0): What should have been a moment of self reflection & calling yourself out turns into well.... no. Justin's ego couldnt handle that and this song comes across as the most insincere gaslighting apology. "'ll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two" You'll apologize cause your partner wants you to? Not because you fucked up? Also continuing to not go one song without blaming the other person. yawn, especially when you promo this song specifically saying its about selena, along with other songs. Its yikes. Also side note without going into detail I know Justin Bieber is one of the scummiest people in hollywood, so yeah fuck him.

Burnin' Up was submitted from the Disney Golden Generation rate, where it placed at #5 with an average of 8.838. This was the highest placing Jonas Brothers song in the original rate, and for good reason - for those that like it, there are some iconique lines in this song. However, as the theme of the original rate suggests, this is quite Disney and thus isn't for everyone. It has that iconic pop-rock sound of the time, which I'm a fan of, but unfortunately the JoBros take the fall early. Perhaps Demi can do better as the other representative from this rate.

#I'M HOT

**1998tweety** (10): Wow this is literally perfection. Bops so so hard.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Keep in mind, they released this over ten years BEFORE Cool or Only Human. The regression.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): if you don't scream IM HOT YOU'RE COLD every time this song plays you had no childhood, period

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This always holds a special place in my 12 year old heart

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/0363b9cf9dc4bc93a56b12385b843a25/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Even though I was a child during the peak Jonas Brothers time I never really caught on to their music like everyone else did. And I have to say... I really was missing out. This song is something else. Also, shout out to Nick yelling red dress like that.

**nightjesus** (10): Best rap verse in history don’t at me.

**rickikardashian** (10): **R ^e ^^e E ^^E ^e D   D r ^e E ^^E e S ^^S S**

**roxieloxie** (10): i told freeways our rate wasnt gonna have any taste when there were 3 selena songs that were above this iconic bop

**twat\_brained** (10): No matter how overplayed Sucker is this will remain a classic.

**untutorable** (10): big rob is a legend

**anothertown** (9.5): Years later, this is still their best song, and I say this as a stan

**CarlieScion** (9): i cant listen to this without thinking of the paint parody

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): would be a ten but the last minute of the song still ruins it for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): yeah i know rEd DrEsS is iconic but what about that rap from the jonas brothers’ security guard? he should have a whole song to himself

**fadedblue09** (8.2): Was expecting to hate this but wow, they did that. The chorus is dope, bridge is awful.

**Awkward\_King** (8): god just take me back to the late 2000s

**bandnitos** (8): i was born in 2002 so this just has extremely strong emotions associated with it also why was nick trying to do those ad libs

**runaway3212** (8): Joe is the best Jonas Brother don't @ me

**timothy444** (8): Decent effort from Disney to make a family-friendly pop-rock song.

**wavingwolves** (8): ok but the mv for this one is a 10\

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): where's Kevin?

**waluigiest** (7): bridge is still tight

#YOU'RE COLD

**CritneySpearz** (7): gay

**materialqirl** (6.5): eh jonas brothers were never really my thing except in camp rock and year 3000

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): that bridge feature made this song lose a point

**ditacarlita** (6): Madonna found moaning and writhing around in a ditch unphased

**vayyiqra** (6): I will stand by my belief that the Jonas Brothers are just the Hansen of the 2010s, but this is kind of catchy, though as I said with "Waking Up in Vegas" I don't like pop-rock.

**bulforster** (5.5): Why are they straining their voices like that??

**BlueMetalWave** (5): Meh.

**letsallpoo** (5): the way lovebug complete shits on this...

**ReallyCreative** (5): Wow this song is so close to being good but there are so many CHOICES in the back half of the song this is why I can't get into boy bands

**static\_int\_husp** (5): I cannot get past the out of nowhere rap verse from their bodyguard

**dnugs\_** (4): come on

**helpimbeing** (3): Nope.

**Compulsively\_Epic** (2): nah

**vhqv1997** (2): I can't stand Joe and Nick singing like they're undergoing cock and ball torture

I Won't Say (I'm In Love) was submitted from the Disney Animated Classics rate, where it placed at #4 with an average of 8.853. To be completely honest, I've never really seen this as one of the most ~iconic~ Disney bops (like Reflection) but that's just my onion. I do think that probably had something to do with it ending up here in the bottom 10, though. This is very cute, but I won't say (I'm in love) I'm surprised to see it this low.

---

#HERC WAS ON A ROLL

**bespectacIed** (10): SHOULD HAVE WON THE DISNEY RATE I HATE Y'ALL OMG i can't get over the fact you let a MAN beat this perfection

**BlueMetalWave** (10): Absolutely perfect.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of the best disney songs in one of the best disney movies? we had to stan. deserved top 3 in the disney rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/c970c6a71eb26a5bc1baefd2c3abb58c/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Probably my favorite Disney song of all time.

**ReallyCreative** (10): An event, Ms. Susan SERVED queer rights and my 4 year old gay ass was living

**rickikardashian** (10): I gave this an 11, with absolutely no expectations for it, in fact, I expected it to go out v early, because if I have learned something from this sub, is that anytime I absolutely love a song, it will have a tragic death at any given rate. Seeing it thrive, all the way to #4 has been the wildest ride I've ever taken

**SFbby** (10): One of the most relatable Disney songs where prides meets desire

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): one of the best Disney songs

**TiltControls** (10): underrated track that doesn't often get enough recognition

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): Oh it slaps

**1998tweety** (9): This is cute and groovy, we love it.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): You are, girl.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Why are Disney songs so good

**vhqv1997** (9): I remember when we first started hosting this rate, I kinda suspected that this song wouldn't do that well since it's kinda niche. But then it went #4 lmao. I really thought that people advocating for Megara were just a really loud minority, but apparently that loud minority is called the LGBTQ+ community apparently lol. Well, it deserves it anyway, I do wonder how this song will perform in this rate, but whatever, it already got the recognition it deserved once.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): this is one of the few Disney songs I actually prefer in my native language but I guess the English version will do

**materialqirl** (7.5): lowkey out of place but BOP

#Homophobic

**runaway3212** (6.5): Hercules does have some good songs, but this is not one of them

**twat\_brained** (6.2): you betta don't! Your love interest has barely started adulthood- oh who am I kidding the film is based on Ancient Greece morality is an afterthought

This Is Gospel was submitted from the Emo Rate 2.0, where it placed at #3 with an average of 8.744. As a Panic! stan, I have to say that This Is Gospel isn't really one of my favourites from the group/Brendon. That being said, it's definitely one of their most iconic songs, with the chorus being a meme in itself. Unfortunate to see it go so soon, but a pop rock song with male vocals is DIS GUS TANG as we all know! I'm patiently awaiting the follow up to PFTW @brendon urie please make a better album this time x

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I say the same I did for the emo rate: If you love me let me GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**runaway3212** (10): IF YOU LOVE ME LET ME GOOOOO

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): IF YOU LOVE ME LET ME GOOOOOO

**materialqirl** (9): if you love me let me GOOOOOO

#this IS gospel!

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (10): this is the best panic! At the disco song. Fight me!

**bandnitos** (10): when i saw this live it was a religious experience

**CarlieScion** (10): this is beautiful. the piano version is still better tho.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): my favorite p!atd song easily, hope ya'll do it justice

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/9e7501a0882f43d7a566631f06b05f67/tenor.gif

**SFbby** (10): So I'm rating the piano version of this but it's such a beautiful song of desperation and pain.

**twat\_brained** (10): I really hope Spencer got the help he needed

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i would’ve given this my 11 if paramore wasn’t also in the rate

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): brendon urie is the only man

**fadedblue09** (8.7): Despite being a solid FOB stan, I never really got into their music because Brendon’s voice never clicked with me (he always sounded like a less mature version of Patrick Stump). Regardless, I’d say this is fine.

**1998tweety** (8): Bop

**roxieloxie** (8): tbt this is one of the best 2010s panic! songs

**nightjesus** (7): Okay so I didn’t realise this was a song off a Vine I find quite funny and literally when the chorus hit I started laughing very hard. This was very fun to listen too yes.

#curmudgeonly AFYCSO stans that think panic died with ryan ross

**CritneySpearz** (6): just meh

**vhqv1997** (6): It would have been a 10 for the piano version

**ReallyCreative** (5.8): I love the vocoder/synth chords but they are ditched for an extremely generic chorus. I will never understand the appeal of Panic! or similar white boy bands/individuals that have hijacked a white boy band with their own persona

**anothertown** (5): I don’t like this song it’s deeply melodramatic and overproduced and has the whoa-ohs that I hate. It’s only because of its association with Vine that it gets above a 3.

**BlueMetalWave** (5): Not really into it.

**vayyiqra** (3): HAVEN'T YOU PEOPLE EVER HEARD OF CLOSING THE GODDAMN DOOR oh wait that's the other song by them I know because it's a meme. I have heard this somewhere before, and it's okay, but I can't say I like it.

#oh... okay i'm sorry...

**helpimbeing** (1): How dare you waste my time like this.

Nice For What was submitted from the Hip Hop #1s rate, where it placed at #8 with an average of 8.639. In 2018, Drake was inescapable. Not that he was really escapable before, but Scorpion DOMINATED. For a lot of popheads, the one shining star from that era was Nice For What, a banger of a bounce-influenced track with cameos from Big Freedia and Lauryn Hill. It stuck out among a lot of other hip hop on the charts at the time, and still bops to this day... for some of us. For others, clearly, they're still not even a fan of this, and so Drake falls early here. Unfortunate, but not surprising.

---

#Feminism!

**CarlieScion** (10): drake is good. actually. i will go down with this ship.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Popheads will massacre this, but fuck y'all. This is great. It could have been an 11.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of his best songs! Such a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/2079c6ea0f0455a25e77ac0d212419c3/tenor.gif

**rickikardashian** (10): Having to give this song my 11, knowing damn well Hey Ya would win has been the hardest thing I've done. Fuck Drake and his ability of actually doing great music every once in a while

**roxieloxie** (10): i related this song lower in its rate but this is actually a really good song i cant even lie. this is highkey an 11

**runaway3212** (10): Drake just honestly works on this song, it resonates with me even tough I'm not at all the target audience.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): One of Drake's best singles, this absolutely deserved its success

**bulforster** (9.1): Mostly for Big Freedia and Lauryn but Drake does have some pretty good parts.

**1998tweety** (9): we LOVE a feminist king. Lauryn Hill's power, I wanted to say that this song is carried by that sample but Drake's verses are pretty good too.

**timothy444** (9): In my opinion, Drake's discography is really boring but this song is one of those exceptions. Everything in it is so lively and even if you hate Drake, it's hard to stop dancing to this.

**twat\_brained** (9): this is one of maybe 7 Drake songs I'll willingly jam out to and not squirm in impatience for it to end.

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): I can really only tolerate Drake when he's doing something up tempo like this but reminder that he is a creep that needs to stop texting minors

**poppinmmolly** (8): I usually don't like Drake that much but I do kinda dig this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): We stan a female empowerment anthem

#Misogynists

**helpimbeing** (7.5): um hehe

**bandnitos** (7): only for big freedia also how did this take eighteen writers

**vayyiqra** (7): I think I like the sample on this more than the song itself, but I'll be nice even though I know this is going out early because Popheads hates Drake and thinks he's a pedophile.

**materialqirl** (6.5): drake is lowkey a creep so

**BlueMetalWave** (6): Not my thing but I wasn't bored.

**worlds-okayest666** (6): This is...mid? Not what I expected considering how hyped-up it was

**anothertown** (5.5): Stream Ex-Factor by Lauryn Hill

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): I can't really say anything about this since I got distracted while it played and didn't feel like restarting it

**DaHumanTorch** (4): i know a lot of popheads think this is the best drake song or something, but i just don't like it. in my feelings is better sorry

**vhqv1997** (2): This song is just hella dumb, I have no idea why it took off as much as it did. It's definitely his best in a while, but like... that's not a high bar

**dnugs\_** (0): it’s drake

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (0): drake can absolutely fuck off, this song is so annoying i want to rip my ears out after hearing 5 seconds of it

Lose Yourself was submitted from the Hip Hop #1s rate, where it placed at #10 with an average of 8.397. I personally kind of have a visceral reaction to anything Eminem just for what he represents. I'm more than happy to see this go away so soon to be honest. My personal feelings aside, it's hard to say that this song is anything but iconic. "Mom's spaghetti" will continue to change lives forevermore. Now here's one more fuck you to Eminem for blocking Halsey on the Billboard 200 last month.

---

#I needed to lose me to love you

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I mean, duh.

**ditacarlita** (10): when the song starts to build as he raps "the whole crowd grows so loud" ugh!

**helpimbeing** (10): Iconic.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Can’t wait for the Eminem hate circle jerk even though this is one of his best and least problematic songs. Also I guess this song is still relevant since he performed it at the Oscars?!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/6ae1268ec6afd5e729966b9226de5d89/tenor.gif

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): too many bangers in this rate. I stand firmly that this song is some of Eminem's best work

**vhqv1997** (10): Eminem's best song, almost universally agreed. Personally I like Rap God just because of the swag, but this definitely has harder bars.

**gannade** (9): eminem can call me a faggot and choke me

**rickikardashian** (9): why did Eminem sing this at the Oscar's

**runaway3212** (9): Eminem can sometimes make very good songs and this is one of them. It is honestly so good.

**SFbby** (9): One of the most classic rap songs

**timothy444** (9): Is it the best Eninem song? No. Does it still bop? Yes

**Tolk1en** (9): I hate Eminem, but I love this one song too much to sabotage him.

**twat\_brained** (8.9): I can't believe Em went from classic music like this to Music To Get Murdered By. That said his Oscars performance as legendary

**Compulsively\_Epic** (8.5): i guess

**materialqirl** (8): if u had one shot

**waluigiest** (8): I hate Eminem but this song is good and it’s really nostalgic and personal to me

**1998tweety** (7.5): A misogynistic homophobe, but he occasionally makes a point with a good song.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.4): I'm sorry this song just annoys me

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): just realised I haven't listened to this in ages but since I still know all the lyrics I now know what kinda useless info is forever stuck in my head

**DaHumanTorch** (7): knees weak, arms heavy, mom's spaghetti

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): moms spaghetti

**TiltControls** (6.5): realizing now Mom's spaghetti would have made a great meme song for the rate

#Vomited on their sweater

**ReallyCreative** (7): I get that this is like a classic and I even think it's pretty good but I can't help but feel like this is gassed up a little bit. This is random but one of my (white) coworkers tried telling me that Eminem was the only rapper still in the game that was bringing 80s-90s rap style and today's rap sucks and I don't know enough about rap to really respond but I'm 95% sure he's just racist

**zadooi** (6.5): I think overplay really hurt my enjoyment of this song.

**slimboyfriend** (6): "His soul's escaping from his hole that's gaping" you'd think someone who likes to say faggot so often would notice this

**dnugs\_** (5): it’s eminem

**vayyiqra** (5): lol why is this here it's such a fucking meme; I can't even rate it fairly so it gets a 5

**wavingwolves** (5): seeing eminem performing at the oscars wasn't good for this song

**worlds-okayest666** (5): This song is so boring tbh...I hate it here!!!

**CritneySpearz** (2): Honestly his voice is so obnoxious to me I’m sorry!

**bandnitos** (1): i had to give ed my zero for legal reasons but this was a contender

**roxieloxie** (1): no

**kappyko** (0): i hate eminem

Groove Is In The Heart was submitted from the One Hit Wonderland rate, where it placed at #6 with an average of 8.103. Not to get into dragging hosts for their picks, but sorry to say - Lovefool was fucking ROBBED. Anyways, I'm not a big fan of this song. It's obnoxious. It's easy for me to see why the group that made this ended up as a one hit wonder, and also easy for me to see why this is out so soon. It has its fans seeing as it did get some high scores here, but not enough to spare it from being cut on day 1.

---

#GROOVE IS IN THE HEAAAAART x23094839204

**bespectacIed** (11): Yeah I'm gonna lose this 11 again, and I don't care because I'll sleep soundly at night knowing I'm not tasteless and don't stuff asbestos in my ears. This is the definitive best song on the rate, let alone on its original rate. It's just a perfect hodgepodge of perfect little things: the bassline, the jingly jangly production, the swirling whistle, the "One, two, three, plrlrlrlrrrr" that invented beat drops even before people knew what a beat drop meant. This song is flawless. I TRULY COULDN'T ASK FOR ANOTHER.

**1998tweety** (10): So so iconic

**bulforster** (10): How do you say, deee-ICONIC??

**ditacarlita** (10): I mean only one of the best dance pop songs of all time

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://66.media.tumblr.com/2a4792553e7bb55edca9367ba4aea71e/tumblr_pdimu6vXxr1tqlrbg_540.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): I had gone into the one hit wonderland rate knowing that this would lose to take on me but never did I think it would miss out on the top 5. I was shocked. I honestly don't quite understand how that happened still but at this point all I ask for is that it doesn't get robbed again.

**materialqirl** (9.9): 90s bop

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): the groove is in the heart and the fucking beat

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): groove is in the heeeeaargh

**twat\_brained** (9.4): this music video is the greatest LSD trip ever. Also Q-Tip's verse is an example of a guest rap done RIGHT.

**BlueMetalWave** (8): It's a fun song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): https://open.spotify.com/track/1TiFlmiOGsvMjN90cOOOMN?si=avoU5QDvRcmG4PSBdoyoEA

**ignitethephoenix** (8): slide whistle in a song? Iconic

**runaway3212** (8): An amazing classic that's better everytime I hear it.

**vayyiqra** (8): This song has always stuck with me because it's so fucking bizarre, yet so catchy. This could only have come out of the early 90s. Trust me, I was there. Anyway, issa bop.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i don't love this song or anything but i remember dancing to this on just dance which def boosted its score cause nostalgia

**RandomHypnotica** (7): this song is fun. thats it. thats all I have to say.

**vhqv1997** (7): This is a cool danceclub song. Could have done without the extended outro though.

#One Hit Wonder for a reason

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): Fun on first listen, song gets kinda annoying after a while

**sweetnsoursauce1** (6.5): don't hate me i never got into this song

**bandnitos** (5): i get that it was in 1990 but the mixing is giving me a really bad headache

**waluigiest** (5): one hit wonder for a reason!!!

**helpimbeing** (4): Out of all the great songs in this rate, we really brought this one back?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): I like the music video for this song more than the song itself

**CritneySpearz** (3): her voice is so fucking annoying I’m so sorry sweaty

**nightjesus** (3): It’s rated this because my mother thought she could dance to this when I was younger and I had to explain to her that it didn’t look good and it probably didn’t look good when she was in the nightclub when it was released. When she’s had a few wines she always plays this song and always impersonates the beginning as well. I’m talking the walk and weird noises and everything. I had to sit and watch. There is a point when you just can’t take it anymore. That point is thirteen. No regrets.

**PointlessBibliophage** (3): ew what is this

**fadedblue09** (2.7): Glad they were a one-hit wonder then.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (0): I don't think there's a single song I loathe more than this... Everything about it annoys me. Every single thing. I hate this rate for making me listen to it again. And it's nearly four goddamn minutes long.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): This song honestly feels like the most cluttered, poorly put together hits in contemporary music.

Mama's Broken Heart was submitted from the Early 10s Country Classics rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 8.791. Miranda is a classic yeehaw queen, and she didn't really divert from that with the album we rated a few months ago, Four The Record. This is the poppiest song on the album and has a Kacey Musgraves co-write, but it's still very country, unlike Back To December and Blown Away which have more pop appeal. This bops well enough, but it's not really for me. For you country stans out there, let's hope Carrie and Taylor can do better.

---

#Yeehaw!

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10, a MASSIVE bop

**CarlieScion** (10): wig snatched, crops watered etc etc

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i'm not a country fan by any means, but whenever my mom would play country radio in the car this was the one song i'd go off to. so good and aged like fine wine

**fadedblue09** (10): This was co-written by Kacey? Probably shady, but this was lowkey better than her own songs that were in this rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/885df877e30b745819641921101e5357/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): Please popheads don't rob this song just because it's country

**DrunkHurricane** (9.5): https://i.redd.it/8jyzlw4808341.png

**vhqv1997** (9): By this point in her discography, Miranda has already caused enough destruction due to a break-up that having her mom tell her this now is kinda moot

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): Something something Kacey Musgraves.

**ditacarlita** (8): I surprisingly enjoyed this, I've never heard any of her songs before. Loving all the discoveries from this rate!

**helpimbeing** (8): Let's burn this bitch down.

**alwayswords** (7.5): i love the guitar

**anothertown** (7.5): My best friend from high school played country music nonstop in her car and my solace was whenever this song came on. Yes she did turn out to be MAGA

**ReallyCreative** (7.3): My biggest complaint is that this song doesn't go in hard enough

**yourfacesucksass** (7.2): she legit says "expense of my liver" and I felt that

**SFbby** (7): Clever spin on breaking your mom's heart

#Miranda Lambert's mama

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): This reminds me of that one tumblr post that says all female country songs can be boiled down to “im gonna kill my husband”

**twat\_brained** (5): it's not just me who thinks it's almost too coincidental that this sounds like MCR's "Mama", right?

**Compulsively\_Epic** (4): i cant

**nightjesus** (4): Eh.

**BlueMetalWave** (3): I don't like this type of music.

**bandnitos** (2): i dont like actual country i only like the fake shit

**bespectacIed** (2): it's so bad

**vayyiqra** (1): Why did I even do this rate I don't remember because I hate country and it took like 6 hours and it was 4 in the morning by the time I was done and this song is like it's been scientifically engineered to make me personally hate it but whatever I won't skip it because I am a good sport even though this is ear torture, like when the US military played metal music to soften up

Dancing was submitted from the 2018 Comebacks rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 8.789. Kylie Minogue is a queen who has had a very extensive career, with albums spanning multiple genres. With Golden, Kylie experimented with some country-pop, seen in the acoustics of Dancing. It's a cute bop, but personally I don't think it's anywhere near her best. Still, I don't mind the experimentation, but it clearly had an affect on her showing here. Be sure to give Get Outta My Way your 10s in All Stars 4 next year!

---

#Yeehaw!

**CarlieScion** (10): country QUEEN

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): I just had a dumb smile on my face while this song played.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i cannot put into words how much i love this song...another one i strongly considered giving my 11 to. this rate is just too stacked :despair:

**fishingfor8** (10): i feel like this song has existed for eternity there's something classic about it

**materialqirl** (10): its kylie, duh

**bulforster** (9.2): Seems to be going for EDM Dolly Parton and succeeds, which is amazing. A fun and classy bop.

**1998tweety** (9): Love the wordplay on this track and that thereès an interpretation that the song is actually about death. Lines like "When you come knocking, I’ll be at your door" give it away. Lyrics aside, the song is fun too. Kylie clearly isn't trying to make a country song (and she knows it); instead, she's just taking her dance-pop style and adding country influences to it-- and it works well!

**ExtraEater** (9): But 'Stop Me From Falling' is better

**ReallyCreative** (9): Not my favorite from the album but it's still great and Kylie is just the queen of unapologetically fun music

**runaway3212** (9): A song that's both sad and fun, it is really good.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.1): notttt her best imo

**BlueMetalWave** (8): Fun, good track.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (8): wow another bop i can't believe i haven't heard before

**twat\_brained** (7.4): good but Kylie's done far better

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): it's fun. It's dancey

**ditacarlita** (7): it's cute but doesn't hold up among Kylie's incredible list of singles

**helpimbeing** (7): Cute.

#Stream Aphrodite

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): I thought the trend of cut up vocals in choruses died 3 years ago

**bandnitos** (6): i am not a kylie minogue fan so i can't say i had a solid idea of what this song would be but a country dance song was not even close to what i expected

**RandomHypnotica** (6): I mean it’s OK but it can’t stand up to any of her other hits

**CritneySpearz** (5): kinda trash sorry binches

**anothertown** (4): this just makes me want to listen to Get Outta My Way

**nightjesus** (4): This song played constantly on a 14 hour flight. By the end of it, a song that I most likely would have loved if the end of the chorus didn’t have that FREAKING sound. That weird dolphin noise or what ever it is. Oh WAIT THATS HER VOICE?! Sorry the plane toilets made it very distorted. But regardless it’s not 2012, stop doing that thing people!

**vayyiqra** (4): Why is there acoustic guitar on my Kylie Minogue song? DIS-GAHS-TENG. Okay it bops a little, but she has way, way better songs. As someone who's been a fan of Kylie for two decades and only ever heard her do synthpop, this is just bizarre.

**vhqv1997** (4): This sounds like a Carrie Underwood song.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): https://68.media.tumblr.com/ad6efd62288979b5437b4bef3fbc2db3/tumblr_inline_o0khokwgpn1ra43cw_500.gif

**kappyko** (3): i dont like this song

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This is so generic, I know she can do better than this

**waluigiest** (0): I genuinely did not enjoy listening to this album. I think it was incredibly clumsy, and this song is emblematic of that.

Forevermore was submitted from Popheads Worldvision, where it placed at #3. To be completely honest, I'm not really familiar with this nor Echoes, as I didn't participate in the Worldvision rate and haven't heard of either artist until hosting this rate. And I think that, unfortunately for Yuna, she suffers from not being a very well known entity amongst a lot of VERY well known entities. As such, she's out on day 1, but we'll have to see if Lola Marsh fares any better.

---

#Worldvision stans

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh she is so damn underrated, this song is amazing.

**rickikardashian** (10): This song will get destroyed against the all the other more well-known songs, but the fact that it got sent to all Stars makes me feel proud, although I had no part in the creation of the song c:

**nightjesus** (9): How did I miss this? This is so good? Hello Yuna welcome to my rotation yas girl.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): Malaysian Lorde

**vhqv1997** (9): The instrumentals are gorgeous. I really love how ethereal and folksy this song is, yet it still sounds extermely modern. Like watching an escape from a science fantasy prison overflowing with neon lights and giant willow trees. Hold on, I need to go sketch something.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Very chill and very enjoyable

**bandnitos** (8): im starting to fall asleep bc i woke up really early and its like 9:30 also i took a nap a little bit ago but from what i remember its good

**DaHumanTorch** (8): oh this was a cute chill bop, yet another artist i'll need to check out after doing this rate

**helpimbeing** (8): Love the vibes.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://pics.me.me/girl-i-hear-sum-and-it-slaps-36685245.png

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Motivational bop

**twat\_brained** (8): i need to start playing artists outside of Europe and North America

**vayyiqra** (8): wtf I love Yuna now this is vayycore

**BlueMetalWave** (7): Nice and chill song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): No comment, just a basic good song.

**waluigiest** (7): this is chill and nice!

Down was voted in from the 2009 Billboard Year-End rate, where it placed at #21 with an average of 7.883. This is a throwback bop, but in the 2009 rate it wasn't appreciated as much as some think it should have been. It only placed at #21, joining The Veronicas in just barely making the final day of the rate. It also joined The Veronicas in being voted in to this rate! Clearly people want justice for their decade-old nostalgic bangers, but unfortunately they won't be finding it with Down. Maybe The Veronicas will fare better?

#Jay Sean stans

**ExtraEater** (11): THE greatest song of all time

**poppinmmolly** (11): I was wrestling with my 11 but then u/extraeater reminded me that I have given this my 11 before and you know what? let's stay consistent.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (11): one of my all time favourite songs. "i'm down like the economy" is still iconic

**1998tweety** (10): Jay Sean a HOT ethnic king, we STAN. Down is THAT bop, Sweet but Psycho is SHOOK

**bandnitos** (10): seven year old me is shaking

**CarlieScion** (10): god what a fucking BOP

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Jay Sean walked so everyone else in pop music could run. Also “Down Like the Economy” is one of most iconic lines of the 21st century

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Gangnam_Style_2015-06-21.gif/140px-Gangnam_Style_2015-06-21.gif

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): i wish i could give two 11's

**roxieloxie** (10): i have heard this song everywhere since the 2009 rat and its an absoulute bop i cant even complain

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I was 7 when this song came out and it still sounds as good now as it did back then

**timothy444** (10): Looking back on it, Down is really generic but damn, it's catchy af

**wavingwolves** (10): a PERFECT song! yes!

**alwayswords** (9.5): i used to make flipnotes with this song in the background… a classic me thinks

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): Robbed in the 2009 rate, probably will be robbed here. You hate to see it.

**Compulsively\_Epic** (9): fuck yeah

**dnugs\_** (9): lil wayne’s verse is iconic

**ManofOranges** (9): Classic song but I do think that Lil Wayne's verse kind of detracts from it a little bit

**ReallyCreative** (9): Turned the middle school sock hop into a sock BOP honey

**untutorable** (9): lil wayne's best feature

**twat\_brained** (8.7): this holds up way better than it should. apart from Wayne's verse nothing can make me tolerate Lil Wayne

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): omg a throwback, serving middle school dance and i'm living for it

**ditacarlita** (8.5): this song was the shit when it came out and it still is

**runaway3212** (8.5): Irrationaly love this song, it just makes me very happy

**BlueMetalWave** (8): Great, fun track with a good rap feature.

**waluigiest** (8): peak 2009 in the most glorious way

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): this song is basically my sophomore year homecoming exemplified

#Down like the economy

**rickikardashian** (8): I have to be real, I'm genuinely confused as to why this got voted in, because I don't remember any memes or jokes with this song, but I also never saw it as a fan favorite, so honestly I just wanna know how and why this made this rate

**helpimbeing** (7): cute I guess

**slimboyfriend** (7): "down like the economy" was too real for 2009 :///

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): the lil wayne verse really ages this song

**bulforster** (6): 'Honestly, I'm down like the economy' is transcendent but whatever Wayne is doing over the last chorus is atrocious so they cancel out.

**nightjesus** (6): I mean I’ve never overly loved this song. It’s cute but like eh. It doesn’t deserve to be a number one. Kinda surprised it made it on to this list.

**J\_Toe** (5): what rate was this even part of?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (5): took off some points because of lil wayne’s part

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): at first I was like this is a nice throwback. And then it just became grating really fast

**materialqirl** (4): why is this even-

**skargardin** (4): Lil Wayne's mere presence makes me wanna rip my ears out

**vhqv1997** (2): This song is peak early 2000s American club dance song, and sorry but I'm not part of that culture and I truly don't like it.

**fadedblue09** (1): This triggered some unpleasant flashbacks. shudders.

**JunkyGS** (1): Aged like Milk sorry

**vayyiqra** (0): no.

My Immortal was submitted from the Aughties Rock Bands rate, where it placed at #6 with an average of 8.626. Coming from the most niche rate of last year, where the majority of the songs were of a genre that hasn't seen popularity in over a decade and isn't the target focus on popheads, My Immortal sticks out as being a piano ballad as opposed to a rock based song. Yet still, it sees itself falling before Linkin Park's In The End, and I think the problem people have with it is that it leans too far into the ballad territory and ends up being a bit boring. And of course, the best part of this song is that it shares its name with the most iconic fanfiction to ever exist.

#Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way outsold.

**untutorable** (8): blows a kiss to the sky for ebony dark'ness dementia raven way

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): Hi my name is Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that's how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don't know who she is get da hell out of here!). I'm not related to Gerard Way but I wish I was because he's a major fucking hottie. I'm a vampire but my teeth are straight and white. I have pale white skin. I'm also a witch, and I go to a magic school called Hogwarts in England where I'm in the seventh year (I'm seventeen). I'm a goth (in case you couldn't tell) and I wear mostly black. I love Hot Topic and I buy all my clothes from there. For example today I was wearing a black corset with matching lace around it and a black leather miniskirt, pink fishnets and black combat boots. I was wearing black lipstick, white foundation, black eyeliner and red eye shadow. I was walking outside Hogwarts. It was snowing and raining so there was no sun, which I was very happy about. A lot of preps stared at me. I put up my middle finger at them.

**worlds-okayest666** (7): a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!)

**anothertown** (6.5): The way I thought this was going to be “wake me up inside”.... Respect to Ebony Dark'ness Dementia Raven Way though

**bulforster** (5.2): Despite this inspiring a historic work of literature, somehow all my Evanescence nostalgia got concentrated onto Bring Me to Life because this isn't doing much for me now.

**J\_Toe** (5): i ws never a goth. can someone tell me which came first: this, or the Potter fan fiction?

**poppinmmolly** (5): kinda boring!! Inspired the most iconique fanfic of all time but...NEXT

**vayyiqra** (4): Hi my name is Ebony Dark’ness Dementia Raven Way and I have long ebony black hair (that’s how I got my name) with purple streaks and red tips that reaches my mid-back and icy blue eyes like limpid tears and a lot of people tell me I look like Amy Lee (AN: if u don’t know who she is get da hell out of here!).

**BlueMetalWave** (10): There are people who have cried listening to this song and there are people who are lying.

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this always hits so hard...truly a timeless classic and deserved higher than #6 in whatever rate it was in

**helpimbeing** (10): Oh I LOVE emo ballads.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media1.tenor.com/images/8c79e7d7bab1d324c92bd4100a77847b/tenor.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): A piano ballad that I an get behind. Shoutout to the first line.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): have i given out too many 10's in this rate yet? amy's voice is so hauntingly beautiful and strong it gives me goosebumps every time

**timothy444** (10): Gave it a 10 last time I rated this and now I'm giving it a 10 again.

**twat\_brained** (10): I'm disappointed they didn't do this live at the festival I saw them at last year but nothing could take away from this song's impeccable quality

**ditacarlita** (9.5): I heard this song on the radio the other day actually and I laughed at the thought of something like this being popular now. It is a beautiful song.

**materialqirl** (9.5): emo ptsd

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): A staple ballad, the song just aches and everything about it (save the production which is a bit dated) just works perfectly

**runaway3212** (9.5): This song is so good, it's hard to believe, it's insanely beautiful.

**1998tweety** (9): the amount of emotion in this song....Carly Rae Jepsen - Too Much.mp3

**waluigiest** (9): Amy Lee is an absolute legend

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): thirteen-year-old angsty teenage me loved this song. And i still low-key love it now. I just decided to put it back in my existential angst playlist

**bandnitos** (8): the apple music playlist had the wrong version so i had to actually search for it but fuck it was worth it like can we talk about how fucking heartbreaking this song is but i had to dock off a couple points bc the vocal production's weird like the bridge ??? something's not right

**vhqv1997** (8): This song took a bit long to get to its climax but when it did, it was beautiful.

**CritneySpearz** (7.5): Queen of immortality we stan a god

#Wake me up inside

**CarlieScion** (7): i never really "got" evanescence

**roxieloxie** (6.7): im not a ballad hoe im sorry

**rickikardashian** (6): I was able to visualize a Disney edit to this song while listening to this

**alwayswords** (4): tbh i have no idea how feel about this song

**gannade** (3): this is really boring sorry i know this is like their only other known song

**kappyko** (3): sit DOooOOOwwwn... be HumBlEEEEEEEEEEEEE. this isnt the song i came here to stan... this is a fucking ballad.......... its fine though

**RandomHypnotica** (2): My Immortally boring song that feels like it’ll never end

**nightjesus** (1): I’m sorry but this song is so boring. I’ve never liked and I doubt at this point it ever will.

Echoes was submitted from Popheads Worldvision, where it placed at #6. I could say the same thing about Forevermore here - poor Lola Marsh had an uphill battle facing off against so many well known artists and songs, and she came up short. Interestingly enough though, Echoes is placing higher than Forevermore, despite the opposite happening in the Worldvision rate. Neat!

---

#I live off the echoes of your "I Love You"s

**BlueMetalWave** (10): A fantastic surprise, loved it.

**CarlieScion** (10): this is a big BOP

**ManofOranges** (10): Holy hell this is a hit.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Lana Del Rey but good

**bandnitos** (9): holy shit she sounds so much like lana del rey im not saying that as like "she's stealing her brand" she just sounds really similar anyway this slaps

**nightjesus** (9): Ohhh this gives me chills. I very much love this chorus. I very much like her voice. And a new album was released this year? This makes me super excited.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Wtf she literally sounds like early Lana, stan that.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i've never heard of them before but this was pretty good, i might have to check them out

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Took a couple listens for it to click but click it did

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Lana Del Rey but make it upbeat

**twat\_brained** (8): I don't remember what this sounds like but I like the Lana-esque vocals from the lead vocalist so I'll just give it an 8

**vhqv1997** (8): There isn't nearly enough actual echo in this song, such false marketing

**waluigiest** (8): this little surf rock guitar riff is so fun

**anothertown** (7.5): makes me want to ride a horse

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): she sounds weirdly like early career lana here

**vayyiqra** (7): I've never heard this band before but this is like a Lana song produced by MGMT and I think I like it.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): I'll be honest, I just got lost in the groove, but I completely forgot about anything this song had seconds later.

La La Land was submitted from the Disney Golden Generation rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 9.124. The first single from Demi's debut album is an absolute banger where she speaks upon her new fame and how it doesn't change ~who she is~. It's definitely a cute bop but like with the Jonas Brothers, it's a bit of a specific taste to be a fan of something like this with its very Disney thematics. Still, I absolutely adore Demi with pop rock instrumentation and it would be a dream come true for her to do something with that again in the future.

---

#THAT'S JUST ME!

**alwayswords** (10): i used to listen to this on loop while playing webkinz… the memories yup yup

**anothertown** (10): I loved this pop-rock for her.. Her younger brighter voice sounded so good barrelling through these huge bops.

**bandnitos** (10): her magnum opus

**fadedblue09** (10): Why was this picked over Don’t Forget???

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://media.giphy.com/media/etOX3h7ApZuDe7Fc5w/giphy.gif

**ManofOranges** (10): This is just a wonderful song, plain and simple. Only thing I don't understand is that in some versions I hear Demi say "McDonald's" rather than "at Ronald's" and I feel like that just is so degrading to the song

**nightjesus** (10): DEMI WAS ROBBED OF THIS RATE. The fact Selena Gomez’s NATURALLY won over THIS? I have never been more disappointed in this sub. It still freaking hurts.

**rickikardashian** (10): okay but this song is kinda self aware and all, I'm shocked

**roxieloxie** (10): rip to our rate when this and dont forget split the 11s and allowed naturally to win because it was the only good selena song in the lineup

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Sorry if my rockism is showing but God I wish that Demi stuck with the rock sounds from her debut bc they’re infinitely more interesting than what she does now

**timothy444** (10): Her energetic vocal performance in La La Land slayed me. It's pure pop-rock goodness here!

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): this is such an incredible song to come from a disney star??? i was so shook when it first came out

**1998tweety** (9): This is such a tune. Love the rock production and the guitar solos work well.

**bespectacIed** (9): pop punk demi had the tea

**CarlieScion** (9): this has the same quality of force-belting as the katy perry song

**DaHumanTorch** (9): i miss pop/rock demi SO much, :waiting: for her to return to it I BEG

**dnugs\_** (9): this song has aged so well

**sweetnsoursauce1** (9): bring back pop-rock Demi

**waluigiest** (9): imo this song showed she was not your average Disney star and was ready to break out

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): Where did this Demi go like this is actually such a serve

**twat\_brained** (8.7): can we just have rock Demi back for THREE songs?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): major east northumberland high vibes

**skargardin** (8): Bopp

#Stanned Tess in Camp Rock

**poppinmmolly** (8): sorry I don't love this like everyone else does

**bulforster** (6.2): This is cute but shallow in kind of a precursor to the modern 'Woke Disney' thing.

**ditacarlita** (6): I've never listened to Demi and I'm highly amused by this song and the album cover because this is not what I think of when I think of Demi Lovato. Oh I just figured out that Sorry Not Sorry song is by her. Added to playlist. La La Land not added. Sorry not sorry.

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i prefer the film

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): if I had discovered this song at like twelve I would've probably loved it

**BlueMetalWave** (5): A bit boring.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): I'm sorry, but ESPECIALLY in comparison with Burnin' Up this just feels fucking dated. It's a more upbeat Sit Still, Look Pretty.

**helpimbeing** (5): This is very Disney Channel and that's all I'll say.

**vayyiqra** (5): More edgy music for 12 year olds. Demi eats McDonald's, therefore she is Not Like Other Girls. Okay, I shouldn't be too hard on her, she's had a hard time lately. I really don't like any of her older music though, before Demi when she went electropop.

**yourfacesucksass** (5): dear god not this no

**CritneySpearz** (4): annoying song I’m so sorry Debbie lactose

**SFbby** (4): Sounds like a very kiddie version of Blown Away

**vhqv1997** (4): Demi was more mature here than she is now

In The End was submitted from the Aughties Rock Bands rate, where it placed at #3 with an average of 9.266. One of the most well known songs ever I would say - anyone could recite the iconic chorus of "I tried so hard, and got so far, but in the end, it doesn't even matter". In a way, that could be used to describe this song's performance in rates. It nearly won its first one, but Linkin Park's rock sound and style of rapping and singing just doesn't mesh well with the popheads audience, and as such it is the final song out on day 1.

---

#I TRIED SO HARD

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): Does anything need to be said for this song? No, right? OK.

**sweetnsoursauce1** (10): ya'll better give this emo anthem the respect it deserves

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i love being emo!!!

**vhqv1997** (10): I won't ever forget that you guys let 8 Linkin Park songs leave in a row at the start of the rate

**Compulsively\_Epic** (9.5): ouch

**1998tweety** (9): It may have got memed but it still a great song

**DaHumanTorch** (9): still so sad about what happened ugh...another classic though, i loved this when i was younger

**ditacarlita** (9): the year is 1999 and I'm way too into Christina Aguilera to even pay music like this any attention, fast forward 6 years I'm on MySpace and still think music like this sucks because I'm only into "real" punk, thank god we move on from such tomfoolery as we age

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://thumbs.gfycat.com/FlimsyGraveHarborseal-size_restricted.gif

**timothy444** (9): This rock classic is an exemplary example of how the pop punk scene has bloomed into something great. It may not be everyone's cup of tea but you can't deny just how much of an impact it made in the 2000's music era.

**twat\_brained** (8.5): I always feel sad after hearing this knowing Chester's no longer with us but like IMAGINE if we'd rated Meteora, Numb would've been right up there.

**anothertown** (8): Timeless lyrics

**nightjesus** (8): Listing to this just really fucking hurts to be honest. Rip Chester.

**roxieloxie** (8): halfway through listening to this i realised this isnt One Step Closer and im kinda salty but either way its fine cause this is kinda a bop

**vayyiqra** (8): I hate rap-rock, and yet I love this album and this song. I don't want to give it bonus points just because the singer died, but it still adds a lot knowing that he's singing about depression from a very personal place, and it's just ... :frowning:

**helpimbeing** (7.5): angry middle schooler noises

**runaway3212** (7.5): A bit too intense for me yet it's one of Linkin Park's best

**CritneySpearz** (7): edgy teen bop

#IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER

**ReallyCreative** (7.4): I mean, I was in middle school once but that doesn't mean I look back on it fondly, there are much better Linkin Park songs out there

**BlueMetalWave** (7): The lyrics are strong but the genre isn't my thing.

**materialqirl** (7): same as above

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I really like the chorus but the rest of the song I just don’t care for

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): like the lyrics. The rest not so much

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): This song reminds me of a middle school boys locker room fresh with a spritz of axe body spray

**CarlieScion** (5): the chorus is good but the verses r kinda rough

**waluigiest** (5): corny tbh

**bandnitos** (4): im sorry i just really don't like it

**fadedblue09** (4): Never really liked them tbh.

**kappyko** (4): YES! YES YES YES!!!!! oh this got eh near the end
