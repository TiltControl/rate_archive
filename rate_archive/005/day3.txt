I don't remeber even hearing this song tbh. “I’ve always been a Linkin Park fan, don’t @ me. This song is on their worst album, but it’s probably the best song on it at least. The more electronic elements fit well with the crunching guitars and Chester Bennington’s rough vocals. Mike Shinoda’s rapping doesn’t always fit the song but it does pretty well here, too.” - /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

“on one hand, linkin park, on the other hand, linkin park” - /u/lowercase_thoughts

“Eh, this is a sweet enough love song. It's cheesy, to be sure, but it's the right kind of cheese, where you know there's something to it. It's by no means great, but I don't think a song like this has to be.” -- /u/Jopalopa

#49. Maroon 5 - Moves Like Jagger (ft. Christina Aguilera)

Average: 5.831. Controversy: 2.228. My score: 7. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NOBVEq_Bi5k) Highest scores: (10x3): PM-ME-YOUR-KITTENS, 3rdattemptuse, NapsAndNetflix; (9.5x1): yatcho; (9x2): dirdbub, whatsapilot. Lowest scores: (0.8x1): Dr_Brewer; (1x3): mindnoises, joshually, TeamAwesome4; (2x2): KobeOrNotKobe, leafsnash61

Comments:
This is supremely catchy, but it's a a complete sellout.


“I actually like parts of this song. The whistle and the guitar in the beginning are easily the best part, but once it stops sounding like actual instruments it kinda loses me. Adam Levine is just kinda there on this song, the concept feels so forced, and Christina sounds terrible. I feel like that one decent musical idea at the beginning saves this song from being a train wreck. Still, it’s mostly just forgettable so it’s not that bad.” -- /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus


“I've been dragging Maroon 5 this whole rating for being safe and predictable but damn if they don't make perfect pop music sometimes” -- /u/yatcho


“It's good for maybe the first couple listens, but it gets stale after sometime. Also, I don't think it does Christina any good whenever she's a featured artist, because she usually sounds out-of-place. She's better off in solo songs.” -- /u/hellomochi

Comments:
I love the feel of this more than the actual song.

“EDM really suits Usher's voice. I hope his future songs are more like this.” --/u/hellomochi

“forgettable and generic. kinda expected more from Guetta in this era, now? completely expected” -- /u/dirdbub

“On the higher end of the David Guetta scale, thanks in no small part to Usher, who really should do more EDM collaborations. I mean, it's nothing spectacular, but it's fun and I want to see more songs like it.” -- /u/Jopalopa

[/r/popheads/comments/5dv4ww/rate_day_3_of_the_billboard_hot_100_2012_rate/da7lye3/]

=====

MihaMijat: Okay so lemme start 


1) Implying I have bad taste just because others didn't agree with me is pretty lame so try harder hun


2) The songs I loved were Stereo Hearts, One More Night, Payphone and Moves Like Jagger which were all massive hits so it's not just "my taste"


3) "Get your ears checked"? Are you like 12? 


Also, check where your fave is right now before trying to drag the biggest band in the world atm hun bye

TeamAwesome4: Ok, so, 

1) It's a joke, and not a particularly biting one at that.

=====

TeamAwesome4: Actually, wait.  As of that dismissive response, I'm not done yet.  This kind of light insult is more than common in these rates, and you should know that by now.  You're calling me out for implying you have bad taste when you're telling someone to "drag these fuckers to hell and back", literally implying that the songs we like are bad also.  Get off your high horse.  And there's no reason to @ me in your next 10 comments.  And you're calling me 12, smh.

Also, my fave is Phil Collins, not Kesha, one of 3 artists to sell 100 million artists as both a band and a solo artist, alongside the legendary Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney.  When will your fave?
[/r/popheads/comments/5dv4ww/rate_day_3_of_the_billboard_hot_100_2012_rate/da7oxn3/]

=====

MihaMijat: First of all, it wasn't a "light insult", you were being a dick.

Second, MrSwearword drags everybody, so I just supported him, I don't see what the problem with that sentence is so stop putting words in my mouth.

Third, my fave is still relevant when will yours
[/r/popheads/comments/5dv4ww/rate_day_3_of_the_billboard_hot_100_2012_rate/da7pj0q/]

=====

TeamAwesome4: Literally the worst thing that I could have implied is that your taste in music is bad.  That's not worth calling someone a dick over when literally the entire point of this is to discuss music taste and how it's different from other people's.  You may not see the problem with your sentence, and I don't see a problem with it either.  I also don't see a problem with mine, because they're synonymous.  You're holding me to a different standard than you hold yourself, and it seems like you're going out of your way to demonize me for something that, at worst, is a little bit off putting.

When Ari is relevant across 3 decades we'll talk.  You can't just say "Present Day" to win an argument.  Or we could talk #1's.  Artists are different, and bringing them into this argument was petty AF.

Regardless, this is the last response you're getting from me.  You're eating up my enjoyment of the night.

MihaMijat: The funny thing is, you were the one bragging about your faves 100 milion, when the only thing I said about my faves sales was to imply how it's not "my bad taste". Whatever man if you don't see how you were being dickish, there is no point in continuing this conversation. Have a nice night.

HERE WE GO

>Drinking a German beer with a Cuban cigar

BOB IS CLEARLY A CULTURED MAN WHO RESPECTS THE FINER ASPECTS OF LIFE

>In the middle of Paris with a Dominican broad

>Great head on her shoulders,she probably studied abroad

>She transferred to Harvard from King's College in March

THIS INCLUDES FINE WOMEN

>She says that I'm her favorite, cause she admires the art

>Of Michelangelo with the flow, Picasso with the bars

JUST IN CASE YOU DIDNT GET THE IDEA THAT BOB WAS CULTURED HERE ARE SOME DEEP ART METAPHORS THAT MAKE A TON OF FUCKING SENSE

>She's well put together like a piece by Gershwin

OH WOW GUESS WHAT BOB LIKES FINE WOMEN

I actually love the feel of this song, and Bruno is fantastic.

This song clever af. And The Wanted could get it at anytime.

“okay, I was gunna make a one-off pun about the song title and lyrics, but apparently The Wanted is a boy band? I thought it was just one shitty singer? but it’s five? my high school’s “take-this-class-and-get-an-easy-ass-A” choir would probably pull off a better rendition than these five fuck offs” -- /u/dirdbub

Comments:

Nicki is on this and i adore it. Automatically gets a high score.

“Ok Nicki is on this song but I can barely tell. Guettabot processed her so much and sucked every last bit of personality out of her. When she raps a little near the end I wished she did more of it, because the rest of it is just another David Guetta song.” -- /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

“Probably when I started getting on the Nicki train. Although I don't believe that is actually her singing AT ALL.” -- /u/joshually

“David Guetta’s best radio hit in my opinion, and I remember singing this so often with my sister. I love this one” -- /u/SkyBlade79

A song. She snatched my wig tbh.

“Honestly, this choice of an 11 might say more about my personal life than anything else I've posted on Reddit. But yeah, this is absolutely fantastic. It's dark, it's dangerous, it's relatable, it's catchy, it's got all the best elements of country and pop, and it provides a frisson experience that only a scant few songs I've heard can match. This song is damn near magical.” -- /u/Jopalopa

“When will she take time off from shilling snack products and start producing songs like this again?” -- /u/hellomochi

“Another song I forgot existed, but catchy none the less” -- /u/JoeThaMo

“Back Jessie J was Katy Perry, but better” -- /u/ImADudeDuh

thegeecyproject: I get the feeling that *Viva La Vida or Death And All His Friends* was the last Coldplay album to sound anything like a "rock" album. After that, I felt like they were just experimenting with different kinds of pop. Not that it's a bad thing, but there's an obvious difference in sound in those albums.

deleted: someone here in this sub said that Coldplay is just a shell of what they used to be, and I agree

with Parachutes they were just a soul without a shell

the shell then started to gradually form itself with every album, being complete by Viva La Vida or Death And All His Friends 

after that the shell cracked and ther soul started to leak out of it, culminating in what we have today

i'm not high or drunk btw

JustGiveMeaReeses: While I agree that Linkin Park is amaaaaazing, I feel like Burn It Down is one of their weaker songs, especially from that album. 

And Paradise is INCREDIBLE.
