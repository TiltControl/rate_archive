ExtraEater: The final night in this massive bloodbath of a rate. May the best song win.

**PREDICTIONS**

Definitely In Top 10:

* Call Me Maybe (you can't drag this beyond Top 10)

* Lights (nearly every prediction has lights on it, plus the song is good)

* We Found Love (duh)

* Ni\*\*as In Paris (nobody really hates jay-z/kanye/hip-hop on this sub)

* Rolling In The Deep (it's adele duh)

* Someone Like You (it's adele duh)

Likely In Top 10:

* The One That Got Away (like seriously get in the top 10)

* Love You Like A Love Song (not my kind of song but it would fit in top 10)

* Good Time (carly bias can carry a song far, but it's probably going to be 15-11)

* Die Young (we like ke$ha and this song is flawless)

* Take Care (duh)

* Diamonds (i mean it's a rihanna song and it's good)

* Titanium (sia can carry a song far, if wild ones is any indication)

* Somebody That I Used To Know (this one's a big *maybe*)

* Mercy (it's kanye, but is it really top 10-worthy, though?)

Personally, These Need to Go NOW:

* Where Have You Been (this song is so lame)

* Rumour Has It (only ok adele song on the list)

* Paradise (i'm rooting for it, but it doesn't deserve Top 20)

Surprisingly, all 25 songs are pretty strong contenders. I really can't tell what will be out first. Furthermore, I still don't know what will be #1 bc Call Me Maybe is most likely getting *dragged* and the #2 will take its place.

Comments:

Imagine Dragons' best song by far. 

“I feel like Imaginary Dragons is actually a country band pretending to be some weird EDM-rock big-arena band or something. I see you, Imaginary Dragons.” -- /u/joshually

“doesn’t hold up anymore, kind of reminds me of embarrassing cringey teenage emotions” -- /u/calltehshots

“I like this song a surprising amount. It feels genuinely emotional and while the lyrics are kinda cliched I think they fit. The production, with the subtle background synths and booming Imagine Dragons drums, works well. Not a bad song at all.” -- /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

“Idk why, but this is a fucking awesome song, and I have no idea why, but it is” -- /u/ImADudeDuh

“I feel like this might be a better song than I'm giving it credit for. I mean, to me, this is a good-sounding song that I can't really connect to or find reason to want to listen to more Miguel. But yeah, maybe that's just because I'm, well, me.” -- /u/Jopalopa

Comments:

I love this so much. The acapella stuff works so well.

“There's something about this song that's so obnoxious. Maybe it's the fact that the singer always sounds like he's trying to jam his vocals down my gullet via my eyes or something.” -- /u/joshually

“Loved the acapella intro. Retains that anthem-like quality from "We Are Young" -- /u/hellomochi

“I find Nate Ruess a very uninteresting vocalist but this song is decent.” -- /u/leafsnash61

“WTF was that congo drums in the middle of the song somebody at editing messed up bad and THAT GODawful autotuned BS. Tries to do too many things at once and fails at all. ABSOLUTE TRASH” -- /u/candyninja32

One of Rihanna's best songs! This was amazing.

“rihanna i been here the whole time look harder plz” -- /u/OberionSynth

Comments:

Selena's best song. And she'll never do any better than this.

“Yeah, Selena's done a lot better, but this isn't too bad. It's reasonably catchy, and I suppose the romantic lyrics are okay. It's just that... well, Selena seems to do this a lot, y'know? She makes an awful lot of generally decent music that doesn't provide an incentive to relisten. And she has enough good songs to really make that a shame.” -- /u/Jopalopa

“This song will forever remind me of being a little hoebag at the clubs because the video played every single time I was out, which was like 5 times a week, making out with random dudes, sloshed out of my mind. This was probably the theme song of my hookerdom, which is ironic because there was nothing happening remotely similar to love.” -- /u/joshually

Comments:

An amazing rap song that has some of the best lines ever.

“OH OH OH OK LAMBURGINI MERCY YO CHICK SHE SO THIRSTY IN THAT 2 SEAT LAMBO WITH YO GIRL TRYNA JERK ME” -- /u/KobeOrNotKobe

“Solid song. The production is top-notch and that sample really adds something.” -- /u/hellomochi

“Some of Kanye's most underrated bars ever is, "Talking bout Mary, she gone off that molly / now the whole party is melted like Dali / now everybody is moving they body / don't sell me apartment, I move in the lobby". Also Sean's verse is hilarious, 2 Chainz's verse is hilarious, and Pusha T's verse is hype as fuck.” -- /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah

“BANGER BANGER BANGER! this combo of artists is just LETHAL, one of the best rap collabs ever” -- /u/dirdbub

“...look, I like Kanye. He seems like a cool guy. But I'm sorry, most of his music flies completely over my head. I mean, this definitely has a good sound, and I'm sure his fans have perfectly good reasons for loving it, but it's just not my thing.” -- /u/Jopalopa

Comments:

This is a fantastic song. Not her best but still incredible.

“As the little sister of the attention-whore manic-depressive Someone Like You, Set Fire To The Rain was super talented, had a gregarious personality, and was probably prettier than her older sis, but unfortunately, on their parents' 40th anniversary celebration, sigh again none of the spotlight was on her.” -- /u/joshually

“Not a fan of Adele, and it has the same message as all of her songs. That being said, this is my favorite single she’s released” --/u/SkyBlade79

“I don’t usually like Adele but her voice really fits perfectly on top of the great orchestration. Those strings are fire.” -- /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

“21 is her best album, no doubt. will always love it” -- /u/dirdbub

“YES! DAVID’S BEST SONG! I don’t think he can put out a better song than this, it’s just a pure banger that aged well” -- /u/dirdbub

I love this. Best number-one song of 2012 tbh.

“This song was so different from everything else on the radio at the time” -- /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah

“I liked this song when it dropped and it holds up years later imo. It does a really nice job with showing the ego trips and blaming that happen in an ugly breakup and the minimal but well done instrumentation.” -- /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus

“I honestly just really dislike Gotye's voice, sorry Popheads :(“ -- /u/JoeThaMo

I adore this, Rihanna is literal perfection.

“Ahead of its time in the worst way possible. This would blend in perfectly with the middle-of-the-road Billboard hits of 2016.” -- /u/Jopalopa

“This pushed Rihanna firmly into A-list superstardom. Like a floozy trying to get impregnated during the peak of her ovulation period Rihanna jumped on top of the EDM trend at just the right time.” -- /u/joshually (sorry but she already was.)

“Almost no lyrical content, but it still works somehow. Rihanna on high notes just sounds really good” -- /u/BearlyEvenAPun

Comments:
  This song is literally perfect. My favorite song ever. I don't think there's anybody more perfect to do this song than Drake and Rih. I'm sad that it isn't #1 but at least it's in the top 10.
  “God bless Jamie xx for this beat” -- /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah
  “rihanna you can definitely take care of me bby” -- /u/OberionSynth
  "Drake X Rih collabs are always GOAT, love the chemistry between those two” -- /u/JoeThaMo
  “the best song of the year/an A+ emotional bop” -- /u/calltehshots
  “This song is near perfection, Drizzy and RiRi at their best.” -- /u/yatcho
  “this song was alright! nothing to play on repeat, but it’s good” -- /u/dirdbub
  “This song is great, but it might be a bit too great, if that makes any sense. I'm reminded of a Billy Joel lyric: "I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints, the sinners are much more fun." This song honestly sounds more like it descended from the heavens than was written by mortals, and yeah, that's great, it's a great song, it's just... eh, I probably sound crazy. It's great, let's leave it at that.” -- /u/Jopalopa

Comments: 

I love this song. This should’ve hit number-one. 

“Fun party music that's actually good to boot. Who woulda thunk it?” - /u/snidelaughter. 

“The way she sings “Oh, what a shame that you came here with someone” is delicious, cuz she doesn’t really care, and you know she doesn’t really care. Listening to this song in the context of the other 2012 hits made me miss Kesha so much more than I already do. I’m gonna go listen to Warrior again.” - /u/TeamAwesome4

"BOPS FOR DAYS. this is one of Kesha’s best songs, fucking goes OFF" - /u/dirdbub

Comments: 

A perfect rap song. 

“Kanye & Beyoncè's husband 😍” - /u/TheAfricAsian

 “Literally every line is classic, I think I like Jay's verse more than Kanye's but of course Kanye made the song with his "that shit crays" and the part at the end. Kanye's delivery of "Excuse my French, but I’m in France, I’m just sayin' / Prince Williams ain’t do it right if you ask me, cause if I was him I would have married Kate and Ashley" is hilarious.” - /u/FuckUpSOmeCommasYeah

I really like this song. It’s not as good as Ass Back Home, but it’s still pretty good. /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah calls it the “opposite of Ass Back Home, hook sucks, Travie McCoy's verses are ok” /u/whatsapilot drags it saying “ ’Good music can be so hard to find’ well this is a terrible place to start, and so is pretty much any single Adam Levine has been in during the past few years.” “Fuck Travie McCoy. Fuck “Yeah, yeah, that’s right”. Fuck the “Haha” after every one of his awful puns. Fuck his inability to move past a single metaphor, instead making it sound more and more dumb the ‘deeper’ he goes. Fuck his stupid little insincere faux-inspirational spoken-word bridges. Fuck the fact that the US ditched him after 2012 but I distinctly remember having to suffer through his fucking solo career for another 3 years as he pumped out more mediocre shite. Fuck this absolute hack.” - /u/camerinian.

I love the atmosphere of this song more than anything in the whole world. It just sounds amazing.

I challenge all 14,000+ popheads to find another song with the same exact wonderful aesthetic as Lights and does it well. Lights should be #1.” -/u/ExtraEater. AKA the only comment this song needs.

ExtraEater: GUYS, I hacked into nerdy's google account and found the real #1 before he apparently rigged it! Here it is, word for word:

>#1 - Ellie Goulding - Lights

>Average: 9.722 Controversy score: almost nonexistent My score: 10

>Highest scores (11 x1): ExtraEater (10.9 x1): elxtreme (10 x77): *everyone else* (9 x1): kickit

>Lowest scores (0 x1): Kaphox (1 x1): MrSwearword (5 x1): dirdbub

>[Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F-dSVWRTb2Q)

>“Queen of synths.” - BreezySeason

>Wow I’m so surprised this won. Really, I can’t express how shocked I am. I figured it would be an actually recognizable pop star but this is fine. Anyway, it's a fantastic song and a fitting winner for such an... interesting rate. If any song has the right to claim the title as the winner of r/popheads’ most massive rate, it’s this.

>ExtraEater gives it their 11, saying it's "the obvious choice but the only real choice". KometBlu says, "That synth line works amazing as an intro to the album. The public really fucked up by not making this the hit song of 2010." At least it went Top 10 on Billboard 2012 hihi. breadvelvet has a confession to make: "the powerful synth actually turned me off the first time I heard it (something about the timbre feels off and a bit unnatural), but I grew to love it somehow along with the rest of Ellie's discography. I think it’s definitely a ballsy intro track to the US edition of the album and rousing, though I do wish the chorus melody moved around a bit more. I think the song is kinda overrated, so I'm giving it a 10 instead of an 11 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯"

>elxtreme just says "YES" and slaps down a 10.9. smh at not rounding it out. MrSwearword, on the other side of things, is shaking and crying once more: "THE LIGHTS IT TURNED TO STONE... THE LIGHTS..." angusaditus says he "loves it, but not that much. I'll give it a 10, but not an 11," and kickit gives y'all a lecture: “I don't see this song as the standout track some users on /r/popheads wants it to be. I think anyone who wants to compare this to Run Away With Me or Bad Romance or whatever is delusional and trying to pull an immaculate song off this great album and focusing on the wrong song anyway. I like this song, but I think it's sorely overrated.”

>Regardless, TheAllRightGatsby calls it "the bop of a generation, sans Run Away With Me ofc," and OberionSynth says, "bass made my asshole shiver" (???) Altiondsols throws a bit of shade, saying it's "the only powerful opening track on any of these albums." Leave Rolling In The Deep out of this! JoeThaMo says, "Almost got my 11 but, just like with the country songs, it's gonna get enough attention from popheads even without my vote." Well, you could say that again.

>*Note to Self: Hide this and rig the rate so Lights does not end up being #1*

SkyBlade79: 11 people saying that they liked it the most isn't really representative of anything except for those actual people. I mean, just imagine the number of us who like Cupcakke on first listen compared to the majority of people.

However, what was really interesting, was how Lights got a substantially higher vote in a strawpoll that somebody put out than RITD. 
[/r/popheads/comments/5e0f3m/rate_day_4_of_the_billboard_2012_ranking/da94370/]

=====

ImADudeDuh: Ayyy my strawpoll got a mention! Also, I think it's mainly because more people wanted Lights to win because it was the Dark Horse, for a few reasons: Ellie isn't as big a star as Adele, Lights never made it to #1 ^^^NotEvenHere , and Lights is less remembered than RitD. 

So I think of it as if RAwM vs Into You where people would rather have RAwM win since Into You was such a big hit compared to it.
