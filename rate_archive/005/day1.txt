A boring stereotype of a song, not even exceptionally bad, except for the fact that he wants to fuck his truck. /u/Candyninja32 says “The title that defines country music.” /u/camerinian states: “Okay for real what is country music’s obsession with corn. Like I get the whole farm thing, but it’s never a wheat field or dairy farm it’s always fucking corn.”  “This song definitely succeed in lowering my IQ level.” – /u/PandoraKris, I agree. /u/Jopalopa is accurate in his description, “This song fails simply by virtue of waiting half the song before getting to the hook. Kip Moore really wants all those bro-country tropes to stick in your mind. Well, stick they did, goddamn.” /u/NapsandNetflix has basically the only positive comment here:” Kip Moore is underrated in the country community, so I can't even imagine what will happen here.” He places last, that’s what. /u/JoeThaMo gets pretty dark, “good thing I'm mostly over my depression because I'm pretty sure this thing would have pushed me over the edge.” Jesus.

Luke Bryan is the worst, so this automatically received at best a 3, nut this was so awful, so it went down to a 1 quickly. /u/Mother_rucker succinctly says “fuck you and your bro-country, Luke Bryan.” Can’t argue with that. /u/MrSwearWord shady as ever, says “I’d rather pour vodka in my eyes than give this shit another listen.” /u/TeamAwesome4 goes in, “This is a generic country love song. It’s used to get stupid people to bang, specifically, those who identify as “redneck” but live in the suburbs and drive spotless pickup trucks to their job at Kohl’s. Just like those people, this song is insufferable.”/u/ OberianSynth and /u/greenging both scare me:” i hate country but luke bryan is bae” and” Luke Bryan has a great ass”, respectfully. /u/Calltehshots has some common sense however, “i can’t stand this and he looks like a ferret” Tru. /u/Hellomochi has my favorite of the terrible lyric comments: “‘Girl you make my speakers go boom’? Probably the reason why I gave these country songs a low score is because of all the cringeworthy lyrics.” This is valid af.

I don’t have an automatic aversion to Jason Aldean as opposed to Luke Bryan, but this song is trash. Also fuck the USA tbh.  /u/ImADudeDuh eloquently states “Ugghhh” /u/joshually goes in, “This is the modern "America The Beautiful". Nothing's changed since 1821 or whenever that old skool jam was first written - everyone glosses over the dirt, scandal and rampant racism to celebrate our beautiful and powerful nation.” /u/Raykel makes a very good point, “I get he was trying to have a deeper meaning with this song but he ruined it with, "Flirting with the flight attendants." That just makes him look like a douche and I can't take him seriously throughout the rest of the song. Someone in the comments also pointed out that it's the same melody as Love The Way You Lie and now I lost focus of this song thinking how I'd rather be listening to that song.” /u/TeamAwesome4 actually likes it saying “This is a country song with genuine emotion behind it. I would gladly listen to this kind of country all day long.” /u/femaleghostbuster brings up receipts with “Remember that time Jason Aldean did [blackface](http://www.spin.com/2016/09/jason-aldean-lil-wayne-blackface/) for Halloween?”

I truly hate this song with every fiber of my being, even though the actual quality of song isn’t that bad. It’s just overplayed at my job. There were plenty of comments that simply state some variation on “I want this song to end”, which is hilarious and true. /u/mustangs16 says, “the last good song Luke Bryan released”…ok sis. /u/OberianSynth confuses me “you see i hate country but i just have this thing for luke bryan's songs and i will gladly belt this out at three in the morning and annoy the shit out of my neighborhood” Why? /u/jonnl2806 makes a relatable statement: “How I wish Luke Bryan wasn’t a thing” bitchmetoo.gif. /u/cameranian makes an honest plea: “I really wish country singers would stop saying “purrty”, it’s so fucking gross” honestly, truly.

I’ve listened to this like, 7 times and I still don’t remember a thing.  /u/BlasiFeelsSwift has an important question “is this what country America listens to? I pity them.” Same. /u/PandoraKris compliments it, saying “I love country songs that make me feel things, which is something that country haters don't understand lol.” “It's a country song with pop sensibilities. I can hear this being sung by Maroon 5.” - /u/Hellomochi, a drag. There were almost no comments on this song, which speaks to the blandness tbh.

Nerdy_boy_chris: #93. Train - Drive By 

Average Score: 3.527 Controversy score:  2.678 My score: 0.1. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rAPNDjQ3Q28) Highest Scores: (10x1): NapsAndNetflix (9x1): Illuminastrid.

This song is trash, pun intended. Train has always been shitty, but this is by far their worst song. /u/mother_rucker says “These lyrics sound like they were written by a 15-year-old, not someone in their mid-40s. "Our love went viral." C'mon.” /u/snide_laughter is concise, “Fuck Train.” Apt. /u/SkyBlade79 is a tad relatable” my mom likes this song and therefore I cannot” Honestly, truly /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus probably has my favorite comment for this song “This guy is the most annoying lyricist ever. That Hefty Bag line needs to be banished to the deepest parts of hell, along with “everything is groovy” and “MMM the way you do me”. Even without it this is pretty much straight anthem material. The music video has the lead singer driving around fucking wine country, that’s how white this song is. The music video has a THREE LEGGED RACE SCENE, that’s how white this song is. And that’s not even getting to the classic car meetup. Wonderbread tbh.” Therokinrolla is actually positive: “I’m a secret Train stan whaddaboutit” Shame him /r/popheads. /u/NapsAndNetflix continues to be the black sheep of this ranking “The suburban white boy that I am thrives to anything Train puts out, and this is no exception.” As is /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy “Yeah, I am going to be lynched by the subreddit for giving this song such a high score.

This song is incredibly creepy, in a weird way. It got the entire country to sing about giving blowjobs and it wasn’t even a bit subtle. That whistle is incessantly catchy and the guitar near the end is pretty awesome though. /u/whatsapilot gives an interesting perspective “This is so weird. I don’t even passionately hate this song, I just feel like it’s objectively terrible. And that’s coming from someone who never thinks objectively about music.” Raykel says “It's horrible when artists try to make sex PG. Just no, now we got soccer moms singing out loud asking if we can blow their whistles.” /u/NapsAndNetflix keeps the controversy going “king of blowjob insinuations” /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus drags him “This song is gross. I don’t wanna hear about Flo Rida’s dick ever. Even worse is that he decided to not only make a song about getting head, but do it in a really cutesy way. Like it’s the most immature “tee hee he’s talking about his penis” song ever. I don’t even remember anything else from the song. Usually with Flo Rida music you remember the hook and that’s it, and I wish this was the exception because it’s still catchy, and the moment I start subconciously singing about Flo Rida’s blowjob is the moment where my soul dies. Please never sing your own hook again Flo Rida, and never EVER make another song about getting your dick sucked.”

This song is incredibly B O R I N G. This song plays at my job so I hear it on a daily basis and I still hate it. /u/mustangs16 raves “This being r/popheads means this song won't get the score it deserves since it's country but it's legitimately one of my favorite songs EVER.” why. /u/throwaway963963963 makes me laugh so hard “Inspirational, but like, only enough to make me try and remember to drink more water.” Honestly, truly. “This is a really fun feel-good song. Yes, it's got a great country sound and a seriously catchy hook, but what makes it really stand out is the fact that it delivers its "follow your dreams" message in maybe the best way possible, telling it through the singer's own story and encouraging the listener to apply it to their own.

This song is hilarious, but in a bad way, but also in a good way. I probably won’t ever listen to it again, but it’s not terrible. /u/MrSwearword rationally expresses his dislike “This song is the worst piece of shit ever made not named “Don’t Stop Believin’”. It is SATAN IN THE FORM OF MAYONNAISE.” /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus makes an interesting comparison “The country equivalent of Dance (A$$). It’s too funny and ridiculous for me to call it bad. Come at me, Toby > Taylor.”  I don’t agree, but it’s still valid. /u/OberionSynth says “honestly the best song ever released.” /u/candyninja32 is shady af “Feels like this was made with $500, a phone microphone and a beer.”

This song is not as bad as Drive by. But it is still really, really bad. /u/dirdbub says “okay, this is the only good Train song. it’s surprisingly catchy.” /u/JopaLopa is  also very enthusiastic about this song “On some level, I really do wish Train had stuck around beyond their weird three-song comeback. Not only does this have a great sound, Pat Monahan's sad-sack persona is somehow charming instead of annoying here, and the absurdity of the lyrics actually make for a really good comedy song.” “This is the song equivalent of a too-long Adam Sandler movie. Uck. “ - /u/joshually  /u/jonnl2806 gets dark “I wish he actually died, that way this song wouldn’t exist.” /u/ThereIsNotSantaClaus hits it right on the mark “A slightly less horrible song than Drive By but every bit as white.”

I actually like this song, I like the guitar and the sample. The dubstep breaks the song for me though. /u/BlasiFeelsSwift shares some personal information: “hate the song and I once had horrible sex while this was playing in the background, never again.” “Irritatingly catchy” – femaleghostbuster. /u/lowercase_thoughts is very succinct: “numba twoooooooooooooooo” /u/Jopalopa gives a full review: “This just might be the most incompetent song onthe entire list. Pitbull isn't a great rapper, he doesn't know shit about Men in Black, the sample seems wedged in without thought, the weird dubstep breakdown is awful and entirely pointless... I can't think of a single thing this does right.” /u/camerinian has an excellent comment: “Birthed one of Todd In The Shadows’ best episodes, so no matter how bad this song is I can never really hate it”

Nerdy_boy_chris: #81.	Pitbull ft. Chris Brown - International Love 

Average Score: 4.218 Controversy score: 2.671 My score: 7. [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlbB4fY_Im8) Highest scores: (10x2): omgcow, Kaphox. (9x2): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, Illuminastrid. Lowest scores: (1.5x1): bluehxrizon (1.3): MrSwearword (1x18): listeningtosufjan, BlasiFeelsSwift, -nox-, JoshuaReddit, carlybaejepsen, KobeOrNotKobe, gannade, berober04, whatsapilot, Mudkip1, greenging, Awhile2, daybehavior, ExtraEater, lowercase_thoughts, darbythefourth, PuggleMaster, PM-ME-YOUR-KITTENS(0x1): chubs4life. 

I actually really like this song, chorus that only names American cities notwithstanding, Pitbull actually sounds grateful for everything. “everything that has Chris Brown is a 1. I’m not putting the 0 because a) it has Pitbull and I want to do the nasty with him and b) I’m saving the 0 for another song. “ -/u/BlasiFeelsSwift. What. /u/chubs4life drags this song to hell: : “Wth was French poodle thinking? Let me get a hot artist that is loved "internationally" oh I know! Chris Brown! Shame on you. Bad dog.” /u/Therokinrolla defends Pitbull: “everyone here hates Pitbull but he ain't that bad, yo” agreed. /u/Jopalopa makes a good point: “Y'know, there's a place in pop music for stupidity, provided you have the talent and charisma to get away with it. Pitbull and Chris Brown do not. End of story.”

I’m not really a fan of this song, but that’s mainly because I hear it on a regular basis, and I still don’t like it that much. /u/ImADudeDuh raves: “Oh shit, a country song getting an 11? I'll still defend this song forever. This is like the perfect "driving down a long road and just remembering stuff that happened in your life while smiling" song. My only hope is that this gets in the top 50” lol. “Eric Church writes songs about my life - but seriously, as a big Bruce stan this is a really great song and I appreciate it.” - /u/greenging /u/LandonKidatrea says “I appreciate the song's sentiment more than I like the actual song” /u/NapsAndNertflix lays down the law “I gave Shake It Off my 11, and The One That Got Away (Acoustic) my 11 in that ranking. Shake It Off didn't work out too well, and I know Katy won't fair well either. So let’s stick with the trend and throw it to an amazing song that will get out too early. The references to Springsteen songs are perfect, and the Eric Church can do no wrong in my eyes so this rightfully gets my 11 and a pre-emptive fuck you to those who gave this below a 6”

I don’t remember this song at all, really. But I know that this is one of the more tolerable country songs.  /u/Jopalopa says: “Eh, I think I have a soft spot for this.
