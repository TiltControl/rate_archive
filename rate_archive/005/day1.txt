A boring stereotype of a song, not even exceptionally bad, except for the fact that he wants to fuck his truck. /u/Candyninja32 says ‚ÄúThe title that defines country music.‚Äù /u/camerinian states: ‚ÄúOkay for real what is country music‚Äôs obsession with corn. Like I get the whole farm thing, but it‚Äôs never a wheat field or dairy farm it‚Äôs always fucking corn.‚Äù  ‚ÄúThis song definitely succeed in lowering my IQ level.‚Äù ‚Äì /u/PandoraKris, I agree. /u/Jopalopa is accurate in his description, ‚ÄúThis song fails simply by virtue of waiting half the song before getting to the hook. Kip Moore really wants all those bro-country tropes to stick in your mind. Well, stick they did, goddamn.‚Äù /u/NapsandNetflix has basically the only positive comment here:‚Äù Kip Moore is underrated in the country community, so I can't even imagine what will happen here.‚Äù He places last, that‚Äôs what. /u/JoeThaMo gets pretty dark, ‚Äúgood thing I'm mostly over my depression because I'm pretty sure this thing would have pushed me over the edge.‚Äù Jesus.

Luke Bryan is the worst, so this automatically received at best a 3, nut this was so awful, so it went down to a 1 quickly. /u/Mother_rucker succinctly says ‚Äúfuck you and your bro-country, Luke Bryan.‚Äù Can‚Äôt argue with that. /u/MrSwearWord shady as ever, says ‚ÄúI‚Äôd rather pour vodka in my eyes than give this shit another listen.‚Äù /u/TeamAwesome4 goes in, ‚ÄúThis is a generic country love song. It‚Äôs used to get stupid people to bang, specifically, those who identify as ‚Äúredneck‚Äù but live in the suburbs and drive spotless pickup trucks to their job at Kohl‚Äôs. Just like those people, this song is insufferable.‚Äù/u/ OberianSynth and /u/greenging both scare me:‚Äù i hate country but luke bryan is bae‚Äù and‚Äù Luke Bryan has a great ass‚Äù, respectfully. /u/Calltehshots has some common sense however, ‚Äúi can‚Äôt stand this and he looks like a ferret‚Äù Tru. /u/Hellomochi has my favorite of the terrible lyric comments: ‚Äú‚ÄòGirl you make my speakers go boom‚Äô? Probably the reason why I gave these country songs a low score is because of all the cringeworthy lyrics.‚Äù This is valid af.

I don‚Äôt have an automatic aversion to Jason Aldean as opposed to Luke Bryan, but this song is trash. Also fuck the USA tbh.  /u/ImADudeDuh eloquently states ‚ÄúUgghhh‚Äù /u/joshually goes in, ‚ÄúThis is the modern "America The Beautiful". Nothing's changed since 1821 or whenever that old skool jam was first written - everyone glosses over the dirt, scandal and rampant racism to celebrate our beautiful and powerful nation.‚Äù /u/Raykel makes a very good point, ‚ÄúI get he was trying to have a deeper meaning with this song but he ruined it with, "Flirting with the flight attendants." That just makes him look like a douche and I can't take him seriously throughout the rest of the song. Someone in the comments also pointed out that it's the same melody as Love The Way You Lie and now I lost focus of this song thinking how I'd rather be listening to that song.‚Äù /u/TeamAwesome4 actually likes it saying ‚ÄúThis is a country song with genuine emotion behind it. I would gladly listen to this kind of country all day long.‚Äù /u/femaleghostbuster brings up receipts with ‚ÄúRemember that time Jason Aldean did [blackface](http://www.spin.com/2016/09/jason-aldean-lil-wayne-blackface/) for Halloween?‚Äù

This song is trash, pun intended. Train has always been shitty, but this is by far their worst song. /u/mother_rucker says ‚ÄúThese lyrics sound like they were written by a 15-year-old, not someone in their mid-40s. "Our love went viral." C'mon.‚Äù /u/snide_laughter is concise, ‚ÄúFuck Train.‚Äù Apt. /u/SkyBlade79 is a tad relatable‚Äù my mom likes this song and therefore I cannot‚Äù Honestly, truly /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus probably has my favorite comment for this song ‚ÄúThis guy is the most annoying lyricist ever. That Hefty Bag line needs to be banished to the deepest parts of hell, along with ‚Äúeverything is groovy‚Äù and ‚ÄúMMM the way you do me‚Äù. Even without it this is pretty much straight anthem material. The music video has the lead singer driving around fucking wine country, that‚Äôs how white this song is. The music video has a THREE LEGGED RACE SCENE, that‚Äôs how white this song is. And that‚Äôs not even getting to the classic car meetup. Wonderbread tbh.‚Äù Therokinrolla is actually positive: ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a secret Train stan whaddaboutit‚Äù Shame him /r/popheads. /u/NapsAndNetflix continues to be the black sheep of this ranking ‚ÄúThe suburban white boy that I am thrives to anything Train puts out, and this is no exception.‚Äù As is /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy ‚ÄúYeah, I am going to be lynched by the subreddit for giving this song such a high score.

This song is incredibly creepy, in a weird way. It got the entire country to sing about giving blowjobs and it wasn‚Äôt even a bit subtle. That whistle is incessantly catchy and the guitar near the end is pretty awesome though. /u/whatsapilot gives an interesting perspective ‚ÄúThis is so weird. I don‚Äôt even passionately hate this song, I just feel like it‚Äôs objectively terrible. And that‚Äôs coming from someone who never thinks objectively about music.‚Äù Raykel says ‚ÄúIt's horrible when artists try to make sex PG. Just no, now we got soccer moms singing out loud asking if we can blow their whistles.‚Äù /u/NapsAndNetflix keeps the controversy going ‚Äúking of blowjob insinuations‚Äù /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus drags him ‚ÄúThis song is gross. I don‚Äôt wanna hear about Flo Rida‚Äôs dick ever. Even worse is that he decided to not only make a song about getting head, but do it in a really cutesy way. Like it‚Äôs the most immature ‚Äútee hee he‚Äôs talking about his penis‚Äù song ever. I don‚Äôt even remember anything else from the song. Usually with Flo Rida music you remember the hook and that‚Äôs it, and I wish this was the exception because it‚Äôs still catchy, and the moment I start subconciously singing about Flo Rida‚Äôs blowjob is the moment where my soul dies. Please never sing your own hook again Flo Rida, and never EVER make another song about getting your dick sucked.‚Äù

Average Score: 3.779 Controversy score: 2.367 My Score: 1. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uTUP4ET2IE0) Highest Scores: (10x2): NapsAndNetflix, mustangs16 (9x2): DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, Jopalopa.

This song is incredibly B O R I N G. This song plays at my job so I hear it on a daily basis and I still hate it. /u/mustangs16 raves ‚ÄúThis being r/popheads means this song won't get the score it deserves since it's country but it's legitimately one of my favorite songs EVER.‚Äù why. /u/throwaway963963963 makes me laugh so hard ‚ÄúInspirational, but like, only enough to make me try and remember to drink more water.‚Äù Honestly, truly. ‚ÄúThis is a really fun feel-good song. Yes, it's got a great country sound and a seriously catchy hook, but what makes it really stand out is the fact that it delivers its "follow your dreams" message in maybe the best way possible, telling it through the singer's own story and encouraging the listener to apply it to their own. Ingenious.‚Äù ‚Äì /u/Jopalopa.

This song is hilarious, but in a bad way, but also in a good way.

It is SATAN IN THE FORM OF MAYONNAISE.‚Äù /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus makes an interesting comparison ‚ÄúThe country equivalent of Dance (A$$). It‚Äôs too funny and ridiculous for me to call it bad.

This song is not as bad as Drive by.

Not only does this have a great sound, Pat Monahan's sad-sack persona is somehow charming instead of annoying here, and the absurdity of the lyrics actually make for a really good comedy song.‚Äù ‚ÄúThis is the song equivalent of a too-long Adam Sandler movie. Uck. ‚Äú - /u/joshually  /u/jonnl2806 gets dark ‚ÄúI wish he actually died, that way this song wouldn‚Äôt exist.‚Äù /u/ThereIsNotSantaClaus hits it right on the mark ‚ÄúA slightly less horrible song than Drive By but every bit as white.‚Äù

Pitbull isn't a great rapper, he doesn't know shit about Men in Black, the sample seems wedged in without thought, the weird dubstep breakdown is awful and entirely pointless...

I love this song so much, I don‚Äôt even care that it‚Äôs a Chris Brown song.  /u/benster160 says: ‚ÄúWhen that ‚ÄúUUUUUUUPPPP‚Äù bit hits I get the urge to fly through the roof.‚Äù ‚Äúkay I went back to this song not remembering much about it and, uh, this is a massive fucking tune‚Äù - /u/camerinian I agree. /u/joshually says ‚ÄúHe is such a poor man's Usher.‚Äù I agree. /u/TeamAwesome4 makes me laugh ‚ÄúFewer people believe Chris Brown love songs than college students believe in the Tooth Fairy.‚Äù /u/MrSwearword drags him: ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt worry.

I actually really like this song, chorus that only names American cities notwithstanding, Pitbull actually sounds grateful for everything. ‚Äúeverything that has Chris Brown is a 1. I‚Äôm not putting the 0 because a) it has Pitbull and I want to do the nasty with him and b) I‚Äôm saving the 0 for another song. ‚Äú -/u/BlasiFeelsSwift. What. /u/chubs4life drags this song to hell: : ‚ÄúWth was French poodle thinking? Let me get a hot artist that is loved "internationally" oh I know! Chris Brown! Shame on you. Bad dog.‚Äù /u/Therokinrolla defends Pitbull: ‚Äúeveryone here hates Pitbull but he ain't that bad, yo‚Äù agreed. /u/Jopalopa makes a good point: ‚ÄúY'know, there's a place in pop music for stupidity, provided you have the talent and charisma to get away with it. Pitbull and Chris Brown do not. End of story.‚Äù

I‚Äôm not really a fan of this song, but that‚Äôs mainly because I hear it on a regular basis, and I still don‚Äôt like it that much. /u/ImADudeDuh raves: ‚ÄúOh shit, a country song getting an 11? I'll still defend this song forever. This is like the perfect "driving down a long road and just remembering stuff that happened in your life while smiling" song. My only hope is that this gets in the top 50‚Äù lol. ‚ÄúEric Church writes songs about my life - but seriously, as a big Bruce stan this is a really great song and I appreciate it.‚Äù - /u/greenging /u/LandonKidatrea says ‚ÄúI appreciate the song's sentiment more than I like the actual song‚Äù /u/NapsAndNertflix lays down the law ‚ÄúI gave Shake It Off my 11, and The One That Got Away (Acoustic) my 11 in that ranking. Shake It Off didn't work out too well, and I know Katy won't fair well either. So let‚Äôs stick with the trend and throw it to an amazing song that will get out too early. The references to Springsteen songs are perfect, and the Eric Church can do no wrong in my eyes so this rightfully gets my 11 and a pre-emptive fuck you to those who gave this below a 6‚Äù

I don‚Äôt remember this song at all, really. But I know that this is one of the more tolerable country songs.  /u/Jopalopa says: ‚ÄúEh, I think I have a soft spot for this. Yes, it's cheesy Southern pandering, but at the very least Little Big Town sound like they're having fun, which is more than I can say for most of these country songs.‚Äù /u/whatsapilot doesn‚Äôt like it at all saying: ‚Äúugh these are the same people that made Girl Crush, no wonder it sucks so much‚Äù ‚ÄúThis rate has showed me that maybe country isn‚Äôt all that bad.
