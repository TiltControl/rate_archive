MrSwearword: So "Birthday Cake" and "Want U Back" made it to today. How long until they get chopped? "Starships" and "Domino" can die too, but I'm not expecting to see those two until early Day 3 to early Day 4.

Jopalopa: I'm here for this.

Honestly, I think Day 2 will be much more interesting and entertaining than Day 1. Day 1, most of the rankings were fairly predictable, and there were only four songs I really thought should have been higher. For Day 2... besides drama, I really have no idea what to expect. So this'll be fun!

Nerdy_boy_chris: #75. Justin Bieber -	Boyfriend 

Average Score: 4.536 Controversy score: 2.686 My score: 7. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jUOdO5dqPeU) Highest scores: (10.8x1): KobeOrNotKobe (10x1): calltehshots (9x2): NapsAndNetflix, DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy.

I actually like this song a fair amount, it’s not my favorite Bieber song, but it’s a bop nonetheless. /u/leafsnash61 calls it a “Bad Bieber song, OK Justin Timberlake song” /u/KobeOrNotKobe loves it saying “Justin’s whispering rap is dope. Also eatin fondue is underrated” “Good thing pre-2015 Bieber is over.” - /u/whatsapilot. /u/NapsAndNetflix is relatable “Chilling by the fire while we eating fondue I C O N I C” honestly, truly. /u/mustangs16 has the best comment tbh: “I always get this song confused with the BTR song of the same name which is the better of the two honestly”

Nerdy_boy_chris: #74. Maroon 5 - One More Night 

Average Score: 4.547 Controversy score: 2.394 My score 6. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGBhQbmPwH8) Highest scores: (10x1): OberionSynth (9x2): seferre2, omgcow. Lowest scores: (1x7): LandonKidatrea, Pyrozooka0, PandoraKris, jonnl2806, TeamAwesome4, lowercase_thoughts, camerinian (0.8x1): Reifiui (0.5x1): Dr_Brewer (0.3x1):joshually (0.1x1): whatsapilot. 

I like this song a fair bit too. This was actually one of my favorite songs ever at one point, but I ruined it for myself. /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus seems to be a bit conflicted “I don’t hate this song actually. It has a nice beat and I don’t hate the hook. Adam Levine is still annoying on it though so I don’t like it either.” “when that reggae guitar started playing my ass was shook” - /u/OberionSynth. /u/whatsapilot goes in “Some songs suck for being boring, some for being annoying. This one, however, nails both categories. I have an irrational hatred towards this song. This is the worst Maroon 5 single to date. This is Max Martin at his worst. How the fuck did this top the charts for NINE FUCKING WEEKS? Ever since this shit became a hit I started getting bored and annoyed every time a new song of theirs begins to climb the charts again.”

This song is kinda pleasant, but it’s also boring as fuck. /u/ImADudeDuh goes in again “You can only make 1 inoffensive ukulele love song before it gets repetitive. So generic and inoffensive, Rachel Platten can cover this in her next album” /u/BearlyEvenAPun makes a good point “Pretty bland, but even plain crackers can be a good snack from time to time” /u/throwaway963963963 makes me wonder if they’re ok “I was prepared to hate this song but oh my god it’s so pretty and heart-wrenching I could cry. Also I’m so alone. Also wtf’s a mraz “ “Every time I hear this song I think of Christina... I probably gave this song a higher score than it deserves.” /u/LandonKidatrea.

This song is a bop, no questions. I don’t care that Chris Brown is on this track tbh, it’s still fire. I feel bad for laughing at /u/mother_rucker “This song is supposed to be sexy and everything, but after listening to this my chubby ass started craving actual cake and I had to go to the grocery store and buy a cupcake.” “everytime i see/eat/hear “cake”, i spontaneously chant ‘CAKECAKECAKECAKECAKECAKECAKEOOOHBABYILIKEIT, ITSSOEXCITING, DONTTRYTOHIDEIT, IMMAMAKEYOUMYBITCH!’” - /u/JobieKong. /u/Raykel says “I personally prefer Birthday by Selena Gomez.” /u/marcryan calls it a “Lyrical Masterpiece.” I know you’re being sarcastic, but it is tbh. /u/BearlyEvenAPun says “Rihanna is the saving grace on this song and even she wasn't that good here” /u/omgcow is relatable tbh “Obvious disclaimer about Chris Brown being an awful person aside, this song is an amazing hoe anthem and I don’t care what anybody else says. I can’t listen to this without dancing like a goddamn thot”

This song is one of the best ballads I’ve ever heard, and I’m so glad I discovered it while doing this rate. /u/ImADudeDuh says “The 14 year old me would fucking J A M to this song” /u/joshually calls it “A lackluster song for art students to pretend to love.” /u/hello mocha says it’s “One of the better country songs in this list.” Even though it’s not country. “it gets unecessarily sad for a cheesy pop song and i'm grateful for it” /u/Therokinrolla. /u/OberionSynth drags king Gavin saying “gavin degraw look like the kid who's mom homeschooled him and now he wears a fedora.”

Nerdy_boy_chris: #70.	2 Chainz ft. Drake - No Lie

I like this song than I feel like I should, I think it’s more because of Drake than 2 Chainz himself tbh. /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah raves saying “’I AM SMOKING ON THAT GAS, LIFE SHOULD BE ON CINEMAX, MOVIE, BOUGHT MY BOO BIGGER TITS AND A BIGGER ASS’ I C O N I C.” /u/throwaway963963963 brings some shade “2 Chainz needs better lyrics and Drake needs VapoRub for his blocked nose.” “Reminds me of the local rappers I have here, which is pretty shit. But on the brightside, it seems like my local rappers can actually make it one day. Lol.” - /u/Raykel. /u/Jopalopa is amazed “Y'know, in retrospect it's kind of amazing this happened. For one, 2 Chainz is bragging about killing people on a top 40 hit! And he sounds legitimately badass, which is not something many rappers can say anymore. And while Drake's verse is weaker than either of 2 Chainz's, he also drops one of the catchiest hooks anywhere on the list. Awesome song.”

I actually love this song a lot, like a whole lot. /u/skiddos calls it “top 5 Bieber tbh” “Fist me Justin” /u/benster160 …alright. /u/camerinian says “This is how you actually do dubstep production right (well as right as dubstep can be)” /u/PandoraKris says “The first ever Bieber song that I shamelessly like. It's still one of his best to this date.” /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus isn’t a fan, it seems saying” “This song bored me so much. Everything about it felt so safe and forgettable, from Bieber’s vocals to the kind of dubstep very 2012 beat to Big Sean’s verse that I don’t remember a single line of. Probably the most forgettable song on this list so far. At least Boyfriend had an interesting beat.” /u/JoeThaMo gives a stern warning “Stay away from Bae Sean, Bieb!”

Nerdy_boy_chris: #67.	 Havana Brown ft. Pitbull - We Run the Night 

Average score: 5.093 Controversy score: 2.446 My score: 6. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8piAL5rD6wI) Highest scores: (11x1): TeamAwesome4 (10x2): benster160, Kaphox (9x5): PuggleMaster, Illuminastrid, DrunkHurricane, skiddos, hellomochi. Lowest scores: (1.5x1): ImADudeDuh (1x6): PM-ME-YOUR-KITTENS, JoshuaReddit, KobeOrNotKobe, TheAfricAsian, chubs4life, MrSwearword (0.5x1): mindnoises. 

This song is very 2012. And that drop is painful. /u/BlasiFeelsSwift scares me yet again “Pitbull is in it and I have a really weird crush on him. @pitbull sit on my face daddy please” /u/Awhile2 says “This song would’ve got a 7 had it not been for the unforgivably out of place ‘run em like run em run em woop’” /u/TeamAwesom4 raves “I love this song. Genuinely, without any reservations, and with all my heart” “Never heard of this song before, never heard of Havana, wish I never heard of Pitbull.” - /u/Raykel. /u/camerinian makes the only comment that makes fun of this line “There’s my score. Now fuck you, pay me”

Nerdy_boy_chris: #66. Trey Songz - Heart Attack 

Average score:  5.122 Controversy score: 2.033 My score: 7. [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AByfaYcOm4A) Highest scores: (10x2): Kaphox, skiddos (8.5x1): throwaway963963963 (8x2): omgcow, MrSwearword. Lowest scores: (1.5x2): JoshuaReddit, SKyBlade79 (1x4): PM-ME-YOUR-KITTENS, Dr_Brewer, Jopalopa, daybeyhavior. 

I’ve been a Trey Songz fan for a while, and this is pretty good. Even if it’s not on the same level as “Say Ahh” or ‘Invented Sex”. /u/ImADudeDuh says “It sounds like a rejected Jason Derulo song + Usher vocals”  /u/Jopalopa isn’t a fan “Honestly, the lyrics to this are fine, and if it weren't for that chorus, it would just be another forgettable R&B song. But that hook - if it can even be called a hook - sounds abysmal. Like, what the fuck is Trey Songz even doing with his voice? He legitimately sounds like he's in pain, and maybe that's the point but it's not fun to listen to.” /u/throwaway963963963 gives an excellent review “Excellent beat and nice vocal runs. Develops quite interestingly, as he maintains a low energy while the music changes around him.”

I actually love this song, I adore the way this song sounds and his voice. /u/Jopalopa wonders “It sucks that Phillip Phillips isn't bigger. I mean, I understand why - he's been outshone by Ed Sheeran, who plays in a similar vein and really is better - but it still sucks, because this is a sweet song. It's not a masterpiece, but it's heartfelt enough that it clicks, and it's definitely in the upper percentile of singles from American Idol alumni.” /u/greenging calls this song “Mom's Mumford & Sons”  “This is the only song in the entire rate that I'm giving a 5 because it's so amazingly middle-of-the-road.” - /u/ExtraEater. /u/Altonid

Nerdy_boy_chris: #64. The Lumineers - Ho Hey

Average score: 5.235 Controversy score: 2.955 My score: 7. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9wHd31Ddwr0) Highest scores: (10x8): TheAfricAsian, ImADudeDuh, KobeOrNotKobe, jonnl2806, DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, BearlyEvenAPun, pastaandpizza,PM-ME-YOUR-KITTENS (9x2): mother_rucker, mustangs16. Lowest scores: (1x7): FuckUpSomeCommasYeah, letsallpoo, MrSwearword, Awhile2, joshually, benster160, dirdbub(0.9x1): wildcosmias (0.5x1): Therokinrolla (0x3): omgcow, noideawhatever, Death_Soup. 

I like this song a fair bit, even though it does get repetitive after a while. /u/omgcow says “I fucking hate this song, I hate the chanting in the background, I hate the vocals, I hate it all” Conversely /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy says “Every time this songs comes on, the song always makes me feel warm no matter what mood I am in” /u/joshually has a question “Was there this weird like 1800s type music revival in 2012 or something? Not into it.”/u/letsallpoo and /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah both reference [Parks & Rec](https://youtu.be/0ONY-RzqB7E?t=22s) “’I once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song. I had to throw away my whole computer... just to be safe."’- Aziz Ansari as Tom Haverford”

Nerdy_boy_chris: #63. Gym Class Heroes ft. Neon Hitch - Ass Back Home

Average score: 5.236 Controversy score: 2.302 My score: 11. [Listen here.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9KHk9d2pQFU) Highest scores: (11x1): Nerdy_boy_chris. (10x1):PM-ME-YOUR-KITTENS (9x2): yatcho, Pyrozooka0. Lowest scores: (2x9): noideawhatever, throwaway963963963, JoshuaReddit, camerinian, ExtraEater, BlasiFeelsSwift, Dr_Brewer, mac_dooney, greenging. (1x2): PuggleMaster, Mudkip1. 

I love this song so much, my absolute favorite song of 2012 and top 5 of the 2010s. And it’s all cause of that amazing chorus. /u/Awhile2 says “Neon Hitch deserved a lot more mainstream success after this js” /u/ThereIsNoSantaClaus says “This reminds me of a blander, slightly better or worse version of Twenty One Pilots.” How dare you. /u/Jopalopa makes a good point “Travie McCoy sucks, and the Gym Class Heroes suck. This comes across as a relatively forgettable song with a strong chorus that salvages it, but I really feel it could've been great if it were Neon Hitch's song instead. (Of course, it wouldn't have been a hit then, but hey, it's the thought that counts.)”  “Severely underrated.” - /u/PandoraKris.

Nerdy_boy_chris: #62. T-Pain ft. Lily Allen & Wiz Khalifa - 5 O'Clock 

Average score: 5.248 Controversy score: 2.299 My score: 7.

I like the feel and tone of this song more than the actual song. It’s very soothing and calm. /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy says “From Wikipedia: "It peaked at number ten on the Billboard Hot 100, becoming [Lily] Allen's first and only top ten single in the United States." As a Lily Allen fan, this fact made me cry.” /u/camerinian is sad “This wasn’t one of his better songs, but God do I miss T-Pain :’(“  /u/Jopalopa gives an eloquent review ‘Now here's an odd little piece of pop-culture ephemera, which might not be good but is certainly interesting. I think the Lily Allen sample is the best part, if only because she actually sounds like she gives a shit. T-Pain's verses aren't bad, but eventually he starts to sound rambly, and Wiz's verse is pointless. And the subject matter... eh? I appreciate its goal of subverting the club hit, but it could've been done a fair better.” “T-Pain knows how to sample a song. It reminded me he made Auto-Tune his shit.” - /u/MrSwearword

I really like this song. It’s not as good as Ass Back Home, but it’s still pretty good. /u/FuckUpSomeCommasYeah calls it the “opposite of Ass Back Home, hook sucks, Travie McCoy's verses are ok” /u/whatsapilot drags it saying “ ’Good music can be so hard to find’ well this is a terrible place to start, and so is pretty much any single Adam Levine has been in during the past few years.” “Fuck Travie McCoy. Fuck “Yeah, yeah, that’s right”. Fuck the “Haha” after every one of his awful puns. Fuck his inability to move past a single metaphor, instead making it sound more and more dumb the ‘deeper’ he goes. Fuck his stupid little insincere faux-inspirational spoken-word bridges. Fuck the fact that the US ditched him after 2012 but I distinctly remember having to suffer through his fucking solo career for another 3 years as he pumped out more mediocre shite. Fuck this absolute hack.” - /u/camerinian.

 I adore this song so much. It’s bitchy in all the right ways. /u/BlasiFeelsSwift says “I WAS ROOTING FOR YOU, WE WERE ALL ROOTING FOR YOU. HOW DARE YOU? LEARN SOMETHING FROM THIS. I was rooting for you all X-Factor and then you go and release this shit? What the fuck?“  /u/KobeOrNotKobe says “i like this, it's petty” /u/Jopalopa gives another review “Look, I can appreciate this song's ambitions. It reminds me a lot of early Kesha singles, which is never a bad thing. However, Cher Lloyd simply doesn't have a strong enough voice to pull this off, and she really does come across as out of her depth. Still, a valiant effort.” “This song has some of the worst lyrics I’ve ever heard. I don’t give a fuck if it’s catchy. "UGH!!!!" indeed. Really a shame. This song could have easily been a 10.” -/u/whatsapilot. /u/calltehshots calls it “This is garbage but the garbage that I love”

This song is iconic.

Yeah it helped make YOLO a thing but it’s still a dope track. Wayne’s verse isn’t great but has some great quotables.” “bass made my asshole shiver” - /u/OberionSynth. /u/ joshually is not a fan “LOL @ Drake trying to pretend he's "from the streets" or that he's "hard".

“Queen of saxophones.” - BreezySeason

Wow I’m so surprised this won. Really, I can’t express how shocked I am. (Forreal though, fantastic song and a fitting winner for such an...interesting rate. If any song has the right to claim the title as the winner of r/popheads’ first rate, it’s this.)

mother_rucker gives it their 11, saying it’s “the obvious choice but the only real choice.” KometBlu says, “That sax line works amazing as an intro to the album. They really fucked up by not making this the first single, a Till The World Ends tea.” At least that went top 10 hihi. breadvelvet has a confession to make: “the blaring saxophone actually turned me off the first time I heard it (something about the timbre feels off and a bit unnatural), but I grew to love it somehow. I think it’s definitely a ballsy intro track to the album and rousing, though I do wish the chorus melody moved around a bit more.”

elxtreme just says “YES” and slaps down another 11. MrSwearword, on the other side of things, is shaking and crying once more: “THE MEMES IT CAUSED…THE MEMES…” angusaditus says he “loves it, but not that much,” and kickit gives y’all a lecture: “I don't see this song as the standout track /r/popheads wants it to be. I think anyone who wants to compare this to Teenage Dream or Blank Space or whatever is delusional and trying to pull an immaculate song off this great pop album and focusing on the wrong song anyway. I like this song, but I think it's sorely overrated.”

Regardless, TheAllRightGatsby calls it “the bop of a generation,” and jimmy345960 calls it “bae.” (???) Altiondsols throws a bit of shade, saying it’s “the only powerful opening track on any of these three albums.” Leave Moonlight out of this! JoeThaMo says, “Almost got my 11 but, just like with Bad Blood, it's gonna get enough attention from popheads even without my vote.” Well, you could say that again.
