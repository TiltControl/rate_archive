**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 7.5 // Eli: 9**

Wailord: Hm. The Bjork delusion jumped out the fact that the worst song in the rate is still above an 8.0. Already we get out the most controversial, and the song with the overall worst scores. Now, look at the amount of 0s and the bad scores it got and compare it to the average. Y’all go ahead and take a guess at how high the top 5 will be.

--- 

**awryj** (10): you: i listen to camila caballo~ me, an intellectual:

**enecks** (10): This song's faults are like Pluto - they don't exist and rumours of it are just propaganda to encourage heterosexuality

**Leixander** (10): this song gave birth to arca

**MrSwearword** (10): YAAAAAS this is that weird NES/video game sounding shit I live for.

**technoprayers** (10): - sis really turned a mental breakdown into a whole bop

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): [GAY SCREAMING]

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): SOPHIE was inspired

**AbnormalPopPunk** (9): ah yes, my only non-10 from homogenic. it does hurt to do this, but "pluto" to me is just... not listenable. i do give it an 9 because i do try to rate objectively. the production is very well done, the lyrics are dope, and it wasn't like anything else of it's time. despite being my personal least favorite, pluto may be the pinnacle of the boundary-pushing sound that weaves its way throughout the 10 songs on the record.

**huntyphobic** (9): this song makes me feel like this gif https://i.imgur.com/rhPWtm6.gif

**ryanyu10** (8.8): Really good production, but compared to other songs in this rate, the relative lack of substance in the lyrics draws this down a bit.

**stansymash** (8.8): glitchy grooves and sleek sleek moves

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): queen of chiptune

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Like a Voltorb in the tall grass, Björk asks us if we wouldn't mind giving her a moment to herself, because she's about to EXPLOOODDEEE. Unlike a Voltorb in the tall grass, I, for one, welcome this concept. Pluto is definitely one of the messiest and most polarising songs on Homogenic, at least for casual Björk fans; the title might be subject to several controversies in itself, courtesy of our dear old friend NASA, but its musical namesake is almost as wild and chaotic as modern day PC Music, living up to the metaphor Björk opens with superbly. It's a little shocking to hear this after something as bold and hopeful as Alarm Call; if you're familiar with Pluto, the narrative themes on both songs do seam surprisingly well with each other, but if this is your first or second time listening to Homogenic, transitioning from something as poppy as Alarm Call to Pluto of all songs can be a bit hard on your ears. Even if Pluto is a wild ride, there are a few things that it lacks; try as I might, the song isn't memorable enough for me past the qualities I mentioned to rise from being the bottom of the barrel when it comes to my personal opinion of Homogenic. But the barrel I'm talking about its a pretty shallow one, and as exhausting as Pluto is, it's also quite the event.

**Hi, This has the most negative comments on a song in the entire rate.**
---

**stardustanddinos** (6.5): This was way too loud and jarring for my tastes. Not a bad track, but the worst on this album surely.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (5): Too much screaming! At least the techno beats have a groove to them

**perfumevee** (4): I really couldn't get into this one.

**kanyewestrep3** (0): this song will never not sound like a dumpster fire

**notdallin** (0): Did y’all hear Pluto? That’s messed up

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 8 // Eli: 10**


Wailord: This kinda sounds like it could be a Lorde song. Lorde would cover this and OWN it. 

There is a strange atmosphere created by this track, and I really vibe with it, but I don’t really adore the vocals here, they are unrestrained for a reason, but they aren’t very audibly pleasing? 

--- 

**enecks** (8): HMMHMHMH

---

**We Stan Immaturity**

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): when i first was starting to become a bjork fan (about three years ago), this was my favorite bjork song. i'm not sure why, something about it is just so.... magnetic and dreamy.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I like the groove on this one. The jangly synths are a nice touch.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): the production for this track is INSANE

**ryanyu10** (9.8): Similar ethereal quality to Hunter, except calmer. It’s the shortest track on the album, and you feel it – it seems almost too short when it’s done. The growl she uses in the middle is really cool.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): so simple lyrically but still so captivating

**nooodisaster** (9.2): I will FOREVER laugh at how some artists spend their entire careers blaming exes, and Bjork literally has ONE song about that, then immediately follows that with 'well, it's immature to expect love from others when you can't give it to yourself.' This song read me for fucking filth when I first heard it. Now I love myself and jam to the production lol. The amount of self -reflection boarding on self-hatred along with THOSE vocals leaves me breathless still.

**tapdancingpig** (9): I appreciate the blend of organic sounds and electronic music a lot more than I probably should.

**technoprayers** (9): - everyone pays this serve dust but it slaps

**stansymash** (8.5): i think this song was written in the year 201238

**enecks** (8): HMMHMHMH

**MrSwearword** (8): great vocals but the previous track snatched it better

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): First time listeners of Homogenic may have been weirded out for the last two songs, so they'll be relieved to know we go back a little to pop here. Immature is a fairly brief song that's actually only made out of eleven lines and three stanzas (perhaps Björk is inventing a new form of poetry over here) the the last one in particular is just her yelling 'How could I be so immature?!', which is an intensely relatable mood. The song's a little too short to go into detail about why a woman in her late 20s feels like she's relapsed into embarrassing high school days, with only a precious few lines hinting what's going on (spoiler alert: it's a guy's fault) but Immature still ends up making an impact, probably because it's a short little outburst of emotions after two intense tracks. Just keep on letting your voice shine through, Björk. Just keep on doing that.

**Synonymous with Quality?**

**huntyphobic** (6.5): juvenility queen

**notdallin** (3.5): I guess lazy is one excuse for it?

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 8 // Eli: 10**


**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Well, here's the barricade of weird-ass lyrics we've come to expect every time we listen to Björk. What is she even singing about here? Maybe the cocoon metaphor is a reference to Björk helping her lover grow and mature by emerging out of their shell. Maybe it's just about sex. Who the hell knows? The repeating synth that perhaps represents slow progress being made in this ambiguous situation is the easiest thing to remember about All Neon Like, and the song is no doubt one of the hardest tracks on Homogenic to actually get into. It's obviously a decent song, but you'd be lying if you'd deny scratching your head upon your first few listens. Despite the song failing to be more than a curious segue into the album's middle section for me, I still find things I enjoy about All Neon Like, however; Björk singing 'Feeds you, honey, heals you' is a good moment amidst all the strangeness, and so is the way she pronounces something as intriguing as the words 'luminous beam'.

--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): that bouncy beat gets me going

**awryj** (10): I will never not think turtlehead is a weirdass metaphor for a head of a penis

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This is so hypnotic and so sexual and kinda unsettling and kinda comforting. Truly a prequel to Vespertine.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): this is gonna get underrated because it’s slower and tucked between a career highlight and a bop

**enecks** (9): SMASH THAT MF NEON LIKE BUTTON

**survivorjdmarina** (9): the pulsing beat lowkey makes me feel some type of way

**technoprayers** (9): - I love how soft it feels and how comforting the lyrics are

**stansymash** (8.2): the production is so impeccable that even on a slightly weaker composition i'm still super compelled

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): It feels a little long towards the end but it’s very ethereal and relaxing...

**MrSwearword** (8): so close to being a great track but felt like a chore trying to get my life to it

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Well, here's the barricade of weird-ass lyrics we've come to expect every time we listen to Björk. What is she even singing about here? Maybe the cocoon metaphor is a reference to Björk helping her lover grow and mature by emerging out of their shell. Maybe it's just about sex. Who the hell knows?

**ryanyu10** (8): Considerable drop in quality from the past four tracks but still fairly solid. Production is fitting but, in my opinion, kind of questionable in some places (but also very interesting in others).

**notdallin** (7.9): those icy mirrored synth arpeggios really paint a world for Bjork’s cries.

**Honestly, did he lie?**
---

**nooodisaster** (5): The ugly pimple in the flawless face of Homogenic, literally this song is the ONLY bad song and it's sooo long boring and pointless. Six minutes of the same uninspired beat, no chorus, and like... nonsensical lyrics? Maybe this is like the palette cleanser between each half to make sure we don't forget the level Bjork is playing at on this record?

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 10 // Eli: 9**

Wailord: A beautiful piano based track, probably the closest call back to the sound of Tidal, a largely piano based album. Like some of you all brought up, this is essentially pure poetry that someone decided to put to music. It isn’t simple lyrics, it is something a step higher, without sounding conceited.

**nooodisaster** (9.5): "No, not 'baby' anymore/If I need you, I'll just use your simple name." Wow okay, I'm just gonna go cry forever now, thanks.

**llieno94** (9): this is pure poetry. Comparing birthday candle flames to blue eyes you make wishes on??? I mean come on

**notdallin** (8.6): I love Fiona’s vocals in this song. It’s not very often that I appreciate her husky contralto, but it just hits the spot in this song. It doesn’t hurt that the piano and the violins somersault around her in such a complementary way.

**awryj** (8.5): A simple enough song, but the emotion makes it stand out

**minibjork** (8.5): fiona apple was in her early 20s when she wrote this song ugh literary genius

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): While previously, Fiona's melodies and lyrics have blended perfectly together to create a double tsunami, Love Ridden is the first track on When The Pawn... where her poetry takes the forefront of the song's impact on its listeners. Relationships that cause agony in their slow deterioration have inspired many a good work before, and Fiona carries on the tradition by producing an immediately damning lyric that goes 'Only kisses on the cheek from now on...'. While her voice here is compelling, and the song is overall a stellar ballad, Love Ridden just wouldn't be the same with the kind of songwriting Fiona is capable of.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Pretty heart-wrenching stuff. Love the strings

**stansymash** (8): pretty songs for pretty people like me!

**It’s not BAD, but is it worth it?**
---

**ryanyu10** (7.5): Certainly very solid, but if there’s anything that would classify as “filler” on this album, it would be this track.

**survivorjdmarina** (7): don't really have anything to say tbh

**Wailord: 10 // Eli: 8.5**

Wailord: This is so pretty, and such a somber ending. The lyricism and pacing of the song is what really makes it as great as it is. 

--- 

**minibjork** (7.7): the implied "i know" at the end makes my heart sink

---

**llieno94** (11): by far her best song... its so incredibly unique but classic sounding at the same time. Her vocal subtleties and phrasing are incredible, the extended metaphors throughout the lyrics are incredible, the orchestra is incredible.

**kanyewestrep3** (10): one of the best album closers of all time

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): good closer

**nooodisaster** (9): wwaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH

**survivorjdmarina** (9): fiona's vocals here are stunning

**awryj** (8.8): Fiona's rhyme game is fucking heavenly.

**stansymash** (8.7): i love the bit at the end where she says "you don't have to say it", and then the listener fills in the blank as "i know" cause its the song title, but then she actually doesn't say it. and then you're like "nice"

**ryanyu10** (8.2): Quite a decent album ender, but doesn’t really stand out in the face of the other songs in this rate.

**MrSwearword** (8): makes sense as a closer

**minibjork** (7.7): the implied "i know" at the end makes my heart sink

**technoprayers** (7): - a cute closer

**Poor Takes!**
---

**blackvelvet** (6): Honestly after listening to Kate Bush and Bjork albums this one sounds so bland and boring in comparison, at one point I zoomed out and realized I was halfway through it.

**notdallin** (6): it’s fine, it’s kind of a nothing song unless you pay attention to the lyrics. Which the very VERY slow waltz production does not entice me to want to do

**patronsaintofaspies** (5): Unfortunately, on an album I find otherwise fantastic, I Know closes When The Pawn... in a rather medicore fashion. I'm sure that a few Fiona fans treasure it as a dear favourite, but for a person like me, who's just been introduced to her music, I Know's running time isn't very justified. While Fiona remains as lyrically as sharp on the song as ever, the music itself fails to be compelling as the rest of the record, and Fiona's voice doesn't do anything I find interesting throughout the entire track. I was expecting some sort of heartbreaking ballad to follow up on the startling outcome of Get Gone, but all I got from I Know was disappointment.

**Wailord: 8 // Eli: 10**


Wailord: I remember getting this CD at Barnes and Noble when I was 13 and playing the CD every night before I went to bed, but purposely turning this song down to make sure my mom didn’t hear Fiona use the F word and think I’m a bad person. 

But yeah, this song isn’t the strongest on the album, and the words and melody never seemed to fit together, even if the intro is one of the best in the album. 

--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): queen of fucking up

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This song feels like a deep ocean, with subtle electronic beats buried down in those guitars and piano. It really adds a nice touch.

**Leixander** (9.5): great instrumentation and great vocals by fiona as always!

**ryanyu10** (9.3): Again, the subtle desperation that Fiona Apple displays here really elevates the track to another level. That, combined with the solid production, leaves this as quite the stunning track.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Upon first being exposed to When The Pawn..., I couldn't quite pin Fiona's personality down until I reached the trills of A Mistake. While it might not be as insightful in the same fashion as songs like Paper Bag, A Mistake perfectly captures everything people like about Fiona Apple, from her wit, to her lyricism, to that perfect little way she vocally delivers tracks tinged with a bit of sass and sarcasm. The musical qualities of the song are also certainly commendable. Though an electric guitar may play in the background, there's no ignoring how delightfully jazzy A Mistake is, nor how well its influences blend with Fiona's sharp tongue. All things considered, this is a favourite of mine on When The Pawn....

**stansymash** (9): if i didnt like this album this song title would be used for an epic diss! except this album is stellar so i guess i'm keeping that diss in the vault for another time

**awryj** (8.5): inb4 someone gives this song their 0 and their comment is "you were right, fiona"

**llieno94** (8.5): love the flow of this song

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): aaaaaAAAAAOHohOHohOHohOH

**plastichaxan** (8): Not too strong at the beginning but as it goes it's incredible.

**technoprayers** (8): - she’s a really cute girl but cute next to gorgeous….

**MrSwearword** (6): psychedelic vibes are fine, but Fiona is kinda out of her depth here

**I’M NO GOOD AT MATH**
---

**nooodisaster** (6): The beat is funky-licious, but I guess I'm just not feeling the lyrics or melodic structure. Also the "I'm no good at math" line is suuuper cringy, I don't care if it's on purpose or not.

**notdallin** (4.1): when I can tell as a listener that the lyrics were written first and then shoehorned into a melody after the fact…that’s not great Fiona!

**Wailord: 6.5 // Eli: 7**

Wailord: Hm. I didn’t really *get* this one, and really threw off the pace of this album for me especially with where it was placed, and split the album into halves, with the first half really blowing me away.

---

**MILF Stands for Comfort**

**awryj** (10): Incredibly creepy. Makes me think of Psycho, except if the mother was alive. Well, she was alive, if you think about it. Kind of.

**huntyphobic** (10): I’m fully expecting this sub to do this song so dirty but Mother Stands For Comfort is literally a Psycho-esque horror movie in the form of a song, ugh HER MIND

**technoprayers** (10): - I feel so comfy and happy listening to this

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): don’t sleep on this just because it’s a chill song! The lyrics are great (am I the cat that takes the bird?), and it’s an interesting to compare it to the other song about a parent that follows it on the album.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): This sounds really creepy...but it’s just like the album description said, artsy synthpop. Can’t argue with that.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): this sounds like… alien music

**ryanyu10** (8.6): It’s alright… production and lyrics save the song.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The slight black sheep of side A, as evident that literally every other song on it was singled but this. This is really dark and interesting lyrically, but I suppose by its nature the emotion is suuuper muted and the production plodding, which makes it just slightly less than a masterpiece for me.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): An break song about motherly love on an acclaimed art pop album might make you think of Golden Hour, but it sounds like Kate's describing a maternal relationships a little more complex than Kacey's; the lyrics are vague and enticing, making you wonder about the title. The smooth, tender melody of Mother Stands For Comfort might make you think that the meaning is just what's intended, but soon you start to pick up on the sounds of breaking glass and the ambiguity of Kate's tone, and the whistling starts to get a little more unnerving than comforting, turning this song into an absolute enigma. Paying close attention to the lyrics finally reveals that Kate's not sharing something from her personal life - in reality, the song is written from the perspective of a murderer with mommy issues. Though ultimately not as loved as the rest of Hounds of Love's first side, Mother Stands For Comfort provides tantalizing insight into Kate's life, and first-time listeners will soon start to appreciate the familial connection; Kate's own blood is appearing on the record soon enough, as we'll see on its second half.

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): wa wa wa wa

**stansymash** (8.1): kate bush must have one spooky mother to create this song!

**Banananaise** (8): what a title

**blackvelvet** (8): Is this is what you hear when you're being abducted by aliens?

**llieno94** (8): I can imagine people being really weirded out when they first heard this song back in the 80’s

**notdallin** (8): it’s like kate bush freestyling over some chrono trigger video game music! You all know the one right because I am too lazy to find it from my surface-level yotub searches

**minibjork** (7.5): background ah-oohs make this song

**Mother Stands for Mediocre, Outstandingly Trite, Hardly Earnest Record**

**enecks** (7): UGH she did that. This is a lesser track but still tho.

**MrSwearword** (7): middling but not terrible

**smartspice** (4): By far the weakest on the album

Wailord: This is probably the most forgettable song in this album. I seriously can’t really remember anything from it, other than the fact I got Grimes vibes when I first heard it, and don’t really like Grimes to begin with. 

---

**MrSwearword** (4): what a fucking letdown

--- 

**awryj** (10): Kate Bush invented Grimes' vocals here... Except you couldn't hear what she was singing on purpose

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): a literal out of body experience

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Feels like it’s floating around my head as I’m listening.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): My favorite on The Ninth Wave

**notdallin** (8.7): My heart breaks more and more for the ghost in these songs with each passing track. Plus that rocking bassline really helps this song progress quickly, adding to its replay value

**survivorjdmarina** (8): the waking the witch mention was good

**tapdancingpig** (8): This song is strangely heart rending.

**technoprayers** (8): - I like it but the reverse speaking lowkey ruins it for me

**stansymash** (7.6): i'd like to give this song the coveted "oh right that song. forgot about that one" award

**nooodisaster** (7.5): I'm getting more plodding than pleading.

**minibjork** (7): mumbling never sounded so good

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): It's not a song I'd dare to skip, because I'd never want to skip anything on a narrative as strong as the Ninth Wave, but Watching You Without Me is the only song on Hounds of Love that doesn't radiate quality. The song is mostly an instrumental aside from Kate's humming, with only a few sparse verses thrown in for good measure. Its place in the Ninth Wave's plot is quite a little fishy, too; apparently this is supposed to be Kate having visions of her family and friends as she climbs out of the water, fatigued once again and on the verge of giving up, but though the trance-like atmosphere of Watching You Without Me is interesting, even Kate doesn't manage to prevent it from becoming boring. While the song even sounds a little mystical in nature at points, the song seems more like an annoyingly hypnotic loop instead of something you'd be enamoured with. It ends up being rather dull.

**Wailord: 7 // Eli: 7**

Wailord: The bridge is probably the biggest redeeming factor, and the intro, but I agree for the most part that this song is the filler in a song of stand outs. It is just *there* for the most part again.

---

**nooodisaster** (6): The most "that's a song" of this entire rate 

--- 
**minibjork** (10): i love fiona's tone and flow in the chorus.

**ryanyu10** (9.2): Was not too how on this song initially, but the climax near the end again gives this song such a unique quality. There’s almost a shift in tone from desperation to pettiness to an element of indifference at the end.

**llieno94** (9): maybe one of her most underrated songs. It has one of her most pop-melody chorus'

**survivorjdmarina** (9): production value snapped here

**technoprayers** (9): - the production on this one and how it really blends in with her voice is just what I need

**awryj** (8.8): At first I didn't like it much, but honestly, I feel like this song has some replay value

**Things are Filler**

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): 'Keep on, keep on,' sings Fiona, narrating another song that seems more like a skip across the road than a full-blown drive towards the finish line. Along with Fast As You Can, The Way Things are seems to act as the only filler on an otherwise fantastic record. This brief stretch into dazedness is perhaps the only reason why When The Pawn... is not as acclaimed as Hounds of Love or Homogenic, despite being praiseworthy in its own right. There's not much else to note about The Way Things Are, although the song is still above average output. Perhaps Fiona using the expression 'kicking the crap till it's gone' should be of note, because using 'crap' in your main hook is nowhere near as edgy now as it was in 1998.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): I mean it’s okay...it’s not bad or anything but I’m not sure I’ll remember what this sounds like when reveal time comes along

**MrSwearword** (7): the idea's there but the buildup to it is much too long for my liking

**notdallin** (6.4): “crap” is such an ugly word. Like it’s worse than “shit.” it just looks odd and inappropriate in song lyrics.

**nooodisaster** (6): The most "that's a song" of this entire rate.

**Host Scores:**
 
**Wailord: 10 // Eli: 7**
 
Wailord: While maybe a touch pitchy at some points, I think that was a completely intentional choice, similar to the vocal choices by Bjork in the later parts of her album, or even still in Fiona’s album, the choice of lyrics vs melody in A Mistake. I think it makes the albums much more genuine, even if it isn’t as sonically pleasing as it should be to some.
 
---
 
**Note, no comments had 10 scores**
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): One of the things I ended up liking the best about When The Pawn... was the jazz influence on its songs, something that I sure didn't expect from a white girl's indie art pop album, and while Fiona's dazzling vocals already graced the glory that was On the Bound, To Your Love ends up playing with the sort of rhythms such a genre is known for to the point where it ends up becoming even more striking. There are so many lyrics I can highlight from the song (as well as the entirety of When The Pawn...) but Fiona's poetic ability shines especially on the chorus. It's then her personality leaps out on you, after teasing itself during the album's opening track, On the Bound, and it's there the record goes from promising to a work that you know's going to be fantastic.
 
**nooodisaster** (9): Ugh, the first verse is so well written and wonderful. Super great, catchy chorus, and the lyrics... we relate??? The audience relates.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): the classical production on this track is greatttttt
 
**tapdancingpig** (9): You can really hear her influence on Lana’s voice on this track.
 
**ryanyu10** (8.8): Solid track, catchy and playful.
 
**stansymash** (8.7): get those spy horns right up my ass
 
**notdallin** (8): this song rocks so well. Not in like the way like ACDC or Led Zeppelin or even Tame Impala rocks, but like the way the Bee Gees or Phoenix or Amen Dunes rocks, you know the kind of music you fluidly groove to on your way home from campus, when your headphones are in and your hands are in your zipped-down hoodie pockets swaying you’re your on-beat strut. It’s like perfectly following a unique dance pattern step-by-step across miles of forest from lily pad to lily pad, oblivious to the rushing river carrying you and your dance partner away
 
**technoprayers** (8): - she’s just there, sounds good but she’s just there
 
**awryj** (7.5): yas show off your thicc vocab fiona
 
**llieno94** (7.5): probably a bottom 5 Fiona song for me, but I still love it. The way she pulls random obscure antiquated terms out of her vocabulary and puts them into music is incredible. The bridge in this song is incomprehensible without a dictionary.
 
**MrSwearword** (7): her vocals are fine and the production is cute but holy shit are her lyrics reaching for eloquence
 
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): I’m not a fan of her faster ones, and this feels just a little...rushed. I don’t know why but the pacing seems off

**Leixander** (10): THISSSSSSSS IS AN AALLLLAAAARM CALLL SO WAKE UP WAKE UP NOW
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This is such a banger and Bjork's vocal performance is IMMACULATE

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): I tried using this as my alarm once and I slept through it
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): If there was ever a competition between the most wholesome songs Björk's ever made, Alarm Call would definitely be crowned the winner in a snap. Despite being a single, the song's been a long-term fan favourite, and that's no surprise, given the fact that this is one of the catchiest tracks off Homogenic; it's far more optimistic than the rest of the record, too, shedding Björk's previous moody lyrics to tell a four minute story of courage, made whole by the repeating mantra of 'It doesn't scare me now'. Indeed, Björk's asserting 'I ain't no fucking Bhuddist/but this is enlightenment', for all its memetastic qualities, fits the song perfectly; there's no other ray of sunshine that can sparkle as brightly as Alarm Call (actually, now that I've mentioned rays, I have to say the lyrical themes here remind me a lot of Ray of Light; Sky Fits Heaven in particular could basically be called an electronic version of Alarm Call.) If you don't think this is one of Björk's best songs, I question your taste.
 
**stansymash** (9.3): this song makes me Want To Dance! but its the future or something
 
**enecks** (9): beep
 
**nooodisaster** (9): One of the things I love most about Björk is how beneath the crazy experimentation, she feels like an alien who's just so interested in experiencing all this Earth has to offer. We're all kinda just aliens plopped in here, made to figure things out as best we can. Björk always seems to keep the girlish sincerity and excitement that I think we lose far too quickly. "You can't say no to hope/You can't say no to happiness. / It doesn't scare me at all."

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): I prefer the single version to the album one, but I guess this isn’t that bad

**Host Scores:**
 
**Wailord: 10 // Eli: 10**
 
Wailord: This song is really as good as I remember. This was the first Bjork song I listened to when I found out I was going to co-host and I was shook. I think I was really thrownoff, but when I started from the beginning of the album, it felt so much more meaningful.
 
---
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): this sounds like a video game lol
 
---
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): her enunciation of the word love.. whew
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I’M SO BOOOOORED OF COOOWAAAAARDS
 
**CopyCatJ** (10): Bowie who?
 
**MrSwearword** (10): wig snatched
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Bjork saying "i dare you" in 50 different ways? Art.
 
**technoprayers** (10): - sis did that, dragged Tricky and Goldie for filth
 
**nooodisaster** (9.5): SHE SNAPPED!!!!! The gag of a rate with an entire album of Fiona Apple, and Björk has the most biting song of them all. Like I could provide examples, but it's actually THE WHOLE SONG. Her voice is sooo underrated, the gravel in this song is unreal. Naming the song after the line "Till after 5 years/(If you live that long)/You'll wake up all loveless"? W O W.
 
**stansymash** (9): god this song is so much better than i remembered. the production is amaaaaaaazing and this was 1997? who can compare
 
**survivorjdmarina** (9): this sounds like a video game lol
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): If you've ever wanted to see Björk get serious and call out somebody so badly you wonder if they're still alive, you don't need to look far; 5 Years is one of many moments on Homogenic where the woman snaps, this time specifically against somebody, and there's no declaration showing what a sorry state the person she's singing about is in than the phrase 'If you live that long...'. It's a little torturous to wonder about how rooted in reality the lyrics are, because Björk's attacks are so raw and personal they even wrap themselves around a rough, melding melody instead of being plastered onto standard song composition with a clear cut verse and chorus. It's truly astounding how cold Björk sounds like with lines such as 'I'm so bored of cowards', and by the time 5 Years is done, you feel as if a door's been shut off for good. It's one of the best album cuts off Homogenic simply for how absolutely brutal it ends up being. Can you imagine somebody you used to date writing this song for you, and hearing it for the first time? I sure feel sorry for whoever that was.
 
**ryanyu10** (8.5): Another very solid song. Interesting production again.
 
**awryj** (8.2): you cunt handoll loff
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): points for the strings
 
**5 Years off my Life Expectancy**
 
**tapdancingpig** (7.3): Ok, I like the production, but this vocal... Bjork, what are you doing?
 
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): She goes a little too wild with the vocals on this one for me but the backing beats are literally from heaven
 
**notdallin** (5.8): I mean wow, when Bjork’s vocals don’t match a song, they REALLY don’t. is it too cute to give this song a 5?
 
**Leixander** (5): one point for each year
 
**Lukas Graham Wishes**

**Host Scores:**
 
**Wailord: 8.5 // Eli: 7**
 
Wailord: The lower register and the more haunting intro was nice, but it still doesn’t hold as well as I wish it would. It is a newer and more distinct sound for Kate, and really makes it stand out.
 
---
 
**awryj** (10): IT'S MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEeeeeee
 
**blackvelvet** (10): I love it, it sounds so spooky, wish it was longer.
 
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Really scary stuff.
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): The tension building in this song is insane
 
**ryanyu10** (10): I absolutely love those strings and the layering of the voices. A haunting quality.
 
**tapdancingpig** (10): This is actually fucking terrifying. Like, I’m on the edge of my seat listening to this.
 
**technoprayers** (10): - the strings are amazing, homogenic reminds me a lot of this song
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): the prelude to Waking the Witch creates a gorgeously foreboding atmosphere full of isolation and apprehension
 
**huntyphobic** (9): although I don’t really listen to this song outside of the album, I really appreciate what it contributes to Hounds of Love. Although ‘And Dream of Sheep’ is the beginning of the ninth wave section of the album, ‘Under Ice’ really is the turning point in terms of sound and concept. I feel like everybody sleeps on this track but honestly the brooding sound of the instrumentation and vocals invoke a very isolationist and panicked feeling, which is super fun.
 
**MrSwearword** (9): nice and weird but a bit short
 
**nooodisaster** (9): I love the jaunting, dangerous strings of this track, how deep and ominous the vocals are, and the catharsis of the ending cry. Ooky-spooky spoopy song.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): It looks like Kate's sunk along with the piece of wood she's clung herself too, but, apparently, she's not dead yet. Under Ice is another show of Kate's deeper, higher-quality voice, for the song's done in an operatic style, one fitting considering the drama that unfolds a track later. It further intensifies the theatrical motifs already seen in songs such as The Big Sky, appearing very dramatically as Kate describes the harsh, cold winter ice (she's been stuck there for that long? How on Earth has she survived?) changing its landscape as an unknown enigma starts to emerge and break free out of a frozen surface. The violins kick in, and you start to get unnerved, wondering if Kate's talking about a Lovecraftian abomination, but then the reveal we've all been waiting for comes: 'It's meeeee!' she declares, as her character stirs for the first time in forever. Hauntingly chilling, and hauntingly beautiful.
 
**Banananaise** (8.5): deep Kate Bush voice + thunder sounds = DRAMA
 
**notdallin** (8.3): to slot this song right after “And Dream of Sheep” is brilliant. It’s eerie to think that the person giving up in the middle of the sea has found themselves months later on the other side of the ice,
 
**stansymash** (8.3): oh man this is tension isn't it. i feel tense
 
**llieno94** (8): This song is quintessential Art Pop. Its almost scary and unsettling to listen to, but also puts you in a trance.
 
**minibjork** (8): this shit is so cinematic. sister song to sophie's "is it cold in the water?"
 
**survivorjdmarina** (8): (dramatic violins)
 
**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): I remember being so scared by this song omg

**Host Scores:**
 
**Wailord: 7 // Eli: 10**
 
Wailord: Probably my least favorite of the three album closers in this rate. Doesn’t mean it isn’t good, but it just doesn’t seem like a great book end to the album.
 
Eli: Often regarding as one of Bjork’s best and most beautiful songs, “All is Full of Love” holds a certain intricacy in every aspect of the song that is rarely found elsewhere. Beautiful production accompanies intimate vocals and lyrics. Representing a new beginning, the track holds a specific assurance that makes the listener emotional and hopeful.
 
---
 
**MrSwearword** (11): it's not the music video version but this song is essentially one of the best in the history of recorded music.
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): i do prefer the greatest hits/video version of aifol, but it's a 10 regardless. if we were rating the other version it would get my 11. the lyrics are stupidly beautiful, as is that ethereal production. what a great closer.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented robots
 
**didney-worl** (10): Björk is love. Björk is life.
 
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Ambient music is among my favorite kinds and this one is no exception.
 
**enecks** (10): ALL. IS. FULL. OF. NUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT.
 
**nooodisaster** (10): Both this version (a remix she decided she preferred last minute), and the music video version (her original vision) are 10s for entirely different reasons. While the MV is a great single, this one is such a beautiful closer to an album. I love listening to this as I'm lying down for bed. It's so relaxing and peaceful. The song floats into existence, pit and patting down one raindrop at a time from the fog. All the anger, cold, bitterness, struggle. It doesn't seem to exist here.
 
**ryanyu10** (10): Absolutely gorgeous.
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): music video edition outsold but overall it's a very nice, airy and beautiful track
 
**awryj** (9.8): it's a more ambienty idm-y take on the song but in the end, the robot sex version >>> the album version, although both are magical and amazing and transcendental
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Thankfully, after Pluto tears your ears apart, Björk gracefully decides to close Homogenic with the transcendental anthem that's All is Full of Love; Björk sounds so serene and peaceful here, following up on the themes of enlightenment from Alarm Call, but as beautiful as All is Full of Love is, you can't really call it a happy ending. Maybe Björk is a little more at peace with herself now, but that doesn't change the fact that the subject of All is Full of Love still passes out on communicating with the poor lady; the song is more introspective than optimistic, acting as a calm sea even amongst a raging storm thundering above. There's no doubt that it's a gorgeous, breathtaking song that'll bless your sense of hearing, and it's just the perfect one to close Homogenic to.
 
**stansymash** (9): oh man this is much prettier than i remembered. i feel full of, you guessed it, love
 
**stardustanddinos** (8.5): I liked the other version better, but this song is good and fits well with the album, a fitting closer.
 
**technoprayers** (8): she’s that girl but the single version is a whole serve
 
**huntyphobic** (7.5): a cute closer but the repetition got a bit tiring
 
**Riddlemethis707** (7.5): The one on the greatest hits would be a 10
 
**Leixander** (7): I will never understand this song's appeal tbh
 
**notdallin** (7): atmospheric Bjork is the best Bjork, my ears are starting to feel a lil better from Pluto
 
**feetarefriends** (4): Rating the album version which is why it's kinda low

**Host Scores:**
 
**Wailord: 9 // Eli: 10**
 
Wailord: Ugh this served a major bop. Throughout this rate I’ve felt bad if I wasn’t in the highest scores section, but you literally need to give a 10 or higher for most of these songs.
 
Eli: As one of the, if not the, most intimate tracks on *Homogenic*, Bjork lets the listener into a world so personal it almost feels intrusive. With legato string parts and airy beats, “Unravel” tells the innermost feelings of longing. I mean, if [Thom Yorke calls it his favorite song of all time](https://www.nme.com/news/music/radiohead-645-1342950), it has to mean something.
 
 
---
 
**nooodisaster** (11): A masterpiece. I have a whole playlist for songs to listen to for my long-distance relationship, but I've never heard a song articulate what it's like better than "Unravel". It's a perfect lyrical poem (so perfect the verse just repeats lmao) that's all at once vivid, bizarre, tragic, romantic, relatable, and maybe a little bit hilarious. I feel the longing, I feel how alone she is, know how each day makes waiting to see them harder, your love a little weaker. And I know when you finally see them again how wonderful it is to make new love and stitch the thread of your hearts back once more.
 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): so so so beautiful
 
**awryj** (10): There is something magical in the ambience of this song. It sort of sounds like a prelude to Vespertine, but instead of snowy, the soundscape of this song is rainy and windy. It's absolutely amazing how the reverbed saxophone sounds here.
 
**cloudbustingmp3** (10): unravel is exactly what my wig does when I hear this beautiful song
 
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): My wig comes undone slowly unravels
 
**survivorjdmarina** (10): this is so beautifully haunting and ethereal
 
**technoprayers** (10): - I love the production and the poem esque lyrics
 
**stansymash** (9.7): god, the slow pulse of this track is just incredible. a tad faster and it wouldn't have the same impact as it does. the way she sings 'our love' is very very very good
 
**enecks** (9): Unravel my wig
 
**minibjork** (9): this was my favorite björk song for the longest and for good reason.
 
**MrSwearword** (9): production overshadows vocals slightly but it's still very good
 
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): That church organ is a nice touch. Completely heartbreaking.
 
**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Hey, so, are you fond of Björk's Icelandic accent? If not, then, oh, boy, you'd better be prepared to get used to how she pronounces the word 'unravel'. If you can handle her rolling rs, perhaps you'd spot a returning motif from Björk's music. That motif, incidentally, is her fear of abandonment. Tracks like Crying and Airplane from her first official record are the first hints of this recurring theme, and Unravel adapts Björk's anxieties to the dark atmosphere of Homogenic, featuring a hurt and upset woman breaking down and confessing her emotions to a lover not present in the room. The melody is unusually calm and a little operatic, but listening to the lyrics reveals that Björk feels more defeated than hopeful. Homogenic's moody subject matter starts to become prominent with Unravel, and the song does excellent work.
 
**huntyphobic** (7.5): I remember when I watched this video, which was my introduction to Bjork, I was just so confused on why the Tumblr gays stanned her so hard, but now I think I appreciate it more.
 
**notdallin** (5.2): I thought the production sounded familiar. Is this not just a weirder take on the better Guy Sigsworth produced “The Dumbing Down of Love” by Frou Frou? I know this came first and what not but this is not as good guys

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 8 // Eli: 7** 

It is the beginning of the *concept* of the album, which as an aside, is a cool concept, having a ‘half concept’ concept album. However, I feel like the album becomes a bit less musically coherent/interesting after this point.

**awryj** (10): Heartbreaking.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): And here begins Kate’s foray into concept albums. We begin the story after a calamity. We’re adrift after a wreck, and there’s no rescue in sight. What do you do? How do you hold on to hope when the temptation of sleep is so strong?

**didney-worl** (10): I'm already singing this to my future children every night.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Heartbreaking and yearning. I can feel the pain in her voice.

**huntyphobic** (10): “they smell like sleep” synesthesia queen, Lorde whomst?

**tapdancingpig** (10): Holy shit this is heavy.

**ryanyu10** (9.7): Calm and beautiful.

**notdallin** (9.4): tHE EMOTION IS THERE! wHAT IS THIS I FEEL…? IS IT EMPATHY? I FEEL THE THE WAVES LAPPING AGAINST ME, WANTING TO SLEEP, TO GIVE UP, TO COUNT SHEEP INSTEAD OF SWIMMING TO THE SHORE. ALL OF A SUDDEN I AM CRYING IN THE CLUB RN

**technoprayers** (9): - a really lovely song

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Does Kate Bush dream of fantastical sheep? Evidently, as we dip our toes into the Ninth Wave by listening to a track that's not quite experimental, but still more quaintly faint and whimsical than the previous songs on Hounds of Love. The ship Kate's gotten on has sinked, and though she's managed to survive, And Dream of Sheep describes Kate struggling to stay awake as she clings to her hold, floating around the ocean with no land in site. Despite the panic such a scenario would usually deliver, the song is sung dreamily, hinting that fatigue's slowly starting to settle down on the poor woman. Voices are heard as Kate drifts off to sleep, a recurring motif to be sampled as the Ninth Wave goes further on. What sounds like a lullaby at first proves to be a spell of doom, and the song's dark yet innocent-sounding melody is what makes it such a stellar segue into the album's second act.

**llieno94** (8): It took me awhile to warm up to this song because I thought it was kinda creepy, but I think its comforting now.

**MrSwearword** (8): I've had enough of being bored by her after such an opening track, but this isn't bad.

**nooodisaster** (8): I'm literally so tired plz Kate Bush.

**stansymash** (7.4): i guess we needed to cool off a bit i'm okay

**survivorjdmarina** (7): didn't think much of this song tbh...

**Wailord: 10 // Eli: 10**

Wailord: The introduction and production on this album is seriously so much better than Tidal, and is one of the reasons why I really prefer this album, and ultimately, think this is Fiona’s best album. 

**notdallin** (6): genius.com’s telling me this chorus is iconic…….. ok

Genius actually says that it is *ironic*, but iconic is pretty close too :eyes:

--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): a crazy opener for a crazy album

**Leixander** (10): YOU'RRRREEE AAAAALL I NEED

**llieno94** (10): This is quintessential Fiona. Totally sets the tone for the album. Her voice reaches such levels of rage.

**plastichaxan** (10): What an opener, probably the best one of the three, almost gets my eleven.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): fiona made SEVERAL points with this track huh

**tapdancingpig** (10): Opening with this song was a perfect choice on Fiona’s part. It captivates absolutely, and that word arrangement isn’t an accident. There was nothing I could focus on for those five minutes but the songwriting, the production, and Fiona’s voice.

**stansymash** (9.4): the way this song just viciously snaps over and over is the greatest little thing isn't it

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): this album opens with a growled chorus, setting the stage for Fiona’s angriest record

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Make no mistake; no matter how much we debate about how influential or adventurous When The Pawn... is compared to the other two albums in the rate, the record's opener, On the Bound, proves once and for all that Fiona Apple is a lady that can belt her damn hear out. While On the Bound might prove slightly annoying at times for lasting well over five minutes and mainly being composed of the same chorus, if you lean back and temper the song's criticisms, it's no use trying to deny what a bombastic introduction to When The Pawn.... this is. Not stopping at utilising jazz-adjacent songwriting to reach its full potential, On the Bound is the perfect exposure to themes that pop out through Fiona's lyricism, from insecurity to irony and contrast, and it does this just so perfectly that at the end you can't help but be a huge fan of what On the Bound does, despite its slightly flawed composition. And you can't deny, no matter how hard you try, that it's delightfully awesome to hear Fiona declaim 'Hell don't know my fury'.

**nooodisaster** (8.7): can u stop reading my life for one second Fiona??? But seriously, this is a GREAT opener. It's so over-the-top and theatrical with a daring production. The lyrics are strong too, especially the switch at the end of the chorus.

**ryanyu10** (8.2): Strong intro, if a bit repetitive. Nice outro portion.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I don’t know why but this one reminds of a construction site in the city at night...maybe it’s the ending instrumental

**enecks** (8): immakeepitrealwithyouchiefican'tdocommentsforfionaapple

**huntyphobic** (8): this really makes me feel like I’ve just walked into a saloon with my thiddies OUT

**minibjork** (8): YOU'RE AAAAAAAAAAAALL I NEEEEED

**awryj** (7.8): No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me more to do / It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself, I make it bitter is a mood and a LYRIC. Too bad the song feels kinda bloated

**technoprayers** (7): - a really great opener

**jednaowca** (6): I have such mixed feelings about this song. I'd like it a lot, but the chorus is what kinda ruins it for me, it just feels so generic. I like it more in the context of the entire album, because it's not a bad album opener.

**MrSwearword** (6): good song but kind of a weak song to open with

**notdallin** (6): genius.com’s telling me this chorus is iconic…….. ok
