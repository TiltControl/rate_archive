**This Comment Spoke To Me Personally:**

**llieno94** (8): This song was perfect when I was pissed off in high school

--- 

**Host Scores:** 

**Wailord: 10 // Eli: 8**

Wailord: This is the perfect, well done angst song. It isn’t immature, it is justified, angry, laced with malice but just enough spit in it to make you feel like you *did* do something wrong. The recipient deserved all of this spite. 

--- 

**awryj** (10): The centerpiece of the whole album. Fuckin' GO

**feetarefriends** (10): Second greatest song about being ANGRY surpassed only by Fiona's own Regret

**MrSwearword** (10): the claws are OUT in this song and I live

**ryanyu10** (10): Very solid standout in this album. Works very well following two very aggressive songs, and builds into a rippling song, moving back and forth from that aggression to a lighter, almost more forgiving tone, that I think really encapsulates the core of this album.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): While the previous two songs may have been lacklustre if you take into account how good When The Pawn... is otherwise, Get Gone brings back the Fiona of Limp back for the album's finale, acting as the climax of an imaginary and nonlinear narrative purely built on the foundation of Fiona's emotions. The song is another call out, but instead of being directly addressed to a former love interest, whether actual or fictional, Get Gone is a non-exclusive yet deeply intimate tale of a failed venture into a healthy romantic relationship. Fiona's anger here is tangible, most deeply inflected on the line 'He don't give a shit about me', colouring Get Gone with the colourful expressions we've all come to expect and love from the lady. Get Gone is the last truly great moment of When The Pawn..., and it might just be the record's best.

**stansymash** (9.1): he dont give a sssshhhh

**minibjork** (9): FUCKING GO

**nooodisaster** (9): Ugh, so powerful. "Cause I do know what's good for me" feels like a direct response to her earlier song "A Mistake" where she's doing what's bad for her, and here is saying that she's smarter than just her mistakes. I LOVE when artists reference and build a story in their album, so I ate that shit up.

**survivorjdmarina** (9): it's a more mellow track but i still stan tbh

**huntyphobic** (8.5): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DaOJYPqVMAI6jD0.jpg:large

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 9// Eli: 9** 

Wailord: This is such a forgettable Kate track, and I really don’t know how it got this far. Nothing against Kate, she had some of the top songs of the rate easily, but this being in the second day just never really made sense to me, but it was pretty well received. 

--- 

**Banananaise** (8): twitter poll, does the woman of The Ninth Wave survive or is she reincarnated

--- 

**awryj** (10): I feel like some people might not like this song because of how jarring the transition to it is, but I think it makes sense in the context of the album. The entirety of The Ninth Wave is about drowning, being unconscious, dying, except for this song - this is a jumpcut to the morning after the accident. After feeling like she was deprived of everything, the woman is confessing her love to the world, because "she loves it better now". It's a fitting ending to a fantastic story.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): great ending to an amazing album

**Leixander** (10): underrated closer!

**nooodisaster** (10): :,)

**tapdancingpig** (10): Not gonna lie, this actually made me cry.

**technoprayers** (10): - the best closer on this rate

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.8): the night of terror on the sea ends in rescue and a sunrise. It’s beautiful and heartwarming beyond belief.

**ryanyu10** (9.5): This is a very nice end to the album.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): For a closing song, perhaps The Morning Fog sticks out too much like a sore thumb. After the rest of the Ninth Wave featuring gorgeous sounds that filled its atmosphere like shades fill a painting, The Morning Fog sounds like warm, soft laughter rather than an imposing vocal run or howl, and it can take awhile to adjust to the shock of this shift. But much like Hello Earth, The Morning Fog only gets better with more listens and more background; it's short and simple, but it expresses the Hounds of Love's sentiments so well that it ends up being extremely hard not to tear up at 'I love my brothers'. And what a sentiment that is: as I stated in Jig of Life's comment, all of Kate's family worked on Hounds of Love, from her parents to her brothers Paddy and John. The fog starts to clear, and with a smile, Hounds of Love, one of the most magnificent albums of the century, dissolves into silence.

**minibjork** (8.5): waking up from a nightmare into the arms of loved ones >>

**notdallin** (8.5): a nigh-perfect closing to a nigh-perfect album. How have I never paid attention to this album before this rate? I’d like to thank the hosts for opening my eyes! I love you!

**survivorjdmarina** (8.5): it's really poppy and probably the most upbeat song of the ninth wave.

**stansymash** (8.2): don't worry guys we have time for one last quiet art pop jam. stream wuthering heights

**huntyphobic** (7.8): I’ve never really felt truly pleased with The Morning Fog as a closer to the album because it’s quite short and content, which I feel like is a complete 180 on the rest of the albums grandeur sound and lyricism? I guess it’s a good closer to the story of the ninth wave, but it feels unfulfilling. But idk it sill kind of bops lol

**MrSwearword** (5): boring

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 9// Eli: 9** 

Wailord: I really liked this. It never did great in the rate, never touched the top 10, but never dropped out of the top 20, it just kinda existed throughout the rate. The effects and production make this a huge stand out for an album track, and really showcased just what Kate was going for with this project.

--- 

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented PC music

--- 
**awryj** (10): If Cloudbusting wasn't a literal masterpiece, I would give this my 11. It's absolutely mindblowing this song is from 1985. The production here is just cutting-edge. And it's just Kate and her little Fairlight. Grimes fucking wishes.

**blackvelvet** (10): If you told me it's part of Suspiria soundtrack I'd believe you.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This song sounds like if you could hear sleep paralysis

**enecks** (10): WIG OFF more like

**Leixander** (10): YOU WON'T BLEED. pinks and poises,,,

**MrSwearword** (10): now this is the weird shit I can get into

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Invented theatricality

**plastichaxan** (10): The "Look who's here to see you!" part left me shaking and the whole song is just serve after serve it almost got my eleven it was so so so close.

**ryanyu10** (10): Definitely the trippiest song on this album, but certainly one of my favourites. It just so effectively crafts this colourful narrative using such a wide variety of sounds. Almost my 11.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): this is probably the scariest song I have ever listened to

**nooodisaster** (9.4): This bitch is crazy!!

**Banananaise** (9): the first minute... jesus christ. haunting.

**huntyphobic** (9): I remember being SHOOK to the very core listening to this for the first time, can’t wait to read these reactions lmao

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Looks like we've come to one of the most polarising songs this sub's ever had to lay its ears on! Waking the Witch is one of the most conceptual tracks on the Ninth Wave, being a lose reconstruction of a medieval European witch trial with Kate as the accused party. The song starts with a crazy collection of vocal samples, featuring everybody from Kate's family to her schoolteachers to her apparent love interests telling her to wake up after emerging on Under Ice. Narratively, these samples sound like an audio hallucination; it's no surprise, then, that the song suddenly morphs into something absolutely insane. A demonic voice that sounds like a twisted version of the Beast's from Beauty and the Beast screams as Kate as she chants in Latin and tries to rise out of the water to no success, scaring the shit out of listeners and making them wonder what the hell is going on. We hear a modern day jury anachronistically declare Kate 'GUILTY! GUILTY! GUILTY' and if you've somehow managed to actually follow what's going on on your first time being exposed to the album, you fear that Kate's going to be thrown into a watery grave. Then a mysterious voice (which happens to be her brother, John Carder Bush) commands her to get out of the water. Helicopter blades are heard, making you question which part of the song is fantastical and which part isn't. Then, Waking the Witch ends, leaving you stunned. It's a brilliant song, and its magnificence is further heightened should one know the history of witch trials and their relationship to female oppression.

**stansymash** (9): i really hope you bitches realise how genius this song is. do it for me, /u/stansymash

**tapdancingpig** (9): In this song, the main character begins to hallucinate. And frankly, you kind of start to hallucinate, too, because Kate Bush’s production fuckery here leaves you completely disoriented.

**minibjork** (8.5): if i ever deejayed i would play this song at least 10 times a night

**notdallin** (8.2): skits? A cohesive narrative? Chopped and screwed vocals? Latin lyrics? WE (freshly) STAN AN AVANT GARDE QUEEN.

**jednaowca** (8): This is insane and makes me think of Suspiria (original, I know)

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I love this in concept but the demonic voices are too much

**technoprayers** (8): I love how the dialogue adds to the song

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 8// Eli: 8** 

Wailord: I remember hearing a song like this, but with this song being part of a big concept, I found most of the last half of the album to blend together too much to really have a good idea of what was what. I like the sound, and the feel of the last half, but I can’t say what exactly I liked/disliked here.

--- 

**awryj** (10): If space travel becomes commonplace in my lifetime, this is the soundtrack to my first reentry

---

**tapdancingpig** (11): The absolutely brilliant climax to this half of the album.

**awryj** (10): If space travel becomes commonplace in my lifetime, this is the soundtrack to my first reentry

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): hello earth goodbye wig

**huntyphobic** (10): this song is a masterpiece and I wish I was able to formulate my thoughts into words to describe how I feel about this song, but I honestly can’t.

**Leixander** (10): System.out.println("Hello Earth.");

**ryanyu10** (10): One of the most grandiose and eclectic space songs. The choir in the middle is absolutely stunning.

**technoprayers** (10): - the call and response esque chorus is everything with the production

**nooodisaster** (9.5): I wish the interludes were shorter for replayability, but everything else about this is such a masterpiece. The imagery of being able to blot Earth out with a hand is so clear, and puts us right up there with her. Then the pre-chorus and chorus are incredible, building so much and having a power you'd never except from the tranquility of the verses. I mean even just the line "Hello Earth!" is brilliant. The long interlude chants reflect how she's drifting off, as the first time I listened to this I thought the song had ended several times before the verses brought me back. Music is art y'all.

**minibjork** (9): this feels like standing in a lighthouse in the middle of a storm while watching the crashing waves of the ocean below.

**notdallin** (8.7): this song is a full-fledged adventure

**stansymash** (8.5): earth is a big building

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): A sprawling, geographical song that may overstay its welcome a little but not much to be sure

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): It was difficult to feel as if Hello Earth wasn't somewhat unfinished during my first few spins of Hounds of Love. While the song is certainly beautiful, Kate's singing also composes a small portion of it, but unlike Jig of Life, the song forgoes any fiddles and poems for a holy chant filling its spare minutes' silence. Since Hello Earth occupies a full six minutes, it's hard not to feel like the song veers a little into tedious territory if you're not already familiar with the album's storyline. Once you are, though, the silent night Hello Earth portrays is much more profound. Kate finally makes her way towards victory here, but instead of loud triumph proclaimed by horns and trumpets, she sings 'Get out of the water' deep and grand, creating an impression of personal growth and maturation that slowly starts to sink into your heart. It's then this song gains its spirit, appearing much more sacred to you than prolonged or overwrought. Hello Earth's message is clear: Kate is making her way home.

**survivorjdmarina** (7.5): it kinda overstays its welcome...

**MrSwearword** (0): before the slight switch, the song sounded like the lesser, inferior version of the opening track and I hate it

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 10// Eli: 10**

Wailord: This is soooooo good. Probably my favorite Bjork song in this rate outside of Bachelorette (let’s gooooooo). Something about this just hits all my notes for an alternative song, and for awhile, it was top 5 for a good part of the rate, but slowly fell, despite being just short of a 9.0 average!

Eli: A stunning opener, the ethereal and entrancing “Hunter” sets the theme for Bjork’s magnum opus. Beginning with a fascinating beat, Bjork lets the listener know that the electronic beats that filled her previous album, *Post*, are here to stay— but in a completely different form. A sense of techno-futurism is embraced on the track, which finely compliments the singer’s extravagant vocals which she still manages to handle with aplomb.


---

**My Two Favorite Comments**

**notdallin** (7.1): just put in the right earbud 1/3 of the way through the song—TURNS OUT I WAS MISSING A LOT

**stansymash** (10): bjork could hunt me any day of the week, shoot me in the face and i would say thank you

---

**Agusarg** (11): My favourite Bjork song, it could be released ten years from now and it would still sound futuristic. Fantastic mix between the strings and the beat, combined with one of her best vocal perfomances.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): there is no better opener for such a stupidly incredible album. being about such a personal, self-reflective yet existential topic, bjork's initimate vocals paired with that pulsing production needs no words.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): when the cello comes in… WHEW!

**enecks** (10): Bjork hunting for grammys like. Also this shit slaps. Like Bjork slaps her prey.

**MrSwearword** (10): normally I don't give full marks to anything with subtlety, but this opener is weird as shit but subtle too

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Get in loser we're going hunting

**ryanyu10** (10): An ethereal introduction that foretells the grand things to come in this album, this track stands out as passionate and almost hypnotic. Almost my 11, really grew on me over time.

**stansymash** (10): bjork could hunt me any day of the week, shoot me in the face and i would say thank you

**stardustanddinos** (10): This was the first Bjork song I heard – you can probably imagine what an assault on the senses this song was. I was entirely unprepared for a string arrangement on top of distorted electronica, and never realized how much I needed a song like this. Bjork has a beautiful voice; soaring with grace over the already complex experience this album is.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): HOW SCANDINAVIAN OF ME

**technoprayers** (10): - that opener, period. The way she declares “I’m a hunter // I’m going hunting” really left the girls dead in the street

**awryj** (9.8): This was my first Bjork song ever. I must've been 7 or so when I saw the music video for this song and I was very creeped out. Also I remember my mom saying "see, awryj? this is Bjork and she's half-Eskimo". I BELIEVED HER LIES FOR 8 YEARS.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): I feel like Bjork is stalking me through the woods in the middle of the night. Jesus Christ.

**nooodisaster** (9): We're introduced to the icy theme right of the bat with this chilling and kinda creepy opener. The drum beat is really militaristic, which added to her robotic lyrics all make for an amazing atmospheric first wind. Bjork seems dangerous here, weathered by life but ready to find the art in it.

**Banananaise** (8.5): that drumbeat!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): If you don't count the bridge (?) where Björk comes out as a closet council communist by yelling 'I thought I could organise freedom/how very Scandinavian of me!', Hunter isn't a bombastic start for Homogenic. Unlike Post's heavy, industrial-inspired Army of Me, Hunter is a song that slowly creeps into your head, no doubt thanks to the dissonant humming of drums repeating itself note after note along with synthetic background voices, as Björk makes use of a softer voice than you'd expect. Aside from the moment I mentioned earlier, there's no belting to be seen on Hunter, and the majority of the track consists of the same melodic segue, never stopping for a dramatic chorus or pause. While its hypnotism fails to connect to me as much as Björk's previous openers, the song is still a holy herald, acting as the low percussion before the arrival of an empress. As strange as it sounds at first, there's no other place to imagine it than at the album's beginning.

**huntyphobic** (8): what a nice way to start off an album, it’s so etherial and chill, which is an interesting contrast to the lyrical content.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): “how scandinavian of me”

**tapdancingpig** (8): The production kind of reminds me of a Mario level’s music, and I mean that as the sincerest complement.

**notdallin** (7.1): just put in the right earbud 1/3 of the way through the song—TURNS OUT I WAS MISSING A LOT

--- 

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 9// Eli: 8.5**

Wailord: The tea here is that there is a better song on this album about the sky/clouds. This song is skinny, but not as skinny as the other fluffy white stuff.

--- 

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): this is just nice and fun, but there are better songs about clouds on the record

---

**awryj** (10): Oh, you can't dance to Kate Bush huh? Well watch me diddle-lee-dadiddle-lee-daing my bussy to this anthem!!!

**Banananaise** (10): and that cloud - that cloud, it looks like ireland! / come on, blow me a kiss now GOD that is the SWEETEST line EVER

**blackvelvet** (10): I feel like I should listen to it while standing on a tall cliff in the middle of a storm for maximum effect.

**nooodisaster** (10): "You never understood me/You never really tried." Ugh literally every song on this album reminds me so much of Lorde, her MIND. The mix of abstract but beautiful imagery with the occasional mic drop declaration works so well lyrically. And the production is FUCKING INSANE, especially in the original, non-Spotify version. "And pause for the jet-" slays me. Gospel fever dream brilliance.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): miss bush snapped with those vocals at the end

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): this is just nice and fun, but there are better songs about clouds on the record

**ryanyu10** (9.7): A bit less fleshed out than the two preceding songs in my opinion, but still really solid.

**notdallin** (9.6): I officially now know why people recommend Kate Bush if you like Joanna Newsom—their voices have a similar sonic quality that I appreciate. It’s like if Joanna Newsom sprouted big hair and fronted a new wave band…I’M INTO IT

**huntyphobic** (9.5): this song really makes me feel like I’ve arrived in a big city with nothing but some suitcases, and my hopes and dreams

**Leixander** (9.5): It is hard to not move your shoulders at least when you hear this song.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Hearing the opening notes of The Big Sky makes my brain fall into the trap of thinking Hounds of Love is a conceptual album all throughout, for its theatrical, absolutely batshit insane nature makes me envision Kate heading to a cruise ship with her brother accompanying her to meet the patron of the love she's singing about on the titular track, dancing under the big, brilliant morning sky to spontaneous choreography and trying to shrug off the memories of a former flame lurking in her head by screaming her ass off, because, hey, why not? While The Big Sky is definitely the most radio-friendly track on Hounds of Love, there's also a spectacle to be heard here that makes it fall squarely on the category of art pop; it's impossible to listen to this and not feel like you're bouncing on clouds (spoiler alert: we'll do something like that soon) and riding away on invisible flying horses. I don't think it's as perfect as the previous two songs, because, to be honest, Kate's enunciation is a little murky here, but at the end of the day, I'm not sure I even really care. Bonus points for the singles mix, which I can never resist putting on repeat.

**stansymash** (9.5): the sky is already really big and she added the word big and yet that concept is still not as big as this song sounds. Kate's vocals are amazing on this track, the way she wilds out towards the second half is awesome

**enecks** (9): UGH she did that. The sky outsold your faves.

**technoprayers** (9): - there are some points she has made

**llieno94** (8.5): I love her almost tribal like chanting combined with the gospel style choir line.

**minibjork** (8.5): PAUSE FOR THE JET ✈️

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): This sounds like it should be played over the end credits of some movie about kids getting out of the school for the summer

**MrSwearword** (5): too middling

Wailord: Neither Eli nor I were very impressed by this, mostly because this just wasn’t a sound we digged. It is an interesting component to her album, but as its own, it’s just ok to me. Also, throughout the entire rate, life was misspelled in the rate ballot, and when you guys tried to fix it it created a lot of issues since it read the correct spelling as a separate song.

**notdallin** (8.1): can y’all keep a secret? ………… I freaking LOVE new age music. It’s a SUPER guilty pleasure for me. I unironically stan celtic woman. Don’t expose tho fam, it could ruin my indie and pop cred

---

**enecks** (11): Ugh Jigs are the best genre and this is a wig snatcher. Best song of the 80's. The whole fucking decade.

**awryj** (10): I put this 10... Here

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): she snatches my wig here. She snatches my wig here. She snatches my wig… OVER HERE!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): To quote a youtube commentator, “WTF I’m irish now”.

**huntyphobic** (10): this song makes my pussy lips do an Irish jig…wig!

**Leixander** (10): Suddenly a rainbow appeared in the sky as it turned greener each second. Now there is a leprechaun snatching my wig and handing me a pot of gold. Thanks Kate. I am now rich with an Irish/EU passport but bald.

**minibjork** (10): welcome to the underappreciated bop of this album. give urself to the jig ladies!

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Are you having a hard time adjusting to the Ninth Wave's atmosphere? Have no fear; Jig of Life brings back the kind of art pop melody you'd expect on Hounds of Love's first side for a brief moment of time, tinging the entire song with an absurdly catchy fiddle melody gratuitously provided by collaborative musicians from Ireland. The song advances the album's storyline by acting as a musical representation of Kate's future reaching out to her present, an interpretation that only enhances the mystic of Jig of Life and makes it that much more of a bold, religious experience. Though Kate actually only provides vocals for a minute or two, she sounds alive again, no longer lost or stranded at sea, and at the song's climax, her words travel left and right to declare 'I put this moment...here' thrice, before erupting into an absolutely glorious poem by John Carder Bush, who happens to be her older brother. Kate's entire family worked on Hounds of Love together, but John's part in his sister's album shines the brightest, featuring his booming voice reciting lines he composed by himself, ending the song wildly and running through sunlit forests. The best song on the Ninth Wave bar none, which is saying something.

**perfumevee** (10): There's something about this that I just love.

**stardustanddinos** (10): Holy fuck this track. The recited verses are haunting and the music is just, wow. Mind-blowing.

**tapdancingpig** (10): This is one of the most conceptual songs on the album. It will probably be robbed, but at this point, I was completely engrossed in the story of the album.

**technoprayers** (10): - whew a serve, it just makes me feel like I’m dancing with the royals

**nooodisaster** (9.2): Such a turn up. I feel the desperation of Kate's future self, and the music perfectly enhances that feeling. The callbacks (forwards?) to "Waking the Witch" are crazy. When that dude goes "Over HERE!" my panties drop.

**Banananaise** (9): this really reminds me of The Red Shoes. the energy is incredible, i have heavy fauxstalgia for that period of time in the 80s-90s when traditional celtic culture was really popular for some reason

**jednaowca** (9): I love the bagpipes or whatever it is, I have no shame

**survivorjdmarina** (9): maybe she snapped with this one. those male vocals at the end? ICONIC

**stansymash** (8.5): my instinctual comment i was gonna write was gonna say "lads be jigging" but i'm beginning to question whether thats a good idea. mainly because its not funny

**notdallin** (8.1): can y’all keep a secret? ………… I freaking LOVE new age music. It’s a SUPER guilty pleasure for me. I unironically stan celtic woman. Don’t expose tho fam, it could ruin my indie and pop cred

**Wailord: 10// Eli: 10**

Wailord: Honestly, I really don’t have anything amazing to say other than she really did snap. Everything about this song is pure Fiona Apple anger and writing, and more refined production. This is top 5 Fiona, ever.

--- 
**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): that chorus goes HAWWRDDDDDDD

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): invented flaccid dicks

**jednaowca** (10): Everybody knows songs full of raw emotions are Fiona's thing, but Limp is this x1000. The anger is so strong, the first time I listened to this song a few times in a row (yes, I'm one of those people) I felt really upset, sick and uneasy afterwards. The amount of disdain she puts in the word "baby" in the second chorus is everything. And the drums!

**Leixander** (10): a classic "she snapped!" comment.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i love her attitude

**ryanyu10** (10): First real standout of the album – ramps up in a dramatic manner that draws the listener in and really conveys how she real feels.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Nothing can sound more furious than the scorn of a woman who realises that she's been mistreated, and Limp does nothing to disprove that statement. The song is a brilliant revolving door, making you go in and out of the illusion of Fiona's ex-relationship, and the lady herself arrives at the truth in all bitterness and shade with a flood of sharp, agonised metaphors that burn their way into your ears. Limp is like being in a court of law - Fiona swiftly delivers the evidence with lines such as 'You're fond of your trigger then you blame me gun', taunting what remains for a pathetic excuse of a human by banging her gravel and reaching a damning verdict: 'It won't be long before you're lying limp in your own hands'. The tea has been *spilled*.

**stansymash** (9.3): this song is so punchy! is she telling someone to die? cause thats really cool

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Damn she went for the balls...literally!

**technoprayers** (9): - the way she went off, loves it

**awryj** (8.5): i love U + Ur Hand

**llieno94** (8.5): The drum solo on this song is transcendent. Also one of her best opening lines.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): vine I can't sleep because of that [Genius annotation that "lying limp in your own hands" refers to him not being able to masturbate.]

**MrSwearword** (8): just short of great

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 10// Eli: 10**

Wailord: A magical lead single, and was ultimately paid dust by the users of /r/popheads. At this point in the rate, it is important to note that any song in the top 10 would likely be the top 3 in any other rate, or even win most. Every song in the top 10 is legendary and received some of the best scores in popheads history.

Eli: Ah, the lead single to the everso fantastic album that is *When the Pawn…*. “Fast As You Can” finds itself somewhere in between jazz fusion and piano rock– and does so perfectly. With a upbeat drum part and a somewhat perplexing piano part, Fiona’s lyrics about the highs and lows of a relationship take the listener on an auditory journey.


--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): i performed fast as you can a few years ago with this band i was in. that was really the point where i started stanning fiona, so i guess i like, owe my life to this song

**Agusarg** (10): One of her best, everything about it is incredible.

**awryj** (10): the switching beat is everything, this better go top 15

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): ugh the frantic pace of this song is SO satisfying. It’s almost like, white girl rapping in the verses but it’s also the only time that’s meant in a complimentary way. The chorus is menacing, and the slow bits are such a great contrast.

**huntyphobic** (10): now this is what I call pussy popping! The amount of switch ups in this song? Bohemian Rhapsody could never.

**kanyewestrep3** (10): top 15 song all time

**Leixander** (10): the bop of this album

**llieno94** (10): a top 5 Fiona song imo

**MrSwearword** (10): her crazy works really well when the production is on point. The crowning jewel of When the Pawn...

**ryanyu10** (10): I don’t think there’s any song that captures the mix of emotions that goes into love and heartbreak as well as this one. The sudden, unexpected break in speed in the bridge accentuates her apparent mania in such a way that’s immediately relatable, while also providing for just the right amount of experimentalism that it remains easily approachable whilst simultaneously musically interesting. Almost my 11 (as in I had a write-up for this as 11 but changed it).

**technoprayers** (10): - my favorite song on the album and I love how its a single

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Probably the most relatable song in the whole album for me.

**survivorjdmarina** (9.5): damn ma that pitch change in the middle of the song

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): i feel threatened

**Banananaise** (8): this song is the one that really jumped out at me

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Composed of soft hooks and plastic production, Fast As You Can is a little more barebones than several other songs on When The Pawn..., and, unfortunately, it's also the first song to be anything short of remarkable. While the chorus aims to be an obvious earworm, the simple jazz atmosphere of its respective record does it no favours, foregoing production that might have helped it achieved its desired goals. The song is still entertaining, but the way it trickles into your brain is more of an annoyance than an actual praiseworthy element.

**notdallin** (7.1): that bridge change in tempo tho

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Whoever chose this as lead single was on crack!! Like the tempo changes alone would slay mainstream listeners in ANY decade. I read something about how even tho it's faster and slower, the beat never changes, which symbolizes the relationship??? Idk, I'm not smart enough for this shit. This song tries SO much and for me didn't always succeed. Anywho, the actual hook is good but really short, the bridge is actually really sweet and sad yet weird, and the verses are... a lot. Fiona Apple is a mess y'all, and I am too lmao.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): A little too disjointed and all over the place for me.

Wailord: This song did next to nothing for me. It fits the atmosphere and feel of the album to that point, and I get how it was so loved, but meant little to nothing to me outside of that, and I really have no other way to explain why I just don’t love it…

---
**huntyphobic** (11): The progression of Kates feelings of falling in love throughout this song are relatable and interesting, her storytelling skills through her lyricism to show how she goes from the vulnerability caused by her uncertainty of wanting to fall in love, to feeling dependant on her lover….wig

**perfumevee** (11): It was close between a few song and this one but this just felt right.

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): what a killer opening two tracks

**awryj** (10): Someday I will be as fierce as the strings in this song

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): IT’S IN THE TREES! IT’S COMING! An unhinged adventure in the best way, the title track feels like a mission statement to the album and her approach to love.

**enecks** (10): UGH she did that. Queen of fox metaphors.

**Leixander** (10): do do doo do doo

**minibjork** (10): "take my shoes off and throw them in the lake / and i'll be two steps on the water" is the line that got me throught my fifteenth year of life.

**nooodisaster** (10): Utter perfection. From the first second's sample to the thumping beat that gives the entire song so much forward momentum, to lyrical punches like "I've always been a coward/I never know what's good for me" to the beautiful imagery. I can feel my heart swelling with emotion that's hard to place but definitely there. A R T.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Hounds of Love is two minutes shorter than Running Up That Hill, which is why I chose it for my karaoke video project in my Information Technology class. Unfortunately, that also means I have traumatic memories associated with the song, because I spent almost four hours trying to align my presentation's texts with the lyrics and the agony of perfecting my work still haunts my soul to this day. I've grown out of my bitterness, though, because currently I'm finding it unacceptable to give Hounds of Love anything but a 10. While the track before it tells a story through sheer grandiose, Hounds of Love is an excellent introduction to Kate's strength as a lyrical narrator, utilizing romantic imagery that makes you feel as if Kate's fulfilled her love for classic literature by going on to live in a cabin in the woods in Edwardian England. For as much as a fan of Holmes as I am, I have to question who produced the superior Hounds in British culture; was it Arthur Conan Doyle or Kate Bush?

**rotating3Dtext** (10): it ends too soon!

**ryanyu10** (10): Aggressive beginning grows into a lovely, heartfelt tune.

**stardustanddinos** (10): THE BEST song on the album for me. The pounding drums and the cello give it a feeling of restless forward momentum, a euphoric release, a feeling of running through the woods with the cold wind hitting your face. Very few songs have ever given me the rush that listening to this song has given me.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): "and thROOOOOOOOOOOW them in a lake" gets me everytime

**technoprayers** (10): - one of the best title tracks of all time

**stansymash** (9.3): throoOOOOOWWWW

**llieno94** (9): The barking dog noise she does here reminds me of Regina Spektor’s Folding Chair where she does a dolphin noise.

**notdallin** (8.6): I adore the way she says “THRRRRRROW!”

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (7): It’s a little too on the sad side for me but I love the fake dog barks. They’re just so charming

**MrSwearword** (6): it didn't go anywhere but it was cute

**MaximumFriendship** (4.5): Something about this right after Running felt bad. The intro also really doesn't do it for me.

**Host Scores:**

**Wailord: 11// Eli: 10**

Wailord: A beautiful, endearing song metaphorically analyzing a paper bag to a love and life with another. It is tear jerking, and almost spiteful, but in an accepting way. I haven’t had much time to write a bunch for these songs, but know that this song is my favorite Fiona song of all time, and I’d write a paper about it if I had the time.

Eli: Written after mistaking a plastic bag for a dove, “Paper Bag” is a beautiful jazz/pop tune that embodies unrealistic expectations and let-downs in life, particularly in the people around you. A favorite of Fiona fans since its release, the track earned a Grammy nomination and critical acclaim. With a flowing piano part and and elusive drums, Fiona’s smooth vocals are what make the track simultaneously heart-wrenching and heartwarming.

--- 

**minibjork** (10): i always end up watching the music video for this @ 2am while dancing around my room trying not to wake up my roommate.

---

**notdallin** (11): “Hunger hurts, and I want him so bad, oh it kills / Cause I know I'm a mess he don't wanna clean up / I got to fold cause these hands are too shaky to hold / Hunger hurts, but starving works / When it costs too much to love” alright! That’s a wrap! We’re done here! You can all go home now!

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): i think this is, lyrically, one of fiona's best songs, especially pre-idler wheel wise

**awryj** (10): I'm just shocked at how great Fiona is at expressing feelings in her lyrics. How poignant every word is and how fitting the whole lyrics are. It's not even about the song (although it's groovy as hell), she could release it as a poem and I'd still be left agape.

**didney-worl** (10): This one sounds most similar to the perfection that is The Idler Wheel.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I know this is the most accessible track on the album but it still deserves a ten. At least Fiona saw the plastic bag as a dove and didn’t take it as a signal that she was drifting through the wind, wanting to start again.

**llieno94** (10): sometimes I wonder if this song is her masterpiece...

**minibjork** (10): i always end up watching the music video for this @ 2am while dancing around my room trying not to wake up my roommate.

**MrSwearword** (10): she's revealed herself to be fuckin' nuts but in a stark manner. Slay, you mental case.

**perfumevee** (10): This takes me back to some angsty times in my life.

**plastichaxan** (10): Fiona really did come on and put a little love here in my void huh.

**ryanyu10** (10): Was my favourite song for a few months in high school. Really shows her strength as a songwriter. Even being one of the less experimental tracks, it still feels like it pushes the bounds a bit more in the subtle desperation that she sings with. Amazing production as well. Almost my 11.

**stardustanddinos** (10): This song is simply brilliant; the horns and drums are infectious! The lyrics are poignant. Maybe being in a relationship shouldn't come at the cost of sacrificing your own personality and individuality? Or is it as easy as stating it? I don't know how Fiona bottled that oddly specific feeling into a song, but she did and god my life is better for it.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): the music video for this song just makes it better. also queen of knowing she's a mess

**technoprayers** (10): - two serves in a row, wow her mind

**stansymash** (9.6): biodegradable queen

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): I love the imagery tbh

**huntyphobic** (9): Sustainability queen! Plastic bags are shaking

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): don’t litter

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Have you ever felt like a plastic bag. Drifting through the...alright, I'll stop. At first, the popularity of Paper Bag certainly puzzled me. The track was not immediately as striking as Limp or On The Bound, both sonically and vocally, and though the melody was pleasant enough, it took a close listen for me to realise that the main appeal of Paper Bag is how much of a poet Fiona is in it. The song still isn't one of my favourites, but there's no ignoring how much Fiona's wit and personality shines in the track's ironic metaphor, and, as always, the woman's sharp tongue utilises the jazz elements in the song very strongly.

**tapdancingpig** (8.4): This seems like an odd choice for a single, but it’s still a pretty cool song.

**nooodisaster** (7.5): "And I said, 'So's everything' but he didn't get it," is my favorite line in this, it's soo good. Just so relatable in being in your own head. Also, as Genius says, "Probably the most complex blowjob quip ever committed to melody." Beyond that, yea, it's a song.

deleted: # Fiona Apple - When the Pawn...

---

**Overall average**: 8.469

---

**TragicKingdom1**: I was slightly shocked by this album. I was under the impression that Fiona's music isn't very similar to the song "Criminal," my only previous exposure to her, but thankfully that slightly-off-kilter piano sound that I love is present throughout. It didn't mix things up that much from song to song (aside from an increase in tension in the back half) but I still enjoyed nearly every song. [Grade: B+]

**minibjork**: fiona just understands ya know?

**stansymash**: (based purely on memory) hits the conflict he thinks like a king what he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight and he'll win the whole thing fore he enters the ring, what something something matter when your mind is your might. so when you move forward dont do something or other. this line was very complicated. something else. and it wont even matter cause you know that youre right. i think thats about it

**stardustanddinos**: Not gonna lie, this is the album I had the least expectations for going in. But I was pleasantly surprised, by Fiona’s vocal delivery, jazz influenced production and unabashedly sentimental lyricism. I wouldn’t call this a best of all-time album, more of a best of the year maybe. However, that is not to diminish the quality of album by any measure – it is a delightful work, with its quiet charms. The jazz-rock production is so easy on the ears, yet so innovative. Fiona’s vocals, however, are what make the album soar, with the ever-present tinge of regret, longing or maybe even love. An interesting listen, and I fail to understand why this is not more popular.

**patronsaintofaspies**: It's funny that this is the record in the rate I'm least familiar with, because, evidently, I still had a lot to say about it. Perhaps that's the power of Fiona Apple's artistry and songwriting, both of which I find highly fascinating. While When The Pawn... is a flawed record, carrying one song I don't care for and two I barely like, it's a fact that despite lacking the bombastic qualities of Hounds of Love and Homogenic, When The Pawn... can be just exciting, thanks to Fiona's sheer talent. The majority of songs on When The Pawn... are more than stellar, and hearing Fiona's emotions in full fury only makes its impact even greater.

**Leixander**: A perfect, cohesive album by Miss Apple. New album when? IDLER WHEEL WAS RELEASED IN 2012!!

**Banananaise**: i mean... it's nice? it all kind of sounds the same. i know this album was a big hit in the US but i'm not sure i understand how this can be put on the same level/in the same group as Bjork and Kate Bush.

**nooodisaster**: (8.0 avg) wig i really tried to give this album as much time to grow on me as possible so hopefully these scores are fair but yeah this feels like the odd one out in this rate cant lie. the idler wheel is a masterpiece tho, you can tell Fiona improved her craft w each release.

**CopyCatJ**: A good album but not on the same tier as the other two.

**survivorjdmarina**: Even though I prefer The Idler Wheel... to this, I think that I'll get used to it over time. It's still a nice jazz-influenced album though.

**letsallpoo**: I didn't expect to like this album the most! Lots of solid bawps

**Lowest Scores:** (5 x2) maddieg18, MaximumFriendship

**Host Scores:** 

**Wailord: 9 // Eli: 11**

Eli: “Bachelorette”’s extravagant, tense, and intricate instrumental stress the lyrical themes that accompany it. Bjork embodies Isobel, the character that was seen on her first album, *Debut*, and again on its follow-up, *Post*. However, unlike its quirky, questioning predecessors, Isobel is assertive and confident. Her intentions are clear: she is here to personify the world itself and those who inhabit it. While her former storylines on “Human Behaviour” and “Isobel” found her growing up and experimenting, Bjork’s bombastic character seems to find an intrinsic power that belonged with her all along. 


--- 

**AbnormalPopPunk** (11): picking an 11 for this rate was hard. very hard. but i knew i was gonna give it to bjork. not because i stan her more than anyone else by miles, but because homogenic truly is the album, not only from the rate, but of all time, that's concept, production, and overall quality i hold above any other's. from an album of masterpieces, it was even harder to pick an 11 from there. but i decided to take an objective take above anything else, and the clear answer to that is nothing but "bachelorette". previously my favorite bjork song ever and currently in my top 5, everything about the track is beyond another level of phenomenal. first and foremost, the transition from "unravel" to it is breathtaking, especially considering how radically different the two are sonically. then, the suspenseful intro lets you know that shit's boutta go DOWN. and then. those vocals. kick in. bjork sounds the most confident and powerful she sounds on the album yet; in a way, it's both shocking and empowering to the listener. and not only are her vocals more assertive than ever, her lyrics parallel that. embodying the planet itself and its contents, bjork's words slip through the cracks of the intense instrumental with a certain femininity that would be otherwise unexpected. everything about "bachelorette" is absolutely perfect.

---

**blackvelvet** (11): Everything about this is perfect.

**stansymash** (11): More than any metal song, any rock song, any song in general; Bachelorette screams POWER. my god is this song powerful. The rumbling percussion, the huge strings, the electronic textures. and bjorks voice. these incredible lyrics are sold in one of the most powerful and incredible vocal performances you're ever gonna hear. It knocks me dead to this day. the force of this bloody song holy gumdrops it just has to be my 11.

**awryj** (10): I might have rediscovered Bjork back when I was 15 when I heard a sample of this in that one Clams Casino track... And thank God I did. This song invented killer whales, being trapped in a bay, and fountains of blood, however gorey it might sound.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): would be my 11 if we were rating anything else but Hounds of Love. It’s just dramatic in the best way.

**didney-worl** (10): THE MUSIC VIDEO THOUGH

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Holy shit the mood is really strong with this one. I love the sweeping strings and electro undertones. Great lyrics too.

**enecks** (10): best Bond theme right here. Outsold your faves.

**nooodisaster** (10): From "I'm a fountain of blood/In the shape of a girl" to "You're the intruders heart/I'm the branch that you break" has there ever been more epic lyrics than this? The production does NOT let that overshadow it tho, starting at 100 and not letting up with the violent drums and strings that just seem to drip blood red. The music video focuses on the sense of dread and endlessness, the anxiety of the song, but that's just one part of it. And then that 1+ minute of unintelligible screaming fade out?! Wig we stan for life.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): A lyrical masterpiece. I love that this is a sequel which improves on the already fantastic Isobel.

**ryanyu10** (10): Dark, mysterious, beautiful – almost my 11.

**stardustanddinos** (10): I love how dramatic this song is. The lyrics on this song are some of the most evocative I’ve EVER heard – in terms of their depth and imagery. And the baroque string arrangements are gorgeous. A great experience from beginning to end.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): the horror movie influence is used amazingly

**technoprayers** (10): - the bombastic production, the vocal performance, she did THAT

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Have you ever met songs that just sound cinematic? The first time I heard Bachelorette was in our car, on the way to a museum, and I remember my first immediate thought being 'Holy shit, wasn't this in a movie?' It wasn't, but the epic, swooping sounds of Bachelorette are fit for a horror film, no doubt heightened by Björk declaring that she's a fountain of blood in the shape of a girl. Funnily enough, this song is part of a series - not one made for the big screen, but it's the conclusion to a trilogy kicked off by Human Behaviour off Debut and followed by Isobel off Post. Though the songs' arc isn't as polished as the Ninth Wave, Björk has hinted that the main character of these three tracks is actually an alien stranded on Earth, with Bachelorette being her grand emergence. Such an interpretation lines up with the song's best qualities. Among all the diss tracks and the heavy metal boasting, Björk delivers lines so badass in Bachelorette that when you finish it, it's hard not to feel just a little scared of the grateful grapefruit lady who'll be wearing a swan dress five years after. She might sound like an Eldritch abomination after this, but, damn, is she an excellent one. If Joga wasn't a thing, this would hands-down be Homogenic's greatest musical output.

**notdallin** (9.2): A fascinating epic ballad, clandestine meetings between star-cross’d lovers with soaring, almost showtune-like strings? The verses easily outrank the less catchy chorus but that’s another reason why it’s so interesting. Also, “I'm a fountain of blood / In the shape of a girl” has to be up there in the pantheon of great opening lines, amirite?

**Host Scores:** 

**Wailord: 8.5// Eli: 10**

Eli: A beautiful interpolation of orchestral instrumentation and electronic production, “Joga” acts as somewhat of a thesis to *Homogenic*. Bjork’s vocals are stronger than ever, as the patriotic undertones act aptly as a representation of the icon’s unique lyrical and sonic themes. Ever since its release, the track has been critically acclaimed and called one of her best, and rightfully so.

--- 


**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): The song that got me into Bjork, I'm more than glad to give this an 11 for the second time. This song to me encapsulates the entire album, marrying the electronic and the organic to find something gorgeous in between. There's no doubt in my mind this is one of the best songs ever recorded.

**plastichaxan** (11): Choosing an eleven in a rate like this one is one of the hardest things I've ever done, ultimately I chose one song from each album and this is the one I connect the most to, even if the other two songs are not far behind I came to the conclusion this is probably what deserves my eleven right now and I will stand by it.

**technoprayers** (11): - one of the best ballads in the history of ballads

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): sober ii (melodrama) would not exist without this legendary jam

**awryj** (10): The Homogenic song. I don't even know what else to say about it. If you wanted to sum up Bjork in one song, this is the one.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): STATE OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOF EMEEEEERGENCYYYYYYYYYY

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): It’s a state of emergency that this song is underappreciated. Get it broadcast to every radio station right now

**enecks** (10): I'm sorry Joga but there was Jig of Life in this rate. My taste is in a STATE OF EMERGENCY

**MrSwearword** (10): a beautiful song that deserves nothing less than full fucking marks

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): [POP EMERGENCY]. A song that barely snuck its way into the Top 10 during our Charity Rate, finishing at a sore place of #9; obviously, people participating this time around are probably more accustomed to Björk's voice than other members, so odds are it's going to score much higher. Will it take the top spot, though? While I might be rooting for Kate Bush, I won't be all that surprised if Joga manages to snatch a surprise win. Pagan Poetry might be more popular amongst the general public, but Joga is Björk's most iconic song among critics and fans for a reason; there's no part of the song that doesn't radiate vulnerable, intensely emotional beauty, right from the moment where violins kick in down to Björk finishing off a display of her vocal power by belting words in Icelandic along with the final 'Emergency...'. Though she might sound like an alien from outer space most of the time thanks to her unusual artistry,  Joga is a gorgeous reminder of Björk's talent and vulnerability, and few songs like it have been made ever since its release.

**ryanyu10** (10): Absolutely stunning. Almost my 11.

**stansymash** (10): best singer of all time? best singer of all time.

**stardustanddinos** (10): This is poetry, both in terms of lyricism and the musical arrangements. Just shut your eyes and feel your mind soar over landscapes. No words, just listen to understand the beauty of this song. Stunning.

**survivorjdmarina** (10): beautiful, genre-bending and euphoric

**minibjork** (9.5): wouldn't mind suffocating in the landscape of this song

**nooodisaster** (8.7): Solid 8.7. I don't wanna shoot Bjork's chance of winning this rate in the foot, but I just don't get the acclaim for this one. It's good, great even (the PRODUCTION), all but one of Homogenic is. But on an album like THIS? It's extremely average. I guess I just never connected emotionally with the "state of emergency" refrain and her vocals; they seem counterintuitive and not in the interesting way. The verses are really beautiful tho, and of course the production is still fresher than half of what comes out today.

**notdallin** (8.7): this song makes me eMOOOOOOOOOtional!!!!

**tapdancingpig** (8): Perfectly off kilter and completely arresting.

**stardustanddinos**: This was the first Bjork album I listened and nothing could’ve prepared for me for how bizarre and innovative this album was. Her vocals are beautiful, and very unconventional – the vocal delivery is emotionally evocative. The production though, that’s where it is at – strings and orchestral punctuated with slick electronic beats, synths and a distinctly industrial aesthetic. This album was euphoric, with the music transporting to you to a world beyond, urging you to savour this life and the world around you. The highs on this album are INCREDIBLE, and while I don’t know what more to write, this album has certainly encouraged me to check out more of Bjork’s works.

**patronsaintofaspies**: It takes a great deal of magnificence for people not to associate Homogenic with the scary Japanese Mickey Mouse costume Björk wears on the cover, and that says a lot about the record itself, because its cover is terrifying. Jokes aside, though, I feel like you can't help but acknowledge how influential this album is, even if it's not to your tastes. I enjoy Post and Vespertine more, but with tracks like Joga, Bachlorette, and All Is Full Of Love, you can feel how iconic the entirety of Homogenic is by just giving it a listen; love it or hate it, in terms of cultural and musical influence, this is, without a doubt, Björk's magnum opus. And the reason why Homogenic is so beloved is because, for the first time in her career, it gives us a complete peek into Björk's mind - not in a handful songs, like Post did, but into her mental state did. It's evident how the infamous stalking we all know about affected the development of Homogenic, and the dark, moody vibe of the record's electronic atmosphere only sucks you into Björk'd feelings, and the entire work, as homogenous as it sounds, ends up buckling the listener into an emotional rollercoaster. I found it difficult to put down my feelings about most Homogenic, but, damn, if it isn't an album.

**Leixander**: I like this album less as time goes on, Joga and Alarm Call are the saving graces. u/kappyko Vespertine is better, deal with it!!

**Banananaise**: Bjork is another one of those artists i know through my mum's tastes in music, i heard certain songs of hers a lot when i was a kid (and i remember falling in love with the music video for I'm Oh So Quiet). so listening to an album of hers was really an experience! the singles (except Alarm Call) really jump out as a step above the rest.

**nooodisaster**: (9.1 avg) i SAID Bjork is one of the most consistently innovative experimental artists of the last 40 years and Homogenic is her most consistent album still sounding like the future of music over 20 years after it was released!

**Number3rdInTheVoting**: One of my favorite albums of all time. A gorgeous peak into the mind of Bjork, who manages to create an incredibly immersive experience through this cohesive masterpiece without making any of the tracks sound the same. The sheer sense of scale this record has is awe-inspiring.

**survivorjdmarina**: An absolute MASTERPIECE. Bjork truly shaped the way the general public perceived electronic music, and made one of the best and most experimental electronic albums of the last 25 years. The first four tracks are all perfection.

Wailord: A god-like, amazing song. This alone already broke records, but surprisingly, didn’t get pushed up to the top 2 spot until the very last ballot /u/theburningundead honestly did that, with their score last minute yesterday, this went up to number 2! This was my second option for an 11, I remember /u/kappyko told me to listen to this song on discord over a year ago, and I was blown away. I couldn’t believe that this fresh and new sounding song was almost 30 years old, and popheads loved it. Over a 9.7 average, I think this hits top 5 all time. 

--- 

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): To the surprise of absolutely no one, this was the easiest 11 I’ve ever given. This is my favorite song of all time, and the emotional journey it takes me on is just too good to resist. The driving strings, the regal drums, her gorgeous delivery. Everything about it is overwhelming in the best way. “I just know that something good is gonna happen / I don’t know when / but just saying it could even make it happen” is a lyric I have worked hard to internalize and take to heart in these uncertain times.

--- 


**awryj** (11): This song is one of my favorite songs ever. When I heard it for the first time, it made me feel things I didn't know I could still feel. Maybe it's because the subject of this song, a relationship between a son and his father, is just such a touching topic to me since I discovered this song right after I found out my dad was nearly terminally ill. Sob stories aside, the way this song seems to crescendo into a thunderstorm is just masterful. Kate took all the right ingredients and used them in a surprising, boundary-breaking way. Also, I encourage you to read up on Wilhelm Reich and his contraptions, it's a really fascinating man.

**Banananaise** (11): this song gives me goosebumps everytime... kate bush is such an incredible storyteller. anyway what if there was a ghostbusters spinoff called cloudbusters

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): To the surprise of absolutely no one, this was the easiest 11 I’ve ever given.

**minibjork** (11): this is the perfect song. it has passion/drama, familial love, a real historical context, STRINGS, and rain/sun imagery. what more could one ask for???

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): those STRINGS!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Love the groove the violins provide. The chant at the end sounds tribal, almost

**huntyphobic** (10): YEAH YEAH YEAyeeee YOOOOOOOOOoooo 🗣️🗣️🗣️ we’re cloudBUSTING DaDDY ☁️💦💦😳😛😫💦😛🤤🤤

**Leixander** (10): obligatory /u/cloudbustingmp3

**letsallpoo** (10): if /u/couldbustingmp3 didnt give this an 11 then this rate has no merit

**llieno94** (10): “I’m Cloudbusting, Daddy” is such a perfect lyric

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Cloudbusting shows a quality that's easy to ignore until your second, third, and fourth listens, and that quality happens to be Kate Bush's empathy. Though Kate is known for turning unique, captivating stories into catchy classics, it's in Cloudbusting, one of her most critically lauded singles, where she decides to tell a series of events from the point of view of a little boy in a very agonizing situation. Her chosen scenario, taken from the biography of an inventor's offspring, isn't even a run-of-the-mill holistic event you often hear the trauma of in bits of media; there's no setting torn by warn here, nor a divorce, but a kind of abandonment issued upon one's father being arrested by the government. You'd think this quite the difficult problem to imagine yourself experiencing in place of the man narrating it to you, but Kate Bush strikes a sea of emotions that hits the mark so perfectly, even Peter Reich, the individual she's singing from the perspective of, approved of Cloudbusting's brilliance. Such a narrative strength would typically be found in only the most talented of journalists, but Kate's not writing for Time here. She's making music. And the music she makes is an artistic peak that few humans, no matter their occupation, could ever hope to achieve. And try as poets might, there's no of a homonym in the English language as glorious and heartbreaking as her final declaration: 'The sun's coming out/your son's is coming out.' And so, with a finishing ray of light, the first side of Hounds of Love ends. Here comes the shipwreck; here comes the stranding.

**perfumevee** (10): I can't listen to this without picturing the video. It gets me every time.

**ryanyu10** (10): Grand, eclectic, beautiful. I’ve gone back between Running Up That Hill and this song so many times for my favourite song on this album so many times, and the pure quality of these songs are a clear indication why. Almost my 11 (as in I had a write-up for this as 11 but changed it).

**stansymash** (10): holy gumdrops

**survivorjdmarina** (10): the baroqueness snapped

**tapdancingpig** (10): Wow. That got really sad really fast.

**technoprayers** (10): - another classic from Queen of House Bush

**notdallin** (9.6): takes notes Lana! This is how you write a song that includes the words “daddy” and “yayo”!!!!!

**nooodisaster** (9): Wow, I did NOT realize what this song was about until I looked it up on Genius. Your fav could LITERALLY never.

**Wailord: 10 // Eli: 10** 

Wailord: This song did fucking that. Literally did everything. It was in the top 5 the entire time, Bjork switched around in the top spot once or twice, and Paper Bag actually was in first after about 16 ballots, but after the 20th, the trend was evident. The last 10-15 ballots were straight 10s/11s, and the average jumped almost .4 points in just over a week. It is insane, this means we were 2 points away from a perfect score. Had two people changed their 10 to an 11, this would have received a perfect score.

**/r/popheads FUCKING DELIVERED**

**stansymash** (10): kate bush can run up fucking buildings and yet theres still gonna be some people in this rate who don't care cause this song is old or whatever.

--- 

**letsallpoo** (11): scientifically proven to be the skinniest song in existence

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): Honestly, would I even be lying if I told you that if a greatest pop song of all time objectively existed, this would be it? Running Up That Hill pretty much gave birth to every other art pop song you've ever heard, and I don't think there any are opening synths more iconic than the low humming harkening after its first three silent seconds. The lyrics are a conceptual exercise in gender, featuring Kate Bush imagining the possibility of a man and a woman making the aforementioned deal to switch places for a brief period of time; presumably, these two people are cis, since we're all tired of iconic British artists growing into old bigoted women and ruining our youth. Funnily enough, this is one of Kate's least extraordinary ideas behind a song. Despite that, however, there's no attempt to cover up Kate's flair for the dramatic; you can evidently hear her turn the ham up in Running Up That Hill's bridge, where Kate shows that, yes, her voice's definitely grown deeper and more powerful ever since the shrill, ghostly clamouring of Wuthering Heights. There's no doubt that this song is popular because it's accessible art, like every song off the first side of Hounds of Love, but its easiness on unsuspecting ears makes it no less a display of the brilliance of Kate Bush; it's a wonderful, magical introduction to her musical experience, and it's one of the only five minute songs that fills up all of its space lushly and immaculately. Try not to be excited for Hounds of Love after this.

**Riddlemethis707** (11): it hurts not to give the 11 to Bjork

**rotating3Dtext** (11): okay, this is epic (lmao but, for real)

**ryanyu10** (11): I went back and forth on whether to make this, Paper Bag, Fast as You Can, Cloudbusting, Waking the Witch, Joga, or Hunter my 11 (which really speaks to how great this rate is). But, I ultimately settled on this, largely because of the unique sound and influence this song has had. Great lyrical content, awesome production, approachable yet not afraid to add in experimental elements. Passionate and epic, yet balancing a delicacy to it in its midst. Legitimately, this is one of my favourite songs of all time. What a way to open an album.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): The first time I heard this whiole rating it, the opening reminded me or a Carly Rae Jepsen song I cxould not remember. I listened to about half of E-MO-TION until I realized Making The Most of the Night sounded kind of like the very very start of this song. Anyways, all of that's pretty irrelevant. This is a very good song.

**survivorjdmarina** (11): what a MASTERPIECE

**AbnormalPopPunk** (10): i was absolutely entranced the first time i heard this song. everything is about is just breathtaking. that airy sound that starts the track, then those confident, assured drums. you can hear such a delicate combination of the vulnerability, sensuality, and aplomb in kate's voice. that chorus is literally insane and so powerful.

**Agusarg** (10): Probably the greatest pop song of the 80s.

**awryj** (10): https://clyp.it/fapwpssg

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): that atmospheric synth intro gives you a few seconds to glue down your wig one last time before the drums come in to kick it off anyway. It’s only fitting that the best album ever has the best opening track; moments like when she wails “there is thunder in our hearts” catch you off guard, and the drum break in the bridge is majestic.

**didney-worl** (10): One of the best songs of all time, period. I'm also convinced it influenced "Run Away with Me" and "Green Light".

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): This song is magical. I’m completely convinced that this one is relatable to every person on Earth in some way

**enecks** (10): UGH she did that. This is just so poetic and ambitious. And she's starting the album like this? Way to flex your iconic talent. Oh and those drums mmmm.

**feetarefriends** (10): I give this a 10 knowing it's probably going to win and I don't want it to, but I can't bring myself to sabotage it

**huntyphobic** (10): Easily the best album opener I’ve ever heard, I understand hyperbolic statements are thrown around a lot on this sub but the buildup and payoff of the song, without exaggeration, is truly legendary. imo Running Up That Hill and In The Air Tonight are unmatched when it comes to the atmosphere, buildup, and climax of each song.

**MrSwearword** (10): holy shit, this is an OPENER

**nooodisaster** (10): I was listening to this with Spotify's Genius lyric thing, and it put up Kate's quote that said "I was trying to say that, really, a man and a woman can't understand each other because we are a man and a woman." And that's when I knew I was in for an A L B U M.

**notdallin** (10): is it weird that I heard the placebo cover of this song more than a decade ago and didn’t realize it was a kate bush cover???

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Single handedly eradicated sexism

**perfumevee** (10): I love everything about this song.

**stansymash** (10): kate bush can run up fucking buildings and yet theres still gonna be some people in this rate who don't care cause this song is old or whatever.

**stardustanddinos** (10): We’ve heard of deals with the devil, but a deal with god? Empathy and understanding elevate a relationship, enabling partners to love each other more deeply – no wonder the deal is with god, the very personification of these qualities! The synths and vocal effects are gorgeous without being overbearing. A fitting, haunting opener!

**technoprayers** (10): - this is such an amazing track, the power she exudes...whew. This would have been my 11/10 if Bjork didn’t make Joga

**minibjork** (9.5): this is why kate bush is a pop god!! god, this woman's work.

deleted: # Kate Bush - Hounds of Love

---

**Overall average**: 8.808

---

**TragicKingdom1**: I think I liked this album the most of any in the rate on paper. It definitely had the most interesting production and melodies. However, I think at points it was either just too boring or weird for me. It did meet my expectations however. [Grade: B+]

**minibjork**: mandatory listening for teenage rookiemag readers everywhere. (8.7 personal average)

**stansymash**: kate bush is a british icon and even though this is technically my least favourite album in the rate, its still incredible and you yanks better show it respect

**stardustanddinos**: This is one of the most unconventional and beautiful albums I’ve ever heard in my life. The first half of the album tackles themes in love – empathy, fright of what lies next, understanding and more interestingly, the perspectives of a murderer’s mother and an obscure theorist’s son! The second half – The Ninth Wave – is where things become interesting. A woman is hanging on for dear life after a shipwreck, and hallucinations visit her – being convicted of being a witch, flying away from earth, her older and younger selves. The obscure samples like Gregorian chants and radio transmissions elevate the imagery of the album, and make you think deeply about mortality and love. Kate Bush has an unconventional voice and an impeccable ear for detail in production and harmonies – it shows throughout! This album is some of the most deeply affecting and gorgeous music I’ve ever heard. I know my ratings might not reflect that, but I am going by standalone replay value (as I do for all albums I rate). Combined these tracks form a perfect 10/10 album, boundless in creativity, and magically eccentric.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Hounds of Love sure is a huge contender for my favourite conceptual album of all time (sorry, Ziggy Stardust) and it might as very well be my favourite album by a woman. Kate's magnum opus is the great great grandma of modern art pop, and there's a bundle of radiant qualities in it that appeal to fans of every genre; whether you get drawn to Kate's songwriting, the beautiful, atmospheric instrumentals accompanying the entire record, or if you just love the experience of listening to something so weird and wonderful, then you've came in to the right place by giving Hounds of Love a moment of your curiosity. There are very few moments on this album that aren't a display of brilliant imagination and artistic ambition, and this is a musical work that breaks free of its original channel; Hounds of Love could be a music video, a movie, a play, a painting, a novel, or anything else you could imagine. Instead, it chooses to be an art pop record, and it's better than anything you could have ever dreamed of. Nothing can top the quality of giant successes such as Running Up That Hill or Cloudbusting, and it's incredibly hard to make tracks as unique as Waking or Witch or Jig of Life that share the clear-cut narrative Kate weaves into them, too. Hounds of Love is a special, beautiful album by one of the most special, beautiful musicians the human race has ever been blessed with, and its magic will never wither, get old or die. The sun's coming out...

**Banananaise**: despite having a long and loving relationship with a lot of Kate Bush songs, i don't think i've ever sat down and listened to one of her albums in full before! i had high expectations but she really surpassed anything i could have imagined, especially with the Ninth Wave. a real 20th century masterpiece

**nooodisaster**: (9.2 avg) I'm SO THANKFUL for this rate & its hosts for introducing me to this album!! Literally the 80s feels like such a flop decade, but this album has quickly become one of my top rated albums of all time.

**CopyCatJ**: Probably my favourite album of all time.

**survivorjdmarina**: I can see the appeal of this album, but it didn't stick with me the first time I heard it in full. Maybe if I went through another listen of this album, I would like it a bit more, but overall, it just seems to be there for me. The singles are all iconic masterpieces though.

**huntyphobic**: One of the best albums ever made, your faves could and will never.

**cloudbustingmp3**: This is quite honestly my favorite album of all time. Every little detail of it is just immaculate, and it truly provided such a wonderful template for her own future records (and just about every alt pop one to come out after too).
