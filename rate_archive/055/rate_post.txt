Respect Your Elders: OGs of Art Pop Rate

A dishwasher ran, making swooshing and swishing sounds. A running dryer holding a pair of sneakers, banging and clanging, blared nearby. Cows greeted the morning with moos. Cars drove by, driving over bumps and potholes, clattering and clacking.

##Then suddenly: you hear a voice. It is held to a young woman, with a strange accent that covers multiple cultures, with an elongated neck, strangely connected buns in her hair, several inch-long nails, and a kimono on. It is Bjork. Hearing the loud morning pandemonium, she says: “moosic?”.

##[Hello Earth](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0S0zNFzK_ns).                
Hello everyone, and welcome to the OGs of Art-Pop Rate! I’m your host, Eli, who you may know from around the sub, but most related to this rate, from being *the* Bjork stan of sub. I come to you with help from a few different people. First and foremost, my lovely co-host and score collector, u/wailordfan. Also a notable mention to u/whatareblackhole!

I am honored to host this rate, as three of my favorite artists are the subject of it. Without further ado, let’s introduce these icons:

The wonderfully lyrically witty and saucy [Fiona Apple](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iHOK1hjECRc/VjaPGYoxG0I/AAAAAAAADoI/uqDSk0nOdYU/s1600/most%2Bsignificant.gif)
The baroque-art-pop hitmaker who has stunned the music world with her fascinating production and words, [Kate Bush](https://66.media.tumblr.com/tumblr_ln1fnsOPVb1qkrirro1_500.gif)
And last but for *sure* not least, the Icelandic fairy who has touched every musical genre and idea one could think of and more, miss [Björk](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DnvAvdKV4AE11Tp.jpg:large)

Today, these three women are considered to have made some of the greatest musical works of contemporary music: Fiona’s poetic and piano-driven *When the Pawn…*, Kate Bush’s artsy and ethereal *Hounds of Love*, and Bjork’s genre-bending, electro-orchestral crossover, *Homogenic*. With almost every track on these three records being written solely by the artists themselves, the works of these three were all incredible feats for women in music. So let’s look into each, more in depth!:

##Kate Bush - Hounds of Love

*(writeup by u/cloudbustingmp3)*        
Kate Bush is an enigma. In the 40th year of her career, it is only fitting that we finally rate one of her works. One of the most esteemed and revered figures in music, her influence on the music industry is invaluable. From pioneering the use of headset microphones so she could dance and sing at the same time to paving the way for countless eclectic artists (including her ratemates), Bush has an incredible legacy. Widely regarded as her magnum opus, Hounds of Love finds her at top form; the perfect blend of commercial and experimental force, it remains one of the most beloved records ever released. From the iconic singles on the A side to the concept journey of the other, Hounds of Love remains both instantly impressive and challenging to fully appreciate.

Hounds of Love’s first half is a masterwork of artsy synthpop. The dramatic hum that opens Running Up That Hill is a beautiful omen that gives the listener time to prepare for a musical treat. The drums pound majestically, and the break midway through the bridge gives In the Air Tonight a run for its money. The title track is a frenzy of strings and beats, echoing the frightening idea of being helplessly in love. When Kate howls “oh here I go” with wild abandon, it draws you in completely; the listener easily taps into that frenetic energy. The first half closes with the grandiose Cloudbusting, and the majesty of the track makes it easy to see why it was chosen as the encore for her first shows in 35 years; it absolutely exudes this hopeful air of finality. While this first half is rightly known for its perfect singles, Bush knows to treat her album cuts with just as much care.

The second half is known as The Ninth Wave. Based on and named after a painting, The Ninth Wave is an uninhibited tale of a woman adrift at sea trying to get through the night after surviving a shipwreck. Just like the subject matter, it is an emotionally charged piece that tackles fear, fatigue, desperation, and hope. While the front half of the album isn’t exactly conventional, it’s here that she really lets loose. Sparse piano ballads meet chopped and screwed samples meet choirs meet syrupy synths, and the result is very raw and primal. This is something to listen to in the dark alone with headphones to really tap into that feeling of isolation.

While Hounds of Love represented a dazzling culmination of what she had done up to that point, it also gave us a glimpse of the places Kate was yet to take us. In the nearly 35 years since its release, Bush has released only 4 studio albums, each more focused and worldbuilding than the last. Each has echoes of what came before it and is excellent by its own merit, but there is a reason why her 2014 shows were so heavy on Hounds; it’s a master’s masterwork, and a record to truly cherish.

##[Bjork - Homogenic](https://i.imgur.com/DtNuyQX.png)

Hectic is an accurate way to describe the latter half of the 90s for Björk. After *Post* was released, she experienced her first taste of true international fame, with more anticipation to her follow-up than there had ever been prior. Experiencing obsessive fans, screaming crowds, incessant paparazzi, and that cash schmoney was something that can change one’s personality and perspective. While she didn’t lose herself, a simple listen of her works chronologically allows one to know that it was definitely a maturing process for Björk. 

After taking a complete 180° in the recording process, Björk’s most patriotic, experimental, and courageous work was born: *Homogenic*.       

A darker sound than she had had in the past, the record crossed a daring bridge between orchestral and electronic instrumentation. Taking influence from her home country of Iceland, the album does feel like volcanoes and geyser that swarm the land on tracks like “Pluto”, “5 Years”, and “All Neon Like”. More intimate, inventive instrumentals are found on both the opener and closer; Björk manages to make every song feel its own experience while creating a vivid journey throughout the record. From the orchestral-backed screams on “Bachelorette” that encompass power and assurance to the anthemic, awakening “Alarm Call”, Björk ensures that she is here to stay and to make herself known. 

Critics unanimously praised the album, and some consider it amongst the greatest of its decade and of all time, and rightfully so. *Homogenic* also was a fair commercial success, reaching top five in the UK and three of its four singles charting within the top 40.

##Fiona Apple - [When the Pawn Hits the Conflict He Thinks Like a King…](https://i.imgur.com/hXMK0nq.png)

*(writeup by u/cloudbustingmp3)*              
Fiona Apple is a woman on a mission: to let everyone know exactly what she’s feeling and how intensely she’s feeling it. On her previous record, Tidal, Apple took listeners on one of the most intense rollercoasters of visceral emotion ever set to music. After such a brazen debut, Apple faced a wave of criticism largely for being an unapologetically emotional woman. Like popheads’ faves who followed, the common reaction of “wow, so pretentious” was echoed by those who thought they were too cool to feel. Instead of giving in to the jeers, Apple doubled down on her Fionocity and gave her sophomore record a 90 word title: When the Pawn Hits the Conflicts He Thinks Like a King What He Knows Throws the Blows When He Goes to the Fight and He'll Win the Whole Thing 'fore He Enters the Ring There's No Body to Batter When Your Mind Is Your Might so When You Go Solo, You Hold Your Own Hand and Remember That Depth Is the Greatest of Heights and If You Know Where You Stand, Then You Know Where to Land and If You Fall It Won't Matter, Cuz You'll Know That You're Right. She was, of course, made fun of for it, but she ended up getting the first and last laugh; the title was meant to poke fun at those who called her pretentious and self-indulgent, and those rooting for her to fail musically would have to suffer to see her garner more Grammy nominations and sell nearly a million copies without a hit.

But what about the music itself? While When The Pawn… finds her in a similar sonic landscape, this is not Tidal 2.0; Apple somehow manages to be more cutting and primal than she already was. She spends more of her time spitting and growling her words out, and Ms. Apple has always had a way with words. From the album’s beginning, we see that her mission is a bit of a warpath. The first track, On the Bound, starts with a bold declaration: all my life is on me now/hail the pages turning/and the future’s on the bound/hell don’t know my fury. A flurry of discordant electronic blips come in near the end to highlight her frustration. Throughout the record, Apple hits hard and never shies away from a low blow when it’s deserved. On the single Limp, she hits back at an abusive lover, warning him that he’ll end up alone if he doesn’t treat her with an ounce of dignity. The imagery is vivid yet not explicit: it won’t be long till you’ll be lying limp in your own hands. Even the sonically tender moments are full of intensity. Love Ridden describes the deterioration of a relationship. She can see the end coming, and in the bridge just flat out gives up on keeping it alive. The Grammy nominated Paper Bag is a tricky song, but this works to its advantage. The instrumental presents it as a quirky little jazzy number, but the lyrics turn this little ditty into a tale of disappointment. It suits the song perfectly; “I thought it was a bird, but it was just a paper bag” ends up translating into the way the music and lyrics contrast beautifully. The climax comes in lead single Fast As You Can. An aggressive, off-kilter number, it stands as a mission statement of its own. A struggle for power, its sheer manic energy collapses in on itself in the most Fiona way during the slow, jazzy bridge. It’s a moment of clarity not just within the song, but the album as a whole.

From its record-breaking title to the musical minutiae, When The Pawn… is both predictably Fiona and completely disarming. A woman unafraid to feel and share every single moment, it’s a complete evisceration of both everyone who wronged her and herself in true Fiona fashion. Only 2 studio albums and nearly 20 years later, Fiona still manages to hit a nerve with each song, and it’s this unnerving openness and honesty that forges such a deep connection with listeners. We don’t know when she’ll share with us next, but with the intensity of her work it’s always worth the wait.

#I’m no fucking Buddhist, but these are the rules

- Listen to each song and assign each a score **between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two decimal spots. This means that giving a 7 is fine! Giving a 7.5 is fine! Giving a 7.55 is absolutely out of the question!

- You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total, not one song per album**. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results and is very annoying! 

- You have to listen to and rank each song!

- Your scores are not confidential!

- If we suspect you from intentionally giving certain songs or artists low scores for the sake of sabotage, I will not hesitate to tell you to clarify or change your scores!

- Your scores can be changed at any time! Just PM the corrections to /u/_wailordfan!

- If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Like this:

###THIS IS THE CORRECT FORMAT TO SUBMIT:
>Paper Bag: 11 Plastic bags could never.

###THESE ARE WRONG, LITERALLY ANY FORMAT THAT IS NOT LIKE ABOVE IS WRONG:
>Paper Bag: 11: Plastic bags could never.

>Paper Bag: 11 - Plastic bags could never.

>Paper Bag: Plastic bags could never, this gets my 11

>Paper Bag: eleven Plastic bags could never.

###You can also comments on the albums as a whole by adding a colon after the title:

>Album: When the Pawn...: Pawn > Queens anyday

###Don't do it like this or anything that's not like above

>Album: When the Pawn > Queens anyday
