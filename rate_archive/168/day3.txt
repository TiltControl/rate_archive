**apatel27** (8.5): Prince fully embraces the funk to deliver this fun number. It’s one of his most popular funk tracks and it’s easy to see why

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This is a very solid song of funk fundamentals. Very solidly the core of Prince's sound, but otherwise there isn’t much that makes it stand out (not that it’s bad!)

---

**babadork** (11): Picking an 11 for this rate was tough, so I went with the one that makes me want to shake my ass the most.

**nt96** (10): what my manager says when my shift starts

**oscarbrierley1** (10): constantly shifting to keep it interesting. has great energy. the extended version would probably get my eleven.

**qazz23** (10): everything about this is good - the vocals, funky bass, and synths

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): more real music for real fucking hot people

**phonethephoenix** (9.5): funky!!

**AHSWeeknd** (9): capitalism

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Tfw when the synth is SYNTHING.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): thot anthem

**DirtyRat583** (9): lets WERK ✨

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): finally, some good fucking food

**welcome2thejam** (9): Got Damn that's funky

**Frajer** (8.5): you betta work bitch

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): ooo that baseline is just so nasty

**Internal-End-9037** (8.5): Classic Prince funk.

**Awkward\_King** (8): forgiving the capitalist ideology bc of the slayage

**MassiveThief** (8): heavenly bass.

**Nagisoid** (8): Britney outsold with Work Bitch, I fear, but this works well too.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Something about this is not grabbing me like the prior songs. Still v. good though

**vayyiqra** (8): This bass rules. The instrumentation on this album is top-notch and we don't give Prince enough credit for how good he was at that.

**TiltControls** (7.5): the rihanna to bowie's gaga

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): im more of a quiet quitter

**CrimsonROSET** (7): troy bolton in the kitchen during high school musical 2 while not at all working there:

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): antiwork in shambles

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I’ll be getting up a petition to make mandatory that every employer around the country play this to their employees before starting the workday

**ImADudeDuh** (7): me when i’m a manager breaking work laws

**pig-serpent** (7): Impeccable groove. I've always wondered why funk artists sing in terrible falsettos but when Prince does it it's camp.

**Stryxen** (7): good yes the ending is so sudden.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): sorry, i’d rather dance

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pretty basic Prince (so above average of course)

**apatel27** (10): The last of the covers on Nightclubbing and it’s just so cool! From the delivery to the beat, every part of this just oozes charisma and the live performances? absolutely perfect

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This was written by String and The Police released a version of this song soon after Grace did hers. All I’m gonna say is that Grace’s was much better.

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): this may not be the biggest song ever but honestly this just really hits for me its got the perfect grace jones attitude and delivery and the groovy bass and electric guitar like! she eats

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Honestly Grace kind of outdid the original

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Demolition Dudes Rock.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): brooding menacing absolutely boppening like come on if this isnt top 5 im suing

**nt96** (10): unrelated to the song but watch the movie, it’s pretty good!

**qazz23** (10): the rock sound really works with this while still being dancey, good synths throughout

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): words of wisdom

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): it's another grace jones banger this time with some quarter note gtrs and big sound synths going commando lunge. and then u got dat GNARLY bbbbrrrreeeeeoooooooowwwwwwww gtr noise that actually sounds like someone took all the right lessons from post-punk and put it in pop music. art and commerce never met so splendidly as they did here.

**flava** (9.5): she certainly demolished James Bond’s bussy in a view to a kill

**Frajer** (9.5): she ate

**1998tweety** (9): what they'll call Sett after hes done with my hole

**cremeebrulee** (9): i hope this is the grace frontrunner

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the demolition man set off a yass bomb

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): Grace Jones predicted that one joke villain in avatar the last airbender??

**phonethephoenix** (8.8): love the funky little synths

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): never have i related more to a lyric than "i'm a walking disaster"

**impla77** (8.7): I like to think Grace Jones is singing from the perspective on the Second Law of Thermodynamics on this track.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why does this remind me of monster mash

**mysario** (8): confusingly, it's a song written by Sting (of The Police) that Grace Jones had on their album first only for The Police to put it on their album a few months later

**slimboyfriend** (8): Bob the Builder anti

**vayyiqra** (8): wasn't this that weird scifi movie with Stallone

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Grace Jones is gonna wreck your shit

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oozes cool

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): okay she finally decided to start slaying again

**CrimsonROSET** (7): for some reason ‘i’m the sort of thing that they ban’ hits differently in the current state of things!

**Internal-End-9037** (7): By the album Nightclubbing Grace knew how to take a song and flip it in a totally new (and often sexual) way. But the tone shift to rock sticks out from the better tracks. But as a fan huge of The Police, this is a cover version done right.

**Nagisoid** (6): Wow, I didn't know she was a TF2 player!

**moonshxne** (5.7): Might work with a power vocalist who wouldn't get lost in the mix,,,but I'm not even sure of that tbh. Production is fun tho

**IIIHenryIII** (4): that Jake Gyllenhaal movie is all I could think of while listening to this: https://m.media-amazon.com/images/M/MV5BMTg4Nzg1MTYxMl5BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjUxNDMyODE@._V1_.jpg

**apatel27** (8): This goes off from the very start and never lets up. The funk just keeps coming and Prince’s fun delivery keeps this song going but the spoken word section does bring the song down slightly.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): This feels like a classic Prince song. Nice driving funky beat, fierce sexual lyrics. The one thing that might hold it back is the weird, somewhat shoehorned political bridge.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): no one did it like Prince. PERIOD.

**Awkward\_King** (10): okay king...

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Me being ace and giving this a 10 is camp.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): HALF OF THE STAFF OF THEIR BRAIN IS ON VACATION!

**Nagisoid** (10): Perfect breeder anthem, sadly I cannot relate.

**nt96** (10): oh yes

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Oh god, this fckning instrumental has me out of my MIND

**Stryxen** (10): popheads will give sexuality a 10 and then be confused about their own :sob: :sob: :sob: :sob: :sob: :sob:

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): “half of the staff of their brain is on vacation” bars

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): hot music for hot people. do you hear any problems here? no they're aren't. it's so sad brainiac never covered something like this because Tim Taylor def took cues from this sound

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): well it wasn't a 6.9 but i had to incorporate the number

**oscarbrierley1** (9): speed core bop

**qazz23** (9): Aaaaoowaah! The synth in this is s e x y

**vayyiqra** (9): Wild how he's so right about everything here and how this is still relevant and that's also rather dismaying!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I’m bopping

**Frajer** (8.5): awoo

**impla77** (8.1): I feel like I’m not really getting the thesis statement.. but it’s still a vibe

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is what i wanted the b-52s to be

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is definitely not the lyrical content I was expecting and I’m all here for it

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): “half of the staff of their brain is on vacation” is such a funny drag

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): the lyrics fuck and the second half is super cool but I am more middle of the ground on the first half musically

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): wtf is he doing with his voice

**Internal-End-9037** (7): Fun, upbeat sound like something that laid the template for many songs on the Beverly Hills Cop Soundtrack. With that song title I wanted more sensuality though.

**moonshxne** (7): FINE, Prince's shrieks (?) / moans (?) admittedly are an effective way to get the song going and going and going off in tangents!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I'm yassing

**welcome2thejam** (7): Spoken word interlude done right

**shipperondeck** (6): one day this will click for me and i'll regret scoring it like this

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): What is this Electric Company skit from hell?

**apatel27** (9): Originally I though this would be a front runner but the length really put some people off. It’s a classic and you can see why. It’s a solid danceable tune with the instrumental solos working amazingly. Is it long? sure but each section of the song gets it’s own solo so why would you hate it?

**static\_int\_husp** (0): ok yes I gave this a zero but let me explain. Specifically, the way Bowie says “Let’s Sway” sounds very similar to a name I no longer go by. This also, for some reason, played a lot when I worked in retail. Those two things together made me jumpy when I heard it before I changed my name, and now it’s honestly more annoying than anything.

---

**celladonn** (11): absolute slay

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): if anyone complains about the runtime we're fighting like every moment is so essential... so iconic... it's honestly my favorite bowie song ever (and possibly also my fave Nile Rodgers production) like idk everyone was firing on all cylinders here. this was on the target playlist while i worked there and im still not sick of it, that's how powerful this is

**cremeebrulee** (11): the way i heard this song at a desi wedding once… we will never escape the british i fear

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): up until about the age of 18, I believed that Sistar sampled this for their song “I Like That”. They did not! Anyway, this song sounds best when you’re playing it on a car radio

**nt96** (11): a literal classic in every step of the way

**QuaxlyDuck** (11): i really like the representation of some of Australia's First Nations peoples in the music video clip

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): david bowie walked so lady gaga could run

**Awkward\_King** (10): i just can not hate this song in the slightest its actually the greatest song ever made its so joyous and spunky and celebratory and just wonderful

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): “Let’s dance!” Oh man oh god oh I don’t know “Let’s sway!” Okay that I can do!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is kind of undeniable

**ImADudeDuh** (10): bitch who wants to do gravity defying moves with me?

**qazz23** (10): it's really catchy and the vocal delivery is amazing, especially on "the SERIOUS moonlight"; also like all the those guitar and horn bursts

**shipperondeck** (10): eternal bop nile rodgers bless u

**vayyiqra** (10): Have another very specific childhood memory of hearing this and other Bowie "plastic soul" cuts like "Fame" as a kid in the 90s on the radio, in shopping malls, etc. and these fill the same niche in my mind that city pop does for weebs. (Disclaimer: I also like city pop and weebs can be valid.) You know, that odd feeling of nostalgia for an era you weren't even there for? It's dated, it's cheesy, but I love it anyway. I think this track's length might hurt it and keep it from winning, but it is an all-timer for sure. Another anecdote: one of my radio programmes I did in university was on 70s and 80s new wave and I used this song as the theme music.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): If you've never screamed "FLAAAAOOOOOWUUUUGGGHH" at the top of your lungs at least once have you really lived

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): Why did he sandwich that garbage in between two bangers? Just for freakin' Iggy Pop?

**Frajer** (9): the Twist and Shout intro gets me every time

**ignitethephoenix** (9): bop!

**Nagisoid** (9): Yes Bowie, but are you going to dance dance dance, with your hands hands hands above your head?

**phonethephoenix** (9): I think the tempo in this song is interesting. it's slower than I would expect I guess? great instrumentation. love the runs near the end. I don't know why I don't listen to this version more often

**pig-serpent** (9): It took a decade for this song to grow on me, but there's a suave classiness about it that I just couldn't appreciate as a child, even if I have always though the hook that breaks down this venere is the best part of the song by far.

**slimboyfriend** (9): I for one am not dancing unless the moonlight is serious enough

**Stryxen** (9): no i will sit here completely still and rate with a blank expression like a good rater should

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): finally some dancing

**welcome2thejam** (9): If this is Bowie selling out, then I'm buying in!

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): the duality of the human condition: let’s dance X let’s work

**impla77** (8.4): This is iconic but also very long😭

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): the way i kinda only really know the intro to this song

**Around-town** (8): Great

**moonshxne** (8): the textbook definition of a crowd-pleasing hit

**mysario** (8): the single version of this song is an 11 but the full album version clocking in at almost twice the time kind of slogs a bit

**oscarbrierley1** (8): long but changes up enough to stay interesting.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): the Muppets would crush this

**Internal-End-9037** (7): Yeah I get it. It was a HUGE hit. But it’s always felt merely like a hit with nothing much else to it. Though the line, “Under the moonlight, this serious moonlight” is one of the greatest of all 80s lyrics. The full seven minutes helps elevate it from overplayed as it’s gets a tinge psychedelic in the second half.

**TiltControls** (6): it's not a bad track, but it is a bit of a nothing one

**CrimsonROSET** (5): everyone’s dancing crazy- THIS SONG IS SEVEN MINUTES?!

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (4.2): OH I think I figured out where my gripe is with this cut! It's the unearned length. Look, the cut works brilliantly in the right context and there's an electric energy in there if you let yourself go for it. In all honesty, it can be quite a fast 7 and a half minutes in that regard. However, it also sounds like there's a 3ish minute single in here and then a LONG dub-type beat outro. dude...just make a 7 minute version that goes batshit hard and THEN do the trumpet dub dipshit banger for your b-side; don't combine them into one song!!!! Soft Cell did this (and it's why the tainted love 12" or cd maxi is essential). anyways Let's Dance with its cool throwback intro starts at an 11 and loses one point for each minute. im doing the straighest stephen colbert pelvic thrust dance to this. does not work for me.

**AHSWeeknd** (0): it’s not nostalgic if every white movie/show/commercial overplays it

**flava** (0): i think this or the cover of life on mars from AHS: Freak Show was my introduction to David Bowie’s music. And while I can’t remember which, I’m going to go with the cover since this song is awful. Let’s Dance is just so forceful with its grooves and swing that I don’t want to dance to it, i want to it turn it off and put on something with actual command over my body on, the opposite of modern love in every aspect for that

**apatel27** (9): Setting the tone for the album perfectly. One of the many covers on this album, the original song is completely reinvented as is always the case for Grace Jones. At one point this was top 5 which just goes to show how good it is that a spoken word opener can be considered one of the best songs in the rate.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Honestly I love the lyrics in this “feeling like a woman / looking like a man” is such a mood sometimes. Also as I was doing things for writeups, I found out this was a cover. It’s is much much much better than the song it is covering

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): sounding like a no-no always sends me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Not the catchiest or most boppin’ song in the rate but it’s just SO cool.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): her just describing things is camp

**impla77** (10): I really love the enunciation on this track, feels like every line packs a punch.

**qazz23** (10): solid opener, like the talk-singing and dub atmosphere

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): for some reason all i think of when i hear this song is the soup runway from RPDR All Stars 3, and how i wish i was the special guest so i could quip "feeling like a woman... looking like a can".

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool (Binaural-ly)

**shipperondeck** (10): yes

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): LOOKING LIKE A WOMAN 👁👄👁💅 FEELING LIKE A MAN👨‍💼👨‍💼👨‍💼

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): she was so real for this cut. u ever walked in the rain during a big 'ol storm? do you identify with roger smith of the anime The Big O when he says "some of us like to walk in the rain with an umbrella?" do u ever feel like a woman but sound like man? do u ever sound no no? do you ever want chris blackwell of island records to handle the production on yr cut so it can feel like dub but have an immense pop bent? right on the bat, the entire "thing" that nightthumbing is gonna be is settled and enshrined in stone. triumphant shit that i'll reload all my stick guns to until the end of time.

**nt96** (9.5): she perfected that rainy night vibe.

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): idk how to explain it but this is like her manifesto

**TiltControls** (9.5): part of the trifecta of songs to sing while getting soaked outside along with Come Clean and Unwritten

**moonshxne** (9.1): Catwalking in a rainy nighttime film noir 💅. Kicking off fabulously with those drums, the insistently pattering beat and intricate sprinkle of instrumentals really nails that moody atmosphere that I often craved from the other tracks. Even so, I honestly wish this amped up the atmosphere even more — perhaps with some subtle layering of Grace Jones's voice so that it's bit more echoey?

**MassiveThief** (9): slayed

**Nagisoid** (9): What's with the women in this rate starting their albums with a song about rain? do they need an umbrella?

**oscarbrierley1** (9): love the dark sounding vibe. it sounds like the intro to a movie.

**phonethephoenix** (9): very mysterious and cool

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): for when you can't sing in the rain

**vayyiqra** (9): What a vibe, I too enjoy walking in the rain.

**Frajer** (8.5): her and Patti Smith are the only people who can get me to listen to poetry

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): this is so iconic because she’s kinda giving nothing but also it’s giving everything

**ImADudeDuh** (8): 🎶 dancing, walking, rearranging furniture 🎶

**pig-serpent** (8): It's a vibe song but it's going out of its way to make sure there's always something new to listen to. I also appreciate starting an album about Nightclubbing with a song about walking to the club.

**plastichaxan** (8): She made a song inspired by that one time I did this to meet a hookup from that cursed gay app omfg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this is basically just a talking heads song so of course i love it

**DaHumanTorch** (7.8): this is how i found out trip the light fantastic is an actual phrase and not something sophie ellis-bextor came up with

**1998tweety** (7.5): thats a vibe

**seanderlust** (7.5): obsessed with her deadpan delivery here

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): “sounding like a no no” omg she described my gender

**ignitethephoenix** (7): me when I forget my umbrella

**IIIHenryIII** (7): if you don’t want to sing, don’t talk

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i kinda love doing this anyone else?

**welcome2thejam** (7): Eurythmics could learn a thing from this about seeing rain positively

**Awkward\_King** (6): grace jones voice is so fucking iconic like i could listen to her just talk over music for hours

**CrimsonROSET** (6): goddamn that motherfucker… wet?

**apatel27** (10): Some people thought his would be controversial but honestly it was far from it. His most consistent song in the rate, it stayed in the top 10 for the majority of the rate even rising to #3 at one point. It didn’t even get a score below 5 which says a lot. It’s a horny synth infused rockabilly song which shouldn’t work but it’s Prince so of course it’s an instant classic.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is camp. Pure camp. Like, theoretically, he’s singing to a woman but this is one of the gayest fucking songs Prince ever made, which is saying something. I truly cannot bring myself to hate this.

---

**akanewasright** (11): I just thought it was the best song ever made

**indie\_fan\_** (11): how many jack antonoff references will this get

**Roxieloxie** (11): I remember /u/indie_fan_ was going hard for it and based on the title i thought it was super campy and gonna be bad but no its so good. This song goes so Hard its easily my favorite discovery from the rate its everything i love abour prince wrapped up in a little song

**seanderlust** (11): i didn't realize robyn was covering something when she covered this! i also didn't know the history with the queer community. yeah this slaps

**AHSWeeknd** (10): facts are that only Prince could make the word “masturbator” sound good

**Awkward\_King** (10): well if you insist

**MassiveThief** (10): yassified Footloose. Absolute ass shaking bop.

**nt96** (10): yassss

**pig-serpent** (10): I was expecting some sort of reverse innuendo like "Big Balls" but nope, Prince is just offering to masturbate me.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): instant heart attacks don’t seem like an ideal outcome

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): Wall E and Eve LOVE this ditty. It's got big hawnk hawnk beep beep flying funk carboat spaceship lazer vibes that albums should shoot for! AND this prince guy is making INSANE promises that today's pop stars are too afraid to do :o They'll work with Jack Antonoff but they won't make a cut like this!!!!! CLICK HERE TO HERE WHAT TODAY'S POPTARTS DONT WANT U 2 HERE!!!

**mysario** (9.5): 😳

**shipperondeck** (9.3): my aunt went to a prince concert when she was young and was apparently appalled by prince's behavior during the concert and i was like. clearly you did not know about jack u off

**celladonn** (9): we love a horny bop

**Frajer** (9): my most popheads coded thing was discovering this song after Robyn covered it as a bside

**Nagisoid** (9): I just know he would favorite the Jackoff rate.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): i promise this isnt meant to be an insult even though it really sounds like one but this sounds like a ninja sex party song

**welcome2thejam** (9): They banned me from the sockhop for spinning this

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): Again: scary song title that isn't AS bad as I thought it would be. Fun enough

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): this is camp

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Always good to end on a strong note.

**DirtyRat583** (8.4): camp

**1998tweety** (8): me telling Sett what I can do to him

**CrimsonROSET** (8): :flushed:

**Internal-End-9037** (8): The original “Delirious” but far less goofy. Seriously, listen to them back to back. Lastly, I will say I have a piano cover version of this song done by Robyn, that is all.

**phonethephoenix** (8): iconic

**slimboyfriend** (8): it’s ok his eyes were closed so it’s not gay

**TiltControls** (8): there are any number of directions you can take for this shitpost. hosts I am looking forward to this

**vayyiqra** (8): isn't that the producer guy who looks like 🤓

**qazz23** (7.5): the vocals and synths just explode here

**impla77** (7.2): Surprisingly, this isn’t even in the top half of most sexual songs on this album

**cremeebrulee** (7): oh he is CRIMINALLY horny

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i think the crowd overhyped this one for me

**Stryxen** (7): fun and cute

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): this is just how guys on grindr start conversations

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Prince, respectfully, why would I want to get freaky to this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I was hoping I would like this more with how people were hyping it up but yeah it’s just okay for me. Like it’s catchy but just not super engaging to me musically.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): no thanks I prefer Jack Anton Off

**apatel27** (10): There’s something really special about this track, from the use of Libertango to Grace Jones’ flow, everything about this just works perfectly. It’s mysterious music with international influences from Jamaica, France, Italy to name the major ones.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This is honestly such a weird amalgamation of different songs. It takes parts from an Argentine tango song, part is spoken in French, and part is an original reggae arrangement. Overall it works, and it feels unique, but I’m not sure if it’s exactly what I would expect.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (11): Je eugh

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is such a masterful flip of the original source material like... this is ART

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): j’ai EUGH! baguette!

**impla77** (10): I can imagine a very slay Argentine Tango done to this track

**Internal-End-9037** (10): After Nightclubbing the album’s best track.

**Nagisoid** (10): This will be robbed but it's such a perfect song. The cryptic yet eerie lyrics coupled with Grace's enigmatic delivery work really well. The instrumentation adds to this atmosphere too and I find it such an amazing song that takes you into its own world.

**nt96** (10): Bonjour mademoiselle, je porte des lunettes de soleil. Je veux me venger, merci beaucoup. Je 𝒉𝒖𝒓𝒍𝒆. Oui oui baguette. Bisous!

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool (French-ly)

**Stryxen** (10): how nefarious and darkly whimsical

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the only time french has ever slayed (okay papaoutai was a smasha too)

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): that's what we call "modernist sounds of centripetal spaces" in action! THIS is noir, and not some cheap jazzy shlocky up bullshit; a real novel synthpop dub-laden narcotic fantasy that's cunning enough to suck you in and crap you out silly stupid. you ever driven deep in a late fall fog and listened to the mad professor? that's the vibe and it's stone cold set. it's just electrical n' slinky here.

**Frajer** (9.5): this feels like a song from Moulin Rouge in the best way possible

**qazz23** (9.5): a good dark synth sound here, like the accordion and French lyrics

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The cashier at Walgreens when I stop there twice in one day to buy candy.

**celladonn** (9): very evocative! love the sound of this one

**moonshxne** (9): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/948/324/abc.png

**slimboyfriend** (9): Art! Art! Art! Art! Art! Art!

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is cinema

**CrimsonROSET** (8): tango is from argentina why is she speaking french

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I don’t get the French, no one told her the tango is from Argentina???

**phonethephoenix** (8): oui!

**vayyiqra** (8): Was the 80s just full of pop songs with lyrics about stalking or is this a "weird that it's happened twice" kind of thing .

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Spooky

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh the word tango is literally in the title. Well hell, I don't have any comment ideas now

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the way she did a tango song and spoke French, her mind

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): when you dance in a library

**pig-serpent** (7): The part of a family adventure movie where the heroes are in a foreign bar and a woman is singing a mildly spooky song on stage as the bad guys start to creep up on the heroes.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): could have been an interlude

**apatel27** (9): Ironically not very controversial in the rate this 7 minute masterpiece slowly rose to the top 5 finally finishing at #4. It’s a 7 minute tour of Prince’s sound at the time and boy does it slap. It takes a certain level of gall to include the lord's prayer in the song but damn it’s so good.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I have to say, it’s really weird that the title track sounds so different from much of the rest of this album. I feel like the rest of the songs here are a lot faster or more complex. Whereas this is (relatively) slow and serious.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Prince could do Reputation but Taylor couldn’t do Controversy

**akanewasright** (10): perfect opener, could be 7 more minutes and I’d still be into it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I may not have attended mass of my own volition in 10+ years, but I can still sing(?) along to that Lord’s Prayer bridge, damnit!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): now this is a TITLE TRACK! this is how you set an intention! a mood! a groove! a prayer!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): religion trauma bitches make some noise!!

**Frajer** (10): see Taylor this is how you make fun of yourself before others can

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this has a genuine shot to win the rate so i’m gonna be pretty mad if it loses and the lowest comments are “why is this so long when nothing happens”? Bitch it was the 80s, they wanted to make music that had enough time and gaps so the DJs can snort cocaine before needing to change the vinyls

**Nagisoid** (10): This song is kinda perfect in every way. It's so funky, catchy and straight up fun. The bridge reciting the Lords' Prayer is extremely camp and possibly one of the first examples of such thing in popular music, like I just know Gaga wrote that down.

**qazz23** (10): incredibly funky guitar and bass, this shouldn't have a high "controversy"

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Boogien' in my chair rn for 7 straight minutes

**Stryxen** (10): when this is the least controversial song in the rate because everyone gives it an 11 YASS

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I want this to have the lowest Controversy score it would be iconic

**vayyiqra** (10): 🎸

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I let out the biggest “OHHHH” when I listened to this and realized that I did indeed know this song from long long ago. It’s amazing, but not the best Prince song (which still means it’s a very humble 10). I would probably have 11’d this if it wasn’t for the very strange Lord’s Prayer reading in the middle

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): the vocoder stuff here is intense; the bad warbly tape vibe transcends to a laptop gloss over for final comments. like christ the sound is sinister yet confident. im imagining the very evil trump ymca dance to this. im also imagining scoring an epic multikill quickscope in mw2. im also imaging the phrase "controbussy". for all of these reasons, I've decided that today, prince can have a 10. this is real music for real people.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): ironically i can't imagine this song having that high of one

**TiltControls** (9.5): Hopefully none for this song, this is amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (9): ate … no one can do it like him

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I just shook my ass to The Lord’s Prayer… am I going to hell?

**MassiveThief** (9): such a fun song. the little "contoversy" high pitched chanting scratches my brain in just the right way

**phonethephoenix** (9): love the guitar and also our father interlude??? okay let's go

**pig-serpent** (9): I love how on my first listen I though it was too repetitive and static but on repeat listens I vibe with it a lot more. At this point its just the "I wish there was no black or white" part that isn't clicking.

**slimboyfriend** (9): to quote ariana grande, “I like women and men”

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the only thing controversial about this is that this one song is better than the entire eurythmics album

**welcome2thejam** (9): A lil corny in spots, but the beat's got the punchiness I want and enjoy and just aren't getting from a lot of songs in this rate.

**moonshxne** (8): thought i accidentally activated Apple Music's karaoke mode

**mysario** (8): con tro verse see

**oscarbrierley1** (8): disco bop, long but i don't mind.

**shipperondeck** (7.9): why am i underrating this

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): spoken word section towards the end saves it

**impla77** (6.5): I wish I could rank this higher but man.. these songs are doing nothing to justify their runtime

**Awkward\_King** (6): prince makes such good gay sex music. its great to fuck to and then when you get random rushes of internalised homophobia and sorrow he accounts for that too!!

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): this would just be boring if it wasn’t for the vocals. They’re so pitchy, and what for????

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): I've been a long song defender but for the love

**Overall Average**: 7.904 **// Average Controversy:** 1.975

apatel27: There was some discussion prior to the rate about how this album might be divisive but it ended up being the highest average with a fairly low controversy score all things considered. Only Annie Christian and Prince’s orgasms ended up being controversial with the rest being agreed on as being good-great songs. (shoutout indie\_fan for helping out with the initial write-up. Do Confessional R&B!)

**indie\_fan\_** (10.025): listen... i tried not to be biased here, but i can't. ik sign o the times x purple rain x 1999 are often considered the holy trinity of prince album, but controversy definitely holds its own IMO.

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10.000): crucial document of the minneapolis sound BEFORE it blew up bigly. look, if yr gonna catch flak for opening for the Rolling Stones and dancing in in thigh high stocking and bikini briefs, you might as well go BACK to the studio, crank out a 10/10 no-chaff, lean as FUCK slab of 8 synthpop dities that prove A) you're the best anyone'll ever be and B) you actually want to be a pop star badly enough you'll never stop popping; THAT'S ROCK music, that's something beyond resonant. Controversy as a result, is able to evade mere "liminal pop classic" status and just begets straight masterpiece status; this is prince making an honest "even if im not it now I will be your pop star" mogul move that suggests every avenue to come. he'd come out of the hypercompetitive, but flourishing minneapolis scene where everyone played on everyone's recordings and tried to get the best gear or reserve the studio time needed to cast their fate. Prince was there at every turn doing his damndest to make it first and foremost. And here with Controversy, he was ascending over anything anyone could get to. there isn't a moment wasted, no dipshit nonsense, nor misplaced chorus or funk rhythm; he'd make better albums no doubt, but the entire package is pretty much intact and approachable more than given credit. the prince album we should be handing kids and saying "it's 37 minutes no biggie". because those who'll get it realize how powerful those 37 minutes can be.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10.000): I did not walk into this rate expecting to give Prince a perfect average but I truly have no notes. Strange and beautiful pop-funk odyssey

**AHSWeeknd** (9.625): Prince was always so straightforward about everything, I love it.

**nt96** (9.563): It’s crazy how some of well some of this stuff has aged, for better or worse. There isn’t much I can say about Prince that already hasn’t been said before, nevertheless I’ll say it for the millionth time: legendary and never forgotten.

**Roxieloxie** (9.063): I'd figure I'd like the prince album but I didnt expect to enjoy it so much! Very interesting combo all around that feels like it shouldnt work at all but it does!

**sarcasticsobs** (9.000): This Prince guy? Pretty good, amiright? Prettay, prettay, prettay good

**mysario** (8.525): Prince had such a fantastic musical mind with songs that sometimes over stayed their welcome but they're so good so can't be too mad

**Frajer** (8.500): Early Prince was so raw and horny it rules

**qazz23** (8.438): really solid synth funk, enjoyed most of the tracks; some really high points like the title track and "Let's Work", even the goofier stuff like Ronnie and Jack U Off have their moments

**phonethephoenix** (8.375): this is a great album!

**Nagisoid** (8.375): My favorite album in this rate by a decent margin. There are no weak spots here - every song is a banger that begs for you to dance to its tune. The political and social commentary is very well done because Prince masks it in a comedic tone so that it doesn't become overbearing. While I think Prince has much better projects this is still pretty good, and there are a ton of highlights here. I love the production and how each song flows into each other seamlessly, just a very euphoric experience.

**welcome2thejam** (8.375): This feels like a breath of fresh air. Just infectious and lively, great album even if it can't be played on the aux

**vayyiqra** (8.250): I don't listen to this guy enough, a true legend, the original "and why he ourple 😂". I don't hear much talk about this album these days but it's pretty good and also very to-the-point, given Prince albums are often super long.

**shipperondeck** (8.212): this clicked for me a lot better after the first listen

**Internal-End-9037** (8.063): This is the album that seals the deal on the Prince template while also being his new romantic/new wave period. All his classic hallmark sounds and vocal inflections are here. Also you here the sounds of much of what came after in the 80s from others artists trying to cop his groove. And he even has a few spots where he gets more experimental with new romantic sounds. In terms of androgyny it reads (mostly) very hetero to me.

**cremeebrulee** (7.787): love a good rate discovery

**moonshxne** (7.338): Considering how bold and controversial this clearly was, I actually don't have too strong of an opinion on this one. One questionable interlude aside, I generally found it nothing groundbreaking, but pleasant and enjoyable...and that's it, LOL. Well, "Annie Christian" is very much an exception that sticks out like a sore thumb on the record (complimentary), and honestly, maybe artists should switch up their otherwise cohesive albums with a jumpscare like that.

**DirtyRat583** (7.287): if disco demolition night never happened this would probably be a 10/10

**impla77** (7.238): Not my favourite, the long song phobia has really done a number on me for this one.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.188): This album has 2 modes: horny jail & charged for war crimes

**oscarbrierley1** (7.125): kind of sets up the sound he was going to be doing for the rest of the 80s, probably the most consistent album in the rate for me. need a remaster on spotify because the lower quality/volume was really noticeable and jarring.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.125): Of course Prince would make this wild-ass album. There are plenty of great moments, and plenty of moments that made me go "wtf Prince??" But that's probably the reaction he was going for

**MassiveThief** (6.875): I struggle to get into Prince and this album isn't an exception, I love a few songs but the album as a whole is just pretty good.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.500): A good album finally. I’ve never heard a Prince song up until this point, and I have to say that now I see what all the fuss is about. He’s really good, but I think it’s gonna take some time for me to get into his sound. While most of the songs here are good, none left their mark on me, except maybe for the title track and the moaning song.

**frogaranaman** (6.375): the Annie Christian title 💀

**apatel27** (10): It’s the classic. To me this song is better than Sweet Dreams, though many disagree. It was the front runner for the album but remained a step away from winning the entire rate. But hey it helped Eurythmics make top 3 so that's a win!

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Gosh I love the strings on this. The chorus is also just very beautiful and moving.

---

**Stryxen** (11): amazing perfect song, no notes. Love all the musics in this one and even some of the silences

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): There are great songs, and there are songs that take you on a musical journey. The epic strings, the futuristic synths, Annie Lennox's beautifully emotive voice… Everything in this song works perfectly to build that world of desire and regret and melancholy… Every album in this rate has a legitimate 11 contender to me, this just barely edges out the competition. It's a work of art.

**1998tweety** (10): im ascending

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Tore into my emotions. Absolute perfection.

**babadork** (10): I swear there was one bit of the chorus that I really liked for most of my time ranking songs that made me want to give it my 11, but then it was time to write my comments and I kept relistening to it and couldn’t remember what it was.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): My average will tell you that this is my least favorite album in the rate, but yeah rest assured I do LOVE their frontrunner and will be supporting.

**celladonn** (10): so baby talk to me!!!!!!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): the strings really give this a layer that the rest of the album lacks and makes it feel more... texturally complete imo. such a classic song that i almost feel like its a mistake having it up front because it's so hard to live up to even though the rest of the album is also good

**cremeebrulee** (10): bop!

**flava** (10): sweet dreams is cool and all, but this is the Eurythmics track for me. Its sombre atmosphere, the main keyboard melody. It’s haunted and beautiful. Every little synth detail just fits so perfectly so create something gothic horror in its sense. Also just sounds wonderful.

**Internal-End-9037** (10): In full disclosure this is one of my favorite new wave/80s song ever.

**oscarbrierley1** (10): yass bassline. i understand why this is the well known song from the album, its by far the best.

**phonethephoenix** (10): a great 80s pop song

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): It's got a romantic melancholy vibe that is perfect. The techno beat would make an amazing sample in a contemporary song.

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Slaps. Next question.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): They're just such a good band, the synths and her voice are perfection

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): pure pro-walk melancholy

**vayyiqra** (10): Heavily biased here by having seen Hana cover this on her streams a bunch of times but also it does bang and is one of the most clearly "good" songs on this album

**moonshxne** (9.5): a slay

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i said i thought this song was on the bee movie and three other people agreed so i can’t have been that wrong.

**Nagisoid** (9): Maybe Eurythmics were the singles band who single-handedly singled out their best song.

**pig-serpent** (9): On that two paths Yugioh meme where "Talk to me" is the guy in the center, which side has "like lovers do" and which side has "Ooooh, just talk to me?"

**qazz23** (9): Annie's vocals are amazing and the production is on point, not quite as good as Sweet Dreams though

**TiltControls** (9): Maybe I could've went for the obvious 11 on the album, but while this is great it doesn't have that 11 feel to it. Just a great song and that's it

**Frajer** (8.7): the synth pop ballad combo is a lot to handle

**impla77** (8.7): I hope this will do well, its a cute and catchy song.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): this is a grower

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): remind ya, i’m kinda, wet

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): …we sure she’s not sapphic?

**MassiveThief** (8): beautiful lil song

**RandomHypnotica** (8): i can picture this being on the scarface soundtrack

**akanewasright** (7.9): I really do love that chorus, but the rest can drag a bit

**Awkward\_King** (7): sincerely hope this doesn't win bc i find it overrated but i'm also a hater and it is quite a nice song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): this feels just a tiny bit too monotonous to me, but still such a great beat

**welcome2thejam** (7): Music for looking through a full height window at an overcast sky. Also its the 80s and you're in a troupe doing an interpretive dance

**Around-town** (6): Pretty Good

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (5.9): it rules that they already open with exactly the kind of "yes that's an 80s song" that loses value by the month, if not day. second second rate to a degree that revealed itself on the car stereo when I realized "why are the drum machines so limp? why are all the bells and whistles from adult contemporary, not the club?". Look, it's an honorable start to the album, but also it feels so chintzy and yeah whatever. who is renting a CD or buying a tape of this at the swap meet and saying "oh great album Here Comes the Rain Again" is on here? no one, and if they are they meant to get the Cure's Love that one has a bomb ass ditty about the rain.

apatel27: Given how this performed maybe Sweet Dreams was the better album for the rate 💀There was a lot more hatred towards this than I expected, yeah it’s a quintessential 80s 2 singles rest filler album but it’s good synthpop! The vision was blurry but I feel like they pulled it off pretty well. Would Sweet Dreams have done better? probably not. Would Be Yourself Tonight have? Honestly yeah but Here Comes the Rain Again was just too iconic to pass up. Whether it’s worth the album ending up on lowest album averages chart is a question for another time

**AHSWeeknd** (9.444): Eurythmics always made the best vibe albums

**Internal-End-9037** (8.667): Though I am not a Stan, in full disclosure Eurythmics are an all time act for me. So I tried to leave my bias at home. That said this album just has SO many keepers, especially for a late night club floor. Probably their most solid album overall. I know she was doing androgyny in this period but I don’t feel anything that directly speaks to it here outside of her fashion style at the time.

**nt96** (8.667): A pretty dope album. I fear it may get robbed but that’s due to the tight competition.

**shipperondeck** (8.111): this is gonna get robbed so hard i can feel it

**TiltControls** (7.889): let it be known i still wanted this rate even knowing this didn't have sweet dreams (but we should rate sweet dreams at some point too)

**Frajer** (7.878): It's easy to see why Annie is such an icon both musically and stylistically

**phonethephoenix** (7.667): okay I really liked the instrumentation and vocals but I think a lot of the songs are a bit repetitive? def still a good album!

**flava** (7.667): listening to this album while talking about the difference between fast foods joints in america and the uk

**plastichaxan** (7.511): Y’all undersold this album for me I was expecting to hear the worst synthpop ever so it just ended up sounding better but I guess they needed the help

**cremeebrulee** (7.500): this album was literally fine yall were doing too much on it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.333): This was a fine little electronic album but I felt like it didn't really overachieve or have any sort of consistent identity the way the other three here did... with the exception of the opening track of course

**impla77** (7.267): This album contains some of the other Eurythmics hits that aren’t Sweet Dreams, and those are strong tracks, but the other songs are not standout to me. Still a solid album, and I’m happy to see Eurythmics getting some rate representation!

**DirtyRat583** (7.000): like yeah theyre called eurythmics but they dont have to rely THAT much on the instrumental like

**ImADudeDuh** (6.833): where is sweet dreams

**ignitethephoenix** (6.756): I don’t know how else to describe this other than it’s muppet music

**welcome2thejam** (6.556): A little bit rough. Like it's good, didn't hate it, but not that much I'm heavily passionate about. Never really reaches that next gear overall

**Roxieloxie** (6.367): Very wacky and goofy. I dont think its as awful as some people were making it out to be but I get a bit why its divisive.

**vayyiqra** (6.333): Yeah ... I'm with the consensus that this album is a letdown, which is too bad because this band do have many great songs, but our host /u/apatel27 was right to say they're a singles group. I've listened to a lot of 80s new wave and synthpop, but never bothered listening to this group's albums because they didn't seem interesting, and that was born out here. Might give them another try since this isn't an awful album but they are sadly outmatched in this rate by everyone else here, even though they can write some all-timers when they're "on".

**mysario** (6.333): so many of these rates you can tell when an album is gonna usurp the others by a long shot. Sadly, this one is kind of the opposite, being carried by two big tunes and then a lot of less than stellar tracks that are gonna be in Day 1. But the songs that hit hit hard!

**oscarbrierley1** (6.111): feel like it has one or two signature songs, but the rest are kind of boring. it gets very repetitive. Also for a remaster it still sounds kind of bad, like the mixing is off.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.000): touch by little mix outsold this whole ass album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.944): doesn’t fully succeed at trying to be the best of two worlds: slick 80s pop and a rougher DIY indie/mutant disco sound.

**Nagisoid** (5.778): Eurythmics are a singles band to the core, but this album is nice. Sure, It has some absolute stinkers in the calypso track and the low energy cuts like Aqua, but the rest is pretty well done synthpop, even if it has aged considerably. However, some stuff here is definitely ahead of its time, like Here Comes the Rain Again and Paint a Rumour kinda feel a bit like LCD Soundsystem songs if they were way poppier? or at least like synthpop hits from the 2000s. I don't have much else to say other than they're a band that's good at their niche but not at much else. I thought this was going to be my least favorite judging from the discourse but Let's Dance is so weak except the singles that it stole that spot.

**moonshxne** (5.544): As someone who typically prefers deep cuts to singles, I'm flabbergasted. (I can be very forgiving of outdated production if the songwriting makes up for it. The songwriting was overall solid, but the deep cuts were unfortunately never that good to offset how rough-sounding some of the songs could get.)

**sarcasticsobs** (5.444): God, her voice is so COOL, but some of these tunes are BAD

**qazz23** (5.389): mixed bag, there are good synth and bass lines throughout but several weak tracks drag it down

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.222): why does every single song on this album sound like it was it was created within 5 minutes on a midi keyboard by people who never played music before

**Around-town** (5.167): I hadn't heard any of these songs before despite Sweet Dreams being a staple on my playlists. After listening I realize why; it's dull.

**MassiveThief** (5.111): not sure I'll be returning to this, a few good songs but for the most part I thought the production was surprisingly cheap sounding.

**dream\_fighter2018** (4.778): man, this album really meanders. Every song feels like it’s on 0.5x speed, and not only that but their band name is really hard to spell.

**pig-serpent** (4.778): Every song here has some good ideas but almost every song length feels padded from mind numbing repetition.

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (4.644): Was this album screened? All eurhythmics ever had was The Story. It's a variation on a classic The Story template of "band is throwing itself at a wall and has sudden breakthrough". And it was with that story they made Their Canonical One Hit. We're not rating the breakthrough album with Their Canonical One Hit, which is often outside that major accidental pop breakthrough, is a giant slab of "we have grace jones at home" that's pleasant but irreverent. The CD edition of Touch I rented, which preserves the whole whole second-class run of affairs on this album, doesn't move me or genuinely make a compelling case that Annie Lennox actually Had A Pop Vision or Control of Language that reveals a sense of illustrious songwriting, hooks, melodies, and unforgettable sounds. From second tier synths that noodle and sound lossy, revealing why Dare and New Gold Dreams are still colossal benchmarks of this era, to meandering bullshit that has exactly 0 things going on or acquires negative points solely on its existence. On top of an incredible amount of "why wouldn't you just listen to what was spinning at Paradise Garage?" chaff that isn't bad, but doesn't work for me becoming im coming to this after hearing 99 Records titles. While you can tell me that annie had great fits and was "culturally significant", exactly why is this album here over anything Japan or Duran Duran was putting out at the start of the 80s? I genuinely struggle to see strong inherit value, novelty, or necessity in having it compete in the silly online game (even albums i've dunked on I still am glad we rated and made sense). But Touch, good fucking god. just because yr androgynous doesn't mean you can write song, and just because you had a hit doesn't mean we need to spend 46 minutes with yr album.

**apatel27** (11): One of the greatest songs of all time. Nothing else to say. This was a front runner but never made it to the #1 spot. It did get close, at one point having a 0.5 total difference, but as the rate went on the Modern Love 11s kept pouring in slowly and surely cementing Pull Up to the Bumper in second place.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I think it was pretty clear that this song was always going to be near the top. It somehow never quite got to the heights of Modern Love though. it’s very good though, and it’s nice to se how it was almost always right up next to the top

---

**CrimsonROSET** (11): PULL UP!

**DirtyRat583** (11): me when i get an 11 win (rate hosts watching from a distance, giggling furiously)

**ImADudeDuh** (11): i mean come on, it’s Pull Up to the Bumper by Grace Jones. Need I say more?

**MrSwearword** (11): it's cliché to do but goddamnit this is the winner

**oscarbrierley1** (11): yass disco slay. the most night club vibe on the album.

**qazz23** (11): this is the best song here, everything is about this is great - it's groovy and catchy, the disco sound of this really works and the bassline goes hard

**sarcasticsobs** (11): Cool

**shipperondeck** (11): my obsession with his song

**slimboyfriend** (11): I’m trying to figure out the literal, non-sexual interpretation of this song… like, there’s a party in a parking ramp where everybody’s doing free tune-ups?

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): if I didn’t know better I would’ve guessed this title to be from a DCOM song

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (11): Buy an Island Home Video vhs from the late 80s to the early 90s and you'll be treated to a sample of this in their insanely long logo opening. Although, the most inspiring place you'll hear this cut is at a swap meet. It's a swap meet beat, digging and diving with confidence on the $1 table for the next "it" thing. I mean, at the time it wasn't a swap meet beat; that's mutant funk. bombed out nyc THRIVING. pulling up and clutching. the sound of a carnicería grilling the meats; the girls skipping rope; the gang heckling and hollering their way to a discount. It's INSANE to think this was a pop radio mainstay that still can catch the stray play on the right day. and sometimes, at the kobey's swap meet, when the right radio vendor playing the right radio station, on the right day you've dressed yrself up all fancy in yr mbv supreme jacket, a dress, and 14 eye white doc martens, you've pulled up to the bumper and you'll hear it and understand that truth. it's swaps and saunters just like you could. It is the saintly 11 and we're not even trying to be different for once; just populist.

**1998tweety** (10): this song is wet

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the hyper pop some artists wish to achieve

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This has some serious winner energy and, even though I’d most like for it to be Modern 11ove, I wouldn’t be mad at this winning at all.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): queen of anal

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): manifesting rate winner pleaaaassseeee

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): pulled up to the party like my name was El Niño…

**Nagisoid** (10): Okay I pull up, hop out at the after party

**nt96** (10): She literally put her face on top of Koyaaniqatsi and she slayed.

**phonethephoenix** (10): iconic sexy car-themed song for sure

**seanderlust** (10): i love songs about driving and nothing else :)

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Grace Jones... GRACE JONES

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): When it comes to songs that are unequivocally about anal this is miles ahead of “Bloom”

**welcome2thejam** (10): WAP 🤝 Pull Up to the Bumper: Trying to fit a large car into a tiny space

**Frajer** (9.5): if I had a nickel for every time cars were used as a sex metaphor I'd have a lot of nickels

**impla77** (9.5): Is it really an entendre if its this obvious? Anyway, a predictable slay

**Awkward\_King** (9): she INVENTED the word mother. like there were just parents before her, but when grace jones pulled up to that bumper, she MOTHERED

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): [Grace Jones said that this isn’t about anal sex](https://web.archive.org/web/20110818072441/http://news.qthemusic.com/2008/12/grace_jones_laughs_off_bumper.html) but I don’t believe her

**pig-serpent** (9): This had to be the main inspiration for Parapa's Driving Instructions, right?

**vayyiqra** (9): Yeah it's a banger and if Bowie doesn't win it'd be a good pick!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): i was listening to this album on my way to school in heavy traffic and this song made me think it was a mistake

**frogaranaman** (8): me to my Uber driver when I’m drunk

**IIIHenryIII** (8): ok, so the lips are the bumper, right?

**TiltControls** (8): Pull Up to the (possible) rate winner

**babadork** (7): I think most songs that compare women to cars take it a little too far. Like there’s finite room in your bumper. EVERYONE can’t pull in at the same time. I do appreciate that all genders are cars.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): the baseline is nice but it feels kinda empty as a song

**moonshxne** (6.3): Confirming my suspicion that I'm actually not the biggest fan of funk. I can admire the immaculate-sounding grooves, but in the same vein, this is so...spotless and controlled that there's little room for this to breathe, y'know? That, combined with the incredibly repetitive melody, makes this actually feel plodding. (There's some build-up in the back half that finally changes things up a tiny, tiny bit, but is it enough? No.) Anyway, I certainly like it looser.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i wish this was more exciting, it has a nice rhythm but it doesnt really go anywhere even though its 5 minutes long

apatel27: The album that inspired the rate idea and one that almost missed Day 1 completely. For the majority for the time this album either was all day 2+3 or close to by just 3-10 total points. Unfortunately it did end up being the last cut of Day 1 but that is just a testament to how good this album is. It’s one of the most influential albums of all time and for good reason. (and since I missed this in the initial writeup shoutout darj for the help reviewing the Grace Jones section)

**AHSWeeknd** (10.111): grace… Grace Jones… GRACE JONES!!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (10.111): Rarely ever has an album just oozed "Cool" like this one does. Unbelievable

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10.111): the entire I knew I would like Grace Jones, I just couldn't find the bloody albums! Well but I did! First there was the island life comp in late 2020, which is excellent. And then I won the ebay lot with the "full album on both sides" tape edition of nightclubbing (alongside Sweet Dreams! ha!); an edition that firmly says "my album is a statement no a nor b-side needed". And to my knowledge, there isn't an issue with the album. it's spotless, and any issue anyone has they straight up invented for a horeshit reason. Outside of Come Away With ESG, this is the essential NYC mutant funk album/document, a true blue sonic moment and legitimate bonafide master statement that should be noted as a benchmark for over 40 years of pop music. Contained inside is a sound that's less a product of that place than Nassau, Jamaica; the work of Chris Blackwell, Alex Sadkin, and a menagerie of musicians that all were trying NOT QUITE to make disco but also PAY ATTENTION to emerging evolutions in dance music happenings. The results were too good and also birthed Warm Leatherette, but Nightclubbing was where the magic lied. And the shocking thing? A lot of this is covers or cuts written by others around 'em! There were novel innovations and the right ears in the room to translate a 70s energy into the big tuff 'ol 80s. And simply, this is a delicate dabble between synthesizer pop and dub-laden dance punk pumped out to MAXIMUM DUB strength. Still an unstoppable sound and amongst the most life affirming. One that retains retaining a playfully polyglot mode in its languages and styles of dance from the turn of the decade and end of 70s it's looking to. And like a panopticon, Grace Jones' voice is omnipresent all over, spinning into its own rhythm and trance with absolute finesse; each word a truth and a vision that DEMANDS an audience and practically commits itself. what happened to real pop stars like this? sexy aliens that could cruise off legitimate mystique and big vibe production with no fuss? Nightclubbing stands as a benchmark and a true vision of a moment where high and low cultures in a melting pot were so fine tuned to each other and producing that kind of vibe for a culture that could exists/

**nt96** (9.500): An absolute masterpiece from an absolute legend. So many of our faves owe a big debt to Grace Jones and her contributions to art and fashion. Nobody does it like her.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.056): Grace Jones’ easy confidence serves this album beautifulyl. She’s both commanding and laidback on various cuts here, making you draw closer to what she’s saying. Spry, minimal grooves and post-disco production makes this such a fun listen

**qazz23** (8.944): love the disco/funk/dub sounds here, every track is good and even the covers have a unique spin to them

**impla77** (8.878): An album I hadn’t heard before but will absolutely be returning to, this album still feels fresh 40 years later. Grace Jones performs brilliantly on every track, there are bops galore, I’m happy I’ve been introduced to this album!

**plastichaxan** (8.833): Great discovery for me, I’ve wanted to get into her music for a while now and I believe this was a great introduction wow

**Frajer** (8.756): Grace Jones Aretha Anita Grace Jones it's easy to see why she's such an icon

**DirtyRat583** (8.744): contrarians when they realise the very popular album is in fact amazing

**phonethephoenix** (8.667): I feel like it used "cool" a lot in my comments but this actually is one of the coolest albums I've listened to

**Internal-End-9037** (8.278): I LOVE that most tracks are 4 minutes or more it really let’s the moods stretch out making many songs even more carnal and sexual. Also I should note Ms. Jones knows how to select songs that suit her and again flip them into some serious sensual covers. From Bill Withers to Ástor Piazzolla she covers (pun not intended) a lot of ground. A few tracks stood out sonically, which keeps the album from rising to absolute perfection for me but as an overall mood it is definitely a winner that still sounds fresh and ahead of it’s time and oozes androgyny as intended. And of the four albums it reads the most sexual ambiguous.

**Nagisoid** (8.111): This is an extremely consistent album. It's easy to downplay how influential it was because it's been a long time since it was released, but a lot of popular musicians today take lots of inspiration from Grace during this era. The songs do vary in quality considerably because there's a lot of different songwriters, notably the track written by Sting is somewhat bland, but the rest mesh together suprisingly well. I don't have that much to say other than this is very enjoyable and there were two very big 11 candidates for me in this album, and it was my second favorite from this rate.

**shipperondeck** (8.056): i hate to say it but i have to thank some white guys (duran duran) for getting me into grace jones by recommending this album :sob:

**mysario** (7.833): for an album called "Nightclubbing", I'm not hearing much of these at night clubs (probably cause they're tasteless)

**TiltControls** (7.833): it's March 26th. Do you know where your rate winner is?

**MassiveThief** (7.778): I'll admit this isn't really my thing, but I definitely appreciate the artistry here. Grace Jones is a force of nature

**Roxieloxie** (7.722): I think if i went back in the future and listened to it, it would grow on me a bit more! Its not bad but it wasnt super my thing if that makes sense. I think i've enjoyed a few other Grace Jones songs i've heard but overall not a bad listen

**moonshxne** (7.678): Undeniably great and my favorite body of work from the rate, but I still can't help but find the record a bit of a missed opportunity; something about this feels less than the sum of its (for the most part, undeniably S-tier) parts. 1) I didn't vibe with "Pull Up To The Bumper", and 2) I personally would have preferred something either looser-sounding and more euphoric and, well, "boppier", OR something even more subdued and atmospheric. Still, I probably should just give Nightclubbing credit for being released in the 80s and sounding this well-made.

**vayyiqra** (7.556): An artist I never really got into, though I have liked a few of her tracks ("Warm Leatherette" for one) but otherwise missed the boat on. For much of my life I only knew her from the James Bond series, lmao. Now I can say I get the hype, this album's pretty good! It also does deliver on the "night" part of the title at least.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.556): This album is like NOT what I expected at all from all the praise it gets. I thought it was gonna be an album of party bangers, like the Renaissance of the 80s. Still fun to listen to, just in a more subtle way

**welcome2thejam** (7.333): Sound feels a bit too cold & distant to really hit my tastes, but I see the appeal and still a good album overall. Grace has a good presence on record

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.278): honestly im a little disappointed by how laid back this album is i thought it would be a lot more energetic and poppy, still a lot of great tunes though

**oscarbrierley1** (6.833): for an album called nightclubbing there's not many songs i'd want to dance to.

**cremeebrulee** (6.411): gonna be honest, this did not click with me much. demo man and libertango were nice but the rest of it was kinda boring

**Around-town** (5.833): Especially for albums from the pre-streaming era, I tend to form my overall impression from how pleased I would have been after buying a record. I'd be pleased with this one.

**pig-serpent** (5.667): Some of these songs make for really good chill out vibe music, and none of it makes for good club music.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.333): I feel deceived, where the club bangers at? I was expecting Renaissance but I got 4 instead.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): To me, this is one of the Bowie songs of all time. The bounciness of the lyrics and the sax invokes a very specific feeling of a part of the 80s. Frankly, this song was pretty much always in the top position, and I’ll take it as a rate winner.

**apatel27** (10): The clear winner of the rate. At no point in the entire rate was this not in first place and it’s clear to see why! The sax is amazing and Bowie’s delivery is perfect. It’s a great song and a worthy winner even if isn’t my first choice.

---

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): This was the only song that I really knew from this rate before I did it so it feels VERY basic to 11, but what can I say no other song managed to GET TO ME TO THE CHUUUURCH OOON TIIIIME SAXOPHONE SOLO

**flava** (11): mega bop

**Frajer** (11): forever Greta Gerwig pilled by this song, also what is he doing with that paper boy he's catching

**ignitethephoenix** (11): a good pop song!

**IIIHenryIII** (11): me to Prime Video every time they show me a Modern Love trailer

**MassiveThief** (11): It's groovy. It's powerful. Bowie's vocals are soaring and passionate. Dat sax. I love every little thing about this song. And it GETS ME TO THE CHUUUUURCH ON TIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIME

**moonshxne** (11): gorgeously organic synthesis of rock and 80s synthpop, but also just one of those songs with such undeniable universal appeal

**mysario** (11): my friend always called this "Church on Time" growing up so much to the point I had to question if I actually knew the name of this song but I don't care it slaps all the same

**Nagisoid** (11): I love that Beach House song!

**pig-serpent** (11): Like being blasted by good vibes from a fire hydrant. A masterclass in writing songs that do one thing for the whole duration, that many other songs from this rate should've taken.

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): I too don't want to go out, I want to stay in so that I can get things done (play fire emblem engage)

**vayyiqra** (11): I have another niche specific memory of hearing this song on the radio while on the bus to Catholic school staring out the window at the sky. You had better believe it was a revelation! Many times in my life I'm put this on loop and listened to it over and over, utterly transfixed, and I never do that. I learned how to play it on piano and don't even really play piano. In 2011, I sent it to a girl I was dating. She replied "this is a weird song" (complimentary), and she was right. It might be my very favourite song ever. Twenty years later, I'm not sure if I believe in modern love, and no religion, so I feel like Bowie, still laying in the rain. 😔 🎷

**welcome2thejam** (11): I'm not permitted to listen to this downtown because otherwise I'll carelessly Frances Ha myself across multiple city blocks with zero regard for life

**AHSWeeknd** (10): come through gospel

**babadork** (10): This is my dog’s 11. She can be kind of basic, but I think her taste might be superior to mine in this rate.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): when the sax just pops off aaaaaah

**cremeebrulee** (10): more artists should sell out idk just a thought

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i wouldn’t be surprised if we did this rate specifically for this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is kind of undeniable

**frogaranaman** (10): this was kinda like simping before that word existed

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Perfect song, fuck u!!

**seanderlust** (10): saxophonists were really killing it in the 80s

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): honestly this is probably objectively better than lets dance and deserves my 11 more but i have more sentimental attachment to title track so it gets the 11 instead, but man what a song!!!

**TiltControls** (10): too damn catchy for its own good

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I'd also go to church more often if it made me feel like this

**DirtyRat583** (9.5): everybody cut footloose !

**1998tweety** (9): she bops

**qazz23** (9): good upbeat opener, love the backing vocals and horns

**RandomHypnotica** (9): this is just a cut Grease song

**Stryxen** (8.9): [comment idea: harry styles] [note: remember not to elaborate under any circumstances]

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I am just now realizing that this is the song that I saw that show choir performing back in eighth grade.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): i didn't realise that he sang this.

**impla77** (8): This is just really catchy

**Internal-End-9037** (8): Alfred Doolittle is that you?

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (7.8): as soon as i put the cd in and remembered this track I was like "wow its the 20th best bowie single, 48th best bowie song". such 7.8/10 energy for the rate!

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): saxophone!! it's a catchy refrain but also not my favorite ever

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this song called modern love from 50 years ago gives me “New Super Mario Bros” energy

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): this song just tires me. it feels like it has a 3 minute chorus after the intro and until sax comes in. church on time terrifies me I guess

# Let's Dance

---

**Overall Average**: 7.162 **// Average Controversy:** 2.095

---

apatel27: The other controversial album pick in the rate, there’s a few good reasons this is here instead of Scary Monsters. 1) The sound fits a lot better than Scary Monsters would. 2) It’s his breakout pop album which remains his best selling album of all time. Why not rate it on Popheads? 3) There’s an 80s Art Pop rate idea floating around with Scary Monsters that was being submitted around the time this rate was being created that fit Scary Monsters a lot better and the creator has said they’re resubmitting it next cycle  so vote for it!  (n) Now with that out of the way, this is a very front loaded album and it shows in the results. Nile and Bowie had good ideas but a lot of this was half baked.

**nt96** (9.625): the first half is literal perfection. Bowie is one of my biggest influences and it’s crazy how it took us this long to finally rate him. Bowie and Prince, the greatest musicians that ever lived. May they both rest in peace.

**vayyiqra** (9.250): A weird album for Bowie - because it both wants to be his pop 80s "sellout" album, yet it's kind of not. It's far from one of his artsier or more respected albums like the Berlin trilogy, and it's definitely not my pick for a first Bowie album for us to rate. It's also heavily frontloaded and carried by its three big singles. Despite that, it's one of my most listened Bowie albums and has a lot of replay value. A lot of that is its monstrous opening track, one of his very best songs, but also the wild personnel on this - Nile Rodgers and Giorgio Moroder are just two of the many legends who worked on it - elevate even the filler-y tracks from "some of Bowie's most mid songwriting" to "pretty enjoyable album full of bops". I'm not mad we rated it, especially if "Modern Love" wins.

**mysario** (8.438): this is the closest the sub will get to rating Stevie Ray Vaughan

**IIIHenryIII** (8.438): ok, I think it’s time for me to dive into his discography. I loved this.

**cremeebrulee** (8.325): yeah this was a smash

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.125): I still don’t know much about David Bowie even after listening to this album… I assume he shows more personality on his earlier albums? This did have its fair share of bops and bangers though, and somehow it’s my highest average out of all the albums here?

**Internal-End-9037** (8.000): Was this really his androgynous phase? I don’t know but I do know it is a top heavy album with strong Nile Rogers production. I imagine for those who came to Bowie in the 70s this is a bit of a let down (especially after the much darker and wider Scary Monsters And Super Creeps). Great pop record with vastly overplayed hits, where some album cuts also really shine and could played out at clubs. Nothing about this record signifies androgyny to me or expresses anything in a very androgynous way.

**Frajer** (7.938): Nile Rodgers is forever the GOAT

**shipperondeck** (7.638): EVERYONE STAND FOR NILE RODGERS!!!! WOOOOOOO!!!!!!!! MR RODGERS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (7.575): How do you put such a perfect song on the same record as "China Girl"? Fuck off

**MassiveThief** (7.563): far from my favorite Bowie album, but solid.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.350): aesthetically speaking this is what i aspire to like the hair the clothes he put his whole bowussy into it

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.125): Some flubs but otherwise a solid Bowie album for its highlights. Coldest take ever, 70s catalogue outsold

**phonethephoenix** (7.063): listened a lot of Bowie growing up but this isn't my parents favorite album so I this is the first time I've listened to it in it's totality! I don't think it's his best work but definitely some good songs

**DirtyRat583** (6.925): nile rodgers my beloved

**welcome2thejam** (6.875): Guessing this is a terrible David Bowie album to have as your first, huh

**qazz23** (6.813): this album is quite uneven - the title track, Modern Love, and Cat People really stand out, others are a mixed bag

**impla77** (6.800): Of course David Bowie has a very expansive discography so sometimes it seems as if the albums are reliant on the hits to carry them.. and one of the hits in this case has aged terribly. Again, a fine album but not amazing.

**slimboyfriend** (6.688): My dream of rating an actually good David Bowie album will have to wait :(

**Nagisoid** (6.000): Oh Bowie, I'm so sorry... I'm a huge stan and I love lots of his other albums; Heroes, Low, Station to Station, Ziggy Stardust, Scary Monsters, a lot more. Sadly, this album does not do it for me. It is way too repetitive and barebones for most of its runtime. I'm not joking when I say the only thing worth listening here are the singles, the album cuts genuinely sound like demos that were given to Bowie as filler between the singles. The hits are not even that good enough to save the album, which is the saddest part. Modern Love is great sure, but it's far from being a perfect song and that goes for Let's Dance as well. China Girl could have been perfect if it developed better, but it stagnates a fair bit in it structure. It's sad that we rate one of his worst and most skippable albums first, but at least that means we can get to his masterpieces later, hopefully.

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (5.938): In all honesty, you cannot talk about androgyny without understanding the uniquely English, suburban cult of Bowie Boys and from there, the Bromley Coalition that will mutate it out of glam and further into goth. Therein lies a story of 70s fashion that turns into a cultural moment. And it's that fashion that EVERYONE had to take notes from. Bowie's gay boy fans understood the fashion and the demarcations it provided; my mother would see it first hand when she saw Bowie play a Virginia stadium show in the 70s as a young girl. From here is where second tier glam princesses are molded and punks learn of philosophy. The suburbs and its hegemony amongst a lack of options breathes this to life, and the spectral fictive qualities that also bubble underneath champion as well (see also the tumultuous grief of Phillip K Dick's VALIS which includes Bowie randomly showing up OR the Venture Brothers which continually toys with a famous Bowie character and outfit over SEASONS; both wildly inventive realizations that acknowledge the allure of what Bowie Boys instinctively understand). Unfortunately, you have to hand it to him. Of course though, in spite of my fascination of the suburbs and the fashion reaction to it, I have never given a lot of shits about Bowie. Not even on "dude bro did bad shit and we all know it" pearl clutching and stumping; i simply prefer listening to Eno. Bowie's singles have become such a lingua franca and implicit understanding that they are basically akin to Star Wars at this point; even if you've never seen it you basically have a baseline understanding. Coming to Let's Dance, armed basically with my 14-year old understanding of Ziggy Stardust and about 20 singles of Bowie's in my head, I really did not anticipate I was going to give a shit what happened on this album. It seemed like a genuinely baffling choice chosen on the basis of a) "we never rated bowie haha!" and b) "there's TWO singles here!" when coming up with a functioning roster of 4 to rate. And truthfully, there is another David (Slyvian) who is androgynous and straight up had a better run of 80s releases that accomplish a few things here on Let's Dance with MUCH more finesse (also how was Scary Monsters just not considered for this rate at all? again, what the FUCK is up with curation here?). But not to get carried away, Let's Dance is just shoddy fucking work from a guy who basically cleans it up with singles. This album, mercilessly short, is held together by having a pretty solid A-side that gives way to 4 cuts that sorta exist because I guess they needed something to fill the time. At no point do I ever seem to give a shit to lend a gender reading or reach an enlightenment with this album; the cuts (not singles) here by the year lose value. they seem to exist in purgatory states: empty 80s club ballroom floors, parking lots where you hear a stray cut on yr FM, pizza parlors that are greasy and have bepperonini on the floor. Let's Dance isn't an album that will convince a bowie skeptic "this guy rocked"; if anything, it confirms the agnosticism.

**moonshxne** (5.862): he really fell off mid-album

**Roxieloxie** (5.537): Dont think bowie is for me, I listened to this one again to try and see and yeah im pretty confident in that. sorry to british people

**Album Stats**

* Touch becomes the 21st lowest rated album on the sub, enough to hit the leaderboard
 * This knocks Selena Gomez - Revival off the list meaning no rate has all of its albums in the bottom 25 anymore (Confident (20th) and Bangerz (2nd) are still there though)
