**static\_int\_husp** (7): Honestly I feel like this is ok. I can see why people may not have liked it, but it is kinda surprising to see this finish so low.

**apatel27** (6): Yeah this is the weakest of the album but it’s not as bad as some are trying to make it out as being. I actually really like the instrumental but it’s easy to see why popheads would have such a visceral reaction to a 2 minute, fairly repetitive, instrumental break (still didn’t deserve bottom place and at one point 4 average!)

---

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): this is so quirky but in a very good way

**shipperondeck** (9): could be a mega man stage theme

**Frajer** (8.5): major mood

**Internal-End-9037** (8.5): The repetitive throb of resentment and anger after catching your lover in the act is choice.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): honestly a mood sometimes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this was kind of a bop

**nt96** (8): girl same

**Past\_Opportunity7344** (8): Sadly it's not barbie girl

**impla77** (7.1): ‘Don’t talk to me about it’- This reminds me of when I couldn’t force myself to watch the RPDR S9 finale because Shea lost..

**1998tweety** (7): bop band

**akanewasright** (7): I did not hate it

**celladonn** (7): why is this named after the barbie girl band

**phonethephoenix** (7): actually really like it even though I think it could maybe be shorter. does feel like being in water tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's nice but a lot of these Eurythmic songs are more slower and subdued than I would have liked

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): bloop bloop

**CrimsonROSET** (6): after what will probably be the results i don’t blame her

**slimboyfriend** (6): mood

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): this is not THAT bad

**TiltControls** (6): nothing wrong with a vibey song, but please make that vibe actually vibe

**vayyiqra** (6): A pretty alright song! Doesn't go anywhere and gets old after a while but it's not awful! Give your 10s to "Barbie Girl"!

**moonshxne** (5.5): no thoughts, just boop boop boop

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Yes, I heard you the first time

**Stryxen** (5): ok yass i love when good albums fall off it reminds me the good part is good

**Around-town** (4): Boring

**flava** (4): song exists

**plastichaxan** (4): Okay I think I get the claims that this isn’t good but just this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is the song that plays in a movie when the main character goes to a kind stranger’s house and their family is sitting around a camp fire and you get the sense that theyre evil but it hasnt been revealed yet

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (4): "don't touch me" vocal delivery...goodness where do I know this from? she's specifically hitting a certain beat or pop standard (tradition?). anyways wow another song that chews the scenery and exists to show some bells and whistles and perform a middling croon over that just KEEPS GOING. wow they coulda cut like 10 minutes on this album.

**welcome2thejam** (4): I don't necessarily mind repetitive, but that was rough.

**pig-serpent** (3): We will never speak again.

**sarcasticsobs** (3): Yea, sure, what-the-fuck ever, man. "Bloop bloop. Bloop bloop. Bloop bloop." Fuck off

**Ghost-Quartet** (2.5): I wish I were listening to bubblegum dance legends Aqua instead of this boring track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I don’t know if it’s supposed to be her drowning or something but man I am not a fan of the little noises that start up in the middle of this one.

**IIIHenryIII** (2): the glass of water I’m drinking somehow is tastier

**Nagisoid** (2): The Barbie Girls auteurs could never make such a boring song

**Awkward\_King** (0): this is not barbie girl

**DirtyRat583** (0): im sorry im really sorry because the intro instrumental fucks but the rest is just ?? what r u doing

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): glub glub??? Are you a fish???

**qazz23** (0): it's so bad you could be listening to Barbie Girl instead

**RandomHypnotica** (0): girl i was so fucking bored

**static\_int\_husp** (5): This is the most controversial song in the rate and for good reason. It is supposed to be a song that is against the attitude of the character Bowie inhabits in the song. However, it is fairly easy to misinterpret as him actually thinking those things. Musically it’s fine, but it does make me feel slightly uneasy, so I can see it going out early.

**apatel27** (4): Ignoring the implications of the lyrics, this is still a pretty poor track to me. It’s very by the books and for an Iggy/Bowie/Nile collab, it’s very underwhelming

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): it’s such a bop, but is it controversial in the 2020s?

**flava** (10): it’s like if someone from 2003 went back in time to the 80s and made a song influenced by GTA Vice City

**vayyiqra** (10): Somewhere on my computer I have a whole dumb essay on this song analyzing the lyrics in more depth, but I'm in a pessimistic (and even guilty) mood right now about 10ing this, so instead I'll just say this. 1) If you hate everything about this, that's understandable and valid; and 2) for most of my life I never thought too hard about it and fully believed (and still do to a great extent) it was simply about drugs.

**Internal-End-9037** (9.5): The 80s obsession with the orient (especially in pop music) is a fascinating dive. This is one of the better expositions on the topic and has a nice haunting tone. I suppose credit for that goes to Iggy Pop who wrote it and helped with the music. Iggy always ads a little dark edge to things. It does contain that cliché “oriental riff” that was basically born in the 1940s to signify something exotic or foreign in movies, commercials, cartoons, and music. Is that PC anymore? I don’t think it matters since musically we’ve moved so far away from it that nobody even really notices it as signifying anything anymore and is just merely part of the song. But that riff was everywhere for a moment.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ok, Bowie is a real one for releasing his own version of this song to help his friend

**babadork** (8.6): Ultimately, rock guys from the 70s are too creepy for me to trust this song, so it loses points.

**Nagisoid** (8): He's a little confused but he's got the spirit

**Stryxen** (8): almost thirsted for his vocals but remembered this man is called dave. We must do better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): oh boy i cant wait to see what the comments on this one look like!

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (8): The pearl clutching that's gonna nuke this one is warranted and also near sighted. It's funny in that its not the only Iggy Pop cut that's in the rate, but instead of going to grace it goes to Bowie. And I think the sinofunk instrumental is fantastic; a genuine album highlight (that seems to be aware of Japan and perhaps Robert Smith if not still unable to get to those levels). But dude...these lyrics are the product of writing the dumbest love song one-dimensional vapid shit you can imagine and then saying and "dw iggy i'll cover it with NO finesse". bowie is on autopilot with these words, unable to provide I think a real depth to our shitty character here or reduce the one dimensional image into complete artifice that matches with the track and would impart the ultimate "art pop artifice" affect. An insane level of tone deaf orientalism on display in the video and in that delivery (even Japan and the goths were better than this!). You can take it or leave it in the memory hole fire and shockingly I was taking it. Dude went out and toured this for years! And no one cared perhaps? But there's no critic roundtable today on why this song is bad as much as there is limited understanding of the tumultuous Berlin era for Bowie (and Iggy) by raters here; no one could do this today but then those guys were deep in their shit. As a final tidbit from the youtube comments: "The actress here actually became Bowie's GF. He took her on his Let's Dance tour. She was a Bowie fan before she was chosen for this role. Can you imagine how thrilling this must have been for her?". wow why am I melting in the bad way suddenly?

**MassiveThief** (7.5): Won't comment on the thematic... weirdness, but song is pretty good. Bass line goes hard.

**Frajer** (7): I was gonna zero this because it's so problematic but it's catchy and I'm feeling tragic like I'm Marlon Brando is an incredible line

**pig-serpent** (7): When you're dared to write a song using the oriental riff without using the oriental riff.

**plastichaxan** (7): I thought this was gonna be awful kajakdhjd

**welcome2thejam** (7): "Oh, so Genius says it's actually about 'invasion and exploitation.'" Saying this, he casually threw aside a large rock

**moonshxne** (6.9): Ugh. As a Chinese girl, well...it's clearly at least partially satire/condemnation of racism and colonialism (visions of swastikas?!), and it's a well-made bop! But holy shit that pentatonic riff is literally the most token shit I've ever heard, and it just makes me just unable to fully enjoy this. Also, his delivery of this and (constant use of "little China girl" 🥴) is what I think of when journalists refer to a singer as a "crooner" (derogatory)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I actually think this sounds really good as a song but yeah gotta take off some points for being idiotic.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): the production truly is carrying the song cause his vocals and the lyrics aren’t doing anything

**akanewasright** (6): I didn’t hate this one (I also didn’t hear a single lyric), but [if you invest your energy into defending it from racism allegations…](https://youtu.be/Yy3dIicSI_0)

**oscarbrierley1** (6): weird vocals

**qazz23** (6): good bass throughout but I like Iggy's version better

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I think the thing that floors me the most about this song is how Bowie is basically implying that every white man just has an innate “MUST COLONIZE” mode that gets triggered whenever they see a non-white person

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): music is a 10, lyrics are a 0

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): have yet to dance (by that i mean wiggle my arms as I listen) once to this album called let’s dance

**DaHumanTorch** (4): visions of WHAT in your head???

**DirtyRat583** (4): intro turns me off

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this whole rate is a setup to make david bowie rank below blackpink in the artist rankings

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): me and my friends were watching labyrinth and my friend was so shocked to find out david bowie was a pedophile or at the very least maintained very uncomfortable relationships with underage girls. throughout the film whenever he was on screen she'd just go "really? no way" and we were like GIRL? are you watching the same film as us???

**1998tweety** (3): erm

**Around-town** (3): It's bad enough that halfway through I resented it for not being over.

**celladonn** (3): i know this is meant to kind of skewer racism and stereotypes but it still doesn't really sit right with me

**phonethephoenix** (3): I do think that the intentions here were possibly/probably okay but I am not sure about the title/refrain/use of eastern sounds. good guitar but ultimately pretty repetitive and uninteresting

**dream\_fighter2018** (2.5): sonically, this is fine, but the lyrics are beyond the pale and are a barrier I don’t want to cross.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Y’all can just like an Asian girl without being weird about it… especially gross since [the woman the song is allegedly about](https://www.songfacts.com/facts/david-bowie/china-girl) isn’t even Chinese. At least it isn’t musically abhorrent.

**seanderlust** (2): uuuuuuuuuhhhhh...well, winner of the Not As Bad As It Could Have Been But Still Pretty Yikes Award?

**CrimsonROSET** (1): im

=====

static_int_husp: **cloudbustingmp3** (0): now sir what was this. i get that apparently it's about how westernization destroys local culture but it's just so... poorly done lmao

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): reading up on this being an ironic takedown of Asian Woman fetishism (and it having other meanings, plus helping Iggy Pop get some money, Niles Rodgers thinking this song was about drugs, there was a LOT going on here lklksd). Still, when I listen/watch the video in 2023 it feels like one of those things like “Wolf on Wall Street”, “American Psycho” where they’re like “oh yeah these movies are about how BAD these guys are, don’t be like them! It’s a warning!” But their glitzy romantic life still has legions of men stanning these characters. With this song, noble intentions, poor execution.

**impla77** (0): I don’t want to get into the weeds with this one.. so I’m just gonna say it’s a no from me and move on

**Roxieloxie** (0): shut the hell up

**sarcasticsobs** (0): [Pretending that the video and that lot of these lyrics don't exist voice]: Ha ha, placing this after a perfect pop song, good one David! (I never liked this song much even outside of said lyrics and video, and I have fully renounced it ever since learning its inspiration was a VIETNAMESE woman (I don't give a shit that Iggy says it was a "metaphor"). I also don't care that this release was an attempt to "help" Iggy Pop, shit sucks)

**shipperondeck** (0): if he was trying to make actually commentary here it wasnt good enough

**apatel27** (7.5): The biggest sufferer of longsongphobia, but it is a song about shooting up heroin so maybe it deserved

**static\_int\_husp** (7): The biggest issue with this song is that Annie is *way* oversinging. Other than that I quite like the rest of the aspects of it.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): not sure if I just turned up my volume or if Annie Lennox just moved closer to the mic

**nt96** (10): I love this so much. It’s a perfect balance of chill and hope

**shipperondeck** (9.2): wait a minute wait a minute

**flava** (9): unexpected late album slay

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): love the way she just HURLS herself into the song

**impla77** (8): Oh its a heroin song

**Internal-End-9037** (8): Listen… can you hear it? Here Comes The Rain Again is all over this track in the synth. Like they practically copied their own song. But instead of feeling lazy it feels more like a call back or an evolution of emotions. Tip: Look up the live version on YouTube.

**Nagisoid** (8): Nah to the ah to the no no no

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended Bebe Rexha

**TiltControls** (7.5): the song itself could've been more interesting but Annie kills the vocals here

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Annie Lennox teleports behind you "Psssh…nothin personnel…kid…"

**phonethephoenix** (6.7): see like it's a nice song but kind of repetitive

**letsallpoo** (6): this is ionnalee

**sarcasticsobs** (6): Centrist Anthem

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (6): (me, trying to excite myself listening to touch) hey its electro-dub! oh wait they put that shitty drone underneath. god damn it. oh cool she does that thing with her voice. they're trying. i gotta hand it to 'em

**welcome2thejam** (6): Their intros do a great job at making me feel like a sci-fi noir detective

**Around-town** (5): I didn't like it that much, but it was an interesting song.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): A song under four minutes long! A song under four minutes long! My kingdom for a song under four minutes long!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): not the gun shot sound effects lkdskdskl

**IIIHenryIII** (5): that doesn’t sound like a gun at all

**qazz23** (5): this drags a bit but there's some neat synth sounds along with the chanted chorus

**Stryxen** (5): the interesting parts aren’t interesting enough to make up for the okay fine parts

**vayyiqra** (5): Once again in the weird situation of "liking Annie Lennox's voice but her vocals aren't working for me here" even though it's technically impressive she can do those intervals. I would also say this is proto-Austra but nobody here but Benji has ever listened to them before and idk if he's even doing this rate but since I brought him up hi /u/Uberpigeon 👋

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): this sounds like an exercise in drama

**CrimsonROSET** (4): some of these choices are funny in a non good way

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): war is bad the only good war is plants vs zombies

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): this is boring and annoying. PICK A STRUGGLE!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (3): no anything

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): fear, hate, pain, and broken hearts are four things that i feel while listening to this album

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): no nothing

**pig-serpent** (2): This song feels much longer than its title.

**DaHumanTorch** (0): this was the sonic equivalent of being violently strangled to death

**frogaranaman** (0): tough one to get through

**apatel27** (8): Wow people really hated this one. Yeah it’s a little goofy but that’s the appeal! Unfortunately the majority doesn’t agree

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This song is overall pretty decent but I think the main thing that holds it back is the fairly simple rhythm and the “regrets! ooh!” that continuously punctuates the song.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): yass&slayy Young Marble Giants

**Awkward\_King** (9): rugrats ass song

**Stryxen** (8.5): oh this is good. Okay im on board with this album choice now

**AHSWeeknd** (8): which country is it though?

**Frajer** (8): Annie doing her own background vocals is insane

**phonethephoenix** (8): okay love a snappy little tune about regrets

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the thing raters will have in the reveal when they realize this album is good

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): That intro is so 2000s I love it

**1998tweety** (7.5): no ragrets

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): not listening to this

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (7.5): they were trying the hardest they could, to make the most stilted, unsexy synthpop with some gate filters and after effects. It's genuinely a minimal as hell cut that works on a sound system, but outside of that it's just pleasant I guess? like when this is what I'm deeming is "the best cut on the album" the entire vibe of the release is fucked. even the outro is too damn long

**akanewasright** (7): they had a cool beat and then did nothing with it

**flava** (7): it’s a bit repetitive but still bops

**qazz23** (7): i like how there's a robotic, mechanical vibe to this; some might find the squeaky synths annoying though

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): it’s started good and then slowly descended into something

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): you gotta respect them for putting out a song this weird

**oscarbrierley1** (6): it starts off good but then it just does not go anywhere, gets boring by the end.

**vayyiqra** (6): Liking the "quirky" Gary Numan-esque instrumental but then the lyrics are so "???" ("I'm a hungry Mohican"? What?) it's throwing me off.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): yeah i have a lot of them, unrelated to the rate i just needed that off my chest

**frogaranaman** (5): oh this is when you realize albums were made to fill a physical disc up back in the 80s

**welcome2thejam** (5): Feels a bit too bare, though the last minute packs a bit of life in it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): You know it really doesn’t take long for the terror of “9 songs 46 minute runtime” to kick in on this album.

**CrimsonROSET** (4): that went on for so fucking long how

**Nagisoid** (3): I regret spending time hearing this song, like some NES era synths sound better than this shit.

**MassiveThief** (1): unfortunately jumping on the hate bandwagon - who ok'd this goofy ass instrumental

**sarcasticsobs** (1): Fkcning hell, that horn/synth/whatever da fuck is annoying. Oh geezus, so is that bass guitar. What the hell is this? Why would you put this after a slapper? Why you even put this out in general?

**moonshxne** (0): girl what is this??? the synths were a CHOICE

**mysario** (0): glad I powered through it but this song almost made me wanna stop the rate 2 songs in

**pig-serpent** (0): Punctuating your slow songs with annoying sounds every measure doesn't make it interesting or pleasant to listen to.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): what the fuck

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This is a very weird song, for sure. Some of that weirdness is kind of charming to me, but on the other hand, the monotone-ness of the lyrical delivery could be pretty offputting to some.

**apatel27** (3): Yeah easily the worst song in the rate for me. It doesn’t gel and the Ricochet! It’s not the end of the world sucks badly. Not even the radio cut-ins help this.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): what is the sound of gold though?

**nt96** (9.5): this waltz is so disorienting and I love it

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): this just goes off like the girls who get it get it

**CrimsonROSET** (9): cult music (compliment)

**vayyiqra** (9): For a long time I didn't like this one and thought the (literally) offbeat drums didn't work and it was a mess, but it's grown on me and it is catchy.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.6): Clap clap. Clap clap. Clap clap. Clap clap.

**DirtyRat583** (7.7): i think ive heard this on the radio but it sounds... different? it may be the remaster

**impla77** (7.7): Very cool elements to this track.. also didn’t realise the speaking parts were still Bowie, I thought it was from some film.

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): this one is kind of hard for me to rate because it's one of the less straightforward on the album is to me and I think maybe too long but I also like it for both those reasons lol. nice musically, especially near the end

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): lmaoooooo what the fuck is this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Now what is this art project

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (6): pretty good ditty to play the Valve game ricochet to ngl. every time i think about giving this more points though i remember "the chorus is cornball and second rate oingo" and that it's 5+ minutes when it needs to be 270 seconds max

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): something something valve joke

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): cute idea, amorphous execution

**indie\_fan\_** (5.4): gets too repetitive for me after a while even though it has some promising stuff

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this song started so abruptly

**IIIHenryIII** (5): maybe it’s a grower

**qazz23** (5): has a dub influence but feels aimless

**Stryxen** (5): didn’t do much for me :/

**welcome2thejam** (5): Partly spoken word chorus through a megaphone, weird ass beat, sounded like a man dry heaved at some point, what the hell is this song

**akanewasright** (4): This *feels* its length

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Genius says that Bowie said later on that he didn’t like this song’s “ungainly gait.” Yeah I think I agree.

**MassiveThief** (4): gets kinda repetitive.

**pig-serpent** (3.5): This song feels limp to me, but it ends with some pretty sick noodling so I can't hate it.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): ive always hated this song but didnt know what song it was thats wild

**Nagisoid** (2): My tears ricocheted when I heard the "ricochet, it's not the end of the world" part, it unironically sounds stolen from some forgotten cheesy sitcom.

**oscarbrierley1** (0): waiting for it to do anything... so boring

**apatel27** (9): Is it bad calypso? Yeah. Is it a bit culturally tone deaf? Sure. But it’s funny and that makes it good! (also known as It’s Camp!) The instrumental is fun and Annie brings the energy only a white woman dancing to calypso can

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): The tropical beat here is just fun. I am just always a sucker for some good horns in a song too.

---

**flava** (10): it’s so bad, it’s so openly and flagrantly bad, they know they can’t make it work and still did it anyways which is the kind of boldness that we don’t get enough of nowadays

**Stryxen** (9.9): the rumors are true… it’s camp

**AHSWeeknd** (9): that sax in the end does what needs to be done

**celladonn** (9): this is way more joyful than i usually expect a eurythmics song to be, it's fun!!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the shimmering synth is giving now I don’t hate California after all and I’m here for it

**MassiveThief** (9): trop-pop pioneers!

**nt96** (9): It’s like a mix between Donkey Kong, Reading Rainbow and Rugrats. This is too funny.

**Roxieloxie** (9): this is what superorganism would sound like in the 80s

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): these melodiessss

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): he was a diplomat's sooooon it was eighty ooooone

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): this is the sort of song that comes on the radio when you’ve been trying to find a station that isn’t playing the shittiest music you’ve ever heard, so when you hear a radio station playing this as you try to find the right frequency, you go “meh” and decide to just listen to this instead of taking your chances

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): under the sea! under the sea!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): why does this sound similar to under the sea

**impla77** (7.1): Seems like the start of codependency to me

**phonethephoenix** (7): like the sax at the end

**welcome2thejam** (7): I'm grooving with the most concerned look on my face rn

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I don’t know. I really don’t know. I guess I don’t hate it.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): when depression comes honestly I need a nap and some sugar

**frogaranaman** (6): Cheep Cheep Beach sounds great here!

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I need to be in the strong arms of a man too so go off relatable queen. Why do the yeah yeah yeah’s sound so deflated though? ☠️

**Internal-End-9037** (6): Wasn’t every artist doing some pseudo reggae/Caribbean sounding song at this time. Meh- it’s fine overall compared to other similar songs of the period but by Eurythmics’ standards it is just passable.

**QuaxlyDuck** (6): I'm only familiar with a handful of Eurythmics songs that are all dark and brooding so this song is giving me major mood whiplash. It's not bad, just unexpected.

**slimboyfriend** (6): She really tried to make a song using every preset on her Casio huh

**akanewasright** (5): sludge

**Around-town** (5): It's OK

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I’m gonna make a Freddi Fish AMV

**pig-serpent** (5): Did every new wave band eventually start releasing tropical songs or just these guys and Blondie?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like it would play in a baby sensory video

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Move over Grace Jones, there's a new island queen in town! (this is a joke please don't cancel me)

**oscarbrierley1** (4): so boring, i was waiting for it to be over almost immediately.

**sarcasticsobs** (4): No <3 ty

**moonshxne** (3): simultaneously kind of get the song's good vibes AND find it rough to listen to...the duality

**qazz23** (3): don't like the sound of this - the lyrics and horns feel a bit cheezy

**DaHumanTorch** (2): girl what

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1012164798147997726/1084631446989312040/adele-instagram.png

**Nagisoid** (0): A calypso track is so out of place here in an album where all the other songs are synthpop. Sadly, the song by itself is pretty bad so this was just begging for a 0. Also, white british people doing calypso. Ew.

**vayyiqra** (0): Nobody wanted or needed to hear "Eurythmics attempt calypso". It just has no reason to exist. Sorry to these two,, but this is an utter mess. Not even namedropping "depression" can make me like it! (It worked with "Anti-Hero" for comparison.) To quote myself from two days ago "yeah this [...] this sucks".

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (0): Irrational hate 0 rewarded to truly one of the most novel innovations in shite pop, a genre of pop where you take a giant shit and see what sticks. Results often end up as an omnibus monster that should prolly soundtrack an AIP teen flick at best or hogshite nonsense the other 99% of the time. not really sure what the gang was doing here, taking horrid sounding drum machines alongside a tropical vibe and mending it to the worst goddamn self-help lyrics (and mouth noises) imaginable; the kind of shit meghan trainor (mother!) should take notes from--it'd improve her game imaginably. Oh and then there's the fucking whistle! I don't usually feel so offended by whistles, as an industrialist and all, but good christ this one needs a muzzle. Right here was when I had a good feeling "this album is gonna suck" and oh boy, Eurythmics y'all know how to do it! This is landfill shit that should be buried and eradicated from existence. Cuts like this are why we don't talk about Eurythmics in the same breath as the other 3 artists in the rate

**static\_int\_husp** (7): I don’t think anything about this really stands out as bad. The bass line in this is definitely pretty interesting, but otherwise a lot of the rest of the song feels fairly generic for the time

**apatel27** (5): The album cuts on this truly are songs. There’s nothing to grab your attention and it shows in the placement

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m glad the beat got to shine in the outro, it’s honestly genius

**oscarbrierley1** (7): weird vocals, but kinda fun

**phonethephoenix** (7): nice but nothing to write home about

**impla77** (6.3): This is a mid tempo mid tier David Bowie song!

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Usher and Mariah outsold

**ImADudeDuh** (6): bitches say “i’m fine” and then they name their song without you

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): there’s no smoke without fire but there is also no fire bowie cmon

**CrimsonROSET** (5): so far this rate has been anything but forgettable, but i think this one kinda just exists

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): filler

**slimboyfriend** (5): quintessential 80s Bowie filler

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (4.9): :)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): this is a hot take maybe, but bowie’s voice has always been pretty hit or miss for me. on some songs he sounds amazing, but other times his voice sounds so offputting that it ruins my enjoyment of the whole song, and this song is very firmly in the second category for me

**welcome2thejam** (4): This was just flat

**moonshxne** (3.5): please stop the crooning thx

**Nagisoid** (3): Go Bowie give us nothing!

**qazz23** (3): nothing special about this one. just drags along without any peak

**apatel27** (10): Undeservedly tanked idc. This is Dave Stewart taking full control and just making a 7 min banger. There’s very little Annie input here outside the 13 repeated lines of lyrics but that doesn’t take away from the song in any way.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): The horns and synth line in this are very good. The bass solo is also incredibly good. The singing is unfortunately a bit monotone though, which could be improved. And if you’re going to try to get me to listen to this for 7 minutes, the singing should probably catch my attention more.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): sis said “let’s gossip”

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this gave birth to roisin murphy's first two solo albums

**Internal-End-9037** (10): Seven and a half minutes of brooding synth and vocals. Album highlight for sure.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): everyone trying to guess the [REDACTED] Ratrick game

**Nagisoid** (9): LCD Soundsystem found poor and friendless

**nt96** (9): this beat hits hard and I love the subtle Arabic tone.

**seanderlust** (9): good but also ruined when i realized that "it's a secret" has roughly the same cadence/tone as "Taste the biscuit"

**flava** (8): in another world this would be made by a progressive metal band for an album about time travel while philosophically debating if computers can feel emotion

**Frajer** (8): the synths are summoning a robot

**Stryxen** (8): they !

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ok come through 100 gecs

**vayyiqra** (8): This specific kind of bleepbloop always makes me nostalgic for growing up around my dad's records and Commodore computers and vintage synths so that rules! I get that this is long and will most likely bomb but I like it anyway.

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): the way it turns into mr. krabs robotic music 6 minutes in ouuuu

**akanewasright** (7.5): oh that intro reminded me of “checkin up on me” by Roisin Murphy… I’ll construe that to talk how influential Annie Lennox is, even if I’m not wild about this album

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i thought she was saying "paint a roomba" for the first like four minutes til i looked up at the title i just thought she was really ahead of her time

**MassiveThief** (7.5): I dig the spooky vibes.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): i like the beep boops

**slimboyfriend** (7.4): I love this spooky unsettling version of the Eurythmics over the version of them that likes sound effects

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): despite long song phobia, this is pretty good

**phonethephoenix** (7): bass and trumpets :)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Omg beep boo boo bop boo boo beep bestie!!

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I feel like this had more potential

**ImADudeDuh** (6): [TW: British spelling]

**qazz23** (6): the synth and horns save this one

**welcome2thejam** (6): There's little moments that are nice, like the funky bassline appearance, or some of the neater synth chirps, but its just not a strong song overall

**RandomHypnotica** (5.7): shhhh

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (5.5): too long and too committed to a one note sound that'd be laughed out of the Warehouse. oh wait there's a horn now. oh wait it went ahead. good god shoulda just got fucking cosey fanny tutti to do the horns for this album that'd raise us a few points.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): some cool ideas here but it drags out too much

**moonshxne** (5): decent hooks, why did the background adlibs and Annie's whispers sound so grating

**sarcasticsobs** (5): Sure. Glad this is over.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3.5): See I was filling out the ballot and thinking my Eurythmics average would actually be pretty good…and then the last three songs happened.

**pig-serpent** (3): There's a reason this song closes out the album.

**impla77** (2): Background music could be for a mario kart desert track set in space

**oscarbrierley1** (2): this song has no business being this long. it just drags on repeating the same stuff that we have already heard.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): i’m sorry this is the opposite of anything I enjoy, it goes on for way too long without adding much new and without lyrics I can grasp onto or think about. It’s the musical version of watching the PAINT PAINT PAINT PAINT dry.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Overall, I do like the funky beat this has, which shows that Nile Rodgers can do no wrong musically. The singing, on the other hand, feels a little forced during the verses. Fun Fact: one of the people who does backing vocals on this is also the Kool Aid Man

**apatel27** (5): A lot of people have noted the similarity between this and Let’s Dance and it really is the inferior version. It never gets going and the instrumental seems stunted for some reason. It feels like it’s missing every last beat and that really sticks out.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the Prince influence here is strong

**Awkward\_King** (10): i shake it i shake it i shake it ooh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Metro Station did outsell but this is still really good.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): you don’t even have to ask sir

**nt96** (9): it may feel like a second rate Let’s Dance but it still bops

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): "SHAKE IT SHAKE IT WHAT'S MY LIIIIINE" has been stuck in my head for weeks please help

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): bops but its kind of weird way to close the album

**sarcasticsobs** (8.3): I AM shakin' it!!!

**Stryxen** (8): this is something i’d dance for / ttylxox

**vayyiqra** (8): An underwhelming song as a closer but it does bop.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.6): this is one of those songs i have to be in the mood for but it's groovy fun

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended fadlor

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this feels like Let’s Dance 2.0 and I’m only like 10s in

**plastichaxan** (7.5): You'll never be Charli XCX

**CrimsonROSET** (7): weird album ending but i mean i’m shaking so

**phonethephoenix** (7): if i say i resisted making a metro station joke that's still a metro station joke

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): There’s like thirty seconds in here that I like which is more than some of the other songs in the rate got

**shipperondeck** (6.5): a song

**TiltControls** (6.5): metro station still winning

**impla77** (6): This is the epitome of a mid level David Bowie song

**Internal-End-9037** (6): Let’s face it this song is a repeat of Let’s Dance, pretty much beat for beat in many places. Could totally do a mash up of the two.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): whats with the bee gees impersonators as the backing vocals

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): this song lowkey sounds like what Harry Styles was going for on Harry’s House. The quirked up white boy could not outdo the ultimate quirked up white boy

**moonshxne** (4): at least it's not immediately forgettable, but bleh

**Nagisoid** (4): Then you get it, get it, get it, hit it, hit it, hit it, flip it, flip it, flip it...

**qazz23** (4): just seems like a lesser version of the title track

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (4): dodgy talking heads type-poppy-post-punk nonsense. white boy funk never felt so sweaty and effortful. doing the trump ymca dance to this and running out of breath. wow

**welcome2thejam** (4): Saying "Metro Station outsold" to a David Bowie song feels legitimately illegal and yet

**pig-serpent** (3): A surprisingly sexless and unshakey song given the artist in question.

**babadork** (0): I forgot this song existed.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): we have Let’s Dance at home

**apatel27** (9): This ended up being divisive but not for the lyrics or Prince’s mannerisms on the song, a lot of people really hated the lofi nature of the song. Personally, that adds to the song but it does have a ‘recorded in the next room’ sort of sound and popheads really dislike that.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): I think this is the weirdest song on this album. Sonically, the rest of the album is more upbeat, and even compared to the title track this is… dark and weird.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I would say “ahead of his time” but America never changed

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I’m usually VERY basic but yeah idk I really like this little spoken word number!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): god forbid a woman do anything

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i gave those two dipshit art school type Talking Heads songs 10s, this is my brand I fear. Let popheads rate Laurie Anderson so I can really get crazy w/it!!!

**Internal-End-9037** (10): The strangest track on the album. Straight up new romantic/electro in the vein of Kraftwerk or The Flying Lizards. Sticks out on the album but is so out there from his classic sound that it wins for me.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is so me but what’s it actually about

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): dude is using the end of his album to get right to the most insane lo-fi funk. absolutely whippeting its way into the future but sonically so dense that feels like it's culling from farther back. this entire album is sharp, but the quality on this one in its bleeps and arpeggio backflip bells and whistles startles me; it could be a Suicide ditty in its story, as much as Paramount 78 rpm at its core with that "i live my life in taxi cabs" refrain. But its signature prince, with its callouts and straight fact spitting amongst that cyberfunk tech. such a beguiling, sublime nugget. a top 5 of the rate writ large.

**xophrys** (10): banger

**moonshxne** (9.5): ...on a completely unrelated note, really nice production

**nt96** (9.5): Annie are you okay?

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): oh i get it like anti-christian that's funny

**akanewasright** (9): now the Annie Christian described in verse 1 is straight up evil, but like… if I can pretend they’re separate entities, I would give verse 2 Annie a gun

**phonethephoenix** (9): sick synths and guitar!

**vayyiqra** (9): The lyrics are kind of a madlibs of random political topics of the time, but I like the chutzpah and his willingness to put that over a kind of weird and offputting track.

**shipperondeck** (8.8): it took me wayyyy too long to understand what "annie christ" meant

**Roxieloxie** (8.6): [foolishly said this 2 songs ago, i was wrong](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1071592087214112849/1086518905520013332/Screen_Shot_2023-03-18_at_1.18.08_AM.png) If you asked me to guess a topic to be covered on this album I would've never said the Atlanta child murders. Kinda glad I had already heard jack u off before the album  because my god i did not process anything once this song ended

**babadork** (8.3): It’s a little broad. I don’t see the connection between the stuff he brings up, except for the antichrist, and I’m not really here for Jesus-y Prince.

**Nagisoid** (8): Now everytime I hear someone say "electric chair" as a joke I think of this very serious song. Thanks Prince.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): they hate to see a girlboss winning

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): I wish she had hit Reagan

**ignitethephoenix** (7): we all have one flop song

**sarcasticsobs** (6.1): Eh. Guitar good

**qazz23** (6): some good 🎸 lines but don't really care for this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I get what he's saying, but I also DON'T get what he's saying

**celladonn** (5.5): what a strange song

**1998tweety** (5): erm

**Around-town** (5): Is Annie christian a real person that I don't know about?

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this song sounds good but the lyrics are just… huh! Controversy alright!

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the genius comments said this was a play on “anti-christ” but it’s low:key: more fitting to me if you think of it as “any christian”. Anyways, Annie Christian is a good drag name

**pig-serpent** (5): There's a lot of interesting things going on here but overall I can't jive with this one. That's what the kids are saying, right?

**slimboyfriend** (5): not this bad spoken word reading...

**DaHumanTorch** (4): everybody say gun control!

**seanderlust** (4): man that girl from community was wilding

**TiltControls** (4): something about the production + vocal direction isn't really hitting for me. technically my lowest score of the rate but the albums are solid enough that it's not close to 0 territory

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): oh this is antichrist pun bc if so i just got it (there’s 37 seconds of the song left)

**MassiveThief** (3.5): just not a fan of the vocals. also ANNIE CHRISTIAN WAS A WHORE takes me out every single time

**oscarbrierley1** (3): it sounds like a demo, so unpolished and not in a fun way.

**Awkward\_King** (2): the pointer sisters in or out of their annie christian underwear

**DirtyRat583** (2): is this a demo? not good

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): I can never really understand what Prince is saying but I heard him yell “gun control” at one point so I looked up the lyrics to this song to see if it had any sort of deeper message... results were inconclusive.

**IIIHenryIII** (0): the black sheep of the album

**lexiaredery** (0): Just unpleasant to listen to

**apatel27** (10): This should not have been day 1!!! The repeated Feel Up serves a purpose in the song and i’m sorry if you are unable to see that but you’re wrong for saying it’s bad!

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): The one big complaint I have about this song is that it feels extremely simple and repetitive. Compared to other songs in this rate, it’s a cut below a lot of them.

---

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): this was not my plan to 11 going out but it’s the song in the whole rate that makes me happiest? Maybe the Jamaican patois interlude makes me homesick and comfy

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Grace Jones invented hyper pop

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is the best song ever like...

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool (Binaural-ly)

**seanderlust** (10): feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee lup. feel up.

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): this one has big gay sailor vibes. like i feel like im lucille bluth at the end of season 3 of arrested development asking "if those hot seamen can shovel coal" [those poor sods didn't know what she meant]

**qazz23** (9): a good dance pop and dub mix, a bit repetitive though

**Stryxen** (9): quite simple but this is really just making me smile

**moonshxne** (8.5): A feel-good song if I've ever heard one! 😄

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This kinda doesn’t go anywhere but I like it! Sometimes a song that just hangs around for a while and then leaves is nice.

**Nagisoid** (8): Freak out!

**DirtyRat583** (7.8): feeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee

**phonethephoenix** (7.7): a nice song!

**1998tweety** (7.5): what I would like Sett to do to me

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): what long lost N64 game is this instrumental from

**CrimsonROSET** (7): all songs get better with a little cowbell

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): omg doggos

**ImADudeDuh** (6): legend of zelda overworld ass production

**vayyiqra** (6): fun

**welcome2thejam** (6): Help is the lyric really "your dreams aren't real" what does that mean

**shipperondeck** (5.5): this is not a miss this song just personally makes me nervous

**Internal-End-9037** (5): Jone’s third writing credit on the album. And the weakest track in the lot. It has the most straight reggae vibe, which sticks out from the other more sensual and sexual tracks on the album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): As someone who’s tried to record audio in a house with people in it, this is giving me war flashbacks.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): listening to dogs barking is more entertaining than this

**pig-serpent** (4): This song starts off strong but it's just the same thing over and over again and I'm bored well before the end of the song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i feel like i just listened to a 10 second loop for 4 minutes

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): not the song with the most poorly aged lyrics in the rate but after you catch THAT it just kinda ruins it forever
