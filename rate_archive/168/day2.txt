**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song is so fun. It’s hard driving, the beat is great, and I love the way they chant “how could she fall for a boy like that?” Probably my favorite Eurythmics song in the rate, it’s a shame this is out so soon.

**apatel27** (8.5): 80s Synthpop in its purest

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an anthem for celebrity stylists

**Awkward\_King** (10): we put 100 eighties synthwave songs into an algorithm and this is what it spat out - and it eats!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): You’ve heard of Cool Blue, now get ready for…Cringe Green!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I actually do a lot of listening for rates in the mornings on my days off and I know a song is good when I abandon cooking my eggs to just kind of do a gay strut around the room trying to lip sync to a song I’ve never heard before.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): where my fellow blue eyes at

**seanderlust** (10): we say this a lot but the bridge is literally one of the most camp thing i've ever heard

**Internal-End-9037** (9.5): The Eurythmics albums cuts are sometimes stellar and sometimes even more banging than the hit singles. This is band where deep cuts are delicious.

**nt96** (9): I’m suddenly on the set of Sweatin to the Oldies with Richard Simmons.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): “how could she fall for a boy like that?”(x4) this is so pete davidson coded

**DirtyRat583** (7.9): thank god its catchy because i dont really like the vocals

**phonethephoenix** (7.8): very good, if not a tad longer than it needs to be

**Stryxen** (7.5): the ascending pitch vocals in the bridge put a big smile on my face

**akanewasright** (7): This had a cool idea or two I’ll give it some credit

**CrimsonROSET** (7): maybe he was the leader of the pack idk

**Nagisoid** (7): Never gonna give you up, never gonna let you down, never gonna run around and desert you

**vayyiqra** (7): Being sweet now because on a track like this you can see the vision at least of Eurythmics trying to sound like "the Police meets Devo" (?! may be insane take please ignore) but some parts the vocals are just annoying (namely the bridge) which is too bad because Annie Lennox has a nice voice! What is this?

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): the worst gatorade flavor

**qazz23** (6.5): sry Eiffel 65's Blue is better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): no because why does literally every song on this album sound like a garageband demo

**pig-serpent** (6): The bass rules here.

**slimboyfriend** (6): don’t do helium

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It's moderately cool

**frogaranaman** (5): sorry I had a real comment for this then I walked into this train and it smelled like someone ripped ass so I lost my train of thought

**MassiveThief** (5): some cool ideas but felt way too long

**sarcasticsobs** (5): Finally, back to something listenable. Nevermind, it got annoying again

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (4.9): Right here is the FIRST cut on the album that calls back the specific genre of pop Sweet Dreams excelled at: dodgy second-rate imitations of Grace Jones. Wow! My fav! I guess im supposed to be doing dishes or planking/working on cardio listening to it. No it's not bad (she says "here it comes again" which helps me with my push-ups) white girl funk, but when Nightclubbing is in the rate, you can damn well tell an imitation factor is at play in Eurhythmics sonic stylings. It's almost like this album was curated and slotted here for listeners to naturally come to that determination.

**moonshxne** (4.2): How could you fall for a boy like that? is such a mood, but are the vocals there processed to just completely take me out of the song?

**apatel27** (8): A more relaxed closer to the album this really encapsulates what’s so good about Grace Jones. After an album full of more upbeat songs, this one really lets her voice shine and boy does it shine. It’s a slow and steady tune that works wonderfully.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This feels like an interesting song. The lyrics are interesting and make her out to be a woman of many experiences. I would think that this would build up to something more musically, but it doesn’t really.

---

**frogaranaman** (11): simply stunning

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): An interesting choice for a closer! But I always like when an otherwise upbeat album ends on a more introspective note- the lyrics are a bit ??? but the vague sense of melancholy is delicious. The part towards the middle of the song where she raises her voice and starts to SING is one of my favorite moments in the entire rate.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Grace Jones the voice that you are ❤️

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): we need a good comedown track. and this one hits in spades.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): this is how you do a gorgeous chill album ending

**1998tweety** (9): me when I procrastinated for weeks and successfully finish the night before its due

**nt96** (9): play Did It Again by Kylie as the interlude!

**phonethephoenix** (9): feels like end of a noir movie or something! super good closer

**impla77** (8.7): I believe you queen

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): grace not the slur…

**TiltControls** (8.5): make a good song? cause yes

**Nagisoid** (8): Oops, Grace did it again!

**oscarbrierley1** (8): this probably won't be popular, but i love the quiet storm, slow jam vibe.

**qazz23** (8): good closer, has a trip-hop feel to it

**welcome2thejam** (8): Grace Jones 🤝 LCD Soundsystem: I was thereeeee

**DirtyRat583** (7.6): most of the cultural references dont translate for me but luckily the slay does

**Stryxen** (7): nice and sweet. Good melodies and her lovely vocals sell it- she’s done it again haha

**vayyiqra** (7): Nice ballad! Will ignore some of these lyrics! Love the jazzy touches on the drums.

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): hello why does she sound so different here

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): airport lounge core

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): What I expected: Wow a rate of white and black artists truly this will be a showcase of musical and cultural diversity! What I got: casual racism against Asians and Latinos

**Awkward\_King** (5): grace jones when she makes the best song ever:

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I don’t think Grace Jones was voting for Roosevelt in 1933…

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): britney spears when she plays with your heart

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): unfortunate slur sigh

**IIIHenryIII** (3): what kind of nightclub plays this?

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i’m sorry, she’s overseen WHO for good Californian wine????

**seanderlust** (0): not the slur...grace how are you going to have the most racist song in a rate where a white dude sings a song called "china girl"

**apatel27** (9): This might be an overdramatic song but it’s what's needed for Eurythmics. Annie Lennox crooning over a synth line  is the tried and true formula for a reason

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Sorry this is just kinda slow and boring to me. It could be better if the instrumental was a bit less sparse.

---

**impla77** (11): I realise more and more that my music taste is morphing into my dads.. I remember him searching this up on youtube to show me for some reason.

**TiltControls** (11): a question scientists are still trying to figure out to this day

**xophrys** (11): sentimental nostalgia bullshit dadcore

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Annie Lennox did these sorts of ballads so well.

**celladonn** (10): god her voice sounds so fucking good here

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is just Gen X’s Cher Lloyd - Want U Back

**mysario** (10): it's Jess!

**shipperondeck** (10): the tension!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): this video really was the Bad Blood of early 1980's british pop music

**Frajer** (9): what are the odds that Annie, Madonna, and Eve would all have songs called Who's That Girl

**phonethephoenix** (9): great vocals on the hook and I love the synths

**1998tweety** (8.5): That's Beyoncé

**moonshxne** (8.4): 😔

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): ended madonna

**nt96** (8): Eve’s that girl

**oscarbrierley1** (8): basically a sweet dreams rehash, but its a synth pop bop so i have no choice but to stan.

**pig-serpent** (8): I can't decide if this song sounds like it was made by robots or puppets. Surely it wasn't both, that wouldn't make sense.

**sarcasticsobs** (8): Thankq goodness, a good song again

**vayyiqra** (8): The snare here is making my eyes water a bit but it's pretty good. Definitely an influence on chillwave [citation needed]

**welcome2thejam** (8): Love when its gets all stabby near the end, tbh its the bite this album is needing

**plastichaxan** (7.5): RuPaul in that one interview telling his favorite Rihanna song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): popheads when i showed up to do my first rate

**CrimsonROSET** (7): EVE’S THAT GIRL

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It's like "Sweet Dreams" but even more depressing

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): (she ain’t me)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.1): guy sebastian outsold

**frogaranaman** (6): ugh even in an androgynous rate we gotta deal w gender 🙄

**Nagisoid** (6): Did anyone say camp classic?

**seanderlust** (6): IT'S PIKACHU!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the fenty girl outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): omg just tell her who she is already so she can stop singing this song

**Stryxen** (4): not good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): certainly not E-V-E

**qazz23** (3): Madonna outsold (original comment lololol)

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (3): I'm in an ad for swiffers or synth patches at guitar center i think? the cheap copy-of-a-copy vibe on the northern soul indebted synths, the worthless slow balladry of the vocals and lyrics; we're DEAD in the water here on track 5 in some deeply forgettable chaff that's trying to capture a whiff of the rush of Sweet Dreams. who is coming to this song saying "yeah i wanna sound like THIS!" today? no one. oh hell yeah we even got that "is my walkman fucking up the tape" solo at the end! this sucks!

**Awkward\_King** (2): girl im kinda bored at this point shake a little ass maybe

**static\_int\_husp** (6): I feel like this is just kinda boring tbh. Bowie’s voice is so quiet and monotone in the mix, and it otherwise sounds like a lot of the other rock of the time. Not a lot stands out.

**apatel27** (5.5): Metro outsold sorry Bowie

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): there was crack laced in this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): love a sliding bass

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this right here is top 5 material

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this was on when i somehow won the ratrick counting game so i am giving it all the credit

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): where are the boys that look like girls exactly? asking for a friend….

**oscarbrierley1** (9): starts off slow, but pops off once the beat comes in.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): criminal world OUT criminal minds seasons 3 - 7 IN

**Internal-End-9037** (8.5): In line with the China Girl vibe. Solid.

**frogaranaman** (8): the US govt in six months looking at this subreddit

**vayyiqra** (8): Another great example of how the B-side of this album is quite directionless and a bunch of random songs Bowie threw together, but is still "pretty alright".

**qazz23** (7.5): definitely some good 🎸 playing here

**Stryxen** (7.5): a world where everyone is flava’s music takes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i liked this song a lot more before i learned that a) its a cover and b) he changed the lyrics so that he wouldnt sound gay singing it. my brother in christ you’re david fucking bowie suck it up for 5 minutes and gay it up

**ImADudeDuh** (7): me playing Toontown Rewritten (not affiliated with disney)

**phonethephoenix** (7): solid song!

**pig-serpent** (7): That bass riff is sick, and even though it's subdued it hits the slickness that it was aiming for.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Funky

**welcome2thejam** (7): All my points are for the instrumentals I have no idea what's going on lyrically

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): siding eyeing these lyrics

**sarcasticsobs** (6.2): Sigh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): david bowie in criminal minds

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (6): yeah that's a song

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): sat through this whole song waiting for something to happen

**Nagisoid** (4): Cause I'm feeling like a criminal for giving these scores to Bowie, but the material isn't giving

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This is really fun. Love some of the more “out there” musical choices and it’s also just really well sung. Near the top of the album for me.

**apatel27** (8): The irony of this being the second last cut for Eurythmics. One of the more solid deep cuts of Touch, this pulls a lot more from the funk scene (making it more reminiscent of Nightclubbing & Controversy) compared to the other tracks on this album

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): honestly this could be the perfect aerobics song

**Past\_Opportunity7344** (10): Let's hope this will not be cut first

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): fashionably late guitar parts are very much welcome at this point in this album. slay

**welcome2thejam** (10): Makes me wanna pull my giant David Byrne jacket out of the closet

**qazz23** (9): this has a bouncy post-punk feel to it

**Nagisoid** (8): Funky deep cut

**nt96** (8): me when people ask which Blade Runner release was the worst.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I can tell they're going for some stereotypical kung-fu thing but thankfully it's still a bop and not too problematic (unlike some OTHER songs in this rate…)

**impla77** (7.8): ..is the deepest?

**akanewasright** (7.5): it would be so silly if this was first out… like just for the title alone… too bad it’s actually decent

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This is mostly slay but they maybe needed one more cut to just take a little bit off the end of this one.

**seanderlust** (7.5): hello george!!!

**babadork** (7.1): I can’t decide if this is maybe a little boring.

**flava** (7): this is play that funky music white boy but for white girls

**ignitethephoenix** (7): an anthem for the white girlies?

**pig-serpent** (7): -sins kissing in the yard.

**sarcasticsobs** (7): C'est fun enough

**Stryxen** (7): will probably also be a midnights song here

**TiltControls** (7): it's not the deepest track here

**vayyiqra** (7): hey this isn't Cat Stevens

**moonshxne** (6.7): cute white girl music!

**phonethephoenix** (6.5): it's cool

**CrimsonROSET** (6): go white girl go white girl go

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): we want—not Sheryl Crow!—but the PP Arnold original First Cut is the Deepest https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ujeUrXWJXBY

**frogaranaman** (6): all of my gym bro friends this time of year

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): a title that belongs to a Prince song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): taylor swift when she starts counting how many cuts it took to kill her

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (5): this is a really frustrating one. Eurhythmics don't have the funk chops or the actual wherewithal to sell this, especially when they keep resorting to those chintzy patches and uber cornball bass notes amongst a bunch of rando "ah!" noises. it's a dodgy 99 records wannabe alongside another case of almost great next level mid for the gym that can't go hard enough. if i want to hear this done better I'll go and get that liquid liquid comp or my ESG cd, THAT'S what you spin at the club!

**Awkward\_King** (4): now why did i zone back in to annie singing "im a white girl"

**IIIHenryIII** (4): switch cut for cunt and you have a banger

**ImADudeDuh** (4): what the hell is going on

**apatel27** (10): The delivery on this is just 👌 It’s a slow build and that’s my bread and butter for a great song. The song slowly adds more and more instrumental layers that bring the song to a new level every single time.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): This song definitely pulls off a “slow and mysterious” vibe quite well, but I’m not entirely sure it’s the best fit for this album.

---

**Internal-End-9037** (11): A cover song co-written two other fellows tied to our list Bowie and Iggy Pop. Iggy’s version is more hedonistic. Grace’s version is more sensual and has WAY more foreplay for play going on. It’s a make out session in the club bathroom sink not oral sex on the toilet.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Bowie and Iggy could’ve easily added a golf club reference here

**nt96** (10): guiro goes so hard, it’s sexy

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): It's just so fucken big on a hi-fi. it's dubbed out thrusting pop! we all trying to nightclorbing. bowie and iggy did us good here but chris and grace took us to the next level

**shipperondeck** (9.3): not really a song you'd expect for nightclubbing maybe but it's so cool

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): what a vibe

**slimboyfriend** (9): third best Bowie song in the rate

**seanderlust** (8.5): this and shopping by the pet shop boys...i just need an 80s banger named "Brunch" "Music Listening" and "Pretending To Enjoy Hiking" and i will have bops for all my favorite hobbies.

**impla77** (8): Funnily enough, this was cowritten by David Bowie… I guess its one of his best songs in the rate :)

**Nagisoid** (8): Bowie co-wrote this and it's better than most of his album tracks, because of course it is.

**phonethephoenix** (8): cool!

**qazz23** (8): another good cover, the dub sound really stands out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): shes just so effortlessly cool

**vayyiqra** (8): RYM descriptor: "nocturnal" had better be there. Update: it's the first descriptor for the album. Good.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): She took the song literally called "Nightclubbing" and made it the least danceable song on the whole record, icon behavior

**1998tweety** (7.5): cant relate

**Around-town** (7): It's good. I enjoyed the left-right piano background. Sorry for the vague description, I'm new to music and don't know how to describe it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Well…it’s the third best title track in the rate, coming out on top of “Touch” by virtue of actually existing.

**frogaranaman** (7): so true

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): music to sneak through an art gallery to

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’ve never been nightclubbing but this makes it sound like a bummer

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): this is pretty dull I fear for a song called nightclubbing

**ImADudeDuh** (5.5): ok this really needs a nightcore/tiktok sped up audio version

**CrimsonROSET** (5): do they just go from side to side

**Stryxen** (5): i don’t dislike it but it’s quite lethargic and drags a little - i could definitely enjoy this more in a different mood

**welcome2thejam** (5): The bad news is I didn't like this nearly as much as the OG Nightclubbing. The good news is that it still easily beats out Nightclubbing homage and by far my least favorite LCD Soundsystem song Somebody's Calling Me

**IIIHenryIII** (4): there’s no way you can shake your ass to this

**oscarbrierley1** (3): expected more of a dance beat considering the name. spent the whole song waiting for a beat switch.

**pig-serpent** (3): I'm honestly not convinced Grace Jones has ever been to a nightclub.

**Awkward\_King** (2): who clubs in the daytime edit: just put my fucking brain back in and realised it wasny clubbing at night its nightclubbing as a verb im so fucking thick

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): This is overall decent. Very nice clean synth lines, and the vocal delivery is also pretty good. Otherwise, it seems somewhat simple, with not much more standing out.

**apatel27** (6.5): This feels a step below everything else on the album. Mostly the instrumental. Grace Jones delivers as usual but the instrumental seems lacking, especially the beep boops

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): “whisper in my mask” please don’t do this

**Awkward\_King** (10): i wish this is what art groupies listened to

**plastichaxan** (10): Making a song about how you’re literally art to be admired is so cunt

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): im in heaven at the bedroom pop museum and the suicide duo are making their little zany sounds and im thankful.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): grace jones invented parasocial relationships

**frogaranaman** (9): my Tiktok feed trying to convince me to go to art shows instead of the club

**impla77** (9): I mean there was a ghostwriter involved.. so maybe this is still true?

**nt96** (9): oh look it’s another way of calling my pophead besties ❤️

**moonshxne** (7.6): Grace Jones relatable? 😮

**phonethephoenix** (7.5): the concept and lyrics of this song are so cool

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I don’t think I fully understand what these lyrics mean and Genius isn’t helping, but I like those little bleeps and bloops in between the verses!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): is an art groupie one of those hoes that like fiona apple?

**Internal-End-9037** (7): One of three tracks to get a Jone’s writing credit and this is one of the weaker tracks and I suppose, thankfully the shortest track. I do enjoy the pointed lyrics about all those people at the party there just to stand around and be seen but not offering anything to the conversation. So that raises the score for me.

**Nagisoid** (7): That's some Groupie Love right there!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): isnt that just called an art hoe

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I strive for this level of not wanting to be perceived

**IIIHenryIII** (6): “my personal life is a bore” never have I ever felt so seen

**vayyiqra** (6): no thoughts head empty but I like this

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Fun fact: Grace Jones’s actual autobiography is called “I’ll Never Write My Memoirs”

**qazz23** (5): weakest track here but still some good synth lines

**seanderlust** (5): she's just like me (boring personal life, won't write a memoir)

**pig-serpent** (4.5): "My personal life is a bore." Girlie I have bad news about some of your music

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): i really thought the lyric was "touch penis culture" and it was like some allegory to the gay community

**shipperondeck** (3.5): the one miss on the album

**apatel27** (7): Of all the Prince songs this was the one I expected to be controversial and it was! A slow burner of a sex song is always gonna put people off but Prince took this to another level with his orgasm and pillowtalk which lasted 3 minutes! The song portion is amazing and Prince’s falsetto really elevates it but that second part? It went on for far too long.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): The first, I don’t know, two thirds of this?, is a pretty good ballad. However, I just really cannot find myself liking the extended outro to this. I do not need to hear this many straight sex noises. I am a lesbian for a reason.

---

**1998tweety** (11): its giving sex

**RandomHypnotica** (11): god prince just knows how to make sex music

**AHSWeeknd** (10): almost out-orgasmed Donna Summer for a second

**babadork** (10): I attempted to write a comment for this song several times before realizing that the guy from Rush Hour is not named Tucker Carlson. My apologies to Chris Tucker.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I feel like I just got impregnated, and I’m a dude

**Internal-End-9037** (10): Excuse me, but I need to get a hotel room. This is what we called a slow JAM.

**Past\_Opportunity7344** (10): Literally sex music

**seanderlust** (10): WHEEEEW those high notes

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): I'll do a slow ballad at track 3 if its mouth dripping apeshit like this. I bet walle and eve have this downloaded to their hard drives.

**frogaranaman** (9): oh his dick was hard writing when this song

**moonshxne** (9): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/907/925/e97.jpg_large

**nt96** (9): I think I’m pregnant

**sarcasticsobs** (9): With my history in rates, this song title scared me, but this absolutely ruled. Oop got to the ending, I take back a point. Dammit Prince, u had a 10 here!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Minus 1 because as sexy as Prince is did we really need to hear three minutes of him nutting

**Stryxen** (8.9): hell yeah

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): virginheads and balladphobia going to combine and tank this but its so gorgeous

**ignitethephoenix** (8): he knows how to do a slow jam! Edit: Naur not him simulating sex the last 2 minutes girl we don’t need your dialogue tacked onto this song 😭

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this literally sounds like it was recorded in a bedroom (complimentary)

**shipperondeck** (8): i miss him

**slimboyfriend** (8): prince could write a sex jam in his sleep

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I’m not bold enough to 10 this unfortunately

**welcome2thejam** (8): Makes me wanna drop my headphones and leave the room quietly so Prince can do his thing

**celladonn** (7.5): some of these noises he's making...

**Nagisoid** (7): Prince said give Baby by Charli XCX your 11s in the Sub Faves rate

**oscarbrierley1** (7): i wanted to love this as a slay ballad, but it kind of loses me at the spoken word part.

**phonethephoenix** (7): it's sexy! it's bold! appreciate that tbh

**qazz23** (7): those notes at the 3 minute mark are orgasmic

**vayyiqra** (7): This just goes on and on eh, seems on-brand for him.

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): thinking about the biggie sex skit that broke all sorts of lowest score records on r/hiphopheads

**DaHumanTorch** (6.3): why did he cum and then get hypothermia

**pig-serpent** (5): Even Prince losing his mind and shrieking like a maniac wasn't enough to set him free from this hour long power ballad.

**TiltControls** (5): A sensual track, but the moaning is taking me out a little

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): horny ass man long ass song

**impla77** (4.5): Okay, so we might not be beating the allegations of popheads tanking sex jams but it can’t be helped in this case

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Prince is weird because he was such a sexy man but then when he’s actually trying to be sexy he just sounds like a whiny dolphin. Please stop screaming sir.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): i know they called it baby making music but did we need a demonstration during the recording

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): sorry i hate sex moans in music it makes me so uncomfortable

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): I’m sorry I’m sorry I swear I’m not a prude…but yeah this was just entirely unpleasant for me to listen to.

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): sent chills down my spine but in a way I didn't like

**apatel27** (8): Short Sweet and Snappy. The political nature of this is pretty juvenile but that’s part of the appeal. It performed a lot better than I expected it so credit where it’s due.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): On one hand, this is camp. On the other hand, you really do not have to hand it to Reagan (or Gorbachev tbqh). This also feels incredibly out of step with the rest of this album, I truly have no idea what Prince was thinking

---

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): …what would happen if you just called Reagan up?

**nt96** (10): well this aged well

**Past\_Opportunity7344** (10): well its still somewhat relevant

**pig-serpent** (10): Wait, does this mean... Prince was secretly a theater kid all along!?!?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): well

**sarcasticsobs** (10): DRUMS DRUMS DRUMS. GUITAR GUITAR GUITAR

**Stryxen** (10): this tetris ass song. vgi why are you on the floor

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): prince shouldve made more punk rock-esque songs like this bc this fucking ROCKS omg

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this goes so hard AND it’s hilarious

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): I think you can have cornball novelty sub-2 minute cuts on your album with lots of gun noises

**flava** (9.5): Ronald Reagen is currently burning in hell but maybe we can reduce his sentence there by one day by inspiring this bop

**AHSWeeknd** (9): why’s this still relevant, we really went back to the 80s

**akanewasright** (9): This having such a smooth transition out of private joy is so disorienting… like he goes from singing to his own cock to going “don’t allow a nuclear apocalypse”

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this just sounds so much fun

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): why did that have a runtime of like 2 seconds

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Ronnie go [redacted] before it’s too late!

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): political BOP also rest in fucking PISS reagan

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): https://i.redd.it/0x1zebqgt1b41.jpg

**impla77** (8): This is such a time capsule and I kinda live for the overpowering gun sounds

**qazz23** (8): this is a bit silly, i like that messy intro and the synths throughout

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): Prince acting as chief negotiator

**welcome2thejam** (8): None of us want to hear me comment on politics just keep movin

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): idk why he made a bop about the Cold War but sure

**seanderlust** (7.8): now why is ronald reagan in this rate

**shipperondeck** (7.5): in hindsight i guess this song is really funny

**Around-town** (7): It's a bop

**Frajer** (7): let's go to the zoo

**IIIHenryIII** (7): since we’re still alive, I guess Ronnie did listen to Prince’s advice

**Nagisoid** (7): Ronnie only wanted war if it's torture, but he can't say Prince didn't warn him

**Roxieloxie** (7): im

**slimboyfriend** (7): you can’t have controversy without politics I guess

**vayyiqra** (7): Prince had a fair point here although surely there was someone better for this task.

**babadork** (6.4): I like the concept of Prince directing a punk inspired song to Ronald Reagan more than I like the song itself.

**Internal-End-9037** (6): Political, almost punk (the short track length is certainly punk). The energy raises it to a middle score. Not as much lyrical prowess as his later social commentaries but Prince can sell just about any song with that energy.

**phonethephoenix** (6): oof!!!!!! hard to rate tbh. i respect it but musically ¯_(ツ)_/¯

**oscarbrierley1** (5): cute but does't do anything

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): “You go to the zoo but can’t feed gorillas” I can't believe Prince prophesied Harambe

**apatel27** (8.5): Unabashedly horny, this reinvention of the Bill Withers song puts a solid reggae twist on the classic which really elevates the song and the synths bring a more dramatic take to the song

**static\_int\_husp** (8): The synth solo in the middle of this is so cool and a fun reference point for some of my own synth experiments. Really carries the song

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a thirst anthem

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): POV - You’re the copy of Breath of the Wild that I bought months ago and did not open until yesterday.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Damn, she said “he only likes me for how good we fuck? Well i sure hope he does”

**impla77** (10): Toxic relationships have never felt so good

**phonethephoenix** (10): literally so cool.

**plastichaxan** (10): She is so right it feels good being used

**qazz23** (10): this is a very good cover, liking the disco sound and 👏

**sarcasticsobs** (10): Cool

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): love dub; love when they layer the chorus and draw it out. it takes like 3 cuts for the album to enter "victory lap" mode it's fucking insane how confident and swaggered the whole affair is. what happened to pop stars actually clutching it. just deeply unfair that any other album in contention would have the vibe set this deep 3 cuts in. i mean, prince does but it takes him longer to get here. I've almost decided to go ahead and launch the saintly 11 over to this cut, because every time i listen to the album I'm so amazed at the confidence of slotting this as track 3. but not today!

**Frajer** (9): a reggae cover of Bill Withers her mind

**nt96** (9): there’s a sex joke to be had here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): aw hell yeah we got some epic alien sounding synths on this one

**1998tweety** (8): me when I see Sett

**celladonn** (8): i love that synth solo

**flava** (8): ok Grace but Miguel has thoroughly laid claim to using this song title Grace

**seanderlust** (8): she really said "i'm hole" and it slaps!

**slimboyfriend** (8): pursue me… kiss me where you bruise me… ooweeOOWEE

**moonshxne** (7.7): Nice, but are we all going to ignore the fact that she "lost the only people who only did amuse [her]"? 😔

**CrimsonROSET** (7): is this the feeling that one breaking bad image is about? GET OUT

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I like it I just wish it were a bit more… substantial? Like the hooks are good but it just comes and goes.

**Nagisoid** (7): My ratrick slot after being neglected for weeks:

**vayyiqra** (7): vibing no thoughts

**welcome2thejam** (7): Perfect use of that clap percussion

**pig-serpent** (6.5): Lounge music for a spaceship waiting room

**IIIHenryIII** (4): no thanks

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Grace Jones, the physical embodiment of sex appeal, took one of the horniest songs mankind has ever dared to create, and somehow, some-fucking-how, managed to completely strip it of all of its horniness and sex appeal

**apatel27** (8): Is it as good as the single? Not at all but treat it as a dance remix of the original and it’s pretty damn good.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): So this song was originally written with Giorgio Morder as the title track of a erotic thriller called “Cat People” (spoilers: the characters are were-cats). Personally, I think that version of the song is slightly better, but this version goes pretty hard too.

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): 80s rock was the best rock ever

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Definitely wins the award for best original song written for a movie about anthropomorphic cats that I’ve heard.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this rips actually

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): play Jason Derulo or Taylor in Cats as an interlude for extra psychic damage

**impla77** (10): It might be taking a long time bc you’re using gasoline, v unsuitable for putting out fires

**Internal-End-9037** (10): Moroder production is killer. Underrated floor filler. An album favorite.

**qazz23** (10): catchy with lots of 🎸! definitely the side B standout 🐱

**Stryxen** (10): =(w)=

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): this movie is so fucking weird, my friend made me watch it after taking an edible

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is bizarre and really doesn't belong on this album but also it's kind of the definition of a "Bowie camp 10". The outro especially is super catchy.

**flava** (9.5): insert furry comment number 5

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): never clocked david as an early supporter of furries

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): Love cats (not the musical)

**frogaranaman** (9): firefighters in the play Cats be like

**IIIHenryIII** (9): aka Taylor Swift, Jennifer Hudson, Jason Derulo, James Corden, Judi Dench, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, Ian McKellen, Francesca Hayward, and Laurie Davidson (Putting Out Asses) (Cat’s Version) (From the Flops)

**nt96** (9): he means furries

**pig-serpent** (9): This song rules, but watching the movie it was for kind of ruins it. David Bowie sadly does not sound like he's about to turn into a sexy panther.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): he went way too hard on this song for a soundtrack for a film that 15 people watched

**Frajer** (8.5): Giorgio Moroder was unstoppable this era

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): rock bop. guitar solo slays.

**phonethephoenix** (8.5): love the guitar!

**seanderlust** (8.5): dontmakeadavidbowiecatboyjokedontmakeadavidbowiecatboyjokedontmakeadavidbowiecatboyjokedontmakeadavidbowiecatboyjokedontm

**ImADudeDuh** (8): why the fuck are you putting out fire with gasoline? Dumbass, that makes the fire worse. Even cats should know this

**MassiveThief** (8): weird title but it bangs so whatever

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): this reminds me of a cat detective novel I read for school where the villain cat was trying to take over the world with cat eugenics

**welcome2thejam** (8): God bless you, furry firefighters of the world. This one's for you

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): oh this guitar was being shredded

**TiltControls** (7.5): taylor swift's publicist in late 2019

**Nagisoid** (7): If only Bowie was there for the CATS Movie soundtrack to replace Taylor...

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Like… nya?

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (6.6): the only thing that's spooky is that the drums are pretty popping off. another song that straight up exists.

**akanewasright** (6.5): This is decent but significantly less exciting than anything promising catgirls should be

**Awkward\_King** (4): word randomiser ass song title

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Spoilers for *Scooby-Doo On Zombie Island*

**moonshxne** (3): why is a rock song called "Cat People (Putting Out Fire)" so utterly forgettable?

**xophrys** (0): scary concept

**apatel27** (10): It’s fun horny Prince at his finest. The synth beats get you moving and Prince’s performance keeps you there. Then the guitar at the end is just the cherry on the cake. It’s a shame this missed Day 3 but it was so close! Only dropping in on the last day

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): Boy this sure is a song where Prince sings about sex. Honestly it’s not bad it’s just that, as a host, it’s hard to come up with a unique comment for each song, especially when so many from one artist touch on the exact same subject matter.

---

**phonethephoenix** (11): fun! cheeky! and a banger

**ImADudeDuh** (10): AMY POEHLER FROM INSIDE OUT???

**qazz23** (10): love the harmonizing and the heavier 🎸 towards the end

**sarcasticsobs** (10): How does he do it? How does he make these sounds?

**WaneAndrogynousToc** (10): again, cuts like this just make it so clear how unfair it is to put this album against eurhythmics and bowie...the synthfunk patches are BOPPING and prince is practically jumping across the hi-fi with every syllable as that bass throbs. he's like the ship in asteroid but jittered up and immune to bullshit. just a mongo flexible finesse this cut! i'm racking up one hitmaker multikill after another

**welcome2thejam** (10): Congrats, you got through nearly three whole minutes of Prince's sex moans, now let's dance!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.4): the guitar at the end... and transitioning into the next song? oh a moment

**AHSWeeknd** (9): the name drop is always iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): he put his whole princussy on this

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): u literally cant sit there and tell me this man was not the f\*g of the century like

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): i really thought this was gonna be a song about a private named joy

**CrimsonROSET** (8): WHAT DID YOU DO TO VALENTINO

**Nagisoid** (8): This song had a higher score until I realized it's about Prince talking to his own dick

**nt96** (8): Ah yes, the three factions of Transformers: Autobots, Decepticons and Orgasmatrons

**vayyiqra** (8): Cute song - "I strangled Valentino" ?? what

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i know he didn't just say orgasmatron

**moonshxne** (7.4): clearly he's singing about his Tamagotchi

**Stryxen** (7): bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A bit of a bop

**IIIHenryIII** (6): is Orgasmatron a pornstar from the Transformers’ universe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds cheesy

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): the main synth line here sounds like the main vocal melody in Who Loves You by the Four Seasons so much that this song kinda sounds like a waste of time

**babadork** (3): I don’t like songs that the singer directs to their penis as though their penis was a separate entity from them.

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): The point at which I realized I would not be enjoying this Prince album more than the last one I heard.
