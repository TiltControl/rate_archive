No

### IBS (I'm Being Sadistic) 

**DirtyRat583** (10): THIS IS HOW WE DO! YEAH

**Stryxen** (10): this is better than any song

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): idc this should've been the original

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): look...if you watched enough tim and eric awesome show great job in middle school, nothing's shocking, everything is art. anyways, that's how you eat a burrito rock on lady you fought valiantly. no i didn't know it was a cover either

**buddhacharm** (8.5): Giving this a score above 0 in an anti-imperialist revolutionary reverse-Warholian way

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8): this sounds like it could be a 21P song im crying

**nt96** (8): this is shitty

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is beautiful but she’ll never be Unshart My Fart

**adeleade** (7): look it sounds good sonically trust me tag janelle monae and she will agree with me

**fkadizzy-1804** (7): This song exists in a realm beyond numerical rating. When I think of all of the events and discoveries - the hours, weeks, nay, years of cumulative human effort - that had to occur for this song and its accompanying video to even come into existence, let alone for me to watch said video on a silly little screen years and miles away - I mean, the invention of the internet alone - and here I am, at this particular point in time and space in the year of our lord 2022, trying to decide on a NUMBER to slap on this scatological fever dream I don’t even know how to describe in words. What a time to be alive.

**2RINITY** (6): I was all prepared to put the entire Uh-Oh Stinky copypasta here, but then I actually heard the song and it was neither funny nor terrible enough to warrant it. +1 for Jasmine Masters, though

**bigbigbee** (6): 52k views 4 years ago

**sufjancaesar** (5): Gets a 5 because it do take nerve

**freav** (4.5): i kinda have to respect the trainwreck that this is, somehow pandora barely singing through the chorus makes the hook more engaging than the original

**xophrys** (4.5): I was threatened to lower my score

**BreeCherie** (4.4): a drag classic unfortunately

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): I can’t pretend that this is good but I’d be lying if I said I didn’t enjoy it on some level…

**MrSwearword** (4): it's better than This Is How We Do...not that that's hard to do, but Pandora...made an effort

**bogo** (3): this predicted katy perry emerging from a toilet and singing to a piece of shit

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): Posting this directly to the RPDR Cringe Sub was such a power move for her

**DefaultPophead** (2): better than katy

### Constipated

**camerinian** (2): was ready to give this an ironic high score for pure bad taste value, but that fucking video

**nbapip** (2): i've managed to go my whole life until now without hearing this

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (2): she posted it to rpdrcringe herself so she gets a bonus point for that

**1998tweety** (1): well we need someone to go home first

**amr** (1): surprisingly the only thing I hate worse than potty humor is genre bending covers of rap songs and this rate has one of those so I am formally apologizing to the lgbt community for not giving this song the 0 it deserves. I promise to reflect and show a better image in 2023

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): This is the evil version of the My Neck, My Back camp 10.

**CrimsonROSET** (1): sometimes homophobia should be encouraged

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): no, no…

**elite4\_beyonce** (1): still better than Manilla

**musical\_pyn** (1): it took me way too long to figure out this was a katy perry parody

**ricki** (1): now that we have this to compare to, is it safe to admit that i really like this is how we do?

**seanderlust** (1): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Oops I Think I Pooped. The humour is extremely subtle, and without a solid grasp of theoretical physics most of the jokes will go over a typical viewer's head. There's also Pandora's nihilistic outlook, which is deftly woven into her characterisation- her personal philosophy draws heavily from Narodnaya Volya literature, for instance. The fans understand this stuff; they have the intellectual capacity to truly appreciate the depths of these jokes, to realise that they're not just funny- they say something deep about LIFE. As a consequence people who dislike Oops I Think I Pooped truly ARE idiots- of course they wouldn't appreciate, for instance, the humour in Pandora's existential catchphrase "let your asshole squeal," which itself is a cryptic reference to Turgenev's Russian epic Fathers and Sons. I'm smirking right now just imagining one of those addlepated simpletons scratching their heads in confusion as Pandora Boxx's genius wit unfolds itself on their television screens. What fools.. how I pity them. 😂 And yes, by the way, i DO have a Pandora Boxx tattoo. And no, you cannot see it. It's for the ladies' eyes only- and even then they have to demonstrate that they're within 2 legendary legends stars of my own (preferably lower) beforehand. Nothin personnel kid 😎

**slimboyfriend** (1): Couldn’t decide between a 1 and a 10 because it’s intentionally camp, which makes it fail at being camp, but that failure is so colossal that it almost makes it camp again? Maybe?

**TheSheakDown** (1): I gave her a bonus point for posting her own music video to rpdrcringe

**uberpigeon** (1): can u change my comment to "lets all poo"

**welcome2thejam** (1): I can never go back to a pre-Oops I Think I Pooped world. The line has been breached, there is no going back

**akanewasright** (0): this is the worst song I’ve ever heard in my life

**BaconShoes** (0): girl what is this…and then all the farts at the end, no.

**BetteDavid** (0): is she okay

**celladonn** (0): some fierce competition for my 0 in this rate but this is truly one of the worst things i've ever heard

**dream\_fighter2018** (0): not only is this incredibly unfunny and gross, but the fact it’s a parody of “This is How We Do” meant that this could be about anything other than poop and it’d still be awful.

**frogaranaman** (0): I did a random number generator ballot and even this song got a 0 from it

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Katy should sue

**ImADudeDuh** (0): NFDVJKADFVN I did not know this was a katy perry parody ☠️ However, the original song is also pretty bad

**impla77** (0): jail to all people involved in the making of this track

**letsallpoo** (0): thinking about her terrible as6 talent show song and that inspiring her to make a kickstarter for her first full length album (and in said kickstarter her saying that she has no experience doing it but she wants to try) and then people actually donating enough money for it to be fulfilled. she hasn't made the album yet but i did check and she still posts updates on the kickstarter so at least she communicates more about her musical career than normani

**plastichaxan** (0): Not even I can find something about this :sob:

**shhhneak** (0): Imagine this being your legacy. Like imagine your pronounced dead and the internet article has “Oops I Think I Pooped singer” in the headline with a homophobic royalty free image. I really feel bad for Pandora Boxx.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): this is genuinely a magnitude more terrible than the next worst song in this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): this person is 50 years old

**thesmokeylife** (0): There is no reason for this song to exist. It’s almost too easy to give this a 0, but I can’t even give it a 1. This is 3 minutes and 25 seconds of my life I will never get back.

**TiltControls** (0): I thought I prepared myself after hearing all the rates channel shit talking about it and then I learned the bar can go even lower than I thought

**vayyiqra** (0): this is not only unfunny but gross and immature and unfunny and a true struggle to get through it

**WaterMagician** (0): I will absolutely defend some of Pandora’s music but I just can’t find anything redeemable about this one in particular

### Is Bart Baker still making Chinese propaganda tiktoks?

**flava** (1): look, she didn’t stoop as low as Bart Baker, but she got pretty close which is still 0 worthy

**GlialUreterostenosis** (0): it's giving Bart Baker

**RandomHypnotica** (0): bart baker energy

**runaway3212** (0): compared to this bart baker is mozart

Chacharinas will always have the last laugh

### The One True Saviour

**adeleade** (11): was debating between zero and eleven but then i realised that it would be way funnier to say that drag money beat a song that people thought was good than to see it with an insanely low score as written by kahanna montresse

### \#FUCKCLOSERSCONTROVERSYRECORD

**1998tweety** (10): CHACHARINAS RISE UP

**amr** (10): only the realest will 11 this

**buddhacharm** (10): You wanna make more money? WEAR. A. WIG. WEAR. A. WIG. **W̴̳̔E̷̐̆Â̸̟R̷̛̒ ̶̽̈́A̷̾͛ ̷̏͝W̵̮̚I̶̅͐G̶̓́.̴͂͠**

**cremeebrulee** (10): she's so untalented i have to support

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m laughing at her not with her. The Farrah Abraham of drag y’all just ain’t ready

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): there was zero effort put into this, and I think the way Serena sounds like she’s reading off a teleprompter makes this nothing short of fucking amazing

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): To be fair, you have to have a very high IQ to understand Drag Money by Serena ChaCha (I have no regrets)

**freav** (10): too iconic to get any other rating

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is unironically better than several #1 hits we’ve had since the start of the pandemic

**jay** (10): bangchan flow

**plastichaxan** (10): I asked a bot to help me choose between a 1 and a 10 for this I can’t wait for its controversy

**ricki** (10): this is definitely a song that someone that reads books would make

**runaway3212** (10): she had 5 dollars, negative awareness of the beat and a dream

**shhhneak** (10): Obsessed with how bored she sounds. She did not want to be in that studio and left after one take.

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I pray that Serena_ChaCharina has something special in store for us when Drag Money takes this crown too

**TiltControls** (10): this is performance art. it has to be

**uberpigeon** (10): rapping about her wig skills while wearing that mathematically unsnatched ponytail takes nerve and courage

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): dat fucking cardi b trap beat is hypnotic but NO she doesn't have flow. however, she has raw "fuck off we'll shit post through this in an alley" energy. doja cat WISHES she could "I showed up to work today" her ass through something like this.

**akanewasright** (9.9): I’m not giving this a 10… but it makes me happier than most of the songs in the rate

**DefaultPophead** (8): Damn how'd Cardi get a feature with Serena???

**soupcereal** (8): Very curious if others will recognize camp or not

**thesmokeylife** (8): I can only judge this on its own merits. And on its own merits, based on whatever it’s trying to do, it’s an 8. Drag Money is its own genre; its own school of art. When the heat death of the universe occurs, Drag Money will be there. Drag Money will outlive us all.

**bigbigbee** (7): I have actively sought this out and listened to it for fun at least once

**nt96** (7): gonna tell my kids this is Cardi B

**sufjancaesar** (5): This is legit the funniest thing to come out of drag race

### \#CLOSEROUT

**2RINITY** (6): Cardi did it better

**apatel27** (4): So disappointing

**GlialUreterostenosis** (4): hey your noise gate is too high

**vayyiqra** (3): this is weird and not enjoyable

**camerinian** (2.5): it's giving "🔥🔥🔥 peep my soundcloud 🔥🔥🔥" linked under a viral tweet

**BaconShoes** (2): Why does it sound like she only could afford the studio for 5 minutes and did this in one take. She can’t stay on beat to save her life

**frogaranaman** (2): I would hear this song on Ziwe

**ignitethephoenix** (2): chacharinas RISE!!! And please sit down again

**nbapip** (2): can't even bring myself to support this ironically

**Pinheadbutglittery** (2): I love memes as much as anyone but fuuuck

**static\_int\_husp** (2): if you're gonna do a parody like this at least make sure you can sing on key

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Cardi I’m so sorry

**WaterMagician** (2): my apologies to the Chacharinas but I really don’t enjoy this

**welcome2thejam** (2): Where'd she get her flow, the Atacama?

**impla77** (1.8): sounds like she had 10 mins to record the vocals

**TheSheakDown** (1.6): I’m sure this will make it a decent way through the rate because annoying gays haven’t got the memo that the ironic-Serena-stanning meme stopped being funny two years ago

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): the fact that this isnt even the worst parody song in the rate is really telling

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (1.2): i don't know whats worse the lyrics or the delivery...

**bogo** (1): it sounds like she's trying to stay off beat on purpose

**CrimsonROSET** (1): except for serena

**elite4\_beyonce** (1): sorry chacharinas

**flava** (1): she raps like she is playing tag against the beat, and the beat is it

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I love king but I cannot understand his fascination with this track

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (1): camp

**RandomHypnotica** (1): do main rap girls

**seanderlust** (1): very drunk twink doing cardi b at karaoke

**xophrys** (1): i can't tell if this was on TikTok

**babadork** (0): This has high school talent show energy and that makes me uncomfortable.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Somehow more of a flop than her appearance on the show.

**BreeCherie** (0): maybe I would get it if I read books

**diamondsandglass** (0): I can't tell if this is trash or ironic art but either way I refuse to listen to it

**kndight23** (0): Wigstress she may be, songstress she is NOT. The lack of energy, repeated moments where she ignores the beat, no attempt at singing, it’s astounding and a gag worthy 3 minutes of confusion and delicious cringe! ChaCharinas RISE🤩

**MrSwearword** (0): mama, this is garbage

**musical\_pyn** (0): how is serena chacha so consistently bad at everything she does

**outofa4paper** (0): but it IS iconic

**slimboyfriend** (0): In any other rate I would say y’all are so mean for including a zero magnet but in this rate there were so many other options that I’m ok with this

**Stryxen** (0): stopppp she sounds like she's about to spit on me with every letter p

Did I ever tell you about the time I found a dead body?

### The New New Wave Rate

**plastichaxan** (10): Replacing Rock Lobster with this in my 11s playlist I don’t think anyone will notice anyway

**seanderlust** (8.5): when are tammie brown and the b-52s collabing

**apatel27** (2): This is what people thought B52s was in the New Wave rate

### Well C'mon Teletubby

**amr** (10): ok sandy cheeks!

**bogo** (10): idc idc idc this is funny as hell

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Joanna Newsom killed this

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I don’t know about you but I certainly feel Clam Happy listening to this! … I hope Clam Happy isn’t an innuendo.

**freav** (10): tammie is the queen of queens and evidently this is iconic. i kinda wish her song "whatever" was here which is genuinely fucking unsettling

**ricki** (10): mother

**thesmokeylife** (10): You can’t really give it any other rating.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): rock on :guitar:

**shhhneak** (9.5): Reminds me of a segment between a human and a puppet on a kids show airing at 1am.

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): Come on Teletubby, teleport us to Mars

**TiltControls** (9): this is exactly what i'd expect from a tammy song

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is like a Pokemon with a branching evolutionary path that will either become The-B52s or Kero Kero Bonito depending on whether you max Attack or Special Attack.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): it's cute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It’s a cute change of pace in this rate!

**Stryxen** (7): ????? Oh just looked at who the artist is that makes sense

**WaterMagician** (6.5): this may not be a great track but it’s absolutely a fun one

**BaconShoes** (6): Just like anything involving the iconic miss Tammie Brown, I have no idea what is going on

**camerinian** (6): me at the 30 second mark: oh this is charming, it's amateurish but I can't hate this it's adorable. Me at the halfway mark: oh my gosh this is so annoyingly twee why are they giving me crystal stall at the fairground. Me at the end of the song: that was genius. A subversive work of outsider art. I can never scrobble this again

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): I don’t quite know wtf to make of this, which makes me suspect I’m simply not on Tammie Brown’s level, but in any case at least it’s not another girl boss hustle queen bitch flex song

**MrSwearword** (5): it's as daffy as a Tammie Brown...anything can be, but stream "In My Blood" as that song serves

**slimboyfriend** (5): um idk

**jay** (4): the blueprint for billie eilish

**akanewasright** (3): huh!

**CrimsonROSET** (3): this song reminds me of that one fish teenager show where the oyster character was obsessed with the nerd

**1998tweety** (2): its not for me

**adeleade** (2): look i just do not get tammie ig and idt i ever will bc i was not even laughing lol sry tammie i respect you

**elite4\_beyonce** (2): love tammie but no

**fadedblue09** (2): Spongebob music on crack

**outofa4paper** (2): but this is camp

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (2): i appreciate the storytelling

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Same vibes as that creepy ass puppet show song

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (1.6): i can tell they had fun w this but it just sounds messy ;-;

**impla77** (1.5): Not the Miss Mandarin slurping noises

**runaway3212** (1.5): intro by kelis tease

### Lady, running down to the riptide

**uberpigeon** (10): the Sometimes of the rate

**welcome2thejam** (8): Indie folk in no way prepared me for this

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why isn’t this on Spotify’s Twee playlist?

**frogaranaman** (3): sounds like a millenial Youtuber ukulele song to subvert expectations

**vayyiqra** (2): ukulele jumpscare + annoying

**cremeebrulee** (1): you’re telling me i can’t escape ukulele violence even in this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): NO!!!! I AM NOT LISTENING TO A UKULELE SONG!!!!

Sadly one of the blueprints for drag music

---

### camp

**plastichaxan** (10): One of many camp 10s in the rate but I hope not many people think the same

**slimboyfriend** (3): Another song that’s bad but…. Is it camp?

**WaterMagician** (3): it’s really not good but it is definitely camp

### she thought she ate that

**BaconShoes** (10): I mean this is iconic and even referenced in other drag songs. The bridge and chorus are so catchy

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): i feel like its not perfect but the nostalgia and vibe just... <3

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Bows! Woes! Expose! Suppose! Indispose!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): nostalgia 10, this is the era of drag race I was watching with my besties it was just such a fun time x

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I feel like this is gonna get dunked on but honestly it’s an important cultural landmark, Manila wasn’t the first queen to drop a song but she was the first to make it an event and a part of her #brand, basically creating the blueprint for everything else in the rate. This is the purest form of RuGirl music, and still one of its finest moments.

**MrSwearword** (10): I seriously considered this for the eleven as well, however, this song does stand as Manila's true triumph. Credit to them for continuing anyway but this is their best.

**freav** (9): this is a banger

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): outsold madonna

**uberpigeon** (8): despite her best efforts this is actually a bop

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8): extremely, potentially painfully, 2011/2012, capturing THAT bloody fecking synth sound that had existed back in rave clubs in the 90s but started having crossover success in the early 10s. it's not Manila's fault she knows what she's gunning for and how to make it land.

**fkadizzy-1804** (7.5): Now I want a drag queen to make a song called Oat Couture where the video just features her rolling around naked in a bowl of oatmeal. Also this song is charmingly refreshingly dated/amateurish enough that I like it wayyyy better than a lot of the hyper-polished trendy tryhard crap heard elsewhere

**2RINITY** (7): It's aight

**vayyiqra** (7): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this is catchy but also not good

**BreeCherie** (6): some of these sounds are actually ok

**TiltControls** (6): is this a good song? no. do i enjoy listening to it? possibly

**fadedblue09** (5): as a Filipino, I always found her name weird. It's like someone naming herself as "Ottawa Ontario"

**runaway3212** (5): this isn't bad!

**welcome2thejam** (5): Appreciate having rep! Makes me wish I liked this more

**impla77** (4.3): I would forgive it for being old.. but Manila put out songs around AS3 and they weren’t good either

**nt96** (4): Not Cousure about this one

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this is like a key of awesome parody of a real song

**Stryxen** (4): stop this nonsense

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): She's always been annoying tbh

**TheSheakDown** (4): The thing about this song is that it’s quite cute the first listen and then immediately becomes unlistenable from there on out

**thesmokeylife** (3.5): The awfulness of this song has become a running joke in the Drag Race fandom. However, it’s surprisingly listenable!

**CrimsonROSET** (3): emphasis on lose- four times

**frogaranaman** (3): they want to be Lady Gaga soooooooo baaaaaaaaad

**ImADudeDuh** (3): one of the funniest things in the drag race fandom is that every other year switches between “Manila is one of the best queens of drag race” and “Manila is overrated as hell, rude af, and can’t sing for shit”

**apatel27** (2.5): Kesha but boring

**jay** (1): nope

**letsallpoo** (1): every time i see manila's drag on drag race i enjoy her. every time i engage with manila's drag off of drag race i do not have a good time

**elite4\_beyonce** (0): no

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (0): she really had no business making music

### problematic things manila has done

**akanewasright** (6): I was gonna give this an ironic 10 until the “Ching Chong” but… good lord. I still have a fond memory of this song but nope I’m not giving this a high score

**DefaultPophead** (3): ching chong??? sorry queen i cant give u pinoy solidarity

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Ma’am you’re not the right kind of Asian to be saying that

**shhhneak** (1): Kill The Cop - John Carpenter

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): girl bye not the racist slur for chinese people i fucking hate it here

### i think there was definitely a reason

**seanderlust** (4): remember when the AAA girls dragged this song out of nowhere for no particular reason

Would you believe me if I told you this was by far the most known song in the rate...

### bottoms

**MrSwearword** (11): this appears to be shady as fuck giving a parody the eleven in RuPopheads Drag Rate but honestly, this ended Alicia Keys before the Jimmy Kimmel performance and Keys album.

**BaconShoes** (10): sloppobottomus queer

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): i listened to this song even before i knew i was gay LMAOOOOOOOO

**cremeebrulee** (10): u know what, why not

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): you just had to be there idk lmao

**DirtyRat583** (10): now THIS is what drag music is supposed to be

**frogaranaman** (10): I READ THE NAME AS WILL.I.AM INITIALLY SO WHEN THIS STARTED I WAS SO SURPRISED LMFAO???????

**jay** (10): it shaped a generation..

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This might be the only song in this whole rate I was even slightly aware of beforehand… truly the anthem of popheads

**WaterMagician** (10): the blueprint and undeniably iconic

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): a beautiful product of its time

**elite4\_beyonce** (9): iconic

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The kids don’t even understand how iconic this was, it’s hard to make a parody song/video that isn’t completely cringe ~~hi Pandora~~ but they did it. Now everybody go listen to [“Fuck Me” by Wendy Ho](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8f0ch4ed_Qw)

**ImADudeDuh** (9): we love camp that I knew before drag race. Also, we love Willam for going the [Beyonce](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7xwwuH_Z3WA) and [Avril Lavigne](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yoQu8udjB9U) route for making a version of her biggest hit accessible [in spanish](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3HAGYeWgkZc)

**plastichaxan** (9): A classic I knew before I even got into drag race like there even is a spanish version

**nt96** (8): her tone seems very pointed right now

**thesmokeylife** (8): It’s a classic for a reason.

**babadork** (7.9): I added a point at the last minute for the En Vogue bit.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): better than the original

### sides

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): problematic?

**runaway3212** (7): what can I say? alicia's slay comes through even in this

**adeleade** (6): sry lol it does not hold up to the nostalgia

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Sure.

**TheSheakDown** (6): When I was like fifteen i tore a muscle dancing to this lmaooo. Was gonna give it a five originally but added another point for the En Vogue interlude.

**sufjancaesar** (5): Sister song to Tyler the Creator’s BOY IS A GUN

**2RINITY** (4): PROTIP: playing this at parties like it's a real song scares the hoes (it's me, I'm the hoes, turn it off)

**camerinian** (4): …Adam Lambert?

**seanderlust** (4): yeah it's crass and immature and stupid as all get out but "he's a jock, at least he wears one on a date" is hilarious

**xophrys** (4): oops I think I pooped is better

**shhhneak** (3.8): I’m not in the market for a Drag Weird Al discography.

**fkadizzy-1804** (3): I love a good parody song but this one just doesn’t do it for me. The fact that I kinda hate Girl is on Fire probably doesn’t help

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): I can’t fully hate this cause the original song does have a great chorus but it’s also too much

**welcome2thejam** (2): Honestly that could've been way worse

**1998tweety** (1): this is either a 1 or a 10 there is no in between

### tops

**akanewasright** (1): I don’t disagree that there are worse parody songs than this… but I think I’d rather shove a hand grenade in my ass than listen again

**apatel27** (1): and what is the difference between this and Bart Baker

**celladonn** (1): hmm

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): AND THIS GIRL IS A TOP!!!! For legal reasons: this is a low hanging fruit joke and does not reflect my actual thoughts or opinions

**fadedblue09** (1): some of these songs feel like a hallucination

**freav** (1): this makes me irrationally mad, at least the poop song is so bad its funny

**impla77** (1): Parody songs are really the worst

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (1): it was never that funny to me and you definitely aren't listening to this for the music itself so...

**RandomHypnotica** (1): ...

**Stryxen** (1): this is so unfunny I'm sorry 💀

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): if you asked me what i thought this song was going to sound like before i pressed play i never in a thousand years would’ve gotten it right

**TiltControls** (1): i don't even like girl is on fire that much but girl is on fire sweetie...

**uberpigeon** (1): https://media.tenor.com/WSlOQ9AR0r0AAAAC/nene-leaks.gif

**vayyiqra** (1): yeah uh I don't think I'm the target audience for this

**bigbigbee** (0): “The only song parodies we need are Minecraft parodies”, I type, making my fifth reference to Minecraft parodies in a rate comment in a single year (anyway I can’t describe it but this has a type of buzzfeed-esque energy that really grates on me)

**bogo** (0): the longer this goes on the more uncomfortable and icky it makes me feel

**CrimsonROSET** (0): the fact this is the most viral song in this rate makes sense because I feel nauseous

**DefaultPophead** (0): thanks, im now homophobic

**flava** (0): i had such a visceral reaction to this song, at first i thought this was a parody of Gym Class Hero’s, Stereo Hearts ft Adam Levine, before the “this boyyyyyyyyyyy is a bottoooooooooooooom” hit and i realised it was instead girl on fire by alicia keys, which is strange cause you’d think drag queens would parody a song that has a bit more of anything interesting to it and not the instant snoozer that is girl on fire. Anyways the My Lovin by En Vogue bridge jumpscared me and is honestly a bit of a hate crime to vandalise something so sacred, so fuck this song

### because im not a sadist

**DevonRoars** (10): why is there only one Willam song??

### ok true

**ricki** (3): every single american apparel ad girls song should have been in this rate over this

u/sufjancaesar has tried to make me love this song and I just cannot I do not see what all the high scores see in it, I get that her vocals are raspy adds more character and I agree with that, they're just SO UNPLEASANT lmao.

---

### i do not see it suf

**celladonn** (10): This vibe is just working for me. Love the growl in her voice

**sufjancaesar** (10): Her voice sounds amazing here I’m sorry

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): I think this is what I wanted Kings of Leon's Sex on Fire to be. like adore delano's voice is TOTALLY in the butt rock hunk range. like it's just beyond hysterical and impossible to rate outside of a 10. I will say this is NOT progressive butt rock, "just yassified". fucking insane cut im dying.

**BaconShoes** (9): I prefer Whole Nine Yards, but this is a vibe too

**seanderlust** (9): I am honestly so proud of adore for getting sober. I have watched friends really struggle with that and I know it's not an easy thing to do. sending love to her (also giving this a high score because it absolutely rules)

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.5): Okay this is way more my speed. Her other songs feel a bit like “wannabe starlet who just moved to LA can only land B-tier producers, resulting music is tragically bland and forgettable” and don’t get me wrong there’s cliche knockoff elements to this but what can I say, unlike her other stuff it stands out, and I like grunge/rock more than electro pop sooo here we are

**thesmokeylife** (8.5): I didn’t expect this from Adore!

**2RINITY** (8): BRB getting visions of a world where Adore broke out sounding like this & became a giant heartthrob on the Warped Tour circuit

**MrSwearword** (8): this is where Adore always wanted to be musically so it has that going for it

**WaterMagician** (8): awesome to hear Adore finally explore her grunge and punk influences

**camerinian** (7.5): this retro rock aesthetic is so terribly tacky and I kinda love it

**1998tweety** (7.2): vocals on this eat

**welcome2thejam** (7): The rasp elevates it

**freav** (6.8): i for one am glad that the self proclaimed grunge queen finally decided to bring us some good old butt-rock

### no bc she really couldn't come up with anything else that rhymed with heaven

**ignitethephoenix** (6.3): adore has such a good voice but this style doesn’t work for them

**impla77** (6.2): trying a bit too hard in the chorus vocals

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6.1): chorus ruins it

**plastichaxan** (6): Ok girl

**xophrys** (5.5): you hate this one, you do, hate it

**RandomHypnotica** (5.4): i can't believe we have captured somebody's voice dying right in front of our eyes in a song

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): girl you didn't write a hair metal track, what are these vocals. it's frustrating too becuase this is so close to being great

**TiltControls** (5): not what i want to hear having turned 27 last month

**kndight23** (4): I honestly just didn’t vibe with the vocals, too screechy for my taste. The actual song gives me Amy Winehouse vibes but the singing doesn’t match.

**runaway3212** (4): oh wow this is horrible

**akanewasright** (3): …huh! Glad you got that out of your system!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I thought I was safe from butt rock vocals in this rate…

**bogo** (3): this is one of the most confusing songs i have ever heard

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): There’s a divide in this rate between the queens who can sing and the queens who can’t… this is throwing off the scale

**ImADudeDuh** (3): oh these vocals.... Well im glad she’s experimenting!

**jay** (3): blank stares

**frogaranaman** (2.7): funny number haha get it (this is horrible)

**amr** (1): I'm not doing drag rate to hear this type of music respectfully my spotify discover weekly forces enough of it on me already

**Stryxen** (1): she was doing wayyy too much she sounds like you could blow on her and she'd disintegrate with how much of her life force she's putting into trying to make these vocals good

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): she's so punk...

**vayyiqra** (1): This is awful and a pretty bad treatment of the subject matter and not remotely fun which is the point of this rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): All this talk in the rates channel about how bad Oops I Think I Pooped is, which it is, that no one could have prepared me for the POST-GRUNGE sneak in this rate.I did not ask for drag Nickleback. And Nickleback SWEEP this tbh! https://i.imgur.com/SVtmDVS.jpg Adore sounds like this wtf https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uN8Mh9M7lmk

### womaneskin

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this is what måneskin thought they were doing when they made those english songs

**CrimsonROSET** (8): maneskin energy (compliment)

**shhhneak** (6): Highlight of this is the Damiano David-esque wailing.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): oh hi, Maneskin

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Omg I love Måneskin

I feel like I'm hearing a different song to some of you because what the fuck is this... why does she sound like that... who told her to release this, it baffles me.

---

### Queen of The Universe

**apatel27** (10): oh wow a straight up ballad

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I WILL FOREVER DEFEND JUJUBEE KING YOU WON’T SILENCE ME MY MEOW MEOW

**ImADudeDuh** (10): more emotional than anything taylor swift has ever written

**MrSwearword** (10): I was quite shocked when Jujubee finally pursued music and was even more shocked to discover the bitch can do a ballad quite well

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8.7): used to like this a lot more tbh! kind of grew old to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Jujubee losing every season of Drag Race she’s been on then releasing a ballad so she can ensure that she loses Drag Rate too, ugh, her MIND

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (7.9): could be good in an a24 knockoff trailer. cool color on the vid

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Oh an emotional serve?

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): ATWTMVTVFTV is shaking

### queen of the city maybe

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**fkadizzy-1804** (7): It’s a decent albeit cliche pop ballad. She’s got a nice voice. The production has some interesting flourishes. All in all, I’m not mad about it.

**freav** (6.6): love jujubee and there's clearly a lot of passion behind this but its not super distinctive

**thesmokeylife** (6.5): It’s a solid ballad; not much else I can say about it. Diane Warren realness.

**impla77** (6.4): feels like it’s building to something that never comes

**2RINITY** (6): Not heartbroken enough to click with this

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): It's respectable but there's tens of thousands of songs exactly like it with 4 digit spotify plays.

**plastichaxan** (6): This is so boring why was everyone and herself so convinced in telling me she could sing

**Stryxen** (6): worst song ever but she is putting everything into this performance to not let you realise that

**camerinian** (5.5): kinda nice to hear some sincerity in this very detached rate. Also sad that "variety" is maybe the only thing this has going for it

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): I know if Demi sang this they would be breaking their vocal cords making sure it’s dramatic enough. But instead juju decided to hold back the entire time

**TheSheakDown** (5.5): The autotune is a little too glaring for me to really enjoy this

**akanewasright** (5): huh?????

**BaconShoes** (5): It sounded good enough, but it’s not really super memorable or my vibe

### queen of her house

**musical\_pyn** (5): I don't wanna think either, juju

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): She sings like a high schooler who thinks they’re gonna be the next big thing

**welcome2thejam** (5): Technically competent but just meh

**xophrys** (4.5): I may have had troy Bolton posted on my wall but I will not allow someone to just rip off his sad boy in a golf course moment.

**bogo** (4): omg she's breaking down boundaries and proving that drag queens can be boring too

**cremeebrulee** (4): why is this so serious . i’m crying

**sufjancaesar** (4): Everything about this screams bad karaoke

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Like a good amount of songs in this rate, this has the issue of the queen not being a technically great singer. This being a ballad only makes that worse.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): picturing the worst modern dance routine on Strictly to this

**outofa4paper** (3): im so sorry juju

**vayyiqra** (3): Sorry for being balladophobic but I don't like this : (

**TiltControls** (2.5): it's not good but i can't give it a 1 since I feel like I have to save that for the offensively bad songs

**DirtyRat583** (2): ballads? in MY drag rate? u must be mistaken

**flava** (2): i hope balladphobia gets this one early

**jay** (2): mamamoo ballad

**runaway3212** (2): just the most boring thing ever

**frogaranaman** (1): oh hell no not this Tiktok singer/songwriter woe is me ass music

**RandomHypnotica** (1): wtf

### do eurovision rate

**DefaultPophead** (8): I could see this coming second on Eurovision.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this sounds like a eurovision ballad a country like austria would send that gets 15th in the semi final with 11 jury points and 0 televote points

If I could've gotten away with not including this I would have but a lot of people ride ridiculously hard for this song and I just do not get it.

---

### i dont care enough about this song to do comment segments

**1998tweety** (10): an actual bop

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): was hoping for more blair songs cause i love all of them but this ones a classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): popheads chart smash hit. Ok but also, I specifically remember one comment on r/popheads that was complaining about how the radio holds too much control over the hot 100 and that it causes some songs that are popular to not chart, and they said “Blair St Clair just got a #1 album on the dance charts and yet none of her songs are on the charts” and I think i blacked out

**fadedblue09** (9): this sounds amazing

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): deadmau5-esque banger

**2RINITY** (8): This could've run 2006 MySpace

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): it’s kind of dated and generic but this was better than I expected especially from Blair st Clair

**CrimsonROSET** (7): if this rate happened when this song came out it’d be my 11 and I’d be super embarrassed about it

**MrSwearword** (7): If only because I thought Blair's Broadway ass was gonna go a different direction than pretty good dance music on this song. "Call My Life" Dave Aude remix is where it's at, but cute.

**musical\_pyn** (7): this is going to be the rate villain isn't it

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm getting repetitive with this comment but: kinda bangs

**impla77** (6.7): about as white bread at Blair herself

**plastichaxan** (6.5): She’s a good singer but so boring

**BaconShoes** (6): Her voice is pretty good, but it’s pretty generic dance pop that I never really revisit

**celladonn** (6): I don't think the production here is very good but the song itself is alright

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I used to follow someone on tumblr who did community theatre with Blair and apparently for a Secret Santa exchange Blair gave them a vase filled with M&Ms.

**soupcereal** (6): The europop is kind of silly but I guess everyone needs a niche. I just can't take her seriously that's all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i feel like ive heard this song 50 times before

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Wow more meh dance music

**welcome2thejam** (6): Somebody did a High School Musical marathon before penning this chorus

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I confused Blair St. Clair for Farrah Moan doing this rate cuz I haven’t watched in years and woops lol

**DirtyRat583** (5): starting a gofundme to get blair some broadband so she can upload her music in hq

**ricki** (5): white girls dancing to the oonts oonts at the club . gif

**runaway3212** (5): this tries to be a regular song but fails so badly

**thesmokeylife** (5): Sure, I guess so.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (4.5): this one doesn't really send tbh. sounds like off brand top 40 from that evil era. not even the funny video can help

**akanewasright** (4): :|

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This was AI generated.

**fkadizzy-1804** (4): Ahhh she’s going for the serious artiste angle, eh? My initial reaction to this is mixed. I dig the 90s groove and tinny piano track production in the (pre)chorus, but it’s just not... quite... hmm. It’s neither here nor there. It’s not leaning into the cheap-and-cheerful vibe and dressing it up with personality/irreverence the way a lot of the other tracks in this rate do - which is to say, it’s taking itself seriously - but taken seriously, it’s sort of B-tier. Like it’s not BAD but it’s not quite good enough to do what it wants to do. Also the interlude was just exhausting

**freav** (4): god i'm conflited on this one, this is a very well made song, even somewhat catchy too, but it feels so fucking anonymous. i just can't see much personality behind it unlike for most of the songs in this rate (even the bad ones), everything is so meticulous and calculated that it ends up feeling bland

**GlialUreterostenosis** (4): i like the octave jumping in the chorus but that's pretty much it

**shhhneak** (3.6): Eurovision semi-final loser

**apatel27** (3.5): Someone likes Gaga

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): this is Dance Moms Jazz solo music

**flava** (3): these “wo’s and “ohs” zapped the life right out of this song

**jay** (2): 😭😭😭

**nbapip** (2): this makes me irrationally angry. i think because i can see the mouth shapes when she sings the oh oh oh oh

**TiltControls** (2): this album cover is just katy perry's rise and the song isn't much better either

**uberpigeon** (2): why do the queens who can actually sing all make bad music

**frogaranaman** (1): this is exactly what I want out of a drag queen song (edit: just learned she wants to fuck her cousin? wtf)

**Stryxen** (1): ok blair [derogatory]

### jimbo is not seeing heaven

**runaway3212** (10): me insulting somebody for insulting me first

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this only reason this happened is because Allie X was watching them

**BaconShoes** (6.5): Jimbo is kinda mean sometimes but I love her lmao

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6.5): kinda underwhelming ngl

**adeleade** (6): idk this was just an immature moment for jimbo and idk i dont think you come across as strong or iconic when ur acting the fool bc u end up in a position of weakness at the end if ur takedown makes you look stupid in front of the people around you then it probably isnt very good

**MrSwearword** (6): Jimbo losing their shit should be more iconic but it isn't

**nt96** (6): why does Jimbo look like Macaulay Culkin out of drag

**RandomHypnotica** (6): why is pink fighting queen liz

**TiltControls** (6): its iconic but its such a strong bonus group that it's on the lower end of the scores for me

**seanderlust** (5): every RHONY argument sounds exactly like this

**uberpigeon** (5): idk her

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Jimbo was wrong for this

**jay** (4): hm okay

**impla77** (3.7): Let's be honest, they're both looking a bit rough here

**sufjancaesar** (2): Rita > Jimbo

**shhhneak** (1): I don't dislike Jimbo but her reads are at a children's pop-up book level.

### silky's redemption in the eyes of the fans has been so fascinating to see

**RandomHypnotica** (10): :andwhataboutit:

**TiltControls** (10): the way this is coming off one of the most lopsided group performances in the shows history

**BaconShoes** (9): LMAOO

**ImADudeDuh** (9): my favorite part is vanjie living for it in the background and then they cut to her being annoyed

**impla77** (7.5): Tfw you have a reveal but you don't have to lipsync

**seanderlust** (7.5): why are we yelling

**adeleade** (7): lol i mean its funny but it doesnt excite me

**elite4\_beyonce** (7): why are we yelling

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): this is my brain cells arguing with each other

**nt96** (7): she was trying to show off the outfit reveal and she still flopped

**babadork** (5): Despite this low score, a gif of Eureka asking why we’re yelling is one of the Drag Race ones I use the most often.

**MrSwearword** (5): I sided with Yvie in that moment

**plastichaxan** (5): I don't know about this one sorry

**shhhneak** (4): One of the rare instances where the queens reacting is the highlight.

**jay** (3): meh

**TheQueenofVultures** (3): Yvie and Silky fought that whole season about nothing, 11 really suffers from the half the cast getting horrible edits to make Yvie look like she was getting bullied when she started most of the fights!

**runaway3212** (1): I just know she had that line on the ready thinking it was a moment

---

# She fought and she won

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**BetteDavid** (10): love love love this song, reminds me of working at KFC

**MrSwearword** (10): Courtney Act should've represented Australia at Eurovision. More drag queens at Eurovision, please.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.3): the lyrics are kinda corny but this is the edm we need more of!!!!

**WaterMagician** (8.5): Courtney is honestly super underrated for her music and as an Aussie I would have loved to have this as our Eurovision rep

**DefaultPophead** (8): love ya court

**DevonRoars** (8): why is there only one Courtney song?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Courtney has so many good songs and this Eurovision wannabe is the one that made the rate T_T it’s cute but everybody stream [“Body Parts”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5arwJJZBZdA)

**vayyiqra** (8): I like this it's a bit cheesy but very wholesome

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Oh popheads is gonna eat this one up

**2RINITY** (7.5): It's fine, I guess, but shouldn't Australians have to play Eurovision upside-down?

**nt96** (7.5): lets fight for that head voice

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is absolutely nothing special and she can’t sing but I’m bopping a bit.

**freav** (7): bit cheesy but still enjoyable, good synths

**ignitethephoenix** (7): good but I don’t like her voice much

**seanderlust** (7): maybe a bit cheesy but the piano does feel cathartic

**impla77** (6.5): Cheryl’s impact

**ricki** (6.5): jess glyne felt her crown slip a little

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): at least she has a decent chorus

**frogaranaman** (6): was really giving Katy Perry ballad with that intro there I got scared for a second

**RandomHypnotica** (6): one of the best queens having one of the most mind-numbingly generic and boring songs is so upsetting

**Stryxen** (6): stop why is this kinda good (it's not but I expected a Courtney act song to be worse)

**welcome2thejam** (6): Brings just enough oomph in the prechorus/chorus to overcome its shortcomings

### she lost :pensive:

**thesmokeylife** (5.5): Sure, I guess so.

**apatel27** (5): wub wub

**CrimsonROSET** (5): eurovision song- wait really? huh

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I know that Hillary Clinton would love this one

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): i like Kylie and i like songs that sound like Kylie songs and i like music videos that look like Kylie videos. unfortunately this just makes me want to listen to the real thing

**jay** (5): this is what robyn sounds like to me

**musical\_pyn** (5): this exceeded my expectations after hearing the first ten seconds

**fkadizzy-1804** (4.5): Considering this was released in 2019, I think the production was at least a couple of years behind the trend (although maybe not as much as I thought - the piano chords REALLY reminded me of Go Bang by Pnau which I thought was released in the early 2010s but is actually from 2017) and, let’s put it this way, it’s not a fresh enduring timeless song. But I don’t demand that of my music, and basically I think the production is very good and theoretically ought to put this a cut above the rest of the “trying to be serious pop music” songs in this rate. Except I just wish the vocals weren’t so over-processed cause whatever auto-tuning effect is on them is nearly bad enough to throw me out of the song entirely

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): if this played on my work’s speakers it’d be indistinguishable from the other generic pop songs they play constantly

**BaconShoes** (4): it’s missing something idk, maybe she is trying to be too serious but it’s not good enough to back it up? I’m also not a big fan of her voice, and she is supposed to be one of the best singers from the series lol

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): Sunmi served, Cheryl got by, and this just is the song of all time

**TiltControls** (4): a lot of these inspirational ones sound like they were taken from katy perry's back catalogue

**camerinian** (3): in a way it's comforting to know that actual drag queens made these shitty millennial self esteem ballads as well instead of just white pop girl allies

**plastichaxan** (3): I know she has a good voice but I haven’t heard a song that fits it idk

**sufjancaesar** (3): Make it (Courtney’s singing voice) stop

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (3): postmodern drag pop anonymity. that's right we fight we are we are the youth of the nation

**xophrys** (3): Cheryl cole is FUMING absolutely FUMING

**runaway3212** (2.9): this is exactly as good as my advanced calculus exam

**cremeebrulee** (2.5): how is she gonna do when she's already fighting her vocal cords

**celladonn** (2): I love aussie legend courtney act but i'm really allergic to this kind of song

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i would’ve blocked her on twitter too

**uberpigeon** (2): https://media.tenor.com/WSlOQ9AR0r0AAAAC/nene-leaks.gif

**shhhneak** (1): The over-enunciation… Ariana found dead from overstimulation.

**MrSwearword** (10): if only because Willam can turn a slutty mood when they feel like it on non-parody songs to their name.

**BaconShoes** (9.5): THICK THIGHS MAKE THE DICK RISE!!!! Why does this slap so hard

**seanderlust** (9.2): "i'mma need two hands lemme drop the mic" is such a good line

**elite4\_beyonce** (8.5): my grindr bio

**thesmokeylife** (8.3): It’s a meal, not a snack. Let me hear you holler back.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is fun but I misheard it as “thick thighs make a dick cry” at first and tbh I like that better.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ok its actually pretty fun

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): im a thicc bitch i need tempo

**1998tweety** (7): relatable

**plastichaxan** (7): Willam’s music is so annoying it circles back to fun

**TheSheakDown** (7): THICK THIGHS GUNNA MAKE THE DICK RISE!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Well I do appreciate thighs

# FATPHOBIC??? no the song is just bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I love Latrice so much but Willam has always been a bit too phcj energy for me, whatever

**vayyiqra** (6): sure

**Stryxen** (5): I should not have done this rate in one sitting my brain is mush

**camerinian** (4.5): this feels like stolen valor

**impla77** (3.8): I missed Latrice entirely

**2RINITY** (3): I'm conflicted about this one. On the one hand, Latrice kills it, the production is fun, if a bit cheap-sounding, and the chorus is objectively right. Thick thighs *do* make the dick rise. But on the other hand, that *can't* be how William naturally sounds. That accent is put the fuck on. Shit isn't even consistent the whole way--he goes Lawn Guyland before the last chorus to turn "off" into "awf", but the accent for his actual singing is from *way* south of New York. And when a white boy's voice is running up and down the coast like that for no reason, I'm sorry, I gotta assume the worst

**frogaranaman** (3): really hard to get through

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i dont there are words to describe how confused and perplexed i am at this song’s existence

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I know it has Sharon Needles on it but “RuPaulogize” should be here instead

**akanewasright** (1): no dicks rose for this

**jay** (1): wow

### where

**CrimsonROSET** (6): willam they’re all skinny

**runaway3212** (5): nobody in the video has thick thighs???

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (5): I HAVE BEEN LIED TO ABOUT THE THICK THIGHS HERE. IM NOT QUITE INTO OBJECTIFYING DING DONGS THE SAME WAY AS OTHER BODY PARTS I GUESS. THIS ONE IS STILL FUNNY THO. ALSO IF THERE ARE RACISM ALLEGATIONS HERE WE GOTTA JUST GIVE IT A 5

**flava** (1.5): where the fuck are the thick thighs

**cremeebrulee** (1): and are these thick thighs in the room with us now

### things that can be said about this song but not drag race

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): miss Mattel ate it up !

### the double latrice feature

**nt96** (10): I COLLAPSED

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): rhyming wait with weight... iconic

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.2): this cured my ED

**2RINITY** (9): Latrice hits the exact perfect note to both nail the joke and work seamlessly with this ADHD-ass beat. Well fuckin played

**ImADudeDuh** (9): “I may be fat, bitch, but you're ugly, and I can lose weight” she ended all the twinks with that line

**TiltControls** (9): the production on this is **everything!**

**camerinian** (8.5): the audacity of this song to go fucking hard on the treadmill

**1998tweety** (8): the beat on this ATE

**buddhacharm** (8): Giving this a score above 0 as an act of political warfare

**welcome2thejam** (8): I could lose a couple calories to this

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (7.9): she just like me with that love of greasy foods fr

**jay** (7): hyperpop blueprint

**MrSwearword** (7): if only because the warmup act video for a finale is the reason the song is palatable

**plastichaxan** (7): This is what Eureka thought she was doing

**Stryxen** (7): still in shock from seeing a genuine latrice royale hate comment the other day like. How can you hate latrice :(

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Am I gonna make the obvious pun? ^she ^ate

**shhhneak** (6.9): Whose daughter??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): kirby and king dedede

**BetteDavid** (6): KANDY WEIGHT

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I listened to this song a few times, realized it was fun but mediocre, and I’m at peace with that.

**vayyiqra** (6): valid ... i think ... ? idk

**adeleade** (5): tho the featured artist was so good

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): This may be the song I found hardest to pick a number for. On the one hand the music itself got on my nerves in a major way, but on the other hand the attitude and the silliness of it SHOULD bump it up in my rankings but idkkkk I’m just gonna have to slap a 5 on it and call it a day

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): This sounds like it’s playing at 1.25x speed

**GlialUreterostenosis** (4): fat artists shouldn't have to put out records justifying or reclaiming their body shape.

**babadork** (3.5): It might have been a good thing that I didn’t know that Latrice dabbled in music.

**runaway3212** (3.5): you're floppening bestie

**thesmokeylife** (3.1): Without Latrice’s personality, this would be terrible.

**akanewasright** (3): [tag yourself](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/851835432886599761/1044439066873176144/IMG_8776.png)

**BaconShoes** (3): kind of a generic electropop beat with her saying random things about food

**impla77** (2.6): Most of it is just listing food

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (2): it has nothing on the big girl

**frogaranaman** (1): this is for not putting this on Apple Music US

**sufjancaesar** (0): So awful in every way that it can’t even be iconic cringe

### it didnt

**CrimsonROSET** (9): I hope me forcing king to change the video to this boosted its scores

Upsetting how no one else in this rate can appreciate good music, y'all ate Cocky up but for some reason this was too much I hate it here

### things you can say about this song and about all stars 5

**2RINITY** (7.5): Might have rated this higher if I hadn't just heard Shea Couleé rapping over this same kick drum pattern on her own with better production. That said, the chorus and the Kareem bar both elevate this track

**freav** (5.5): shea's part is good

**thesmokeylife** (5): Once again, Shea elevates this track (I feel like I’m saying that a lot, but it’s correct).

**fkadizzy-1804** (1): Show, don’t tell. The only thing that rescued this from getting my zero was Shea’s verse

### cause im dunking on these hoes like my names kareem

**CrimsonROSET** (10): next!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): camp

**nt96** (10): 5-star hotels can never offer the amount of opulence this song had

**plastichaxan** (10): Baddest bitch track, kinda need a joint EP with these two cause what a killer combo

**TiltControls** (10): the baddest bitch in the rate. until she goes to all stars

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**RandomHypnotica** (8): something something tommy wiseau

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (7.9): "4,177 views since May 21, 2020" yeah that's ones really scaling here, king! vixen going to the moon!

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): “i’m the baddest bitch in the room until i go to the next room” is unironically top 3 lyrics in this whole rate

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): i wonder what happened in the first part

**Stryxen** (7): YOU ARE THE FLIERS PIGEON THEROUX

**vayyiqra** (7): is this deconstructed club (don't answer that)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This is high art

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): oh hi mark

### puts the "bad" in "baddest bitch in the room"

**seanderlust** (5.5): "fuck a crown i'm coming for a grammy" hm. hows that working out for you

**uberpigeon** (5.5): brie larson was the baddest bitch in the room actually

**nbapip** (5): so there is a badder bitch in the next room?

**TheSheakDown** (5): Shea & Vixen are my girls but this just doesn’t really do it for me :/

**babadork** (4.3): I feel like The Vixen should be able to coast on attitude, but I don’t like any of her songs. The segment after Shea’s verse is okay.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): When the other bitches in the room are Pandora Boxx, Serena Chacha, and Blair St. Clair.

**camerinian** (4): ahahahah what a story Vixen

**MrSwearword** (4): only because this reminded me I can listen to "Tea Party" to hear The Vixen at their full potential

**runaway3212** (4): this is genuinely so boring???

**fadedblue09** (3.5): no shade but a lot of these songs are just plain boring instead of being campy fun

**BaconShoes** (3): Kinda repetitive in a way I did not enjoy idk

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Nothing The Vixen has put out has ever approached [her verse on that Dorian Electra “200 Years Of Drag” song.](https://youtu.be/p61FUTmjjvQ?t=97)

**jay** (3): mixed by miiii :3

**impla77** (2.5): but have we established who the baddest bitch in the room is

**flava** (2): if you’re really the baddest bitch in the room, you shouldn’t need to make a song about it

This is actually pure camp and I'll never not love this I'm afraid. Like why does this exist, what is the purpose of it it isn't remotely good. I love it.

### Still addicted

**1998tweety** (10): the production on this...im ascending

**buddhacharm** (10): something something soup or sonique

**jay** (10): YEA YEA THAT WAS A CLASSIC!

**Stryxen** (10): this has to be one of the songs I've ever heard

**fadedblue09** (9): bop

**vayyiqra** (9): this rules (hopefully this comment is not regretted later)

**2RINITY** (8): Nice opening riff carries the whole thing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): UFFIE?!?!

**fkadizzy-1804** (8): That bassline and synth lead riff are top notch. And for whatever reason I just love any corniness or trashiness or datedness or whatever you wanna call it in this song. It reminds me of budget Kesha and I don’t mean that as an insult because she has the attitude and personality to get away with it. Sometimes you want the budget version you know?

**ImADudeDuh** (8): soup or sonic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): video game vocal-core

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Why is there an indie game soundtrack playing in the background of this song?

**shhhneak** (7.3): If I squint with my eardrums I can hear unreleased Gaga demo.

**impla77** (7.2): Ah the old ass paint song

**akanewasright** (7): this is the most substance free dance track I’ve ever heard… but I’m so tired that I’ll give it a half yass

**frogaranaman** (7): production sounds like something Fox Stevenson would release in 2015 on Spinnin’ Records

**plastichaxan** (7): It’s fun idc

**ricki** (7): it fucks but she fully deserved to be bottom 3 in all stars 2 talent show

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): eurovision-core

**freav** (6.6): generic but competent bop

### SOOOOUUUUUP OR SONIC ITS u/soupcereal OR SONIC

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): big paris hilton energy here (derogatory)

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6.5): fun but forgettable

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Can you say “generic”?

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (5.5): didn't rly feel anything listening to this weirdly

**uberpigeon** (5.5): this would be higher but the vocals are kind of unforgivable even for drag rate

**babadork** (5): She looks great in that glitter bath, but I can’t believe that this wasn’t made in 2012.

**camerinian** (5): this sounds like a track a small time 2012 pop musician would get played once on their local radio station because they were being super annoying about it to the station management

**TheQueenofVultures** (4.5): Soup For Sonic, its Soup For Sonic

**BaconShoes** (4): kinda generic and forgettable idk sorry detox

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This is definitely ripping off something but idk what it is.

**runaway3212** (4): wish I did not have to hear this

**xophrys** (4): what are you doing here like actually

**seanderlust** (3.5): this is way too early 2010s to have come out in 2016

**CrimsonROSET** (3): I liked her talent show and then I realized at some point it’s because I had fully tuned out what she was singing

**outofa4paper** (3): i was OBSESSED with this song pls

**thesmokeylife** (3): Generic; feels like what you’d hear in the background of a club scene in a procedural.

**TiltControls** (3): detox a sonic fan confirmed

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (3): the best part is that there's a clear A-tier and B-tier of sounds and stars and supersonic is painfully "well that's a song!". not everyone can work with allie x or even buy a chromatics CD though

**TheSheakDown** (2.2): NO

**flava** (1): if the majority of pop stars struggled to have presence on 2009 electropop, what hope was there for people who can’t sing

**MrSwearword** (1): nope. The talent show performance was...what it was but as a song, this is bad.

This song does not even remotely need to be in this rate, but I'll go so hard for it and I do not know why. Whatever she put into this song needs to be studied likw how did she afford this.

### being shady DOES make you opulent 

**1998tweety** (10): S11 was the first season I watched as it aired so I thought a big budget music video was the norm, her power

**shhhneak** (10): This is bad but Kahanna Montrese winning this would be so quirky and random.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): this reminds me of louisa johnson - yes (complimentary)

**akanewasright** (8): why is this good, isn’t she supposed to be a laughing stock?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This song title had me doing a double take to make sure I was not misunderstanding the ballot format.

**diamondsandglass** (8): this did not need to go this hard

**ImADudeDuh** (8): there’s... room for everybody, let’s just say that

**plastichaxan** (8): Kahanna had no reason to make this song but she was hungry enough and decided to EAT on the first thing she could think of

**Stryxen** (8): hello kahanna this was a massive serve (except for the ugly ugly breakdown) we are waiting with bated breath for the album

**sufjancaesar** (8): This video was such a journey and I’m so grateful for it

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh hell yes a jock jam, do you think she can help with my fantasy football team? Girl who are your waiver wire pickups?

**camerinian** (7.5): how on earth can Kahanna have so much vocal personality and literally only one song released? When so many queens have full discographies and consistently give nothing???

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): same energy as he said she said

**buddhacharm** (7): the way that being shady doesn't make you opulent like...

### kahlua? kehlani?? katrina???

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): who

**DefaultPophead** (7): 3RACHA b-side

**ignitethephoenix** (7): dying at how hype she is for someone who was almost last on her season

**musical\_pyn** (7): how much dirt does kahanna montrese have on these queens that they're all here in the video

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Jock slay

**xophrys** (6.5): I hate sport

**seanderlust** (6): this sounds like me acting straight in high school

**soupcereal** (6): The production really goes hard. Shame the lyricism just doesn't work.

**uberpigeon** (6): this loses points because it made me have to look at nina west

**vayyiqra** (6): sure whatever I want to go to bed but I am too far in now to quit this rate

**BaconShoes** (5): kinda bopped but idk. Also i don’t need these sports references

**frogaranaman** (5): Lil Nas X in the THATS WHAT I WANT music video

**thesmokeylife** (2): It doesn’t. (Couldn’t resist, sorry. Anyways, it’s a 2.)

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I was wondering why this was here instead of a better song from a more notable queen so I went to watch the video, hoping for an answer, and not only did I not find one I kinda felt like someone called me a slur.

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): as memorable as her run on the show

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8.1): idk why being baked and listening to LAGANJA ESTRANJA's voice and the rye rye rap is giving me a faint whiff of bradford cox energy; i think this song randomly makes me want to see deerhunter do a drag album. in fact as the song goes on it doesn't really do that but damn its funny.

**1998tweety** (8): naomi is shaking

**vayyiqra** (8): One of my many weird specific things I love in music is this kind of chanting vocals idk okay

**akanewasright** (7.5): rye rye completely saves this song, her verse is just fantastic

**apatel27** (7): dirty beat

**ImADudeDuh** (7): and naomi smalls? OUT!

**plastichaxan** (7): Naomi definitely outsold but you know what I’ll let Laganja have a 7 as a treat I like her

**thesmokeylife** (7): Legs overhead like a pretzel!

**DevonRoars** (6.5): these verses don't hit, but the chorus is iconic

### feels very attacked

**adeleade** (6): naomi remains superior

**cremeebrulee** (6): this could almost be a kesha song

**ricki** (6): Naomi smalls outlegged idc idc

**welcome2thejam** (6): Damnit the gang vocals got me

**babadork** (5.4): Them not spellchecking the lyrics for the video is killing me.

**freav** (5): feels like this goes forever

**frogaranaman** (5): me at Auntie Annes

**MrSwearword** (5): Willam beating down the Ebony Jenkins/Tumblr Drag Race moment is better than the song itself.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Umm no put those legs down ma'am

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Just give me an actual pretzel please.

**TheSheakDown** (4): This is giving Dance Moms dance track

**seanderlust** (3.8): those background voices going "yeah, ho" trying their absolute damnedest to sound masc is cracking me up

**runaway3212** (3): this being so horrible too

**uberpigeon** (3): i like pretzels

**impla77** (2.5): not sure the pretzel simile is the most sexy comparison

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): the top comment on this song compared it to iggy azalea and thats the meanest thing ive ever read about a song, even if its true

**TiltControls** (2.5): i just assumed this would be by naomi

**fkadizzy-1804** (1): I really wanted to rate this a 4.2 but honestly it’s just that bad, I couldn’t do it even for the memez

Seeing this song get torn apart I now wish I didn't include it because I love this song so much jdjs, I think Yvie and Willow both kill their verses, and I love that they made a song about their chronic illnesses, how many other songs that we've rated do that? In the words of an icon, IM A BAD BITCH, IM AN ILL BITCH, YOU WONDERING WHAT'S HER NAME, IT'S WILLOW PILL BITCH!

---

### i literally cant

**xophrys** (6.5): if you have mono scream!!!!!

**jay** (10): "my laugh is like a laxative, the way they lose their shit" made this a 10

**DefaultPophead** (7): Oh no not the laxatives...

**musical\_pyn** (7): I love willow so much

**seanderlust** (7): if Rachel Bloom wrote a BLACKPINK song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I enjoy this but also the production is just kind of doing whatever it wants.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): knowing they are both immunocompromised, I love this for them making a wacky and fun song, but I wish I liked the song better

### the illest

**CrimsonROSET** (6): willow is many things a rapper she is not

**apatel27** (5.5): It started good then went downhill towards the end

**adeleade** (5): a few amazing parts but the rest of the song is too unlistenable and bad to redeem the score

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): so this is what Melanie Martinez has been up to

**impla77** (4.6): okay then

**runaway3212** (4.5): corona has made me really uncomfortable with people coughing honestly

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this song is a critique on the american healthcare system and in this essay i will

**vayyiqra** (4): It's not different enough from the last song and the lyrics are bad and the puking songs are not pleasant

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (3.2): idk why but this makes me feel dizzy

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): this song somehow manages to capture exactly how dissociation feels

**TiltControls** (2): my god do I hate those slowed down vocal sections. the raps save it from being lower

**bogo** (1): yeah this definitely makes me sick

**frogaranaman** (1): this sounds like a meme rap song

**static\_int\_husp** (1): I cannot stand songs with coughing and such in the beat, I hate it so much

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): its like they scientifically engineered this song to be the most annoying song ever created

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): ok then

### video killed the ~~radio~~ drag race star

**akanewasright** (7): The way this song is legitimately good and the video ruins it all

**freav** (7): this was a nine before the baby portion of the video but it still mostly rules

**camerinian** (3): I really thought I'd be safe on Spotify away from that atrocious video but no guess what fucking sequence plays as the visual

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (3): it has its moments but wowowow do i wish i didn't watch the music video

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Ok the song made me uncomfortable all by itself but the video made it so much worse

**RandomHypnotica** (1): genuinely one of the worst music videos i have ever seen

**1998tweety** (0): NOT vibin with this at all, the video also made me actively root against Willow on S14 for the first couple of weeks despite me liking her

### not very legs overhead like a pretzel of you

**babadork** (10): The hosts could play this entire episode of Untucked during the reveal, and I would watch it happily.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): i feel so bad for laganja here ngl ):

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is so powerful I literally showed it to my straight friends. They didn't understand it. But I showed them.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the outfit >>>

**MrSwearword** (10): a full fucking mess that made wonderful TV

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when people respond to my 0 that I know is controversial

**adeleade** (9): i dont love this clip on its own but the whole set up the escalation from episode to episode the way it slowly built up i just feel like this narrative of laganja being super cringe and fake and a liar on her season while idk if its true is definitely entertaining and honestly very well threaded throughout the season and the whole idea of exposing a liar just gives so much gratification

**plastichaxan** (9): Not as iconic as the 10s but Laganja has the mind of a mastermind for this

**nt96** (8): Bianca's just quietly sitting in the corner, questioning her life decisions rn

**BaconShoes** (7.5): Iconic moment, but also I kinda feel bad, like she probably just wanted to indulge in her ganja and couldn’t and everyone was calling her fake and now everyone quotes her. But it’s reality TV gold

**impla77** (7.5): Me at any minor inconvenience

**nbapip** (7): takeitdowntoa2

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): poor ganja, she was going through it. She's such an angel

**TiltControls** (6.5): I do feel bad for laganja here but its an iconic quote

**jay** (6): my poor meow meow

**runaway3212** (5): also boring but kinda fun

**chihkeyNOPE** (3.5): I feel bad for Laganja having like a real breakdown

**seanderlust** (3): Bianca's 50-yard stare into space during this fight is my favorite part

This is definitely one of the most unique songs in the rate, but I do not think that is always a good thing! Mistress Violet is too good of a song to tank just because is Violet so thank god this isn't.

---

### lets be honest none of this rate needed to happen

**shhhneak** (1): We’ve gotten to the portion of the rate that doesn’t need to exist.

### COME THROUGHHHH (not the song)

**2RINITY** (10): HAHAHA WHAT THE **FUCK?!** Whatever I expected Violet to make, it wasn't fuckin EBM/electro-industrial--and I *definitely* didn't expect to learn *Tommy fuckin Lee* wrote/produced this, which makes it the drag descendant of "Narcotic" and "Spun" from the Methods of Mayhem self-titled. If I had another 11 to give, this would get it, because discovering this song exists, and that it fills a hyper-specific niche I didn't know I needed filling, brought me a joy I can't possibly describe

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): collab with Special Interest plz

**flava** (10): ugh

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): If we were rating just on videos this would be a 10 but we’re actually rating the music and unfortunately… that’s also a 10. On recent seasons of Drag Race RuPaul has gotten into this weird habit of saying stuff like “look at your amazing outfit, you need to take the same energy you used to put this outfit together and apply it to [thing that is not making an outfit]” and normally I roll my eyes at that but I think this track is actually a great example of that because it’s actually a very solid translation of Violet’s artistic vision into the musical medium- the juxtaposition between the hyper-feminine lyrics and themes with the nasty delivery and harsh electronic noise is so sexy and salacious.

**MrSwearword** (10): Violet's music peaked here for me but damn what a song

**plastichaxan** (10): I’m not proud of this 10 but like Bettie needs a spank!!

**ricki** (10): this is what i assume rubber doll sounded to those reddit homosexuals that claimed that miss fame was going to be the next drag super star

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i dont know what i was expecting when i clicked on this, but tradwife hyperpop was definitely not that

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): oh those poor boys! they don't deserve a happy wife like violet chachki. just spanks

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Listen this sounds like a healthy, mutually beneficial relationship to me.

**fkadizzy-1804** (9): I felt like I was in a nightmare listening to this. The synths were like nails on a chalkboard. The drums were like rocks rattling around in the rusted tin can of my brain. I was absolutely captivated and couldn’t have turned the track off for love or money even as my body instinctively recoiled. Well played, Mistress Violet.

**nt96** (9): BDSM club vibes but yassified

**BaconShoes** (8.5): The production is fun and it’s pretty cunt

**uberpigeon** (8.5): mormonboyz slay

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): why does my diseased mind really love this synth

**BetteDavid** (8): as a Bette I approve this message

**Pinheadbutglittery** (8): I’m a horny goth what can I do

**camerinian** (7.5): it really feels like Violet commits to the in your face aesthetic a lot better and with a lot more subversive energy than most of the queens here. I'm still not crazy about it but credit where it's due I get the appeal a lot more

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (7.1): the drop kind of hurts my ears but in a really fun way like l.o.v.e. by sophie lmao

**1998tweety** (7): where are the words

**adeleade** (7): tbh this is very aesthetic

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): tradwife type of beat

**freav** (7): wow

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): i like this but i can also see why this is probably going out day 1

**vayyiqra** (7): This scared me when it came on and then kept doing so a bit

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Ohh this is a hookup I was really afraid those were supposed to be her kids

### im so tired of formatting reddit comments

**elite4\_beyonce** (6.9): daddy needs a wank

**runaway3212** (6): I applaud how bold this is but I hate it

**WaterMagician** (5.5): I really love the concept but I think the vocal effects are a bit too heavy here for me to really enjoy

**akanewasright** (5): This sure exists huh

**musical\_pyn** (5): the book of mormon sure looks different

**slimboyfriend** (5): If you’re gonna talk over a beat the beat needs to be worth listening to

**jay** (4): holy hell i completely forgot this song existed.. the amount of flashbacks that just flickered through my mind when that beat started

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): This is a rejected Natalia Kills single

**TheSheakDown** (4): Violet’s music tends to feel more like a visual artpiece with the music as the supporting function

**thesmokeylife** (4): There’s a good song buried under everything else. This would probably work better as a slinky cabaret number.

**ignitethephoenix** (3.5): I’m old this is loud

**CrimsonROSET** (3): riverdale

**TiltControls** (2): beneath the dark and eerie production is a song that just isn't really very good

**ImADudeDuh** (1): oh this is very obnoxious

**impla77** (1): thought it couldn’t get worse until the daddy needs a wank line happened (repeatedly!)

**seanderlust** (0): ow...those synths make my head hurt

### one braincell

**Stryxen** (8): not don't worry darling i cannot escape Harry styles anywhere

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): i was gonna make a don’t worry darling joke bc of the first verse but then it got really horny and that movie lacked any sex appeal so it didn’t make sense anymore

**xophrys** (4.5): you know my favourite thing about the song is like it feels like a song

**frogaranaman** (2): femalelead to Harry Styles in Don't Worry Darling

**runaway3212** (10): she was waiting on that line

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): KIKIKIKIKIKIKI

**BaconShoes** (9): THIS IS NOT RUPAUL’S BEST FRIEND RACE!!! I kinda forgot about the rest of the scene, but that line is endlessly referenceable

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This line read deserves an Oscar

**ImADudeDuh** (9): we are like 2 all stars cycles away from Leshauwn Beyond coming back

**TiltControls** (9): but it is

**impla77** (8.3): honestly Lashawn is speaking straight facts here, no shit Sherlock

**babadork** (8): People silently drinking is my favorite Untucked bit.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8): everyones silence has me crying

**nt96** (8): Jiggly was the greatest bottom of the show. She was on the bottom THREE different times that season!

**plastichaxan** (8): Not as impactful but it played on every untucked intro so it got burned into my mind

**elite4\_beyonce** (7): kikikikikikiki

**adeleade** (6.5): lashauns face doesnt even look bad lol also ive never seen the silent reactions edited in after the fight and honestly those are sooo funny the funniest part for me

**RandomHypnotica** (6): that awkward tensions from the others sob

**seanderlust** (5): I always forget about this one. The editors desperately trying to squeeze in the shade sound effect in the middle of their rapid fire dialogue is sending

**DirtyRat583** (8): INGERLAND!!!!!!!!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Love that subtle nuanced British humor

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Two British-themed songs in one rate?? You’re pushing my limits, but it does bop.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): im not sure whether to call this british (derogatory) or british (neutral)

**seanderlust** (5.8): i just know king phillip served in the full length mirror to this song after his coronation

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): hate the british

**ricki** (3): i don't fuck with british people like that

**vayyiqra** (3): The much worse song with a Bri"ish gimmick in the rate

**shhhneak** (2): I’m surprised Elizabeth survived whatever this is.

**xedophobic** (1): british people

### jk

**BreeCherie** (10): I tried to find a flaw but I couldn’t

**Stryxen** (10): I love Blu Hydrangea but she is 50% struggle 50% hits. she managed to completely HIT here.

**flava** (9.5): something bratty and punk in this one, love it

**1998tweety** (9): Break Up Bye Bye >> but this is still a big bop

**BaconShoes** (9): slaps tbh. I’VE BEEN CALLED A LITTLE SLAG

**soupcereal** (9): Catchy. Leland lowley slayed with this one. This is shoving the UK in my face, but in a way I can accept. This honestly could have been a really good girl groups challenge... UK3 deserved better. This also existed in a world before UKvTW where I didn't loathe Baga Blu (and also Divina) so maybe it's just a little fun to be reminded of the past like that.

**runaway3212** (8.5): who the fuck is mispronouncing her majesty

**nt96** (8): Vote for Her Majesty's Noughtronic Dancefloor!

**uberpigeon** (8): its beyond tragic that UK Hun isnt in this

**buddhacharm** (7): I've been in a drag race server with king for years at this point and every single mention of the word "terrorist" has always come from me specifically in relation to Baga

**ignitethephoenix** (7): love the use of peasants in music

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Colonialist serve

**thesmokeylife** (6.5): Fun! Catchy chorus!

**impla77** (6.4): Going from rhyming home with ‘home’ to ‘throne’.. the growth is immeasurable

**2RINITY** (6): BRB throwing tea in the harbor

**adeleade** (6): dishing out sixes like satan

**CrimsonROSET** (6): I know it came from drag race so it’s a whole different rate but it should have been break up bye bye

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I actually listen to the title track from this album a lot, can’t say the same for this one.

**MrSwearword** (6): The chorus serves, Divina looks great in the video but the rest of it...no.

**apatel27** (5): Ava Max x Jamie T

### never change frog

**frogaranaman** (11): of course I’m giving an 11 to the bear song what do you expect from me 🐻🏳️‍🌈

### WINS

**1998tweety** (10): ||WINS||

**BetteDavid** (8): ...WINS

**CrimsonROSET** (7): put me in the ‘wins’ section

**ricki** (6.5): WINS (but not really)

**kndight23** (5): THE BIG GIRL… LISTS FOODS

### you found it (the best song ever)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The Big Score.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): iconic sample, we love Baltimore club!

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is like the perfect rugirl song

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (10): she ate that

**Stryxen** (10): she actually had something to say which is revolutionary for this rate and genre actually. She makes like 0.5 points across this whole song but its fun so lol

**sufjancaesar** (10): This cultural reset should be taught in world history classes

**nt96** (9.5): Meghan Trainor found bassless, in deep treble, emaciated, french fried and wigless. Her dream house in the album cover; UNDER FORECLOSURE, do u even have bone marrow sis

**akanewasright** (8.5): you can tell Bob wrote this (compliment)

**soupcereal** (8): At the time this released I honestly never expected Eureka to release a track. But dropping a Mitch Ferrino track was just something people did back then. The parts that Bob didn't ghostwrite are obviously weaker. But it just feels like everyone's allowed to have a bitch track moment.

**vayyiqra** (8): Some much-needed levity after the dire song before this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This makes me wanna shake my nonexistent ass

### silky was robbed

**2RINITY** (7): McDonald's at home "Weight" by Latrice

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok but i NEED this to be 2nd just for another “the big girl…. WINS” reveal that was incorrect

**DirtyRat583** (6.8): a song as old as rupaul herself this is like 2 quality 😭

**seanderlust** (6.5): i love the body positivity! it is not a good song, but i love the body positivity

**plastichaxan** (6): This had no reason to be decent

**thesmokeylife** (6): This is solely distinguished by Eureka’s personality.

**impla77** (5.7): wouldn’t be a Eureka song without a ‘found it’ line

**camerinian** (5): all of that food mentioned and yet it still doesn't really feel like she ate

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): I love the message but the mixing is so terrible that it hurts the song

**babadork** (4.5): The dancers are a 10.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (4.3): the beat is amazing but i feel like eureka could have done A LOT more here

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): but you don’t understand guys, she has a trauma associated with singing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): if you reference bhad bhabie saying cash me outside in your song you should have your music making privileges taken away from you

**TheSheakDown** (4): BIG GUT MAKE U NUT

**BaconShoes** (3): obligatory drag race song, forgettable

**jay** (3): ok this cant be a coincidence anymore is the mixing on all these songs awful or are my headphones held together with scotch tape and gorilla glue finally failing

**uberpigeon** (3): u go to surgery to get bigger and u come out. u sees eurekers is smeller. she says "who do u think gave u the big" u get sad 😞

**MrSwearword** (2): Eureka looks nice in the video.

**runaway3212** (2): her message is nice I guess

**shhhneak** (1.7): 6 year old me asking for an Easy Bake Oven for Christmas.

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): the misc part of the rate is really something huh

I thought it was perfect to end this rate on the most recent winner, but I also love this song it is sugary nonsensical pop, and Kornbread's feature elevates it even.

---

### CHOC

**BetteDavid** (10): in my top ten rugirl songs ever

**plastichaxan** (10): Camp points but also points for having my favorite s14 queens and Landon Cider in the video Hello !!! ~~Watch Dragula~~

**runaway3212** (10): a slay to end the rate on

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): no its not the freak on a leash, but this whips

**freav** (9): kornbread is so good in this

**1998tweety** (8.5): camp

**2RINITY** (8): They really committed to the poor spelling joke, huh?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I love Willow, like she is the most calculated queen to ever go on drag race but the math is always right

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): Kornbread is my new fave

**ImADudeDuh** (8): if this rate was done right when the season ended, it would’ve gotten a 10. If it was done like 3 weeks after it ended, it would’ve gotten a 4. Now its good again! Kornbread ATE her verse.

**jay** (8): its cute

**impla77** (7.3): feel like more queens should prioritize comfortable footwear

**BaconShoes** (7): kind of reminds me of a FEMM song almost, but not quite as good. Still fun though

**ignitethephoenix** (7): love these besties

**RandomHypnotica** (7): love the audacity of how camp this title is

**seanderlust** (7): willow coming into the werk room with that ANGLE shirt...history was made. bricks were thrown at cops.

**soupcereal** (7): It kind of gives Va Va Voom. Not at all the type of music I was expecting from Willow Pill

**Stryxen** (7): kornbread

**thesmokeylife** (7): Good!

### KNEE'd

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Well she has the “generic popstar” look down

**WaterMagician** (6.5): Kornbread devoured but the autotune is too much for me

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6.4): could have been released in 2004

**MrSwearword** (6): cute for what Willow can do musically but Kornbread owns this. Also put Kornbread's talent show song on streaming already gay jesus.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): taking points off bc they misspelled angel sorry it just peeves me so much

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Is that how you spell Angel

**flava** (4): this is like Ava Max is Ava Max was capable of making bad songs

**vayyiqra** (4): DONE

**camerinian** (3.5): literally the only notable thing about this song is the title, and that's sad

**TiltControls** (3.5): I'm tanking this not cause it's a mispelling (which it's supposed to) but because of the horrendous feat. tag in the title. WHERE ARE YOUR BRACKETS

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): ………is this title actually just spelled wrong or am I stupid?

**frogaranaman** (3): ao3 energy

**uberpigeon** (3): willow i love u but this sucks

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Willow Pill seems so smart and self-aware, I kinda thought that she’d know better than to release an embarrassingly bad song like this.

**akanewasright** (1): [this is literally the worst tag I’ve ever seen on Apple Music](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/851835432886599761/1041904763857555556/IMG_8715.png). And I’ve seen LOTS of bad ones

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): a n g l e f u

### debil

**amr** (10): I could be Ur angle....or Ur debil [smirk]

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): I Can Be Your Angle Or Yuor Devil

**DirtyRat583** (4): i can be your angle…. or yuor devil

A song I included here almost solely for Shea's verse and yknow what! I would do it again!

---

### honestly did not realise it til these comments said this

**nt96** (7): if you listen closely, it sounds like shes saying Be Bad Jujubee. She has a mind of a master.

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): juju be ….. oh i get it

### juju on as5:

**1998tweety** (10): ATE

**CrimsonROSET** (10): and none for the crumble one

**seanderlust** (9.2): BAD JUJU BE BAD JUJU BE BAD https://giphy.com/gifs/myhouse-viceland-my-house-SiLRmO7nSFItgenDsg

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Jujubee’s portion of this song are so fierce but then Shea jumps on the track with that same standard ass Drag Race flow and spoils the unique vibe that the track had… not enough to tank it but this would have been a 10 without her

**2RINITY** (8): Clever chorus, great Shea verse

**MrSwearword** (8): Jujubee can never be bad. Stream "Need Ya" and "Situationship"

**vayyiqra** (8): This kind of goes hard

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (7.9): she has one ideas she is really trying for. but the chorus has INSANE quickscope logic. not even the on-cinema ass cgi visual and rap from shea could flop that

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): i agree this candy is ASS https://i5.peapod.com/c/NY/NYSH3.png

### juju on s2, as1 and ukvtw:

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): I’m sorry but this hook makes Jujubee sound like a Scooby Doo villain

**ImADudeDuh** (7): she took this too literally on UKvTW

**babadork** (6.5): I’m not sure if this song’s chorus is good, but it’s ridiculously catchy.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): somehow underproduced

**TiltControls** (6.5): i heard if juju does well here ru will invite her back to all stars 12: all stars 1 part 2

**BaconShoes** (6): eh it’s alright

**RandomHypnotica** (6): i feel absolutely nothing listening to this

**fkadizzy-1804** (5.5): Funnily enough, I could literally copy/paste my comment (and score) from Cocky by Shea here. There’s a tier of songs in this rate where I don’t hate listening to them, find myself bopping gently in my seat and wouldn’t change the channel on the radio so to speak, but wouldn’t exactly hope to hear them again, and this is in that tier

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): mid juju

**impla77** (5.3): the archetypical drag race girl song

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (5): AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH why is it so mid

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): How about be a good (song) Juju?

**camerinian** (3): I feel so shady telling a drag queen to stick to the ballads but

**flava** (3): stiff and stilted, watch me by Bella Thorne and Zendaya outsold

**frogaranaman** (3): song title accurate

**jay** (3): ..

**musical\_pyn** (3): you're right, this is bad jujubee!

**runaway3212** (1): just terrible all around

### things you can say about both this rate and as5

**plastichaxan** (7.5): Shea kinda ate her up in her own song ouu

**adeleade** (7): shea kills this

**thesmokeylife** (6.8): Shea elevates the track, as per usual.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): not Shea destroying Juju on her own song

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): Shea's verse saved it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Miss Couleé tried to save this but unfortunately it was a failed effort

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (4): shea's verse carries this

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): not even a shea verse can save this one, but "I am the queen minus the crown" is funny

**soupcereal** (3): Shea is the reason this song isn't at 0. I swear it's so bad, it's so corny, Jujubee can't sing or rap, no clever or cunty lines from her... and the instrumental feels... redundant to me. But Shea's verse literally goes so fucking hard.

**BetteDavid** (7): I thought this was a classy party

**jay** (7): grandmothered

**fkadizzy-1804** (6.9): Well it’s not the worst cover/parody song in this rate. Gimmicky? Yeah. But points for vision and execution

**adeleade** (6.5): i really wanted to like it more but i did not

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6.5): fun lyrics but the song had a lot more potential!

**bigbigbee** (5): I actually really like how this sounds - I like this style – but I think the joke of “sing something filthy in a very old fashioned or posh style” is sooooo played out tired and not funny anymore. If it ever was

**ricki** (5): white people love doing Doo wop Acapella glee versions of rap songs

**babadork** (4.7): I’m not really feeling the knock-off Postmodern Jukebox thing.

**camerinian** (3): y'all if I wanted postmodern jukebox I would have simply gone to Google.com and typed in "postmodern jukebox"

**celladonn** (1.5): There's a time in my life I would've liked this but this kind of white-person-doing-ironic-cover-of-sexual-hip-hop-song-in-a-humourously-contrasting-style thing just makes me cringe these days

**2RINITY** (1): No goddamn Postmodern Jukebox in my lobby! Sashay away! **OUT!**

**bogo** (1): god i'm so fucking tired of people doing classy sounding covers of dirty rap songs, it treats them like they're a fucking joke and basically turns them into a cheap novelty. it isn't funny here, it was never funny in the first place, and it will never be funny

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): shoot Postmodern Jukebox music at the back of the yard

### i did not know this was a cover of a cover

**welcome2thejam** (4): This is legit just the Richard Cheese cover, at least do a different genre than lounge. Gimme the drag ska cover of My Neck My Back

**seanderlust** (3): i mean, it's the richard cheese song played nearly identically to its original. at least she doesn't drop the n-word but that feels like a low bar (that mr. cheese SOMEHOW failed to clear in his original :woozy-face: )

**GlialUreterostenosis** (1): I'm just gonna say it, Richard Cheese is racist

I actually quite like Adore's debut album, this is just okay to me though I think, it aged quite a bit

---

### harry styles

**BaconShoes** (11): This whole album is so good. She ate this up.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): one of my all time fav songs, feels so vulnerable and raw

**jay** (10): MOTHERED THE FUCK OUT OF THIS OMGGGG i used to love this album unironically and im sure if i listened again id still be fully gagged.. choking on the level of slay she jam packed into 11 songs

**MrSwearword** (10): lowkii Adore's best video and the song is an absolute triumph

**RandomHypnotica** (10): https://rave.dj/xlvah1iHrU7Fdw

**runaway3212** (10): this is just the miley cyrus song

**TiltControls** (10): those held notes

**diamondsandglass** (9.9): would be a 10 if it was the live version where glasses got stuck in Adore's wig

**impla77** (8.3): bit American idol core but are we surprised

**2RINITY** (8): In another timeline, this would've been the song that I gave an 11 for being my Rocket League anthem. In this one, it's just a solid trap-pop song elevated by some nice production & mixing

**BreeCherie** (8): nostalgia rush

**WaterMagician** (8): Adore’s second album stands out as a top tier Ru Girl album even after so many others have followed

### jessie ware

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): if she didn't sound like Chingy on the chorus this would be an 11

**Pinheadbutglittery** (8): because I block out the """rapping"""

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The rapping >:( But everything else :)

**plastichaxan** (7.8): Do 3mo or whatever

**TheSheakDown** (7.8): I liked this a LOT more than I thought I would

**1998tweety** (7): feels a little empty

**akanewasright** (7): this almost sounds like it would pass as a radio hit! Like one that people would complain about, but it sounds like something something 2013 Miley would record (derogatory)

**kndight23** (7): Definitely the classic of the rate, her and Alaska really helped make music an actual career option for Ru Girls

**Stryxen** (7): this being a Let's eat grandma song before LEG even spawned out of that swamp called norwich

**thesmokeylife** (6.6): This feels very of its era.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): where’s Harry

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i mean, its better than Miley’s song at least?

**vayyiqra** (6): even though we're gonna lose but idoru

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): the tumblr seeping out of this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): She’s not singing in cursive but like every third word is bolded.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): I can’t say I do

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Verses are good but the chorus is annoying, Miley Cyrus outsold

**ricki** (5): i would have liked this a lot more back when i used tumblr

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): girl please stop trying to rap

**xophrys** (4.5): king I don't know what to comment you are so pretty

### miley cyrus

**apatel27** (4): she got me wanting to listen to Kings of Leon instead. That takes skill

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): I was gonna say “yeah this is fine but sounds super outdated” but then that damn drop happened and the rapping ruined any chance of this being “just fine”

**frogaranaman** (4): sounds like a song that company who made Rebecca Black’s “Friday” would make

**seanderlust** (4): the grinding sound in the background of the chorus grates a bit

**soupcereal** (4): Feels incomplete. But this is just where drag music was at the time.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (3): evil

**welcome2thejam** (3): Intro set up something way more interesting than I got

**fkadizzy-1804** (2): Hateful schlock

**flava** (1): this is just boring bad, which in this rate should be considered a sin

**freav** (0): i am sorry for this bc i know adore is one of the queens who's serious about their music, but god i hate this. admittedly this kind of tumblr-core pop is like my least favorite kind of thing ever, but this is like a specially bad example of it. i get that adore has good vocal chops and is aiming for some kind of subtlety here but every non-hook is more insipid than the last, the "and I--I--I" part sounds for a second like its gonna turn into that kings of leon song lol

**nbapip** (0): brokencyde vibes (derogatory)

This chorus is so bad I can't defend this Monét, thank you Bob for saving huh

---

### things you can say about both this song and season 8

**akanewasright** (6.9): Bob carries this a little

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6.5): i know its a crime not to like this song, and i appreciate the vocals but the beat doesn't do it for me!! i'm so sorry ahhh. bob is so funny tho

**musical\_pyn** (4): bob saves this from being not good

**runaway3212** (4): bob tried to save, but he failed

**thesmokeylife** (4): Bob’s verse makes the song. The rest is unmemorable.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): the worst thing a drag song could be is boring and good god is this chrous cliche and underwhelming, bob is the only reason this isn't a 0

### girl soak... what up?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): people really do be hating undercover though. Side note: I remember watching a 2018(?) mega pop mashup with 150 songs or whatever and this was mashed up with Girls Like You for like 4 seconds and my brain chemistry changed at that moment

**jay** (10): wait YASS. Lemme vogue in this walmart bread aisle

**MrSwearword** (10): Before Savage with Bey, this is how a remix saved a song

**Stryxen** (10): Girl soak… What up??

**xophrys** (9.5): this should have already been in my playlist

**1998tweety** (9): maybe some sweat

**2RINITY** (9): A classic slice of good-ass house music

**TiltControls** (8.5): bob kind of mopped monet here

**camerinian** (8): crazy how much one seriously good chorus buildup can improve a song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): girl soak what up

**DefaultPophead** (8): was going to be higher then i heard from asia to malaysia

**ignitethephoenix** (8): invented pure/honey by Beyoncé

**welcome2thejam** (8): Can't believe she sold out to Big Sponge smdh

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): There's the skeleton of a great house track here but the production isn't good enough to do it justice.

**apatel27** (7): Pulled straight from 2013 UK edm scene

**uberpigeon** (7): mmm sexy men in video

**WaterMagician** (7): one of the best “elimination singles”

**BaconShoes** (6): it’s fun i suppose. A bit of forced branding

**bogo** (6): to the left, take it back now y'all

**soupcereal** (6): This never really landed for me

**TheSheakDown** (6): This has the same issue as The T by Alaska and I feel like it’s gonna be a critique I repeat a lot in my ratings wherein a lot of these songs revolve around a specific gimmick or rely on dated references and didn’t age well past that

**fkadizzy-1804** (5.5): This is fine, basically. A perfectly respectable song with nice-but-not groundbreaking production. I doubt I’ll remember much of it or come back to it outside of the context of the rate, though

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): soz Monet but this sounds like it’d be a Glassons smash hit

**impla77** (5): glad we’re out of the era of brand songs

**plastichaxan** (5): Why did I give the 10 for her sponges at first she doesn’t deserve it

**shhhneak** (5): Gia’s “Girl… soak what up?” might be my favourite quote from Drag Race and that’s saying something.

**ricki** (4.5): \*Tiffany Pollard voice* THE SWEAT OF YOUR FOREHEAD?!!!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Oh this is some baaaad autotune.

**seanderlust** (4): everyone sounds like they recorded their vocals on a 2013 macbook air

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): is this supposed to be a reference for something why the fuck are they singing about sponges

**frogaranaman** (3): be honest do you think they make money from music

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Monét is a great vocalist with a charming personality- facts that this song tries desperately to hide for some reason.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I love monet but what is this ice jj fish ass chorus. the rap verse is a serve tho

### geography class

**flava** (5): “from Asia to Malaysia”. Girl I shouldn't have to explain that Malaysia is IN Asia

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): “From Asia to Malaysia” ok I know Asia’s a drag queen name but seriously JAIL for that line

**vayyiqra** (8): I love Show Me Love it's an all-timer - wait "from Asia to Malaysia" uh I have bad news about where Malaysia is lol

**amr** (6.6): asia to malaysia heart eyes emoje

**slimboyfriend** (6): I see the vision on this one but the vocal production is atrocious. Also lol at Bob letting Monet say “Asia to Malaysia”

### watch s15

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): The fact that they didn't immediately try to track down a queen named Malaysia to complete all the names in the last verse is infruriating to me
