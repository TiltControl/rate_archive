Such an iconic song going out soon was kind of a gag but also kind of inevitable now I think about it, it's so iconic *because* of all the references to the show and that's also exactly why so many people doing this rate have no idea what the fuck this song is about. I agree with the consensus of a lot of the comments that while this was an iconic moment that shook the drag world in 2016... who is actually listening to this as a song like...

---

### making me ctfu

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): hope she won all stars 1, seems like she deserved it

### changed the game with that bitchtrack drop

**elite4\_beyonce** (11): perfect bitch track

**DefaultPophead** (10): bar after bar go thunderfuck

**flava** (10): as someone who has never watched an episode of drag race, does not know any of the contestants, didn’t know any of the songs before, and zones out whenever the show is used as shitpost material. This song made me want to delve that world

**jay** (10): i wanna 11 so badly omfg but someone needs to die on the Ding Dong hill

**MrSwearword** (10): a kii is a kii of course of couse

**plastichaxan** (10): Kinda cunty to have the Adore feature just for some wooahs as the bridge

**RandomHypnotica** (10): even though I don't fully understand all the references i can FEEL the power eminating from this

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): a very confused 10

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.8): talented brilliant incredible amazing showstopping spectacular!!!

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): The gag this song was when it dropped, I don't think any ru girl single has made that level of impact

**thesmokeylife** (8.2): The Genius page for this song must have more highlights than Alexis Rose’s textbooks.

**1998tweety** (8): bopT

**letsallpoo** (8): people died

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (8): i think its funny that adore was featured to just go oooh yeah oooh

**shhhneak** (8): Very similar to AS2 in the sense that I don’t know what Adore is doing.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I wish I knew what these references really meant but I’m satisfied just imagining it’s really juicy

**WaterMagician** (8): the context of Alaska’s AS2 run really carries the song but it still slaps

**akanewasright** (7.5): this was my first introduction to any drag race contestants in any capacity beyond hearing a name here or there, and it was BEWILDERING

**BaconShoes** (7.5): She’s just kinda saying random things, but it’s camp

**camerinian** (7): giving Adore a featuring credit for three vocal runs and then moving on is so brilliant

**runaway3212** (7): she's spilling but it's fruit tea

**sufjancaesar** (7): I want Adore’s shaky runs on loop forever

**ricki** (6.5): back when alaska was public enemy #1 people were trying to get nicki minaj to sue her for plagiarizing *only*

### coffee person myself

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I might enjoy this more if I understood more of the references/lore.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): Traplaska doesn’t do much for me but glad she got this all out x

**kndight23** (6): I don’t personally care for the song a ton (it’s also weird that Adore has a “feature” that’s just a 3-second run lol) but there’s no denying it was pretty revolutionary in terms of Ru Girl music

**nbapip** (6): extra points for cheating on sharon

**TheSheakDown** (6): I’m a sucker for a good bitch track but this aged like milk. Not because it’s problematic but all the lyrics are relevant to stuff that was happening back in 2016 so if you weren’t there for that none of this holds up but it was super iconic when it first dropped

**vayyiqra** (6): So the T here is mainly what kind of dick Alaska likes I guess is what I have gathered from this

**outofa4paper** (5.8): but the mv is an eleven

**2RINITY** (5): Once I clocked this as a white non-rapper trying to freestyle, it was all downhill

**seanderlust** (5): alaska's goal with this song was to, in her own words, "be her own wikileaks" which as an attitude i respect but song-wise? this is a bit rough. alaska did invent having a guest vocalist just serve background vocals for a brief moment....taylor found DEAD

**uberpigeon** (5): idk how to score this because as a song it kinda sucks but as an important piece of queer history its iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (4.5): sharon needles reference jumpscare (but for real, I don’t really care about this song)

**fkadizzy-1804** (4): This works better as a piece of gossip than a piece of music. As someone who is totally out of the loop on the drama, there’s a certain voyeuristic appeal but I wouldn’t listen to this again outside of the context of the rate. As with all of Alaska’s other songs, the production is primo and Alaska’s personality/charisma is on full display but for me it’s a meh, at least relatively speaking.

**amr** (3): asexual alaska thunderfuck moodboard alexa doesntfuck but the [HUG] was good cos I like small [ARMS]

**celladonn** (3): I'm just sitting here completely blank faced because I don't know anything about any of this drama nor do I care

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): let’s play six degrees of drag race separation!

**soupcereal** (3): I like this more as like, a cunty Youtube video at a specific place and time than an actual song

**Stryxen** (3): I have nothing nice to say

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): why would you willingly admit you have a reddit account in a song, how are you not ashamed of that

**welcome2thejam** (3): Can't believe the two rates I needed to read the most background for were about RuPaul's Drag Race & children's television

**frogaranaman** (2): she sounds like a pack a day smoker on this song more than usual

**xophrys** (2): if I understood the references I'm sure I would go insane for this.

**TiltControls** (1.5): this is a bit too dour for alaska

**apatel27** (1): youtuber music but for annoying gays

**bogo** (1): as someone who grew up listening to bob seger, hearing alaska call turn the page a metallica song almost gave me an aneurysm

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): When this goes out early I know that people are gonna try to blame it on the fact that people don’t understand the lyrics, but really it’s just because it’s bad. I do have to give Alaska credit for how well she rehabilitated her image- people were coming for her HARD when she beat Katya but this was a master class in spin.

**static\_int\_husp** (1): this is bad but the worst sin of the song is mentioning Reddit

### varying unexpected comparisons

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is how u make an incomprehensible stream of consciousness into a song wow cassandra jenkins you are fucking done!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): inspired Taylor in all her feats

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): I never fucked Wayne, I never fucked drake, all my life man for fucks sake

**impla77** (4.6): giving Janelle monae in we are young feature

I should've included Hurt My Feelings, I'd also have given that a 1 but at least that has a video.

### people at the party

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): i remember when Tatiana performed this for the first time, the earth moved

**plastichaxan** (10): Pretending this the All Stars spoken word performance instead to boost the rate average

**ricki** (10): you just had to be there

**thesmokeylife** (9.5): A modern drag classic.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9.4): good high school football game worthy bass drop. our nation's best cheerleaders should be working on a routine to this asap; america needs it.

**babadork** (9): The production doesn’t ruin it, but I’ve heard better versions made by fans.

**BaconShoes** (9): She slayed this

**cremeebrulee** (9): ok …… this kinda fucks

**seanderlust** (9): "what you see isn't always the truth" is unironically such a good line

**slimboyfriend** (9): She’s such a narrative songwriter

**2RINITY** (8.5): I see why Katya's so obsessed

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8.3): this sounds like a car crash I LOVE IT

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): its not particularly good but im giving it a good score anyway bc i always love songs that have random dubstep moments

**BreeCherie** (7.9): performance art

**DirtyRat583** (7.6): what the FUCK

**freav** (7.5): the overediting takes out most of what was so cool about the spoken word bit but also its kind of a banger

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): A solid attempt to translate their iconic spoken word to music but tbh it loses that sexy, cheeky energy in translation. A decent club song though.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): can the person with the chainsaw keep it down a bit in the recording booth?

**runaway3212** (7): yass

### and i'm wanting to dance

**dream\_fighter2018** (6.5): the post-chorus is so good but I hate the drop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I don’t know whether I love or hate the lawn mower in the background.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): if it was just the spoken word this would be a 10

**Stryxen** (6): as2 eliminating her even after THIS performance and then read u wrote u plagiarising this track I could Not believe it

**TheSheakDown** (6): Worked better as a spoken word piece imo

**uberpigeon** (6): This "piece"... huhuhu

**vayyiqra** (6): swear i've heard this before somewhere idk it's kind of unnerving

**welcome2thejam** (6): When it fades out at the end it sounds like she's saying "geodude"

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): There are more… creative songs here

**elite4\_beyonce** (4): the lyrics are iconic but the production is so dated

**impla77** (3.2): Truly does not improve from the song treatment. Sounds like someone is revving a motorcycle engine in the chorus

**akanewasright** (3): wow! Choices were made with this production

**TiltControls** (3): loses its impact a little not being spoken word

**sufjancaesar** (2): Should’ve released the monologue and left it at that

**TheQueenofVultures** (2): I don't know why she electrofied this

**frogaranaman** (1): why do drag queens and Skrillex have the same production interests

**MrSwearword** (1): this is far more effective in the talent show or as spoken word poetry.

**jay** (0): took the original and absolutely demolishing it so far into the ground its in the basement.. actually no its gone so far down into the soil it punctured through the tectonic plates, flying down into the mantle with ease, kept going past the outer core, kt reached the very center of the earth and burnt up joining the rest of the lava and heat trapped down there. I wish this wasnt brought to my attention, i was only aware of the original and now that this mp3 file has been brought to my attention my night is ruined. I need to listen to ding dong after this to stabilize again

I think this just incorporates a lot of drag-race-isms that I find annoying now, the S3 cast are incredibly talented but musicians they are not.

### shangela single-handedly bringing the word nancy drew into the drag race lexicon... lex**ICON**

**dream\_fighter2018** (11): I actually know Shangela from Dance Moms, specifically from those segments before Nia’s solo for this song where she teaches the ALDC how to death drop. Anyway, this song is the sort of campy fun that I like. It’s so much fun, and makes something comedic out of the ordinary shit. Unfortunately, I have only reached the “I heard you were hiring” part of job searching so I can’t say it’s relatable

**BaconShoes** (10): I CAME TO WERK!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I think this is coming out after DWTS ended so I hope she won

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): shangela’s natural 10/10 charisma lifted up this 1/10 production

**jay** (10): iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): only a true professional like her would release a song this slaytacular.

**musical\_pyn** (10): I actually really love this? It captures that early drag race vibe perfectly while still being catchy and a pretty good song

**ricki** (10): the pinnacle of modern culture was when nia from dance moms did her number to this

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9.5): we need more professional union class workers. exceptional time capsule to 2012.

**2RINITY** (9): This must have sounded fucking DERANGED on release

**TiltControls** (8.5): and werq she did

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**camerinian** (8): crazy how making your drag club song stand out from the rest of the drag club songs can be as simple as syncopating your fucking beat

**nt96** (8): this beat is so toile!

**plastichaxan** (8): Your standard drag track but like one of the first ones so

**thesmokeylife** (7.9): One of the first times a Drag Race alumnus really leaned into catchphrases on a song.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): not according to jasmine masters on the RuPaul’s Drag Race Holi-slay Spectacular set

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): why was this filmed in a secondhand furniture warehouse

**elite4\_beyonce** (7): ahead of her time

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): doesn't really do anything unique but the 90s Baltimore club beat goes off

**nbapip** (7): an innovator

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): Working in corporate offices be like

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Serving Gainful Employment Eleganza.

### https://inmagazine.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/Shangela-Reveals-Her-Planned-All-Stars-3-Wrecking-Ball-Lip-Sync.jpg

**vayyiqra** (6): werq sis or whatever idk ok im so tired

**WaterMagician** (6): for some reason this feels a bit dull and doesn’t really communicate Shangela’s charisma and energy

**impla77** (4.3): they really put all the production they could find on this track

**fkadizzy-1804** (4): I think I’ve heard this song at least a dozen times in this rate. It’s like getting the same flavour of ice cream every day with slightly different toppings

**runaway3212** (4): this song is so long and for what

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Proto-hyperpop, hoes in this house, the Lisa Rinna-esque look, what more could you ask for

**seanderlust** (3.5): why does the single cover look like a disney channel series that never made it past the pilot

**celladonn** (3): This beat is so exhausting

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this song walked so wap could run

**flava** (2): Cardi B really stole from two songs in this rate that are right next to each other

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Time for Shangela to lose another competition~

**frogaranaman** (1): maybe you should quit

I didn't want to include festive songs from the queens ie: their Halloween or Christmas ones of which there are many, but then I broke that because I'm a Saint stan and wanted to include a Dragula ghoul, only for her to embarass herself at Roscoe's and start so much drama 💀💀 so I did *not* have the last laugh there

---

### AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): couldve been more metal but slay

**celladonn** (10): This kind of campy halloween trash is very much my thing

**freav** (10): love industrial

**MrSwearword** (10): Kim Petras must be seething she didn't make this

**RandomHypnotica** (10): AHH!! oops i got scared

**ricki** (10): I'm going to sound like a total bitch but aiden zhane was not on the list of queens i expected to make actually great music

**shhhneak** (10): Seated for Aiden Zhane’s inevitable All Stars Ra’Jah-esque redemption arc.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): SLAY (both literally and figuratively)

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): SPOOPY!

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.3): never liked aiden on her season but the vibes on this!! perfect for halloween

**BaconShoes** (9): I’m a sucker for a spooky song tbh so I might be biased

**Stryxen** (9): aiden zhane your existence baffles me but I get you now after hearing this. I understand

**welcome2thejam** (9): this is 2 spooky 4 me

**1998tweety** (8): bitch

**2RINITY** (8): Classic Halloween party playlist fodder

**BreeCherie** (8): no such thing as taking a meme too far

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): wane, if you’re reading this, I’m gonna tell my kids this is Ministry x

**DefaultPophead** (8): clipping. ??

**uberpigeon** (8): ok she ate this harder than she ate lunch with Patricia Quinn

**xophrys** (8): Mariah Carey said it is Christmas time get over it

**seanderlust** (7.5): cheesy as hell but still kind of fun. i'm rating on halloween though so that might be giving it a bump

**TiltControls** (7.5): i wonder if this would've been 3 points higher if i didn't procrastinate and actually did this in october

**frogaranaman** (7): why isn't this a Halloween song staple

**jay** (7): hm okay

**thesmokeylife** (7): We don’t often get Halloween singles from drag artists, so it feels notable in that sense, and it’s fun.

### brita stans (so me)

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): when is Aiden coming back for All Stars

**adeleade** (6): girl lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): She a freak in the sheet (ghost)!

**camerinian** (6): there is so much potential in this presentation and I wish it wasn't wasted on like a 9-year-old's idea of what Halloween is

**runaway3212** (6): I respect aiden for making one single good joke and making a career out of it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’m not hot topic enough for this

**bogo** (5): sorry it's november now

**buddhacharm** (5): Aidan and Saint could've been the drag superduo to end all superduos but nooo... we get HoSo and Astrud instead

**fadedblue09** (5): points for living up to the aesthetic i guess

**nt96** (5): me listening to this

**musical\_pyn** (4): this is okay but saint's verse just does not work

**fkadizzy-1804** (3.5): My immediate impression, right off the bat (no Halloweeny pun intended), is that the synths and beat are just kinda tired. Just very muddy and amateurish. I don’t necessarily mind those qualities - see my ratings for certain other songs - but there needs to be some kind of playfulness, unselfconsciousness, charm, dare I say camp? This is just... blah

**impla77** (3.3): not sure anyone was eagerly anticipating an Aiden Zhane single

**TheSheakDown** (3.3): i dont claim this energy ❤️

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (2): boo

**vayyiqra** (2): I'm trying to get in the mood for Christmas so this demonic shit isn't really hitting

### watch dragula

**Pinheadbutglittery** (10): watch Dragula

**plastichaxan** (10): This is incredible y’all better not rob our spooky queens ~~it’s literally October~~ it’s not October anymore but it’s an October rate anyway

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Glad to see Saint took some time out of her busy schedule of being drunk at Roscoes to help her sister out <3 / but seriously this is one of the better songs in the rate, I was so shook when this came out and it remains underrated by the general fandom.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): thinking about the most robbed queen in this rate is a Dragula girl

**ImADudeDuh** (7): If there was a drag race queen who won a special episode to compete on season 15 and their runner-up in said special episode also got to compete on the season and the runner-up eventually won season 15, they would’ve called the producers people trying to break the special episode’s winner’s psyche and “unnecessarily cruel” and make SO MANY sad edits on tiktok.

### condragulations raja

**amr** (10): russia's greatest love machine

**freav** (10): it's rough but there's some great sounds here. this is the kind of thing i'd love to see more from drag queens, love how creative it is

**plastichaxan** (10): Raja has always been miles ahead of everyone and it will be proven once again when this is robbed

**seanderlust** (10): https://rave.dj/E2Librtya3IM-A

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hoping this music video won't make me regret this 10 cause hot DAMN this rips

**GlialUreterostenosis** (9): Aura but good

**outofa4paper** (9): was actually top track on my spotify wrapped one year

**shhhneak** (8.8): A unique beat? WE WON.

**2RINITY** (8): Ahead of its time

**jay** (8): whoever did these lyrics including the (?????) all throughout the song.. * rattle snake noise *

**nt96** (8): why is Raja's spotify page full of random hindi albums 💀

**vayyiqra** (8): This section of the rate had some true dire songs but saved the bangers for the end I guess

**impla77** (7.8): couldn’t tell this was from 2013 and that’s defo a good thing

**1998tweety** (7.5): i think this bops

**BaconShoes** (7.5): i was humming along and the production is fun

**fkadizzy-1804** (7.5): The groove and energy on this are startlingly addictive but not quiiiite to the point where I think I’d reach for it again outside of the rate as just like, a song to listen to

**TiltControls** (7.5): thank u raja for remembering the guitar

**camerinian** (7): so much potential in the arena rock production, why did raja piss it away on that mousey voice on the verses

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this production is like amazing but then Raja’s part is just … queen of having a budget I guess

**Stryxen** (7): that was fun

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6.5): the mixing on this is a mess but the song is good

### ignore that random all scores links are pastee's and not pastebins

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): i cannot process what is happening in this song it is just so much noise

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I will NEVER FORGIVE PRODUCTION for choosing Raja for winning the She Done Already Done Had Herses crown in AS7 because the fans liked her more, despite Yvie fucking **STOMPING HER** in that final lipsync.

**MrSwearword** (6): the video slays. Musically...no

**soupcereal** (6): I appreciate the confidence but it's just too weird for me unfortunately

**thesmokeylife** (5): Sure, I guess so.

**uberpigeon** (5): im broken my mind is shattered and my will is broken. i no longer know if a song is good or not and i fear my own thoughts EDIT: nevermind its bad

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Literally what is this

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (5): insanely "this is not an ideal" vibe here. getting quite headass wrt the bollywood characteristics here i found. and then the guitar is not butt rock'd out enough. sorta just an endearing slab of mid.

**TheSheakDown** (4.7): I feel like I went through a spiritual transformation listening to this

**BreeCherie** (4): this is certainly a song

**CrimsonROSET** (4): she could walk out there in a fucking diaper and they’d be lik RAJA YOU’RE SO FASHION FORWARD

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): The initial track list for this rate included [this atrocious cover of “Lady Marmalade”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGLY0Lb4yYE) and I wish that was our Raja representation because this is just as bad but lacks the same camp factor.

**frogaranaman** (3): absolutely not

**runaway3212** (2.5): Girl this is terrible

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Music is not her calling.

**apatel27** (0): Fuck these dickheads that appropriate Indian culture

I mostly included this to bring up the name recognition of the rate lmao. This is kinda just fine, I think a lot of comments didn't realise this was a cover sdjsj, one of my favourite things about this song is actually the video, because I think Trixie and Orville really sell it, but obviously if you're just listening to the playlist you don't get that at all.

---

### country rate so i can give dead of night an 11 please

**DefaultPophead** (11): Oh Orville keep going...

**camerinian** (10): and I suppose this is my forceful reminder to go listen to that new Orville Peck album which apparently rips but I haven't got around to yet

**flava** (10): Orville Peck saving my sanity once again, stream Bronco

**amr** (9.5): somi and daehwi cover when

**freav** (9.5): god i love orville peck

**seanderlust** (9.5): POV: you're sitting in a diner booth in palm springs hearing a gay couple argue loudly when you're just trying to order some pancakes

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Now Orville is an artist we need to rate at some point…

**BreeCherie** (9): maybe I’m a country bumpkin after all

**1998tweety** (8.5): ended Jackson Wang

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8.5): Please tell me they mean Mississippi and not Wyoming.

**2RINITY** (8): Can't go wrong with cold hard Cash

**plastichaxan** (8): This grew on me and I couldn’t bring myself to tank Orville in his first rated song my king

**sufjancaesar** (8): Why did Trixie eat Orville up lmaoo

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (7.9): where is she going again? :'D

**thesmokeylife** (7.6): I like it. The rating is mostly for Orville.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): imagining the jackson they are talking about is a man not a town

**akanewasright** (7): Orville’s voice makes me weak… almost hides Trixie’s squawk

**bigbigbee** (7): I like that Trixie took a semi-nontraditional path for drag race music. I like country a lot, and this was a nice breather in a playlist that skewed more towards dance music! However, I think that Trixie’s vocal tone is just not that enjoyable for me to listen to, especially in this song when it’s contrasted with Orville’s gorgeous bass

**frogaranaman** (7): +2 points for this concept being more cunt than the execution

**ignitethephoenix** (7): my countryphobia vanishes when I listen to Orville

**impla77** (7): 🤠

**runaway3212** (7): this is the only song here that sounds like a regular song but also a kinda boring regular song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Yeehaw

### flava's hitlist

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Orville Peck always sounds like he’s doing an impression of a stereotype of a country singer and not well

**adeleade** (6): oh theres the daddy i was referring to

**ImADudeDuh** (6): oh no trixie, get away from an actual musician! You’ll sound worse!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this wouldve sounded so much better if it was an orville solo sorry

**TiltControls** (6): Orville's always good, but there's nothing special about this track

**welcome2thejam** (6): A Jackson cover? Orville? Think this rate's got me in a fever dream

**fkadizzy-1804** (5.5): Sorry not even my love for Orville Peck can elevate this above a middling score for me. The video is super adorable though.

**BaconShoes** (5): This is not my vibe sorry

**soupcereal** (5): Orville Peck never really landed for me, even though he's essentially everything I should like

**TheSheakDown** (5): I love the queering of country music but I hate 90% of country music sorry

**vayyiqra** (5): Well at least this has a guy who is good at country

**celladonn** (4): I love Orville but I grew up with the Johnny Cash and June Carter version and this just doesn't compare

**CrimsonROSET** (4): see flava here’s the closest you’ll get to a country rate

**fadedblue09** (4): not as good as the other yeehaw song

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This is the best Trixie song in the rate because she doesn’t sing half of it

**MrSwearword** (4): Trixie's vocals save this

**Stryxen** (4): i do not like the rainbow community

**jay** (2): holy this is a never ending NIGHTMARE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**uberpigeon** (1): well im going to jack off! bye

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (0): oh gee i forgot this fucking cornball was in here. the irrational hate 0 isn't even awarded to trixie--who does fine under a serviceable instrumental (its not a great cut but it does look like everyone had fun, that's good)--it's rewarded to Orville Peck. I'm tired of this fecker and his faux cowboy bullshit...dude you're a fucking punk drummer from Canada first and foremost that can get mac demarco to cameo in your music vids. I truly don't need to see you in any of this shit outside of making blast beasts. I'm politely asking you to take your act back up north. or hell, go move to idaho; make a line of craft seltzers  that might stop that state from going headass into an ethno-autocracy. again, i dont want to see this man in drag music videos thats why im using the irrational hate 0. someone has to be giving this an 11 for orville and Im gonna die when i see the results on desk when it dies at 29th place with a 6.4 avg.

This was a bit of a sneak in the rate lineup and probably doesn't need to be here but idc idc it bops, the chorus is so fun and sugary while also being dark. For some reason I also remember a lot of drama around Biblegirl's appearance in this video and I cannot for the life of me remember what it was about but it's Biblegirl so I believe it.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.5): this drop is crazy good and alaska is always so funny lmao gotta get some waffles bruh

**2RINITY** (9): I should've listened to this first, it would've been the perfect way to set the expected tone for the rate before other songs threw me for a loop

**CrimsonROSET** (9): https://imgur.io/DxSVGLk?r

**fkadizzy-1804** (9): Baby, this is what I came for. Raunchy irreverent joyous romp with, I must say, shockingly high production values, perfectly cartwheeling along the tightrope between “it’s a parody right?” and “wait she’s serious?” where genuine weirdness lives.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9): "wildly competent"

**freav** (8.8): this one rules

**BaconShoes** (8.5): the beat goes off tbh

**ImADudeDuh** (8): idc about the performance but the production slaps

**nt96** (8): where we poop from

**slimboyfriend** (8): hotter than a sodomite

**babadork** (7.5): I knew I had an overly elaborate rating process but asking myself if a song was better than “Anus” 50 times might be what gets me to streamline things.

**1998tweety** (7): production kinda eats

**camerinian** (7): this is so fucking stupid and I have no idea how I should feel about it

**ignitethephoenix** (7): is this song about pussy or bussy holes??

**jay** (7): iconic.. but not legendaric..

**ricki** (7): edgy nickelodeon show theme song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i think i stockholm’d myself into enjoying this one

### i love your pussy

**impla77** (6.6): I don’t know how to feel..

**BreeCherie** (6.5): could go way harder

**apatel27** (6): This beat is actually really good outside the fallout boys chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): King I thought I told you to cut this, Alaska has literally seven songs on her YouTube channel that have more views than this and all of them are better. This is why everyone has been roasting Alaska in the chat, you set her up.

**MrSwearword** (6): the chorus is better than verses

**xophrys** (5.5): can we get Kidz bop on this

**akanewasright** (5): huh!

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): In terms of the production and song composition it's top 10 in the rate. If only it wasn't the lyrical equivilant of ThisVid

**thesmokeylife** (5): A bit musically abrasive for me. I appreciate it but wouldn’t listen to it again.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Unholy on poppers

**DirtyRat583** (4.8): this is so earpiercing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): It seems to be camp…but I don’t enjoy listening.

**shhhneak** (4): These girls…

**vayyiqra** (4): oh uh I don't know if I'm uh the target audience for this one

**TheSheakDown** (3.5): The intro of this song deals psychic damage

**bogo** (3): i don't understand a thing she's saying and it's scaring me

**DefaultPophead** (3): Sounds good, I think, but my god I want to die...

**welcome2thejam** (3): Feels like 14 year old white boy humor re-packaged for a new audience

**seanderlust** (2): i love alaska but if i'm being honest this has aged like milk. that said, stream legendary from this album!

**TiltControls** (2): i just wrote anus

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): Alaska is spreading misinformation. There is no possible way for a pussy/bussy hole to shake, and if it does then you should probably get that checked out

**frogaranaman** (1): it is actually so embarrassing to listen to this while on the L (the gayest train)

I opted for this rather than any of Peppermint's more recent R&B stuff because her recent output is kinda boring imo, and also it was fun to include a drag classic that precedes drag race. A Johnny McGovern feature tag is the only thing that could make this rate gayer

---

### \*burp* but is it fashion?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): peppermint it’s ok I’m here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): is this hypnagogic pop, King which VHS tape did you pull this out from lmaooo how was Peppermint not on Noah’s Arc or something?? and JOHNNY MCGOVERN?! HEY QUEEN! the way one of my friends from college loved that song Soccer Practice byeeee. This is so 2000s NYC like LCD Soundsystem could never make something this camp, what a flop

**jay** (10): omfg i was like wow this song looks old just based on album art, i thought she was just fully committing to the older music aesthetic but 2006??? Okay britney! Gag them a bit

**RandomHypnotica** (10): she IS serving it up!!!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): She needs to win All Stars 9 so all the season 9 top four can have the crowns they deserve

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): when u watch this in "480p" thats rlly 144p with blown out bass, delirious and a lil' dehydrated at the airport...it hits. again, drag's mastery of early youtube aesthetics and know-how to make iMovie work...it paid dividends. im falling asleep rn.

**2RINITY** (9): "Dinner's served!" --3LW, *NBA Street (2001)*

**plastichaxan** (9): She’s so MOTHER

**seanderlust** (8.5): not jonny mcgovern...his gay pimp-era music still haunts me

**1998tweety** (8): oh I did not realize this was from 2006, is that the oldest in the rate?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): It’s so iconic that this is just a full five years older than anything else in the rate, and in that vein [I just wanna remind everyone what Peppermint’s website used to look like](https://web.archive.org/web/20141124061939/http://www.peppermintonline.com/). I dig the charmingly retro vibe but in terms of vintage Peppermint I prefer [“#DollaInMyTitty”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6ysY-1YncU) though.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this needs to be at like 1.1x speed.

**TiltControls** (8): you know what she IS servin it up!

**thesmokeylife** (7.4): Peppermint released this track years before she got on Drag Race, and it still holds up.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (7.3): hard to judge w the scuffed audio quality but it sounds good

**shhhneak** (7.1): Pepp deserves a better production team. It’s giving Fiverr.

**Stryxen** (7): old

**WaterMagician** (7): I enjoy Pep’s R&B tracks much more but this is still a fun dance track

**BaconShoes** (6.5): it’s a bit catchy I can dig it some

### RACE???

**runaway3212** (6): this being old and thus bad

**impla77** (5.7): this was v basic tbh, lack of personality for a legend like Peppermint

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The song isn’t too bad but why does it sound like it was recorded on a Zune?

**camerinian** (5): taking off petty points for the fact that the Spotify title capitalises "It" but not "up"

**frogaranaman** (5): no u weren’t

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): [bass boosted]

**MrSwearword** (5): "Dolla In My Titty" outsold this

**vayyiqra** (5): awfully produced but kind of catchy

**TheSheakDown** (4.7): awkward_king ily but you’re going to Hell for picking this as the song to represent Peppermint

**Pinheadbutglittery** (4): the mix is the stuff of nightmares

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (3): i find it amusing this is uploaded to an alternate profile with the name peppermint gummybear

**ricki** (3): mixed and recorded by meeeee:333

**uberpigeon** (3): this sounds like it was recorded on a wax cylinder from the 1800s

### white man rapper no flow call him lemon, bars so bad should be behind them like a felon

**welcome2thejam** (8): Sorry I'm not really paying attention I rewound the music video like fifteen times to watch that dude saying "Jonny McGovern exclusive" and he's all I can think about right now. Shit wait I got to the guest rapper and now he's the character of the day in my mind

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): this white boy rapping about slapping a thong in an asscrack is the original rapstress

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Wow that rap isn’t even good ironically

**babadork** (5.1): I keep thinking I underrated this because I forget about the featured rapper.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): WHY is there a WHITE MAN RAPPER on here

**flava** (3): she served up a rap verse from some colby o’donis wannabe

Idc idc this is a perfectly cute run of the mill tumblr 2015 pop song and she made points!!!

---

### i miss 2015

**ricki** (11): the worst part of trump becoming president was the death of the millennial upbeat pop songs about living life and making the most of the night. society literally needs nothing more than the comeback of yolo pop

**MrSwearword** (10): The After Party album is a slay from the bottom to the versatile bottom

**runaway3212** (10): apparantly she markets herself as a singer but like... she can't sing? im so confused

**BaconShoes** (9.8): TAAAAAAKE ME THEEEEEEREEE

**1998tweety** (9): where i will ascend

**fadedblue09** (9): actually a serve

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This slays, if she’d performed this on AS2 maybe they wouldn’t have had to bully her into quitting

**TiltControls** (8.5): is there the 2010s music scene?

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): this is just a katy perry song for better and for worse

**freav** (8): the verses are some of the best synth pop in this rate but this chorus is kinda bland

**jay** (8): its cute if this song was a guy on grindr personified id send a lil tap.. maybe even a hi

**thesmokeylife** (7.8): This is one of the most successful examples of ‘music by a drag artist’ so far. I could see this getting radio play.

**2RINITY** (7.5): Someday, this'll be the end credits music for a coming-of-age teen romance movie set in the mid-2010s, and every gay teenager hearing it for the first time will absolutely lose their shit

**impla77** (7.4): solid bop

**welcome2thejam** (7): This is the type of mid 2010s indie pop rock that peaks playing 2pm on the side stage at Lollapalooza

**BreeCherie** (6.9): summer radio hit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): didn’t expect drag Bonnie McKee but werk

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Me talking about Taco Bell.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): where

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): AI generated 2012 pop song

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The late-2000s-early-2010s-ness of it all

### the original drag race musician being out already kinda a gag

**akanewasright** (5): This exists I guess

**apatel27** (5): someone really likes teenage dream

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): Sure, why not! It’s cute, albeit a little plodding.

**frogaranaman** (5): gay people mini mix music vol. 2

**ImADudeDuh** (5): sean kingston ENDED HA!

**plastichaxan** (5): Sorry I slept why did I have this higher

**Stryxen** (5): okay!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): a song that exists

**vayyiqra** (5): boring

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (5): slightly less evil but god damn it this is an evil sound

**xophrys** (4): Miley Cyrus went off the tracks

**flava** (3): Adore reminds me of the type of pophead who believes music peaked with 2009-2010 electropop

**amr** (2): hate her voice

### vivaldi not even being eliminated after this was so skull emoji

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): DID I HEAR THE F SLUR IN DUTCH AT THE END????????? man what is going on in the Dutch Drag Race lmfao

**buddhacharm** (10): Holland deserves something idk but "YOU'VE BEEN FALSE FROM A TO Z" deserved more I think

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I didn't finish this season but Vanessa was fucking iconic for that (also this isnt the original nepa nepa wijf moment but idk if you know that)

**jay** (10): you are false from a to z... sob emoji x10

**RandomHypnotica** (10): why does dutch sound so funny lmao

**runaway3212** (10): this might look like drama but it’s actually 2 **Dutch** drag queens having a calm coversation

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Holy shit

**DefaultPophead** (9): please explain

**adeleade** (8.5): no this is genuinely great because its like vivaldi did not understand the power dynamic of sorts at play here and completely misread the situation and that really cost her so i really feel vanessas cuntiness here it rly shows that she is not to be played with bc if you argue with her then boom youre gonna be put in the bottom and sent the fuck home ngl they should defo have sent vivaldi home just to end this storyline well tho i have not seen the season itself so who knows rly

**nt96** (8): Nepa Know How

**impla77** (6.4): only one l haven't seen before... Didn't know this was how the phone scandal came to light

### the katyawasrobbed thing was so goofy like

**adeleade** (10): like i think its great both bc of the buildup and bc it completely shuts alaska down in a way if you think about it the reason why alaska underestimated katya can be linked to condecension and hence ego to some extent and then here we see it in full force with her throwing a tantrum about the possibility of being eliminated so this comeback of party really focuses on alaskas fatal flaw as told by the producers and therefore it just feels really witty to me like you thought you were so great all along but actually your flaws have always been hiding in the background waiting to get you its just so satisfying

**BaconShoes** (10): Katya is truly one of the best queens of all time like

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): katya owned this whole season!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): party.avi top 10 youtube video of all time

**jay** (10): my god id 11 if i could... this shook the earth so deeply to its core we distanced ourselves a lil further out of the suns gravitational pull

**MrSwearword** (10): Katya is sick for this

**nt96** (10): the fact that Katya doesn’t even remember saying this lol

**plastichaxan** (10): PLEASE

**runaway3212** (10): sure whatever

**seanderlust** (9): "…….okay."

**TiltControls** (9): party

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I will give this a ten if you give me ten thousand dollars, before taxes via pay pal

**RandomHypnotica** (7): party

**impla77** (6): Alaska looks like she's ready to kill

**shhhneak** (6): There would've been riots in the streets.

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): people literally threatened to kill Alaska for this

**buddhacharm** (1): so overrated and I do not want Katya to win a rate

What did you all do to my baby. This song is FUN it is pure JOY and CAMP look at what you did to my baby.

---

### LICK ME LOVE ME LEMON LIME

**freav** (11): okay i know that this is not winning and i don't expect it to do very well either, but this is my favorite song in the rate and it's not particularly close. i think that a lot of campy rpdr stuff can get very streamlined and I love how fun this one is in its own authentic way, but above it all the song itself it’s just so fucking good! I love the colorful midi-like synths, and this has more good hooks than a good portion of the rest of the rate combined (like the "lick me love me lemon lime" part wasnt even needed at all, but it is there and the song is better for it), and then river fucking kills it. the video compliments it very well too

**amr** (10): need TWICE to plagiarize this

**CrimsonROSET** (10): THE LIP SYNC WAS NOT SO BAD PRODUCTION I HATE YOU [INFINITY]

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): why can’t KKB be more like this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): she sounds like the hairdresser octopus from parappa the rapper

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9.1): the whole fact that drag is able to pervade throughout gamer spaces, animated spaces, and MUD spaces (like Second Life) warms my heart

**camerinian** (9): god I love it when you can hear how much a performer is smiling when they're in the studio. This is so infectious ~~even if River is giving nothing~~

**DefaultPophead** (9): This song would either be top five in Eurovision fan voting, or dead last.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8.9): FRUITYLICIOUS PARADISE SOOOOO FUN

**2RINITY** (8.5): She's serving *Space Channel 5* Sega Saturn prototype realness

**BaconShoes** (8.5): camp and catchy

**soupcereal** (8.5): Ginger Minj's Gummy Bear wishes. Feels like it's from a kids show in an alternate universe. I love the commitment.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this song terrorized my fyp for like 2 months

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): Oh now I want Froot Loops. I bet they spell it that way because they can’t legally call it “fruit."

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Was “My Pussy Is A Peach” ineligible, or…?

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): ngl this is just for how on point the music video is

**TiltControls** (7.5): they might not be able to lip sync but they can sure perform together

**thesmokeylife** (7.4): This has far more personality than a lot of drag songs of its type. It doesn’t overstay its welcome.

**adeleade** (7): i think i was really inclined to dislike it but i ended up having a lot of fun

**ignitethephoenix** (7): robbed from their seasons

**MrSwearword** (7): at least they're committed to the absolute mess that happened in that lipsync

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.9): its camp

**impla77** (6.4): another song l don't know the reason for existence

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): Cute, nothing too special but it gave me a smile and I’d bop again for sure

**nt96** (6): Indieheads after spending 5 minutes at Popheads

**ricki** (6): red velvet - red flavor

**welcome2thejam** (6): If I went back and uploaded this music video to 2000s youtube it'd be an instant certified meme classic

**TheSheakDown** (5.4): once you get past the first thirty seconds the rest of the song is really cute 😭

**frogaranaman** (5): I think I just blacked out for 2 minutes and 48 seconds

**nbapip** (5): the higher end of the ones who don't need to be making music

**freav** (10): i love cartoons and evidently always loved this one a lot, such a fun video too

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): this is just for the video

**MrSwearword** (10): Jinkx's music peaked here. At least the song and video both serve.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I’m not giving this a 10 for the video I’m not giving this a 10 for the video I’m not giving this a OMG STEVEN UNIVERSE!

**babadork** (8.6): If we were rating videos, this one would be the 11.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I really like Jinkx’s albums, this isn’t my favorite track but I think she makes good music. One of the best videos in the rate though, it’s so cute!

**plastichaxan** (8): The video really increases the score for this cause idk if I’d like it as much without it

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): top 1 video

**2RINITY** (7.5): Video's great, but it's carrying the song hard

**sufjancaesar** (7.5): Not crazy about this song tbh but the video slaps so hard

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): best music video in the rate

**flava** (7): playing guess the cartoon is making this song very tolerable

**welcome2thejam** (7): If we were rating the music videos it would be the easiest 11

**akanewasright** (6): this music video saved the song

**bogo** (4): wow this does not work at all without the video huh

**cremeebrulee** (3): this video deserves a better song

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (3): music video is cute but the song itself really does nothing much for me

### oh

**ImADudeDuh** (8): my favorite part of this song is going to the comments and seeing that this video was involved in youtuber animation drama because people thought she didn’t pay her animator for her work on this video

### chucky doll doing drag

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Feasted

**nt96** (9): Coffee & TVs yassified, more seductive sister

**TiltControls** (9): jinkx does jinkx things and slays

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8.9): very nice song i feel like it'd be perfect for a roadtrip to sing along to

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Wow love the old school instrumental vibe

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8): no dont do a bunch of cartoon styles. do drag.

**soupcereal** (7): Points for genre and Jinkx being a good singer in her little style.

**TheSheakDown** (7): Like being objective this is a well made song it just doesn’t appeal to my personal sensibilities at all whatsoever

**thesmokeylife** (6.8): Fun! I like the instrumentation!

**Stryxen** (6.5): I would have 11d her creep cover I'm being so serious

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Forgettable mid Act 1 song sung by a supporting character in a musical set in the 1950s core.

**musical\_pyn** (6): I appreciate the attempt to do something different but I don't think it actually works?

**runaway3212** (6): we love an alcoholism bop

**camerinian** (5.5): I don't get it. I love both of those things, occasionally at the same time, and yet I feel nothing about this song

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): I’m too sober for this I guess

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): take a sip every time Candace says mom

**buddhacharm** (4): Giving this a 4 because I resent Jinkx yeah...

**frogaranaman** (4): Drake when he was posting hentai on his story

**jay** (2): exactly what you think a jinkx song would sound like

**BaconShoes** (1): I don’t like this at all, and it’s especially weird knowing now that she had to give up drinking alcohol

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): not this dresden dolls ass Amanda Palmer ass song, BE GONE. And the Cal Arts style music video please be serious

**vayyiqra** (1): this went from dull to annoying quickly and the double-time part was even worse

### monet was robbed

**DirtyRat583** (4): now the song is fine. dont care for it. BUT JINKX........ oooooh i do not like her and i do not like ru paul either bc shes an enabler for jinkx and her boring forced-sillyness personality and i choose to believe ru only likes her bc she gives her a run for her money when it comes to the old bitch on drag race like if she was ever in a pantomime she'd be the grandma but just not endearing enough to make it a good grandma ughhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh and yes i am bitter about as7 she is such a meh drag queen like she cant sing she cant sew she cant slay but yet she is treated like she is the moment i 100% believe they did it to make me angry and to get more people talking about as7. it wasnt even a bad series like some bits on that are KUNTTTTTTTT like rajas dance? amazing. the shea v monet lipsync? their bussies were working overtime providing the slay water needed for that. i also believe viv should have got more but thats just bc i am british and want to see one of our own slay the show but oh well. >!and yet of everyone on that show they choose HER?? the world is in catastrophe.!< [rate hosts idk how to do spoilers and idk if it would fuck with the rate machine too so if u think any of this is a spoiler feel free to spoiler it. many thanks x and i hope none of u are jinkx stans because youre probably upset oops and also THANK YOU for putting her in the extras she needs to be humbled once in a while] [looking back over the post i see theres 1 host omg so sorry u have to deal with all this alone 😭😭😭😭 ur doing gods work keep it up king]

### where the hell my phone

**bogo** (11): i think this might have unlocked the inner theater kid i didn't know i had

**1998tweety** (10): vocal legend, shouldve won S7

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): One of the more interesting, catchy, and enjoyable songs in the rate, for me. I won’t even deduct any points for being a fuck-the-haters type song

**flava** (10): the drama, the flow, the way you just get caught up and swept into the flood (like the one currently happening where I live)

**jay** (10): she mothered

**nt96** (10): Disney soundtracks but if they slayyed and the princesses can say the B word

**freav** (9.5): this one goes hard i kinda love it

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7ua0Uc4UkxvbDCjVv5o2Xl now why did her label make their own fake “This Is Ginger Minj” playlist on spotify :skull:

**CrimsonROSET** (9): villain energy and it’s not just because of the 3 minutes of credits

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Finally a true slay

**welcome2thejam** (9): Ehhh you know, there's obviously a lot of places that could use improvement, but hell if that wasn't waaay more fun than I expected. Better than the sum of its parts

**xophrys** (9): musical theatre had a choke hold on them and I'm not pulling the curtain closed

**shhhneak** (8.5): She had me foxtrotting a bit I can’t lie.

**2RINITY** (8): How did I know *exactly* what sound she'd go for?

**camerinian** (8): this is the closest we're getting to a drag queen making ska so fuck it I'll take it (I wrote this before I heard the actual reggae song on the tracklist please don't @ me)

**MrSwearword** (8): Ginger's a good singer but the look with the mic in the video doesn't match the song.

**seanderlust** (8): ginger's voice sounds so nice against big band sound

**uberpigeon** (8): this is what trixie wishes she made

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8): a clapper

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): high school musical energy

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (7.1): a bit repetitive but its catchy!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Ginger is so talented, it’s weird that she doesn’t have better music.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): Wish the vocals were mixed higher and had a bit more stank in the chorus

**slimboyfriend** (7): It’s very Broadway goes pop rock and I can appreciate the transparency

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): come through broadway

**thesmokeylife** (7): Fun! Distinct from a lot of what we expect from drag music.

### ooh lala la la lala la

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Forgettable mid Act 2 song sung by a supporting character in a musical set in the 1950s core.

**frogaranaman** (5): Sherlock Holmes type beat

**ricki** (5): anyone else remembers that one britney song she made for the smurfs movie

**runaway3212** (5): this is a competent song but it does nothing for me

**TiltControls** (5): I like how it's different from the other tracks, but it's a little unmemorable tbh

**apatel27** (4.5): White Woman Motivation Music

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Tragic how some of these productions are wasted on music like this

**plastichaxan** (4.5): I don’t get how the great singers just end up with the most boring music lmao

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): (me with a theater degree) ugh the theater kid of it all

**impla77** (4): ..I mean she’s a good singer

**soupcereal** (4): You'd think Ginger could do better than this.

**vayyiqra** (4): can't decide if this kind of bangs or is boring nvm it's boring

**BaconShoes** (2): not for me sorry. i simply cannot vibe with this. It’s catchy though, but that makes it worse i fear since i don’t like it

**Stryxen** (1): this sounds like a filler hairspray song get me out of here

### AMERICA

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): i swear i used to be so OBSESSED with this and its still just as good as on first listen

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Monique always makes me laugh so much, we love her!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): oh this is gonna be stuck in my head again huh

**MrSwearword** (10): I quite literally had this as my most played Spotify song when it came out. Mo Heart is kind of the best singer of the RuGirls.

**plastichaxan** (10): Honestly I eat up everything Mo does I feel the ooh ah ah sensation

**Stryxen** (10): this has no reason being so good. Maybe it's a fluke or maybe maybe maybe mo heart is the talent of a generation with the ooh ah sensation

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9.8): got so sleepy i started hallucinating that monique could be a feature on an rxk nephew cut. i dont know if im just sleepy tbh. but at the start i felt that

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): Mo Heart you will always be the Oh Ah Ah Sensation

**2RINITY** (9): This is E-40 levels of rapping-as-method to put slang on the map. I like it, I respect it, that's power

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): One of the few songs to successfully take a forced meme and stretch it out for three minutes without making me jump for the skip button. Monique released a Christian music EP earlier this year that was actually pretty good, I like her voice.

**sufjancaesar** (8.5): BŁÜĘ

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): this was really the only song here that absolutely NEEDED me to look up the context

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I still don’t know what this means but she snapped

**runaway3212** (8): brown cow is a giraffe apparantly

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I’m curious what people with no context think brown cow is

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): eurodance rate when

**uberpigeon** (7): this is impressive for the fact it makes monets sponges not look forced

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Is she singing about an actual cow? Idk I don’t know anything about drag race

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.1): i dont think thats a real thing people say but slay

**bigbigbee** (6): brown cows make chocolate milk

**freav** (6): love monique but not an incredible song

**vayyiqra** (6): weird title but kind of a bop

**BaconShoes** (5.5): Another forced branding moment. It’s catchy though

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): me

**TheSheakDown** (5.4): If a song’s gonna be a gimmick it might as well be catchy

### girl its giraffe

**impla77** (5.2): song written purely for all stars talent show

**apatel27** (5): Jax Jones really gets everywhere

**camerinian** (5): you think this is meta commentary about milking a meme dry

**seanderlust** (4.5): rpdr confession time: i do not understand why brown cow stunning happened. i get the context from the show but like....this is not a line you can say without feeling like you're trying to make fetch happen

**frogaranaman** (4): this inspired that one Doja Cat song

**thesmokeylife** (3.4): I swear we’ve heard this same backing track in this rate at least 10 times.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I love Monique but this is one of the laziest examples of “turn RPDR meme into a song” in this rate and there’s a LOT of examples.

**jay** (2): the gay beats have ran its course and im tired of it at this point im sorry

**ricki** (1): let it be known that monique is one of the best characters to have graced the show and brown cown stunning was the moment, you had to be there. that said this is awful

Yvie is an amazing rapper and I know I'm right and I wish everyone else agreed with me. This beat is so fun, Vanessa's feature isn't technically great but is so fun, its a great hype song!

---

### the hype house

**fkadizzy-1804** (11): This has personality coming out the ears, obscene amounts of raw talent, AND amazing music. What more can I ask for?

**sufjancaesar** (11): One of the hardest songs in existence I fear

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is a city girls song but that probably explains why i’m shaking my ass

**Stryxen** (10): Yvie Oddly I love you

**2RINITY** (9.5): I have one thing to say: BARS

**babadork** (9.2): My score on this one might be slightly inflated, but Vanjie should be drag’s Lil Jon.

**BaconShoes** (9): Okay this made me wanna shake sum

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): ADHD anthem so trueeeeeee!!!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): “My Type” but even more boppy, I didn’t think that was possible

**welcome2thejam** (9): This is the most annoying person in the world (complimentary)

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): what in the cruella 2021 is this fit

**plastichaxan** (8.5): Yes you are girl

**soupcereal** (8.5): I appreciated the direction she took with the instrumental here.

**thesmokeylife** (8.4): Vanjie’s verse on its own would be at least a 9.5. The rest of the song can’t quite match its no-holds-barred energy.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8.3): u can put this on at any club

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Vanessa said my rap skills are questionable so I’m just going to yell and you know what I respect it.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): yvie is such an underrated winner/queen like ‘shake that ass to the left shake that pussy to the right’

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): “go beserk when I twerk in a skirt, not a damn thing shake”. Oh same

**runaway3212** (8): this the first competent drag rap I have ever heard, that said vanjie is not giving at all

**impla77** (7.2): Vanjie raps exactly how I would expect

### lil jon interlude

**BreeCherie** (7): lil jon was serving

**camerinian** (7): Vanjie serving Lil Jon adlibs is not something I knew I needed in my life

### back to programming

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is a surprisingly serviceable club song but it leans a bit too heavily on the stock standard drag race tropes to be truly great.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): In both the mv and the song, she comes 80% close to being an honest to god main pop girl

**jay** (7): its cute

**TiltControls** (7): this is pretty hype

**vayyiqra** (7): Very relatable as someone with ADHD who often needs medication to get through rates (not this one though! my comments are very low effort here !)

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (7): classic "i showed up to work" cut here

**uberpigeon** (6.5): they were in the same fucking hotel room in that phone call

**seanderlust** (6.3): REALLY don't like yvie's flow. miss vangie goes off

**1998tweety** (6): idk about this

**apatel27** (6): Beat needs to go harder

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i kinda like it oop

**frogaranaman** (4): how can you a name a song so boring this title

**MrSwearword** (4): Yvie can commit as their own hypeman. Vanjie is here too just like Season Twelve Snatch Game werkroom for some reason.

**TheSheakDown** (4): She fought the beat and lost

**xophrys** (3.5): I am traumatised from my trap music era and so simply can't listen to this

**shhhneak** (3): Crackhead media

### do main rap girls

**flava** (3.5): it's serving cardi b if she was influenced by rice gum

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): she wants to be doja cat so bad

Shea, Yvie & Bebe are three of my favourite queens of the franchise, so obviously my 11 had to go to a track that was the three of them brag-rapping about how talented and rich they are. Yvie holds down the song perfectly well, then Bebe and Shea absolutely slay their verses. It's just such a good track, the beat is infectious, the song is packed with smart references to the show, there's a theme to the song, it's so fucking good.

---

### the only bitch in this house i ever trusted watch drag race philippines 

**xedophobic** (11): I'm a winner, baby, it's the OG I stay on your mind, livin' there rent-free The first on the throne and the last of my breed I Dominique Devereaux-ed this dynasty The problem with most? They do it for likes I'm a problem for most 'cause I do what I like Can somebody tell me, what's the hype? Who cares about a crown when you're winnin' at life? Take your chop, your style is dodgy You Karate Kids, meet Mr. Miyagi Laid the blueprint, the machine-made copies I lapped the pack, now they're runnin' behind me They all want beef 'til I pass the brisket Still got the girls mad over a lipstick Winner-winner, chicken dinner, yeah, I'm ready to eat quick Birds under my wing, two-piece and a biscuit

### damn triple homo-

**adeleade** (10): the duality of winner collab songs lol did not expect to give this a ten at all but when it serves it serves the fact that shea is being outperformed by bebe and yvie here is really saying sth about the quality of this track

**bogo** (10): gonna be real funny when this loses by like 10 points

**musical\_pyn** (10): A song whose chorus is "winner winner chicken dinner" has no business being this good

**runaway3212** (10): lowkey this really gave

**soupcereal** (10): God tier. Every verse from every queen slaps. Catchy, clever, funny punchlines. Shea's verse was weakest on first listen but really grew on me over time. And Bebe... ate.

**Stryxen** (10): trixies rupaul snatch game was hilarious IDGAF also Yvie Oddly I love you

**sufjancaesar** (10): This automatically made them the best winners

**welcome2thejam** (10): Where we death dropping ladies

**uberpigeon** (9): THIS SONG SLAPPED ME IN THE FUKCING FACE!!!!!!!

**thesmokeylife** (8.8): This gets its score as a showcase for Yvie, Bebe and Shea’s verses; the chorus and beat are unremarkable.

**2RINITY** (8.5): Nice performances from the queens, but the beat feels like it's missing something

**1998tweety** (8): features ate

**CrimsonROSET** (8): take a shot everytime the ‘hot like a pepper’ like shows up in this rate

**DefaultPophead** (8): I can see Flo Milli covering this no lie

**kndight23** (8): BeBe outsold🤭

**plastichaxan** (8): Production could be better but these 3 will always deliver a slay verse wow

**vayyiqra** (8): this bangs

**BreeCherie** (7.8): Bebe carried

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): this cover is what ph rate covers would look like if nick didn't exist

**shhhneak** (7.7): I certainly hope you aren’t bragging about rubbing elbows with Elizabeth Warren.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): she knows how to write a hook

**WaterMagician** (7.5): i unfortunately feel like Shea and Bebe overshadowed Yvie on this one

### loser loser chicken snoozer

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): It’s giving kind of lit edgier H&M music but would still rather shop online

**jay** (7): i dont like this song at all but the cover art made me laugh at the photoshop so i add 5 points

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): need a metal remix of this

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): gay PUBG kids anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): i hate this phrase and the song isn't good enough for me to overcome this phobia unfortunately </3

**xophrys** (6.5): my housemate is weird and gets a headache from chicken nuggets and after listening to this song i think i do too

**impla77** (6.2): Wish I could rank this higher for Bebe’s verse, but Shea is just stating her CV and Yvie is trying too hard to list all the crowned queens

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Bebe has such a distinctive voice that projects so much personality, she really stands out on this track. The rest is really cringe though.

**MrSwearword** (6): at least the production is good

**TheSheakDown** (6): I PROMISE I like Yvie but Shea & Bebe ate her up so hard good lord

**TiltControls** (5.5): songs about winning haven't had the best luck this year

**apatel27** (5): haha its the fornite thing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I don’t hate this but it’s definitely not winner material.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): winner winner, five chicken dinners

**BaconShoes** (4): I love everyone here, but this is kinda all over the place idk

**frogaranaman** (3): this is not gonna be the winner winner

**fadedblue09** (2): definitely doesn't sound like a winner to me

**flava** (2): the epitome of forced camp

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): is this supposed to be funny

**DirtyRat583** (1): this sounds like kpop

### who is stacey

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Yeah okay he beat Stacey twice but did he have to produce a whole song about it

It's so funny that Valentina's legacy on the show is not being able to lip-sync, not defending the other queens from her fans and being delusional, and she's still so cunty like!

---

### WERK FAN FAVOURITE

**1998tweety** (10): she DEVOURED this

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): FAN FAVORITE

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): even her cover is yassified lol u have to commit yourself completely to making mid as fuck pop and have it just barely land as a 10.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): honestly this makes sense of course she can sing well

**BreeCherie** (8.6): come on vocals

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Remember her trying to sing during Rent Live!? A simpler time.

**TiltControls** (8.5): giving this a good score and praying the lyrics aren't the spanish equivalent of Oops I Think I Pooped

**impla77** (8.3): I don't know what the fuck She's saying but girl I'm living

**plastichaxan** (8): Latinas won but I also hate Valentina fans so what now

**runaway3212** (8): we love a smash

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Lol at least she remembered the words this time! Get it? I was referencing when she forgot the words to the Greedy lip-sync in Season 9 and was subsequently eliminated.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): oh i know who she is! unfortunately it's because of her lsfyl

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): OMG I love Gazelle’s follow up to “Try Everything”!!

**freav** (6.7): latin-american AM radio core

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): DRAG RACE MEXICO IS COMING SOON

### you dont love me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): the autotune on this one hurts

**2RINITY** (6): No tea, no shade, no pink lemonade, but this shit is CHEESE. Not just any cheese, either--this sounds like it shoulda dropped around 2004, charted low-40s/high-50s in five random European countries, *maybe* scraped the top 20 in Italy or Spain, then silently bombed stateside because it was just too cheesy to survive

**jay** (6): its cute

**fkadizzy-1804** (5.6): The instrumental interlude and mini-verse(?) that came after it was cute. The rest was... fine?

**RandomHypnotica** (5.3): somehow this sounds more eurovision than the literal eurovision song in the rate

**BaconShoes** (5): I don’t particularly enjoy the production

**elite4\_beyonce** (5): i was so bored

**frogaranaman** (5): idk why but I feel like Selena Gomez would release something like this

**MrSwearword** (5): una cancion que no tiene caracter

**Stryxen** (5): valentiiiiina your smile is beautiful

**vayyiqra** (5): idk ok im so tired i want to go to bed, many are begging me to go to bed,

### this was so robbed like... i think about this every single day of my life

**jay** (10): I still say "get her jade" to this day omfg its seriously timeless.... #ShouldersShouldMatchThemHips

**MrSwearword** (10): Jade Jolie starting this shit and giving Alyssa her best line? Icon shit

**plastichaxan** (10): Two s5 moments iktr this season was peak untucked

**sufjancaesar** (10): Deserves a 10 for how much i use the meme on discord

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): We get so much out of the Alyssa-Coco/Jade feud, iconic from start to finish

**seanderlust** (9.5): #ShouldersShouldMatchThemHips

**chihkeyNOPE** (9): #ShouldersShouldMatchThemHips

**nbapip** (9): dragula season 4 sneak peak

**nt96** (9): Kitana when her bestie kicks Mileena's ass

**RandomHypnotica** (9): as someone with no context the random shots of the queen in the superbass wig sends

**TiltControls** (8.5): oh god I forgot how bad the drag race hashtags used to be

**buddhacharm** (8): not because this was particularly influential but to this day I literally always say "i was thinking it, Jade says it" and no one knows what I'm talking about

**ImADudeDuh** (8): taylor swift's fatphobia started earlier than we expected

**shhhneak** (8): Tell me you've never done the little head swivel and said "back rolls? in Alyssa's voice. You can't.

**impla77** (7.2): Jade has iconic drama in two franchises... Pretty good going for the sweetest girl you'll ever meet

**adeleade** (7): tbh is kind of overrated like the editing and stuff doesnt make it feel very realistic like maybe back rolls would feel better if it were the climax to a rising action or wtv but it just feels like a sudden escalation and then silence like it isnt giving the peaks and valleys i need

**BaconShoes** (6): not my favorite of the moments, but pretty iconic

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Coco is one of the best contestants to ever grace Drag Race, bring her back somehow I need more from her.

**runaway3212** (4): boring

**ImADudeDuh** (10): QUEEN

She's giving theatre!! She's giving storyline. Yeaaa. Aeowww. I'm Beyoncé

---

**CrimsonROSET** (10): perhaps points were made

**plastichaxan** (10): This is so current like y’all better not rob this

**2RINITY** (9): Lives up to its namesake

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): bitch you look like Luther Vandross

**BreeCherie** (8.5): when she said she was beyonce i believed her

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.5): Bassline is on fire, attitude is right, lyrics are excellent, and it’s taking itself just seriously enough which is of course not at all. Loved it.

**1998tweety** (8): beyonce sweetie

**seanderlust** (8): james william ross iv be like

**soupcereal** (8): Certainly good. The instrumental works. I just wish it felt more like Monet than Beyonce. Like, Beyonce wouldn't make a song called I'm Beyonce, you know?

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8): so true

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Unfortunately this is my least favorite song on this EP, “There For You” deserved

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): bitch I’m Mr. Krabs

**xophrys** (7.5): bzzzz

**frogaranaman** (7): idk how to describe why I feel this way but MySpace caused this I think

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): does her flow sound like Britney's on Work Bitch to anyone else

**vayyiqra** (7): lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): She may have legs like Beyoncé, but does she give the eye like Rihanna?

**BaconShoes** (6.5): BEYONCE???

**camerinian** (6.5): I mean I appreciate trying to manifest a freaky Friday type scenario but

**Stryxen** (6.5): what do you do successfully … quickly

**TiltControls** (6.5): Monet trying to channel the spirit of 4-time rate winner Beyonce into her for good results

**TheSheakDown** (6): Todrick hall if he had talent

### bitch im... latavia?

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): and I’m Madonna uh huh. I don’t care what they say about us anyway, I don’t care about that ~

**jay** (5): ouuu..

**MrSwearword** (5): The beat is cute but the song falls apart once they force the Solang-ay rhyme, giving will.i.am truncated flow

**thesmokeylife** (5): I can’t quite tell if this song wants to be taken seriously or not.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (4.5): i appreciate all the references but the song doesn't do it for me idk none of the components work for me

**impla77** (4.3): certifiably false. TKB is Beyoncé

**DirtyRat583** (4): this beat is not serving! im sorry! this ufo ass sound is the wrong one

**ricki** (4): \*Tiffany Pollard voice* 212 BY AZEALIA BANKS??!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): beyoncé sweetie im so sorry

**shhhneak** (2): child speaking outro…

**flava** (1): this isnt a song, even by the standards set by this rate

### bey PLEASE

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Monet X Change vs RENAISSANCE????

**runaway3212** (8): this is a cut from renaissance beyoncé told me personally

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): the way i was gonna make a renaissance joke for the last song and then THIS came up next . i was cackling

**ImADudeDuh** (7): so release the Renaissance visuals.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I wouldn’t be surprised if Monet has performed Renaissance more than the woman herself at this point.

When Trixie first said she was releasing music I don't think people expected her to be like actually making music music. Anyway I don't like this.

---

### mama please spin it one more time

**amr** (10): she was so transmasc vibes for this one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Vote for (literally any country rate I don’t care what) next cycle!

**bogo** (10): yee, and i cannot stress this enough, haw

**celladonn** (10): There's just something about this, it's one of the most memorable songs of the rate for me

**freav** (10): country music is good. i love this song, that one minor chord is exquisite

**nt96** (10): Going from opera to honky-tonk country caused me whiplash and boy do I LOVE IT

**plastichaxan** (10): Kinda camp that this is the type of country music I like

**CrimsonROSET** (9): pink one made some points

**BaconShoes** (8.5): It’s a jam tbh

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A yeehaw song? I'm listening

**thesmokeylife** (8.5): I appreciate that this goes for earnestness and storytelling.

**WaterMagician** (8.5): this track somehow feels so intensely personal and still beautifully relatable

**2RINITY** (8): If this wasn't Trixie's first single, I would think she was publicly torching her persona and quitting drag forever

**BetteDavid** (8): R.I.P. Leslie Jordan :(

**kndight23** (8): I love Trixie’s folk music because it’s obviously such a unique sound for a drag artist. It’s clear she really cares about her work and authenticity.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): why is this better than any other country song ive ever heard

**welcome2thejam** (8): This is probably gonna get wrecked, but good stuff

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): hope she performs this at stagecoach

**impla77** (7.4): sweet song

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): this is too pleasant to call cuntry but it's too good of a pun to skip

**1998tweety** (7): cute

**MrSwearword** (7): cute and possibly the most palatable of Trixie playing Conway Titty.

**ricki** (7): trixie, arguably the biggest name the franchise has birthed, singing about how she fucking hates doing drag. icon

**adeleade** (6): i would love to put on a dress for daddy

**akanewasright** (6): yeah this is okay country pastiche

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): RIP Leslie Jordan

**fkadizzy-1804** (6): Look it’s a very nicely-composed, catchy, traditional country song and her voice is lovely but it’s just sorta bland

**frogaranaman** (6): I think this is what a Kelsea Ballerini and Kacey Musgraves collab would sound like

**ignitethephoenix** (6): a bit too yee haw for me but Trixie has a good voice

**musical\_pyn** (6): I was not prepared for leslie jordan to be in this video :(

**Stryxen** (6): a minor slay

### mama dont make me listen to this song again

**TheSheakDown** (5): I’m sure this song did something for someone but I’m not that someone

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Wait this is just straight-up country. It’s not even fabulous country, just plain ol’ country. Why Trixie?? Also it’s incredibly unsettling that the dude in the video literally died the other day, idk much about who you are but you seem fun, rest in peace Leslie.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (4.5): i don't know if its because of the genre but i can't vibe with this sadly! u can tell trixie had fun w this song tho

**runaway3212** (4): chrissy from stranger things be like

**xophrys** (3.5): if I can dress up as a woman you can

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Trixie’s music is so weird because she’s a strong songwriter with a clear point of view but also she sounds like she’s reading a cookbook.

**jay** (3): :/

**flava** (2.5): love country music

**cremeebrulee** (2): King Don’t Make Me Listen to this Song Again

**vayyiqra** (2): Being countryphobic here sorry I don't hate country but don't want to hear it right now

### malibu babie

**shhhneak** (11): Vibes are immaculate. This made my top songs in the Spotify Wrapped the year it came out and I can’t even lie.

**1998tweety** (10): ended kim petras

**runaway3212** (10): shoutout to the terrible book I read that at one point described the penis of the main male love interest as "He's definitely no ken doll"

**sufjancaesar** (10): When I’m irritated by Trixie (frequently) I listen to this to remind myself that she’s an icon here and there

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): oh this is more fun than i remember

**freav** (9): we*zer

**kndight23** (9): Similarly to above the 60s-inspired music is truly refreshing!

**seanderlust** (9): MALIBU BABY HA!!!!

**TiltControls** (9): the better song about a city by trixie mattel

**welcome2thejam** (9): Oh shit y'all got power pop in here too? Damn, drag rate has everything

**2RINITY** (8.5): One fun thing about this rate, as a drag newbie, was I got to learn how recently Trixie picked up the pop-rock sound I knew her for

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8.3): her vocals sound a lot better here than in the last one! it sounds like it'd be perfect for a kids movie soundtrack lmao

**BreeCherie** (8.2): when the bridge hits

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Wait Malibu is in California? I thought it was in Florida this whole time. Good for it…

**thesmokeylife** (7.4): I like this. It would be better with a live arrangement.

**BaconShoes** (7): it’s a bit fun

### maliboo tomato tomato

**impla77** (6.8): This is the straightest song on the rate

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (6): no

**bogo** (5): this song makes me wanna buy a ford fiesta and drive through the mountains

**cremeebrulee** (5): malibu must be boring as fuck for all the uninteresting songs it inspires

**frogaranaman** (5): I’m sorry I am doing this rate while on the subway home and I just saw a Grubhub ad with a Drake look alike and lost my train of thought

**xophrys** (4.5): adding this to my alcoholism playlist with the rest of my drinks cabinet.

**fadedblue09** (4): sounds too heterosexual for this rate

**jay** (4): im really not gagged omfg whats the antonym of gagged 😭😭

**vayyiqra** (4): I did not sign up for boring 90s pop-rock

**flava** (2): song so plastic it was torn off of beyoncé’s sofa

### cannot sing allegations

**MrSwearword** (8): as new wave/surf rock as this is, Trixie's voice is a bit too flat to match up to the energy

**TheSheakDown** (6.7): Trixie is great at writing catchy hooks. I just wish she would give those hooks to other artists and didn’t reserve those hooks for her subpar production and moderate vocals

**camerinian** (6): this is like perfectly fine radio pop, but is it really working to Trixie's strengths? Ehhhh

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I think this was her attempt to make her music a little bit more yass and slay and I appreciate the effort but her voice just sinks this track

**slimboyfriend** (6): The problem I have with most drag music is the vocals tend to be more showtunes and less pop

**Stryxen** (5): you can tell she is giving her ALL in these vocals and it still sounds so… 💀

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): the way this would be such a good song if she actually tried to sing properly at all

### do land

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i love hannah montana

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is just Disney channel music (complimentary)

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I love you miley

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this is just a Cars song (compliment)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This feels like it would be right at home in the Disney Channel rate

**ricki** (6.5): Disney channel original singing crew goes to the beach episode

### do cartoon tunes

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): this sounds like the Counting Crows song from Shrek

**plastichaxan** (7): I commented that this sounds like a Shrek soundtrack song on YouTube years ago and still get replies to that comment maybe I just saw the vision

Im so proud of you popheads, for the first time since conception you finally did it! You let an actual rate winner win a rate. Im shedding a tear as i write this actually, i couldnt be more proud of you all. I feel like a parent sending their kid off to an ivy league university, like i was just told youre getting married in the fall with the location being rome italy, as if i just heard the news that youre with child and youre naming it Madison to pay homage to Mrs. Elle Beer herself.... thank you all for making history and reminding old raters what it truly means to rate. No acts of sabotage, no intentional low scoring to spite others you may dislike, no PayPaling rate hosts to rig the ballots in favor of your own desires and motives. We all as a collective came together and agreed that yes! Ding Dong by Katya Zamolodchikova featuring Trixie Mattel is in fact the best song out of 66 other fierce competitors... i love U popheads ❤️ thank you

### oh come in

**amr** (10): we need katya to play katya's long lost twin sister in goncharov 2 return of the gonch

**Stryxen** (10): the most shameless We Need Something To Perform At Our Shows Product ever but. It slays I'm sorry Katyalism (katya capitalism) wins today

**uberpigeon** (10): this freeze dried my foot off

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): reminds me of those gmod videos i watched that used the "oooo u touched my tralalala my ding ding dong" ditty

**2RINITY** (8.5): Rare footage of Katya actually being Russian

**TiltControls** (8.5): both this and the original's music videos are must-watches

**MrSwearword** (8): they turned that moment from Like to Watch into a song. Katya's crazy is the plus, but "Come in Brazil" is better use of her wacko

**1998tweety** (7.5): i dont know what shes saying but im living

**elite4\_beyonce** (7.5): love that EP

**xophrys** (7.5): SHE NOT RUSSIAN????

**DirtyRat583** (6.6): this would go CRAZY on radio zet

**BaconShoes** (6): not entirely sure what was happening here, but it was kinda catchy

### trixya uwuwu mommies

**frogaranaman** (6): I’m actually surprised this is the first electro-swing song in this rate. thought this would be more of the rate

**kndight23** (6): Don’t totally get Trixie’s purpose on this lol

**ricki** (6): nugu girl group debut song

**TheSheakDown** (6): Begrudgingly catchy

**vayyiqra** (6): uh I want to like this for Slavic pride and all but why did it randomly bring up The Silence of the Lambs that was weird

**welcome2thejam** (6): I feel like that erased something very important in my brain and hopefully we'll find out what someday

**runaway3212** (5): sure why not

**thesmokeylife** (3.2): Would be lower, but Katya is clearly in on the joke.

**impla77** (2.5): ??

**cremeebrulee** (2): i was so bored

**fkadizzy-1804** (2): At this point in the rate all the subpar electropop/electroclash/europop/whatever you wanna call them songs really started to blur together so I’m probably rating this more harshly than it deserves relative to the rest of my scores but my god I’m tired

### fighting the eurovision rate accusations and LOSING

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): you know i have to give this a 10 out of eurovision solidarity the fact this is a homage to ukraine’s iconic 2009 performer svetlana loboda??? everyone stream be my valentine asap

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): User whose only exposure to Eurovision is doing the Eurovision rate: Getting a lot of Eurovision vibes from this

**musical\_pyn** (6): this is so eurovision coded

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): for such an iconic queen this song is kinda... ok, it's very forgettable eurovision core

**GlialUreterostenosis** (4): last place in Eurovision

**flava** (3): this should’ve been in Eurovision, no i don’t care if KATYA is american

### fighting... tiktok rate accusations???

**ImADudeDuh** (7): why does this sound made for tiktok (I say that because i hear this on tiktok a bit)

God I hate to admit that this song really is good. Literally all of Bimini's other music is abysmal too but she went off with this Britpop club pastiche

---

### cock knee

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (11): this rules omg omg omg can they play gonerfest i wanna mosh to this. or can we get a sleaford mods crossover? at least have my 11!

**celladonn** (10): oi luv 💅

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Sleaford Mods if they slayed

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I’d rather have Bimini ruling over us than the King

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): Oh now this slaps. The production isn’t groundbreaking but it’s cute and fun. The vocals and energy are just addictive. Great message. Oozing with personality. A+.

**flava** (10): god spent all his energy saving this queen that she couldn’t save the Queen

**plastichaxan** (10): Bimini really has me singing British nonsense for like 3 minutes

**runaway3212** (10): king including this so we give british people more rights

**shhhneak** (10): Unironically love the lyricisms in this, very much main character energy. Some of these girls need to hire her album art designer.

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): oi!

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.5): release the beast BIMINI

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The anglophobia leaving my body as I listen to this bop.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): damn it I like this I didn’t want to

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): there is now officially one british person who has rights

**BreeCherie** (8.9): it’s a bop innit

**2RINITY** (8.5): The only British royal I'll tolerate

**BetteDavid** (8): bimini's music is over-hated imo

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (7.8): sounds like a 2000s song its pretty fun

**BaconShoes** (7.5): abolish gender so true

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): camp and non binary anthem

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): idk I just like their accent

**apatel27** (7): Yassified Mike Skinner

### do u think they mentioned they were vegan?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): The rapping is great but wow even autotune couldn’t save the singing.

**nt96** (7): Vote for Her Majesty's Noughtronic Dancefloor!

**ricki** (7): what's up with so many drag queen songs sounding like Disney channel originals

**uberpigeon** (7): lily allens f\*g hag song did more for queer rights

**welcome2thejam** (7): Is this Windmill?

**thesmokeylife** (6.1): Bimini deserved better.

**adeleade** (6): ugh

**jay** (6): hm okay

**kndight23** (6): The lyrics are… weird… but it’s a pleasant surprise knowing Bimini’s track record with music is rocky

**Pinheadbutglittery** (6): we do live in a society

**vayyiqra** (6): lol it gets some points for committing to the bit

**seanderlust** (5.3): do you think she's british

**buddhacharm** (5): https://www.instagram.com/p/ClIQDTDNjAO/

**akanewasright** (4.5): This is the most nauseatingly British thing in the rate edit: never mind the frock destroyers are worse

**soupcereal** (4): I can appreciate this as like, a distillation of everything Bimini's brand is. I think the major flaw is Bimini's voice just talking. It's just not a voice that's easy to work with. Also I don't care for "God Save This Queen" as a title or tagline.

**MrSwearword** (3): Bimini as a singer is clearly a model

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (3): what the heck

**1998tweety** (1): i almost took my 0 off for this song. some queens should NOT do music. Y'all are nice for not using Tommy's Dream cause that has got to be one of my least fav ru girl songs EVER. Lawrence washed.

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): the accent i cant

**TheSheakDown** (0): People claim Bimini’s politics are performative but she’s the first artist to clearly make music with the deaf in mind ❤️

### damon albarn

**freav** (10): damon albarn in shambles

**Stryxen** (10): THANK YOU FOR SAVING BRITPOP BIMINIIIII I HATE DAMON ALBARN

### slowthai

**xophrys** (9.5): slowthai's cousin took poppers

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): cher lloyd x slowthai energy

**frogaranaman** (8): is this slowthai

### blur

**impla77** (8.5): we love a parklife x lily allen mashup

**camerinian** (8): fuck I wish Bimini just spent the whole song committing to a drag/NB take on Parklife. You have no idea how hard of an itch that would scratch

### yungblud

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Is this what Yungblud thinks he’s doing

I think it is so incredible that this song is actually like, so good, not that I didn't expect it to be we know Fame can sing but like... why is it actually good?

---

### cluck cluck

**buddhacharm** (10): mother goose idgaf

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the gag that Miss Fame actually makes good music, who was scared? I was

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Fame’s album had no business being as good as it was

**ImADudeDuh** (10): robbed of being in the first charity rate, fuck Heaven is a Place on Earth

**MrSwearword** (10): didn't expect this from Miss Fame back when it was released but I was so happy to see them serve such charged imagery.

**plastichaxan** (10): Oh Violet Chachki you’re done

**runaway3212** (10): we love a good song finally

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): She took 3 puffs of the mother mist before stepping into the studio

**thesmokeylife** (10): One of the most underrated songs to come out of RuPaul’s Drag Race, ever.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): rock on

**BetteDavid** (9): the rent was due

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Yassified Stretch Armstrong.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): where was any of this in S7

**nbapip** (9): violet wishes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): this is a lady gaga song

**freav** (8): fairly good electropop nicely done

**uberpigeon** (8): shes like if violet had no idea how to be sexy

**impla77** (7.9): good production on a drag race song 😮

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): this sounds like a born to die song (derogatory)

**2RINITY** (7.5): Well-produced, high effort, but missing an X-factor I can't quite place

**camerinian** (7.5): credit for a better hook than most of these queens could be bothered to muster up

**1998tweety** (7): ended plastic doll by gaga

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6.9): i feel like an idiot idk what this songs about but it sounds cute

### i cant hear anything in this in this muff

**adeleade** (6): i am sorry gay people

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I keep hearing rubber duck

**vayyiqra** (6): sure

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Other queens have better kinky songs

**seanderlust** (5.5): This sounds like a scrapped demo from chromatica that even little monsters are glad didn't make the final cut

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): Even when I appreciate certain aspects of it, I really just do not vibe with this style of music, which is unfortunate for me because it seems to be very popular among drag queens

**nt96** (5): fitting name cuz its flopping like one

**BaconShoes** (4): not that bad, but not that good either

**jay** (4): hm okay

I'll defend this song with my life I genuinely do not care, the video is phenomenal it's so well styled, and Shea has some amazing bars on this. I've been a fan since before drag race and she'd semi-released/teased this song

---

### DO MAIN RAP GIRLS!!!

**cremeebrulee** (11): good to know that alternate universe me that's into drag race would have ended up with the same username

**bogo** (10): do main rap girls

**plastichaxan** (10): Rates have gotten too far like the layers of having a song named after a rater omfg

**uberpigeon** (10): my favourite rater

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): how can i not support my cohostie

**CrimsonROSET** (9): do we think shea likes The Weeknd

**vayyiqra** (9): Gotta be one of my favourite desserts and Popheads users (hi u/cremeebrulee)

**welcome2thejam** (8): We're all looking at creme right now like she got called to the principal's office

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): no I will not tag the user who does rates with their name like everyone else in these comments (love you twinsie)

**seanderlust** (6.3): a song about creme omg

**TiltControls** (6): omg @creme!?!?!?!

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): what creme said

### HER SEX SMOOTHER THAN A MOTHERFUCKING CREME BRULEE

**sufjancaesar** (10): Mother.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.2): i can't say much, shea always slays

**1998tweety** (9): iconic

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9): i think everyone here did a good job and gave it their all.

**thesmokeylife** (8.5): I would’ve liked more focus on Shea’s vocals; the production is a little too busy for my taste.

**xophrys** (8.5): pussy is in your area

**DefaultPophead** (8): I can shake my left and right ass cheek separately from each other. With song, I'm going left right left right with the beat. Is this considered exercise?

**ImADudeDuh** (8): when she said “You be zack” i really thought she was gonna follow it up with “you be cody”

**soupcereal** (8): Strong but unfortunately not on the same level as Cocky. I'd love for Shea to reach the same heights Cocky was at but. Well maybe it's just too good to be beat.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): She’s pretty good

**impla77** (7.5): didn’t know Crème Brûlée had so many accents

**2RINITY** (7): Fine, but it'd get lost big-time in a real house mix. Producer needs to step it up

**Stryxen** (7): slèyed as âlwéeys

**BaconShoes** (6.5): Kinda all over the place, but it’s fun

### happy about the rose petals

**jay** (6): what is this mixing 😭 she hired izone j-discog producers

**TheSheakDown** (6): Some of these bars are kinda corny I fear

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): i have to give her props for having the balls to reference party rock anthem in 2018, she was so real for that

**apatel27** (5): So low energy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I respect how much this is trying to do but also it may be trying to do too much.

**dream\_fighter2018** (5): who’s out here always party rocking like LMFAO?

**frogaranaman** (5): good desert

**runaway3212** (5): this is so not memorable

**MrSwearword** (4): she's not afraid of color in the music video so there's that. Musically, I was bored with their nonchalant delivery instead of thinking "oh this has a point"

**fkadizzy-1804** (3): Sorry but this song feels like it could have just not happened and none of us would be worse off for it. Anemic is the word that springs to mind.

### kicked OUT of #shea-therapeé

**buddhacharm** (5): I cannot in good faith give this song the score I want to give it because some of the bars are actually like so insane. Keep in mind I had to have king make a server and a channel called #shea-therapeé on Discord for him, myself and suf because we were so dedicatedly delusional to Shea that we needed space to cope throughout AS5 and AS7 💀 so me lowballing this is kind of revolutionary yeah...

### ~~anyway~~

~~**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I keep bringing this up but every time I think about Shea I just remember that time that she started sucking up to Azealia Banks to get a collab and her fanbase called her out for it so Shea cussed them out and said she didn’t care what they thought, but then people messaged Azealia old tweets Shea made insulting her and so when Shea flew out to the studio Azealia just ghosted her.~~

my Adore Delano opinions are strong because I was fucking obsessed with her as a 14 yr old trans girl

Awkward_King: no thats v fair, in retrospect i kinda wish i included after party instead of take me there, my biggest priority was representing her three distinct "eras" in my mind (her first two albums and then something punk that she's been doing since like 2017) but youre right the song selection wasnt perfect. a lot i would change about the songlist if i went back but also i think im just overthinking it because it would barely change anything sjkfewn

iAmNotKateBush: >a lot i would change about the songlist if i went back but also i think im just overthinking it because it would barely change anything sjkfewn

yeah see I have all these opinions but after party would be what, 2 spots higher maybe? lol. the song list for this rate could be have a million different iterations and it still wouldn't please everyone

team yet another dig!!!
