This was top 2 for the first like 10/15 ballots I really thought it'd be competition until all the comments calling it commercial music came in and it fell...

---

### i love the contrast between these two 11 comments

**2RINITY** (11): Bi tangent, everybody! Bi tangent! So this was the rare song I already knew because Rocket League gave it away in a pack of free player anthems for this year's Pride. It didn't instantly grab me, but it was the punchiest option I had, and I was down for anything that'd get me away from the default tracks. And then something funny happened--after over a year of being complete trash at the game, I finally started improving. I found the right car, fixed the camera, started positioning for plays instead of ballchasing 24/7, and learned to execute better on shots, passes, demos, anything the team might need to help get a W. Except aerials, fuck aerials, that shit's too complicated. I'm still only a Gold rank, but I'm better at Rocket League now than I ever thought I'd be, and while I doubt this song *caused* me to get better, it became so inseparable from the journey that I kinda operant-conditioned myself to love it. I've unlocked a bunch of other anthems since then, and I've tried them all out, but after a couple matches, I always switch back. There's just nothing else that sounds as hilariously conceited when other people's fuckups somehow get me the MVP, or as triumphant when I score an absolute screamer from midfield to take the lead with less than 10 seconds left. It's also probably responsible for me even voting in this rate--finding it meant learning who Trixie Mattel was, which led to me seeking out *UNHhhh*, which hooked me enough that I finally gave Best Friends Race a shot so I'd understand Trixie and Katya's references to the show. But more than anything, "Hello Hello" is the sound of me warning my opponents that I'm just the kind they can't ignore, because if they let me take over the match, I *will* play hard, I *will* keep shooting to wring as much XP out of the blowout as possible, and I *will* drill this song into their heads until they can't sleep because peppy throwback surf-pop haunts their nightmares. If that's not worth an 11, then frankly, I don't know what the fuck is

**babadork** (11): My favorite of her songs is her cover of “Blister in the Sun,” but this is a pretty close second.

### what do you mean "what hypno said"? why is hypno in it???

**1998tweety** (10): twice as good as Adele's

**MrSwearword** (10): new wave realness which compliments Trixie's flat vocal delivery oh so well

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this exists in that fantastic intersection of IPR core and apple commercial core

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): what hypno said

**BaconShoes** (9): catchy bop

**impla77** (8.3): I didn’t know she was out of her country era, this is a bop.

**amr** (8): hoku perfect day for girls whose elle woods is trixie mattel

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): this is like Miley going from that country flop album to plastic hearts

**camerinian** (7): 🎵 keep on whispering in my ear 🎵

**CrimsonROSET** (7): goodbye

**frogaranaman** (7): this sounds like it’d get a TV show sync on a Grease spinoff

**ImADudeDuh** (7): she really reverse engineered What I Like About You on this one

**plastichaxan** (7): I would like to like this more but anyway

**Stryxen** (7): okay but adore delano hello i love you could have won

**TheSheakDown** (6.5): See Mama Don’t Make Me Put on the Dress Again

**thesmokeylife** (6.3): It’s a fun pop song. The production throws me off.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): The personality has left the building.

**runaway3212** (6): maybe she's just kinda average

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (5.8): i own beauty and the beat and monomania on tape. im fine thanks

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (3.9): i don't think her voice fits this type of song unfortunately! production feels pretty underwhelming as well

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): background ass Scooby Doo chase scene music (derogatory)

**TiltControls** (3): its giving filler american idol performance (no offence adore)

**musical\_pyn** (2): how did they find men tall enough for this

**jay** (1): these last 4 songs felt like sleep paralysis omfg i was frozen i couldnt move but im finally free from the shackles, i broke out in a sweat and cried myself back to sleep but i reached the end of the tunnel

### are you SURE this isnt new wave giants

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): if Blondie - Hanging On the Telephone actually slayed

**celladonn** (9): I was completely convinced this was a cover of some classic song which I guess is a compliment

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.2): Evidently I like pop-rock Trixie a lot more than country Trixie

**freav** (6.5): while malibu is a great weezer song, this is a rather bad one, it's still fun though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): trixie mattel for the next new wave giants rate

**soupcereal** (4): I appreciated Trixie going into the 60s 70s era aesthetically but. I mean. The song is ok

**vayyiqra** (4): I said no to mid pop-rock and this is just a Kinks song but worse

### apple music commercial ass music

**welcome2thejam** (7): We're all hearing Apple commercial, right? Good

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): Not Trixie's fault, but this kind of scuffy garage rock revival has been like 90% co-opted by ads. just let Apple and Old Navy have this music, it's theirs now

**seanderlust** (6): diversity win! gay people can also make department store back-to-school sale commercial music

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Get them Target bucks girl

**xophrys** (2): what is Trixie Mattel advertising to me next

THE SMASHA this song is actually phenomenal and Juriji deserves only the best things

---

### J U R I J I BIG FAT PUSSY JURIJI

**camerinian** (11): uhhhhhh what the fuck this actually slaps. This is just a straight up seriously well made techno track plonked in the middle of the rate, with a small but powerful flourish of drag serve. I'm just blindsided, I didn't expect anything in this rate to go this hard frankly. The club that this is playing in is the club I spend the rest of the night in, oh my god

**skylofte2** (11): por cerda y por falsa

**TheSheakDown** (11): When I was 13 I got cornered outside school by a boy. He called me slurs and then raised his fist. Then a woman appeared and grabbed the boys wrist. She twisted it and spat in his face, kicking him in the throat. “Leave this f\*ggot alone” she said. That woman was Juriji Der Klee.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): pussy

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Runway show music

**freav** (10): how is she so iconic

**jay** (10): half of these songs having the same exact beat but IDC! If the splice sound pack isnt broke dont fix it!

**MrSwearword** (10): it's Mugler but wackier and that helps it so much. The video is also a kii

**nt96** (10): she came, she saw, she cuntquered

**plastichaxan** (10): PURE CUNT SERVED IN A SONG

**Stryxen** (10): MOTHER

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): 11 11

**1998tweety** (9): the singing she did when she was eliminated would win the rate

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is better at making an eerie atmosphere than aiden zhane’s song

**sufjancaesar** (9): Hot

**akanewasright** (8.6): bruh why did this video open with opera HFHDHDH

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I’m sorry but the circle jerk around Juriji was the worst part about DRES2… this beat is great though

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.5): They play this as background music in tv shows when characters do molly at gay bars

**2RINITY** (8): Slow-burner justified by its payoff

**buddhacharm** (8): *Rachel Berry voice* KLEEK! KLEE! KLEE!

**elite4\_beyonce** (8): a bop Juriji is an icon

**thesmokeylife** (8): This is what Violet Chachki dreams of at night.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Was not expecting the jump into club banger but kudos for pulling off the landing

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): aint that the basket of fruit band

**BaconShoes** (7.5): a bit cunt if I do say so

**TiltControls** (7.5): VII

**xophrys** (7.5): it's good they're all starting to sound the same

### drag race espana.

**runaway3212** (7): the song is fine but the mv intro was much better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ive never seen climax before but id imagine it sounds and looks a lot like this

**vayyiqra** (7): thank god for this song being okay after the abominably boring one before it

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (6): this would probably go harder in a club

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): in the weird middle ground of not being campy enough or sexy enough

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): It just kind of exists on the playlist.

**frogaranaman** (5): why are there so many Italian songs in this rate

**apatel27** (4): Guess the ugly flow is a universal drag thing

**slimboyfriend** (4): she’s pretty but the beat is pretty unremarkable

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I really loved the classical interpretation at the beginning of the video but APPARENTLY that’s not part of the real song so… sorry Juriji

**impla77** (3.3): really one dimensional

One of the best cases of 'queen being eliminated and dropping track when her elimination episode airs'

---

### i am so glad i stalked people on lastfm and chuu gwk lists bc this is so true bestie

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (11): LISTEN i love this song i can't get enough of it and the fact she samples HER OWN SONG? IDK its just so iconic to me

### vgv alliance votes

**1998tweety** (10): devoured

**akanewasright** (10): Sending the very last ballot has benefits, because I can say “fuck you ricki”

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Maybe this doesn’t do as much with the video game aesthetic as it could but it doesn’t matter because the energy is THERE.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Aja is lucky that no one cares enough about this rate to google what she’s said because OH BOY

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): On-fucking-point, probably as good as a reality show themed diss track can possibly be.

**musical\_pyn** (10): a beat switch gets me everytime

**plastichaxan** (10): I AM so into voguing right now

**runaway3212** (10): yeah it's giving idc

**seanderlust** (10): this ep honestly slapped so hard

**thesmokeylife** (10): The video game music-inspired beat is inspired and original. Aja slays.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Flawless victory

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): sick beat

**BreeCherie** (9.4): when it slowed down I knew it was over

**2RINITY** (9): Incredible vocal versatility

**TiltControls** (9): VGV2?!?!?

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this is her sicko mode

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): love VGV

**MrSwearword** (8): the huntier sounding parts of the song are what make it

**TheSheakDown** (8): People make fun of her for calling herself a burlesque rapper but I mean look at the material

**vayyiqra** (8): kind of bangs and also cool beat switch

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8): this is self-actualization in action but then we hit the back half and we immediately go down a notch

**xophrys** (8): I missed when gamers gave cunt

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is camp

### would be quick to sacrifice the lamb :pussyeyeroll:

**DefaultPophead** (7): Will someone stop Lin Manuel Miranda?

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): “shitting on bitches, put that on reddit” - me after attempting to drag artists while doing rates

**Pinheadbutglittery** (7): inspiring, I really feel like leveling my pussy up now

**soupcereal** (7): This is kind of the most Aja song there is. It's an upgraded version of Level Ya Pussy Up with video game nods and whatnot. I think the slowdown bothers me too much. For whatever reason I've always felt Level Ya Pussy Up was superior

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The nerd in me wants to like this more but… um…

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): I’ve seen her twitter so I can’t take this seriously

**BaconShoes** (6): Her flow isn’t always my favorite here idk but it’s fun

**sufjancaesar** (6): Aja is a great lyricist but musically… her songs don’t hit for me. She could use more prominent choruses imo. Bob and Shea are better at this on their bitch tracks

**DirtyRat583** (5): never thought id say this in this rate but im bored

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): I wish I liked this more because she’s obviously insanely talented but I just... don’t (this goes for both of her songs tbh)

**impla77** (5): Think tempo changes are cute, but the flow is janky is some points, some bars are very much cliche

**uberpigeon** (5): great gowns...  beautiful gowns

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): ok if you insist

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): oops another reddit reference you’re getting tanked again

**fadedblue09** (3): nice slam poetry

**camerinian** (2): the drag equivalent of a cheap looking hip hop video on Facebook captioned "REAL RAPPER SPITS BARS 🔥🔥 RIP MUMBLE RAP 🪦"

**jay** (2): next level blueprint

**frogaranaman** (1): that was just horrible to listen through

**Stryxen** (1): I love aja but this is so bad lol but keep trying ! The switch up makes me lose it like what was she thinking

### aja in third person when she finds coal in her stocking:

**flava** (2.5): Aja just doesnt have any presence

Alaska's transition to a main pop girl with this music video single-handedly needs to be studied

---

### RATE??????????????????/???/??????

**ImADudeDuh** (10): “Britney, Mariah, Shania, Celine, Rihanna, Ariana, Gaga” how fucked is it that the 2 people mentioned here that will make the 2022 year end list is Britney Spears and Mariah Carey?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Good on Alaska for shouting out and elevating so many struggling artists!

**BreeCherie** (9): culturally competent queen

**camerinian** (9): you know what I'm just glad somebody is finally pandering to a demographic that has literally been screaming for it for years

**DirtyRat583** (9): omg she should have got pabllo vittar on this

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This track is the kind of song that could only be released by a drag queen in the best way possible- I think it’s really cute that she paid tribute to the meme and to the passionate fans of Brazil.

**shhhneak** (8.4): Naming my daughter Fortaleza.

**thesmokeylife** (8.4): This song is mindlessly fun, and it knows it.

**2RINITY** (8): BRASIL MENTIONED 🎉

**impla77** (7.4): Brazil should put this on the tourist advertisements

**BaconShoes** (7): Going to Brazil brb

**RandomHypnotica** (7): where's the "come to australia/new zealand" anthem

**seanderlust** (7): her saying she speaks Portugese and then just listing cities is camp

**xophrys** (7): stubborn bitches stay put don't listen to her

**TheSheakDown** (6): The line about getting called a cokehead always makes me smile

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Sis you’re not speaking Portuguese you’re just reading off 2014 World Cup venues

**WaterMagician** (6): I feel like Katya’s parody has absolutely overshadowed the original in my mind

**fadedblue09** (5): sounds like a FIFA song

**frogaranaman** (5): I can serve cunt to this on the subway maybe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): is there a word for someone who’s a weeaboo for brazil

**bigbigbee** (4): This feels like a joke that I simply don’t find very funny

### the body is HERE

**1998tweety** (10): ok bebe knows how to make good music

**amr** (10): really the most perfect song in this rate that doesn't try to be funny without losing its charm like

**CrimsonROSET** (10): and where is the body

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): desperate for a Tems collab

**nt96** (10): HOW BOUT WE LET THIS SONG BODY SLAM ME

**runaway3212** (10): wow this is genuinely so good

**TiltControls** (10): people talking up banjo as if this isn't winner material!!!

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): rock on

**BaconShoes** (9): loving the vibe tbh

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This is so cute! It’s nice to hear something that sounds this sweet when so many of these songs are trying (sometimes successfully, sometimes not) to be edgy or provocative.

**camerinian** (9): how is Bebe's music so much less stiff and more vibrant than basically every other queen here??? I never would have thought going into this rate that I'd come out with her as my fave, but she honestly ate on both of these

**freav** (9): another bop

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is good but kinda wish “Jungle Kitty” was here instead

**welcome2thejam** (9): Gets the positive vibes flowing, makes ya feel good

**impla77** (8.6): og queen killing it

**fadedblue09** (8.5): bop alert

**xophrys** (8.3): Context for this song, Bebe was actually watching television and binge-watched Tracy Beaker followed by Arthur in between recordings.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): daisy bop emoji

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is so sunny and fun, I’m a fan

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): this is the type of song you'd hear on the radio on a beach in greece while you sip on cocktails and don't at all remember actively listening to but then 5 years later you'll hear it and instantly get taken back

**2RINITY** (7.5): Pleasant, but doesn't quite hit another gear the way Banjo did

**TheSheakDown** (7.5): I just really love bebe but her music is so beautiful… it’s so afrocentric and her voice is just so sawft but flows so fabulously

**thesmokeylife** (7.5): I like it!

**frogaranaman** (7): she is the moment

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this sounds like a hit from 2015

**plastichaxan** (7): I’m sorry for all the Bebe songs that have to live in the shadow of Banjo

**vayyiqra** (7): I have a weird slight nostalgia for synthy "world music" kind of songs that were big in the 80s and 90s (often african-influenced) and this is like a throwback to that era

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): this is wii sports resort adjacent

### where is the body?

**bogo** (6): they can't all be banjo

**MrSwearword** (6): not my gig, but Bebe serves in the video

**jay** (5): hm

**Stryxen** (5): completely forgot I was listening to this

**flava** (3.5): i gotta be honest, the songs where the queens just make very standard pop music with the occasional zany lyric kinda suck

### ok tammie brown

**ricki** (6): me when a dead body falls on top of me:

Such a banger, this song deserved better tbh, her vocals are fucking luscious on here. I'm not sure if this is the first reggae song we've rated? Wait no that's literally a lie we had No, No, No by Eve and the Marley's in 00's MC's at least, but god this song is just so nice.

---

### this shouldve been on the fyc poster for drag rate

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is cute! I wish she could sing better!

### the greatest love of all

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): The joy in this song is infectious, when it comes on I smile and I dance. It’s also low-key such a bold statement because the Caribbean is not friendly to LGBT+ people so to see a drag queen make a song and video celebrating that culture feels powerful. ~~and the guy in the video is sooo hot~~

**2RINITY** (10): The TALENT, the RANGE, the PROGRESSION, gimme the album NOW

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): the opening sketch being a mean-spirited Jamaican restaurant lady is the attention to detail that makes me feel seen

**GlialUreterostenosis** (10): another unironically great track

**impla77** (10): this reggae is refreshing

**TiltControls** (10): playing this in the promo season convinced me drag rate was a good idea. and also playing drag money

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): huge proponent of reggae has logged on. drag + Jamaican soundsystem culture sounds like a fun time. there's some really fun youtube comments here.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.4): wow i love the vocals and beat and the combination works so well!!! i actually don't know what genre this is but it WORKS so well, so upbeat too

**celladonn** (9): very fun carribean bop

**plastichaxan** (9): A vibe!!

**soupcereal** (9): Top tier Monet

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Ok this is fun!

**welcome2thejam** (9): Sounds especially great at that little bit in the chorus that picks up

**1998tweety** (8.5): the video for this devoured

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): FUCK SIX60! I can’t listen to this song without thinking of ‘reggae’ songs by Maroon 5 knockoffs dominating the radio and every social occasion. I am at the END OF MY ROPE!!!

**akanewasright** (7.5): yeah this is cute

**BaconShoes** (7.5): ok this is a vibe, I can dig it

**thesmokeylife** (7.5): The thing about drag music is that there’s ‘Drag Music’ - music about drag, typically irreverent, etc. – and ‘Drag music’ – music written by drag artists, that doesn’t typically have the same signifiers as ‘Drag Music’. “Love Like This” falls into the latter category. I like it.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): gay

**ignitethephoenix** (7): decent but kind of boring

**ImADudeDuh** (7): sounds sweet as st lucia

**jay** (7): its cute

**MrSwearword** (7): the production is cute. At least the tropical realness doesn't feel Adam Levine level forced.

### last love/early spring

**xophrys** (7): who allowed stock instrumentals to be sampled and wasted on that voice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): its like a mid tier rihanna song

**amr** (6): using this comment as a reminder to ravedj this with wonder girl's why so lonely

**ricki** (6): feeling like shangela when she said she loves reggae

**runaway3212** (6): the chorus gives so much but the verses are like next level bad

**frogaranaman** (5): AI generated reggae music

**slimboyfriend** (5): sweet as st. lucia!

**fadedblue09** (4): Where is the Sean Paul feature

**camerinian** (3): nothing personal i love u dear Monet I'm just super allergic to this type of reggae

**vayyiqra** (3): Sorry not trying to be a hater but the vocals on this are really annoying me

### this was robbed idc i can recite this from heart and it was such an iconic moment 

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): I LOVE season 9 so much so many amazing moments <3

**MrSwearword** (10): ...some of them...YOU LOOK LINDA EVANGELISTA, YOU'RE A MODEL. Everything about you is perfect. Did you stone those tights? Oh, you're smiling. THEY EAT HER UP EVERY SINGLE TIME SHE'S ON THAT DAMN STAGE...she could walk out there in a fucking diaper, they'd be all "VALENTINA YOUR SMILE IS BEAUTIFUL!"

**plastichaxan** (10): Aja was right all along and we didn't listen

**runaway3212** (10): me reading myself in the mirror

**sufjancaesar** (10): Valentina’s response makes this a 10 lmaoo

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I saw the tights, and they were stoned

**TiltControls** (10): oh she's smiling

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): Aja kinda made points with that

**adeleade** (9): a complete takedown of valentinas entire schtik lol like i think the best fights are ones with buildup that truly strike at the esseence of the other person and hit pretty deep like i know what you are and i know that it isnt worth shit very that

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this literally introduced Linda Evangelista to a new generation

**nt96** (9): the sarcasm here is just resplendent ugh

**shhhneak** (9): As a fellow petty person, her intrusive thoughts won this round and I thank her for the representation.

**impla77** (8): great petty speech

**seanderlust** (8): makeup terrible like her name was Harlow

**BaconShoes** (7): I’d be a lil jealous of Valentina too tbh

**babadork** (6.5): It’s fun to quote, but the cringe I experience watching it is a little too much for me.

**buddhacharm** (6): overrated, people just gag because S9 was a vacuum of a season (courtesy of Sasha)

**buddhacharm** (10): this has infiltrated my daily lexicon so I unfortunately have to give Raven credit

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Incredible how Untucked peaked in its first season

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the editors were iconic for that one

**nt96** (10): try blaming THAT on the edit lol

**runaway3212** (10): the editing here is next level

**TiltControls** (10): i quote this all the time

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9): SHE IS ME I AM HER i think everyone can relate to this iconic moment tbh

**adeleade** (8): i think drag race is proof that bullying is funny actually

**BaconShoes** (8): lmaooo

It's just a banger I don't know what else to tell you. I think this is a pretty accessible and well made pop song, but I think that's also what sours a lot of people on it, it is kinda... basic sjkds.

---

### ppl surprised there are normal songs in this rate too

**seanderlust** (11): so true. stream XOXOY2K for well-fed tomagotchis

**1998tweety** (10): her campy stuff is fun but she pulls more "serious" music off well too

**akanewasright** (10): This is pastiche but it’s done pretty damn well! This album had quite a few hits (Red comes to mind), like Alaska can do just. Good, normal pop songs pretty well

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh this is very Popheads core and lucky for her I’m extremely basic.

**celladonn** (10): Hold on... this is a genuine bop

**CrimsonROSET** (10): relatable content

**DirtyRat583** (10): a good song???????????????? omg?????????????

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Alaska had her main pop girl moment with this album and it was incredible, there are major pop artists who want what she has.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the promo singles for Red 4 filth were legitimately so good and Red 4 filth as a whole is probably the closest a ru girl came to making a real album aside from Trixie

**impla77** (10): a great pop song

**MrSwearword** (10): first time consuming this and wow Alaska is a full blown pop gherl now

**plastichaxan** (10): The gays have to eat this up it’s litrally disco

**xophrys** (10): at least we can romanticise it now

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): she has a point, it IS a beautiful night for a breakdown

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/436/016/fe0.png

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8.6): i didn't like the drop initially, but it grew on me as the song went on!! her vocals sound so REFRESHING here too

**2RINITY** (7.5): Points for the ambition and instrumental, but the verses are Kiely Williams-level processed

**jay** (7.5): apink bside

**apatel27** (7): Swedish House Mafia producing Melanie Martinez

**BaconShoes** (7): Pretty good, but not super camp or super good

**dream\_fighter2018** (7): okay Alaska, maybe you’ve proven that you can actually make passable music. Congrats!

**Stryxen** (7): coco montrese Here's the key 🔑 since you can't find it. or whatever she said

**thesmokeylife** (7): Solid, not much more to say.

**welcome2thejam** (7): Why did the video have a sequel hook?

**TheSheakDown** (6.5): We love a self-aware drama queen

### beautiful night 4 a better song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): I’m not as interested as Alaska making real music idk

**vayyiqra** (6): What is this melody I swear it's from some song I know (not the "It's My Party" interpolation I know what that is lol)

**fkadizzy-1804** (5): Okay this actually has some really good composition and production. But it’s not mindblowingly good, i.e. not good enough to rise above her other songs just on the merits of being a “conventionally good pop song”, and her personality feels a bit neutered on it. All in all it’s kinda mid but I liked it because I have forgiving tastes.

**TiltControls** (5): was this written about the season 5 finale

**ricki** (4): what's after like

**uberpigeon** (4): ok like i get that this is like "oh this is a legitimate good song that normal people will enjoy".... however. the one fatal flaw in that theory is that its not good

**runaway3212** (3): Cray-ay-ay-ay

### yass and slay reject

**flava** (9.5): Ava could’ve made this an 11

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): this is literally an ava max song if she knew how to slay

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9.1): we're coming to a conclusion that this is in the Ava Max q-zone and she could pull it off; she should build a drag queen coalition that would be a huge vibe/help her break into the albanian american market better tbh

**bogo** (8): i love ava max

**frogaranaman** (5): this would have placed top three in Not So Main Pop Girls

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): omg whats happening

### pegged? reject?

**static\_int\_husp** (8): If you actually spent money on production and vocals this could be a Kylie Minogue song

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): this is just a conventionally good pop song, very Kylie-esque. not sure Alaska's the best vocalist for this though

### creme what was this mean i was too shy to ask

**cremeebrulee** (4): me when i read one of king’s writeups

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8.4): STRONG "im in a portlandia sketch" energy here; and fuck this isn't even Portland! like idk how im drawing that rn. also world star hip hop. anyways fun cut

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a bit too chaotic imo but it’s still a lot of fun!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): very cool sample, looked it up it’s https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y54tiSSA5I0 “San Lázaro” by Celina y Reutilio

**thesmokeylife** (8): Great.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I just wish this were a bit more spooky like [“Creature” by Nitty Scott](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xysA8jViT50) or [“Brujas” by Princess Nokia](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUcAPCxrSQs)

**runaway3212** (7.5): some lines here are so good but most are so bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): ok this is fun

**BaconShoes** (7): I appreciate the energy

**fkadizzy-1804** (7): This grew on me a ton, especially since the song gets better as it goes along (which is preferable to the alternative)

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): serves but in a non-specific sort of way

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Ok it’s a bit of a bop

### witch in the loris/dollya way

In retrospect it's so weird this song happened, the four of them never had a moment on the show about all being the New York queens in the same way Bob, Thorgy and Acid did or like Aquaria, Cracker, Monet, Yuhua and Dusty did, but this is possibly the best and most diverse representation NYC has had across all seasons so it's cool they made their song literally about that. Where were you when Aja spelt opulence wrong?

---

### pepp ate

**TiltControls** (8.5): if someone thought peppermint won her season after hearing this i would not blame them

**MrSwearword** (8): because of Peppermint and how they turned it here.

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (8): let it be known peppermint's verse is the best

**impla77** (7): Peppermint>>Aja>Alexis>Sasha

**TheSheakDown** (6.5): We have a ten out of ten verse, an eight out of ten verse, and two four out of ten verses which averages out to this

### sasha ate?

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): sasha velour main rap girl

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): if this song was just sasha’s verse itd be the easiest 11 of my time. unfortunately the rest of the song is awful so im giving it a pety 5

**jay** (1): kinda never liked this song omg but sasha sleighed

### alexis....... ate??????

**1998tweety** (10): all these verses ate, yes alexis too

**letsallpoo** (10): i live for alexis's part and im not ashamed of it

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Alexis Michelle’s verse is the worst, which means it’s the best, and that’s drag babeeeeeeeyyyyyyyyyy

### aja ATE

**WaterMagician** (9): Aja and Pep both are this up and the impact it had on drag race fans was phenomenal

**elite4\_beyonce** (7): thank god for Peppermint and Aja

### all the other comments

**Stryxen** (11): I just felt it mawma

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is one of the very few songs in this rate I was familiar with beforehand. I am biased to it because of that.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): what is the opposite of the burning of the library of Alexandria? this is the gay version of that

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking iconic. Someone I worked with once asked if I was gay and then after I said yes, I said “Also, the other day the song you were listening to, it was CLAT, right?” and it was.

**nt96** (10): Club Kids rock

**plastichaxan** (10): Most things about this shouldn’t work and they don’t really but like… It’s a 10

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Club. Legend. Art. Theater. Long ago, the four nations lived together in New York. Then, everything changed when the Art Nation attacked. Only the Drag Race Superstar, master of all four types of New York Queens, could stop them, but when the world needed her most, she vanished. A hundred years passed and my brother and I discovered the new Avatar, an Theater Queen named Jan. And although her theater skills are great, he has a lot to learn before she's ready to not be safe. But I believe Jan can save the world.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.5): I wanna rate it higher but alexis.... UGH. dont hate her verse like others do but shes definitely the weakest link

**2RINITY** (9): Always down for an homage to NYC's handbag house era

**BaconShoes** (9): kinda random af but it slaps idc

**kndight23** (9): An iconic moment in herstory

**runaway3212** (9): maybe new york made some points

**flava** (8.5): a drag posse cut, better than i could’ve ever expected, but these queens can’t harmonise

**freav** (8.5): this is such a mess bc some parts are so good and others are so bad, but its memorable enough to have a high rating

**thesmokeylife** (8.2): The subsequent memeification of this song has diminished its reputation, but it just wants you to FEEL, mama.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8.1): absolutely just vomiting everywhere all over the floor with no volition or control. i did laugh tho and i don't mind the beat. it made me think of the classic channel 101 show new york stories https://archive.org/details/channel101-new-york-stories/ep_1.m4v

**adeleade** (8): charisma luniqueness anerve and talent

**buddhacharm** (8): :sashit:

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is approximately the same # of times i say new york in a given day too

**vayyiqra** (8): bass goes hard on this

**welcome2thejam** (8): Crosby & Stills never fear, we got a new supergroup to handle the NY

**shhhneak** (7.9): C.A.M.P.

**bogo** (7): is this some term for pussy that i've never heard of cause it sounds like something people would call a pussy by

**fkadizzy-1804** (7): Definitely thought that Aja said “crap on my ass” at first, which probably counts as unintentional foreshadowing for the next song in the list

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sorry I’m a Californian

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): this just feels annoying, much like new york

**seanderlust** (6.3): this chorus is so bad jdslkjdsfblksd all of new york city and you all couldnt find one singer???

**frogaranaman** (6): THE FULBRIGHT LINE LMFAOOOOO

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): b c a, b a a a g, g# a #f, #g #f #f #f f

**Pinheadbutglittery** (6): I love it so much but it’s……. yeah

**ricki** (2): if this was aespa, alexis michelle would be giselle

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): felt like 15 minutes

**camerinian** (0): this is gonna look like a weird choice of zero amongst some of the other atrocious shit in this rate, but frankly after a string of boring, zero effort, lazy house pop tracks, this was my breaking point. This is everything I was worried this rate would sound like; the cheap-ass uninspired house beat, the lyrics made up of either lazy Drag Race girl band challenge cliches or vague liberal platitudes, the collection of queens who sound like they'd rather do anything other than sing and the production that doesn't even attempt to disguise that fact. This sounds like it was written by a New York tourism board who had to strip out all of the camp or edge that drag thrives on in order to get funding approved by whichever megacorp is sponsoring the pride parade this year. Even the most tasteless, unsavory, frankly dogshit music in this rate still feels more authentic to the culture and the queens performing them than this does. I'm glad there's more variety and twists in this rate than what might seem on the surface, because frankly if it was all like this, I would have skipped the rate.

### i think she means like popping her head out from the curtains like when its showtime and the curtains go and the actors start acting???? /u/uberpigeon 

**uberpigeon** (10): what is popping the head and other questions science has yet to answer

Why did you all let this make it so far this is a SILLY DRAG RATE why is the OPERA SONG top 10 ??????????????????????????????????????????????????!!!!!!!!!!!!?!?!?!??!?!?!?!?!!!!!?!?!?!??!?!

---

### this is genuinely in contention for my favourite rate comment ive ever seen

**camerinian** (9.5): hearing this in the playlist next to all of the filthy club jams is the audio equivalent of being handed a pure silk cloth and using it as a cum rag

### the general consensus

**cremeebrulee** (10): this was so fucking random but it slayed

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): What the actual fuck I was not prepared for this. Drop the opera album pls

**seanderlust** (10): the number of raters that just checked to make sure they didn't accidentally skip to a different playlist

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): what the fuck AJSKFHKSHAKSJG

### operoh yes she better do i dont know guys im tired send tweet

**apatel27** (11): 👌

**bigbigbee** (11): I actively listen to opera in my free time so I obviously love this. And honestly, opera had some early examples of “drag” - or at least playing around with gender presentation (look up travesti roles in ballet and opera, and “breeches roles” in opera). One of my favorite opera songs, Voi Che Sapete from The Marriage of Figaro, is traditionally sung by a woman who is playing the role of a young boy! I’m not saying that this practice was inherently queer, or that the people engaging in it were queer – that would be trying to fit a modern mindset on a historical construct. But I DO think that even without the intention to “represent queerness” per se, these practices were inherently playing with gender, and I think that’s cool!

**impla77** (11): giving us reggae and opera.. your fave could never

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**akanewasright** (10): when I heard there was an opera song in the rate, I didn’t expect a full baritone, I was fearing for some ghastly soprano aria sung in a shallow falsetto. So honestly I’m just relieved that this is normal and well sung

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): my dad is an opera stan which endears me to this slay. This is so impressive i had to lower my Soak It Up score like what the fuck was that

**flava** (10): A+ for effort

**freav** (10): this is impressive so there you go

**kndight23** (10): The vocals are absolutely MAGICAL, without a doubt the best display of talent in herstory

**nbapip** (10): okurrrr (w/ vibrato)

**shhhneak** (10): Bitch you better weaponize that arts degree!!

**sufjancaesar** (10): Probably the most iconic part of All Stars 7… and Monét’s climax on drag race

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): a slay, a serve, a feast

**TheSheakDown** (10): give it up for the second best opera singer in Drag Race herstory

**thesmokeylife** (9.8): High Drag. It depends a bit on the visual aspect for its full impact.

**nt96** (9.5): Pavarotti dead in a ditch

**xophrys** (9.5): eccitato

**2RINITY** (9): It's official, I stan

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the best talent show act on rdpr… she destroyed everyone with her talent!!!

**jay** (9): idk what the hell shes saying but girl i am living

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9): that's right Monét X Change

**WaterMagician** (9): extra points because this is such an amazing display of Monét’s talent and also completely unexpected from a Ru Girl

**BaconShoes** (8): I mean this isn’t my style, but she ate this up

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (8): don't listen to opera but this is IMPRESSIVE she should be on funny girl instead of lea michelle tbh

**bogo** (8): sorry king this is great

**DefaultPophead** (8): I've heard much better opera, but this is still good.

**DirtyRat583** (8): the range that this queen possesses... and yet none of it stands out. jack of all trades, master of none

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): I’m not huge on opera, but I do have to appreciate the guts behind releasing this. I don’t even know if she’s doing it right or not but I support it

**GlialUreterostenosis** (8): I have no idea how to evaulate this as anything other than a showcase of vocal talent

**MrSwearword** (8): I wish this was "There For You" instead but Monet's opera voice is cute.

**plastichaxan** (8): When Latine fans of drag race shared a pic of her performance of this calling her Montserrat del Cambio and posting her on christian religious groups making up stories ldkfsjkdfs a moment in herstory I think

**ricki** (8): slaaaaaayyyyyy

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Her range

**ImADudeDuh** (7): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E56z6d-VIAQZC9K.jpg

**slimboyfriend** (7): I’m sure if I knew anything about opera this wouldn’t be half as impressive as I think it is.

**TiltControls** (7): yes this is still the same rate as oops i think i pooped and drag money

**vayyiqra** (7): Well this was unexpected but I'm into it !

**welcome2thejam** (6): Bringing out the opera skills is a power move, respect

**amr** (5): a song I did not expect to hear in this rate but unfortunately nothing actually grabbed me here it's just like ok slay U can do that? work

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I have no idea at all how to rate this so a 5 it is.

**celladonn** (5): I won't drag this because I do admire the talent and versatility. But I can't pop my pussy to this

**musical\_pyn** (5): its fine technically but as a piece of opera it's just,,, meh

### thank you all so much

**CrimsonROSET** (1): your honor it’s camp

**frogaranaman** (1): king how the fuck do I even rate this

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): Let it be known that this is just as gimmicky as the rest of the songs in the rate! It does not have more artistic merit just because she’s singing opera, it’s just a different style of music! Also just sing “Vecchia zimarra senti” or "Scintille, diamant" like the rest of the basses bitch.

**RandomHypnotica** (1): this isn't the opera rate get back in your box and hide these talents

**runaway3212** (1): king forcing us to listen to this just so we tank it like...

**Stryxen** (1): the Blair St clair of the rate (in a rate with a Blair st clair song)

**uberpigeon** (0): you know those pop stan twitter users that think anyone who actually likes bjork or fiona apple is just pretending to like it to look intelligent. well thats what i think about opera songs. u dont really like it know ur lying

### havent started it yet! im waiting for it all to be out so i can find it online somewhere dodgy and binge it but i keep seeing the naked men on my timeline and its making me impatient

I think when I think of a DRAG song I think of this, which both explains how it did so well and explains why it didn't do better. This song is still iconic to this day and it's funny to think that it was just born from an offhand joke in a challenge from the show. Alaska really is the queen of branding. I'm sad Alaska's top song in the rate didn't make it even higher but this is a good result still.

---

### i knew what i was doing

**nbapip** (10): don't know if this is incredible or the first drag song i heard

**welcome2thejam** (10): Good move to place this song first on the playlist, any prospective rater will know if this rate is for them within the first minute

**cremeebrulee** (8): love that the opener of this playlist has 800 “are you ready?s” like that’s already better tracklisting than most pop albums

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Having the most abrasive track in the rate be the first song on the playlist is so funny, like I’ve had years to get used to this so I’m immune but I cannot imagine clicking on this rate with no context and getting blasted in the face by this. Can completely understand why people wouldn’t like this because it’s kinda bad but that’s also kind of the *point*, it’s more of an experience than a song.

### your makeup is brilliant

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): The way I would play this constantly 2015-2017 as just any old song! Like it’s really the pinnacle of bitchy iconic drag race music! And it makes me think of my peak drag race fandom days with my friends who have since moved from the city aweeeee

**vayyiqra** (11): Worrying I might have made a mistake by committing to doing this rate but those fears were put aside by this song, funniest shit I've ever heard, I love EDM, I laughed, I cried

**akanewasright** (10): “my makeup is terrible, your makeup is terrible, our makeup is terrible, but I love you anyway” is the love story of the ages

**amr** (10): yeah I gave this a 10 seconds in cos she said hieeeeeeeee the way I do

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The Chainsmokers - #SELFIE, you will always be influential

**jay** (10): this bridge is stronger than the golden gate

**MrSwearword** (10): the quintessential bitchtrack made by any RuGirl

**plastichaxan** (10): This song is such a journey to start the rate, it greets you, it gives you the anticipation to tell you your makeup is terrible (affectionate) and then the song gets so serious with Alaska’s realization and it’s so moving like what a powerful start

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the kinda camp harsh EDM beat that I hoped this rate would sound like

**Stryxen** (10): The plot twist oh my GOD i literally fainted on first listen bendelacreme could never

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): This song is funny every time, I don't know why

**thesmokeylife** (10): This is perfect Drag Music - irreverent, endlessly quotable, fun – but excellent pop music at the same time. It sounds surprisingly fresh for an EDM comedy song. Alaska has legit songwriting chops.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): debunked the myth of good looking makeup

**BaconShoes** (9.5): I like to think she wrote this song about me because she saw me in a drag show and she came up to me after to say how much fun I was to watch, but I KNOW my makeup looked horrendous

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Lyrically this is not the most creative execution of “turn this famous RPDR line into a whole song” in this rate but it slays so I don’t care.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this has the same energy of those music video parodies videos from 2010 and I love that for her

**slimboyfriend** (9): she kind of set the bar with rugurl music with this one

**soupcereal** (9): Definitive of a era. Everything a drag song SHOULD be.

**BreeCherie** (8.8): she did what had to be done

**2RINITY** (8.5): The joke was getting stale by the bridge, but the last chorus brought me back

**camerinian** (8.5): iconic, I think? I'm only tangential to this culture, but like, I think it's iconic?

**xophrys** (8.5): this song turned me gay, I am now domesticated with my mono-infected boyfriend

**1998tweety** (8): she spilled

**CrimsonROSET** (8): alaska makes drag music in the way where it’s there to parody things and I think that’s beautiful

**DefaultPophead** (8): Thanks, I needed to hear the truth.

**Pinheadbutglittery** (8): early Alaska really kept Myspace alt pop alive

**runaway3212** (8): she spilled her makeup is literally bottom 3

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Beautifully written, iconic, she went through a whole character development arc in 4 minutes

**impla77** (7.8): I can see this would pop off in a club

**TiltControls** (7.5): michelle to queens with a signature makeup style after week 1

**shhhneak** (7): One of the very rare instances where somebody is better at talk-singing than singing.

**seanderlust** (6.5): i feel like i'm gonna say this a lot but camp. alaska's commercial that this is based on (which is based on an old school drag reference) was my favorite by a mile and honestly made me really appreciate alaska's brand of humor. this is also such alaska's brand - fun, deeply referential, tongue-in-cheek

### headcanon that this song was written about jinkx

**fkadizzy-1804** (8.5): The pre-chorus and chorus were kind of a letdown for me, given the potential of the verses. I get that the obnoxious repetitiveness is the point but for whatever reason I just couldn’t get into it as much as I needed to for this song to be a 10/10. But I do appreciate the verses and the subtle nod at a deeper message.

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (7.9): love the vocals and vibe but the drop is not my cup of tea!

**WaterMagician** (7): the epitome of a drag queen rapping her catchphrases over a dance beat

**DirtyRat583** (6.5): drag queen music is not an excuse to make bad music!!!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the verses are this are so campy and fun and then that chorus comes in and sucks out all the enjoyment i was having with this out

**freav** (5): not very notable or even all that funny but alaska's delivery and personality does helps elevate these kind of songs

**sufjancaesar** (5): Ngl this is quite grating and repetitive but I’d probably bop to it in 2014

**TheSheakDown** (4.3): Very nice of her to dedicate a song to the winner of her original season, we love a graceful loser

**diamondsandglass** (4): your song is... fine

**frogaranaman** (4): Jeffrey Star could have written this and I wouldn't have blinked twice (edit: this originally said Dahmer before I proofread)

**fadedblue09** (2): points for that bridge

**bogo** (1): so is your song bitch

**dream\_fighter2018** (1): your song is terrible, and I don’t love you for this

### new always be my baby/how many licks just dropped

**buddhacharm** (10): This song was playing the first time I ever got into a car accident as a passenger lmfao. My friend like fully reversed into a car behind us and I had to sit in the car for like 30 minutes as she was shaking and sobbing exchanging insurance while this song was still blasting on her car speaker. We got into like 3 other car accidents after that but none of them topped the camp value of this one (her rear-ending an ambulance came close)

Had the rate happened a month later I'd definitely have included Black instead, but this is definitely cute! I love the inclusion of her Pit Stop verse and Bob is a great rapper. Do I think she deserved to be the highest perfoming queen in the rate I'm not sure but still, slay!

---

### \*jaida in pitstop voice* period.

**1998tweety** (10): ate

**bigbigbee** (10): (game reviewer voice) it really makes you FEEL like you’re a k mart dress bitch

**CrimsonROSET** (10): she used the Twitter line I knew she saw potential

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): still so thankful Bob the Drag Queen saved my ears from Adore making the worst music I’ve ever heard

**frogaranaman** (10): this song actually sounds like some effort was put into the making of it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): “Don’t watch football, but this a home run” is the best lyric in the rate

**jay** (10): literally 30 secs of her just repeating "you aint never met a bitch like me" and that level of lyricism has still yet to be matched or beat... music peaked

**MrSwearword** (10): even fucking around and reusing part of the "Clapback" rap they made, Bob is the rap supreme

**plastichaxan** (10): ATE MOTHER CUNT ETC

**shhhneak** (10): Bob’s the best verse writer in the franchise. And co-written by Ocean Kelly? Oh it clears!!

**Stryxen** (10): slayed as always

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ok maybe shes kinda a main rap girl

**babadork** (9.4): This song is good, but I think all the other queens should be thanking her for coming out with this before “Black.”

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.2): ngl it sounds like it could be a nicki song

**camerinian** (9): Kmart dress bitch is honestly a perfect diss to base the track around

**2RINITY** (8.5): It's tight, it's focused, it's got a Boondocks line. This is how you make a sub-2 minute track without wasting any precious seconds

**TiltControls** (8.5): bob killing this rate

**freav** (8.3): my favorite of the bob songs

**BaconShoes** (8): ok this is cunty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The chorus and outro leave a little to be desired but the slay and energy especially in the verses is undeniable.

**nt96** (8): She ended K-Mart and she's dancing on their grave.

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): The switch up on Kmart

**WaterMagician** (8): queen of the bitch track

**welcome2thejam** (8): Big ups for making a song good enough to ignore having a vertical music video

**impla77** (7.7): I think I like Bob calling me a bitch

### k mart stans

**TheSheakDown** (7): Omg so my first time hearing this was a video she posted where she had an intro that used a clip of a pastor advocating for killing gay people and then transitioned into the song while she did a tiktok transition so she was in full drag and I had full-on chills

**DefaultPophead** (7): Would score higher, but I love K-Mart and I feel like I'm being bullied. I'm wearing Kmart pants atm.

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7): Another "god, imagine if this had a budget" track

**vayyiqra** (7): weird banger

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): where’s the H&M version for Joe Black

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): now . kmart has some cute stuff sometimes

**runaway3212** (5): this kinda basic

**soupcereal** (5): Bob's big comeback unfortunately didn't land for me. Bob rhyming with the same end word gets repetitive. And this instrumental isn't as strong as I wish it could be. I do like how she incorporated Voguing music -isms. Just didn't all come together

**thesmokeylife** (5): This feels like the least distinctive song in the tracks from Bob here. It could’ve come from nearly any artist, drag or otherwise.

**Ghost-Quartet** (0): People often joke about how many of these drag race girls release songs despite not being able to sing but if we’re being real a lot of their attempts at “rap” are FAR more painful.

### tiktok ruined the drag rate industry

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): again, its fascinating to see a realm of internet trends, sounds, and aesthetics get covered by various drag queens. this video is only about 2 months old at the moment--its a tiktok quickie filmed for the iPhone and made for fun edits; a slab full of hype. i think BTDQ really let it rip here.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): why is the MV so short

**chihkeyNOPE** (9): (it’s too short)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A pretty good track that commits the cardinal sin of being a tiktok song

The blueprint for a queen who had a forced catchphrase on the show and made a poorly produced song about it

---

### gone with the window was one of the best puns drag race ever made they peaked so early

**1998tweety** (10): ate

**babadork** (10): I was a very loyal member of Team Maraqua on Neopets for years, so I live in an alternate universe in which this is a jock jam.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): finally some real music

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): the production makes this PC music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the culture shifted when this happened

**jay** (10): YAS CLASSIC CLASSIC god that beat just gives me that RUSH. Need itzy to steal it im literally begging

**MrSwearword** (10): Bob came correct with this song and established themselves as the rap bitch supreme

**nbapip** (10): fuck. yo. purse.

**plastichaxan** (10): I get this stuck in my head like at least once every week ugh

**RandomHypnotica** (10): purse furse purse furse

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): that's right

**BaconShoes** (9.5): a smash

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.5): ballroom excellence i feel like if my homophobic grandma listened to this she'd get a heart attack

**soupcereal** (9): Goes hard, some of Mitch Ferrino's best work, Bob's verses are strong.

**TiltControls** (9): walk into the rate purse first

**welcome2thejam** (9): "Second verse is only gonna get worse" is such a risky line, happy that she dodged a self-inflicted wound

**thesmokeylife** (8.5): What’s not to love?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): it IS a well known fact

**runaway3212** (8): slay killed queup

**sufjancaesar** (8): (Unfortunately) set the trend where queens commit to a forced meme from their season… and Bob did it best

**uberpigeon** (8): it is a known fact that a woman DO carry an evening bag

**vayyiqra** (8): banger

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): She made some points

**2RINITY** (7.5): Solid piece of hip-house

**akanewasright** (7.5): there have been worse songs written around catchphrases

**celladonn** (7.5): if bob wasn't so charismatic i would probably find this a bit annoying

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): i like the part where she makes noises

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Fun energy and lyrics but a bit bland musically.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I love sentimental music

**ricki** (7): the most "catchphrase: the single" single of them all

**shhhneak** (7): Bob’s the Blackpink of Drag Race. Production always lets them down.

**fkadizzy-1804** (6.8): Is it weird that I almost think I’d like this song better with lower production values?

**seanderlust** (6.5): bob namedropping Groupon in a bitch track...she is that bitch

### purse eighth purse eighth

**frogaranaman** (6): "second verse is only gonna get worse" I like how self aware she is

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): i'd like this more if i didn't have the sneaking suspicion that this was his catchphrase on the show

**TheSheakDown** (5.5): This is a fine song but i could never imagine myself listening to this song, not because it’s bad but I don’t like it enough to add it to my liked songs so it could come up on shuffle and I can’t think of a single scenario where I’d be like “you know what music would really set the scene for this event? Purse First.”

**impla77** (5): kack kack

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Bob may not be a singer, but a good vocalist can overcome that. Bob isn’t that either.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): purses were a capitalist invention to stop women from asking for bigger pockets in their jeans

You wanna talk about a song that caused a world stop moment, it was this. The collaboration between two of the most renowned winners of the show, a catchy bitch-track, timely references to the show and gaggy moments, it's such a perfect track for what it does god. Alaska's verse is fire front to back it's phenomenal.

---

### im sorry this is gay history

**BreeCherie** (11): the layers, the lore…she has it all

**CrimsonROSET** (11): Bob is the best lyricist to come from Drag Race, and one of the most charismatic queens as well. Funny, quick and dry is exactly my type of humor, and it’s showcased insanely well in this

**1998tweety** (10): yet another 10

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I hated this chorus so much upon first listen but then it almost immediately became slay?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): need the Sleigh Bells remix of this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): popheads chart smash hit

**jay** (10): YASSSSSSS CLASSIC bob makes HITS!

**MrSwearword** (10): a collaboration that's honestly up there with "Promiscuous" as one of the best

**plastichaxan** (10): Two queens maximizing their joint slay

**RandomHypnotica** (10): evil song

**runaway3212** (10): yeah she's great

**seanderlust** (10): that lip gloss sample >>>

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Delta is an icon for everything, but also for inspiring this song. All the verses are so good, but who's after Peppermint...

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.8): children were singing this song at graduations weddings funerals

**thesmokeylife** (9.8): Eternal classic. Alaska’s verse is perfect.

**Stryxen** (9.5): this is like f wordery sensory stimulation for me

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (9.1): now its not as good as "dig" by mudvayne, but it accompishes the same raw "i fuck with the vision and wanna sit down and drink alcoholic kombucha with the gang" energy.

**diamondsandglass** (9): deserves a 10 for the AS2 line

**impla77** (9): all these references are such a time capsule in RPDR history

**TheSheakDown** (9): I think there’s a difference between music by drag queens and Drag Queen music™ and out of all the songs here from the latter category this is the strongest for me. It’s just a serve between all the references, Alaska vocal fry-ing it up, the chorus, the iconique music video…

**WaterMagician** (8.5): I know this is probably incomprehensible to non drag race fans but I genuinely do not care Alaska snapped

**TiltControls** (8): this is just a bunch of drag references strung together but its also fun so thats okay

### who's after peppermint bitch not yet another dig

**adeleade** (6): alaska kind of ate bob up

**shhhneak** (6): Not the Sasha Velour stray… I need to know if her and Alaska have ever been in the same room before.

**vayyiqra** (6): lol

**frogaranaman** (5): me giving another song in this rate a low score and bitchy comment

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I’ve disliked this since it came out, I just do NOT get the hype around it! Bob’s vocals on this track are atrocious, the self-references come off as masturbatory, and the video just reminds me of that weird era where Bob was trying to “brand” his assistant (as if we cared).

### the fandom during as2:

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): unfortunately has what is probably the worst feature in the rate

**2RINITY** (6.5): My lipgloss is cool, my lipgloss is poppin' / Drag rap songs need a new rule: don't let Alaska hop in

**apatel27** (5): Dont even know her but this is turning me into an Alaska anti

**dream\_fighter2018** (4): this rate is determined to make me an Alaska anti

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): alaska radiates negative charisma

### obsessed with how this section is entirely ppl who did this rate without context of the show and heard a sample they knew and commented it

**akanewasright** (9.5): I Can’t Believe It’s Not Lil Mama

**cremeebrulee** (8): what you know bout me what you what you know bout me what you know bout me what you what you know bout me

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): what you know bout me what you what you know bout me

**BaconShoes** (4): Does this sample Lip Gloss??? Not my fave tbh

### ok so basically rugirls and reddit have always had a weird dynamic bc its kind of a punching bag as it is the only platform (or at least was for a while) for fans to not only share their distaste for a queen, but also say *why* in detail and not just in 180 characters or a 15 second instagram story. but also fans have always taken the "its a discussion board its not like im commenting it on their page" to be VILE to the queens, so its complex.

**DefaultPophead** (9): Damn what's with Alaska and Reddit spill the tea girls!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Why do all these queens talk about reddit am I missing something

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): “fuck your Reddit?” Is this a ~~SheDevilByNight~~ Trinity dig?

**WaterMagician** (8): Lala and Ocean Kelly both really embodied that bad bitch energy on this one

**thesmokeylife** (7.8): Great!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This is fun and has lots of energy but I just don’t think the production is quite matching it.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): she was in her (paper) bag(s) here

**frogaranaman** (2): this is a bbno$ song

### LIL' BOY

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): SO DONT CALL SOMEONE A PLACE JDSAIDASHDSA

**ImADudeDuh** (10): camp

**jay** (10): MAY I?... may i?.... 😭

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (10): chacharinas it's a struggle out here

**plastichaxan** (10): Hello this is peak television there have been few moments so chaotically edited and referenced this is probably only topped by Everyone vs Mimi so I guess the secret is in all the girls ganging up on one of them

**RandomHypnotica** (10): THIS ANIMATION IS A MASTERPIECE

**runaway3212** (10): this is literally so funny idk what’s going on here idk what season this is but sometimes bullying makes points

**shhhneak** (10): Alyssa is a quote machine here. "Don't call someone a place." "Uneducated." "SIT YO ASS DOWN AND SHUT THE HELL UP BITCH!"

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): The Assassination of Serena Cha Cha, I need my asthma pump

**BaconShoes** (9.5): this was so funny lmao she deserved for calling them ghetto

**adeleade** (9): jackfed pointing out that this is edited was a life ruining moment for me this is just so iconic the way no one is taking her seriously lmao and like the hatred of serenas like sort of classist undertones idk i live for it seeing the privileged girl put in her place and cocos final line is also just the best lmao

**impla77** (9): V iconic but l defo would've cried if I was Serena

**MrSwearword** (9): everything about this is great. Except for Serena

**nt96** (9): this is like when that scene in Kill Bill when The Bride takes on a whole group of Yakuza except here she gets mauled.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): If I were Serena I would have left society after this and after listening to "Drag Money" I think she should have too

**TiltControls** (8): they may be hating on her but could any of them do drag money?!?

**babadork** (7.8): I know Coco and Alyssa were one of the show’s great rivalries, but I spent the whole season wanting the story to become about how they became best friends and moved into a house in Miami together.

**Pinheadbutglittery** (7): but the animated version is a twenty out of ten

**seanderlust** (7): the editing in this scene is so rough djemwlndjd

### she may not have won s2 or s3 or as3 or dancing with the stars or the main rate, but shangie won this

**BaconShoes** (10): ICONIQUE

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): when she stood up u knew it was personal!!

**buddhacharm** (10): I miss the true absurdity of Drag Race like DR will never be this earnestly camp ever again

**elite4\_beyonce** (10): so iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): honestly, this is winning, nice try other moments

**nbapip** (10): drag race parodied other shows, other shows parody this

**plastichaxan** (10): All the discourse and theories around this need to be studied fr

**RandomHypnotica** (10): any sugar daddys out there hmu

**runaway3212** (10): iconic

**shhhneak** (10): Shakespeare couldn't have written monologues like this. I think this single-handedly renewed Untucked for life.

**sufjancaesar** (10): Every single word of this is iconic

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Iconic even before Shangela's speech. Leigh Bowery, The Fishnets, Judy Jetson Hooker, Camp vs Glamour. Everything you could want

**TiltControls** (10): a versitile speech for any occasion

**ImADudeDuh** (9): and now Shangela is still in Dancing With the Stars!

**nt96** (9): a scene so fierce even Mimi's eyes were aghast 👄 👃🏻 👄

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (9): it's a classic

**babadork** (8): Iconic moment and I love her, but Shangela was being a jerk up until the sugar daddy bit.

**seanderlust** (8): I get it, if you're going to pick a S3 untucked moment this is the one, but I do want to give a shout-out to what would be [the 11 of the bonus rate](https://youtu.be/5ORJ01nBWEw)

**adeleade** (7): idk i feel very little about this for some reason

**impla77** (6.7): but was it camp?

**jay** (6): aged sadly but still iconic

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Can something be so iconic that it circles around to being lame? This reference has been ground to dust, any time I hear someone bring it up I just roll my eyes.

Shea is just incredible I really don't know what else to stay, probably one of the only humans in the world I like *stan* in the obsessive way a little bit but she really deserves it (shoutout to #shea-therapee). She can do everything, and she looks incredible. This song is such a good bitchtrack, only reason it's not a 10 is because I wish Shea had a proper verse in the way Vixen and Lila do.

---

### I KNOW THATS RIGHT

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): "Fix your face boo" "cocky" lyric of the decade?

### and she had every right to be!

**plastichaxan** (11): I’d never heard 3 people go this hard on a single song before this wow

**slimboyfriend** (11): “showed my boobs on jerry springer” is all she had to say

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**BaconShoes** (10): They ate this up

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (10): THE VIXENNNNNNNNNN

**buddhacharm** (10): Show us. That cock. NOW. That hard fucking c- HARD. IT BETTER BE FUCKING HARD. Now! NOW.

**freav** (10): the beats after each "cocky" are so good

**ImADudeDuh** (10): THIS IS THE MOTHERFUCKING TRACK

**impla77** (10): and then she lost :(

**jay** (10): yeah yeah sorry its giving day 3 top 10

**soupcereal** (10): God tier. One of the best, catchiest there's ever been.

**sufjancaesar** (10): Mother.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): all dogs go to heaven. classic "escape room" beat here

**thesmokeylife** (9.5): Excellent work overall.

**Stryxen** (9.4): this is anxiety inducing but in a cunty yass way

**2RINITY** (9): Trio mixtape when

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This could be a real song

**musical\_pyn** (9): if any rugirl deserves this beat it's shea

**TiltControls** (9): with a song like this she can be

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I think… this is a slay

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): so car key

**ricki** (8.5): back when plug.dj was still a thing and i would only listen to the most mainstream of pop, i would play this song to impress people and make them think i knew other artists outside of ariana and taylor

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): the production on this is fab

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I’ll score it higher in all stars

**TheSheakDown** (8): This song is so good and all three verses are on the same level which is rare in collabs with more than two people… Lila Star u will always be famous

**vayyiqra** (8): kinda bangs

**GlialUreterostenosis** (7.5): Not the most technical rapper, but they ooze confidence and charisma, and wisely filmed their music video entirely in a semi truck to save money for the production.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): come through like a WHAT??? ඞ

**uberpigeon** (7): khaki

**welcome2thejam** (6): There's a fun first chorus drop

### nina bonina brown:

**runaway3212** (7): honestly she feels unfinished

**MrSwearword** (5): The Vixen has bars on this

**camerinian** (5.5): this was really lame until the little vintage house keys appeared, and then it got upgraded to mid

**fkadizzy-1804** (5.5): I do love that synth riff and the beat is catchy but other than that for me it’s just kinda there

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This did not live up to the discord hype much at all I’m afraid.

**xophrys** (3): I like the bells it makes me feel Christmassy

**flava** (2): if the song asks for a 10, there is a very high chance it will not be getting a 10

**frogaranaman** (1): little too cocky for the quality of this song

### :'( i had to make cuts..

**diamondsandglass** (8): it's a travesty that Feeling So isn't on this list

### /u/darjeelingdarkroast what

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Shea Coulee’s face is now seared into my brain cuz of that one afternoon I was in Adobe Premier and had a meeting on mute, putting Marvin Gaye’s face over Shea’s frame by frame for 4 hours

The way history has been rewritten, people HATED Priyanka's music when it first came out but ever since Lemon's verse went viral everyone switched up. Can Pri sing? No. Can Pri make good music? YES. This was top three pretty much the whole rate I think it would've been a slay winner but like Lemon it will remain robbed.

---

### dont even have to ask for it for me to get it

**1998tweety** (11): As a Canadian I'm legally obligated to give this my 11, they both ate too.

**akanewasright** (11): idc they hit the slay button

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): This and Cocky were the two songs I kept seeing referred to as frontrunners is the Discord. I know what team I’m on.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): gosh this is so fun

**RandomHypnotica** (11): cunt

**TiltControls** (11): i love canada vs the world

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i wish i had a less basic 11 considering i went into this rate blind but this is just the best written and produced song in the rate by a mile

### justin trudeau being a guest on canvtw actually makes me ctfu

**amr** (10): toronto!

**BaconShoes** (10): an iconic canadian classic tbh

**chihkeyNOPE** (10): Yes Lemon is great but Priyanka’s parts are good too!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the insane thing about this is that neither of them can sing

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m not even required to inquire after what I desire in order to attain it, for when people lay eyes upon my posterior in these garments it costs a premium. Your father (in particular) deposits exorbitant amounts of currency on it as well, something you would do well to remember- he attempts to find pornographic images of my privates on online message boards. Lip makeup stains the marijuana, but I will not apologize as it is Rihanna’s brand. I’m not attempting to peacock– and yet we do so in spades. By the time the evening reaches its conclusion, your reserve of funds will be depleted. Indeed, Primon are the proprietors of the year two decades past the second millennium. Similar to neck ornamentation declaring eternal companionship, a roster of only the most exclusive attendees, causing men to cease breathing due to our cavalier behaviors, a grin that begets similar emotion, arrive in a luxury automobile– my female friend and I traverse the premises, allow us to achieve our goals.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song made me rethink what I considered TikTok hits cause like there's always a 60% chance it's only a hit for a gay TikTok niche and nothing else

**skylofte2** (10): baga chipz you call yourself the people's princess and i agree because this is a car crash

**vayyiqra** (10): TORONTO ?! hey thats me and also this goes extremely hard and it's fun

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): intro is an 11; like this legit has insane 30 rock energy oozing out. i was dyin

**welcome2thejam** (10): Everyone doing this rate on streaming and not through the music videos are missing out

**elite4\_beyonce** (9.5): That Lemon verse is so fucking fierce we tend to forget the rest of the song is also good

**2RINITY** (9): This instrumental is HOT

**adeleade** (9): tbh i do feel that priyanka's music is underrated esp when people hyped lemon's verse so much that they did not realise that priyankas music is generally p good at least by drag queen standards lol

**runaway3212** (9): okay come through

**shhhneak** (9): Another Toronto name-dropping rapper SHOULD be nervous.

**DefaultPophead** (8): damn these queens and their reddit

**TheSheakDown** (7.2): Okay Lemon’s verse was good but it wasn’t THAT good

**camerinian** (7): all these queens name dropping Reddit, how many of them are gonna be quietly sitting in the reveal thread

**uberpigeon** (7): DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK FOR IT FOR ME TO GET IT WHEN YOU SEE MY ASS IN THIS, I CHARGE CREDIT YOUR DAD DROPS STACKS ON THIS AND DON'T FORGET IT HE'S TRYNA FIND MY PUSSY PICS UP ON REDDIT GLOSS ON THE BLUNT, AIN'T SORRY IT'S FENTY DON'T MEAN TO STUNT BUT WE STUNTIN', PLENTY END OF THE NIGHT AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNT EMPTY YEAH, LEMYANKA OWN 2020 IT'S LIKE BFF NECKLACE, VIP GUEST LIST LEAVIN' BOYS BREATHLESS WHEN WE GET RECKLESS SMILE IS INFECTIOUS, ROLL UP IN A LEXUS ME AND MY GIRL COME THROUGH, LET'S GET THIS

### fought the cannot sing allegations and LOST

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): this is the fourth fucking song to namedrop Reddit

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That chorus could be a Blackpink chorus (derogatory)

**buddhacharm** (5.5): Hate to tank my fellow Desi but Priyanka desperately needs to stop being a recording artist (still the superior Priyanka in the industry though)

**frogaranaman** (5): me when I’m hooking up a guy named Thru

**flava** (1): just something in the cadence or pacing of priyanka’s singing just activated the hate part of my brain, lemon tries her best though and i can respect that

### I'm a litty, splitty, kitty and I'm back for it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when lemon ended priyanka on her own song just like she ended her on Not Sorry Aboot It 😭

**jay** (10): HES TRYNA FIND MY PUSSY PICS UP ON REDDIT 💃

**ricki** (10): if i were priyanka i would have been mad as fuck at lemon for going off like that on my own song

**musical\_pyn** (9): if this was just lemon's verse it would be an easy 11

**Stryxen** (9): I love you priyanka especially for recognising the greatness of lemons verse enough to let her devour you on your own song

**WaterMagician** (9): I will probably be rapping along to Lemon’s verse in my retirement home

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): if this was only lemon’s verse it would be a ten

**thesmokeylife** (8.7): Lemon’s verse on its own would be an 11. Unfortunately, there’s an entire other song around it.

**letsallpoo** (8): lemon overshadowing priyanka's entire EP with her verse is the drag equivalent of nicki minaj in monster

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I feel like I'm sleeping through Priyanka's part waiting for Lemon's verse, but to her credit I think Priyanka knows that too

**BreeCherie** (7.8): everyone say "Thank you, Lemon"

**impla77** (7.2): Lemon's verse is great, rest is mediocre

**sufjancaesar** (7): Would be a 10 if anything except Lemon’s verse was good

**MrSwearword** (6): Lemon outclassed Peronka on this. Again, DON'T LET GUEST RAPPERS STEAL YOUR MOMENT.

# .......................huh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this actually would’ve been such an easy 11 if lemon’s verse and that outro weren’t here

I think for a lot of people this was the presumed winner, just because it was kinda a standard synthpop track and had a popheads C-lister on it, but this actually never really escaped places 3-6. I don't have many thoughts on this because I think it is just good, not really anything more complex or interesting than that, but the video is very sleigh!

### https://tunnelingforbacon.files.wordpress.com/2011/02/lulu-stew-01.jpg

**uberpigeon** (11): the vile chachki and her dog cooker friend made points

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song is as hot as one of allie x’s dogs

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): was the spirit of Mistress Violet in control when Allie X left her dog in that car?

**TheSheakDown** (6.5): Someone who’s dressed like poodles in the past with a reputation for being horrible to waitstaff doing a collab with someone who dresses like waitstaff with a reputation for being horrible to dogs… their minds.

**shhhneak** (2): Remember when Allie X left her dog in a hot car?

### dom top farrah moan

**celladonn** (11): Obvious 11 as it's the only song I knew going into this rate but like. it slays?

**Pinheadbutglittery** (11): thank you for everything Mrs X

**runaway3212** (11): im giving this an 11 cause it's the most song in this rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): this is the only song here that actually takes itself seriously and tries to actually be a great song, the last minute or so of breakdown is actually so eargasmic

**1998tweety** (10): production is immaculate

**BaconShoes** (10): idk they served here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I would say congrats to her on getting a big name feature but let’s be honest several of the queens in this rate are bigger names than Allie X.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): there’s a chance this will win, and I don’t know if it’s a perfect winner for me, but I can’t deny this rules. Like Violet really gave us a great goth bop

**freav** (10): these verses are so good

**jay** (10): well. Yeah

**nt96** (10): I want this song to choke me

**plastichaxan** (10): Look if this rate is what it takes to get Allie X a rate win I think I'm at peace with that now

**seanderlust** (10): yeah this bangs. violet in dark alt pop 2 when

**sufjancaesar** (10): As a Violet hater… this is incredible

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The aesthetics are immaculate

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): i was told i can give this a 10 thanks everyone. but forreal the more time I spend away from the song the more it reverberates in my head. that's like some sigma brainwashing energy there Violet! good shit! wild looks! everyone did great!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Now this is the kind of h*rny I can get behind

**xophrys** (10): so

**RandomHypnotica** (9.9): i wouldn't complain if this won because an allie win is a spill, but also it would be kinda boring

**BreeCherie** (9.7): queen of industrial cyberpunk

**camerinian** (9.5): it is with a heavy heart that I must tell you that Allie X finally does not feel like an unnecessary presence in a rate

**Stryxen** (9.5): slightly petty non-10 because its my least fav potential Winner but whatever it slays

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.3): i remember i used to hate this song when it first came out but i'm obsessed on this relisten!!!

**2RINITY** (9): Violet, I swear to God, if you don't stop hacking the "songs that belong on a '90s Mortal Kombat tie-in album" part of my brain, I'm gonna fall in love with you

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is too much of a hack that she has Allie X here it’s just not even fair to the other girlies

**vayyiqra** (9): This does go pretty hard and the "dark pop" vibe suits Allie extremely well, I wouldn't be mad if this won

**babadork** (8.6): I can’t ignore that I’d like the song more if Violet wasn’t in it.

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): the chorus is kinda underwhelming if i’m being honest, the verses are really captivating though

**impla77** (8.4): Allie X carried but definitely works better as the dominatrix role rather whatever the fuck that other song was

**MrSwearword** (8): the song is decent but it's scoring this high because of the "MTV video in 1985 that played at three in the morning" realness

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): kinda dont care for allie x in this song tbh

**xedophobic** (8): 8.5 -.5 for all crimes committed by violet chachki

**thesmokeylife** (7.8): Allie’s presence makes the song. Violet does remarkably fine with her own skillset.

### allie x will have to wait a little longer for her rate win

**musical\_pyn** (7): LOVE the production on this but not much else

**TiltControls** (7): having allie here feels like cheating a bit

**CrimsonROSET** (4): yawn

**flava** (3): sleepy music, no wonder Allie X is here

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): I still don’t get why people are gagging over this, it’s literally just them talking over a flaccid beat with some Garage Band loops thrown on top.

**frogaranaman** (1): Florence Pugh to Harry Styles in Don't Worry Darling

### i can always trust buddha to be anti white when we need it <3 thank you for your service

**buddhacharm** (0): So this is only somewhat relevant but I once competed as Allie X in a fake pop industry simulator and won the season because I was the only person who was committed to it by the end of the season (I like ... wrote songs in her voice, curated a whole aesthetic, designed album arts, etc.). I was fully in like... 6th or 7th grade? I like... literally wrote a whole like 3 page long manifesto about some fictional beef she had with Ellie Goulding... like this was some real crazy brainrot shit (Ellie was eliminated early on in this simulator fyi). Anyways I loathe this song but mostly because of Violet, I hope Allie never collabs with her again

The way history has been rewritten, people HATED Priyanka's music when it first came out but ever since Lemon's verse went viral everyone switched up. Can Pri sing? No. Can Pri make good music? YES. This was top three pretty much the whole rate I think it would've been a slay winner but like Lemon it will remain robbed.

---

### dont even have to ask for it for me to get it

**1998tweety** (11): As a Canadian I'm legally obligated to give this my 11, they both ate too.

**akanewasright** (11): idc they hit the slay button

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): This and Cocky were the two songs I kept seeing referred to as frontrunners is the Discord. I know what team I’m on.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): gosh this is so fun

**RandomHypnotica** (11): cunt

**TiltControls** (11): i love canada vs the world

**TragicKingdom1** (11): i wish i had a less basic 11 considering i went into this rate blind but this is just the best written and produced song in the rate by a mile

### justin trudeau being a guest on canvtw actually makes me ctfu

**amr** (10): toronto!

**BaconShoes** (10): an iconic canadian classic tbh

**chihkeyNOPE** (10): Yes Lemon is great but Priyanka’s parts are good too!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the insane thing about this is that neither of them can sing

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m not even required to inquire after what I desire in order to attain it, for when people lay eyes upon my posterior in these garments it costs a premium. Your father (in particular) deposits exorbitant amounts of currency on it as well, something you would do well to remember- he attempts to find pornographic images of my privates on online message boards. Lip makeup stains the marijuana, but I will not apologize as it is Rihanna’s brand. I’m not attempting to peacock– and yet we do so in spades. By the time the evening reaches its conclusion, your reserve of funds will be depleted. Indeed, Primon are the proprietors of the year two decades past the second millennium. Similar to neck ornamentation declaring eternal companionship, a roster of only the most exclusive attendees, causing men to cease breathing due to our cavalier behaviors, a grin that begets similar emotion, arrive in a luxury automobile– my female friend and I traverse the premises, allow us to achieve our goals.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song made me rethink what I considered TikTok hits cause like there's always a 60% chance it's only a hit for a gay TikTok niche and nothing else

**skylofte2** (10): baga chipz you call yourself the people's princess and i agree because this is a car crash

**vayyiqra** (10): TORONTO ?! hey thats me and also this goes extremely hard and it's fun

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): intro is an 11; like this legit has insane 30 rock energy oozing out. i was dyin

**welcome2thejam** (10): Everyone doing this rate on streaming and not through the music videos are missing out

**elite4\_beyonce** (9.5): That Lemon verse is so fucking fierce we tend to forget the rest of the song is also good

**2RINITY** (9): This instrumental is HOT

**adeleade** (9): tbh i do feel that priyanka's music is underrated esp when people hyped lemon's verse so much that they did not realise that priyankas music is generally p good at least by drag queen standards lol

**runaway3212** (9): okay come through

**shhhneak** (9): Another Toronto name-dropping rapper SHOULD be nervous.

**DefaultPophead** (8): damn these queens and their reddit

**TheSheakDown** (7.2): Okay Lemon’s verse was good but it wasn’t THAT good

**camerinian** (7): all these queens name dropping Reddit, how many of them are gonna be quietly sitting in the reveal thread

**uberpigeon** (7): DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK FOR IT FOR ME TO GET IT WHEN YOU SEE MY ASS IN THIS, I CHARGE CREDIT YOUR DAD DROPS STACKS ON THIS AND DON'T FORGET IT HE'S TRYNA FIND MY PUSSY PICS UP ON REDDIT GLOSS ON THE BLUNT, AIN'T SORRY IT'S FENTY DON'T MEAN TO STUNT BUT WE STUNTIN', PLENTY END OF THE NIGHT AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNT EMPTY YEAH, LEMYANKA OWN 2020 IT'S LIKE BFF NECKLACE, VIP GUEST LIST LEAVIN' BOYS BREATHLESS WHEN WE GET RECKLESS SMILE IS INFECTIOUS, ROLL UP IN A LEXUS ME AND MY GIRL COME THROUGH, LET'S GET THIS

### fought the cannot sing allegations and LOST

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): this is the fourth fucking song to namedrop Reddit

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That chorus could be a Blackpink chorus (derogatory)

**buddhacharm** (5.5): Hate to tank my fellow Desi but Priyanka desperately needs to stop being a recording artist (still the superior Priyanka in the industry though)

**frogaranaman** (5): me when I’m hooking up a guy named Thru

**flava** (1): just something in the cadence or pacing of priyanka’s singing just activated the hate part of my brain, lemon tries her best though and i can respect that

### I'm a litty, splitty, kitty and I'm back for it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when lemon ended priyanka on her own song just like she ended her on Not Sorry Aboot It 😭

**jay** (10): HES TRYNA FIND MY PUSSY PICS UP ON REDDIT 💃

**ricki** (10): if i were priyanka i would have been mad as fuck at lemon for going off like that on my own song

**musical\_pyn** (9): if this was just lemon's verse it would be an easy 11

**Stryxen** (9): I love you priyanka especially for recognising the greatness of lemons verse enough to let her devour you on your own song

**WaterMagician** (9): I will probably be rapping along to Lemon’s verse in my retirement home

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): if this was only lemon’s verse it would be a ten

**thesmokeylife** (8.7): Lemon’s verse on its own would be an 11. Unfortunately, there’s an entire other song around it.

**letsallpoo** (8): lemon overshadowing priyanka's entire EP with her verse is the drag equivalent of nicki minaj in monster

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I feel like I'm sleeping through Priyanka's part waiting for Lemon's verse, but to her credit I think Priyanka knows that too

**BreeCherie** (7.8): everyone say "Thank you, Lemon"

**impla77** (7.2): Lemon's verse is great, rest is mediocre

**sufjancaesar** (7): Would be a 10 if anything except Lemon’s verse was good

**MrSwearword** (6): Lemon outclassed Peronka on this. Again, DON'T LET GUEST RAPPERS STEAL YOUR MOMENT.

# .......................huh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this actually would’ve been such an easy 11 if lemon’s verse and that outro weren’t here

Now I am a both a Shea and Priyanka stan, but I think of the three songs I was rooting for this, of the entire rate this song feels the most like it transcends being a song by a drag queen, it's just a great song.

---

### RATATATITITATA

**BetteDavid** (11): ngl this may be the best rugirl song ever...

**DirtyRat583** (11): this feels like rebirth

**musical\_pyn** (11): this is one of like three songs I would actually play to people outside of this rate, and is my favorite of those three. easy pick

**nt96** (11): a slay theme song dedicated to my smash bros main and robbed VGI contestant YASSSSS

**1998tweety** (10): huge bop

**akanewasright** (10): this just sounds like sunshine… like…

**apatel27** (10): afrobeats ftw

**bogo** (10): this song is like the mother oasis in the middle of a desert of mediocre drag queen music

**camerinian** (10): God after so much in your face  music it's so nice to just have a vibrant, well balanced afrobeat jam that still feels so drag in its presentation. This is a full on bop.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly bebe deserves everything in the world especially because she backs it up with quality

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m obsessed with this song, it’s ridiculous but just so joyful

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): I kept adjusting my rating upwards the more I listened to this until I decided it was in fact perfect. It truly soars in the last couple of minutes

**freav** (10): frankly so good, id love if this one won

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): “back up give me fifteen feet” social distancing queen! Anyways, in case no one else mentions it, the reason she’s singing about a banjo is because although it’s kinda become associated with the American south [the instrument actually has roots in Africa.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/rhiannon-giddens-american-music-history-21st-century-sound-180971449/) Anyways I really like this song but any time I hear it I just think about a person being skinned and their constituent body parts being used to craft a banjo.

**plastichaxan** (10): I listened to this every single week when I used to watch drag race on twitch this is a favorite for Latinas

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when im deleted forever or something idk

**shhhneak** (10): This is probably in my top ten most viewed music videos.

**Stryxen** (10): mother

**sufjancaesar** (10): Everything Bebe touches is gold and this is no exception

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): and kazooie

**thesmokeylife** (10): Top-tier. Definite contender for an 11.

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): YES *space ghost voice* BANJO BANJO BANJOOOO

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (9.4): this is the hardest one i had to judge yet, i love it but something feels missing to push it to perfection... i love the outro especially

**seanderlust** (9.3): LOVE the instrumental here

**2RINITY** (9): Love how the arrangement builds over the course of the song, especially the percussion & backing vocals

**welcome2thejam** (9): We need the Banjo/Spiral Mountain mashup

**BaconShoes** (8): this was lovely

**frogaranaman** (8): this goes way too hard

**ImADudeDuh** (8): choosing a banjo for an instrument that someone “played you” like is iconic

**MrSwearword** (8): I did embrace Jungle Kitty a bit more than Bebe's releases post JK but at least this has a simplicity in the production that's worth the run time

**runaway3212** (8): kinda yass kinda slay

**TiltControls** (8): it's corny but Bebe has the charisma to actually pull it off unlike a lot of other queens here. plus the production absolutely kills

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the chorus is the worse part of this song but everything else kind of slaps

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): There’s something about this mixing. It’s like she’s singing directly into the back of my brain. That’s not an entirely pleasant feeling but the song is cute!

**jay** (7): that BEAT! I have to stand up

**slimboyfriend** (7): I’m obsessed with the way she speaks

### BAN~~JO~~ them

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I like the parts where she doesn’t rap

**babadork** (6): I think I would like this song a lot more if it was shorter. It’s a little too repetitive.

**vayyiqra** (6): lol this is a little silly but fun

**flava** (2): is there even a banjo on this, don’t bait me with country music and give me uk rap

**chihkeyNOPE** (10): Yes Lemon is great but Priyanka’s parts are good too!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the insane thing about this is that neither of them can sing

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m not even required to inquire after what I desire in order to attain it, for when people lay eyes upon my posterior in these garments it costs a premium. Your father (in particular) deposits exorbitant amounts of currency on it as well, something you would do well to remember- he attempts to find pornographic images of my privates on online message boards. Lip makeup stains the marijuana, but I will not apologize as it is Rihanna’s brand. I’m not attempting to peacock– and yet we do so in spades. By the time the evening reaches its conclusion, your reserve of funds will be depleted. Indeed, Primon are the proprietors of the year two decades past the second millennium. Similar to neck ornamentation declaring eternal companionship, a roster of only the most exclusive attendees, causing men to cease breathing due to our cavalier behaviors, a grin that begets similar emotion, arrive in a luxury automobile– my female friend and I traverse the premises, allow us to achieve our goals.

**plastichaxan** (10): This song made me rethink what I considered TikTok hits cause like there's always a 60% chance it's only a hit for a gay TikTok niche and nothing else

**skylofte2** (10): baga chipz you call yourself the people's princess and i agree because this is a car crash

**vayyiqra** (10): TORONTO ?! hey thats me and also this goes extremely hard and it's fun

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (10): intro is an 11; like this legit has insane 30 rock energy oozing out. i was dyin

**welcome2thejam** (10): Everyone doing this rate on streaming and not through the music videos are missing out

**elite4\_beyonce** (9.5): That Lemon verse is so fucking fierce we tend to forget the rest of the song is also good

**2RINITY** (9): This instrumental is HOT

**adeleade** (9): tbh i do feel that priyanka's music is underrated esp when people hyped lemon's verse so much that they did not realise that priyankas music is generally p good at least by drag queen standards lol

**runaway3212** (9): okay come through

**shhhneak** (9): Another Toronto name-dropping rapper SHOULD be nervous.

**DefaultPophead** (8): damn these queens and their reddit

**TheSheakDown** (7.2): Okay Lemon’s verse was good but it wasn’t THAT good

**camerinian** (7): all these queens name dropping Reddit, how many of them are gonna be quietly sitting in the reveal thread

**uberpigeon** (7): DON'T EVEN HAVE TO ASK FOR IT FOR ME TO GET IT WHEN YOU SEE MY ASS IN THIS, I CHARGE CREDIT YOUR DAD DROPS STACKS ON THIS AND DON'T FORGET IT HE'S TRYNA FIND MY PUSSY PICS UP ON REDDIT GLOSS ON THE BLUNT, AIN'T SORRY IT'S FENTY DON'T MEAN TO STUNT BUT WE STUNTIN', PLENTY END OF THE NIGHT AND YOUR BANK ACCOUNT EMPTY YEAH, LEMYANKA OWN 2020 IT'S LIKE BFF NECKLACE, VIP GUEST LIST LEAVIN' BOYS BREATHLESS WHEN WE GET RECKLESS SMILE IS INFECTIOUS, ROLL UP IN A LEXUS ME AND MY GIRL COME THROUGH, LET'S GET THIS

### fought the cannot sing allegations and LOST

**GlialUreterostenosis** (6): this is the fourth fucking song to namedrop Reddit

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That chorus could be a Blackpink chorus (derogatory)

**buddhacharm** (5.5): Hate to tank my fellow Desi but Priyanka desperately needs to stop being a recording artist (still the superior Priyanka in the industry though)

**frogaranaman** (5): me when I’m hooking up a guy named Thru

**flava** (1): just something in the cadence or pacing of priyanka’s singing just activated the hate part of my brain, lemon tries her best though and i can respect that

### I'm a litty, splitty, kitty and I'm back for it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when lemon ended priyanka on her own song just like she ended her on Not Sorry Aboot It 😭

**jay** (10): HES TRYNA FIND MY PUSSY PICS UP ON REDDIT 💃

**ricki** (10): if i were priyanka i would have been mad as fuck at lemon for going off like that on my own song

**musical\_pyn** (9): if this was just lemon's verse it would be an easy 11

**Stryxen** (9): I love you priyanka especially for recognising the greatness of lemons verse enough to let her devour you on your own song

**WaterMagician** (9): I will probably be rapping along to Lemon’s verse in my retirement home

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): if this was only lemon’s verse it would be a ten

**thesmokeylife** (8.7): Lemon’s verse on its own would be an 11. Unfortunately, there’s an entire other song around it.

**letsallpoo** (8): lemon overshadowing priyanka's entire EP with her verse is the drag equivalent of nicki minaj in monster

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I feel like I'm sleeping through Priyanka's part waiting for Lemon's verse, but to her credit I think Priyanka knows that too

**BreeCherie** (7.8): everyone say "Thank you, Lemon"

**impla77** (7.2): Lemon's verse is great, rest is mediocre

**sufjancaesar** (7): Would be a 10 if anything except Lemon’s verse was good

**MrSwearword** (6): Lemon outclassed Peronka on this. Again, DON'T LET GUEST RAPPERS STEAL YOUR MOMENT.

# .......................huh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): this actually would’ve been such an easy 11 if lemon’s verse and that outro weren’t here

Watching this win as an unhinged Shea stan has just been... phenomenal. That's all I really have to say, in a rate full of attempts at real songs Shea actually successfully made a real song. AND A GOOD ONE AT THAT!!! /u/buddhacharm /u/sufjancaesar WE WON!! WE DID IT!!!!!

---

### we have worked tirelessly but we did it besties

**buddhacharm** (11): This is the only song made by a drag artist that I unironically play around people in my life. I remember when it leaked on YouTube like an hour before the episode came out and I looped it like 10 times and made sure to manually log all of those scrobbles on openscrobbler.com so that I could be #1 in Chuu 💀  I'm #33 now but we move

**sufjancaesar** (10): Mother.

### ⭐⭐⭐

**kndight23** (11): Without a doubt the best song from a drag queen I’ve heard. A lot of times there’s this notion about “drag music” and songs that are specifically for the gays and the clubs but this has a lot of mainstream appeal imo. It’s very Bruno Mars and Janet Jackson. A different sound for Shea that totally works, her voice does not disappoint, and it’s just a feel-good catchy bop.

**Penis\_D\_Lite** (11): idgaf she deserved those 3 stars

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): She deserved every single one of those three stars and if you disagree then you're ugly, I don't give a damn

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): She does The Weeknd better than The Weeknd

**WaterMagician** (11): this is honestly pop perfection in my mind and I can listen to it endlessly

**welcome2thejam** (11): Writing this song's name on my palm so I can remember there's some actual great-sounding music in this rate

**1998tweety** (10): one of the BEST ru girl songs ever

**akanewasright** (10): Janet Jackson is honestly a better singer than she’s usually given credit for, but she *has* inspired a whole bunch of singers who cannot sing, and some of them even made good music. Shea joins the likes of Cassie, Keri Hilson, and Jennifer Lopez in choosing the right icon to claim inspiration from for her paper thin voice, and like the former two, she gets a damn good song out of it

**BaconShoes** (10): I was going to say this sounds like a Sam Sparro song, but apparently he was involved in the writing and production so that makes sense lol. It’s groovy and sleek and a bop

**CrimsonROSET** (10): vote for anime opening themes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): both songs in the music video are so good hello

**fkadizzy-1804** (10): I will now and always be a sucker for a retro funk/disco moment and this one is EXCELLENTLY executed. No notes.

**frogaranaman** (10): this sounds like something the subreddit would go apeshit over if some white girl released it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): popheads chart smash hit

**jay** (10): if bruno released this it would be #1 on the hot 100 for 147 consecutive weeks

**plastichaxan** (10): Popheads better be eating this up it’s literally made for you

**qould** (10): qould

**RandomHypnotica** (10): vote anime rate <3

**Stryxen** (10): deserved this challenge win AND the finale placement from it stay mad

**thesmokeylife** (10): Perfection. No notes.

**TiltControls** (10): sometimes when the queens go more serious it flops but shea kills it here

**babadork** (9.5): I’m choosing to rate this as though the music video doesn’t combine this with Let Go, which I don’t think is nearly as good as this song.

**xophrys** (9.5): u/xophrys

**2RINITY** (9): Disco-revival tracks have a high bar to clear with me, 'cause I'm tired of people saying "Disco's back!" every time one of these things drops--sweetie, it's been back for like 8 years now, did you hit your head?--but fortunately, Shea's ear-catching vocals instantly gave this song a reason to exist

**camerinian** (9): well this is just a bloody jam isn't it

**slimboyfriend** (9): I can’t believe she tried to make a serious pop song and it kinda worked

**uberpigeon** (9): i was tricked and fooled and deceived and lied to by the double video

**amr** (8.8): makoto shinkai U're nothing btw

**WaneLietoc\_NotedDragEnthusiastWhoBlindListened&WatchedThese** (8.8): i got two songs for the price of one thanks

**fadedblue09** (8.5): this is actually decent wow

**impla77** (8.5): lyrics feel like they could be written by an ai

**celladonn** (8): kind of generic but i'm bopping

**cremeebrulee** (8): i’m actually so stupid bc when i saw this on the ballot i instinctually typed in my legal name

**vayyiqra** (8): bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): me when someone asks what the name of that anime movie about the kids who swap bodies is

**BKRGX/echo#6842** (7.4): funky!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**TheSheakDown** (7): Something cute, something for the summer, something for the girls to get ready to also I have no idea why but the instrumentation at the chorus makes me think of the gambling music from Pokemon Heartgold 😭😭

### its actually so funny the amount of people i had to message back telling them they missed a score for this song because they thought it was a mistake in the ballot 💀💀💀

**apatel27** (6): It's good but it's yet another 80s disco throwback in the year 2022

**GlialUreterostenosis** (5): I should like this more than I do

**MrSwearword** (5): the production is a serve.

**runaway3212** (4.5): I said I liked this in the queup room but it's lowkey so boring sorry poppy bestie

### she's doing her best okay!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Oh this production is fun! I wish she could sing!

**elite4\_beyonce** (7): great beat but i hate the falsetto

**ignitethephoenix** (7): love how this sounds but I wish someone else sang it oop

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Imagine how good this song would be if Shea could sing

[Songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) and [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) have been updated!

## **Songs**

Congrats to **Shea Couleé** for prevailing over the other queens with a win for **Your Name**! Was really hoping for my 11 to pull through, but this was another I'm glad with winning!

* Across all winners (156) **Your Name** places **149th**
 * It places right above Hannah Diamond - Concrete Angel and right below Poppy - I Disagree
* Across all songs (7755) **Your Name** places **701st**
 * It places right above Madonna - Lucky Star and Kylie Minogue - Come Into My World and right below Curtis Mayfield - No Thing On Me and Janet Jackson - Miss You Much


**Other Stats**

* With a staggeringly low 2.515, **Pandora Boxx's Oops I Think I Pooped** becomes the 5th lowest scoring song ever rated on the sub
 * The only songs to have scored lower are Lil Dicky's Earth, Kip Moore's Somthin' Bout a Truck, Farrah Abraham's On My Own, and Rihanna's Birthday Cake Remix with Chris Brown
* **Oops I Think I Pooped** takes another top ten leaderboard spot for the 8th most 0's with 28
 * This puts it above Farrah Abraham's On My Own and below black midi's bmbmbm
* Yet another record for **Oops I Think I Pooped** as it gets 4th place for the Zero Magnets leaderboard. It got 29.78% of the rates' 0s!
 * Ahead of it are again Earth (47.40%), Birthday Cake - Remix (42.90%), and On My Own (37.50%)
* **Serena Chacha's Drag Money** breaks one of the few constants known to this sub and takes The Chainsmoker's Closer as the most controversial song rated on the sub (3.869 vs Closer's 3.845)
 * This is the first time since March of 2017 that a song that isn't Closer by The Chainsmokers featuring Halsey has been the most controversial song rated by Popheads. (Pre-Closer era the record went from Tayor's Shake It Off to Kesha's Dinosaur to Madonna's American Pie cover)
 * **DWV's (Detox, Willam & Vicki Vox) Boy Is A Bottom** also ends up on the chart, placing as the 9th most controversial song we've ever rated. It was slightly more controversial than Dopesmoker's Sleep from Charity Rate 3 and less controversial than Fifth Harmony's Work From Home in the X-Factor Excellence rate

soupcereal: A fantastic afternoon of bops, mother worship and kiki-ing with the girlies was had. Fully deserved by Shea Coulee, may mother continue to release bops after Ironheart wraps filming. 

Thank you to the 20 ladies of taste and distinction who voted Feeling Fruity, and special thank you to King for putting this whole thing together. It’s that star quality, you’ve got it kiddo!
