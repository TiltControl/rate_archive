What is [drag](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/730599206611451975/1026353339325235200/drag_rate_cover.jpg)? What is a [RuPaul](https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/980/azure/dazed-prod/1280/3/1283985.jpg)? Can it hurt me?

Drag as an artform has existed [for centuries](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p61FUTmjjvQ), throughout history it has taken shape in Jacobean performance, Dynastic Chinese operas and back-alley New York clubs. One thing is a consistent though, it has always been on the fringe of society, always there but never acknowledged. Always afloat, but [never mainstream](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hnHEWU-WhGE). That is, until RuPaul.

RuPaul rose to fame in 1993 with the release of single ["Supermodel"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4nTl4Rmf6AI) after over a decade of being a [club-kid, genderfuck performer](https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/500/azure/dazed-prod/1120/6/1126486.jpg) in Atlanta and New York, attempting success in music and [film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qzGt55fRpo). The success of Supermodel, a dance hit in an age of grunge and hip-hop, was unprecedented, no less unapolagetically fronted by a drag queen. The success of this launched RuPaul to be a household name, even if every household wasn't happy to have him, and gave him the platform to have his own [talk show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cHKgt8ZNpgs), put out numerous cult-classic albums (*available on iTunes*) and most importantly of all, produce and host his own reality show in hopes to find *America's Next Drag Superstar*.

RuPaul's Drag Race (2009-) poetically began the same way drag did, as a lampoon of it's environment. By the late 2000s reality TV had [already become a parody of itself](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va17uUBKxR8), and Drag Race (or "RuPauls" as any straight person will try and call it) represents that. It styles itself after Top Model, but the Drag Race producers are in on the joke! They know how crazy it is! They know how silly the show is! They know how [insane the twists are](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZbJr3w6J5SM)! Or at least, they did then. Over the past 13 years Drag Race has truly become a beast of it's own, with endless international spin-offs, formula re-jigs and hundreds and hundreds of drag queens given a platform and let loose into the world. RuPaul's Drag Race is an Emmy Record Breaking show, internationally adored and discussed, so has drag finally gone... \*shudders* mainstream???

Well, [no](https://64.media.tumblr.com/9fa7a82ac81b57bb6e6fd152217ee03f/a838482e35634d44-c0/s250x400/8f1199a34096ace2f79f5f39a58573f240ca0b0d.gifv). Not in my opinion at least. RuPaul certainly isn't right about everything, but I do think he's right here, drag in it's essence can never be mainstream. Drag is a rough, gritty subversive artform that thrives in the [ugly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CWPomxnEGBg) and the reprehensible, drag as it exists day to day and in its truest form will never be mainstream, but that doesn't mean members of the community and elements of the artform still can't achieve mainstream success. While "drag" may not be conventional, Drag *Race* certainly is. Sure we are being fed a more palatable version of drag that is safe and adherent to network television, but it is still brilliant entertainment and don't let anyone shame you for loving it. Many of the queens from the show have more talent in their pinkies than I do in my whole body, they have proven they can have their own [makeup brands](https://trixiecosmetics.com/), [TV shows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KRaFf66KLMU), [sell-out tours](https://attitude.co.uk/article/drag-races-jinkx-monsoon-and-bendelacreme-return-for-the-jinkx-dela-holiday-show/27412/) and yes, even music careers.

It became somewhat of a meme within the fandom of how many queens were releasing music, and how many shouldn't be, it became the standard for a queen to go on the show, milk a catchphrase, and make a club track out of it. But in their defence, some of them are actually **good**. Of course, this logic also undersells the artistry many queens *have* put into their music. Due to how inherently limitless drag is as an artform, it invites all different types of creatives, different styles, different tastes, and of course different abilities. As you'll discover, the music released by drag race alumni is fucking wild in how it varies, and this is by far one of the widest genre-spanning rates we've ever done and I am [so excited](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w65jPeaLfas) to get into it.

## [Alaska](https://media.timeout.com/images/102779560/image.jpg)

I think if you asked a machine to create a queen who represented drag race inside and out, it'd give you Alaska. Well it'd give you [Slaytina](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DlRilje2rw) and then it'd give you Alaska. She has the perfect success story: auditioning [endlessly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bU0FH_oxFQE) for the first four seasons; her partner (Sharon Needles) getting on S4, winning and changing the shape of drag; for Lasky to finally get on Season 5 and finish [inches from the crown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6AGfu2tMLg); only to make her grand return on All Stars 2, with an [iconic](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlnNt7D2OdA) run and one of the most formiddable and intense front-runners the show has ever seen. Now knowing a queen's performance on the show is not necessary to enjoying their music, but with Alaska I *do* think it enhances it, her strive for perfection and unending dedication shows in her work.

Having released four albums since her debut on the show and numerous [loose tracks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IZ1d2TSSq2E), Alaska is probably the epitome of "drag music" - electronic, campy, quoteable and fun! She knows how to make a song out of every iconic moment she's had on and off the show, and is actually able to make them quite good songs while doing that.

## [Monét X Change](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a7c86fdd74cff83be159434/1587152134187-OZ9C5JPDUS8C356FAT7L/mxc_print.png)

One of the real powerhouse triple threats to come from the show, Monét was an [NYC staple](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hQ6FcbVgkww) before she got on S10, with a great but slightly patchy run. She then got onto All Stars 4 and made herstory being one half of the show's only to date double win, and came back onto All Winners this year and kinda [destroyed across the board](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHWUsdwVqBo), *just* missing the crown. Monét's music selection might be the most diverse in this rate, from rap to pop to reggae to opera, in that order, she's shown she can really do anything put in front of her. *Love Like This* is my personal favourite, a smooth reggae track showing her Saint [Lucian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9XI4jusRYoU) roots that you'd never guess was by a drag queen just from hearing it.

## [Trixie Mattel](https://media.gq.com/photos/5a1c5a05c9f57e274eeeb101/master/pass/trixie-mattel-GQ-02.JPG)

If you only know one name on this list I wouldn't be surprised if it were Trixie, the epitome of a queen who is [not defined by drag race](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yVTISisKiaM), only using it as a platform to launch herself into so many other fields. Musically she really is in her own lane, as a high femme gay pop-country artist she cites legends like [June Carter Cash](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jalb-A41oo0) and [Dolly Parton](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L0eeSoU35wM) as her inspiration, and from her album *Barbra* onwards has leaned more and more into pop rock in the vein of [The Go-Go's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f55KlPe81Yw). Trixie really can do it all, being a makeup mogul and a successful youtuber it can be easy to overlook her music career as "just another venture", but she's proven there she's once again on a level of her own.

## [Adore Delano](https://i0.wp.com/wikifamouspeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/Adore-Delano.jpg?fit=1080%2C1350&ssl=1)

Getting a small start on [American Idol](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7LxwJw8sT4E) as a 17 year old, Adore (as Danny Noreiga) built up a [large YouTube following](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wj_ne1VhBu4), so going into her performance on Season 6 of Drag Race she was easily [the biggest fan favourite the show had seen](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNPUvl0ad5k), finishing as a runner-up. Her 2014 debut and 2016 sophomore albums (*Til Death Do Us Party* & *After Party respectively*) are very reminiscent of an in between of early 2010s electropop and mid 2010s tumblrcore, until the lean she took much farther into the punk of her drag mirrored itself in her music as in her grunge album, *Whatever*.

2. [Take Me There](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2-Swhla258)
3. [27 Club](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=760OcqvoMok)

## [Bob the Drag Queen](https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/djournal.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/6d/e6de5cc0-3c78-52db-b0df-1b916d4cbbe1/615e41e4229fc.image.jpg)

Bob's music doesn't reinvent the wheel or anything, but with the amount of other ventures she has, it doesn't need to. "Purse First" is a vogue track named after her [catchphrase](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/GTwpMjotO9o) from Season 8, and "Yet Another Dig" is nothing short of iconic - Released the year after both her and Alaska's win, it's a song for the drag race superfans, packed with references and in-jokes and it's executed so damn well. Bob's known for so much more outside of the cheesy drag race music sphere, [her hit HBO show](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=048WnAatbPA&t=89s), [her stand-up specials](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=smOaqKhs_k4) but dont let that make you think her cheesy drag race music isn't good.

## [Shea Couleé](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D1zCC4dWoAAZuxQ.jpg:large)

Shea has described her drag as "a love letter to black women", and it shows in her references and her inspirations. Her runway walk modelled after [Naomi Campbell](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/AmH2knARXCA), fashions [Grace Jones](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBj2T6EXUAIXNU2.jpg:large) would be proud of, choregraphy straight out of a [Beyoncé](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aLjvObYUzQU) video, and yet it is all still uniquely Shea. She's able to twist and combine her visions into something [only she could create](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WtAYdUIML0I), and the same is true of her music. Dipping its toes in unbothered rap (the iconic "Cocky") and disco-infused-pop (three star worthy song "Your Name"), Shea's musical ventures have always been purposeful and refined, not to mention with incredible visuals.

## [Yvie Oddly](https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/480/azure/dazed-prod/1260/7/1267833.jpg)

Self proclaimed ["queen of the queerdos"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prDxgP_HeB0), Yvie is one of the biggest representatives of "'new'" drag race and new school drag here, having won S11 with her [pure talent](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKQUGBdgNHc) more than anything expressly shown in the drag race format. Pretty soon after winning she dropped her debut single, ["Dolla Store"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KcUiEBORgh4)a rap song about her creativity on a budget, and in 2021 dropped her mixtape appropriately named "Drag Trap" with a featurelist of [queens and friends from her local scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT-O3unPsNM), including future winner Willow Pill, where they rap about their chronic illnesses.

2. [Sick Bitch (feat. Willow Pill)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QJTmwcT8M6A)
3. [Winner Winner (Chicken Dinner Remix) (feat. Bebe Zahara Benet and Shea Couleé)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqMQ6Gqap3U)

## [Aja](https://media.them.us/photos/5b3bc0f2ea05c100105f839b/master/pass/Aja.jpg)

This is only tangentially related to the rate, but Aja's journey as a RuGirl I find so fascinating. A [huge deal](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T6tdKpzWzVw) in the NYC scene going into Season 9 despite only being 22, she kind of bombed and was [pretty harshly judged](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yLTnRPoP2OM) in the eyes of the fandom, before immediately going into All Stars 3 a massive underdog and [earning back all her goodwill](https://youtu.be/5nAISk-zA_Y?t=894) with no expectation on her. I say tangentially because the main theme of 'Finish Her!', released post-AS3, is Aja's fan reception, told via rap and a pretty sick video game visual.

1. [Finish Her!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=safM-tI6os0)
2. [Brujería](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9m_Ffxxxlc)

## [Bebe Zahara Benet](https://www.advocate.com/sites/default/files/styles/vertical_gallery_desktop_1x/public/20-fur-3.jpg?timestamp=1637689421)

The true OG, winner of the first ever season of the show and still one of the most [refined](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e2Xy91w9t0Y) queens to ever be on the show. It's a crime it took us so long to get music from her after ["face face face, I give face, beauty face"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N3RB_56WziA), but it was well worth the wait. Her music is afro-pop perfection, and holds up well on its own against *aCtUaL* music outside the drag race sphere, which is more than can be said for other queens. 

1. [Banjo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ruEgRpx_8-E)
2. [Body On Me](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6nb_q3SFmw)

## [Jujubee](https://wildmusejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/jujubee-banner.jpg)

Juju is a fan favourite who's really stood the test of time, gaining new fans on all four times she's competed on the show with her [undeniable charisma](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CS2f2s2FKo0). She clearly takes real pride in her music and her singing, her debut single 'Don't Wanna Love' a passion project, it's rare a Rugirl will kick off their music "career" with a ballad. Though her venture on [Queen of the Universe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=trIV_UarzsM) proved... unfruitful, she's sung several times on the show to praise and her music is definitely to be taken seriously.

2. [Bad Juju (feat. Shea Couleé)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnQjHmmZid8)

## [Violet Chachki](https://www.gaytimes.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Violet-Chachki.png)

Six years ago Violet co-starred in Allie X's video for ~~future rate winner~~ [All The Rage](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1JfQ_rthvI), not long after narrowly winning Season 7, marking the start of a very fashionable and very horsegirl core friendship. Mistress Violet is just one of the fruits of their collaboration and is a sexy dark synthpop bop, which Violet's [love of Kylie Minogue](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PdzIk6Zk6Mg) is clear on. Before this she'd released a hardcore fetish edm(?) inspired EP in 2015 to not much noise, before delving more into theatrical and burlesque music to fit with her drag.

## [Miscellaneous](https://gcn.ie/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/vulture.jpg)

But the rate wouldn't be complete with just the notable musicians, a lot of queens haven't released as much music as other queens but that doesn't mean they're not contenders. Included here are viral tiktok hits (Come Through, Boy Is A Bottom), drag staples (Hot Couture, Legs, Werqin' Girl), non-English songs (A Prueba De Todo, XIXI, Clam Happy), fan favs (Ding Dong!, God Save This Queen, The Same Parts), *unique* renditions of iconic songs (Drag Money, My Neck, My Back, Oops I Think I Pooped) and so much more. Servin' It Up is the oldest song in the rate, being released in 2006, BOO! features Aiden's sister Saint of Dragula, Angle is a collaboration between the two breakout stars of the recent Season 14, just to name a few.

# Rules

Most of you know all of this, but if you don’t, **please** read this!! And if you then still have any questions about the rate process or the formatting of your ballot or anything, feel free to ask away :D 

- You must listen to and submit a score for every song, **ballots with missing scores will not be accepted and you will be asked to submit a score**

- **Each song must be scored between a 1 and a 10 (with exception of an optional 0 and 11).** Scores are allowed to one decimal point but no further, meaning you are allowed to score something a 5.5 or a 9.7, but a 5.42 or 9.75 *will* make the rate machine act all goofy so please don’t. ^(Also please make sure to use periods and not commas for any decimal places)

- Your **11** and **0** are reserved for one song each in the whole rate. You aren’t obligated to use either of them at all, but **they are fun to use**

- Please [*please*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1RoxNxt6oI4) **use the message format linked in this post**, and if that doesn’t work, just use [**this pastee formatted ballot**](https://pastebin.com/6LxcFJ1B) and send it to me with that.

- If you want to change any of your scores after you submit them, **message me on [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=Awkward_King&subject=&message=) or discord (king!#2326)**. So long as it is before the final due date that should be okay :)

- **Your scores are not considered confidential**, you are free to talk about them once you have submitted them (you are also free to keep it all to yourself til your reveal) ~~meaning I am also allowed to publicly drag the bad ballots I get~~

- Including comments in your ballot is not mandatory, however if you do include any they **must be formatted like this**:

> C.L.A.T.: 10 cussy lussy aussy tussy

Any other formats will simply be rejected, such as:

> Servin' It Up!: 9, and she was!!!

> Drag Money: (2) death to all chacharinas

> Your Name: 7 - u/buddhacharm you will always be famous

- You can also leave artist comments, but if you do, **make sure you put a colon at the end of the queen's name**, for example:

> Queen: Monét X Change**:** robbed on as7

- Finally, and this one should be obvious, **do not sabotage specific queens for petty reasons**. You are free to dislike certain queens or their music and have your scores reflect that, but just make sure if you think your score is odd you provide valid reasoning for it. I may ask you to provide comment if you give low scores to otherwise well loved songs that seem like you just giving them that so they don't win, but this is gonna be a messy rate so a lot of things will probably slide

---

That should be all! Any questions on any of this at all please DM me, I appreciate any and all ballots so anything I can do to help you understand/complete it is my pleasure. The Rate will be due **FRIDAY THE 18TH OF NOVEMBER**, subject to possible change and if it is changed i'll edit that here :)
