I love this song as the opener to *Love You to Death* because I think it sets the tone of the album immediately. Tegan and Sara wrote this album when they were going through a bit of sibling rivalry, feeling tension within the artistic world they had created together and wondering if that world could continue to be supported. “That Girl,” however, allows the album to begin with an introspective question, making Tegan and Sara ask themselves individually how they got into the position they are in. I think this is a strong start to the record.

---

# Love these girls

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a really nice can opener

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): synthpop perfection

**geliouus** (9): what a nice intro

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Very good opener, and somewhat unique in the fact that it's about the singer herself, not a love interest or somebody else. And it actually talks about being unhappy with how you present yourself to everyone else, instead of being an empowerment anthem. So that's pretty neat.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): Near flawless production and I love the punchiness.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Tegan & Sara open their newest record with a short, gorgeous synthpop track. No complaints here.

**ExtraEater** (7): synth spiral

# THOTs

**Mysario** (8): usually I write a comment as I'm listening to the song or after it's done, but I had to go back to this one after the whole album. I like this song but I think it's a terrible opener to the rest of the album as it doesn't have a good grab to it. And we all know "that girl" is Jess, c'mon!

**bbfan132** (7.4): This kind of reminds me of a song off of Love is Dead by CHVRCHES, with the sparkly synths in the chorus and the second verse. It's kind of vague and very repetitive, which is irritating, but I LOVE the synths that I mentioned before. This is nice, but it doesn't feel so special to me.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): i just want to say i appreciate how every song on the album has a video. that aside, i don't like this song that much.

**CarlieScion** (6): This is a pretty weak opener, especially when the rest of the album is so good

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Chorus isn't great, rest of the song is ok

**kappyko** (5): It's atmospheric and has a build up, but I don't see myself listening to this in the future. It's an intro track.

**therandomsinger13** (5): Pretty simple and repetitive, but good.

I agree with /u/kaylaboe on this one in that “Hang On to the Night” is a subpar way to end this album. I like that Tegan and Sara go for more experimental tracks when closing albums, but [“Shock To Your System”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p4VzGgjXnI4) from 2013’s *Heartthrob* was much more interesting, lyrically and musically. “Hang On to the Night,” however, is a nice closing message considering the context of the album, and I still rather enjoy it.

---
# **amumumyspiritanimal** (10): drunk bop, i will reincarnate to this song

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): This is the best 80s soundtrack pastiche that has ever been written.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): idk what's up with the music video but i love it

**bbfan132** (8.2): This is a pleasant album closer, with another nice message that queer listeners can relate too, but it kind of lacks the power that I enjoy in synthpop tracks. It's still a nice track, though!

**kappyko** (8): :heart:

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Damn dreamy closer

# I don’t know if I can hang on any longer

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is a really pretty song, which shows in the synths present within the chorus. It's just one of the songs I remember the least, which is funny, seeing as it's supposed to be the closing one. It's still a good end to the album, though.

**kaylaboe** (6.5): a kinda subpar end to the album

Probably one of my favorite songs of 2017 and one of the most emotional songs on this album, and yet here it is on Day 2! “If U Love Me Now” perfectly captures the conflict of anxiety and depression within a relationship with echoed vocals over a simple beat and guitar. This is probably the least synthpoppy track in the rate, but it is definitely one of the best. (Also, seeing this performed live fucking hurts.)

---

# Deserving of someone

**dreamingoutloud92** (11): What a raw, vulnerable, powerful track. Really well placed in the album, and really a beautifully produced track.

**Mudkip1** (10): this album is perfect

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The guitar here is SO tender, why am I about to cry?!?!

**therandomsinger13** (8.7): As soon as it started I got chills. Beautiful.

**kappyko** (8): tranquil

# Not sure if I love u now

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): Love the overall vibe but it does kind of drag.

**bbfan132** (7): The lyrics hit me like a ton of bricks, but I wasn't really a fan of the song overall.

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): Bit of a dull ballad compared to Around U, though it's nice to hear a more feminine voice. I have to admit, though, instead of finding the vocals here more pleasant compared to the androgynous, muffled voice of the lead singer, I find them a little boring. I guess it just proves that the former is both a boon and a bane to MUNA's music in terms of being unique.

# There’s me in the corner!

**CarlieScion** (7): i didnt come here to cry

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): https://youtu.be/yO0CBzZopaY

**Raykel** (7): This is the kind of emotional boring I like

I think this is the song they wrote where they were like, “Well, maybe…we could get this on the radio.” But honestly, I feel this song is pretty generic compared to the rest of the album. Next.

# Wig

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): wig? gone

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): suing everyone who gives this less than a 9

# /u/MirandaCrocsgrove’s Sue List

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Not as good as the previous song, or some of the other songs on this record, for that matter, but it's serviceable enough as a follow-up to the opener. My main problem with it is that the vocals in the chorus aren't as good as the ones in the verses.
**bbfan132** (7.8): I like how clean the production sounds, but I feel like this song could've been better. The lyrics are a bit too vague and very repetitive, once again. It's still super catchy and I really enjoy the verses.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A bit forgettable, but still a bop

**therandomsinger13** (7): Interesting lyrics

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): kinda cheese

**ExtraEater** (6): damn good inflections on 'love'

This is absolutely my favorite song on this album because of its lyrical significance. Tegan and Sara recognize that marriage equality is becoming more commonplace and they decide to celebrate it by *not choosing it* in “BWU.” This is a song that makes me love being queer and makes me realize the progress we have made (in some places). With marriage equality, we have the *choice* to not get married now. We have the *choice* to say, “I don’t need to prove my love for you with all of this. We can do it, but I don’t need it.” This song makes me weep, and although I’m not surprised it ended up on Day 2, I’m happy it was mostly well-received.

P.S. The title is “Be With You” shortened to “BWU.” ;)

---
# **MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i had to google what this title was wtf Sara

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): After a mild disappointment, we get my only other 10 on the album, which, on this record full of glossy synthpop songs, stands out as having one of the slickest choruses as well as a pretty bold statement, lyrically speaking. I won't lie-the chorus actually reminds me of some other song, but I suppose this is a better version of whatever that song was anyway.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Best song on the album

**amumumyspiritanimal** (8): wigless

**rotating3Dtext** (8): who wants a white wedding

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): kinda filler but still really good!

**CarlieScion** (7): oh here they are

# **ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): All I can think of is replacing the “we don’t need a white wedding” line with the Red Wedding

**bbfan132** (6.6): Once again, the lyrics display an interesting message that is influenced by being queer, but the delivery is bland. This could be much stronger if they put more effort into it, but alas :(.

**ExtraEater** (6.5): a promising idea without fuel

**kappyko** (5): B^U is this loss

**Raykel** (4.5): I've come to the conclusion that I don't really like their pop stuff

**From /u/TragicKingdom1:** Blind devotion indeed. Y&Y turn up the religious imagery up to the max on this one, and all of the delusions that accompany it. Olly really expresses how much he's obsessed with his lover, and how much of a problem that is. The chorus is anthemic and addictive, and Olly's runs in the back of the mix really elevate the listening experience.

---

# High praises

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Rihanna is shaking

**kaylaboe** (10): :worship:

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): i love this song but the music video is... WHAT

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Probably my favorite Y&Y song, the first track I heard from them and imo still their best

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Despite the criticisms levied at this album regarding it being too generic, Pitchfork's review of it makes a point in the fact that it exhibits the sounds of 2014 and 2015 quite well, rather than just creating half-assed versions of songs we've heard before. So even if Worship does vaguely sound like something you've listened to in the car with your white, Evangelical cousins, it keeps the album interesting, and it's fitting on a record called Communion.

# #Concepts

**therandomsinger13** (8): Interesting concept

**bbfan132** (7.4): I feel like the theme of "worshipping" your lover could've been made into a better song, but this is still good. Not a fan of that weird video game-esque sound in the background, though.

# But you gave it a 7?

**kappyko** (7): I was nervous for a bit, Olly! Awesome vocal chopping, funky basslines, and a truly soulful performance unify to create something that succeeds in pretty much all aspects of the song. Outro's awesome.

*There’s a few bad things I’ve done.* I was wigless when I saw that this track would be opening the album. That one line immediately sets the tone for the honest and heartbreaking songs that would come to follow it, confessing in the first few seconds of the record that what we will hear are confessions, lies, loves, and everything in between. “So Special” is an excellent way to let listeners know that this won’t be an easy ride, but it will be one we can all relate to.

---

# **kappyko** (10): Best intro in the rate that is titled so special

**bbfan132** (10): This is a... trip. I feel like I'm riding in a fast roofless car on the highway with my back against the wind and my arms up in the air while listening to this.

**CarlieScion** (10): oh my god i just realized how little vocals were served on the last 3 albums

**Mudkip1** (10): god i love this kind of music so much. her vocals can be a little too raspy for me at times but she capitalizes on it in this song and it shines

**Mysario** (9): the way it kicks right into the song is pretty special to me

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Setting the dark tone of the album better than Years and Years did with their own opening song, So Special is a pretty good introduction to MUNA's discography as a whole. It's not without flaws-some people may be skeptical of the vocals, or the relatively muffled production-but it's a perfectly decent song with great, melancholy hooks. It's a fitting song to start the record.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): good start

**therandomsinger13** (8): Love the vibe. The vocals sound great and the production is good. This is my type of music. Only thing that could be is the repetitiveness.

# Maybe not so special after all

**Raykel** (7): Ah I'm in my feelings today this kinda hurt :/

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Solid intro

**From /u/cloudbustingmp3:** The opening to this song is like, unexpectedly sensual for this album, and I’m glad the rest has that same vibe. It’s also kinda like, deceptively confident? Anyway I’m gonna keep this comment short because I keep writing assays but also fyi this song is also A+ as background makeout music

---

# **dreamingoutloud92** (8): The synths in this song are FILTHY

**specfagular** (10): i can’t deal with the perfection kween shura graces us with on this album

**cyborglilith** (9.3): love the production but what is that sound at the end

**geliouus** (9.2): I love the infectious bass of it

**bbfan132** (8.7): Apparently Shura was trying to give off a high school vibe with this album, and if what I heard was right, she executed that flawlessly. This track sounds like a part of a teenager's life soundtrack.
**Mysario** (8): Take me to your best friend's house

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The second side of the album draws more on Shura's dance influences, which shows on the last three tracks with 'normal' lengths. It kicks off with Tongue Tied, and while it isn't as terribly original or innovative as some people might hope, it still manages to be a cute, lesbian bop.

# Also not very special I guess

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A really solid track, but isn’t as unique as some of the other ones on the album. Still sooooooo catchy though.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7.5): good song but kind of a drag after 2 minutes

**kappyko** (7.5): This is the first song i return to, and it's not too good.

**therandomsinger13** (5.7): Bridge is all right. I like the ending

**From /u/cloudbustingmp3:** Shura tweeted that this was written about the ride home after the breakup in Kidz N Stuff, and it makes this heartbreaking tbh, especially when the “still got time to change your mind” part comes in because it gives it more of an emotional context.

**From /u/ThatParanoidPenguin:** A godly single in an album of singles that are nearly flawless. Probably my single favorite chorus on the album, this song is a total JAM and completely goes off live, as does most of this album. It’s repetitive but doesn’t get old, and I just love the lyrics. “One girl on the last train, small change in the universe.”

---

# Makin’ it up

**kappyko** (10): Groovy!

**specfagular** (10): i may be crying in the club but my skin is clear and my debt is paid. thank u shura

**bbfan132** (8.3): This song actually sounds like you're on a train/subway after being dumped by someone.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): We're followed up by another very dance-esque track; it's admittedly a little sandwiched in the middle of the album, and it's not too different from Tongue Tied, which is a bit more superior. Still, it's a great song and it's not one you should choose to skip.

**Raykel** (8): Who doesn't love a pop song with a great bass line

# Still got time to change your mind!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): the album is kinda getting boring at this point

**therandomsinger13** (5.5): Fun, but it’s repetitive.

This was the first MUNA song I ever heard and I actually have a very personal connection to it, so it’s hard to write this assay. All I can say is that college is weird and going home is weird and falling in love in the winter is weird, but it’s beautiful. And I’m usually waiting for something to happen and I’m usually the one making more happen than there should be happening, but that’s okay. Let’s all just have a good cry over this one.

---

# Too busy crying to think of anything clever for this

**kaylaboe** (11): this was the first MUNA song i ever heard and i instantly fell in love with it. the lyrics are touching, the production and vocals just complement them perfectly. it’s a moody vibe and i adore it.

**dreamingoutloud92** (10): The production on this track is outstanding.

**Mudkip1** (10): this was the song that introduced me to MUNA and it's just perfect ugh,,, her mind

**specfagular** (10): wow.. this is… beautiful???

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the atmosphere :despair:

**bbfan132** (8.6): I'm getting Lauv vibes from this song, and I'm not mad about it. This song is different in that these lyrics are weirdly specific, but in a beautiful way.

**kappyko** (8): Melancholic and wonderful usage of vocoders :(

**therandomsinger13** (8): Loved it from the intro. I really like vocoder.

# What’s it like to not feel?

**CarlieScion** (7): kinda looooong

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): This is a bit of a forgettable track, which I'm a little wary about, considering it's only the fourth one, but when I listen to it it's not so bad. Simulating a relationship even if you don't have high hopes for it is an interesting topic, and while the verses are a bit muddled this is still a pleasant enough song to build further upon the album's framework.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Why does this title sound like a flavor of gum

**Raykel** (4.5): This was really boring and not in the emotional kind

**amumumyspiritanimal** (4): imogen heap but worse

This song is a CLOSE second to how I feel about “BWU.” This song really messed me up the first time I heard it, and I’m sad to see it here on Day 2! It might be kind of generic, but I think it has some of the best lyrics on the album and it is such a mood.

---

# Dying to listen again

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): its really T H A T bop

**kappyko** (10): FUCKING YES. These synths are very bitpop, reminds me of a Passion Pit song from the Manners era. By the way, Passion Pit coulda shoulda replaced Years and Years!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): dyinf to know when the next album is coming, queens

**CarlieScion** (9): god too relatable

**rotating3Dtext** (8.2): electronic bop

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is a huge bop, make no mistake about it. My only complaint about it is that the vocals during the chorus can get a little too abrasive for me, which is why I lowered the score. I do think it's the easiest song on this album to dance to, though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Dying to know why this song slaps so hard

# Just dying

**bbfan132** (6.8): It's fun, mindless pop, but I wish it was more. The melody in the chorus and Greg Kurstin's production make this a decent song, but the lyrics are pretty dull to me :/

**Raykel** (6): I've listened to this 3 times in a row and I just can't tell if I like this or not. Every time I hit replay I don't remember it. This is a nothing song but it's not offensively bad, it's just eh.

Undoubtedly the most synthpoppy song on MUNA’s album, “End of Desire” is a nice reprieve from the dark moods of the rest of the album. The lyrics are pretty stark, but they’re still weirdly uplifting, and I love the image of God getting high outside at this party/club/event the girls are at. A truly divine song.

---

# God is here tonight

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): for some reason, I feel like some of these songs blend together that they just kinda drag, but they’re still actually amazing wtf how is that even possible

**Mudkip1** (10): can this album stop being so perfect

**bbfan132** (9.5): This is a beautiful, pulsating synthpop song that portrays love as something that you can feel but never quite achieve or reach.

**specfagular** (9): what a m e l l o w b o p

**therandomsinger13** (8.2): The vocal effects on this album are fantastic! This is a great one. Very danceable.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): A bit of a midtempo song, combining some of the slow burn-ish appeals of parts of this album and the pretty decent chorus parts on some of the others. It's a good enough follow-up to Crying on the Bathroom Floor, and I'd put it on the upper half of the record.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Kinda a hidden bop

# Oops, sorry, not God, just Camila

**kaylaboe** (7): i don’t want DESIIIIREEEEE

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6): Dancing On My Own's wig is relaxed safely on it's head

One of my absolute favorite songs on this album and the first song in our rate to hit above an 8 average. It reminds me of sooo many things, but especially the nostalgia of home and of times past. I think this song accomplishes the idea of being enveloped in feeling and evoking a specific instance that is somehow relatable to anyone.

---

# **kappyko** (10): I almost left "fuck men" under this song and then i realized uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh LMFAO

**Mudkip1** (10): another perfect song godddddddddddd i can feel it in the atmosphere

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): A seriously gorgeous track

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Oh, wow, it's a ballad. Perfect place to put one in, too, especially since, bless MUNA's hearts, this is an actually good one. Subtle ballads are great if they're executed properly, and the best way I can describe how this song sounds is like it's a fading warmth. It's a bit cozy and a bit sad, all at the same time. Also, I like how the song is titled Around U instead of About U, LOL.

**bbfan132** (8): The lyrics are great, but Katie's accent kind of turns me off in this song. The production is great as well, especially the sparkling synths toward the end.

**therandomsinger13** (7.5): The vocal samples at the beginning are great. Good song.

# Around U (Radio Mix)

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): ugh there are parts of this I really like but it really should be like 2 minutes shorter.

# Damn, sis, did you like any of it?!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (6): they really don't like writing out 'you' I guess. At least this song is bearable to some extent.

**From /u/TragicKingdom1:** In a lot of ways this song feels like a continuation and worse version of King. It's still very very good, though. I think the key difference here is that Olly sounds a lot more powerful despite still being trapped in his feeling for his partner. The primal yells throughout the song sound consistently great, but I really wish the production and melody were a bit stronger to match. Also it's worth noting that there are two major remixes for this song, one with Gryffin and the other with Tove Lo. I think the original is better than both personally, neither new feature really fits the vibe of the song. (too bad the original is the least popular version :sadgery:)

---

# We love the singles!

**kaylaboe** (10): i want DESIIIIREEEEE

**bbfan132** (9.2): I love the synthpop-meets-UK-garage production on this track, and everything else seems to fit really well together. It's not a perfect song by any means, but it's probably my favorite song by far on this album.

**dreamingoutloud92** (9): This is a really cool one-two punch after King.

# **CarlieScion** (4): is this just king again

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Zara store soundtrack core

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): Wow, two songs in this rate with desire in the title and in the chorus, and none of them have the word rhyme with fire! It's a pop miracle! Okay, this is a pretty boring dance pop song, and what makes it more unfortunate is that it comes after King. I don't like the vocals here, either.

**kappyko** (4): You know I could actually like this if it didn't get bashed into my head for the entirety of Rdio's existence in advertisements. This was so fucking annoying during my time on Rdio and it's also why i can't hear the words Hiatus Kaiyote without dying

**Leixander** (4): His voice is really annoying here. This would fit a female vocalist more I guess.

# *Buy Lady Wood and BLUE LIPS on iTunes now!*

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): Although the Tove Lo version took a bit away from the song, the OG version is really a highlight of their overall discography.

**jamesfog** (10): Tove Lo version is better x

**rotating3Dtext** (10): a banger with or without tove lo

**cyborglilith** (9): tove lo was betrayed

**awryj** (8.8): "euuuhhh euuuhhh euuuhhh" ~Tove Lo

**From /u/ThatParanoidPenguin:** This is the pinnacle of bedroom pop, the get-you-all-in-your-feelings, tissue-expending sad pop that is meant for imagining what it’s like to hold someone that you can’t. The way she sings about unrequited love is just so real, and the way this song fits in the tracklist despite being recorded so many years earlier is remarkable. It’s easily one of the best songs in the rate, and an 11 contender.

---

# There’s a love between us still but nothing’s changed tbh because this song is great and everyone kinda agrees!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this was already like 2 years old when the album came out, and even 2 years after that it still sounds fresh as hell. The production throughout is just the definition of dreamy, and the subtle changes throughout keep it from drifting into aimlessness. Lyrically, it’s so bittersweet and it was super relatable to this kinda sorta thing I had going earlier that year, so it’s always hit a personal spot.

**Mudkip1** (10): there's a remix of this by Grades that's so fucking good i used to listen to it all the time

**specfagular** (10): REPEAT AFTER ME: THERE’S A LOVE BETWEEN US STILL BUT SOMETHING’S CHANGED AND I DON’T KNOW WHAAAAAAAAAT

**cyborglilith** (9.9): love the breathing sounds

**bbfan132** (9.5): The mellow production, the lyrics (which I'm sure any person who has been in a relationship can relate with), her sort-of-hushed vocals.... I think I'm falling in love.

**kappyko** (9): Builds up beautifully, nice alternative R&B tune.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): After the dynamic qualities of the past two songs, a ballad isn't what most listeners expect to hear next on Nothing's Real, and I have to admit that this was too subdued for me the first time I gave this album a shot. I've since changed my mind, though-it's a great, emotional song that I'd love to hear in a cafe.

**CarlieScion** (8): a chill bop

**rotating3Dtext** (8): a mood

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): p catchy for a song so minimalistic

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): Little Mix outpeaked but still good
