# Tegan and Sara – Love You to Death (2016)

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0zqoBumDciJGNoOsvfTP5U)

[Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/love-you-to-death/1097169273)

[YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLVZmJFtHwdaaSpPB6HKPA9kgYD_DzQUfh)

Although this is far and away from being Tegan and Sara’s debut album, it is, in a way, the album that debuted their new synthpop direction. After the underground success of 2013’s *Heartthrob*, the duo decided to power through with a new and reenergized sound, ditching the guitars completely for flashier electropop. “Boyfriend” was released as the first single in early April 2016 to critical praise for its fun lyrics and new sound, while “U-Turn” was released the same day as a promotional single. The album was then released in June 2016.

Produced by Greg Kurstin, *Love You to Death* shines in its sleek synthpop sound, but its real strength is its honest and queer-centered lyricism. Tegan and Sara explore the consequences of not only romantic relationships but also the relationship they share as sisters. Songs like “White Knuckles” and “100x” were confirmed by the sisters to have been written about one another; “BWU” is a statement in itself, shirking the idea of getting married as queer women just as same-sex marriage was becoming legal internationally. *Love You to Death* delves into the personal while still maintaining the sharp wit the sisters became famous for, showing that pop can still glitter in its darkest nights.

1.	That Girl
2.	Faint of Heart

5.	Stop Desire

# Years & Years – Communion (2015)

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/50jDQcZjE2kdx5rn3AL0c8)

[Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/communion-deluxe/976241375)

[YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLe30UiAEzig6OOVYRIjKaZc0YcBbtS9GW)

Coming off their win for BBC’s Sound of 2015, Years & Years created their debut album *Communion*, a stellar fusion of ambient pop atmospheres, 80s and 90s synths, and hard-hitting dancepop beats. With a few singles already out, the group released “King” as the lead single in early February 2015 before releasing “Shine” just a few days before the album’s release in early July 2015. The band is now preparing for the release of their second album, *Palo Santo*, due out in July 2018. The first single from *Palo Santo*, [“Sanctify”]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=37lXjnflt9M), was released in early March 2018.

Although the band may not completely identify as queer, they still rally behind their charismatically queer lead singer, Olly Alexander, writing together to blend their personal experiences. *Communion*’s lyrics may follow the well-trodden roads of love, lust, and loss, but the group’s writing manages to turn cliché’s on their heads, keeping a perspective that is gender neutral and accessible for listeners of any sexual orientation. Songs like “Real” and “Worship” find Olly yearning to be what his romantic interest wants him to be, while “Gold” and “Eyes Shut” explore the in’s and out’s of self-love and the importance of protecting oneself from pain. What *Communion* creates in sound, it matches in message, allowing for an inclusive experience for all listeners.

1.	Foundation
2.	Real
3.	Shine
4.	Take Shelter
5.	Worship
6.	Eyes Shut
7.	Ties
8.	King
9.	Desire (not the version with flop Tove Lo)
10.	Gold
11.	Without
12.	Border
13.	Memo


# Shura – Nothing’s Real (2016)


[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2igeHhP9UZ7ko10H1K0DbP)

[Apple Music]( https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/nothings-real/1092698489)

[YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRGwump0eyytiRKNdI2FovlcuFLnpbHL9)


Alexandra Denton, better known as Shura, began writing music with two bandmates at University College London before branching off and taking creative control over her songwriting. Having taught herself how to use music production software, she released her first single “Touch” in early 2014, soon followed by the singles “Just Once” and “Indecision.” In December 2014, it was revealed that Shura was nominated (alongside eventual winner Years & Years) for the BBC Sound of 2015 poll. Her EP *White Light* was released in the United States in July 2015 featuring the single “2Shy.” Her debut album, *Nothing’s Real*, was then released in July 2016.

Having an undeniably 80s-inspired sound and an experimental ear, Shura’s album is an ode to queer love and a discussion on mental illness covering a vast sonic landscape. “What’s It Gonna Be?” and its queer-positive video were a massive success, especially for the video's concept of subverting high school clichés; “Indecision” grapples with an unreciprocated relationship (later revealed to be about Shura’s decision on signing to a label); and “Kidz ‘n’ Stuff” throws the queer relationship onto a heteronormative expectation, having her listeners consider typically “straight” options for queer couples. But Shura’s conversation about mental illness happening here is truly admirable for its honesty – the title track details the everyday battle of verifying mental illness while “311215,” a hidden track, covers Shura’s fear of death. Although Shura has yet to give signal of new music, *Nothing’s Real* is a timeless and important listen within the queer synthpop canon.

1.	Nothing’s Real
2.	What’s It Gonna Be?
3.	Touch
4.	Kidz ‘n’ Stuff
5.	Indecision
6.	What Happened to Us?
7.	Tongue Tied
8.	Make It Up
9.	2Shy
10.	White Light
11.	311215 (See note at end of tracklist)
12.	The Space Tapes

*"311215" is a hidden track at the end of "White Light." "White Light" ends at ~7:18 and then ~30 seconds later, "311215" begins. "311215" as a standalone single should be on streaming playlists.*


# MUNA – About U (2017)

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/0mfj2MrZptbPw7K5Wo4ikY)

[Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/ca/album/about-u/1171832662)

[YouTube]( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CgbxDu_mDs8&list=PLdeO5dCa4FOELUq5kOOK2Zct5vIMKh8DK)


The members of MUNA, the self-described “dark pop” band, met at a party at the University of Southern California in 2013 where they discovered their musical chemistry. After garnering much attention for their 2016 EP *The Loudspeaker EP*, a collection of songs that included the underground hit “Winterbreak,” their debut album was widely anticipated. Just a few months before their debut album’s release, they made their network television debut on *The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon* and, following the album’s release, they opened for Harry Styles on his first solo tour. *About U* was released in February 2017 to critical success, and the outtake "In My Way" was released later in the year as a gift to fans.

Blending heavy synth, ambient guitars, and brutally honest lyricism, MUNA takes a very personal and political approach to their form of synthpop. The women of MUNA have asserted themselves as queer advocates in a world where they could easily be pigeonholed, exemplifying what it means to be outspoken queer artists by avoiding gendered pronouns from their lyrics and speaking out on issues that motivate them. MUNA is a band for Tr-mp’s America, an unabashed and fiery signal for the new age of protest ("Crying on the Bathroom Floor" was confirmed by the band to be a reaction to Tr-mp's election). In their performance on *Jimmy Kimmel Live*, they made their mission clear, adding additional lyrics to the bridge of their queer anthem "I Know A Place": “Even if our skin or our gods look different/I believe all human life is significant/I throw my arms open wide in resistance/He’s not my leader even if he’s my president.” *About U* excels in its nuance, embracing the personal and the political of the queer experience, creating an identifiable experience for any listener.


1.	So Special
2.	Loudspeaker
3.	I Know A Place
4.	Winterbreak
5.	Around U
6.	After
7.	Promise
8.	If U Love Me Now

# Rules

-	I'm pretty sure it’s a tradition to just steal this from other rate posts, so here’s the rate rules that all you vets are used to and all you newbies should be ready to learn!


-	Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine (please make sure they are decimal, not comma), but please don't give scores that have two or more decimal spots: giving a 6.2 is okay, but a 6.21 isn't. Please do not give scores less than one (.1-.9) or above 10 (10.1-10.9). 0 and 11 are exceptions to this, of course, as discussed below. /u/letsallpoo has created this program, this is the way it is. If you don't put a score in, you break the program, and you ruin everything for everyone. [Words to think about.]( https://media.giphy.com/media/MiodhdNWkpiA8/giphy.gif)


-	Feel free to talk about/gossip about your scores! You never know, someone may have a different perspective than you and may change your mind about a song. Get as much out of the music as possible.


-	You may give **ONE song a 0** and **ONE song an 11** in the **ENTIRE RATE**. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results. It's not required to use these! Please don't give out 0's and 11's just because! (Especially because there are literally no 0's in this rate...)

-	Speaking of sabotage, I’m not super worried that it will happen in this rate considering these albums are still a little unknown and aren't [super flops](http://static.webshopapp.com/shops/134936/files/079332983/350x350x2/britney-spears-glory-deluxe-edition-cd.jpg). However, if I think your scores look suspicious, I reserve the right to message you about them. Try to keep your scores fair – all of these albums are excellent.

-	You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again after submitting your scores. 

-	**Note: I’m graduating from college this month and looking for a new place to live, so I’ll confirm score changes, answer questions, and do other things as I have time. Please keep this in mind and be patient with me during this busy time of my life! K, thanks!!!**


-	To make things a lot more efficient and to reduce errors on my part, scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post, such as [right here]( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=whatareblackhole&subject=Queer%20Synthpop%20Rate&message=Username%3A%20%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Love%20You%20to%20Death%0A%0AThat%20Girl%3A%0A%0AFaint%20of%20Heart%3A%0A%0ABoyfriend%3A%0A%0ADying%20to%20Know%3A%0A%0AStop%20Desire%3A%0A%0AWhite%20Knuckles%3A%0A%0A100x%3A%0A%0ABWU%3A%0A%0AU-turn%3A%0A%0AHang%20on%20to%20the%20Night%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Communion%0A%0AFoundation%3A%0A%0AReal%3A%0A%0AShine%3A%0A%0ATake%20Shelter%3A%0A%0AWorship%3A%0A%0AEyes%20Shut%3A%0A%0ATies%3A%0A%0AKing%3A%0A%0ADesire%3A%0A%0AGold%3A%0A%0AWithout%3A%0A%0ABorder%3A%0A%0AMemo%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Nothing%27s%20Real%0A%0ANothing%27s%20Real%3A%0A%0AWhat%27s%20It%20Gonna%20Be%3F%3A%0A%0ATouch%3A%0A%0AKidz%20%27n%27%20Stuff%3A%0A%0AIndecision%3A%0A%0AWhat%20Happened%20to%20Us%3F%3A%0A%0ATongue%20Tied%3A%0A%0AMake%20It%20Up%3A%0A%0A2Shy%3A%0A%0AWhite%20Light%3A%0A%0A311215%3A%0A%0AThe%20Space%20Tapes%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20About%20U%0A%0ASo%20Special%3A%0A%0ALoudspeaker%3A%0A%0AI%20Know%20A%20Place%3A%0A%0AWinterbreak%3A%0A%0AAround%20U%3A%0A%0AAfter%3A%0A%0APromise%3A%0A%0AIf%20U%20Love%20Me%20Now%3A%0A%0ACrying%20on%20the%20Bathroom%20Floor%3A%0A%0AEnd%20of%20Desire%3A%0A%0AEverything%3A%0A%0AOutro%3A%0A%0AIn%20My%20Way%3A%0A%0AEND). PLEASE USE THAT. You can copy and paste it to a notepad or Word or OpenOffice file or Google Docs or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE use that format to send in your scores.


-	If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly [shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions]( https://media.giphy.com/media/HiBNkOKRhBJew/giphy.gif).

-	If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!


-	If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!


-	I can't believe I even have to say this, but don't change the submission ballot - it just messes everything up. [As Mother Ru says…](https://media.giphy.com/media/KEQzTcbdIvyaA/giphy.gif)
