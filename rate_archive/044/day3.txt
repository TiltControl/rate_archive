If you haven’t heard the transition from Kidz ‘n’ Stuff into Indecision, what are you doing? This song is a MAJOR bop and, as /u/cyborglilith says, it’s “severely underrated.”

---

# **cyborglilith** (11): severely underrated

**Raaaaat** (11): This was the first song i heard from her that really moved my wig, so I felt it necessary to give her the 11 she deserves

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is like Control-era Janet had a baby with the good songs on Like a Virgin and Cyndi Lauper was the godmother. It’s bouncy and effervescent, and the fact that it’s about her trying to decide on a record label after Touch blew up is kinda wild lmao.

**geliouus** (10): THAT FUCKING TRANSITION I STILL CAN'T BELIEVE IT

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I’m puzzled. Is this a love song or is thia about her struggles finding a label to sign her disguised as one?? bc I won’t be convinced which is which either way

**specfagular** (10): i have made the decision to give this song a 10 bc its a skinny masterpiece

**amumumyspiritanimal** (9): relatable

**kappyko** (9): i thought i liked this song but now i'm not so sure. i'll have to choose if i like it or not later UPDATE I DO LOL

**Mysario** (9): I'm a sucker for pessimistic lyrics with an optimistic beat

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): One of the better album tracks here, the instrumental is just so dancey and I love it, just love it so.

**bbfan132** (8.6): Another great dream/synth-pop track. I really like how the song is about her struggle with picking a record label to sign onto, but it could be seen as a love song as well.

**therandomsinger13** (7): Love the smooth transition from the last track. Production is good. A bop!

# People be sexually fluid!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): We're back to bops suited for clubs with Indecision, though the production is a little too soft to fully enjoy dancing to; perhaps a remix is in order. While I do love this song, I have to wonder why Shura directs it to a boy; as far as I know, she's not bisexual, so this bothers be a little.

**From /u/patronsaintofaspies:** Alright, this sounds a little like a RnB track you hear at the end of a girl group album released in the mid 90s, but Shura mixing that with dance music, her wonderful voice, and queer vibes makes it all the more praiseworthy. I'm going to say it; this reminds me of some early Mariah songs, except a little more subdued!

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): gorgeous, dreamy, and very relatable

**cyborglilith** (10): suddenly im transported to an underwater paradise

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): https://i.imgur.com/c95Yhq1.png

**bbfan132** (9): The theme of being "too shy" fits perfectly with the quiet/"shy" production and vocals. I love the atmospheric synths throughout the song.

**kappyko** (9): wigggy

**rotating3Dtext** (8): me

# :pensive:

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7): i mean the song is fine but its nothing outstanding

**CarlieScion** (6): 😔

**therandomsinger13** (5.6): The chorus is kind of interesting, but I wasn’t too excited by this song. It’s not bad and the production is good. Shura is good at bridges.

**From /u/TragicKingdom1:** I am not someone who has personally experienced a bright, happy, youthful relationship (or any relationship at all lol) but this song makes me feel like I have. Olly compares his relationship to literal earth-shattering events, but recognizes the light they produce aka their beauty. This should be a really cliche sentiment but I think there's a subtle connotation of desperation on Olly's part that makes it work. Musically, I think the instrumental choices are fittingly cosmic and radiant, and they truly elevate the song to a 10. Also on a random note I really love how Olly delivers a line in the 2nd verse like "now thatchukin hear that sound" lol. This is in my top 10 most played songs on last.fm, and it's well-deserved!

# wholesomeheads

**rotating3Dtext** (11): so wholesome!!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): This song is so amazing, it's not only the perfect gay club bop but also an amazing song for those kind of nights

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): That middle 8 is gorgeous!

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is so wholesome, I love it ❣️

**Mysario** (10): while this song was shaking the sky, it shook me too! Honestly probably one of my favourite songs I've had to listen to in this rate and was almost my 11

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): The third song is one of the best places to place an immediate standout on, and this definitely gets you excited for the rest of the album; piggybacking off the success that was Real, Shine manages to grip you with its triumphant, energetic chorus. Honestly, this deserves to be their signature song over King.

**bbfan132** (9): I LOVE the imagery in the lyrics. You can definitely sense the passion and the layered meaning of the song. The production is nice and... groovy/atmospheric during the verses, and in the chorus, it sort of bursts into a powerful synthpop sound that is really enjoyable. I prefer Danny L Harle's AMAZING remix, but this is still great.

**kaylaboe** (8.5): a cute banger

**cyborglilith** (7.5): cool production

**CarlieScion** (7): bop

**kappyko** (7): Chorus and post-chorus would be a 9 if it weren't for the verses. The bridge take a point off but don't take a 7 too harshly, I actually like this a little bit!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Really danceable but also really forgettable at the same time

**therandomsinger13** (7): Groovy! I enjoy the bridge.

# Well, let’s hear YOU sing it!

**Mudkip1** (9): his voice is a little annoying but the song bops

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Is it just me, or does the vocalist sound like The Weeknd?

**Raykel** (6.8): I like the production but I just don't think the lead singer's voice really fits. It's such a positive and hype instrumental and his voice just doesn't keep up with that energy.

**specfagular** (5.5): idk i’m just really not impressed with what i’m hearing from this album

# Slutbopheads, thank you for catapulting this so far! Here’s a great comment on how good this song is:

**From /u/Mysario:** I was debating on giving this an 11, but if you ignore the outro named... well, "Outro", it's a great closer that incorporates every aspect of the album in it. The guitars that have been chugging along throughout this whole album start the song off as they're complimented with some cynical and dark lyrics that have plagued this album for better or worse, the drum and synth that have been prevalent to keeping a somewhat upbeat tune come in carefully enough to not interrupt the tone, the harmonies and the burst of vocals come through near the end to a beautiful crescendo - the build-up in this song is so well-done and I can't stress it enough. I don't expect it to hit the top here, but I'd feel wrong if I didn't support this song.

---

# **CarlieScion** (10): :gaycat2:

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): The middle 8 has some of the best vocals of the entire album. This might've been my 11, if some of the lyrics weren't a little... iffy.

**Mudkip1** (10): this album is still perfect

**specfagular** (10): cut to me ugly crying drinking a glass of wine

**bbfan132** (9.3): Another wonderful ballad of sorts about constantly thinking about their ex-lover and feeling their presence in everything and at every place. I don't know why, but this kind of sounds like something that Kelly Clarkson would've recorded earlier in her career, and I love that.

**kappyko** (9): It's aight

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): OMG this is a late album treasure, the vocals here are haunting.

**TragicKingdom1** (9): Love the slow build to the climax!

**kaylaboe** (8.5): these lyrics are touching

**therandomsinger13** (8.4): A nice concept. Descriptive songs are my favorite kind. I enjoy the eruption of the bridge and the ending. There’s a lot of emotion present.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): I really, really, really love it when she flips through her higher register. I wish she took advantage of it more.

# For being a song called “Everything,” it’s actually “Nothing!”

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): Eh, from what I remember about this one-and that's surprisingly little-I'm not a huge fan. It's a slow song in the vein of Around U, but this sounds like a mid 00s pop rock ballad in a bad way, if I'm being honest. It sounded too cliche, as if I've heard it on radio a million times before. Huge meh.

Probably my least favorite MUNA song, but it still manages to go *off*. This is also a super important message for any queer person to blast their pride through a loudspeaker and to not hide their voice. Go off, queer babies!

---

# *microphone to loudspeaker*

**dreamingoutloud92** (10): Holy shit the bridge in this song is awesome.

**kappyko** (10): Best loudspeaker related song in the rate

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I love her higher register

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): God, I love this track. Sounds exactly like a moody, dark version of T&S’s Closer and I love it so much.

**Mysario** (9.5): mmmm that guitar work

**bbfan132** (9): I adore the message, and as someone who has been manipulated by men on the Internet as an underage teen, I can relate to this song in a way. I also love Katie's voice; it's full of pure, raw emotion that you can just feel.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): standing up for yourself anthem

**therandomsinger13** (8): I like the beat and the guitar. The vocal effect around the two minute mark is good. I also love the vocals at around 2 minutes and 30 seconds.

# Switch that loudspeaker to “OFF”

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The production here is better compared to So Special, and, in accordance with the title, the song as a whole is overall much less subdued compare to the track before it. However, I feel as if one's ability to enjoy this song is bound by whether or whether not you enjoy the lead singer's voice, and I'll admit this made me...skeptical.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (4): *yawn*

Let me tell you a story. I walked into this rate thinking Winterbreak would be receiving my 11. I was familiar with Shura’s album, but not super familiar. And then I heard this. Kesha’s “Spaceship” has a similar effect on me. Basically, any song about seeking refuge in space is my everything. This song is an emotional journey over its 7-minute playout and I’m so glad I fell in love with it. It’s an absolutely amazing song.

# Different and liking it

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): adorable bop apparently inspired by video games? We love a fun-loving legend! Anyway this is just so sweetly written and highkey a current #mood

**kappyko** (10): ummm? guitar outro? yess

**Mudkip1** (10): if i could give a second 11 it'd be to this song. a b s o l u t e l y obsessed with it. the guitar solo at the end is snatchworthy

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): An ambitious and iconic reference to The Velvet Underground, and also this is a 10 because Shura said this song was directly inspired by Mass Effect and The Last Of Us, so support our video game playing queen.

**bbfan132** (9.5): I love how Shura embraces being unique and different throughout the song. This could be a queer anthem if it was more recognized!

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): We exit the album's 'regular' territory with White Light, which is, while six minutes long and still relatively standard synthpop, one heck of an adventure. It has a great, intriguing melody that manages to lure you in without noting how long it is, and you're reassured by Shura's statement that she and her target are never going home. The listing at ten minutes worries the first-time listener, but those fears are soon quenched...or are they?

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): Really cool instrumental

**Mysario** (9): even for being the longest song on the album where it's easy to lose attention at some point, it grabbed me well and I think it's one of the best the album provides

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): woo synths

**Raykel** (8.5): Yeah it suffers a bit for being too long but every second is deserved imo. At first it's just a regular (and great!) song about running and getting away. Then a high pitched sound goes crazy and eventually turns into a police siren, creating a feeling of being chased. The guitar riff comes on after which makes it sound like you're running away even faster. Then it goes silent and goes into the next track (311215) to reflect back on the past and the people you leave behind. It's a long song, but a short story.

**CarlieScion** (8): bop

**cyborglilith** (8): 5:52 is enough to make me forgive the random 30 seconds of silence

**therandomsinger13** (7): Bop! Something good to nod your head to. The production has a good feel. I like long tracks that lets an instrumental shine. It would be fun to listen to while cleaning and dancing.

# This song is tooooo long…

**specfagular** (8): i really like her but its just SO long. my impatient gay ass starts to get bored after like 5 minutes. this song is GREAT when you’re driving home at night tho js

**amumumyspiritanimal** (3): way too long song, not worth wasting almost 8 minutes at it

# Except, according to awry, it was too fast?

**awryj** (7): what's that song again? it went so fast i can't remember it

**From /u/cloudbustingmp3:** Fleetwood Mac but make it gayer. This one probably was the only song I didn’t immediately love when the album first came out, but god now I’m just glad I’ve seen the light. There’s a desperate urgency in it that explodes in the chorus, and it’s actually really nice to have the guitar and percussion step into the spotlight a bit while the synths play backup. “No, I’m no child, but I don’t feel grown up” is also VEEERY much my current state, so I can’t not love this even if my personal context isn’t quite what hers was when she wrote it.

---

# **MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): I feel like this I a good aerobics song

**Mudkip1** (10): relatable

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This chorus is INSANELY catchy, one of the songs I always have to sing along to. When I saw her live, this was probably one of the more fun tracks, it’s just a bittersweet bop, and the way she delivers the vocals is just so full of life.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Simply flawless. To compare the two question tracks, this deserves more of the attention.

**cyborglilith** (9.1): “I’m no child but I don’t feel grown up”

**kappyko** (8.5): Took a break after this song lol, it's What's It Gonna Be but not as wig-snatching

**bbfan132** (8.4): The dreaminess of the production works perfectly with the lyrics about love and reflecting on past relationships.

**geliouus** (8): It's a nice song tho

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): The energetic, top-of-the-morning production returns with What Happened To Us, though perhaps it isn't as successful as it had been at the start of the album. This is the token rock song on the album, and while the position it fills can be ever so slightly irritating, any misgivings are forgotten when one reaches the part where Shura sings 'I was never ready for your love...'. It may be a bit of a cheap remake, but I'll take it.

**therandomsinger13** (8): Good beat. Love the story. The chorus stands out. I like the hey at about 2 minutes and 30 seconds. “F*ck your love” was sharp and surprising but satisfying. This track is definitely danceable. Another bop.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (7.5): this song is giving me major After Laughter vibes

**CarlieScion** (7): 🤗

# Okay but now I need this

**Raykel** (8.2): Does anybody else get Florence Welch vibes in the chorus? That melody is made for her.

I remember when this was released as a lead single and it snatched me soooo hard. “Boyfriend” is too relatable for all us queer hoes that can tolerate them straights, and it plays very well on the trope of lesbians in platonic female relationships. This is a bop through and through – might as well call it “Bopfriend!”

---
# **CarlieScion** (11): https://media.tenor.com/images/d57232e989c0d3d2c5eab5a56f2fcf41/tenor.gif

**Leixander** (11): closer pt.2 but still great

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): closeted bi bop demi is shaking with her vagina flicking

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): need

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song is the closest thing they’ve made to usurping, it’s a goddamn DANCE track. With some of the same energy and fervor of songs like St. Lucia’s Dancing On Glass or Robyn’s Dancing On My Own, Tegan & Sara’s queer pop anthem is very simply a divine case study of how to make synthpop in the 2010s. A complete banger.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): The best known song from this album gets that distinction for a reason-it's not just a really good song, it also somehow manages to deal with painful ideas like being in a closeted relationship by setting playful lyrics to an upbeat melody. It's a worthy addition to the sapphic music canon.

**kaylaboe** (8.5): production is stellar. i don’t know why but it kinda reminds me of k-pop?

**Mysario** (8.5): if I was yo boyfriend, I'd never let you go :kisskiss:


# **cyborglilith** (9): bop but annoying

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): I think this has less interesting production than most of the rest of the album but the lyrics and hook are great.

**bbfan132** (8.4): I love the queer theme of the song, and the desire can definitely be felt in the verses and chorus. The production fits well, but I feel like it could've been a bit stronger. Also, I wish their vocals weren't so... stiff at times.

**kappyko** (7.5): This would be higher if the verses weren't so nasal lmfao

**therandomsinger13** (7): Nice melody and good storyline. Reminds me of Undercover Lover by Emma Blackery.

Well, apparently you can! With three songs in the rate named “Desire” in some way or another, I thought we would add a song named “Desire” to our Rate Winners Circle. However, not even the infectious dance pop of Tegan and Sara’s middle cut can make its way there. Damn you!

**ExtraEater** (10): best damn urban mall shopping spree of 2016, which is a compliment in every way

**geliouus** (10): waht a boooop

**kappyko** (10): A bop I only discovered recently and inspired me to actually give Tegan and Sara a chance

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): that intro is pop perfection anyone who gives this less than an 8 is deaf don’t /u/me

**dreamingoutloud92** (9.5): I listened to this album on an airplane, legit thought about getting up and dancing with this song. B O P

**bbfan132** (9): YES! This is what I wanted from them. You can hear the sexual desire and tension in the vocal delivery and production, and the lyrics are actually good! This is a queer synthpop GEM.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Definitely the rockiest song we've heard so far. It's also a total banger and one of the strongest earworms on an album already full of catchy tracks. The 'fire' and 'desire' rhymes don't even matter that much to me, and that's saying something!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This song sounds like the climax in a movie and I fucking love it

Slutbopheads strikes again! All jokes aside, I’m surprised to see Crying on the Bathroom Floor this high in the rate! This is an extremely tense song, allegedly written after Tr*mp’s election, that keeps its power all the way through. This song contains my favorite moment on the entire album – that middle eight with the pulsing beats as Katie sings, “I’m asking a lot of myself,” over and over before saying, “It’s taking a lot out of me, loving you.” It’s a painful message probably not directed to a lover, but to the mirror.

---

# This bathroom is crowded

**welcometoNY** (11): this has been one of my favorites songs since I first heard it almost a year ago. a masterpiece!

**bbfan132** (10): I can feel the raw pain and abuse that Katie dealt with in this song. It's beautiful.

**ExtraEater** (10): good title

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): wow i can’t believe MUNA made a song about my favourite hobby

**Mudkip1** (10): ugh this is so perfect

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song is everything, an eternal mood, a perfect reaction to the 2016 election, and also coincidentally what I do on a daily basis

**kappyko** (9.5): Accelerate by Susanne Sundfor did it better but it bangs like no other

**Mysario** (9): I'd make a joke about the title, but the lyrics are so tragic

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is the most urgent-sounding of the songs on the album, which makes sense, since it was reportedly written right after election results came out. The token rocky song for each album in this rate has ranged from decent to good, but this possibly beats Stop Desire, though I'll give it a lower score for the vocals.

**specfagular** (8.5): this title is very me

**therandomsinger13** (8.4): I really like this one. Interesting story. I enjoy the contrast between the verses and the chorus. An intricate bop.

**Leixander** (6.5): yeah yeah fire

# We got some assays on this one

**From /u/cloudbustingmp3:** wow! an absolute BANGER! Bop-itude aside, Nothing’s Real snatches my 11 easily as my #1 song of 2016 and a deeply personal anthem. Shura turned being hospitalized for a panic attack into something beautiful, and it’s just uncomfortably relatable that I can’t help but love it. I’ve always been incredibly anxious since I can remember, and there have always been people telling me to just get over it, so a couplet like “they’re telling me that I’m fine/they’re telling me there’s nothing wrong” feels like a punch to the gut, and “game over/nothing’s real” is like a finishing blow. The feeling of panic is accented in the way the production switches up during the chorus; there’s a bouncy synth line that is largely on beat during the verses, but delays slightly and gets even more beats during the chorus. It’s a small detail, but it kinda reminds me of how my heart can get erratic when I’m having a panic attack and intentional or not it kinda adds to the overall vibe. The blend of disco and synthpop works beautifully, and the disorienting bridge draws it all together.

**From /u/patronsaintofaspies:** This is one of the quirkiest opening track I've ever heard and I *love* it! Shura's voice fits in perfectly with the unique production, which is a fantastic mix of alternative music and songs you'd expect to dance to at a party. It's hard to decide what's on a higher level-her vocal performance or the background music. And, speaking of which, an instrumental version of this would be brilliant!

**From /u/ThatParanoidPenguin:** I’ve been wanting to rate this album for AGES. AGES!!! Gameee oh-ah-oh-ah-oh-VER! God, I waited years for Shura’s debut, and ever since I heard Touch I knew she was gonna be something special. The debut does not disappoint, and from the get-go, this album track and intro is a complete disco bop, a jaw-dropping display of songwriting prowess and stunning moments in production. It’s almost too easy for me to give every song on this album a 10, but I will give every other artist a bit of a chance and be a bit fair in rating.

# **awryj** (11): wig

**kappyko** (10): This is actually the greatest opener of all time! No, but seriously, this just kicks down the gate with a song that has an irresistibly 1980s groove. And those strings! I love love love the lyrics as well. Her delivery is stellar.

**Raykel** (10): She got the tea on panic attacks

**specfagular** (10): one thing is real, this song goes OFF

**Leixander** (9.5): would be funny if Real and Nothing's Real went out back to back in the rate huh

**bbfan132** (9.4): This is a hit. I love the 80s synthpop sound of this song, combined with the highly personal storytelling. It kind of sounds like Kylie Minogue meets Giorgio Moroder meets... I don't even know.

**geliouus** (9): that intro dang

**Mysario** (8.5): great song but I just feel like it goes on slightly too long even though it's only 4 minutes

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): Love the violins and 80s vibes (especially in the intro).

**therandomsinger13** (7): Bop! Definitely made me want to dance.

# I love it…except for maybe *oooone* thing

“U-turn” actually held a Top 3 spot for quite a while before shockingly landing in 4th place on the last day of the submission window! “U-turn” is an effortlessly fun synthpop gem with a quirky phrase and a lot of spirit…even if the video has none of those things.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Best song on the album! Basically a flawless pop song.

**cyborglilith** (9.5): bop

**bbfan132** (9.1): That bridge is heavenly. Their rising voices singing against the dreamy-ish synths in the background is nothing short of synthpop perfection. I like how they are acknowledging that they have been rude and uncaring in the past, and want to make up for it by showing how much they love their partner; that theme works perfectly with the glossy synthpop production of this track.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): my favourite from the album

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Wow, U-turn is my favourite Pokemon move! Okay, okay, jokes aside, I do like how focused on its rhythm this track is. It also has some of the catchiest rhymes on the record, so I really like it, even if it's not as full of substance as some of its fellow tracks.

**TragicKingdom1**: This album is pretty great! The production is slick and the songwriting incredibly strong. Any pop fan will be able to appreciate the melodies and lyrics. My only complaint is that sometimes it doesn't feel like the girls are particularly selling it; I'm not sure if it's their voices but it feels like they're only partially committed to the performance at points. This lessens the emotional impact of certain songs. That being said that's only a minor complaint and the album checks all of my boxes otherwise. [Grade: A-]

**specfagular**: i’m so problematic i LOVED heartthrob but i haven’t listened to this album before this rate. overall i like her a lot. u-turn is a definite standout. i don’t really have much to say about the songs so sorry for the lack of comments lol

**dreamingoutloud92**: What a fun album! Hadn't really listened to a lot of T&S before but I might consider myself a fan now. Maybe only a few tracks I'll regularly revisit, but overall I think it's a solid album!

**kappyko**: Where is Everything Is Awesome!!! This album didn't impress me enough, unfortunately, and a homogeneous production palette of rather watered down synthpop for most of it was a bit draining. However, there are several choice cuts!

**cyborglilith**: Uninteresting production, lyrics, and voice.

**geliouus**: their fantastic 80's departure from Hearthhrob, I feel so lucky even having this experienced live as well

**letsallpoo**: a good, short, filler-free album

**Leixander**: Greg Kurstin with them synth-pop magic + Tegan & Sara = a great album

**CarlieScion**: This album is the gay mom of Expectations by miss Kiyoko

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: this album is so good I am so thankful I decided to listen to Apple Music’s recommendations for a change. Greg Kurstin’s production was so onpoint for these twins, it makes me happy. I think I liked this album more overtime. I’m excited to see who else sits at the top of this album’s average list.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I'm not a huge fan of Tegan and Sara's music in general, so when I gave this album a fair shot, I was pleasantly surprised by how much I ended up enjoying the sounds they utilised here. The entire record is full of neatly produced synthpop songs that range from a quality of decent to outstanding, and it's made me decide to give them a second chance.

**Mysario**: a nice chill album that has the occasional tear jerk and bops to make your legs jerk

**Raaaaat**: wow, i love this idea of shorter albums compacting in alot of emotions into always at 100% bop songs, though at times the songs kinda go into each other at the ending.

**From /u/TragicKingdom1:** I think this is a flawless pop song, and it's honestly one of my favorite songs of all time. First, the obvious: it's massively energetic and danceable. That being said, it has elements of being dark and unnerving; the low ringing riff throughout the track gets stuck in your head, but it's weirdly unnatural (it's actually a heavily processed sample of Olly's voice, so this makes sense.) Secondly, I think that Olly really just sells every aspect of it. The lyrics are about being trapped in a toxic relationship, and to me his vocal performance sounds truly desperate to escape the possession this person has over him. He regains some strength during the bridge, but by the time he gets to the "let go of everything" outro, it sounds like he's been stripped to his deepest layer in his efforts to get out. He may not have the biggest range, but he delivers the dark, emotional intensity required to match the production. Overall, I think this is the song I'd be most upset to see robbed in this rate because it's just so fucking satisfying on each listen.

# Give this King a crown!

**amumumyspiritanimal** (11): Ugh their mind... King is one of my favorite songs of all time. It really gave me a lot of confidence since the first time I've heard it, and inspired me in a lot of ways. The instrumental is perfect, and has amazing summer/spring vibes and just really hypes you up overall. The lyrics are wigline-shaking, and Olly's voice ties it all together into a perfect bouquet.

**CarlieScion** (10): 👑

**rotating3Dtext** (10): a classic

**welcometoNY** (10): a bop! I wish more songs on the album were like it

**specfagular** (9): i’m sad of the lack of boppage overall on this album but this fucking SLAPS

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): The biggest hit from the album-I was surprised to see that it was a #1 on the UK charts! It's well deserved, because it was obviously meant to be the breakout single from this album. The verses and the chorus manage to be equally good, and this is great for both casual listening and for dancing to.

**bbfan132** (8.4): This song is very nostalgic for me. I remember listening to this song without even paying attention to the lyrics and I could sense the sort of first-love desire that this song exhibits in its moody synths and Olly's vocal delivery. The production is excellent, but the song isn't as good as I remembered it being, unfortunately.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Their biggest track for a reason, this song has a bit more identity than most non-album tracks on this record, with a damn catchy chorus

**kappyko** (7.5): Sorry for promising to drag Y&Y but this song is good

# Heavy is the head that wears the crown

**Raykel** (7): This was a bop in the first 15 seconds, but it started to lose me...but just a bit! I think this could've taken a cooler direction with that intro is all.

**Leixander** (4): I have hated this song since I first listened to it, it was the reason I didn't listen to rest of their discog, it is NOT bad objectively but I just don't like it overall. Thankfully, there are way better songs on the album.

**TragicKingdom1**: This album really connects to me because of the amount of emotion that went into it. It sounds incredibly cohesive but covers so many moods: sadness, anger, fear, homosexuality. I experience all of these on a daily basis, so this album feels tailor made for me. The songwriting is there, the hooks are there, the atmosphere is there...an all-around amazing experience, and the best album in the rate. [Grade: A]

**specfagular**: wow i had never heard anything from years & years before so i was really excited but… i didn’t really like this. even though it’s upbeat so much of the album is SO boring to me it hurts. i listened trough it like three different times all the way through and i’m just not into most of the album. without is absolutely beautiful though

**dreamingoutloud92**: This is the only album I was familiar with prior to the rate. What I've always found frustrating is that while a few of the songs on the album are spectacular, a lot of the tracks are just ok. I listen to the stronger songs frequently but forget about the rest. Overall, it's a fine album.

**kappyko**: It makes me MAD that we aren't rating 1977 and I Want to Love because I wouldn't look like such a Y&Y hater !!!! Well, I'm no fan of Olly's voice, and they really are a bit of a singles band. Production palette is very neon bright but there's several synthpop records from this year above it, namely Neon Indian and Tame Impala. Glitzy UK dance pop with very little in common with these other albums, not gonna lie, and it's not my type. Sorry!

**cyborglilith**: They love one-word titles.

**geliouus**: ok I think this album is not really for me, IDK, I kind of find Ollie's voice unappealing and the prodution a bit dull

**letsallpoo**: I love a lot of this album and Y&Y in general, but a lot of this album feels distinctly amateur. Which makes sense, since this was their big debut, but it's a bit hard to listen to at times. Their followup is promising though!

**tf2manu994**: Get away from me with this slow low music.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Look, this album may be full of choruses that sound familiar to everybody who's lived through a few years ago, but the good thing about it is that it's a nice showcase of all the different songs you could expect to hear at a party in 2014, not a boring retread that has no songs worth listening to. Despite the relative typicality of the melodies, it's still full of bops, and it manages to be a decent album for casual listening. I was a little disappointed it wasn't as alternative or experimental as I hoped, but gays need to be in mainstream pop, too.

**Mysario**: the soft yet powerful voice works really well with the sound they have and while I personally don't prefer the slower songs, they are pretty good overall. I didn't leave as many comments as I wanted to on the individual songs since I was too busy enjoying all of them so much!

**Raaaaat**: a neat album but its just not for me sorry, I want more from it but its just not bringing it to the table, though for a debut, its a good start.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: Communion is really THAT album for me, that's why I gave it a perfect score. I can't find a single bad song on the album, and it really helped me through some shitty times. I always place it in my top 10 albums alongside with Troye and Lorde, so obviously I had to give it a perfect score. I didn't spent hours on this quality post

I love Shura and I love this song, but there are so many more deserving songs of hers that should have this spot (as evidenced by half of Shura’s album making it to Day 3). But let’s have /u/cloudbustingmp3 explain why this made its way to #2:

*One of the brightest synthpop gems of the decade, and honestly my favorite single of 2016. It’s just so cute and hopeful and perfectly encapsulates that feeling of when you’re so stupidly infatuated with someone and really hope they feel the same, but are scared shitless at the same time because there’s always the potential that those feelings aren’t mutual. Instead of succumbing to that fear, however, Shura chooses to be optimistic, and the result is vibrant and lively. It’s perfect pop.*

---

# Don’t wanna give this up!

**Mudkip1** (11): this song is so catchy and loveable and gay it makes my heart so happy

**specfagular** (11): this was the first shura song i heard (courtesy of popheads actually) and i’m so glad i heard it and got to experience this amazing artist. i remember hearing the song and watching the mv and immediately wanting to share it with everyone bc it’s just so amazing.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): automatic 10

**bbfan132** (10): Wow... This is the perfect synthpop love song. I don't really know what else to say.

**CarlieScion** (10): yes

**kappyko** (10): Her mind! New wave influence comes to the forefront, and the chorus is so beautifully longing. Love her.

**piccprincess** (10): A contender for my 11! It's such a cute bop and the video is even cuter. Possibly my favorite song atm (sorry Tay)

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): An uptempo and ELECTRIC track that might be the only thing she could’ve picked to lead into Touch. It’s just made for dancing, jumping up and down with someone you’re falling for. The way she just drops “I DON’T WANNA GIVE YA UP!” just gives me chills.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): After Nothing's Real, I was left wondering whether this record was going to be weird, or whether it was going to be full of dance-worthy bops. This falls a little more in the latter category, but being poppy doesn't necessarily mean being unoriginal! This is a vibrant, colourful song complete with fantastic, playful production. I couldn't ask for better. And upon relistening to the album, I can definitely be reassured that the stranger elements of Shura's music are going to eventually sneak back in the album.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): This album sounds like techno ABBA, which is great

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): too real. also the music video is cute... those things don't happen in high school tho

**Raykel** (7.8): The music video is the flip flop gays dream of

# It’s a no from me

**therandomsinger13** (6): I got kinda bored. I realized I’m not 100% into Shura’s voice. What I like about it are the production and the vocal tone in the bridge.

**TragicKingdom1**: I really love this album for being fairly unique within the confines of queer synthpop. While the other albums in this rate are very hook-driven, Shura takes a much more atmospheric route here. If Shura had used more generic 80s-sounding synths that we've heard in dozens of albums over the past few years, then I think that would be more of a drawback, but the instrumentation is unique and perfectly sets the airy yet melancholic mood. My only complaint is that the back half doesn't really change tone at any point; this is exacerbated by ending on a 10-minute long song. Anyways, if you're gay and looking for daytime sadboi hours material, then this will definitely hit the spot, and I think there are songs here for everyone regardless. [Grade: A-]

**specfagular**: this is the best album on this rate and i will not hear any other opinions sorry hun xoxo. really tho i can tell you right now the majority of this album is getting 10s across the board because i love it so much

**dreamingoutloud92**: I don't get it? I heard a lot of hype over this album but this album was really hard to listen to at points. I think the overly dramatic production and her vocals just didn't work for me - sorry gays :(

**Mudkip1**: i've been playing this album on repeat for a while now and i'm in love. every single song except for the space tapes is amazing and i can't get enough

**kappyko**: Favorite one to rediscover and re-open. 'Nothing's Real' is full of anxiety and science fiction inspired aesthetic elements that create a really special take on a style that often gets derided for being too overused nowadays. It really does feel like Shura understand what made the '80s great: captivating vocalists and quirky themes.

**cyborglilith**: Words to describe this album: light, airy, icy, clean, buoyant. Shura’s production is amazing.

**geliouus**: Ever since I first heard Touch wayyy back when it was on Hypemachine I KNEW she'll do great and this album proved me soooo right!! Top 5 of 2016 for sure

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: who is this noname trash. Jk stop sleeping on Shura hos

**cloudbustingmp3**: 2016 was jammed packed with some stellar releases from some of my favorite artists. Beyoncé dropped another audiovisual masterpiece, Gaga channeled the spirit of her aunt and also my wig, Carly dropped the best EP of the decade, and much like one of my recent dates, that's just the tip. Even with stellar releases from artists big and small, none of them stood out to me the way Nothing's Real did. This album managed to wrap up a lot of feelings that hit hard and hit close all while throwing back to some of my favorite sounds without sounding derivative in the slightest. It’s an amazingly written and immaculately produced record, and hopefully the beginning of a long and fruitful career for Shura.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Lesbians really are serving all the hard bops in this rate. While Nothing's Real is not without flaws, the album as a whole still presents itself as this really slick, consistent collection of bops you'd dance to at a really cool party. Everything about Shura's aesthetic on this record is intriguing, and, from the looks of it, her future career will follow suit.

**Mysario**: while a lot of it meshes together and nothing immediately stands out except the lackluster ending, the lyrics are fantastic and the album never truly dips in quality for its synth pop style

**Raaaaat**: yes bith omgggggggggggg

**amumumyspiritanimal**: I mean I know 0 things about Shura and only stanned What's It Gonna Be but this is an actually really solid album(except the last 20 minutes)

And we have a winner! “I Know A Place” dominated the competition from the first ballot and there was no end in sight to its reign. I’m proud of my little queer-girl-band-that-could and I’m thrilled to see the response that they’ve gotten in this rate. Congratulations, MUNA! 


**From /u/piccprincess:** There is just something epicly intangible about this song. Is it the vocals? The message? A combination of both? Who knows. To me this song represents a lot of things. It represents protection, friendship, love, strength, a desire to get better, and the fight against the system. Personally, it fills me with so much warmth that whether I'm in the car, in the shower, or even just in my room with a brush. IKAP makes me want to be a better person. It makes me want to be happy.

---
**bbfan132** (11): This is the ultimate queer anthem. MUNA needs to be noticed by more people.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (11): Anthem.

**kappyko** (11): The perfect song, actually

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (11): The most powerful and inspiring song on this entire Rate, maybe even the entire history of a Popheads rat. How could I not give this an 11? It was released just at the right timeright after the PULSE nightclub shooting. Truly an anthem for the LGBTQ+ community. I want to go a place where I can bop to this with my fellow popheads.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I don't even know what to say about this record. It sounds so different, and it still bops.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): GAY RIGHTS!

**geliouus** (10): such a bop as well

**kaylaboe** (10): just lay down your weapon

**Mysario** (10): I feel like I have so much to say for this track, but the song speaks for itself

**specfagular** (10): ok i love the message behind this song so so much and it helps that it bops off the fuckin wall

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): The lyrics here are so biting and inspirational and it’s truly remarkable how epic this song feels, especially with that blisteringly beautiful chorus.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Incredibly empowering and extremely catchy to boot. Won't be upset when this (probably?) wins.

**welcometoNY** (10): I feel like I should maybe give this my 11 but I like Crying on the Bathroom Floor slightly better

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): powerful

**therandomsinger13** (9.2): This reminds me of I Know Places by Taylor Swift, which I really love. The song is does well at making a mental image. The bridge stands out. By the end I was singing along.

**Leixander** (9): @ everyone lay down your weapon

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I may be a bit too critical of this record as a whole, but this is one song I can find very few flaws about in itself, though I was surprised about how optimistic it sounds for a dark pop album. The chorus here improves on the past songs, and what's especially glorious is the part where they sing 'lay down your weapon, lay down your weapon'. Despite the lackluster voices, this band does have good imagery to its lyrics.

**CarlieScion** (8): muna r really serving bop upon bop arent they

# And then this happened…

**amumumyspiritanimal** (0): i know yall will drag me for giving my 0 to this song but i find it basically just a st. vincent song without annie's charisma, uniqueness, nerve, or talent. add to that how overrated this song is... its basically roar by katy without the chart success and the interesting vocals. its a HAIM song but with more xanax added. its a tegan and sara song but actually bad, and i can go on and on. i just really dislike this song. ps.: straightened ringlets are not stylish if you look like this in your MV.

**Overall average**: 7.857

**TragicKingdom1**: This is a really solid debut album. I like how Muna experiments with a bit more of an alternative sound compared to the other albums in this rate, and it pays off more than it doesn't. That being said, there are a few underdeveloped songs on here that drag down the experience (like After, which imo is the worst song in the rate). There are a few songs that balance those lows out, however. [Grade: B+]

**specfagular**: have i found a new fav? SURVEY SAYS YES

**dreamingoutloud92**: What a fantastic album. I had heard two of the songs before but was blown away by the quality of the songs, specifically the production, throughout the album. Definitely going to revisit multiple times.

**kappyko**: Beautifully dark HAIM-esque pop, and the only record in this rate to not include Greg Kurstin. Queens of gothiness release an admittedly front-loaded but intriguing debut.

**geliouus**: What a great debut, even if the album get a bit boring at the middle, yet still a great listen!

**patronsaintofaspies**: Okay, I'm going to be honest. I thought this was an album made by a dude. When it turned out to be a band of women, I...was surprised. That's what I find hardest to like about this album-the vocals. They're a little muffled along with the production, and I end up getting their appeal and resenting them at the same time. But even if I have misgivings about this record's flaws, I still enjoyed several key songs from it, like Around U and I Know A Place. It's the album I have the most mixed feelings about in this rate, but I think I ultimately lean on the positive side of things.

**Mysario**: the sadness in every lyric seeps through and hits hard and with the synth-pop-rock or dark-pop or whatever it is going on here. i don't know, it works though, but I can't tell if I'm walking out of this a coolfish or an emofish

**Raaaaat**: we stan crying artsy lesbains here

**chipsi1**: Literally the absolute best album in this rate omg

**amumumyspiritanimal**: The definition of overrated imo, the singer just does some typical indie girl type of singing, and her voice is kind of grating for me...there are maybe 1 or 2 good songs on the album.
