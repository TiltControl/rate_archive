**bbfan132** (8.5): This is where the album started to dip a bit for me, but this is still good! While a lot of the other songs really stuck with me, this felt more like a song that I would play in the background and enjoy but not be fully immersed in. This placement seems right to me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is a pretty song but I kinda forget about it most of the time and don’t have much to say about it. Fun fact though: This is another Erykah song that samples Stevie Wonder, in this case [“I Love You Too Much”](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=84s_rq-6K2k) during the bridge.

#Love <3

**CarlieScion** (10): i love the lyric 'i love you much too much' and idk why

**runaway3212** (10): This is lowkey kinda sad

**seanderlust** (9.2): i'm such a sucker for the record popping sound 
effect.

**Benthetall1** (8): A less developed idea in the grand scheme of the larger album, but still not bad.
This is where the album slows down a bit.

**skargardin** (8): the beat is so good

**oanis** (7.5): Chill jazzy coffee shop vibes

#No <3

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): it's nice but I forget it exists

**abcd9muses** (7): easy to get immersed it this one! The textures recall transversing in a lush yet
pristine setting, it’s very smooth

**fadedblue09** (7): Kinda long, repetitve and gets a little busy with all the sounds going on.

**pat-rickstar** (7): Is this meant to sound so crackly? I can't tell if it's a stylistic choice or not

**ReallyCreative** (7): not my favorite

**Stryxen** (7): could definitely grow on me more but I just enjoyed it fine

**izeasklapaucius** (6): this sounds like it could be on The Sims 2 soundtrack

**bbfan132** (9): I love how you can practically hear Jill smiling while she’s singing here. It’s such an enjoyable closer, even if it isn’t the most remarkable song here. While I enjoyed it, I think Day 2 is probably a fitting place for this song to be cut.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Did you know that Jill was studying to be a teacher before dropping out to pursue poetry, and eventually music? A bonus track of *Who Is Jill Scott?* (other than the “Love Rain” remix we elected to not include) is an r&b cut that pays tribute to this story, a classic “I made it” song. It’s always empowering to hear a song about someone (especially a black woman) rising from the bottom to the top (or in this case the very start of Day 2).

#I hope all your dreams come true

**ReallyCreative** (10): groovy and excellent

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is such a cute note to end the rate/album on

**runaway3212** (10): A good closing track fitting with a good album

**Benthetall1** (9.5): Great way to end the album. It reminds me a bit of Every Ghetto, Every City, but this is not such a bad thing.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Try Jill scott from the firist Album

**fadedblue09** (9): Wow an autobiographical banger! Though I'm curious how this would've felt in
the physical version, especially since it's a hidden bonus track that plays after a long stretch of
silence.

**seanderlust** (9): so cute watching her grow up through the verses

**Stryxen** (9): this just sounds so happy :)

**abcd9muses** (8): such a sweet way to end the album

**mysario** (8): oh guess that's the end of the rate?

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is a bop but not my favorite on the record

**oanis** (7.3): Cute closer. Yes Auntie Jill. I will try my best.

**CarlieScion** (6): kinda a week outro

**skargardin** (6): a cute end to the album but I don't really care for it as much as the rest

**bbfan132** (10): I’m sad to see this going out this early on. I love when Lauryn raps, and her bars combined with the beat are such a good combination. Knowing that this and Nothing Even Matters are two of her first songs to leave saddens me…

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): For a while there it was looking like this was going to be Lauryn’s first song eliminated and tbh I kinda still wish that it was because it’s definitely my least favorite track on the album. Probably because it’s the most straightforward “rap” song in the rate but also because I just find it a bit less focused musically than the rest of *Miseducation*, it just doesn’t quite have the same killer hooks or memorable lines.

---

#You can get the money, you can get the power

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this song is incredible

**NFLfreak98** (10): The flow here is just so excellent

**seanderlust** (10): giving this a 10 because it slaps, the reference to tossed salad....I pretend I do
not see it.

**Benthetall1** (9): Brilliant bars, and one of my favorite grooves with the dope saxophones and
beat.

**MrSwearword** (9): honestly, I'm just gonna shut the fuck up and just score this album I love.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): Horns, backing vocals, the light flute you can hear over the chorus. The ending
breakdown. The whole song.

**akanewasright** (8.5): She’s such a good rapper oh my god

**fadedblue09** (8): Lyrically overwhelming, but I love the flute playing.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Smooth and cool but otherwise not my favorite

**oanis** (7.5): She's spitting. Horns going crazy.

#not you though

**runaway3212** (7.5): This is good but not great

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): I would’ve liked this more without the random ad-libs/harmonizing vocals
in the middle of the track

**ignitethephoenix** (7): her flow is great but it’s a bit boring

**whizzer0** (7): I think I'd like this (and the other rap-heavy tracks) more on repeated listens - it's
hard to take it all in first time round. But I'm all out of time...

#[Here’s the link](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+73&version=ESV)

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (7): This track made me break open my bible to get the Psalm 73
reference and I think it’s very well chosen for the track about oppression and Abrahamic religions. I
also love the instrument choices.

**bbfan132** (8.5): This is a good song, but when you compare it to everything else on the album, it seems weaker to me. It’s still good though, even if I don’t have too many thoughts on it!! I think Day 2 is about right for this song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The lyrics of this one… oof. I like this song but it’s another one of those tracks that just kinda falls in the middle of an album full of classics, which is more or less what happened to it in the rate as well. Still, you know an album is good when *this* is what the filler sounds like.

---

#Hurts to see this eliminated

**CarlieScion** (10): this sounds like actual magic

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (10): I Love the intro with a harp and the drum l. Also I love the meta of
having a music album say music and media is partially to blame for people getting the wrong
messages about love.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): I've been thinking a lot about those sad songs that are fun to dance to,
but then there are very sad songs that in theory sound really good to have sex with and methinks
this one belongs there

**plastichaxan** (10): these lyrics....hit a little too close

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): I have spent so much damn time wailing and crying to this song it's not even
funny. One of my first real breakups, I listened to this song and I cried over a girl who faked a british
accent at bars because she thought it was good practice for her improv career. I mean, I cried to
hard my RA knocked on the door to my single and asked me if somebody had died or something.
When I told her I had been broken up with, and by who, she laughed at me.

**runaway3212** (10): Just so good

**Benthetall1** (9): It really says something that this is probably the weakest of the three songs
about the split with Wyclef, because its gorgeous.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Ok I don’t know what that instrument is called but the thing that plays in
the back is really pretty

**abcd9muses** (7): this song really takes you on a journey

**fadedblue09** (7): Not as interesting as the previous songs.

**flavasavavandal** (7): Why does the opening notes remind me of Simpsons: Hit and Run?

**oanis** (7): "And if you ever been in love then you'd understand, that what you want might make
you cry, what you need might pass you by if you don't catch it" oof. Real shit.

**bbfan132** (9): Probably tied for the horniest song in the rate…. Love when Jill does a bit of spoken word on these songs. Sad to see this leave but there are so many strong songs in this rate, so it’s bound to hurt.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Jill would like to take a moment to remind us, in case you haven’t figured it out by this point in the album, that she is thirsty. A lot of the themes of the album roll up into this one so it kinda falls into the middle for me, but it’s still a very good song and I’m a bit surprised this didn’t perform better. There’s a remix of this song featuring Mos Def that turns it into a more traditional hip-hop song and it’s pretty good but we decided not to include it because remixes don’t generally perform very well in rates and it’s not *that* different, but if you thought this song was missing something maybe check it out?

#Lady Gaga (ft. Ariana Grande) - Rain On Me

**fadedblue09** (10): This song single handedly changed my impression on the spoken word
genre. Who knew that the spoken word genre can produce bops like this! 11 contender right here.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Whew I did not expect Jill to go in to so much detail here but I'm here for it!

**ReallyCreative** (10): not just anyone could pull this masterpiece off

**vayyiqra** (10): :flushed:

**oanis** (9.3): Imma sample the shit out of this at some day. BEAUTIFUL. THE KEYS. HER
VOICE. The poet is HERE.

**seanderlust** (9.2): gaga stans do NOT interact!!!!!!

**Benthetall1** (9): Has a great soulquarian sound in the back, and this is one of my favorite poems
on here, but I kind of wish she had used more melody in the verses. Still a super strong track.

**CarlieScion** (9): the talk-singing in this!!!

**noctilucentvibes** (8): Free Mumia! 📣

**waluigiest** (8): the way she says “cayenne pepper” is legendary

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is spoken word excellence but holy it’s horny haha

**Stryxen** (7.5): this is stuck in my head right now

#Beyoncé - Love Drought

**cremeebrulee** (7): sorry i’m too much of a v*rgin to like this

**runaway3212** (6.5): I don't love this but still okay

**ManofOranges** (5): I like the sound, the feel, but I just don't like the slam poetry type delivery for
most of it. The staccato part was cute though.

#She said what she said

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): loose like bowels after collard greens

**celladonn** (8.5): "loose like bowels after collard greens" eurgh

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): “loose like bowels after collard greens”
?????????????????????????????????????????

**Brendon-Urine** (2): So the more spoken style verses are alright and I like the general sound, no
hate for that but some of these lines... "Better than love, we made delicious" "Wide open, wide,
loose like bowels after collard greens" "That I was to be plowed and sowed and fertilized". Also
dropping "coochie" is a choice. Maybe this is just me being a non romantic person but it's just...
blegh to me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.1): SURPRISE! Erykah Badu put two different versions of this song on her album and I think a lot of people assumed that the flipped version (which has more pop-friendly production) would be the higher ranking of the two but NOPE! The original jazzy version is ranking higher (though we won’t spoil how much higher just yet), and I’ll talk more about the song then.

**bbfan132** (8): This is a nice track/flipped version of Certainly, but I think I prefer the original version to this (and it seems like you all agreed with me on that). This version feels a bit looser/more casual, which is cool to hear, but the original felt stronger to me.

---

#Team Flipped

**CarlieScion** (10): is anyone surprised i like this more than the OG

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): yl01reC

**frogaranaman** (10): god this BEAT

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me asking the Property brothers if my house is able to be sold yet.

**MrSwearword** (10): what has me score this one better was because the flipped mix has the sex
jam realness which makes it work so much better.

**ReallyCreative** (10): yeah a classic

**Stryxen** (10): oh yes this feels so powerful and her voice is even more emotional. A close
favourite!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): I really like the "Flipped Mix" concept, it's a really cool idea, and I think
it works really well, and I very much dig this new instrumental, it reminds me of the Gran Turismo 4
soundtrack lol

**celladonn** (9.5): It's a good song but I don't really think it was necessary to put it on the album
twice... that being said this version outsold

**izeasklapaucius** (9.5): much much much better that the original which nothing happens at all.

**seanderlust** (9): i like this version better! the kool and the gang sample really gives it a boost

**waluigiest** (9): big big jam

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.5): I was so obsessed with the Mickey line, and then I saw the genius
annotation and I experienced my own and i oop moment...

**fadedblue09** (8): For some reason this doesn't sound as awkward as the first

**ManofOranges** (8): She put her thing down, flipped it, and reversed it with this one.

**oanis** (7.5): Love how she'll play around with sounds. That's why But You Cain't Use My Phone
was so good (another conversation for another day).

#Team Original

**1998tweety** (9): the other version outsold

**Benthetall1** (7.5): taxed a bit for being unnecessary and the lesser of the two versions, but its
still a great song.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Prefer the first Certainly over this

**runaway3212** (7.5): The bottom anthem revamped! We love to see it!

**abcd9muses** (7): I loved how it recalls previous tracks’ lyrics, it’s a great way to round out the
album

**skargardin** (7): not bad by any means but i think i prefer the other version

**flavasavavandal** (6.5): I mean it kinda has go up against the unflipped version, and this just
doesn’t do it for me in the same way

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): ultimately i don’t think this is different enough from the original for me
to give it a very high score tbh

**NFLfreak98** (4.5): The only part of certainly I really loved was the bassline and you’re just gonna
take that out huh?

#True Neutral

**cremeebrulee** (8): i think this and the originally are pretty evenly matched for me

**bbfan132** (8): I’m admittedly writing these comments after I gave out the scores and I think I regret this score the most… The song felt a bit too repetitive to me at first, but listening to it again, it’s really starting to come together for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Lauryn takes shots at the industry with this one! There are a lot of pretty sounds and clever lines on this track but unfortunately it doesn’t quite do enough to distinguish itself against such stiff competition. It did make it a lot further than I thought it would though.

---

#Superstars!

**celladonn** (11): I'm so obsessed with the weird harpsichord in this, it sounds so bizarre and
good

**fadedblue09** (10): Thought provoking lyrics and a very intriguing production, definitely a
highlight for sure.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the way she drags people that drop endless remixes. FUCK the dancing
witch!!!

**cremeebrulee** (9): love the message here

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): The freaking harps! The freaking harps! The last 30 seconds of adlibs!

**runaway3212** (9): Amazing

**waluigiest** (9): when the harp came in I lost it

**Benthetall1** (8.5): Funny hearing this critique of hip hop on what ended up becoming one of the
most commercially successful hip hop albums of all time, could only be credible coming from
someone as obviously overqualified for the job as Lauryn Hill in 1998.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): one of the “worst” songs on this album but still great

**Stryxen** (8.5): invented fame AND music

**oanis** (8.2): Production here for some reason is reminding me of the whimsicality of Chloe x
Halle's production specifically in Tipsy. Tying the songs from this historic album to contemporary
albums drives home just how important this album was and is for the genre. Pointed call out to the
state of music then too.

**abcd9muses** (8): I love the instrumental aspects throughout this album— harpsichord, fun guitar
thrills, harps. They really elevate the songs, to the point that every song is going to be at least a 6.
And finally, a song without a skit

**ignitethephoenix** (8): love the lyrics

**MrSwearword** (8): being the track that follows Doo-Wop will never be something that any song
can overcome. But I fuck with this song too.

**SmileAndTears** (7.8): Ok but who are we dissing :eyes:

#Just kinda okay stars

**seanderlust** (7): this is the first sort-of-miss on the record. I get where she's coming from and
she has some interesting critiques of fame, but it's just...fine I guess? idk maybe it was more
relevant in the late 90s

**skargardin** (7): really makes you think

**flavasavavandal** (6): I get the exhausted feeling of the song is the point, but it really drags this song down

**oscarbrierley1** (5): could do with being like a minute shorter

**bbfan132** (10): I really wish this made it further. It’s so smooth in the best way possible, and it always relaxes me when I listen to it. In reality, I understand why a 6 minute ballad is out on day 2, but this song is definitely special to me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song is a bit long but I think it absolutely justifies its run time, it’s a slow burn of energy that just swells up under your feet. I don’t have a ton to say about it but I’m very glad that it wasn’t horribly robbed!

---

#Gamers

**oscarbrierley1** (11): this is one of my favourite songs of all time I can't really explain why

**cremeebrulee** (10): i love the delivery here ... its so soft and smooth. i think if i had an 11 for this
album it would be for this song so i hope it does well!

**fadedblue09** (10): The instrumental is subtle yet exquisite, very soothing.

**oanis** (10): Late night drive shit.

**skargardin** (10): I hope balladphobia does not rob this of a high placement, it's gorgeous

**Benthetall1** (9.5): This song was not my favorite for a long time. But it’s a slow burn, and it’s a
piece of brilliant songwriting. Proves a song doesn’t need to jump out of the speakers to be
memorable and profound.

**ManofOranges** (9): A little long for my liking but other than that it's very good.

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): it's just groovy and fun and makes me want to grind in a dimly lit club wearing
a red dress with a slit up the side with a man that smells like cocoa butter and black and milds.

**abcd9muses** (8): There’s a lot of duality in this— softness with strength is the main overarching
one. I love this.

**MrSwearword** (8): if only for "work ain't honest but it pays the bills"

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is just very nice to listen to. It doesn’t feel like a song I’d listen to on its own, but it’s a very nice album cut and I appreciate it for that

#Gamerphobic

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is so chill but it’s making me sleepy lol

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): When I agreed to cohost this rate I had never heard this album before but from the second I heard this song I was hooked. This track underscores a lot of what I’ve been talking about with the idea of neo-soul blending the past and the future,:her childhood in the neighborhood and another lifetime in Africa are one and the same to her here. There’s a tender sensuality to the way that she just flows freely throughout time, as if she has an eternity to croon to you and she’s going to milk every second of it. Her voice is so smooth and the music is so soothing… ugh, I love it so much.

**bbfan132** (8.5): Such a relaxing/chill intro to Jill’s album (not including Jilltro). While it isn’t one of my favorite songs on her album, I think this still works very well and fits in nicely. Day 2 feels right for this song.

---

#Looks like everyone remembered

**fadedblue09** (10): One of the finest vocal performances in the rate.

**TiltControls** (10): my 11 if my 11 did not exist. The control over this song is actually incredible

**waluigiest** (10): okay I am gagged by the effortless blend of vocal perfection and spoken word

**runaway3212** (9.5): I don't want to give all 10s so I'm very critical and this goes on just a little tad too long

**akanewasright** (9): I love how fucking smooth so many of these songs are

**Benthetall1** (9): Funny, a great groove

**skargardin** (9): cmon vocals

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.8): love this production

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): it gets the point five purely for the high note

**seanderlust** (8.4): i love her halting delivery of the chorus

**abcd9muses** (8): another great track, I love how it takes a softer approach after the heavy
hitting intro!

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is weirdly haunting but i love it, but it's kind of not memorable to me, at
least as much as some of the others

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): very soothing

**oanis** (7.3): Very beautiful. 'Hide and go Freak'??? omg 👀

**CarlieScion** (7): her voice feels like a hug

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this makes me think of the hit song by Jay Sean, “Do You Remember”
featuring Lil Wayne and Sean Paul.

#Jill if you’re reading this their DMs are open

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): I would do so many dirty nasty freaky things to this lady. She is thicker than a
bowl of oatmeal in Antarctica. Whew. Her voice is just so quietly sexy and powerful, like the way
she sings the word 'bad', the confidence here is inspiring.

**bbfan132** (9): It’s “just” a bonus track but the trumpets here are excellent. I absolutely love the atmosphere here, even if it was made for a soundtrack. I’m happy to see that it made it this far in the rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): *Baduizm* is technically the shortest album in the rate in terms of both length and the number of tracks (several of which are interludes or repeats) so my co-host and I agreed to include this so that Erykah could bulk up her numbers a bit, plus it technically is included on the special edition of the album so it counts. It didn’t exactly dominate the rate or anything but it’s a nice song and I’m glad we threw it in there. Check out *Eve’s Bayou* by the way, it’s an amazingly atmospheric horror/drama that’s worth watching.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this is so jazzy and soul-y and good(y)

**Benthetall1** (9): Wow, a song of hers I haven’t heard before. This has some incredible lines, and
some wild trumpet. Really all I can ask for.

**bbfan132** (10): This really did not deserve to get cut this early on…. I absolutely fucking love the lyrics - she really isn’t holding any punches!!!! This was easily a 10 for me, I’m surprised to see it leaving on Day 3, but oh well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): A song about Jill threatening to throw hands with her man’s ex, the structure of this song is actually kind of interesting: it goes “Chorus -> Verse -> Chorus -> Verse -> Bridge -> Chorus -> Verse -> Outro,” a neat little quirk. I personally am not a huge fan of this one, while the song is pretty it’s just kind of “there” compared to another songs in the rate and I didn’t even know it was a single until I was putting together the playlist for the rate (oops). Also it could just be me though but the placement of this song after “Exclusively,” which sees Jill discovering her man is cheating on her, paints the story of the song in a slightly different light. Doth the lady protest too much?

**bbfan132** (10): I love these lyrics and the little skit at the beginning. Given the subject matter, I like how Erykah has an optimistic attitude regarding her relationship/interactions with this guy (“I guess I’ll see you next lifetime”). The song has a very smooth/relaxing sound to it which pairs perfectly with the lyrical content.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Erykah just has such a funky fun fresh perspective, there’s so many different layers to this song: It’s romantic, stealthily melancholy, even vaguely humorous. Also the hook of this song is, in my opinion, one of the catchiest things on *Baduizm*. I would maybe have bumped this song even higher but this is a great place for it to finish so I’m not mad about it.

---

#Ascending towards nirvana

**Benthetall1** (10): Man the front half of this album is just one classic after another. Shows that
Badu could be straightforward in her meanings and still create something totally elevated. Also
seems like an appropriate time to say that Erykah Badu has an unbelievable voice, totally elastic
and emotive.

**celladonn** (10): This one is gorgeous

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh this song is so bitterwseet :( i really love stuff that explores the theme of
right person/wrong time so this is an easy 10 for me

**hhiggy** (10): this gets stuck in my head constantly its just too good

**ManofOranges** (10): I'd kick it with a squirrel if it were playing this song.

**MrSwearword** (10): well damn

**oanis** (10): another one of those songs that hit more as I get older.

**waluigiest** (10): pure magic the whole way through. Also she dated Andre 3000??????

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9.5): OMG This is like my fourth time listening to it and I just realized that it's
almost seven minutes long!!!!!!!

**NFLfreak98** (9.5): This one just hit right for some reason

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): it's fantastic but I don't think it needs to be 6 and a half minutes long

#When you die nothing happens

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Not really feeling this one, although it is pretty.

**fadedblue09** (8): A flavorful groovy number but the lyrics get a little meh at times.

**runaway3212** (8): Simple but effective

**skargardin** (8): a vibe

**noctilucentvibes** (7.5): is the intro good corny or bad corny? idk

**CarlieScion** (7): this was cute

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.8): good but just drags on a bit too much for me as it gets pretty repetitive by the end

**abcd9muses** (6): this is the first song that I feel like is a bit step down, too much like other Neo-
soul songs in a way that’s not distinguishable from Badu and others

**flavasavavandal** (5): Erykah really said procrastination is key on this song

bbfan132: #Someone unpack this

**Roxieloxie** (10): Okay, The year was 2015. I was a freshmen In High school, I had joined
marching band, I played trombone. I did not know how to play trombone. My band was intense as
hell, we probably worked harder than the football team, my band director was an asshole, the co
director was slightly less of an asshole but still, you know. 'Now Roxie, what the absolute fuck does
this have to do with the Neo Soul rate' Im so glad you asked dear reader. Well, once football
season ended We we're preparing to go on a school trip out of town to play at a college
homecoming game. This fucking song right here was one of the songs on our mix, Now I've known
this song for a while so this wasnt my first exposure to it. However when you spend weeks on end
trying to learn this song, while also trying to learn trombone, while being yelled at by the 19 other
boys in my section, its truly something. BUt nothing will compare to the day we had to practice in
the parking lot because the field was wet, and it started raining, and there I was glasses soaked,
not able to see, hulling around this trombone I did not know how to play. It was just a mess. The
worst part of it is, the trip was actually the worst experience, I got stuck in a 16 hour car ride, had a
crisis where I realized I didnt even like band while listening to 1D's last album. and then we did all of
that just to end up outside in freezing weather for us to not even play during the game. And then
after that I got sick for a month. That being said I cant listen to this song now without thinking of all
of that, but I genuinely love it therefore i cant not give it a ten

**bbfan132** (10): I know that this isn’t *technically* the outro, but it still works really well as Lauryn’s final song here. She sells the song nicely with her vocals, and the production is crisp as well. Definitely a strong track!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Back when music was on records/CDs there used to be this archaic thing called “hidden tracks,” which were bonus songs hidden behind large swatches of silence. “Tell Him” was one of those and it’s too good to be silenced, this is a beautiful song and I love the lyrics so I’m very glad that it made it this far. Balladphobia lost!

#Told him

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): absolutely beautiful. like being punched in the heart but in a happy way.

**TiltControls** (10): Another potential 11

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.4): v v cute [2]

**ManofOranges** (9): Just oh so relaxing to me.

**SmileAndTears** (9): I really like this. Very relaxing

**Benthetall1** (8.5): Lovely, could have been on the album but I don’t question why it ended up
being a bonus track.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A very soulful bonus track

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (8): Another really sweet love song but it’s also really introspective and
for me seems like a prayer/vows (“I won’t be jealous part) that ties together the themes of the
album with its religious themes/allusions and self awareness. I love the back up singing.

**plastichaxan** (8): my least favorite and still an 8, what she deserves

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is nice

**izeasklapaucius** (6): don't really care that much about this

#The Chainsmokers - Closer (feat. Halsey)

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): A perfect closer

**cremeebrulee** (9): love this as a closer

**bbfan132** (8.5): This isn’t a standout in my opinion, but it’s certainly a good track! I’m a bit surprised to see that it made it this far, but this whole album is strong, so it’s understandable.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.8): So Lauryn Hill has a lot of ties to the Marley family throughout her life and this song is one of them: It incorporates [“Concrete Jungle” by Bob Marley](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y07vgARrOUE) and his son, Julian Marley, plays guitar here. Also Spotify doesn’t seem to mention this but the song features a Jamaican dancehall/rap artist named [Shelly Thunder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pT5zNhBKOM), I looked into her a bit and apparently she had some mild success in the ‘80s in the New York scene and now sings gospel! So this is definitely a track with an interesting pedigree lol

---

#Those forgiven

**abcd9muses** (11): I believe this track is a perfect blend of all the trademarks of Lauryn Hill
songs. From the lyrical content of patiences, hurt, yearning, religion, and love, to the reggae and
soul instrumentals, to her vocal embellishments. It’s amazing, it can be played in any setting. It’s
also one of the few songs on this album that I think the ending skit isn’t too jarring or distracting. It’s
a song I would show to someone who isn’t sure if they’d like Neo-soul, or if I’m asked on the spot to
take control of the aux. It’s a safe choice in that it’ll bang for anyone

**Benthetall1** (10): I think DWTT SHOULD win, but my heart belongs to daddy Forgive Them Father.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): the production on this still sounds so fresh

**plastichaxan** (10): incredibly powerful

**ReallyCreative** (10): I will be irrationally upset if this does not make day 3

**runaway3212** (10): This is lowkey my favourite sentence out of the bible

**seanderlust** (10): god what a verse that second verse is

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Love the different instrumentals used here.

**CarlieScion** (9): this made me float to another dimension

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i could never do this, i hold onto grudges for life. If you have ever wronged me, my life goal is to take you out

**skargardin** (8): shelly thunder went off here

**Stryxen** (8): i feel like i’ve heard this sampled somewhere arhghh

**akanewasright** (7.5): There’s... a choice lyric or two in here, but overall a bop

**oanis** (6): Not one I'd go back to, but points were made.

#wait a minute this is too deep...

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (10): I love the intro with the Lord’s Prayer and the twist in it lol. I think
personally using a prayer that’s supposed to end with forgiving others trespasses as you forgive our
as it is done until the end to be about betrayal both personal and socially is very clever. Especially
then with the Cain and Abel and then the Judas and Jesus references. I really like when it changes
from being addressed to God to the audience particularly with the verse “if they’ll lie to God why
wouldn’t they lie to you?” The lyricism is just great.

**bbfan132** (10): This song completely draws me in - I even almost forgot to write a comment for this until it was nearly over… It’s well-crafted and has a certain atmosphere that works nicely here. The Flipped It mix is also good but this version just has something that elevates it for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The original version of “Certainly” is the higher placing one, which is kinda neat because it’s also objectively the less pop-friendly version. They feature the same somewhat ambiguous lyrics though: Erykah herself has said this song is an allegory for black Americans being kidnapped from Africa and forced to change their culture, but the lyrics can also be interpreted as being about a woman who decides she doesn’t need men, or just a straightforward story of a date gone wrong. It’s so layered we have to hear it twice to understand it I guess.

---

#Fuck you flipped version

**Awkward\_King** (10): the way she sings SLIP ME A QUICKIE >>>>>>>

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I wasn't prepared for the vocal harmonies at the end. They're HAUNTING
and I love it. Erykah can just ride these instrumentals so effortlessly.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Cer10ly

**flavasavavandal** (10): Deeply cathartic

**frogaranaman** (10): god this fucking bass line

**ReallyCreative** (10): maybe the best song on the album? its phenomenal

**Benthetall1** (9): I always get lost in the details of her delivery of every line on this one, but there’s a lot going on that makes Certainly a fascinating song. The whole band improvising behind
her is on fire.

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (9): I love the instrumental.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): groovy song with great lyrics

**oanis** (9): "Who gave you permission to rearrange me? Certainly not me...." OOF. Auntie Badu
was preaching to me!! The added context of the 'mickey' (something that I totally missed as a kid)
made this song appropriately heavy and brought up important themes of agency for SA victims.

**Stryxen** (9): Sir Tin Lee

**waluigiest** (9): that chunky bass is everything

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): Tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiime https://youtu.be/Hsv4-3txwa0?t=5

**ManofOranges** (8): Not me thinking she was saying "you slipped me a hickey"

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Love the piano beats and the message is cute, but some of the lyrics are a
little awkward.

**akanewasright** (7.1): Cute little bop

**abcd9muses** (7): Neo-soul does play with jazz, and it’s a reoccurring aesthetic in this album, but
I think it really finds a home in this track. It’s great!

**bbfan132** (9): Lauryn sounds so good here!! I love the funk-inspired elements in this song, it all comes together really nicely. I’m happy to see that it made it to the end of Day 2!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Part of Lauryn’s appeal in her heyday was how she elevated the “urban” aesthetic; she felt like the girl from down the block but she turned that into poetry, and it really allowed her to speak to that demographic. You can really see that on this track, which is an ode to her upbringing in the city and to people growing up like that all around the world. I think that’s a really important thing that music can do, illuminate the beauty in places that society doesn’t usually recognize it.

#Didn’t forget what they got

**noctilucentvibes** (11): i really do have love for my city; there's so many 11s in this rate but this
hit me with the interconnectedness of us all

**Benthetall1** (10): I’m fairly certain this is an intentional tribute to Stevie Wonder in sound, while
being a tribute to her NJ upbringing in the lyrics. Either way, another masterpiece of hip hop
storytelling.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Love the storytelling in this!

**fadedblue09** (10): I just have a soft spot for autobiographical songs like this. They really paint
the social background to the artist which in turn gives deeper context to the music.

**pat-rickstar** (10): I'm going into this rate completely blind so I have no idea how popular this
song is compared to the others - but I considered giving it my 11 on first listen, love the funk sound
here

**seanderlust** (10): I love songs like this that are lyrically so specific. she paints a great picture

**Stryxen** (10): this is just a perfect song i can’t think about one thing that could improve this

**waluigiest** (10): it’s got this great, funky kind of nostalgia to it

**NFLfreak98** (9.6): This is just obviously a masterpiece right? With those dueling basslines? I
mean come on

**Brendon-Urine** (9): The way the bassline carries this song is legendary.

**Roxieloxie** (9): The line where she mentions the Beef Patty with Coco Bread>>>>>>>> Literally
an Immaculate combo, This song reminds me of my dad and him telling me stories of him growing
up in NY so im legally obligated to give this a 10

**akanewasright** (8): This production slaps.

**bbfan132** (10): HOW is this going out today????? As TK said to me on Discord, that first verse is among the best in the entire rate. I love how you can picture everything she’s singing here - she truly is a wonderful poet and lyricist. This might’ve been my favorite Jill song, so I’m sad to see it leaving here.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): A fun fact is that this was technically the very first song to win the rate, back when there was only one ballot in this held the top spot! Unfortunately every subsequent ballot knocked it further from that coveted podium but it was still a fun way to kick things off, and I wouldn’t be mad if it had stayed the winner. This really clicked for me when I was watching videos to prepare the reveal I came across a video of her singing this song at the NAACP awards (if you’re watching the reveal you’ve already seen it since she sings “Do You Remember?” as well) and watching everyone in the audience sing along with her was just pure joy, and apparently a lot of you have warm fuzzies for this one as well.

#People who had a hearty breakfast

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): BITCH. BIIIIIIIIIIIIIIITCH. This song goes slap the fuck off. There's no faster
way to get a room of Black people losing their goddamn minds than to put this song on and wait for
that first chorus to hit. This song is a masterpiece of funk, soul, and just soft and sensual Black joy.
It's a classic for a reason, and I cannot explain enough how much I love this song and would
happily listen to it forever.

**cremeebrulee** (10): those opening lyrics serving Friday - Rebecca Black teas help ...... ok but
seriously her delivery is so good here that she can get away with just singing her morning routine

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): wow this album is just straight 10s huh

good. Obligatory: GRiiiiiiiiiiitsssss

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): whatever I said about Nothing even matters, besides doing the rate, is relevant
here too

**seanderlust** (9.2): fastball outsold. no but for real, this is excellence.

**akanewasright** (9): This is the kind of soul music I think of when I think “soul”

**Benthetall1** (9): Successful on all fronts, great groove with a killer chorus, shows off the funny
and horny side of her writing style. Also, food porn, which I appreciate.

**runaway3212** (9): Love the way she says 'oh word'

**TragicKingdom1** (9): griiiits

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Hmm I think things are starting to get repetitive from here. I still love the
instrumental though.

**abcd9muses** (8): simply good, the pacing is great, theatrical

**skargardin** (8): i can't stress enough how gorgeous the strings are

#Shockingly this is not the shitpost

**ManofOranges** (10): Outsold Ariana's The Way I think.

**CarlieScion** (9): ari who
