**bbfan132** (10): When I first listened to this album in full, I think that this was probably my favorite song outside of On & On. It is kind of repetitive, but it drew me in with its melody and production. I‚Äôm a bit surprised that it made it to Day 3 over a few other songs, but I‚Äôm happy to see it!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I definitely did not expect this song to be in Day 3 and‚Ä¶ to be honest I‚Äôm still not entirely sure why it‚Äôs here. It‚Äôs a cute little track but I find it to be one of the less memorable ones on Baduizm and there were quite a few songs we‚Äôve lost that I‚Äôd like to see in its place. It is kinda neat to note that [a portion of the song was expanded into a full song on Erykah‚Äôs next album](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1C6qktSNJQU) though.

#Four leaf clover

**Benthetall1** (10): Another classic, one of her best grooves and hooks on the chorus.
**cremeebrulee** (10): oh this is a bop!!!

**fadedblue09** (10): A bouncy, jazzy bop. More worth it than an actual four-leaf clover.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): definitely my favorite track so far

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me after watching the 2001 Disney Channel Original Movie (DCOM) ‚ÄúThe Luck of The Irish‚Äù

**izeasklapaucius** (10): highlight of this album!

**pat-rickstar** (10): I don't have a lot of comments on this album so far but this is really nice, idk
what else to say really

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is just so fucking delicious

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): I don‚Äôt hate bad horror flicks starring Jennifer Anniston, but Erykah
singing leprechaun took me out the song for about three seconds

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): oh i like this

**oanis** (8.8): One of those songs that's just stuck in my head all the time. Love the little piece of
Bag Lady in this song. So cool to see how she builds off her previous work.

**Awkward\_King** (8): literally what do you want me to do when this album is full of bangers

**Stryxen** (8): The bassline is very bassy

**CarlieScion** (7.5): Bootzilla BABY

#Three leaf clover

**abcd9muses** (6): again, feels kind of uninspired, it feels like more could be done to it, but the
lyrics are really cute and I like the xylophone like textures!

**noctilucentvibes** (6): this is the only song on the album where i was like "it's repeating too much
tho" üòî

**runaway3212** (6): I have never found a 4 leaf clover and this song reopens that trauma for me

**skargardin** (6): I don't hate this by no means but it doesn't really stand out

**bbfan132** (8.5): I wish this clicked with me more, but it‚Äôs still good for sure! I get why a lot of people who participated really enjoyed this track. I‚Äôm happy to see it make it to the final day, even if it wasn‚Äôt my favorite.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I did some research but I was not able to find out why Jill opens this song by speaking Spanish, but I‚Äôm assuming it‚Äôs because she decided to give this one a Spanish flair in general with the rhythms and horns. I‚Äôm not quite sure *why* but it‚Äôs an interesting change of pace from the rest of the album, but personally I think it‚Äôs a bit out of place and I‚Äôm surprised it‚Äôs ranking so high.

**celladonn** (10): This one is a vibe

**ReallyCreative** (10): showing versatile sound palates, your fave couldn't

**abcd9muses** (8): this is so fun

**waluigiest** (8): harmonies go crazy on this

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): Cute idea but ends up cheesy to me. I do like the song outside of the lyrics
though, the backing vocals and trumpets are nice.

**Stryxen** (6): what is happening

**oanis** (5.3): I thought I accidentally skipped to another album lmao. It doesn't really fit with
everything to me? Not my favorite beat either.

#Comments that reference the Spanish influences

**Benthetall1** (10): Favorite instrumental, makes me wonder if she should have leaned more into
Spanish-influenced soul.

**CarlieScion** (10): this instrumental oh my god !!!

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (10): I love latin brass so much.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): ¬°PUNTO!

**TragicKingdom1** (9): love the little mariachi (?) flairs

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): queen of spanish

#Comments that reference math

**Awkward\_King** (10): math joke

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): No

**runaway3212** (10): Math queenie

**NFLfreak98** (9.1): (Myself + Myself) x (You + Yours + You) = Me

**seanderlust** (8.5): "if 2 plus 2 is 4....and 5 plus 5 is 10...what is this?"

**fadedblue09** (8): A mathematical bop of self-love and independence!

**noctilucentvibes** (7.8): principia mathematica found dead in a ditch

**flavasavavandal** (5): If you are someone who wants to write music or make songs, please don‚Äôt
include math equations in your lyrics, it never works as well as you might think

#Comment that references Taylor Swift

**Roxieloxie** (10): Hey kids math is fu-

**bbfan132** (10): Such a strong outro to the main album (excluding the bonus tracks). It might be kind of slow, but you can hear the passion flowing out of Lauryn‚Äôs voice. I‚Äôm thrilled to know that it made it to Day 3!

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): The closer of the standard edition of the album, this gorgeous ballad is one of my favorite songs in the rate. Though the title is never actually referenced in the lyrics [Lauryn herself has explained why she chose to use it:](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cVTIbgHaWjs) ‚Äúmiseducation‚Äù isn‚Äôt being used in a negative sense here, but rather to refer to a different kind of education formed through life experiences rather than in schools. This is interesting to think about in the context of all the ‚Äúclassroom‚Äù interludes peppered throughout the album as none of these scenes discuss the type of things traditionally discussed in school, but they‚Äôre illuminating nonetheless. And the fact that Lauryn herself is marked conspicuously absent from these discussions in the intro just brings everything full circle because she‚Äôs describing the things she leaned when she wasn‚Äôt in school here. I think that the record scratches playing over the track are appropriate in this sense because they represent Lauryn forging her own path, continuing to sing even after the record has run out of songs.

#Define your own destiny (and scores)

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Wow, this is just... stunning. Beautiful vocals, instrumental and lyrics...
balladphobia better not strike here!

**Benthetall1** (10): The True Ending of the record.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): :((((

**ReallyCreative** (10): GORGEOUS

**runaway3212** (10): stunning

**seanderlust** (9.3): LOVE the instrumental on this

**abcd9muses** (9): I feel like this song sounds really current, like I could clearly see how a lot of
our rnb critical darlings get their inspiration from.

**akanewasright** (9): This is a really nice ‚Äúcloser‚Äù to the record.

**ManofOranges** (9): This one is mm very good.

**CarlieScion** (8): her voice is just so :comfy:

**oanis** (8): define your own destiny!

**SmileAndTears** (8): quite beautiful

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The instrumental here is pretty lovely! Lol I was supposed to comment that
this fits better as the outro until I realized it actually was (in the standard edition).

**izeasklapaucius** (6): lousy way to end an album

#Congratulations!

**skargardin** (9): I'm just about to finish my master's and damn the lyrics really hit me. The future
is such a scary thing, especially when you've been commfortable in your current position for a
couple years.

**bbfan132** (10): This was totally robbed of a higher placement in my opinion‚Ä¶ Lauryn is a fucking excellent rapper, and this works amazingly as an introduction to the album. I‚Äôm happy it made it to day 3, but I wish it could‚Äôve made the top 10 :/

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): Lauryn kicks the album off with a bang, right off the bat she hits you with her ability to create songs that convey a message while still being total bangers: ‚ÄúLost Ones‚Äù has straight up one of the best beats I‚Äôve ever heard in a song and Lauryn spits straight fire from beginning to end while showcasing her vocals as well. This song is a not-so-subtle dig at her ex Wyclef Jean, coincidentally a member of her ex-group The Fugees‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs a whole mess, look it up, but the song is great!

---

#Team Lauren

**izeasklapaucius** (11): now THAT'S how you clear a bitch. Opening your album with such an
aggressive note is a brave move and she did THAT and more.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I think this is one of the coolest boast tracks of the 90s. I know the
situation between Lauryn and the Fugees is messy and complicated, and she's possibly not in the
right, but this track makes a strong case for her winning that war.

**akanewasright** (10): Wait I forgot how hard Lauryn went here

**Brendon-Urine** (10): I remember the magic of hearing this for the first time, as someone who
hadn't heard of Lauryn Hill for an embarrassingly long time and just starting this album from the
start.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Oh she's going IN right from the start.

**hhiggy** (10): going to be very difficult to not rate every song on this album a 10

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): just a straight banger

**MrSwearword** (10): if I recall correctly, this is the Wyclef diss track and I am here for it. Also, it
just fucking bangs.

**oanis** (10): IT'S FUNNY HOW MONEY CHANGE A SITUATION. My favorite memory with this
song is this old youtube video (it's gone now) of Janelle Mon√°e rapping this song live at a club back
in like 2009 or something. This is absolutely an anthem.

**plastichaxan** (10): that laugh at the end my god, this song is just perfect

**ReallyCreative** (10): that's how you start an album

**skargardin** (10): she went off

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): love the vibes this has

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): This song is amazing. It's soulful, it's funky, and it's perfect to just vibe to. It
gives me thick smoke, waist beads, and shea butter. It's giving me stretch marks and script tattoos,
and gold teeth.

**seanderlust** (9): love the subtle Biblical references. there are quite a few, but none of them feel
heavy-handed

**Benthetall1** (8.5): Lauryn opens the album with guns blazing. I do honestly think it‚Äôs one of the
weaker hooks on the album, but the verses are spectacular. Really the final word on the Fugees‚Äô split.

**celladonn** (8.5): Wyclef Jean found shaking

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): dragged Wyclef so hard it took Shakira to revive him

**CarlieScion** (8): we hate men! docked two points bc the outro was loooooong

**runaway3212** (8): Great opening especially combined with Intro

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A banger of an opening track, but it sounds crowded at times.

**noctilucentvibes** (7.5): the skit so so cute

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (7): I like the use of the classroom audio

#Team Wyclef

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): Those overlapping "ones" in the chorus remind me of DJ sets where
they spam some obnoxious sound effect over and over

**abcd9muses** (6): this is the premise of Normal People: ‚ÄúIt's funny how money change a situation; Miscommunation leads to complication‚Äù

**mysario** (6): taking away points because the intro is missing!!!!!!!!

**SmileAndTears** (6): Welp this was QUITE repetitive

**oscarbrierley1** (4): a bit repetitive and idk I don't like it compared to the rest

#Comment that mentions Taylor Swift

**Stryxen** (9): i hate to be a swiftie on main but why does this remind me of kendrick's verse in
bad blood

**bbfan132** (10): Two of my favorite Lauryn songs out back to back‚Ä¶ Probably one of the sweetest songs in the rate, although it‚Äôs kind of odd listening to it knowing what has come out within the past year. It‚Äôs one of my favorites, but this seems about right for the song.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Reading the comments some of y‚Äôall left on this one actually made me a little emotional to the point where I actually went in and switched the shitpost at the last minute. This is such a beautiful, powerful song! Her son‚Äôs name is actually Zion and it provides some interesting layered imagery for the lyrics as she starts to blur the line between her son Zion and the biblical Zion as if he and the holy land are one and the same, and she‚Äôs blessed to march towards them. Lauryn has been embroiled in some‚Ä¶ controversy surrounding her relationship with her children but it‚Äôs not my place to stick my nose into other people‚Äôs family affairs, and the song stands on its own as a touching tribute to maternal love.

---

#Marching, beautiful beautiful

**Brendon-Urine** (11): What a flawless song. Her voice is spectacular and just the pure love all
over this song... it's amazing. Oh and the guitar work is chefs kiss

**Roxieloxie** (11): I think this was one of the few songs on the album going in that I hadnt actually
heard before and oh my god?!??! One of my friends is really interested in the Mortality rate for
Black Mothers (which is really depressing so i wont get into it in detail here, but I highly recommend
looking into it if you dont know) and like how historically black woman even ranging up to
Beyonce/Serena Williams/Megan Marckle talk about the difficulties they face during their
pregnancy, just because of the medical racism that exists, and just even thinking about my own
mother who was told that she would never have children, Hearing this literally almost brings me to
tears, and im not even a very maternalistic person. The climax of the song where you hear hear
scream 'my joy' over and over is literally so beautiful, I just love how this song that exists simply as
an ode to her yet to be born child and just in the context of how difficult black motherhood can be, it
just feels like this beautiful celebration. Coming into this rate I didnt expect to give this my 11 but
I've spent 8 minutes trying to form my words on this one song and my eyes are teary so i feel like i
have to

**seanderlust** (11): god can you imagine having a mom that not only made a song for you as a
baby but put it on her critically acclaimed album and partnered with a legendary guitarist for it and
having it be SO. DAMN. GOOD?

**Awkward\_King** (10): MY JOY

**ElizabethDDoS** (10):

**noctilucentvibes** (10): beyond beautiful

**plastichaxan** (10): i didn‚Äôt know what to expect of this collab and the result was just greatness

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): This song makes me cry every single time I listen to it. I love my mama, a lot.
We don't have the best relationship, but I will always relate this song to her swaying back and forth
with me in our kitchen on Saturday mornings, trying to teach me how to dance, even a little bit. I
hear this song and I think of cheap jasmine perfume and listening to gospel music in the back of her
99 Camry on the way to school. This song always gets me in my feelings, whew. And the drums?
The choir? The production in the end? The wailing that is so close to speaking in tongues? The
guitar playing that is masterful and simple? That high note?

**Stryxen** (10): this song is beautiful beautiful :) and when she‚Äôs screaming it does something to
me

**TiltControls** (10): this song is so good that it's just like the ocean under the moon. it's the same
as the emotion that I get from you. it's got the kind of lovin' that can be so smooth

**waluigiest** (10): this melts my whole heart. Including the classroom outro

**Benthetall1** (9.5): I‚Äôve seen her perform this live and you can tell how much this song means to
her. Seems restrained here by comparison, but only slightly.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): Any track with Santana is a win for me

**izeasklapaucius** (8): kinda sad in retrospect considering that Ms. Hill treats her children like crap
but hey at least the music's good

**ManofOranges** (8): Really sad subject matter in parts to me, but overall a really beautiful song.

**MrSwearword** (8): not much to pick apart here, proficient vocals and all.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): The guitar was nice

**runaway3212** (7): The meaning of Zion has changed which has changed so this song has sort
of aged but it's still good

**fadedblue09** (6.5): The Latin flair is interesting, but I get lost with the lyrics.

**oanis** (6): first time hearing this but it's not one I'd go back to even though the message is great.
Also as I listened to this I realized that Santa is absolutely one of my guitar inspirations so thanks
for that realization y'all haha.

**astrologicalangel** (5): Santana improves everything

#The skip button is free kids

**ImADudeDuh** (8): im gonna be upset if this album is just gonna be ‚Äúgood song followed by skit
about love that drags the score down‚Äù

**abcd9muses** (7): I‚Äôm starting to be disinterested in the school skits taking a third of the song‚Äôs
duration

**CarlieScion** (7): okay this is so damn sweet, but damn that outro skit? streaming has ruined me,
i need all of those to be their own tracks

**bbfan132** (10): This was one of the first songs I heard off of this album, and although it is a cover, I loved it. She applies her own artistry/style to the song in a way that makes it much stronger than the original. It might be one of the more straightforward tracks on the album, but it‚Äôs still strong.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): So somewhat surprisingly this was actually in first place for a bit! It was displaced fairly quickly but held on to a Top 10 spot for a while until the late rush of ballots shoved it out, but it still ends up with a very respectable placement. Interesting history for this song: it was recorded for the movie [*Conspiracy Theory*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=adYGUai7PNc) while Lauryn was eight months pregnant and it became a radio hit so they tacked it on to the album. Covers are a big part of Lauryn‚Äôs career (*Sister Act 2* and her work with The Fugees were her main claims to fame before the album was out) so it feels like a natural addition though. While I like this arrangement much more than the original I do have to admit that I prefer the more disco take on the song popularized by Boys Town Gang/Gloria Gaynor.

---

#Can‚Äôt take their ears off this bop!

**TragicKingdom1** (11): this is like the lamest possible 11 because its a pretty straightforward
cover of a pop standard but I DONT CARE ITS PERFECT!!!

**Brendon-Urine** (10): Sung like it was written for her.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is really good and is so much better than that stuPID TIKTOK SONG
THAT MANAGED TO MAKE A 3 MINUTE SONG FROM A 20 SECOND LOOP THAT MADE ME
HATE THE RADIO IN LATE 2020 JAKDFNADFKV

**MrSwearword** (10): this cover knocks, period.

**plastichaxan** (10): the superior version

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): So on the flip side, about the first time I really fell in love, right? I could have
counted every one of her lashes individually, we were sitting so close to each other. Her hands
were so stupid soft, and I got distracted by her collarbones and almost failed comparative religions
over it. I just sat and yearned, and sat and yearned until she got sick of my ass and kissed me. So
sure, she faked a british accent at bars and it made me want to falcon punch her, but goddamn.
This song is what that love felt like.

**Roxieloxie** (10): This one is just so beautiful,

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): it‚Äôs a good cover but i think the original is still a bit better

**pat-rickstar** (9.3): Not my favourite version of this song but it's still pretty great

**frogaranaman** (9): why do electronic producers love to flip this song

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9): It's just that you can't go wrong with this classic

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): v v cute

**mysario** (9): Frankie Valli and Emilee are quaking in their boots

**oanis** (9): obligatory LOVE playing this on the guitar.

**SmileAndTears** (9): A cover of a classic

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A very sultry cover.

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (8): an incredibly sweet love song.

**waluigiest** (8): this actually works so well and it‚Äôs so beautiful!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is a very nice cover of the song

**Benthetall1** (7.5): It‚Äôs a good reinterpretation, although maybe not quite what ‚ÄúKilling Me Softly‚Äù
accomplished.

#Perfectly capable of taking their eyes off of you

**akanewasright** (7): I love this cover and song so much, but I‚Äôm underrating it because I would
not mind at all if this went out early

**runaway3212** (7): good cover of a mediocre song

**skargardin** (7): this is cute, very much a bonus track, but still cute

**noctilucentvibes** (6): i love this song but i don't think it holds up to the rest of her album?

**ManofOranges** (3): I guess this song is kind of in the same vein as Killing Me Softly when
Lauryn was in the fugees cause it's like an updated interpretation of an older song, but where I
didn't really have any knowledge of the original Killing Me Softly, I think I might be a little too
attached to the original Can't Take My Eyes Off of You, and I just feel like this cover leaves me
wanting so much more.

**Awkward\_King** (2): this sounds different to the original and i know different isn't always a bad
thing but this is a bad thing

**bbfan132** (9.5): This song kind of grew off me with time, but it‚Äôs still a great song by Lauryn. I feel like other songs on the album do this better, but it was a big single and it deserved to be here on day 3.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): The first of Lauryn‚Äôs iconic singles leaves us and this is probably a worthy placement for it because while I like this song, things turn into a bloodbath from here on upwards. ‚ÄúEverything is everything‚Äù is one of those lyrics that‚Äôs so simple it‚Äôs almost stupid but instead of meaning nothing it somehow means, well‚Ä¶ everything! Lauryn was an icon to a generation of inner city communities and her message of perseverance and living to fight for a better tomorrow is still pretty resonant to this day. Also this is probably very easy to understand but I‚Äôll mention how much I love the usage of circular imagery in the music video. Interestingly we have something of a hidden cameo on this song as well: a young John Legend is playing piano!

#Everything

**Benthetall1** (10): Another classic. If you thought Ms. Hill was going to run out of steam at some
point, nah. This isn‚Äôt the place for that.

**CarlieScion** (10): sky ferreira wishes

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Phenomenal all the way through.

**MrSwearword** (10): WHEW what a video and basically the other main contender for the eleven I
had.

**oanis** (10): A whole mantra.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): The girls are not giving you vocals like this these days. They aren't giving you
harmonies and angelic anger this way, okay. They aren't giving you the scathing hope of this song.
They don't have the range!

**Roxieloxie** (10): Another classic that just instantly takes me back to getting my hair done on
saturday mornings

**seanderlust** (10): fuck it sure is buddy

**skargardin** (10): now this is such a bop, plus it has such beautiful lyricism

**waluigiest** (10): living for the dramatic orchestration

**Stryxen** (9): i love love love how intense this is omg

**abcd9muses** (8): these lyrics will forever be timely

**runaway3212** (8): facts

#Nothing

**fadedblue09** (7): Doesn't stand out much, but this one has a pretty standard outro.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): probably the weakest track on the album so far but not bad at all

**flavasavavandal** (2.5): Lauryn is best when she is being romantic or introspective af, not when
she tells people to smile, work hard in a capitalist system and wait for change. People are dying
Lauryn, just cause you can wait doesn‚Äôt mean others can.

MrSwearword: > not when she tells people to smile, work hard in a capitalist system and wait for change. People are dying Lauryn, just cause you can wait doesn‚Äôt mean others can.

First of all, this was back in 1998/1999 so it's not like this is *soooooooooooooooooo* horrendously dated and also this is the fucking dumbest reason for nuking a song. "OMG this song from years ago isn't woke af like I am" have several seats.

DilemmaOfAHedgehog: How is being anticapitalista and against the idea of waiting for change not relevant to the nineties? Someone people have been wanting a Revolution since the 19th century lool

If anything i would say I think that‚Äôs a very strong perspective the song doesn‚Äôt, like,share? For me it‚Äôs more about rigged system but that the world bends to justice that most of us probably won‚Äôt see then smile and wait around.

FlavaSavaVandal: Ok, first off. Just because it's in the 90's doesn't mean I can't be sick of songs like this. This pandemic has basically ruined my ability to enjoy these type of songs, and that is what my number is based off of, my enjoyment.

Second of all, anticapitlism has been around as long as capitalism, and while I can't say if the term "woke" was used in the 90's. I'm sure there are other people with the same thoughts when the following is one of the primary lyrics. I'm not trying to be woke, I'm just giving my honest thoughts on the song, and that was them. Don't agree, fine I never asked you to, but actually say something instead of just whining into the vacuum

**bbfan132** (9): Even if I preferred other songs, I am beyond elated to know that this made it into the top 9 of the rate. The song is so fun to listen to, and a top 10 placement for this song seems very fitting.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Jill goes for a more club friendly sound with this one with the go-go influences, and the result is one of the more ‚Äúboppy‚Äù tracks on the album. This one cracked the Top 10 at the last second and I‚Äôm glad it did, more than any of the songs in this rate I think that this is the one that makes me want to get up and shake my body around!

#Everyone loved this <3

**akanewasright** (11): Holy shit this is a bop. Like an unbelievable bop. I feel like Jill won‚Äôt win and
especially won‚Äôt win with this, but this is SUCH a fun song that I just feel compelled to give it my 11

**oanis** (11): Giving this one the 11 because it's the song I play the most out of the songs on all 3
albums. Just perfection. This song single-handedly made me want to pick trumpet as my instrument
for band in the 5th grade. And being from the DMV, the gogo-esque drums just hit me with this
beautiful wave of nostalgia because everybody was bumping this song long after it came out. Shit
just feels like pure sunshine. Makes me so happy.

**waluigiest** (11): As I did this rate, this is the song that hit me. As soon as it was over I knew it
would be my 11. I was on a walk on a chilly but crisp, sunny day and it just felt right. She nails this
bouncy, infectious Black joy and it just satiates. I can‚Äôt feel anything negative when this song is on.

**cremeebrulee** (10): that chorus is such an earworm WOW

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song feels so ALIVE! Ugh so good

**NFLfreak98** (10): Wait what are we putting on our biscuits? Eh, song sounds great so I‚Äôll go with
it

**ReallyCreative** (10): when the drums and horns come in and Jill is just belting, a religious
moment I fear

**Roxieloxie** (10): I think it was fall 2019, I was in the car with my mom and this song came on
spotify and she threw her hands up and literally turned it up and just turned to me and basically said
the mom version of 'This song absolutely fucks I when I first heard this i was shook" and something
about hearing the horns in the car speakers just really elevate it. This was another one of my 11
contenders so im praying yall dont do it dirty

**seanderlust** (10): peppermint voice it's love meets brraaap excuse me...it's love....it's
love........BOB SHUT UP!!! its love....

**bbfan132** (9): This is probably the most shocking placement for me. I like the song quite a bit, but I was expecting it to either leave late day 2 or early day 3. Instead, it‚Äôs all the way at #8, which is a very pleasant surprise!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): So I‚Äôm fairly certain that this is our first time rating a Mary J Blige song, which is a little bit of an oversight considering she‚Äôs one of the queens of r&b, but fortunately her first outing ends well for her! I was a bit surprised that this one made it this high since it‚Äôs a fairly straightforward r&b song compared to the rest of the rate but I can‚Äôt deny that the two have fantastic chemistry and the melodies here are great.

#Currently love this bop!

**akanewasright** (10): Mary and Lauryn‚Äôs voices contrast so nicely, and the dark tone of the song
is pretty rad

**Benthetall1** (10): Fully bodied, high-octane collaboration between two of the most talented

**CarlieScion** (10): mary j blige should sing on every song ever

**ImADudeDuh** (10): is it just me or are they‚Äôre voices really similar? Like even with genius lyrics
in front of me, i still had trouble telling them apart on the 2nd verse

**ManofOranges** (10): The way that repeating piano riff sounds like a Windows XP sound effect.

**plastichaxan** (10): their joint slay...too powerful

**ReallyCreative** (10): the definition of a serve

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): so true

**Awkward\_King** (9): i just called this "a 10" in the listening party and i just want you all to know i
lied, i lied

**runaway3212** (9): Okay while rating this is the first time I hear Mary J Binge lol

**Stryxen** (8.9): this song is a Doo Et with Mary J Blige

**seanderlust** (8.7): this is a mary j blige fan account, yup yup

**oscarbrierley1** (8): it's a collab that should work and does

**bbfan132** (10): I originally wasn‚Äôt sure if I was going to include this in the rate, but Ghost and I decided that it would be best to add it. That was 100% the right decision - it might be one of the best live songs I‚Äôve heard in general. Her delivery is perfect here and it all comes together so well. I‚Äôm thrilled to see that this made it to the top 10.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Now this may be hard to believe but Erykah claims that [this entire song is actually a *freestyle*!](https://www.okayplayer.com/music/erykah-badu-tyrone-20th-anniversary-new-music.html) In a way that actually kinda makes sense because I don‚Äôt know how she could have recaptured this kind of raw energy in the studio, she is letting this guy *have it!* Despite this (somehow?) never charting anywhere on any of the Billboard charts it‚Äôs become one of her most recognizable hits, and earned itself a pretty good placement in the rate. On a more personal note, while I didn‚Äôt grow up with this music like many people did I actually have a special connection to this song because my name is ‚ÄúTai‚Äù and all throughout my life my father would periodically randomly say ‚Äúyou better CAAAALLLL Tyrone‚Äù to me and I had absolutely no context for it until I listened to this song for this very rate. So‚Ä¶ yeah!

#let me hear y‚Äôall make some noise

**joshually** (11): How does a live improv riff become a classic? Ask this artist

**akanewasright** (10): My jaw hit the floor several times. Part of that is how explicit this song is, in
more than one sense of the word. The album proper is pretty clean, language wise, and you can
easily miss a lot of lyrics for the grooves. To have such a lyrically focused, almost vulgar song at
the end of Erykah‚Äôs section is sort of jarring, but it‚Äôs absolutely brilliant.

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck men fuck tyrone

**Benthetall1** (10): I mean, on one hand I feel like this has an outsized piece of her place in public
memory because her entire career is full of brilliant pieces and a lot of people know her for this one
dumb freestyle. But man, what a moment, and its definitely hilarious.

**cremeebrulee** (10): this song is so funny omg im glad it got included

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): The audience reaction when she sings "I'm gettin' tired of your shit." is
beyond incredible lmao i am tired of it too!!!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok this sounded so fucking good. Wish I could‚Äôve watched this

**izeasklapaucius** (10): LMAOOOO i fucking love this. the interaction between Badu and the
audience, her stage presence, the live instrument. chef's kiss

**ManofOranges** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never
the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not
reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, call tyrone.

**oanis** (10): The fact she took the concepts and ideas from this song and turned it into an entire
album still blows my mind.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Her vocals live are incredible, I honestly prefer this over most of the main
album

**ReallyCreative** (10): iconic

**runaway3212** (10): The power of starting a song with 'I'm tired of your shit' ICONIC!

**Stryxen** (10): tag yourself i'm the audience

**noctilucentvibes** (9.5): love to scream along with the audience. also fuck this man

**mysario** (9.2): the song is alright but the crowd hyping it up hypes me up

**oscarbrierley1** (9): the studio/extended version is a ten tho

**skargardin** (9): this was excellent

**whizzer0** (9): Says a lot that she can have a track as strong as this and not even put it on the
album!

**abcd9muses** (8): sassy and smooth, seems to be a staple of Neo-Soul and Erykah Badu
delivers every time

**frogaranaman** (8): - live

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): idk who this man is be she ended him live

**CarlieScion** (7): this is sweet

#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35vPKGxhi10

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): I would like this song more if it wasn't a live mix

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this song is a bop but i‚Äôm one of those annoying people who doesn‚Äôt
like live recordings where you can hear the audience screaming so i had to dock some points lol

**bbfan132** (10): I first heard this several years ago and instantly fell in love with it. The trip hop-esque beat drew me in and the repetitive nature of it kept me coming back to listen to it again and again. Something about this song just works so well, and it‚Äôs kind of hard for me to describe. I thought this was going to be Erykah‚Äôs highest placing song, but surprising, it‚Äôs out at #6‚Ä¶

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): ‚ÄúOn & On‚Äù is a Grammy winning song and one of Erykah‚Äôs biggest/most recognizable hits, so it seems natural that it would be one of her highest placing songs in the rate. A pensive track which sees Erykah espousing her personal views on life, it‚Äôs the perfect encapsulation of Erykah‚Äôs earthy-yet-ethereal brand. The lyrics are peppered with references to philosophy, religion, astrology, and [‚Äúthe teachings of the Nation of Gods and Earths‚Äù](https://genius.com/Nation-of-gods-and-earths-supreme-mathematics-annotated) and while many of the specific cultural references in the song are esoteric now, her gift for lyrical poetry has ensured that the song itself reminded relevant.

#On and On

**frogaranaman** (11): classic

**Awkward\_King** (10): miss badu said UwUwuWUwuWUuwuWUuw

**Benthetall1** (10): A classic. Man this percussion is still among my favorites in any song I‚Äôve
heard. Also, being the center of the Baduniverse almost is enough to make it my 11, but not quite.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): This song is definitely my favorite on Baduizm and my big takeaway from
this rate. I love just how powerful Erykah sounds. "If we were made in his image, then call us by our
names/ Most intellects do not believe in God but they fear us just the same" especially stuck with
me.

**CarlieScion** (10): iconnery

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): massive bop

**MrSwearword** (10): there's a noticeable difference in album and video delivery, but the song
knocks either way.

**oanis** (10): CERTIFIED CLASSIC. I love a good existential neo-soul song. Incredible to hear
live.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): You ever hear anything and your life changes? First time I heard this album,
just off this song, I just knew. God loved me enough to make be Black and I was never going to
take it for granted. It's sexy, it's cool, it's funky, it's smooth, it's a cultural moment and
understanding.

**Roxieloxie** (10): What a day indeed

**skargardin** (10): such a smash

**TiltControls** (10): Another potential 11 (I'm pretty sure there's been like 5 or 6 in this rate
already)

**akanewasright** (9.5): I really like how laid back Erykah‚Äôs vibe is. What an immaculate bassline,
too

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Love how simultaneously funky, jazzy and sultry this is.

**cremeebrulee** (9): wow i really love her voice

**ManofOranges** (9): I can dig it.

**runaway3212** (9): On & On starts to sound a lot like No & No after a while

#Off and Off

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): Kelela outsold

**whizzer0** (7): "Tunnel Vision" by Rina Sawayama samples this melody, right?

**abcd9muses** (6): I like it but it‚Äôs not something I would replay after this rate

**bbfan132** (9.5): The way the song builds on itself is enchanting, honestly. I love the spoken word section as well. This kept on moving around the top 10, but settled at #5, which seems like a good fit for it.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): When listing off the influences for the sound of this album Jill will often mention ‚Äúopera,‚Äù and I think the influence is clearest here. While a lot of this album leans more onto her skills as a poet, she flexes her abilities as a crooner here; there‚Äôs definitely a gentleness to this track, try singing along with it and you‚Äôll realize just how tricky what she‚Äôs doing with her voice here is! She lists off the ways that her husband loves her with incredible reverence, and while the marriage that inspired the track has faded away this marvelous tune lives on.

**waluigiest** (10): this groove is incredibly clean

**abcd9muses** (9): Her singing and emoting invokes such vivid visuals

**cremeebrulee** (9): i adore the production on this

**skargardin** (9): i love the spoken word part over the strins wheww

**oanis** (8.5): I wanna sample this. It's perfect.

**bbfan132** (10): When I first heard this, I instantly fell in love with it. That chorus is so infectious, and I love how the song keeps building and building. It‚Äôs easily my favorite song on the album, and it was a contender for my 11. This definitely deserved to be Jill‚Äôs top song, and I kind of wish it placed even higher! Still, #4 is a great placement and it has been in the top 5 for nearly the entire time, so I‚Äôm pleased with the result.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Jill was my little engine that could this rate, I wanted so badly for her to succeed and for a while there she was actually  might be exiting the rate early but up against two titans that‚Äôs nothing to be ashamed of! Her highest placing song is, fittingly enough, one of her most popular, and one that seems to call up some memories for some people! Jill just sounds like the coolest girl on the block on this one, she spits the lyrics almost as if she‚Äôs thinking them up as she says them. It‚Äôs a real riptide of a song, you don‚Äôt realize it‚Äôs swept you up until you‚Äôre already drifting away in the ocean of Jill‚Äôs soul‚Ä¶ now if she could explain why she made the music video private right before the reveal that would be great.

---

#The song is here, you‚Äôre pleased, you really dig its company

**fadedblue09** (11): Miss Jill is definitely a master in making s*x-themed songs sound so classy.

**cremeebrulee** (10): the key change >>>

**hhiggy** (10): really not liking the fact this is my first time hearing this

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Honestly, this is the 2nd best song in the rate. Like this is perfect vibing
music. I want to go on a walk around the park right now so fucking badly UGH!

**izeasklapaucius** (10): love her strong delivery in this one <3

**joshually** (10): I feel like she‚Äôs holding my arm as we walk together

**ManofOranges** (10): I could go for a long walk listening to this song.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): this is amazing

**MrSwearword** (10): even with me being scatterbrained doing this rate, this song is really good. I
remember hearing this song for the first time in one of those R&B albums to order over the phone
[Slow Jamz level shit] but if I recall correctly, the video has the pigeon flying to cover the back of
her hair because the label or director hated looking at it. Some shit like that but this song is so
fucking good.

**NFLfreak98** (10): Ugh the way her flow and the bassline work together elevates this so much

**oanis** (10): CLASSIC. This and It's Love were the ones for me growing up yessssss. Deadass
was taking notes as a kid like okay these are what dates are noted yes Auntie Jill I hear you. It's
here where you hear that poetry just flowing from her effortlessly. When she's riffing "maybe we
could..." and lists everything it sounds like a leaf that's falling from a tree at the park she's talking
about taking a long walk around. I don't know it's just such a perfect placing of words and emphasis
and timing. Incredible.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): I hear this song and I start smelling fabuloso. I get the itch to clean something
and open a window. My mama used to throw this type of music on to clean every Saturday, but this
song in particular makes me think of mopping floors and burning candles.

**ReallyCreative** (10): these vocals are everything omg

**runaway3212** (10): This buildup!!!!!

**Stryxen** (10): seeing a movie? In the middle of a pangea?

**waluigiest** (10): I literally cannot stop listening this this

**abcd9muses** (9): This song was unpredictable in a good way, very much the essence of jazz!

**akanewasright** (9): This is just so... lush...

**Benthetall1** (9): This is much more like it, love her flow on this one.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): Some of the instrumentation sounds kinda cheap (specifically the squeaky
synths(?)) but I still love this song for the vocals when she takes it up the register.

**CarlieScion** (9): that opening line tho

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I love the rhyming schemes in the chorus

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i love the saxophones on this but imma be honest i'm not listening to a
word she is saying

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (8): I love how this song just shows how smitten she is because you
have her saying maybe we can talk about the apocalypse in the Bible or just go to movies.

bbfan132: # Jill Scott - Who Is Jill Scott? Words and Sounds Vol. 1

---

**Overall Average**: 7.832 **// Average Controversy:** 1.414

---

 A major goal with this rate in particular was to expose people to new music and broaden the horizons of the participants and we got a lot of comments from people saying how much they enjoyed this project, which makes me very happy. Jill Scott is an artist I was completely unfamiliar with prior to this rate and I just assumed that she was gonna get slaughtered but after the first listen of her album she actually became my favorite! I love her sound and her energy, it feels like her music is something I‚Äôve been dancing around my whole life and I‚Äôm glad I finally found her.

---
**MoonlightByWindow** (9.017): what an amazing album ugh

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.000): This album is rather subdued so I had trouble rating it properly.

**fadedblue09** (8.833): First of all, can we talk about how perfect the album title is? "Who Is Jill Scott" is such a perfect title because listening to this album felt like a journey to knowing a person and everything about her (her social background, her view on love, etc.). And ‚ÄúWords and Sounds‚Äù is equally apt because those 2 things are the exact building blocks of this album. I‚Äôve always took the spoken word genre for granted, and this album changed my opinion on that. I‚Äôm normally turned off by s*x as a theme in music, but the instrumentals Miss Jill‚Äôs songwriting somehow makes it work. I feel truly blessed to have heard this.

**TiltControls** (8.806): Another album where almost every song is an 10 or 11. Only brought down since the interludes are hard to give a proper rating to with so many other good songs in the rate. Still a fantastic album through and through

**waluigiest** (8.444): I must confess I did not know who Jill Scott was before this rate. But this album was a masterpiece to me. The way she blended spoken word with the most joyous grooves and sensuality and clever writing - it‚Äôs an incredible, incredible piece of art.

**seanderlust** (8.433): This album was new to me but I really liked it! It's my lowest album average but that's only because I gave a zero to one of the tracks. The rest of the album is solid and enjoyable. From what i've read, it sounds like Jill was a poet before she was a songwriter and that entirely reads through this album - she has a way of description that almost activates the senses with how vivid they are.

**pat-rickstar** (8.328): Well, I'd never heard of Jill Scott before this rate but I certainly know who she is now! This is great, I can see myself listening to it again in future a lot while doing work - it makes great background music which I mean in the best way possible, it's smooth, lush and not too distracting, while still being an engaging listen.

**flavasavavandal** (8.306): So, I guess this is my favourite album by a thicker than expected margin, but Jill Scott had the almost consistent excellence, the three long run of He Loves Me to The Way is chefs kiss. It‚Äôs also just the one I found the most engagement in, Lauryn Hill might have had a cool concept and Erykah has the best voice but Jill Scott doesn‚Äôt promote Christianity as much, has as sensual with a cool swagger, and just brought better tunes. Lauryn and Erykah laid the ground, Jill refined it, and this will probably stay on rotation after submitting these scores. Excellent album!

**timothy444** (8.278): Jill Scott's debut album blends '60s soul, R&B, and jazz influences with the modern slant of 2000s hip-hop. It's this kind of musical delivery that is shared by many artists around the globe today.

**Question4TheCulture** (8.183): I didn't know of this album before this rate, and I was definitely missing out!

**oanis** (8.128): I am ready to settle into this feeling Auntie Jill. Really such a good debut from her.

**whizzer0** (8.111): I think I actually ended up liking this one the most. It's a little long but pretty consistent throughout (not that I've disliked any track in this rate), and not doing anything too out-there sound-wise seems to have let her focus on refining these tracks to smoothness. I will definitely be coming back to find out more about Jill Scott.

**Benthetall1** (8.111): I wasn‚Äôt familiar with the album before this rate, so I am not surprised to have comparatively mixed feelings. I like some moments a lot, and it gets better as the album progresses, but not every track needed to be on here. It was going to be an uphill battle for Scott to beat two of my favorite albums ever, so I will cut her some slack and hope the album grows on me with time.

**Stryxen** (8.078): I didn‚Äôt know there was good music made in the year 2000

**vayyiqra** (8.000): Not exaggerating, I have been wanting to check out this album for literally two whole decades. In elementary school I had a really cool teacher who talked about music a lot and brought up this album as an example of a really good, critically acclaimed artist who wasn't as popular as she should be because of racism and white beauty standards at the time. This album sounded so interesting, but it wasn't easy to track down albums and hear them back then (this was when even music downloading was new). I never quite forgot about it though and am happy to say I loved this album and plan on listening to a lot more of her music from now on.

**celladonn** (8.000): Pretty consistent project, I feel like there's fewer standout tracks than on the others but I'm glad I now know who Jill Scott is

**SmileAndTears** (6.806): I have to stan solely because of the sheer amount of horniness

**Brendon-Urine** (5.972): This is pretty solidly my least favorite of the three, mostly because it's so long. Miseducation might be a good bit longer, but it didn't get stale for me towards the end like Jill's. Still some great songs and beautiful vocal performances.

**CreepyMannequin** (5.889): I didn‚Äôt connect with this album as much as the other two, but I‚Äôm pleasantly surprised by how well it holds up! I had this image of Jill Scott as a very of-the-time artist but this stands the test of time.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): While I gave this song a ten, I‚Äôm genuinely shocked that it made it this far because I didn‚Äôt realize it was such a fan favorite? I assumed that ‚ÄúOn & On‚Äù would be Erykah‚Äôs highest ranking song and for a while there it was, but in the final day of receiving ballots this jumped ahead of it (and Jill as well). The flow and melody of this song are so pleasant and memorable and I think it‚Äôs a perfect encapsulation of Erykah as an artist in a different way than ‚ÄúOn & On‚Äù is: Erykah is a wild child with a lot of strange ideas and like the song says, you can either take her or leave her. I know I‚Äôll definitely be checking out more of her music after this rate though!

**bbfan132** (9): So this is Erykah‚Äôs top song, and I‚Äôm kind of surprised! It was below A Long Walk for a large portion of the time, but enough people liked it to the point where it made it all the way to the top 3. Unfortunately, it couldn‚Äôt beat the two classic Lauryn songs. I like the upbeat nature of this song and the lyrics are very fun, but it doesn‚Äôt go all the way for me personally. I‚Äôm happy to see it here, though!

---

#Got down with Erykah, picked from her apple tree

**Awkward\_King** (11): appletree appletree im sorry i dont have any actual comment on the song
its just a good song let me live

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): Love at first listen.

**Stryxen** (11): einstein who? Erykah Badu invented gravity

**whizzer0** (11): This is the one that always gets stuck in my head. Love the storytelling here, and
it's a bop for sure.

**akanewasright** (10): Thats... quite the pretentious intro. She‚Äôs lucky the rest of the song slaps,
because I was willing to give a low score after that.

**Benthetall1** (10): Honestly maybe even a better song than On & On.

**cremeebrulee** (10): love the chorus on this one

**fadedblue09** (10): Really really catchy with a fun lyrical symbolism. A potential 11 here.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended Johnny Fadppleseed

**ManofOranges** (10): I was sucked in as soon as Erykah said "not edible food, but food for
thought" because that gave me a good laugh. But it's also got a pretty good groove to it. Rest
assured I do wanna pick from Erykah's appletree.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): groovy

**ReallyCreative** (10): orchards could never

**Roxieloxie** (10): Artist friends, uwuwuwuwu

**runaway3212** (10): I can't believe before Erykah Badu came along gays didn't have any food for
thought

**TiltControls** (10): I love how a little bit of On & On spills into the song.

**waluigiest** (10): the wordplay and energy on this one are so tight

**oanis** (9.7): Love when she ties her songs together.

**seanderlust** (9.3): a song about apple trees? erykah said washington state rights!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (9): The intro, and the sound of the rest of this song (and the album as a

whole really, but this song in particular) makes me feel like I've been transported to a hole-in-the-
wall Jazz Bar

**skargardin** (8): I like the way the On & On "my cypher.." line is present here as well

#PC Users

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): The intro is cringe but the song makes up for it mostly, not completely
though

**MrSwearword** (7): the beat is sick enough to make up for the "food for thought fills you up"
pretentious ass sentiment [Erykah is weird I know but bad songwriting/sentimentality must be read]

**abcd9muses** (6.5): I think this song is also really interesting when thinking about the genre Neo-
soul as a whole. It‚Äôs just not a song I would replay, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs not a 7 imo

bbfan132: # Erykah Badu - Baduizm

---

**Overall Average**: 7.951 **// Average Controversy:** 1.340

---

 I‚Äôm fairly certain that the reason I was asked to co-host this particular rate is because shortly before the rate cycle was decided I talked about listening to *Baduizm* during one of my weekly 5x5s writeups in the Daily Discussion threads, which meant I was one of the few people on the sub who was publicly expressing opinions on Erykah Badu. I won‚Äôt lie and say that I‚Äôm a huge fan or anything like that but I‚Äôm glad that I got the opportunity to cohost this rate because the more I listen to Erykah the more I like her, she just seems like a fascinating person and artist and I know I‚Äôm going to be listening to more of her music after this.

---
**Benthetall1** (9.031): There is literally never a bad time to listen to Baduizm. I think she gets more brilliant later in her career but is never as focused and broadly appealing as she is here. But, as her music always is, the album is funny, warm, stylized and totally elevated. I encourage anyone hearing it for the first time to keep exploring her discography, it‚Äôs a rewarding one.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.813): Was expecting to love it way more based off of the first few tracks. Still a wonderful listen!

**oanis** (8.731): I know that this was The Album for my mom. She was playing this all the time and this came out 3 days before I was born so she likes to joke that she trained me young.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.706): i‚Äôve never heard this album before and it‚Äôs certainly (ha) a great discovery

**runaway3212** (8.656): I think this is my least favourite but I still love it

**seanderlust** (8.500): Erykah Badu is a lyrical genius and is a powerhouse of her generation of songwriters. That said, of these three albums, I would argue that while it's still good, Baduizm's sound has aged the poorest. There are moments for me where the album fades into the background a bit. I get that it has cultural context, but for new fans who are trying to get into Badu I'm not convinced this would be a good starting point. I mean, all that said my album average is still around 8.4 so I did enjoy it.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.481): I really like this album so theres a lot of high scores

**Stryxen** (8.469): This album feels like rain

**fadedblue09** (8.469): So blessed to have finally listened to queen of neo-soul herself! I feel like this album is the most accessible out of the 3 and fits the definition of 'neo-soul' the most. In terms of sound, I think this is my favorite. Its excellent melding of various sounds while showcasing her gorgeous voice made this an easy but engaging listen. Personally I'd say it falls short in the songwriting (not because it's bad, but because it's because it's up against 2 lyric-heavy works).

**waluigiest** (8.313): My intro to Erykah Badu was her Tiny Desk from ~2 years ago. Her performance of Green Eyes was quite literally life changing. While she doesn‚Äôt reach that impossible peak that Green Eyes set, this is a solid album.

**pat-rickstar** (8.219): I don't quite enjoy this album as much as the other two, although looking at my album averages it's not as much of a gap as I thought it would be. Basically, a lot of the songs are in the 7-8.5 range for me, where they sound good but don't go that extra mile to make them really stick out. Tyrone is awesome though, loved that one in particular.

**whizzer0** (8.188): This one I've listened to before but this was a good opportunity to go through it properly. On a technical level it feels a little more dated than the others? I find her vocals get a bit lost sometimes, which is a shame because her performance and lyricism is great. I originally picked it up because a few of my modern-day faves have cited her as an influence and you can definitely hear how this album has set the scene for sounds through the 00s to today.

**ManofOranges** (8.063): I was expecting Lauryn Hill's album to be my favorite of the rate, but honestly this is without a doubt my favorite after listening. All of Erykah's songs are just so smooth and so... enthralling.

**celladonn** (8.063): her voice is so unique and expresses so much personality! The jazzier elements make this album the least immediate and accessible to me, but it's Good

**Question4TheCulture** (7.831): A really great album. The songs all kind of blend together, which both a pro and a con. Stellar lyricism!

**Brendon-Urine** (7.813): I had only heard of Erykah Badu before, never listened. This was definitely a pleasent listen, I do really like her voice. The instrumentation is probably my favorite part, but also some of the lyrics just exude power, like on On & On. I'm excited to keep listening to this and get to know it more.

**TiltControls** (7.813): Some of the songs maybe could have been cut down a minute or two, but otherwise it's a great piece of work.

**flavasavavandal** (7.594): Better than expected, probably the second best album in the rate despite a lower average of the albums tracks than Miseducation, but Erykah just owns the microphone and I gotta respect that.

**vayyiqra** (7.188): The artist in this rate I know the least about, this album was a great experience and enjoyable throughout. I wanted to write a lot more about the albums and songs in this rate like my habit is, but they're all so long and complex it was daunting, so I'll just say I'm glad I gave this album a chance after knowing of her for a long time but never listening.This is a really colourful and interesting album that blends together a lot of sounds and influences very well.

**CreepyMannequin** (6.906): Absolutely incredible.

**SmileAndTears** (6.625): I‚Äôm gonna be honest I found this album really boring. It wasn‚Äôt bad, but I found it really uninteresting sonically, hence why I didn‚Äôt write many comments for the songs

**timothy444** (6.594): While Baduzism has its amazingly smooth song transitions and soulful R&B infused in its songs, it also felt boring and repetitive at times. The album unfortunately overstays its welcome a little too much.

**bbfan132** (11): This was *so* close to winning, and if Ricki submitted his scores, it would‚Äôve won‚Ä¶. It‚Äôs an undeniable classic that has been sampled countless times, and I was one of many who gave it an 11 in this rate. The top 2 are far apart from the rest of the songs, and while I love a lot of the earlier cuts just as much as these two, it was the predictable result of a rate as strong as this one.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Oh boy. Throughout the scoring process there were a few songs that occupied the top spot at various points, but once we got more than a handful of ballots in it became clear that the rate would end in a dog fight between ‚ÄúEx-Factor‚Äù and ‚ÄúDoo-Wop.‚Äù While no other song ever really came close to beating these two, they‚Äôre incredibly close to each other (seriously, check their averages) and the two were trading spots up until the very last scores came in. Ultimately ‚ÄúEx-Factor‚Äù ended up losing by a hair, which is a shame because it was my pick to win. I‚Äôve lived a fairly uneventful life but I‚Äôve had the good fortune to have my heart broken, and this song just cuts right to the core of those feelings. The shamelessness of the lyrics, the yearning in Lauryn‚Äôs voice, the gorgeous (iconic) melody, this is just legendary and transcendent in ways I can‚Äôt even begin to describe.

---

#No one loves this song more than you

**hhiggy** (11): literally one of the greatest songs ever made

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): this song is SOOOO GOOD

**NFLfreak98** (11): Probably the closest thing to a banger in this rate and I‚Äôm here for it

**ReallyCreative** (11): the vocal harmonies are made of PURE serotonin

**Benthetall1** (10): Ugh, so brilliant.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (10): OMG this sounds SO GOOD FUCK. THE GUITAR AT THE END!!!!
Also https://i.pinimg.com/736x/39/01/ae/3901ae5492ff609b43bd2b7e4bbc69ad.jpg

**joshually** (10): that bridge at the end haunts me to this day

**ManofOranges** (10): How can I... not give this a 10? It's a hit, plain and simple. That final part of
the song especially, with the "care for me, cry for me, give to me" refrain, it's just so good.

**MrSwearword** (10): "you said you'd die for me/why won't you live for me" alone warrants the
score but goddamn this song just fucks me up sometimes.

**oanis** (10): listening to this song always teleports me back to long drives back home after school
with my Mom as I looked wistfully out the window haha. As I get older this song hits more and
more.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): for all of the ways that this song has been sampled, rearranged, covered, etc
over the years, the original is always going to be the greatest. It's such a soft, loving but still like
yearning and lonely. Her voice is just so angelic against that piano.

**Roxieloxie** (10): not to mention **** ** **** but i've always been very clear that, that is my favorite
***** song because of the ***** because I really love the original. This is one of those 'songs i love
but didnt know the name of' which is something that comes up alot in this rate tbt

**seanderlust** (10): one of the absolute all-time best rocky relationship songs. as i'm writing this i
don't know which track i'll give my 11 but this is for sure a frontrunner

**Stryxen** (10): no need to explain bestie x

**waluigiest** (10): the vocals and harmonies are gorgeous, and the whole track just feels magical

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): That guitar solo at the end SLAPS

**skargardin** (9): the breakdown is so good

**fadedblue09** (8.5): For some reason this doesn‚Äôt really resonate with me as it should, also it‚Äôs
too repetitive. Very fine vocal performance though.

**abcd9muses** (8): that voice though, actually this song is a grower, it felt lukewarm, but it really
shines with the buildup

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (8): I love the emphasis of certain word like care, there, cry and more of
the back up singers. The guitar at 4:40 is beautiful.

#Nice For What references (also no one mentioned ‚ÄúBe Careful‚Äù)

**1998tweety** (11): I love Nice For What

**cremeebrulee** (11): this managed to steal what i thought would be an easy 11 to doo wop... but
unlike doo wop this seems to just get better with each listen. honestly, i kept procrastinating on this
rate bc i would just start listening this again haha. i could listen to her sing ‚Äúi keep letting you back
innnn‚Äù forever (shout out to drake for sampling this bc nice for what is also a 10)

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I never heard this until Drake sampled it in Nice for What but it‚Äôs an
amazing song

**vayyiqra** (11): Of course the part that Drake sampled is the best part of the song and one of the
best parts of the whole album. It's not even worth trying to put into words here, it's just really
emotional and touching.

**celladonn** (10): How is it just now clicking for me that Nice For What sampled this... let me go
grab my clown makeup

**ImADudeDuh** (10): broke - ‚ÄúI know this song from Nice For What‚Äù woke - ‚ÄúI know this song from
the mashup of this with Demi Lovato - Body Say‚Äù

**runaway3212** (10): I never got this song until Nice For What but now I love it so much

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): The rest of the song is nice but I particularly love the outro - the bit that Drake
sampled on Nice For What is so good

**CarlieScion** (9): okay not to be That Girl but yes i did first hear this song in Nice For What by
Drake

**flavasavavandal** (9): I mean I think Nice For What is better but like, it‚Äôs still amazing

**SmileAndTears** (8): Oh so THAT‚Äôs the song Drake sampled

**bbfan132** (10): Well, here we are‚Ä¶.. if /u/rickikardashian sent in his scores, this would‚Äôve lost by 2 or 3 points to Ex Factor. It wasn‚Äôt really close between the top 2 and the other songs, but this kept on switching places with Ex Factor. However, this was usually in the top spot, and by the end, it narrowly won. Some of the lyrics have aged poorly (to say the least‚Ä¶), but the song is a classic and a fitting winner for this rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): ‚ÄúDoo Wop (That Thing)‚Äù was basically called as the winner from the moment this rate was announced, and it manages to fulfill the prophecy by an incredibly narrow ***0.3 points.*** Sometimes the obvious choice is the correct one though, I don‚Äôt need to explain why this is good. The lyrics might have aged a bit (which is why I bumped the score down a bit and apparently some of y‚Äôall agreed) but no one can deny that this song broke barriers musically and in the industry, and it‚Äôs a worthy entry to the pantheon of rate winners.

---

#That thing (an 11)

**Benthetall1** (11): Obviously. This is on the short list of best songs of all time. Plenty of great
songs on this rate, but I‚Äôm not sure any other song truly captures what is special about Lauryn Hill
as an artist and supertalent.

**CarlieScion** (11): i am only gonna give songs covered on glee my 11s from now on

**flavasavavandal** (11): I mean, it‚Äôs got that thing that makes me want to give it my 11

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this being a #1 hit is so shocking honestly

**JunkyGS** (11): classic and should win but I feel like it might get sabotaged.... üëÄ

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): There's a reason this song was a number one hit

**ManofOranges** (11): Is this the most upbeat song in this whole rate? It just might be. Whatever
the case is, I have fun every single time I listen to it. I wish it were longer, honestly. Maybe it's also
a bit of a basic 11 choice but to me it's a no brainer. There's no other choice (well, except for
tyrone).

**MrSwearword** (11): you are not defeating one of the best songs in the history of recorded music.

**mysario** (11): an absolute classic, perfect representation of Lauryn Hill at her best

**pat-rickstar** (11): This is quite an obvious 11 choice as it's probably the most well-known song in
the rate. And if you ask me it's also the best, so I think this has a pretty good chance of winning.

**plastichaxan** (11): this is just a classic, the only song i knew from the rate beforehand and it was
enough to get me to do the entire thing just to rate it

**runaway3212** (11): Just as fresh today as 20 years ago

**skargardin** (11): a song that actually can justify the "one of the greatest songs ever recorded"
comment

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): Some guys are only about that thing

**TiltControls** (11): The power of this song!!! I realize this is a basic choice for an 11, but it's also a
deserved one

#That thing (not an 11 but still a good score)

**Awkward\_King** (10): basic but it's just a 10 isn't it

**celladonn** (10): classique

**cremeebrulee** (10): i mean, it‚Äôs a classic, it‚Äôs a bop, etc. its the only song i was really familiar
with before this rate but i ended up given my 11 to another song here because some of these lyrics
havent aged the best haha. it‚Äôs still a 10 and i wouldn‚Äôt mind if this won!

**frogaranaman** (10): god that beat.. ridiculously influential

**hhiggy** (10): bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic, ended men

**oanis** (10): First song I learned how to play on the piano. Love how she's like y'all look out there
are some trifling ass people out there be careful. Thank you Auntie Lauryn for the warning!!! If you
did then then you'll probably f*** again üëÄ

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): We are ignoring the lyrics. It's hotep foolishness, and we are choosing to
ignore it. Because the production on this song is immaculate. I don't know what came over the
people who made this song, but it's dangerous. This song is just so brilliantly and carefully made.

**ReallyCreative** (10): instantly recognizable, iconic, (lyrically questionable in today's context at a
couple points), this is a statement piece of art

**Stryxen** (10): i first heard this song from the pitch perfect 2 riff-off it‚Äôs true, anyway the whole
song just builds on itself and I LOVE how it ends up coming together

**vayyiqra** (10): I technically should give this my 11 since it's such a classic and a bop and is the
song I've listened to the most by her, but that seems so predictable and ~basic I think I'll give it to
Ex-Factor instead. Still a great song though

**NFLfreak98** (9.7): These horns just sound classic

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.3): some of these lyrics kinda aged badly but i forgive it all when that
hook comes in

**seanderlust** (9.3): this song does not get a ten because some of the lyrics...did not age so well,

but god the vibes are irreplacable

**fadedblue09** (9): Some of the lyrics and the message are quite of its time, but the production is
just so iconic.

**waluigiest** (9): more like Doo Bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): This is a bop and iconic but wow the lyrics feel kinda dated.

**abcd9muses** (8): I had difficulties rating this song because it‚Äôs a classic. I didn‚Äôt want its
legendary status to influence my rate, but it‚Äôs hard to avoid because it‚Äôs legendary BECAUSE it‚Äôs a
great song, period. However, it doesn't get a higher score, partly because I'm no longer that
attached to it.

**oscarbrierley1** (7): not as preachy as I remembered and really catchy

bbfan132: # Lauryn Hill - The Miseducation Of Lauryn Hill

---

**Overall Average**: 8.425 **// Average Controversy:** 1.333

---

 Now, as a theatre boy I grew up very ignorant of the world of music but when I first started getting into pop I had the good sense to put this album on my ‚Äúto-listen‚Äù list so I was familiar with this project going into the rate, but revisiting it has given me a new appreciation for it. It‚Äôs no wonder this album became legendary, I think even people who have listened to this album every day since it came out are still finding new things to appreciate about it. Lauryn Hill‚Äôs career is one of the biggest ‚Äúwhat-ifs‚Äù in the music industry, I want to live in the world where she got her life together and continued releasing music after this album because I‚Äôm sure that‚Äôs a great place. [Also for those interested, check out this article that Rolling Stone did that‚Äôs an oral history of the album](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/inside-the-miseducation-of-lauryn-hill-252219/) because there‚Äôs a lot of fun tidbits in there.

---
**MoonlightByWindow** (9.600): one of my all-time favourite albums, just a masterpiece

**Benthetall1** (9.300): I‚Äôve listened to this album countless times so its not something I can listen to with fresh ears. That being said, it‚Äôs a classic, and feels like a blueprint for what popular music would aspire to for a whole generation.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9.133): I'm glad I've finally listened to this.

**TiltControls** (9.033): I don't know how to rate an album where every song is a 10

**seanderlust** (8.953): This was the album that I had to slightly underrate to be fair to the other two albums. The other two are great, but this is a no-skip album for me. Every single track (yes, even the ones I gave a 7) is brilliant. There's a reason Lauryn gets so much praise- because her album slaps and defies age.

**noctilucentvibes** (8.933): i'm obsessed with the skits.

**Stryxen** (8.933): I had high expectations for this album, so many people i follow say this is the best hip hop album of all time and yeah. I was not disappointed.

**celladonn** (8.833): My favourite of these albums, predictably because I was already familiar with it and because it's the most poppy and immediate. This album is absolutely iconic and so influential, it's a shame her career afterwards has been so sporadic but I stan

**pat-rickstar** (8.687): Wow. I can definitely see why this is considered such a classic album, and I'm glad I finally listened to it. Lauryn's influence can be heard all over some of my favourite artists of today, so it makes sense I would enjoy this. Rooting for something from this to win!

**waluigiest** (8.667): It‚Äôs a classic for a reason, but it‚Äôs hard to rate. It feels like the sum is greater than the parts, and rating each individual song doesn‚Äôt quite do it justice.

**Question4TheCulture** (8.493): Full of bops (except for Superstar). Good lyricism. Iconic in the truest sense of the word.

**runaway3212** (8.400): This is an incredible album that I always enjoy

**Brendon-Urine** (8.300): This is the album I knew the best before coming in but I had to give a better listen to the second half for this. There are some meh songs for me, but she really just sprinkled in these masterpieces. Her singing voice is spectacular.

**whizzer0** (8.200): This is the one I've heard the most hype about and it feels difficult to judge it on one listen. It's more diverse than the other two and Ms. Hill definitely stands out for being able to pull off a variety of styles so well.

**oanis** (8.173): Honestly I've never listened to this in full, just the songs that played on the local R&B station so this has been a great experience! Hearing the excerpts from the kids is so profound and makes me wish I had those types of conversations in a setting like that around my peers back in middle/high school instead of years later in college.

**fadedblue09** (7.933): The most popular album in this rate, and after listening to it, I can see why it holds a huge cultural significance. Many songs here are rooted in a deeper social context. Though I have to admit: I enjoyed this album the least out of the 3, and I'd be lying if I said the album didn't bore me at times. Maybe because some songs were too long to hold my attention, or maybe because the more hip hop-heavy tracks blow everything else out of the water (rapper Lauryn >>> singer Lauryn btw). Regardless, I cannot deny its classic status.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.820): wow this was so good

**vayyiqra** (7.800): The only album in this rate I've heard before a lot, I've known of it since I was a kid and was fascinated by how it showed a whole different way of looking at the world than I knew. (I grew up in an extremely white suburban town.) This album is one of the few I think can be called timeless.

**SmileAndTears** (7.707): I like this album but it also quickly falls into the background for me. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs just the genre (honestly it might just be the genre, I‚Äôm not sure)

**flavasavavandal** (7.600): So despite a few low scores, I really enjoyed this album and Lauryn Hill has some intricate flows that help pace this album but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs the classic everybody hypes it as

**oscarbrierley1** (7.580): they need to put out a new version where the interludes are separate so they can be excluded

**timothy444** (7.533): I don't normally like R&B but Lauryn Hill's voice is distinctive and incredible! Also the lyrics are solid and the melodies are wonderful.

**CreepyMannequin** (7.200): this absolutely slapped

TiltControls: Congrats to Lauryn for claiming the top with 2 fantastic songs! Really any of the top 10 would have been worthy winners! Also great job to both u/bbfan132 and u/Ghost-Quartet for hosting such a great rate!!!

Some updates to the [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist!](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1863576184)

**Songs**

- Doo Wop doesn't land on the highest average top 20 leaderboard, but ends up with a solid 30th (out of 5323 songs)! And Ex-Factor is right behind it at #32!

- No doubt that this was a close finish. In fact, it was the closest point difference between ANY winner and 2nd placer with 0.3 separating the two in pure points! REMEMBER THAT EVERY BALLOT COUNTS! (Previous record holder was Niall's On the Loose over Harry's Kiwi by 0.5 points for those curious). 

- Ex-Factor joins [an exclusive list of 23 other songs](https://pastebin.com/KJ64aiUH) to never receive a score below 7 in a rate! Some consolation to the close loss

**Artists**

- Lauryn enters the top 20 average leaderboard with a stunning 8.425 average, giving her the #2 spot after Kate Bush! Better late the never eh? Erykah and Jill also have strong showings landing at #33/242 (7.950) and #47/242 (7.832)

- Lauryn Hill and Erykah Badu now top the list as the two least controversial artists we've rated! Though in real-life that may differ, I'm glad we could all recognize the quality of their music. Jill Scott lands solidly at 7th as well!

- Both Lauryn and Erykah join the list of artists to never receive a 0! In fact, Erykah sits at the top of that list having the most songs rated (16) without having a 0. (Misterwives and The Jonas Brothers were previously tied for 1st with 15, now Lauryn joins them tied for 2nd with 15 as well)

**Rates**

- The rate ends up with the 7th highest average among all rates (deserved) and 3rd lowest controversy score. Glad to see agreement that it was a really strong group of albums!

**Other things**

On the songlist I've updated the placement column to show the placement relative to the other songs in the rate to make it easier to see how lower placing songs did. Also slightly updated the look to make it easier to read.
