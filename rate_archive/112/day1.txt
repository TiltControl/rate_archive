**bbfan132** (7): Probably the least surprising first boot in recent memory… Jill’s vocals here are impeccable, and it’s a pleasant interlude, but in the end, it is just an interlude. When this is the lowest placing song in a rate though, you know that it’s a very strong rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I think we all knew an interlude was going out first and it doesn’t surprise me that it was this one since it’s really barely a song. For those looking for context, Jill Scott co-wrote and recorded vocals for a song called called “You Got Me” with legendary hip-hop group The Roots and while she was replaced by Erykah Badu because the label wanted a bigger name, she ended up accompanying The Roots on tour to perform it with them. This was when Jill was first getting started so she wasn’t very well known outside of her native Philadelphia, so they would introduce her during their shows like this. A cute little snapshot of history I suppose.

**ReallyCreative** (10): let's not be interludephobic

**bbfan132** (8): I really wish this placed a bit higher - it might be a short song, but it’s extremely pretty and Jill really sells the song. Then again, when you compare this to the rest of the album, it does kind of pale in comparison, so this placement is not too surprising.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Unsurprisingly another interlude, but I’m kinda surprised this one didn’t do better because it’s very pretty. Maybe the length worked against it?

---

#Better

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): :pensive:

**seanderlust** (9.2): this one is hard to rate, since it's clearly a segue to the next song. it's still v
pretty though

**akanewasright** (8.5): I’m really tired right now, and I feel like Jill is leading me into a 20 year
sleep with this song - IN A GOOD WAY, SLEEP IS NICE

**fadedblue09** (8.5): There's something about this that is just so soothing.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): short and sweet but not something I'm obsessed with

**abcd9muses** (8): I thought this was a part of the next song haha, that's how smooth it is

**runaway3212** (8): Could've been better but still great

**Benthetall1** (7.5): This is lovely, but too short to make much of an impression. Great transition
into the next song.

#Worse

**CarlieScion** (6): thank u Jill for understanding that my brain cant handle 6 minute plus long
songs and breaking them down

**cremeebrulee** (6): okay interlude, i feel bad that its low but i’m not that into it

**oanis** (6): Not much to say here it's nice.

**skargardin** (6): cute little interlude

**waluigiest** (6): it’s pretty, it just is all set up without a lot of satisfaction

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): I almost went back to sleep hearing this but it’s nice

**izeasklapaucius** (5): ok

**Awkward\_King** (3): i know this one is more of an interlude one so it's not that serious but i really
don't care for the instrumentals here. also "he's so sweet and good" ma'am what is this

**bbfan132** (7): I love the intro to this song, but in the end, it’s a too short for it to make much of an impact on me (especially when there is a longer version of this song on the album).

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Erykah does some freestyle bars over the instrumental for her song “Sometimes,” I’m not even sure why this is on the album but it’s short enough that it isn’t distracting. We could probably have cut this tbh

---

#short = okay

**runaway3212** (10): I don't really understand why this was included but it's good

**Benthetall1** (9): A short but iconic verse.

**seanderlust** (9): brief but fun. I want more tbh

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): Too Short!!!

**ManofOranges** (8): Ok but for an interlude this is a bop.

**MrSwearword** (8): cute interlude

**oanis** (8): super super fun interlude. I wanna sample that bit in the 
beginning with her vocals.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why is this not a full song UGH —- EDIT: nevermind I didn’t look at the
track list when I made this comment. Lol

**1998tweety** (7.5): It's short but bops so I'm conflicted

**abcd9muses** (7): short but sweet, doesn’t leave me wanting more surprisingly!

**akanewasright** (7): This is... shockingly short, but it is a bop

# short = bad >:(
**cremeebrulee** (7): it feels a lil incomplete
**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): I wish this was a full track, I can't give it that high of a score
considering it's only 44 seconds long, even though I really like it

**astrologicalangel** (6): would have rated this higher if it was a little longer

**CarlieScion** (5): no

**ImADudeDuh** (5): yup that was a minute long

**izeasklapaucius** (5): ok

**noctilucentvibes** (5): look it starts and then it's done

**skargardin** (5): I can't justify scoring is at high as the rest of the rate, even though it's not a bad
interlude at all

**vayyiqra** (5): Can't rate this too short

**oscarbrierley1** (4): idk it doesn't really offer anything the full length version does

#Because it’s 0:47 of ambient noise y’all

**fadedblue09** (8): We are really including this but not Lauryn's Intro? I 
smell a set-up /s

**pat-rickstar** (8): How come we're rating this but not the intro to Miseducation

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The first of Jill’s poetry driven tracks bites it and personally, I think y’all did this one a little dirty. The atmosphere here is gorgeous, the way the words just spill out of her really captures the feeling of what it’s like to anguish over how to communicate with someone you like and she manages to throw in a nice little curveball there at the end of the track. Also the transition from this into the next track is flawless but unfortunately we’re not rating that.

**bbfan132** (7.5): This is a sweet song to listen to, but it didn’t fully draw me in before it ended. I saw some people (looking at /u/mysario) say that the title/song made them cringe, but to me, it feels more uninteresting than anything else. This feels like the right placement for the song.

---

#Sweet tooth

**akanewasright** (9): I feel like every comment I make is something to the effect of “this is
ridiculously smooth”, but uh... it’s not gonna stop being true.

**runaway3212** (8.5): the outro is immaculate

**ImADudeDuh** (8): don’t get my hopes up like this, jill.

**waluigiest** (8): her faster segments are magical

**noctilucentvibes** (7.5): we trombone

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (7): as smooth as it’s title.

**skargardin** (7): cute but not a standout really

#On a diet

**Stryxen** (6.9): I feel like I’m interrupting something

**oanis** (6.8): Okay this sounds like an L Word interlude lmaoooo. Sister was going through some
thangs.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): not a huge fan of this one

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Ehh I can only take a certain degree of horniness in music.

**Benthetall1** (6): Docked points for imprecise geography, and just not really going anywhere.

**ignitethephoenix** (5.8): this is not it imo

**Awkward\_King** (4): okay I DONT HATE IT i just cannot for the life of me remember it after like
four listens i'm so sorry

**ManofOranges** (4): Not as much as a fan of this one, I hate to say it.

**mysario** (0): I really don't like the way she says the title

**bbfan132** (7): Once again, another short song has been cut. This intro is nothing too special, but I like the echo-y/reverb-y vocals from Jill and it is a pleasant introduction to the album. I’m a bit surprised that it’s above a few other interludes/songs, but that shows the strength of this rate!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): Jilltro is, naturally, a pun on Jill’s name and the word “cilantro,” and the song is a tender ode to her love of the leafy herb. I assumed because this song was front and center on Jill’s album that it would bear the brunt of the interludephobia and be the first song eliminated, but pleasantly this wasn’t the case! It still bites it pretty early though.

#Normal comments:
**timothy444** (11): this is the Closer (feat. Halsey) of this rate

**mysario** (10): almost an 11

**ReallyCreative** (10): this is going to get robbed because it's one of the best album intros I've
ever heard

**abcd9muses** (9): incredible, wow. This should be the standard for any intro track!

**fadedblue09** (9): Every artist should take a cue from this on how to make an album intro.

**akanewasright** (8): This is really cute

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Pretty intro.

**pat-rickstar** (8): This is actually really cool - but it's just an intro so I can't really justify giving it a
higher score

**oanis** (7.5): Give me background!! Also these keys....whew gorgeous.

**Benthetall1** (7): I find this the weakest of the intros in this rate. I’m not sure there’s anything in
this pastiche that isn’t simply better demonstrated by the actual songs.

**Brendon-Urine** (7): Love a good thematic intro track!

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (7): I think does a great job of interweaving the various concepts and the
different vocals it’s using for the high pitched love and man saying inspiración.

**seanderlust** (7): something about this reminds me of the drive up in the hollywood hills video
:sob:

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): I was worried this would just be spoken word with no music but I’m
pleasantly surprised

**izeasklapaucius** (5): ok now
#Comments that reference the title:
**CarlieScion** (10): NOT JILLTRO dsfknjsfdkjn

**runaway3212** (10): this gets a 10 for the title alone omfg it's so funny

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): Honestly, I kinda love this just because it's called Jilltro

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (9): Honestly.... This deserves the 11 just for the galaxy brain title

**waluigiest** (8): most of the points come from the iconic title, but thematically and musically this is
a perfect intro

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): jilltro is the dumbest fucking name i've ever heard i love it

**skargardin** (6): It does take nerve to have this as the title

**bbfan132** (9): I absolutely love this skit and wish it made it further, but alas, it was bound to be cut here. Erykah’s lyrics work perfectly here, and the sparse/light instrumentation also fits in very well here. That saxophone…. ugh.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Another track that was maybe somewhat robbed due to it being not really a song? A funny little skit that Erykah improvised in the studio, weirdly enough this track is featured at the start of the music video for “On & On” but it’s nowhere near that song on the tracklist so…? According to Genius this track is an affectionate tribute to the drummer of The Roots (oh hey those guys again) Questlove, who does in fact have a have an afro. Idk how I were him and someone dedicated a song about a deadbeat guy to me but hey, I’m not gonna argue with Erykah Badu.

#All of the comments for this one were pretty positive actually

**ReallyCreative** (10): iconic

**Roxieloxie** (10): She's so valid, I wish i fucking would go through the effort for me to cornrow my

**runaway3212** (10): her voice sounds so beautiful here

**waluigiest** (10): I feel directly called out by this

**seanderlust** (9.3): SCREAM

**CarlieScion** (9): this is nice and a length my brain can comprehend

**oanis** (9): She's so funny. Like what are you doing with a crooked afro bro?? I too would take
that pager back what the hell was this guy on lmao.

**akanewasright** (8.5): Yeah I actually love this. It’s just lovely.

**Awkward\_King** (8): omg erykah stop she's already dead

**Benthetall1** (8): “I KNOW THAT AIN’T MY TABLECLOTH SHE GOT ON!”

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Is this... spoken word jazz? I don't know what I'm talking about, but it's a
cute moment.

**MrSwearword** (8): something's high but it's not one side of an afro

**abcd9muses** (7): made me self-consciously check my hair lol

**astrologicalangel** (7): I thought this was going to be like a spoken skit and I'm kind of glad it
wasn't

**fadedblue09** (7): Is that a tuba I hear?

**skargardin** (7): it's a fun skit

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (6): I love the laugh in the beginning and the brass.

**ManofOranges** (6): You're just mad cause your hair is flat.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): Cute, but this is just a demo, and in a rate full of great tracks this ain't
cutting it

**bbfan132** (8.5): I think I’ve underrated this song in the past, which is understandable because of its length and overall sound. I’m not surprised to see it leaving this early, since it feels very repetitive/one-note for a 6 minute song, but I generally love this mellow sound. Her vocals sound beautiful here as well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is the first real song to be eliminated (I consider “Honey Molasses” an interlude since it’s mostly poetry) and I can’t say I’m surprised since it’s six minutes of Erykah opining on the state of the world, personally I think it’s pretty but it is a very tough sell. Fun fact: this song samples [“Pastime Paradise” by Stevie Wonder](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0S4SiLxt1s) and references some of the lyrics.

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): love this one

**Stryxen** (9): my favourite lyrically of the album and it’s so relaxing :)

**vayyiqra** (9): based

**Benthetall1** (8.5): A lovely, quiet moment as the album winds down.

**celladonn** (8.5): can't believe that 24 years later we're STILL living in this crazy world.....

**fadedblue09** (8.5): The album's "social consciousness" moment.

**CarlieScion** (8): go off

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8): This song is 6 minutes long, but it barely feels that long ... I guess this is
what happens when you're a messy Bitch Who Lives for Drama

**oanis** (7.7): She's right and she should say it.

**akanewasright** (7): Oooh this is nice

#This is the album’s Witness era

**abcd9muses** (6.5): I think it’s a bit too long and meanders for a bit too long, but I like it. I really
do like all of the Baduism songs!

**astrologicalangel** (6): just a bit too long

**izeasklapaucius** (5): nothing happens at all

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this one was too boring for me rip

**flavasavavandal** (2): What is it with neo-soul ladies making songs that could very easily
interpreted as dismissing the plight of people in lower economic and social hierarchies than
themselves. Erykah may have better production on this song, but Erykah asking people to turn to
god turns me off in the worst way

**bbfan132** (8.5): I liked this quite a bit, but it doesn’t stand out too much when you look at the album as a whole. I would put this on repeat in the background while I’m working on something else, but it isn’t a song that I would actively pay too much attention to.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Jill kinda snapped with this one, while it veers into conspiracy theory at times (is DirectTV the enemy?) but she was railing against the surveillance state twenty years ago! It’s lower in the rankings that I would personally place it but I totally understand why… perhaps the strange fusion of singing and spoken word was a bit too much for y’all, or perhaps it was too #woke, or maybe it was just the dripping water noises because several comments complained about that. Still, keep spreading the good word Jill.

#Third eye open

**ImADudeDuh** (10): no one: ...... the united states government to Jill Scott:
https://i.imgur.com/hCtimO2.gif

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): she gets it yup

**vayyiqra** (10): Most based lyrics in this rate maybe

**runaway3212** (9.5): the outro is a bit bland

**Benthetall1** (9): I quite like the messaging on this one, I cannot think of a ton of songs tackling
the issue of surveillance and the white supremacist state. A little heavy handed, as all the poetry
songs are, but a stronger one.

**fadedblue09** (9): It's a little weird-sounding but wow, the lyrics are really relevant today. It
manages to sound socially conscious without being awkward or heavy-handed.

**Roxieloxie** (9): :noitstrue:

**Stryxen** (9): This sounds like a kero kero bonito song

**celladonn** (8.5): This is good but why does it sound like a cat is lapping milk in the background

**abcd9muses** (8): okay so I think the reason why the skits/spoken words parts of Misseducation
didn’t vibe with me was because they were too distracting, not really fully embedded in thee song
as a whole. With Who is Jill Scott, they’re inseparable from the songs. My attention doesn’t feel
divided, like I have to give up one part of the song for the other

**flavasavavandal** (8): This feels more timely now, and hearing water just trickling in the mix
makes me really uncomfortable (in the good way), and I feel like a lot of people are gonna score
this low but I just want Jill Scott and this song to know, I hear you, I see you, I appreciate you

**oanis** (8): The textures in the beat do it for me.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): Guys I think they might be watching her

**akanewasright** (7): We LOVE Jill Scott’s flow

**ManofOranges** (7): What TVs are thinking.

#moist

**waluigiest** (7): it’s so wet ;_;

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6): minus for the wet sounds

**SmileAndTears** (3.5): Idk I really don’t hate this (though the sample in the back is annoying)

**Brendon-Urine** (3): The dripping sounds did not pan out... interesting idea for sure

**seanderlust** (0): NOT a fan of the wet sounds in the bg. and even though she's technically right,
some of these lyrics really read as boomer-style "technology bad" opinion pieces.

**bbfan132** (7.5): It’s kind of funny to see this below the intro, since both sound very similar, but I think I agree with that assessment. While the intro has deep bass that accentuates the sound of the song, this outro is just a pleasant ending to the album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): One of the things I was most excited to see in this rate is which version of “Rim Shot” would rank higher, and the answer didn’t surprise me. I don’t like how this abruptly cuts in and while it’s cute that the album begins/ends the same way, hearing the same song twice doesn’t exactly make it more endearing.

---

#People who want a rimshot

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): so true queen

**Brendon-Urine** (9): there's something so pleasing about albums that start and end in the same
way. Something about the bass line/percussion is just so perfect for an intro/outro too.

**fadedblue09** (9): Why does this hit harder as a reprise?

**Awkward\_King** (8): it doesn't hit quite the same the second time around

**Benthetall1** (8): Great the second time, but adds to the impression of ending this album with
unnecessary repetition.

**izeasklapaucius** (8): no thoughts, just "I wanna rim shot ayy digi dig-"

**oanis** (8): yup so good run it back.

**runaway3212** (8): Slappening

**Stryxen** (8): i- i- i wanna i- i- i wanna

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): horny jazz part 2

**oscarbrierley1** (7): it makes more sense on the original album so it closes the way it started

**seanderlust** (7): you guys i think she wants a rimshot

#People who want the rims to stay un-shot

**abcd9muses** (6.5): doesn’t have the same impact as the intro but still liked it!

**flavasavavandal** (6): I feel like this is a pretty underwhelming and honestly lazy closer

**SmileAndTears** (5): Boring at the beginning, boring now

#Do you have something to share with the class?

**CarlieScion** (7): still kinda disapointed rim shot doesn't mean what i thought it meant

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): We heard a snippet of this earlier with Mix #9 and the final version doesn’t disappoint… or does I guess since y’all voted it out in the bottom ten. A beautiful song that’s perhaps a bit too long, like a lot of songs from this point upwards there was nothing really wrong with the track it was just outcompeted by stronger ones. Also another connection to The Roots: this track was originally supposed to feature Black Thought (who’s the voice heard on “The Roots (Interlude)”) but he isn’t on the final version for some reason.

**bbfan132** (8): When I heard Mix #9, I was expecting a bit more from this song. I really enjoy it (as I enjoy basically every song on this album), but it feels more like a nice song to put on in the background than a song that I’m truly interested in or connected to.

**ManofOranges** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=99C5xpF-USA

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): love the production

**runaway3212** (10): beautiful

**1998tweety** (9): here's the smasha from earlier oh wow

**Benthetall1** (9): I do wonder why the verse from mix 9 didn’t end up in the full version of this
song, but this is another great midtempo groove, might prefer the reworking on the Live album. The
True Ending.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I love the subtle ominousness of this.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Where Has The Love Gone? by Kylie Minogue.

**oanis** (8): so so so real and a song I haven't heard before that will be on heavy repeat when I'm
in those feelings.

#Never

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): why was this disappoint after listening to mix 9

**abcd9muses** (7): the instrumental texture that comes in like every ten seconds is very attention
grabbing, in a good way. It’s used in a lot of songs and idk I just really think Badu knows how to
invoke a sonic aesthetic well. I also think this is a perfect example of a meandering song done well.

**ReallyCreative** (6): meh

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): ughhhhhh so the bangers on this album kinda stopped

**bbfan132** (8): The second half of this album was not as strong as the first half in my opinion, and this song was one of those that kind of flew by me without making much of a mark. It’s certainly pretty, but it doesn’t feel like there is anything truly remarkable about this track. This placement seems about right, in my opinion.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This is the last track of the standard edition of *Who Is Jill Scott?* (though there are bonus tracks) and I like to think of it as “No Scrubs” for the mature lady. Despite the somewhat aggressive tone of the lyrics it’s actually a kinda sweet song because she’s giving this guy the benefit of the doubt, she really *wants* him to love her and she thinks that he can… she’s just gotta be sure.

#I’m showing you the comments on this song

**runaway3212** (10): Pretty

**CarlieScion** (9): should have been the last song

**abcd9muses** (8.5): so I think my personal music preferences are drawn to the slower and lower
instrumentals, hence why Brotha, which is lighter in comparison, isn’t my fave of the album and why
it has a lower score. It’s also why I connect with this album and have given multiple eights.

**waluigiest** (8): “you show me your exterior / I need to see your interior” okay songwriting
excellence

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A bit uninteresting compared to the other songs

**Benthetall1** (7): Doesn’t really hold my interest, except the outro which earns it a point purely on
the merit of vocal control.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): can you believe that people used to just make hard to find songs on their own

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Well this track certainly got a LOT of reactions! I don’t know whether to consider this song an interlude or just a track that happens to be solely poetry, but like all of the other shorter tracks in the rate it’s unfortunately fallen lower in the rankings. I have a soft spot for this one, Jill’s spoken word talents shine here and no matter how many times I listen I’m always a little bit gagged when this checkout girl literally sniffs out her man! A perfectly respectable placement for a track of this kind.

**bbfan132** (8): Easily the horniest song in this rate… holy shit. The lyrics made me laugh - Jill is such a poetic lyricist with a lot of wit. I’m happy that this song made it to #38, despite its short length.

---

#This track is cute!

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Not subtle at all.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I was about to overshare in this comment but I knew I would regret it when
the rate reveal started so I learned to keep my mouth shut.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Musically kinda lacking, but the storytelling here is so good that I don't
even care

**ReallyCreative** (10): Spoken word poetry when pulled off like this is just transcendent the
TALENT

**runaway3212** (10): neo soul perfection

**seanderlust** (10): the new girl at the counter was........cute.

**TiltControls** (10): i love how it just ends with the "Right? Right." Also the line "the new girl at the
counter was... cute" was fantastically done

**waluigiest** (10): the poetry, the sensuality, the scene painting, im LOSING IT

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): The way this starts off, so artfully horny and then how it ends :deadbanana:

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): This is a rollercoaster of a story

**CarlieScion** (9): 😳

**oanis** (9): This whole skit about her meeting this woman her man used to be with at the grocery
store is SO funny. Like imagine this woman just sniffing you as she's ringing you up??? Bye.

**whizzer0** (9): This one's stuck with me. I love a strong image and this track does a great job of
capturing a moment without stringing it out.

**abcd9muses** (8): I’ve never heard a Jill Scott song before (I think?), but her storytelling is
remarkable.

**akanewasright** (8): I - Jill!

**fadedblue09** (8): Monogamy queen

**izeasklapaucius** (8): this is hilarious lmao

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): and sniffed and sniffed and sniffed

**noctilucentvibes** (8): who else felt the pandemic listening to this

**skargardin** (8): i love how explicit this is

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (8): my face at the end lmao

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (7.5): The first half of the song... god I wish that were me

**celladonn** (7): $4.85 for croissants seems expensive to me

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (7): You can just feel her Paranoia and irritation rising that builds up to
hearing the “Raheem?” Bit.

#But not as fine as me
**NFLfreak98** (6.5): I mean you go and all. I think this kinda thing works more for me when it’s at
all subtle.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): Those lyrics are giving me smutty fanfiction vibes

**Benthetall1** (6): I like the idea of interspersed poetry and music and the beat reminds me of
D’Angelo but I’m not loving the verses.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Men really do be smelling strong so that ex’s can recognize them off the
other girls smell

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): I'm not really a fan of spoken interludes

**ManofOranges** (4): Not a big fan of the words, and I kinda saw the twist coming but I still like it.

**Brendon-Urine** (0): I can't listen to this. I can't. Automatic skip, I never want to hear about sex
like this EVER again, so sorry to Jill.

#I didn’t end up doing this but thank you for believing in us <3

**Awkward\_King** (6): pls tell me the interlude for this will be obsessions by marina :00 ghost you
have to with how much she talks abt her shopping list at the end pls

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): *And* the other “Rim Shot” goes out, only 0.27 points above its companion. This is an incredible opening track, when I first listened to *Baduizm* this grabbed me right away with its effortless vibes and Erykah’s lovely voice and it’s still one of my favorite tracks on the album. There are perhaps some sexual undertones to this song but shhhh~

**bbfan132** (8): LOVE the bass here, such a soothing intro to this album. It’s funny how it is multiple places above the outro, but I totally agree with that. In the end, though, it is just an intro, so it was destined to leave on day 1.

---

#Getting that Rim Shot digi digi

**Awkward\_King** (10): im sorry its just its a 10 isn't it hun

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): just straight vibes

**mysario** (10): really picking and choosing what intros we get here, huh?

**oanis** (9.5): Chills with that bassline everytime. Boom clack boom clack. Period.

**Benthetall1** (9): Rim Shot is exempt from the intro tax. It says everything it needs to and is the
perfect opening to Baduizm.

**izeasklapaucius** (9): no thoughts, just "I wanna rim shot ayy digi digi a rim shot ayy come on"

**oscarbrierley1** (9): great intro to the album really shows what's coming

**ReallyCreative** (9): a really subtle and interesting way to start an album?

**akanewasright** (8.5): What a fucking great opener to an album.

**fadedblue09** (8): A sultry intro.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): how is this so catchy

**MrSwearword** (8): an effective intro, werk

**noctilucentvibes** (8): the bass hits

**runaway3212** (8): Another great opener!

**abcd9muses** (7.5): ; I love the bass, it adds so much depth. It can also take the song anywhere
— it could be dark pop, it could be groove, it has so much potential to pull inspiration/sample from!
The only think I don’t like is how it ends so abruptly, just when I was really getting into it!

**skargardin** (7): cute intro

**seanderlust** (6.7): she wants a what??? :elmo:

**ManofOranges** (6): Honestly, not a bad intro. Not thrilling, but not bad.

**waluigiest** (6): her vocals are stunning but there’s not much there

#Get a job

**CarlieScion** (7): idk what the fuck a rim shot is but i sure as hell hope its what im thinking
(update: it was not what i was thinking)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): my mind is in the gutter what about it

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): The way I had to google this to find out if a Rim Shot was some sexual
act I didn't know about

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my personal favorites from Jill’s album! It pains me that this didn’t place higher, given the strength of the top half of the rate I guess it’s understandable but y’all couldn’t have at least bumped it up to Day 2? I think the message of this song (emerging from desperation and pain) is very powerful and I’m obsessed with the way she whispers out the lyrics… it’s like you can hear her healing.

**bbfan132** (8): This was where the album started to dip a bit for me. This isn’t bad or mediocre by any means, but when compared to the excellent tracks in the first half, songs like this kind of pale in comparison. It’s very repetitive and smooth, which makes it nice to listen to in the background, but I couldn’t give it anything higher than an 8 (which is still a high score). This placement seems correct.

#People on the road to recovery

**Question4TheCulture** (11): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular,
never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not
reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**fadedblue09** (10): Love the ominousness of this. It really fits the song's theme, in which the
protagonist is walking away from love, which is a turning point in this album.

**oanis** (10): Ugh. She just sounds so good on this. This is on my break up playlist.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The outro here is SO HEAVENLY

**Benthetall1** (9.5): This is where the fusion of music with poetry is most successful and subtle.

**GloriaBellVEVO\_** (8.7): 🥺

**abcd9muses** (8.5): so smooth, so sultry, so cool

**seanderlust** (8): this one is a little more meh than the rest of the album. not bad by any means,
just not standing out

**Stryxen** (8): Random but this percussion has me feeling something

#😔

**runaway3212** (9): Popheads don't give this a low score just because it has slow in the title

**bbfan132** (8.5): This is in the same spot as Watching Me for me - I really enjoy the overall sound of this track as well as the message, but I think I would put this on repeat in the background rather than actively pay attention and immerse myself in the song. Also, that video………. an odd discovery….

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Not my personal favorite and I’m not surprised to see it go out on day one, it’s nice but it gets repetitive after a while and it just kinda ends? The pro-“brotha” message is appreciated though, something tells me there were a lot of dudes out there back in the day who had this one on repeat!

#Allies

**Benthetall1** (9.5): That piano is killer. This solidifies the back third of the album as the real high
point.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): A well-written anthem of solidarity, with some jazzy flavor to it.

**seanderlust** (9.1): POSITIVITY

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Shoutout to the people who attended the listening party and saw that video.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i will give this points for being a black male empowerment anthem

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): groovy

**cremeebrulee** (8): its cute

**runaway3212** (8): I love my brother!

**skargardin** (8): this is very sweet

**oanis** (7.8): Beautiful message.

**abcd9muses** (7): still great ngl but it just doesn’t attract me that much, it’s like a pit stop on a
road trip, necessary to take a break from having your senses occupied for an extended amount of
time

**DilemmaofaHedgeHog** (7): I think this addressed social ills and racism really well and direct
without spelling it out. Also I like the use of “we” in the phrasing.

**bbfan132** (10): This is easily the first day boot that hurts the most for me. I adore how smooth this track is, and Lauryn and D’Angelo are a musical match made in heaven. Their voices are both gorgeous and work perfectly together. This really captures the essence of this genre in my opinion, and it’s sad to see it leave on Day 1. :/

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I think it’s hilarious that Lauryn Hill, a woman infamous for showing up to events late, is our last song eliminated Day 1. As hilarious as that is I’m actually a little bit shocked that this one is leaving us now! It was sitting pretty in Day 2 for a while until the late rush of ballots shoved it down, with a general consensus from the negative comments being that it’s just kinda slow and uninteresting compared to the rest of the album. I disagree, both Lauryn and D’Angelo sound beautiful here and the vibes here are sooo good, but the people have spoken!

---

#No matters, head empty

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): beautiful

**oanis** (9): Beautiful song.

**skargardin** (9): this is so gorgeous

**Benthetall1** (8): OK, so this isn’t one of my favorites off this album and I do need to try
differentiate the scores a little bit. That being said, off-kilter beauty is one of D’Angelo’s specialties
and this track shows it off in spades.

**CarlieScion** (8): do the black conscious rate

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): DO ROXIE'S RATE!!! D'Angelo's voice is really pretty!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is so soothing, they have great vocal chemistry ... ALSO GO DO THE
BLACK CONSCIOUS CLASSICS RATE

**ManofOranges** (7): Me everyday.

**seanderlust** (7): it's not that it's bad-it's lovely! it's just not as great as almost all of the rest of the
tracks on this album which causes it to stick out. also idk maybe my expectations were higher since
I love both lauryn and d'angelo? could just be me shrug anyways do the black conscious rate

#Low scores matter in rate placement actually

**Brendon-Urine** (6.5): the snaps are kinda awkward... without them this'd be better

**NFLfreak98** (6): Very smooth and the bassline is great but man does this go nowhere

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's pleasant but it doesn't stack up to most other songs on this album or in
this rate

**SmileAndTears** (6): the repetitiveness... far too much

**izeasklapaucius** (5.5): this kinda drags

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I feel bad cause this is kinda boring but this has a man on it and giving it one
of the worst scores on the album makes me feel like a basic ass pophead

**runaway3212** (5): this drags a bit

**fadedblue09** (4): Sorry but this just went nowhere, and the lyrics weren't interesting to warrant
its length. Waste of a smooth instrumental.

**flavasavavandal** (4): Love songs about how nothing else matters except the two lovers are
BORING!!!! We need to delete this trope from music history because they always sing it like the
song doesn’t matter as well

#[hmmm](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/layquo/black_conscious_classics_rate/)
