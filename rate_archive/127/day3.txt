**Roxieloxie** (10): this song was *very* close to getting my 11. So I’m happy to see it make day 3

**TiltControls** (10): A rough cut to start the day off, but honestly I'm just glad that it made day 3. Louis has a pretty unique voice so I was a bit worried he'd be hit there. The song itself is a classic. Even if the world is (and has kind of been) always fucked up in parts, this song does a great job at appreciating the things that are getting better.

---

#What a wonderful rate

**CrimsonROSET** (11): I have no fucking idea how this song is gonna do. I hope it does well, because this might be one of my favorite songs we’ve ever rated. It was the first song I learned to fully sing in English, and it has been one of my comfort songs ever since. It’s such a simple message: ‘hey, maybe this world isn’t all that bad’. But holy shit does it hold meaning more and more as the times become uncertain. There’s so much ugly, but there is also so much beauty. And that’s what this song reminds me of. What a wonderful world indeed.

**nootnoot781** (11): if i had a nickel for every time i gave an 11 to a song used in the madagascar film franchise for the august rate cycle, i’d have two nickels, which isn’t a lot, but it’s weird that it happened twice.

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): PAIN

**bbfan132** (10): the song that i sobbed to when my teacher played a retrospective video of the school year in kindergarten

**bespectacIed** (10): multiple lies were detected

**bigbigbee** (10): It’s not just the sentiment that’s nice, it’s held up by some of the most beautiful melody writing and accompaniment ever put on a record.

**cremeebrulee** (10): lemme pretend i am not depressed for 2 minutes and 19 seconds

**frogaranaman** (10): :)

**GARjuna** (10): feels disrespectful to give it less. Madagascar nostalgia....

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.tiktok.com/@bvrritto/video/6972250129013280005

**jsonphile** (10): look up apple bottom jeans Louis Armstrong trust me you won’t be disappointed

**nt96** (10): A very close 11 contender. The raspy, hoarse vocals give off this perspective of a senior reflecting on the world around him before passing away, remembering only all the good things in life and hoping others will do the same. It's rare to have a song that powerful with such a simple message.

**runaway3212** (10): I love how sweet this sounds it's amazing

**skargardin** (10): I have a bad feeling that this is going to be very robbed, hopefully I'm wrong

**thedoctordances1940** (10): god it really still is gorgeous

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a beautiful and wholesome song and even though it's not my favourite it would be a deserving winner. I hope everyone gives it a high rating.

**waluigiest** (10): this song is legendary but I honestly don’t think I’d heard it in full before

**jman457** (9.6): walked so Kacey Musgraves “Oh what a world could” run

**orangetangerine** (9.1): Shit, I just realized that the last 5 seconds of this song is where that currently popular viral TikTok sound came from. Damn you, TikTok.

**anothertown** (9): It's so funny that Louis Armstrong's signature song doesn't have any trumpet in it lol

**NotWith10000Men** (9): gorgeous. What a unique voice

**rslashpoopheads** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySaLdP_othI

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): My kindergarten teacher taught us this song. She told us that she was in the hospital for a while and that this was the song that helped her get through that tough time. It was the first memory I ever had of seeing how music can evoke deep emotions and feelings in people, and I think it was her story that inspired me to join the school choir and venture into the world of music myself. So of course I have to pay tribute to this piece! I know this sounds cheesy, but in such a pessimistic world as today’s I think we should all allow ourselves sometimes to listen to a bit of happy, positive music to remind us of all the good that still exists in the world.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Appreciate the optimism, Louis

**seanderlust** (8.5): this is lovely and I have a soft spot for louis' voice over jazz accompaniment. that being said, reading up on the history of this song...was this the "celebrities singing imagine" of the vietnam/civil rights era?

**BB-TheBest22** (8.1): (This stuck out in this rate to me, it just sounded very different than the other songs)

**halibut1234** (8): Red roses too

**ignitethephoenix** (8): classic but his voice really is something … I guess it makes the song what it is

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): I've lost count of how many times I've heard this song in a movie or a cover of it on a TV show. It's another objectively good song, but I don't see myself listening to this in any situation

**trashypanini** (7.5): A simply beautiful hopeful track. The swell of instruments and Louis’ voice really makes this first Pixar movie like song before there was such a type.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): This song is still great, but unfortunately it's been so overused in commercials and media that it's lost all meaning

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): listen I hear this song three times a day on the Pandora at my store, I don’t have to like it

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7): It's fine? I really don't have anything to say about this despite hearing it so many times

**plastichaxan** (7): i hate white people using this on their movies part 2

**rickikardashian** (7): film directors when they need to use a song to show that the character is experiencing happiness and freedom:

**stryxen** (7): what a wonderful song

#flat earthers

**jackisboredtoday** (6): This song is legendary and classic for many reasons but as much I wish it were otherwise I’ve never really loved Louis Armstrong’s one-of-a-kind voice

**2dina3dworld** (4): Louis better be glad that we’re rating this and not his version of La vie en Rose because no one can beat the original version of that.

**TiltControls** (10): Okay maybe this song doesn't have the same classic impact as a lot of the other songs on the list, but it's a bop to the fullest degree. Maybe more than almost all of the rest of the list. I mean it's basically joy just distilled down into a 3 minute song. What's not to love from that?

**Roxieloxie** (8): i just think its neat

---

#Powerpuff girls

**rickikardashian** (11): buttercup is sort of a weird pet name, like, i dont think butter has ever been the best part of any meal or dessert. just call me sugar.

**2dina3dworld** (10): mmmmm, choir moment

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is just one of those songs, you know what I mean?

**bespectacIed** (10): 60s preppiness, I just imagine oiled up hairs and pastel suits and old school gentleman etiquette when I listen to this. Stonecold classique

**bigbigbee** (10): I adore this song. Its brightness really masks kind of sad lyrics, kind of, which I never realized until this rate? It makes me feel so sunny.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I have such a strong memory of this song being performed on the FOX game show Don’t Forget The Lyrics and I even remember that the lyrics that needed to be filled in were “don’t break my heart.” idk why i decided to remember that

**joeeswift** (10): wow I surprisingly know so many songs in this rate, these hits are really transcending decades

**ManofOranges** (10): Certified classic

**stryxen** (10): no but literally everyone loves this song i’ve put this on at a party before and everyone went yass

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is a damn bop, I don't care how corny it is.

**waluigiest** (10): this song fills me with infinite joy

**akanewasright** (9.5): My sister’s grade in choir had a women’s ensemble one year, and they did this song and it made me really really happy. Also for some reason the way the line “I’m attracted to you” is written just sticks in my head sometimes? Half a point off because I want version of the song that finishes the last chorus after the key change

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**bbfan132** (9): my mom still sings this randomly at times

**rslashpoopheads** (9): now i want to eat butter

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Such a catchy, fun song… but why put a key change right at the very end of the song?? How dare they build us up just to let us down… hey wait a minute

**welcome2thejam** (9): Veeery close to overplayed, but the infectiousness and the big crowd singalong potential just fills me with too much joy.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.8): a fine addition to my collection--of songs in a playlist called sunny day

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Overplayed but still cute

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): this is a ten for memories but -1.5 for reminding me of sports letdowns every year

**runaway3212** (8.5): I love how intensely fun this is, it's like infectious

**avenueroy** (8.1): The chorus is fantastic, iconic, flawless, etc. But I think the verses are a little weak and bland in comparison. Still an amazing song though.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): This one is catchy. I like it!

**nt96** (8): pretty sure a lot of people know this song of that one commercial but I'm glad they know this song now!

**skargardin** (8): bop!!

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.9): This would be higher if I hadn’t heard this in so many ads over the decades.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is a tad bit corny but I’m bopping

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): buttercups are so overrated they’re such a boring flower

**jaztinax** (7.5): this is like, the 60s version of dancing on my own

**anothertown** (7): 500-days-of-summer-core

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7): this used to play at the entertainment club where my family went on holiday every year lmao

**trashypanini** (7): Did Kit Kat interpolate this song??? Also the sunny beachy vibe is beaming in this soft pop track. But lyrics wise it is apart of the struggle “love” canon 😭. People really was dancing to songs about manipulative/emotionally abusive/negligent partners n unhealthy codependency framed as romantic devotion on the regular

#Stepped on a lego before turning in their scores

**jman457** (6.2): I expect to be highly misandrist this rate

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.1): As a Fyre Fest stan, I thought the Hulu doc was weak as hell, and they kinda ruined this song for me. Boo snarky irony-poisoned millennials!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): still shocked that this ended up not being the first Nina song out but oh well. 

**TiltControls** (8.4): Another classic coming from Nina. The instrumentation is great and the vocal delivery is masterclass. Special shoutout to the sax solo for doing THAT.

---

#The clit of this rate

**2dina3dworld** (10): Nina Simone could hex me and I’d thank her

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Nina Simone was seriously a next level artist.

**anothertown** (10): The arrangement of this is so beautiful

**bbfan132** (10): nina’s outros are always the best <3

**bespectacIed** (10): Classic, relevant, iconic

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is gonna be robbed

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): An opening just as iconic as Feeling Good. All the runs and the emotions you expect from Nina. If you've read her autobiography you'll know Ms Simone was, to put it politely, thirsty AF for many men around here, and this is only one of the sensual songs in her catalogue. You could make a whole playlist of Nina Simone for sex (Tell me more and more, Sugar in My bowl, Do I move you, etc), but this is the song that almost threatens to eclipse her other songs and no one can do it quite like her.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I mean, she did!

**GARjuna** (10): I LOVE her voice

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Nina, Screamin’ Jay, and Bette the holy trinity of this song.

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): James Bond song vibes.

**ManofOranges** (10): Hex girls vibes

**rickikardashian** (10): the spell in question was just writing his name 50 times on a piece of paper while holding a crystal up to your chest

**runaway3212** (10): I wish more people would put a spell on me if it sounded like this

**seanderlust** (10): lyrically a little basic but it's a 10 because it's one of the best instrumentals in the rate. that saxophone is wicked

**skargardin** (10): This rate is actually making me save some of these albums to my library

**bigbigbee** (9.5): The twinkly piano in this really does have the effect of spellbinding the listener. It’s well written and well named!

**jaztinax** (9.5): (stank face activated)

**stryxen** (9.5): not quite perfect but still one of the best songs in the rate

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): a great song but also not even the best song on this album, that’s how strong it was

**orangetangerine** (9.2): No cover of it has ever come close to this masterpiece. The instrumentals are brilliant.

**1998tweety** (9): omg that sax

**jman457** (9): iconic

**plastichaxan** (9): no cause she put a spell on her whole discography to be this good

**qazz23** (9): I like the string arrangements

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): that sax is nasty

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7.5): Not as good as Screamin' Jay Hawkins' version tbh

**trashypanini** (7): Nina sounds perfectly sultry and makes beautiful use of her voice as a instrument here. I’ve never been too in love with the production value on this and it cuts through with interruption on Nina and then weirdly retreats.  It’s a gradual build which highlight the lyrics.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I will never get over how the opening lines to this song are literally “I put a spell on you… cause you’re mine, doo doo doo-n doo”

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah.sorry,  I hate this song. I don't know why, I just do. I've never heard a version of this song I like. I think it might be that it feels like it has no rhythm and is almost in free time. I like Nina Simone a lot, just not this song.

**TiltControls** (10): Like 'What a Wonderful World' I just find this song super calming and relaxing, even if the lyrics are a little sad at times. Everything about the song comes together to paint the perfect picture of, well, sitting on the dock of the bay and thinking. Unfortunately Otis Redding died before this song was released so he never got to see its success resonate with so many people out there, but it's become a classic staple and I'm glad it could make it this far in the rate.



---

**avenueroy** (11): Otis Redding was only 26 when he recorded this song, and taken from the world far too soon. The level of talent is unbelievable.

**fadedblue09** (11): Honestly a lot of these songs are masterpieces, but I choose to give my 11 to this simple yet contemplative piece of poetry. That, or maybe cuz I'm biased because Sara Bareilles loves this song

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Made a habit of listening to this while sitting on a dock in the San Francisco bay during lockdowns. Was calming. 10/10 would reccomend

**bbfan132** (10): otis blue is an excellent album, check it out (along with his other songs)!

**bespectacIed** (10): chill vibes

**celladonn** (10): Me when I'm sitting on the dock of the bay

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Stoppp I'm MADT at only one Otis songs!!! Wait I may use this spot to rant at the hosts lmao jk u guys are great. Where's Try a Little Tenderness?! Also for deeper cuts I recommend "You Left the Water Running" and "Look at That Girl". My mom always calls Sam Cooke "her man" lmao but I'm team Otis allllll day. His gravelly yet tender voice. UNMATCHED. He and Nina were my MUSIC during my heavy soul phase my senior year. An immense talent gone too soon!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love this dude’s voice, and I haven't heard a single song of his that I didn’t like. It’s about time to check his discography and probably become a fan. BTW, this has to make it to the top 10 at least

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the fact that he died at 26 is so sad

**jsonphile** (10): it’s amazing when a song sounds exactly like it’s subject matter. If I didn’t speak English and just heard the song, I would imagine someone just relaxing in nature, taking a break from the world

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): for the whistle solo alone.

**Motm-track9** (10): the ultimate song to have an existential crisis to.

**waluigiest** (10): tears that this is the only Otis song in the rate. Try a Little Tenderness would have been my 11 immediately

**jaztinax** (9.5): i will never get over how subtle yet intricate his runs are. wow wow wow

**trashypanini** (9.5): Such a relatable track. Feeling as if you’re in a standstill and kind of just going doing the vortex of hopelessness. Everyone has something to say you just don’t know where to go. Indecision is a time killer for me and it welcomes regret easily.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): a fishing ANTHEM

**thedoctordances1940** (9): it's quite simple, definitely not the most interesting track here, but it just oozes happiness, especially the whistling at the end, it's so infectious

**NotWith10000Men** (8.8): I love his voice and melody of this song

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this song is so chill and relaxing

**nt96** (8.5): The song stings a lot, especially knowing what came shortly after. Such a shame Otis never got see the fruits of his labor.

**runaway3212** (8.5): Actually super fun and vibes

**jman457** (8.3): catchy lil tune

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I’m sitting on a chair

**rslashpoopheads** (8): we vibing

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): One of my dad’s favorite songs… and you know what? I like it too!

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I like this song a lot, but it’s mildly ruined for me because there's a bit by the scumbag comedian Louis CK (I saw this before his allegations came out) where he says that the worst standup he's ever seen was from a guy who made a parody version of this song that was, "sittin on a cock cause I'm gay"

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**orangetangerine** (7): The whistling at the end of my song is my favorite. It's not a bad song but I have memories of being annoyed having to sing an uninteresting arrangement of this in high school choir.

**stryxen** (7): no but this is exactly what sitting on the dock of the bay sounds like

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): such a dad song

**TiltControls** (10): And thus we say goodbye to Stevie in the rate. One thing I'm a little surprised about is the lack of 11's given to him, but as mentioned previously, I think a lot of his stronger work shows up in the 70's. Still this song is a classic in its own rate and definitely my favourite of his in the rate. And that harmonica solo is another level!

**Roxieloxie** (9): I swear to god popheads I will find a way to make Stevie win a rate

**2dina3dworld** (10): what a beauty of a song

**anothertown** (10): Like the dope that I am, I’ve loved this song for so many years and think it’s deeply thrilling and romantic

**bbfan132** (10): so so good <3 such a pleasant classic

**bespectacIed** (10): stevie LEGEND

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh if this goes to all stars it’ll be such a big 11 contender

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Can't believe Stevie invented music. Thank u. In all seriousness, Stevie is arguably one of the most talented and breathtaking musicians of all time. On top of being an iconic musician, his voice is beautiful and carries the music beautifully.

**jaztinax** (10): i can’t believe i’m not giving stevie, my fav artist of all time, my 11 but this was a 11 contender. pls make it to top 10

**joeeswift** (10): the harmonica solo?? perfection

**nt96** (10): A definite 11 contender for me. Stevie Wonder's voice always sounded like sunshine and never missed a beat.

**qazz23** (10): Love the harmonica!

**rickikardashian** (10): once he pulled that harmonica it was over for me

**runaway3212** (10): omfg that solo was amazing

**skargardin** (10): My spotify lagged and My Cherie Amour started playing after this but it was still displayed as For Once In My Life, so for a split second I thought it was a hidden track or an outro.. deadbanana

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Why did I not know Stevie was around in the 60s until this rate? Well I will gladly take this opportunity to give one of the great kings of pop the credit he deserves!

**waluigiest** (10): I feel everything he is saying

**seanderlust** (9.5): COME ON HARMONICA!!!!

**twinfiresigns14** (9.5): Where the hell do these people get these voices?

**stryxen** (9): lemme unmisandrify my scores

**avenueroy** (8.7): This song gets me hyped the fuck up

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I think Stevie Wonder is at his best on songs like this or Superstition or Sir Duke, where the melody is in focus and his incredible vocals are allowed to soar above a jazzy rhythm. Can you believe he was only 18 when he sang this?!?!?

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i was typing my comment to this and then something popped up on my laptop that i’ve never seen before so im scared

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): A classic, but I still prefer ‘70s Stevie.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): love it

**thedoctordances1940** (8): it slaps

**orangetangerine** (7.9): This song is so versatile and while Stevie Wonder's version is the OG and the best it also holds up in the style of an old jazz/pop standard. Tony Bennett and Frank Sinatra both slayed this song in a completely different style.

**jman457** (7.6): doesnt reach the heights of his later works, but his voice and harmonica are iconic!

**trashypanini** (7): A prodigy doing prodigy things mhm. A gorgeous ode to newfound love. The iconic Harmonica cutting through too.

#Will vote cut to the feeling into as5

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I had high expectations for this one because if that incredible intro

The instrumentation does a great job building her up (also, fuck Phil Spector) but imo she's still the star of the show here. Her vocal delivery is another level of amazing. Even if you watch performances of her 30 years later she still has the moves and pipes to perform as she did back in the 60's. Seriously stunning. I honestly thought this was a lock for top 10, but we're getting to the part where the scores are high enough that the competition is becoming fierce. Also if we ever do a sequel Proud Mary deserves top 10 easy.

#Glee stans your only acknloegement will be this comment

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i play the card ‘gay nostalgia’ which makes roxie take 200 mental damage for every glee reference made about this song

#Absolute iconery

**rslashpoopheads** (11): honestly how could I not give this my 11 (ps all the best glee covers were Naya and Amber duets)

**trashypanini** (11): My fave Tina joint! The booming and building swinging rhythm (almost big band like!) plus Tina’s rich soaring voice. It really adds to lyrics about a growing love. This is really an epic. & unsurprisingly this song is the only one of this particular production value by the vile man but it’s really a taste of the true legendary rockin roll power of Tina’s voice.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Tina Turner was ahead of her time

**bbfan132** (10): tina <3 <3

**bespectacIed** (10): The grandiose production, my gad. That orchestra. Literally a classic. And fuck ike forever and always!


**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): yes ten points for Tina, 0 for Ike!! This reminds me of putting one of Tina's 80s records on my mom's Ipod Nano in 2013 (lol) and her singing "Simply the Best" out of tune lol. is this whole rate gonna be stories of my mom?? help

**ignitethephoenix** (10): SANTANA AND MERCEDES SHOULD HAVE WON DUET WEEK NOT BLAND ASS QUINN AND SAM

**ImADudeDuh** (10): If there was r/popheads in the 1960s, there would be people who shamed anyone who scrobbled this on their record players and I imagine it would eventually spill into the Town Hall (at a literally town hall) eventually

**jsonphile** (10): I just know half the comments are going to be glee related and the other half will be about how Ike Turner and/or Phil Spector are terrible people

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Fuck yeah. Phil Spector’s magnum opus. TWENTY ONE session musicians are on this. Such an epic track.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is for Tina and ONLY Tina

**plastichaxan** (10): i hate that the reason i know this is glee, and the fact i'm sharing this like it's not embarrassing

**qazz23** (10): Great use of the wall of sound, love the vocals (11 candidate)

**runaway3212** (10): TINA TURNER IS SUCH AN ICON I LOVE HER SO MUCH

**skargardin** (10): Riiiiver deeeep mountain HIIIIIIIIGH

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): ugh tina ily

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): it’s a wonderful song, but the mixing lets it down a bit.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): Tina Turner’s voice is just incredible. Fuck Ike Turner

**BB-TheBest22** (9.3): Fuck Ike Turner

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**akanewasright** (9): FUCK Ike Turner, but my god this song is so good

**anothertown** (9): is this actually the most fucked up, eerie and cavernous mix ever put to wax or am I just more inclined to fear it because Phil Spector was a homicidal abuser?? Anyway

**cherryices** (8.8): how can i make this about glee

**jman457** (8.7): Ms. Tina snapped here and the production is really beautiful

**bigbigbee** (8): This song reminds me of anime openings…like not really, but the build and the strings. I’m sure that one could draw a complicated diagram of how this sub-genre of soul went on to inspire like, fucking, SUPERCELL, but I lack the history and the graphic design skills.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): All the comments are gonna mention the Glee version and that is absolutely correct

**jaztinax** (8): glee did it better tbh

**NotWith10000Men** (7.6): damn she is singing the rafters off

**letsallpoo** (7): bracing myself for glee comments

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): it sounds so grand

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This feels more like a religious experience than a song… but unfortunately I can’t imagine myself listening to it a lot…

**seanderlust** (6.5): if I had a nickel for every song in this rate that focused on the dimensions of rivers and mountains, i'd have two nickels. which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it's happened twice

#Ryan Murphy your blood is mine

**rickikardashian** (6): i normally would be ashamed to admit that i like the glee version of a song more than the original,,,,, unless the glee version was by naya rivera and amber riley, in which case i say it loud and proud, like a proper gleek would

**avenueroy** (5.6): I'm gonna be real with y'all, the only version of this song I've heard before this was the Glee cover. I assumed that, like most of the songs on this rate, I must have heard it at some point. But no, I would have remembered this. The production on this is shockingly bad. I normally love the wall of sound but I have no idea what's going on here.  The background vocals sound like they were taken from a completely different song, some parts are almost completely drowned out, it's just not good. Tina also doesn't sound great here? I know she has a rough voice naturally but there are parts of this song where she sounds good, other parts where it sounds like she's seriously straining her vocal chords. I even listened to uploads of this on YouTube in case this was a problem with this specific version. Nope.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Where's Ike? I assumed it was a duet. Time for a little research...

**Roxieloxie** (10): I just really appreciate that Aretha gave us songs that i can both praise worship to and also throw ass too

**TiltControls** (10): Aretha has been a powerhouse in this rate with almost a quarter of the songs left so it makes a little sense that she'd lose something soon. This song though... Amazing. For a while I thought this was two separate songs cause both the chorus and verses are so iconic I didn't think a single song could hold such power. Also gotta shoutout the mirroring from the background singers on the 'Think's cause it adds so so much to the song.

---

#finally,,,, some critical thinking on this subreddit

**2dina3dworld** (10): instructions unclear, I can smell something burning

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Thought

**bbfan132** (10): :listening:

**bespectacIed** (10): This might be too niche a comment but Dr. Bailey sings this song in her head twice while she scrubs in before surgery because that's a lil more than 4 minutes and that's the standard time for a surgical scrub and i will always remember that useless Greys trivia

**celladonn** (10): This goes unbelievably hard actually

**cremeebrulee** (10): i’m sorry but everyone else is soooo set up by the fact that aretha is first on the ballot 😭

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Almost my 11! I love this Aretha song so hard. It's so catchy and love Aretha's delivery.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I 100% called this song “Freedom” until I learned it in an episode of drag race

**jsonphile** (10): FREEDOM

**ManofOranges** (10): Iconic

**NotWith10000Men** (10): it's a sign of how good this song is that I think of the commercials it's in and STILL love the song

**qazz23** (10): Like the sudden "freeeeedom!" in the chorus (11 candidate)

**rickikardashian** (10): doing this rate as a young homosexual has been so hard because i either have to admit that i know the song from Glee, or from Rupaul’s Drag Race

**rslashpoopheads** (10): my favorite Aretha song it's just so fun this came so close to getting my 11

**runaway3212** (10): I literally cannot stop giving 10s

**seanderlust** (10): you better :thots:

**slimboyfriend** (10): She sings the hell out of that Q

**trashypanini** (10): Truly a highly emotional song asking for some self reflection in another person. In this case an abuser. Aretha is a siren on this and there’s no personal reveal of forgiveness on her behalf or even an askance of admitting to any wrongdoing/violence and an subsequent apology. All she wants to know is that he/subject of the song has thought about his actions and what they do physioemotionally/mentally to her. And finally when Aretha/she gets that succinct verbalization that he knows how much he hurts her and knows that he is violent. But just doesn’t care. As any other abuser. It’ll be double self assurance on her choice escape this violence.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i can’t believe the industry is making songs smaller now to game streaming smh VERY disappointed.

**GARjuna** (9): fantastic song

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (9): Bonus point because I love The Blues Brothers

**plastichaxan** (9): :thots:

**stryxen** (9): spill

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): this is good but i have trouble relating to a song telling me to actually think. head empty, i apologize

**jman457** (8.6): Is used in too many commercials to really want to give it higher

**1998tweety** (8.5): bops a bit

**jaztinax** (8.5): american idol and pop culture ruined this song for me but it still slaps

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): If I’m being honest the only part that I really really like is when she says “FREEDOOOM!”

IIIHenryIII: > I mean at this point im litterally just bullying this persons ballot so lemme just not say anything

I feel called out, so let me try to explain... I'll just paste my response to a previous comment:

I'd like to apologise for tanking most of these songs. I think I only knew 10% percent of them. Maybe because English isn't my first language? I know this is not an excuse for a fan of pop music, but seeing the results made me really embarrassed an uncultured. I gave so many low scores to songs that y'all really seem to love. Sorry for that! I'll try to do better next time and keep an open mind!
[/r/popheads/comments/prdqum/60s_popsoul_rate_reveal_day_3_these_rate_scores/hditt7d/]

jaztinax: your opinion is your opinion! if they’re really not for you then that’s your thing, but if you want to give them another chance before making up your mind, that would be cool too! we all have preferences, you don’t have to follow the crowd to make yours 😌
[/r/popheads/comments/prdqum/60s_popsoul_rate_reveal_day_3_these_rate_scores/hdlyy1a/]

=====

IIIHenryIII: Yeah, most of these songs are really not up my alley. With this rate, I found out that I'm just not a big fan of soul, I guess. But I (re)discovered some really good jams, and I would gladly participate in another rate like this. I'd just try not to be so harsh and give the songs more chances (I listened to each one of these at least 3 times before submitting my ballot though), since some of these have really grown on me. 

Thanks for the kind reply!

**TiltControls** (10): And there she goes, back to back. Like a few of the other commenters mentioned, I actually kind of prefer Dionne's version - however this is one of Aretha's biggest songs so it would've been odd leaving it off. (Also after watching the Dionne robberies from the past two days, I don't know if I wanted to break my heart even more). Still, even though I prefer Dionne's, this is a full 10! Burt Bacharach knows how to write a damn good song. The tempo makes this stand out so well. And Aretha sounds gorgeous like always too.

**Roxieloxie** (8.5): And there goes everyones dreams of Aretha dominating the top ten, this song is such a bop

---

#Well wishes and prosperity for all

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**2dina3dworld** (10): Glee Outsold (yes, I am original)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The background singers are doing the most with this one (not a bad thing though)

**akanewasright** (10): This song literally brightens my entire life a little each time I hear it. I’d 11 this if I had a second 11 I think

**anothertown** (10): Let's just get this out of the way now, since my username is near the top alphabetically. Glee bodied this

**BB-TheBest22** (10): Aretha’s best song IMO

**bbfan132** (10): thinking of the santana/brittany/quinn cover of this

**bespectacIed** (10): Dionne is a legend but aretha breathed fire on this song, this version so much more dynamic. Also, I can't not mention when the unholy trinity covered this and ryan murphy made us believe that santana and brittany sounded like a team of black female backup singers lmaoooo. Quinn's best performance on the show though

**celladonn** (10): Why is the scene from My Best Friend's Wedding (1997) where they sing this so deeply embedded in my psyche

**cremeebrulee** (10): over/under the amount of comments mentioning glee: 12

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this specifically calls out everyone who said ‘religious themes make me like music less’ but will blast madonna till tomorrow

**fadedblue09** (10): I must have danced to this in my past life

**frogaranaman** (10): Aretha Franklin about to make me religious again

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I mixed this up with Son of a Preacher Man for the first like 20 years of my life

**jsonphile** (10): a perfect song honestly. The piano chords, the harmonies, the melodies, all comes together so beautifully

**ManofOranges** (10): The way this sounds just sounds so amazing. Something about this song also just sounds so mysterious I can't explain it.

**nootnoot781** (10): preferring the glee version should be illegal, actually

**nt96** (10): Very few pop songs can effortlessly pull off an uncommon time signature. This song pulled off TWO. Your fave could never 💅

**plastichaxan** (10): this is such an earworm or whatever you call those kind of songs that just get stuck on your head cause they sound so well

**qazz23** (10): Really like the vocals in the chorus and it's a bit less known

**rickikardashian** (10): [me trying to not mention the glee version of this song in my comment](https://i.imgflip.com/1y8rbh.jpg)

**runaway3212** (10): I wish all prayers sounded this great

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This gives me chills and was an 11 contender. It really gives a sense of painful loneliness underneath the sweet melodies, and it sounds a little bit sinister too. I can absolutely hear how the makers of Bird Box were like "let’s put this in a horror movie".

**stryxen** (10): simply perfection

**TragicKingdom1** (10): 4th place for my 11, i think this is one of the most infectious melodies of all time

**waluigiest** (10): and that’s what you missed on Glee

**welcome2thejam** (10): A chorus sent from heaven above

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): is it bad that the glee version is my 3rd most played song of 2021

**joeeswift** (9.5): is it blasphemy if I prefer the glee version?

**ignitethephoenix** (9): yes I associate this song with glee and the unholy trinity what about it

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): The first time I heard this song was on the radio the day Aretha passed away… and it definitely hit me. It’s such a great romantic track, and you can feel all the emotion she sings into it!

**seanderlust** (8.1): this is obviously a classic and i'm a huge aretha fan, but this one just never stuck out to me. it's lovely but i just can't find any strong feelings about it. if i had seen her live perhaps i would have different feelings about it.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): *Try position 22*: https://youtu.be/u-2Oj9LhDFc

**rslashpoopheads** (8): iconic

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.7): Is it blasphemy to say that I prefer Dionne Warwick’s smooth and sophisticated Burt Bacharach version?

**jman457** (7.6): Sounds more clout chasing compared to her other work

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7.5): Probably gets an extra point if it's the Dionne Warwick version

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the melody is really interesting

**trashypanini** (7): When a cover clears your barely year old song. Jokes but I know Dionne was like her again?

#Praying for better taste

**jaztinax** (6.5): glee ruined this song for me like the fandom really hyped up a mediocre sounding white girl singing this classic wtf (ily dianna agron it’s not your fault)

**bigbigbee** (6): I don’t know where to put this, so I’m going to put it on this song which I don’t have a comment for. My first introduction to Aretha as a persona (not just her music) was the movie “School of Rock” (2003), when 10-year-old Tomika is scared to sing in front of people because she’s worried that they won’t like her because she’s fat. Jack Black’s character’s response to her is NOT, “No, you’re not fat!” (a common response which, while maybe well intentioned, reinforces the idea that fat is something to avoid). Instead, he says that people don’t care about a person’s size when they have talent, as she does, and as Aretha did before her. He adds that people “worship” him onstage, BECAUSE he’s “sexy and chubby” – and NOT despite it. More discussion can be found on this tweet - https://twitter.com/hamishsteele/status/1383846077665738754 Love that movie.

**raggedy-princess** (6): Great song! but not my favorite version

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Probably a hot take but she oversings this, her raw and powerful voice doesn’t really match how tight and gentle the song is written

**TiltControls** (10): Another absolutely stellar song from the Supremes. Some listeners (or drag race fans) may be more familiar with the 80's Kim Wilde version. While it's still really really good, it doesn't match the attitude and passion given off by this song imo. The pause in instrumentation and 'and there ain't nothing I can do about it' has got to be one of my favourite moments in the rate

---

#Little Mix

**qazz23** (11): Their masterpiece. Every single thing about this is superb: melodies, harmonies, lyrics, and even a great keyboard sound

**1998tweety** (10): bop, the Kim Wilde version slays too

**AHSWeeknd** (10): they just don’t make bops like this anymore

**cremeebrulee** (10): BUT HOW CNA WE STILL BE FRIENDS!!! IF SEEING YOU BREAKS MY HEART AGAIN!!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i was gonna say ‘this is adorable’ but also why do these women/men keep undervaluing themselves please

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): This song still sounds so fresh today (Like Beggin' by the Four Seasons). So modern in its production, and the lyrics are easily a 10/10. The Supremes were something else.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): wait jk this is my favorite Supremes song. It's a tie between this and you keep me hanging on.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The covers of this are good, and do you know why they’re good? Because the original song is good. This is true of a lot of girl group songs but I love just how *pissed* they are while sounding so sweet. Like, yeah we’re telling you to get lost in the most scathing terms possible for the era but we’re gonna coo it.

**jman457** (10): the combination of the motown soul with the rising popularity of psych rock creates pop perfection

**jsonphile** (10): supremes best song sorry. Also Kim Wilde’s version is also a banger

**JunkyGS** (10): BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP BOP

**plastichaxan** (10): this song really stood the test of time, i had that 11 next to it typed out but my actual 11 just won me over so much so this comment is an apology

**runaway3212** (10): A whole banger

**stryxen** (10): 11 actually

**trashypanini** (10): Kim wilde sampling this legendary track and turning it into a electro-dance banger >>>

**welcome2thejam** (10): Do I like this song in spite of or because it occasionally sounds like it's about to launch into a special news bulletin

**seanderlust** (9.5): I really like that the environment of this song so successfully conveys the frustration and anger of the lyrics while staying within the soft, boppy sound that i'm assuming radios were more interested in at the time (disclosure: I have done like zero research on this comment so maybe that's not what they were looking for idk sometimes I just say things)

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Stop! In the name of hate

**jaztinax** (9): it was an 8 until i realized the intro panned between left and right so that obviously gives an extra point

**nootnoot781** (9): ginny lemon wouldn’t have walked off if this version was used instead

**rickikardashian** (9): i want whoever is playing that guitar to take me on a date

**ManofOranges** (8): OMG I didn't know that Kim Wilde song was a cover???

**rslashpoopheads** (8): we vibing again

**thedoctordances1940** (8): it's like great but something is missing

#5th harmony

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Not the worst but not the best

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This song is kinda… tense and uncomfortable to listen to. But maybe that’s what they were going for?

**Roxieloxie** (10): If I had a dollar for every time i hosted a rate this year where a very politically charged anthem (barely) hit the top ten i would have 2 dollars which isnt alot but its wild that it has happened twice. litterally what the fuck

**TiltControls** (9.6): Like the other Nina songs in the rate, this song is a masterclass in performance and writing. It came so so close to breaching the top 10 but unfortunately just barely fell short (I think only by a point too). A late addition to the list, I'm so glad /u/roxieloxie suggested it as I wasn't familiar at all with it beforehand. The quick and frantic piano adds a ton to the song and Nina has such a talent with writing, which this song shows that to the fullest degree.

---

#People who made me realize including this was not a mistake

**anothertown** (11): This performance is in my top 2 music history moments and it aint 2

**apatel27** (11): Wish I could give all Nina Simone tracks 11 but this has to take it for the message

**bespectacIed** (11): All of her songs in here are 11 worthy whew. I first gave it to Feeling Good but nah i can't not give it to the most powerful song of all time. Pure passion and rage. As full of profound wisdom it was in its time, it was also prophetic. Aside from nina's boldness, what the fuck, it's so embarrassing that this is still relevant today. Very embarrassing.

**celladonn** (11): Holy shit. I had actually never heard this before doing this rate but I am absolutely blown away by it

**GARjuna** (11): wow

**jman457** (11): I’ll spare yall the dissertation, but this might be a contender for one of the best songs ever made

**AHSWeeknd** (10): fucking Mississippi. Get your shit together Mississippi!

**bbfan132** (10): excellent.

**cremeebrulee** (10): she’s so frustrated and yet sounds so stunning … meanwhile i can’t talk politics without choking on my own words

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ‘this is a showtune for a show that hasn’t been written yet’ is such a good line holy shit

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): If Simone is more synonymous with Feeling Good and I put a spell on you these days, this is the song she should be synonymous with. One of the few compositions she wrote herself, the anger she poured into the lyrics was matched only by the backlash of a white America unwilling to hear her. It was a risk she took gladly - in part because the words needed to be heard and in part because she didn't give a damn about the adulation of her audience if they refused to hear and see her as she was. It's an iconic moment in her career and emblematic of so much of who she was.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I stan Nina dragging the nation

**fadedblue09** (10): Songs that act like a historical piece are always nice to hear

**frogaranaman** (10): she snapped

**Gonza\_90** (10): Facts

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok nevermind about the supremes making sad songs sounding happy, this is a black protest anthem on top of a showtune

**jsonphile** (10): yeah Alabama gets me so upset too

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Righteous Nina is best Nina.

**nt96** (10): Nina did NOT fuck around! It takes major balls to create such an unapologetic and biting song about the daunting civil disparities between races, especially given the hostile climate of the 50s-60s. Only Ms. Simone can say "fuck you" to white America in the classiest, most upbeat manner.

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (10): One of those songs that makes me think I should be listening to Nina Simone every day of my life

**plastichaxan** (10): this was an automatic 10 as soon as she said “The name of this tune is Mississippi Goddam”

**runaway3212** (10): She is such a queen for this it's amazing how brave she was for this

**seanderlust** (10): I cannot believe this song was written in under an hour. it's brilliant.

**stryxen** (10): never heard this before now one of my favourites in the rate i was loving it the whole time

**trashypanini** (10): Very show tune sounding like track detailing the feelings surrounding Anti Black/ness violence. Never heard this Nina joint (though I was aware of her radical shift in music subject/politic) and I had first absently listened but such a chilling track. The exasperation and contempt is palpable. First Time Score:

**waluigiest** (10): oh she’s a performer performer

**welcome2thejam** (10): Was about to say this sounds exactly like a showtune, but then she just straight up pointed it out for me. Really cool to listen to the live crowd on this one. Hearing them laughing with such a fun first part before the big tonal shift hits and no one's laughing then

**NotWith10000Men** (9): I loved it from the very first second. She is preaching

**rickikardashian** (9): how is this Miss Easy Pea she keeps talking about?

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Goddam indeed… I don’t think I’ve heard a protest song from this era be this… direct! Miss Simone has stated nothing but facts and I applaud her for it!

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I’ve never been a huge fan of live recordings…until I heard this one. I get it now. There’s something lost when you can’t hear the audience reacting to a performance like this. Her showmanship is incredible.

**1998tweety** (7): ok

#Sorry she didnt sum up the state of civil unrest in a simple 2 minute track for yall

**IIIHenryIII** (2): Too long!

**rslashpoopheads** (1): okay I know storytelling shit like this was really common back in the day and it's perfectly fine as a live performance but it really just does not ever work as a standalone recording

**Roxieloxie** (8): I just really love how all of these songs make me feel like im in an elegant night club

**TiltControls** (8): This song is nice! I don't really have much more to say than that. It's my last non-10 left so not sad to see it go, but also not mad it made it this far. I mentioned in the comment for I'd Rather Go Blind, but I think it's hard to fully appreciate this song after hearing it in so many places previously, but despite that - you cannot deny the vocal ability shown on this track. Just absolutely stellar.

---

#At last we've arrived at this placement

**NotWith10000Men** (11): in contention for the goat tbh

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I never thought about how “at last” is a synonym for “finally”

**akanewasright** (10): This song was on Pandora a lot on the 3 months I used pandora and it was easily my favorite of the songs I found through those stations. It’s making me feel jealous of every person in a loving relationship right now, but that’s okay, that’s not etta’s fault

**anothertown** (10): Greatest vocalist of all time!

**bbfan132** (10): ABSOLUTE classic

**bespectacIed** (10): Wedding dance staple. Btw y'all can say Bey can't act all you want but her cadillac records performances were legit!!! Etta is an unequivocable legend but she was such a hater for no reason lmao

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I've had "All I Could Do Was Cry" stuck in my head for 13 years

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Probably the most iconic vocal performance in the rate… like the way her voice just opens up on that first “at laaaaaaasssst” changed generations of singers.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): chills

**ImADudeDuh** (10): at laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaast…….. My LOOOOOOOOOOOVE has come along

**jman457** (10): A somber classic, set the tone for the next decade

**joeeswift** (10): a literal CLASSIC!!!

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): What I sing to myself whenever I open up a pint of brown butter almond brittle ice cream.

**ManofOranges** (10): Etta's voice is unparalleled to me

**runaway3212** (10): Barack Obama if you read this im free on friday pls call me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I was introduced to this song when Christina Aguilera covered in on her Stripped tour. I can definitely hear why she stans Etta so much and was so impacted by her.

**seanderlust** (10): this is such a classic I can't not give it a 10. one of my all-time favorite love songs

**skargardin** (10): wish i could relate, catcry

**vayyiqra** (10): I vaguely remember reading that this song was sung at Barack Obama's inauguration and I just learned that 1. Beyoncé sang it, which I do not remember at all and 2. Etta James was mad about it because she doesn't like Beyoncé and she threatened to "whup [Beyoncé's] ass" and derisively called Obama "the president with the big ears". Well then. That was unexpected. https://www.theguardian.com/music/2009/feb/06/beyonce-etta-james-barack-obama

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): What a belter Etta is. It’s a classic for a reason!

**orangetangerine** (9.8): One of the prettiest songs out there, IMO.

**1998tweety** (9): this is giving me drama

**jaztinax** (9): singing shows and amateur singers ruined this song but what a simple, effective song wow

**welcome2thejam** (9): Sources are pleased to confirm that, yes, that first "at last" does indeed still hit hard

**whizzer0** (9): My mother likes this one. Good taste tbh.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): see this is really good but the listening party has made this instead a rant about comic sans as a font and this is the only thing i can relate this song to i am SORRY.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Etta James has amazing instrumentals in her songs

**trashypanini** (7): A beautiful vocal by Etta and and gorgeous production to boot. The grandness and feeling of finality evokes in Ettas voice really elevate this song.

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (6.5): Sounds like a James Bond theme, and then after that kind of gets forgettable to me

#Actually dont do ipr

**cremeebrulee** (6): hopefully foreshadowing this song’s position

**IIIHenryIII** (5): When she sang, *you smile*, my mind just went, *I smile*, and I couldn't get that Justin Bieber song out of my head

**TiltControls** (10): Honestly when this rate first started I thought this would be the too-obvious winner that leaves all the other songs in the dust. The production has held up so well and the song is hard to describe as anything other than pure joy. And at the start of the rate it looked like a possible winner! However a few low scores brought it down to a still solid position in the top 10. The song is fun. Normally that might not be enough to stand among the other giants in the rate, but this song is like... another level of fun. Everything sounds so effortless here and whenever it comes on I just feel like bopping along

**Roxieloxie** (9): I also thought this was gonna sweep but luckily it did not! i think this is a pretty nice place for it

---

#Cher Lloyd

**bigbigbee** (11): This song always cheers me up. The guitar and string introduction is so well written, so joyful and infectious. In general, I think children singing is kind of meh – fine at best, cheesy or uncomfortable at worst. But something about Michael’s clear, bell like voice really adds to this song for me. I think every element of this song is perfect!

**ImADudeDuh** (11): I think that if I were to ever do karaoke, I would choose this song. Everything about it is just pop perfection in its shiniest, happiest, most perfect form. I can not spot a single flaw in this song.

**1998tweety** (10): https://youtu.be/X3H-4crGD6k

**AHSWeeknd** (10): One of the best songs ever made, and an eleven contender

**anothertown** (10): https://i.imgur.com/6qUG2LV.gif

**bbfan132** (10): probably the first song i heard here

**bespectacIed** (10): what a talented kid i hope he has a bright future

**CrimsonROSET** (10): tori vega war criminal? get back to you on this one

**frogaranaman** (10): I mean of course

**ignitethephoenix** (10): classic which will probably just miss out on winning cause a child is singing (even if that child is Michael Jackson)

**jaztinax** (10): the intro gets me hyped every. time.

**jman457** (10): timeless classic, that intro always gives me life

**ManofOranges** (10): CLASSIC!!! And a strong 11 contender!!

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconique

**runaway3212** (10): Michael Jackson always spilling

**skargardin** (10): thinking of that one friend in middle school that was absolutely obsessed with the jackson 5 and this song in particular

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Yeah I can understand finding michael's vocals annoying here but the song is just too much of a bop not to love. also fuck you u/stryxen

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I am NEVER forgiving popheads for making me realize how much of an asshole Michael sounds like in this song… well fuck you, this still slaps

**waluigiest** (10): literally who hurt him? He’s like 7

**whizzer0** (10): Hard to deny how fun this is.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.6): Classic for obvious reasons, and well-deserved. I do recommend giving a try to David Ruffin’s version of the song just because of how interesting it is to hear two different icons respective takes on a track like this

**2dina3dworld** (9): Trina Vega could sing “I Want You Back” but could Michael Jackson sing “Chicago”?

**akanewasright** (9): undeniably joyful

**TragicKingdom1** (9): lil romeo outsold

**trashypanini** (9): An iconic vocal performance and a prodigy being a prodigy lmao. I’ve probably heard this song 12 million times from my dads Motown 25 tape and it always got me moving no matter what. Such powerful and moving vocals that get you singing along.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Bit of an overplay victim, but hell if that ain't an all-timer chorus

**GARjuna** (8.4): jesus is this michael????

**orangetangerine** (8.2): This song never fails to put a smile on my face!

**nt96** (8): I predict that this one's a top 5 contender

**plastichaxan** (7.8): fun but it’s a child yelling i had to take points off

**seanderlust** (7.6): this is a bop but also, girl don't take him back

#Tori vega i know its you

**IIIHenryIII** (6): The instrumental is remarkable, but I just can't stand his voice. Don't @me for not liking a kid's voice. It's one of those songs that improves with a cover

**NotWith10000Men** (6): so was no one back then like "yo this is a tiny child singing and we're down with this??"

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (5): One for each Jackson, they've never done anything for me

**fadedblue09** (1): Iconic? Yeah but compared to the rest of this list it's sooo grating.

**stryxen** (0): i always found all the vocals really grating like even the background vocals i’m not sure why (i’m sorry)

**Roxieloxie** (10): I remember my 9th grade english project we had to make mixtapes for of mice and men and the results were absolutely batshit. But specifically 4 different people used this song. ( for anyone wondering my list included such acclaimed artist as twenty one piolots, zayn and fall out boy)

**TiltControls** (10): hey look its that song i put into a rate once covered by a sub favourite and watched it go out day 1. Anyways, though I like the Florence version, it doesn't really come close to topping the original. Like Dock of the Bay - there's just some calming nature to this song that puts me in a good mood whenever I listen to it.

---

#Standing together <3

**akanewasright** (11): …this is making me really miss someone I love right now

**IIIHenryIII** (11): One of my favorite songs ever. Being featured in the soundtrack of my favorite movie makes me just appreciate it even more

**vayyiqra** (11): One time I was with my girlfriend in a restaurant in 2009 or so and they played a lot of retro music and this song came on and we both kind of chuckled because this song is a little corny but also it's a great song?? It's dramatic but it works because it's sung so beautifully. Listen to those strings, they're amazing. It's just a perfect song.

**welcome2thejam** (11): There's a lot of 11 contenders on this list, but in my heart, I think it was only ever gonna be this one. Might be as close to perfection as a song can get.

**whizzer0** (11): I've been listening to Dominique Fils-Aimé's cover from her album this year a lot (please listen to her!) but the original is just so captivating.

**1998tweety** (10): now come on

**bbfan132** (10): love the rhythm here

**bespectacIed** (10): I refuse to believe Yesterday is the most covered song of all time when this exists. So iconic and a literal cultural landmark

**bigbigbee** (10): This piece was the cornerstone of my first “music composition / arrangement / theory” class in middle school. It’s a classic for a reason – beautiful in its simplicity. (The other song I remember from that class is Johnny B Goode, which is another stone cold classic that we should rate!)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): just a transcendent song

**frogaranaman** (10): great film btw

**ignitethephoenix** (10): another absolute classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): JR! Sean Kingston!

**jsonphile** (10): I’ve still never forgiven Sean Kingston for using this song in his awful “beautiful girls”

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): The Tracy Chapman tribute to Ben E. King on Letterman is wonderful as well.

**ManofOranges** (10): You gotta love the way the strings just continue to build in this one

**NotWith10000Men** (10): good lord those strings are godly

**runaway3212** (10): this one is for you florence

**skargardin** (10): timeless classic yup

**thedoctordances1940** (10): absolutely amazing, a cultural reset

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Sorry Florence (and Noctis?), I love you but the original is by far the superior version!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): this better be score higher than flo

**AHSWeeknd** (9): NOT THE WHITE KIDS DANCING LIKE THAT IN THE VIDEO WTF

**celladonn** (9): I love Final Fantasy XV

**jaztinax** (9): this is my ultimate childhood song!!

**rickikardashian** (9): [me standing by him](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/76/0b/28/760b2802f4dfe9ff443a1f202d8881d3.jpg)

**orangetangerine** (8.9): Why is this guy covering Prince Royce? Lol jk, this is such a timeless song, simple chord progression, lovely string interlude.

**seanderlust** (8.5): the laundry list of songs sampling this...iconique

**CrimsonROSET** (8): there’s probably a really good musical reality show performance of this but it wasn’t by kelly clarkson so i don’t remember their name

**fadedblue09** (8): Can't believe this sub made me listen to the Florence cover of this

#The kids in my 9th grade english class 

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I'm sorry but I've heard this song literally hundreds of thousands of times in my life and I cannot rate it any higher

**trashypanini** (6.5): The rasp of Kings voice and pulsing orchestrated instruments make this a sweet ballad. I’ve heard this many times and the thought is endearing about weathering the storm with someone. But it doesn’t allow for the speaker/man in this song to be anything other than a automaton of the protector (self imposed by men in a patriarchal society) figure who’s gonna be all right as long as he has his woman still there🥴.

**jman457** (6.1): Irritates me a bit

**GARjuna** (6): this was played a lot in high school band

**joeeswift** (6): I think I may have overplayed this at some point because it just isn't hitting the same

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's all right

**plastichaxan** (4): maybe misandry but this reminds me of english classes at school where we would have to listen to this on loop until everyone completed the missing lyrics and my classmates were not good

**2dina3dworld** (2): there’s just this weird off beat quality to it that doesn’t quite mesh with my ears. Idk, it’s weird but it really wrecks the song for me.

**Roxieloxie** (11): God I wish this song did better, I've heard this song all my life in various black history month presentations or movies ( god the scene in spike lees' malcom x with this is so good) but it wasnt until my freshman year where i got assigned to write a group essay on a song and we got this song that i really learned about the very intentional historical context behind this song. Its absolutely a bittersweet stunning work of art

**TiltControls** (10): Yeah I know this came 7th in a field of amazing competitors, but is it weird I still kind of wish it did better? Just barely not cracking 9 avg is a travesty. This was my 2nd choice for an 11. Not only are the lyrics iconic and super meaningful in the context of the era, but Sam just does such such a good job at conveying their emotion.

---

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): his voice!! the violins!! why does this song make me feel emotional!!

**seanderlust** (11): from that first "I was born by the river" lyric, I am ascended

**skargardin** (11): There are obviously tens of songs that are 11 worthy, but I would really like to see this in particular do as well as possible.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): finally settled on this for the 11 because it's the all around package: incredible vocals, production, lyrics, melody, etc etc there are no flaws whatsoever

**twinfiresigns14** (11): Jesus, where does this man get his voice? The instrumentation here is stunning.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Crying at the club rn

**BB-TheBest22** (10): the most important song for the civil rights movement

**bbfan132** (10): absolute classic, one of the most iconic songs ever

**bespectacIed** (10): everyone who wronged sam are simmering in hell rn

**bigbigbee** (10): Sam Cooke’s Story is so incredibly tragic and it’s incredibly bittersweet listening to this lovely song about hope and knowing that his life would be cut short long before he could see any change to his world. At the same time, it is so beautifully written – the honesty of his words and the gravitas of his performance makes me want to believe that our future will be better. And allowing myself to just be comforted by this song is a wonderful escape from a world where everything else points to the contrary.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Relevant!

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): The legend himself. To me there are few - if any - male voices that have lived up to the King of Soul himself, and I can't imagine anyone truly capturing his magic again. And this song is without a doubt his essential offering. He didn't write many songs (at least compared to how many he sang), but even if he'd only ever written this one, he'd go down as a brilliant lyricist.

**jsonphile** (10): One of the best social justice songs out there

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Cooke’s voice absolutely destroys me.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): oh my god this is gorgeous

**runaway3212** (10): I really hope it comes soon

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): this was almost my 11 but i love otis too much, but wowwwww what a song

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): It’s one thing to make a song with a meaningful message, and another thing to make a song sound good, and this tune thankfully excels at both!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hell of a performance. Even after all that's happened in my lifetime, that it can still fill me with a sense of hope is something else.

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): learning that Greta Van Fleet have a cover of this took 2 years off my life

**jman457** (9.2): Slut for some strings

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): “I Know Where I’ve Been” from *Hairspray* bites a lot from this and maybe a hot take but I think it refines it quite a bit. Still, really powerful song

**waluigiest** (9): the brass is amazing

**whizzer0** (9): I think I'm hooked on Sam Cooke now.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Such an amazing voice

**trashypanini** (8.5): *archivist voice* the contemporary flip betwixt two Black teens on the social media digital forum contained with 7 second clips of such a record is perfect exploration on the psyche of Blackness. Naur it’s true! Score:

**1998tweety** (8): shes nice

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't love this song in of itself but have to respect it greatly for the historical context around it.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I appreciate the story behind this but it's nowhere near Fast Car levels in terms of being emotionally effective. I was supposed to score this lower but I felt bad after seeing

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): you said it my man

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I kinda like his voice

**stryxen** (6): cutesy

**TiltControls** (10): First off [2], fuck Phil Spector. Anyways, even ignoring the impact this song had (just ask Brian Wilson about that) - this song is just a fun listen. Plenty of songs have done the 'Wall of Sound' after this, but I think this one has pulled it off most effectively. It's not hard to see why this was almost immediately recognized as a classic.


---

#Savage remix

**BB-TheBest22** (11): that production tho

**cherryices** (11): brian wilson had the right idea about this song

**ManofOranges** (11): Fuck Phil Spector Ronnie Spector is skinny

**nt96** (11): One of the very finest pop songs of all time. I just hope people don’t blindly hate it just cuz of Phil Spector. This will forever belong to The Ronettes, PERIOD.

**1998tweety** (10): stan Wonder Girls

**2dina3dworld** (10): ah, the classic wall of sound. Here it works, but there are many places where it doesn’t.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an eleven contender, this is an insane bop.

**akanewasright** (10): This song is a lot lighter than some of my other 10s, but it’s absolutely perfect and made maybe the most drum pattern of all time

**anothertown** (10): r/Popheads in 1963 mass-coordinating hate letters because "Sugar Shack" by Jimmy Gilmer and the Fireballs blocked Be My Baby from number 1 for three straight weeks. Meanwhile PHCJ is like "stream It’s My Party"

**bbfan132** (10): there’s a reason why this is seen as one of the best songs ever

**celladonn** (10): Bop bop bop bop bop

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): The only reason I didn't give this an 11 is because Nina Simone was here, and Nina will ALWAYS deserve more recognition than she gets. For those of us who have heard everything that's come in the wake of Phil Spector and his wall of sound, it's impossible to truly understand how innovative this song felt when it came out. Brian Wilson of Beach Boys fame literally had to pull his car over when he first heard it on the radio because he was shocked and just had to absorb every sound of what he was hearing. He dissected the song and its instruments, started producing music, and spent his entire career chasing that song and feeling like his output never quite lived up to it. I can't really name another Ronnette's song, but I can't imagine not having ever heard this one.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): If I wasn't such a Nina stan this is a deserving 11. This song changed music forever! It's so sweet and lovable, and the whole experience is incredibly lush and euphoric.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Phil Spector is rotting in hell yas

**jsonphile** (10): okay first off fuck Phil Spector rot in hell second this song is amazing

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Bruce Springsteen said it best: the secret to Phil Spector’s “Wall of Sound” was youth; the sound of talented young people, still brimming with life, optimism and energy - words that perfectly describe this song.

**plastichaxan** (10): this is so catchy and cute yass

**qazz23** (10): one of the greatest pop songs, iconic drum beat (11 candidate)

**runaway3212** (10): me @ literally every hot guy I see

**stryxen** (10): WOW

**TragicKingdom1** (10): some of the best pop production OF ALL TIME!!! 3rd place for my 11

**welcome2thejam** (10): awwight i'll be ur widdle baby uwu

**orangetangerine** (9.9): This is one of the songs I think of when I think of 60's music.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): afaik this is not a christmas song but I think I've always listened to this around christmas time so it's now ingrained in my mind that this is a christmas song. Regardless of that it is an absolutely amazing song

**jman457** (9): Iconic song methinks

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (9): I think it's probably a bit overrated but still a great song

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): reminds me of christmas because of love actually lmao

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): [Billboard did a list of the best 100 girl group songs](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7857816/100-greatest-girl-group-songs) and put this at number one… I can’t say I necessarily disagree with their reasoning but there are several songs on this list alone that I’d place before it. It’s a shame that Phil Spector was such a massively terrible person, but at least he actually went to rot in jail for his crimes.

**trashypanini** (8.5): A classic! Gets you singing along. And a plead for companionship. Defo some pick me vibes but a banger is a banger. The production is an ear worm and builds in the same melodious way.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): there HAS to be a tiktok dance to this right

**IIIHenryIII** (8): This feels like a grower. The beat is really fun

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): cute!

**avenueroy** (7.5): THE blueprint. But maybe a little overrated.

**seanderlust** (7.5): i'm sorry but the album title "Presenting The Fabulous Ronettes Featuring Veronica" is hilarious. like this album is by these fabulous women...and veronica.

#say so  remix

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): She’s cute… but I hope I’m not alone in thinking that the Wall of Sound production has honestly not aged well

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): this is straight out of a musical

**jaztinax** (5): something about the wall of sound production makes me so uneasy. maybe just because i know phil spector is behind it. but also everything about this song gives me the creeps, especially the harmonies.. it has a 5 only because it’s catchy

**Motm-track9** (3.5): another annoying song

**bespectacIed** (2): Breaking my high scores only to girl groups rule because truly dislike this.... it's too basic and grating in the grand scheme of 60s excellence. Ronnie is a legend btw, I feel bad but ykw i actually don't. I know this will place high cause it's often regarded as the most iconic girl group song of all time and I vehemently DIGRESS wtf. i still can't believe

**Roxieloxie** (10): Oh man i love this song! I remember it was absolutely SWEEPING in the start and I thought we had found our winner early on but it fell from grace. 

**TiltControls** (10): And so we lose our last girl group song, and honestly, this is the right choice for the top spot. It's my favourite Supremes hit by far and was another consideration for the 11 (although the others are still 10s). Diana Ross just makes everything seem so effortless. There's just this innocence and bounce to the song that makes me think 'you know what, maybe I can wait for love!' This was another song that looked like it was winning for a while, before dropping a bit in the middle

---

#Waiting patiently 

**slimboyfriend** (11): This song makes me emotional because Diana Ross's mom IS right! You CAN'T hurry love! You DO just have to wait! But how long MUST I wait? How much more CAN I take?

**thedoctordances1940** (11): what can i say, it just puts a massive smile on my face

**1998tweety** (10): they just don't miss

**2dina3dworld** (10): I swear the bassline in this and the bassline in “Are You Gonna be My Girl?” by Jet are the same thing.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an eleven contender, but which Supremes song isn’t?

**akanewasright** (10): Wait yass a supremes song I can listen to without accidentally glamorizing codependency!

**BB-TheBest22** (10): That melody is one of the greatest ever

**bbfan132** (10): classic [infinity]

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic intro, iconic song, iconic voice. Idk why but this encapsulates the breeziness of the 60s music the most, this is really THEE supremes song.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I think this is my favorite Supremes song. It's so beautiful and winsome.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): just a real cute song

**ManofOranges** (10): It's true it's true

**nt96** (10): The SURPREME Supremes song. Anyone who doesn't dance to this has no soul.

**qazz23** (10): One of the greatest melodies ever (11 candidate)

**rslashpoopheads** (10): iconic but also somehow still underrated

**runaway3212** (10): one word; iconic

**welcome2thejam** (10): Even the Phil Collins version is a bop, that's how good this song is

**cremeebrulee** (9.9): ok fair but im not getting any younger so can we hurry it tf up now xx

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.5): Jesus The Supremes put out some monster bops.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): probably my bias here cause I did a recital dance to this when I was 7 but this may be my favourite by them. Edit: hmm maybe not on another listen

**jackisboredtoday** (9): this one has a more upbeat feel than the other singles The Supremes have here, which makes sense with the lyrics but I do kinda like a lot of the others better I think

**plastichaxan** (9): taking one point off for making me wish for a man for a few minutes too

**skargardin** (9): Words to live by honestly, it's oddly comforting

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I can see how some may find this… a tad annoying, but all it does is fill me with joy!

**seanderlust** (8.8): mama spilled tbh

**anothertown** (8): They were in their romantic comedy montage era

**frogaranaman** (8): I love how the 60s literally just wrote songs lyrics like they were newspaper advice columns

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Not bad

#people on tinder who have those pictures of them holding a fish

**CrimsonROSET** (7): girl your mom lied to you

**NotWith10000Men** (7): okay this is cute and has some energy

**Roxieloxie** (10): you can either be a natural woman or a dangerous one

**TiltControls** (10): Vocally this might be might favourite song in the rate. Carole King is a masterful writer, but this song would not be anything without those vocals. The chorus... wow. I don't even know what to say. Just an absolute masterclass in performance.

---

#hotties

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Such a triumphant song and such a force of nature singing it… and the Kennedy Center Honors performance remains one of the best live performances by ANY artist EVER

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why am I crying at the club?

**akanewasright** (10): Flashback to when Mariah Carey was visibly angry at Celine Dion for oversinging when they performed this with Aretha at a big tribute event

**anothertown** (10): DAE kelly clarkson whistle note

**bbfan132** (10): feel like i’m floating while listening to this

**bespectacIed** (10): washed that forever old white girl in her own song lmao. Aretha owns this.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): santino disappointed face dot gif

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): I'm a man ass man (okay a gay ass man) and when this song comes on I turn it up and belt along because Ms Franklin takes me there.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): The day after it aired, my mom watched the version where Aretha performed for Carole King at the Kennedy Center Honors for 3 hours straight. She's the original stan! To get sentimental, my mom tells me she used to listen to all this 60's soul music on a little transistor radio in Jamaica with a shaky connection to some UK station that would play these songs. She fell in love with all this music and felt all the black pride in the music and it inspired her to come to America.

**fadedblue09** (10): Timeless classic.

**frogaranaman** (10): another Aretha classic, wow

**GARjuna** (10): god this is gorgeous. Strong 11 contender

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is her best song easily, just an absolute perfect build up and also her vocals are amazing as usual

**ImADudeDuh** (10): FUCK this song is so fucking good. I sing this when driving on the backroads of my town so much. This was my 2nd choice of an 11.

**jman457** (10): Her performance a couple of years ago at the Kennedy center for Carol King. Skinny Legends only

**jsonphile** (10): one of the few songs that can make me tear up. Look up her performance of this song at the Kennedy Center Honors, it’s genuinely amazing. Even in her 70s she was still incredible. So close to getting my 11

**ManofOranges** (10): Beautiful

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I definitely did a stank face when the chorus hit. I have a feeling that will be a common occurrence in this rate

**plastichaxan** (10): i know this isn't probably right but all i can think about is Latrice's lipsync to this song on drag race it's just too good

**rickikardashian** (10): for the 2:25 minutes that this song lasts, i AM indeed a natural woman, a beautiful one while we’re at it

**seanderlust** (10): this is so emotionally charged. this really should be the gold standard of love songs

**slimboyfriend** (10): When I listen to this song I am everyone in the audience at Aretha's Kennedy Center Honors performance

**TragicKingdom1** (10): runner-up for my 11, the best vocals in the rate probably

**vayyiqra** (10): I have a vivid memory of playing a concert and this hipster guy who I didn't like was doing a cover of this song for solo piano and he sang it very well but also it was cringe because it's a guy singing this classic song and making it into an ironic joke. Pretty dumb ! Anyway it's a great song.

**waluigiest** (10): obviously a masterpiece, but I was floored when I had the realization that Dangerous Woman is a direct homage to this (chorus borrows words and melodies, both in 6/8, etc)

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.5): Such a great and powerful buildup of a song.

**runaway3212** (9): I am jealous ignore my score

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): even all the dudes on my cross country team knew this one

**jaztinax** (8): the amount of people who have covered this song thinking they could do it… the answer is always no you can’t

**orangetangerine** (7.2): It's a pretty dull song on its own but Aretha absolutely and totally elevates it to a classic. Carole King is one of my all-time favorite songwriters but I think Aretha's version, and also Mary J. Blige's version which feels like an updated 90's carbon copy, are the only acceptable versions of it. I'm not even going to address Rod Stewart's turd of a cover of this song.

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7): I've heard Tapestry so many times that hearing someone other than Carole King sing this feels wrong tbh

**trashypanini** (7): a soaring uplifting ballad about being loved in all the right ways. The joy is palpable and there’s a lot of repeat measures. So it’s got some of that church feel of repetition for exclamation of a point. And I know Aretha was talking about how he give the good good. The “you make me feel so good inside” line is double enchilada mhm yup.

#*sigh*

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I pass

**TiltControls** (10): And after the dominate performance displayed by Aretha on day 3 it's finally time to say goodbye. Really the top 3 of this rate got so far ahead of the rest of the pack it was only ever a competition between those 3 for most of the rate. Unfortunately Respect never could pull ahead into that first place spot (mostly due to the lack of 11s compared to the other two), but it put up an excellent fight along the way. Anyways for the song itself. Perfection. I don't know what else to say. Aretha's got that ability to emote perfectly through her music and has the pipes to back it up. There's a good reason that Rolling Stone found this as the greatest song of all time (though funny enough, the neither of the current top 2 is on that list).

**Roxieloxie** (8): Very shocked that this never hit first place!!! Another absolute classic.

#TragicKingdom in 80s pop boys

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**2dina3dworld** (10): do not be afraid to demand a lot of respect, people. It’s what you deserve. Don’t settle for a little bit, settle for a lot and not any less.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Bestie isn’t even asking for too much respect, just a little bit

**akanewasright** (10): This is kinda one of those recordings that you can’t deny. Like everything about it is just kinda… perfect?

**anothertown** (10): Otis Redding's original is on one of the best soul albums of all time but compared to this it sounds like an unfinished demo. Just insane

**bbfan132** (10): tbt when i sang this at the american idol karaoke thing at madame tussauds in nyc when i was 6

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic. Taught me how to spell. Aretha queen of taking other ppl's songs and making it better that everybody thinks the songs belong to her and her alone

**cremeebrulee** (10): THEE girlboss anthem (gaslight is walk on by and gatekeep is mississippi goddamn)

**CrimsonROSET** (10): have y’all drank your respect women juice today

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Love that Aretha invented feminism, thank u queen

**frogaranaman** (10): I mean how could this not be a ten is my question

**GARjuna** (10): fuck I love this chorus drop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is what I expect will win the rate.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the boring winner this time but there’s no debating how legendary and classic is so I will happily give it a 10 and let it make a run at the win

**jaztinax** (10): the most iconic cover to exist

**jman457** (10): an actual classic, that works as both as a karaoke staple and proclamation of Black Womenhood

**jsonphile** (10): when Aretha demands respect, you give her that respect. And when she sings this good she deserves it. Also queen of spelling before Gwen Stefani or Fergie ever even born

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Here’s an travesty of a fact: Aretha Franklin only got to #1 on the Hot 100 twice in her career - this and her duet with George Michael.

**ManofOranges** (10): Back in high school, we played a piece at a few concerts that was just made up of arrangements of Aretha Franklin songs and this one always got the crowd bumpin I swear

**rickikardashian** (10): hey kids, spelling is fun

**rslashpoopheads** (10): it's so fascinating to me how the RESPECT part happens once only at the very end of the song and yet it's one of the most iconic and recognizable song lines of all time Aretha's power

**runaway3212** (10): Celine Dion this one is for you

**seanderlust** (10): you know a song is good when people are shocked to find out it's a cover. no disrespect to otis redding but she really knocked this out of the park. i mean, name a more iconic call and response.

**skargardin** (10): this reminds me of that i need to watch RESPECT

**vayyiqra** (10): That iconic line near the end and the based political undertones of this song always made me like this song and think "hey this is pretty cool".

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I am now a malewife

**waluigiest** (10): I mean, it’s one of the most iconic songs of human history.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): does this need an explanation

**orangetangerine** (9.4): Quintessential soul song.

**bigbigbee** (9): I have gone to too many weddings to give this a perfect score…and I’ve only gone to like four weddings. This song goes on repeat when the band gets tired, let me tell you…but it really is great, I’m just a little tired of it

**dance\_apoptosistic** (9): I love the gender switch of her version, and she outdid Otis Redding. Who does that? Iconic.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Spelling is fun kids!

**trashypanini** (9): This was an entire decade where Aretha was just gobbling up covers of other folks. Truly the definitive version. The busted ass misogynistic OG by Otis got cleared. It’s funny cause he was like “yeah hers is better” he really should’ve just sat and ate his food in the first place. Her rendition is uber covered but it’s anthemic and it hits extra harder if you see it as a rapport between a Black man and woman.

**nt96** (8): this song is gonna win isn't it....

**welcome2thejam** (8): If I could somehow hear this with fresh ears, it'd probably be an 11 contender. But unfortunately, it's probably this rate's biggest victim of overuse and overplay wringing any emotion I had for this song dry. Still clearly a quality track tho, and still giving it a high score

#Kappy in 80s pop boys

**stryxen** (7.5): i had this as a 10 at first but the more i listened to other songs here i realised this is nowhere near my favourites, still an excellent excellent excellent song


**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): Hey, kids! Spelling is fun!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I wanna go back to the reality where this was winning the rate. 

**TiltControls** (10): For a good amount of the rate we were preparing ourselves for a Nina victory. Though it only ever held a 3-5 point lead over the runner up, she always just managed to keep holding on. Unfortunately for her the tides switched in the last weekend of ballots and she couldn't catch back up. And for the song... wow. That's really all I can say. The horns, her vocal delivery, the iconic opening... it all comes together perfectly. I love Ain't No Mountain as well so I'm not mad at the winner, but I would've loved to be in a world where we could have given the crown to Nina. Also there will never be a cover that can outmatch this.

---

**bbfan132** (11): so fucking good

**dance\_apoptosistic** (11): It was hard to decide between this and I put a spell on you as the 11 I wanted to give. Both songs are so iconic, so Simone. Even though her prodigious piano playing takes backseat here, her voice and its ability to truly take you there soar. I mean she even SCATS with an intensity and emotion that causes you to live up to the tile of the song regardless of how you were feeling when you turned it on. It's also one of the standouts in her discography for its optimism and happy vibes - a marked contrast with a lot of her angrier and sadder songs she executed equally as brilliantly

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): NINA DID THAT. (also S12nnerman--I blanked on this song during the indieheads 60s submissions and everyday I'm in pain thinking about that) So dramatic, evocative and POWERFUL. I grew up with all the music here, mainly the Sam Cooke, Supremes, Aretha, etc. A lot of it was so light and fun, which I still love. The only one I didn't listen to until later was Nina, in high school. I hadn't heard before such a commanding, powerful low voice sing with such power and pain. "Four Women"??? omg. Her music has had such an impact on me I can't even begin to describe.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Stunningly jawdropping and gorgeous, people in the 60's would've fucking DIED when those horns came in

**stryxen** (11): i just had a wonderful conversation with a friend

**waluigiest** (11): a completely classic gorgeous stunning song. This orchestration is next level.

**2dina3dworld** (10): Michael Buble? Outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (10): One of the best songs ever made. Period.

**akanewasright** (10): There are some recordings in this rate that I consider just absolutely perfect and timeless and classic (which is probably influenced by their use in media but still). This is 100% one of those, and one of my favorites of those

**anothertown** (10): What is it about this song that has invited the most dark sided covers, samples, tv/commercial features lol

**bespectacIed** (10): One of my most admired women in history. Nina's powerful lower register, the horns, the anthemic lyrics, everything about this is bone-chilling. There's something so empowering about the liberation and hopefuless of this song when you remember everything Nina stood for and fought for. Rest in power, always.

**bigbigbee** (10): Extremely timeless song. Some of these songs I’ve heard so much that they grate on me a little bit even though they’re objectively classics. This song is nothing like that – I could listen to this on loop still. It’s incredible, sultry, dark, and the intro is one of the most iconic ever, I think?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the superior song about feeling good in this rate

**GARjuna** (10): the instrumental coming in is INCREDIBLE

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song was actually written for a musical called *The Roar Of The Greasepaint - The Smell Of The Crowd*, a bizarre show that strangely spawned several pop hits! The entire show is like, an extended metaphor about the characters competing in the game of life, and this song is sung by a character called “The Negro” who sings it to celebrate winning the game. It was very much meant to be a song about liberation and tbh it makes me uncomfortable when I see white people singing it because I think it erases an important part of what the song is trying to convey.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I know this isn’t meant to be sexy, but those horns that go off right after she goes “and i’m feeling good,” whew

**jaztinax** (10): iconic arrangement

**jman457** (10): Many have attempted to reach the vocal heights she has reached her but, many have failed

**joeeswift** (10): full body chills when the instrumental kicks in...wow

**jsonphile** (10): this song is such a vibe. I don’t know what that vibe is, but I know that this song is it and no other song has ever come close

**NotWith10000Men** (10): not sure why it took me so long to realize that the reason I know so many of these songs from old people commercials is because marketing ppl actually know what they're doing

**plastichaxan** (10): every girly that has ever covered this… why… there’s no way anyone can get close to what Nina did here

**rickikardashian** (10): this is the best bond song by far and it's not even a bond song

**rslashpoopheads** (10): idk what it's called when they press the same 2 piano keys over and over again really fast but it's my favorite thing

**runaway3212** (10): THIS IS SO FUCKING PERFECT I LOVE THIS OMFG

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): if I could give multiple 11s to Nina I would

**skargardin** (10): an 11 contender if there ever was one

**slimboyfriend** (10): Nina's songs really stand out from all these cute little pop hits

**thedoctordances1940** (10): I remember doing this with my little school band but it was the muse version and we were shit but at least i was doing keyboard and bass guitar so I probably looked _really_ cool 😎

**welcome2thejam** (10): This is just so obviously good I don't know what else you could say

**whizzer0** (10): why have I listened to the avicii remix more than this this is incredible

**1998tweety** (9): omg the drama

**fadedblue09** (9): Loses a point for that weird gibberish part

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the band here is just amazing, this may have my favorite production out of any song here

**trashypanini** (7.5): A classic track. Nina’s voice is rich and full of power. She’s careful in her voice use and doesn’t get too dynamic in here. The instrumentation has that full band classical quality that just makes this such a perfect epic of a song. It’s a release of breath.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I really like the instruments. Not a fan of her voice

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’m so sorry popheads I know I’m disrespecting the queen but I need to be honest with myself, this sounds like a Disney villain song, and not in a good way

**TiltControls** (10): And here we've got our winner!! The song was doing amazingly for most of the rate but really managed to pick up steam near the end and pull ahead. I don't have much more to say compared to my comment on their other (and still superior imo) duet in the rate, but this is still an amazing song and a fantastic winner for the rate. Like with 'You're All I Need' there's a level of optimism here that's so nice to hear (especially with some of the lyrically iffy songs about relationships in the rate). Despite some unexpected early eliminations on Marvin's other songs, I'm glad we could give Marvin and Tammi a strong finish.

**Roxieloxie** (8): Not the winner I wanted, but i cant be too mad at it, its a classic for a reason! What a lovely song. 

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Easiest eleven I’ve ever given. This song is pure joy distilled, thanks in no small part to the voices of Gaye and Terrell. Their chemistry on this track is obviously legendary, but putting that aside and looking at the bones of the song it still remains just as powerful. One thing that I really appreciate about it is that the song isn’t strictly romantic, it’s almost religious in a way but to tie it to any sort of conventional spiritualism would only inhibit it because really because the feelings of love and devotion it expresses are truly universal. Regardless of what we believe about love or Go, I think we all have someone in our lives-a lover/friend/family member-that we’d do anything for, and this song makes accomplishing the most impossible feats sound simply effortless if they’re done from such pure intentions. And even better is it’s a *duet*; these feelings are made to be shared. [Diana Ross](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5_pmKPWLBrE) made it into a slow burn spoken word poem, [*Sister Act 2*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U39DJ8bSGfg) transformed it into a joyous group experience, [Jennifer Hudson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=74AAkqYmq1o) made it into a dance track, I butcher it like once a week alone in my room, but no matter who’s singing it the language and spirit of this song transcend from a deeper place and lift us up in the way that only the best music does. But yeah, anyways, if you need me call me...

**Gonza\_90** (11): This is possibly the most beautiful song ever recorded

**ignitethephoenix** (11): yeah this is definitely a top 3 song in the rate

**jackisboredtoday** (11): There ain’t no mountain high, no valley low, no song good enough to stop this from being a surprisingly easy 11 for me

**jsonphile** (11): one of the best love songs ever written. One of the best duets ever written. One of the best songs ever written. No, one of the best things to exist in the observable universe. I just love this song so much

**JunkyGS** (11): My favorite song from my childhood and one of my favorites of all time. Too many memories of singing and dancing to this song as a kid with my mom.

**JustinJSrisuk** (11): Incredible, such a joyous song. Gaye and Terrell have such amazing vocal chemistry together. It’s a bittersweet listen because one can’t help but imagine how both of these incredibly talented artists would die tragically and far before their time.

**NewAccountNow** (11): Many songs in this rate are fantastic it's just that this songs stands above the rest for me. It's an absolute classic by two greats that is unforgettable. i tried not to give many songs just 9s or 10s and this was a 10 immediately.

**1998tweety** (10): classic, the chorus makes me ascend

**2dina3dworld** (10): ain’t no mountain high enough to keep me from giving this song a well deserved 10

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wonder if this song was released today, would they change “mountain” to “building”? Cause you know capitalism and stuff

**bbfan132** (10): one of the best duets ever

**bespectacIed** (10): this is good but diana's version >>>>>>

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://i.imgur.com/grU5w4w.jpg

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): The bassline and singing are unmatched here. RIP Tammi, gone too soon!!

**frogaranaman** (10): this is the obvious winner but also it’s a great choice so I cannot be mad

**ImADudeDuh** (10): sometimes I think about Tammi Terrell and just get sad :(

**jaztinax** (10): rip to me as a freshman in high school getting the sheet music for this song in vocal group class and being so excited to sing this until i read “‘cause with jesus, there’s ain’t no mountain-” and being so disappointed lmao

**plastichaxan** (10): they maximized their joint slay here

**qazz23** (10): Classic, love the vocals and bassline (11 candidate)

**seanderlust** (10): cute duet! both of them serve so well here

**vayyiqra** (10): This song used to get everyone lit in high school in the 2000s and it's not hard to see why. It's a banger.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): One of THE classics. And for good reason, the use of geographical and natural barriers to describe the size and scope of their love is just so evocative and powerful… at least that’s the impression I got when I first heard it as a kid!

**waluigiest** (10): it’s just pure bliss

**welcome2thejam** (10): The power of this duet can move mountains, I tell ya

**orangetangerine** (9.2): When I think of upbeat 60's soul this song comes to mind as absolutely quintessentially representative of the genre.

**akanewasright** (9): Okay but that chorus though

**rslashpoopheads** (9): like river deep mountain high but not quite as amazing

**runaway3212** (9): love perservering trough it all is super sweet

**stryxen** (9): iconic actually

**NotWith10000Men** (8.6): I knew I knew this song already but it still unlocked some memory deep in my brain

**jman457** (8.3): a classic, but the Diana Ross version outsold

**trashypanini** (7.5): first things first Tammi rest in power. They were such a iconic duo with so much more to give. Lovely duet and the template for how to duet without a doubt. I’m more in love in the back in forth than the production.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I’m Groot

AHSWeeknd: This was such an amazing rate, ty to the hosts! We gotta do more vintage rates!
[/r/popheads/comments/prdqum/60s_popsoul_rate_reveal_day_3_these_rate_scores/hdimqar/]

=====

JustinJSrisuk: Thanks to the hosts and we gotta do more vintage rates [2]. These grab bag rates are so much more fun than album rates IMO because there’s no filler - only bops.

IIIHenryIII: Yes, please! I discovered some real jams because of this rate. I don't know about y'all, but I'm not very familiar with "old" songs. 

Also, I'd like to apologise for tanking most of these songs. I think I only knew 10% percent of them. Maybe because English isn't my first language? I know this is not an excuse for a fan of pop music, but seeing the results made me really embarrassed an uncultured. I gave so many low scores to songs that y'all really seem to love. Sorry for that! I'll try to do better next time and keep an open mind!

Anyway... thanks to the hosts! I had a lot of fun!

Edit: I meant I only knew 10%, not 90% lol

THANK YOU to our hosts for taking on one of the most competitive rates of all time !!!

TiltControls: Thanks for coming by everyone!! And extra special thanks to my cohost /u/roxieloxie for all of their work on the comments, promo, shitposts (especially the shitposts!!!) and everything else throughout the rate!! 

Now onto the usual [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates like always! (Luckily I had these done ahead this time!)


##**Songs**

It was a close race, but congrats to Ain't No Mountain for pulling through in the end. Really there were a number of songs I would've been happy to see win so I'm glad that we finally had the chance to rate some of them.

Both of the top 2 land in the top 100 highest rated songs of all time! Ain't No Mountain at #61 and Feeling Good at #92 (and Respect not far behind at #102!)

##**Artists**

Like most grab-bags, artists tend to not get ranked unless they have previous songs or take up enough of the songlist. This time around we've got 4 added to the list - Aretha, Marvin, The Supremes, and Stevie

* Though the Queen of Soul couldn't pull off the win, she got a consolation prize. **Aretha Franklin** is now our highest rated artist of all time!!!

* **The Supremes** are not far behind average-wise and take the spot for the 4th highest rated artist!

* **Marvin Gaye** and **Stevie Wonder** are a bit further down, but still with solid 36th and 44th placings respectively

* Though Aretha has the crown the other 3 shouldn't be slept on either. The Supremes, Stevie, and Marvin all got on the leaderboards without acquiring a single 0 - placing them on the elusive list of artists with that distinction.

* For controversy, Aretha takes the 6th lowest controversy score across artists 

##**Rates**

* The rate takes the 7th highest average of all time, and is the highest rated grab-bag by a good margin (and the only one to end up with an 8+ average)

* The rate is 6th for highest percentage of people to use their 11's! (Only one person did not)

Thanks again everyone!!! And see you all at Tiktok next week!

My heart is really really full seeing Ain’t No Mountain High Enough win because it is easily one of the most special songs created to me ❤️

deleted: Thank you Tilt and Roxie for running such an amazing rate! There were some robberies, but with such a high rate average that kinda takes the pain away. 

There’s two overarching messages that I’m getting from this rate:

1) anyone who gave Sam Cooke’s “Bring It on Home to Me” has taste of the highest order!
2) there needs to be more oldheads rates ~~so I can give Dean Martin my 11~~

nt96: Just wanna give a massive thank you to the hosts and congrats to yet another successful and messy rate! The shitposts are impeccable which is a shame since I work on Sundays and I can't watch em all.

Anyways congrats and see y'all on the tiktok rate!
