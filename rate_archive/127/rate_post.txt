60's Pop/Soul Classics Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ox6iiw/60s_popsoul_classics_rate/

Thats right! We’re finally saying oldheads rights and going back to [*a simpler time*](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/830977529133269003/871227248668196905/Screen_Shot_2021-07-31_at_11.05.28_PM.png ). The 60s is a decade we’ve hardly touched rate wise so this month we will bringing you some of the best pop classics the decade has to offer. From smooth and tender love songs to slow and powerful civil rights protest anthems, there's bound to be something in this lineup for everyone to enjoy! So sit back and relax and enjoy!

Taking you on this Journey we have everyone's’ favorite Rate Stat keeper [Tilt Controls!!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/830977529133269003/871230379086991360/Stand_By_Me.png)  and the gatekeeper of Interludephobia [Roxieloxie!!](https://i.imgflip.com/5i8mhk.jpg) 

##**THE SONGS**

We've got 70 amazing tracks lined up that do an amazing job of representing some of the biggest hits of the genre and era!

(“Wait 70 songs!?!?” You might say. “But hosts, that’s way too long”. Luckily the songs are all fairly short (80% of them run under 3 minutes, and only 1 is longer than 4 minutes). So it’s only got a 3h20m runtime, which for grab-bags it’s not actually too bad. Also some of you might be surprised how many of these tracks you already know. Though we do definitely understand it’s a ton of songs, but based on the quality of these tracks and the genre we think it’s 100% worth it!)

##**THANKS**

**Credit to Akane (u/akanewasright) for getting the Apple Music playlist set up and huge credit to Nick (@crxpeek, u/ResIsbytheBatphone
) for his amazing work on the playlist covers!!**

##**RULES**

- **You must listen to every song in the rate and assign each a score from 1 to 10!**
 - Scores should only be to a max of one decimal place. So 9 or 9.4 are valid, but 9.45 is a no go.
 - **You are allowed to give one song an 11 and one song a 0**. These should be reserved for your favourite and least favourite tracks. You are not required to use these, but I would highly recommend at least using the 11. It is also highly recommended you leave comments for these scores (especially for a 0).
 - Your scores are NOT confidential! They will be shown in the reveal!
- Speaking of comments, **comments are highly encouraged!** They aren't required but it adds flavour to the rate and helps give your thoughts on the track. Comments should be formatted by commenting after the song without adding anything else. For an example:
 
 -  Anyone Who Had a Heart: 10 Anyone who had a heart would give this a 10!

- As long as you tell one of us before the due date, you are also free to change your comments or scores at any point! You can message the hosts on Reddit at u/TiltControls or u/RoxieLoxie or on discord at TiltControls#5066 or Roxie#4405
- **Please do not sabotage!!** It’s hard to define sabotage in a grab bag, but us hosts reserve the right to ask for score changes or additional comments if we suspect it. Writing comments for your possible hot takes can go a long way in reducing calls of sabotage.
