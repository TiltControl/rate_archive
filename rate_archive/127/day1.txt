AHSWeeknd: The Supremes are coming for the top 10 😌

ALSO: I just wanna add this is by far my favourite rate along with the 1987 pop boys rate, this was so much fun! We gotta have more vintage rates.

nootnoot781: i loved doing this rate!! there's such a comforting quality to most of these songs so doing this rate was really relaxing.

there were so many 11 contenders and it took me a while to decide which song to give mine to. no doubt i'll be sour of some eliminations, but i'm still excited to see how this pans out.

**Roxieloxie** (8.4): and so we have our first song out! I guess it makes sense because its not as much of a power puncher as the other songs on the rate, but this song is also so inoffensive i very much could’ve seen it just sneaking into day 2. I think its fine but it has committed the grave sin of being our only 6 average in the rate

**TiltControls** (7.6): more like under the bored walk haha right. Anyways this was kind of a last minute addition cause I remembered the song being everywhere and thought it was somewhat enjoyed as a classic. Turns out, as the graph can tell you, it is not. The song itself is pretty inoffensive, though that really isn't enough against the rest of the field.

---

#Tomatoe Emoji

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Props to whoever curated this rate, you got some great taste.

**bespectacIed** (10): vampire weekend are culture vultures

**nt96** (10): This song captures summer perfectly. The little high note just makes my heart flutter.

**orangetangerine** (9.5): This gets a questionably high score for me and I'm biased towards it because it's actually one of my favorite karaoke songs.

**1998tweety** (9): classic

**akanewasright** (8.9): Well this makes me happy. I do kinda wish the recording quality was better but that’s just the time and budget

**bbfan132** (8.5): :floating: but make it literal

**GARjuna** (8.5): love this instrumental. Is this song related to bossa nova?

**seanderlust** (8.2): I don't want to taste hot dogs and french fries while i'm making love thank you, but otherwise this is a bop

**runaway3212** (8): aaahh the walk, the walkboard, under the walkboard

**vayyiqra** (8): Boardwalks are weird. I don't get it. It seems like a very American thing. How does one be under a boardwalk? Confusing. Good song though. (Update: after some Googling I now understand how being under a boardwalk would work. It is much, much roomier under them than I had thought.)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): not my favorite to listen to here but I appreciate the sentiment

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.8): i prefer their other songs but i love their voices anyway so

#Hot Girl Summer Haters

**CrimsonROSET** (7): who allowed men in this rate again

**NotWith10000Men** (7): why is this song so fucking funny to me??

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this song is really about banging under a boardwalk and it was just sang so casually huh

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): i’m pretty sure this is how you end up with a UTI

**plastichaxan** (6.5): i'm sorry this is cute but cute next to gorgeous

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Come on exhibitionism in the 60s!

**celladonn** (6): Hate when I go for a relaxing stroll on the boardwalk and there are people fucking underneath it

**jaztinax** (6): this sounds like stand by me’s fraternal twin

**rslashpoopheads** (6): yes I do listen to margaritaville radio

**trashypanini** (6): A cute little ballad. But was too straightforwardly bland in vocals and the production had the inkling some life but ultimately this sounded like a jukebox throwaway.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The Drifters following up their song “Up on the Roof” with a song that begins “When the sun beats down and burns the tar up on the roof” is giving me the same energy as Lorde coming back from Antartica and singing “I hate the winter, can’t stand the cold”

**waluigiest** (6): where?

**bigbigbee** (5): Under the boardwalk! We’ll be stealing fries! Under the boardwalk, we’ll eat other people’s fries! (my tentative edits to this song based on my own beach experiences)

**IIIHenryIII** (5): Well… It's listenable. I'll give it that

**ImADudeDuh** (5): \*insert that scene from IASIP jersey shore episode here\*

**joeeswift** (5): nothing about this song really stood out and grabbed my attention, its very nice and chilled however

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): i’m sorry idk what’s romantic about being under a crowded boardwalk

**welcome2thejam** (5): Me, standing on top of the boardwalk and looking through the gaps in the wood: The fuck's going on down there?

**jman457** (3.6): Catchy but boring and annoying

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): I grew up in a beach town, I’m allowed to dislike this

**stryxen** (1): this is nightcore stand by me

**TiltControls** (9.4): i can't believe this disrespect to [Billboard's 9th greatest girl group song of all time](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7857816/100-greatest-girl-group-songs). anyways it's camp. [also PLEASE read the wikipedia page on the trend of teenage tragedy songs if you haven't already](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teenage_tragedy_song) (it's also camp)

**Roxieloxie** (6): Sometimes things are not camp,,,, they are just bad,,,,,,,

---

#Hyperpop this Camp that, how about you go CAMPING go touch some grass and calm down

**Odlawwuzhere28** (11): The 11 for Leader of the Pack is because it catches my attention from that first chord with the spoken dialogue. The song tells a full story, and a rather serious one for singers so young, and yet the song is fun at the same time. I could easily listen to this on repeat and it makes me nostalgic.

**1998tweety** (10): it was camp

**bbfan132** (10): fucked up but brilliant

**celladonn** (10): The storytelling... the drama... the motorcycle noises...

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Is this hyperpop? Jokes aside, I'm going to check their other stuff. I'm very intrigued

**ImADudeDuh** (10): is this a bad song? Yes. is it a 10/10? Yes. hope you can understand

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): The Shangri-La were the true “bad girl” girl group (Mary Weiss famously brought a gun on tour at seventeen), with their teased hair, go-go boots and teenage death songs, they influenced generations of bad bitches to this very day. Oh, they’re from the same part of Queens as my MIL.

**ManofOranges** (10): Literally doesn't make any sense but I love it anyway

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (10): The Shangri-Las' music was one of the first things to make me think maybe I'd rather be a girl instead

**plastichaxan** (10): the way i know this is gonna get so robbed cause popheads does hyperpop dirty every rate

**raggedy-princess** (10): DO NOT LET THE SHANGRI-LAS FLOP

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh my GOD the storytelling here, i love it

**thedoctordances1940** (10): did i hear some engines revving? well I guess that means this is hyperpop, I have to give it a 10

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.9): "Is she really going out with him?" is such an iconic opener to a song.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): is… is she talking about Jim Jones…?

**akanewasright** (9): WHAT THE FUCK DID HE JUST FUCKING DIE?

**joeeswift** (9): I love the talking interludes for some reason

**runaway3212** (9): Outsold selena's wolves

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): this song is the 60s equivalent of those "liek this if u cri everytiem" sad relationship story memes

**stryxen** (9): this is literally vroom vroom ?? can we talk about this

**waluigiest** (9): honestly this kind of sounds like a modern garage diy punk kind of track

**trashypanini** (8.5): Spooky and full of personality with the almost emptily haunting harmonies by the girls. There’s the typical saccharine girl group cutsey vocals but the production here is delicious. The car/revving effects. The talk vocals at the end give this song more personality.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): the effects work so much better than the should here

**Gonza\_90** (8): OMG I love Vroom Vroom

**slimboyfriend** (8): BYTHEWAYWHEREDYOUMEETHIM

**orangetangerine** (7.8): The only white group on this list (Dusty being the other)! I think this song is awesome. The Shangri-Las were doing emo before emo was a thing. I love this song and I'm glad to see it on this rate!

**cherryices** (7.7): it’s camp!

**BB-TheBest22** (7.6): Remember (Walking In The Sand) is a 9.5

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): The spoken word intro is legendary but I actually find the song itself to be a bit messy

**jsonphile** (7.5): the sound effects get a little much at times

**anothertown** (7): Hilary and Haylie out peaked https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wptVpkXAU3s

**NotWith10000Men** (7): this is certainly something

**skargardin** (7): absolutely yelling at the car effects

**whizzer0** (7): who needs the movies when you have records?

**nt96** (6.5): I get the slightest feeling this song is gonna rank pretty low…..

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this needs a remaster more than any other song in this rate but its chaotic and campy so i can't knock it too much

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.2): kinda odd? but i still kinda vibe with it? idk i don’t think i’ll listen to it again

**CrimsonROSET** (6): https://i.imgur.com/gCRaJ21.png

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this is first act of a musical realness

#Karlie Klosses' mentions May 6th 2019

**welcome2thejam** (6): That spoken word bridge scared the shit outta me, it still feels like she's in my head

**jman457** (5.5): I liked the vocals, but there was too much talking/effects in this

**apatel27** (5): too much going on

**bespectacIed** (5): It was camp

**cremeebrulee** (5): i feel this song ironing out the wrinkles in my brain

**seanderlust** (4.4): I know this phrase gets used a lot here but THIS is camp. but also, I would be fine not to hear it ever again in my life

**rickikardashian** (4): i thought we were getting *“i can fix him”: the song* but it ended turning into an entire cinamitc universe. truly a wild ride and it was all done in less than 3 minutes.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (4): pls this is so camp

**vayyiqra** (4): This song is very silly and the lyrics are pretty bad but I like the harmonies and that it has a spoken word part. The sound effects are annoying though. What a weird song.

**bigbigbee** (2): When I was younger, my parents took me to a “political comedy music” live show, and when we were there some of the performers did a version of this song “A Leader Like Barack”, which was about how cool and sexy Barack Obama is. I don’t THINK he died in that one though…

**jaztinax** (2): this song REALLY makes me uncomfortable and uneasy

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): Between this and Dead Man’s Curve, what is up with the 60s’ obsession with teenage boys getting into gruesome and lethal car accidents??

**fadedblue09** (1): Feels like I listened to a clip to some forgotten bad Western film

**rslashpoopheads** (1): behe

**2dina3dworld** (0): this is genuinely one of the worst songs I’ve heard. The stupid revving sounds, the lyrics that sound like a labels attempts to make a song that’s hip and relatable to the kids for that easy number one, the empty, soullessness of it all. Tiresome.

**Roxieloxie** (7.8): I get why this is going out on day 1, I feel like its nice enough for the vibes of a nice candle lit dinner for two but its not exactly an ass thrower

**TiltControls** (7.5): Another song that, while super important to the music of the 60's, is just kinda alright?  Again, not a bad song by any means but compared to the competition it doesn't stand out as strongly nowadays. Also if a 70's sequel rate ever gets done you may see [some solo work from one of this groups' members included there](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curtis_Mayfield)

#Ready to Go Right Now

**bespectacIed** (10): nothing more homey and peaceful than soft dreamy guitars and chimes on a doo wop track

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I hadn’t heard this one before but it’s so pretty! The singers do a great job but I actually think it’s the moments without vocals that sell it for me the most, the music is so plaintive. I feel so calm.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.8): this is so damn smooth and soothing

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): this got a lot more powerful after I realized the context as a civil rights anthem

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): i love how delicate this is

**bbfan132** (9): i love how mellow this is - this is produced oddly but it’s still v nice

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is so soft and nice

**runaway3212** (9): spill king

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I love the guitar, and I love how soft and sweet it sounds!

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I’m ready!!1!

**orangetangerine** (8): An important and quintessential Civil Rights Movement song, and just an overall great jam.

**plastichaxan** (8): this cured my misandry for the rate

**seanderlust** (8): the harmonies are gorgeous, and the double meaning of gospel and civil rights music is very well done

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**stryxen** (7.5): daisybop actually

**CrimsonROSET** (7): at first round of scoring i had a 10 with no comment then i had a 7 without comment and i trust my second opinion more than my first

**jackisboredtoday** (7): the worse get ready in this rate

**rslashpoopheads** (7): it's cool

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): choo choo we are going to Heaven

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.7): Pretty strings but a bit forgettable.

**jman457** (6.3): Good but nothing special

#Hurry Up im gonna miss my train 

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (6): I'm always mixing this one up with Get Ready

**trashypanini** (5.5): Curtis pen on this was on one. The dudes on this sound tepid. This song would’ve benefited from a voice with power or more rich and darker tone. The song has two contexts it can be applied to and the dudes on this was just dull.

**Gonza\_90** (5): It's kind of repetitive

**slimboyfriend** (5): is this about the rapture

**vayyiqra** (5): Wish I liked this more because I like the feeling behind it but this version just seems low-energy. I know Bob Marley's version better.

**jaztinax** (4): how is it so optimistic and boring at the same time

**joeeswift** (4): this song really bored me

**IIIHenryIII** (2): Another boring song

**Roxieloxie** (8): But when will a man love me!

**TiltControls** (7.8): probably the straightest song we'll ever get popheads to rate (unless one of my ed sheeran rate ideas gets picked next cycle 🤞). It's a classic, though I don't remember the mixing being this rough at times.

---

#Idk theres a lot going on in these comments im just gonna let yall sit on it

**bespectacIed** (10): It's so funny cuz this song gives off BOTH simp and male manipulator vibes, depending on the time of day

**skargardin** (10): actual classic

**vayyiqra** (10): : (

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.1): We love a male sub anthem.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): damn, way to be heteronormative ig...

**runaway3212** (9): can't relate sorry

**bbfan132** (8.5): nice song but i can’t relate…

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (8): hetero?

**CrimsonROSET** (8): and people say the heterosexual agenda isnt pushed smh

**jman457** (8): Really dig the performance in this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): why does it end so abruptly

**cherryices** (7.4): *milhouse voice* when a maa-aan loves a womuuun

**cremeebrulee** (7): lemme commit some bi erasure on myself to enjoy this

**IIIHenryIII** (7): The guitar and the backing vocals are heavenly on this one

**jaztinax** (6.5): i love this song but jesus the mix is absolutely horrible

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’m not heterophobic but this was forgettable

**rickikardashian** (6): can a straight man confirm if this is all true?

**trashypanini** (6): A dull ballad to me. Has all the pieces of a iconic hit as to which it became. But I just don’t rock with the hollow vocal performance and production.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): sorry but the heterophobia is gonna jump out on this one

**stryxen** (5): no thoughts

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This song is kind of a slog to listen to...

**seanderlust** (4.9): don't sleep out in the rain she's not worth pneumonia king x

**plastichaxan** (4): hmm i didn’t enjoy this sorry maybe i am heterophobic

**RandomHypnotica** (4): ok the recording quality on most tracks this rate has ranged from surprisingly great to not bad, but this version is PARTICULARLY bad, to the point where it's so boomy it's obnoxious

**slimboyfriend** (0): Apologies to the heteros out there but I wish I could go the rest of my life without hearing this song. It sounds like he's mansplaining relationships as a Nice Guy

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song is so cute!!! It was a tad bit robbed tbh, but honestly, its downhill from here

**TiltControls** (9.8): the first song I'm truly sad at going early (though there is definitely still a lot of that coming up today). Yeah it's just a cute song, but it does it so so well. Also Marvin's voice here makes me ascend

#The Birds and the Bees

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A BOP

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): One of my wedding songs.

**runaway3212** (10): Marvin Gaye's voice is so incredible

**bbfan132** (8): not my favorite but pleasant to listen to

**ImADudeDuh** (8): can someone fucking date me already oml

**BB-TheBest22** (7.8): probably the weakest of Marvin’s big hits, still really good though

**jman457** (7.3): Good, but doesnt show his true power

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i don’t have a real comment for this song, but since it’s my least favorite marvin gaye track, fuck the estate, fuck blurred lines, fuck that entire lawsuit, fuck robin thicke and the harm it has caused to the entire music sphere

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): If you change “you” to “Gru” this song could be about the Despicable Me movies

**rickikardashian** (7): i need this tambourine man to take a few steps back away from the microphone because i don't know who told him he was supposed to be protagonist of this song

**welcome2thejam** (7): Was anybody going to tell me the version of How Sweet It Is that I'm familiar with is actually a cover and not the original, or was I supposed to learn that in the popheads 60's pop/soul classics rate myself

**orangetangerine** (6.8): I find this song a bit boring and repetitive, the backup singers who sing the chorus save it.

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): not horny enough

**anothertown** (6.5): marvin gaye's early music is cute, but put cute next to gorgeous?

**stryxen** (6.5): cute

#Balladphobes

**trashypanini** (6): A straightforward soul track. Marvin sounds more subdued and the richness in his voice just ain’t fully there yet. Passable song with decent production.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Too slow for my tastes

**rslashpoopheads** (5): forgettable

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): I feel like I’m the only one who liked that Meghan Trainor and Charlie Puth song

**twinfiresigns14** (4): Cliched love song.

**joeeswift** (3): the background singer distracted me, their voices do not mesh well together

#Main characters in love

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): The Righteous Brothers should have honestly written all of Elvis's songs, because every cover he did of their music was fantastic.

**bbfan132** (9): i like the deep vocals but the end is kind of messy - still great though

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Why does that guitar riff sound like the beat of Summer Nights? Shit!: https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.musictimes.com/amp/articles/19951/20141212/youve-lost-loving-feeling-50-years-righteous-brothers-classic-five.htm "One downside to Warwick's version, better blamed on those behind the track's instrumentals: the classic bridge bassline that would undoubtedly inspire the opening to Grease's 'Summer Nights'."

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Hall + Oates outsold slightly I’m afraid

**jman457** (8.4): really dig the production on this

**NotWith10000Men** (8.2): I love all the background vocals

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait so you dont kiss normally with your eyes open what the fuck

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ok this one is also a victim of the Unrighteous Brothers cover but this was does sound noticeably worse imo

**waluigiest** (8): summer loving, had me a blast…..

**celladonn** (7.5): The production on this is kind of distracting, I'm not sure how I feel about it

**jaztinax** (7.5): do i hear the riff to summer nights from grease in there?

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7.5): It's fine but I've gotten so tired of it

**seanderlust** (7.3): this one just kind of washes over me tbh

**1998tweety** (7): nice

**AHSWeeknd** (7): i HAVE???

**cremeebrulee** (7): who the fuck is kissing anyone w their eyes open????? i refuse to believe this is a thing

**runaway3212** (7): This is such a beautiful title for a mediocre song

**thedoctordances1940** (7): this does in fact sound righteous

**plastichaxan** (6.5): my rating for this was higher but then Be My Baby was the next song to rate this was set up

#The Side characters suffering

**stryxen** (5): fine but forgettable

**anothertown** (4): ???

**rslashpoopheads** (4): and I'm not bringing it back!

**2dina3dworld** (3): okay this dude sounds like he’s singing lower than his actual vocal range goes and it’s so jarring

**bespectacIed** (2): damn always hearing dionne and roberta flack's versions to hearing this was a special kind of comedown

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (2): i have no valid reason for it but i just really hate this song and always have lmao

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): Ugh I’m not sure if it’s just me but this song just seems like it goes onnnn and onnnn and the singers are giving me big “drunk at a bar trying to sing karaoke like a crooner but only coming across super cringy and a bit creepy” energy

**trashypanini** (0): This one felt like a sad middle aged dude jukebox throwaway song meant to be skipped. And strangely long af with their yawn like voices...and I’ve listened to an 18 minute long prog shit.

**TiltControls** (9.6): THIS IS THE SMOKEY SONG WE'VE DECIDED TO TRASH FIRST?!? anyways this is a bop. a sad bop, but still a bop. like a 60's Dancing On My Own. Also it's the start of this rate's [fuck Rolling Stone's opinions era](https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/best-motown-songs-1139063/smokey-robinson-and-the-miracles-the-tracks-of-my-tears-1965-1139532/)

**Roxieloxie** (7): Let them be sad in peace 

---

#Crying in the ~~club~~ Jukebox

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why’s this so sad oh my god

**anothertown** (10): MY SMILE IS MY MAKEUP I WEAR SINCE MY BREAKUP WITH YOU!!

**bbfan132** (10): total classic, excellent track

**bespectacIed** (10): my smile is my makeup i wear since my break up with you --> now that's a bar

**jsonphile** (10): perfect heartbreaking song

**runaway3212** (9): just so amazing

**orangetangerine** (8): This is my favorite Smokey Robinson & The Miracles song out of the three selected for the Soul Rate, BUT I think it's a travesty that "You Really Got a Hold on Me", a perfect 10, was not included.

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I'm crying in the BeatSense

**jman457** (7.1): I get limp wrist vibes from him, or at least his emotional ass was a pisces

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this is just a lesser tears of a clown

**plastichaxan** (7): why are they so sad 2/3 of their songs are about laughing on the outside and being so sad inside

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): doesn’t hit as hard as the clown tear song tho

**slimboyfriend** (7): The less annoying Smokey Robinson song about tears

**thedoctordances1940** (7): two songs by them with the word tears in the title? I don't think there's a clearer way of saying stream tears by charli xcx feat caroline polachek

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I had no idea Smoky was known for depressed bops? Thought those were only a recent invention

#[Hmm](https://www.betterhelp.com/)

**cherryices** (6): this guy cries a lot, huh

**cremeebrulee** (6): he seems to be crying pretty frequently should someone check up on him or something ..

**twinfiresigns14** (5.5): - Ehh. It doesn't top Jess Mauboy's version for me, not by a long chalk

**bigbigbee** (5): Hey…I think these guys are trying to tell us something

**welcome2thejam** (5): Dude's really trying to corner the market on depressed clowns, huh

**IIIHenryIII** (1): The most boring of this rate

**CrimsonROSET** (0): Wasn’t this the last song but less fun? I didn’t like that one either! What the fuck!

**TiltControls** (10): HOWWWWWWW. This is the first (of many) of my 10's to go and it's a rough one. Yeah it's a bit silly for a literal child to be this melodramatic about a crush, but the vocals here are top notch! With even their two additions only barely making it on (their debut came in 1969), I do wonder how well they'd do if they could take from their much wider catalogue like Roxie said (ABC and I'll Be There for easy day 3)

**Roxieloxie** (9): Very surprised this ended up being day 1! The jackson 5 i think also are artist who stood their ground here but absolutely would’ve demolished if they’re were 70s songs here ~~of course this just means me and tilt are just gonna have to host the 70s sequel next year~~ also yes the intro of this is my favorite thing ever

---

#Apple Juice on the rocks to numb the pain

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The Jackson 5 were truly a band for the books

**frogaranaman** (10): what’s with the Migos-like adlibs in the banter before the live performance

**jaztinax** (10): how and why a little kid was carrying pop/soul in this era is beyond me but here we are

**ManofOranges** (10): You gotta wonder who 12 year old Michael could be singing about with a song like this like did he ask a girl if he could sit next to her at lunch and she said no?

**rickikardashian** (10): the way this song continues to plague singing competitions to this day

**runaway3212** (10): siri play nobody by mitski

**bbfan132** (9): sonically excellent

**bespectacIed** (9): a toddler has no business singing this type of song. Do your homework michael!

**plastichaxan** (9): okay the kid can yell here i’ll allow it

**jman457** (8.5): a really great vocal performance

**trashypanini** (8.5): They really had 5th grader covering middle aged man songs but he ate it down make no mistake!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i had no better comment so migos adlib upvotes to the left

**ignitethephoenix** (8): MJ’s vocals are amazing here for his age

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ok now that I got over my anger that ABC isnt in this rate, this is a bop too

**seanderlust** (8): I see we didn't learn our lesson in want you back, did we michael? :waiting:

**stryxen** (8): cute as hell actually

**twinfiresigns14** (8): Pleasant surprise, but Jessica Mauboy's version from The Sapphires will always be the definitive version of this for me. Nevertheless an enjoyable track with some great vocals from a young Michael

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I know that “I Want You Back” is also about romantic love, and so objectively, the 11 year old Michael Jackson singing that song is just as weird as him singing this one. But IDK, something about this song being slower and sultrier makes me really think about the fact that a child is crooning about “lovin’ you” and “treatin you bad”.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): a cute ballad but I can see why this one isn’t as omnipresent as I Want You Back or ABC or I’ll Be There

**jsonphile** (7): probably the weakest song on here but that’s just because this playlist is just so dang good

#Has Never experienced the epic highs and lows of breakup at finger paint

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is ok

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): I’m not the biggest fan of the Jackson 5’s slower tracks.

**2dina3dworld** (6): I can’t take this seriously knowing that Michael Jackson was only 11 at the time. I know you can love as a child, but this feels too mature for an eleven year old to be singing, somehow.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I cannot with baby michael (right?) singing about the pain of heartbreak

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I cheated ya BAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA—

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): Definitely not that bad. I really just can't listen to kids singing no matter how gifted they are vocally

**rslashpoopheads** (5): they don't make ballads like this anymore (derogatory)

**fadedblue09** (2): I have come to the realization that preteen Michael's voice is not for me

**Roxieloxie** (8): God I wish that were me

**TiltControls** (7.7): Another classic that's only just alright in comparison to everything else. The guitar is fun at least, but compared to a lot of the other girl groups in the rate The Crystals don't display the same level of charisma that the others show imo.

---

#Would've made Lipsync vids for this in the 60s

**2dina3dworld** (10): the less problematic of the two Crystal’s songs I know.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): You see if Fifth Harmony made music like this maybe they’d be in a Popheads rate [**Host Note** *Fifth Harmony have been rated and they did just as well as this song did so*]

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): It's me, the problematic faux-edgy person you went to high school with who posts "I keep my circle small" Scarface memes on Facebook. Cuz I unironically LOVE Goodfellas, LOVE this song and LOVE the scene it's used in the movie!!! In my Karen Hill era, help!

**ManofOranges** (10): Shoutout to the opening of Adventures in Babysitting

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (10): Really cool riff

**qazz23** (10): I like all the girl group sounds

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): I love how romantic the instrumental feels

**akanewasright** (9): I have to imagine I’m not gonna be the only one with this reference but… the way this was used in Adventures in Babysitting was really fucking good. My mom showed me the movie when i was younger, and that scene never left my mind. Just last year, one of my theater professors showed the class that scene to demonstrate how music and performance can be used well together

**bbfan132** (9): beautiful track sonically

**bespectacIed** (9): wholesome

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): As awful as Phil Spector was, no one can say that his “Wall of Sound” didn’t create absolute bops.

**plastichaxan** (9): the way this made me jump cause i heard “Well he walked up to me and he asked me if I wanted to die” in that first sentence

**thedoctordances1940** (9): i know the beach boys were really heavily inspired by a lot of this music but I don't think there's a song that oozes beach boys more than this in the rate

**cherryices** (8.7): yes my score is inflated by the goodfellas scene. what about it

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Really like the storytelling in this one, like the song really tells us about her whole journey from their first kiss to their marriage.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): and then i woke up 😔

**skargardin** (8): aww

**slimboyfriend** (8): this sounds like a christmas song

**stryxen** (8): this is so good ?? lemme saving

**jman457** (7.6): He hit me and it felt like a kiss

**1998tweety** (7.5): God I wish that was me

**trashypanini** (7.5): That building swinging rhythm is infectious. Very Ronette esque so not entirely surprised that vile man is involved 😭. The uniformity in harmony is a bit anemic but it also works perfectly for the easy going bubble gum pop sound in instrumentation. A clean cut pop track with a forward driving narrative of the “perfect” love story.

**anothertown** (7): this is the type of song my wife likes +2 point for wife music

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I like the backing track a lot

**rslashpoopheads** (7): wish this were me!

**runaway3212** (7): this is literally the most unrelated song ever

**seanderlust** (6.1): (ja'mie voice) I don't mean to be a bitch but you guys are really boring

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s always so funny to listen to old-timey love songs… like aww they’re so childish and innocent 🥺

#Torn By Ava Max

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): it's cute I guess

**cremeebrulee** (5): i love you on the second date? ok ted mosby

**CrimsonROSET** (5): so many songs just do this better in this rate, i’m sorry.

**GARjuna** (5): very abba???

**jaztinax** (5): this sounds like if ABBA made music in the 60s. not mad at it but not into it either

**bigbigbee** (4): I’m not the biggest fan of this “60s girl group” sound in comparison to some of the more soulful stuff from this decade, especially when the lyrics feel so elementary (the simple sentences and rhymes, the repetition).

**fadedblue09** (0): Too corny, and the production is kinda painful to listen to

**Roxieloxie** (8.6): idk who UB40 is and at this point im too afraid to ask

**TiltControls** (8): it's cute, but definitely the weakest of the Temptations tracks in the rate. Also these lyrics are just ??? Like some of these comparisons just straight up don't make sense. also I haven't heard the UB40 cover, but after having to listen to their cover of Can't Help Falling in Love for a different rate, fuck UB40

#You guys remember pre covid when we we're just making brooms stand on their own on tiktok? You ever think about that?? what if thats how covid came about

**AHSWeeknd** (10): imagine being a schoolbook

**ImADudeDuh** (10): UB40 will pay for their crimes to humanity

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (10): This has been stuck in my head for like a month now

**runaway3212** (10): Just literally so sweet in every way

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.9): this is like Motown's version of "uwu". Still love it tho.

**stryxen** (8.5): lovely song to finish the rate on :))))

**jman457** (8.4): play it

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**bbfan132** (8): i thought he said “as fruity as you are” and i was like “um…..” anyways, good song

**plastichaxan** (8): okay i am now convinced they invented pick-up lines cause this is just one after another

**seanderlust** (8): this is honestly so cheesy but I cant help but grin hearing it

**BB-TheBest22** (7.6): you could’ve been a broom

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): who needs details?

**orangetangerine** (6.9): You know that UB40 did a reggae-pop cover of this song like 30 years ago or so? It took me forever to realize the songs were one and the same.

#Stop Doing things <3

**avenueroy** (6.4): This is a level of cheese that even I can't handle. The Temptations definitely have much better songs than this.

**2dina3dworld** (6): maybe it’s because I’ve been doing this rate for too long, but this is just starting to sound like background noise.

**stryxen** (9): this song is over and im just still thinking about how much i enjoyed it

**plastichaxan** (8.5): okay speak for yourself girl but a muscle-bound man could take my hand thank you

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): What a sweet and romantic song!

**seanderlust** (7.7): "my boyfriend is boring as shit and I love him" anthem

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's cute

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): tell me more!

**trashypanini** (6.5): such a sweet song. Has such a dreamy kind of 50s all American suburban doo-pop sound with the instrumentation. Along with Mary’s cute straightforward voice with no frills. Kind of one of those all consuming love type songs.

**twinfiresigns14** (6): - Enjoyable production and I love the harmonies, but I wasn’t really a fan of the melody

#The other girls in the groupchat preparing to tell you how your man isnt shit

**jman457** (5.5): pretty middle of the road

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): you might not like it, but her guy is what the ideal male body looks like

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I can't imagine a song coming out today with these lyrics unless it was some dumb country song

**bigbigbee** (5): I like that she progressively gets more defensive of her guy (insisting that this song is “her opinion” three times in one verse) and starts shitting on him more as the song goes on more. No dude with two functioning kidneys could take me from my guy! No man who actually remembers to take out the trash could ever take the place of MY guy!

**jaztinax** (3): i never liked this

**IIIHenryIII** (2.5): I really don’t like how this phrase sounds. I hope any girl never calls me that

**Roxieloxie** (10): WHY IS THIS GOING OUT DAY ONE??? Poppy im so sorry that popheads was so tasteless to your 11.

**TiltControls** (9.5): Now Dionne's never going to notice us : ( Anyways I was hoping this would do much better even if it was maybe one of the lesser known tracks of the rate. Then again I thought the same of the other times we rated Dionne and she lost songs early so maybe I was just being naive. Anyone who had a heart would surely push this to day 2 AT LEAST

---

#Empaths

**plastichaxan** (11): listening to this feels so transcendent i can't describe it but wow she's so powerful. i ended up giving my 11 to this because no song stuck to me as much as this one, this rate is great, but this was THE song i kept thinking about all the time

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wonder how many people will mention Dionne’s twitter account

**bbfan132** (10): gorgeous!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): unparalleled voice

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): If you haven't had an emotional breakdown in your tub sipping a martini wailing along to this song then you've never been heartbroken

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): queen of Twitter!!

**qazz23** (9): I like how it picks up at the end

**runaway3212** (9): this song isn't for me but it's amazing

**stryxen** (9): my score just kept going up as the song went on

**welcome2thejam** (9): Goes off in the last thirty seconds

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): me listening to a woman singing about a literal toxic relationship: omg bop!

**1998tweety** (8): pretty

**anothertown** (8): when living legend Mr. Burt Bacharach gets robbed in this rate :-(

**CrimsonROSET** (8): hi poppy please don’t kill me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): don't tell Dionne on Twitter pls

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The writing on this song is very modern, it could be released by a country pop girl today

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I think the build-up to the ending makes it all worth it!

**waluigiest** (8): the subtle intensity here is so good

**orangetangerine** (7.8): The fact it was produced by Burt Bacharach is not surprising at all, it sounds like his work at every other turn. Dionne does such a great job and the backup harmonies are on point.

**trashypanini** (7.5): Thee first pop star Dionne Warwick just soars here. Those dramatic rises in her tone. And the seamlessness in which she shifts from belts to that morose tone. The desperation and yearning is oozing and you can’t help just to sing along with her.

**celladonn** (7): I really like parts of this melody but other parts don't really work for me

**GARjuna** (7): sounds like the song in fun and fancy free with that bear short

**jman457** (6.9): Twitter star can actually sing

**rickikardashian** (6.8): this is lovely but how do you make a 3 minute song feel so long

**NotWith10000Men** (6.7): parts of this remind me of the cinderella soundtrack (no not the camila version)

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): Another one where the instrumentals are really good, but the way her voice is recorded doesn't sound nice

**jaztinax** (6.5): i love the slightly dramatic transition chords in the verses

#Poppy's hit list

**ImADudeDuh** (6): omg she is like olivia rodrigo in 1964

**rslashpoopheads** (5): this is very 60s

**seanderlust** (5): miss dionne is a legend and an icon. for that reason, I wish I liked this more, but it's a bit flat and unremarkable for me

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): Anyone who has a heart loves Dionne’s Twitter.

**Roxieloxie** (10): This grew on me alot from the listening parties and re listening to it. I get why its going day 1 though 

**TiltControls** (8.4): Another sad bop from the Smokester. The circus theme is a fun touch based on the title & subject and the amount of charisma in the delivery is stellar, but it's a little too cheesy for me at times to fully take seriously.

---

#Stan Main pop girl stevie wonder

**AHSWeeknd** (10): if Katy Perry made this for Smile, she’d still be getting number ones.

**anothertown** (10): The original "upbeat song with sad lyrics" bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://tenor.com/view/cry-tears-sad-gif-11010283

**jsonphile** (10): before there was Outkast, Smokey Robinson had the best “happy sounding song but actually sad lyrics about trying to hide the pain and sound happy”

**qazz23** (10): I like how it seamlessly switches between two styles of music

**runaway3212** (10): "Heard joke once: Man goes to doctor. Says he's depressed. Says life seems harsh and cruel. Says he feels all alone in a threatening world where what lies ahead is vague and uncertain. Doctor says, 'Treatment is simple. Great clown Pagliacci is in town tonight. Go and see him. That should pick you up.' Man bursts into tears. Says, 'But doctor…I am Pagliacci."

**trashypanini** (10): The beat of this song is just iconic. And I love it a lot. Heard it a lot of times from my dad. Basically the song equivalent of I’m not over you but I’m gon pretend to be! It’s kind of depreciatingly funny too cause dude is like I’m being performative (and clowning everybody) but for what? There’s no audience for my tears 😭

**waluigiest** (10): this creates a whole universe, it’s really fantastic

**jman457** (9.5): We love a depression Bop!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.4): Such a great opening line. Another random quibble that has nothing to do with this song: is the lack of Wilson Pickett on this list :( Stream "Midnight Hour" and "Teardrops Will Fall"!!! Anywho, I usually like low and gravelly voices like Otis's. But this song is a bop! Smokey owns this song. The bassline is groovy and that opening riff is so fun.

**bespectacIed** (9): me when self-titled and lemonade both lost the aoty to white people

**fadedblue09** (9): Instrumental SLAPS

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This id kinda funky? It sounds like background music from like a ‘90s children’s fantasy show. But I appreciate how the emotions are actually really sincere despite the campiness.

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (9): I love sad carnival music

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.8): The circusy intro is so much that it goes all the way past camp straight back to awersome.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**akanewasright** (8.5): Me when this song goes out

**seanderlust** (8.5): some of the songs from this era are like "i'm so depressed, nothing is is keeping me going I have lost the will to live (major chords over a bright beat)"

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.1): oh so me last night

**plastichaxan** (8): and we thought saying we were clowning was a recent thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): That little tune is giving me more “medieval” than “general clownery” but it’s still a great song with surprisingly deep lyrics

**bbfan132** (7.5): good song, not the most interesting but still

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): wow a song written about me!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I hear “the tears of a clown” uh, i hate that song. Always feel like they talking to me when it comes on

**95ztaehyung** (7): me too bestie

**cherryices** (7): yes the calliope bit is the main reason i like this

**cremeebrulee** (7): so this is the song diddy hates so much on coming home huh

**rslashpoopheads** (7): It's me. I'm the clown.

#[Swifties this morning](https://open.spotify.com/album/5hxKw2PurC0i1VVJMAntDU?si=WMs8iR6aRfGBy2x_74y_uQ)

**slimboyfriend** (6.8): Unfortunate because I can't STAND the instrumental hook but the rest of the song is pretty good

**CrimsonROSET** (6): me at some of these songs

**ManofOranges** (6): Sad sad tears of a clown

**bigbigbee** (4.5): It’s amazing to me that in a year and a half on Discord I’ve never seen someone use a clowncry emote…seems like an obvious combo

**IIIHenryIII** (4): aka The Tears of a Swiftie

**welcome2thejam** (4): "But doctor, I am Smokey Robinson"

**2dina3dworld** (1): I always find myself laughing at this song, because it’s absolutely stupid.

#Ordinary People

**bbfan132** (10): classic!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): DAE racism bad?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): fuck capitalism so true! scooby dooby doo!

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): I love me some utopian Sly & The Family Stone, but damn I wish that a track like “Family Affair” could’ve been included in this rate. As positive and optimistic as they were, as the band disintegrated, Sly would explore themes of spiritual and political turmoil and show that funk was just as capable of expressing dark and complex topics.

**runaway3212** (10): I like this because it simple and sweet

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (9): Bonus point for being the last song I heard on my car radio before going overseas for school

**GARjuna** (8.8): love the voice

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): There’s something kind of… schoolyard chant-like about this one? But that’s interesting

**AHSWeeknd** (8): If this was written in Soviet Russia, the chorus would be “*we* am everyday people”.

**stryxen** (8): bop actually

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh, Scooby Doo's in this?

**avenueroy** (7.9): Okay honestly for a long time this song was ruined by the fact that seemingly EVERY commercial uses it, but listening to it on its own it is a really great song. The vocals are amazing, the lyrics are very interesting, the production is great.

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Scooby Dooby Dooby

**trashypanini** (7): An multicultural we all in this together message. Production is killer and really speaks to the perfect genre blend the fam nailed so effortless.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It sounds really great, but I will admit the lyrics are very “I don’t see color!” Ah well, scooby dooby dooby and all that

**jman457** (6.8): Catchy but wish there was more substance to this

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): I feel like this is the Born this Way of its time, in that it’s obviously well meaning even if some of the lyrical choices are… not great

#Rich people

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I feel like this song did a very poor way of sending their message across if it was supposed to send a message

**ImADudeDuh** (6): they way they just throw in scooby dooby doo sends me

**celladonn** (5): This is short but it feels like it goes so long and I find the lyrics pretty trite

**thedoctordances1940** (5): this does nothing for me

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): this is the Common People of the 60s

**95ztaehyung** (4.3): honestly forgot what this song sounded like as soon as it ended i’m sorry

**Motm-track9** (4.2): aggressive cowbell.

**bigbigbee** (3.5): I don’t like the women’s parts of this because I am a misogynist

**rslashpoopheads** (2): booooring

**Roxieloxie** (9): Now why did we get rid off all of Smokey today popheads, im disapointed in you

**TiltControls** (8): And there goes all the Smokey tracks (well if you ignore his extensive behind the scenes work on so many other tracks anyways). For someone who was so influential in the motown sphere it's weird seeing him being one of the first to leave fully. Anyways for the song. It's cute. I don't know if I'd call it my favourite of the 3 tracks from him, but it's still nice. (Also go do the rerate!)

#In your fantasy, dream about me

**runaway3212** (9): i will third that emotion for you bestie

**Roxieloxie** (9.6): HIMBO ANTHEM!!! I Genuinely love this song so much, its so corny but its so earnest in a way that i cant even be mad at it, it makes me smile

**TiltControls** (8.8): a track for that speaks to himbos out there. It's fun, but compared to a lot of other Sam's tracks it feels a little juvenile. (Though if I had my choice of songs where Sam doesn't know stuff, I really wish I could've added Good Times, but alas this was much more well known). Also [one of the two songs in this rate we've rated before](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/7lraxw/rate_reveal_charity_rate_day_2/drojcnd/) (tldr: it did a bit better here score wise but not placement wise)

#Hunks

**AHSWeeknd** (10): SAME! I don’t get math at all.

**akanewasright** (10): OH THATS WHAT THIS SONG IS CALLED

**bespectacIed** (10): better than louis' i fear.

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): I don't know much about giving Sam Cooke anything less than a 10.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): bitch, me too. The fuck

**jsonphile** (10): a purely delightful song

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Is there no “Twistin’ the Night Away” in this rate? I am shocked and offended at the lack of inclusion of that song.

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (10): When I finally got around to signing up for Spotify, this was the first song on my first playlist

**runaway3212** (10): Why were so many songs in this era called what a wonderful wold

**seanderlust** (10): himbo anthem

**ManofOranges** (9): And i think to myself what a wonderful world

**stryxen** (9): too short but so so so good

**thedoctordances1940** (9): ok but who remembers the french they took

**waluigiest** (9): it’s simple but very cute

**bbfan132** (8.5): nice song!

**nootnoot781** (8.5): “Don't know much trigonometry, Don't know much about algebra” this applies to at least 70% of popheads

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): i don’t know shit either so this one hits hard

**1998tweety** (8): the other one is better

**2dina3dworld** (8): I don’t know much about trigonometry either!

**BB-TheBest22** (8): science book

**welcome2thejam** (8): Shoutout Sam Cooke for making a romantic song for dumb fucks like me

**plastichaxan** (7.8): omg himbo king

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): himbo rights

**jaztinax** (7.5): such a relatable song because i don’t know much about school subjects either <3 also just realized that beyonce nods to this song in 1+1

#Jocks

**rslashpoopheads** (6): bland

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): Louis Armstrong definitely outsold

**trashypanini** (6): wonder if Bey interpolated this on 1+1...anyways a run of the mill romantic love is my beacon type joint. Sam is full of charm but this is one note.

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): I, too, don't know what a slide rule is for

**fadedblue09** (4.5): I see where Beyonce got her inspiration for 1+1

**IIIHenryIII** (2): This is cheesy as hell. Don't get me wrong, I do love cheesy but not everyone can pull it off

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): What in the PBS Kids… Well if you can say one thing about Mr. Cooke it’s that he certainly has range

**Roxieloxie** (9): :daisybop:

**TiltControls** (9): yes I know, I really should've had at least SOME Wilson Pickett here. (Mustang Sally and In the Midnight Hour were included in an earlier draft, but they got cut at some point. idr why). Anyways the song is fun! I liked the instrumental showcase and the energy showcased here would truly make it easy to dance to!

---

#Smack!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Nah I think I’ll dance to the whale noises

**bespectacIed** (10): pure innocent fun

**jman457** (10): Literally invented disco and funk of the 70’s.

**jsonphile** (10): time to get funky

**qazz23** (10): Funky and ahead of its time, I like the doo-wop break

**runaway3212** (10): I love it when music tells me to do simple tasks I can do

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): They really did the drummer dirty here huh? Anyways this song is like the definition of “bop” so

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.2): If I had a time machine to go back to the Summer of Love, the first thing I’d do is go see a live performance of this - apparently there are epic 20+ minute versions that Sky & The Family Stone performed.

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (9): minus one point for calling people ‘squares’ unironically

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is such cheeky fun, I like how he builds the whole damn song right before our ears. Can’t say it’s as much of a “bop” as many of the other songs in the rate but I have to respect the creativity.

**slimboyfriend** (9): Could u imagine if Tina Turner covered this....... the power

**bbfan132** (8.5): v v good!!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): classic bop!

**nt96** (8.5): *incoming shrek references*

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (8.5): Along with "Come All Ye", this is an easy pick for the "singer explains what a band does" canon

**orangetangerine** (8.4): The guitar solo jams in this song absolutely slay.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.1): shrek is love, etc

**rslashpoopheads** (8): was...was that a Mustang Sally reference? Where is Mustang Sally!!!!!

**trashypanini** (8): A Funk fusion jam. Easy straightforward lyrics with a pulsing beat. Has the booming vocals and infectious hook. A classic hit.:

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i mean, i \*will\* but i won’t like it.

**welcome2thejam** (7): This song sounds like it takes place in a town with a reverse Footloose situation, where you're forced by law to dance and groove every waking hour

**2dina3dworld** (6): the announcing the instruments before they’re played reminds me of Pokémon battling

#Discourse! at the orchestra

**bigbigbee** (6): I think the production choices in this are super interesting and I love how so many different instruments are highlighted, but I don’t enjoy the melody as much as I want to

**IIIHenryIII** (6): The intro is rather egregious, but the song improves after that awesome guitar riff

**stryxen** (5): i

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): now what is this

**fadedblue09** (2): The instruments save this mess

**joeeswift** (0): I can’t unhear a background horn sounding like a fart………..

**TiltControls** (10): Alright I know I mentioned robbery in a few other early eliminations, but I'd like to retract those statements. Cause in comparison absolutely nothing compares to the COMPLETE ROBBERY OF THIS SONG. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN CONTENTION FOR DAY 3 NOT GOING OUT MID DAY 2! To 2dina3dworld and raggedy-princess I'd like to apologize for this tragedy and thank you for your 11s. Every element of this song is perfection and amazing and AAAAAAAAAA

**Roxieloxie** (8): Yeah this was an absolute robbery i dont know what went wrong

---

#People who get it

**2dina3dworld** (11): lovely song. That’s all I have to say. It’s like a spell, when I hear this song all I feel is a quiet sense of love and unburdened joy.

**raggedy-princess** (11): Perfect

**AHSWeeknd** (10): imagine laughing when someone left

**avenueroy** (10): Bruce Springsteen once called Sam Cooke the sexiest man who ever lived and I think he's right

**bbfan132** (10): just really good

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): Honestly the studio version is only a 9.5, but do yourself a favor and listen to the live version on the Brilliant One Night Stand album. It has rightfully been called the greatest live album ever recorded, and it's a rare glimpse of Sam singing with a grit that could match Otis Redding. Having spent most of his career being forced to cater to the white ear and singing in the beautifully pure tone he is known for, in this concert he finds himself singing to an audience of people that looked just like him - letting his hair down so to speak and singing with a raw energy none of his other live performances - or live performances of most artists who came after him - could ever match.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (9): This closes a live album of his that I adore, and it really is the perfect closer to that set

**runaway3212** (9): I hate to say it but this is just vibes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.1): My mom calls Sam Cooke "her man", lol. I'm an Otis stan moreso but still like Sam!!

**cremeebrulee** (8): i’ll always be your WHAT???? when was maneskin in this rate

**fadedblue09** (8): The slave lyric is a bit concerning but this is probably my favorite song of his in this list

**seanderlust** (8): "I forgave you even though you were out day and night" he really said 'I forgive you for having a social life' huh

**jman457** (7.2): Play it again, sam

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): I can see an old couple having this one as their song

**plastichaxan** (6.5): how come this song feels like double its time i thought it was so long and it’s not even 3 minutes

#Will never find love

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): At my first ever job they would always play this song and god it got soooo annoying and made the days seem soooo much longer… but outside of that context I guess this song is cute

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i swear i heard every single part of this song before

**ImADudeDuh** (5): eh

**trashypanini** (4): unhealthy codependent canon type track. Score:

**rslashpoopheads** (3): um

**stryxen** (3): i simply dont like the way this sounds

---

#I just think that women

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I love it when they yell “heat wave!”

**bbfan132** (10): LIKE A HEAT WAVEEEEEEEEEE

**bespectacIed** (10): martha reeves has one of the greatest voices in motown, unreal

**ImADudeDuh** (10): God, this is just such a happy song and the shouts of “Like a heat wave!” is one of the top moments in the whole rate

**qazz23** (10): Great vocals and energy

**stryxen** (10): BANGER

**welcome2thejam** (10): Probably my favorite discovery of the rate.

**akanewasright** (9.5): I’d like to assume love is at least slightly better than this past summer.

**bigbigbee** (9): I know I just complained about the “60s girl group” sound somewhere else but this song really works for me. Something about the composition maybe? It’s

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**runaway3212** (8): Super fun

**jman457** (7.9): She is cute if a bit generic

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): Love, just like heat waves, has been faking me out

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): hot girl summer you know she got it lit

**orangetangerine** (7.4): Peppy, light fun!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): we love tiktok rate promo

**seanderlust** (7): i'm doing this during another heat wave in the pacific northwest USA, so this is uh...a bit triggering

**trashypanini** (7): The beat on this has an easy going rhythm and the BG vocalists add that flavor of dreaminess that really emphasizes this powerful head in the clouds love. Simple and sweet.

#Does anyone think global warming is a good thing? 

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Those constant HEAT WAVE!s remind me of an emergency siren

**rslashpoopheads** (5): boring

**thedoctordances1940** (2.5): it's not a bad song but the production of the vocals is legitimately hurting my ears

**IIIHenryIII** (2): Sorry, the other ones were somewhat enjoyable. This one is just annoying, especially the *heat wave!* and the *burning, burning, burning* parts

**Roxieloxie** (8): I think the Isley brothers are one of the artist in the rate that did fair here, but would’ve absolutely smashed had the decade been the 70s, like you cant tell me footsteps in the dark would not have been a top ten smash

**TiltControls** (7.7): Another band that might've done a bit better in a different decade. Shout would've been a great addition but unfortunately was a bit too early. Anyways this song is fun! I know I gave this closer score to the other 'nice, but pales in comparison' songs but it really grew on me throughout the rate! Ultimately though this is a fine spot for this song.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A timeless bop

**bespectacIed** (10): the isley bros x earth wind and fire verzuz is a required viewing

**cremeebrulee** (10): i have nothing clever to say about this song it’s just the cutest thing i’ve ever heard 😭

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.9): The Isley Brothers are the best band of the 60s, I said what I said

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (9): Most of the songs on here that I've heard a billion times didn't need a relisten, but for some reason I always forget how this song goes

**skargardin** (9): this is too sweet omg

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.8): Hooks upon hooks upon hooks.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I only knew Cynthia Erivo's version, and I really like it. Damn, that movie is amazing, and so it's its soundtrack! I always go back to it. It's one of my favorites

**trashypanini** (8.5): An absolute bop! And I ain’t heard this particular Isley bros joint but it’s so infectious. Another song about still being tied to a toxic relationship with a banging beat and vocal performance by Ron Isley.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8): might want to get that checked out, sir

**bigbigbee** (8): That small sax (?) part left me hanging…I want a full-blown sax solo please. Great song though!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): WHY ARE THERE SO MANY SONGS ABOUT CODEPENDENCY IN THIS RATE WERE PEOPLE OK IN THE 60S

**runaway3212** (8): This is sweet but a bit boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): um what is this saxophone doing

**rslashpoopheads** (7): very basic but in a good way

**slimboyfriend** (7): sounds like a cover of like 5 other songs in this rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Another cute song… but not exactly one that stands out

**welcome2thejam** (7): Shame that Shout barely missed qualifying as an Isley Brothers rep, that would have been an unbelievably strong 11 competitor

**jman457** (6.9): The isley Bros have better tracks I fear

**NotWith10000Men** (6.2): that trombone or whatever in the middle sounds, uh, bad, as evidenced by the fact that i'm not entirely sure that's what it is

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its ok

**Roxieloxie** (10): This is probably the song that grew the most on me while rating it,  I dont think i’d heard it but damn if it isnt one of my favorite songs i’ve discovered doing this. This song is singlehandedly turning me into a ‘damn they just dont make em like this anymore’ boomer. 

**TiltControls** (9.3): The weakest Aretha song in the rate and if my score doesn't show how strong that still is I don't know what else to tell you. The lyrics are a little... um... worrying. but Aretha puts her soul into it (as she often does) and it comes out working well! There's some strain in the audio, but it sounds like that's more due to the recording rather than Aretha. I would've LOVED to hear this live

---

#If My Man catches me slipping,,, thats on ME

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That piano and the vocals here. Life. I’m living.

**bbfan132** (10): the vocals… so so good

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): One of Aretha's best.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): me after seeing a man I have never spoken to and will never see again

**runaway3212** (10): ITS JUST SO FUCKING GREAT

**jman457** (9.5): another classic, but the recording doesnt really capture the dynamic nature of this song

**CrimsonROSET** (9): aretha said men rights, and you know? Good for her

**jaztinax** (9): i love the way the chorus/hook resolves ugh

**rickikardashian** (8.5): **ASEXUAL ARETHA FRANKLIN MOOD BOARD** // *”I never loved a man                                          “

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Yes Tell him off!!........and take him back....?

**stryxen** (8.5): i’ve never loved a man.

**trashypanini** (8): I usually wouldve been like she talking about some #strugglelove skip! But the way she prattles on at the closing verse is just master class vocal skill. It sells the desperation and exasperation she feels towards the slime dude and her own emotions.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): “I never loved ~~a~~ men ~~(The Way I Love You)~~” so true bestie

**NotWith10000Men** (7.7): is that piano melody underneath everything in another big song, or was just really popular in this genre? I'm pretty sure I've heard it before but this song doesn't sound familiar

**1998tweety** (7.5): this was alright but picked up a lot at the end

**plastichaxan** (7.5): no cause i would relate to this if it stopped after she said "i never loved a man" cause so true

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): she seriously has one of the most stunning and captivating voices ever

**cremeebrulee** (7): please leave him

**ManofOranges** (7): I never loved a man

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): mmm not my favorite Aretha track… but still a good song nonetheless

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Cute trumpets, but definitely feels bland compared to her other songs

**GARjuna** (6): fine? I think in general I would like more of a rise/fall or structure to these songs

**IIIHenryIII** (6): That guitar just gave me an eargasm. Holy moly! I'm being generous to this one only because of the instruments. Her voice gets too high here and had me lowering the volume a couple times. It was quite unpleasing

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's very Aretha

**Roxieloxie** (10): Honestly I just want to know which vine yall are referencing because there are like 5 great choices

**TiltControls** (9.2): rip vine. Anyways it's been memed a lot on the internet, but I think people also forget how BIG this was for Motown as their first #1 hit song. Also it's a bop through and through. And in my research I found out that the group formed from their [high school's glee club,](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Marvelettes) yet all the glee comments are on other songs 🤔🤔🤔 strange

#DO THE TIKTOK RATE

**frogaranaman** (11): definitely throwing ass to this one

**2dina3dworld** (10): WOAH HEY HEY MR. POSTMAN

**bespectacIed** (10): fuck the beatles and the carpenters! (not too much on the latter). Have to mention that iconic vine of course

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): OMG ANTHEM. My 6-year-old anthem BLARING IT on my Fisher-Price cassette player with the attached microphone. The Marvelette's saved the USPS!!!

**GARjuna** (10): I love this song

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): [There’s this super cute video of some kids performing an ‘80s arrangement of this song on the Mickey Mouse Club 2,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tg9M1xUks-g) one of whom is Deedee Magno-Hall of *Steven Universe* fame! Anyways I kinda want this to win or at least crack the top ten since it’s so iconic, really the prototypical girl group song. This is actually the first girl group song to hit #1 on the BB100!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): remember when billie eilish deleted her twitter for a hot second when there was a viral tweet with two versions of people singing this song and she was in the obviously shittier group

**runaway3212** (10): This vine is iconic but the tiktok is iconicer

**welcome2thejam** (10): Did you fuck my mom, Mr. Postman

**bigbigbee** (9.5): the OG song to contribute to [The Jonas Brothers’ Sucker is a new and original song which doesn't plagiarize at all](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN-zHSvDc1g)

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.3): Love her smoky voice. It’s crazy to this that this one song built the house of Motown - the entirety of Hitsville U.S.A. empire was birthed by this lone track, it’s truly a seismic shift in pop music. Oh, the Carpenters’ cover is a 3, and I’m saying that as someone who loves the Carpenters.

**1998tweety** (9): good meme

**akanewasright** (9): I hope that vine gets played a bunch of times during the reveal to tease songs that aren’t this one

**thedoctordances1940** (9): a classic

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Oh shit, this is a certified bop! It sounds like something I heard before. I swear I heard this exact backing track in another song

**plastichaxan** (8.5): i hate how i could only think about the audio of the girls singing this very badly

**stryxen** (8.5): yass! Wait a minute!

**bbfan132** (8): enjoyable!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PN-zHSvDc1g

**NotWith10000Men** (7.8): this is such a cute idea for a song

**celladonn** (7.5): Girl it's not the postman's fault your boyfriend is ghosting you, stop harassing the poor guy

**cherryices** (7.3): that one vine kind of outsold

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): the E-Mail My Heart of its time

**trashypanini** (7): I’ve heard this one 12 million times on my dads Motown tape and it definitely was the first song on it. A perfect pop hit in my eyes. Infectious hook and some character in the lead vocalist that is easy to mimic.

**orangetangerine** (6.8): It's not a bad song, there are just so many good ones from this decade.

**rickikardashian** (6.8): I've never actually sent a physical letter, but once my ubereats stole the food i ordered, and i bet the feeling i had each time I checked the app to see if my food was ever going to get delivered was very similar to what these girls were going through

**jman457** (6.7): invented cursive singing

**anothertown** (6.5): The vine is better than the song! I really believe this!

**seanderlust** (6.1): this is a classic and I want to like it, but I really don't like the sound of the background singers now that I pay more attention

**AHSWeeknd** (6): The memes ran this bop into the ground

**ignitethephoenix** (6): these backup vocalists are not it, this poor lead singer

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I’d rather listen to the Vine cover… no I am not specifying which Vine cover

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (4): For some reason, I've never cared for the Marvelettes, with one exception. But that exception isn't this

**rslashpoopheads** (1): yuck

**Roxieloxie** (10): Honestly this song is just so fun!! I have nothing to say about it other than the fact that I wish it wouldve done a little bit better, I hate you all!!!

**TiltControls** (10): You're all just trying to get me to use my songeniality votes on day 1 songs huh. This was an 11 contender for me so I'm sad to see it not even make it to day 2. I know 'fun bop' isn't exactly the pinnacle of music commentary in this rate, but it does it well. Also though no one can top the original, I do really like [Pixie Lott's version](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QbAjDfgwWvA) too if you haven't heard it.

#Fun!!!

**bbfan132** (10): this song gets better and better as it goes on, wonderful

**bespectacIed** (10): stream Hozier - Jackie and Wilson aka his best song [**Host Note** *this is a spill go stream this*]

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): Is this song the pinnacle of male achievement? Maybe. Is it absolutely the highlight of a career that doesn't get nearly as much attention as it deserves? Yes.

**frogaranaman** (10): iconic music video

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The amazon commercial with this song isn’t too bad but whew what a classic.

**jsonphile** (10): this song makes me feel happier and happier

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (10): such a feel good song, there's no way you can listen to this without moving even a little bit

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.3): Pure liquid sunshine.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): The video for this is an experience

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This one is always fun to listen to

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): bop!!!

**avenueroy** (8.2): This song is so fun and joyful. Honestly though the superior version of the song is the one from the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame 25th Anniversary with Bruce Springsteen, Darlene Love, Sam Moore, Billy Joel, Tom Fogerty, Tom Morello and The E Street Band.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): sir please i am very scared of heights and commitment put me down

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): stream Higher by pop king Taio Cruz

**plastichaxan** (7.5): me but with weed

**jman457** (7.4): Would be Higher and Higher if a m*n didnt sing it

**1998tweety** (7): chorus needed more punch

**trashypanini** (7): Uplifting love type doo-pop track. Instantaneously recognizable. Jackies voice cutting through And gets you moving too.

**celladonn** (6.5): "[Jackie Wilson] had a habit of taking a handful of salt tablets and drinking large amounts of water before each performance, to create profuse sweating. Wilson told Elvis Presley, "The chicks love it."" Lmao?

#People who have tanked closer

**runaway3212** (6): the only dud here imo

**seanderlust** (5.8): a couple of the songs in this rate are tanked by the background singers sounding pretty harsh. this is one of them

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): It's definitely not bad, but it just ain't for me, like a lot of the songs in this rate

**NotWith10000Men** (5.2): pretty standard 60s bop tbh

**rslashpoopheads** (5): um hehe

**NewAccountNow** (0): While i truly don't think it's a 0, compared to others in the list it simply doesnt stand a chance. i found myself not liking this song at all and feeling like it was a weak track in an otherwise very difficult selection among these songs. Most tracks in this list are very very close in rating except for this one. that makes it a 0 for me.

**TiltControls** (8.7): poor Martha and The Vandellas already losing 2/3 of their songs day 1 😔. Another song that's just pure fun (although with these lyrics don't be surprised to see a them sung by a creepy 10 year old girl for a horror movie trailer at some point)

**Roxieloxie** (8): bop!

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an eleven contender, a bop that stands the test of time

**bbfan132** (10): i feel like i’m in the room listening to them sing this, so good

**qazz23** (10): Everything about this is great! Superb vocals and a catchy hook, and I like the chains used as percussion (11 candidate)

**runaway3212** (10): This title is so ominous

**whizzer0** (10): Almost gave this my 11, I've liked it for a while. It is a banger. I didn't notice the chain sounds before.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): a music video, we love budget!

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): these lyrics are so menacing i … will simply not percieve them

**jman457** (8.9): an anthemic bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): toxic relationship anthem!!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): hamsters be like

**plastichaxan** (8): this blended so much with dancing in the street for me lemme give them the same score

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): sounds like it could be in a movie soundtrack

**trashypanini** (7): This is definitely apart of the creepy codependent/obsessive love pop canon of course 💀. Great vocals all around. The production and BG vocalists kind of give this a sinister slant.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh thank goodness the Vandellas have a song that isn’t annoying

**welcome2thejam** (7): Has anyone used a slow, melodramatic cover or remix of this song for a movie trailer yet, cause it seems ripe for the picking

**NotWith10000Men** (6.9): I like the nowhere to run, nowhere to hide part in the background

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): this would be a really good horror movie song

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's aight

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): I had to go back and check if it wasn’t the same song that was playing before. Well, it’s gonna get the same score

**1998tweety** (5): im sorry but that rattle thing is taking me out of the entire song, for the first couple seconds i kept looking around my room to see if something was moving.

**TiltControls** (9.6): And we've got our last elimination for the day! I'm a little saddened this just barely missed out as it's my favourite Temptations song, but with 24 other songs gone the competition's only going to get fiercer. It's a little sad (and a little creepy honestly too), but if there's one thing the 60's knows well it's covering up questionable lyrics with a bright and cheery demeanor! (And doing it really fucking well)

**Roxieloxie** (8): Leave the temptations alone!!!

---

**bespectacIed** (10): super fucking smooth

**cremeebrulee** (10): i mean i get it but also you could not pay me to ever admit this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Nooo my reign of 10s will never end. But I have to give ONE TEN to thee iconic Temptations!!! Remember when boy bands could sing?? my lewronggeneration era. The harmonies and David Fuffin's gravelly voice, so dynamic and great.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we need men that are fine with BEGGING for love

**stryxen** (10): im trying to be misandrist stop making good songs

**waluigiest** (10): this has an incredible, down-to-earth energy

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): when are we rating TLC again

**seanderlust** (9): simping before it was cool

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): classic but not my favorite

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): classic but TLC’s “ain’t 2 proud 2 beg” still might mop with this a little

**jman457** (7.6): alright

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): leave him! wait

**plastichaxan** (7.5): why are there so many songs like this in the rate please

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): enough with the co-dependency anthems, I do beg

**AHSWeeknd** (7): a bop but it gets old quick

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Maneskin is shaking

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Here was I thinking "The Temptations" was a girl group lol

**orangetangerine** (7): A classic.

**runaway3212** (6.5): this isnt bad but it's a little bit creepy

**2dina3dworld** (6): BEG! Beg like the people who want Sunglasses in All Stars!

**rslashpoopheads** (6): baby baby

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Not nearly as catchy as their other songs in my opinion

rslashpoopheads: I made a very intentional effort to stop being noncommittal in rates and giving every song a 6-8 score but now I just look angry and bitter!
