**TiltControls** (10): We're starting today off rough huh. I'm not super surprised this is leaving now, but I am sad to see it go. Sure it's just a super sweet love song but it does it so well and has this super relaxing feeling to it. Reminds me a lot of another one of my faves, Can't Help Falling in Love. This actually was doing well for a very very brief period at the start, though at least this is definitely better than a day 1 elim.

**Roxieloxie** (7.6): *zach fox voice* shout out balladphobia, shout our balladphobia 

---

#Chained to the Vocals

**bbfan132** (10): so relaxing lol

**celladonn** (10): A fucking hit

**Gonza\_90** (10): RIP Patrick Swayze

**halibut1234** (10): If "Soul and Inspiration" was on this rate, it would be my 11.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Holy shit! This is actually amazing! I find the snippets of the movie so cheesy, but hearing the whole song now has changed my whole perception of it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I’ve played the Orville Peck/Paul Cauthen cover of this so much that this version sounds weird now

**jsonphile** (10): someone serenade me with this I’m so lonely

**seanderlust** (10): this is just so pretty. I feel similarly about this as I do about ladies and gentlemen we're floating in space

**twinfiresigns14** (10): - Holy shit, okay, I’ve heard this song, but only the opening notes

**vayyiqra** (10): This song drives me nuts because no matter how many times I heard it I can never remember how it goes, and then I hear it and remember "oh yeah that song". It might be because it's such a weird title and it means nothing to me. Still a classic though.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.2): What a haunting and innocently beautiful song

**dance\_apoptosistic** (9): I don't particularly enjoy the Righteous Brothers' version of this, but it spawned so many absolutely essential covers that even today I can't figure out whose is best.

**runaway3212** (9): bop!

**skargardin** (9): VOCALS

**welcome2thejam** (9): Whatever unseen apparition is moving my arms to try and make me give this an 11 better knock tf off

**whizzer0** (9): I like Nataly Dawn & Imaginary Future's cover from the Sisters soundtrack but the original is amazing too.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): they don't make ballads like this anymore (positive)

**stryxen** (8): very nice!

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I feel like I know this song better by name than the actual music, but it is cute

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): This sounds gorgeous, though by the time they sang “time goes by so slowly” I was realizing the song sorta does too

**1998tweety** (7.5): nice

**2dina3dworld** (7): when all the men in your life love this song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): where is this song from i swear i recognize it

**jaztinax** (7): hearing this song makes me sigh the same way i do when hallelujah comes on because i feel like it’s so overdone. but it’s still a pretty good song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Yet another song my parents love, and yeah I like it too

#The pathalogical aversion to, hatread of

**AHSWeeknd** (6): How much can time do?

**slimboyfriend** (6): Hollywood has ruined this song for me because it's only ever used ironically in movies

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (5): I'm always surprised that people like this. It's just so boring?

**plastichaxan** (5): i guess time does go by so slowly

**jman457** (4): felt like a chore to sit through, sorry im just Balladphobic :/

**trashypanini** (3): a codependent dull ballad. And the hungered touch lines are giving creepy 💀. Very hollow and soulless voices. With tepid production. Sounds like a white 60s school dance final song.

**waluigiest** (0): sorry no spice

**TiltControls** (10): I can't believe Dionne has become a master of twitter and social media only for y'all to eliminate her before the songs got into the 8 averages. For a while she was completely gone day 1 so although this is a bit better, it's still highway robbery imo. Another song I almost considered for an 11. The song just has this unabashed coolness factor to it despite the sad lyrics and Dionne's vocals are super smooth as always. Like with Unchained Melody this was day 3 for a period of time too (actually a lot of songs going today were very close average-wise at the start so you may see a lot of that)

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Why is Auntie Dionne getting absolutely decimated in this rate,,,, why are we doing a pop culture icon like this,,,,,,,

---

#One kiss is all it takes

**AHSWeeknd** (10): such a classic, and tbh an eleven contender.

**bbfan132** (10): god this is amazing, dionne’s delivery is perfect here

**bespectacIed** (10): so beautiful. The mv though, dionne literally a hot girl

**cremeebrulee** (10): she really said if you see me crying no the fuck you didn’t

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow the crescendoing piano makes me ascend

**frogaranaman** (10): she really is walking on by!!!!!

**runaway3212** (10): Walking on by is underrated more annoying people should try it

**TragicKingdom1** (10): we need the dionne AMA

**waluigiest** (10): the structure of this is incredible

**whizzer0** (10): I don't have much to say but it's a classic

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.2): The “Don’t! Stop!” gets me every time.

**akanewasright** (9): so is the message of this song literally “if you see me being sad on main, no you didn’t”? Because mood

**CrimsonROSET** (9): any dua lipa comments are going to jail

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Stealing from an independent artist like Raye is not cool >:(

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this song is just “If i’m ever sad, just mind your business” and if that’s not the most relatable message in the rate

**thedoctordances1940** (9): gorgeous

**trashypanini** (9): I love the journey of this song almost more than I love the song LMAO. Looking down the list of who covered/semi covered it is just a list of Black legendary talents. Anyways Dionne’s voice and the instrumentation of those two white dudes (they names long 💀) was that combo. The Dionne’s clear voice of determination to sell the subjects move forward from a past relationship just makes this song more relatable.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Tell me why out of all the sad songs in this rate this is the one I relate the most to… ;_;

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): *insert funny Dionne Warwick tweet here*

**joeeswift** (8): the last 30 seconds with the fade out is *chefs kiss*

**ManofOranges** (8): Lovin the more laid back sound on this one

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I want to like miss Warwick’s music more but it’s not terribly exciting to me. The strings when they kicked in were great though

**jman457** (7.5): Very easy listening its almost boring

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (6.7): reminds me of carole king

#Im posting this on twitter and getting her to cancel all you

**seanderlust** (6.4): this is an anthem for people who walk down the street with headphones in fully ignoring everything around them (me)

**NotWith10000Men** (6): pretty but too slow

**GARjuna** (4): there's nothing to really write home about

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This is just boring

**rslashpoopheads** (3): blah

**Roxieloxie** (10): Car commercial  anthem!!

**TiltControls** (8.7): Just a fun song all around! I don't really have much else to say about it beyond that really. Definitely no sexual jokes to make here.

#People who get it 

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THE CHOREO HERE!!

**bbfan132** (10): those vocals… damn - i’ve heard this before but i didn’t know who sang it until now

**CrimsonROSET** (10): what are they doing to that turtle

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the horn line alone makes this song unimpeachable

**qazz23** (10): I like the soulful vocals and horn section (11 candidate)

**rslashpoopheads** (10): oh this FUCKS!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Absolutely iconic horns that will be stuck in my head til the day I die

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.8): *Whitney Houston voice* I listen to SINGERS. I very rarely listen to people who cannot sing.

**stryxen** (9): classic

**vayyiqra** (9): That horn line is so catchy.

**jman457** (8.7): A groovy little tune

**anothertown** (8): This is the same as the other song but they are both equally good

**nootnoot781** (8): me when i

**rickikardashian** (8): im not going to make the obvious joke im not going to make the obvious joke im not going to make the obvious joke im not goi

**trashypanini** (8): The genius revealed story behind this iconic joint is funny. A gospel influenced booming track with straightforwardly fun lyrics.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I kinda wanted this song to build up more as it went on… It starts at a 9 but then hovers around a 7 for the rest of it

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this trumpet line I didn’t realize it was from this song but it’s so recognizable!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Another classic that just doesn't do much for me

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this gives me heavy sanford and son vibes

**runaway3212** (7.5): a tad basic but not bad at all

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (7.5): ? i feel like this has been tainted for me by the amount of tv shows and adverts it's used in in the uk

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**plastichaxan** (7): another song in the rate where such an easy joke could be made plss

#My man is going apeshit on the horns and you're worried about vocals???

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I’m glad he’s coming over because I cannot understand a word he’s saying from all the way over there

**fadedblue09** (4): "Sam & Dave" sounds like the name of a sitcom that will be cancelled in a year.

**stryxen** (7.5): cute bop

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's nice and groovy at least

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Well I don’t think they lied

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): just makes me think of that weird blackface movie

**trashypanini** (6.5): a nice simple southern grit high energy track.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Not that bad

**Roxieloxie** (9): you know how in pop rap we were like 'you know the misoginy really ads flavor' thats this rate with the relationship songs

**TiltControls** (8.9): and so we're finally in the 8+ range (okay maybe not *finally*, but there are a few songs that left in the 7 range that deserved much better). Anyways this is the first Supremes song we've got going out and it's probably the right one. It's a bop (as their songs are) and the lyrics are worrying (as some of their songs are) but I think most of the others pull off that energy a bit better. Still, it's The Supremes! I can't not score them highly.

---

#Cause when we sad and we boppin we soppin

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The Supremes were literally the best group ever, Beatles whom??

**bbfan132** (10): “I've given up my friends just for you” oh no, this guy is a piece of shit……

**CrimsonROSET** (10): girls i just told y’all! leave him!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): More than any other song in the rate this one really takes me back to the era, I feel like I’m in the audience bopping gently along to the Supremes

**ImADudeDuh** (10): for such a fun chorus and an innocent title, the lyrics of the song are like “fuck i’m always sad now that you’re gone, just please come back and love me again (🎵🎶🎶come see about me!🎶🎶🎵)”

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): You can hear Ross winking on this come-hither track.

**ManofOranges** (10): I think I just might

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (10): That "keeps me cryin baby for you" melody is my favorite Motown moment ever

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): I think this is the original ethereal music, Cocteau Twins it's over sweetie

**jaztinax** (9): the superior unholy trinity song

**qazz23** (9): Love the harmonies that lead up to the chorus

**runaway3212** (9): So true

**akanewasright** (8.9): THIS FEELS EMOTIONALLY ABUSIVE WOOOO WHAT A BOP

**1998tweety** (7.5): cute

#See no evil

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): The chorus is very disappointing

**rslashpoopheads** (7): this title is freaking me out what is English

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s alright, not bad by any means, but nothing makes it stand out to me compared to the other songs

**orangetangerine** (6.8): This is my least favorite Supremes hit out of all the ones on the list but it's still a great one.

**jman457** (6.2): Catchy but in an annoying way

**NotWith10000Men** (5): I can't tell if I'm running out of steam for comments near the very end of the rate or if the songs close to the end just genuinely aren't as good

#Fuck u/jackisboredtoday !!!!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an honest bop

**bigbigbee** (10): I feel like all people with dance experience must love this song…it’s a perfect dance song. The build, the intro, the rhythms.

**cremeebrulee** (10): jackhastraumatoday

**CrimsonROSET** (10): why is this so associated with country idk

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Catchiest song of all time? Maybe

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fun fact: this song is on Just Dance 2016

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the backup singers are fucking carrying

**qazz23** (10): Short and super catchy, like the multiple vocalists (11 candidate)

**rslashpoopheads** (10): an iconic moment in defeating men brought to you by a man

**runaway3212** (10): what can I even say it's so attention grabbing with the call and response and just super fun

**welcome2thejam** (10): Hearing this song get played all the time at sports games has turned it into an unironic jock jam of the highest caliber

**jaztinax** (9): i used to feel so sassy singing this as a kid

**waluigiest** (9): I think this was in some animated movie when I was a kid and I loved it

**jman457** (8.5): A bit short but also a bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): me when /u/jackisboredtoday gives a song i like a bad score

**bbfan132** (8): too short but good

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes alright

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): very iconic for something so short

**seanderlust** (7.5): get his ass sis

**trashypanini** (7.5): An iconic hit and has that full band jazzy-blusey hybrid charm. The BG vocalists shine the most. And I remember their coos throughout the song really selling home the point of kicking someone to the curb.

**orangetangerine** (7.2): This song makes me miss going to live baseball games.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Yeah it’s famous, but also… meh it’s okay

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Is this an interlude?

**twinfiresigns14** (6): - Classic kiss-off song

#the rate trauma section

**Motm-track9** (6.8): this song is fantastic but it just fucking annoys me i'm sorryyyyyy

**2dina3dworld** (4): I had a teacher who’s favourite song was this song. Unfortunately all this song reminds me of is cringy memories

**IIIHenryIII** (3): Yes please, Jack! Hit the road so you can all end this song immediately

**stryxen** (3): i have a friend called jack ive heard this too many times

**thedoctordances1940** (3): this just makes me remember the times when I would sing this in a metal-screamo voice when I was like 14. I honestly don't have a fucking clue why I ever did that but please lemme forget those memories

**vayyiqra** (1): I've never liked this song ever since I was a kid. It irks me. Idk.

**jackisboredtoday** (0): listen i have a story but i don’t feel in the mood to put it here rn

**Roxieloxie** (10): Honestly, this did not deserve to be out before at last. I took a somewhat 'arts' class freshman year and we just did alot of random shit, but one of the things we had to do for class one day was to take a song and make a skit from it and my group got assigned this song, its just so stunning

**TiltControls** (10): Our first tie! And another elimination I'm sad to see go. While At Last is nice, it does feel a little overplayed at times. This song does an excellent job also showing off Etta's gorgeous vocals while not feeling as overdone. Also as mentioned below Beyoncé does an excellent cover of this (though I don't think it tops the original)

---

#I WAS JUST!!! I WAS JUST!!!

**orangetangerine** (11): This song is one of my all-time favorites. Beyoncé did a fantastic cover of this song for the Cadillac Records soundtrack which is totally worth the listen.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THIS COMPOSITION, they just don’t do it like this anymore

**anothertown** (10): Absolute legend shit

**bbfan132** (10): GOD this is perfect ugh, the passion….

**bespectacIed** (10): Stunning, iconic. Wish sunday kind of love was sneaked into this rate damn. Probably my favorite soul song of all time

**jaztinax** (10): tennessee whiskey outsold

**rickikardashian** (10): the beyonce version of this is one of the best recorded pieces of media

**stryxen** (10): 11 contender this is just perfect

**NotWith10000Men** (9.8): never heard this one before but instantly saved it

**jman457** (9.2): remember Beyonce’s iconic cover

**runaway3212** (9): This is such a cruel song I love it

**seanderlust** (8.5): a gorgeous bluesy number that really showcases etta's voice

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8): he ain’t worth it! get the fuck out girl!

**GARjuna** (8): great love song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Etta James would do well in Bird Box

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Where is Something’s Got a Hold on Me!! Oh well this is good too

**2dina3dworld** (7): I’m sure there’s other less drastic measures to take

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I like how the strings sound on this one. If there's something I'm learning with this rate it is that I really love the way they used strings back then

**rslashpoopheads** (7): this is so cozy

#Perish!

**trashypanini** (6): Struggle love series continues 💀 Etta sounds superb and her grit and dark texture in voice is beautiful. & I loved the levels of emotion Bey took this song to in her cover too ofc Etta would balk at the thought💀. But on the real the song is a hot mess lyric wise.

**Roxieloxie** (10): My mom's favorite artsit is stevie wonder so all of these songs just make me nostaglic 

**TiltControls** (7.4): It's fine, but compared to a lot of other Stevie ballads (especially his later ones) it feels a little unremarkable. Also could've definitely done more with the French (even if I can hardly speak a lick of it anymore). // Je ne peux plus parler français s'il vous plaît ignorez mon désordre d'une section. J'ai juste jeté ceci dans traduire un peu et l'ai appelé un jour.

#People who are gonna support kappy's 70s rate

**2dina3dworld** (10): yay for 60s love songs!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I read this as “My Cherry Armour”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Can't believe Stevie invented yacht rock. Thank u king.

**fadedblue09** (10): Feels weird to not comment on any of the Stevie songs sp I'll say this is my favorite

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omelette du fromage

**ManofOranges** (10): Stevie wonder album rate when???

**runaway3212** (10): Imagine getting this sung about you

**vayyiqra** (10): I can't listen to this without thinking about how in the film Silver Linings Playbook, this song is a trigger that sends Bradley Cooper into a violent rage, which is funny and ironic because it's quite a pleasant song.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This song just fills me up with the most warm, heartfelt nostalgia from my childhood! (no I’m not old my dad just loves Stevie)

**orangetangerine** (9): I always forget this is a 60's song.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): what you’re doin to me mon cherie

**NotWith10000Men** (8.6): every time someone makes a stevie wonder reference when a ref blows a call I'm like stevie fucking wonder does NOT deserve that slander

**bbfan132** (8.5): stevie sounds great here

**jsonphile** (8.5): it’s a shame Stevie Wonder’s best songs are from the 70’s. Especially because then Superstition would easily be my 11

**CrimsonROSET** (8): fuck the french

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): stalker anthem tbh

**seanderlust** (7.6): love the "maybe someday i'll share your little distant cloud" line

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.3): Still prefer ‘70s Stevie [2].

**jman457** (7.2): alright little tune

**1998tweety** (7): alright

#at this point this sections is just me bullying the same 3 people over and over

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Sorry Stevie but I must decline

**rslashpoopheads** (5): the fact that they couldn't do the full french phrase really bothers me

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): Thank God this is short

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): Thinking about the carly rae jepson version

**TiltControls** (8.8): And there goes the other Ray Charles track. And another song that's just played as a ballad reliant on the strength of the vocals to really sell the song. And Ray Charles does an excellent job selling them for sure. I've been to Georgia once. It was cool. They've got a sweet aquarium in Atlanta.

---

#Yes there are Peaches in georgia 

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Aren’t there peaches in Georgia.

**bbfan132** (10): the vocals are excellent here

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic

**CrimsonROSET** (10): we love a self-fulfilling song

**jsonphile** (10): I mean it’s Ray Charles of course it’s getting a 10

**NotWith10000Men** (10): if you didn't feel it in your soul as soon as he said georgia, are you actually from the south

**seanderlust** (10): this is gorgeous. also apparently georgia made this the state song after a civil rights conflict which feels...weird? georgia in its apology era

**twinfiresigns14** (10): The harmonies, Charles's just-raspy-enough-to-be-perfect voice, and everything on this track are impeccable. The arrangements are glorious and remind me of Disney songs (a compliment). I love this sort of gospel music. The lyrics are a little basic, but the arrangements are a religious experience.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This is such a beautiful, poetic ode to a state that I most strongly associate with my first time consuming Zaxby’s (a good thing…big fan of the Zappetizers.) I’m a big fan of this type of sweet, soulful music – I don’t know what the exact brand of pop soul is called, but it’s super soothing.

**runaway3212** (9.5): I literally never think about georgia but good for you I guess

**fadedblue09** (9): The wailing at 2:45 sends me

**ignitethephoenix** (9): so I watched the movie Ray with my dad the other day so this song actually grew on me

**ImADudeDuh** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wm_2ltbBDZo

**skargardin** (9): This isn't directly related to this song but what I love about this rate is that it's such an easy playlist to just press play and just vibe to, just wanted to put it out there!

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (8.5): Loses half a point for making me sad that I can't rate Midnight Train to Georgia

**plastichaxan** (8.5): the blueprint for that one kevin abstract song

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.3): why does this remind me of a christmas song

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**2dina3dworld** (8): why would anyone want to think about Georgia - oh wait, it’s about a girl. Moving on.

**jaztinax** (8): this is one of those songs that i really enjoy but i never remember the melody besides “georgiaaaa”

**thedoctordances1940** (8): so true stream about work the dancefloor by georgia

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): Trump during the 2020 Election

**anothertown** (7): this is one of the sweetest songs but i swear those backing vocals were recorded in 1890

**joeeswift** (7): any rhoa fans out there? Im missing our Georgia peaches :’(

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): You know what I realized? There isn’t exactly anything in this song that’s very Georgia specific… Like what, pines? What state doesn’t have pines? You could replace “Georgia” with the name of any other place and nothing would really be taken away from the song...

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): what if we took Peaches and replaced it with this

#Brian Kemp's alts

**vayyiqra** (6): I know this is a classic but never cared for this song much. Idk why. It's okay.

**jman457** (5.2): Honestly reminds me of a boring Billy Joel song but about Georgia instead of NYC

**trashypanini** (5): Never heard this one. And sorry but I love my state/town songs automatically loose me. Still a nice jazzy production with a charming vocal by Charles. Score:

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This song feels way longer than it actually is, which is not a good thing

**stryxen** (4): a bit boring i'm afraid

**TiltControls** (11): And there goes the 11 : ( This rate had such tough competition for it, but in the end this one won out. This song just wrecks me. I feel like my appreciation for this song has as much to do with the background context as the actual song. For those who don't know Tammi Tarrell (featured in the rate here and on the probably more famous 'Ain't No Mountain') had her music career cut tragically short due to a diagnosis of brain cancer. She powered through the recording of this song despite recovering from brain surgery, but by the time it was released she was more or less unable to perform live due to the aggressiveness of the cancer. She would pass away only a year or so later at 24. To me this song is the ultimate song of both being there for someone when things get rough and in turn gaining strength from your friends or loved ones or whoever to keep going. It gets me emotional thinking about how much life she had left to live and despite the negative diagnosis how the song keeps up such an optimistic point of view. I understand it going now due to the strong competition, but definitely sad to see it leave.

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): How dare you all do my Co-Hostie's 11 like this!!! This song is so amazing im so sad it didnt do better

---

#Lean on me

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Marvin and Tammi were truly a force to be reckoned with. They made the best bops ever

**anothertown** (10): I think of Scandal everytime i hear this song but it's still a 10 because i'm stronger than shonda rhimes

**bbfan132** (10): one of the best duets ever [2]

**bespectacIed** (10): ok this is a niche comment but what's generally considered the most iconic Filipino song of all time (Eraserheads - Ang Huling El Bimbo) slightly ripped off the opening melody of this and I can't deny it lolzz

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I can't, I just love this duo so much

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): [One of our users did a great writeup about Tammi Terrell](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6puuyr/throwback_aint_no_mountain_high_enough_the/) that’s definitely worth a read, for example it might shock you to learn that she actually recorded this song while recovering from *brain surgery*! She had a tragically short life but she brought so much light to the world.

**jman457** (10): This song kind of gives me life

**runaway3212** (10): Marvin gaye just can't do wrong

**cremeebrulee** (9): this song is great but i cannot listen to it without thinking of a olivia/fitz amv i once saw

**jaztinax** (9): glee introduced me to this song lol but this and the glee version both slap

**qazz23** (9): Great duet

**avenueroy** (8.6): This song is so underrated compared to Ain't No Mountain High Enough

**trashypanini** (8.5): My favorite of the Tammi and Marvin duets. They sound amazing here. A song about endearing all of life through the love of one another.

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**CrimsonROSET** (8): get a fucking room

**jsonphile** (8): not nearly as good as their much more well known collaboration, but still a good song

**seanderlust** (8): we stan supportive relationships

**stryxen** (8): bop!!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Well now this is cute

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): Of their two songs in this rate, that’s definitely the superior one

**orangetangerine** (7.4): This song has one foot firmly grounded in 1970's sound. Love it.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): can someone fucking date me already, this joke has gone on long enough

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): so true

**twinfiresigns14** (5): I liked the harmony in this!

**TiltControls** (8.9): This song has DRAMA painted all over it. The bombastic instrumentation does a great job here and Dusty herself sounds excellent with her pleading. The lead into the chorus especially deserves a shoutout here. I feel like at this point so many songs have been worrying lyrically that I don't even have to point them out anymore.

**Roxieloxie** (7): gotta love theatrics

---

#They told you this was melodrama

**1998tweety** (11): i found out of this song cause of the lipsync on DRUKS2 and I've been obsessed ever since.

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (11): I just love the production on this song, it's so perfect. Nevertheless, there were like 4 or 5 songs that could have gotten my 11 on a different day

**AHSWeeknd** (10): AN ELEVEN CONTENDER, WHY AM I CRYING

**bespectacIed** (10): no mother in the english speaking world has not sung this on karaoke my godddd this brings up so many memories

**bigbigbee** (10): THE DRAMAAAAA OF IT ALL, YESSSSSSSSSSS LADY SINGGGG

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): Such a great song regardless of who sings it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Now why wasn’t Ellie in the bottom for this episode

**ManofOranges** (10): This is one of those songs where I didn't realize I'd heard it until I heard the chorus does that make sense

**orangetangerine** (10): Quite possibly one of my favorite songs written in 12/8. The only reason I probably have never picked this for karaoke before is because I default to another Dusty Springfield song, lol. When this comes on the radio and I'm in the car alone I turn up the volume and belt it with all the feels.

**plastichaxan** (10): i promo'd the rate with this song during the HAP reveal and i have to admit, i just looked over very quickly and see what could fit without knowing i chose a 10 and one of my favorite songs of the rate

**jaztinax** (9.6): i live for the drama of it all. the intro?? all drama queens should enter a room with this intro playing. the melody?? fabulous

**celladonn** (9.5): I am obsessed with her voice

**seanderlust** (9.5): the bargaining stage in song form

**bbfan132** (9): great vocals here!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): no but i do love this

**GARjuna** (9): FUCK YES

**rslashpoopheads** (9): love the melodramatic intro!

**runaway3212** (9): The Drama! The Story! The Liary!

**thedoctordances1940** (9): so true

**akanewasright** (8.5): Man… the clinginess didn’t have to go this hard

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is giving me the climax of a musical where the protagonist is at her breaking point

**waluigiest** (8): huge!!

**avenueroy** (7.1): This song is a classic, but I feel like it either needed to be longer or shorter. The first verse and chorus are amazing, incredible, iconic, then the song just kind of ends after the second verse and chorus. It either needed a bridge or to be cut in half because the end kind of wears the whole thing down IMO.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): the bar is so low it’s in hell

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): this is soooo dramatic

**jman457** (6.3): Doesnt have much personality

#No respect for the arts

**stryxen** (6): this is so intense and i cannot tell if it really needs to be

**trashypanini** (6): Just hollow in delivery. A great building instrumentation.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): I had high hopes for this one… what a shame! I must say that I love her name though. I could see myself naming my child after her, if I wanted to have kids.

**anothertown** (5): snooze

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): ...Well, Preacher Man was definitely an improvement over this

**TiltControls** (9.1): I like sugar pie and I like honey bunch(es of oats), but they do not make great pet names lmao. Anyways the song is a bop! It's got this infectious nature to it that just makes it so easy to bounce along to.

**Roxieloxie** (9): i just think its neat [2]

---

#Throwing ass at the sock hop (idk where teens hung out in the 60s)

**anothertown** (10): YUP YUP YUP

**avenueroy** (10): One of the many songs in this rate that deserves an 11, but has to settle for a lower score. This song is perfect.

**bespectacIed** (10): Every time I listen to anything motown I keep reminded that black people really invented pop, it's insane

**ImADudeDuh** (10): sugar pie sounds very unhealthy but I do love honey bunches of oats cereal

**ManofOranges** (10): Sugar honey iced tea this is good

**rslashpoopheads** (10): a serious 11 contender

**runaway3212** (10): I am so fucking hungry I cannot

**skargardin** (10): this is stupidly catchy

**jsonphile** (9.5): reach out I’ll be there should’ve also been on this list (would’ve been a 10) but this also an absolute bop

**orangetangerine** (9.5): Motown at its finest.

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): imagine having a nickname based on a dessert lmao

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**2dina3dworld** (9): help why does the start sound like Come on Eileen’s chorus.

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Now I want some pie

**bbfan132** (9): first heard this on american idol years ago lol, it’s a good song!

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.9): Diabetic coma.

**akanewasright** (8.7): my moms used to sing this to me as a lullaby

**BB-TheBest22** (8.2): Reach Out, I’ll Be There is a 10

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i’m sorry but ‘four tops’ is just such a baffling name why would you call yourself that

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): four tops, you say?

**IIIHenryIII** (8): No bottoms? Guess I'm spending too much time on r/phcj. Genuine question, why were men making the happiest tracks back then?

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): these men down bad bad

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): we need the hosts to play Sugah Daddy by D’Angelo after this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): *insert jokes about the name of this group here*

**trashypanini** (7.5): zomg this song is childhood jam. I’m not 60 something, but my dad is (now) and he’s always played this along other Motown hits on this one compilation tape he got in the 80s. Listening to it is a portal to long trips on the road and the volume raised to like 11 not 10.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.3): this is a nice little bop

**seanderlust** (7.1): I can't help myself from making a four tops joke

#The tupperware in the bottom of the cabinent 

**letsallpoo** (6): bracing myself for comments on the name of this group

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The longer this song goes on, the more I think “Sugar pie honey bunch” is a phrase that should not exist

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): the pet names are too much for me

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): lemme misandryfying my scores

**fadedblue09** (5): A little discomforting

**stryxen** (5): whatever that means

**plastichaxan** (4): there’s such an easy joke about the group’s name...i don’t want to be the one to make it...pleek

**twinfiresigns14** (4): - Again, if I hadn't heard other versions of this, I might've liked it better. Doesn't do much for me.

**jman457** (0): The shape of you of the 1960’s, as its very annoying. (also sounds a little creepy in today's context)

**TiltControls** (10): While the Shirelles do an excellent job here, I think it's just a perfectly written song (Carole King is a legend for a reason) - even if it's a bit simple. Is it a little clingy - probably. But it's sweet and has a fun rhythm to it! For covers Amy Winehouse in particular does an amazing job and Carole's version is also quite sweet.

**Roxieloxie** (7): it's fine

---

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**AHSWeeknd** (10): No ❤️

**akanewasright** (10): this was one of the first songs I learned to play on guitar… my parents weren’t impressed that I, a 13 year old, was learning a song about being worried about your hook up wouldn’t give a shit about you in the morning, but I loved it.

**anothertown** (10): This is the best song ever written there is no debate

**bbfan132** (10): i was not expecting this to be as fast paced as it is? still great

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic

**dance\_apoptosistic** (10): The first song by a Black all-girl group to reach number one in the United States, and covered brilliantly by Amy.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): STRONG eleven contender. This song is etched into my brain. One of the best melodies and harmonies of all time. I feel like the lyrics of this song are so vulnerable and gorgeous.

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): It’s kind of amazing that a song that was so frank about sex was able to top the charts in 1961. I wonder if the disarming sweetness of the vocals made it seem more innocent to the average listener back then. The song “Let’s Wait A While” by Janet Jackson is a spiritual successor to this track.

**ManofOranges** (10): Such a beautiful song to me

**orangetangerine** (10): All the years I've known this song and it never fails to make me both happy and sad at the same time.

**qazz23** (10): Love the strings here, especially before the final chorus (11 candidate)

**runaway3212** (10): no.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): aw it's so pretty

**waluigiest** (10): for a while i thought this was an Amy Winehouse original

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (9.5): I don't know why I like this one more than Carole King's version but that's not the case with Aretha. Maybe because I've been into the Brill Building sound for a while?

**cherryices** (9): i think i prefer the cover versions that kind of strip it back a little, but i have to give the original its dues

**rickikardashian** (9): inb4 someone makes about about grindr hook ups or something

**CrimsonROSET** (8): no <3

**ImADudeDuh** (8): nice

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The first time I heard this song was on a fake oldies radio station in a city building game… and I’m glad I got the chance to!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): This is quite nice. I love the backing vocals

**joeeswift** (7.5): the strings remind me of vintage Disney, beautiful

**Motm-track9** (7): anxious attachment style teas

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’m barely into this today unfortunately

**stryxen** (6): pleasant but i really don’t have much to say

**trashypanini** (5): Run of the mill ballad with tepid lead vocals.:

**twinfiresigns14** (5): for the violins/waltz style tune, but too slow for me

**rslashpoopheads** (4): no :(

**jman457** (3): Nothing really distinctive about this

**TiltControls** (9.8): Another excellent song from the queen of soul! The instrumental break when it's just Aretha, the background singers, and the clapping is top notch. And the Chain-Chain-Chain is endlessly catchy to repeat (though it does start to get repetitive near the song's end). Though it was my least favourite of the Aretha tracks still left (the others are all pure 10s), I still wish it went a little bit farther.

---

#Chain of bops

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Aretha Franklin’s vocal delivery!! I fear no other artist will ever come close.

**akanewasright** (10): There was a video of some person forgetting this song and making up their own thing on the spot for a few bars. I vividly remember “CHAIN OF LOOOOOOVE OOOOOOOH HOW YOU BEEN”. Anyway, don’t attempt aretha’s songs, especially if you’re gonna fuck them up like that.

**bbfan132** (10): classic!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Starting off STRONG with one of Aretha's finest! She commands everything, period.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when i see a swiftie chain of comments in r/popheads

**jman457** (10): one of the best by Ms. Franklin, sounds like pure expensive sex

**joeeswift** (10): this is a beautiful song, one song in and I can tell my average is going to be high

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): literally perfect and a potential eleven and it’s the first song on the playlist

**jaztinax** (9.5): immaculate, amazing, go off queen

**anothertown** (9): ⛓⛓⛓

**CrimsonROSET** (9): chainmail but make it sexy but also sad?

**jsonphile** (9): this is the weakest Aretha song on here. And it’s damn great

**NotWith10000Men** (9): my thoughts as soon as I started this playlist: I'm gonna save so many songs in this rate aren't i

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I refuse to believe that Aretha would let herself be made a fool of, but I guess I’ll engage myself in some suspension of disbelief for the sake of this song

**orangetangerine** (8.6): This is the one on the list I would've killed to see done live in person.

**trashypanini** (8.5): I love when Aretha is talking that talk about men. Aretha flirts with the secular soul/gospel sound (esp in this era) but the soaring vocals and echoing BG vocalists that kinda remind me of a humming organ all got the Black church feel which is all Aretha’s roots.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**frogaranaman** (8): chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain chain

**GARjuna** (8): this bridge (?) is everything. Reminds me of jazz standards for some reason

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Classic the chorus lives in my head

**ManofOranges** (8): Ok kind of a bop

**rslashpoopheads** (8): CHAIN CHAIN CHAIN

**runaway3212** (8): Her voice sounds so amazing here and it's so full of energy

**seanderlust** (8): chain chain chaaaain

**stryxen** (7.5): bop!

**bigbigbee** (7): Writes “chain of fools educational parody song – chain of food?” on a sticky note, puts in my desk to never be seen again

#We will never love you again

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Always found this one a bit annoying.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): The intro sounds so good but the song downgrades when all the instruments come together

**Odlawwuzhere28** (0): The "ch ch chain" I find irritating the very first time, and the repetition of it doesn't help. I also find the verse extremely forgettable. Despite having heard the song many times, I can never remember what it sounds like.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Normalize dancing in the street

**TiltControls** (10): Another song that's just a full bop!! Though Heat Wave had a much earlier exit than I was expecting, I'm glad this was at least able to make it far enough. Also random fact - way back before this was 70 songs long I was considering a tiny bonus rate of '60's covers' with the Jagger/Bowie cover of this, Jessica Simpsons' These Boots Are Made For Walking, and Britney's Satisfaction. Someone's gotta hold the 'lowest average bonus rate winner' record.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The choreo went HARD in the video for this, our generation’s main pop girls could never.

**jsonphile** (10): an absolute classic. Total bop.

**qazz23** (10): All of their hits are easy 10's

**ImADudeDuh** (9.9): remember at the start of the pandemic when people would just stand in their driveways and do jazzercise and shit? wild

**jaztinax** (9.5): oh to live in the 60s and hear this song playing at the discotheque… or whatever people called it back then

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.1): Outsold the terrible mistake that was the ‘80s Bowie-Jagger cover.

**runaway3212** (9): I would literally rather die than dance in the street

**thedoctordances1940** (9): bop

**vayyiqra** (9): Mick Jagger and David Bowie did a kind of bonkers cover of this song and I only know that and hadn't heard the original before somehow. It's pretty good.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): the winkies after the Eveline gets melted

**orangetangerine** (7.7): This song automatically gets an extra 2 points when it is played outdoors, by a DJ, at a block party.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): when i was a kid i thought this was dora the explorer’s original song https://youtu.be/h-fNjFbeLdg

**seanderlust** (7.5): promoting dancing outdoors...covid-safe queen

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this wasn’t bad but went in one ear and came out the next

**stryxen** (7): good song

**trashypanini** (6.5): A nice uptempo soulful track. And a song I haven’t heard from a group unknown to me! It’s fun with an call to some action and it has got that rock blusey surfy vibe/sound lots of early yt rockers stole.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.4): it's a jam

**rslashpoopheads** (6): in Florida it's legal to run people over if they do this

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): nah, I’m good

**Roxieloxie** (10): I hate you all so much. After being asked to co-host I asked to have this included in the rate because in my mind, its the most iconic nina song. This was really close to being my 11 so im so sad to see it go

**TiltControls** (9.5): and after a strong run so far, Nina finally loses her first song. The song is amazing though definitely weaker than her other tracks in the rate (but still a 9.5 from me lmao). This was also covered a bit later by Aretha Franklin, to excellent success!

---

#'Would've voted for obama a third time if they could'

**2dina3dworld** (10): I can’t believe Nina is all three! Truly a star.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Love this, Nina Simone basically won music.

**bbfan132** (10): beautiful

**bespectacIed** (10): She undubitably was

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Like a rallying cry and a reassuring song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ok i did NOT expect that that Aretha song was a cover

**runaway3212** (10): I can't give this any lower of course this is a 10

**skargardin** (10): oh wow

**stryxen** (10): gorgeous lyrics and instrumentation i think i stan nina simone

**waluigiest** (10): she did not know the shift in the world she was creating with this song (yes she did)

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): bonus points for a good message

**jsonphile** (9): I’m untalented, white, and starting to not be so young, so can’t relate

**trashypanini** (9): Heard Arethas musical spin on the title/track first. But unsurprised Nina had use of the title first in music. A beautiful uplifting track. First Time Score:

**orangetangerine** (8.8): Everything Nina Simone touches turns to gold.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): this is more a song i respect than like.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.2): Righteous Nina is best Nina [2].

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): maybe this isn’t for me… but usually everything is?

**jman457** (8): Preach!

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I am none of these things :sadge:

**welcome2thejam** (8): She's so good x4

**rickikardashian** (7.5): I'm sure the average popheads is really going to be able to relate to this song

**1998tweety** (7): cant relate

**twinfiresigns14** (7): This is such a cheerful song!

**vayyiqra** (7): I wish I liked this song more than I do given the message behind it. It's not bad though.

#The black squares on instagram:

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I mean I like the message of course… but it sounds like a track from a really cheesy musical 😬

**jaztinax** (6): i feel bad for not rating this high because it’s so empowering and the message is amazing, but the song itself is kind of a snooze

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I just don’t like how it sounds

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): Get ready for the restults to get worse!

**TiltControls** (9.3): While the instrumentation does drown out the rest of the song at points, it's such a bop that it doesn't even matter all that much in the scheme of things. Also no easy sex joke to make here [2]

---
#akanesharesratetrauma

**akanewasright** (10): I had an audition at a really good theater school, and the dance audition was set to this song. I did absolutely horrible and I didn’t get into the program :DDDD

#Get ready to bop!!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): they’re playing hide and seek, confirmed


**bbfan132** (10): i like this a lot!!

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): It's a ten for those damn harmonies. I'm gagging

**fadedblue09** (10): I remember hearing a female cover of this first on The Closer (that Kyra Sedgwick series, if y'all still remember). Anyways, a classic that I don't mind a hearing a thousand times more

**jackisboredtoday** (10): mopped Fergie

**jman457** (10): an earworm

**qazz23** (10): The chorus is soooo good

**rickikardashian** (10): i havent been ready for absolutely anything in the last 5 years

**stryxen** (10): wait they’re raising the bar omg

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): it’s just a bop!!!

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**runaway3212** (9): And do what? Work Out? You're not tricking me that easily

**skargardin** (9): major bop!

**vayyiqra** (9): banger

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Yes, the “I’m gonna make you love me” genre of songs have aged very poorly, but I can’t help the pure joy and happy feelings I get whenever I hear that infectious chorus! Could do with less nursery rhyme references though

**waluigiest** (9): fergie’s influence

**orangetangerine** (8.5): When I think about a Temptations song I absolutely adore, it's this song.

**seanderlust** (8.2): the top I met on grindr telling me t...you know what, I can't do this to The Temptations. this is a great song, end of comment.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): if you stay ready, you ain’t got to get ready

**rslashpoopheads** (8): I'm ready 🍑

**thedoctordances1940** (8): really good but vocals could be a bit louder

**TragicKingdom1** (8): please play the pitbull & blake shelton cover/remix as the shitpost

**NotWith10000Men** (7.9): hey I know this chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (7): so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready! so get ready!

#sleeping

**IIIHenryIII** (5): Tolerable

**2dina3dworld** (3): this could’ve used some autotune.

**Roxieloxie** (10): fuck capitilism, all my homies hate capitlism, this fucks

**TiltControls** (6.5): It's been mentioned by other people on other songs, but for me this is a definite drop due to intense overplay from ads. Do I really need to listen to this song yet again for some random life insurance company or about medication for 60 year olds? No! The song is funky and fun but ads are all I'm reminded of when I hear this.

---

#absolute classic

**1998tweety** (10): classic

**anothertown** (10): the album art on spotify is so good

**bbfan132** (10): absolute classic - not my favorite song of his but still awesome

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): incredible

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I feel good. Nanananananana i knew that I would now. Nanananananana

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): I’m really curious what it would’ve been like to listen to a song like this with totally fresh ears, having never heard it before a thousand times on ads or in movies. Brown’s funkiness must’ve veritably blown people away.

**rslashpoopheads** (10): *inhales loudly* sweg.

**runaway3212** (10): Super exciting and fun

**thedoctordances1940** (10): SO GOOD

**CrimsonROSET** (9): if you don’t go ‘dununununununu’ with him there’s something wrong with you i’m sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why do I associate this with commercials mostly these days

**jman457** (8): The production on this is amazing, song is a bit repetitive though

**NotWith10000Men** (8): truly iconic

**waluigiest** (8): leedle leedle lee

**plastichaxan** (7.8): i hate white people using this on their movies

**2dina3dworld** (7): this feels empty without the “leedaleedalee” from the Patrick Star version

#Bitches be like 'abolish capitlism' but then tank rate songs because they are overplayed in commericals, what is the truth!!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): This is so overplayed, a bop though and you can’t go wrong with James Brown.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): That's a classic and objectively a good song, but in no way I would listen to this willingly. It's fun and all but just doesn't work for me. Maybe it's overplayed? I don't know

**seanderlust** (7): I can't tell if this is a 10 and i'm just in a bad mood or it's not...hm. might have to revisit this one. sorry james, if your song was called "I feel meh" maybe I would rate this higher

**skargardin** (7): The amount of clothing store commercials this was used in back then

**trashypanini** (7): A classic song. James sounds amazing on this and his iconic band kills with each dramatic stop and wail by James. Heard it a lot from commercials to movies n music samples but it’s got a lot of punch and that full band snazzyness/jazzyness that James loved.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s sounds nice yeah, but it’s also the definition of repetitive

**rickikardashian** (6.8): i dont want to take off points from this because of the tiktok sound irreparably staining how i listen to this song… but i have to

**apatel27** (6): Nothing against the song, just tired of hearing it everywhere

**celladonn** (6): This has appeared in far too many bad movies/commercials for me to take it seriously any more

**stryxen** (5.5): he’s doing too much but it kinda?? works

**Roxieloxie** (7): vocals are nice but boring [2]

---

#When I was 13 I had my first love

**AHSWeeknd** (11): an eleven.

**1998tweety** (10): big bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): I get so many conflicting emotions listening to this song, both positive and negative. This reminds me of both the best and worst times of my life, and how it helped me process those emotions.

**akanewasright** (10): Let’s go codependence! (Affectionate)

**anothertown** (10): Serving cloud and heaven a bit

**bespectacIed** (10): Nothing is more aptly named than the fucking supremes, like they knew what they were doing. Truly the supremes of the music industry. This is equal parts relaxing and erotic and excellent

**CrimsonROSET** (10): leave him!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the original Love on the Brain

**jackisboredtoday** (10): maybe my favorite Supremes song, so simple yet so gorgeous

**qazz23** (10): Classic, great melody

**waluigiest** (10): I really am gay…..

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.7): I have a feeling that The Supremes are going to do really well in this rate. For all the criticisms of Diana Ross, how she wasn’t as good a singer as Florence Ballard - she was still a really great, subtle performer who was truly a vocal actress who emoted the music instead of simply bowing people away vocally.

**bbfan132** (9): v good

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I can shake my ass to this, but like, sadly because this is about a bad relationship

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Pop perfection

**RandomHypnotica** (9): ok i'm pretty sure a cover of this song is used for a diaper commercial here and so that's all i can associate it with

**celladonn** (8.5): I mostly associate this song with these ads for nappies that used to use it but paying attention to the lyrics it was kind of a weird pick for those ads

**runaway3212** (8.5): a bit childish pun not intended

**jaztinax** (8): pretty sure i only know this because of those heart pillows you could press and it would play this song

**rslashpoopheads** (8): honestly all the Supremes songs kinda sound the same but in a good way

**thedoctordances1940** (8): it's cute it kinda feels like it should be amazing but something is missing to really make me properly love it

**whizzer0** (8): One of a few that I felt like I'd heard before with different words, or maybe I just didn't know the words—doesn't ABBA's *Waterloo* sound like this?

**orangetangerine** (7.8): Diana Ross's "Oooh" at the beginning just melts my heart. This is such a sweet song.

**jman457** (7.6): Thinking how Lily Tomlin and Diana Ross were practically neighbors growing up

#Needs starbucks

**p-u-n-k\_girl** (7): Loses a point for being too similar to Where Did Our Love Go

**stryxen** (6): it’s cute tbh but not enough happens

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This sounds like a more boring version of Build Me Up Buttercup… though I guess this song does predate Buttercup by a few years...

**twinfiresigns14** (5.5): I liked this song more if not for the singer's voice.

**TiltControls** (10): Speaking of Where Did Our Love Go... Little sad to see this leave just before day 3 since it's maybe my 2nd favourite Supremes song, but going out back-to-back with Baby Love is pretty humourous at least. Also as mentioned before this is the other song in this rate we've rated before (in Songs of the Summer rate). Again lower placing here than that rate, but got a higher score to compensate

#break up BOP

**1998tweety** (10): now this is a classic

**2dina3dworld** (10): why is this goshdarn break up song such a shot of serotonin

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It went to get the groceries

**anothertown** (10): This hook is like being dragged into a riptide. The best Supremes song here!

**bbfan132** (10): classic!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): gods of pop music

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This is actually amazing

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why are all of the supreme’s hits so depressing lyrically but so fun sonically

**qazz23** (10): Classic, great sax solo, essentially all chorus

**runaway3212** (10): I just love how the supremes sound on every song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): it’s wild how my first exposure to this was when The Pussycat Dolls covered it in conjunction with Tainted Love

**skargardin** (10): PLEASE let this fare better than in the sots rate

**vayyiqra** (10): I have a cringe memory of one time when I was with some friends and this came on and I was kind of shook and asked if they had ever heard the extended version of "Tainted Love" by Soft Cell, which interpolates this song. I had no idea it was a famous song in its own right and they had no clue what I was talking about.  It was very embarrassing! Anyway good song though.

**JustinJSrisuk** (9.8): Slaps.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.6): The beat is so addictive. The melody is such an earworm. Also love the Soft Cell cover of this.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): always live for yourselves! Fuck men! Fuck other people in general!

**rickikardashian** (9): now when little mix mashed this up with justin bieber’s baby… THAT was a moment in history

**rslashpoopheads** (9): iconic but also rated

**jman457** (8.3): Tainted Love

**orangetangerine** (7.6): "Sometimes I feel I've got to *boom boom* run away"; this song is inexplicably tied to "Tainted Love" in my head forever and ever.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this shit fucks!

**TiltControls** (8.4): A classic! Definitely prefer a lot of others on the list, but there's no doubt that this is an amazing song in its own right too. The chorus is another level of iconicness. Came close to day 3, but I think this is a good spot for it. Starting with this song almost all of these songs left were predicted to win or place top 10 so expect some rough cuts coming up.

---

#Yeah I watch curch for the plot

**joeeswift** (11): whenever I hear this song it plays on loop in my head for like a week straight

**2dina3dworld** (10): since I gave it a ten, I feel like I should have something to say, but all I can really say is that this bangs.

**bbfan132** (10): yes.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): stream "Windmills of Your Mind" by Dusty Springfield

**frogaranaman** (10): hate to say it but Dusty kinda snapped!!

**ManofOranges** (10): Probably the horniest song in this rate

**qazz23** (10): It's a classic, love the final chorus (11 candidate)

**rslashpoopheads** (10): attention all sons of preachers: I am very much available

**runaway3212** (10): I always felt like I missed out not going to bible camp

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Sunday service and chill

**seanderlust** (10): this is gorgeous and one of my favorite songs from this era. I do want to shoutout aretha's cover of this which goes off

**skargardin** (10): I hate that I associate this with Mafia III skull

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I still cannot fucking believe this lady is British… probably the craziest thing I’ve learned from this rate

**jman457** (9.9): Watch a white british lady win this rate, cant say its not deserved though

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I hope Dusty fired whoever chose that outfit for her

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I’ve definitely heard this before! It’s one of my favorites. Let me add it to my playlist immediately

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): Queen of blue-eyed soul.

**Sunny\_Waterloo** (9): lesbian queen

**waluigiest** (9): god I love this song. it’s always been gay to me

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): shoutouts to all my catholic school bitches who had crushes on straight guys

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): I thought this was an Aretha original for most of my life

**bespectacIed** (8): love the horns, horns make everything good

**jaztinax** (8): this feels both extremely outdated and classic at the same time

**stryxen** (8): i love this but it’s just too short the ending is unsatisfying

**TragicKingdom1** (8): i remember this having more energy but her vocals serve

**vayyiqra** (8): As a kid I hated this song because there was a cover of this song that was on the radio a lot and it was sped up and made into a noisy rock song and whoever sang it practically screeched the words, like a much less talented Janis Joplin. Thankfully this is not the same version as whoever. I like this one.

**plastichaxan** (7.8): i wish i liked this more but it’s fun

#You know what i can respect the desire for a DILF

**dance\_apoptosistic** (7): I want to say my rating has nothing to do with the Office ruining this for me with all the cringe, but tbh I never really could get behind this song. Maybe because I always wanted the preacher himself and not his egotistical ass son.

#Not organized religion stans

**NotWith10000Men** (6.8): this would make a great country song

**orangetangerine** (6.8): Pretty good track, although I like Dusty Springfield's other work better (her more poppy stuff, the track on the list right after this one). Interesting note: she's one of two white artists, the only solo one, to make this Soul Rate.

**trashypanini** (5.5): The production on this is killer. Gives an American Pie typical 70s folky-acoustic rock vibe. Still a larp of the gritty soul voice though.

**Roxieloxie** (10): How did this not make day 3 wtf,,,,

**TiltControls** (9.2): Another surprising late day 2 exit. This song just has smoothness plastered all over it. Marvin is stellar as always, though I also have to give a shout out to the background singers for the post-chorus 'Heard it through the grapevine how much longer would you be mine baby?'. Also in terms of covers there are plenty of versions of this song that got big enough in the 60's, but Marvin's is a special kind of amazing. (Also since this is Marvin's last solo song - vote for the 70s soul albums rate if it gets submitted again PLEASE)

---

#This is for my people who just lost their 11

**jaztinax** (11): i have no idea how this is going to perform in the rate, but i have to give it my 11 anyway in an attempt to give it a high average. can’t really explain why i love it so much, but it has to be something about the vocal delivery and storytelling more than anything. marvin gaye definitely has one of my favorite soul voices of this era.

**runaway3212** (11): okay after very little deliberating this became my 11. It's the perfect song to me. On the one hand you have marvin gaye's incredible voice and he truly brings it all. The instrumentation is of course top notch, the extra instrumental when he sings grapevine to really emphasize that part. However what really makes this rise above the rest of the songs here is the lyrics. The song is this wonderfull combination of  hurt from that he was cheated on but also that his lover didn't tell him that she was in love with somebody else and it really sells that premise super well.

#I dont have a cleaver title but i cant just let this get lost

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Teatime & Trending Topics - July 2, 1968

#Wine moms

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Marvin Gaye always nailed vocal delivery

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the let’s marvin gaye and get it on of it all

**jsonphile** (10): Marvin Gaye is a god

**ManofOranges** (10): Yet another classic

**trashypanini** (10): A classic cover that I’ve heard plenty of times. Marvins voice is in full richness and the emotion is oozing. With each rise in his voice you really believe the confusion in him. Such a relatable track about feeding into suspicions and jealousy.

**vayyiqra** (10): There's a cover of this song by Creedence Clearwater Revival that's a banger which I know better. The original is just as good though.

**jman457** (9.5): feels sexy, almost like a bond song

**bbfan132** (9): the instrumental is really good and marvin’s vocals are just a++++

**ignitethephoenix** (9): classic

**plastichaxan** (9): there’s a reason this is one of the first songs people think of from him, it’s too good

**waluigiest** (9): I’m obsessed with the drama

**twinfiresigns14** (8.5): Even Sultana Bran ads can't ruin this song for me.

**orangetangerine** (8.4): There's a reason this is the version of the song people remember - Gladys Knight recorded this too, and so did the Temptations, and neither version comes even remotely close to this one. The only version that is superior to this one is the one done by the California Raisins (IYKYK).

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I feel like those Raisin commercials ruined this song for me :( howeverrr hearing it again is swaying me...if not for those commercials a smooth ten

**rickikardashian** (8): great song, even though it's pretty obvious that he was just trying to get a viral hit on Vine

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is the closest thing to a revenge fantasy song we have in this rate and I am enjoying it!

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the high notes in this are so good

**bigbigbee** (7): Marvin Gaye was ALL OVER the original run of American Idol and I feel old thinking that that was like 15-20 years ago at this point….like, the contestants who were in their late teens and 20s at that point probably had a similar relationship to these 60s songs that I have to 80s songs like Take on Me and Heaven Is A Place On Earth.

**1998tweety** (6.5): alright

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): it's time for some grapewine

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Iconic title, okay song

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): It’s tolerable and kinda groovy

**stryxen** (5): kinda overrated but i still think it’s alright

**Roxieloxie** (10): I miss the good ole days where this was top 5 

**TiltControls** (8.1): And there goes the last of the Temptations songs. I like the song, but maybe not as much compared to the rest of the group (though I can admit it's such an easy song to sing along to, that chorus is another level of catchy). Honestly really surprised to see it miss day 3 (especially since it was solidly top 5 for the early parts of the rate), but with the strength of the songs left someone had to go.

---

#What are yall's birth times

**cremeebrulee** (11): i definitely only love this song for the song itself and not because my brain associates this with my middle school crush who played this on guitar during a talent show once

**akanewasright** (10): This song is a delight and we RIOT when it goes out day 1

**anothertown** (10): Lesbian things

**bbfan132** (10): mellow classic

**jaztinax** (10): i will fight people if this isn’t top 10

**jsonphile** (10): if someone ever sung this to me I’d marry them. And I’m a straight guy

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Iconic.

**ManofOranges** (10): Classic, we all know it

**rickikardashian** (10): ill always be grateful for this song existing, because as a mediocre male singer, i was able to sound nice singing this song. it was my secret weapon

**skargardin** (10): I find it amusing that there are songs titled both "My Girl" and "My Guy" in this rate.

**waluigiest** (10): the trumpets after the line about the bees…… :)

**runaway3212** (9.5): my guy outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (9): my WOMAN** smh

**seanderlust** (9): such a classic.

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): when you’ve used this song as a plot device in your smut…

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.3): maybe overexposure lessened this song's appeal for me :(

**jman457** (8.2): Cute but the Rolling Stones version outsold

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**plastichaxan** (8): i think what’s holding back with their songs for me is that they’re… too sweet, literally, too much talk about being sweet

**stryxen** (8): ended my guy actually

**welcome2thejam** (8): Probably the other big victim of overplay overuse in this rate. Still catchy as all hell though

**orangetangerine** (7.6): This song has never failed to put a smile on my face.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): overPLAYED

**NotWith10000Men** (7): fuck damn it the most exposure I've had to this song is in the big fucking bang theory I'm so sorry for this song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I don’t know why but that bassline sounds so gross… other than that it’s a sweet-sounding classic

**Roxieloxie** (10): its just so fun to sing

**TiltControls** (9.1): And so ends day 2! This is a song I really do like, but compared to everything else left I think it's the right one to cut. That opening 'Stop!' has got to be one of the most iconic things in the world though

---

#Stop!

**2dina3dworld** (10): if you gave this a negative score, then stop! in the name of good taste.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): what if I wanna start in the name of love? 😭

**bbfan132** (10): another classic, not much else to say when the quality is this high :noitstrue:

**bespectacIed** (10): diana really has one of the most iconic voices of all time, so singularly hers. I can't comment much on the song bc it's excellence

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me when i stop in the middle of traffic and get run over

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I love the DRAMA of this song omg. The lyrics are so sad! Diana this man is triflin, you don't need him!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The prototypical girl group song, like, this basically invented girl group synchronized hand choreography

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): You know a song is iconic when you can automatically picture and/or perform it’s choreography upon hearing the very first notes. No one can hear that first “Stop!” and not instinctually raise their hand in front of them.

**ManofOranges** (10): YUP YUP YUP

**runaway3212** (10): This song is just such spillage

**skargardin** (10): I just absolutely love this

**whizzer0** (10): So this is the original... I've heard the Glee mashup a lot before. Cool song.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): writing an essay on the impact of this song & the group’s performances of it for a class awhile back meant I watched a LOT of performance footage of this song but I didn’t even mind bc its that good

**stryxen** (9.5): i just zoned out and my fingers gave this song a 9.5 without consulting my brain at all they spilled

**1998tweety** (9): cute

**ignitethephoenix** (9): maybe this is the berestein effect but this sounds different from what I remember

**plastichaxan** (9): glee is so sick for what it did to this song

**thedoctordances1940** (9): was stop in the name of ketchup just a dumb thing i did as a kid or did others do that as well

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the song peaks at the opening but its still good

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I probably don’t like this as much as other popheads do, but I still think it’s a great song!

**jman457** (7.3): stop his cheating ass!!

**rslashpoopheads** (7): iconic but also overrated

#Rate trauma corner ,,,, 2!

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.8): i used to like this song a lot when growing up but someone tainted it for me :///

**bigbigbee** (6.5): This is deeply tainted for me by a performance I saw at a talent show in like 4th grade…I don’t know if it was bad but I just feel awkward when I listen to this. I wish I could delete that association badly cause this song is nice!

**fadedblue09** (5.5): A lil boring unfortunately

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): Stop! In the name of good music

**waluigiest** (5): this song played all the time in the restaurant I worked at in high school so it just reminds me of cleaning tables
