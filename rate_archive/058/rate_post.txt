Depressed And/Or Gay? The Moody 2017 Pop Rock Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/a2ait5/depressed_andor_gay_the_moody_2017_pop_rock_rate/

Welcome to the Moody 2017 Pop Rock Rate, or the Depressed And/Or Gay Rate, or the "I'm Depressed And Maybe Heartbroken" Rate! We are your hosts, /u/piccprincess and /u/carliescion, and of course the always-depressed but sassy [Tubbs](https://imgur.com/a/O4msdBk).

These three albums represent different viewpoints of growing up, depression, heartbreak, and other struggles - which we think perfectly encapsulate the experience of every single pophead. Each band here represents a different aesthetic viewpoint and roots themselves in different subgenres of rock: Bleachers as indie rock, Paramore as pop rock, and PVRIS as alternative/synth rock.

Will Lorde rig her way to the top, only to get slumber party'd yet AGAIN? Or will Paramore stans split their 11s so Lorde can ride Jack's dick to a win?

###[Gone Now - Bleachers](https://consequenceofsound.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/bleachers-gone-now.jpg)

Bleachers is the stage name of Jack Antonoff - y'know, that guy who produces popheads' favorite pop girls ([Lana Del Rey](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Dj8MG6OU0AAKknH.jpg), [Lorde](https://www.billboard.com/files/styles/article_main_image/public/media/lorde-jack-antonoff-2017-billboard-1548.jpg), [Taylor Swift](https://peopledotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/taylor-swift-jack-antonoff.jpg), [etc](https://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop/7776275/songs-written-by-jack-antonoff)). Previously finding massive success in fun., he founded Bleachers in 2014. Gone Now is this second studio album under the Bleachers moniker.

This self-produced and self-written album features vocals from both Lorde and Carly Rae Jepsen and writing credits from Julia Michaels. It has themes of depression, loss and anxiety. It especially centers around the death of his little sister, when Jack was 15.

###[After Laughter - Paramore](https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71XGHwGE0iL._SL1400_.jpg)

After Laughter is Paramore's 5th album and the follow up to their most successful album ever. Their 2013 self-titled album was their first ever record to peak at #1, while also spawning both a top 10 and a top 40 hit. 

While After Laughter didn't get the same commercial success, it's their most critically acclaimed album. Drawing on 80's synth pop and new wave, this album cemented Paramore's transition from a rock band to a pop band. The album tackles themes of depression and anxiety while maintaining an upbeat sound throughout most of the record.

###[All We Know Of Heaven, All We Need Of Hell -  PVRIS](http://i1.wp.com/musicandriots.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pvris_allweknow_full.jpg)

Ah, a band that originally stole it's name from The Chainsmokers. PVRIS dropped their second studio album on August 25th, 2017, after being delayed from the original release date of August 4th. The album's main themes deal with depression and dealing with the instability of relationships.

AWKOHAWNOH released to a handful of critical acclaim, earning an 86 on metacritic and landing at #31, just behind LCD Soundsystem. The entire record is written and produced by lead singer Lynn Gunn and producer Blake Harnage, and was recorded in a haunted church.

###Rules

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine so long as it is to only 1 decimal place. Ex) 7.2 and 4.9 are good, 3.33 and 7.75 are not.
* Yes that says EACH SONG, ballots without all songs given a score won't be counted.
* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.
* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks. **You must write a comment for these explaining why they are the worst and best songs of the rate.**
* The bonus rate is *optional* and there will be no 11s or 0s, so nothing gets confusing!
* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM either host again afterwards.
* For rates we use a program that makes life easier for both the hosts and the users. There is a very certain way that your ballot has to be laid out, and luckily, as your hosts, we have done it for you.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Same if you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!

This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:

>Let's Get Married: 10 King of political messages, Taylor Swift who?

These are INCORRECT, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:

>Let's Get Married: 1: King of political messages, Taylor Swift who?

>Let's Get Married: King of political messages, Taylor Swift who? 10

> Let's Get Married: Taylor Swift would give this a 10 and post it on her instagram

> Let's Get Married: 10-King of political messages, Taylor Swift who?

>Let's Get Married: 10 (King of political messages, Taylor Swift who?)

* Please do not rig. Rate hosts reserve the right to reject scores.
