I’m not a big fan of CHVRCH’s lead vocalists voice and I keep reading their band name as chèvre, sorry.

---
**tapdancingpig** (10): [sigh] I really need to get into CHVRVHES, don’t I?

**IeuanHa** (9): This is a song that I think really benefits from Hayley, I think it adds alot compared to the original

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): the production in this track literally degrades Hayley’s vocals to the point she almost exactlysounds like Lauren. There’s a stark contrast between this studio version and in the multiple live performances of this son on YouTube

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (8): a cute lil bop

**Leixander** (7.5): even though i like this song, the production and the vocals don't sound good together. I would love to hear this with a softer production.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): A solid duet, but Hayley and Lauren's voices are a little bit too similar to stand out

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I don’t like it as much as the original but it’s a bop

**InternetDude19** (6): I was never a big fan of the original track, but I actually think Hayley's verse is detrimental to the track as she sounds too similar to Lauren. She doesn't add anything.

**vhqv1997** (5): I don't care that the chorus is repeated consistently to signify desperation, there are more interesting ways to get that across without making this song sound like a bland, semi-inspirational mom-pop song

**frogaranaman** (3): The almost-screaming lyrics are just.. not good.

**lilguavachan** (2): i just don't like chvrches either

**Carlie:** We begin our Day 2 with a true robbery! This is actually my favorite PVRIS song. It's very different from the rest of the album, much lighter and airier. I especially enjoy the contrast between the hardness of the chorus and the soft verses.

**Picc:** Okay this is arguably the worst song on the album. Lynn reaches peak mumble rapper in her depression filled, poorly enunciated state and it makes some of the song hard to listen to. It took me a while to realize what she was even saying in the first verse. Why didn't this go out first for Pvris?

---
**tapdancingpig** (10): I don’t think I like this album, but I find it utterly fascinating. This album is essentially a metal band twisting itself to make it pop, and this song is probably the best example of that, since it’s coating layer of pop is a little thinner than in most of the album.

**vhqv1997** (10): Oh God I've always been in love with this idea of soulmates reincarnating and always ending up with each other and thank God there's a song about that, nevermind the fact that it is a incredible song

**1998tweety** (9.5): Basically the same as my comment for Walk Alone; PVRIS are doing a great job of making diverse songs inside of the same genre and style. This bops too.

**skomehillet** (9): I really like the guitar and the drums here. The second catchiest song on this album aside from "What's Wrong"

**twat\_brained** (8.2): I found myself rocking back and forth to the beat but I wasn't totally drawn into the lyrics. Still loving the album, though!

**hikkaru** (8): Gotye and Kimbra are shaking

**IeuanHa** (8): I like the vibe on this one, it kinda stands out a bit from the others

**ReallyCreative** (7.9): A different sound than the rest of the album, at least to a degree, and a welcome shift. It's a little brighter until the chorus really opens up. Not a huge fan of the chorus unfortunately though.

**ChaseLights** (7.4): I like how this kind of strips back the energy of the album a bit...nevertheless, it's my least fave on the album.

**InfernalSolstice** (7): kinda meh compared to everything else

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A mellower track but a solid one

**frogaranaman** (6): I wish I could be sent into the post-horny stratosphere so I don’t have to deal with sex.

**kappyko** (5): This should be great but misses something.

**TragicKingdom1** (4.5): i wish we were rating Somebody That I Used To Know again instead of this

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): The verses are word mush, the chorus/pre-chorus is word mush with occasional lumps, and the "Just somebody that you used to love" rips me right out of the song with it's Gotye-ness

**dramiaa** (0): After a couple tracks, the kinda screamed/growled chorus with a calmer verse really gets old. It doesnt help that Pvris borrowed the chorus right out of Gotye’s basement

**Carlie:** Grudges was my second most played song of 2017 - and it would be a 10 if I didn't overplay it so. damn. much. The drums are shimmery, the synths are wonderful, the lyrics are good. It just isn't top tier After Laughter (anymore)

**Picc:** I hold grudges, therefor Grudges must be a bad track

---
**IeuanHa** (11): one of my favourite paramore songs of all time, all 3 band members come together excellently. Zacs drumming really shines here in particular

**strawberryswing1** (10): This was the opener at tour, and whenever I hear it I get flashbacks to the excitement of Paramore coming on and Hayley's amazing energy dancing around the stage.

**ReallyCreative** (9): The way this song starts is so great, and I love the pre-choruses and verses. The chorus feels like it's a little off, though I can't pinpoint exactly what it is. It's minor though, this song is great.

**awryj** (8.8): this is going to get robbed

**extrasmallbillie** (8.6): : I'm still so f*cking happy that Zac is back. Like Paramore isn't Paramore at least without one Farro brother and I'm glad it was Zac who decided to come back.

**InfernalSolstice** (8.5): a bop but not as bop-y as the other bops here

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Interesting how we have this song, which is a bit of a contrast to "Forgiveness"; she's not ready to forgive but she doesn't want to hold a grudge. I can somewhat appreciate that but I'm not totally sold on the idea.

**1998tweety** (8.3): A cute fun bop

**kappyko** (8): eh bop

**Leixander** (8): Feels like a reprise of Forgiveness. This album would do better with only one of them but I still like them both.

**ChaseLights** (7.5): This is a bit weirdly structured, but I mean, they've earned the right to do that and it still slaps.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Ju-on: The Grudge is a 2003 Japanese supernatural horror film written and directed by Takashi Shimizu. This film is the third installment in the Ju-on series and the first film to be theatrically released (the first two entries being direct-to-video productions). The film premiered at the Screamfest Film Festival in October 2002 and has spawned several sequels and an American remake titled The Grudge, which was released in 2004. The film was followed by Ju-on: The Grudge 2.

**frogaranaman** (6): Angela, if you would like to return me the $5 I loaned you in second grade, that would be greatly appreciated.

**GamblesWithDesire** (3): This song is just so…grating and meh with a scattered production and lyrics that just don't click with me

**Carlie:** This is one of my least favorite Paramore songs. Hayley's delivery is apathetic, the guitar riff grinds my gears and it just in general sounds unpleasant to me.

**Picc:** Maren and Jimmy Eat World outsold...sorry sisters

---
**skomehillet** (11): The catchiest fucking chorus on the whole album. The sing-songy bridge (“I don’t need no help, I can sabotage me by myself”) is so good and so relatable that I felt attacked when I heard it. Such a groovy track top to bottom. This 11 is probably gonna flop but I'm fighting the good fight and that's all that matters.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is so cute anyone who gives this less than an 8 is a fattie

**rotating3Dtext** (10): you know how many times this made me cry? ... I mean, at least once. ‘I can sabotage me by myself’ oof

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): second best in the album and the "boppiest" by far

**IeuanHa** (9.5): my most played paramore song ever, and for good reason. I really love the "no, I don't need no help" and "all the lonely days are gone" bit!

**skargardin** (9.5): big mood

**InfernalSolstice** (9): catchy

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song would be a 7 or 8 if it weren't for the bridge and how the song concludes, I really love it so much and it saves some otherwise mediocre verses and a fun but forgettable chorus.

**twat\_brained** (8.9): Charli found in oblivion along with Nasty Cherry. The album's starting to pick up again, I'm on board with this! I'm not sure what "Middle" Hayley's referring to but then again it's almost 1 AM and I've had my 2nd glass of wine while playing Fallout 4 so I may be a bit disoriented.

**ChaseLights** (8.5): This is underrated by a lot of people who listen to this album, I think because this is where the album gets a bit samey but not bad, and it's right before the album takes a turn but this deserves more attention.

**Leixander** (8.5): Serving relatable lyrics.

**frogaranaman** (8): listens to to the opening line Ugh, mood.

**kappyko** (8): faux reggay bop

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is the most underrated bop on the album tbh

**1998tweety** (7.6): A little boring but not awful.

**tapdancingpig** (7.6): Cute bop.

**LandonKidatrea** (6): "I don't need no help, I can sabotage me by myself" same

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (3): The amount of hate I have for this song is sort of amazing. It's just so darn boring. It may be my least favorite song in the Paramore catalog, which is funny because it includes one of their best lyrics.

**GamblesWithDesire** (1): If No Friend wasn't on this album as a full track, this would be getting my 0 because this song is obnoxious and has been since the first listen. The only thing I "like" is the bridge with "I don't need no help, I can sabotage me by myself" because it's relatable, but I hate the delivery of it so womp womp

**Carlie:** I feel like so many pop punk bands have covered this track, and none of them have really managed to live up to the Sia's own version. It's really hard to match the emotions you can feel in Sia's vocals, but I feel like PVRIS made a decent attempt.

---
**agentofscranton** (10): give chandelier your 10s and 11s for the alternative pop queens rate

**IeuanHa** (9.5): Lynn's voice worked surprisingly well here, and made a really solid cover

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): It sounds a lot like the original. The original’s great, though

**IndigoAri** (9): Though there isn't much difference between the original and the cover, Pvris really outdid themselves with this one.

**Mysario** (9): there's a Paramore song on this Punk Goes Pop which is still weird to me. anyways, while this cover is decent, the only cover worth listening to on this comp is this song (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odNCtE-I8o4) because they did better than the original artist in every possible way

**tapdancingpig** (8): This cover doesn’t reinvent the song or anything, but the lead singer does a pretty great job with a REALLY difficult and iconic song.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is kinda eerily similar to the original in a way that I’m not sure if I can comprehend

**ChaseLights** (7.5): An adequate cover.

**rosecoloreds** (7.5): she has the range

**frogaranaman** (7): This is sounds good but that’s partially because it sounds almost exactly the original, haha.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): Punk Goes compilations are…iffy at best in terms of cover quality, especially in recent years, but this is a very solid cover that again manages to perfectly blend in Pvris' sound

**vhqv1997** (6): If you're gonna cover a song as famous as this, you either have to do something different with it, or surpass the original, and even though this is a valiant attempt, it's just not as good

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5): This is pretty much a carbon copy of the original with worse vocals :/

**Carlie:** No Mercy has so much energy, especially in the chorus. I just kinda want to scream out the chorus. This track is more on the "rock" side of "pop rock", but I like that they included some songs closer to their roots.

**Picc:** This song is SUCH a banger and an amazing encore for their live show. Got any pent up anxiety or anger? Blast this in your bedroom and headbang. Try it!

**vhqv1997** (10): Holy shit what a fucking banger, this song deserves to be the soundtrack to a blockbuster zombie slasher movie starring an all-female cast with Tessa Thompson, Kristen Stewart, and Sandra Oh

**twat\_brained** (9.7): SHOW ME NO MEEEEERCYYYYYYYYYYYYY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Okay, when the hell are PVRIS going on tour next? I need to scream these lyrics back to Lynn

**TheGlassBetweenUs** (9.5): Okay This is great. Wasn't expecting this one.

**ReallyCreative** (9): A song that sounds like it belongs in the first half of the album rather than towards the end, but it's really good so who cares

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Shawn Mendes, Kanye West, and MØ are all shaking

**1998tweety** (8.8): This track feels more rock-heavy than the ones before, still bops.

**hikkaru** (8.5): this goes hard

**ChaseLights** (8): Probably the hardest song on the album. This slaps.

**IeuanHa** (8): a return to form after winter, it produces a feel of urgency to me

**frogaranaman** (7): Imagine popping your pussy to this chorus. What a mood.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): This is about as hardcore as Pvris gets on this album and despite not being a huge fan of hardcore music, I do enjoy this song

**awryj** (5): sounds like a song that was specifically composed to be remixed by some YouTube-famous DJ and included in every pro gamer video compilation ever

**kappyko** (5): Sorry, PVRIS. I'm already Tracer.

**skomehillet** (5): Kinda redundant but I could fuck up some furniture to this

**Carlie:** This song is pretty self-explanatory. It’s about the death of his sister and 9/11. This melody! The lyrics! The vocals! The variety! Whew! Now. This. Is. A. Fucking. Robbery. Everybody Lost Somebody is one of my favorite Bleachers tracks and was a STRONG contender for my 11. I was 100% sure this song would end up in the top 10. This song sums up Gone Now perfectly - the themes of loss, the experimental production, the boppiness. It's a perfect song IMO but apparently y'all have NO TASTE.

**Picc:** I caNNOT believe this song is going out so early??? It's so relatable wtf

---
**TulilpWaffles** (11): I really appreciate how this takes something so heartbreaking - loss - and makes into something so catchy and upbeat.

**skomehillet** (10): The brass? Sick. The beat? Sick. The lyrics? Sad. The song? Slaps. Instrumentally, it reminds me a lot of Kanye’s Good Morning. The descending cadence in the horns really adds to the mournful nostalgia I get from it. I’m in love with it. This shit bangs.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): comeonemotherfuckeryousurvivedyougottagiveyourselfabreak! heeeeeeeeeey

**vhqv1997** (10): That saxophone though

**ExtraEater** (8.5): good title

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): The horns in this song are great and such a mood

**hikkaru** (8): :saxophone:

**InfernalSolstice** (8): the prechorus and chorus are fantastic but its brought down by the weird talkiness in the verses and an overlong and strange bridge

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This should’ve been the name of the album!!!

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): I never really know how I feel about this song, there are times when I love it, times where I don't, times where I think it sucks, it's complicated. I like the emotion conveyed in it, and love some of the choices made (the saxophone is a nice touch, I always love when Jack uses his lower register) but I really hate the bridge and honestly just wish the last part of the song was different in some other way.

**1998tweety** (7.3): I like the use of unconventional instruments....but then he did that weird singing screaming thing again so I had to take some points off.

**ChaseLights** (6.7): This was a pretty solid bop...till he TRIED it with that falsetto. Electric chair!

**Mysario** (6.5): I think this would be better if it was sung by anyone else but idk it just doesn't click

**tapdancingpig** (6.5): I’m sorry, but... this hook is just too cheesy-profound for me. Also, Jack’s falsetto is very nails on a chalkboard. I like some of the writing in the verses though.

**frogaranaman** (6): The beginning almost sounds like a parody of a typical Bleachers song, but it changes into something different. So, that’s a weird juxtaposition.

**twat\_brained** (5.2): hang on what the hell is that falsetto? Also where's the energy for this song? I was on such a high after DTTM and now it feels like I'm on a comedown. The comedown should be at the end of the album. I'm disappointed.

**IeuanHa** (5): was going to get a higher rating until about two minutes twenty in, where it goes downhill real quick imo

**kappyko** (5): Antonoff finds a saxophonist and aims for sophisti-pop but mostly sounds like ska. The 808s bring to mind a cursed franken-genre: crunk ska? His sentiment is right here, and I don't feel right calling it disingenuous. I'd be lying if I said the pairing of his kitsch musical ambition with his emotional lyrics didn't feel a bit weird here, though.

**awryj** (3): i gotta get to the end of this song. i gotta get to the end of this song. i gotta get to the end of this song. i gotta get to the end of this song. i gotta get to the end of this song. i gotta get to the end of this song.

**Carlie:** A deeply nostalgic song, Jack said this song was «about how in the seemingly lowest points of you’re life, it’s kinda the best. You know, you’ve got no money, you’re driving in an old van, no one’s coming to the shows, no direction, no one gives a shit, but those were kinda the days». Tbh, can’t really relate.

I Miss Those Days has a fantastic guitar riff. The song is walking the thin line between Jack's "normal" production and his more experimental stuff. It's a very positive track on a rather depressing album. I like this song, but it's NOT as good as Everybody Lost Somebody, which is the song it's tied with. 

**Picc:** Imagine hating Jack so much that he gets a double whammy tie today

---
**ExtraEater** (10): in which jack antonoff finally nails the atmosphere he's going for

**InfernalSolstice** (10): whew daddy jack served us a massive bop once again

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i’ve never paid for my own bills, i never learned how to drive, never had direction in my life, but it feels a lot like I miss my childhood innocence. i can’t exactly pinpoint when i lost control of everything; when my life became fragmented, too much for me to handle. but yeah, i do miss the days of being a carefree kid.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This song is so cheerful, I have to bop!

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song sounds weirdly Christmas-ey to me, even though it's about remembering stuff like 9/11 and a sister's death.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Another slam dunk of a song on this album, the chorus is gold, everything is gold, this is glorious.

**1998tweety** (8.6): This is cute. The drums into the chorus are crazy too, I love them.

**skomehillet** (8.5): LA LA LA LA LA LA LOST is contagious. This is one of those songs that are just made to sing along to.

**IeuanHa** (8): On the whole I find this to be one of the albums highlights, love the instrumental at the two mins mark

**kappyko** (8): I'm charmed enough by the instrumental break and thumping percussion to enjoy this. When I wrote the previous track blurbs, I didn't realize Nico Segal was actually playing on the album, but his horns contribute a lot to Antonoff's palette. The first chorus, despite the grating "la"s, becomes a really pretty pastiche of Madness's "Our House" or Huey Lewis (cue "Getting Bi" from Crazy Ex-Girlfriend). The nostalgia isn't here quite like Antonoff wants.

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): Love the verses, meh on the pre-chorus/chorus, fun instrumentation but this song really doesn't stand out to me at being anything more than "mostly pleasant," which is how I view a lot of this album.

**twat\_brained** (7.7): I miss fun. too, Jack.

**ChaseLights** (7.2): Okay, I kinda like the vibe here. Not a great song however.

**hikkaru** (7): the instrumental part is nice

**tapdancingpig** (7): I like most of this song, except for that fucking hook. It just feels like a la-la-la-la-la-la-lazy way to get a hook in the brain.

**frogaranaman** (6): This is white hip hop.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): This song is fine but it's already arrived like 3 times on this album

**Carlie:** The Bleachers slaughter continues! Jack is now down to just 2 songs - but will he even survive this day? Let's Get Married is a euphoric track, written after Trump got elected. So no @ y'all: it's not about Lena Dunham. 

**Picc:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xHL2Cc5s83k

---

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): after the harsh and painful lyrics of “All My Heroes”, “Let’s Get Married” never fails to put a smile on my face. even if it’s someone else’s monologue and not mine, I can’t help but feel a smile creep on my face hearing the lines “I’m gonna get right for you honey I'll take all of my medicine, spend you all my money”. yes, i am aware that it’s not quite the love song it is. it follows the euphoric theme, frantic feelings, and it’s ultimately a song about loneliness and the painful honesty about how you feel about a loved one.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Not as good as the BROCKHAMPTON song but I just love this track. The chorus is just so sunny and despite the song being about the 2016 election, it’s undeniably optimistic.

**InternetDude19** (9): It's so much fun!

**1998tweety** (8.7): Lmao right when this song started I thought it sampled "Mickey". It's cute.

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): This is another song I go back and forth on, I generally enjoy it though. It's pretty classic Bleachers sound. Great bridge. It's a bit of a filler song in some ways, but it sounds great and it's catchy.

**IeuanHa** (8.5): I really enjoy this song on the whole, just a fun bop!

**tapdancingpig** (8): This song is positively euphoric, but the samples/pitched up vocals are a little off putting.

**skargardin** (7.5): bop

**frogaranaman** (7): Love crippling loneliness bops!

**skomehillet** (6.5): King of channeling post-election trauma into a seemingly happy tune about getting married

**awryj** (5): no thanks

**kappyko** (4): His positivity has kind of worn off on me. Post-election distress has inspired a slew of songs and albums in order to meet the demands that a Trump election would imply for the music scene's dominant ethos. It's no surprise that the best music from this era has been angry or devastated, because nothing was quite like that day when it felt like our lives were condemned to deep shit for four years. A song like this, aiming for love in a time where "bad people" are outside of his point of view, has some weird implications and feels generally misguided and somewhat condescending. It's hard to embrace optimism as a point of view in modern political music, and a song like this with boy band verses and alt radio fodder "oh-oh-oh"s fails in feeling romantic or smart. The final wash of vocals quickly getting cut short as the drum machine thumps seems kind of indicative of the '80s being transformed into a weird aesthetic sheen for songwriting that often misses more than it hits.

**over9000skeletons** (2): hurts to listen to

###It's not a love song about Lena!!!!!!!

**InfernalSolstice** (10): this will be underrated because it's about lena but idc it's a massive bop

**vhqv1997** (10): Not as good as Bruno Mars's "Marry You", but it is queer, so

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): I had to lower one point bc it made me think of L*na Dunham. Yikes.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Ah, yes. I love this band, their hit single Hat Punk, and their album, I'm an Aries. I'm sorry, that was lousy. What's not lousy, however, is how punky this tune is, and how it reminds me of The 1975 in many ways. I really hope to God he never sang this to Lena, though. That'd be fucking embarrassing.

**Mysario** (8): it's a beautiful night, looking for something dumb to do

**ChaseLights** (7.2): This is a cute sentiment. Can't believe he used to date that trash Lena Fraud-ham

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): This song was a 5 but then Jack and Lena broke up and now it's a 7 which is the true glow up

**\_wailordfan** (6): NOOOO I don't like intentional 'marry me' songs.

**Carlie:** Another one of my least favorite After Laughter tracks. Paramore have done better ballads - even on this album. It's a very average track to me. The piano melody doesn't work as well as I want it to and the lyrics don't resonate with me at all.

**Picc:**Idk why but this song just kinda did nothing for me I am SORRY

---
**lilguavachan** (11): when you have the combination of being a ballad ho and hayley's beautiful voice.... gurl i hear sumn and it's wonderful

**ChaseLights** (10): A painfully good ballad.

**extrasmallbillie** (10): : second fav song on AL after 26.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): They did pull it back together on the closer at least, with this gorgeous and haunting song complete with "stare out the window on a rainy night in an oversized sweatshirt" vibes

**IndigoAri** (10): Another emotionally tugging song. Between the melodic beat and Hayley's voice, especially the last bit she sings in a more whispered tone had me overwhelmed. Probably one of my most favorite tracks of the album.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): beautiful song that will go out day 2 at best at which point i'll have a meltdown because it's amazing and fuck you all you have no taste i hope you die

**Leixander** (10): I can't call you a stranger,,,, but i can't call you,,,,

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): fuck if Bleachers didn’t exist, this is easily my 11. it’s got everything i usually give an 11, sad vibes, deals with loneliness, makes me wonder if there’s still something to be optimistic about

**vhqv1997** (9): I see Paramore has attended The St. Vincent School of Ending An Album With A Song About Suicide

**twat\_brained** (8.8): It's a downbeat closer but it's one which feels like it encapsulates the record well, tying everything together back nicely. I don't know how to feel about Paramore, other than I really liked this album, and I'l give Brand New Eyes a listen.

**Mysario** (8.5): a good closer for the most part but it also just kind of... ends

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): If you're not going to end the album with No Friend, I suppose Tell Me How isn't a horrible alternative. It doesn't do much outside the context of the album for me though, I like the other ballads better, but it's still pretty good all things considered.

**IeuanHa** (8): for a long time I wasn't bothered by this song all that much, but with time I've come to really appreciate the emotion in it, the opening lyric I just love

**InternetDude19** (8): This song gets me emotional.

**1998tweety** (7.8): A good closer to the album.

**kappyko** (7): i forgot what this sounded like. slow bop?

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (7): Nice closer

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is a cute closer!

**skomehillet** (6): Lyrically great, and probably the most depressing of the album considering who and what it's about, but a little too stagnant instrumentally for me to get totally into.

**frogaranaman** (4): This sounds like they attempted trop pop but gave up halfway through with that attempt and just worked with what they already had to finish the song.

**Carlie:** At this point, the album starts to feel pretty "samey" to me. Same Soul was a nice break in pace, but much of the songs on this album are so sonically similar that it's hard to keep them apart for me. However, I like the style they use, so I have no issue with this. This song has a very interesting beat and Lynn's vocals slays me as always.

**Picc:** This song is about Kristen Stewart, apparently.

**ChaseLights** (8.8): The title perfectly encapsulates the really chilly mood they create on this song and it still manages to give up a NICE little groove.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): This is a 12/8 time signature, right? I definitely love how it commands my attention

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): Like in the first few songs, this kind of vibe/mood is definitely where Pvris excels on this album

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): i always forget how this song sounds like

**frogaranaman** (7): I’m cold which is why I have a blanket on me. rooComfy

**kappyko** (7): A stadium stomper, surely.

**IeuanHa** (6.5): It just isn't very memorable to me. I like it but it just feels kinda lacking

Does anybody actually remember that this was the lead single, not Still Into You or Ain’t It Fun? Anyways, I don’t know why but this song + Fast In My Car always makes me think of Divergent for some reason?

---
**agentofscranton** (10): self titled rate when?

**Leixander** (10): A fake-out lead single, it is an outlier in their self/titled album. If anyone asked for "old paramore stuffed in one song" it would be this.

**Mysario** (10): IF THERE'S A FUTURE I WANT IT

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (9): this is probably the worst lead single from all the respective albums here, but it still bops

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): A jam that makes me want to kick ass in a prolonged anime fight scene with a lot of cutaways and slow mo shots

**frogaranaman** (7): This would bump so hard live.

**IeuanHa** (7): an alright song, but compared to alot of songs on the Self-titled record , it falls short for me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A bop

**Carlie:** This track is so beautiful. The intro, Lynn's vocals, the lyrics, the melody. Everything just works, but it comes right after the incredibly strong track Heaven - which probably makes it lose some points.

**Picc:** This song so so accurate feels exactly how I feel with depression. So disconnected. 

---
**lilguavachan** (10): you know, i've never bothered to listen to pvris before but my inner 15 year old baby metalhead and my current big gay bitch self are having a kiki over this

**whatareblackhole** (10): ugh this album is skinny

**IeuanHa** (9.5): I love anger in Lynn's voice in this one

**InfernalSolstice** (9.5): a lil long but still a huge bop

**twat\_brained** (9.4): I definitely appreciate the grungy guitars here, and I love how it's carrying the momentum from "Heaven". I just wish the guitars were mixed a bit lower so I could hear what Lynn was singing. But it's cool! Definitely sounds like a throwback to mid-'00s alt-punk.

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): The chorus definitely does the heavy lifting on this song because it goes hard, but it's prevented from a 10 by the overly long outro

**kappyko** (9): PVRIS have transformed their angst into fun! This rocker thrives on its own kinetic energy. "Half" flies at breakneck speed and Lynn Gunn runs alongside it, keeping in perfect pace with the heavy guitar riffs and creative synth usage of the rest of the band.

**ReallyCreative** (9): Another great song that starts slow but opens up into a really driving force.

**1998tweety** (8.6): Bop

**ChaseLights** (8.4): This suffers a bit from following the intense opener of "Heaven" but it's also really good at winding things down in a necessary way

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The synths on this are sooooo good

**skomehillet** (7): I don’t know what else to say except this is really bringing out the emo 12 year old in me.

**frogaranaman** (6): I’m oscillating between lucidity and delusion due to pain meds and this song exists in the exact space between those two states of reality so I cannot tell if it is good or bad.

**InternetDude19** (6): I like the singer's voice.

**Raykel** (5.7): The mixing really bugs me, I can't hear anything :/

**Carlie:** Idle Worship is a bop, but I have no idea what it's doing this high in the rate. Lyrically it's great, especially when combined with No Friend. The melody is super-catchy, but it's overall it's not the strongest on After Laughter. I imagined this would be closer to #20, but apparently r/popheads decided to be anti-stan twitter for a day.

**Picc:** Hayley snapped all over stan twitter, when will your fave?

---
**CritneySpearz** (11): Deserved #1 BB Hot 100 and a MV

**awryj** (10): LA LA LA LAAAA LA LAAAAAA

**InfernalSolstice** (10): a highlight on an album chock-full of 10's

**Mysario** (9.5): HEEEEEEEEEEEEEE'S THE ONE WHO LIKES ALL OUR PRETTY SONGS AND HE LIKES TO SING ALONG AND HE LIKES TO SHOOT HIS GUN

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Hayley gets harsh with the vocals here and I live for it. Love the wordplay with the title!

**lilguavachan** (9): ended stan culture

**rosecoloreds** (9): kings of calling out toxic stan culture

**rotating3Dtext** (9): I can understand her sentiment against idealization of her but at the same time I know for a fact that the band’s music has helped me many times so I just hope she doesn’t dismiss the impact she’s had on listeners’ lives.

**InternetDude19** (8.8): Don't let me let you down!

**ChaseLights** (8.5): A bop that takes a pin to the balloon of celebrity and fandom that surrounds pop culture. Of course, it gets its darker flip on the following track...

**ExtraEater** (8.5): underrated

**twat\_brained** (8.2): Where exactly does the "worship" fit into this? Is this just Hayley showing tough love to fans who have this idealized image of her, and that she's this great, perfect individual who can do no wrong? That's honestly what I'd like to believe, it enhances the song for me.

**over9000skeletons** (8): this was gonna get my 11 but then the chorus started

**1998tweety** (7.7): This isn't bad but the second half of the album is starting to bore me a bit.

**IeuanHa** (7): I do enjoy this song alot, however while it's lyrics I can appreciate, I struggle to relate to them all that much

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is a No Doubt song in disguise

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this is so close to being interesting

**frogaranaman** (5): This song feels very underdeveloped.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): I liked this song on first listen, but it wore on me really quickly :/ mad respect to Hayley for telling off obnoxious stans tho

**LandonKidatrea** (5): this song sounds to me the most like their older stuff, but they don't go all the way so it just sounds kind of meh...

**kappyko** (4): bad not bop

**TulilpWaffles** (1): I think this is an unpopular opinion, but I really don't like the beat or the singing style, so this song just doesn't work for me.

**Carlie:** We conclude Day 2 by robbing PVIRS hard. With this, PVRIS is down to two main rate songs. Anyone Else is a banging track, a song I just want to dance to and scream along to the lyrics. The intro and instrumentals in this are just perfect and I really wish this had managed to stay in the top 10.

**Picc:** Popheads hates harps and gays. Why?

---
**IndigoAri** (11): This song holds such a special place in my heart for so many reasons. The atmosphere created throughout the song is both strangely familiar and unfamiliar to me. The catchy upbeat tune fused with melancholy lyrics left me in a whirlwind of emotion, a weird combo of butterflies, neasua, and tears. I've never felt so liberated until I heard Lynn yelling " I don't belong to anyone else". Let's be honest though, anytime I hear Lynn yell, I feel liberated.

**fourchip** (10): my other 11 contender tbh

**frogaranaman** (10): Noosa blueberry yogurt is very good.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): This song is Pvris at their best on this album, perfectly blending a haunting vibe with strong instrumentals

**hikkaru** (10): A groovy bop that goes harder as the song progresses, and the harp outro is beautiful.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this song has seriously been with me through desperate times of need. If Bleachers wasn’t in this rate, this would probably be my 11 (yes i know i said this too in Paramore’s “Tell Me How”).

**tapdancingpig** (10): This is kinda pop perfection? But also screaming.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): I DON’T BELONG TO ANYONE ELSE

**vhqv1997** (9): When she screamed "I don't belong to anyone else" in the last chorus, I felt that...

**whatareblackhole** (9): love a harp solo

**1998tweety** (8.6): Another bop, not the biggest fan of the post-chorus bit but the rest of the song is still great. The screaming bit at the end brought it up for me, takes notes Bleachers this is how you do it.

**InfernalSolstice** (8.5): felt like it could've used a bit more substance but what is there is amazing

**skargardin** (8.5): Come thru backup vocals

**twat\_brained** (8.2): don't belong to no city don't belong to no man. that harp at the end is hypnotic.

**IeuanHa** (8): Not quite of the same quality of the two songs prior, but still a solid song

**kappyko** (8): This band should win an award for "best second verses in a song". Gunn delivers a suitable ode to monogamy with some jamming oh my god the next song started oops

**skomehillet** (8): The chorus, although repetitive caught my attention and made me like this song. It’s dark.

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): It's pretty good but pretty forgettable

**ChaseLights** (7.7): This apes The Cranberries a bit too much for my liking and I don't think it really suits them as well as other songs on the album do but I do like the song a lot for the most part.
