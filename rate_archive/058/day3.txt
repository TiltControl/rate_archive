I really like electropop so electropop rock is a-okay with me. Somebody described PVRIS as Halsey meets Pop Punk/Rock (specifically Blink-182 lol), and I love both of those things. A really good lead single with an 11-worthy chorus.

---
**agentofscranton** (10): personally my favourite pvris song

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): It's a personal attack that this couldn't be my 11 because this song is such a fucking jam it hurts

**Mysario** (10): Irish I was drunk rn

**IeuanHa** (9): I often find that I prefer songs from White Noise to AWKOHAWNOH and this one is certainly one of those, it stands above most songs from their newer album, and is overall just a rocking tune

**static\_int\_husp** (9): A legitimate banger, moreso than the stuff on the album we're actually rating

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This shit slaps

**ChaseLights** (8.5): A classic bop that goes all the way off. It's a shame people sleep on PVRIS so much.

**frogaranaman** (6): More of a live song than a studio song but I dig it. Also, if they went harder with the scene changes in the music video, the song would seem to go so much harder.

**Leixander** (6): Apple Music literally labeled this song as "St.Vincent" in their Editors' Notes for the album and it makes me scream.

**Carlie:** First out on Day 3, we have this shimmering masterpiece. The intro kinda sounds like an ice-cream commercial, but I dig it. This song is so hopeful and the lyrics presents the issue of «trying again» so delicately. I just love it.

**Picc:** As must as I think I didn't like this song before, it's definitely grown on me and deserves the top 10!!! (PS...this feels like Reich's Piano Phase pls kill me)

---
**rosecoloreds** (11): i love how this is supposed to be a love song but it has that dark undertone like... you love this one person and they hurt you but you're still gonna dive right back into this relationship. it's soft and dark at the same time

**IeuanHa** (10): opens up the second half the the album with a cheeky, fun and full of life song

**kappyko** (10): underrated bop

**Leixander** (10): Self-fulfilling prophecy. This song is about Hayley's now past marriage most likely.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): drowning is the way i prefer to go. the references of being underwater, and of course, the song title, makes me smile and feel the invisible water around me, though.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): it's so catchy wtf

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Amazing chorus and another song I don't see people appreciate quite as much as I feel like they should

**awryj** (9): invented metaphors

**hikkaru** (9): This and Taylor's Clean sound like what i think water would sound like if turned into music and it's neat

**InfernalSolstice** (9): very cute bop

**vhqv1997** (9): Florence Welch is still the queen of singing about water and using drowning as a metaphor for a suffocating relationship, but Hayley comes the closest to snatching that crown, I guess

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Diving into day 3 of the rate like… admittedly the album's starting to get a bit samey, but all the songs thus far are fantastic, so I'm willing to excuse it.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Wow this album is on fire, for me the chorus with the more subdued singing is the highlight.

**ChaseLights** (8.4): This is groovy and I love the melody during the chorus. I'm running out of things to say and really, I don't know what else to say about After Laughter that all the other gays here aren't gonna say because we're all suckers for 80s sounds and aesthetics. You can't say gays aren't bought on the cheap.

**tapdancingpig** (8): The lyrics are pretty great, and the chorus kind of reminds me of Head Over Feet from Jagged Little Pill, which is my favorite song on that album.

**ExtraEater** (7.5): good title

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Indie band Porches are shaking

**frogaranaman** (6): I honestly forget what this song is like.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): The production on this song overwhelms Hayley's voice entirely and kills the song for me

**Carlie:**Suddenly Jack is down to one song! This song is soooooooooo good. This is probably the boppiest track on Gone Now. It also features vocals from CRJ, which probably drags this up a few points for popheads. This also just sounds fantastic live.

**Picc:** This song tanked early and just never recovered. Popheads really hates Jack so much that they're willing to tank Carly? 

---
**TragicKingdom1** (11): a fucking ANTHEM. carly won

**awryj** (10): Party for One made me question my stannage of Carly but even if I didn't like her at all, a duo of her + Jack just works. Their vocals on the chorus is pure 80s new wave bliss. A highlight.

**InfernalSolstice** (10): we love carl rey jopsin

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): carly slay my pusssy jepsen

**tapdancingpig** (10): Pretty cute. The songwriting’s kind of fun, Jack’s voice fits, Carly is Ari’s kind of woman (read: God), and the production is cute and just 80’s enough.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): For some reason the opening of this song is absolute perfection - the rest of the song is amazing to but the intro and first verse are holy.

**Mysario** (9.5): there's just something about this song I can't help but love, it just cuts to my feelings

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): Probably the best song on this album, and it's not particularly close. The backing vocals from pop queens and the smooth and sultry chords throughout make me fall in love with it.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): A wild Carly Rae Jepsen appeared!

**frogaranaman** (9): So unexpectedly boppy.

**LandonKidatrea** (9): this song is stuck in my head and it won't leave send help

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Carly make good music again challenge

**rosesmp3** (9): and you know what? i really like this song

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Very good feature by the Goddess of /r/popheads herslef, Carly Rae Jepsen. Also really good lyrics about self doubt and relationships.

**vhqv1997** (9): This song is possibly the closest we'll ever get to a Lorde and Carly collaboration

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): who can relate woo. hello carly

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Well so far I hate this album so at least I'm in Jack's camp on that front. I will say this: it's a step up from the album's introductory couplet and it feels like I'm starting to experience the "sound" which has gained this album its reverence.

**Leixander** (8.5): carly gimme them ad-libs

**1998tweety** (8.1): It's kind of cute.

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): A bop but Carly doesn't really add anything to the song

**InternetDude19** (8): Is it just me or is this song quieter than the rest of the album?

**ChaseLights** (7.9): A proper bop. Not surprised with Julia Michaels and Carly Rae Jepsen involved. This is where Jack-off really excels and I think he does experimental work well for other artists, but it doesn't really work when he's the only one experimenting. This is just a great pop song and he's good at those.

**skomehillet** (7.8): Lorde and Carly Rae Jepsen doing background vocals is really cool. They elevate this song. Also am I hearing the end guitar part from “Some Nights” in here? Anyway, this is a fun and danceable tune with a really interesting concept that I admittedly don’t really understand. Lemme go back to Genius.

**ExtraEater** (7.5): really good title

**IeuanHa** (7): I really like the vocals here

**kappyko** (4): Antonoff doesn't sound very committed to the disdain his lyrics would indicate. The pre-chorus aims for quirkiness but mostly feels irritating. The hook is catchy in an H1N1 sort of way. It's not very '80s at all, as Antonoff imbues his self-hatred with fuzzy synths and odd chorus vocals. In fact, I think it would be great for my church's Vacation Bible School this year.

**over9000skeletons** (4): sounds like a shit 1975 song. all the cringe of a hamilton fanfic

**Carlie:** PVRIS joins Jack in the ‘1 song left’-club. Heaven is such a haunting and powerful song. The chorus is both quiet and full of energy. This has some of the most interesting production on All We Know Off… and Lynn’s vocals sounds beautiful as always.

**Picc:** So now it's just a race to the top huh.... The Paramore stans are too strong aren't they?

---
**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): now THAT’s how you open your album!

**ExtraEater** (10): goes hard

**InfernalSolstice** (10): massive sad boi hours bop, one of my favorite songs of theirs

**LandonKidatrea** (10): damn good song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is probably my favorite song on the whole album, the background vocals are on some Gregorian chant shit and it’s incredible. Plus, it has one of the best choruses in the rate and that’s saying something considering who else is here.

**twat\_brained** (10): God, the DRUMS on this! I have goosebumps just from writing this and listening to it; Lynn sounds incredibly cathartic and it's just such a great pump-up attitude that I get from this song. It must be great live.

**vhqv1997** (10): That title is exactly what this song sounds like

**whatareblackhole** (10): :kimbryell:

**ChaseLights** (9.5): A haunting start to a great album, can't help but scream "YOU TOOK MY, YOU TOOK MY" when she gets to the breakdown at the end

**Leixander** (9.5): I love the angst in this, reminds me of Evanescence (Amy Lee) somehow.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I love how this song opens up, such a cool way to start an album.

**1998tweety** (9.3): I did not know what their music sounded like so this is a great first introduction; great opener.

**awryj** (9): ok they kinda did that with this one. i was expecting this to go full avocadies but then she started SCREAMING and i very much enjoyed that

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): It's a busy song for sure, but it does a good job at delivering the dramatics properly (though I have yet to see Lynn do the chorus live well)

**IeuanHa** (9): I feel this to be a fantastic opener to the record, it sets the tone really well

**Mysario** (9): why is the first song called Heaven but the last song isn't called Hell?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9): definitely the best song on the album

**frogaranaman** (8): After further listening, I can indeed conclude: this fucking slaps.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): my favorite part was the strings

**kappyko** (6): "Heaven" veers ever so slightly into Evanescence territory through Lynn Gunn's emotive vocals. I should hate this post-1975, post-Neighbourhood doom and gloom, but with the help of some really pretty backing vocals and passionate performances PVRIS indicate a need to be noticed. The lyrics are so goth they hurt, but if you let yourself into PVRIS's fantasy you're in for a decent time. Listen to the groove of that second verse!

**skomehillet** (6): Dark. The albums opens with guns blazing. That harp at the end is dope

**over9000skeletons** (5): this song is like an unfulfilling wank

**Carlie:** Told You So has a banging fucking beat. This song does trop-pop rock right. The only thing that drags this a bit down is the kinda repetitive chorus, especially when paired with the repetitive bridge. Still a chill bop tho.

**Picc:** Best song on the album says what?

---
**letsallpoo** (11): I love how restrained this song is compared to the other songs on this album and in this rate. The production is minimal, and the lyrics aren't terribly intricate, but this minimalism makes the listener focus in on the little details that bring this song to life - stuff like the little distorted vocals in the verses, or the tumbling bassline after the first chorus. This is easily the song that's aged the best for me from this album.

**whatyourheartdesires** (11): I wasn't sure this new style suits them after Hard Times came out, but this seems like a blend of the old Paramore with this (fake) happy synthy new Paramore and has convinced me to love the whole album

**ChaseLights** (10): There's absolutely nothing wrong with this song, but I've already given my 11 to PVRIS and deservedly so.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): The beat in this song is fantastic and it has one of the few bridges I enjoy on the album

**kappyko** (10): Guitars in xylophone-like melodies - bop

**Leixander** (10): I wish I could give multiple 11s, even though the lyrics are lazy in some parts I just love this song with all my heart. I wanna see them live just to scream "Throw me into the fire, throw me and pull me off again!" part.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9.5): not one of my favourites but still a great song

**ReallyCreative** (9): If there's anything to complain about in this song it's that the fun vocal modulations that happen in the first two verses aren't really repeated in any way. The chorus is pretty good but nothing spectacular.

**twat\_brained** (9): So shouty and cheery, I love it!

**skomehillet** (8): Sounds like a direct continuation of the previous track but it’s still killer.

**tapdancingpig** (7.9): Not the most showy song on the album, but it still bops, and the lyrics are fairly interesting.

**IeuanHa** (7.5): I like this alot, but it's not quite as good as the two before it imo

**InfernalSolstice** (7.5): great verses but a disappointingly weak chorus

**1998tweety** (7.4): Honestly at first I really really did not like this song and it lowkey killed my hype because of the chorus, but after some time it has grown on me. The bass is killer.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Guitar on this is so underrated

**frogaranaman** (6): The vocal modulation on this song is great, but the rest of the song is just.. not.

**Carlie:** This is possibly the best ballad Paramore has ever done. It feels me with this aching sadness. The way Hayley delivers the lyrics makes me wanna cry. The violin just ties everything together into a perfect 10.

**Picc:** Honestly if Bleachers and PVRIS weren't in this rate, this would be my 11. I'm currently 26 and dealing with absolutely horrible depression, so this song hits me right in the heart. 

---
**extrasmallbillie** (11): : when AL first came out my sister had passed away just a few months before and this was the album I needed at the moment, and 26 was the song that I needed to here. It may not have told me that everything is going to be a okay and you will always be happy after this, but you will survive this and get through it and make it to the other side. This song helped me realize that sometimes just being able to survive really hard times (makes you wonder why you even try!) or a hard year is more than enough and having hope isn't foolish, it's part of being able to survive.

**rosesmp3** (11): this song made me cry the first time I listened to it and it still makes me cry the x amount of times I've listened to it since then. Out of all the songs on AL I think this is the most vulnerable which is an accomplishment. The lyrics are so personal yet so relatable at the same time, enhanced by Hayley's tender vocals.

**strawberryswing1** (11): When I saw Paramore in concert this summer they performed this during a stripped down part of the concert along with Passionfruit and Misguided Ghosts. Hayley gave a little speech right before she performed this, and I forget what it was about mainly, I think just some introspective, inspiring stuff about life, and I started tearing up in the middle of the damn pit. Anyway this song is just gorgeous and perfect.

**WilsonJason** (11): I cant give Are You Ten Years Ago my 11 so I guess the best song on After Laughter gets it

**BearlyEvenAPun** (10): Gorgeous song, came very close to getting my 11. It just hits you in all the right places.

**IeuanHa** (10): this is just a beautiful ballad, Hayley's vocals are so emotional and Taylor's work on the strings goes perfectly. A great song to cry to

**InfernalSolstice** (10): i don't know what to say about this other than the fact that it's beautiful

**Leixander** (10): https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/026/489/crying.jpg

**skomehillet** (10): The glockenspiel. The strings. The lyrics. The strings. The melodies. A dreamy yet somber self reflection. This is the last song I remember (almost) crying to, and I don’t ~cry so like. I am very much a dreamer who daydreams a bunch and is often weighed down by the what-ifs of life, so hearing Hayley Williams tell me to hold on to hope if I’ve got it and to not let it go for nobody is…exactly what I need to hear. I lift weights to this song.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Yeah, hopeless dreamer songs are my drug of choice. I fell for this one hook line and sinker.

**TulilpWaffles** (10): This song feels like Haley Williams is singing me a lullaby, it's so comforting despite how sad some of the lyrics are.

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is already so sad, but the moment I started to get teary is when I realized Hayley is actually just talking to herself

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): depresso espresso also the strings are without a doubt the best thing in this song

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): once more hayley saves me

**Mysario** (9.5): the counterpart to their previous hit "Brick by Boring Brick" hits hard

**1998tweety** (9.2): In an album filled with extravagant and fun production, an acoustic ballad stands out but not in a bad way. To me it actually elevates the song and the whole album.

**awryj** (9): a little bit too cheesy for a 10 but its got that sad disney song realness

**GamblesWithDesire** (9): The most depressingly beautiful Disney Princess song the world has ever known

**kappyko** (9): "The Only Exception"'s mellowed out sequel.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): A welcome change of pace in the album and a gorgeous song

**Raykel** (9): I was trying to choose the best lyric to write down then realized that's just the whole song

**ReallyCreative** (9): Another good ballad, though I think some of the lyrics could be tightened up a bit. I like the sound a lot and it's just a nice song.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Not really the ballad type but Hayley's managed to sway me in her favor on this one. I guess just the desperation and vulnerability really speak to me in some way.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (8): this age terrifies me. will i still be alive to witness myself turn 26? will i die from natural causes? will i finally off myself? will i finally learn how to drive? i have 3 years left to find out.

**ChaseLights** (7.5): This is also a great ballad. Still not the best ballad here.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The chorus is very special, and while the rest of the song is pretty standard, it’s a nice moment of respite on the album.

**frogaranaman** (4): God, being 26 is going to suck huh? If it’s as boring as this song sonically sounds, that is.

**Carlie:** Just barely making their way into the top 5, we now have to say goodbye to PVRIS. What’s Wrong is a banging and boppy pop rock track with a chorus you can scream out. This (and PVRIS as a whole) honestly did much better than expected. This had a very slow climb upwards and finally managed to get into the top 5 with the final set of scores.

**Picc:** Just like 26, this hits hard like a punch in the face. It's so blatant and honest, with the entire premise rising around the difficulties around vaguely talking about depression, and the exhaustion of it to the point where all you can do is say exactly what's going on. With PVRIS completely out now, I have to say that they did so much better than I expected, and I thank everyone for giving them a chance!! So proud of my LGBT icons

---
**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): “don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable” is a hell of a lyric! love this ode to self-loathing and desperately wanting your concerns to be validated

**frogaranaman** (10): The chorus lets me know that whoever wrote this song is an English major.

**hikkaru** (10): smack my ass like a drum bc the percussion (alongside the pulsating synth) in this song is infectious

**IndigoAri** (10): Wig gone!!

**InfernalSolstice** (10): colossal bop

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): these lyrics are perfect for screaming wtf

**skomehillet** (10): The driving, anthemic chorus on this song is my favorite off the whole album. You could do a really mean strut to this; it's a whole bop. It’s Dark. It bangs. Synthwave forever

**lilguavachan** (9.5): what the fuck why did i not bother to listen to them before? this album is turning out to be bop after bop

**1998tweety** (9.2): a GOOD depression bop

**ChaseLights** (9): If anyone says this doesn't go all the way off, they're a goddamn liar. This song is such a kick-ass bop.

**awryj** (8.8): you cant go wrong with a pulsing 80s bass synth. if it was less avocadey i would stan

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Again, the grunge influences blend together really well with the synths here. I also find it ironic how she says she doesn't need a metaphor, when metaphors are one of the most common writing themes in song lyrics. Definitely makes me appreciate the self-awareness.

**IeuanHa** (8.5): The lyric 'don't need a metaphor for you to know I'm miserable' I just love

**GamblesWithDesire** (8): The first song where Lynn's mumbling begins to take effect, so the score is carried mainly by the beat and music

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is the dance rock chorus I never knew I needed

**kappyko** (7): The chorus-ending lyric is bizarre: she doesn't "need a metaphor", but much of this song is composed of them? The lyrics get to me, but this straightforward heavy synth-led tune does well in its drive.

**InternetDude19** (6): I'm going to sound like my mother when I say this but, I like the beat.

Piccprincess: # All We Know Of Heaven, All We Need Of Hell

---

**Overall average**: 7.749

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This album was worse than I remember it being. The general sound isn't anything special aside from Lynn's voice (and even then it only fits part of the time.) Plus, it just feels extremely repetitive; I could not differentiate between any of the songs after 2 listens. This could be worse but ultimately doesn't really hit hard on any level. [Grade: C+]

**WilsonJason**: I have no idea why I dont listen to these guys way more I love this album everytime I listen to it. I think I've given it higher scores than After Laughter.

**jamesfog**: Very surprisingly consistently good.

**Leixander**: Listened with low expectations, ended up listening to a consistent and great album.

**ExtraEater**: crazy good album considering it's the only one in this rate i hadn't already heard beforehand. probably has my highest avg for this rate.

**InternetDude19**: This doesn't belong here. It is not nearly as pop as the other two albums. Also I've only listened to this album once.

**IeuanHa**: Why they opened it with Heaven but didn't close with Hell I have no idea, but it will always annoy me :P

**xxpizzasrlifexx**: I really liked this album. Definitely something I'll be coming back to.

**whatareblackhole**: I love this album! I had a friend recommend PVRIS to me, and he was spot on in identifying my taste. AWKOH... is an incredible album and I’m hoping popheads will recognize it for all it is worth. Their blend of Florence and Evanescence and (old) Paramore is really cool and I absolutely adore the sound.

**frogaranaman**: My comments on this album will make no sense as I am recovering from a wisdom teeth removal surgery. Enjoy.

**skomehillet**: 7.5

**GamblesWithDesire**: The one where Lynn gives Ariana a run for her money in pronunciation, or, "Strong opening half, mediocre second half, pt.3"

**InfernalSolstice**: i love lynn gunn with my whole heart

**Mysario**: I remember seeing this band in like 2012-2013 at the local stage at Warped Tour in Mansfield and working with one of my fave pop-punk bands A Loss For Words at times. Lyndsey is a queen. support your local musicians!!! anyways this album is just amazing and while there's no real stand-out tracks (outside of No Mercy for me), every song is still a bop

**twat\_brained**: I'd say my favorite album of 2017 was Dua Lipa, but I'd like to retroactively put this as a very close 2nd. It's everything I could want from a pop rock band; PVRIS are fucking great! I look forward to their next album.

**Carlie:** Fake Happy just misses out on a 9+ average and a spot in the top 3. The chorus is energetic, and it’s probably the song that sums up After Laughter best as a whole. The synths are giving me everything I want, but sadly this suffered a bit from overplay in 2017/2018 for me.

**Picc:** BIG MOOD BIG MOOD. Literally so relatable it makes my head hurt.

---
**1998tweety** (11): I love love love songs like this which start off with a more stripped back bit and later grow into a louder and bigger song. Like pretty much every song on this album, the lyrics and production (especially the bass) are killer.

**GamblesWithDesire** (11): The amount of times I have mentally listened to this song at work, smiling at my coworkers to hide my crushing depression and anxiety, is too damn high. It's a flawless song and the highlight of the album

**kappyko** (11): im writing this essay on the last day but it's a sweet song and one that really strikes me despite the cliche lyrics

**Raykel** (11): Some of their best lyrics, specifically the beginning just stops you in your tracks

**tapdancingpig** (11): This song feels incredibly personal to Hayley, but it also REALLY resonates with me. It helps that Hayley sings the shit out of it.

**hikkaru** (10): The last chorus makes me tear up a bit tbh

**InfernalSolstice** (10): literally the most relatable song i've ever heard, it helped me through a lot of hard times and helped me realize "okay I'm not in this alone"

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): sometimes i wonder to myself “why do people even go to parties when it seems like it just makes us feel worn out?”

**ReallyCreative** (10): I hate to generalize a generation but this song captures an emotion that people of my age (early 20s to early 30s) know all too well. I've never heard a song so blunt about having to appear happy to fit in or to make it seem like nothing's wrong to other people. I can feel this in every party I go to, every time I go out, every time I have to spend time with an acquaintance who I like enough to spend time with, but don't know well enough to let them in on my emotional baggage. It's so exhausting.

**rotating3Dtext** (10): it’s scary when you can relate to every single thing in a song (applies to multiple songs from this album)

**skargardin** (10): With the risk of sounding extremely sad-boi clichéy: it came at a time that I needed it the most and begun a process of healing from a real shit period of my life. Anything other than top three for this and I’m going to get very disappointed with you all.

**TulilpWaffles** (10): Honestly can't believe how much I relate to what she's saying in this song, everything about it is incredible.

**twat\_brained** (10): The millennial whoop here just makes the song so great and just delivers tenfold on the catharsis and anger here, and I feel every single note Hayley sings, from the downtempo, sombre notes to the top-of-her-lungs shrieks of frustration. One of the best songs of 2017 if you ask me.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): Paramore has never been more relatable

**extrasmallbillie** (9.8): : so I know everyone hates on the music video bc people think it's just Hayley but I really love it and is one of my favorites from this era.

**Mysario** (9.5): fake it til you make it

**vhqv1997** (9.5): Look, this song is already good, I'm not denying that, but do you know what would make it so much more amazing? A longer chorus. Seriously, just two more lines and this song would have absolutely smashed, but now it's just... a nice song.

**LandonKidatrea** (9): "I should've known that when things are going good that's when I get knocked down" barabarapapabarabarapapa Perfectly encapsulates the tonal whiplash and lyrical dissonance the album is going for. This song is really good.

**rosesmp3** (9): i love the acoustic intro

**skomehillet** (8.9): If they cut out the acoustic intro this would’ve been a 9

**Leixander** (8.5): Best intro in this album, a bit too long however.

**awryj** (8): i love the chorus but i'm not a fan of the slow intro... it's not engaging enough imo

**frogaranaman** (8): Did you mean: my entire life?

**IeuanHa** (8): Awesome lyrics, although the song itself isn't as good as its sometimes hyped to be

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is real middle school depression shit but it’s also a bop so

**ChaseLights** (6.5): Not my favorite one here.

**rosecoloreds** (6.5): unpopular opinion but the only song that's worse on this album is grudges

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): I really do not like the intro. The rest is fine, I guess

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): we get it you're sad can you come up with something else CAN YOU COME UP WITH SOMETHING ELSE

**Carlie:** My favorite After Laughter single goes out at #3. The «low-key, no pressure» chant is kinda iconic tbh. Somebody in the comment section for the MV called this depression set to an 80s beat, which is definetly all I want in the music I listen to. It had a really good run but eventually had to concede to the many many 11s the top 2 songs got.

**Picc:** LORDY this one got close to winning it all a while ago! Incredible song, incredible video

---
**Leixander** (11): My most listened song for two years in a row, safe to say it is perfection for me. Great hook? Check. Great instrumentals? Check. Great bridge? Check. Nice lyrics? Check. Ending with the hook? Check. Transition perfectly to the next song? Check Check Check.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): perfect execution of a song, “I’ve been there before” lyrics, can be used as a weapon, really catchy, good music video

**theburningundead** (11): I love this song so much, and I feel like it’s a perfect representation of the album as a whole. I love the contrast between the instrumental and the lyrics, and I’m never quite sure whether it makes me want to dance, cry, or do both at the same time.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): This is my favourite Paramore song ever, very catchy and relatable also the MV is their best ever. This deserves at least a top 5 in the rate.

**fourchip** (10): guitar riff is SO clean omg what a bop

**frogaranaman** (10): Thanks for the bleak reminder about my worldview, Hayley.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): This song deserved more success than it got, but FBR doesn't give a shit

**InfernalSolstice** (10): this song and video are both super relatable which is rare for me since I don't usually connect with music, and even beyond that it's just a fantastic song

**kappyko** (10): originally album-track now-single bop

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love Taylor York

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): An incredible song and if I'm being honest, this is the peak of the album and it's all downhill from here :(

**rosesmp3** (10): this entire album is a Mood but this song in particular is The Mood

**twat\_brained** (10): Brilliant stuff and I LOVED the televised news video that went with it. And I appreciate what Hayley's going for here, she's making an upbeat dancey song about not being able to always have an upbeat attitude about everything. It also probably says a lot about the state Hayley had been stuck in prior to this album.

**vhqv1997** (10): LOWKEY NO PRESSURE JUST HANG WITH ME AND MY WEATHER

**whatareblackhole** (10): glasses on, ladies!

**ReallyCreative** (9.8): Any song that can articulate sarcasm through the lyrical delivery is a winner for me, not quite as good as Hard Times but I love this song and it definitely keeps the album heading in the right direction

**IeuanHa** (9.5): just another solid song, even better live

**1998tweety** (9): A great song to follow Hard Times. Lyrics are great and again the production is a lot of fun. The one thing I'd change would be to give the chorus an extra little kick.

**ChaseLights** (9): LOWKEY! NO PRESSURE!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): The three-song stretch on the beginning of this album is really just something else. This song wasn’t one of my favorites when I first heard the album but after seeing it live it just slaps so hard.

**Mysario** (8.5): I really like the lyrics but this song always felt like it could've been somehow more

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): i fell off this song but jumped back on during phvmas tbh

**ExtraEater** (7): good title

Now. This is a good cover, it’s very beautiful and calming - but I’m not a very big fan of the song itself. I like this more than I like Drake’s original, but it’s not a 10 imo.

---
**Leixander** (10): One of those covers that are better than their original versions.

**strawberryswing1** (10): ugh perfection

**tapdancingpig** (10): This was ridiculously soothing.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I fucking love this cover and I’m so glad they played it on tour

**IeuanHa** (9.5): Paramore takes a song I don't like by an artist I don't like and makes me like it

**vhqv1997** (9): Literally the worst person to ever sing Drake songs is Drake

**frogaranaman** (8): I used to work with this girl who is a Paramore stan and she was insufferable about how good this live cover, but damn if it isn’t a bop.

**InternetDude19** (8): Fantastic.

**WilsonJason** (7): Redeemed a fucking horrendous song

**ExtraEater** (6): i remember when this was posted on popheads and there was an unnecessary mess in the comments

**skomehillet** (6): I don't like the original that much so I don't really care for this, BUT the "Hold on We're Going Home" lyrics they add at the end is nice.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): Gotta admit that I've never really gotten the overwhelming praise for this cover? Hayley sounds incredible but that's about it for me because otherwise it's just…there

This song was my introduction to Bleachers. I didn’t know that if was made my a guy from fun., I didn’t know he produced on 1989, I knew nothing. I actually thought Bleachers was a kpop group because of the guy on the single cover. This is a perfect tune imo, it’s catchy, punchy and sorta euphoric too. It’s like that scene in Perks of Being A Wallflower - it’s the song you want to scream out standing upright in a car at night.

---
**agentofscranton** (10): strange desire rate when? (Picc note: start pushing for it!!!!)

**extrasmallbillie** (10): : this song is one of those songs that you play ever year on NewYearsDay.mp3 thinking maybe this year will actually be better than last year. I love this song very very much.

**frogaranaman** (10): This is the song I listen to every single time I get into a depressed hole I don’t know how to climb out of. So.. I listen to this song every single day.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): This song is a banger

**InternetDude19** (10): This is one of the songs I frequently hum to myself. I love it to death.

**Mysario** (10): same

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): One of my favorite songs of all time, an absolute banger and an instant classic.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): the guitar solo shreads

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): EXTREME BOP

**TragicKingdom1** (10): Strange Desire vs. I Like It When You Sleep... vs other(s) when

**vhqv1997** (10): This song is an 11

**ExtraEater** (8.5): really good title

**tapdancingpig** (8): This bops really hard, and also disguises that Jack’s singing is awful very well.

**ChaseLights** (7.3): A pretty good bop, all things considered.

**IeuanHa** (1): I just don't like this at all, something about it rubs me the wrong way

**Carlie:** Now, this song started an ERA but somehow never, not even once, hit #1 during this rate. It was always very close, both when RCB and DTTM was #1, but it didn’t manage to close the gap. Hard Times is an iconic lead single - both the MV and the song itself has memorable moments. This song is full on 80’s joyfulness - the guitar riff and the punchiness of the drums makes this a song it’s hard not to atlas bop along to. You had a good run, Paramore. See you (with a new album) soon. Hopefully.

**Picc:** This was an absolutely incredible race, with both Carlie and I freaking out with each new result coming in. As much as I personally love this song, it was way overplayed thus resulting in a lower score from me. Sorry Paramore stans! Maybe next time.

---
**agentofscranton** (11): my favourite song of all time bar none, easiest 11 of my life

**awryj** (11): This song is one of my favorite songs of 2017. I used to dismiss Paramore as that "edgy teenager pop punk band" but when Hard Times dropped, boy was I surprised. I love how funky, catchy and creative this song is. Combining a happy melody and sad lyrics might seem like a tired trick, but in case of Hard Times, it just works.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (11): Talking Heads who? this song owns and I play it when I'm feeling depressed. it's near the top of my iTunes Top 25 Most Played. I am learning a lot about myself today

**dramiaa** (11): Paramore went pop and it worked perfectly! The upbeat intrumentals depict the opposite of the lyrics, and thats what makes this track work so well. My go to happy/sad song

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): Hard Times is a strong track to open an album with. I think it does a great job of introducing the main topics and themes of After Laughter, while still being an extremely fun and overall incredible track.

**ExtraEater** (11): the bridge is life, also good title

**hikkaru** (11): god that xylophone riff at the beginning that transitions into the guitar gets me PUMPED. The definition of dance-crying and a song that deserved so much better on the charts. UNGH!

**Mysario** (11): as a fan of Paramore since their early days, this was incredibly strange when this first dropped. Calypso music? In my pop-punk band? The more I listened, the more I came to appreciate the sound and understand the struggles that Hayley and the band has had to go through. Or something. Whatever, issa bop and this song is a top so I'm gonna get to rock bottom

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): I have a bad habit of not keeping up with music releases from artists I'm already not an avid fan of, so I'm not sure why I recall listening to Hard Times on its release date; I've enjoyed bits of Paramore's output before, but I suppose the only thing that drew me to giving it a try so soon was the amount of praise it got from this subreddit. For my first few listens of Hard Times, though, my opinion of the song mostly considered of one word; what? I didn't get why Hayley Williams was yelling at me every few seconds, and I didn't understand what the music itself was actually trying to do. But fine wine only gets better with age; now, I love the entire pack of cards Hard Times brings to the table. An excellent progression from their previous pop punk leanings into After Laughter's nu wave influences, the song strikes that perfect match between artistic innovation and remaining in comfortable territory in terms of catchiness. Hard Times is a special sort of song in today's musical landscape, and while I'm still not the biggest fan of After Laughter as an entire record, I personally can't wait to see how it and its parent album's sounds influence other artists in the future.

**SinfulAnarchy** (11): this song is infectiously catchy and has a bubblegum, vintage groove that juxtaposes nicely with the dark lyrics. A smooth departure from Paramore's traditional sound.

**therokinrolla** (11): Paramore used to make music that felt rant-y, in a  good way. It felt meandering and sometimes like it could switch up at any moment. And it was lovely, and it worked well with their "emo" punk pop sound. With After Laughter, theyve changed it up and what used to feel messy, but in a good way, now feels pristine, clean cut, and like they spent months perfection the catchy melodies and the flawless production. Hard Times is the best example of this new sound, whether it's the marimba that begins the melodic theme of the song, or the sudden pseudo-yell Hayley does at the end of the chorus. It just all feels so finely tuned and crafted to make the most fun song ever, except it's not really fun at all if you listen to the lyrics. Depression has truly never been more exciting.

**twat\_brained** (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_e8UF9NNuA if this was the song it'd be a 12

**vhqv1997** (11): That instrumental outro made me orgasm

**zekkyzach** (11): yeah i'm basic, so what?

**1998tweety** (10): An incredible pop song, the production on this is so so good. I especially love the breakdown at the end.

**frogaranaman** (10): Me when I drop my iced coffee on my way to an 8am class.

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): A jam and a half, applicable in every situation from emotionally destroying, like soul crushing depression, to mildly annoying, like trying to make a sandwich but both pieces of bread have holes GONNA MAKE YOU WONDER WHY YOU EVEN TRY

**InfernalSolstice** (10): iconic lead single that deserved soooo much better, one of my first PH threads that I commented in too :)

**InternetDude19** (10): This is the song that got me into Paramore.

**kappyko** (10): 2017 got touted as the year that all of our favorite musicians came back to drop mediocre projects, but Paramore was clearly not in that camp. "Hard Times" shifts the group into new wave revival slyly, echoing Walk the Moon and all the other alt radio fodder but with much more personality than the masculine woes of most of them. i forgot to finish my comments

**letsallpoo** (10): https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/sMwTtIAM-saNjhjO1G4fKsXyBRgk1ZcQOzRyPkjLeXo/http/i.imgur.com/e0p7lt9.gif

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): who would’ve expected an alt-rock band to shake up the world by releasing an upbeat-straight-up-pop about battling depression?

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): U H H

**Raykel** (10): A staple for the "What are some happy songs disguised as sad songs?" type threads

**ReallyCreative** (10): Catchy, fun, but at the same time the right amount of dark. This song is such a good way to kick off this album and is one of my favorite Paramore songs. There's not much more to say, if anything it's a little too short but that's because you just want to hear more.

**skomehillet** (10): Despite its themes, it's a really bright and colorful way to open the album, and is what finally turned me into a Paramore fan. The vocoder at the end was corny at first but now I find it to be a fun addition to the track.

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song is ridiculously fun, and then you listen into the lyrics. It’s still fun, but also you start crying.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i hate using the word bop but the only way I can describe this song is that it bops so hard

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): i didn’t know how much i needed this retro sound with depression lyrics until this came out...

**Leixander** (9.5): Without the vocoder part this would be a perfect song.

**IeuanHa** (9): Such a strong lead single

**LandonKidatrea** (9): should've taken over the mainstream. i'm upset that this song didn't become a megahit

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Interesting instrumental, good lyrics

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This is the most graceful transition from to pop I’ve ever seen, this song truly bops and yet still sounds exactly like Paramore.

**ChaseLights** (8.8): A bop. Hayley's gonna make these other girls wonder why they even try with her bops.

**extrasmallbillie** (8.8): : the day that Hard Times came out was the only none shitty day of the entire year of 2017.

**Gews** (8.5): This album is the most 'me' thanks to introductory bops

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): good central riff, wish there was a tad more here tho

**fourchip** (7): always been kinda overrated tbh

**whatareblackhole** (6): ........no thx

**IDontWorkHereAtAll** (0): There is something that feels inherently reductive about this song. It heralded in the new 'era' of Paramore, but instead of being a starting point for something new and exciting, it followed the same formula as Twenty One Pilots (cheerful song, depressive lyrics). This song made me fear for the future of Paramore.

Piccprincess: # After Laughter

---

**Overall average**: 8.080

---

**TragicKingdom1**: This album is heavily discussed on the sub, and I agree that the first 3 tracks deserve some praise. But otherwise, I find this pretty empty and dull. The sound works a lot better on paper than in execution, and it's generally lacking tension after track 2. I'm trying hard not to be pretentious here but I think if popheads looked marginally deeper into indie synthpop they can find projects that do what this album is trying to do much better. [Grade: C]

**ExtraEater**: vibrant

**InternetDude19**: While I don't love this album as much as I love Gone Now, I think it is far more consistent.

**IeuanHa**: The Album that got me into Paramore, I may have a bit of bias towards this one XD

**xxpizzasrlifexx**: imo this is the 2nd best album ever made (after Paramore's Self-Titled). I would have given every song a 10 but I thought it wouldn't be fair to the other albums. This album is great front to back, and there's not a single song I would ever skip.

**whatareblackhole**: I’m kind of a Paramore purist. I don’t really like the sound of this album compared to their previous albums. I understand that their progression toward this “poppier” sound is good for them, but the songs here sound so plastic and formulaic. This album has some of the most honest lyrics Hayley has ever written, but the music doesn’t help to convey these lyrics. However, I absolutely love "Rose-Colored Boy" and "Pool." Those songs should have provided more inspiration than I think they were allowed.

**skomehillet**: 10

**GamblesWithDesire**: The one where I wish I liked this album more as it's way too relevant to me, or, "Strong opening half, mediocre second half, pt.2"

**kappyko**: Let me clarify this: the "happy music"/"sad lyrics" dichotomy is so over-done that it isn't funny. That isn't the appeal of this album to me at all. After Laughter works because the peppiness is warm and real. It's self-loathing. i forgot to finish my comments

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: this album was probably the most difficult to rate for me of these 3. it's so boppy that i often forget to rate the songs and write some commentary to justify my scores

**InfernalSolstice**: This is one of my favorite albums ever probably. I usually can't relate too heavily to the vast majority of songs, but I could really feel Hayley William's experiences and struggles that were poured into this album, and I connect so heavily to the messages. I also really like the blend of traditional instrumentation with synths and electronic sounds, and overall it's just so close to perfect.

**agentofscranton**: After Laughter is easily my favourite album of all time, I don't think another album so perfectly encapsulates who I am as a person than this. Who doesn't love crying as a result of infectious synthpop bops?

**Mysario**: between the powerfully pessimist lyricism and generally upbeat instrumentals, this is one of those albums that always coasts a line of "pretty good" but when it peaks, IT PEAKS

**Carlie:** All hail our overlord Jack Antonoff! I kid, I kid, but you have to admire how Jack both kinda won and lost this rate. He was slaughtered on Day 1, but still ended up being the winner - but with the lowest rated album. Jack brings out all the big guns on DTTM - layered vocals, punchy drums, a banging pre-chorus, a chorus you want to scream out and a Lorde hidden feature. This is my favorite song (of all time) at the moment. It’s a shout for love in a world gone mad. I love it. I love it. I love it.

**Picc:** WE HAVE ANOTHER SLUMBER PARTY!!! Paramore got Melodrama'd, hard. I wanted to give this my 11 so so bad, as it's my true 11 in this rate, but I didn't want to come across as cheating. Thankfully, it didn't need it! DTTM is absolutely euphoric to listen to, whether it's the studio version or live.

---
**\_wailordfan** (11): Ugh I love this song so much, and I love how it kind of became the recurring theme in this album (Good job Jack, pick the best song to reference throughout the album!)

**animefangrant62** (11): Not only is this song from the worst album in the rate, but it's about Lena "I'm sorry but insert excuse here" Dunham. But I can't deny it's sheer, raw pop FORCE. It's awe inspiring and confirmed jackoff as one of the greatest men alive. I love you jackoff.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): For my 11 I was stuck between this song and '26' for nearly a month. Both have similar themes of hopefulness in spite of hardships and both portray them amazingly. I love both near equally so I don't want to exactly say this one 'won out', but in my case it's had a slightly larger influence on my life which is why it gets the 11 instead.

**frogaranaman** (11): Ariana took one listen to this song then dipped on Pete.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): it good

**InfernalSolstice** (11): 2017 song of the year for me (besides kesha), the entire song is a hook, his vocals are better than ever before, the lorde appearance is expertly placed, the songwriting is great, the production is wonderful, and just UGH what a moment

**InternetDude19** (11): Pop perfection.

**jamesfog** (11): This is a perfect and timeless song. He and Lorde snapped.

**NapsAndNetflix** (11): this is the best song in the rate

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): I can't stop myself from SCREAMING the chorus every time

**skargardin** (11): He and miss Ella snapped big time with this one. This is what a winner sounds like.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Lorde on the last chorus is just great. The Unplugged version of this, which is basically just Lorde covering the song is great to, though that's beside the point. Jack's good too. Probably my favorite of Bleachers' singles.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): I CUT OFF MY T SHIRT SLEEVES AND CLAIMED A NEW CONTINENT this song is literally the closest thing the 2010s will ever have to recreating the feeling of synthpop brilliance and every time I listen to it I just can’t get over how much this song sounds like speeding down a highway with only a suitcase in tow off to god knows where. The production is just so absolutely incredible it would already warrant an 11 but on top of that Jack and Lorde give us some of the best lyrics of 2017: a stunning sheen of internal rhyme smattered with wit and wistful yearning. And even that would be enough to get my ass on the dancefloor, but then Jack outdoes himself with some of the best delivery he’s given us yet. Everything works in perfect harmony and this song just feels like a fucking journey that I am packing my bags for right now.

**1998tweety** (10): This is good, the lyrics feel a lot more impactful in this track compared to their other songs. It bops too.

**agentofscranton** (10): ugh what a phenomenal song it's unfortunate that this was up against after laughter because this would get my 11 in literally any other matchup

**ExtraEater** (10): good title

**fourchip** (10): i really expected this to be the only good song on the album but i was pleasantly surprised

**GamblesWithDesire** (10): One of the best pop songs of recent times tbh

**hikkaru** (10): this is so fucking ANTHEMIC i want to SCREAM

**kappyko** (10): I grew out of my hatred for Antonoff's work on other records after a year of confusion throughout 2017 as I realized he was pretty decent at his job. It took me much longer to get into Bleachers because I didn't want to endorse his rather self-mythologizing personality that pops up ever so often, but a song like this might just earn him all the praise he gets. I think there's a weird thing with his John Hughes worship where he seems to interpret them as cinematic, epic works of art. I watched two of them and really appreciated the dated-ness of the films but I wasn't enamored. They're just funny, tacky teen comedies with an edge. Antonoff's guitars and synths aren't tacky at all here: they sound dramatic and lush. Lorde and Antonoff's shared bridge is probably more intense than any bridge from a real '80s hit. He re-contextualizes '80s associated sounds (along with some of his own ideas: the second pre-chorus is just awesome in its percussion-led oddity) on "Don't Take the Money" into something great. Who cares about what "don't take the money" even means? When a chorus like this starts with such a huge swell and crash, "you steal the air out of my lungs, you make me feel it" delivered with such conviction, there's nothing else to call it except breathtaking.

**Mysario** (10): I'm lying to myself by singing along to this, I'll gladly take whatever money is offered to me

**rosesmp3** (10): i love how anthemic this is, that chorus!

**rotating3Dtext** (10): i hear my wife Lorde on the last chorus

**strawberryswing1** (10): fuck me up Lorde

**tapdancingpig** (10): Actually.. this is pretty great. Lorde and Jack are one of my songwriting dream team s, so I was thrilled to see that they did this together. I always like sonic landscapes that perfectly reflect the lyrics, and the mix of euphoria and darkness is kind of perfect.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): lOrDe sHoUlD've hAd a BiggEr pArT

**TulilpWaffles** (10): This song sounds like what love feels like to me, it always puts me in a good mood when I hear it.

**twat\_brained** (10): WILL WE FIGHT STAY UP LATE IN MY DREAMS ON THE PLANE and all that good shit. The trisyllabic lyrics in the pre-chorus are the glue that really holds this masterpiece together. MORE IMPORTANTLY HOLY FUCK I HEAR ELLA SINGING BACKGROUND VOCALS NEAR THE END! IT SOUNDS SO FUCKING GOOD WHAT THE FUCK! I NEED TO HEAR JACK AND ELLA PERFORM THIS LIVE TOGETHER

**vhqv1997** (10): A lot of people are just gonna comment on Lorde's involvement in this song, but I just wanna point out that Jack sounds really good in this and the production is superb too

**ChaseLights** (9): This is an excellent bop. Sounds like a reject from Carly's E-MO-TION and as we all should know, that's never a bad thing.

**extrasmallbillie** (9): : Remember life before we had that surprise Lorde feature? Yeah me either.

**rosecoloreds** (9): i'd give it a 10 if it weren't abt lena dunham

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8.9): this is the best song on the album

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Fun instrumentation, great chorus, I love the harmonizing vocals from who I believe is Lorde, though I wish the song ended a little differently than the slow fade out. There are a few production issues I have in some of the pre-chorus stuff but it's not glaring and this was probably the first song I really fell in love with on this album.

**Raykel** (7.8): It's good but I don't really get the hype

**awryj** (7.5): i tried to love this song but i just kinda don't. it's good tho

**IeuanHa** (7): another fun tune

**over9000skeletons** (2): AND I THOUGHT THE LAST ONE WAS BAD. i sat through a pvris album for this\???

Piccprincess: # Gone Now

---

**Overall average**: 7.283

---

**TragicKingdom1**: Bleachers are amazing and capture an acute sense of nostalgia in their production with every song, in addition to serving bops. This isn't as good as Strange Desire, but it's a tight experience that doesn't have a low point. Paramore will probably do the best in the rate but I feel like this album is an artistic achievement that deserves to be celebrated on the level of the sub's most beloved albums of the past few years. [Grade: A]

**Leixander**: Not as bad as i thought it would be, has few duds though. A consistent album.

**ExtraEater**: good album title

**InternetDude19**: One of my favorite albums. I fell in love with it while I was on a trip to Italy, and know every time I listen to it, I'm taken back there. I have a lot of really good memories of this album.

**IeuanHa**: Likely suffered a bit in my ranking, as I didn't know of Bleachers' music before this rate

**xxpizzasrlifexx**: My least favourite of the 3 albums in this rate, but I still really enjoyed it.

**whatareblackhole**: Bleachers has always been so remarkably hit or miss for me. Their first album, Strange Desire, has some incredible songs, but some really bad ones, too. Gone Now is no different. There are some great moments here - looking at you, "Don't Take the Money" - but there are also some weird ones, moments where the experimentation doesn't pay off ("Foreign Girls"). I love the repeated themes and the sound and Jack's voice, but overall, Gone Now doesn't do much for me.

**skomehillet**: 7.5

**GamblesWithDesire**: The one where Jack and his boner for vocal samples increases to level 2, or, "strong opening half, mediocre second half pt.1"

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: fuck me Jack Antonoff

**InfernalSolstice**: This is a wildly inconsistent album, it has some truly fantastic standouts, mostly the singles, but the deep cuts all range from aggressively mediocre to just straight up bad.

**Mysario**: this faux concept album feels like a lot of good one riff ideas that nobody else wanted or knew what to do with but were fleshed out to be full tracks anyways in hopes something would land and sometimes, it does

**twat\_brained**: I think I listened to Some Nights once or twice so
