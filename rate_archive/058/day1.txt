Moody 2017 Band Rate Reveal, Day 1: And I Gotta Get To Rock Bottom!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ahdokr/moody_2017_band_rate_reveal_day_1_and_i_gotta_get/

Happy Friday!

Gonna keep this short so we can get into it quickly and not worry about any crazy details ~~really I'm just at work and trying not to get caught on reddit oop.~~ 

###Here is our full [list of our **68 participants**!](https://pastebin.com/pHmnDqnh)

Some fun facts!

* Today we will be starting at 3 pm EST /  8 pm GMT
* We will be revealing #34 - #23 of the main rate, and #12 - #9 from the bonus rate
* Paramore had every single song receive an 11!! Amazing how the stans showed up to fight! Both Pvris and Bleachers had five songs receiving an 11. A good showing all around.
* The average total score was **x**
* The average controversy score was **x**

Fun facts about our hosts:

* /u/piccprincess loves to shill PVRIS so much that she tried to say they had six songs receiving 11s instead of five. Apparently bis can't count!
* /u/carliescion is [prone to typos](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/505119825052434432/535845429959720978/Skjermbilde_2019-01-17_kl.png), so please excuse any that may come along tonight.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): not really a Bleachers fan, not really a Grimes fan, but this is lovely

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Grimes’ scream makes my pussy moist

**vhqv1997** (9): I was wondering why this song didn't really sound like Grimes and then she screamed

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Strange Desire is full of bops and I am glad it is getting recognition

**InternetDude19** (6.5): I think this is the weakest song on Strange Desire.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): Grimes detracts from this

**IeuanHa** (6): I mean its OK, but kinda mediocre to me

**frogaranaman** (5): This had no substance at all.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): I'm not a fan of Grimes voice at all, so there's that, but the song also doesn't feel like it really goes anywhere

**Leixander** (5): grimes? where?

**lilguavachan** (2): i just... don't like her at all

**Carlie:** Now, this song is what you can call a tiny bit controversial. You either love it or you hate it, and in this rate the “hate it”-group definitely won. Lots of people complained about not being able to hear the lyrics (which are basically a bunch of references to old Paramore tracks) This was battling for the bottom spot the entire rate. Personally, I really like this track. It sounds like a panic attack, it sounds like anxiety - and it really works in the context of the album, especially paired with Idle Worship. The ending lines really get to me - “In any case please let me know if there's more I can give you. If nothing comes of it, then just know we are grateful”

**Picc:** I have no words for this so honestly I'm just going to drop [this screenshot](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/333403698262966284/535847799586291752/Screen_Shot_2019-01-18_at_10.47.43_AM.png) of the moment I listened to this mumbled weirdness. Also McIggly can we still be friends I'm sorry!!!!

###Friends

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (11): Just like Future off of the self titled album Paramore took a huge risk and attempted something that was different than the vibe of the rest of the album. Instead of channeling post rock they went and channeled some post hardcore. Even employing Aaron Weiss of post hardcore band mewithoutYou to deliver the spoken word lyrics. It isn't just the song itself, it's the song in the context of the album. It reflects on the themes found in Idle Worship, even being slightly ironic by being "sung" by Hayley's musical idol. And it is just the chaos needed before Tell Me How. The inclusion of this song just overall strengthens the run of songs it is found in the middle of.

**over9000skeletons** (11): SO GOOD it just is amazing???????

**ReallyCreative** (10): This song does exactly what it sets out to do, which is an instant high mark for me. This song is creepy, disconcerting, and captures so many emotions so well. I love how it closes too, spoken word songs are often times some of my favorite just because of how challenging they can be and how bold of a choice they can be. This one is just fantastic on a number of levels.

**strawberryswing1** (10): kinda groundbreaking

**Mysario** (9): I can see how many people will drag this song. But there's a lot of things I can't NOT appreciate about it! First off, the entire song is "sung" by Aaron Weiss of mewithoutyou, a band that Hayley Williams has been a HUGE fan of since the early Paramore days. It's the first and only time Hayley has taken a sidestep as the lead since the band started for this momentous occasion. Aaron weaves in all these seamless references from Paramore's past work to make a story of the band and its possible future. And of course, the instrumental work is on point. It's not a pop track by any means but it's a beautiful song either way

**awryj** (8): of course im not gonna listen to this on its own but it fits the album

**rosecoloreds** (8): i could write an essay abt why ppl underappreciate this song

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): This is a late album hidden gem

**vhqv1997** (8): I feel the vocal is the backing track to instrumentation here. I'm not gonna lie, I was super weirded out when I first heard it but now I'm kinda into it. It's certainly a breath of fresh air and the lyrics are incredible

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Is this supposed to be a concert interlude? Is it essentially just Zac screaming into the mic? What's he even screaming about? Is Zac possessed? I'm sorry but I really don't get this. Is this his Hobo Johnson impersonation? Not sure what to make of it. It's got the After Laughter sonud but it's just so anomalous.

**ChaseLights** (7.4): which seamlessly flows from Idle Worship and I even like the message here, but what I don't like is that in order to get the message I had to scour for lyrics because the vocals are buried underneath the melody. I know that's a stylistic choice but a lot of the vocals are inaudible.

**frogaranaman** (7): Stan twitter should, uh, definitely listen to and fully understand the lyrics to this song. Just sayin’.

**kappyko** (7): Literally indie rock

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7): at first i was like “why”, but this works and is a unique approach for the band where for the first time ever, it’s the only song not to feature Hayley as lead vocals

**skomehillet** (7): They mixed the vocals low on PURPOSE!!! You hear something new every time!! IT’s sUPPOSED TO SOUND LIKE THAT

**LandonKidatrea** (6): this was cool

###Consider breaking off the toxic friendship, will you?

**InfernalSolstice** (6): i get what they were going for but ehhhhh

**IeuanHa** (5): this song was in my mind killed by the mixing, I know its meant to be drowned out, but half the time I just can't hear it. It did get me into mewithoutYou though ;)

**tapdancingpig** (5): I don’t know how to react to this, so I’m giving it the most “mixed to undecided score” I could think of.

**hikkaru** (4): oof

**InternetDude19** (4): I don't mind the idea, but it just doesn't work that well. I think the mix is too

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): Why is this so long

**1998tweety** (2): Ok so I get that this song is supposed to be pretty different and that the lyrics are the bulk of the song considering the instrumental stays consistent, which I don't really have an issue with except that I can't hear any of the lyrics. If you want to make a song which relies super heavily on the lyrics, the listener needs to be able to hear them.

**TragicKingdom1** (2): boring and a risk that doesn't pay off

**\_wailordfan** (0): K, I get it, but it doesn't mean I have to like it.

**BearlyEvenAPun** (0): I end up skipping this any time I listen to the album. Maybe I wouldn't feel as strongly if this was on another album, but it just throws me off whenever it comes on.

**GamblesWithDesire** (0): I shouldn't have to read a lyric book to understand an interlude that's 3 minutes too long andu/McIgglyTuffMuffin can @ me on that

**jamesfog** (0): I don't like the male vocals.

**NapsAndNetflix** (0): this is the worst song in the rate

**SinfulAnarchy** (0): wtf is this

**static\_int\_husp** (0): not really a fan of this style of interlude

**TulilpWaffles** (0): At this point I think the album is kind of starting to drag, so to include a muffled spoken word track near the end was a bad choice, in my opinion.

###Just...Why?

**Leixander** (6): cupcakke quiz voice how? how? how? how?

=====

Leixander: Standard deviation, you can think of it as a display of how the scores vary. A controversial song would have many varying scores(like No Friend, who got 2 11s and 9 0s) while an uncontroversial song would receive similar scores(between 10-7 for example).
[/r/popheads/comments/ahdokr/moody_2017_band_rate_reveal_day_1_and_i_gotta_get/eedrt2r/]

=====

mirandacrocsgrove: it's simply the standard deviation of how controversial or how divided people are on rating a song

the hosts publish an average controversy score. if the song has a higher controversy score than the one published, well it's controversial; if it's pretty low, the rate participants seemed to agree on a certain score

**Carlie:** So, I guess we’re saying Goodbye to this pretty early. This song was always near the bottom, but this is actually its lowest position. Essentially a reprise to Goodmorning, most people felt like this song was necessary or too long. Following the storyline that Goodmorning is Jack waking up, this is the song where he goes to bed. Have a good sleep, Jack.

**Picc:** It's kind of a shame that this song is going out so early. I don't even remember what I gave it, but I really disgustingly love how chill the depressive vibe of this is. Let me just say goodbye to everyone too Jack and let it all go.

###I cannot tell if these positive scores are even positive so here's one giant category

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): do you ever feel like disappearing without a trace? oftentimes, i do. no, not necessarily killing myself, but just being gone. idk where im going with this but yeah i even bought a book that's simply titled 'How to Disappear' lmao

**skomehillet** (9): I found the autotune (and L***’s monologue) unnecessary here. Otherwise, the melodies work really well with the beat and I love the looping, melodic “Lend me a favor” throughout as well.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): warms my heart and makes me sad at the same time

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Francis and the Lights jumped out

**vhqv1997** (8): Is this Bon Iver?

**1998tweety** (7): Why do they keep trying to do weird stuff? Just serve me bops or cute ballads please.

**ReallyCreative** (6.8): Jack loves his reprises, and while I'm normally all about callbacks, this one doesn't do it for me. I love the way the song starts, but it's just TOO busy and disjointed. This song is just kind of there and it doesn't really add anything in my opinion. It's a different sound and beat than what we're used to hearing on this album but I think it just don't think it's fleshed out.

**InternetDude19** (6.5): I don't understand why this is here.

**frogaranaman** (6): It reminds me of something I’d expect from a low-fi hip hop chill anime beats to study and listen to album.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): The end of act 1 in Jack's mental musical

**hikkaru** (6): goodbye to this song

**IeuanHa** (6): It's a solidly ok song in my head, held up from a low rate by the instrumental in my opinion

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (5.5): A cute lil reprise. Could be shorter though.

**ChaseLights** (5.3): Jack-off, you're not Thom Yorke. Jesus. Is that Lena's god-awful pseudo shit in the background? You've gone right down in my estimations.

**tapdancingpig** (5): This is cute, but NO HIGH SCORES FOR LENA FUCKING DUNHAM

**Raykel** (4): Just saying goodbye for 3 mins with a boring melody

**twat\_brained** (4): This sounds like a lousy "The Life of Pablo" reject. I don't like to be reminded of the existence of that album's artist.

**animefangrant62** (1): this song is embarassing for everyone involved it almost makes me forget that jackoff produced out of the woods

**InfernalSolstice** (0): my one hope is that this would be better than goodmorning, and somehow that didn't happen. the autotune sounds awful, it's way too repetitive, and it's like a conclusion track that may work when considering an overlying concept but doesn't work in practice whatsoever

**kappyko** (0): His mumbled delivery is kind of obnoxious. It sounds like something that I would rag on Bearface from BROCKHAMPTON for singing. I'm not sure what a song like this means for the narrative of the album or what it's doing in the middle of the record, but right now it's an interlude too chirpy for its own good. Potentially *Coloring Book* inspired horns near the end save it from terrible, but his falsetto isn't sweet like Chance's endearingly awkward singing.

**Carlie:** Not a good day for Bleachers reprises, huh? The first half of this song sounds like country and jazz had an alternative baby. A call back to I’m Ready To Move On/Wild Heart Reprise on Strange Desire, people mostly felt like this song was too long.

**Picc:** Y'all need the lorde and savior Jesus Christ. smh.

---

###So Nostalgic, It Must Be the Beatles

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the “I’m Ready to Move On” from Bleacher’s prior album had the legendary Yoko Ono, while she doesn’t make a re-appearance for this album, it still kind of represents the ending in a perfect way. this song represents how Jack carries his sister’s memory daily as if it’s a vital part of his every day life.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): The "I wanna be grateful" sample feels so nostalgic from Strange Desire lol I love it.

**static\_int\_husp** (8): The first half sounds weirdly like a Beatles song to me. The second half is a decent reprise of the intro.

**strawberryswing1** (6.5): a cute message

###This Reprise Sucks Squad^^^^TM

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): I actually love the way this song begins, and almost wish Jack would just commit to making a country-boy song and keeping it at that. I don't love the transition into what I feel is the TRUE reprise to Goodmorning, and it really takes away from two pretty great pieces of this song.

**InternetDude19** (7): I kind of wish that this wasn't a reprise. I liked what I was hearing on the first half.

**InfernalSolstice** (6.5): i'm ready to move on was too long but the mickey mantle reprise is really nice

**tapdancingpig** (6): Who shoehorned these two songs together?

**twat\_brained** (4.7): Oh my goodness that has to be one of the most underwhelming key changes ever. Also why the hell would you rip off "Goodbye My Lover" by James Blunt? I think I've come to the realization I don't get Jack Antonoff, nor do I think I ever will.

###Literally Just Read My Comment

**Mysario** (7): my favourite part of this song is the keys clicking you can hear like 50 seconds in

**1998tweety** (6): Everything about this feels like a mess except for the trumpets. Did not enjoy the song at all.

**skomehillet** (6): Nothing like some t r a p h a t s on a beat to give it some flavor

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I’m not sure what this is but I think I like it? Some of it works more than others - the trap section is really weird but the voiceovers are pretty powerful. It’s kinda a mess, but it’s an interesting one.

**awryj** (4): those trap drums were a choice

**frogaranaman** (4): This was a severe dip in quality.

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): This one goes on way too long and the orgy of voice lines at the end was a choice

**IeuanHa** (4): just kinda annoys me, I have no idea why

**hikkaru** (3): Songs that are two-in-one are already an uphill battle for me because I feel they often just sacrifice quality of one or the other in order to combine them for no reason... so I'm Ready to Move On being like really fucking annoying in its production, me not liking Jack's voice through all of it, and the choppy speech samples near the end that are weird to listen to all combine into just a Not Good song imo

**animefangrant62** (2): what is this

**kappyko** (2): Potentially the weirdest song on the album so far, starting off with a mix of "When I'm Sixty-Four" and "Wild Honey Pie", then into some weird clunk-pop with some questionable mixing of a right channel saxophone. Antonoff then gives listeners the worst blue balls of all time by teasing one of the best songs on the album ("Dream of Mickey Mantle") before descending into a trap-pop remix of the worst song on the album ("Goodbye"). Why wasn't this titled "Goodbye Reprise"? It's too messy to embrace.

**ChaseLights** (0): You just...you really couldn't help yourself, could you?

You might ask; where is Lynn Gunn on this? So. We kinda fucked up with this track. We linked the original (non-PVRIS) version of this song. So I think a lot of people who rated this, did not rate the intended track. Oh, well.

---
**frogaranaman** (10): Wow, this snatched me so hard.

**IeuanHa** (9): I particularly like this, I think that the 2 bands play very well together

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Solid Circa Waves track

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): It's okay but I'm not a fan of the guy's voice, which hinges a bit too whiny for me, and Lynn is a bit too mumbly for her to save it

**Carlie:**King of vocal processing! Foreign Girls spent most of the rate in the bottom 2, but got dragged up to 31 at the very last moment. This song sounds almost like a suicide note, talking about depression and locking yourself away from people. It ends on the lyric «I loved you all», which makes me kinda wanna cry.

**Picc:** What I love about Jack is that he has a great appreciation for so many musicians and he really lets the trumpet shine through. Are my music degrees quaking? Possibly.

---
###Mysario (10): this is a great closer and it reminds me that I know I've been a stranger lately <span class="emoji-outer emoji-sizer"><span class="emoji-inner" style="background: url(chrome-extension://immhpnclomdloikkpcefncmfgjbkojmh/emoji-data/sheet_apple_32.png);background-position:46.00470035252644% 99.94124559341951%;background-size:5418.75% 5418.75%" data-codepoints="1f483"></span></span><span class="emoji-outer emoji-sizer"><span class="emoji-inner" style="background: url(chrome-extension://immhpnclomdloikkpcefncmfgjbkojmh/emoji-data/sheet_apple_32.png);background-position:59.9882491186839% 97.94359576968273%;background-size:5418.75% 5418.75%" data-codepoints="1f614"></span></span><span class="emoji-outer emoji-sizer"><span class="emoji-inner" style="background: url(chrome-extension://immhpnclomdloikkpcefncmfgjbkojmh/emoji-data/sheet_apple_32.png);background-position:46.00470035252644% 99.94124559341951%;background-size:5418.75% 5418.75%" data-codepoints="1f483"></span></span>

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): the perfect song and lyrics to end an album. after experiencing the wave of trauma endured by the artist, ending the album with a song that features the lyrics “i loved you all” in the last line makes him and me feel like a new person; i lost something, but i gotta keep moving, while not burying everything i’ve learned behind.

**vhqv1997** (10): This song makes me miss fun.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): This is a complete mess of incoherent ideas put together that somehow really works for me, which can be said for a lot of Bleachers work.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): The chorus is really, really good again

**InfernalSolstice** (7.5): the production on this was really weird but the vocals are delightful (outside of the weird pitched parts) and the songwriting was strong

**InternetDude19** (7.5): A satisfying conclusion.

**1998tweety** (7.2): This track has some more weird vocals and autotune but it doesn't bother as much as the other tracks. Works as a good closer though.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (7): the simple lyrics kinda work here. I don't really get the title though. someone smarter than me, explain!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Listens to 22 A Million once

**\_wailordfan** (6.5): what a really weird choice for an album closer

**Leixander** (6.5): :help:

**twat\_brained** (6.5): And so concludes the album. I don't remember any lyrics apart from "I know I've been a stranger lately". In fact, I don't think I'll remember anything from this album apart from LGM or DTTM. Maybe fun. ought to reunite.

**frogaranaman** (6): Sure?

**strawberryswing1** (6): another cute message

**ChaseLights** (5.6): Sounds like a fun reject...but a reject you didn't really want.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): This song is a real black sheep on this album, I don't really understand why it's on the album at all, especially after what would have been a perfectly great ending in the reprise.

**rosesmp3** (5): the vocal effect/editing on the verses was a choice and not one that i'm a fan of tbh

**WilsonJason** (5): A pretty disappointing end to an otherwise really good album.

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): It's like he couldn't decide whether this or Move On/Reprise would be the album closer, so he put them both on here and it's like shooting an unimpressive load twice

**hikkaru** (4): oh LORD I did NOT ask for Jack's autotuned squeaky falsetto, nor did I ask for my left ear to be attacked AGAIN with that squealing trumpet thing... but the choir-esque bit is nice

**kappyko** (3): The original concept of "Foreign Girls" was some sort of weird romanticization of the mysteriousness of girls from foreign countries; basically "Talk Dirty" for art hoes. Luckily, the title of the song has little to do with the content, and instead we are treated to Antonoff's idea of the victory lap. Obvious Bon Iver/James Blake auto-tuned nonsense, but without any of the emotional gravitas of the former or any of the classy post-bass production of the latter. A really disappointing ending to an album that ended up barely delivering on its promises of something great.

**animefangrant62** (1): what is this [2]

**TulilpWaffles** (1): I'm ready to move on is a perfect album closer, I don't understand why this song even exsists at this point in the album. I also really hate the auto-tune in the beginning

**awryj** (0): The Autotuned falsetto and the trumpet made me experience a seizure and a heart attack. Then the muffled voices in the outro happened and I died. Do not recommend.

**IeuanHa** (0): God I just find the vocals and instrumental in the opening here to be horrendous

**Carlie:** Jack said this was the sequel to I Wanna Get Better (even tho they sound nothing alike) «“All My Heroes,” to me, is like the adult version. It’s the “I Wanna Get Better” that you scream out in the real world when you’re on your own». My issue with this song is that the vocals and instrumentals blend too much together, making it hard to make it out what he’s actually singing.

**Picc:** Honestly I expected this go out so early, but I'm still sad. 

---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (11): This song will probably be out early, but this means so much to me. The way I listen to this album, is it’s as if I’m already gone. Gone now. This album came out in 2017 and it has been on-repeat and has quite been my intangible friend. A lot of times, I imagine myself as dead already. How does the world continue without me? My family will experience a moment of grief, but they will eventually get over it. How is it like to disappear for eternity? Sometimes, I feel like the people whom I should confide into even feel like they already gave up on me, or if I’m facing the harsh reality, none of them bothers to dig deep into what I’m actually trying to express. “All My Heroes” hits home when I feel like I have no one in real life to turn into. It sucks, but with a family (or really, a culture) where mental health issues aren’t given serious attention, you can’t help but wonder how long this enduring reality will last and at times, almost frantically and desperately, you’ll want to seek a way out. In some ways though, this song inspires me to do better the shittier things get. At times, maybe all I need is a platform to scream my lungs out.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Ok see here is a time where using a bit of a weird voice works well. Please stick to this over the screaming.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): I think this is probably one of the lowest points on the album, moodwise. It's still beautifully executed.

**ReallyCreative** (8.3): Jack knows how to use echo to make a song interesting, or at least otherwise boring parts interesting enough to stay driving. There's little nit-picky things that I don't super love but the back half of this song is pretty great.

**tapdancingpig** (8): This is a little fragmented, but I think that works in its favor.

**twat\_brained** (7.8): Definitely feels like an improvement over the last one, and it feels like the album's picking up steam again.

**Mysario** (7.5): this "All My Friends" B-side isn't nearly as good

**ChaseLights** (7.4): This song actually builds quite nicely. Good on you, Jack-off!

**hikkaru** (7): jack PLEASE leave my left ear alone

**kappyko** (7): He must have been really excited while writing the "soul does" / "sold us" lines. Half of "All My Heroes" is bare-boned synthpop, the other half is hopeful, messier (in a good way) synthpop right before slipping out into a pretty piano line. The second half's wooziness redeems the slightly plain first half. I'm not sure if I buy the optimism, and I feel this type of song is more of a purifying, self-reflective song than anything else.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): An album track that is a bit more forgotten, but still nice.

**frogaranaman** (5): Eh, forgettable.

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): Not bad, not great, just…there

**InfernalSolstice** (4): i feel blueballed by this song, its like a 3 minute buildup to a climax that never happens

**Leixander** (4): No. OMG no!

**IeuanHa** (3): I cannot stand the repeated tone in this

**skomehillet** (3): Boring enough that I forgot it was on. The synth makes me mad. Just sitting there in the track thinking it sounds good or interesting. Smh.

**Carlie:** Jack has described this track as being about the moment you wake up - where nothing seems quite real, and then reality comes crashing in. This track is short (for a Bleachers track) and sweet. I particularly enjoy Jack’s vocals on this, and the production is really interesting too.

**Picc:** Carlie: *enters some intelligent comment describing the track and why she likes it. Me: ROLLING THUNDER IS MENTIONED MORE THAN ONCE ON THIS ALBUM ALSO I LOVE JACK ANTONOFF

---
**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): ROLLING THUNDER

**vhqv1997** (9): This song is just way too short, I was really getting into the instrumentals and then it just stopped and transitioned into the next song

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): DoMM and this song almost seem redundant but Goodmorning is pretty solid. I really like Jack's vocals and the subtle details he adds throughout the song are always great to catch on repeat listens.

**awryj** (8): def better than the song it... emerged from? it kinda feels like it. a nice effect

**frogaranaman** (8): This feels very cozy to me. Wonderful!

**skomehillet** (7.5): L*** D***** being credited for background vocals will cost this song several points unfortunately

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The opening tune to the Sesame Street Broadway show in Jack's brain

**1998tweety** (6.3): I am not a fan of the weird scream singing thing he's doing.

**twat\_brained** (6): Isn't this just a continuation of Mickey Mantle? Also, I wanna hear the music evenly distributed; not Jack's offkey shouting in my left ear and the pianos in my right. As a subscriber to /r/childfree I immensely disappreciate the wailing baby sounds near the end.

**hikkaru** (5): my left ear is sufficiently stimulated. the choppy production of this song isn't really my favourite thing

**tapdancingpig** (5): I like the production and the songwriting’s cute but... Jack... don’t sing if it’s going to sound like that.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Score playing song through speakers: 7 - Score when playing song through headphones: 3

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (4): I legit thought I had this song on repeat until I realized no it’s just that repetitive

**ChaseLights** (4): I don't...know what's going on here. He needs to stop and he's doing it in both headphones like separately, which is also making things worse for him.

**InfernalSolstice** (3.5): his vocals sound weird on this and did we really need a second intro? mickey mantle was already like perfect

**kappyko** (3): Antonoff's right, this does kind of wake me up a bit. It's pretty sobering to hear this and remember that Antonoff can miss pretty hard. I'm not sure how to improve upon this. Without the over-production, this song wouldn't be as charming as it is now; as is, it's a little too chirpy. Maybe quirky piano rock isn't for him... there's always Ben Folds!

**kyrgyzzephyr** (0): The production is just off-putting, I feel like a small weight is pulling my right ear down.

**McIgglyTuffMuffin** (0): Ultimately the production brings down this song. It's almost a headache to listen to and stopped me from going further the first couple of times I attempted the album when it was released. Jack's use of multi channel mixing is pretty cool in theory, but it just doesn't work for me personally. The lyrics and music just aren't that great either which brings the track down even further for me.

**Carlie:** PVRIS loses their first song! And 2 users lose their 11 - this is truly the rate of differing opinions. This song loses a lot of points by being very weirdly/muddely mixed. At the same time it’s a pretty average track compared to the rest of the great album it’s on.

**Picc:** Don't come for my babies like this!! Lynn is a gay icon, anything under a 6.9 average is unacceptable.

---
**fourchip** (11): idk why this specifically is my 11 since no one i know considers this very good but i love the sound and the lyrics

**leafsnash61** (11): Takes me to a different place, man.

**IndigoAri** (10): Had my poor tearducts working overtime.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is by no means a bad track but it stands out as the worst on the album compared to everything else.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (8): getting real Nick Cave vibes here

**Mysario** (8): filling the spot of the obligatory slow song of the album, it's the "worst" song here but it's still really good soooo

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I hate to say it, but it feels like the album's beginning to taper off. I'm thankful it's happening with one song left.

**InfernalSolstice** (7.5): it's kinda both interesting and boring at the same time idk im confused but it probably wouldn't make any of my playlists so

**IeuanHa** (7): a good song, but can feel a bit lacklustre at times

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This would get a lower score if it wasn’t for that dreamy outro

**vhqv1997** (7): I don't think this song is not good, just that after a streak of incredible tracks there is this whiplash in tone that makes this song unable to impress me

**frogaranaman** (6): Trump is evil.

**hikkaru** (6): A bit of a snoozer compared to the rest of the album

**Raykel** (6): The mixing... I CAN'T HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING LYNN PLS

**InternetDude19** (4.9): I'm getting bored. This just isn't for me.

**awryj** (4): is it just me or is the sound quality awful? i could hear weird artifacts in the vocals, it seems to be overly distorted

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): This song is way too similar to Same Soul, with similar criticisms, and therefore gets the same score

**kappyko** (4): PVRIS embrace their versatility by proving that they, too, can be boring.

**Carlie:** This song gets unfairly shit on because it’s about Lena Dunham. It’s a great love song, being somewhere between a ballad and a bop. This was the last song written and recorded for the album, and it sounds so peaceful, especially compared to the final track of the album. This song is so vulnerable and it makes me FEEL things.

**Picc:** Lena is a sexual abuser but this song is still good I guess

---
**kappyko** (10): Antonoff takes the formula of "All My Heroes"'s balladry into bop and compacts it into something wonderful and more focused. The throb of the outro is climactic, and ultimately Antonoff's neater sensibilities flourish in the environment he sets out for it.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): have you ever looked at your lover and notice every single thing they do and take in every detail of how they do it? No? same.

**1998tweety** (8.8): Another cute ballad.

**ChaseLights** (8.4): You faked me out a bit here! Thought this was a ballad! It's not! I like it a lot though! I used that many exclamation marks because it surprises me.

**ReallyCreative** (7): This song is like so many on this album, "mostly pleasant" but I really only like the outro, and even then I don't know how appropriate it is given the song. It doesn't feel fully fleshed out much in the same way Goodbye doesn't feel fully realized to me.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): A short but sweet track

**twat\_brained** (7): Nothing may be you and it's also what I feel when listening to this song. Jack sounds pretty decent on it though.

**hikkaru** (6): the build up of this song is nice but it's a bit too short and while I really don't like jack's voice, it's at its most grating here imo

**frogaranaman** (5): Wait, what did this song sound like?

**GamblesWithDesire** (5): Would've liked it better if it stayed a solo piano ballad, rather than adding the heavier production in

**InfernalSolstice** (4): his voice combined with his production style isn't really translating well to ballads imo, everything he makes feels like it's supposed to reach some sort of epic moment even when it's not really intended to, like it is here

**Carlie:** On a very depressing album, this song ends on a kind of hopeful note - “But I keep singing”. I’m not sure why this track ended up so low in this rate. It isn’t as high-energy as some of the other songs on this album but it’s still GOOD.

**Picc:** Does popheads hate happiness and hopefulness? Why would this song go out so early? Y'all....

---
**twat\_brained** (9.6): Fantastic closer, it's the perfect song to just put on and just dance around to at a house party with some of your closest mates. At the very least I hope that's the case, I haven't been to anything like that in a few years. But I'm glad PVRIS is able to evoke a semblance of that feeling through their music, at least.

**IndigoAri** (9): Definitely deserves a lot more recognition. Some have commented that the song kind of leaves off with no resolve. I believe the point of it was to show that this was just the beginning of an on going journey, hence the upbeat tune helping leave off on a high note. That's just my take on it. :)

**skomehillet** (9): Excellent closer

**1998tweety** (8.5): Again, a cute bop but it doesn't live up to the previous heights of the album.

**IeuanHa** (7.5): overall a decent closer, but nothing to rave about

**InfernalSolstice** (7): a kind of underwhelming ending to an album full of massive bops

**kappyko** (7): Nice guitar arpeggios and unique production.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): Nomorepartiesinla

**frogaranaman** (6): This song is about granola. I want granola. This yogurt is great but feels incomplete without granola. I can’t eat granola, however, because I will literally become a blood waterfall from my mouth thanks to the removal of my lower wisdom teeth. Give me healing atoms to make me eat granola with my yogurt. Thanks for your support in these trying times.

**GamblesWithDesire** (4): The music in this song deserves better than the lackluster mumbling it's getting

**Carlie:** This is my least favorite song from PVRIS’ album. It feels both quiet and loud at the same time, both muddled and clear - summed up, it’s all over the place. It takes the worst elements from the other songs and spits it out in what ends up being a very confusing track.

**Picc:** I am confusion: **over9000skeletons (2): I love Bebe Rexha!! Had no idea she collabed w Imagine Dragos tho <3 <3**

---
**ChaseLights** (11): THIS IS A GODLY SONG OKAY? The bit where she's basically rapping is so emotion-filled, my throat is sore from the amount of times I scream along to it...I STAY COLD, FEEL THE WEIGHT OF THE WORLD NOW I ALWAYS, ALWAYS WALK ALONE WITHOUT YOU

**1998tweety** (9.6): This is a great way to switch up your album and add some diversity. This song still sounds like it fits on the album but its more distinctive than the ones before which makes the album more enjoyable to listen to.

**InfernalSolstice** (9.5): lynn gunn's vocals fuck me up

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): The vocals are so powerful here, and keep this kinda long slow song from getting stale.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): for a second I thought I was listening to Halsey I’M SORRY

**awryj** (7.8): cute, but i stan harp as an instrument so using it is CHEATING

**twat\_brained** (7.7): It sounds great but I'll admit, I got lost midway through. The outro's pretty good, though.

**IeuanHa** (7.5): Still a decent song, but not quite on par with its predecessors

**skomehillet** (7): When the drums kick in it goes pretty hard

**frogaranaman** (6): This is definitely a live song. Would probably be cathartic to hear live, but in a studio version it’s meddling.

**GamblesWithDesire** (6): It's an okay song, but it goes on for a bit too long and the mumbling is really bad here

**kappyko** (6): Pretty sounds assembled together with little care. This isn't catchy enough, but some harps (by the way, fantastic harp usage throughout the album so far, really unique) throughout the track embellish PVRIS's rage with some niceness, as they ascend in the outro.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Pretty much forgot about this one, probably for a good reason as it’s a bit less punchy and refined as the other tracks.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this does not need to be 5 minutes long

**Carlie:** Yes, even a ‘real’ Paramore track goes out today. Personally, this is one of my favorite tracks on After Laughter and I kinda expected it to at least be in the top 20. Most people felt like this was a filler, possibly because it’s squished between two singles. However, this song feels both hopeful and nostalgic to me and I LOVE IT.

**Picc:** And heeeere's to /u/tragickingdom1, because forgiveness is a nice thing to do.......................

---
**Damoojo** (11): I just really love this song.

**kappyko** (10): forgiving bop

**ReallyCreative** (9): I love how chill this song is, it's a fantastic ballad and one of the slept-on songs off this album. I really love the chorus and Hayley just shines here.

**skomehillet** (9): I find it so fucking dope that Paramore went for an afro-beat influence on this track. Polyrhythms forever.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): scathing words over such a peaceful tune

**ExtraEater** (8.5): underrated

**InfernalSolstice** (8.5): a cute ballad though not as well written as the rest of the album

**twat\_brained** (8.5): Who hurt Hayley so bad she can't forgive them? I hope they're on better terms now

**ChaseLights** (8.4): I think this, 26 and Tell Me How are the only genuine ballads any of these albums have, and as far as ballads go, this is a good one. Not the best one though...see below.

**1998tweety** (8.3): I like this, its soft.

**InternetDude19** (8): For some reason this song reminds my mother of Michael Jackson.

**Leixander** (8): Placement of this song is wrong. Should've been placed near the end, maybe before Tell Me How.

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): The chorus is meh to me and it drags down the solid verses, which blows (also fuck Chad Gilbert thx)

**static\_int\_husp** (7): There's a disparity in tempo between the verses and choruses that kind of throws me off. I like the chrouses better, honestly. Still ok.

**IeuanHa** (6.5): It's a decent song, but sometimes feels a bit skippable to me

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I’m not sure why but I never really dug this track, the instrumental is nice but nothing special.

**frogaranaman** (4): Almost fell asleep to this.

**Carlie:** You thought the Bleachers slaughter was over, didn’t you! However while popheads loves mostly everything Jack produces for our favorite pop girls, we don’t have as kind of a view on his own songs. With this, Jack loses his 10th track of the day (including the bonus rate). That’s a whopping 63.5%. However, I still have a hard-on for Jack and I Love Love Love this intro track. It’s all over the place. It’s about Jack’s first experience of loss - when Mickey Mantle died. Experiencing death or loss is a major theme throughout this record and the transition from this into Goodmorning is sooooooo good.

**Picc:** This is absolutely horrible. Did any of you think that Jack would do so badly the first day? Any of you? Anyone? This is really unforgivable 

---
**franklytheturtle** (11): This song is spritual. It's like something I've heard in my dreams or some vague memory from when I was a kid. It's just pure poetry and I think it shows some of Jacks best writing. It's not something I completely understand but when it gets to the climax I'm always screaming along and I can feel exactly what I struggle to put into words. Amazing opener to an amazing album

**InfernalSolstice** (10): a perfect intro to the album, wonderful instrumental and deceptively catchy

**InternetDude19** (10): This is an excellent intro.

**kappyko** (10): The intro and outro are oddly misplaced, but this definitely gets to the heart of the heartland well. A little pale-skinned, a little awkward, kind of like a kid sitting out a baseball game. But he sure hits a neat home run, especially at the ending of this excellent opener.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I know this song is basically just an intro for the album, but it's way better than it has any right to be. Just a driving beat and a catchy hook are all you need sometimes.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This opener is something I really don’t listen to unless I’m listening to to the album in full and I’m not sure if that means I should listen to this standalone more or just play the entire album more.

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): This song has grown on me in recent months whenever I go back to listen to Gone Now. It's a great intro and I love how the song explodes after a long buildup.

**1998tweety** (8): This song started ok but really grew as it went on.

**frogaranaman** (8): I love how it builds into such a wonderful, bombastic opening. The perfect way to start an album.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): Toni Basil found bankrupt. As an opening track, however, it sadly feels underwhelming.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): i like all of these specific and personal lyrics

**GamblesWithDesire** (7): Solid opener

**Raykel** (7): It's a little all over the place but I see what it was doing

**skomehillet** (7): Sounds like the intro to like, a children’s movie based in the 50s. It’s cute.

**tapdancingpig** (7): This feels underwritten, but it’s also kind of euphoric.

**ChaseLights** (6.8): This is cute but this is kinda bland. This album overall is hit and miss, so this is a struggle for me.

**awryj** (6): a nice opener but somehow it fails to make me excited for what's to come

**strawberryswing1** (6): I had to look up the lyrics to understand what he was saying, I better not see any Bleachers stans (if those exist? lol) insult Ari's pronunciation ever

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (4): An overly long unnecessary prelude to Goodmorning which would make an infinitely better opening track

IeuanHa: Question: what are those graphs meant to actually represent???

Edit 1:Answer because I figured it out myself so nvm lol: it's how the song moved up and down the leader board with each person's score being added

Edit 2: Apparently I was already answered but reddit mobile is bad and didn't show me

CarlieScion: They show how the songs placement changed in time! So for example, when your scores arrived you pushed All My Heroes from #30 down to #31

ImADudeDuh: Bleachers sweetie, I have never been more sorry in my entire LIFE of the level of DISRESPECT popheads handed to you!

hikkaru: It's what Bleachers deserves :kim:

Though I think there's a really strong chance that Don't Take The Money worms its way to #1 after the slaughter, so Jack stans don't lose hope (it would be a great winner)!

deleted: Pvris is doing fine. Bleachers is bombing hard, but... I mean...

And I feel you on 11s getting out early. I think my 11 for the dance pop rate got out on day 3, too (I don’t remember though), and it SUCKED. I’ve kind of adopted a cynical view of giving 11s to deep cuts, even when they deserve it.
