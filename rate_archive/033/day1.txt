Hi gays and homosexuals! Today we're about to find out the worst of the worst of these glorious, divine albums. Who will go out first? St. Vincent? FKA Twigs? Aristophanes? We'll find out at

##4 pm EST!!

OH there'll be poorly-coordinated shitposts in the plug.dj too! [Here's a link to the plug](https://plug.dj/popheads/) I'd love it if you could stop around, especially since there's a couple videos I made myself with my shitty iMovie expertise.

Some additional factoids..

- We had **97** people submit scores for this rate. I can not thank you guys enough. I'm so honored and glad that you gave these three talented women a chance.
- The average average is **7.6287**
- The controversy average is **1.7170**
- The amount of times kappy and i have screamed at your scores/comments is approx. **4,312** times

There'll also be a couple really neat surprises for @everyone to see!! I'm so excited!

annie girl what the actual fuck. this distorted mess was so bad that i wanted to turn it off only a minute in just to preserve my ears. popheads is too pure to be forced to listen to something like that. - **Mudkip1**

Does the meaning behind the already kind of blunt "Digital Witness" get hit over the head repeatedly by this warped remix from the talents of Nicolas Jaar and David Harrington? Yes. Does this still sound kind of fucking absurdly cool to me? Yes! Love the slowed down vocals, and the twisted horns. It's kind of terrifying, and I feel that this is fun twisted glitch pop from a talented bunch.

Did I mainly want it included to hope that it strays some 0s away from my favorite songs in the rate?

Lol yeah - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**FranklyTheTurtle** (4): The vocals would have been cool if they were used sparingly this is nearly unbearable

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (4): this terrified me. I can’t imagine anyone saying this is actually good.

**monalisafrank** (4): i don't think i would ever listen to this

**MrSwearword** (4): poor remix but it is a “dark side”.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): this is like sophie but bad

**whatareblackhole** (4): TRASH

**Raykel** (3.5): What good has a remix ever done? An original song that most likely would've been better could've been on this tracklist instead.

**bluehxrizon** (3): all they did was mess up and mute the saxophones which were the best part of the song. also the vocal warping is not cute

**SAlNTJUDE** (3): this wasn't necessary

**AFlyingWhale\_** (2): you took a perfectly good song and fucked it up, that's what you did

**BiPolarBear17** (2): who asked for this?

**Kaylaboe** (2): no. throw this remix out the window

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): I was just gonna comment "a song" but I'm not ever sure if this qualifies as one.

**therokinrolla** (2): what the fuck

**zamomattel** (2): this is 2 darksided for me

**letsallpoo** (1): why

**rickikardashian** (1): ………...no

**zenits** (1): shite

**camirose** (0): wtf it’s like someone took digital witness and put it through an audio shredder, burned it on a CD, and then violently scratched it

**eklxtreme** (0): what the hell did they do to this song. it's like they .magik'd it 10 times.

**Masta-Blasta** (0): Why did you make me spend 4:21 minutes of my life listening to this, mods..

**MaydayPvZ** (0): How did this even get on the deluxe version, it sounds like one of the pitchy male versions of songs on youtube but on slow-mo.

**melodyllic\_** (0): sorry annie but what is this trash

**theburningundead** (0): People turn the TV on but I want to turn this song off immediately

Mudkip1: #plEASE READ THIS

hi! thank u for tuning in, i'm really humbled and thankful for the support and i'm so glad you could be here <3

FIRST THINGS FIRST, ~~i'm the realest~~ there's a few things I'd like to touch on before we continue, since I'm doing a couple fun, new things this time around and I wanna be sure people are aware since I spent a shit ton of time on it all, lol.

1. **Song images**!!!!!!!!! I spent way too long making these images for each song and I am really proud of them and want people to see them cause they're cute, lol.  
**If you have RES** then I know you can just click the little button to the right of the link and the image will drop down. These were uploaded to imgur, and  
**if you scroll down with the image open** then you'll see that I added everyone's comments here.  
I hand selected my favorite comments and included them on the main post, the rest can all be viewed by opening the imgur image. If I laughed at your comment or thought your comment was informative/clever then I probably kept it here. I also kept everyone's comments if you gave the song a 0 or 11. Please don't feel bad if yours wasn't chosen for a certain song, cause there's 48 songs so I'm 99% positive that you'll have a couple featured at some point during the rate.

2. So the lovely /u/berober04 slayed my bussy and helped me make gifs for the rate. I want this rate to be as fun and memey as possible so what better way to do so than to be able to spam gifs?  
**The command to type out a gif is**  
`[](#annie)`  
There are 3 gifs you can choose from, one from each artist. The names for each are pretty easy to guess but if you can't then I'll be revealing the other two in a sec.  
**Please don't abuse this feature.** lol. I'm not sure if there's a limit to how many times this can be done in each post or not so keep it limited to maybe something like 3 or 4 per comment? If things go well today then feel free to spam harder on Day 2 or 3.

#AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA  &nbsp; [](#grimes)

#*AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA*  &nbsp; [](#grimes)

"Scream" is a track that's honestly quite dear to my heart based on just how much cool it oozes out. A little-known Taiwanese rapper over a vicious movie trailer punk guitar? With Grimes screaming bloody murder after every verse? It's amazing and probably some of the most fun shit on the record. It's abrasive, it's crazy, and it's unabashedly so *rebellious*. This was actually the third track, after "Flesh Without Blood" and "Life in the Vivid Dream" being revealed in their video, to be revealed from the record. It's a statement that made sure that anybody who was familiar with Grimes before that this record would be *different*. Gone were the days of pretty synth melodies and cryptic aesthetics; Grimes is fucking insane now. - **kappyko**

I literally can't even stomach this god-awful song I skip it everytime. - **Mudkip1**

**HalfAlienRobot** (11): this is the kind of sex i want to have

**Raykel** (11): I love the screams in the chorus, it's so cathartic. The verses weirded me out at first but now I love them for how daring they are. And as weird as it sounds, for some reason when I hear this song I imagine this beautiful landscape that's almost exactly like Mad Max: Fury Road with all the blues and sunset oranges.

**chipsi1** (10): Aristophanes is a better writer than Taylor Swift

**Kaylaboe** (10): yas taiwanese rap. i love the wildwestern-y vibe of the guitar, and this track is just so intense

**zenits** (10): 太好了

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.9): anyone who hates this song is UGLY! also this goes the absolute fuck off live!

**robbiec\_** (9): realistically this song is a seven but the fucking drum programming is insane and introducing a new artist on the second song on your album where you have to prove yourself and it's fucking fire is. a. flex.

**whatareblackhole** (9): I’m honestly always here for screaming over a beat

**booooam** (8): i don't know if it's Stockholm syndrome but this is actually really good altthough it shouldn't be?

**eklxtreme** (7.5): I've seen her perform this live and my life has never been the same. wildest high experience ever.

**banananaise** (7): my theory is that this is a message from the future about what all pop music will sound like once China buys our digitized souls and forces all main pop girls to become nuns for the state cult of Xi Jinping Thought

**ExtraEater** (7): If Grimes represents our ‘post-genre’ future perhaps her greatest achievement is the reconciliation between the Romantic – her mercurial voice, her melodies, her airy strings, the album cover – with the Classical – her methods, her synthesisers, her sublimation of art to technology. A post-modern masterwork

**rickikardashian** (6.5): she’s… literally screaming….. aight

**nooodisaster** (6): omelette du fromage

**stansymash (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S88Oy2FILCw**

**bluehxrizon** (5): how do i even score this

**MrSwearword** (5): the beat is pretty cool but she sounds like Sky Ferreira on acid.

**camirose** (4): this isn’t something I’d ever listen to but reading the lyric translation was a wild ride

**AFlyingWhale\_** (2): /u/letsallpoo: grimes could fart into a mic for 2 minutes

**bbfan132** (2): this sounds like the orgasm of a mythical japanese unicorn-wolf-human hybrid

**dirdbub** (0): I feel like I'm listening to Boku no Pico de Gallo but they're being murdered, this is uncomfortable

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (0): I get it. I’ve read through the lyrics in English. I get why Grimes would include this on the album. But unfortunately, this track is absolute ass. It’s both too uncomfortable to make sense where it is in the tracklisting and yet too weak to be a truly discomforting and raw track. It feels like it’s being held back from doing a shred of what it’s supposed to do, and the result is a laughable, ridiculous inclusion that seems like a pale imposter of something like Pharmakon.

**therokinrolla** (0): fuck no

I don't like this one, lol. Probably should've just let kappy write it instead since he gave it a higher score but oh well. I find Sparrow to be incredibly underwhelming and a little bit grating. She has cute lyrics about living your life regardless of what's going on around you, though, so it's not a total flop. - **Mudkip1**

I forgot why I gave this a score higher than 5. It's a decent track for its purpose, an exercise in atmosphere, but it's simply not good enough to justify going too far. I understand why this didn't go any farther than it did. - **kappyko**

An ASMR legend! She could whisper in my ears all day. I love the eerie buildup throughout the song leading up to her robotic moaning and then it just continues to build up. I'm assuming it's a metaphor for sex and maybe something to do with capitalism (???) but maybe not. I didn't look up the meaning behind it or anything. - **Mudkip1**

**melodyllic\_** (5): [insert pun about this being a weak spot in twigs' discography] but really what is this track?? i feel like this should have been an intro or something, bc it creates such an unsettling atmosphere

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): is this the whisper song by the yin yang twins

**Masta-Blasta** (4): It’s like even she realized it was a shit song, hence the title.

**shineflyer** (4): is she singing into one of those toy microphone things

I'm so surprised to see this one so low! Sometimes less can be far more impactful, which I think is something Annie executed flawlessly here. She opens the song with a stunning idea, 'Oh, a smile is more than showing teeth.' This is something I've often heard but never so succinctly. It's so simple to put on a happy face and look like you care, but Annie argues that making the effort to *actually* care is quite difficult yet much more rewarding. - **Mudkip1**

**Masta-Blasta** (7): I really appreciate how forward she is with the intro. You can quickly tell if FKA Twigs is an artist you’d be interested in. Personally, this song is just a bit out there for me, but I do LIKE it. I just don’t think I would ever choose to put it on. Her vocals are just flawless, however.

It's a shame that this song is so low. Yeah, some of this album can get a bit tiring but the way this song surprised me makes me love it that much more. The beginning of Pieta is so mysterious! I do agree though that there definitely seems to be a bit of untapped potential that Annie didn't quite release in this song, but I think its definitely a gem on the album and one that shouldn't be overlooked. - **Mudkip1**

**awryj** (10): Ok, the concept of this song is amazing. I love how the motive of Pieta is inversed and completely grotesque, and how even Mother Nature says that there's something wrong with her. can relate

**bluehxrizon** (8.5): this is spooky to me for some reason. haven’t heard anything like it before

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.5): “Baptized in the shallow end of a Holiday Inn” is just such a memorable lyric and idk why.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): in the words of the great Katy Perry, I am shooketh. Swish Swish bish xD

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.2): this sounds like something from a donkey kong soundtrack

**Kaylaboe** (8): the album is very same-y so far and this shakes things up!

**melodyllic\_** (7): some nice bossa nova stuff happening but it doesnt build much, i guess thats the intention

**SAlNTJUDE** (7): this is what the album should have been in my opinion, so much potential when she stops leaning on that awful guitar/synth and uses the medley as her expression instead of just lyrics and vocals

**shineflyer** (4): Art Samba

**Masta-Blasta** (3): This is like, an antibop.

'Easily' is gorgeous and actually a highlight of the record. Boucher strips down the electro punk mess of her previous tracks to deliver an ethereal pop track that's sickeningly gorgeous. The strings are beautiful, and the vocal layering comes close to being like a church chorus. I don't understand how anybody can think this is a lowlight of the album at all other than being a tad more minimal. - **kappyko**

For some reason I get the chorus to 'Easily' stuck in my head constantly. 'Easily / I'm the sweetest damn thing you ever saw' just oozes confidence. This song was done pretty dirty, imo, especially since it placed underneath *both* of the interludes, but the interludes are both lovely so it's alright, lol. - **Mudkip1**

**BiPolarBear17** (10): An underrated ethereal gem. It's a shame very few others here share the same love that I have for it, but for me it's one of the album's shining moments. It's raw, dream-like and acts as the perfect bridge between the two halves of the album. The chorus in particular is magical, and even the random electronic squeeks here work and give the track a fun playful vibe.

**letsallpoo** (10): people do too much on this song. i don't mind grimes being cute and inoffensive for one track in this album

**robbiec\_** (9): this song reminds me of New Year's Day of 2016. I went to a club and stayed at my friend's halls at a different uni from me and it was COLD. Their heating didn't work so I had to share a blanket with my friend but he fell asleep and fell on the ground so I was lying freezing on this table in the middle of her dorm kitchen. So at 7am I stole a coat and went for a walk and this song (and En by Arca) remind me of the cold clean air on my hungover face

**zamomattel** (9): huge fan of this song, it's very sweet and cute old-fashioned in a weird way

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): slaps but in a safe way

**monalisafrank** (8.2): i like this slower, honest break on the album and the moment when the beat kicks on the chorus the first time is sooo dope, i just think the lyrics are weaker compared to the rest of the album

**melodyllic\_** (7): wow didnt think you could get poppier than artangels but here we are. its like they stripped the sorta ethereal nature of artangels to its bones. its ok i guess

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): I can’t stand the lyrics or the “eASILYYY” and how repetitive it is, but all is forgiven and a few points are bumped up when that glorious synth comes in at the last chorus.

**ExtraEater** (5): Perhaps it is how the three-syllable locution that is "Easily" is so 'easily' (a witticism!) subsumed into her poem. Oh, but there is no other 'perhaps', for it is. Ever since I was a pre-adolescent I pondered the existence of 'ease', it is but a novel concept for nil can be described as carried out with such a subjective term. It is not the song which persuades me to surmise that 'ease' is a notion with many existent prospects, rather it is the fact that I could 'easily' skip this work because it is trash. Thank you

**nooodisaster** (5): this is trump's america.

**awryj** (4.2): lowkey tv commercial music

**PendulumThief** (4): This is easily my least favourite track on Art Angels! (It's about the same quality as that pun)

**whatareblackhole** (0): Honestly, only because Claire also hates it lol

I'm sorry, but naming your intro track "laughing and not being normal" is basically a thesis statement saying that you have a DeviantArt account. - **kappyko** 

As the first track on Art Angels, Grimes starts off strong. The majestic orchestra swoons and pierces the heart delicately yet masterfully. It's hard to make out what Grimes is singing here, but the final line, 'When the leaves begin to fall / I try to catch them all' is such a wonderful metaphor for trying to move on yet still being attached to the past. It's a wonderful beginning and a bittersweet farewell, but it's clear that beauty still lies ahead. - **Mudkip1**

**Altiondsols** (10): Don't dismiss this as just a simple intro track. This track has some of the best instrumentals, composition, and vocal performance of Claire's career.

**Raykel** (9.5): The vocals are sublime. She's a master at editing her voice to sound good.

**camirose** (9): it's an intro but a solid one and I respect that she learned violin to play the instruments for it herself

**robbiec\_** (9): that noise that sounds like a blimp in a Studio Ghibli film deflating still gets me

**SAlNTJUDE** (8): biggest sleeper track on the album, its so beautiful and what art angels should have been tbh

**whatareblackhole** (8): Okay, I love this extra as hell orchestral opener to this album. Give me those opera teas, Claire!

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Already more art pop than the entirety of ARTPOP

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): new AHS intro?

**stansymash** (7.4): i'm not like other girls. i'm weird, i'm random, get over it. my friends all say they never know what i'm gonna do next. bazinga! look i just said bazinga, because im not normal

**Kaylaboe** (6): hi every1 im new!!!!!!! holds up spork my name is claire but u can call me gR1m3S!!!!!!!!

**zamomattel** (6): good for grimes for enjoying life and not conforming but like this is kind of uninteresting

**ExtraEater** (4): Claire inaugurates *Art Angels* with an icy, zero-man orchestra, dedicated to discovering the endless oscillation of meaning only to end it in Nietzsche-inspired postmodernism, a nugatory means to an end depicted by the lowercase designation "laughing and not being normal". Carrying a theoretical torch birthed tenfold since the dawn of Andy Warhol and contemporaries, she defies conventions in all but a simple introduction. That being said, I don't like Andy Warhol's work too much. I do humbly blame him for Tumblr.

**shineflyer** (4): We're not letting this intro Intro, right? Grimes has a pretty voice, though.

DAAAAAYYILLLLL, DAYYYYYYLLLLL, REEEEEEEEEEEEEEOO. If it weren't for Butterfly this would've been my favorite album closer of the three. (let's act like the DARKSIDE remix doesn't exist) This song's all about forgetting your problems for a brief moment and spending it with those you love. The final bridge has one of my favorite lyrics on the album: 'Getting some strange looks back from the shore / And you, you pinched my arm / Said "Look who's lucky now" / And you, you saved my life / Too many times to count' - **Mudkip1**

Have you ever wanted to have some really nasty sex? Like, *really* nasty and passionate, yet somehow peaceful – like laying down on your soft bed after a long day? Letting your spine relax into the memory foam pad, melting like butter until you're one and the same with your surrounding, because this is how life should always be? This desire for a calm normalcy is what Twigs describes in Hours. Making endless love to someone so perfect, so passionate – that's what she craves in this song. 'I could kiss you for hours' she coos monotonously, melting into her soulmate like how I described earlier. Nothing is more serene than finding your happy place, and for FKA Twigs, that happy place is in the loving arms of her man. - **Mudkip1**

**robbiec\_** (11): Clams did THAT. This song is THE FKA twigs brand. The sexual politics. The battle of power. THE SEX. Sexless Agony FantaNo didn't like this song. those few seconds to gather yourself after the first chorus are powerful AND THEN MY GIRL COMES BACK, FILTHY, WIth "how would you like it if my lips touched yours and we stayed close baby 'till the stars fade out" HONESTLY. The "i could kiss you for hours weew weew break then "AND NOT MISS A THING" is just otherworldly to me. When I say the brand, FKA twigs has an amazing ability to emote with her voice AND the spaces in between and this song is a perfect example. And the ending just sounds like a climax but you don't want it to stop. take my eleven twiggy

**SAlNTJUDE** (9): the flock of birds in the beginning, rippling bass, and SEX this is Utopia ~4 years before it was even made

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): after the dangerous, violently sensual 'two weeks', 'hours' is more erotic(?) lyrically. instrumentation is still very sparse, especially love the spoken, almost chanted nature of the middle section ('how would you like it if my lips touched yours') and how she lets the song's emptiness take control. definition of a sex jam

**Raykel** (10): I love short songs cause most of the time they're nice and sweet and this is no exception. It's beautiful yet yearning, I love that.

**shineflyer** (9): I can't believe Grimes has sent me straight to a Renaissance fair.

**awryj** (8.5): Grimes said that this song is about the environment but before I knew that, I interpreted it as a coming-of-age song, about how the world that was so idyllic and interesting when you were a child turns out to be so broken and no one's doing anything about it.

**afancysandwich** (8): This really shows a slow song doesn't have to suck.

**bbfan132** (8): queen of making beautiful songs about the fucked up environment

**Leixander** (8): WHY IS THIS NOT A FULL SONG? I really love the lyrics which are about global warming.

**zenits** (8): not a big fan... and by not a big fan i mean this is """only""" an 8/10 so i am actually a big fan

**stansymash** (7.4): i dont think this is actually a real song there appears to have been a mistake

**rickikardashian** (7): my favorite part of the song was when it transitioned with butterfly and i didn’t notice

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Remember when people thought Grimes was trying to be mainstream, and then she releases her lead MV called "Flesh Without Blood/Life in the Vivid Dream"?

**ExtraEater** (6): I think it's really nice how the rest of Art Angels was defined in part by her life and experiences, and a short, pretty musically distinct interlude before the album ends happens to address worlds beyond ("Vivid Dream" has a pretty obvious meaning). All that being said, this was too short and imo it doesn't really sustain itself in the little time it has. At least Butterfly helps to continue this vibe, too.

**MrSwearword** (4): Poppy does this vocal style much better.

I find this one to be about a minute too long. It doesn't really go anywhere even though it has a decent sound. This one also feels a bit tiresome after hearing the uniqueness of the songs before it on LP1. 'Numbers' feels like a last minute addition to me which is kinda sad. - **Mudkip1**

**afancysandwich** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG. It's so fun to dance to. I relate to it. The gasps in the outro.

**zamomattel** (9): yeah fuck maths

**melodyllic\_** (8.7): ooh here's the crazy, frenetic electronic track!! 'numbers' was actually my least liked track at first, due to the really industrial and atonal nature of the beats but it grew on me. plus there's a really beautiful melodic section in the last quarter which is a highlight by itself

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I love the whole trap hi-hat breakdown and this might be the most interesting song on the album.

**shineflyer** (8.5): takes a bit to get going, but FKA twigs has a crazy falsetto, holy shit.

**ncd46** (8): When the beat goes into double time and the FM synth is reversed omggggggg

**whatareblackhole** (8): I really like the anger in this one as a contrast to the first half

**nooodisaster** (6.5): "was I just a number to you?" FKA twigs @ this rate.

**awryj** (5): one two threeee not onleeee u and meeee got one eeeeighty degreeees and im caaaught in buh-tweeeeeen

**triptoyourheart** (3): there’s a good song in here somewhere but it’s just too overproduced for the sake of it.

jackie antoochie does it again, teaming up with grims to create a subtle yet wonderful lil track that gives me the chillies whenever i hear it. grims' vocal layers add a super unique texture to the song that's so interesting. i lahv it and at first this song was really flopping but then its avg stayed about the same while everything else in this rat gradually fell. yay, i guess? - **Mudkip1**

**monalisafrank** (10): look at kween grimes working with jack antonoff before the rest of these hoes. anyway i adore this song so much and wish it were on the album tbh, i think it's a similar sound to california but i actually prefer it

**zenits** (10): i discovered grimes through this song so i'll always love it. also jack antonoff is a legend

**E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb** (8.5): Not bad, but now I can definitely see why it worries people when Jack Antonoff is announced as a producer on certain albums

**CrispyEggs123** (8): queen of thermodynamics

**kappyko** (8): jack antonoff fuera!!!! nah it's a cute song

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Classic sad music, it's weird hearing Grimes sound so normal.

**zamomattel** (7.5): Jack Antonoff should stop with all the bops it's a little much

**PoppySeedK** (7): Grimes is maybe the only musician who doesn't sound better with the help of bleachers. Bleachers definitely sounds better with grimes though

**letsallpoo** (6): i love high school chemistry class

**Average:** 7.273 **// Total Points:** 705.5 **// Controversy:** 1.925

"I Prefer Your Love" is saccharine balladry, that might come across as a bit much, but comes from a genuinely beautiful place. Clark's mother had gotten terribly sick, and this song comes from that moment in Annie's life where she realized that she could lose her mother so easily. I think that's a sentiment that really speaks to all of us, regardless of whether you like this song or not. Opening a song with such a line as "I prefer your love to Jesus" is downright blasphemous and a bit too on-the-nose, but it genuinely feels personable as a lyric. The abstractions and hospital allusions are enough to keep the themes of the song going, and there's a lot of genuine beauty to this track that some artists would love to be able to pull off. "I Prefer Your Love" holds a certain darkness as well, with a sterile background of reverb that echoes the walls of a hospital room. Clark's vocals mostly stand alone, with light Minimoog and guitar arrangements that blend into the pop background. "I Prefer Your Love" might indulge in sincerity a bit much, but it's a moment of sincerity that feels right for the record. - **kappyko**

**monalisafrank** (6.1): i felt like this should be more moving given that it's a parental love song, but i think annie suffers sometimes from not being simple enough in her verses so they get kind of muddled, i think this song is a good example

This one's not too bad, imo. Listening back to all of these songs just makes me appreciate LP1 that much more. You can clearly tell how much she's improved on like, basically everything. Breathe is a pretty nice, chill track that would fit nicely on one of those 'I need to go to sleep' playlists. Not that that's an insult or anything, though, since I love playlists like that. - **Mudkip1**

This one makes me a bit sad cause I was really rooting for One Time to make it to Day 2.. it unfortunately gets cut right at the very last second. I absolutely LOVE her voice on this track, and the atypical, off-kilter production just adds so much to the mystique of it. I especially enjoy the way the bass drops the first time she sings the lyric 'And hope that everything we are is leading to the one time.' The weird, deep, distorted mess of vocals during the chorus is pretty jarring, though. Wasn't a fan of that bit at all. - **Mudkip1**
