Picture yourself in a dreary, dimly lit room. It's late afternoon in rainy Seattle, Washington. The light above your nightstand flickers occasionally. The wind whistles through a slight crack in the windowsill. Below you is the faint roar of passing vehicles, and the occasional ^(^@)honk of oncoming traffic jolts you awake from your nap. "oh, barnacles!" you exclaim. You're supposed to be finishing your article on the mating patterns of certain marine mammals but your surroundings aren't stimulating enough to keep your eyes open. Suddenly, an idea pops into your brain, and you reach for your phone and open it to your favorite music streaming platform. Thinking to yourself, you type in the search bar -

`something real quick to fuck me awake or something idk`

You're sure that this isn't going to return anything at all; however, it was the first idea your sleep-deprived brain could think of, so there must be *something* about it that could work. Magically, it does work. Out of the entire catalog of available music, only three albums appear on your screen – *Grimes - Art Angels*, *St. Vincent - St. Vincent*, and *FKA Twigs - LP1*. "wow!" you exclaim, "these skinny LeGeNdS are hopefully gonna save the day." After careful consideration, the first album you play is:

-
##Grimes - Art Angels

Radiant color streams out of the speakers of your phone! Psychadelic greens and pinks and blues bleed into your surroundings, turning the dark, dull room into a vibrant playground of color. In Grimes' 2015 smash hit album *Art Angels*, Grimes introduces the listener to happiness, warmth, playfulness, and a childlike whimsicality. She takes them on a journey through time and space, love and hate, thick and thin. As the album continues, more and more vibrant color erupts into the world, overloading your senses and sending you into an ethereal trance. Your eyes and ears have never experienced anything similar to it. *'So this is what fun feels like'* you think to yourself, unable to control your body. Music has never been quite as enchanting – as wondrous – as moving as this. *Kill v. Maim* begins, and the colors move faster, as if in tune with the beat of the song. *Venus Fly* roars in as Janelle Monáe aids Grimes in creating a mechanical, overwhelming work of magic. The entire room pulsates to the drum, sending the color splattering against the walls and furniture in a unique design. Art is being displayed right before your eyes.

As the album comes to a close, you regain control of your senses. Every single track was perfect. "What an incredible experience," you think to yourself. However, your night isn't over yet. Your turn on the next album:

-
##FKA Twigs - LP1

The world abruptly goes black. Nothing can be heard or seen apart from a faint trickle of water off in the distance. The silence is mystifying and inquisitive. Your ears pick up a sudden, scurrying noise. A faint chant fades in like surround sound, spinning and swirling around you. The words become clearer and closer. 

> *I love another, and thus I hate myself... and thus I hate myself* 

A light from above shines down in front of you. There lies FKA Twigs, laying on her chest, palms pressed on the floor near her shoulders, eyes piercing into your soul. She contorts her body in a multitude of different positions as the album continues, flawlessly portraying her lyrics, emotions, and experiences just by the way she moves. She's graceful, intense, seductive. Her flexibility is astounding – her innocent demeanor highlighting the spellbinding performance. The unusual yet unique production enhances the spectacular visuals. FKA Twigs saves the best for last with the songs *Give In* and *Kicks,* masterfully demonstrating the vogue art form. Moving closer to you, she [clack clack clacks](http://68.media.tumblr.com/9df847f09f97e309880897cb33a9bf33/tumblr_or9itxb39D1wouello3_1280.jpg) to the beat. Her joints appear to be nonexistent, like water, spinning around at will fluidly.

Once the album finishes, FKA Twigs vanishes out of thin air. You're surprised but also sort of expected it to happen. Light refills the room and you regain your senses until you start to play the final album on the list:


-
##St. Vincent - St. Vincent

The first track, *Rattlesnake*, slithers captivatingly around you. [Annie Clark](https://i.imgur.com/2u7YQmK.gif) captures your mind, body, and soul after just the first verse. The lyrics quickly become more manic. The intensity of the opening track makes your heart race, your blood pump, your breathing hasten. [Annie](https://i.imgur.com/2u7YQmK.gifv) has magically transported you into a lush jungle filled with life and energy. Flowers bloom from every angle – birds chirp classical melodies in the trees, whose trunks reach miles above your head. The world around you is astounding, ever moving, constantly breathing.
>*Am I the only one?? In the only world???*

[Annie cackles.](http://31.media.tumblr.com/940b520d2fe37c25ed8e662198d3d442/tumblr_n7nk9wjC4r1rabunjo6_250.gif) As the album transitions into new tracks, you're teleported into experiencing new visions, new planets, new experiences. For *Birth in Reverse,* lights sparkle like stars in every direction. The world somehow gets darker and lighter at the same time. Heavenly guitar riffs pour sweetly into your ears like honey. *Prince Johnny* begins, and suddenly the stars begin to fade. An intense wave of warm emotion floods the vast scenery. You feel a drop on your shoulder and look up. [Annie Clark](https://i.imgur.com/2u7YQmK.gifv) is hovering above you, eyes wide and filled with tears. She mourns, sending tears splashing as far as the eye can see. A deep sense of hopelessness surrounds you until the album continues and you're moved through other stages of feelings and emotions.

Once again, the album ends and the intense visions slow to a halt. [St. Vincent's](https://i.imgur.com/2u7YQmK.gifv) songwriting powerfully moved you, and inspired you to figure out the last portion of your article.

##Welcome to the  iconic, ^showstopping, ^^impactful, ^^^legendary, ^^^^spectacular, rate of three incredible indie pop goddesses, hosted by /u/kappyko and /u/mudkip1!

if you weren't already aware, these are the three albums (and one EP) we will be rating:

#[Grimes - *Art Angels*](https://i.ytimg.com/vi/qAXOJ2VOJOc/maxresdefault.jpg)

Claire Boucher is a Canadian singer, songwriter, and producer, best known for her musical work under the stage name Grimes. She started writing music in 2007, and soon asked a friend to teach her how to use GarageBand to produce her own music. Boucher first started releasing music through Arbutus Records, dropping her debut album *Geidi Primes* and subsequent effort *Halfaxa* in 2010. She started gaining decent acclaim amongst music blogs for her surreal, dreamy sound, and was signed to 4AD in 2012. She released *Visions* later that year to outstanding acclaim, with critics praising her songwriting and musical aesthetic.

In 2014, she released the single "Go" with Blood Diamonds, originally written for Rihanna. The song's more overtly pop sound was alienating to some fans who had believed she was attempting to become more mainstream. In early 2015, she released the demo to the song "REALiTi", stating that it was intended to be on an album she had cancelled due to its connection to a period of time in which she was under intense pressure, something she felt was too gloomy for her current state. Later that year, she dropped the music video to "Flesh without Blood/Life in the Vivid Dream", and announced the album *Art Angels*.

The album is a sharp departure from Grimes' origins, transforming from ethereal electronic atmospheres into playful, fantastical pop. The record features a variety of instruments, contributing to a surreal palette of electroclash, hip hop, new wave, and dance-pop. Nothing on this album suggests the intense emotional struggle that she worked on her scrapped album for; *Art Angels* is a joyful, otherworldly experience front to back.

&nbsp;

#[FKA twigs - *LP1*](http://theyoungturks.co.uk/images/uploads/releases/TWIGS---FACEBOOK-AVATAR.jpg)

FKA twigs' first full-length studio effort *LP1* had a long, anticipated journey, and one that was worth the wait. Once anonymously known under "twigs", Tahliah Debrett Barnett was a backup dancer for several high-profile music videos including our subreddit favorite Jessie J's "Price Tag" video. Barnett released her debut project *EP1* in 2012 to Internet buzz, becoming "New Band of the Day" for the Guardian and later landing herself a record deal with the UK record label Young Turks. She released *EP2* in 2013, featuring the tracks "Water Me" and "Papi Pacify".

On *LP1*, twigs explores the deepest and most experimental side of British alternative R&B, but shouldn't be pigeonholed into just this label. While her vocals may occasionally take a turn into typical R&B vocalizing, she identifies more comfortably with the likes of Bjork than anything else. Her production with Arca is dissonant and dark glitch pop. At times, *LP1* is terrifying and uncomfortable, while at others sensual and gorgeous. Barnett's whispery vocals effortlessly flutter around chaotic synths and hypnotic rhythms. *LP1* is fully realized in its own craft of glasslike and metallic sounds, and is the closest to the future you'll ever feel in this rate.

#[St. Vincent - *St. Vincent*](https://i.imgur.com/Vnw1rqe.jpg)

Annie Clark is one of the most unique guitarists working in indie rock today. Her jilted, noisy guitar wizardry has been her trademark for years. Her multi-instrumentalist talents were first put to record on 2007's *Marry Me*, an indie pop record that showcased her eclectic songwriting tendencies and penchant for gorgeous arrangements. She explored dissonance on her 2009 record *Actor*, taking cues from noise rock and retaining her keen melodies. *Strange Mercy* is where her songwriting becomes its most visceral, as she explores lyrical themes such as depression and sexual anxiety. The year following the release of *Strange Mercy*, Clark collaborated with David Byrne of Talking Heads on the brassy, funky *Love This Giant*, which would show her direction in the future with *St. Vincent*. The single "Krokodil / Grot" on Record Store Day was outright sludge metal, which made people certain her next direction would be her foray into the depths of experimental rocking. Then, in 2013, she was signed to Republic Records, and released her self-titled album *St. Vincent*.

*St. Vincent* is a mastery of pop structure while maintaining the neurotic tendencies of her prior work, as she transforms St. Vincent from merely a stage name to practically a full-blown character, a mass cult leader with gray hair and a guitar. Her songwriting on *St. Vincent* is some of her most melodic work, and the structures of these tracks display a knowledge of the canon of art rock. On some tracks she apes the works of Sleater Kinney; on others, she delivers lowkey Velvet Underground-esque ballads. Clark knows the secret formula to a hypnotizing pop tune, and *St. Vincent* is how she reveals this fact.

#RULES AND IMPORTANT INFO
 
###**PLEASE READ ALL THE RULES.**

IF YOU HAVE PARTICIPATED IN ANY RATE POST - "2016 ULTIMATE ALBUM RATE," THEN THEY ARE MOSTLY THE SAME. WE ARE USING A PROGRAM MADE BY /u/LETSALLPOO (thanks btw!), AND **IF THESE RULES AREN’T FOLLOWED PRECISELY, THE PROGRAM WILL MESS UP**. EVEN IF YOU HAVE SEEN THESE RULES BEFORE, GO OVER THEM AGAIN PLEASE, BECAUSE IF YOU DO SOMETHING WRONG WE WILL MAKE FUN OF YOU!
 
**SERIOUSLY GUYS**
 
* Listen to each song and **assign each a score between 1 and 10**. Decimals are fine, but **please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two demical spots:**

> 8.2 | OKAY

> 8.22 | NOT OKAY

> 8.2222222 | LITERALLY WHY
 
* **Yes, you have to listen to every song**.  I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program.
 
* Your scores should **NOT** be considered confidential.
 
* You may give **ONE** song a **0** and **ONE** song an **11**. By one, we mean that this is **one song total**, not one song per album. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; **excessive sabotage ruins rate results**.
 
* You **can** change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM either me or /u/kappyko again afterwards.
 
* The program makes things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on our part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to **use the pre-prepared link, found [right here](https://tinyurl.com/y7t7cyvg). PLEASE USE THAT**. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
 
* If you don't follow the format, We'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions. We'll also probably/definitely ask you to fix it on your own if the issue seems like it's going to take a long time to correct.

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

* If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!
 
* If, after sumbitting your scores, you change your mind about a certain song, I WILL change it up until i stop accepting scores.

**This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:**
 
> Grimes - Scream (feat. Aristophanes): 0 This is trash!
 
**These are INCORRECT, in fact, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:**
 
>Grimes - Scream (feat. Aristophanes): 0: This is trash!
 
>Grimes - Scream (feat. Aristophanes): This is trash! 0
 
>Grimes - Scream (feat. Aristophanes): I'm giving this a 0 because this is trash!
 
>Grimes - Scream (feat. Aristophanes): 0-This is trash!
 
>Grimes - Scream (feat. Aristophanes): 0 (This is trash!)
 
---
We’re done! If you’ve read all that, thank you so much, and we can’t wait for your scores! If you didn’t read all that, then we can’t wait to shame you! I'm very excited to see the results of this rate, and I'll go ahead and tell you now what you already know: **these albums are amazing and this should be a fun and wholesome rate :)** Also, **there are only 5 bad songs in this entire rate so if you think otherwise then your taste is trash!!!**
