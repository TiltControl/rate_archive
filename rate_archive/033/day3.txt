##**HI** /u/Mudkip1 and /u/kappyko here

Day 3 starts at **4 PM EST!!!!!!:)**

https://plug.dj/popheads

https://plug.dj/popheads

15 songs are left, mostly by one artist.. But that's okay! Tears may fall, punches may be thrown, wigs may be snatched, but in the end, just remember that only one artist here has won a Grammy and it isn't Grimes. 

[](#annie) So to be honest, who's the *real* winner right now.

Rihanna is shaking in her boots with this dancehall/rodeo abomination of eclectic production; of course, abomination is used endearingly. It's messy, unrestrained catchiness, and the extended line of "Ca-a-a-a-alifornia" is a very cheerful middle finger to the pretentious indie press that restrains Boucher. It's very joyous and entrancing pop magic that immediately takes you into the aesthetic of *Art Angels*: messy, loud, and unafraid to express what it is. - **kappyko**

'doot, do do, doodo doo dododoudoo' California introduces Art Angels with no holds barred, giving the listener a big spoonful of Grimes' playful nature. I love her vocal run when she belts during the chorus. Songs like this (along with basically the rest of the album) really show you just how passionate she is about her music. It surprised me when I learned this song was also her response to music review websites like the infamous Pitchfork. She spoke about her disappointment in them during an interview a while back: "To say that I scrapped an entire album, without fact-checking... No one fact-checked it. Like, you just fucked my narrative. You just fucked years of work that I‚Äôve done. And you‚Äôre too immature to take it down." This quote changed my whole perspective of the song, especially in lines like, 'The things they see in me I cannot see myself.' - **Mudkip1**

also, you guys were really opinionated on this one. i chose my favorites like always but there's still a lot i didn't include so be sure to check all the comments by opening up the imgur image <3

**Favorite Comments**

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is like if Sheryl Crow sucked on a helium balloon and took shrooms, which I never knew I needed until I heard this song.

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): this will always bring me back to my first coachella. it makes me want to dance and cry.

**therokinrolla** (10): this song is like a cheesecake covered in sandpaper once you get past the abrasiveness its very tasty

**monalisafrank** (9.5): um i just now upon doing research discovered that this samples pon de replay which is so dope, i love the sunny mood of this track and the defiant happy pop message, the only thing is that her voice on the chorus is a touch shrill for me

**cyborglilith** (9.1): Grimes snapped harder than when I tried to deadlift 5 pounds

**Masta-Blasta** (9): Why, oh why does this song get as much hate as it does? Even Claire said it‚Äôs a shitty song. It‚Äôs not. It‚Äôs not a shitty song.. With lyrics like ‚Äúthe things you see in me, I cannot see myself. When you get bored of me I‚Äôll be back on the shelf.‚Äù Grimes has impressive vocals on this track, and it‚Äôs a powerful statement to begin the song with.

**robbiec\_** (9): interesting fact! I fell in a puddle outside the library in first year when I was listening to this song and she was singing "and when the ocean rises underneath the ground". also literally last month I was running to this song and the snow started falling (for the first time in 2 years) on the chorus I had a moment

**shineflyer** (8): boom boom clap, boom de-clap de-clap

**zamomattel** (8): the song of every summer, despacito can sit down

**stansymash** (7.9): i think this is the first song i've ever heard that's titled california, or that references california. truly a breath of fresh air from that plague of Iowa based songs we're used to.

**bluehxrizon** (7.5): ü§†

**nooodisaster** (7): songs about new york: your dreams will come true and anything is possible!! / songs about california: fuck this state.

**ExtraEater** (6): Does it not prevail that Grimes is well-versed in the unavailing mundane? After all, her artistic body did previously release Halfaxa, a work adorned by meaningless decorations ultimately debased into a fleetingly existential abstraction left to the minds of proverbial internet dwellers. California is her defiant work, her contemplated antithesis to Halfaxa. Where Halfaxa is ultimately a vapid intercourse with untenanted noise, California takes pride in its flaccid anatomy and defies the ultimate notion of 'pop culture', peculiarly enough the 'pop music' that permeates the airwaves of fake modern utopias. Claire's diligence to art in line with her artistic lagoon of secular equity is unmatched.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (3): Probably one of my least favorite choruses I‚Äôve ever heard in my entire life. I know people love it, and I get it, but I just really don‚Äôt like this at all. It‚Äôs physically grating. It hurts me. And I don‚Äôt really like her production here either, it‚Äôs all over the place. And the whole thing just goes on for too long despite being a pretty standard 3 and a half minutes.

**BiPolarBear17** (0): I love my girlie Grimes a shit ton, so I was obviously super hyped for the release of Art Angels. Unfortunately, when I first started listening to the album I almost stopped right away because California is toe-curlingly awful. Transitioning from the pre-chorus to the chorus is like going from your dentist calmly asking you questions to them jamming various metal torture devices inside your mouth and being deafened by the loud whirring of equipment. Even outside of the shrill mess of a chorus there's nothing interesting to the rest of the track at all, and the lyrics leave a lot to be desired.

**Average:** 8.172 **// Total Points:** 792.7 **// Controversy:** 1.416

Artangels is such a perfect road trip song. I can picture myself sitting in a top-down convertible with my hands in the air blaring this song for the world to hear, going wherever the road takes me. I love shouting the line 'Running every red light / You were right / Oh Montr√©al don't break my heart' along with basically every other line in this song. It's filled to the brim with love and energy and passion and fun and carelessness and life. - **Mudkip1**

I first heard this in an H&M store. When I asked Siri what it was and found out, I thought to myself, wow, I really should've been paying attention to the album the first time around.

The production and songwriting on this could legitimately be a hit in the right hands. Boucher outlines every bit of this with summery, romantic guitars, as she sings some French shit about love and ilk. The outro feels like a rush of adrenaline, experiencing the city of Montreal for the first time. Really gorgeous and probably the best success story of the songs on this record. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**Altiondsols** (10): The first song I think of when I hear "summer jam". This is the perfect song for being in the car on the way to the beach.

**E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb** (10): I think I love this song

**Leixander** (10): I LOVE THE LOOP SYNTH IN THIS SO MUCH AAAA

**robbiec\_** (10): this song took the longest to grow on me for some reason but few songs deliver euphoria to me than the bridge with "I don't need your medicine... gonna dance all night"

**frankiefrankiefrank** (9.6): This sounds like one of those songs in a 90's/early 00's teen movie where the characters travel to the future or meet aliens (I mean that as a compliment btw).

**ExtraEater** (9.5): A fascinating potpourri of comely sounds that swathe around the inexperienced critic--see, the consumer--and the adroit art critic like a wave of decorative modern, Victorian sweets, melted in the fervid, yet pleasurable heat of the celestial body above. Underneath an umbrella of sounds, indemnity is what this work gifts to my assemblage of undefined artistic works. Love is all I can provide to this, theoretically.

**monalisafrank** (9.1): this song sounds like a car commercial song mixed with madonna vibes somehow and i'm not mad, it's amazing, love the ending as well

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): it's a love song!! Montr√©al is where her career begun - she went to McGill College there but ~~got expelled~~ dropped out because she spent too much time on her music. i think it's a beautiful track, expressing and immortalizing her love for the city.

**chipsi1** (9): this turned me canadian

**eklxtreme** (9): the way she produces her songs, she manages to make simple pop songs sound so different and futuristic.

**CrispyEggs123** (8): Oui Claire! Tu me tue avec votre Fran√ßais I don't speak French pls let me live

**afancysandwich** (7): I would throw this in my "My life is a romcom" playlist but that's not really a compliment?

**triptoyourheart** (7): lack of punctuation outsold

**shineflyer** (6.5): Such a positive song, though it's a little bit "background music".

The chorus on this song goes OFF! I didn't use to appreciate this one as much as I do now, and now it's one of my favorites on Art Angels. I love how the beat feels like it's from a retro video game. The loud, attention-grabbing production during the chorus is really neat, especially how all she says during it is 'It's mine.' The world is all hers and she knows it. - **Mudkip1**

Actually, this might be my favorite song on the record, and a would-be 11 if I didn't give it to Annie, which, honestly? Probably should've gone to this. The bitpop sound on this is irresistible, and it's kind of reminiscent of what a Visions single would sound like if it was imported into *Art Angels* gracefully and tactfully. Boucher's vocals on the chorus are so pretty, God. This song is definitely yours, Grimes. Fantastic work. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**Altiondsols** (11): I like this song enough that I bought a T-shirt of it specifically.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): another bop, yet also the most complex track on the album. the mood shifts a few times, including the keychange at the bridge and the downcast outro. there's this overarching theme/idea of empowerment, of "fuck you i can go this alone, you're so far behind me". it's also a callback to her 2010 track [World ‚ô° Princess](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVt3FxE8F9w), about her best friend who passed on when they were in high school.

**chipsi1** (10): all male sexist producers suddenly disappeared after this bop was created, dr luke has transformed into his true pig form and he's too old to walk

**Masta-Blasta** (9): the melody is unbelievably catchy. Thanks to this track I somehow converted my husband to Grimes-stanminship.

"Prince Johnny" is the moment where Clark's writing goes into the forefront, backed by brilliant trip hop percussion. It's classic balladry that would impress the greatest of rock legends, yet the lyrics that ache for identity feel very relevant to the modern age. "Prince Johnny" is gorgeously abstract yet vividly emotional, and deserves to be higher than it ended up being. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**awryj** (11): I've read the interpretations and annotations of the lyrics and while I agree with them, I'm pretty sure the song is more universal. It's definitely about a homosexual man who is friends with St. Vincent and, if I'm not wrong, he's simply looking for acceptance, wishing to become a "real boy". But, in a heartbreaking revelation at the end of the song, she can't really help him. She's confused about her identity as well. Such a beautiful, well written song.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (11): Annie snatched my wig with these emotional lyrics

**chipsi1** (10): all people named johnny suddenly came out and are now having a mass johnny pride parade what's going on here

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this is her best song tbh! beautiful, emotional, divine! i literally had to flip a coin to decide between this and Pendulum for my 11

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): I normally hate choral vocals in pop music, but this feels so necessary for the sake of DRAMA.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): definitely the best song in this album even though there's 13 more to go

**VodkaInsipido** (10): a choir = instant 10

**whatareblackhole** (10): Before the Prince lost his kingdom and became the focus of Happy Birthday, Johnny ‚Äì a groovy, choral song of worship. I loOoOoOove everything about this one

**therokinrolla** (9.3): gender is a construct! Tear it down!

**PoppySeedK** (9): St Vincent's Johnny songs are always touching

**lunasaflowers** (8.5): One of the standout tracks-- haunting and mournful, but in the eerie, strange, technological style of this album. My only criticism is that this track doesn't really change up much in its four and a half minutes, but it's good enough that that's a minor criticism.

**bluehxrizon** (8): this is good but tbh happy birthday johnny outsold

**melodyllic\_** (8): a slow, rich and emotional ballad that compensates for its repetitiveness with annie's layered vocals and that amazing chord progression

**Raykel** (6.5): I was really rooting for this one since I liked Happy Birthday, Johnny so much, but you win some you lose some.

**SAlNTJUDE** (5): the whole gospel/chapel theme should have been embraced instead of used

**Average:** 8.390 **// Total Points:** 813.8 **// Controversy:** 1.645

In what I had previously assumed to be one of Grimes' most overlooked bops, Pin surprisingly performs far better than I feel like anyone could have ever anticipated. Not to say it doesn't deserve it, though! In fact, for a while I went through an 'exclusively-listen-to-Pin-and-maybe-a-couple-other-Art-Angels-songs-but-nothing-else' phase, simply because my ears loved listening to her angelic voice and refreshing production. - **Mudkip1**

"Pin" always seemed to fade into the background of the punkish electropop stylistics of *Art Angels* for me, but it's still quite upbeat enough to sustain itself. I can't see why this is so 11 worthy, but I think the combination of shifting eclectic production and the first chorus's hit is what sealed the deal for most Grimes stans. Not much of a highlight for me personally, but there's an appeal to this kind of stuff I can see. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**CrispyEggs123** (11): Such a beautiful song, one of the poppier tracks on this album. This is the most emotional song in the album imo. The sweet, sugary, happy instrumental works with the sad lyrics. Her weird high pitched singing style really works in her favor here. I would write an assay if I had the skill.

**Leixander** (11): Iconic opening synths, the guitar in the chorus, great lyrics, Grimes' delivery... Pin is one of my favorite songs of all time. Also did you all know that there is a 9 second teaser for the video that is STILL not out? :(

**PoppySeedK** (11): the drop in this song is the most powerful white magic known to man. The lyrics are so evocative and subtle, they are grimes at her best. The chorus has such awesome rythmic feel, too.

**Altiondsols** (10): This song is just so intoxicating. It starts off as a cute love song, but as the lyrics gradually get darker, the production gets poppier and more energetic as if it's still in denial. It creates this really beautiful dissonance until it ends with Claire repeating "It was too good to be true."

**monalisafrank** (10): this song is a flawfree mix of the softer, more honest songs on the record and the cathartic bangers. i love the picture this song paints, it's really beautiful

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): One of my favorite Grimes songs, and the obvious standout from this album for me. From the absolutely maximalist and stunning instrumental, to some of Grimes‚Äô best lyrics ever (‚ÄúI was only looking for a human to reciprocate‚Äù), it‚Äôs a ride from start to finish and it reaches heights most of the rest of the album fails to reach. It‚Äôs amazing how dynamic this track is, and how it manages to keep everything fresh until the end, unlike some of the more repetitive tracks on the record.

**whatareblackhole** (10): If I‚Äôm not mistaken, this song is about a self-harming friend, and I think it‚Äôs so beautifully loving and heartbreaking

**stansymash** (9.2): this is the song everybody overlooked and then everybody looked at, then told everybody else it was overlooked and now its the opposite of overlooked. a true canadian saga

**PendulumThief** (9): A totally underrated bop

**rickikardashian** (8): don‚Äôt get your tattoos done with a needle and ink, you‚Äôll get aids

**therokinrolla** (8): i can only ever think of the boss from binding of isaac when listening to this song

**ExtraEater** (7): I do humbly theorize that 'Pin' is Grimes' manifesto of her literary aptitude. Her allusion to 'A Midsummer Night's Dream', while rather commonplace, is effectuated with such simplicity and well-meaning that it is 'irresistible' in nature. Pin me on your soft bulletin board of truth-seekers, Claire

**awryj** (6.8): Ok she impressed me with that Midsummer Night's Dream reference

**Masta-Blasta** (5.5): don‚Äôt @ me, Pin stans.

**MrSwearword** (5): Grimes‚Äô shtick of weak vocals on strong production wore out its welcome long ago.

It's so hard to not dance maniacally to this absolute gem. Annie Clark may try to tell you it's just an ordinary day in the very first line of the song, but Birth in Reverse is anything but. The guitar is maddening, the drumbeat frantic. Her vocals are loud and commanding, grabbing your attention and never giving you enough time to look away. Oh, and the masturbate lyric is iconic. - **Mudkip1**

Annie delivers a rhythmic, frantic noise pop jam with this track. I'm pleased to see it made it this far, honestly! But with one 11, it's clear why it kind of didn't. It's absolutely great, well-realized indie rock, but not exactly quite everybody's favorite song. Full of slightly-masturbatory guitar fuckery, this punkish outing deserves its place particularly for just how amazing the guitar work is on that outro. Bless up. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**afancysandwich** (10): And then it goes into this perfect art pop rock song with a delicious theme for the outro. Lose your life when she sings, "Befoooooore....."

**chipsi1** (10): i'm in my mother's uterus again what's going on

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): M A S T U R B A T E

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): Queen of electropunk. Panic! At the Disco who?

**ncd46** (10): Almost got my 11. There was so much competition for my 11 this time wow

**shineflyer** (10): This song's forward motion could destroy buildings.

**stansymash** (10): somehow this isn't the only song in the rate that makes masturbation sound glamorous

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): this song gets better when you imagine what a birth in reverse would look like

**triptoyourheart** (10): Those guitars ugh destroy me queen

**awryj** (9): I'm pretty sure this song sums up the whole concept of the album. This is the romantic statement of St. Vincent as an artist, in which she declares that she can see more than the puny humans who live their normal lives. Her art will live forever Horatio , y'all will die. She's the player, you're the sims.

**Kaylaboe** (9): benjamin button who? a really good song, but it ends so abrupt

**PendulumThief** (9): "Take out the garbage, masturbate" is far too relatable of a lyric for my current life.

**therokinrolla** (9): this song feels like a sitcom

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7.5): i don't understand what she's saying but i like it

**Raykel** (7): Sounds painful.

**SAlNTJUDE** (7): incredible but teeters on the edge of being generic garage-band trash

**Altiondsols** (6): I thought this was the artpop rate not the fetish rate

**Average:** 8.460 **// Total Points:** 820.6 **// Controversy:** 1.727

---

Unlike kappy, I adore this version of RealiTi. I think they're both extremely good in their own right, but this one just feels so much more polished. This, in my opinion, is the song that's most similar to her old work. The punchy production gives the song a greater sense of cohesion with the rest of Art Angles ‚Äì you probably wouldnt even know this was originally from a scrapped album she was no longer happy with. And I love playing this song through my speakers and dancing to it. I often get so lost in the production when I listen to RealiTi.. it leaves me in a state of pure bliss. Seeing her perform this song live would probably be a life-changing experience. - **Mudkip1**

I really feel this version of the song kind of ruins the mystique and legacy of the demo's ethereality in a way. The gorgeous, understated synths of the original become a sickening mess of electro synths and bass, the vocals sound too whiny, and in general it feels like a case of "if it ain't broke, don't fix it." - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb** (11): It was an extremely difficult choice between this and the demo version for my 11, but I feel that this one has an air of hope to it

**1313Harbor** (10): A perfect song. I discovered this at the same time as Run Away With Me, and I was rocketed into the world of synth pop.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i can't believe this was her opener when i saw her because like, i was truly unprepared to hear my favorite song on the album that soon. it's like a beautiful dreampop journey and i want to live in it

**letsallpoo** (10): this is better than the demo and i will die on this hill

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): ok here‚Äôs the deal, i pretty much prefer this version over the demo one. the demo actually didn‚Äôt feel like a demo. it sounded polished to my ears, but i guess for some people, they preferred the ‚Äúrawness‚Äù of it so idk maybe I‚Äôm just deaf

**cyborglilith** (9.8): Sounds much cleaner, polished, and poopy than the demo at the cost of emotion. The chorus moving up and down while the boppy synths in the background create a flowing atmosphere that simply makes perfect sense. And omg, I just realized this song lasts 5 minutes because of the long outro, but I feel like it‚Äôs only 30 seconds.

**stansymash** (9.5): the comment above me is hilarious 

**Masta-Blasta** (9): It‚Äôs such a good driving song and I feel like literally anybody could get into this song. Like, I could play this for my straight-edge grandma and she‚Äôd probably relax a little.

**awryj** (8): pretty chill. i like how the melody ascends and then descends in the chorus, just like the shape of a mountain (i totally didnt read that on genius)

**ExtraEater** (8): Reality? Or RealiTi? Oh, Claire Boucher you have struck your genius again! What emerges from her diversification of language is a deep musical dissertation of the essential unreality, no, unrealiTi of meaning. What starts out as hope in the beginning of man's entrance into reality (not to be confused with realiTi) soon becomes corroded into a manifesto of lust and power, leaving only a sense of nihilism and the impossibility of some such new beginning. Death is seemingly one of the most pervasive figures in art history, and in this work he all but trespasses his immortal coil to become a visible spectre to the artful eyes of Grimes, who is opened to a new "RealiTi". Does it stand that the erudite glamour of RealiTi becomes preferable to Reality? Is "RealiTi" but a salmagundi of overblown, archaic phrases and false intelligence? Is the Demo pre-working of this work more preferable to the original in its lack of pretentiousness? Please discuss this with your partners. You will be getting a grade for this assignment.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7.5): it's not the demo. the album version is still nice, but it's not the demo. it's more polished and more technically accomplished, but it lost some of the rawness that i loved about the demo. it acts as a lull between the real bangers but unfortunately, it's not the demo.

**lunasaflowers** (7.2): welcome to the REAL world sweaty ((((:

**robbiec\_** (6.7): I originally gave this my zero because it's just not the iconic demo version but I couldn't it's still a good song

**MrSwearword** (6): not the worst thing, but production this meandering shouldn‚Äôt last FIVE FUCKING MINUTES

**dirdbub** (5): queen of doing meth while having gay sex

**SAlNTJUDE** (3): did she fall on the mixer or something

**kappyko** (0): it's basically REALiTi with its legacy ruined. it still goes I guess. it feels kinda... off. **lol yes I did make comments on my rate form - kappyko**

'How does it feel to have me thinking about you? / Wishing my words were enough to consume you.' sets the perfect tone for this song. I watched a live performance of this a few days ago and oh my god she takes your breath away. Her delivery is flawless, transporting you into an intense story of pure loneliness.. pure longing.. pure desperation. And do I even need to bring up the production on this song? The way it flows back and forth between each ear like a pendulum? It's simply gorgeous the whole way through. - **Mudkip1**

Pendulum is an absolute songwriting masterpiece that excels in nearly every way. The song uses minimalism perfectly, starting off with light electronic percussion and Barnett's vocals being processed to absolute death. It's a slow build-up to an amazing chorus that feels like a release of breath and tension underneath waves of synths. The bridge into the final chorus is absolutely brilliant when paired with the video, and it feels so utterly futuristic and engaging like no other song has affected me before. It's perfect. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**cloudbustingmp3** (11): literally one of the most beautiful yet devastating songs i've ever heard. "how does it feel to have me thinking about you?" makes my stomach drop and my heart hurt, but i love it still

**FranklyTheTurtle** (11): "How does it feel to have me thinking about you" is such a simple lyric but it's just so good. This song is hauntingly lonely

**nooodisaster** (11): "So lonely trying to be yours." This is my 11, and if anything, I'm underrating the fuck out of it. If you can't relate to this song, I envy you. First of all, this song is BOP-TROPOLIS. Everything in the production is tilting just on the edge of control. The tripping percussion at the beginning, the stinging synths in the background, and then the sad swelling into the chorus. This is a song where everything seems deliberate, restrained. And then THE BRIDGE happens. Suddenly there's a cacophony of twigs vibrating in your ear drugs, each one snatching another of your wigs. It gets me every time. twigs' high notes at the end are just icing on this million dollar cake. But what really connects me to this song are the lyrics. While this song is more about a failing relationship, the message was so applicable to me one winter when I was chasing after someone who didn't love me back. When you're lonely, it's easy to create a fantasy world you stay in, and you start to neglect the real one. I listened to this song in the darkness, and I connected her words. "Lately I'm not so present now". "How does it feel to have me thinking about you?  Wishing my words were enough to consume you". "When you're looking for so much more." Stunning.

**SAlNTJUDE** (11): my favorite song, ever. the yearning, the buildup, the expression, desperation, and release... I cant even explain how immaculate this song is. "So lonely trying to be yours..."

**stansymash** (11): https://imgur.com/A7AIu7d

**chipsi1** (10): i went to a mcdonalds and ronald mcdonald was bald and also turned into a gay pride icon what's going on

**MrSwearword** (10): the ‚ÄúWater Me‚Äù of LP1 but slays in its own right.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): i i i i i i i i i i

**zenits** (10): "this ends the perfect streak" "jokes on you it's back" is truly a theme for me in this rate

**melodyllic\_** (9): these harmonies are everything!! the vocals are front and centre, which perfectly contrasts with 'hours', where they're integrated. especially love how she tricks us by performing the vocal run that leads into the chorus but not actually going into the chorus

**afancysandwich** (8.5): This song goes. When the end pics up, I'm feeling myself.

**Masta-Blasta** (8.5): Definitely her best vocals, IMO. The video is also wonderful.

**robbiec\_** (8): I used to dislike this song and I have no reason why but the video was course correction for me thankfully

**monalisafrank** (7.7): this hits on some similar themes as grimes in her album, like about trying to live up to collaborators/producers expectations of you. i just don't think the lyrics are as deep as when grimes tackles it

**shineflyer** (6.5): that clattering moving between audio channels is pretty cool

thenshecamelikeaaah: This fucking bias by the Grimes stans I knew it. Imagine thinking LP1 is a bad album, let alone giving Pendulum anything less than like a 9. Maybe if the album got an 8.8 BNM from Pitchfork in 2015 maybe the sub would able to appreciate for what it is, an electronic R&B album that took some real risks in it's production and hooks rather than being a "relatable" album because everyone knows that's all what it takes for people to like music nowadays, artists have to be regular people just like the rest of us and if they present themselves as anything else it's too pretentious.

Mudkip1: # #7: [Grimes - Butterfly](https://imgur.com/lElRZ7M) &nbsp; [](#grimes)

This song is everything! After becoming obsessed with Venus Fly, this was the second song on the album that really clicked for me. Butterfly is such a lovely conclusion to Art Angels: the childlike playfulness of this song fills it with so much energy. Her uplifting spirit carries you throughout the entire track, leaving you dancing uncontrollably with no intention to stop. - **Mudkip1**

I actually really love the sample on this. It's fun trance pop that's absolutely saccharine. It feels like futuristic kindergarteners trapped inside a Nintendo DS. Does that make sense? It probably doesn't. This song is kind of beyond the stratosphere in a way. I'm trying to think of cool things to say about this song. The chorus is good. Just read my comment below for this, okay? Holy shit, that guitar part just came in with the "I'll never be your dream girl" bit. What the fuck? That's amazing. This is a 10, I'm sorry everybody. This is a psychedelic dance-pop masterpiece. Dreamy shit. Liz Fraser is shaking.

Read my comment below, by the way. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**Masta-Blasta** (11): I know this song is going to get dragged, but it might be the loveliest pop song I have ever heard. It‚Äôs so bright, and the melody is intoxicating. It almost reminds me a bit of ace of base at times. I really appreciate how Claire uses throbbing basslines and the little shrieks to tone down the sugary-sweet melody and vocals. The video is also gorgeous. If you haven‚Äôt, I really recommend listening to the instrumental of this track. The entire song is comprised of a single sample that she adds and detracts from throughout it‚Äôs entirety. I think this is the track that really showcases her brilliance as a producer.

**awryj** (10): Honestly, I have no idea what score should I give this song. The chorus is great, the guitars are perfectly funky, the last chorus is orgasmic, but it all feels sorta awkward and just doesn't match. I might regret this 10 later, but it's such a weird song and it's so cool and I can't help but like it.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i'll never be ur dream gorl

**E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb** (10): Find the instrumental version of this song and listen to all the little intricacies in it, and I guarantee you'll love it even more.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): This is super euphoric, and I love how her voice soars in the chorus.

**HalfAlienRobot** (10): sorry, another 10, I can't stop. I love this song. except you lot ruined some of these lyrics for me bc I can't unhear "Old man get lost take a shit maybe not" now. but anyway, this is just the best celebration of pop music: "Oh no / It came / Higher than an aeroplane / Don't know / This song / Sweeter than a sugar cane / Are you looking for a harmony? / There is harmony in everything."

**kappyko** (9.5): I like the choo choo ha ha I am a train. "take a shit"

**ncd46** (9.5): Take a shiiiitt maybe notttt

**triptoyourheart** (9): Instead of making a comment like ‚ÄúMariah outsold‚Äù, I just wanna say that Mariah is one of Grimes‚Äô main influences and she said hearing Mariah‚Äôs music for the first time made her want to make music herself!

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Those screams of death are such an earworm, omfg.

**ExtraEater** (8): I feel like I'm stuck in an office at a fun water park and I'm trying to entertain myself with catchy beats to pass the time. There's a nice ease to the instrumentals throughout, even as it gets more explosive, and it ultimately serves as a sweet, appropriate outro (to the standard).

**Leixander** (8): A good closer track. "I will never be your dream girl." is one of the best closer lines since "Let them talk." from Pure Heroine.

Mudkip1: # #6: [St. Vincent - Digital Witness](https://imgur.com/p6rLsgv) &nbsp; [](#annie)

**Average:** 8.661 **// Total Points:** 840.1 **// Controversy:** 1.545**// [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mVAxUMuhz98)**

Digital Witness is such an incredible metaphor for the current state social media is in. She includes so many iconic lyrics about how people thrive on needing other people to see what they're doing 24/7. 'If I can't show it / If you can't see me / What's the point of doing anything?' she mockingly asks the listener, who probably just updated their Facebook status or shared a Snapchat story with their 64 friends, half of whom they've probably not seen in person for months. Everyone is so consumed by their screens, making everything public and nothing personal. She closes the song by pleading, 'Won't somebody sell me back to me?' begging anyone out there who's listening to help her get back the privacy that she now desperately longs for. - **Mudkip1**

---

Okay, so, here's how I discovered St. Vincent.

People on /mu/ loved calling this hoe her waifu, right?

People would spam the fuck out of "PEOPLE TURN THE TV ON IT LOOKS JUST LIKE A WINDOW".

I knew she was kind of a quirky indie pop queen.

So, I expected some cute guitar-led pop, with some Feist-esque vocals.

Imagine the surprise 13-year-old me got when he heard Annie yelling at him to sit his ass down over fucking processed horns.

I was shaking.

But I wanted more.

And here I am!

This song is processed, robotic, and yet still so rough and raw with the guitars and compression. Annie Clark's gray-haired cult leader persona comes through here, demanding everybody to give her their minds. The brass players that somehow survived the lethal sessions between Annie Clark and Talking Heads frontman David Byrne for the record *Love This Giant* are now trapped in Annie's basement, and she has held them hostage to play apocalyptic Mark Ronson.

And you all put this synth funk jam at #6?

Sexy Albert Einstein deserves better than you all. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**dirdbub** (11): "YATH"

**frankiefrankiefrank** (11): The transition from the verse with the horns to the pre-chorus with the synths is genius. I might be throwing away my 11 BUT I DON‚ÄôT CARE.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): probably my favorite St. Vincent track ever, a subtle and wonderful critique on modern technology on top of one of the best beats of the last half-decade. ‚ÄúPeople turn the TV on it looks just like a window.‚Äù A literal bopsterpiece.

**afancysandwich** (10): I jumped into the album after being obsessed with Love This Giant and the horn-like synths are my favorite. This song really sums up the coffeehouse-record-for-your-black-mirror-style-dystopia.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): digital WIGness

**E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb** (10): "Holy fuck" is all I can say

**eklxtreme** (10): this is subtle but I love how sticatto and short each horn note is. it makes that melody really memorable and annie's odd lyricism brings the track together nicely.

**stansymash** (10): i would call this the horniest track if it weren't for lp1 haha horns

**melodyllic\_** (9.5): probably the most single-worthy track. a strong brass section, great vocals & distinctly memorable chorus? instant jam. (also the subject matter tho!! have never felt more personally attacked annie wtf)

**AFlyingWhale\_** (9): i watched 4 episodes of black mirror this weekend, this song is EXTREMELY TOPICAL

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): what's the point of even sleeping, what's the point of doing anything? this is relatable to the point where it could be called a personal attack.

**whatareblackhole** (8): The horns took my wig! And I had to read some analysis of this song to really Get It, but I get it now and I‚Äôm here for it.

**Masta-Blasta** (6.5): video freaked me the f out. You know that scene in Willy Wonka where they go through the tunnel? That‚Äôs how I felt watching this video. Song is okay but nothing too special; don‚Äôt @ me.

>*St. Vincent - St. Vincent is the kind of album that transcends its origins and reputation, entering the realm of legend -- it's an album that simply exists outside of criticism and outside of its time, even if it thoroughly captures its era. Prior to this LP, Annie Clark was moderately successful, but here she turned into a full-fledged phenomenon, with St. Vincent becoming the biggest-selling pop album to date. While its chart success was historic, much of the legend surrounding the record is born from her internal turmoil. Unlike most artists, St. Vincent in the mid-'70s was professionally and romantically intertwined, with no less than six female love interests in the band, but as her professional career took off, her personal side unraveled.*

Mudkip1: # #5: [Grimes - RealiTi (Demo)](https://imgur.com/ceOZOuY) &nbsp; [](#grimes)

Releasing this song to thank her fans was such a sweet gesture, and her humbleness that came with it turned out to be one of the most surprising things about this whole song. Here's Grimes, apologizing to her fans for the 'poor quality' of this track, and that she 'did her best to salvage it.' Immediately upon playing she punches you in the gut with powerful drums, a catchy beat, and happy-go-lucky claps that are honestly mesmerizing. It truly is one of her most extraordinary songs. I'm left with a feeling of nostalgia after listening, but it's the kind of happy nostalgia that splashes a yearnful smile across your face along with a longing for the past, and the innocence that came with it.

There's a lot I could say about this song but the comments some of you left really say more than I ever could.  - **Mudkip1**

In hindsight, I should have given this a higher score than I did. It's not *Art Angels*, exactly, but it's pretty. The buzzing synths are very *Visions*, her vocals serve 4AD dream pop, and she sounds like she's fading into the pointillist pop soundscape. It's gorgeous, it's entrancing, and God, did this deserve a better take than the *Art Angels* version. Every slight strum, every tiny synth has thought put into it, and it proves that Grimes can pull off minimalist-sounding pop just as much as she can pull off the rabid, loud bangers on *Art Angels*.

And I mean minimalist *sounding*, by the way. There's a lot in this that you don't take in on first listen, but it's so meticulously set out that it's probably a definitive song of the decade. This sounds like it should be on an end-of-decade best-of list alongside "Everything Is Embarrassing". - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**1313Harbor** (11): My favorite pop song of all time. Demo version is superior.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (11): Claire's best song ever, period. i'm really sad that she lost her original files, but even in its messy, doctored (her words) state, it's still incredible. the REALiTi demo made me fall in love with Grimes' music, and it has everything i love about her - her ethereal vocals, the rich synths, the percussion that's just enough but not too much, and all the little production flourishes so typical of her. it flows perfectly, and there's something new every listen. and the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N9XKLqGqwLA) is beautiful and was partly shot in my country!! i'm running out of adjectives. i can't describe how much i love this song.

**shineflyer** (11): This is one of those songs that have become a part of me, that connects with me on a deep level. It's got a beat to it, which gives it drive, and yet it's so sad, mournful even. Trying to move forward, despite all the sadness you feel every day. It stirs up a lot of emotion in me.

**zenits** (11): the best track grimes has ever released, 2015 soty

**cyborglilith** (10): This demo is the perfect transition from Visions to Art Angels. It‚Äôs too poopy to be on Visions, but it contains all the good mysterious and messy elements. The pulsing production is patient for Grimes to continue singing, and Grimes in turn also waits for it to finish. The production is muffled, which sounds more natural than the final version. I also love the train-like sounds, which seem to symbolize something deeper and awakens a different side of me that I like but don‚Äôt seem to understand. Throwing away the dramatic descriptions, the train sound simply reminds me of an aesthetic scene I play in my mind whenever I hear its mysteriousness, much like a certain long-lost ambient sound that sometimes plays in Minecraft when you‚Äôre underground. Obviously, Grimes did not intend for her song to sound like Minecraft, but this is just what I associate the song with because I‚Äôm extra. If there‚Äôs one thing we can agree on, it‚Äôs that this is a bop.

**E-B-Gb-Ab-Bb** (10): This version has a more melancholy feel than the album version, though I like how it sounds in C minor rather than the album version's C# minor

**robbiec\_** (10): SUPERIOR BETTER ICONIC

**whatareblackhole** (10): I always say that the album version is for my wedding and the demo is for my funeral. I really love this version of this song.

**rickikardashian** (7.5): There‚Äôs many changes in this demo, but the most significant one is how she says ‚Äú*reality*‚Äù

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): a demo

**nooodisaster** (6.5): I feel like this is the "Han shot first" of the Grimes fandom, but to me they sound basically the same, this just has lower audio quality.

Perfection in song form. As the previous contender for my 11, Venus Fly is the reason why I love Grimes. It's the reason why I was still so fascinated by her even though I at first found the rest of the album to be underwhelming. It's the reason why I kept giving Grimes chance after chance, knowing that there was clearly something special about her. Perhaps she's just too strange for my taste? What am I missing that so many people understood? Venus Fly was my light at the end of the tunnel. The loud, jaw dropping beat mixed with Grimes' and Janelle's adorable yet ferocious vocals complement each other well, almost too well. Venus Fly is the perfect example of a daring pop song that convinces you to keep coming back for more. - **Mudkip1** (also, hi /u/janellemonae !) <3

Grimes doing Baltimore club/ballroom music is definitely an unexpected turn for the record, but inviting Janelle Mon√°e on it as well? That's wild. And she isn't even invited to croon or provide soulful vocals, like on fun.'s "We Are Young"! She's MCing the fuck out of this dance track, as both Mon√°e and Boucher vogue the world down. The violin playing adds an elegance to the track that normally wouldn't even be an element considered for something like this, but on *Art Angels*, this is solely Grimes' creation. And her mind told her to do what she wants: something wonderfully feminine, something gorgeously girl-power, and something to snatch wigs worldwide.

Video is stunning anime fantasy shit go check it out when u can but fuck Tidal - **kappyko**

The antithesis to the rest of Grimes' discography, Kill V. Maim is just as much of an achievement as all the other songs on Art Angels. Created as a way to prove to her peers that she's capable of producing an insane, intense, hyper track, Claire does all of that and more. Here, she channels all of her lovely quirkiness into something demonstrably unique. This is a song you can't help but maniacally shout the lyrics to. It's hard not to rave erratically like a crazy freak while listening. There's an awesome Song Exploder podcast showing how Grimes put Kill V. Maim together, introducing just how finely tuned it all is. She even added layers to the song that are almost inaudible to the listener, like the sound of a crowd cheering mixed in with the drum beat to make it feel more energetic. Cute touches to the song show just how much love Grimes has for her music, and these in particular are why Kill V. Maim did so well in this rate. - **Mudkip1**

"Kill v. Maim" is *the* centerpiece of *Art Angels*, whether you like it or not. It's the song that got people talking about this record past 2015, it's the track that made sensitive hipsters crawl on the ground searching for their beanies, and it's the track that kind of defines the world that Boucher resides in now. There is very little to say about this track that hasn't been said, but it's electroclash that bests the likes of... well, any electroclash artist, really. "Kill v. Maim" is harajuku cheerleader riot grrrl hype music that is absolutely danceable. It sounds like she legitimately has a band behind her, pounding at these drums and guitars, but it's all the product of Miss Boucher herself, which is absolutely stunning. The lyrics are a little corny with the context of "gender-shifting Al Pacino", but who cares? This song is absolutely bananas, and the fact it remains catchy with some of the hardest to discern lyrics ever written is an achievement on its own. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**chipsi1** (11): WOOOOO! one of my favorite songs of all time, this gender changing space traveling bop is Grimes's best song

**PendulumThief** (11): Call me when you find a more iconic song than one about a gender-bending space travelling vampiric Al Pacino

**zamomattel** (11): whew whew whew. This song is so epic, honestly pretty accessible and bloody weird. I just wish the video matched the LEVEL of the song

**bbfan132** (10): queen of pretending to be a godfather character

**BiPolarBear17** (10): The rightful rate winner but some sad flops will sabotage it and try to desperately justify doing so with "it's overrated‚Ñ¢ !!!!" and not with any actual genuine criticism just like they did with Drew Barrymore in the r&b rate.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): [GAY SCREAMING]

**dirdbub** (10): HEY! ANOV8! ANOV8!

**Kaylaboe** (10): i‚Äôve listened to this for ages but i still have no idea how the hook/chorus goes. v-e-h-h-v a vessel! tell me i‚Äôm a monster, looking so precious! claire, queen of poor enunciation

**melodyllic\_** (10): an absolute blast of energy and colour + the instant standout from art angels imo. it's deliriously exciting, frenzied & an little glimpse into the organised, ingenious chaos in grimes' brain. sorta like an colourful explosion of art on a canvas but in musical form. can you find someone else who writes songs through the perspective of a vampire who can switch gender and travel through space?? didnt think so.

**PoppySeedK** (10): can we get an album of just Kill V Maims? predicting this wins the rate

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Absolute batshit insanity in the best way. The concept for this song is just so ridiculous that only Grimes can pull it off, and she does. I almost spit out my drink when I read a song about a gender-bending time-travelling gangster vampire would be on the album, but HOLY SHIT does it slap. It‚Äôs one of the most unhinged, unequivocally catchy, undeniably fun songs on the album, and as a result, it‚Äôs flawless. A serious 11 contender, from the B E H A V E hook, to the pure absurdity of it all, only Grimes would do this, and only she would succeed.

**triptoyourheart** (10): can‚Äôt not give this a 10 and this will probably win even though I hope it doesn‚Äôt just for the sake of a surprise win.

# #2: [Grimes - Flesh Without Blood](https://imgur.com/ZwuP4Lt) &nbsp; [](#grimes)

**Average:** 9.246 **// Total Points:** 896.9 **// Controversy:** 1.190**// [Listen here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tv9YoYCKNoE)**

How wonderfully structured! How perfectly crafted! Flesh Without Blood is a sheer accomplishment; Grimes takes her soft, sometimes outspoken lyrics and blends them together with such powerful instrumentation and does so with nothing but confidence. You can tangibly feel the energy pouring through every note, every decision, every vocal layer. Grimes possesses a talent and rigor that not many others in the music industry seem to have. This song is so unmistakably unique and so quintessentially her while still holding a keen respect for her old work. Flesh Without Blood is a thank you letter, but at the same time an acknowledgement that she's moving on to bigger and better things. Grimes has shown the world that she still owns her music, and if you can't recognize the triumph in that then I don't know how else to explain it to you. - **Mudkip1**

I have to let Mud speak on this one for me, because I honestly can't say much about this track! It's gorgeous, well-produced, she sounds right. It's like the typical *Art Angels* track, pulled off with a sheen of such class that it just stands out spectacularly. Nobody could hate this. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**banananaise** (11): unCONtroLLABLE uuuuUUUUUUUUUuuuuUUUuuuuUUUUUH

**bbfan132** (11): production is amazing, lyrics are amazing, everything is amazing, grimes is the queen of amazing

**Kaylaboe** (11): such a good track. the video is such a vibe, and this is just popfection

**1313Harbor** (10): The second Grimes song I ever loved, which is what really got me hooked. I committed myself to learning all of the lyrics, and I was lost to the power of Grimes from then on. I love that it‚Äôs about a friendship going sour - more personally relatable to me than the millions of songs about romantic relationships ending.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (10): the best lead single released in the history of ever. it's catchy as fuck, the writing and production are both fucking sublime, and the [video](https://youtu.be/Tv9YoYCKNoE) is something amazing. the perfect primer to Claire's newer music.

**ExtraEater** (10): It is hardly a surprise we see in the music video for ‚ÄòFlesh Without Blood‚Äô a besmeared vision of Marie Antoinette, nor that Grimes studied neuroscience at university. It is the feeling of standing in the shade on a hot day, the castle in the distance, the sky a domed lapis lazuli which one might pluck and offer to the princess.

**LuckyKidA** (10): that part at 2:30 where the song fades out and comes back in is top tits

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): I initially hated this song upon release, and there‚Äôs a comment somewhere in /r/indieheads where I said this sounded like it belonged in Kohl‚Äôs or JCPenney‚Äôs. I stand by that, but this song is all the better for it I realize. I was hesitant of the pop direction, but it ends up working here incredibly well, with her production being crisp and snappy (that whip crack, so good).

**zenits** (10): it's that time of the rate where i just give everything a 10 for a while

**melodyllic\_** (9): a definition of a synthpop banger imo. there's a real sense of propulsion and movement throughout the whole song which keeps things exciting, and that chorus is such a grower!! a really nice counterpart to kill v. maim's frantic electronica

**nooodisaster** (9): "If you had any chance, you'd destroy everything that you know." This was randomly my most played song of 2016, so I have to stan. There's so much anger and sadness wrapped up in wonderful sarcasm.  But there's also moments where Grimes feels so exposed, like shes's just trying her best to explain herself.

**stansymash** (9): i love the way she says 'uncontrollable'. it makes me feel uncontrollable (:

**monalisafrank** (8.5): groovy, smooth, fun track. i really love the way she blends the bridge and chorus together to punch up the ending

> *Art Angels is the kind of album that transcends its origins and reputation, entering the realm of legend -- it's an album that simply exists outside of criticism and outside of its time, even if it thoroughly captures its era. Prior to this LP, Claire Boucher was moderately successful, but here she turned into a full-fledged phenomenon, with Art Angels becoming the biggest-selling pop album to date. While its chart success was historic, much of the legend surrounding the record is born from her internal turmoil. Unlike most artists, Grimes in the mid-'70s was professionally and romantically intertwined, with no less than zero ghostwriters in the band, but as her professional career took off, her personal side unraveled.*

&nbsp;

>> Favorite Review: **ExtraEater**: An aural fantasy. A Pre-Raphaelite with a DeviantArt account creating ‚ÄòBeautiful Forest‚Äô concept art and new character designs for Oberon and Titania. If Grimes represents our ‚Äòpost-genre‚Äô future perhaps her greatest achievement is the reconciliation between the Romantic ‚Äì her mercurial voice, her melodies, her airy strings, the album cover ‚Äì with the Classical ‚Äì her methods, her synthesizers, her sublimation of art to technology. Eden refurbished by a landscape architect of rococo sympathies. It is hardly a surprise we see in the music video for ‚ÄòFlesh Without Blood‚Äô a besmeared vision of Marie Antoinette, nor that Grimes studied neuroscience at university. It is the feeling of standing in the shade on a hot day, the castle in the distance, the sky a domed lapis lazuli which one might pluck and offer to the princess. Kate Bush raised on RPGs and mercantile re-renderings of Lord of the Rings. The promise glimpsed in the Zelda-inflected opening of ‚ÄòAll We Ever Look For.‚Äô It is the nostalgic somehow made futuristic; the staunch materialist finally accepting spirituality.

Ah, we love a rate winner! [](#twigs)

This song had a wild ride. Staying at #1 for 90% of the rate, Two Weeks basically just pulled a Slumber Party. Well, it actually almost didn't. A few days before the deadline Flesh Without Blood actually pulled ahead by a few points until Two Weeks regained the top spot the night before. kappy and i were freaking out over how close it was that whole week, lol

Even if you don't like miss Twigs I don't think you could still claim that this is a bad song. It has just enough to make your pussy pop yet also make you wonder why music like this even exists in the first place, and why it's taken you so long to discover such beauty. It's so different, yet so accessible. Her effortlessness is intriguing, sensual, and magical. It's difficult to make a song so breathtaking and passionate yet here she is making it look easy! The way she breathes confident, tantalizing lyrics like 'I can fuck you better than her' or 'High motherfucker, get your mouth open, you know you're mine' perfectly demonstrates how well she's mastered her craft. You know you're doing something right when you're able to make a gay man question their sexuality. - **Mudkip1**

[](#twigs)

There's sometimes *that* song that stands out in an album almost weirdly. Examples include "Primadonna", "The Mother We Share", and "Royals", songs that just feel *poised* for stardom amongst several tracks. This song is amongst that league, but that is not at all to discredit the work in *LP1*. There's such a realization of pop perfection in this that you can seldom find elsewhere, and a moment of absolute beauty that comes without the twists and turns of the record's other moments. It's ensnaring R&B with the hints of UK bass behind Barnett's gorgeous, powerful vocals.

/u/MrSwearword's comment used a particularly effective word that I liked; Barnett sounds *lethal*. Her vocals are commanding and powerful, and sexually dominant lyrics only help her sound like the goddess she is. If "Butterfly" is flying on a cute airplane through the sky, "Two Weeks" is blasting through space and time itself. A galactic experience of the perfect high, this song is warped enough to fit in the record conceptually yet poppy enough to clearly make everybody love it as much as they did. The cinematic video certainly helps her, as she looks like an Egyptian goddess being serviced by her human servants. When *LP1* was released, it felt like every R&B singer afterwards was trying to reach the highs of this. But we all know by now that twigs is beyond the label of R&B. She is an artist, a queen, and a goddess. And a winner.

FKA twigs is a force to be reckoned with, and this win feels like righteous justice after her album was destroyed as badly as it was. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**eklxtreme** (11): the melodies in this are beautiful, the womping synths are orgasmic, and her high notes in this just complete the song.

**MaydayPvZ** (11): This song is how I found FKA Twigs, amazing!!!

**monalisafrank** (11): i fucking adore this song. sexy, emotional, incredible production, doesn't sound like it has aged a single damn day. this song makes me feel so powerful omg i live!!!!!!!!! the end of the bridge!!!!!! i die.

**MrSwearword** (11): gorgeous production mixed with fabulously seductive but lethal vocals.

**PuggleMaster** (11): A FUCKING SONG FROM A FUCKING LEGEND!!!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): I don't wanna exaggerate but this might be the sexiest song ever made and the thought of it not winning saddens me bigly.

**VodkaInsipido** (11): My 11 in this rate, a masterpiece of raw R&B with that shines in everything: that autotuned and harmonical falsetto, her flow and that ear-candy chorus.

**Altiondsols** (10): Who would have thought that there were so many ways to compare infidelity to dentistry? 

[](#twigs)

**frankiefrankiefrank** (10): The lyrics feel real even though she doesn‚Äôt actually give any personal details, and the breathlessness of her delivery is so intimate-sounding.

**melodyllic\_** (10): the song that got me into twigs' stuff is coincidentally her most pop-oriented song. (even saying pop in the same sentence as twigs is weird) anyway, despite being her most melodic/least instrumentally jarring song the chords and melodies are so dark and sultry!! and the lyrics tho! murderous queen

**SAlNTJUDE** (10): encapsulates unrequited lust and envy: somehow desperate and sexy at the same time

**therokinrolla** (10): the fucking transition to the chorus fuck me up, one of the best hooks of all time

[](#twigs) **stansymash (9.6): this song probably won right. if it didn't don't feature this comment, i am infallible**

**awryj** (9.5): so sex must be pretty cool huh

[](#twigs)

**nooodisaster** (9): "Give me two weeks, you won't recognize her" WIG. This is like if Michelangelo painted some harcore porn, it's so fucking classy yet soooo slutty. We stan.

**Masta-Blasta** (8): Obviously this track bangs. It‚Äôs slightly slow for me, but the beat and structure are quite accessible. Her choice of swear words really sound great against the chill production. I would love to see her collab with Abel.

> *LP1 is the kind of album that transcends its origins and reputation, entering the realm of legend -- it's an album that simply exists outside of criticism and outside of its time, even if it thoroughly captures its era. Prior to this LP, Tahliah Debrett Barnett was moderately successful, but here she turned into a full-fledged phenomenon, with LP1 becoming the biggest-selling pop album to date. While its chart success was historic, much of the legend surrounding the record is born from her internal turmoil. Unlike most artists, FKA Twigs in the mid-'70s was professionally and romantically intertwined, with no less than twelve dancers in the band, but as her professional career took off, her personal side unraveled.*

Therokinrolla: # POPHEADS WITHOUT GRIMES STANS

[Verse 1]

You rate, you cry, you lose

Now I just don't like you

Remember when we used to say

"I love you" almost every day

I saw some taste in you

But it left when you made Annie lose

I never liked Grimes anyways

[Pre-Chorus]

Aye yeah, aye yeah

Aye, I don't see the taste I saw in you before

And no, I don't

And no, I don't

And no, I don't need you in this sub anymore

[Chorus]

(Now you should go)

Sweaties, believe me

And you had every chance

You destroyed St. Vincent's average

(And I blame you)

Yea we don't need you

Just to let you know

[Verse 2]

You rig, you win, we lose

After all, you just don't who

Is the one with a Grammy

WHY DID YOU END ANNIE

Your voice, her skill, is all subpar

And now you've just gone way too far

Cause you want win illegally

[Pre-Chorus]

Aye yeah, aye yeah

Aye, I don't see the taste I saw in you before

And no, I don't

And no, I don't

And no, I don't need you in this sub anymore

[Chorus]

(Now you should go)

Sweaties, believe me

And you had every chance

You destroyed St. Vincent's average

(And I blame you)

Yea we don't need you

Just to let you know

[Bridge]

Ooh, ooh

Hey, hey, Annie's dead baby

Talent lost once again  bye-bye fka twigs

Now you've won cause you rigged

Add it to the list of bad things Grimes did

Hey, hey, oh no

(Then my heart beats underground now)

[Chorus]

(Now you should go)

Sweaties, believe me

And you had every chance

You destroyed St. Vincent's average

(And I blame you)

Yea we don't need you

Just to let you know

deleted: In retrospect your rate was a really well thought out rate. I can't think of another three pop artists who would have a fanbase that overlaps as much as these three. Good job guys

Wish we could do a Nicolas Jaar - Space is Only Noise vs. Oneohtrix Point Never - Garden of Delete vs James Blake - James Blake rate. It would probably be cohesive (and also amazing) but it would probably get like 5 participants lol

deleted: Goodbye r/popheads. I don't think I can spend one more second in such a toxic and bigoted environment. Congratulations, everyone for hating women. 

And congratulations to both of you, /u/Mudkip1 and /u/kappyko, for rigging this rate by having voting during Christmas vacation, thereby ensuring only nerds would vote, meaning that the cool, stylish, and fashionable people that encompass everyone that thinks Grimes should have won didn't have time for the rate, and being too busy with the opening parties for our new clubs and accompanying our actor boyfriends to their new movie premiers.

deleted: Its a shitpost. 

I was actually writing up my submission a couple days before it was due and then accidentally closed the window and was annoyed enough at myself that I just didn't want to make it again. I spent quite a lot of time on it as well :(.

Therokinrolla: despite the subpar taste displayed today, this rate has been absolutely one of the best rates yet and incredibly well done. Thank you /u/mudkip1 and /u/kappyko!!!!!

Mudkip1: grims had almost the entire top 15 i think she's still sitting pretty [](#annie)
[/r/popheads/comments/7qe4dw/rate_reveal_realiti_art_pop_rate_day_3_two_twinks/dsozk62/]

=====

SpaceGenesis: But she didn't win... I'm a bit disappointed. [On a specific PopJustice rate](http://forum.popjustice.com/threads/yeah-yeah-uh-huh-ooh-yeah-the-alt-pop-girls-rate-winner.62094/), Grimes also dominated and won #3 (REALiTi), #2 (Kill V. Maim) and #1 (Flesh Without Blood). And the competition was fiercer, with 6 albums in total.

On a bright side, I started getting more into FKA Twigs' music, thanks to this rate. Previously I found her music to be quite boring. I was already a fan of Annie, so I gave her mostly big ratings.
