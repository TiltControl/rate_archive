Have you ever tried S&M? Well, apparently Annie Clark has quite often, judging by some of her lyrical content (see: "Chloe in the Afternoon"). "Bring Me Your Loves" is a noisy, sleazy new wave track that channels the best of David Byrne, a prior collaborator and vocalist for Talking Heads. Her vocals are dripping in the personalities of '80s new wave, as she chants her way through the jungle of the punkish rock she's laid out. The guitar work on this is superb, channeling a robot goddess alongside the wavering dial-up synthesizers. Her talent of showmanship on this track washes away any doubt that she's getting too soft, with a frantic vocal performance that will either freak out or entice listeners. Either way, Clark's only doing her job right. - **kappyko**

to be honest, just watch the link attached to 'Listen Here'. That'll explain everything you need to know about this one. - **Mudkip1**

**Favorite Comments**

**lunasaflowers** (11): This song is just so sonically fascinating and twisted and ALIEN-- this song blew me away the first time I heard this album. Loooooove this!

**BiPolarBear17** (10): This makes me wanna stick my head inside a toaster and headbang

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.9): I thought this song was just alright but then the guitar kicked in and it was everything.

**monalisafrank** (8.7): love the straight up wonky guitars on this, also we love a polyamory bop

**eklxtreme** (8.5): I love the complete chaos in this track and how it still manages to be kinda catchy.

**stansymash** (8.5): i don't know what this instruction means but i am going to try my hardest

**whatareblackhole** (8): This song is BATSHIT, and it totally sells me on how she says that this album is, like, from the perspective of a futuristic cult leader, which is a really interesting way to think of yourself in the context of a relationship…

**thenshecamelikeaaah (7): ok**

This is another song that suffers from the classic 'just a bit too long' complaint. The chorus in this song is snatch-worthy but at what cost? It's literally one sentence repeated over and over in between these long, painful verses that go nowhere. - **Mudkip1**

The production to this is absolutely hypnotic, with the sifting synths in both channels as FKA twigs' ominous vocals blow between them. The chorus hits and the song becomes an entrancing chant of breathing out "ache, ache, ache...". It's gorgeous, and albeit the fact that not much happens, it's still something that hinted at what greatness Barnett had in her. - **kappyko**

**Leixander** (9): holy shit the production in this!!! not really fun fact: I always misread this song's title as Acne.

**melodyllic\_** (9): an underrated highlight!! this track is pretty much the precursor to much of lp1, with the sorta-annoying too-loud-but-just-right samples and the repeated, oddly catchy chorus. the 'i ache for you' is prime material for voguing btw (i've tried many times)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): ugh another sensual bop. I need to fuck to this.

**monalisafrank** (8.8): this might have to go on my sex playlist, there are several twigs songs on there

Just so this doesn’t get out of hand lemme say this: 

- I’m not trying to start a fight, this is stan twitter basically in a forum

- I don’t find anything about Grimes’ album Artangels that makes it deserve the amazing praise it gets. 

The mixing is poor, and the production and lyrics sound juvenile often, and sometimes coming off as faux-edgy. I’ve read about Grimes and her artistry is amazing, and the amount of instruments she learned going into this album shows her talent, but the album ended up becoming a jumbled up mess as far as cohesiveness and overall sound. My average for the album was 6.72. I didn’t hate it, but it just fell short so often that I don’t see how 10 tracks deserve to be this high at all.
[/r/popheads/comments/7q6en2/rate_reveal_realiti_art_pop_rate_day_2_get_back/dsnfczv/]

=====

SpaceGenesis: To each his own. Grimes tried to make Art Angels an eclectic album, so don't expect cohesiveness. You can find enough cohesiveness on her older albums. By the way, try al least her album Visions.

"Belly of the Beat" is Grimes' cute take on some sort of folk pop, and it works, for the most part, quite decently! Her sense of melody is apt, and the wordless vocals are endearing. "Everybody dies, we anoint their eyes, and we dance like angels do" is way too catchy for a phrase so dark, and the more relaxed vibe is a nice break from the loud electropop production that permeates this record. - **kappyko**

This song's just alright to me. It's pretty plain for Grimes' standards but it's a nice track to put in between Flesh Without Blood and Kill V. Maim. It's sort of like an intermission for the album so that the listener can catch a breath before the rest of the album really kicks in. - **Mudkip1**

**1313Harbor** (10): Belly of the Bop

**Leixander** (10): I must admit I didn't like the song at my first few listens back in 2015. Now it is one of my favorites because of its chilly vibe and cute lyrics.

**monalisafrank** (10): okay i absolutely love this one. the lil guitar and the sweet lyrics about escaping pain and death into music just make me ache. really simply pretty.

**PoppySeedK** (10): grimes does folk rock better than mumford and sons

**robbiec\_** (10): this also makes me feel clean

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.4): Props to Grimes for making a bop about death and existentialism.

**awryj** (8): These lyrics resonate deeply with me, since I'm sure that heaven is physically contained within the waveform of the Carly x Charli x Lorde collab

**triptoyourheart** (8): And what about your post history? Constant delusional stanning for the most mediocre pop star we have ever had. Why not talk about Michael for a change? Are you just protecting yourself when you use him as your flair, like a token "black friend." What are your top five songs on HIStory?

**ExtraEater** (7): A carnival of greed depicted in each juggler's ball of a beat. Does not the 'belly of the beat' symbolize the unrelenting divergence of the disparity between idiomatic phrases and their near-banal witticisms that emerge from it? Is it not erroneous that this makes me feel happy? Do I feel manipulated by the personified impetus of the belly of 'belly of the beat''s beat? As temporal forms artistically revealed within each texture become reconfigured through boundaried and personal practice, the viewer is left with a testament to the possibilities of our happy (or rid of happy) future.

In one of the most divisive things Grimes has done in her career, she takes a strange turn on the song Go: not producing it! *Gasp!* Fans of her immediately thought she was over – that she has lost her creative fuel – that this combined with her scrapped album meant that the world was ending and that Grimes had no sense of direction. I would assume these reasons are also why the song is so low.. I honestly don't see what's so bad about this song. It's not as good as most of the material on Art Angels but the EDM production is still very cool. - **Mudkip1**

Mudkip pretty much said all I wanted to say, but a collaboration that Grimes has done with Blood Diamonds prior to this one, [Phone Sex](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxmCvdY4NZQ), is such a beautiful, interesting precursor to tropical pop that's more novel than any hit to take from the sound. A gorgeous combination of steel drums and atmospheric vocals that serves such a strong contrast to *this*, a trap bop intended for Rihanna's use. It's abrasive, and a bit dull for my tastes, but it sure is *something*. There's an attempt at some ethereality that's clear with the instrumentals used in this, but it all kind of gets wiped away with that unfortunately rather bland drop. - **kappyko**

**Altiondsols** (10): This song is the 3rd degree of separation between Justin Bieber and Aristophanes

**BiPolarBear17** (10): On release I woulda had this down at like an 8, however hearing this live was an out of body experience and has made me come around to it big time.

**Leixander** (10): WHEN I GO CAN I GO WITH YOU? Blood Diamonds, or BloodPop's peak production! The last minute of this is literally legendary.

**cyborglilith** (9.9): I love how the song gradually builds up, but the production is a little repetitive sometimes. The spoken “Blood Diamonds” in the song is a nice addition.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): It took me a while to get into this track, as it felt like a late entry into the dubstep scene, but I think I have more appreciation for it now that the dust has settled with that. The production is great, and I think the drop works really well and has actually aged very nicely. I always wonder what would have come of this album if we got this version instead of the one we got, and I honestly think it would be better than Art Angels.

**frankiefrankiefrank** (8.2): I like it, but it probably would've worked better with Rihanna.

**chipsi1** (8): okay bye rihanna miss claire didn't really need you anyways

**nooodisaster** (7.5): When I heard this song I thought "yep its pretty deccent", not "wow, this is going to create backlash so huge the artist will spend half her next album addressing it"

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): invented dubstep

**AFlyingWhale\_** (6.5): ahhh, go. hmm. it was originally supposed to be for Rihanna, but when Claire recorded and released it herself, her fanbase kinda imploded because wtf of all people Grimes is selling out??????? it was just completely unlike anything she's done before and an abrupt turn toward the mainstream. imagine Aphex Twin making EDM. but besides the backlash, the song itself is pretty ok - i'm not really a fan of the drop and """"chorus"""" though.

**booooam** (6): this could've been so great but that drop already feels outdated

I love St. Vincent's ability to so effortlessly write about the insecurities she faces every day, especially since they're thoughts that so many other people often think about, too. She wakes up every morning hating the sunlight, and compares her awful memories to the bright light. It's always there, always reminding her of the things she did wrong, or was too afraid to do. Regrets are hard to deal with and even harder to ignore. - **Mudkip1**

The fact that this iconic bop is so low is so fucking weird, especially since it's a track I find to be a highlight. The hypnotic guitar tones are very rich and pretty, and after each verses some more acoustic strumming opens to a choral hook that feels like, I don't know, opening up a garden or some shit. That sounds cool so I'm keeping that. It's a lot more lush and pretty than any other track on this album, and the lyric "I'm afraid of heaven because I can't stand the heights / I'm afraid of you because I can't be left behind" is among the most poignant on the record. - **kappyko**

um, but I thought that the vision of severed crossed fingers were..  
was very powerful. you're really, you're really hoping right until the end that it works out

&nbsp;

but it doesn't

**\- Mudkip1**

This song serves as a great contrast to the opener, "Rattlesnake", a fun, twisted, electropop track, by being rather drab balladry that feels like a combination of the prettier aspects of "Regret" and "I Prefer Your Love". It's not bad, but it feels rather... pointless? It's folksy, sure, but it feels that this record could've had a bit more of a fun end than something trying to be triumphant or emotional. - **kappyko**

i really like the chorus to this one but it gets old quick in my opinion. it's also really self-explanatory – she wants to be closer to her lover so why not repeat it until he understands? it's very kinky and sensual and you can tell that she's ready to submit to her man. someone went ham on a writeup for this on Genius so i'll link a lil bit of a part that i liked **- Mudkip1**

>*This song is a superb example of FKA’s extreme versatility, and pushback against being pigeonholed as an RnB artist... The language of this song (‘Now I yearn to follow you’; ‘Eternal darkness’; ‘savior’) is quintessentially hymnal. An obvious comparison is the language of ‘Amazing Grace’: ‘I once was lost, but now am found, was blind but now I see.’*

>*This track, along with ‘Pendulum,’ is perhaps album’s best example of what FKA can do with her transcendent voice.*

FKA twigs has always been eager to throw off the "alternative R&B" label, citing her diverse influences, and feels that they come from a racially charged place. Her vocals on this track show a strain against this label, instead featuring a gorgeous church choir cadence that builds against this gorgeous instrumental of distorted electronic synths rather than the soulful voice expected of her. It's artistically one of the most daring things she's done, in my opinion, and it shows that the concept of genre really is hard to apply to musicians when artistry extends past simple labels of style. - **kappyko**

"Huey Newton" is, in my opinion, the peak of Annie's songwriting on her album, and it's a shame to see it out so soon. The song cleverly plays off the atmospheric mood of "Prince Johnny", and the first half almost appears to be another ballad. The first section of “Huey Newton” is full of mellow synths and militaristic drumbeats that outline Clark’s vague yet gorgeously evocative lyrics, as her vocals slowly grow tenser along with the wavering synths. Disillusionment with technology is a huge theme of St. Vincent, and the lyrics to the first half are a psychedelic reimagining of Internet browsing which kind of speaks to me. Nowadays, information comes so quickly, and the quick flashes of related imagery (“Hale-Bopp, hail Mary, hail Hagia Sophia”) feels like a succinct realization of how this deluge of content is broadcast to us every day. The tension of the song slowly builds as Clark reaches her vocal climax, and then it gets into that fucking wonderful second section. The electronics fly around until Annie’s vicious guitar snaps into action, bringing the song from the soft intro to a Joan Jett-esque foot-stomper, as Clark screams out against her signature noisy guitars. It’s such a wonderfully structured and written track, so it deserved my 11. - **kappyko**

**awryj** (10): Drug fueled dreams after spending the whole winter in front of a screen? Can relate.

**lunasaflowers** (10): This was the first or second St. Vincent track I ever heard, IIRC, and it's glorious. It's amazing throughout, but the switch-up of the melody into more noisy and guitar-shredding territory at the end of this song snatches me EVERY TIME! Such a great fucking track.

**monalisafrank** (10): the dopest song ever about depression internet binges, does anyone have a playlist of songs like this lol

**triptoyourheart** (10): The way the second half crumbles into a rush of heavy synths and guitars ughhhhhh

**VodkaInsipido** (10): [me when the guitars kick in](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/358112268233342976/383875179987861504/ozqMI6U.gif)

**stansymash** (9.8): the switch up in the middle is maybe the best moment of my entire life and that includes being born, every single birthday, every single christmas and that's pretty much it, i don't have many great moments.

**eklxtreme** (8): it gets good in the second half where everything feels intense and bloody. is this song about the black panthers? I can't decipher her lyrics.

**Masta-Blasta** (8): Another decent track that’s interesting without being weird. It’s glitchy but not obnoxiously so, like some of her other songs. Probably my favorite of the rate .

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): looooove the turn this song takes in the second half

**Arybeck67** (7.1): don't like the beat at all, but lyrics are cool

**camirose** (7): this song ends nowhere near where it started that’s interesting

**Raykel** (7): I love when that meshed guitar comes in. The rest of the song can choke.

**rickikardashian** (7): i want to know what a fuckless porn shark is

**nooodisaster** (4.5): "every line is tied to the next in a way that I don’t even understand" wow, thats so deeeeeep

'Tell me.. what do I do when you're not here? What do I do when you're not here?' FKA Twigs asks, begging for answers. Well, turns out she knows the answers, cause the rest of the lyrics in Kicks are all about masturbating. Who doesn't enjoy masturbating? Here, FKA Twigs embraces her independence, realizing she can please herself better than her old lover ever could. I agree with some of the comments that this bop could've been shorter but I still love the subtle production and the occasional ASMR I get from her whispering.

If you're interested in a fun fact about this song: Kicks sat in the lower top 10 in this rate for like, a solid week. Peaked at #6 with a 9.057 average lol. - **Mudkip1**

There are really some fantastic videos of choreography to this track on YouTube. Vogue and ballroom influences are deep in Barnett's production, and the beatwork on "Kicks" is fantastic. The percussion strikes so harshly on this, the synths hum discordantly along the vocal samples, and Barnett somehow pulls it all together into a coherent structure. There's this really cool high-pitched sample that reminds me of like, chipmunks. Figured that's worth noting, but this really is quality stuff. This deserved a higher score from me in hindsight. - **kappyko**

**melodyllic\_** (11): Definitely my favourite twigs song. It just captures the atmosphere and sensuality of the entire album, as well as her willingness to combine traditional structures with random, but fitting influences. Especially love the second chorus (i guess anti-chorus), where she builds up suspense and then leaves the instrumental hanging. The 'what do i do when you're not here' line is just so damn hypnotic!! I feel like this song will not get its deserved adoration tho, and that makes me sad :(

**chipsi1** (10): men are useless x

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): "what do i do when you're not here?" i dont know i'm not psychic!.gif

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): her vocals are so good in this

**Masta-Blasta** (8): Sometimes I think she just throws shit at the wall and is like “this is a song now.” I can’t figure this song out but I like most of it .

**SAlNTJUDE** (8): little bit long but its so necessary after going on that journey of an album

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): great closer for a great album

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): i actually cant tell if this is good music

**frankiefrankiefrank** (6.3): This song could be cut in half and it’d still be too long.

**camirose** (5): I really like half of the parts in the song but then it cuts off and gets boring and drags on too long in between verses

No disrespect to the queen, but Madonna has made plenty of mistakes in her career. Whether it's trying to act or the existence of "American Life", the queen Madge herself is no stranger to odd career choices. One mistake she ought to be kicking herself for, though, is passing on the gorgeous melodies found within the romantic "Psychopath", written by Annie Clark. "Psychopath" is probably one of the songs that makes the second half of the (in my opinion) rather front-loaded St. Vincent worth hearing. Romance is a topic that Clark has always had her own unique perspective on, and on "Psychopath" she realizes a twisted love story to a gorgeous pop melody. The song plods along on a propulsive electronic beat, reminiscent of quickly paced footsteps, as Clark pants heavily. The chorus is soaring, as the vocals turn to romantic soundtrack-worthy crooning backed by an orchestral arrangement. Clark's sense of groove is at play here excellently, as the guitarwork and motorik beat complement each other like partners throughout the instrumental portions. "Psychopath" is some of the prettiest pop Clark has come up with, and Madonna will certainly be hoping to achieve something like this in the future. - **kappyko**

lol i don't think either of us like this song enough to really wanna write something up for it. i LOVE the video for it, though. FKA Twigs really did *that* when it comes to the video, where she watches an inmate get euthanized and then dances around the room soon after. Seeing her gyrate on his dead body while craning her neck to sing into the microphone is a really insane visual. It's one of the reasons why so many people can't get enough of Twigs' crazy, unpredictable style. 

If anyone's interested in some sort of explanation to what the fuck is happening in the video here's a neat theory I found online; (it might not be true though, hence the word theory)

> A.B. (the tattoo on the inmate's neck) commonly refers to the white supremacist group, the "Aryan Brotherhood," and being that the inmate has a shaved head, I would assert that he is a skinhead guilty of a hate crime, probably murder since he is being put to death. His victim was the the ethnically African man that had blood coming out of his mouth. FKA Twigs' character must have been close to the victim and is allowed to witness the execution from behind the glass. Her dancing character is a dark angel of sorts, and will usher the inmate to the appropriate place in the afterlife.

\- **Mudkip1**

oh jk kappy ended up writing a lil bit <3

"Video Girl" is one of the most popular songs from the album, but it's easily the worst for me. Barnett takes the accessibility of "Two Weeks" and instead pairs its conventionality with bland melodic content and uninspiring production, and this is easily to her own detriment. The lyrics are somewhat interesting, but it's hard to remain intrigued by her work when she can release something as unfortunately bland. Honestly, though? I'd be ashamed if the only thing I was known for was dancing in a Jessie J video too. - **kappyko**

**booooam** (11): idk this feels like the best track of the album

**whatareblackhole** (11): Video Girl, for me, is where LP1 really hits its stride. This is where I file my missing wig report, ESPECIALLY BECAUSE OF THIS VIDEO

**shineflyer** (10): This is definitely my favorite song from FKA twigs. It's got a beat, but also an atmosphere, which is what I look for in a great song. It's got such a sad, defeated feeling to it.

**zamomattel** (9): youtube is a national problem

**Arybeck67** (8.8): one of FKA Twigs most confessional songs, I really like it and relate to her on this track

**Masta-Blasta** (8.5): Yasss. The video is also incredible. The death drop at 3:16 is iconic.

**melodyllic\_** (8.3): MURDEROUS QUEEN RETURNS! a slinky, prowling jam with a chorus that sounds like someone slowed the track down to 1.5x. probably not as catchy as lights on or two weeks but interesting enough to continue the storyline

**ncd46** (8): This feels like it could have been a top 40 hit if it was released in 2017, even more so than Two Weeks.

**AFlyingWhale\_** (7): Swinging in the backyard/Pull up in your fast car/Whistling my name/Open up a beer/And you say, get over here/And play a video game

**robbiec\_** (7): this was the first song of hers I ever heard and I used to dig it but I think I'm sick of it now. It has some overkill aspects too

**SAlNTJUDE** (7): least favorite on LP1 (there has to be one I guess) its really good, but feels crammed into the album and just doesnt fit

**piccprincess** (4): Beyonce is shook

"Lights On" is fucking post-industrial sleaze R&B at its best. The production on this is absolutely sublime and hypnotic, and the production blurs the line between abstract electronics and organic instrumentation seamlessly. It's disorienting, yet also one of the catchiest songs Barnett has made in her career, with an irresistible hook that's as sensual as it is mysterious. If "Preface" is dipping your toes into the world of FKA twigs, "Lights On" is your first dive into the ocean of LP1. The sounds in here are noisy and strange, and the crashing noise that this track becomes by the end leads right into the poppiest track almost for a reason, as if Barnett is testing us in how much we can handle her music at some of its most complex and confusing. "Lights On" teeters the line between ugly and beautiful, and I think this contrast is what makes the music on LP1 so unique in comparison to other, more standard R&B and pop artists. - **kappyko**

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): i adore how this song builds up. it starts so simple, but evolves to these really distorted instrumentals that i LOVE

**melodyllic\_** (9): absolutely in love with how twigs mixes traditional melodies with such weird, random samples and sounds. the random horn in the beginning on top of the beautiful marimba? the sorta-sounds-like-a-flute drop after? amazing stuff. and that chorus is so hypnotic. LOVE IT

I absolutely adore this track. Even though my last.fm disagrees, Rattlesnake was the first St. Vincent song that I remember listening to, and it was such an incredible introduction to her discography. The production and flow on this track is so unique and it separated her from anything else I'd listened to before. Her voice in this song is raw, untamed, and magnificent. She jots her thoughts down in succinct lyrics and captures the fear and wonder of the strange experience she went through. Most people would never think twice about wanting to wander the barren Texan landscape while butt ass naked, but St. Vincent makes it sound fun. - **Mudkip1**

St. Vincent develops from an electropop backing and immediately starts the record out with some of the weirdest shit this side of the universe. Lyrically, she sheds all her clothes in the middle of the desert, but aesthetically and musically it's clear that she's also shed the dramatic mix of perversion and demureness of her previous records for a newfound sense for '80s and '70s art rock and songwriting. This is probably the most forefront usage of distorted synths, yet it's kind of the sound she explored most thoroughly on her follow-up record, *MASSEDUCTION*. However, here the electro groove manifests itself as raw, unpolished, and messy. It's as seductive as any serpent in the garden of Eden, and it snatches listeners into the head of Clark as it develops into a chaotic groove that leads to a crazy guitar solo courtesy of Miss Vincent herself. God bless. - **kappyko**

**triptoyourheart** (11): This is a flawless song. The frantic and pounding synths, Annie’s quirky delivery of the verses and hooks and that distorted guitar solo at the end. The first St Vincent song I ever heard and it made me a fan on the first listen.

**chipsi1** (10): WO-O-O-O-O-O-O O

**MaydayPvZ** (10): Best opening track ever.

**piccprincess** (10): lookin like a mf rattlesnack

**eklxtreme** (9.5): very catchy despite being so abrasive and weird. annie paints the scene well with the lyrics and it strangely works as an opener.

**melodyllic\_** (9): the quintessential st vincent bop, but in the wackiest way possible. queen of remaining catchy while talking about being the only one on earth and using cool vocal distortion stuff!!

**PoppySeedK** (9): The negative space in this song is dope

**awryj** (8.8): I love it how when she hears the rattling sound, the line "I'm not the only one in the only world" is sung an octave higher, as if she shrieked in terror

**monalisafrank** (8.4): I like this as an opener because it paints a picture and the beat is fun but also gives her a lot to expand from.

**Kaylaboe (8): [insert taylor joke]**

**whatareblackhole** (8): I love this and I love it as an opener. Bitch is running away as her opening message? Brilliant.

**lunasaflowers** (7.5): I love the jumpy, jittery production on this track-- it really sets the tone for the rest of this album very well.

**SAlNTJUDE** (7): dancing alone in my room realness

We love an upbeat, religious bop! Some of this is a little bit confusing but I think this mainly is about how Annie valued (and, at times, took for granted) her mother's love. She includes a lot of really neat callouts to the Bible, like when she yells, 'Show me your stones / I'm just a bad believer' likely referring to how being stoned to death was a frequent punishment back then. I could see myself twerking to this during Mass. - **Mudkip1**

Lowkey, I kind of hate this, but it's also dumb fun, so I can't fault it. It's easily the poppiest track to result from the record, but at least " feels like it fits on the album itself. However, it suffers from being a bit obnoxious and edging into conventionality a bit. The bridge with just vocals and drum machines is symptom of this, but it sounds cool. I get why people liked this, but above "Rattlesnake"? Come on. - **kappyko**

**Average:** 7.991 **// Total Points:** 775.1 **// Controversy:** 1.898

Jesus Christ I love this vogue bop! This song is just so fucking *erotic* and satisfying. I adore the way she sings, especially in this song. Her voice is soft like velvet and coarses through your veins until you feel it in every part of your body. If you haven't felt like getting up and vogueing to this absolute masterpiece than there's definitely something wrong with you. - **Mudkip1**

idk why mud didn't make the title of this "FUNK wav" but whatever

This song is entrancing FKA twigs and I honestly can't say much more than that. The "away, away" crooning is so pretty. - **kappyko**

**Favorite Comments**

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): where's that video of her voguing and picking up her mic

**FranklyTheTurtle** (10): I've never wanted to slut drop more than I do listening to this song

**Kaylaboe** (10): pure bliss

**Raykel** (10): This is the bop all sluts deserve!!! Omg and someone tell me what those little ascending dings in the 2nd half of the chorus are! It's so simple but adds so much to the song.

**robbiec\_** (10): THIS NARROWLY MISSED MY ELEVEN. SO NARROW. Like I said for Hours, it's everything exceptional about her. The instrumental is sensual and emotive. Anyway, if you haven't seen her perform this live, I highly HIGHLY recommend you check out her Glastonbury performance (the eleven minute one) on Youtube. She kills ME.

**SAlNTJUDE** (10): really really difficult for me to choose between this and pendulum for the eleven, the brooding vogue vibe is what heaven sounds like

**VodkaInsipido** (10): the beat is what I think heaven sounds like

**whatareblackhole** (10): OoOoOh this is all of the best elements of twigs in one moment. Lyrics, production, vocals…I’m gone

**Arybeck67** (9.4): by far my favorite song on the album. I just get caught up in the intricate story FKA is telling, with the beat just immersing me in the song even more

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): i'm a HUGE fan of the structure of this song, which uses the buildup/drop technique to great effect. the transition can be a bit jarring at first but i got used to it after a while.

**zamomattel** (8.5): this was the first song i heard from the album and it's something for twigs to be proud of

**camirose** (8): I like the vocal delivery a lot on this

**eklxtreme** (8): props to her for making a minimalist version of what many trap r&b songs sound like today.

**ncd46** (7): Vibey but not SUPER memorable. I don't know why but it reminds me a bit of Shape by Glasser

**shineflyer** (7): That escalating synth during the chorus is really cool.

**awryj** (0): #justiceforsuchgreatheights **i agree that it deserved better but also ??? - Mudkip1**
