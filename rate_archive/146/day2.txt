**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Would you believe it if I told you that, prior to this year, Grande Amore had the highest amount of televotes of all time? Il Volo received almost 80% of the possible televotes they could've received, and they *still* only came third due to the juries tanking them (reason to hate the juries number 1000...). Even if you don't like this song, you can't deny that the vocals in this are truely astounding, and it's crazy that an opera song had never been performed on Eurovision prior to this. Still, this is *pop*heads after all, and opera isn't exactly something most people are looking for, hence it being our first elimination of the day. 

**racloves** (6): not the type of music I would listen to, but you can’t deny that amazing vocals

---
# Great Love
**apatel27** (10): Damn these boys can sing

**BebeLuigi** (10): The best part of this live performance is that you continuously hear the public screaming haha they were all ready to die for them and I don't blame them

**daretheghost** (10): So grand and gorgeous.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Don Giovanni has been real quiet since this dropped, potentially because he’s in hell

**emmaelf** (10): those harmonies are so fantastic. it feels very big-band era and i would have loved even more instrumentals but it is an excellent example of slower songs keeping focus and attention.

**jaztinax** (10): i am so weak for male pop opera trios

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): Maybe the most epic and colossal sounding song to be performed on the Eurovision stage, it was a monumental showing from the Italian boys. Oh, the drama of it all.

**seanderlust** (10): GRANDE AMOOOOREEEEEEEEE :kirbyyell:

**sirpancakeXI** (10): should have won the whole thing

**awkward\_penguin** (9.5): Their vocals were a bit shaky, but......HAH who am I kidding, that was a vocal masterclass. Fucking cool as hell. And the song was interesting!

**No-Place-to-Go** (9.5): I think this Italian epic should have won that year. I’m glad it didn’t, though. We would have missed out on Sweden hosting Eurovision in 2016.

**thedoublebanana** (9.5): Musically this was the song that should've won. Italy really had some great moments since their return, but this was top tier moment.

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): "If Barbara Pravi - Voilà is the Frenchiest French song the French ever France'd, Il Volo's - Grande Amore is the Italianest Italian song the Italians ever Italy'd" - Eduardo Rodriguez, YouTube (2019)

**speaknowred** (9.4): They are Il Volo

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh this builds alright

**ImADudeDuh** (9): why do they look like if fun. was made up of italian chads https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/81p2S+3el-L._SL1500_.jpg

**iniekcja\_** (9): the middle aged moms are still going crazy to this day

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this is more fun than the supposed electronic bop

**afs** (8.5): she's so titalian

**akanewasright** (8): GOD these vocalists

**criestotheclicking** (8): very Italian lol, technically impressive but a little boring.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The vocals really sell this one

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): the DRAMA of it all, love it

**noideawhatever** (8): this is one of the most italian songs i've ever listened to. also really impressive voices.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): it’s really good but slightly overrated. Italy didn’t deserve their win for this

**skargardin** (8): ok vocals!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): why is the piano riff like one key away from Someone Like You

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I mean it’s a good opera song? But like why would I want to listen to this compared to anything else on this list?

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): the most italian song ever made

**DefaultPophead** (6.2): I feel like I'm being marched to my death but I like it!

**happyletuce06** (6): kinda boring imo

**Kaylaboe** (6): anyways latvia and belgium outsold

**moonagenightmares** (6): this is so italian

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): i feel like 2 of these guys think they’re hotter than they actually are

**s2pd** (6): The guys can really sing, but the song is just not for me

**TiltControls** (6): technically good, but a bit dull tbh

**welcome2thejam** (6): Sure, I'll give it up for those harmonies

# Bad Romance

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): that’s Amore or whatever Dean Martin said

**CarlieScion** (5): very average

**frogaranaman** (5): great singing voices

**MrSwearword** (5): Italy really thought they were winning with something this boring, didn't they...

**Smuckles** (5): My mum's favourite Eurovision song, probably

**vayyiqra** (5): Feeling a little bad because these guys are very good singers I just don't care for the song itself.

**Stryxen** (4): almost accidentally pressed 3 as well and tried to give this a 43

**thedoctordances1940** (3.6): ou

**bigbigbee** (3.5): When the chorus hits it hits hard, but it takes SO long to get there

**Martin1009** (2.5): So cheesy I turned lactose-intolerant

**Awkward\_King** (2): this was boring shake some ass or somethin

**guy\_like\_u** (2): I hate this. Respect to Italy through for always singing in their beautiful language and no denying those voices

**hannahspants** (2): meh

**Uberpigeon** (1): ajr looking opera singing asses

**ZebraSun73** (1): I have nothing but Grande Hatred for this song. Two things need to be banned from ESC, ukulele is one and opera is the other

**ashandimlotion** (0): how did this get the most televote points ever?!??? I will never understand. Man the top 3 of 2015 SUCKED.

**racloves** (8): Best Azerbaijani entry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): good riddance azerbaijan we hate you and your mediocre songs that still manage to get top 10 placements that definitely aren't influenced by vote bribing 

---
# Always on my mind
**CarlieScion** (10): this is a whole ass bop

**jaztinax** (10): best azerbaijan entry, they will never top this ever

**nootnoot781** (10): maybe straight people do deserve rights

**ZebraSun73** (9): Bring back Arash

**speaknowred** (8.6): A bop

**afs** (8.5): honestly she stole the show even the cameraman treated the guy like a backup dancer

**veryanniev** (8.5): 2009 was truly a battle of titans

**CrimsonROSET** (8): come on slut drop

**emmaelf** (8): this was way better than i thought it would be going into it. the performance was solid. the song was catchy. there were timed pyrotechnics.

**s2pd** (8): banger

**skargardin** (8): omg NO this performance unlocked a deep hidden memory of me not getting this damned chorus out of my head

**Smuckles** (8): Ooo that's catchy. And camp! They're putting a lot of energy into this one, I'm into it.

**throwaway-7650** (8): she's outdoing her man so bad starting w/ the hair

**TiltControls** (8): Chorus was a little repetitive, but I love it otherwise

**itsabop** (7.7): Much stronger than the song that ultimately gave Azerbaijan their 1st victory

**apatel27** (7.5): You know shits gonna slap when someone pulls out an instrument mid performance

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): deserved the riggory in their favour

**Martin1009** (7.5): bop

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): always on my mind

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): they could've at least painted the little raised stage so it didn't look like a budget kids playground was accidentally left on stage

**BebeLuigi** (7): Always on my mind truly

**iniekcja\_** (7): asexual anthem

**MrSwearword** (7): cute but a bit boring, but kii at Azerbaijan and their male female duos (this is the one where the diva here looks like Natalie from Girlicious)

**musical\_pyn** (7): started really strong but couldn't keep it up (instrument solo is a nice touch)

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): not as good as many claim, but very fun. Maybe I’m too young to have nostalgia for the 2000s but songs like these sound too dated for me. This reminded me of what a very good song from 2005 would sound like

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This has a lot of traits in common with songs that I enjoy but it doesn’t quite click

**happyletuce06** (6.5): has not aged that well

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): this was okay. in studio

**moonagenightmares** (6.5): mid but the folk instruments slay so bumping it up a point

**seanderlust** (6.3): the best part of this performance is the dancers change my mind

**shhhneak** (6.1): Wind machine, take a shot.

**criestotheclicking** (6): this feels what people talk about when they say a ‘typical eurovision song’. Not a bad thing.

# Never

**daretheghost** (6): I don’t know that Arash has the charisma needed to carry as much of this song as he needs to.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): it’s giving dinner theater on a cruise

**guy\_like\_u** (6): a fun twist on the Pervy old man / sexy young girl trope

**LunaMoonMeUp** (6): Feels like I'm gonna have some digestion issues from all this cheese. But much like eating too much cheese in real life... it's worth it. It's just fun.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): the way these two have no chemistry ctfu

**Uberpigeon** (6): ive expressed explictly my contempt for eurovision

**vayyiqra** (6): kinda bops

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Don’t care for it that much

**awkward\_penguin** (5.7): It feels like the song is going somewhere, but there's no climax.

**Stryxen** (5.4): an explosion of mid-ness

**Awkward\_King** (5): girl hes gay

**frogaranaman** (5): this is cute?

**thedoublebanana** (5): There was so much potential here, but just fell short with the execusion.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Great instrumental bridge carry job

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): yeah this is just mid

**akanewasright** (4): “always on my mind” girl I forgot about this 10 seconds after it was done

**DefaultPophead** (2.3): I lost my comment for this song and that was probably for the best because I was bullying them.

**hannahspants** (2): also yawn

**racloves** (8): best Russian entry in ESC history. Incredible staging

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): But WHAT a performance this song is. You Are the Only One is already a pretty good pop song on its own, but Sergey's live performance is an absolute MARVEL to the eyes, with some smart projection work and seemingly levitating in the air at points. I'm disappointed at how low this scored, but I ultimately can't be too mad at it, considering that when you take away the live performance, the song itself is nothing too special. Here's to praying for Sergey and his family in Russia and that they'll be safe.

---
# Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting!
**frogaranaman** (11): THIS SONG GOT ME INTO EUROVISION. I saw the live performance of this on Youtube and rewatched it ten times in a row. it's SO good. I hope y'all don't rob it (but y'all definitely will because), either way I'M SO HAPPY IT GOT PUT IN THIS RATE

**akanewasright** (10): holy FUCK… I know it’s glass but how do you even hide that

**ashandimlotion** (10): if this was measured by sheer drive in the performance this would by my 11. Sergey looked absolutely exhausted by the end of this absolutely outstanding performance. I feel like this is the perfect representation of how the OTT nature of these performances is sooo camp.

**GapeCod** (10): The stage design is made of the same material as his closet.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): ***LET’S GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!***

**sirpancakeXI** (10): hope him and his family are ok

**skargardin** (10): this staging is so fucking iconic

**Stryxen** (10): the DRAMA he’s serving, that man is gay i really believe that

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I support this king and I hope that he and his family are safe!

**afs** (9): those effects are UNREALL

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): this is kinda yassified coldplay

**hannahspants** (9): another run of the mill pop song but this was incredible staging

**LesApfels** (9): Some of his other songs like Take It Off or В Эпицентре are much stronger than this one but oh well

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): easily russia's best song on the list

**awkward\_penguin** (8.8): People are very confused when I randomly throw in "Thunder and lightning, it's getting exciting" into conversations, but it's fine.

**speaknowred** (8.7): The staging is awesome

**daretheghost** (8): I don’t know what to say about this one so I’ll just give it a score that feels right and leave it at that.

**MrSwearword** (8): Sergey is pretty, but it's another staging doing the heavy lifting here. Also, the kii of this man doing Eurovision twice and coming third both times.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): this discount heroes at least has the stepping on the projection thing

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is so extra but I like it

**seanderlust** (7.3): okay that key change got me. that was cool

**criestotheclicking** (7): a son of Måns, clearly - I still don’t know how he did the stairs illusion. And I shouldn’t like the line ‘thunder and lightning it’s getting exciting’ as much as I do but hey.

**emmaelf** (7): strange tempo change. cool wings. i always remember the incredible staging more than the song though.

**iniekcja\_** (7): Zelmerlow's evil twin

**moonagenightmares** (7): gay solidarity. I prefer scream tho

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): years ago i got sent a photo of sergey shirtless in a gay club that has since been wiped off the internet

**throwaway-7650** (7): this 5SOS youngblood-ass knockoff

**vayyiqra** (7): Wait this is kind of a jam

**welcome2thejam** (7): Those green screen effects got me messed up, massive kudos to whoever came up with that prop

**apatel27** (6.5): The screen magic was pretty damn good

**No-Place-to-Go** (6.5): The song has always been too theatrical for me, just like his voice. They also wanted to recreate Mans’ success with that stage design, it was too blatant.

**s2pd** (6.5): The song isn't really what stands out here. It's energetic though

**thedoublebanana** (6.5): Mans did it better.

**TiltControls** (6.5): what in the sephiroth

# Thunderbolt and lightning, very very frightening
**happyletuce06** (6): basic song elevated by an absolute wtf of a performance

**Hogwartsreject1912** (6): I fell of my chair with this performance I’ll never forget how shocked I was. Still a mediocre song.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (6): If not for the wonderful staging, do you honestly think this song would be regarded as highly as it is? I sure don't.

**nootnoot781** (6): russia isn’t even that bad when it comes to eurovision but this rate would convince you otherwise.

**plastichaxan** (6): he’s a king but… this is not for me i guess

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Doesn’t really hit as much as the other big songs here

**DefaultPophead** (5.3): I'm not the same, no | I'm not the same, no

**BebeLuigi** (5): The live was really good obviously but yeah not the biggest fan of the song

**flavasavavandal** (5): look I loved the visuals of the performance but the vocals left a lot to be desired

**letsallpoo** (5): STOP WITH THE KEY CHANGES

**Martin1009** (5): Sorry daddy Sergey, but I got so relieved when this song didn't win

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): this is just their 2008 song but at least the visuals are kinda cool

**guy\_like\_u** (4.5): tell me you watched Sweden in 2015 without telling me you watched Sweden in 2015

**Awkward\_King** (4): the staging of this always pissed me off for doing so much but it is kinda a fun bop i cant lie

**veryanniev** (4): Lazarev is one of the few Russian celebrities who actually spoke out against the war, he has a great voice and stage presence but unfortunately I just never liked this song (but at least it’s not as atrocious as Scream)

**CrimsonROSET** (3): theater kid energy [2]

**Kaylaboe** (3): never understood this song

**musical\_pyn** (3): background is cool though, props to the set designers

**Uberpigeon** (3): ok i hate tv screen shenanigans but how the fuck did he do that . this song sucks though

**CarlieScion** (1): you’re the only 1 in the rate haha im very funny

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (1): this is a way too harsh ranking but this song is all style and no substance. It’s a song contest, this getting 3rd was not a fair ranking, many better songs flopped for this 😑

**shhhneak** (1): Not the gay vote pandering ooh they were evil for this one.

**racloves** (10): this is how you use the Eurovision stage.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): Heroes is probably one of the most controversial winners of last decade, with there being an almost even split between people who love this song and people who hate this song. People in the "hate it" category probably also aren't thrilled by Måns' somehow finding a way to perform as an interval act in practically every single contest since his win, which also makes him one of the most controversial contestants as well! Honestly, while I do think this song is somewhat overhated, I can understand all the detractors it has, especially considering just how...boring it feels as winner. And let’s not even get into how this song winning completely ruined what Sweden considers a good Eurovision song and made their entries for the next few years absolutely insufferable…

---
#Heroes
**Awkward\_King** (10): the way this song singlehandedly modernized eurovision and made graphics an entirely new requirement for countries to have to live up to, their mind

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is the theme song to a toxic positivity pyramid scheme company however I am vibing

**guy\_like\_u** (10): Alongside Loreen, this is the most influential performance in ESC history. The way he used the screens, holograms and lighting was breathtaking. Ever since this, you just HAVE to have something unique about your staging or run the risk of being too boring. You see it almost every year now that people are trying to out do this. Even besides the performance though, the song is a real banger and hasn’t aged at all.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): edm songs called heroes just always slap

**afs** (9): yasss teach the boring male pop singers how to be interesting

**noideawhatever** (9): damn this song slaps

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): aw the drawing is cute

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): this literally a track from those *Dark Country* compilation albums (complimentary)

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): the amount of time måns has performed this damn song at subsequent eurovision contests omfg

**speaknowred** (8.4): Not bad but it is not Il Volo

**DirtyRat583** (8.3): really liked the visuals

**BebeLuigi** (8): Honestly it's a very solid pop song and that LED screen staging was amazing especially at the time

**criestotheclicking** (8): the song itself is nothing special but I will admit the staging is really good. Måns is super charismatic and he really sells the song - I’ve never seen a man so happy to dance with the demons

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I mean being pretentious is very Eurovision I think so this works

**hannahspants** (8): we sure are the heroes of our time

**jaztinax** (8): måns is a eurovision treasure

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): I know a lot of people have gone off this song over the years since it won but I still enjoy it, although not as much tbh

**Melody** (8): it just gets better as the song progressives... a 3 to a 8!

**s2pd** (8): I know the show carried it, but it's still a good song with a lot of energy

**throwaway-7650** (8): GREG HEFFLEY FROM DIARY OF A WIMPY KID?

**happyletuce06** (7.5): catchy, sleek and professional, incredible staging

**Martin1009** (7.5): Mums-Måns, I still love you

**thedoublebanana** (7.5): The staging is why this one. The song is not great, but the staging revolutionized staging for the coming years.

**TiltControls** (7.5): this guy and the peggle 2 guy give the same energy cmv

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): ou i forgot about this, it's kinda basic kinda dated but still fun

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this song is just a collection of generic phrases

**moooo566** (7): controversial opinion but it's just okay

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): it’s a fun song but there was better (also Sweden 🤢)

**sirpancakeXI** (7): trying to forget my mans zermerlow phase when i first started watching Eurovision in 2019.

**skargardin** (7): I don't mind it idk

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I wanna like this song more but there’s so many things going against it… the really self-centered vibe of the lyrics, the fake country accent, the fucking kids choir?? I hate kids choirs in pop songs lmao

**veryanniev** (7): it’s a good song but it’s so fucking overplayed, doesn’t help that Måns shows up at pretty much every single Eurovision (although I will say that his win gave us the best hosts this contest has ever seen - Petra Mede, I love you, pls come back)

**ZebraSun73** (7): Not a huge fan of this song but I'm glad Måns won so Sweden got to host the 2016 contest - the best show to date (yes I am smug and Swedish)

**seanderlust** (6.8): he really got up and said "and one more thing...gay rights" after beating russia sjdlkf king shit. the song itself is fine but honestly just listen to aviicii for a better user experience

# Zeroes

**apatel27** (6.5): Can't believe I'm saying this but David Guetta outsold

**babadork** (6.5): This sounds like a commercial, but it is okay.

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): anyways latvia and belgium outsold

**LesApfels** (6.5): Everyone check out his song Cara Mia, it's such a bop

**bigbigbee** (6): This guy looks like an American Idol contestant, and is about as sexless as one. This guy looks like he was cut from the final lineup of Maroon 5. He’s not unattractive, but I was SHOCKED when I heard that TakeOnMeByA-Ha was getting so many thirst comments about him. It’s haunted me ever since. Oh, the song is fine. Wait, this won?

**celladonn** (6): fine but so derivative... this makes me feel nothing

**daretheghost** (6): I am SICK of this song. I am SICK of Mans showing up for everything tangentially related to Eurovision.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): overrated.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (6): Måns is an icon in his own right, and the song is good. But it suffers from what so many modern Swedish songs suffer from: it feels like a perfectly polished pop robot has been put on stage to deliver a radio friendly song. All of the charisma and energy just feels so manufactured and carefully calculated, it's hard not to see the cogs turning in his head.

**vayyiqra** (6): Words cannot tell how happy I am that this isn't a halfassed interpolation of "Heroes" by David Bowie.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Fake deep lyrically, though does that really matter in a song like this?

**DefaultPophead** (5.6): Overrated? Massively. Good? Yeah, it's pretty good.

**moonagenightmares** (5.6): mans is great and all but this is like the most mid song and performance ever

**emmaelf** (5.5): the staging for this is actually pretty cute. the song is fine. very 2015 with a blasting chorus and verses that are only there to get you back to the chorus again.

**Smuckles** (5): Lovely stage show though

**ashandimlotion** (4): cara Mia outsold

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): how did this win it sounds like a boring Avicii deep cut

**nootnoot781** (3): stan petra mede instead!

**fadedblue09** (2): This feels straight out of the Swedish pop factory

**akanewasright** (1): I can name like 5 EDM producers that had made this exact song before, but actually fun and good.

**CarlieScion** (1): avicii rip off fucker

**frogaranaman** (1): from the second this started I knew there would be a background choir in the chorus. gives those rancid vibes

**GapeCod** (1): something about eurovision artists whose names start with Mån makes people overrate them

**you2009** (1): great staging that deserved an actually good song it's so sad...

TakeOnMeByA-ha: # literally begging you people PLEASE be horny somewhere else

**MrSwearword** (10): Eurovision vocals/arrangement >>>>>>>> studio version by a mile but it's still infectious Swedish pop music done correctly. Also, Måns is fucking hot.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I genuinely believe eurovision audiences voted for this purely because Mans is hot (and they were right)

**awkward\_penguin** (9): The song isn't the most interesting in the world, but damn did Sweden kill it in the staging department. Måns is a natural performer, and that shirt fits him quite well...

**iniekcja\_** (6): he was hot as fuck for me at the time but this has been so overplayed

**shhhneak** (0): Mis·an·dry. The way Sweden can employ a man with six abs and coast to a win makes me sick.

**Stryxen** (0): this sounds so flat so dead and just means like… nothing. Fuck this song i would still do unspeakable things to him oop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Poor Occidentali's Karma...one of the many victims of suffering from Eurovision's three-minute limit, as well as some less than stellar staging (I mean, personally I don't think its THAT bad...) ruined what could've been a potential winner of 2017, which is a shame because this song is really such a bop, especially the studio version. In fact, I think I'd go as far to say that this is one of the only songs in the rate that's MUCH better recorded than it is live, given it's longer length and extra lyrics that add to the song's meaning so well.

**racloves** (7): Insert he did it for harambe meme

---
# NAMASTE!

**daretheghost** (11): Abysmal staging be damned, this was my favorite song of the 2017 contest. Just magical. Makes me feel like there’s glitter exploding inside me.

**apatel27** (10): The message, the music, the dancing gorilla

**BebeLuigi** (10): This was also a contender for my 11 I love this song so much. Also he's so hot

**frogaranaman** (10): karma karma karma karma karma chameleonnnn

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): If only it could’ve remained 30 seconds longer

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this rly kinda was the winner that never was huh. it has like all the trademarks a winning song needs it just underperformed a bit, but such a bop. italy have been on such an insane run recently, italy and ukraine consistent as hell

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): the stage presence!! This would be the most lit children’s show ever

**babadork** (9.4): I am too confused by the dancing gorilla in a bow tie to be able to tell if I should think this is offensive.

**happyletuce06** (9): fun!

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): a bop that flopped on stage. The monkey was a nice idea but just looked odd 😩, I’m sorry. The crowd interaction was powerful too

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): banger

**seanderlust** (9): I always hesitate to trust online lyric translations because you're always putting your trust in a lyric translation that i'm not entirely sure how much vetting it goes through. that said, if this translation is right, "pieces of chanel rain on sterile bodies" goes hard af.

**skargardin** (9): bop!

**thedoublebanana** (8.8): Was really hoping this was going to pull the upset to win. It's a fun song and deserved better.

**afs** (8.5): those hands remind me of a really grotesque cricket trophy that had a bunch of arms and hands curling over each other to grope a ball it was horrific I hated it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): this being right before Toy on the playlist is comedy

**awkward\_penguin** (8.2): How can you not like Francesco Gabbani?

**GapeCod** (8): also known as reparations.

**nootnoot781** (8): was 1st in the odds for several months and then they brought the gorilla out 😭still a v fun song

**speaknowred** (8): Fun

**ZebraSun73** (8): Is there some kind of law in Italy that all men have to sing like that

**emmaelf** (7.5): you know what, this cheered me right up.

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): there are so many words here

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): dance monkey dance monkey oh oh oh

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): +1 for gorilla

**criestotheclicking** (7): infamous staging is infamous. You can see the gorilla clambering onstage from the corner of the frame at around 1:22 and that just killed me - there really is no indication to the non-Italian-speaking audience as to why the gorilla is there…and now the gorilla is busting moves during the guitar solo

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I love the message about how shallow popular culture has become and the fetishization/commodification of Asian cultures, but the song itself is kinda grating

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): A fun song with a unique message, brought down by a lacklustre performance - especially compared to San Remo.

**moooo566** (7): im not that keen on the music but i have to give it an extra point for the gorilla

**musical\_pyn** (7): im…not sure what I just watched?

**s2pd** (7): Catchy, but kind of annoying voice

**Stryxen** (7): i think my mind blocked this out of my memory to protect me i can’t remember this song or performance at all but so much is happening

**throwaway-7650** (7): it's giving FIFA world cup theme

**vayyiqra** (7): "We live in a society" - Francesco Gabbani

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Lot of big concepts here

**welcome2thejam** (7): That monkey legit made me question why I do rates. It's not even that weird in the grand scheme of things, but how do I assign a number to what I just saw

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): Italy to ESC 2017: "There’s someone I want you to meet, Her feet are bare at all times. She’s sexy, playful, feral, and free … Her skin is glowing, her lovers are many. I’m completely obsessed with her, and soon you will be too."

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): rome 2017? when i purposefully spread disinformation online

**No-Place-to-Go** (6.5): I’m so glad this flopped. Wasn’t this like constantly the number 1 in the bookies? Loved the man, hated the ape.

**DefaultPophead** (6): I'm still oddly touched 5 years later.

**guy\_like\_u** (6): Italys commitment to doing something completely different and unique every year is truly astonishing

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): can't believe this guy got the wiggles and a gorilla to perform with him omg

**Martin1009** (6): I really thought this would win? Aged pretty badly

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): honestly this is cute, the chorus is an earworm

# Karma's a bitch

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): the fact that this was like the runaway bookies favourite for weeks before the contest was so weird

**TiltControls** (5.5): It's a fun song, I just wish I liked this guy's voice a bit more

**cremeebrulee** (5): not the random namaste

**CrimsonROSET** (5): I feel like I need the lyrics for this one but I’m also not in a place to get them so this is a placeholder on sound alone

**hannahspants** (5): I don't get it

**shhhneak** (4.4): So Italy can send bad songs. Their versatility!

**CarlieScion** (4): this man cannot sing

**Uberpigeon** (4): first things first im the realest

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Upbeat but bland

**celladonn** (3): This just rubs me the wrong way

**2dina3dworld** (2): I’m sorry, but the vocals… ooh, the vocals… I can’t stand the vocals

**ImADudeDuh** (1): why does his voice sound like that

**moonagenightmares** (1): having to listen to this old mans smoker voice was painful enough but then he said sex appeal and i broke out in hives

**MrSwearword** (1): mama, this is garbage

**jaztinax** (7.5): i like this better than her entry last yeari think

**s2pd** (7.5): Earworm

**Kaylaboe** (7): this is basically like rating mata hari. she wasn't gonna let a pandemic stop her from entering this exact song

**LesApfels** (7): I'm still waiting for Efendi to drop a time-travel themed concept album about famous women throughout history

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): Pretty standard girlbop with an ethnic sounding twist. I do prefer her 2021 entry however.

**plastichaxan** (7): kinda camp but you know what’s campier? Nadia Oh’s My Egyptian Lover which you can find in camp classics next cycle yass

**throwaway-7650** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zNfqj5nM9UA > this

**vayyiqra** (7): Idk what I was expecting from this title but it shouldn't have been a surprise it went for a Middle Eastern thing, you know. Anyway this is a weird song but I mostly like it! mostly

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I didn’t know Cleopatra-sama spoke Japanese!

**veryanniev** (6.5): I will never stop loving the way she rolls her r’s

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this is doing so much but I kind of feel nothing?

**welcome2thejam** (6): That was a ride

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): Mata Hari was genuinely a lot better

**daretheghost** (5): The chorus is kind of cool at least.

**hannahspants** (5): yass girl slay

**iniekcja\_** (5): Mata Hari was miles better but this is pure camp

**moonagenightmares** (5): english really makes everything worse and ugly i couldve liked this in another language

**seanderlust** (5): help I thought she said "egyptian aladdin" in the bridge at first and I was like uhhh?

**shhhneak** (5): Maximillion Pegasus when he got the Millennium Eye:

**criestotheclicking** (3): I really dislike both of Efendi’s songs, I find them shallow and not that fun or catchy.

**Martin1009** (3): kinda cringe, but the gays would love it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): my online friend who lives in germany said he knows people who went to the same highschool as lena and they said she was really arogant and stuck up and i gotta say i'm not exactly surprised. song's still a bop though

**racloves** (7): I seem to remember liking this song, but re-listening to it now for the first time in ages, it doesn’t hold up.

# Indie girl voice appreciators 
**Awkward\_King** (10): laurv aur laurv

**DevilsOfLoudun** (10): Lena was so cool and refreshingly normal, reminded me of Duffy.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i don’t give a fuck, this is the cutest song ever made. If carly made this, all of yall would be going crazy for it.

**itsabop** (10): This song is over-hated, absolutely deserved the win, and we stan Lena

**moooo566** (10): i know this song is very loved but it still feels robbed to me, it should be on the level of euphoria in people's minds

**MrSwearword** (10): honestly, this is the cutest thing Germany has ever made.

**nootnoot781** (10): this was my favourite winner for a while, it’s just so catchy.

**nt96** (10): its like a combination Bjork, Aurora and Willow's singing voices. Homegirl is gifted in singing penmanship.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this really started the indie girl voice huh

**Stryxen** (10): MORE LIKE SLAY TONIGHT i was OBSESSED with this it’s so funny and SO good - it’s even camper in retrospect that she’s doing the indie girl voice but that’s just her accent.

**you2009** (10): this song sucks a bit but I'm glad she no longer has to shop it around open mic night and terrorize even more people

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): both the song and the singer were so cute i was happy when this won

**thedoctordances1940** (9.2): god her accent is so funny but it's also just a very good song

**guy\_like\_u** (9): I think this has been unfairly maligned in the past decade. Sure her performance wasn’t the best but this was a great pop song that is really catchy.

**iniekcja\_** (9): the chokehold she had on the radio

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): had no idea this was a eurovision song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Hosts couldn’t change my score after finalizing results but are letting me add this comment: while it’s an earworm, I realized this de-fanged Kate Nash shit is not better than We Could Be the Same, Turkish fans made points!!

**awkward\_penguin** (8): Maybe not the flashiest song or performance ever, but it has a charm. Lena is just a bit awkward, and the lyrics are definitely a bit awkward. But I guess that's why I like it?

**berober04** (8): the best English accent in eurovision history

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait this is so cute

**Martin1009** (8): banger

**noideawhatever** (8): kinda reminds me of lily allen

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): she should have won with Taken by a Stranger, but this is top quality too

**vayyiqra** (8): Ranking of songs with "Satellite" in the title that I know: Hana > Metric > Lena > Dave Matthews Band > Loona > Harry Styles >>>>> Lou Reed

**thedoublebanana** (7.8): Taken by a stranger outsold.

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): funnily enough her 2011 entry is a top tier esc song. this is okay

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): the way i still hear this song in supermarkets in poland…her relevant slay! (btw taken by a stranger >> )

**s2pd** (7.5): Charming

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): ok go off german kate nash

**speaknowred** (7.2): It is alright

**ashandimlotion** (7): the modern winner that has the most “puppet on a string” energy

**BebeLuigi** (7): I like the song she competed with the year after a lot more but it is still very cute

**criestotheclicking** (7): this is peak indie boom. It’s charming to look back on - just the intermittent glockenspiel alone transports me back

**fadedblue09** (7): banger but her voice sounds croaky

**hannahspants** (7): it's not a great song, but the chorus is catchy as hell and Lena sells it hard

**happyletuce06** (7): nice and charming pop song

**jaztinax** (7): i love the song but god her voice…

**plastichaxan** (7): she sings like naur saur traur laurv

**Smuckles** (7): Remember Kate Nash? No reason I'm bringing her up.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): She had a lot of guts putting that underwear line right in the beginning of the song, I'll give her that

# The angry Turkish fans in the YouTube comments

**afs** (6.5): this won...?

**DirtyRat583** (6.5): is she singing in cursive

**astrologicalangel** (6): the song is cute, but I feel like her voice is so unique it could really be put to better use

**emmaelf** (6): she'd do an awful lot for you. i'm confused by what kind of cockney accent she was going for in the spoken sections.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Somehow this feels like the most dated song in the rate

**sirpancakeXI** (6): this is so mid

**veryanniev** (6): I haven’t seen this performance in a loong time, she’s SO fucking awkward it’s kind of endearing?

**GapeCod** (5): oooof... I used to like this!! But I was also 10 at the time!!!! But also it was hard to follow up one of the most iconic winners ever.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): I feel like she's trying to do the indie girl cursive singing thing and it is Not Good

**seanderlust** (5): lena communicating to her crush that she's wearing blue underwear and she will leave her porch light on at her house: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EXGTqHiX0AAnjT6.jpg

**apatel27** (4): Please decide if you want to sound like Kate Nash or not

**ignitethephoenix** (4): I also bought underwear the other day

**skargardin** (4): I think it's time to admit that this isn't the megaserve it was painted to be

**throwaway-7650** (4): lacking in stage presence *and* out of tune? pick a struggle

**2dina3dworld** (3): Lily Allen called, she's sending a cease and desist

**celladonn** (3): WHAT is this voice she's doing

**LunaMoonMeUp** (3): She's putting on too much of an "avocados and bananas" voice from that one Vine, and it's really obnoxious. Her 2011 entry, Taken By a Stranger, is WAY more interesting, has aged phenomenally, and she's doesn't sound like a caricature of an indie artist. That was the song she should have won with.

**shhhneak** (3): Eurovision’s first ever singing in cursive winner!

**indie\_fan\_** (2.9): Sounds like a generic 2000's pop song from an independent artist, but with an even worse voice

**CarlieScion** (2): idk why but every time I listen to this song anger washes over me. the song is so bad 😭

**TiltControls** (2): this is giving first time voice audition more than eurovision entry

**Uberpigeon** (2): shes just singing weird right... like i know german people and they dont talk like that is she just singing weird???

**DefaultPophead** (1.5): Europe let German avacadees win???

**daretheghost** (1): I have always hated everything about this song. Taken By A Stranger outsold.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): I listen to Of Montreal for fun but maybe I’m quirkyphobic after all

**frogaranaman** (1): why is she pronouncing "love" like "naur" 😭

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): reading the YouTube comments made me thirsty because there is too much salt

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): It might be a generic ballad, but personally I still have a soft spot for this. Maybe it's just Yohanna's lovely vocals, or maybe it's the ice themed live performance, but something about this just hits *so* right to me. The fact she was able to come in second in a year when Alexander Rybak was competing basically makes her an honorary winner in my book.

**racloves** (6): It’s kinda generic I’m sorry

---
# True
**BebeLuigi** (10): It's the first eurovision song I ever rooted for live it has a special meaning to me haha

**daretheghost** (10): ROBBED

**Martin1009** (10): i cry everytime

**MrSwearword** (10): Only because Iceland deserves some love here (that country has been fucked over so many times in the bop department, shoutout to Hera Bjork).

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): Fairytale is AMAZING. But I love this. Was my winner. I NEED Iceland to win pleaseeeeee

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): I enjoyed this so much

**thedoublebanana** (10): It was a close call between this and one other song for my 11. One of the best Eurovision ballads of all time.

**throwaway-7650** (10): the cello! it's giving hit k-drama OST [complimentary]

**TiltControls** (10): if statements be like

**itsabop** (9.2): This song is so beautiful and such a strong 2nd place to Rybak

**seanderlust** (9.2): it's contact lenses. they're contact lenses in my eyes yohanna. yes I can show you if you really want to see them.

**iniekcja\_** (9): the Elsa blueprint

**jaztinax** (9): this is the perfect embodiment of an early 2000s nordic singer-songwriter track

**Kaylaboe** (9): the true winner of 2009. after armenia or estonia of course

**veryanniev** (9): I wanna cry this is so nostalgic

**speaknowred** (8.6): Solid 2nd place

**afs** (8.5): holy damn this Eurovision edition was STACKED with vocals

**awkward\_penguin** (8.5): Beautifully sung and a beautiful song. Y'all should also check out the remix!

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): one of my fave ballads.

**emmaelf** (8): as far as eurovision ballads go, this one is really impeccable. nice instrumentation, decent lyrics and well sung. unfortunately, it is still a eurovision ballad.

**nt96** (8): yes it's listenable now stop asking

**s2pd** (8): Lovely song, fantastic performance

**Stryxen** (8): wait this kinda sounds like a bjork Post song (good) nvm this is SO eurovision (has a key change)

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): or false?

**babadork** (7.6): This is all very Disney princess.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): why is the Spotify cover art for this a bad .jpg rip

**shhhneak** (7.5): Sometimes I love the background animations more than the performance. The Lisa Frank dolphin deserved the win.

**DefaultPophead** (7.2): She's so good and pretty and I'm 72% sure she contributed to my internalised racism when I was nine, hence the score.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): the key change stopped me from falling asleep at least

**akanewasright** (7): this is generic but also :sobsing:

**skargardin** (7): her vocal slayage saved this from getting a mediocre score

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Her voice is pretty. That’s all

**welcome2thejam** (7): Yeah, belt that!

**astrologicalangel** (6): the song is alright, but the singer was what made it

**criestotheclicking** (6): good voice, slightly boring song.

**happyletuce06** (6): liked by the fandom, a bit boring to me

**moonagenightmares** (6): this kinda sounds like a demo for the original doll which makes me want to give it a higher score than a ballad this boring probably deserves

**noideawhatever** (6): pretty song, kinda boring though

# False

**frogaranaman** (5): Tame Impala out-true'd

**ashandimlotion** (4.5): how on earth did this place second, Iceland isn’t even that popular of a country at Eurovision

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): there are worse songs here but like this still is not good

**CrimsonROSET** (4): I didn’t say shit

**LunaMoonMeUp** (4): It feels like a cookie-cutter power ballad intended to win Eurovision. The vocals are impeccable but aside from that... ehh.

**vayyiqra** (4): Adult contemporary radio filler I fear.

**apatel27** (3): Ma'am this is a Eurovision

**Smuckles** (3): Christ this is lifeless. I want more techno-polka songs!

**Uberpigeon** (3): no no its true its true

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): if you told me amy adams sang this in enchanted id believe you

**guy\_like\_u** (2): brilliant vocals but the song is so bland and drippy.

**hannahspants** (2): yawn

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): wow this is a snoozefest. thank god alexander rybak was here to prevent her from winning

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): the worst thing a song can be in this rate is boring. Yoahanna you were my rate villain and 0 for the longest time but at least your earnestness is better than the pretentious hack I am tanking

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): In a year where two of the top 3 were emotional black-and-white themed ballads sung in French, Gjon's Tears just couldnt help but fell behind Barbara's stunning dramatics, and he leaves the rate just before the halfway mark. Honestly, I'm kinda upset right now! While it might not be *as* good as Voilà, I still find myself mesmerized by this song and it's performance, the artistry of it all and Gjon's impecable voice. Just *listen* to that note at the climax.

**racloves** (9.5): I’m a ballad anti but this song is gorgeous

---
# The Universe
**ashandimlotion** (10): best ESC male ballad of all time and it’s not even close. The way everyone initially hated the staging but I think it’s my favourite of 2021? And that extra high note he hits in the leaked jury final is sooooo good.

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): I’m still recovering from his vocal theatrics.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): beautiful song with beautiful staging (fight me idc). His high note pierced my soul

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): I just love dramatic shit in French

**guy\_like\_u** (9.5): in a strong year this got lost a little, but you cannot deny the power of this song and the quality of the vocals

**DefaultPophead** (9.2): Boys Do Cry? Yeah I know, Marius Bear. I've seen Gjon's Tears.

**criestotheclicking** (9): I adore how committed Gjon is to this. The artsy dance moves mixed with gun fingers are very much me dancing in my bedroom but he makes them work.

**daretheghost** (9): Did somebody mention art?

**hannahspants** (9): his 2020 song was better but ~that note~ mesmerises me.

**happyletuce06** (9): his vocals are everythingg

**iniekcja\_** (9): wait I forgot he moved, I thought he just stood there

**sirpancakeXI** (9): his dance like how i would dance when i was 8

**Stryxen** (9): i just remember thinking i love this man… and i HAVE to have him

**afs** (8.5): flashing lights !?

**akanewasright** (8.5): he was doing these charli xcx ass movements and I was living for it

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): this is the sexiest thing I've ever seen in my life

**speaknowred** (8.4): The vocals saved it

**Kaylaboe** (8): not a SINGLE note was off

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): That voice is just so so gorgeous, and the song is a wonderful showcase for it.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this is still great but repondez-moi would’ve been a 10 :( what we could have had with eurovision 2020…

**plastichaxan** (7.5): i thought this was florence + the machine for a second ouu

**shhhneak** (7.1): He’s giving Ben Platt (derogatory)

**GapeCod** (7): Oh no.. I really overrated this at the time because of the performer 😭

**jaztinax** (7): it’s a solid ballad but was definitely not worthy of a high rank

**throwaway-7650** (7): live? wearegoingtopretendwedidnthearthat.gif

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this is very dramatic. Idk what he is saying but the album cover has a car crash in the background so I’m guessing someone died

**Martin1009** (6.8): jury-bait, and it worked

**s2pd** (6.5): It's fine

# Black Hole

**babadork** (6.3): This sounds like a sad car commercial.

**BebeLuigi** (6): It's fine I guess, I don't care for it much but it's enjoyable

**celladonn** (6): Never really got the hype for this

**emmaelf** (6): a very pretty song in the verses and i start losing it in the build up.

**thedoublebanana** (5.5): Another one I don't understand why people hype it up so much. It's alright, but not a top 3 song.

**apatel27** (5): Hitting the high note and becoming wavey inflatable man at the end doesn't make the song any less mediocre

**CrimsonROSET** (5): trailer music (insult)

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I was like “surely this must be building to something” and it turns out that something was a letdown

**noideawhatever** (5): forgettable

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I was gonna say “This is just Arcade again” but apparently they have the same songwriter so… uh…

**ImADudeDuh** (4): i remember i had to listen to this for the popheads charts one week it was fine

**thedoctordances1940** (3.7): i wish swiss music didn't largely fucking suck

**MrSwearword** (3): It's not giving what it could.

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): this seems like a song that was rejected from the Lion King remake soundtrack

**you2009** (2.5): sufjan stevens I am so sorry but U know good and well U have better songs than this

**Awkward\_King** (2): gay

**CarlieScion** (2): mcnuke male ballads even more

**frogaranaman** (1): ehhhhhhhh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): The beginning of Cyprus's yassification indeed. tbh I might have overrated this at the time but it's too late to change my score now so...

**racloves** (6): I hate to say it but I think I would have liked the song better if it was someone else singing it

---
# Ooh La la
**Awkward\_King** (10): cyprus have been sending yass songs for as long as i can remember tbh

**Martin1009** (10): Play this at my graduation, my wedding, my child's baptism, when i retire, at my funeral. It is the banger of the lifetime

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): with better vocals this could've won, the staging and choreo is such a serve

**ZebraSun73** (9.5): No ESC playlist is complete without this BOP

**shhhneak** (9.3): Dua should’ve made this a single.

**afs** (9): la la land found dead in a ditch

**noideawhatever** (9): what's up with 2012 and having so many great songs?

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): i would have been obsessed with this in 2012

**seanderlust** (9): if j-lo released this in like 2012 I would have eaten this up on the dancefloor

**ashandimlotion** (8.5): I used my pocket money at 12 years old to download this on iTunes the day the finale came out!

**emmaelf** (8.5): decent staging, great chorus, acceptable verses. it's just a very generic 2010s power pop song but i like 2010s power pop so that's fine by me.

**jaztinax** (8.5): i forgot about this one!! it’s a banger though

**plastichaxan** (8.5): a rare "oh i've heard this before" moment in the rate for me

**thedoublebanana** (8.5): I'm always pleasantly surprised when this song gets included in top countdowns because it flopped from score, but still fans regard this as a great Eurovision song.

**BebeLuigi** (8): This was so robbed

**berober04** (8): La La Love walked so Fuego could run

**daretheghost** (8): A nice song to play on a Bluetooth speaker at a white person’s backyard cookout or pool party while drinking a Mike’s Hard and waiting for a drunk husband to set off state-legal fireworks.

**vayyiqra** (8): bop

**veryanniev** (8): too overproduced to be in Eurovision and the performance didn’t help it one bit but this is my new bop for the summer

**speaknowred** (7.9): Another fun entry but I forgot about it tbh

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Slightly different sonic choices (more of a bubblegum approach I think) would have taken this to another level

**awkward\_penguin** (7.2): A few weeks ago, a friend sent me an audio messaging me "awkward_penguin, I have this song stuck in my head. Do you know what it is?", and he starts singing "la la la la la la la" super off key. I recognized it and have heard it a million times in bars and clubs around Madrid but could not for the life of me remember its name. So I asked a bunch of friends, sending them audios with "la la la la la la la", and they would say the same thing - they recognize it and it's at the tip of their tongue, but they had no idea. And in random moments, they would send me songs saying "I found it!" But nope, they were just other songs with "la la la la la la". I kept looking up "Canciones en español con la la la" but couldn't find anything. This kept happening for weeks until the friend who sent me the original message and I went out dancing, and when we heard the "la la la la la" (but the right one), we pulled out Shazam in a millisecond and finally realized that it was not a Spanish song but a Cypriot one.

**DefaultPophead** (7.1): There are much, much worse in this rate. This score feels right. Actually... no she's too hot for this score. I raised it a bit.

**guy\_like\_u** (7): Cyprus really found their niche with these attractive young woman doing uptempo bops didn’t they?

**iniekcja\_** (7): why the books…

**Kaylaboe** (7): bop?

**MrSwearword** (7): cute, but honestly, in a year that had Loreen, Pastora Soler and the trolling magnificence of Rambo Amadeus, cute next to gorgeous...

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): this is a pretty average pop song. But it’s still a bop, nothing wrong with average

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): waiting for La La Love in the La La Land

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Europeans always go hard with electronic music, I appreciate that

**DirtyRat583** (6.8): eurovision 2012 served

**bigbigbee** (6.5): WOW this woman is so beautiful that I can ignore that she’s kind of a mid performer. Like I’m astounded at her beauty, wowwww

**happyletuce06** (6.5): boppy i guess

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): she wasn't given much to work with but slay a lil'

# Ooh naur naur

**criestotheclicking** (6): fun song but something about her live vocals is grating

**CrimsonROSET** (6): we call that possession

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this is the most eurodance song I’ve ever heard

**ImADudeDuh** (6): fergie ENDED

**LunaMoonMeUp** (6): A fun girlbop, but very shaky live. Doesn't live up to the greats.

**s2pd** (6): It's a shame Ivi can't sing live, because I quite like the song

**skargardin** (6): oh god this performance is way more terrible than I remember it being skull

**sirpancakeXI** (5.5): your generic euro dance song in the mid 10s

**akanewasright** (5): I can’t believe Fergie outsold

**flavasavavandal** (5): while I have to credit Ivi for performing a song in 2012 that seems straight out of 2013, that isn’t going to stop me from giving it 5 since 2013 sucked ass

**frogaranaman** (5): la la love that this went in one ear out the other

**GapeCod** (5): very much of its time.

**TiltControls** (5): of all eurovision songs this is certainly one

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): :midafexplosion:

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Fergie outsold

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): i did not remember this song at all until the chorus came on then my memories unlocked…and it’s an annoying chorus

**Smuckles** (4): Disappointed this is not a Pixies cover.

**hannahspants** (3): BORING

**apatel27** (2): How is this song more generic than every other edm dance tracks from 2012

**moonagenightmares** (1): so so so bland

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): A pleasantly nice country song! This is probably one of the most "normal" sounding songs in the rate (re: it sounds like something americans wouldnt automatically hate) and whether or not that works in its favor depends on the rater, but personally I really enjoy this song and I'm glad it managed to at least escape Day 1.

**racloves** (2): bathroom break

---
# r/countryheads
**emmaelf** (11): oh i just love this. i forgot all about it but it's so lovely to listen to. i'd happily add this to my country/folk/calm driving playlist. it is both a great eurovision entry, with nice, pretty staging, and also a song i'd listen to independent of the contest.

**BebeLuigi** (10): This live performance is ethereal.

**daretheghost** (10): I just love this song so much.

**Kaylaboe** (10): a cultural yeeset

**RandomHypnotica** (10): can ph pretend the blonde lady is taylor and not rob this for being country

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Why is this better than most American country songs I’ve heard

**welcome2thejam** (10): Super strong duet with gorgeous instrumentals. IDK, maybe I'm inflating the score as a change of pace, or maybe I'm just a sucker for the way that background guitar sound always gets me crying in my whiskey glass

**shhhneak** (9.9): The vibes are immaculate.

**speaknowred** (9.2): Gorgeous

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): This song is too good for eurovision tbh.

**fadedblue09** (9): Love this one a lot, it gives me country music vibes. And finally, a duet that actually sounds pleasant??

**hannahspants** (9): didn't care for this at first but it's grown on me.

**Martin1009** (9): gorge, finally some real music /jk

**noideawhatever** (9): ok, i really dig this. also please tell me i'm not the only one who got reminded of every breath you take while listening to this song

**nt96** (9): I'm never been into country but this is lovely!

**whatyourheartdesires** (9): calms my soul

**DefaultPophead** (8.9): I can already feel this gorgeous song getting underrated by y'all.

**thedoublebanana** (8.5): This has grown on me over the years. Birds started the Netherlands train, but this capitalized on the simple staging and great vocals.

**ashandimlotion** (8): I understand why people think this should’ve won even though they are wrong

**Awkward\_King** (8): why did this song have such a gorilla grip on me in 2014 honestly

**criestotheclicking** (8): I think this is what Running Scared was aiming for, but fell rather short of.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): I feel like there are videos out there of teenagers doing the cup song to this

**happyletuce06** (8): soo calming, great staging

**musical\_pyn** (8): needed a bit more to push it to a 10 but I really appreciate the different vibe of this

**s2pd** (8): Nice to dream away with

**throwaway-7650** (8): thought indie girls revealed?

**ZebraSun73** (8): I hated this song in 2014 but now I think it's pretty decent? Does turning 30 have something to do with it? Am i about to enter my country era? Who am I?

**awkward\_penguin** (7.8): The song itself is good, but it's the camerawork that provides such intense intimacy. And the staging is an example of simple is sometimes what you need.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): when the indieheads invade Eurovision.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.7): Kali Uchis' impact omg

**afs** (7.5): can we have the storm pls

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): jeehäw

**seanderlust** (7.5): this is nice! a little simple but not in a bad way. very heavy coffeeshop vibes

**sirpancakeXI** (7.5): this is like boring in a good way

**TiltControls** (7.5): who put on the cmas

**akanewasright** (7): oh this is cute

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): howdy

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is appropriating American culture.

**guy\_like\_u** (7): such a good staging and Netherlands best song in years. Not massively memorable but a nice song nonetheless

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this needed to be more dynamic

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): A more classy and subdued song than usual at Eurovision, not my normal cup of tea, but I can recognise it as a good song.

**moooo566** (7): this is cute, but as someone who typically quite likes cutesy country music it's just not that good

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): I hated this a few years ago. I hate it slightly less now. Perhaps I even like it 🤷‍♂️👀

**skargardin** (7): I mean it's cute

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): you could tell me the US sent this and i would believe u

**apatel27** (6): Soft Yeehaw Sounds

# This is why we're never getting another country rate

**jaztinax** (6): i didn’t know this was the american song contest

**Uberpigeon** (6): we dont need more countries doing country isnt america already enough of a pain

**itsabop** (5.8): Sanna Nielsen should've been in this rate instead

**frogaranaman** (5): someone took one listen to John Denver and then wrote a song

**Stryxen** (5): i like the guitar solo, nobody else served

**vayyiqra** (5): is this from Speak Now or from Red

**CarlieScion** (4): who let the Americans invade

**thedoctordances1940** (3.4): it's cheesy it's boring it's not good

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): solely because they had the audacity to perform a country song at eurovision. 10yo me thought this was boring as fuck and she was so right

**MrSwearword** (2): at least I can imagine this being good if it were someone like Anouk doing this but just...being better.

**moonagenightmares** (1): it should be a crime to send songs this boring to eurovision

**plastichaxan** (1): zzzzz

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): every breath you take, every step you- oh wait

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is my eurovision 2020 winner i do not care

**racloves** (6): This song is divisive, looking at the comments here, but I like weird music ok

---

**akanewasright** (10): I can feel the hyperpop phobia already

**daretheghost** (10): Little Big is SO PERFECT for Eurovision.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I shoulda never smoked that shit now I’m with bizarro ABBA

**GapeCod** (10): ☠ The way I genuinely used to think I would attend ESC 2021 in my home country LMAO.

**Kaylaboe** (10): thank you russia for giving us the gayest song of the year

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): THEY WOULD HAVE WON!!

**nootnoot781** (10): not apologising for this score <3

**plastichaxan** (10): latinas

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I so desperately wish I could 11 this

**thedoublebanana** (10): I still hold to the belief that this would've been the shock winner of 2020. I think people underestimate how much traction this would've gain with the campiness of it + the russia voting bloc.

**throwaway-7650** (10): the moonies but irl and yassified (:waiting2: for the cover)

**ashandimlotion** (9.5): such a fun song

**iniekcja\_** (9): recently have seen someone mention how they would't be able to recreate the iconic MV staging because of the 6 person rule, and that would definitely would've affected the results

**speaknowred** (8.6): I love these types of songs

**criestotheclicking** (8): this is super silly in the best way.

**hannahspants** (8): this song is so stupid

**happyletuce06** (8): fun and unapologetic

**jaztinax** (8): they deserved to perform at eurovision

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): Unsure how well the vocals would translate to the Eurovision stage, but the song is so so fun, and the performance of the music video would have made this one to look out for.

**Martin1009** (8): Yeah we stan

**Melody** (8): Russia ate on this one I fear

**Smuckles** (8): Cool, we're at the 'romanticising Vengaboys/Aqua' part of 90's nostalgia. Glad the kids are keeping up! This rocks

**TiltControls** (8): everyone has uno, it came free with the xbox

**s2pd** (7.5): Iconic

**vayyiqra** (7): lol this band

**welcome2thejam** (7): What else must the pandemic take from us?

**bigbigbee** (6.5): the hosts said that the performances enhance the songs and I really agree - I thought that this was super fun when I saw the performance, but hearing it on its own with no visual made this grow off me, and unfortunately for Little Big I wanted to be consistent and scored everything based on the song alone

**Stryxen** (6): it’s like a visual sensory video for europeans

**apatel27** (5): Live performance would definitely help this greatly

**astrologicalangel** (5): low budget Barbie Girl

**DirtyRat583** (4): hold on WHO INVITED THEM TO EUROVISION

**veryanniev** (4): the video is great but it’s one of the worst songs in Little Big’s discography

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Not the kawaii uwu voice I hate this

**seanderlust** (2): oh those post-chorus synths are horrendous! rest of your life by david guetta teas and no that is NOT a compliment

**ZebraSun73** (2): This is honestly awful. Edgelord energy. Pass

**DefaultPophead** (1): I've never liked this and it didn't get better over the years.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (1): Them not being on stage and stealing televote points from better contestants or even a qualification spot is the best side effect of 2020 being canceled.

**moonagenightmares** (1): russian die antwoord?

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (1): I never understood why people liked this 😬

# Anime
**CrimsonROSET** (11): ??? How have I never heard this before, it’s fucking amazing???

**happyletuce06** (11): a cultural reset. everyone moved. everything shifted.

**ashandimlotion** (10): I hate to say it but... the ravenous Turkish YouTube commenters who go on about this getting robbed are right.

**celladonn** (10): this goes the fuck off

**GapeCod** (10): this has AGEEEEEEED, but I was obsessed with it at the time, not gonna lie... god I miss ESC 2010 so much, that night truly was my queer awakening. also anime rate promo omg

**MrSwearword** (10): I mean Lena had to win, but damn this is high quality.

**nt96** (10): This feels like an anime theme.....VOTE FOR ANIME OPENINGS.

**SFbby** (10): This sounds like a Three Days Grace song but IDK which one

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i can't make this song not bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Fuuuuuuuuuuck. I hate how much I love this. I really am pop punk trash

**you2009** (10): taking a 3 minute break from being anticolonialist to enjoy this song

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): a classic

**speaknowred** (8.9): Love

**itsabop** (8.8): Great runner up

**afs** (8.5): Eurovision paid for rockphobia when maneskin won

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Bionicles commercial vibes

**plastichaxan** (8.4): i feel like i shouldnt like this and yet

**seanderlust** (8.3): this is my favorite of the hard rock-influenced tracks so far. also the name MaNga is perfect because I could see this being the opening theme for an anime

**BebeLuigi** (8): I'm not the biggest fan of Rock in ESC usually but wow this ate

**bigbigbee** (8): knew I could trust someone named “manga” for an AMV style banger

**criestotheclicking** (8): the members of MaNga look like if you mixed all the members of Fall Out Boy together in different percentages. The constant pizzicato strings in the verses eventually get annoying

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): this yassified Linkin Park

**emmaelf** (8): the intro promised so much more than the singer delivered. i love that they dressed like mcr rejects and the song is still good, it just could have been great.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): I think I prefer this song. But some of the fans of this song are so toxic that I’m glad Lena won. Still a GREAT song though

**s2pd** (8): The verses could have been stronger, but the rest is great

**skargardin** (8): oh go off

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): ANIME OPENINGS RATE????

**DefaultPophead** (7.8): Sergey and Sheldon say no.

**awkward\_penguin** (7.7): It's a solid rock song with good staging. Not much more to say.

**akanewasright** (7.5): they do eat a little

**apatel27** (7.5): Who knew Silver Ranger was a woman

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): sexy astronaut robot stripper

**1998tweety** (7): manga the book format ended ha

**daretheghost** (7): Big English-Dubbed-Anime-Final-Credits-Song Energy.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7): Great performance but boring song.

**hannahspants** (7): it's okay but the weird robot lady on stage always put me off

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): I have a soft spot for rock songs at Eurovision, and this is no different. It's a little on the generic side, but will always stand out amongst a sea of pop music.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): is it possible to be in love with someone and not even know their name?

**throwaway-7650** (7): a 10 on mute (I don't mean the guy is hot)

**vayyiqra** (7): Shoutout to Beeozan in particular for explaining MaNga lore to me in detail. They're not bad, they kind of remind me of System of a Down (listen to "Radio/Video" if you want to see what I mean.)

**babadork** (6.5): I’m underwhelmed by the lead singer and weirded out by the robot dancer

**veryanniev** (6.5): the song is not my cup of tea but the performance is incredible, especially visually

# Netflix Adaptation

**moonagenightmares** (6): i dont get the love for this

**ImADudeDuh** (5.5): this is like softer linkin park

**frogaranaman** (5): if this was a kpop song y'all would eat it up

**Melody** (5): will turkey ever get over them flopping.

**nootnoot781** (5): i don’t care for the song but this has one of the best camerawork of all eurovision entries

**ZebraSun73** (5): I had completely memoryholed this one. Perfect time to rediscover ethno nu-metal. Not my cup of tea but I appreciate that it exists.

**RandomHypnotica** (4.8): god this song is obnoxious af, from the staging to the annoying strobe lights to the over the top robot that turns into flag girl to the 30 Seconds to Mars song they're performing… awful

**Awkward\_King** (4): i want to like this more than i do

**berober04** (4): fine enough song, but if Turkey were to end with a literal manboat, that was a more fitting way to do it

**Martin1009** (4): not robbed lmao

**welcome2thejam** (4): Let's just say I see the vibe and it's not for me

**Stryxen** (3): there’s something so EVIL about this performance

**thedoublebanana** (3): From the rock songs that Turkey has sent, this is my least favorite.

**thedoctordances1940** (2.4): sometimes an attempt to bring some edge to eurovision can be fun but this is just a fucking terrible song, i cannot fathom how so many people are still salty 12 years later that this imagine dragons-core song didn't win, there's just nothing that works about this

**2dina3dworld** (2): Idk why this sucks but it feels like too clean and smooth

**CarlieScion** (2): MGK who

**guy\_like\_u** (1): this is trash. What is that reveal supposed to be at the end? Oooh it’s a beautiful woman, what a shock?

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): I’m normally good at separating artist from art but Ferman Akgül becoming pro-government left too sour a taste in my mouth. also this song sucks anyway

**racloves** (8): Fuck popheads raters and esc voters for this not being placed higher

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): Ok, what the hell popheads? I thought for SURE this would be an easy Day 3 song, if not top 10! This song has everything an art pop enjoyer could ask for: the vocals are on point, the production is unique in all the best ways, what more do you want? This was Day 3 for a LOOOOOONG time but it got a couple of 0s near the end and ruined any chance it had to recover. On the plus side...we've finally reached the 7+ average songs!

# YOUR LOOOOOOOOOOOVE
**ashandimlotion** (10): fuck the televoters for tanking her

**BebeLuigi** (10): This is my third ten for a song from 2015 here and my favourite song of that year didn't even make the cut what a year this was ugh

**daretheghost** (10): !!!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m living for her dramatic Celine belting vibes

**GapeCod** (10): I didn't remember this at all, but I really should have?! Phenomenal, honestly.

**hannahspants** (10): the best thing Latvia has ever put out, and judging from its successors, potentially the best thing it will ever put out

**happyletuce06** (10): timeless entry, would have done amazingly in any year

**iniekcja\_** (10): no really cause the song is great but the stage that year made any source of light blinding

**Kaylaboe** (10): YESSSSS

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): this song gives me power. Second best Eurovision song ever imo. This year was so strong but her belts blew everyone else out of the park. Listening this with bass boosted headphones is an ethereal experience 10/10 recommend

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): stunning omg

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): wow what a spectacle, I sure hope it won

**veryanniev** (10): the fact that this queen was doing the fucking Voice Russia the next year after doing Eurovision is a travesty. Her writing this masterpiece completely on her own is giving her a legend status in my eyes.

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): deserved a better result, this is art

**ZebraSun73** (10): Aminata my queen

**afs** (9.5): heroin anthem!!!

**awkward\_penguin** (9.5): Visually, this is stunning. That gorgeous dress. The headpiece. Those red and white rays in the background. And musically - that fucking BASS. Those vocals. My only complaint is that it gets slightly repetitive - but as long as you're watching the live performance, this isn't really an issue.

**thedoublebanana** (9.5): HAND DRAMA FOR DAYS! Love this performance, love this recording. It's a top eurovision song of all time.

**speaknowred** (9.2): WOW

**akanewasright** (9): YES YES YES GIVE ME EVERYTHING

**astrologicalangel** (9): oh my god her voice is incredible

**criestotheclicking** (9): 2015 was a strong year huh. She has amazing pipes and amazing stage presence. Also like the switch-up verse, keeps things fresh.

**Martin1009** (9): Deserved top3

**skargardin** (9): stunning

**TiltControls** (9): Love her voice

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): is that legal?

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): wait she seriously served…

**shhhneak** (8.4): Didn’t I do it for you?

**Awkward\_King** (8): damn robert pattinson rly fucked twigs up huh

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): Her talent just radiates from the screen, and is joyous to see.

**MrSwearword** (8): the song is decent, but honestly I give it this score because of Lithuania breaking rank by giving this a twelve and paying Russia NOOCH come scoring.

**Uberpigeon** (8): ok pop off

**vayyiqra** (8): Not big on the vocals but musically it's pretty cool (seeing a trend here).

**apatel27** (7): The song is a standard EDM track but the stage is amazing

**CrimsonROSET** (7): heroin

**DefaultPophead** (6.8): Aminata sweetie, I'm so sorry you scored less than Guy Sebastian.

**throwaway-7650** (6.6): ...it's the love shot - NA NANA NANANANA [x3]

# Anti-vaxxers

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This kind of electronic music is just not really my thing

**seanderlust** (5.7): new covid conspiracy theory: the secret ingredient in the pfizer vax is actually love

**CarlieScion** (5): her voice does not do this song justice

**noideawhatever** (5): this song has a lot of elements of what could be an amazing song and somehow it's... just ok. and that's what disappoints me the most.

**s2pd** (5): Odd song I can't connect to

**celladonn** (4): pretty boring

**emmaelf** (4): i can respect the skill involved with the song and it being a difficult performance but it just feels like a cut-price florence and the machine.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): The title of this is so intriguing but unfortunately it’s kinda boring, it doesn’t ever really come together fully for me

**guy\_like\_u** (4): her voice is very grating, I think this might have worked with a more gentle vocal. Honestly listening to her makes me anxious

**jaztinax** (4): i don’t remember this?? i don’t wanna remember it though

**moonagenightmares** (3.4): great vocals but the song did nothing for me

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i guess im antivax

**thedoctordances1940** (3): ?

**frogaranaman** (1): where the fuck is the instrumental did they fuck up the bounce

**bigbigbee** (0): the verses are boring and the chorus feels like I’m being hit by a truck that’s blaring its horn

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this is such an awkward paced song and her voice is not for me. So hard to listen to. Like her going from high pitched talking to belting the chorus is wayyy to jarring. And the production choices? Mess

# The only crime is loving this song 
**pleasegivemeasword** (11): 2016 seemed like a banger year for eurovision these are all good

**RoyalBloodFool** (11): Love the production and the hook

**whatyourheartdesires** (11): perfection

**Awkward\_King** (10): fun bop IDC IDC. the styling is atrocious and yet unendingly iconic

**daretheghost** (10): One of my favorites of recent years. So goddamn good.

**Martin1009** (10): three 10s in the same year?? Can you guess which year is my favourite?

**MrSwearword** (10): honestly for as much as it annoys me that she was called "Bulgarian Gaga", I live for this song.

**nootnoot781** (10): the staging is ???? but the song is so good

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): these are getting too good for my liking

**thedoublebanana** (9.5): Poli said Gay Rights.

**BebeLuigi** (9): That was so good you guys

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): I have mixed feelings bc this was my exes favourite song. But I must admit: she had good taste

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is like "if 2012 EDM had been good" (joke).

**GapeCod** (8): Bop but I'm tired of the premise.

**jaztinax** (8): no but why could this be a selena gomez song

**Kaylaboe** (8): the start of bulgaria's yassification

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): SUCH a fun little bop that she really did nail live.

**s2pd** (8): It's a bop. One of my favourites of the year

**seanderlust** (8): ok sure yeah but if god was a dj life would be a dance floor let's have THAT conversation!!

**skargardin** (8): serve

**speaknowred** (8): I have never been a big fan

**afs** (7.5): mama im in love with a criminal so I killed him 💞

**happyletuce06** (7.5): catchy bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): is this a lgbt anthem???

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): ate a bit..

**iniekcja\_** (7): then i would be a snitch

**Stryxen** (7): the way this song is SO cliche that it ascends that and becomes a commentary on eurovision and therefore so original and interesting

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): cute bop ig

**DefaultPophead** (6.7): If love was a crime, I'd be a pious nun!

# This song is a crime

**ashandimlotion** (6.5): a bit overrated, but a nice song well performed

**awkward\_penguin** (6.2): It's nice but I can never remember anything about this song.

**emmaelf** (6): the singer has great stage presence and as a performance it's good. the song is pretty forgettable amongst all the similar sounding pop eurovision produces.

**guy\_like\_u** (6): this haircut really had everyone in a chokehold in 2016

**Smuckles** (6): A mild bop

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Mid

**welcome2thejam** (6): Guess we'll find out the answer in a few months when we rate Frank Ocean's Love Crimes

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this isn’t that bad so I can’t make a “if releasing bad music was a crime then you wouldn’t be able to release this song” joke.

**akanewasright** (5.5): this is like 18,000 pop cliches in one place, but I enjoy at least a few of these cliches so

**apatel27** (5): Tiktok dance before Tiktok was a thing

**throwaway-7650** (5): tried and failed to make a polygamy joke

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): the girlboss of allies???

**CrimsonROSET** (3): I mean talk about doing the absolute least with a metaphor

# Actually, love IS a crime

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): So I looked it up and it turns out love that’s a crime actually exists! It’s called “being gay,” and it sucks

**moonagenightmares** (7.2): missed opportunity to make this gay

**ImADudeDuh** (7): what if we lived in a world... where LOVE was illegal??

**hannahspants** (6): I like this song but the realist in me always thinks "actually love IS a crime in some places so..."

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): who’s gonna tell her

**CarlieScion** (5): well have I got news for u poli

**frogaranaman** (5): "if love was a crime" sis it literally is in at least 71 countries

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): Well...this is my 11, so I obviously have a lot of strong feelings about this one, but to make a long story short...this song got me into Eurovision. I know, that's a really weird song to get you interested in the contest, but when my friend played this song for me and told it was from Eurovision, all I could think was "Huh? Eurovision is MORE than just lame pop songs? Maybe I need to start watching it!" And so I did, and I haven't stopped loving Eurovision since. I knew this wasn't gonna do well, and if I hadn't had such strong feelings for this song I most likely would've included something like She Got Me or Zero Gravity instead, but I'm glad that it got even a little bit of appreciation, and that I got to share it with you. 

**racloves** (5): incredible performance, great staging, but screamo is just not for me.

---
# The only people I trust in this cold dark world
**afs** (11): this is the most daring one by FAR not because it's industrial techno screaming but because it STILL has a key change you win my 11

**celladonn** (11): Fuck yes

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): an industrial song in MY popheads??? with a political conscience?! insert gif of goths dancing under bridge

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): inject it into my veins

# Other people with taste

**2dina3dworld** (10): this caught me so off guard, 10 for the pure balls

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Finally the death metal industrial techno I’ve been craving in Eurovision. Trent Reznor it’s not too late to compete sweetie!!!

**DefaultPophead** (10): If Hatrið Mun Sigra has million number of fans I am one of them. If Hatrið Mun Sigra has ten fans I am one of them. If Hatrið Mun Sigra has only one fan and that is me. If Hatrið Mun Sigra has no fans, that means I am no longer on earth. If the world against the Hatrið Mun Sigra, I am against the world.

**frogaranaman** (10): points for bravery having this be in a popheads rate

**happyletuce06** (10): a cultural reset

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Free Palestine

**iniekcja\_** (10): bjork would be proud

**moonagenightmares** (10): HATARI WE FUCKING LOVE YOU. if this won i would’ve lost my mind

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): probably would have been my 11 if eric saade wasn’t here :( this actually made me a really big fan of hatari for a few good months which then led to me subsequently getting banned from the hatari discord server for exposing a bunch of pedos there (along with the bestie u/moonagebynightmares and another friend). thank you hatari for causing that to happen in my life

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): That beat reminds me of Björk’s “Pluto”, it hits SO hard. I still love everything about this act.

**nootnoot781** (10): this is gay rights

**plastichaxan** (10): i just felt so seen

**RandomHypnotica** (10): HATARI I AM FREE FRIDAY NIGHT ETC.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): love to put this on to haunt my non Eurovision fans friends.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): fuck yes

**ashandimlotion** (9): they sprinted so maneskin could crawl

**Awkward\_King** (9): gimmicky as fuck sure but it is a BANGER

**CarlieScion** (9): weirdly fun for a song called hatred will prevail

**criestotheclicking** (9): very sexy of Iceland to send this as their entry. I just love how outlandish it is.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): The energy they brought was unreal, and the boys constantly entertained. I love crossover genres, I love countries sending acts in their own language, and I bloody love this.

**moooo566** (9): im genuinely surprised they were allowed to do this

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): they popped off. Iceland NEEDS a win. Crying rn. My grandparents called this disgusting and if that’s not iconic idk what is

**daretheghost** (8.5): Mad respect for how Hatari took Eurovision both seriously and not seriously at all.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): WOW

**speaknowred** (8.1): Deserved way better

**apatel27** (8): Gotta respect them straight up weating fetish gear on set

**MrSwearword** (8): they went hard presentation wise and with unfurling FREE PALESTINE banners once they got twelves.

**Smuckles** (8): Oh yeah, the bondage song. Lovely, thank you

**guy\_like\_u** (7.5): ok but the key change actually slaps though.

**BebeLuigi** (7): I wasn't their biggest fan but I'm glad they did as well as they did lol

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I would have liked this better if it didn’t sound like his voice was doing to die any second

**Martin1009** (7): Iceland, pls never change

**Melody** (7): the standing was iconic!

**s2pd** (7): Cool beat, but mullet boy is kinda off-key

**welcome2thejam** (7): Anybody know how I can get a career in standing atop a globe and wailing away to the industrial rhythm

**emmaelf** (6.7): i'm unsure on why the sex cage is part of the act. i would say it's iceland doing an iceland but the two vocalists don't quite work together.

**shhhneak** (6.5): Free Palestine

# screamo scary

**akanewasright** (6): …huh

**CrimsonROSET** (6): is this gonna be last place because of the rough parts, because it shouldn’t be but I also get it

**Uberpigeon** (6): ok i actually love this when its not the guy... doing that

**vayyiqra** (6): This industrial beat is awesome so I really want to like this more but these vocals in the verses are downright horrid.

**DirtyRat583** (5.9): this is scary

**hannahspants** (5): love the audacity, don't care for the song

**noideawhatever** (5): what in the rammstein feat. britney spears is this. idk how to feel about it tbh

**throwaway-7650** (5): the production is giving, the screaming... doesn't

**Stryxen** (4.1): this feels like eurovision extended universe canon not actual canon

**DevilsOfLoudun** (4): I'm sorry I commend them for doing something different but...

**skargardin** (4): okay so i absolutely LOVE the energy and aesthetic they brought but the song.. it was a choice

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Am I hearing this song right??

**jaztinax** (3): i just can’t

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i want to be in the reveal when this goes out (aka prob day 1) because i gotta know what tf this performance looked like

**seanderlust** (2): this would be an 11 if there were no vocals on the track. this is a lesson that sometimes men need to be quiet

**TiltControls** (2): it's cool, but that's not going to stop me giving it a low score

**fadedblue09** (1): This is very Scandinavian alright

**GapeCod** (1): imagine being too kitschy for eurovision

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): I was gonna give this a 0 but given the powerful message I don’t think it deserves that. However this is scary and I never want to hear it again in my life.

**itsabop** (1): Absolutely not

**thedoublebanana** (1): I'm sorry I'm not an angsty teenager.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): I wasn't expecting this song to do so poorly! I thought for sure popheads would eat this up, with the proto-hyperpop influence and being sonically ahead of its time, this song still sounds like something that could be released today to critical acclaim. Of course, maybe I underestimated popheads' hyperpop-phobia as well...

**racloves** (6): yassified elsa

---
# The whole world is mine

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (11): words cannot describe my love for this song. When I was younger Denmark was my favourite but this has beaten it. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️ Norway needs a win

**apatel27** (10): Final Boss Music

**BebeLuigi** (10): THIS IS AMAZING, honestly a contender for my 11 it's just so good.

**jaztinax** (10): most robbed of all time

**Kaylaboe** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): wait…i don’t remember this at all but it’s absolutely giving

**MrSwearword** (10): Honest to god I nearly gave this my eleven, it's one of my favorite non-winners ever.

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): This is actually one of the best songs that ever graced the festival. She somehow sounds like Björk and Robyn at the same time and the juggernaut synth-beat is Scandinavian EXCELLENCE. The best representative Norway ever send? Probably so.

**seanderlust** (10): these instrumentals have no business going this hard jfc

**throwaway-7650** (10): wait this is hyperpop... production

**veryanniev** (10): still one of my absolute favourite Eurovision songs ever

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): You can really hear Karin Park in here

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): This has got to make Day 3 or I'm rioting.

**Martin1009** (9.5): step on my neck, respectfully

**plastichaxan** (9.5): hyperpop?? on my eurovision?? i love to see it

**GapeCod** (9): THIIIIIS is what we're referring to when we're saying that certain midtempo kpop songs are "very eurovision". (no this is literally a dreamcatcher reject from before they even debuted)

**iniekcja\_** (9): is this a threat

**shhhneak** (9): I forgot about this queen. Eat eat eat!

**Stryxen** (9): the epitome of yass and slay, like she’s just serving

**ZebraSun73** (9): Need to travel back in time to 2013 to understand why Denmark won instead of Norway. I think i prefer this. Also it sounds like it could be one of t.A.T.u.s better songs

**afs** (8.5): omg elsa hyperpop

**celladonn** (8.5): really like the production here

**daretheghost** (8.5): Surprisingly not as grating as I remember?

**awkward\_penguin** (8.3): I LOVE a good electropop song, and she does it so incredibly well. The staging is a bit basic, but it works.

**thedoublebanana** (8.2): I am a fan of how crazy this song is.

**hannahspants** (8): I've always been weirded out by the concept of feeding someone love but damn if it isn't a good song and damn does she look good delivering it

**happyletuce06** (8): she was ahead of her time

**vayyiqra** (8): Weird title aside this is kind of a banger.

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): this sounds like it should be on the soundtrack of an epic action movie

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): Fresh sounding song, stellar vocals, honestly robbed.

**s2pd** (7): Too bad about that beat, because other than that the song is really cool

**speaknowred** (7): Never liked it

**moonagenightmares** (6.8): i think this is my first time hearing this since i didnt watch eurovision for a few years but i like it

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): first feet, now the feeder community, eurovision sure loves to highlight fetishes huh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.5): I wanted to stan but this is a Sia song sadly

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this is way too serious of a song for Eurovision, I sleep

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): sounded like it was gonna be interesting but then it was not particularly great

# You put a knife against my back

**criestotheclicking** (6): very much EDM Evanescence

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): this was made for someone who is not me

**Smuckles** (6): Sounds a bit electroclash

**Uberpigeon** (6): the verses have such cool production and then in come those y2k strings and ruin it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This sounds like those Transistor songs from the VG rate. Good times

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): well girl i have an eating disorder

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): the intro kinda sounds like static

**emmaelf** (5): just not my thing and sounds extremely dated less than 10 years later. the chorus is more timeless but the heavy effects and very 2010s sounding verses just let it down for me personally.

**skargardin** (5): I'm so sorry but this song never clicked with me

**CrimsonROSET** (3): what

**guy\_like\_u** (3): this backing track feels like a migraine. It improves as it goes on but the up until the first chorus it’s unbearable. I feel like the staring at camera plus lyrics make it feel very aggressive too

**akanewasright** (2): is that a metaphor for her hoo ha?

**CarlieScion** (2): this is boring and I remember hating her outfit

**frogaranaman** (1): I expected a hardstyle song with those synths at the beginning 💀 anyways this is bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): his performance in the semi final this year was good though

**racloves** (6): He has an incredible voice, but this song just isn’t for me

---

**criestotheclicking** (10): this would’ve won if Eurovision came back post-cancellation. His voice is mindblowingly good and with the pandemic the song takes on an extra, sadder dimension.

**iniekcja\_** (10): truly impeccable and I'm so glad more people got to witness it this year

**nootnoot781** (10): might change this after the first semi final when he performs. hope he slays

**sirpancakeXI** (10): we need the audience to watch his performance in this year's semi final.

**veryanniev** (10): I’ve heard it for the first time during this year’s semi-final and it’s my personal 2020 winner now. He sounds absolutely incredible live and he should have performed in the finale instead of Mika - I said what I said.

**DefaultPophead** (9.1): What a powerful voice. I love listening to Italian music.

**happyletuce06** (9): an amazing voice and delivery on top of a touching song

**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): If this isn’t an interval show in May we riot.

**Melody** (9): this looked so good at the semis, he should have returned for 2021 but alas.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): if it were any other year, this would be one of my favourites. In 2020 didn’t break my top 10

**ZebraSun73** (8.6): Trying very hard not to mark this song down after ODing on sad piano boy ballads in 2022 because this is good.

**daretheghost** (8.5): I could see this doing really well if 2020 actually happened.

**s2pd** (8.5): Power ballads done right cut deep in your soul

**shhhneak** (8.3): I expected to hate this but the live performance was gorgeous.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): Italy do not come to play, and this entry is no different. Epic and powerful, I'm thrilled he got a chance to perform on the Eurovision Stage.

**speaknowred** (8): It would be higher if he had done the 2022 performance

**Stryxen** (7.5): he looks like one of my lecturers… i just had to get that off my chest. Also that was not under 3 minutes, Diodato you will never be famous

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): he has a great voice but song is kinda dull

**thedoctordances1940** (7): i was gonna tank it cause sappy eurovision song but then the verses were kinda good and then by the end of the song i even liked the hook ou

**akanewasright** (6): the man can sing I’ll give him that

**guy\_like\_u** (6): A lovely ballad

**RandomHypnotica** (6): grigi anatomia core

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s meh

**moonagenightmares** (5.3): stream rumore by raffaella carra

**thedoublebanana** (5): It's an okay song, and it probably would've scored better with me if I actally listened to this more often, but without the ESC season I barely listened to all the ESC songs of 2020.

**ashandimlotion** (4.5): idk why people thought this was like a huge threat....

**bigbigbee** (4.5): I ALWAYS briefly think he’s saying “queeeeeeeeeef” which reflects badly on me

**vayyiqra** (4): sorry to Diodato he did nothing wrong I just don't like these overly dramatic ballads in here

**Kaylaboe** (3): lame

**hannahspants** (2): YAWN

**throwaway-7650** (2): it's not giving

**racloves** (7): Extremely 2000’s, in the best way

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): Turkey's first (and judging by their stance on the contest now, only) Eurovision win came from Turkish pop icon Sertab Erener who won the contest in one of the closest margins of all time, just *two* points ahead of second place Belgium. Honestly, with how much of a powerhouse Turkey was in Eurovision, you'd expect their winning song to be a lot more groundbreaking and special, but there's not much here that really screams "winner" material. I also took points off for that atrocious rap bridge near the end, like what the hell was that 💀

---
# Everyway

**Awkward\_King** (10): turkey rly won the competition with this and then just left

**guy\_like\_u** (10): one of the the best winning songs ever and an incredible performance. This raised the bar and took Eurovision to the next level

**Kaylaboe** (10): she hit the slay button

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): Not an understatement to say it changed Eurovision, it gave you the whole package. The song, the vocals, the costumes, the performance. Truly iconic.

**MrSwearword** (10): it's over the top and wonderful.

**nootnoot781** (10): an absolute slay, performed in 4th and still won!!! it’s such an infectiously catchy song and one of my favourite winners of the 00s. the mix of traditional turkish music, mixed with a rap verse that suits the song is just right. her stage presence is incredible and her charisma shines in this performance. turkey come back to eurovision please!!!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is my childhood because Sertab is my mom-core

**speaknowred** (9.2): Top tier entry really

**afs** (9): wonder how my Pakistani bhaiyo who idolise Turkey would react to this

**criestotheclicking** (9): this song has such a great chorus. Not mad on the rap interlude but i’ll let it pass for Sertab <3

**Martin1009** (9): Makes me wanna uh-uh

**musical\_pyn** (9): need someone to sample the opening of this immediately

**thedoublebanana** (9): The drama of the top 3. This won in the moment, but it feeling like a knock off of "Simarik" takes a small hit to the overall score.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Oh this girl can BELT

**seanderlust** (8.5): who is the man at the beginning of the video i watched saying bring me the bellies

**babadork** (8.4): It lost me a little with the rap, but I am in awe that they’re able to shake it that hard and still sing.

**2dina3dworld** (8): she’s just like me (desperate)

**daretheghost** (8): MAKE ME WANNA HUH HUHHUH

**hannahspants** (8): classy performance

**skargardin** (8): the dramatics of it all

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): I’m glad I searched out the studio version for this one instead of just watching the live performance because it’s way better

**s2pd** (7.5): good, but I'm not a fan of the break

**DefaultPophead** (7.4): I appreciate the staging. Kill it, girl!

**berober04** (7): Holly Valance prototype

**CarlieScion** (7): this is painfully early 2000s (complementary)

**iniekcja\_** (7): the bridge is a no ma'am

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): the singing is questionable but it is a bop I cannot lie

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): I’ve been mean so far, so now I can be nice. This grew on me, a LOT. I vibe heavily with it

**throwaway-7650** (7): eh. +1 for my former turkish suitemate

**Uberpigeon** (7): ok good

# No-way

**apatel27** (6): These women can't take a hint

**BebeLuigi** (6): It's a pretty fine pop song on its own, I've just always been mad Belgium didn't win lol

**indie\_fan\_** (6): Judging my her voice, I'm going to give her the benefit of the doubt that English isn't her first language. Even then, I'd like this song much more if someone else sang it.

**Melody** (6): go turkey go!

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): sanomi robbed I think

**emmaelf** (5.5): modern staging. awful spoken word segment.

**shhhneak** (5.3): Watching old performances and wondering just HOW they won is so funny.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this is begging for me to stan it but I’m just not there yet

**happyletuce06** (5): not as mid as other winners but kinda annoying to me

**LesApfels** (5): They bought 3 different curtains and somehow pieced her dress together

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): was more impressed with the performance/staging than the actual song i fear

**vayyiqra** (5): This is fine but that rap-ish part was Not Good.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): it's just like so much and for what

**CrimsonROSET** (4): what the fuck is the dj breakdown

**Stryxen** (4): you make me wanna huh you make me wanna [coughs 3 times]

**fadedblue09** (3.5): the grunts I-

**awkward\_penguin** (3.4): Literally cannot remember a single thing about the song itself after just listening to it. It was nice to hear something more "ethnic". Staging was cool, but the camerawork needed...work. The audience couldn't see a lot of the cool things that the dancers were doing.

**moonagenightmares** (2): extremely 2000 /neg

**frogaranaman** (1): good god this song was fucking annoying then and it's annoying now

# The greatest dancer of all time
**Awkward\_King** (10): this is fergie singing a shakira song and it SLAPS

**frogaranaman** (10): put their whole hadussy into this

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m moving to whatever country this is from, hope that won’t end in me being oppressed

**LesApfels** (10): She was, is, and always will be the moment

**MrSwearword** (10): I admit, her vocals barely came through come performance night but Hadise absolutely served it with this song.

**nt96** (10): the clap of my asscheeks when this song is playing

**sirpancakeXI** (10): turkey is lowkey a powerhouse in the 00s, like it is just bop after bop

**skargardin** (10): BOP

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): fun fact about this performance: Turkey decided to never send a female singer to Eurovision after this because apparently Hadise “showed too much skin”. Was too iconic for us to handle

**daretheghost** (9.5): Songs like this make me wish Turkey would get over itself and come back to the contest.

**jaztinax** (9.5): turkey will never be the same after this song

**speaknowred** (9.5): Turkey sends amazing entries every year

**bigbigbee** (9): There are a few songs in this rate that remind me of Shakira and this one is the most successful by far

**thedoublebanana** (8.8): One of my go to karaoke songs.

**afs** (8.5): the comments are so mournful

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): it's giving shakira's super bowl LIV halftime show

**seanderlust** (8.3): the onomotopoeization (?) of the dharbuta is a very cool idea. also male dancer in the green with the spiky hair i am free for lunch on thursday

**babadork** (8.2): Good song but probably not the greatest song of all time

**akanewasright** (8): Eurovision is fun because I can see a country like turkey, who I spent the better part of the semester learning about their war crimes, and just shake ass to their Eurovision serves

**iniekcja\_** (8): I saw the hot dancer in the background at the start and started panicking and counting the people already on stage

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): Underrated girlbop, should be considered on the same level as other robbed Eurovision goddesses.

**moonagenightmares** (8): bop. i loved this as a kid theres probably a video of me dancing embarrassingly to this on a lost vhs tape somewhere

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): I like the ethnic elements. I dance to this regularly and the staging was 👏

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): yassification

**apatel27** (7): Can't go wrong with a nice belly dance

**hannahspants** (7): try to not get this in your head I dare you

**Martin1009** (7): bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): wait they served a bit

**vayyiqra** (7): "düm tek tek type beat" - Hadise

# Feels like there's no way back

**awkward\_penguin** (6.5): A bit of a Shakira knock-off. And not sure if I've ever said this about staging before, but - there's too much pyrotechnics?

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): it's kinda fun but also fuck shouting hey repeatedly in any song

**ashandimlotion** (6): never really understood the hype around this, is hadise like super famous in turkey or something??

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): so much energy but kinda empty. Not enough camp

**emmaelf** (6): used their pyrotechnics too early. did all turkish acts have to learn to belly dance to get on the show?

**happyletuce06** (6): has not aged well

**Smuckles** (6): Please seek medical attention!

**s2pd** (5.5): Boring vocal melody

**BebeLuigi** (5): a bit forgiveable I have to admit

**TiltControls** (5): Vocals felt a bit rough at parts, but was a fun performance

**CarlieScion** (4): makes me snore lowkey

**CrimsonROSET** (4): I keep thinking the ‘hey hey hey hey’ will break out into Rasputin so maybe I played too much just dance when I was young

**fadedblue09** (4): Too similar to the last one (though ig it makes sense since Azerbaijan and Turkey are sibling countries kinda)

**you2009** (4): unfortunate voice that really kills the momentum of the song

**DefaultPophead** (2.5): I lost my score for this song but the thought of watching this song yet again made me sick so I will just score them based on my negative visceral reaction to the thought of it.

# actually yeah what IS up with green shirt guy

**nootnoot781** (10): i am choosing to believe that man was called in as a last minute back up dancer because :💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼💃🏼🧍🏽‍♂️

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): did a backup dancer die and green shirt guy was the only replacement they could find? why does he not have a matching outfit it's so distracting

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The camera switching from sexy belly dancers to random dude in what looked like a track suit was probably the most unintentionally funny moment out of all these videos

**criestotheclicking** (7): not the best vocal performance but I like the song itself and the staging. also find the un-coordinated olive shirt on the guy hilarious.

**guy\_like\_u** (7): this is staging is INSANE! Why are the backing singers so far away? Why is the one guy dressed like he just wandered on from backstage? Why did they wait so long to bring out the male dancer? So many questions? Otherwise a fun song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if you don't vote this for songeniality i'm rejecting your vote (i'm only partially joking)

**racloves** (9): The rhythm is inside me too, cause this is a bop

---
# I'm gonna get that rhythm back
**Awkward\_King** (11): i dont even know exactly why this song has the hold on me it does but ive been obsessed with it for 7 years loic really put his whole loicussy into this

**awkward\_penguin** (10): What. A. Song. I'm looking at its Wikipedia page, which lists under genre pop, new wave, R&B, electro, soul and hip hop. For a song to be so unclassifiable means that it is original - and in decades of Eurovision, I doubt there has been a song even remotely similar to this. When you add in the flawless vocals and fascinating staging, this song is a winner to me.

**BebeLuigi** (10): I'm so glad this did as well as it did that was amazing

**criestotheclicking** (10): love this, Loïc is very endearing. This is the kind of song where the staging is weird but it works because the song is so good.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean this is just my vibe idk

**GapeCod** (10): Reminder that Heroes won over this.

**happyletuce06** (10): a performance for smart and sexy ppl

**Imtotallyfine.jpg** (10): This is my winner

**Kaylaboe** (10): YESSSSS

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): This sounded SO much like Royals, I remember everyone saying he was the male Lorde. But I love the song so much! It’s very imaginative for Eurovision. The performance was also the best that year, in my opinion. His vocals were crystal clear and the choreography was so cool.

**nootnoot781** (10): SHOULD HAVE WON!!!!!

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this performance goes off

**skargardin** (10): I fear that this is underappreciated

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): idk loic, you sound pretty on rhythm to me

**jaztinax** (9.5): this is very specific but he has always reminded me so much of lucas grabeel

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): is every song in 2015 good except the winner?

**speaknowred** (9.2): WOW

**iniekcja\_** (9): overwhelming in many ways but satisfying at the same time

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): One of the more fresh and modern sounding Eurovision songs, complete with some really fun staging. Also, clock SuRie (UK, 2018) as one of his backing singers!

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): this has reallyyyyyy grown on me. Belgium should get back to songs like this. The staging ❤️, the singing ❤️, the song 😍😍❤️

**Stryxen** (9): used to love this but i realised one day they look like pentatonix and i started hating it, but i still also love it

**afs** (8.5): me when I'm spinning around

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): This Royal rip-off is cute

**Martin1009** (8): That riff from the background-vocals scratches my brain perfectly

**daretheghost** (7.5): Gets a lot of flack for sounding like Royals but I mean… … …

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): the original bananis avocadis singer

**itsabop** (7.3): Admire any singer who can perform such notes laying down!

**guy\_like\_u** (7): this is has a really unique sound and the performance was A+

**vayyiqra** (7): Idk why I like this. Science cannot explain.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s okayyyyy

**moonagenightmares** (6.6): i really like his voice but the chorus is so meh

**apatel27** (6): It's forgettable but it's still a headbopper

# Ain't got rhythm

**CarlieScion** (6): well

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I was looking forwards to this one because I’ve listened to this guy’s music before but this song is pretty middling… check out *Sillygomania*, it’s a really good album. Do not look up his cover of “Chandelier” by Sia because it makes him look really stupid and also there’s a woman in blackface for some reason. But his album is good.

**hannahspants** (6): I always found the staging for this bad.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): Royals outsold

**noideawhatever** (6): i love the verses and bridge (we gonna rapapap rapapap tonight!), but i don't really like the chorus.

**s2pd** (6): A minimalistic composition needs to be set off by a killer melody. Also... Rappappap... Why?

**seanderlust** (6): the lyrics are kind of fun but the instrumental and vibe are just kind of boring. I think it's clear they tried to make a contrast between the verse and chorus that does not feel noticeable enough. plus one for that like triple pirhouette they did

**shhhneak** (6): Theatre kid energy.

**DefaultPophead** (5.7): This is obviously good but I just can't get into it as much as I'd like.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): this sounds vaguely familiar? i think i kinda remember this but like it's not that good

**frogaranaman** (5): this reminds me of those boring ass indie artists y'all have 5k scrobbles on

**Smuckles** (5): Remember Lorde? Looking forward to that Melodrama follow-up!

**ashandimlotion** (4.5): I usually love the weird ones but this was just a bit shit

**2dina3dworld** (4): why does this use a similar beat to the Whisper Song

**sirpancakeXI** (4): his voice just irk me so much

**welcome2thejam** (4): Most of these points are for that neat little spin he does

**emmaelf** (3): this just didn't do anything for me. it's dull.

**throwaway-7650** (3): snaps I've never seen a diam- [GUNSHOTS]

**Uberpigeon** (2): can we use our inside voices please

**MrSwearword** (1): Australia did better than them and iCannot believe this outranked them.

**musical\_pyn** (1): what in the imagine dragons

**thedoublebanana** (1): I don't understand the hype behind this song because vocally it's a mess, musically it's a mess, and the performance is trying too hard.

# Carly Rae Jepson - Run Away With Me

**frogaranaman** (10): this song clocked me as an f slur age ten

**GapeCod** (10): ~~You're stuck in my head, stuck in my heart, stuck in my body, body~~

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This is what I think a Eurovision song should be like, something that just sounds like a massive hit and looks like a slay. They nailed it!

**moooo566** (10): its a good meme, inside a good song

**shhhneak** (10): They went to the serve store and bought it out.

**skargardin** (10): it's the classic YAAAS

**Stryxen** (10): trying to add ballots to the indie girls rate rn and my laptop is lagging and this is playing this is so mental overstimulation vibes (10)

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the true winner of 2010 in my book

**ZebraSun73** (10): Humped a whole generation of Europeans into puberty

**seanderlust** (9.9): WAIT FUCK THIS WAS FROM EUROVISION??! LMAOOOOOOOOO

**moonagenightmares** (9.8): BOP

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): obviously the saxophone is the highlight, but if we ignore the meme it is still a strong song on its own.

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): electric violin? OMG? instant 10

**celladonn** (9): camp excellence

**babadork** (8.7): Each time I watch this performance, the sax player is such a surprise that he might as well be a jump scare.

**afs** (8.5): heyyyy that's familiar

**itsabop** (8.5): This is such a bop, it was totally robbed in the final

**bigbigbee** (8): This reminds me of Stereo Love, which I’m realizing would have been a banger Eurovision entry

**CarlieScion** (8): saxophone is iconic

**iniekcja\_** (8): Moldova has always understood camp like no other, it's unreal

**noideawhatever** (8): a legendary meme and a slapping song. moldova is also really good at this eurovision thing

**nootnoot781** (8): it’s simultaneously robbed and also not robbed at the same time

**nt96** (8): The way all the thirsty gays will go crazy for this....

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): Run Away With Me???

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I had no clue this was a Eurovision entry

**daretheghost** (7.5): Corny but charming, as is tradition with Moldova.

**s2pd** (7.5): Another fun bop

**speaknowred** (7.4): Messy but the sax saves it

**cremeebrulee** (7): a song titled this with a saxophone? LMFAOOOO good luck charlie

**Martin1009** (7): Moldova really is peak eurovision

# a song that has run away in the title but isn't as good as run away with me idk

**ashandimlotion** (6.5): hey mamma would’ve gotten a 9 at LEAST!!

**No-Place-to-Go** (6.5): This is the most 2010 thing ever oml.

**TiltControls** (6.5): I wish this was just an instrumental tbh

**berober04** (6): I love memes

**Kaylaboe** (6): lbr this is iconic but the song itself? yeah 22nd place was appropriate

**Smuckles** (6): Memelords

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That sax makes me angry

**DefaultPophead** (5.2): I'm buying the next train ticket to Bucharest to get away from this song. Please don't let that sax guy hump the air near me ever again. I feel sick.

**akanewasright** (5): I do not have thoughts on this

**criestotheclicking** (5): The best parts of this song are everything but the two lead singers. I love that guy who just spins in the back for no reason

**Uberpigeon** (5): this feels weird in context

**emmaelf** (4): if normal violins have already won, how do we beat that? led strips on an electric violin! gyrating sax player! it's basically an ibiza club anthem. i'm not a club person.

**MoonlightByWindow** (4): anyone who says they listen to this song for anything other than the saxophone is lying

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (4): the sax solo is great!! As we all know 😏. But the rest of the song is average. I don’t know if that is a controversial opinion but I’m sorry big it is 😭

**Awkward\_King** (2): dont let the meme fool you this song is BAD

**2dina3dworld** (1): outside of the sax this sucks, and the sax sounds really out of place (but it does bop)

# 🎷🎷

**vayyiqra** (11): Look, you already know the meme, just accept that it's a good song too. also Darj told me to 11 it so I'm going to be based and do it

**apatel27** (10): Epic Sax Guy was the moment

**thedoctordances1940** (10): yeah it's just europop bliss and like it's fucking sax guy

**welcome2thejam** (10): Epic Sax Guy you will always be famous!!!

**you2009** (10): I dance exactly like epic sax guy sometimes he knows what's up

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): oh yeah that meme, throwback

**happyletuce06** (8): unironically a bop, easy to dismiss because of the meme but it's actually an amazing song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): 100% read “& Rita Ora” for a sec after seeing the arti-MEME SONG?????

**Melody** (8): Epic Sax Guy aside - this song is a BOP.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.6): that sax guy is from THIS?

**astrologicalangel** (7): epic sax guy is iconic, but the violin was also amazing

**BebeLuigi** (7): I'm not sure if I like this song because it's a bop or because of that meme on stage

**guy\_like\_u** (7): the epic sax guy origin story! I love that each person on stage looks like they dressed for a different party

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): It's classic Eurovision cheese, and there's a reason the saxophonist became the viral "Epic Sax Guy" - that riff is exquisite.

**musical\_pyn** (7): epic sax guy is from EUROVISION?????? How did I not know this????

**veryanniev** (7): there is so much to appreciate here besides the Epic Sax Guy: the rotating entrance of the violin player, the female singer powerful vocals and her editorial blue eye mask makeup, the absolutely mismatched fashion choices of everyone involved, the male singer pulling a Dima Bilan at the end — and of course the Epic Sax Guy. dare I say it’s camp?

**hannahspants** (6): horrific song but it gets 6 points for epic sax guy

**jaztinax** (6): hearing the saxophone lick inside a song and not for itself and not being looped for 10 hours straight feels… wrong

**RandomHypnotica** (6): if I could only dissassociate this song from the embarassing memories of Epic Sax Guy

**awkward\_penguin** (5.6): Darude's Sandstorm with an epic sax guy.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): please tell me there aren’t people in this rate too young to recognize the sax line please

**thedoublebanana** (5): Only reason this isn't lower is because of epic sax guy.

**MrSwearword** (1): Yes, I know it's the thing that spawned the "epic sax guy" meme but I do not care. This song is trash, the gimmick was stale and I hated it when they came back in like five or six years from this.

**racloves** (8.5): a bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Our final elimination of the day goes to this cute bop from Greece! Honestly, this is basically just a Britney Spears song, but I love Britney and so does everyone else, so it that even a bad thing? The dancing is great and Kalomira sounds great while doing it, honestly I was expecting this to may Day 3! Still, 21st place is nothing to scoff at.

---
# What I want when I'm smiling

**musical\_pyn** (11): this is just a genuinely great pop song, I would listen to this outside of the rate anytime

**akanewasright** (10): this is just a wordier genie in a bottle… but fortunately I like words and I like genie in a bottle

**ashandimlotion** (10): the best thing about Eurovision is the godawful lyrics and this takes the cake in that respect. And performing in front of that Sims 4 Romantic Garden stuff pack set, she deserved the win! The song also reminds me a bit of the song in Music & Lyrics that the vapid pop star sings. Obsessed!

**Awkward\_King** (10): if you told me this was a sharpay solo from HSM3 id believe you

**MrSwearword** (10): How did this place third? It's such a bop and had such a deliciously tacky staging.

**noideawhatever** (10): really good wtf

**seanderlust** (10): this is like a very well-made rave.dj mashup of reloaded by lady gaga and buttons by the pcd and by that I mean it is very yass and slay

**TiltControls** (10): this is everything that I want out of a late 2000's song. Is it good? idk, but it is a moment

**moonagenightmares** (9.5): this song slays wtf how did i forget about it

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): you can never go wrong with these greek vibe.

**iniekcja\_** (9): sweet lord the staging that year

**jaztinax** (9): best entry from greece ever methinks

**RandomHypnotica** (9): "and I've got that combination, 27-99-23"

**Stryxen** (9): wait why is this so good and bad and camp and serious and slay she’s serving

**welcome2thejam** (9): Me after I lock the hotel room safe

**speaknowred** (8.8): Really good and could have won as well

**thedoublebanana** (8.8): As much as I don't like Kalomira's "baby voice" I can't deny this is a bop.

**indie\_fan\_** (8.7): It's got those Timbaland X Britney Spears vibes, I gotta give it a positive score

**itsabop** (8.7): How did this come in 3rd? Deserved to win!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): how is this is even a Eurovision song this is just is a 2000’s main pop girl song

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): this and shady lady both being better than believe

**afs** (8): is it just me or does the video's audio quality seem slightly messed up

**BebeLuigi** (8): That giant book is still one of the best props I've seen on the Eurovision stage

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): If you’re gonna rip something off, might as well rip off something great!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): go off slut queen!

**Kaylaboe** (8): the chokehold greece's laïko era had on the entire continent

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): I love this, a real guilty pleasure. Perhaps I was too harsh on the other 2008 songs but this slaps

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): if I didn’t know better I would guess this was produced by Timbaland

**throwaway-7650** (8): performance is rather 10 year break-coded

**whatyourheartdesires** (8): I love ethnic bops

**emmaelf** (7.5): so catchy but the lyrics ick me out. is your secret combination really the centre of your heart?

**happyletuce06** (7.5): in same vein as shady lady, great and boppy

**LesApfels** (7.5): This feels like a musical number by the mean girl in a Disney channel original movie

**babadork** (7.3): I’m getting My Super Sweet 16 performance vibes, but I still like it.

**CarlieScion** (7): it’s pretty cute but also basic

**celladonn** (7): bad lyrics but it's pretty fun

**CrimsonROSET** (7): password

**daretheghost** (7): Feels behind the musical curve for 2008.

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): why does she remind me of Sharpay Evans

**skargardin** (7): I had forgotten about this, cute little bop

**Smuckles** (7): Lot's of fun!

**vayyiqra** (7): Suddenly it's 1997 again and I don't mind it.

# What goes wrong when I'm crying

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this is like the popular girls in my high school who thought they were the next Jessica Simpson and would be the lead in the school musical

**guy\_like\_u** (6): the way I didn’t even need to look it up to know this came out the same year as Circus

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I know Eurovision is full of awkwardly-worded English songs by non-English-speaking writers, but I can’t really get past this one in particular. Idk, “secret combination” just sounds like a really robotic, unemotional metaphor for love

**s2pd** (5.5): Mediocre song, grating voice

**apatel27** (5): Sorry but no pretty privilege here

**astrologicalangel** (5): I liked the set at least?

**DefaultPophead** (5): She has such good energy, but this song and her voice made my ears bleed. I really wish I liked this.

**frogaranaman** (5): omg finally a song about my locker combination

**LunaMoonMeUp** (5): The song is fun, but not fun enough. She's giving you serviceable vocals, but nothing that blows you away. It's an emphatic meh from me.

**awkward\_penguin** (4.8): It feels like Shady Lady but everything was a notch worse

**criestotheclicking** (4): did not enjoy that.

**hannahspants** (4): also meh

**Uberpigeon** (4): its like a britney outtake. unfortunately i dont like britney

**shhhneak** (3.5): She learned this choreography from Lindsay Lohan in Mykonos.

**thedoctordances1940** (3.3): i'm sorry but this song just isn't really any good, her singing is not great, the melody is just ridiculously boring and the metaphor is kinda dumb

**flavasavavandal** (3): they let Scott Storch produce a song in Eurovision?

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Would be a banger if the performer didn't have the vocal range of a rat

GapeCod: I wish Sound of Silence was sung by Kylie so it would have got eliminated day 1 as it deserved to, but other than that and the robberies of Rhythm Inside and UNO these results are more than acceptable.
