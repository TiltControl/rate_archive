21st Century Eurovision Rate
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/tum6qr/21st_century_eurovision_rate/

# EDIT 5/11/22: The Rate is due on **May 21st.** If you need extra time DM one of the hosts and we will mark you down for an extension of up to 2 days.

Good Evening Popheads! This is your hosts u/TakeOnMeByA-ha and u/racloves calling, and welcome to the 21st Century Eurovision rate! This is a super exciting rate for both of us, not only because this is both of our first times hosting a rate, but this is also the first time* the subreddit is doing a rate solely dedicated to the world’s longest running televised music competition, the Eurovision Song Contest!

(Ok, so that last part was kinda a lie; there have been several Eurovision-related rate-type events on this subreddit before, including [two](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5zebgs/rpopheads_fantasy_eurovision_introduction/) [different](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/6qy4ww/rpopheads_fantasy_eurovision_part_ii/) “fantasy Eurovision” contests, as well as a completely different [“Worldvision”](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/cx956z/popheads_worldvision_scores_now_open/) rate. However, neither of these used the typical rate format you all are used to, and none of the songs featured in these rates were ever performed in Eurovision proper, so as far as I’m concerned, this is the first *real* Eurovision rate on this sub.)

Beginning in 1956 as a way to bring the countries of Europe together after World War II, Eurovision has grown into a musical phenomenon, with almost every country in Europe (and even some outside of it!) partaking every year to see who can create the best three minute pop song. And while early years of the show have been more traditional and laid back events, as the years went by, Eurovision slowly turned into one of the most chaotic and campiest competitions you’ll ever see, with the 21st century bringing in some of the most iconic performances ever put to television. From songs about [British airlines making the least subtle innuendos you’ll ever hear](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XT6yOIC6ihI), to [EDM Vampires](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OV3xp5ZXSYA), to even [a rock band in full monster make up and costumes singing about their plans to take over the world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gAh9NRGNhUU)(and winning the whole show on top of that!). But despite all of Eurovision’s cheesiness and over-the-top performances, it’s easy to forget that under all of this, theres still some great and fantastically creative songs that have took the stage over the contest’s run, and today, we’re going to take a look at 60 of the most iconic songs since the turn of the century. Get ready to embrace the joy and chaos of Eurovision, and may your douze, er...onze points prosper!

# MAIN RATE

While making a list that everyone will be pleased with is pretty much impossible (and understandably so, there have been more than 500 songs that have been entered in the contest since 2000!), several different criteria were used to try to make this list as objective a “greatest of Eurovision” rate could possibly be. For starters, all 21 winning songs from 2000 to 2021 were included, both because they are among the most well remembered songs, as well as ensuring every year had at least one song to represent it; we don’t wanna leave anyone behind! From there, songs were included based on a multitude of different reasons. From ranking high in the overall scoreboard (an additional 20 songs included in this rate placed either 2nd or 3rd overall), to being notable fan favorites, to other reasons that aren’t really related to Eurovision as a whole, such as a song becoming a well known meme outside of the Eurovision-verse to just being a song that we think an average popheads user would enjoy. We also decided to set a limit of only four songs being allowed per year, in order to have a more diverse selection and to prevent certain years from having significantly more songs than others (believe me, I would’ve included half of the 2021 songs if I could…). We hope that everyone, from die hard Eurovision fans, to casual listeners, to those who might not even know what Eurovision is and are just doing the rate out of curiosity, will have a fun time with the selection we have for you:

**IMPORTANT NOTE!**: Normally, for rates like this, we would just link a Spotify/Apple Music playlist that has all of these songs for you to listen to and tell you to rate based on what you hear there. However, because the live performances of Eurovision are an essential part to these songs' legacies, as well as many of said live performances being superior to their studio recordings, we highly, HIGHLY, encourage you to view [this YouTube playlist](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLP6j7u27zsGU_b0v_wu-7M93UTz9t1K6D) that features all of the live performances of the songs in the main rate. Again, this isn’t necessarily *required* viewing, but you would be missing a very important part of the reason these songs are so acclaimed to begin with, so I would highly recommend watching this playlist at least once.

ALSO, if you live in America, [HERE](https://vimeo.com/showcase/9211202) is a link to a vimeo playlist that features the live performances for songs that may be region locked for you (For some reason, all live performances from 2016 onwards are not able to be watched in America, and this affects ONLY America for some reason. As an American myself I don't get it either).

# BONUS RATE

“But wait a minute!”, an uniformed rater might say, “Why are there no songs from 2020 in the main rate?” Well, I think you could be able to guess the reason pretty easily, but in case you can’t, the 2020 contest had to be canceled due to concerns of the coronavirus and being a potential superspreader event. However, even though the show was canceled, there *was* a full lineup of songs that would’ve been performed had the show gone on as normal. So to commemorate the show that never was, we’re going to take a listen to some of the most popular songs of that year, and crown our own unofficial Eurovision 2020 winner! Remember that this is the bonus rate, and as such you CANNOT give any of these songs your 11 or 0.

1. Athena Manoukian - Chains on You (Armenia)
2. Daði & Gagnamagnið - Think About Things (Iceland)
3. Diodato - Fai Rumore (Italy)
4. Efendi - Cleopatra (Azerbaijan)
5. Hurricane - Hasta La Vista (Serbia)
6. Little Big - UNO (Russia)
7. The Mamas - Move (Sweden)
8. The Roop - On Fire (Lithuania)
9. Victoria - Tears Getting Sober (Bulgaria)

# THE RULES

If you’ve done rates on here before, you’re probably already familiar with how this works. If you’re new to rates, PLEASE read the following!

- **You must listen to and assign a score to EVERY song in the main rate, no exceptions.** If your ballot is missing any scores, I will not accept it until you fix it. 

- The bonus rate is optional, you can rate as many or as few songs as you’d like. However, even if you choose to not do the bonus rate, do NOT delete it from your ballot, as it will not be able to be read properly in the rate machine we use to process ballots.

- **You may assign songs a score between 1 and 10, 1 being the lowest and 10 being the highest.** You can also use decimal places if you wish, but only up to one point (ex. a 8.5 or a 6.9 is ok, but a 3.14 is not).

- **You may give ONE song an 11 and ONE song a 0.** Use these on your favorite and least favorite tracks, respectively. Reminder again that you CAN NOT give any of the bonus rate songs an 11 or a 0.

- **DO NOT SABOTAGE!** Sabotage can be hard to detect in grab bags like this, but ballots with extremely low overall averages and/or giving all songs from specific countries low scores may be rejected unless scores are explained and justified with comments. Speaking of…

- **You are highly encouraged (though not required) to leave comments alongside your scores!** To leave a comment, simply type a space after the score of a song and type to your heart’s content, like so:

>KEiiNO - Spirit in the Sky: 10 Outsold Norman Greenbaum!

- **This is the ONLY correct way to leave comments.** Any other format will break the rate program and I will be very sad. Please remember to format them properly!
