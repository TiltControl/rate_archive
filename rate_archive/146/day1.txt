Strap yourselves in, it's going to be a *wild* reveal.

The reveal starts at **3PM EST**, or in approximately an hour from when this post goes up.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Alright, I think I need to give a formal apology for this one. Many, MANY people have told me in the songs that should've been included google form that Lejla should've been included in this rate in place of this song, and I wholeheartedly, 100% agree. I honestly don't know how that song completely slipped my mind when it came to making this list, and furthermore I kinda regret including this song as well (ignore the fact I gave it a 10 anyway). Like, is it iconic that Lithuania sent a song called We Are the Winners that consists entirely of old men saying they're the winners of Eurovision? Of fucking course it is. But it's not exactly a "song" really either. At least the other troll/meme songs in the rate have something else to them to make you want to listen to them outside of being a joke, which isn't really something I can say for this song.

Actually who am I kidding the fact that a song called We Are The Winners got last place is fucking hilarious and I'm glad I included solely for that reason

**racloves** (8): and in the most iconic of popheads rates fashion, this song comes last. probably deserved, but still unbelievably hilarious

---
# The winners
**2dina3dworld** (10): I need a meta ~~song that commentates on Eurovision while attempting to hypnotise the listener into voting for them~~ angel

**CarlieScion** (10): the amount of confidence this song has fskndjknfjdsnfkjsdnf

**MrSwearword** (10): if only because you cannot fuck with the quality of troll entries of Eurovision in the mid-aughts.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): bless their hearts for trying

**Stryxen** (10): but also a 1

**thedoctordances1940** (10): in our hearts you are <3

**throwaway-7650** (10): the twice of EVS (both got 6th in reality)

**afs** (9): VOTE FOR THE WINNERS

**Melody** (9): yall cant take a joke!

**moooo566** (9): i was obsessed with this at the time. just standing there in suits declaring themselves the winners already. to this day its the boldest move ive ever seen.

**welcome2thejam** (9): That bald man's moves were life-changing

**criestotheclicking** (8): I mean this is in incredibly unsporting taste but it’s also just funny (+ catchy)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I think this is my camp 8 in this rate. This entire rate is camp however having a song called “We Are the Winners” and lose is next-level. This is a mediocre white man slay

**noideawhatever** (8): lmao wtf they deadass submitted an actual shitpost. and the song is actually catchy as fuck

**whatyourheartdesires** (8): is it a meta joke? Joke entry?An attempt to hypnotise the audience? Who cares, it’s amazing

**speaknowred** (7.6): Very fun

**apatel27** (7.5): crossed the line between annoying pub goers and fun drunk uncles a few too many times

**TiltControls** (7.5): gotta say, I appreciate the boldness

**awkward\_penguin** (7.1): Absolutely A-level trolling from Lithuania. The fake guitar solo but on a violin? The dance break done by a flailing middle-aged bald man? The megaphone? Brilliant. The song itself isn't horrible either, and the men know how to perform.

**akanewasright** (7): so true, coming for that perfect 10 average

**astrologicalangel** (7): gotta respect the confidence

**GapeCod** (7): oh my god this is so camp.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Honestly… it takes nerve.

**guy\_like\_u** (7): ok but they killed this. I forgot about baldy who absolutely SLAYED. It’s somehow even better because the audience thought it was serious and booed them to high heaven

**hannahspants** (7): the winners of Eurovision and my heart

**iniekcja\_** (7): men

**nootnoot781** (7): 16 years later and lithuania remains the only country in the baltics to never win eurovision… they cursed themselves.

**s2pd** (7): I love that this happened

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): is this revisionist history

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.8): this is funny as hell

**bigbigbee** (6.5): This reminds me of pub songs and I love a pub song

**DefaultPophead** (6.5): I need this energy in my life. Peak mental breakdown music.

**ashandimlotion** (6): I’m glad these sorts of entries exist for the show... but the song my dear... it’s trash

**happyletuce06** (6): respect the comedy, the song is not that good

**Smuckles** (6): *Ron Howard voice* They weren't

**thedoublebanana** (6): In the moment, hilarious. Now, not so much.

**veryanniev** (6): fuck the audience, this is hilarious

# The losers

**CrimsonROSET** (5): point and laugh

**LunaMoonMeUp** (5): It's hard to rate as a song because... it's just a joke. It is a fun and memorable joke though.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): it’s a 0 and a 10 simultaneously

**flavasavavandal** (4): you cannot convince me these guys couldn’t come up with a song to perform in time for Eurovision 2006, so they just started yelling at the audience to vote for them to a tune they made up on the spot

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): I know this is meant to be a joke song but that doesn't make it any less annoying

**Martin1009** (4): 1:40 Me doing Chanel's dancebreak

**musical\_pyn** (4): camp (derogatory)

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (4): maybe I’m too harsh on jokey entries 😞

**moonagenightmares** (3.5): ““We Are The Winners” was one of the few Eurovision songs to get booed” rip

**No-Place-to-Go** (3.5): Press x to doubt.

**seanderlust** (3.5): LT United has talent. LT United is unique, I can see that. Nerve? They had the nerve to declare themselves the winner in their damn entry song. Charisma? I don't see any. They're just LT UNTed.

**BebeLuigi** (3): It's mostly annoying to me sdqfsqdfq

**emmaelf** (3): look. i know it was a troll song. but i still have standards.

**itsabop** (3): They really thought

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): this performance is one of the biggest “what the fuck did i just watch” eurovision performances in recent history

**sirpancakeXI** (3): this is camp but not camp enough for a 10

**babadork** (2.1): Would this be funny if I knew more than one football chant? The guy on the far left is great, though.

**ignitethephoenix** (2): me when I get 6th place

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): You don't have to tell me whether or not this won, I already know

**Awkward\_King** (1): its funny because they arent

**cremeebrulee** (1): misandry activated why are men like this

**daretheghost** (1): Totally original comment about this winning neither Eurovision nor this rate.

**DirtyRat583** (1): i hope these cheeky monkeys didnt win

**frogaranaman** (1): you are the losers

**plastichaxan** (1): i thought this said we are the wieners at first and thought it was camp but it's just bad

**shhhneak** (1): I get “it” but it’s funnier if I sabotage.

**skargardin** (1): I can't in good faith even say that there's the good kind of camp value

**vayyiqra** (1): Not if I can help it you're not winning because god this is annoying. What a waste of an instrumental.

**celladonn** (0): Booooo I really do find this so cringe

**fadedblue09** (0): I cannot being proud to be Lithuanian after this

**ImADudeDuh** (0): I get that you should dress for the job you want but why did they have to still sound like drunks at a football match?

**jaztinax** (0): they were bold for this but they were very wrong

**Kaylaboe** (0): this made the rate and lejla didn't. bosnia & herzegovina true winner

**nt96** (0): lol get their ass popheads

**RoyalBloodFool** (0): Yeah they are the winners. This is the best for a team yell in a camp.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): i dislike arrogance.

**Uberpigeon** (0): the big girl... wins!

**racloves** (6.5): I do agree with this song being out second, probably the most forgettable winner


**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): I'm honestly kinda shocked this is the second song out? Not that I particularly like this song all that much, but it feels so inoffensive compared to some of the other songs that somehow ranked above it. Most commenters agree that this is one of the weakest winners and that Shady Lady and Secret Combination were more deserving of first place, which I do fully agree with, and probably led to this song getting a much lower score than it would if it didn't win. Also uh...I wasn't aware of this when the rate started but apparently this guy also supports Putin's war on Ukraine so I don't exactly feel bad for him anymore. Bye!

---
# Believe it...
**jaztinax** (10): most underrated winner and the most beautiful song!!!!

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): In many ways it was another ballad, but Dima's performance sold it with every atom of his body.

**Melody** (9): Justin Timberlake style beat

**apatel27** (8): Vintage Timbaland

**ashandimlotion** (8): this song is super dated and corny, but I kind of love it?? It’s basically what Westlife wishes they were doing 8 years prior

**iniekcja\_** (8): 2008 me was fascinated

**plastichaxan** (8): a good ballad? on my popheads rate? more likely than you think

**moonagenightmares** (7.6): i think my mom had a crush on this dude ive heard this song way too many times as a kid

**afs** (7.5): gaga take notes on how to attract boos

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is so 2000’s but he sounds good

**ZebraSun73** (7.5): That this song won instead of Qele Qele... nothing but a scandal and a shame.

**cremeebrulee** (7): why does he kind of remind me of the pop star villian in the lizzie mcguire movie

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I love you Jesus by Trisha Paytas plays

**MrSwearword** (7): but that's because that was how pretty Dima Bilan was that year on a scale of one to ten. Seriously, My Secret Combination got robbed for this?

**Stryxen** (7): he’s so hot

**seanderlust** (6.7): yes it's cheesy - it's the same faux-inspiration that comes with songs like roar and fight song - but god his voice sounds great

**babadork** (6.5): While this is boring, I am glad that I now know that Enrique Iglesias has a Russian doppleganger.

**emmaelf** (6.5): i didn't remember the song at all, only the staging. the song's fine - very middle of the road.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): If this were just a bit more ‘00s and sung by a woman (think, like, Brandy or Xtina) it would be a massive banger

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): why is his eye contact with the camera so intense akfdsfksd

**sirpancakeXI** (6.5): let's just stick with the studio version and forget about the figure skater

**DefaultPophead** (6.1): Pretty good, but I probably won't think about this song ever again. The guy on skates, though...

# ...or not

**daretheghost** (6): Inspirational-By-Numbers Eurovision songs are one of my least favorite Eurovision subgenres and this one’s definitely up there.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Kris Angel snapped a bit

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): this guy is putting so much effort in trying to seem as into the performance as the ice skater and it is wayyyy to much, like why did this man feel the need to rip his top open? Anyway the song was boring so

**nt96** (6): cher outsold

**s2pd** (6): Mediocre song, dramatic performance

**speaknowred** (6): meh Ukraine should have won

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I guess it’s better than your average 90’s boyband song

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): did foot fetishists seriously manage to make this boring af song win????? The staging is iconic but the actual song is so bad

**akanewasright** (5): extra points off bc this isn’t Cher wtf

**celladonn** (5): cheesy boring song but i kind of love the performance

**criestotheclicking** (5): for some reason this does nothing for me. I may as well have been listening to static.

**frogaranaman** (5): why does he look like Jesus in the cover art

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): the figure skater is kinda the only cool thing bc im falling asleep while watching this sorry Dima

**Uberpigeon** (5): i believe i just got a foot fetish

**welcome2thejam** (5): Going full pop heartthrob on this one

**CarlieScion** (4): who put a deep cut from One Direction - Up All Night here???

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): I did theater and this guy’s whole energy is that he’d be the understudy for Pippin and poison the lead

**indie\_fan\_** (4): Boy better ease it on the vibrato, if you can even call it that

**Kaylaboe** (4): such a lame winner. everything abt it is so calculated and dull

**awkward\_penguin** (3.6): Interesting staging, but the song is so fucking boring, and he was out of tune for a good part.

**noideawhatever** (3): first song i almost skipped here. sleep inducing.

**nootnoot781** (3): fucking boring winner, russia’s entries from 2007 and 2009 are far better than this snoozefest.

**shhhneak** (3): This is so theatrical for no reason.

**skargardin** (3): I used to love this but mama this has NOT aged well

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): it’s so weird how Rybak did the same thing so much better only one year later

**vayyiqra** (3): boring sorry!

**veryanniev** (3): although I’m Russian and this song is slightly nostalgic and also his win is a reason I started watching Eurovision in the first place… this REEKS of desperation and I hate to see it

**TiltControls** (2.5): I considered giving this lower, but then the figure skater showed up to save the show

**throwaway-7650** (2.2): ouuu he thinks he's hot and can hit those notes ouuu

**hannahspants** (2): worst winner of the early 2000s. His 2006 (2005?) song was way better

**LesApfels** (2): I believe this song is mediocre

**LunaMoonMeUp** (2): Does throwing enough money at an entry distract people from a bad song? With an Olympic figure skater performing to the music of a Stradivarius... I believe you can.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (2): this song was bad, I much preferred his 2006 entry. I respect the effort though. They put EVERYTHING into this performance

**Smuckles** (2): Pants. Quite possibly the longest song I've heard as well.

**whatyourheartdesires** (2): one of the worst Eurovision winners, the song does nothing for me

**2dina3dworld** (1): I HATE CHEESY SEXLESS POP BALLADS

**Awkward\_King** (1): he has such ayo where my hug at energy

**BebeLuigi** (1): I hesitated on using my 0 here...

**GapeCod** (1): Как же мне стыдно это слушать... that one high note near the end is cute but oh my god this DID NOT DESERVE TO WIN

**guy\_like\_u** (1): girl, it was camp

**thedoublebanana** (1): This only won because Ukraine, Greece, and Armenia split the girl pop vote. The song is not great and Dima cannot sing.

**you2009** (1): this is usually the kind of "doing too much" that I appreciate but I just can't take this kind of sentiment seriously from a country club pool boy like where is the sincerity?

**happyletuce06** (0): the blandest winner ever

**Martin1009** (0): Can we pretend this didn't happen? "now i have another title, eurovision title"

**racloves** (3): running scared from how bad this song is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): If there was any song in this rate I was absolutely *positive* would’ve been last place, it was this one. I mean, it has almost everything popheads hates rolled into one song: a heterosexual love ballad with boring performers and a MAN singing?? What is there to like? Well…apparently enough for it to not get last place and even pick up someone’s 11. 2011 is almost universally considered by Eurovision fans to be the weakest year of the contest in the last decade, and this song somehow being considered the best of its field and winning is a pretty good indicator of just how bad the rest of this year was, because a song like this wouldn’t even *qualify* if it was entered today. Just completely boring and unoriginal all around.

---
# 'Cause I adore you <3
**thedoctordances1940** (11): on paper i feel like i should not like this but it genuinely just does it for me, idk if it's the nostalgia but i fucking love this

**Stryxen** (10): and that is what they call “a classic”

**moonagenightmares** (9.4): this is surprisingly good (it kinda sounds like a 1d song)

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): It's cheesy but it's so good!

**DefaultPophead** (8.6): No, they have no chemistry nor stage presence. But yes, this is a great song.

**afs** (8.5): I thought it was Nicki :/

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Good but lacks something to take it over the edge

**shhhneak** (8.1): Me wondering if that’s fire or just lights falling for 3 minutes.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): I’m going to have to change my name after typing this but I love this song 👀. Deserved winner

**throwaway-7650** (8): this is a HSM:TM:TS song in that it's het (+ they have no chemistry) and will be tanked accordingly when it shouldn't be

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's cute

**ashandimlotion** (7): overhated! Who cares if the Azerbaijani delegation were marching voters across the borders to vote for their entries.. the song is a cute bop!

**BebeLuigi** (7): I know it's quite an unpopular winner but I actually like this one more than most winners sdqfsfqsdf

**speaknowred** (7): Boring but I liked the fake romance

**CarlieScion** (6): what in the Disney channel original movie soundtrack

**criestotheclicking** (6): sounds like a Keane song. I bet this is better as a studio track - the staging is slapdash which is a shame because the song is pretty.

**emmaelf** (6): i was about to ask how i forgot this existed. then i remembered. it's boring. professional, well-executed, pretty, but boring.

**Kaylaboe** (6): i don't hate this as much as other eurofans do but it's kinda funny that it won

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): this sounds like it could be on the heartstopper soundtrack

# Yeah I'm running alright

**akanewasright** (5.5): this was cute, but you can tell they only won because this year was overall horrendous

**s2pd** (5.5): boring song made worse by the annoying oh oh's

**awkward\_penguin** (5): This song is the definition of average. Ell is cute though!

**bigbigbee** (5): I keep switching between thinking I don’t like this because…I don’t like this…and thinking I like this, because it reminds me of Coldplay’s Yellow

**frogaranaman** (5): sounds like it would play on the Christian radio stations

**happyletuce06** (5): one of the most hated winners for a reason

**iniekcja\_** (5): this had no impact at all

**jaztinax** (5): i was going to say, why did this win when (blank) was right there, then i browsed through all the songs that year and realized i knew none of them. I forgot to watch that year oops?

**Martin1009** (5): the beginning of the "buy-a-song-from-sweden-era"

**MrSwearword** (5): who knew running could feel like such a chore.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): how tf did this win

**skargardin** (5): maybe balladphobia actually made some points

**thedoublebanana** (5): In the moment, it was an okay ballad, but since then there really hasn't been any traction to this song and it just feels bland.

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I love how all the comments are in Turkish because that year Turkey flopped super hard so suddenly we’re proud of Azerbaijan winning instead

**whatyourheartdesires** (5): forgettable

**CrimsonROSET** (4): but why are you scared

**daretheghost** (4): What a boring winner.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): this is definitely a toilet break performance

**sirpancakeXI** (4): literally how did this win, it made no sense.

**vayyiqra** (4): What 2000s teen drama is this from (joke)

**apatel27** (2): What is this straight guy ballad doing here

**berober04** (2): what in the early era Coldplay is this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): I feel like they’re playing some Contemporary Christian Music to lure me into their religious cult

**hannahspants** (2): worst winner of the 2010s. Without a shadow of a doubt. But it's a competent pop song. I guess.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): what episode from The OC was this in?

**2dina3dworld** (1): okay this is supposed to be a romantic duet but I’m filing this under the category of “sexless Eurovision pop ballads” because they have absolutely zero chemistry.

**Awkward\_King** (1): by far one of my least fav winners ever. nobody moved.

**fadedblue09** (1): a lot of these duets are lacking in chemistry

**guy\_like\_u** (1): I remember being so confused when this won. I still have no idea what happened here. The YouTube views would tend to agree that no one remembers this fondly

**nootnoot781** (1): azerbaijan came hungry for a win in the late 00s-early 10s and somehow the entry they put the least amount of effort into won.

**ZebraSun73** (1): This was not good in 2011 and I think it might be even worse than i remember.

**itsabop** (0): Worst winner of the 21st century, and these two have no chemistry

**LunaMoonMeUp** (0): It's inoffensive to the point where I'm offended. It's a bland nothing of a song, with a lacklustre live performance, that inexplicably won the whole thing somehow. Mindboggling.

**veryanniev** (0): the most forgettable Eurovision winner in the last 22 years

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i cannot fucking believe we've rated tatu's eurovision song before all the things she said

**racloves** (4): you get to the final of the Eurovision Song Contest, and that’s the outfit and hair you choose?

---
# The LGBT+ Community
**plastichaxan** (11): this is almost an 11 on studio and then i watched the performance and made it camp like

**2dina3dworld** (10): okay the live performance was kinda tragic but the song itself is pretty good, like 10 level good. Tbh, it kinda sounds like an AKB48 song

**you2009** (10): I know this one is controversial but I just love the frantic energy of this and I listened to them too much in my teens to ever truly hate a song of theirs that's my personal flaw and I acknowledge it

**throwaway-7650** (9.9): I love how they're harmonizing unintentionally

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Oh this is edgy… I like

**iniekcja\_** (8): they predicted this rate and started campaigning for an 11 back in 2003

**Melody** (8): its Tatu so its already amazing

**nt96** (8): Looking back, the chokehold these girls had on America with the lesbian controversy was bonkers

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): the studio version is a serve, the live version… exists

**Smuckles** (8): Always a good amount of melodrama to T.a.t.u songs, I appreciate it.

**ZebraSun73** (8): For old t.A.T.u. stan times sake I will give this an 8.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the fake lesbians ate but also their voices sound rough

**ashandimlotion** (7): cannot compete with their bigger hits

**criestotheclicking** (7): in concept that was amazing, but the fact that one of them was out of tune the entire time is unfortunate.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): what are they doing to Brazil we’re not in Eurovision

**flavasavavandal** (7): All The Things She Said is an 8.5 btw

**guy\_like\_u** (7): the way this song had me in a chokehold in 2003

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): added a few points after listening to the recorded version because I realised that this song is fun and it was just their live performance that was pretty awful!

**Kaylaboe** (6.5): everything about this was messy and i live for it

**shhhneak** (6.4): I’m dead I’ve never listened to t.A.t.U and never seen a photo of them and thought they were a teenage hyper pop artist this whole time.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.3): i feel like this is a good song that the live performance just didn't do any justice

**sirpancakeXI** (6.2): she really put in zero effort for the performance and still ended up third.

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.1): extra points just for tatu

# Queerbaiters
**daretheghost** (6): I have complicated feelings about tAtU and what they do and do not represent but all that aside, this song is fine enough albeit very of its time.

**Martin1009** (6): chorus-vocals as bad as brividi

**skargardin** (6): well.. the staging is cool at least

**thedoublebanana** (6): Over the years, this has become less and less of a compelling song. I think the performance outsold the song.

**Uberpigeon** (6): is it abrasive in a hyperpop way or in a bad way i cant tell

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I have been reliably informed that tAtU are very good, and I’m glad that I trust that person, because I would NOT believe it listening to this

**moonagenightmares** (5.5): i thought i was going to love this because its tatu but it really wasnt giving

**DefaultPophead** (5.4): Feel awkward about the homophobia, but it's still pretty good.

**CarlieScion** (5): will this do disproportionally well just bc it’s an artist American popheads will recognise? (Yes)

**emmaelf** (5): oh t.A.t.U, it's so hard to separate them from their music video controversy. but this song was okay. i imagine it would have been a lot better with autotune on an album.

**GapeCod** (5): Oh the lyrics really aren't it... Легенды квирбейтинга.

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Wanted to like this more since t.A.t.U were one of the few artists I knew going into the rate but unfortunately this is just kinda them shouting over and over

**hannahspants** (5): they've got much better stuff

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (5): all the things you said is better 🤷‍♂️

**s2pd** (5): I used to be a fan, but looking back it wasn't very good. Hardly any melody

**vayyiqra** (5): Nope not touching the Discourse about this group! Anyway this feels a bit like "Not Gonna Get Us" 2.0. It's okay.

**seanderlust** (4.5): the inventors of queerbaiting themselves!!! i'll be honest, their voices sound a little rough but i'm not too too mad at it

**apatel27** (4): It's giving nothing

**Awkward\_King** (4): the gayest act in the rate and also the most homophobic act in the rate

**happyletuce06** (4): i can't stand their vocals

**MrSwearword** (4): Lena Katina innocent, but jesus christ, those live vocals that night...iCannot.

**nootnoot781** (4): finding out they weren’t lesbian blew my mind???

**thisusernameisntlong** (4): the light show is so disturbing to watch lol

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the original queerbaiters

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.5): my brain can’t process this performance, the layers of proto-edgelord trolling these two did will never make sense to me. All The Things She Said is a banger tho

**noideawhatever** (2): they sound terrible here wow. i expected more from such an iconic band tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (2): just because it's supposed to be bad doesn't make it good

**veryanniev** (2): listen I’m Russian and I have a soft spot for several t.A.t.U. songs but the live performance is so fucking bad lmao, how they came third I’ll never understand. I do give them props for singing in Russian though

**awkward\_penguin** (1.4): Look, I get that the group is famous and controversial. But if you just look at this performance without any other context, they did NOT sing well.

**akanewasright** (1): oh my

**BebeLuigi** (1): I hate this....

**fadedblue09** (1): this barely counts as singing

**frogaranaman** (1): booooooo

**LunaMoonMeUp** (1): Is the song a bop? I can't tell, I'm too distracted by how absolutely horrific this performance is. Like nails on a chalkboard.

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): girl what is this singing omfg it’s awful

**TiltControls** (1): this just does not sound good

**afs** (0): I'm getting flashbacks of the sixth grade trio that covered closer by Chainsmokers by screaming the entire song while standing at one spot it was so camp but so bad

**babadork** (0): No one that watched this performance should be surprised they hate each other now.

**indie\_fan\_** (0): НЕТ НЕТ НЕТ НЕТ НЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕЕТ

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Ok so like...this song isn't good, and I fully acknowledge that it sucks, but also...I kinda like it regardless?? It's easily one of the most dated songs in the rates with its dubstep drop, but I love how it goes from a nice sounding, if not somewhat generic, ballad into an EDM track. I didn't expect bottom 5 on this one, and I DEFINETELY didn't expect this to be the only song in the rate that didn't get a single 10 though.

**racloves** (1): if it means I don’t have to listen to this song, I will gladly be alone

---
# You're not alone
**ashandimlotion** (9): extremely dated but also still goes off

**berober04** (9): literally 2 minutes for the drop, but it's so goood

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Ballads by men CAN be good!

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): I wish this was good live. This song is so unique, I’ve not heard many things like it (I’m probably building it up in my head but still), the structure is so interesting. A sad end to a great song 😥

**moonagenightmares** (8.8): the second half slays so fucking much

**afs** (8): ripping off a yt comment! his vocals at the start - Nah :( his vocals at the end - Yeh :)

**awkward\_penguin** (8): I was a bit bored until the dubstep beats came in. And then WOW. It suddenly became the one of the coolest song I've heard in this contest. Plus, I love the grit in Aram MP3's vocals.

**iniekcja\_** (8): I really adored the stage that year

**nt96** (8): well ok then

**speaknowred** (8): I did not remember it but it is good

**seanderlust** (7.6): okay that build made some POINTS. i'm going to forgive the dubstep drop because it does build kind of nicely

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): This was great. Should safely make Day 2... right?

**guy\_like\_u** (7.5): I remember this being the hot favourite to win up until he made some unfortunate remarks. You can see the nerves in the beginning which is a shame because It has a wonderful build and

**s2pd** (7.5): Not the strongest singer

**CarlieScion** (7): why is Eminem - I’m not afraid in this rate

**criestotheclicking** (7): one of the only songs ever where a random dubstep appearance feels earned - I really enjoyed that build-up.

**happyletuce06** (7): an unexpected but welcomed dubstep

**skargardin** (7): the vocals really carried this and then some

**Stryxen** (7): he put EVERYTHING into performing this slightly underwhelming song and i have a crush on him for that

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): ok… the dubstep drop has really not aged well unfortunately

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.3): i have balladphobia for the first half of the song i'm sorry

# You're ~~not~~ alone

**emmaelf** (6): pretty good once it kicks in but the build-up just went on too long and with not enough interest for my liking.

**hannahspants** (6): I actually don't know how I feel about this. On the one hand I like it but on the other hand I don't. Weird.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): wait i was laughing at the first 2 minutes but he kinda served after that

**MrSwearword** (6): I get what this is going for but once the stage lights up, the vocals went out the door.

**thedoublebanana** (5.5): This is such a let down. When it was first released, I was a fan, but over time I got tired of it and Aram MP3 really doesn't do any favors in trying to sell the song.

**BebeLuigi** (5): I don't know it's just very there but not in a bad way

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this is somehow Les Miserables Imagine Dragons dubstep

**frogaranaman** (5): I would rather be alone

**ImADudeDuh** (5): oh take me back to 2012

**LunaMoonMeUp** (5): I love the raspiness of his voice, and the instrumental does a lot to make it stand out. But still..... ehh.

**Martin1009** (5): production better than i remembered, still kinda boring

**plastichaxan** (5): the instrumental is literally hyperpop which is a 10 but this guy’s voice is a 0 so i guess

**welcome2thejam** (5): Almost grabbed me! Meh start, got promising with the drums, built fantastically with all the intensity of a blizzard, and then lost me with the wild dubstep climax even if I honestly do admire it for the audacity

**Kaylaboe** (4.5): this being the big fave pre-contest is incredibly funny in retrospect

**akanewasright** (4): splashy, dramatic, but melodically kinda bleh

**CrimsonROSET** (4): this reminds me of that one smosh (?) video where they’re like ‘let me dubstep your ass’ and they think they look super cool doing it to impress this girl

**ignitethephoenix** (4): did this go from ballad to dubstep???

**Smuckles** (4): Distinctly 2014

**vayyiqra** (4): This guy is kind of oversinging but the instrumental is good I guess.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): When the EDM part came on I literally recoiled away from my computer

**ZebraSun73** (4): Time for Aram to enter his jpeg era

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I actually like the arrangements but the vocalist sounds bland

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3.5): not the Imagine Dragons energy…

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): i mean at least something happened towards the end? it wasn't a good thing but at least it meant that not the whole song was ridiculously boring

**apatel27** (3): At least time the drop so it's not in the middle of a lyric

**daretheghost** (3): Armenia has so many good songs they’ve sent to the contest. This is not one of them.

**nootnoot781** (3): when he was the favourite to win only to say some homophobic bullshit and lose to a drag queen >>> rip bozo 🤣

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): what was that drop lol

**throwaway-7650** (1.5): the vocals, um... also WE HATE YOU HITORIJANAI

**2dina3dworld** (1): I think he’s telling me that I’m not alone

**celladonn** (1): the dubstep... this has aged comically bad

**flavasavavandal** (1): as a ballad it sucks because I don’t like his voice with an incredibly weak build-up to whatever the fuck the seond half was

**noideawhatever** (0): dear god this is BORING and the brostep drop doesn't do it any favors. a real product of its time. awful.

**racloves** (7): Obligatory Billie Eilish comparison

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): billie eilish who??

---

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): In the running to be my favorite Eurovision song tbh.

**Martin1009** (10): Everything I do, is for HER

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): should’ve also won 😤, Bulgaria deserves better 👏👏

**plastichaxan** (10): two of the bonus rates being better than most of the rate ouu

**happyletuce06** (9): robbed of her win

**nt96** (8.5): does it sound a lot like a Billie Eillish song? Yes. Is this song good? Also yes. Piss Off.

**nootnoot781** (8): i love billie eilish from wi- bulgaria

**s2pd** (8): Beautiful vocal melody accompanied by a lovely arrangement

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this could end up high with the correct staging but eh

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): much prefer her 2021 song but this would've undoubtedly done better at the contest

**moonagenightmares** (7.2): billie eyelash?

**akanewasright** (7): This isn’t bad it’s just… distractingly Billie Eil-ish. The modulation raised this by a point

**ashandimlotion** (7): literally sooo extremely similar to her 2021 song

**criestotheclicking** (7): unfortunately neither of Victoria's songs do much for me. This is very well produced and written, though - I’ll say that.

**DefaultPophead** (7): This is great, but her 2021 song was way better in my opinion!

**LunaMoonMeUp** (6): Very trendy and modern song, but I'm just left whelmed by it. Far better than her 2021 entry I think though.

**Stryxen** (5.5): a comment about billie eilish

**ZebraSun73** (5): See if I want to listen to Billie Eilish, I'll just listen to Billie Eilish

**daretheghost** (4): Snoozer.

**hannahspants** (2): YAWNNNNN

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): This is the least original song in this whole rate sorry. At least the other boring songs are boring in a European way

**thedoctordances1940** (1.7): there is just absolutely nothing noteworthy about this whatsoever

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): maybe Billie Eilish getting popular was a bad idea

**RandomHypnotica** (1): this is an embarassingly transparent attempt at writing a billie song, but the lyricism just feels so awkward and clunky to me

**skargardin** (1): I did not get the hype at ALL sorry besties

**thedoublebanana** (1): I never understood the hype behind her. She feels very forced into being a favorite when her songs really haven't got me even thinking about them as I'm listening.

**throwaway-7650** (1): girl america's got talent is across the ocean

# Everybody
**DevilsOfLoudun** (10): I'm from Estonia so of course it's a ten. I was around 9 years old at the time and I remember going to bed early thinking we didn't stand a chance only to wake up the next morning to my mom telling me we won. I thought she was joking at first.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Wait oh my god this is so much fun, it’s like the end of a feel-good comedy. Everything is gonna be okay now.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait why is this so fun

**jaztinax** (9): what a feel-good song

**Smuckles** (9): Powerful. Not enough singing combo's take turns being the hype man for each other.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Surprised to learn that the big song/dance number randomly plopped at the end of animated adventure buddy comedies won Eurovision

**babadork** (8.3): They couldn’t have taught blue shirt guy more than one dance move?

**nootnoot781** (8): yo estonia, i’m really happy for you, i’ll let you finish, but greece has one of the best eurovision songs of all time. one of the best entries of all time! this is still really good though!!

**veryanniev** (8): this slaps and I love that this is Estonia of all countries lol

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.7): honestly fun

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): why is this so fun 😭😭😭

**DefaultPophead** (7.6): This is what I think of when I think of Estonia.

**speaknowred** (7.5): Greece robbed a bit

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): it's giving LazyTown Live!

**TiltControls** (7.5): only 2 songs in and I'm already having to break out the 'it's camp' comment

**afs** (7): there's a comment saying they're like old cop buddies and boy that seemed to age as badly as this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): I was gonna slander these two karaoke uncles but the chorus would go crazy at a Jenny Craig Fitness in 1997 honestly!

**s2pd** (7): Fun feel good song

**seanderlust** (7): I don't have a funny comment for this other than the white guy from these two looks like pandora boxx out of drag

**Stryxen** (7): red dress woman kicking dance emoji

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): this is more like it

**vayyiqra** (7): lol so cheesy but it's fun

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Disney Sing Along Songs-core

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Fun but they sound drunk in the performance

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): drunk after work karaoke vibes

**indie\_fan\_** (6.3): Watching the performance, I can't stop looking at the white guys knees and I don't mean that in a good way.

# Nobody
**ashandimlotion** (6): this has some of the least winner energy of any ESC winner

**Awkward\_King** (6): why is he doing that

**criestotheclicking** (6): this is fun if not a bit dated. I hate that the first song this reminds me of is the Peter Kay version of Amarillo.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6): a bit fun actually but not fun enough for me to give a higher score

**musical\_pyn** (6): I love the theory of this song so much more than I like the execution

**RandomHypnotica** (5.8): standard early 00s radio filler type beat

**Kaylaboe** (5.5): why did this win exactly. greece deserved

**DirtyRat583** (5.4): if theyre happy im happy

**apatel27** (5): Drunk uncle at karaoke vibes

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i

**emmaelf** (5): neither slow or fast and i just don't get anything from it.

**frogaranaman** (5): this is a song?????

**hannahspants** (5): terrible but I can't bring myself to give it a lower score cause they just seem so happy

**ignitethephoenix** (5): should have ended racism

**nt96** (5): I honestly don’t know what to say about this

**shhhneak** (5): This sounds like it would’ve randomly been on the Lizzie McGuire soundtrack.

**skargardin** (5): camp i fear

**happyletuce06** (4.5): mid

**celladonn** (4): This is just soooo forgettable

**sirpancakeXI** (4): easily my least favorite winner

**thedoublebanana** (4): Choices were made that year.

**ZebraSun73** (4): Was Europe OK in 2001

**akanewasright** (3): Well they’re having fun ig

**BebeLuigi** (3): A pretty disappointing winner to an overally disappointing year.

**moonagenightmares** (3): the blonde dude looked like he really needed to pee

**awkward\_penguin** (2.7): I take back what I said about Fly on the Wings of Love - THIS is pure early 2000s in its staging. The loose untucked shirts, spiked hair, Backstreet Backup Dancers.

**guy\_like\_u** (2): I have no memory of this song and I’ve seen every Eurovision

**LunaMoonMeUp** (2): For a song about partying and having fun, it feels like they could be a lot more energetic.

**Martin1009** (2): No comment lmao

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (2): this is the worst winner ever. How?!?!?

**daretheghost** (1): I am upset that I’m saving my 0 for something else because… this is certainly a contender.

**MrSwearword** (1): What the fuck is this trash

**Uberpigeon** (1): sub 3 ballot incoming if theyre all like this

**iniekcja\_** (0): gayest straights

**racloves** (7): I can’t totally make sense of what’s happening, but I love it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): If you're thinking to yourself "Wow, this song is really not good! How the hell did it come second place in 2013?", well, don't worry, because you're not the only one. It's more or less an open secret in Eurovision history that Azerbaijan bought themselves a second place this year, judging by the fact that 2013 remains the *only* year where the EBU has never fully disclosed the full amount of points each country gave out, instead only showing a weird "average" placement system that doesn't tell us anything. But enough shitting on Azerbaijan's shady tactics for now, how does the song actually stand up when you put that controversy aside...well, not that well honestly. Although I will admit the staging is clever and unique with its man in the box choreo, the song itself isn't strong enough and doesn't stand out when listening to other songs in this rate, let alone other songs that competed that year.

# I'll never let go
**GapeCod** (10): THIIIIIS is what we're referring to when we're saying that certain midtempo kpop songs are "very eurovision".

**Stryxen** (10): joined the pubby listening party to the last minute of this, the rest could suck but it ends as a 10 for all i know

**afs** (9): BOXMAN WAS SO GOOD I wish the comments were open

**CrimsonROSET** (8): fold me, marie kondo me

**musical\_pyn** (8): this performance is the 11 in performances

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): this is simultaneously so cheesy and catchy. Peak Eurovision, he put his bussy into it. A glass cuboid of rose petals. Staging directors wish they could reach this level

**skargardin** (8): god this dramatic ass performance

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): basic ballad but he served vocals

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): i still think this staging is cool as fuck

**seanderlust** (7.4): okay the glass box mirror choreo is a major slay

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.3): the reflection bit is cool

**babadork** (7.2): Why does plastic cage him not look anything like the singer?

**thedoublebanana** (7.2): A good song, not a great singer.

**criestotheclicking** (7): a key-change downwards (?) for once was interested

**daretheghost** (7): For a lot of these I’ve been listening to the ESC performance in lieu of the studio recording unless the performance is disastrous but I think the live version is an improvement; the vocals are more… cushioned? Which is of course an Azerbaijan Staple, for better or worse.

**emmaelf** (7): the boyband moodiness on top of a man in a box, i'm howling!

**RandomHypnotica** (7): box dude literally ate all the food and left no scraps for the other two

**TiltControls** (7): what is it about eurovision performances and putting people into glass boxes

**awkward\_penguin** (6.8): Solid vocals and decent staging, though the song is a bit cheesy.

**ashandimlotion** (6.5): the last year Azerbaijan was allowed to cheat </3.. especially sad because their song in 2014 was actually excellent....

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): why does this single art for this make him look like a trainer on The Biggest Loser

**DefaultPophead** (6.3): Why are the comments blocked on the video?

**plastichaxan** (6): give me love make me hole

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A basic ballad

**cremeebrulee** (5): the points are all for that guy in the box

**frogaranaman** (5): this is fine? it sounds like someone was writing a song for the first time in their life

**guy\_like\_u** (5): iconic and memeable staging but the song is an afterthought

**happyletuce06** (5): just inoffensive

**MrSwearword** (5): too generic/middling for derision

**Uberpigeon** (5): indigo de souza majorly outsold

**welcome2thejam** (5): Song's alright, I consider it more of a backing track to whatever's happening to that dude in the box

**akanewasright** (4): …this wasn’t good but what the fuck was this performance

**BebeLuigi** (4): It gets a few points for the staging but god I hate the song

**flavasavavandal** (4): a boyband powerballad without the the band and the cheese

**LunaMoonMeUp** (4): Some unique and memorable staging, plus a good singer, doesn't really save the song from being so boring. Another one I'm shocked did so well.

**noideawhatever** (4): this song already sounded dated in 2013, and it still sounds dated.

**vayyiqra** (4): Sorry Farid but no more power ballads I beg.

**ZebraSun73** (4): Azerbaijan send something else other than a boring ballad challenge

**throwaway-7650** (3.5): I want a fancam of the guy in the glass box

**CarlieScion** (3): pleasssssssssssssse

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): well this happened

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Unfortunately I'm not surprised this song is out so early, but man I can't help but love this one. It reminds me so much of 70's classic rock that I grew up listening to and the lyrics are so nice and pleasant to sing along to. Popheads' hatred of white men with acoustic guitars couldn't save this one though, and it was predictably bottom 5 for most the whole rate, and only narrowly averts that fate.

---
# Flying
**Imtotallyfine.jpg** (11): I’m sorry but I’m legally required as a Dane to give my 11 to the national treasures of Denmark Brødrene Olsen <3 Also I really like the song.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I suspect that this song won’t do very well but I really love it. It reminds me of like, a Disney movie opening credits song, and it’s very nostalgic and comforting because of that

**akanewasright** (9): I NEED MORE SWEET OLD MAN AUTOTUNE

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): this would go off at some Arts and Crafts street festival full of NPR moms don’t lie to yourself

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): a classic.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Just the right amount of ‘00s cheesiness for me, a person who’s seen an embarrassing number of direct to video Barbie films.

**seanderlust** (9): i am going to give this a high compliment in that it reminds me of the Tarzan soundtrack

**afs** (8): debimboified Farrah Abraham

**CaptainDaisyG** (8): Very endearing!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this sounds like a cute song by 2 high schoolers but then I look at the album art and they are able to get the seniors discount

**moooo566** (8): this is one of those songs which is just good enough that i forget it's even a eurovision one

**s2pd** (8): Eurovision classic!

**speaknowred** (8): Solid win

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.2): kinda country but kinda groovy

**thedoublebanana** (7.2): It's not a stand out winner, but it is one of the better winners.

**celladonn** (7): this is cheesy but it bops a little bit

**criestotheclicking** (7): this is super underrated. That random penultimate-chorus autotune (before a key change, no less!) was both very of its time and unexpected.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this sounds like a Disney song

**DefaultPophead** (7): Could imagine this on the Tarzan soundtrack. Can already see Tarzan and Jane swinging through the vines while Clayton's body rots underneath them. Love to see it.

**emmaelf** (7): oh god were they pan flutes? anyway, that chorus was more of a bop than a semi-acoustic love song with bad rhymes deserves.

**jaztinax** (7): this is catchy and cute tbh

**Martin1009** (7): The chorus goes HARD

**musical\_pyn** (7): I can't believe how 2000s this is (+points for unexpected vocoder)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): dad rockers made some points

**Smuckles** (7): You can see that key change coming a mile off but it still hits!

**welcome2thejam** (7): Decent soft adult contemporary, and I'll give those old dudes credit for being infectious

# Walking

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I prefer the Brothers Osborne

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): the random-ass autotune really saved this one from being absolute nothingness… how did this WIN???

**berober04** (6): I think literally 3 of these points are because of the remix

**CarlieScion** (6): I had only ever heard the chorus of this before and that goes awf but the verses are so boring

**cremeebrulee** (6): nothing will get on my nerves faster than a key change in the last chorus my god

**Kaylaboe** (6): why did this win exactly. russia deserved

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): I feel like my nan would really like this which means it probably shouldn't have been an entry for Eurovision

**throwaway-7650** (6): it's giving partner in crime @2:20

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Cheesy, weird voices, autotune? Eugh

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): it was such a different time...

**frogaranaman** (5): feel like I'm in an Aldi's

**happyletuce06** (5): mid

**iniekcja\_** (5): the most interesting thing about this is the backup singers' choreography

**Melody** (5): this is a cute song to start the decade - I guess.

**nt96** (5): This feels like it belongs on some animated film soundtrack

**Stryxen** (5): yass come through neutral milk hotel

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): this sounds like a second rate anime OP

**indie\_fan\_** (4.3): This is giving Campfire Song vibes and I don't know whether I like that or hate it. Also, their voices are not my cup of tea. And that sudden autotune is a big NO from me. But it's still listenable, so I guess I won't give it that low a score.

**apatel27** (4): Using a vocoder doesn't change how basic this is

**daretheghost** (4): Blech.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (4): A bit dated, and a bit too nasal for my tastes.

**MrSwearword** (4): Corny but not as repugnant as the score suggests

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (4): it’s just boring

**thedoctordances1940** (3.6): One of my winning songs ever <3

**thisusernameisntlong** (3.5): not a good start

**TiltControls** (3.5): The opening drums got me excited cause I thought I was going to be listening to The All American Reject's smash hit Move Along

**GapeCod** (3): Stream SISTER by Angel OLSEN!!! (also 2000 isn't part of the 21st century).

**hannahspants** (3): yawn

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): the intro with the traditional music made me excited for a much better song than what i actually ended up hearing

**noideawhatever** (3): we're off to a bad start. wtf is that autotune, reminds me of some nights by fun. and not in a good way

**vayyiqra** (3): Starting this rate with no idea of what to expext and yeah this is not good! It's giving "90s movie original soundtrack song" (not a compliment).

**shhhneak** (2.5): Michael Bolton in the American Song Contest:

**awkward\_penguin** (2.2): Sounds like something a middle-aged married white couple would slow dance to. Staging is VERY cheesy and early 2000s. The vocoder was cool though!

**Awkward\_King** (2): if i wanted to see 2 old men sing badly id have voted for dude's country rate (note: i dont even know if dude has a country rate)

**BebeLuigi** (2): I actually don't like a lot of winners in Eurovision especially in the 2000s and this song is just so whatever to me. We wanted Alsou to win!!!!

**fadedblue09** (2): Off to a low start

**guy\_like\_u** (2): a simpler time

**skargardin** (2): I hate to say this but this might be one of my least favourite winners ever, I'm just.. insanely bored

**Uberpigeon** (2): horrible nasal singing and corny lyrics. i hate it!

**itsabop** (1): Doesn't do it for me gorl

**moonagenightmares** (1): when i heard the opening i thought this was going to be another song. unfortunately it was not

**plastichaxan** (1): this being the first song was such a jumpscare when i queued the rate i thought i had queued some random straight song

**racloves** (5): I’m bored sorry

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): Amar Pelos Dois is a...very controversial song among Eurovision fans. Aside from the fact that song itself is considered by some to be very boring and underserving of its record breaking winner placement, Salvador Sobral himself is almost universally hated by fans due to his extremely negative opinions on the contest and his winning speech, where he compared other entries in the show as "fast food" music and that his song, in comparison, actually had meaning. Not exactly a smart move to make when you're on a contest where being outrageous is part of the whole appeal! This was, somewhat expectedly, bottom 2 for most of the rate, but managed to move slightly up the rankings near the end when more Salvador apologists turned in.

---
# Music is feeling
**DefaultPophead** (11): I can, from the bottom of my heart, say that this song changed my life. I remember the first, second, and third time I heard it. The time I woke up to watch Eurovision. The replay at night time on SBS. The midnight toilet cry with my headphones in. This song got me into Portuguese music and made me realise it was the most beautiful language in the world, gives me hours long goosebumps, transports me to another dimension, and changed how I viewed love. Stuff y'all, I love this.

**hannahspants** (11): my favourite winner of all of them. This is a beautiful song and performance that got overshadowed by the fact that the singer was a douche. Try as I might, I cannot get his dumb comments after winning to make me hate this song.

**bigbigbee** (10): I know this guy sucks but this song is SO delicate and lovely. I love that it’s not in English, I love how classic it sounds, I love the strings. Ratatouille soundtrack moment

**emmaelf** (10): pretty, wholesome and relaxing. it feels like it's taken the best parts of midcentury music and ran with it. it could be on an audrey hepburn soundtrack and would feel completely of the time.

**Kaylaboe** (10): some of the most magical 3 minutes on a stage ever. always feel transported to another dimension when this plays

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): Salvador gets a lot of flack for his controversial Eurovision opinions, but truly nobody else has the ability to captivate so many with so little like he can. A masterful performer.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is just so genuinely sweet

**noideawhatever** (10): understanding portuguese allows me to fully appreciate this song, and damn is it beautiful. my little romantic heart is breaking right now as i write this

**nt96** (10): its giving romcom vibes. Like my spouse and I are just frolicking around by the riverfront on sunset.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): does this song deserve the most points in Eurovision history? maybe not. But does it slap? definitely

**veryanniev** (10): he has been really insufferable and snobbish and acted really unprofessionally when it comes to Eurovision, but I just can’t deny that I love this song with all my heart

**speaknowred** (9.7): So beautiful

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): predicting this will do badly bc ballads bad and Salvador being a music snob in his winners speech but sorry this is a really beautiful song and performance

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): damn this song was so pretty why'd he have to go and be a cunt

**ashandimlotion** (9): the eurofans will never forgive him for insulting the trashy nature of the contest but I think life handed him the ultimate revenge when he had to hand the win over to Netta of all people.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): :(

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is really pretty, feels out of place in a weird sort of way (it’s a lot… classier? more elegant? than a lot of the songs) but the change of pace is nice.

**awkward\_penguin** (8.8): It is a beautiful song, and Salvador sings it so expressively. It's just a bit too sentimental for my taste, but it deserved to win.

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is such a unique song against all the recent winners, i never understood the hate, because i've thought even if it's not your taste, it's still a beautiful song

**happyletuce06** (8): comforting and depressing at the same time

**iniekcja\_** (8): i understand why this won

**jaztinax** (8): i didn’t care for it when it won but the song won me over like… a week later

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): this also helped improving the contests image. People went from: ‘Eurovision is just generic pop songs’ to ‘Eurovision is just generic pop songs and ballads’. Which is a step in the right direction if you ask me 🤷‍♂️

**seanderlust** (8): these lyrics and this backing instrumentation I am crying in the (wherever ESC is held note to self google this later) right now!!!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Odd charisma that's working for me. Nice call on the intimate setup

**ZebraSun73** (8): Definitely the right song to win in 2017 but not one I go back to a great deal

**apatel27** (7.5): It's a neat little track but dude is acting like a creep

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): i was planning on tanking this because i did not care for this song at all in 2017 but actually it’s pretty good

**s2pd** (7.5): Lovely song, beautiful voice

**afs** (7): waiter there's a fly in my soup

**criestotheclicking** (7): I feel like the Amar Pelos Dois discourse has become so cyclical and circular that it is both underrated and overrated at once. Shrodinger’s Salvador if you will. Also shout out to the Kyiv stage - really cool to have him in the middle of the crowd.

**fadedblue09** (7): The non-English ballads are honestly the best on this list

**nootnoot781** (7): FUCK PORTUGAL!!!!! but yeah the song’s cute idk

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.5): the strings are pretty

**astrologicalangel** (6): I can't tell if I actually kinda like this or if I'm a sucker for violin

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Hmmmmmm well it’s not terrible

# Music is fireworks

**shhhneak** (5.6): He looks like my ex.

**guy\_like\_u** (5.5): this one stood out BECAUSE it didn’t try to compete with crazy staging. I can’t say I want to go back and rewatch or delisted to this but it’s a interesting winner

**akanewasright** (5): This is fine but like… I could find 5 guys like this in an average conservatory, you and your “real music” aren’t special

**daretheghost** (5): Salvador is so incredibly annoying that I’m docking this points but I will say those times he had his sister sing for/with him were great and honestly I prefer her take on the song.

**Smuckles** (5): This sounds like Paul McCartney's granny shit

**whatyourheartdesires** (5): I respect it, it’s kinda pretty but gives me zero energy and suddenly I feel like I’m 80 years old.

**TiltControls** (4): it's fine

**vayyiqra** (4): Sorry the tradpop ballad sound (easy listening?) is a neat concept but I don't care for this.

**Martin1009** (3): Tbh I hate the song's fans more than the song

**thedoctordances1940** (2.7): yeah i just wanna punch this guy

**ignitethephoenix** (2.5): literally am lying in bed and getting sleepy again, also how did this win???

**thisusernameisntlong** (2.5): at points the crowd was clapping and cheering and I have no clue why

**ImADudeDuh** (2): sorry [name redacted] but this is boring

**throwaway-7650** (2): muted af but still obnoxious... talent tbh

**Uberpigeon** (2): whys he acting like the weird guy from death note

**BebeLuigi** (1): This was one of my contender for my zero... this just bores me so much

**CarlieScion** (1): GOD THE PRETENTIOUSNESS OF THIS WINNING AND HIM AND ALSO THE FANS. I have literally never been angrier on Eurovision night ksnfjkdqsjsdf

**frogaranaman** (1): Up (2009, dir. Pete Docter) ass song

**MrSwearword** (1): on principal of the song being woefully boring and that jaded trashbag hating anything pop and being all "real music is better.

**plastichaxan** (1): this is so boring and the story behind it i hope that guy is having a bad day

**Stryxen** (1): yawn! boring winner and definitely a boring person to win eurovision and then insult it immediately after :rolling_eyes:

**thedoublebanana** (1): I have a lot of opinions of this and I don't really feel like ranting, but this is not a great song.

TakeOnMeByA-ha: # Y'all really hated this one huh!
**berober04** (0): I'm sorry, I'm sure it's sweet, but I just cannot stand this song.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): If this is the pretentious schmuck that said he had a “real song” of whatever, fuck that! Not with this hackneyed Kerrigan and Lowdermilk Feinstein’s/54 Below-ass leftover! I’m here for camp, sir, stop ruining that with your smug self! Now, don’t be fooled to think I only dislike this song for the real song drama. I’m a dyed in the wool former (and forever) insufferable theater kid; and to me this performance just feels a bit too put-on and affected for me to be emotionally connected to it. The affected emotion here just irks me and I don’t care for the performance itself.

**DirtyRat583** (0): you thought you ate 😹😹😹😹

**GapeCod** (0): ☠ Heroes probably deserves the 0 more, but oh my god... that real music discourse was awful and completely uncalled for.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (0): I’m sorry it’s just so, so boring

**moonagenightmares** (0): i initially gave this a 1 and my only comment for it was “boring” because it was so forgettable, then i remembered it won… worst eurovision win in recent memory and it gets a 0 for that. also FUCK YOU salvador!

**moooo566** (0): there is literally nothing appealing to me about this song. do i need to speak portuguese? "what if we do some classic crooning but make the instrumental dull as shit and find the whiniest voiced man in the country?" it would maaaaybe be acceptable as background noise in a cafe, but at eurovision? fuck off

# lying
**1998tweety** (10): the things i would let this man do to me....

**babadork** (10): Someone needs to send this performance to Charlie Puth.

**cremeebrulee** (10): now how did they gentrified talk dirty

**GapeCod** (10): 👁👄👁

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): this is the only Eurovision song I've ever obsessively listened to enough to make my year end playlist on spotify and it's still a huge bop. Love the horns and completely nonsensical lyrics like no idea what's going on but I'm enjoying it anyway!

**skargardin** (10): this massive bop

**thedoublebanana** (9.7): Live was a bit of a let down because of his injury, but still a great song and a fun bot.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): this performance was a BLAST

**akanewasright** (9): this is just talk dirty without the weird racism… maybe I like talk dirty without the weird racism

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): A nice change of pace

**TiltControls** (8.5): there's camp and then there's this. this is a derogatory 8.5

**DefaultPophead** (8.3): Mixed Feelings: Czech Republic Edition

**Martin1009** (8.3): Your spagetti, is for me?

**Awkward\_King** (8): i followed him on instagram bc of how hot i thought he was and i still follow him and he's not even that hot but after following him for so long i just care about him tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is talk dirty to me which means I have no need for it because I have talk dirty to me but I still like it

**daretheghost** (8): Has no right to be so good.

**happyletuce06** (8): we will never have someone like him again

**Melody** (8): finally the booty bangers are back

**moonagenightmares** (8): cant believe i forgot this bop

**speaknowred** (8): Fun

**vayyiqra** (8): Choosing to not perceive these highly questionable lyrics because this is such a bop. (Camels? Spaghetti? I don't want to know what he means by that.) Don't get me wrong, the lyrics to this really suck. It's just that it's a lot fun when you ignore them! If you can, that is. Song is an 8, lyrics are a 0. Logically I should give it a 4 then but whatever. I'm not changing anything in my ballot, it's hot takes only this time.

**veryanniev** (8): his face at the end always takes me out lmao

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I like Talk Dirty To Me by Jason Derulo AND Don’t by Ed Sheeran. I like a song that sounds like they collided in midair

**berober04** (7): fucking backpack kid

**guy\_like\_u** (7): this has aged poorly :(

**Kaylaboe** (7): he can lie to me any day

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): Czechia's best ever entry at Eurovision, even Mikolas' massive radiating fuckboy energy doesn't take away from that.

**No-Place-to-Go** (7): The song was fun, he was terrible.

**nt96** (7): Mikolas: can I copy your homework? Derulo: sure, just don't make it too obvious. Mikolas: ok

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): yeah white boy do your fortnite dances!

**sirpancakeXI** (7): it is very cheesy but i dont really hate it.

**iniekcja\_** (6.5): not the fuckboy

**s2pd** (6.5): I'm not the biggest fan of rap

**afs** (6): this could make dentists anti-flossing

**ashandimlotion** (6): someone needs to explain to me why this is beloved by eurofans but certified massive bop dance you off is hated

**BebeLuigi** (6): I don't like to say this usually but this song aged very quickly dsfsdfqfd I love it a lot in 2018 but now I can barely get to the end haha

**LesApfels** (6): This comes off like a b-tier Phineas and Ferb song

**noideawhatever** (6): the song is nice and fun but i hate how loud that triangle (?) is in the mix

**Stryxen** (6): yes i hate this song yes i love this song idk

**welcome2thejam** (6): Anything I ranked below this should honestly be just a little bit ashamed of themselves

#the truth

**plastichaxan** (5.5): oh my god this rate has the best music i’ve ever heard i had to watch all of the performances to enjoy it more

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.5): this is basically a Jason Derulo song

**frogaranaman** (5): "we have Jason Derulo's Trumpets at home" / the Jason Derulo's Trumpets at home:

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (5): this doesn’t appeal to me. The staging was cool though

**whatyourheartdesires** (5): it reminds me of Jason Derulo

**ZebraSun73** (5): Low effort funk me up, low effort funk me up

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): 🍅

**seanderlust** (3): apparently making a puddle doesn't refer to male ejaculate but to peeing yourself which i'm not entirely sure which one is worse

**shhhneak** (2.7): This is just annoying and not in a fun Hoenn trumpets way.

**celladonn** (2): This corny fucking song... I can't decide if this sounds more like a Jason Derulo song or a Liam Payne song but either way it doesn't sound good

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): 2018 was a bad year for eurovision huh

**thedoctordances1940** (1.2): from the fortnite dance to the 5 year outdated horn part (which sucked even when it was trendy) this is genuinely just abysmal

**2dina3dworld** (1): this sounds like a second rate Badkiz song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): If he was British this song would be on their charts for like 20 weeks and he’d have a presenter gig by now

**flavasavavandal** (1): and people say Jason Derulo wasn’t influential

**hannahspants** (1): I don't know why I hate this song. Might be the backpack. Might be the annoying trumpet. Might be the annoying dancing. Idk. Hate it

**MrSwearword** (1): get this glorified TikTok before TikTok the motherfuck away from me.

**Uberpigeon** (1): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qO4u-mmZBVQ

**apatel27** (0): Poundland Olly Murs singing a Jason Derulo song while flossing

**criestotheclicking** (0): god I hate this one. Even in 2018 it was dated and cringe.

**emmaelf** (0): oh flossing. white men half rapping is a decision. my least favourite choice for minimalist backing music is people making breath sounds and the tinny sounding sax is just very of its time. soulless and irritable.

**musical\_pyn** (0): this man has negative charisma

**Saison\_Marguerite** (0): he really said what if I remade Talk Dirty with a limp instrumental and even worse lyrics

**Smuckles** (0): The fuck is this Robin Thicke shit. You get a 0 for daring to remind me of that guy

**throwaway-7650** (0): never let this guy on stage ever again. I'm so /srs

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): Shittily rapping about spaghetti does not make you the next Eminem

**bigbigbee** (8): If you asked an AI to generate the average Eurovision song, it would sound like this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I’m just kind of bopping!

**iniekcja\_** (8): the pants in their NF would've had them disqualified on the spot on drag race

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): I hide the fact that I love this song from everyone I know, my guilty pleasure. Makes me shake my bussy

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Boppy. I think this one’s my favorite of the 2020 ones

**Stryxen** (7.8): this sounds like a blackpink song. EEK!

**DefaultPophead** (7.3): Ava Max could never...

**akanewasright** (6): serving kill this love

**happyletuce06** (6): loco loco outsold

**thedoublebanana** (6): Another one where I liked the 2020 songs better than the 2021 song. Sanja really is one of the best vocalists we got in the past 10 years.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Fun, but nothing really to set it apart from a bunch of other songs like this

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): pretty much the same song as Loca

**veryanniev** (5.5): Loco Loco was one of my most played songs in 2021 and it’s so much better than this one

**seanderlust** (5.2): girlbossery knows no language

**criestotheclicking** (5): Loco Loco is better, but I suppose what this has on that song is gun noises.

**jaztinax** (5): if i wanted to listen to a song called hasta la vista, i’d listen to the one from camp rock

**Kaylaboe** (5): loco loco better

**s2pd** (5): Sanjaa can do much better

**Martin1009** (4.5): Stephanie's Child look different?

**daretheghost** (4): A song.

**hannahspants** (4): yass girl slay

**LunaMoonMeUp** (4): There's nothing I outright dislike about this song... but I strugle to think of anything I do actually like.

**shhhneak** (2): Literally the cast of Selling Sunset.

**racloves** (8): Discourse aside, it’s catchy and weird and Eurovision

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): reading the discourse this song generated in discord every day was honestly fucking exhausting and i dont wanna waste any more time thinking about this song than i already have

---
# i dont even have the energy to come up with funny comment headers
**2dina3dworld** (10): I am begrudgingly admitting that this is actually great in a post-good way… this is a call for help.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it’s the chicken lady

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): kinda shady to put this one directly after “Occidentali’s Karma” lol… anyways tacky live performance aside (I feel like if we really wanna start digging into the history of some of the artists on this playlist it would not be the most “problematic” thing we’d find) I really like this song. It’s different while also being good with catchy lyrics, very my aesthetic. Obviously I support Palestine though.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): This was the correct winner as far as I’m concerned.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): It's unique yet slaps, it's silly but with a great message, Netta performs the hell out of it live - it has everything I want from Eurovision.

**Stryxen** (10): why this was so hated i will never understand - campy slay and it’s just fun and deserved the win

**thedoublebanana** (10): The first time since I started following the contest (2004) that my favorite song won. I love the song but was kind of let down in the performance. Stil worthy of the 10 because it really is a BANGER.

**veryanniev** (10): this is such a widely hated song and for what? I still think this deserved a win because it’s unique and fun and Netta is charismatic af. I like Fuego too but it doesn’t stand out as much as Toy.

**babadork** (9.8): This would have been a competitor for my 11, if I wasn’t so confused by the combination of appropriation and the chicken dance.

**shhhneak** (9.6): Her jokerification moment.

**ashandimlotion** (9.5): knocking off a 0.5 because this really did win in spite of the rough performance

**ZebraSun73** (9.5): I just love how she sings 'I don't care for your stefa, baby". Idk why that's the line that sticks out to me amongst everything that goes on in this song, but it really has something.

**guy\_like\_u** (9): I know this gets a lot of shit for blocking Fuego but it’s still a great fun song in its own right and the performance really elevates it. I don’t hear 7 Nation Army though?

**noideawhatever** (9): fun fun fun

**nt96** (9): Korn found shaking in their boots

**Smuckles** (9): I remember people getting REAL mad at this song, just because it was a bit unconventional. This is miles more interesting than any of the other songs i've rated from 2016-ish onwards though, people are boring.

**Martin1009** (8.7): Outsold "pelican fly fly fly"

**afs** (8.5): okay I'm extremely conflicted because I'm from Pak, so Israel's actions definitely weigh heavy in my mind, but this is also a banger of a performance

**1998tweety** (8): idk if this is good or not but its boppy

**daretheghost** (8): The novelty wore off pretty darn quick but it’s still fun and inventive-and benefits from brownie points for the poetry of being handed the trophy by Salvador.

**DirtyRat583** (8): some questionable choices but it served, lets be honest

**fadedblue09** (8): Very fun, sounds like Bjork

**happyletuce06** (8): catchy and respectable, aged a bit

**iniekcja\_** (8): if you dislike this you clearly hate fun

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): not sure what this is but the beat drop slaps hard

**skargardin** (8): well

**speaknowred** (7.7): It is fun but the chicken sends me

**bigbigbee** (7.5): “you’re stupid just like your smart (ding!) phone” is one of the least sensical in a rate with a lot of those

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): this was a fun song but...

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): i’m sorry y’all but it’s a bop

**criestotheclicking** (7): I respect Netta for being able to incorporate vocalised chicken sounds into her song and somehow win. It’s fun.

**MrSwearword** (7): Let's be honest; it's a decent pop song we're glad won [even though Jessica Mauboy, Elina Nechayeva, Saara Aalto, Eleni Foureira and even Madame Monsieur's entries were right there] just because it pissed off last year's winner. Also, Jujubee and Mo Heart lipsyncing to this was a kii.

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): Chicken Attack outsold

**BebeLuigi** (6): I get why it won it's a cute song, I just think this was very messy lol why the kimono and the maneki neko ????

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i don’t hate this song but i do hate discourse

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): the chorus absolutely goes off but every other part of this song is either really boring or really annoying

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I think I see this the same way I see Dance Monkey, in that I find the end product very annoying but I also respect the work and commitment it takes to be that consistently annoying

**whatyourheartdesires** (6): too much chicken

**s2pd** (5.5): I don't dislike it as much as I used to

**Awkward\_King** (5): 10 for the racism 0 for the song. wait. other way round.

**moonagenightmares** (5): i have no idea how to rate this tbh. points for being camp? but the song without the performance feels extremely boring

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (5): this songs isn’t awful but wasn’t great. The results this year were so different to my rankings that I don’t know how to feel about the entire year. People should be nicer to Netta though

**sirpancakeXI** (5): it is kinda overhated like it is really not that bad

**welcome2thejam** (5): The level of obnoxiousness in this song is both its greatest asset and its worst enemy

**seanderlust** (4.6): THE CHICKEN NOISES FKLNSJDKFLS

**celladonn** (4): This is iconic but not in a good way

**ignitethephoenix** (4): how did this win Eurovision 💀 like the chicken clucking is camp but like this doesn’t have winner energy

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): Has the energy of a song Gwen Stefani would have dropped between Baby Don’t Lie and Spark the Fire (derogatory)

**TiltControls** (4): i still don't get what the chicken stuff has to do with anything

**nootnoot781** (3): oh so that's what happened to asiavision 😍

**thedoctordances1940** (2.4): just so fucking annoying and not in a fun camp eurovision way

**emmaelf** (2): i hated this on the night. absolutely despised it. the looping is clever but i still don't like it. the minimal backing isn't my style at all, the chinese staging feels random and while netta as a vocalist is excellent, i just can't find much love for this, it really grates on me.

**itsabop** (2): No-tta

**apatel27** (1): Ugly Culturally Appropriated Outfit, Bad Stage Design, Meghan Trainor Lyrics, Chicken Sounds. Can't work out what's the worst part

**CarlieScion** (1): fuck this song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): well

**frogaranaman** (1): I'M DOING THE TIKTOK RATE????

**hannahspants** (1): if I didn't hate Rise Like A Phoenix so much this would be my zero. Hate this damn song.

**jaztinax** (1): netta you are a beautiful lady but no

**throwaway-7650** (1): if I wanted nature ASMR I'd just watch david attenborough docs

**Uberpigeon** (1): a nightmare

=====

TakeOnMeByA-ha: **akanewasright** (0): I had this at a 5 at first, but the longer the rate went on, the longer I realized I truly despised this song. Even thinking about it gave me a headache. Every time someone started defending it, I would drop my score by one point, because I kept getting angrier at the song. I got to the point where the song was one of my lowest scores, and realized that yeah, I hated this more than Arcade (my previous 0) at that point. At least I understand the appeal of that song, this one is just flagrantly offensive to the senses (on top of The Aesthetics and coming from Israel). So yeah, fuck this song

**cremeebrulee** (0): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBoderWUcAA3lDp.jpg

**DefaultPophead** (0): I turned Eurovision off when this song played in its year. Turned the channel back when it was over, but once I realised that it was picking up a lot of points, I turned the TV off completely. Still feel physically ill when I catch a glimpse of her face or hear one second of this song. Cultural appropriation is not it. My sister also will not watch Eurovision ever again because this was the first one I had convinced her to watch with me.

**exciting\_patient4872** (0): Worst and most offensive winner of the past couple of years.

**flavasavavandal** (0): an offence to both the eyes and ears

**Melody** (0): Europe was DEFF feeling quirky that night 🤪

**plastichaxan** (0): ooh boy this is one of the most annoying songs i’ve ever heard sdjjlfsd i must confess i was doing the rate listening to the studio versions cause i enjoyed it way more like that and then this came along and is somehow even worse in studio i can't

**vayyiqra** (0): I dread few things in rates, but I dread rating the chicken lady song. I have not heard it, I have only heard tell of it being spoken of in hushed whispers by those with fearful eyes. Few dare mention its name. Only the strong of heart may- Nvm I'll drop the bit I'm doing right now and just say this is too bizarre. It has moments of almost sounding like a good song, but it's way too gimmicky and the vocals are so cringe I want to die inside. yeah this sucks the haters were right

**you2009** (0): so glad this song and performance are genuinely horrid so my score doesn't look like virtue signaling israelis do something right for once

# Tiktok users
**guy\_like\_u** (10): I’m so proud that this song blew up after winning. I believe this will come to be known as one of the greatest winning songs.i get chills every time the crowd joins in, a true stadium anthem

**happyletuce06** (10): i cried 5 times approximately

**iniekcja\_** (10): everytime I hear this it gets better, and I really really hated that it won

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): my comments are so repetitive at this point but i had no idea this was a song for eurovision. i just thought some dude released this banger and that was it

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this was my winner choice for 2019, that being said i fear it will never escape bottom 5 in this rate.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): when this goes out day 1 omfg #istandwithduncan

**shhhneak** (9.5): I kinda just want to homewreck the singer’s marriage.

**daretheghost** (9): A beautiful song. I’m still surprised at the way it blew up after the fact. Thanks TikTok I guess?

**Martin1009** (9): Outsold the italian *clap clap* guy

**itsabop** (8.7): Really feeling this one lately

**seanderlust** (8.7): I really like the arcade metaphor here. this kind of gives me sam smith vibes

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): kinda tired of it, but

**moonagenightmares** (8.5): i was kinda bitter about this winning because i thought it was boring but years later i randomly got this song stuck in my head and i was like wait thats really good what song is that… and it was this. so i’ve reevaluated and it kinda slays i fear

**s2pd** (8.5): I'm a sucker for melancholy

**speaknowred** (8.1): Italy robbed

**afs** (8): i just found this randomly on Spotify without the backstory

**Awkward\_King** (8): i hated this song when it won but now i actually love it

**criestotheclicking** (8): I go back and forth on this. It’s just fine, feels very middle-of-the-road, which I suppose most winners are as they’re popular with the most people.

**hannahspants** (8): is good

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): A great performance, and I can see why it blew up worldwide.

**nt96** (8): wtf this was from Eurovision????

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): a good song. But I never understood how it was such a favourite from the start. Another year where my favourites were really strange though

**fadedblue09** (7.5): I admire the passionate delivery despite feeling cliche

**jaztinax** (7.5): hated the song in 2019. couldn’t for the life of me remember any part of this song at all. then it became viral on tiktok 2 years later and i finally realized that it was a good song. did not deserve to win though

**thedoublebanana** (7.5): A fine song.

**ashandimlotion** (7): the 2021 one-two-three punch of this: being overplayed, being rendered obsolete by tout l’univers and getting roasted by Todd in the shadows really popped my love bubble for it

**BebeLuigi** (7): I actually don't really like the live jbnjkbkjb I feel like the song lost all its impact for me compared to the studio version. But regardless I do love the song

**cremeebrulee** (7): this is so average it does not deserve the discourse it gets tbh

**emmaelf** (7): i think it could've leant further into the folky acoustic elements of this.

**MrSwearword** (7): a reminder, the version with Fletcher is the one that's garbage. Otherwise, you leave this man alone. After all, the lot of you on fucking TikTok decided this should be the one Eurovision winner in 2021 to be the viral hit when Maneskin's actual winning song was right there.

**nootnoot781** (7): not my first choice for winning but i’m glad this performance got us nikkietutorials as a presenter so i guess it worked out <3

**vayyiqra** (7): Idk why there's so much Discourse about this song. It's nice.

**GapeCod** (6): I've warmed up to this song eventually... At the time I was too bitter over Friend of a Friend getting 7 (SEVEN) televotes.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this will go out way too soon just because its the biggest song here. Its not good, but its not the worst

**noideawhatever** (6): I'll disagree with TITS here and say this song is actually ok. not what i look for in eurovision though

# Todd in the Shadows in his Top Ten Worst Hit Songs of 2021 video: 

**throwaway-7650** (5.5): reason #[infinity] to celebrate never having a tiktok account. anyway vote for tiktok 2 so we can bring tiktok U back! u/frog

**bigbigbee** (5): I don’t understand why Europe liked this so much OR why it seems like people hate it so much

**CarlieScion** (5): I simply believe men should not sing

**veryanniev** (5): this is the most forgettable winning song since Running Scared, I still remember how I had to go and watch his performance again when they announced that he won because I genuinely couldn’t place him

**whatyourheartdesires** (5): boring, next please

**celladonn** (4): This isn't as bad as Todd In The Shadows says it is but it is pretty boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): [we actually already roasted this one when it came out back in the popheads jukebox](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bu9vae/the_popheads_jukebox_week_119_listen_boy_my_first/ep8yjna/)

**musical\_pyn** (4): at least the last chorus has SOME energy before it just completely dips back down

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): …Well he has a nice ass. At least he has that going for him

**apatel27** (3): What a boring performance

**astrologicalangel** (3): so sick of this fucking song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3): not even Fletcher could save this

**Stryxen** (3): zero gravity sweetie…

**TiltControls** (2.5): no offence to the guy but this could've worked better if his voice weren't so whiny

**flavasavavandal** (2): it’s really boring, kinda dumb but isn’t worth hating completely

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): two seconds in and I hate it already

**welcome2thejam** (2): As my next 11 puts it, You Lose!

**DefaultPophead** (1.3): Duncan seems lovely, but I hated this song then and still hate it now.

**2dina3dworld** (1): I’m so broken by this rate that this isn’t even a zero contender… if this was charity than this would be an instant zero because I FUCKING HATE IT!!! The definition of squeaky clean, uninteresting, neutered pop ballad!!!

**akanewasright** (1): “loving you is a losing game” makes me long for Amy Winehouse, and the songwriting makes me long for death! This blowing up in the US was fucked up and evil

**CrimsonROSET** (1): if this song was called casino 50% of its problems would be resolved. Like, it’d still be bad, but at least it’d make sense

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): this flop Coldplay song

**plastichaxan** (1): zzzzz

**skargardin** (1): how this won really is beyond me

**you2009** (1): I really wish he hadn't named this arcade cos I was expecting a fun anime adjacent bop and instead got this

**1998tweety** (0): SNOOZE

**frogaranaman** (0): would rather someone give me unspeakable trauma that forever alters the direction of my life and viewpoint before I ever hear this song again

**RandomHypnotica** (0): THIS WAS SUCH A BAD WINNER AND THEN IT WENT ON TO BE A FUCKING TIKTOK HIT???? WHY?!?!?!?!?

**thedoctordances1940** (0): this is just absolutely fucking atrocious, it genuinely makes me physically cringe in reaction to it. There are a lot of bad songs in this rate but none of them could manage that

**MoonlightByWindow** (11): i think eric saade’s appearance in eurovision actually shaped the trajectory of my life…no i will not elaborate…

**sirpancakeXI** (11): It is the kind of song that you just need to turn your brain off to enjoy and it should have won 2011 idc idc.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i dont understand how you can hate this this song is perfect

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is eliciting such conflicting feelings from me, i’m just gonna give it a 10 and move on

**ashandimlotion** (9): the only bad thing about this is that it reminds me that every minute should’ve been the Swedish entry in 2021

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): This is so cheesy I love it.

**guy\_like\_u** (9): Eric walked so Mans could run in 2015. The lyrics are cringe but this 100% should have won

**happyletuce06** (9): a song that rhymes impossible with possible cannot be bad

**Melody** (9): this BANGS

**vayyiqra** (8): This isn't Erik Satie but it slaps almost as much! (No really his singing is pretty awful but I really like this instrumental to this and I fw him for trying)

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.9): this feels like a 2nd gen kpop song

**shhhneak** (7.7): Featuring Dante from the Devil May Cry Series!

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): i mean it's a swedish entry of course it's gonna have perfect pop production but also it's slightly underwhelming? blown away by euphoria the year after

**speaknowred** (7.6): A bit overrated

**bigbigbee** (7.5): The lyrics on this are truly the nadir of Eurovision lyrics but the tune slaps

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): ok you know what, this does go into “so bad its camp” territory

**itsabop** (7.5): The lyrics are absurd, but you can't deny this is a bop

**thedoublebanana** (7.2): He put everything into this performance and honestly should've won.

**apatel27** (7): Dante dancing in front of an LED pokeball is something

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): we can’t all be Ariana, MIKA or Kristin Chenoweth

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Idina Menzel talking Kristen Chenoweth in Wicked

**jaztinax** (7): i know you’re going to get there one day sweetie

**LesApfels** (7): Lyrical king rhyming impossible with possible

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): In the hands of a less charming man, this would have flopped hard. It's a miracle he pulled it off.

**MrSwearword** (7): I mean, of all the OGAE favorites to survive the grand final...I can kind of see why this was the last one standing but the song doesn't hold up well plus I remember Blue coming in eleventh for the UK lol.

**Smuckles** (7): I don't think this is good as such, but I like it

**throwaway-7650** (7): his voice is a bit annoying at times but go off KJ apa

**awkward\_penguin** (6.9): The song itself is mediocre (why all the random key changes?) and the singer is pretty weak at the beginning. But damn, the staging is cool. The choreography, the backing vocals, and the glass - when it broke, that was the first time so far I've actually gasped. The staging added 2.5 points to an otherwise below-average song.

**plastichaxan** (6.5): this is fruity

# you will NEVER be famous

**criestotheclicking** (6): Boney M might want their intro back…

**noideawhatever** (6): the beat at the beginning teases a much more interesting song than the one we get... it's still ok though.

**s2pd** (6): boring

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Oh this song is a little 💅 isn't it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5.5): This has the energy of a High School Musical song that got rejected for being too on the nose, and got out-camped by Bet On It. That being said… it’s ridiculously catchy.

**veryanniev** (5.5): I think the last time I’ve listened to this was in 2011 during the Eurovision itself so the fact this song samples fucking Rasputin by Boney M is completely new information to me, what the fuck???

**BebeLuigi** (5): Obsessed with the pokemon aesthetic

**frogaranaman** (5): it kind of bops? I dunno man

**iniekcja\_** (5): S̶t̶e̶f̶a̶n̶i̶ ̶G̶e̶r̶m̶a̶n̶o̶t̶t̶a̶ Eric Saade you will n̶e̶v̶e̶r̶ be f̶a̶m̶o̶u̶s̶ popular

**welcome2thejam** (5): They snatched this straight out of a pile of discarded first drafts for Popstar: Never Stop Popping songs

**moonagenightmares** (4.7): used to hate this so much

**daretheghost** (4): These verses are just so… empty.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): this sounds like it’s sung by a gummy bear in a ringtone commercial

**babadork** (3.8): I think this would have been better in a language I don’t understand.

**seanderlust** (3.5): me to myself having a social anxiety attack in the bathroom of a party

**CarlieScion** (3): GOD I hate Eric Saade so much

**CrimsonROSET** (3): bad DCOM song and AGAIN the Rasputin claps

**flavasavavandal** (3): despite popular belief, not every Swedish person is born with the skills of ABBA in their blood

**GapeCod** (3): what is the opposite of nominative determinism? i hate that the hook is catchy as hell, but oh my god the rest of the song is awwwwwful

**Kaylaboe** (3): no

**Uberpigeon** (2.5): hasnt this guy been on here three times already

**akanewasright** (2): Eric Saade you will NEVER be famous

**indie\_fan\_** (2): Middle-School ass lyrics. And even then I know middle schoolers who were better writers.

**Martin1009** (2): Why did we send this and why did it do well?

**nootnoot781** (2): 🍅 🍅 🍅

**hannahspants** (1): ew

**musical\_pyn** (1): I cannot believe I'm not giving this my 0

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): his singing is so annoying

**2dina3dworld** (0): oh hi Reece Mastin knock off

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (0): I’m Irish and this almost let Sweden win 😑. But honestly it’s not that awful. But also 0 😤

**TiltControls** (0): I can't even tell what they were trying to do with this one

**ZebraSun73** (0): Where do I start? It's aggressively bad. Lyrics are god awful. The production is bloated and desperate. I mean Russia in 2016 levels of desperate. Can you tell we had a NATIONAL CRISIS when we did not qualify for the final in 2010?

# Shake what your mamma gave 'ya
**CarlieScion** (10): QUEENS!!!!!!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m throwing ass

**iniekcja\_** (10): vividly remembering my 12yo gay ass singing this with the besties, never done anything this patriotic again

**you2009** (10): don't ask.

**Awkward\_King** (9): tits!!!!!!!!!!!

**Melody** (9): The PERFORMANCE >>>>

**moonagenightmares** (9): ignores the disgustingly predictable objectification of slavic women this is a bop

**RoyalBloodFool** (9): The Polish Bang Bang

**thedoublebanana** (9): This is the campy bop that I needed in the moment and I still love it.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): I feel like entries like these are getting more and more uncommon

**awkward\_penguin** (8.7): CHURN THAT BUTTER GIRL, RINSE THOSE CLOTHS HONEY

**speaknowred** (8.2): Fun

**afs** (8): WE NEED PHCJ TO FIND THIS

**noideawhatever** (8): is this polish milf$? stuff like this is why i watch eurovision

**vayyiqra** (8): Ah, the motherland :flag_pl: Loved the costumes and butter churning unironically, it made me laugh, nice touch. The song? oh yeah I like it I guess but mainly I found the performance hilarious as a self-parody of my family's culture.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I am beginning to think they wanted us to look at those girls boobies

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): this will be in European history books

**No-Place-to-Go** (7.5): Self-empowering anthem idc what anybody says!

**berober04** (7): butter.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): This is the Sound of Music world Gwen Stefani created in Wind It Up. This is either good or bad

**fadedblue09** (7): annoying but I'll give points for unusual theme

**happyletuce06** (7): a slavic hymn

**Martin1009** (7): I don't think this song's about churning butter?

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this being the only rep in the rate for poles asksdfk i still remember my parents + aunt hysterically laughing at this performance and i didn’t get what was so funny sob emoji

**plastichaxan** (7): my souvlaki

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Yeah, Slavs! Woo!

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): not the best song but really needed after a stretch of mostly ridiculously dull songs

#Thirst trapping? In MY Eurovision Rate?
**criestotheclicking** (6): not the seductive milk churning… in all seriousness this is pretty fun and I like the fiddle/accordion instrumental bit.

**GapeCod** (6): [redacted]'s Croatian heritage leaving his body after listening to this.

**Stryxen** (6): i’m not gagging

**welcome2thejam** (6): Performance shows off several of my dream girl attributes: churns butter, washes clothes inefficiently, is friends with a girl group, does that horny af lip bite while my boys are hootin and hollerin in the background

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): their voices are so annoying omg, the violin is nice though

**Kaylaboe** (5.5): we'll never forget when poland breastily boobed across the stage

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i guess

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): I feel like there have seen a million similar performances like this from eastern europe countries.

**guy\_like\_u** (5): legendary, wish the song was as iconic as the group

**skargardin** (5): this really was something

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is dreadful but the butter churning is one of the iconic eurovision moments im aware of so points for that. not many points though.

**apatel27** (4.5): Wasn't expecting wankbait

**akanewasright** (4): tits!

**BebeLuigi** (4): The performance is fun but the song is pretty whatever to me

**cremeebrulee** (2): she sounds awful omfg

**DefaultPophead** (2): My ears and eyes hurt.

**frogaranaman** (1): got annoying

**hannahspants** (1): this is an awful song. Awful.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (1): The voices are grating, the song is bad, and the performance was clearly made with one specific type of audience in mind. Horrendous.

**MrSwearword** (1): I should applaud their ambition to be so awful but instead, I'm just mad.

**TiltControls** (1): this is too straight to be camp

**daretheghost** (0): I have always hated everything about this song. The best thing about it is that it’s saving Satellite from being my 0.

**seanderlust** (0): like if little mix made a song that intentionally gives the listener a headache

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Ok this one is an actual fucking robbery. While I Wanna is by no means the most well remembered or most liked winner (hell, every single wiki page written about it, including on the *official Eurovision website*, makes it a point to bring up how badly this song flopped after the contest), it's still insanely fun and catchy, and has in my opinion the best staging of any song in this rate. I mean, where else are you gonna see a song where a woman rips off her suit to reveal a floor length dress underneath? Only in Eurovision, that's where! Most people seem to agree the performance is more memorable than the song, and I guess that's fair, but it's still sad to see this leaving Day 1. But hey! At least we're finally above a 6 average!

**racloves** (6): that outfit is giving everything for the lesbians

---
# I Wanna!
**Ghost-Quartet** (11): This had me by the neck from the first second I heard it, it’s so colorful! I earmarked it for my 11 and it was still my favorite by the end, I hope it does well.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh the number of dance numbers I’ll have in my room to this song

**frogaranaman** (10): you know what? yea sure I'll pop my pussy to this

**GapeCod** (10): OH WOW THIS IS KINDA EVERYTHING

**RandomHypnotica** (10): You can be WHATEVER you want to be in my life Marie you gave such a serve holy shit

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Removing the suit to reveal the most basic pink dress, icon behavior.

**iniekcja\_** (9): I ⭐got⭐a trick😜up my sleeve💁🏿‍♀️. A stunt 🤸🏿‍♂️that the 👨‍👧‍👦crowd 👨‍👨‍👦won’t believe😳🤯. But I keep em guessing🤔 guessing🥵. As you learn👩‍🏫 your lesson👩🏿‍🎓 lesson👩🏿‍🎓. Now we ✋pause✋for the big 🎇🎆reveal🎇🎆. And you ❌never❌ saw👀 it coming, baby👶. Up my sleeve💁🏿‍♀️ another something 🤔maybe⁉️. You were gooped😱 and gagged🙉 and you can’t 🙅🏿‍♀️believe it🤯. Now here’s another one🥳-and you ❌didn’t❌ see👀 it coming😳🥵😱

**throwaway-7650** (9): ~~Go~~ it's giving theater production [non-derogatory]

**babadork** (8.5): I get that Eurovision isn’t Drag Race, but this being the only song with a costume reveal is shocking to me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): a 7.5 for the song being a serve + 1 for lesbianism

**afs** (8): snatched everything except her wig

**akanewasright** (8): she came she served cunt she died omfgggg

**celladonn** (8): Catchy bop and I have to give it extra points for the bisexualness of the performance

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): sapphic Mambo No.5

**ignitethephoenix** (8): oh this is a summer bop

**nt96** (8): I THINK WE ALL WANNA

**seanderlust** (7.7): this performance was a serve....queen of reveals

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): added a point because of the performance was gay

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): there is a whole song going on but the crowd is like “there is less clothing on the woman, let’s cheer”

**speaknowred** (7.3): The reveal saves it to be honest

**ashandimlotion** (7): I think this performance is a serve even if the song isn’t great

**DefaultPophead** (7): The bisexuals have won.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i didn’t ask to be born *quick google search* Latvian

**Melody** (7): The 2000s wacky vibes from this ❤️

**s2pd** (7): Okay song, unforgettable stage show

**TiltControls** (7): the performance video bumped this up a solid 2 points

**indie\_fan\_** (6.7): Not as bad as some make it out to be, but the singing could still use some work

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.6): extra points for the outfit change on stage

**jaztinax** (6.5): spice girls vibes!

**thedoctordances1940** (6.2): it's cute ig

**awkward\_penguin** (6.1): QUEEN of bisexual staging and QUEEN of Euroveals. It's a fairly standard salsa song that wouldn't stand out if it weren't for the brilliant staging. The dancing was simple but eye-catching, and gender-bending in 2002 is leaving me GAGGED.

# I don't

**BebeLuigi** (6): It's pretty unpopular nowadays as a winner but I really think her performance was great lol

**hannahspants** (6): i literally can't think of anything to say about this except that it's better than the previous two

**Kaylaboe** (6): not sure why this won either but considering the year it was in.... it makes sense

**LunaMoonMeUp** (6): It's a decent song, but she has charisma for days.

**MrSwearword** (6): I wanna listen to something that isn't dated by at least ten years even for 2002. Also, Ira Losco, sweetie I am so sorry.

**vayyiqra** (6): Getting the feeling this is an attempt at an ABBA ripoff but I kind of dig it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The kind of Eurovision song my feeble American mind doesn’t really like

**Stryxen** (5.9): this performance is exactly what i imagine happens daily in latvia

**thedoublebanana** (5.5): There wasn't much stand out in 2002, but this was fun.

**happyletuce06** (5): really mid but saved a bit by the performance

**Smuckles** (5): Perhaps she borrowed Ricky Martin's producer?

**veryanniev** (5): she looked so much better in the suit

**CarlieScion** (4): a ‘wtf’-eurovision song but not in a good fun way

**daretheghost** (4): Kind of corny, very dated-I think even for 2002.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): this woman would be torn to shreds if this performance happened now. Like she literally cannot sing or dance??

**shhhneak** (4): Sasha Velour’s life was changed after this.

**Uberpigeon** (4): i dont

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): THEY YASSIFIED HER MID PERFORMANCE?????????????

**apatel27** (3): I know it's not about the singing quality but this is painful

**criestotheclicking** (3): this feels unkind but wow. Points for dressing like MJ from the Smooth Criminal MV?

**emmaelf** (3): oh eurovision. the staging was good?

**guy\_like\_u** (3): I refuse to believe this song is from 2002 and not 1983

**Martin1009** (3): Ira Losco robbed

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (3): it’s fun I guess 😩

**skargardin** (3): The fact that the best part of this performance was the dress reveal at the very end of it, girl it was camp

**ZebraSun73** (3): Are we sure this song is only 3 minutes. The best part is when it ends

**fadedblue09** (2): I like the performer's energy but this was a mess

# [Well,](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/4b/a1/a9/4ba1a929d89f0820e98c94e6a6efee4d.jpg)

**plastichaxan** (10): wow what a fucking moment who could ever give this a 0 you are my new enemy in rates

**nootnoot781** (0): god awful song and only won because of staging that the UK of all places did better 20 years prior. 🍅

**nt96** (10): NEXT TIME WARN ME BEFORE YOU SLAY THIS HARD

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): karol G would release this :noitstrue:

**daretheghost** (9): This is way better than I remember???

**iniekcja\_** (8): I can't help but wonder what the staging would be like

**RandomHypnotica** (8): why tf is this not called Diamond

**vayyiqra** (8): The lyrics for this made me do a double take but after looking them up they are about empowerment so that's cool

**ZebraSun73** (8): OK this is pretty sick??? I'm also uncomfortable?? #nun

**DirtyRat583** (7.1): chaotic but not bad

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): it’s like a fine Ava Max deep cut do “not so main pop girls” like woah…

**DefaultPophead** (7): Legitimately have no recollection in my mind of this song and I watched the whole year.

**hannahspants** (7): I hate this song but I also don't

**happyletuce06** (7): she served everything she had to and more

**thedoublebanana** (6.5): I don't know why I stan this, but it's like so bad it's good.

**apatel27** (6): This would probably have a smash set design

**criestotheclicking** (6): I really dislike the verses - she is a bad rapper, but she is an amazing singer. The pre-chorus and chains on you bits are super catchy. A song of two halves.

**Stryxen** (6): she’s gonna put jeans on me :scared:

**LunaMoonMeUp** (5): The instrumental slays, but the chorus is so repetative, the lyrics are pretty generic, and overall it does very little for me.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): ou, at least it's not boring

**seanderlust** (4.5): this would be a B side on Alexis rose's EP "a little bit alexis"

**Martin1009** (4): Would not make it out of the semi

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (4): I don’t get it, I’m sorry :/ I just don’t like her method of singing 😞

**s2pd** (4): Really not my style

**racloves** (9): should have won

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): 2017 is a wild year in Eurovision for many reasons, but perhaps the most wild of these reasons is the absolute *domination* two acts in particular had in the voting, those two being Salvador Sobral, who we have already bid farewell to in this rate, and Kristian Kostov. Both had very touching ballads with memorable performances, and while Salvador won the night, I think most people look back in hindsight and agree Kristian should've won instead. Keep in mind he was only *17* years old at the time of Eurovision, and he still managed to sound absolutely flawless and captivate the audience. This isn't exactly Popheads' cup of tea when it comes to music, and I understand why it went out so early, but man, this song deserved better.

# Beautiful
**throwaway-7650** (11): [finally some ~~good~~ real fucking ~~food~~ music YASS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgxz23-i3lA)

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): Still pissed that this little twink didn’t win. The amount of televotes he received was INSANE. But unfortunately he participated in the same year as S*lv*d*r S*br*l, who the juries ate up. He was just 17 and kinda blew all other artists that year out of the water with his voice.

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): I wish Kristian came back to Eurovision and sang a modern ballad again with his super mature powerful voice. Ily, kid

**daretheghost** (9.5): Soooo gooooood the fuck

**Stryxen** (9.5): deserved the win, everyone knows that

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): i appreciate that kristian kostov actually followed me on twitter for a few months back in 2017…i can only assume he unfollowed because he got sick of seeing bts and exo content on his timeline

**skargardin** (9): the soft drop is so good

**shhhneak** (8.9): This is just a good pop song period.

**sirpancakeXI** (8.5): the way he was only 17 and sang this good….

**awkward\_penguin** (8.1): What a damn hard song to sing. To switch between falsetto and regular tone is NOT easy, and Kristian did a pretty good job.

**afs** (8): I'm being tested but ill never get tired of vocals

**hannahspants** (8): I sometimes can't get the riff of this song out of my head

**iniekcja\_** (8): I have a hard time sympathyzing with twinks

**Kaylaboe** (8): this would've been a good winner too

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): this song was beautiful but not a mess. I hated it for being just a pretty boy on stage but I’ve come around. I was too judgy

**s2pd** (8): Touching power ballad

**guy\_like\_u** (7.5): a really great performance, just a shame they tried to bolt on those lame graphics.

**thedoublebanana** (7.2): I want to like this more but I don't. Like it's good but overhyped.

**criestotheclicking** (7): another son of Måns? His live vocals are stunning - and at 17? Amazing. Song’s a little boring.

**happyletuce06** (7): just solid

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): Another song that's a great vocal showcase, but doesn't do enough for me to warrant revisiting.

**Martin1009** (7): Tbh would not be a great winner either

**MrSwearword** (7): I'll admit, I still haven't warmed to this performance over the years. Still, it was contemporary presentation-wise.

# Mess

**apatel27** (6.5): Kinda tired of big ballads now

**BebeLuigi** (6): Not much to say it's a fine song...

**bigbigbee** (6): OMG, [LUHAN FROM EXO IN THEIR 2013 COMEBACK, WOLF?](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/b2/4f/e9/b24fe9d9b409e87ba1079f23a968a6a8.jpg)

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I like the production on the drop, I just wish they’d found a better sound for the rest of the song

**moooo566** (6): there's no way this guy is 17

**vayyiqra** (6): Feel like the 2000s was full of alt-pop-rock bands doing songs that sounded like this.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Yawn

**DefaultPophead** (5.9): Cute, but doesn't do much for me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): forgettable

**frogaranaman** (5): this is literal nothingness of a song. can't even form a strong like or dislike of this song

**CarlieScion** (4): can we stop with the boring male ballads

**CrimsonROSET** (4): me @ the results

**emmaelf** (4): the drum beat in the background is so 2017, it almost makes me laugh. the song feels like it's reaching for emotional heights it just doesn't achieve.

**plastichaxan** (3): not messy or beautiful what’s the point

**Smuckles** (3): One interesting thing I've found going down this list of songs is that overall the quality has got worse as it's gone further into recent years, or at least the songs aren't as fun. This is a good example, just really underbaked and boring. I can see Maneskin in the distance though!

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): Bulgaria you ate the previous year why go in this direction

**Uberpigeon** (3): the onceler i love your work

**welcome2thejam** (3): Wish it was a beautiful mess, at least that'd be interesting

**ashandimlotion** (2.5): people loved this but honestly if you preferred this to salvador you need to get! it! together!

**musical\_pyn** (2): the camerawork is really nice!

**thedoctordances1940** (2): i mean yeah this is the kind of bad song i'd expect from a 17 year old but like come on

**Awkward\_King** (1): i'll never understand how this song did so well like what the fuck is special about it. girl this sounds like a troye sivan song from 2014 and that is not a compliment

**moonagenightmares** (1): another ballad…

**racloves** (8): sis is out here doing magic on the Eurovision stage

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): when i was 16 i used to listen to the nightcore version of rockefeller street religiously and im not saying that that was the pipeline to me becoming a eurovision stan but...

---
# Comments that mention nightcore
**1998tweety** (11): nightcore SMASH

**apatel27** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pV68ATfu2qw

**moooo566** (10): i feel like this would be even more of a bop if someone sped it up like 30% and replaced the video with a picture of two anime catgirls

**seanderlust** (9.6): help the way I only knew the nightcore remix of this song

**ImADudeDuh** (9): nightcore queen

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): am i dumb how did she do that magic trick??? ALSO THIS IS FROM EUROVISION? it's not just a nightcore song?

**2dina3dworld** (8): I am petty and taking two points off for not being the nightcore version.

**Melody** (8): we love AMV’s ❤️

**thedoublebanana** (8): The fact that this blew up because of the nightcore version just shows how global this song could've been.

**berober04** (7): N I G H T C O R E

**vayyiqra** (7): The nightcore remix of this lives rent-free in my head, but this isn't as good. Sad!

**BebeLuigi** (6): The nightcore version outsold

**bigbigbee** (6): If you search this song in google the first result is a nighcore remix and the thumbnail has two anime catgirls

**happyletuce06** (6): just solid, sounds better in nightcore

**Kaylaboe** (4.5): osu remix outsold

**LunaMoonMeUp** (3): The song is fun and catchy (albeit better pitched up...) but she could not sing for the life of her. She sounded out of tune from the very first note.

**you2009** (2): kurp making us listen to the nightcore version of this in a listening party made me like this even less cos it made me think of what it could've been it's sad

**frogaranaman** (1): the nightcore remix of this prepped us for an entire generation of Tiktok audios

# Comments that do Not

**MrSwearword** (10): This final was so painful for anyone that liked bops (shoutout to Kati Wolf as well).

**RandomHypnotica** (10): (1 x2) (7 x3) these are what the scores will be

**Smuckles** (10): Memories of this song came FLOODING back the second I saw the song title, that's the sign of a real good Eurovision track. Absolute banger.

**shhhneak** (9.9): This is when Glee jumped the shark.

**ashandimlotion** (9.5): how on earth did this place so low??

**celladonn** (9.5): slay

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this is kinda eurobeat vibes i live

**TiltControls** (9.5): I don't know if I can call this good, but it is fun

**nootnoot781** (9): this was the first eurovision i watched (i was 10) so i couldn’t watch the entire contest, so the next day my dad asked me what i thought won. this was my first guess and he just laughed.

**afs** (8.5): when was this a meem???

**speaknowred** (8.3): Bop

**astrologicalangel** (8): tiktok has ruined my brain

**CarlieScion** (8): BOP!!!!!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): yeah okay I can get down to this

**s2pd** (7.5): Guilty pleasure for me, it's probably the interesting beat

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): speaking of Estonian pop, the verses give mild Kerli - Walking on Air vibes, then the chorus is… a total departure

**iniekcja\_** (7.3): would make a pope joke

**moonagenightmares** (7.3): cute song

**emmaelf** (7): why does the new york song have the london eye in the background? great meme energy and yes i do want to know what rockefeller groover is.

**Martin1009** (7): banger

**musical\_pyn** (7): this score is actually the amount of times I watched the magic trick at the beginning before moving getting to the rest of the song

**noideawhatever** (7): cute song

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): I like this song but it feels wrong to me. I can’t explain it. Like a horror soundtrack 😍

**Uberpigeon** (7): rachel berry i love your work

**daretheghost** (6): Sort of a Frankenstein’s monster of a song but it’s fun enough.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): uh why was this chosen for this rate. Estonia has sent better song than that. Should have been Urban Symphony's 2009 song "Rändajad" or Stig Rästa and Elina Born 2015 song "Goodbye to Yesterday" instead. Please listen to Rändajad guys, it's similar to Euphoria before it was cool.

**GapeCod** (6): MacArthur Park outsold

**hannahspants** (6): try to not get this stupid song stuck in your head I dare you

**itsabop** (6): Had no idea this was a meme but I can see why

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): “Everything’s a little bit weird now” Glad the feeling's mutual

**veryanniev** (6): I rewatched the beginning about 10 times because my brain coudn’t compute how the hell she turned a ribbon into a stick so I’m giving her a 6 just for that. The song itself is… not good.

**DefaultPophead** (5.5): This may have the production value of a senior year musical and kinda really suck, but it didn't deserve to be basically last!

**akanewasright** (5): this is just Glee with less autotune

**criestotheclicking** (5): I miss when Estonia sent interesting acts (such as this one)

**CrimsonROSET** (5): is this song about the rockettes

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): this is Katy Perry meets the Wiggles and I’m sadly not living

**ZebraSun73** (5): It's been 11 years and I still don't know what I think of this song. It.. is?

**awkward\_penguin** (4.2): This is a meme, right? It's okay - the images were cool, and it's a different-sounding song. But nothing special.

**guy\_like\_u** (4): idk it was fine I guess

**jaztinax** (4): why does this sound like this was made in 2001

**LesApfels** (4): This emanates Rachel Berry energy

**thedoctordances1940** (3.4): the hook just fucking sucks, i'm sorry

**Awkward\_King** (3): me being a eurovision fan and i didnt even know this was where the audio was from

**Stryxen** (3): SO iconic and SO bad

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): LET'S PLAY SOME BASKETBALL! - fergie

**fadedblue09** (2): I'm sad I didnt like any of the Estonian songs, so I'll just have my vexillology nerd moment and say they have the coolest flag ever

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): okay how did she do that thing with the ribbon though

**thisusernameisntlong** (2): first time in this rate that I wanted to skip a song

**indie\_fan\_** (1): What in the Halloween X Alice in Wonderland crossover???

**sirpancakeXI** (0): this is just a mess. the staging, the dancing, the song itself, all messy af.

# Kenatu narilé, lakenatu narilé (im going to assume these imaginary lyrics mean something positive you can't prove me wrong)
**MrSwearword** (10): Belgium and their imaginary language songs are some of the most god-tier trolling ever concocted.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the folk vibe and the fake language?? Immaculate

**daretheghost** (9.5): This is straight up my alley. IllumiNations: Reflections of Earth pre-show atmosphere music type beat.

**seanderlust** (9.3): man looking for a translation for these lyrics was confusing. every translation site i found was just like "listen sean, the lady said Sanomi helé, isn't that good enough for you????"

**thedoublebanana** (9.2): The haunting beauty of this song is what captivates me and has me scoring them high.

**BebeLuigi** (9): It's amazing

**nt96** (9): downtempo but make it hella majestic

**awkward\_penguin** (8.6): I had heard about this song sung in a made-up language but had never bothered to listen to it. And WOW, it hooked me from the very beginning. I think the fact that it's not a real language made it even more mystical - perhaps foreign and yet unifying at the same time? The Celtic influences were gorgeously done, and the staging, while nothing spectacular, was intimate. Just beautiful.

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): imagine having every language in the world to pick from and u choose to just make up one. iconic

**whatyourheartdesires** (8.5): I still cannot believe that you can sing such a beautiful song in a made up language

**DefaultPophead** (8.2): This is gorgeous! They're gorgeous!

**afs** (8): how many popheads won't realise this is an imaginary language

**cremeebrulee** (8): their simlish slay

**emmaelf** (8): this feels like it should be on the soundtrack for the civilization games. and that is an absolute compliment.

**hannahspants** (8): I wanted to hate this when I first read it was in a made up language but it's damn good.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I like the folky vibes this has

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): personally would’ve voted for this. Wish more songs like this were in Eurovision, I think SHUM started a movement of folk-y songs(hopefully)

**s2pd** (8): Lovely

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): idk why these Belgians decided to do a Celtic song but I’m glad they tried

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Oh my god what do you mean this language is all fake?? And it’s from Belgium, not *insert eastern European country here* as I first assumed? I’m a little disappointed that the words don’t mean anything

**you2009** (8): a smasha on simlish radio

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): this feels halfway between JRPG village music and a ritual

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): actually really like this one

**ashandimlotion** (7): sanomi sanomi nothing more that I can say says it in a better way

**itsabop** (7): There's something really pretty about this melody

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): Truly unique and hypnotic.

**speaknowred** (7): It was not my thing

**vayyiqra** (7): Enya type beat (complimentary).

# Aliya irema nia madilé (im going to assume these imaginary lyrics mean something negative you can't prove me wrong)

**shhhneak** (6.7): They just be saying shit

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.6): i can't decide if i like this or not but it reminds me of this French song called La tribu de Dana

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Another one that sounds like something from a soundtrack

**Stryxen** (6.5): she looks like miranda cosgrove from some angles

**apatel27** (6): Bagpipes were a choice

**CrimsonROSET** (6): if I was a snake I’d be charmed

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this fake Celtic language singing is Enyappropriation lmao

**indie\_fan\_** (6): Beautiful instrumentation, but man that voice is definitely not for me

**skargardin** (6): I kept waiting for this to go.. somewhere

**happyletuce06** (5.5): don't have any strong feelings about this one

**frogaranaman** (5): ...I mean sure

**jaztinax** (5): a little too shouty for me

**nootnoot781** (5): the fact they’re singing in a made up language is so fucking funny to me. literally no words just vibes

**Smuckles** (5): I imagine this might get some Enya comparisons.

**throwaway-7650** (5): I can't unhear the song title as "sat on MEEEEEEEEEE"

**akanewasright** (4.5): you mean that, if America did Eurovision, we could’ve had Katy Perry perform Last Friday Night (TGIF) (Simlish Version)?

**fadedblue09** (4): The performers looks like regretting they're doing this

**noideawhatever** (4): at first i was enjoying it, but then it got really repetitive and boring

**guy\_like\_u** (2): I Don’t see the appeal

**moonagenightmares** (2): i cant believe a song this boring won a year before the legendary 2004 eurovision

**Awkward\_King** (1): ???

**Martin1009** (1): Ban imaginary languages pls

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): that white woman is just living her best life

**criestotheclicking** (9): this is very charming and dare I say better than the actual world cup song France made when they won. Both are good but this is more carefree.

**bigbigbee** (8): The World Cup really is so much fun…THE WORLD COMING TOGETHER...i’m obsessed…people who don’t like it don’t get the drama

**plastichaxan** (8): latin vacation vibes yass

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): add Jessy Matador to the Men of 2010 lineup tbh

**DirtyRat583** (6.6): eurovision eats when theyre just out here having fun

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this is cheesy as fuck

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): this reminds me of Inna - More Than Friends which is weird because this song came out earlier

**whatyourheartdesires** (6.5): is it a song for FIFA World Cup?

**awkward\_penguin** (6.3): It sounds super dated for some reason? But the African beats are a nice touch, and ti's fun enough.

# No No No!

**akanewasright** (6): they served a little, but they could’ve served better food or something idk

**ashandimlotion** (6): straightest Eurovision entry

**daretheghost** (6): Perhaps the World Cuppiest World Cup Song.

**fadedblue09** (6): I think I heard this before??

**Kaylaboe** (6): this was fun but hasn't aged well at all

**vayyiqra** (6): Kind of bops but these vocals are rough.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Proof that “fun” and “good” are not synonyms

**welcome2thejam** (6): If only the rest of the song was as cool as that dance break. Shoutout to just the random closeup of their asses

**LesApfels** (5.5): I love Danza Kuduro!

**DefaultPophead** (5.1): I almost enjoyed this song but the more it dragged on the more it felt like I was being held against my will.

**berober04** (5): Isn't this the end credits song to Fast Five?

**frogaranaman** (5): this is just sounds

**guy\_like\_u** (5): I’m here for France trying to bring the Macarena back in 2010, only with more focus on the ass

**hannahspants** (5): no comment (literally. Can't think of one)

**indie\_fan\_** (5): Ooof Jessy is fine... that's it, that's all I wanted to say. Alright, jokes aside, the song's catchy, but the performance gave me second hand embarrasement.

**iniekcja\_** (5): in celebration of ass and football

**jaztinax** (5): i want to like this more but it sounds like a song made by some local in-house band hired for corporate event gigs who gets paid in a limited amount of free beer

**LunaMoonMeUp** (5): I know it's a huge song in the world of football, and it is fun, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired.

**Martin1009** (5): kinda fun but not interesting at all

**moonagenightmares** (5): repetitive

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (5): feels like a World Cup theme song, not in an especially good way. Waka waka destroys this any day

**RandomHypnotica** (4.2): I feel like all this is missing is a random venezuela because it's very 2010 FIFA World Cup core

**happyletuce06** (4): aged horribly

**Smuckles** (4): I'm fairly sure this song was the background to every package holiday I went on as a kid..

**MoonlightByWindow** (3.5): girl france have really never sent a single good song to eurovision huh

**GapeCod** (2): L + ratio + french + Playing With Fire outscored and deserved this spot more!!!

**skargardin** (2): I hate it here omg

**CrimsonROSET** (1): kuduro

**racloves** (8): Yeah she maybe wasn’t serving as she should, but the song is still great

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): Closing out today's round of songs is Blanche's downtempo pop song that wowed audiences by her bold move to...do absolutely nothing the entire performance. Ok, well maybe it's a little harsh to say it like that, as she was only 17 at the time and obviously suffering from stage fright, but in a rate with so many wild and electric performances, this stands out in all the wrong ways. The studio version is better though! not by much but still. better

---
# The Weeknd - Blinding Lights
**BebeLuigi** (10): I am still conviced to this day that she could have gone head to head with the Portugal if the staging had been be a bit more dynamic haha, It's an amazing song.

**CarlieScion** (10): so gorgeous!!!!!!

**guy\_like\_u** (10): I love her lack of energy. She truly gave us nothing

**happyletuce06** (10): gets me so emotional every time

**shhhneak** (10): the girls that get it get it and the girls that don’t don’t.

**Stryxen** (10): this is so boring i adore it blanche you will always be famous

**TiltControls** (10): pretty low-key compared to some of the others, but I really like it

**ZebraSun73** (10): SO GOOD

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this is so indie vibes

**DefaultPophead** (9.4): I really loved her voice. It stood out despite her looking dead nervous that year.

**astrologicalangel** (9): I'm biased cause I used to listen to this a lot at the time and now I'm super nostalgic for it

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): Another song that is too good to be in eurovision.

**Kaylaboe** (9): okay hear me out. her performance was GOOD. she was scared to death singing there but it suited the mood of the song perfectly

**Martin1009** (9): Studio-version is one of the strongest ever in the competition. yup, yup, i said it

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): fantastic song in a weak year. I wish this had delivered fully on stage, it was so mesmerizing

**sirpancakeXI** (9): a cute bop

**skargardin** (9): I still think this could've been a winner contender with a better performance

**vayyiqra** (9): How did this start out sounding like it was going to be an Adele-like song and then ... idk but the beat switch was a good move is what I'm trying to say here.

**criestotheclicking** (8): I really like the song itself - the title is super appropriate for the vibe - but the performance is a little lacklustre.

**iniekcja\_** (8): oh I remember this, I was mesmerized by her voice, but it really… doesn't sound as good as I thought back then

**musical\_pyn** (8): This is so much better than I expected from that piano intro

**RandomHypnotica** (8): Blanche is unfortunately just not the right type of singer for this song, she seems SO nervous and uncomfortable on stage, and this songs is calling for more energy

**throwaway-7650** (8): really like the song but the performance did #not give

**daretheghost** (7.5): I mean I like this song but I feel like it’s at such a disadvantage here…

**s2pd** (7.5): Very interesting structure

**speaknowred** (7.4): A bit boring

**afs** (7): poor girl is so nervous I actually feel bad

**cremeebrulee** (7): ok this is gonna piss me off forever what other song does this remind me of

**emmaelf** (7): a very unique voice. the song feels really reserved, which i do like, but i'm not sure the backing music matches the feel as well.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is us core but make it upbeat

**moooo566** (7): i wish the climax that this song is obviously building to actually happened

**awkward\_penguin** (6.5): Poor girl was terrified on stage, but she held her own. The studio version of this song rocks.

# Charlie Puth - Light Switch

**akanewasright** (6): Bridgit Mendler outsold

**ashandimlotion** (6): I feel like a lot of the 2017 songs were good songs kind of badly performed??? Didn’t this like barely qualify?

**Melody** (6): whats with the sad songs DAMN.

**veryanniev** (6): it’s a good song but the performance is so lifeless and I’d rather have a memorable car crash during Eurovision than a nice enough but boring entry

**welcome2thejam** (6): Just lacked the oomph or power needed, especially the instrumental. Giving an extra point cause the recording is solid, but unfortunately I don't think it translated well

**MoonlightByWindow** (5.5): this feels like a song that was very good for the time but now i’m just kinda bored

**seanderlust** (5.4): the live performance of this.....charlie do something!!!

**Awkward\_King** (5): i rly like the idea of this song but i am mid on the actual song but go girl

**CrimsonROSET** (5): I’ll be honest this one was just inoffensive

**frogaranaman** (5): light type decision - probably LED

**thedoublebanana** (5): Another overhyped song that doesn't deliver.

**thisusernameisntlong** (4.5): boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): Spotify playlist fodder

**hannahspants** (4): this song bores me but I don't hate it

**jaztinax** (4): a little forgettable

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): pretty forgettable

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Can someone wake her up please

**Uberpigeon** (3.5): yess girl give us nothing

**apatel27** (3): This is just All I Want - Kodaline but boring

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this has gayle energy

**moonagenightmares** (3): so many boring songs in a row im dying

**LunaMoonMeUp** (2): She sounds bored singing it, and I'm bored listening. The song itself is drab, and she has the stage presence of a corpse.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): This girl really had the audacity to stay on the same note for 3 minutes. This is what Lana’s singing sounds like to haters

**flavasavavandal** (1): imagine getting to one of the biggest stages in Europe and you make the bold choice to not emote during your performance

**MrSwearword** (1): I had forgotten about this one and once I heard every incorrect/offkey note in that lower register...triggered all over again.
