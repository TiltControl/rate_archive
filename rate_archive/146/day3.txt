**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): SUCH a fun song! It's rare for songs in Eurovision to achieve that perfect mix between silly and serious, but this song pulls it off amazingly. Using a jolly upbeat instrumental and staging including the performers wearing kilts and playfully fighting on stage to mask its lyrics referring to the Greek economic crisis makes this easily one of my favorite songs in the rate, and I'm pleasantly surprised this *just* managed to sneak into Day 3.

**racloves** (6.5): now if the alcohol is free, this is the party for everybody

---

**Awkward\_King** (10): thinking abt how before i knew i was gay when i would rewatch this performance for the male singers

**CarlieScion** (10): social and political commentary in a song that bops this hard? Slay

**veryanniev** (10): anyone who gives it lower than 8 is a miserable bitch

**you2009** (10): jyp would jump on this completely unironically

**ZebraSun73** (10): If a song sounds like it would be great to get drunk on rakija/ouzu to it's a good song. So obviously this is a 10

**afs** (9.5): wine mom anthem

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): greece please send more song like this

**apatel27** (9): 🕺

**bigbigbee** (9): Now I understand why We Are Number One banged so hard…it was written by Europeans

**CrimsonROSET** (9): showtune (compliment)

**emmaelf** (9): am i meant to believe they were playing the instruments while dancing around? i like the traditional greek music in the background and alcohol being free is at least compelling subject material.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): come on, lazytown soundtrack!

**moonagenightmares** (9): memes aside this is a bop

**nootnoot781** (9): i wish

**nt96** (9): Cafe Tacvba but make it Russian

**skargardin** (9): YAS

**welcome2thejam** (9): Hot damn, we got ska in the building?

**awkward\_penguin** (8.8): Social commenary disguised as a folk party song? Take my points.

**thedoublebanana** (8.2): RIP Agathon. Legend of Greek music and legend of the eurovision stage.

**iniekcja\_** (8): grandpa outperforming them

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): A lot of Eurovision purists and the casual public all like to dismiss songs for being on the sillier side. But there's absolutely nothing wrong with having fun, and Greece brought the party with this song.

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): this is iconic. so is his tiny guitar. also this sounds like that one lazytown song i forget the name of

**s2pd** (8): One of those reasons to love Eurovision

**throwaway-7650** (8): and the JYP jumpscare?

**whatyourheartdesires** (8): iconic

**celladonn** (7.5): we love greek folk ska punk but I think the chorus here is pretty weak

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): free alcohol???? In this economy?

**TiltControls** (7.5): chaotic camp

**criestotheclicking** (7): this is also just fun and all the performers gel really well. Rest in Peace Agathon :(

**Kaylaboe** (7): fun

**MrSwearword** (7): it's less a song and more of a kii moment in Eurovision trolling history.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I do love free alcohol

**DefaultPophead** (6.9): I don't drink, sorry.

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): me when i rob a liquor store idk

**frogaranaman** (5): this statement is true if you act like enough of a slut at the bars (aka me last weekend)

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): End drinking culture. I want to be sober.

**vayyiqra** (5): Any other oldheads remember the fad for ska-punk in the mid-2000s because this is weirdly reminding me of that blursed era despite being a bunch of Greek dudes.

**guy\_like\_u** (3): I wish I liked this more than I do

**Martin1009** (2.5): don't get the hype at all

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): Honestly I thought this would end up even higher than it did! Only Teardrops is one of the most beloved winners among the fandom, it's just so pretty and peaceful to listen to, and who can say no to that flute? A well deserved Day 3 placement.

**racloves** (7): Really love this song! Honestly thought it might have done a bit better than 19th place

---

# No tears left to cry

**speaknowred** (11): The score should say it all I love it

**Awkward\_King** (10): the grip this song had on 10 year old me

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh god I forgot there were good songs in this rate

**GapeCod** (10): Amazing as long as you take the lyrics in the context of a broken relationship and not... international conflicts, like I've seen some people claim. ☠ Imagine if she had won with this in Israel...

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): she gets it

**shhhneak** (10): Invented cottagecore.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): i’m a sucker for flute in songs honestly

**skargardin** (10): we love the flute!!

**afs** (9): so many of the Eurovision songs would've been adored by popheads if they were sung by Carly

**awkward\_penguin** (9): Simple and yet so effective. Love the flute, snare drums, Emmelie's dress, and her singing.

**BebeLuigi** (9): An amazing winner, it feels so eurovision but in all the best ways you know.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (9): a much better version of Alexander Rybak's Fairytale.

**guy\_like\_u** (9): An incredible chorus, a simple flute / drum cameo, well sung. Everything a Eurovision song should be

**happyletuce06** (9): charming, makes me want to commence a revolution while barefoot

**iniekcja\_** (9): a perfectly inoffensive winner

**itsabop** (9): She's a queen

**nootnoot781** (9): ellie goulding from wish i mean denmark

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): I predicted this would win and it did. Proving my family wrong. This is my claim to fame. It’s a great song though ❤️ fr

**RoyalBloodFool** (9): I love how she pronounce "s"

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): the flute went hard

**throwaway-7650** (9): yet another TLOZ-coded song, I lauv it

**whatyourheartdesires** (9): lush

**daretheghost** (8.5): The 2013 contest was the first one I was actively aware of, meaning I read through Oh No They Didn’ts live thread and I remember thinking positively of this song. I kind of like it less as time has passed but it at least feels more like a Eurovision Winner than… some other songs.

**thedoublebanana** (8.4): I can't deny this is a great song. I don't love her voice, but the song goes off.

**criestotheclicking** (8): another underrated entry - I feel the Danes never quite get their plaudits (unless the Dane is called Leonara)

**s2pd** (8): Love the flute

**vayyiqra** (8): This song is "ethnopop" I learned a new word

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): such a good bop, but also maybe the most forgettable winner post-2005?

**emmaelf** (7.5): the flutes are back! it's good, i like it, i just feel like eurovision lost its spark for a while after 2012. this could have been sung by katy perry and put on mtv. which isn't a bad thing, just not what i go to eurovision for.

**apatel27** (7): It's cute

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): this song and performance is somehow both giving Ellie Goulding and Les Miserables

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): this brand of nostalgic pop just hits

# Only teardrops indeed

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): Shakira, but make her white

**DefaultPophead** (6.4): This is great and all, but I'd prefer just watching the guy woodwind/percussion guy the whole time.

**flavasavavandal** (6): what a waste of a flute, Lizzo would be ashamed

**hannahspants** (6): actually used to like this song but it's annoyed me as time goes on

**Kaylaboe** (6): it's not a bad song it's just if you made an AI make a song with every eurovision cliché in existence and you get this

**LunaMoonMeUp** (6): Of the more forgettable winners of late, but it's still okay.

**Martin1009** (6): just fine

**Melody** (6): Taylor???

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Kinda boring

**thedoctordances1940** (5.6): i will admit there are some really nice melodies here which stop me from tanking it but ou that instrumental

**frogaranaman** (5): maybe this one can stay region locked

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): boring

**akanewasright** (4): this sounds like Shakira if she was boring

**CarlieScion** (4): a very boring song

**ImADudeDuh** (3.5): mom can we have Pixar’s Brave (2012)’s smash hit ‘Touch The Sky’? “We have Pixar’s Brave (2012)’s smash hit ‘Touch The Sky’ at home” Pixar’s Brave (2012)’s smash hit ‘Touch The Sky’ at home:

**MrSwearword** (3): Mediocre but still weirdly unpleasant (and this robbed I Feed You My Love)

**moonagenightmares** (2): still hate this

**Imtotallyfine.jpg** (0): I think this is a decent song?? But I just really really don’t like it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Now isn't this song just adorable? Russian grandmas singing about how excited they are to see their grandkids and bake them cookies is quite possibly the sweetest concept for a song ever, and I'm so glad something like this exists. And I'm glad this managed to make day 3 as well! Obviously this is far from being the most conventional song in the rate, and yeah this is technically a joke entry, but when a song is this fun, do you even care?

**racloves** (3): this is not a party for everybody, this is a party I will not be attending.

---
# Come on and dance!
**astrologicalangel** (10): I love the babushki 🥲

**CarlieScion** (10): so close to getting my 11

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): If this won over Euphoria I couldn’t be mad

**DefaultPophead** (10): I wish I got to know my grandparents!

**GapeCod** (10): Curious to see how low/high the controversy score for this one will get.

**iniekcja\_** (10): is this where all the grandmas on the bus are always going

**MrSwearword** (10): if only because Russian grandmas making cookies on stage was one of the best gimmicks to have actually been pulled off.

**noideawhatever** (10): absolutely precious grandmas <3 and the song is also really good!

**seanderlust** (10): okay wait these lyrics are apparently really cute. we stan being excited your kids are coming to visit you

**skargardin** (10): it doesn't get more iconic than this honestly

**Smuckles** (10): Oh hell yeah, now we're talking. This is what my nightmares sound like, 10/10

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is pure gold

**throwaway-7650** (10): :noitsgrandma: (need nitro)

**Uberpigeon** (10): hi niki girl i just saw niki

**veryanniev** (10): I knew I’d give it a ten because as a Russian I firmly believe that Buranovskiye Babushki and Manizha are the only worthy contestants Russia had sent to Eurovision in the 21st century (authenticity and non-English songs are a rarity for us, also Babushki are singing in Udmurt, an ethnic minority’s language) but I wasn’t prepared to get so fucking sad when I put the YouTube video on. The only thing I can think of while watching it now is how many babushkas like these live in absolute fucking poverty while the Russian government spends all the money on military and themselves, robbing the population of absolutely everything. This is a government that suddenly remembers that veterans exist on Victory Day, while those veterans have no money to afford basic human necessities. There is a charity fund called [A veteran’s dream](https://мечтаветерана.рф/nashi-veterany/) where the veterans dream of a hearing aid, of new walkers, of a wheelchair, of WATER system in their house, of GAS in their house and so on. I hate this fucking government so much because instead of raising the pension funds and fixing the poorer parts of the country they decide to commit genocide of Ukrainians. Also the fact that the original members of Buranovskiye Babushki cannot perform under that name anymore because of their ex-producer who simply replaced them makes my blood boil.

**you2009** (10): when sistar reunite and they see ive in the starship hallways

**shhhneak** (9.8): All of these women are dead (probably)

**emmaelf** (9.5): a true eurovision song. memeable but so wholesome. and nobody can say it's boring. i want them to bake me cookies.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.2): russian granny supremacy

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): tbh if this didn't have video I'd believe this was in the nier automata soundtrack

**akanewasright** (9): holy fuck this is iconic

**ashandimlotion** (9): the last good entry from Russia before they did The Bad Thing

**cremeebrulee** (9): they said gate’s wide open come on in!!!!

**criestotheclicking** (9): contemplated giving the sweet ol grannies my 11. This is just sweet and fun.

**hannahspants** (9): if you aren't touched by a bunch of babushkas baking on stage then get out

**Stryxen** (9): the way they’re so quiet in the mix in the performance, this is shoegaze

**afs** (8.5): CAAAAAMPPPPPPP

**celladonn** (8.5): they served cunt

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): i started laughing when i saw them. icons

**jaztinax** (8.5): russian grandmas for life <3

**speaknowred** (8.4): Fun!

**2dina3dworld** (8): This randomly clicked one day. Originally I thought I should be nice because it feels mean to tank a bunch of grandmas singing about having fun with their family but I still gave it a 4. Turns out it’s a grower

**apatel27** (8): It's voter bait but it's good bait

**guy\_like\_u** (8): I unironically adore this song and this performance. I won’t hear a bad word against this

**nt96** (8): a song that your grandmas can shlyukha drop to

**plastichaxan** (8): camp

**welcome2thejam** (8): You see that smoke coming out of the structure behind them? I know they got the good stuff

**fadedblue09** (7.5): i appreciate the uniqueness

**itsabop** (7.5): How can you hate this! These sweet grannies

**moonagenightmares** (7.5): my russian grandma wasnt this fun :/

**pleasegivemeasword** (7.5): turn it up grandmas!!!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): I’m assuming these are little old ladies from the album cover, and they killed it ngl

**CrimsonROSET** (7): as opposed to what the rest of popheads will say I am very pro-polka

**Kaylaboe** (7): they got their bread on stage

**Martin1009** (7): who cares about war crimes when you have cute grandmas?

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): they should bake Putin some poisoned bread. I think they could pull it off, more efficient than the CIA

**s2pd** (7): Adorable grandma's

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I can’t hate this. They’re singing babushkas!! Singing about their family!!

**whatyourheartdesires** (7): gimmick but it was funny

**awkward\_penguin** (6.5): While not the most interesting song or production, this song has RUSSIAN GRANDMAS DANCING ON STAGE. And that's enough to entertain me.

# People who hate fun

**daretheghost** (6): I can never take this one seriously but it does kind of go off.

**Melody** (6): nice grannies but this song is like burnt sugar.

**vayyiqra** (6): this is too ridiculous to take seriously but it is cool the lyrics are in Udmurt a language almost nobody has ever heard of outside of Russia

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): yeah ok this isn't actually a good song is it 😵

**bigbigbee** (5): I don’t know why other funny campy songs work for me but this one doesn’t

**happyletuce06** (5): ehhh good on them for showcasing a minority language

**LunaMoonMeUp** (5): If you ever want an argument as to why we need juries at Eurovision, just remember Sweden only beat this song by 11 points in the televote. Do you want to live in a world where this, albeit fun but ultimately shallow, entry wins over Euphoria?

**MoonlightByWindow** (5): i literally have no clue how to rate this but for some reason i got emotional watching the performance SDFKSJK

**thedoublebanana** (5): This is another example where the performance is why the song did so well.

**Awkward\_King** (4): need to keep up my ageist persona sorry

**berober04** (4): appreciate the hustle, mind

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): *laughs nervously* what the fuck

**lost-ln-the-echo** (3): these old ladies cannot sing sorry

**TiltControls** (3): the anti-carly

**frogaranaman** (1): this is a bit of a meme but it is also Terrible

**BebeLuigi** (0): I get that it's supposed to be fun or whatever but this is neither fun neither enjoyable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): We did it folks! Balladphobia is no more! And thank goodness it didn't strike this one, because this song is just *stunning*. For such a conceptually simple song, Barbara absolute sells this with her voice and drama, with the staging being so simple yet so effective at emphasizing her voice. Eurovision fans often joke around that this is "the franceiest song to ever france" but despite how sterotypical it may be, it still manages to be something unique that I've never heard before.

**racloves** (9): big lesbian vibes im a fan

---
# Voilà!

**1998tweety** (10): french always serves

**MrSwearword** (10): about damn time France was truly captivating in a final.

**noideawhatever** (10): i'm a sucker for a waltz and that build up at the end was amazing

**seanderlust** (10): this is so good!! the urgency barbara deals these lyrics with absolutely adds to the atmosphere of the song. you can feel the heartbreak through any language barrier

**skargardin** (10): this absolute vocal serve

**TiltControls** (10): en francais

**welcome2thejam** (10): Forget Eurovision, someone was shooting for film/TV awards for that one. Felt like watching a short film about a song contest entry and not an actual entrant.

**you2009** (10): french people getting too many wins from me in this rate just another reason we need reparations right NOW

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Barbara REALLY sells this song her performance is everything

**speaknowred** (9.2): Stunning

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): The frenchiest french song to ever french the Eurovision stage. Barbara is a magnetic performer and was just incredible.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): honestly would have been happy for this to win in a competition where there was no måneskin but unfortunately they slightly outserved

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): she is everything!!!! I have nothing else to say

**Stryxen** (9): cunty in the dictionary:

**afs** (8.5): sheesh I thought this was Christine at first

**daretheghost** (8.5): I can hardly think of a Frencher song.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): sad montage music (compliment)

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): this kinda succeeds where other songs in this rate fail

**happyletuce06** (8): i respect it more than i like it

**throwaway-7650** (8): did everyone see *that* scene in viola davis' new film?

**shhhneak** (7.7): I Survived The Great Eurovision Cocainegate And All I Got Was This Song Almost Winning By Disqualification.

**apatel27** (7.5): Great singing but what is this wannabe arthouse camera work

**Kaylaboe** (7): thank god this didn't win the french would've been insufferable

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): half my comments here are just "ok go off [nationality] [vague look alike]" so lemme finish off my ballot with one more: go off french alice cullen

**guy\_like\_u** (6.5): Even more French than I thought was possible

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): she ate… croissants

**Martin1009** (6.5): jury-bait

# Maybe balladphobia isn't over yet

**CarlieScion** (6): mcnuke ballads

**DefaultPophead** (5.8): This is normally 100% my thing, but something about it just puts me off. Not everything can click, but it kinda just feels like the Eurovision equivalent of Oscar bait.

**frogaranaman** (5): I didn't bother looking up the translation since I'm running behind on my ballot but I feel like she's talking shit and I respect that

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): ironically didn’t really have a voila moment for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I thought this was just what like 80% of French songs sound like

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): the p in edith piaf stands for pussy

**s2pd** (4): Mega annoying

**vayyiqra** (4): This kind of goes nowhere and I'm not into this genre (chanson). I've tried it before, it just isn't for me.

**BebeLuigi** (3): The only time recently my country came close to winning and I don't care for the song dqsfsdf

**moonagenightmares** (3): francophobia is valid

**LesApfels** (0): This is payback for all the stress it caused me last year

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Another song that I'm SHOCKED didn't make it even higher than it did. Outside of maybe Euphoria and Dancing Lasha Tumbai, Fairytale remains the most beloved Eurovision song of all time, and still holds the record to this day of the biggest landslide victory in the contest's history, it doesn't get more iconic than that! This was by far the most controversial song to make it into day 3, and even picked up quite a few 0s! Maybe Alexander Rybak really *is* cursed...

---
# Fairytale

**CaptainDaisyG** (11): This is the most iconic Eurovision song tbh

**exciting\_patient4872** (11): His stage presence is unparalleled.

**jaztinax** (11): this changed eurovision and my love for eurovision and ignited a patriotism in me that i didn’t know i had. like, he was crowned the winner at midnight on norway’s constitution day, it literally couldn’t get better. I have so many stories about me and alexander rybak but i won’t get into that here

**ashandimlotion** (10): maybe the best song a man has ever recorded

**CarlieScion** (10): a true ‘landeplage’ as we call them here

**celladonn** (10): an 11 contender tbh

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): A POTENTIAL 11. The drama! The cheesiness! The jig energy of that beat! The violin!!! Alexander you will always be famous!!!

**GapeCod** (10): asiodfjkl;asdlfk;asdfj;lakjsdkgj;oailjskd/kg;oaijlksdgaskj;lgda;ilskd;/f.d;alk why is this song still so sweet 13 years down the line, the landslide was JUSTIFIED!!!

**guy\_like\_u** (10): iconic. A great song and a unique performance

**happyletuce06** (10): one of the most iconic winners ever, the violin drop goes HARD

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this became a tiktok hit for a reason

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): an 11 contender. he absolutely ate down and didn’t leave a single crumb

**noideawhatever** (10): ok i just gave three 10's in a row. this is getting real good now

**nootnoot781** (10): 2009 is the strongest year in eurovision’s history, so for this to win just tells you how fucking iconic this entry is.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): there’s not much to say. One of the best songs ever. First time I heard it I fell in love. It’s the first song I play for people when showing them Eurovision. Redefined Eurovision, along with many others that year

**RandomHypnotica** (10): singlehandedly raised a new generation of violinists

**skargardin** (10): I fear that it still absolutely slaps

**Stryxen** (10): i forgot how much i love this… and also how hot he is… this performance is so sex

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I want Alexander Rybak to play me like a violin with the three men in the back watching us while doing pushups

**throwaway-7650** (10): violin *and* incorporated well? I have to stan

**welcome2thejam** (10): Started out like any other ordinary song, but then it went on a true hero's journey to return with this score

**speaknowred** (9.8): The violin and the acrobats full of stamina ate

**DefaultPophead** (9.7): This gives me "Kevin, your dog just died" vibes.

**moonagenightmares** (9.7): i was going to say this is slightly overrated but my god that violin solo slays so much

**babadork** (9.3): I probably added a full point for how cute and smiley Alexander Rybak is, but I refuse to feel guilty about it.

**itsabop** (9.3): One of the most iconic Eurovision winners for a reason

**akanewasright** (9): what a damn serve

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): There's just no denying how well Alexander Rybak let Europe have it that evening. Iconic for all the right reasons.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): No I'm not giving this song a high score cause he's cute…… okay maybe a little. But also it's actually a really good song!

**whatyourheartdesires** (9): my grandma loves him and this song is really cute and fun

**you2009** (9): doing JUST the right amount

**awkward\_penguin** (8.8): Solid pop with some folk and violin. The staging is a bit weird, but maybe there's no need to ask why there are athletic guys flipping around the stage - just accept it. And the chorus is RIDICULOUSLY catchy.

**afs** (8.5): wait I thought Norway made death metal

**daretheghost** (8.5): Rybak is so smarmy and corny but the song’s a fun concept.

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): is this Matthew Gray Gubler

**cremeebrulee** (8): girl this is cute fuck u rona

**hannahspants** (8): its kinda a bad song, but damn do I love a good violin. Also it's a fantastic performance.

**iniekcja\_** (8): NO CAUSE I WAS GONNA SAY A DIFFERENT THING BUT WHY DID HE SMELL HER LIKE THAT AT THE END

**Martin1009** (8): kiiiinda overrated winner but still good

**Melody** (8): He kinda looks like Primark Justin Bieber without the blond!

**moooo566** (8): im not as keen on it as a lot of eurovision seems to be but its still rad

**musical\_pyn** (8): the dancing men deserve an 11 though

**seanderlust** (8): [Violin Solo]

**veryanniev** (8): 2009 Eurovision was the first Eurovision I ever saw live, so I simply cannot ignore the pure nostalgia of it all. The iron GRIP Rybak had on my 12-year-old female classmates is unimaginable. They had textbooks with his face on it.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): yeah idk tbh

**emmaelf** (7.5): if this isn't added to a disney movie, gyrating push up men and all, it's a wasted chance.

**criestotheclicking** (7): He isn't even that good at singing live but he is very charming and the chorus is catchy. I’m also obsessed with his dancers.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I knew about this one from before actually because a friend liked it… personally I find it a bit overhyped, the chorus is a bit annoying, but I get it I guess.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the lyrics suck but you know what, he delivered them.

**Imtotallyfine.jpg** (7): I actually still don’t know if I really like this song or not.

**sirpancakeXI** (7): my hatred toward his entry in 2018 make me unable to enjoy this song fully

**LesApfels** (6.5): Obsessed with him having to pretend-play violin the whole time

**apatel27** (6): Why does this remind me so much of Vitas - Opera2
# Nightmare


**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): I've always thought this song was massively overrated and re-visiting it has confirmed this for me. I just really dislike his voice?? And the lyrics are a bit too on the nose

**s2pd** (5): Hard to listen to because it's so pitchy. The song itself has potential

**shhhneak** (5): Violin dancing is so 2009.

**Smuckles** (5): Is this twee?

**vayyiqra** (5): damn bro that sucks

**2dina3dworld** (3): you’re in love with a fairytale? Well I’m in love with your mum, and she’s in love with me. You’re gonna have to call me dad now, sorry kid.

**Awkward\_King** (3): was this a cultural reset? yes. is it grating and does he sound off key? yes. however he can fuck me.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (3): I remember this song like it was yesterday. Everybody loved it and I hated it. The violins are nice, but the guy's voice is just unacceptable. Still sucks today too.

**Kaylaboe** (3): being norwegian this was completely inescapable for a summer and everytime i hear that opening violin i combust into three million pieces

**BebeLuigi** (2): 2009 is the first year I watched and I was baffled back then that it won...

**fadedblue09** (2): His backups ate him up

**Uberpigeon** (2): im going to go meet my norwegian friend in june but after this i dont think i will

**frogaranaman** (1): I wanted to hear about Hansel and Gretel

**CrimsonROSET** (0): you’re telling me this won? With the biggest landslide ever? And they didn’t cancel the competition afterwards? brave

**MrSwearword** (0): Easily one of the worst songs in the history of recorded music and such a dreadful live vocal. Also, Malena Ernman, sweetie I am so sorry.

**thedoublebanana** (0): This song actually makes me nauseous when I listen to it. I am not exaggerating when I say that I have thrown up when I've been forced to listen to it. I don't know why it triggers me so much. But yea, if I cannot listen to a song without feeling physically ill, that's a 0 for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Lordi in Day 3? Of MY popheads rate? Color me pleasantly surprised! Even before I became a huge Eurovision fan, I was always aware of just how *iconic* Lordi's win was, and it still remains a banger 16 years later! Finland has tried numerous times since 2006 to send another metal band to replicate their success, but nothing has come close to the original metal overlords of Eurovision.

**racloves** (6): I don’t like metal music, but I can vibe to this, obviously it is iconic in esc history

---

# Hallelujah

**apatel27** (11): It's Camp

**berober04** (11): this is still in my opinion the most exciting event that happened with Eurovision. Pure metal camp and glorious performance, rock on!

**CarlieScion** (11): honestly what more do u need in an Eurovision performance than 5 men dressed up in monster costumes singing a heavy metal song

**moooo566** (11): young me had never seen anything nearly as cool or as stupid as this, i think it legitimately changed me. it was the first metal track i ever downloaded, and it's still in rotation because it owns.

**2dina3dworld** (10): giving this a 10 makes me feel out of touch with what’s cool, but ah well. It fucks

**celladonn** (10): Now this was beyond iconic

**daretheghost** (10): My boyfriend is a Eurovision die-hard and when we started dating he sat me down and had me watch the contests starting from 2005 and I was immediately drawn to this song because of the sheer WTF spectacle of a bunch of monsters performing in the middle of Eurovision. So I looked Lordi up on Wikipedia to learn more and immediately spoiled the 2006 results for myself. I am never not charmed by Lordi.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (10): this was such a serve. Still unmatched.

**emmaelf** (10): now this one i remember from the time. the costumes are fantastic but it's also just genuinely a great rock song. this one is remembered for a reason.

**GapeCod** (10): this score is in solidarity with /u/skargardin

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the outfits are camp

**MrSwearword** (10): we need more tacky campy metal

**noideawhatever** (10): this is extremely finnish lmao. and it's absolutely amazing, a deserved winner.

**nootnoot781** (10): it’s such a what the fuck entry i can’t not stan.

**skargardin** (10): please be kind to this :pleading:

**Smuckles** (10): Of course I have to give this a 10. A landmark moment for Eurovision where everyone could come together and say 'hey, that was fun!'. Bless 'em, ignore the Poison comparisons.

**thedoctordances1940** (10): yeah the song is kinda basic and mid but like also how can i not give this a 10

**welcome2thejam** (10): I see a few exposed ribcages in the band. Is this the famous Ribs by Lordi I hear so often about?

**ZebraSun73** (10): Still gutted that I didn't go see their gig because my friends would rather study for our maths finals... sort out your priorities seriously.

**shhhneak** (9.4): So camp it’s the whole circus.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): this absolute essential eurovision classic better not be underappreciated

**akanewasright** (9): they put their whole gussies (goblin pussies) into this one

**Awkward\_King** (9): this isnt just iconic and memorable its also like legitimately a bop

**happyletuce06** (9): i could headbang to it all day!

**iniekcja\_** (9): omg Lorde

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): I love what this victory stands for, I love the costumes, and it's performed well. There's nothing not to love here.

**speaknowred** (9): No words.

**afs** (8.5): I miss Face Off

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): Nightwish outsold these hacks

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait this won??????? I mean work but wow did I not expect that

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): GWAR outsold

**jaztinax** (8): how can you not like this

**Martin1009** (8): Yassified rock

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): ICONIC, no other words

**thedoublebanana** (8): I was NOT a fan of this in 2006, but since them I am appreciating the campiness of this more and more! It helps that my boyfriend really loves this one.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is very stupid and I love it very much

**DefaultPophead** (7.9): I want to be in the band. Maybe not if that keyboardist stays, actually. He creeps me out.

**s2pd** (7.5): My favourite moment is the keyboardist's AAAAAAAAAAA

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): this is just a Tenacious D song

**whatyourheartdesires** (7.5): their win was very refreshing for Eurovision

**ashandimlotion** (7): classic great staging and performance with an average song. Hard to imagine a world in which Hari Mata Hari doesn’t take it in a jury/televote system, and I prefer that but neither are Silvia Night soooo....

**astrologicalangel** (7): the background singer has a better voice than the lead tbh

**BebeLuigi** (7): It's a great winner really, it's still so iconic ugh

**Kaylaboe** (7): i remember not being allowed to watch their performance bc my parents thought they were satanic

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): finland was at her lowest…fat, nasty, and broke. eurovision career in shambles. she came on this bitch mad as hell!!!!

**nt96** (7): Popheads gonna kill this with a hard rock, that’s for sure

**pleasegivemeasword** (7): extra points for the makeup and staging alone holy shit

**veryanniev** (7): 7 for the pure randomness of it all

**moonagenightmares** (6.3): i remember wanting this to win when i was like 7 lol

**babadork** (6.2): Just thought everyone should know that one of their albums is titled Sexorcism

# Atheists

**hannahspants** (6): look I want to like it because yay monsters but the songs just not great. Extra points because the performance is good.

**LesApfels** (6): The wings rising up were cool I'll give them that

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): the looks and the performance are iconic but I wish the song was also good :(

**TiltControls** (6): who let middle earth into eurovision

**awkward\_penguin** (5.5): A forgettable song that was made memorable by its performance and staging. Love that it brought something different to Eurovision, but as someone who listens to metal, musically, it could be much, much better.

**DirtyRat583** (5.1): dont care for the music but the performance is cool. i hope babe had throat lozenges backstage because it sounds like it would hurt doing that voice

**ignitethephoenix** (5): this is so jarring after listening to a bunch of fun bops 💀

**itsabop** (5): I can see why this won and I admire it but it's not a high scorer for me

**Stryxen** (5): i don’t know how i genuinely have 0 opinion on this. it’s a song that won eurovision, i’m listening to this song that won eurovision in 2006. They’re wearing silly costumes, this is like a drag race talent show that gets them safe that week

**you2009** (5): very excellent costuming even if I don't like the song I just can't imagine how long it must've taken to do it for every single performance

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): it's kind of unpleasant but I don't hate it so

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): this is a setup :sob:

**fadedblue09** (3): I admire the stage production value but it's not my thing

**guy\_like\_u** (3): like… I get it, and I see why it won, but it just does nothing for me sorry

**plastichaxan** (3): maybe if lorde did this instead of solar power

**Uberpigeon** (3): they struck me down like lightning lightning

**vayyiqra** (2): Not to be malevoicephobic but I encourage it toward this guy's voice in particular + this kind of cheesy metal should have been left back in 1981.

**seanderlust** (1.5): you know those tiktoks that are like "gay people when the worst song you've ever heard comes on"? this is the straight version of that

**frogaranaman** (1): bro💀

---

**criestotheclicking** (10): this is far better than discotheque and I wish this is the song that got more recognition. If it wasn’t a bonus track it’d get my 11.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): should’ve won, a bop from the first moment. They need to come back a third time and win. I’ll pay for it

**daretheghost** (9): This took a while to grow on me and I’m glad it did because it’s super fun.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): The chorus saved this

**happyletuce06** (9): robbed of their win

**iniekcja\_** (9): i don't know if i like it better than discoteque

**Kaylaboe** (9): slay. slay

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): Yet another really fun and quirky electronic song, The Roop really knocked it out of the park with this one.

**speaknowred** (9): Love them so much

**DefaultPophead** (8.7): I wish my body was as malleable as his.

**s2pd** (8.5): So much fun

**nootnoot781** (8): so much better than discoteque

**RandomHypnotica** (8): the ideal combo would be their 2021 song with this dancing

**throwaway-7650** (8): omfg fucking FINALLY a bald man is slaying for ONCE

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): im not sure he realizes its not 2006… but he looks like hes having fun so good for him

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): this probably would’ve done better than discotheque

**TiltControls** (7.5): this sounds like it'd fit perfectly with the rest of the 'indie songs made for commercials'

**seanderlust** (7): he said "let's ride" charli xcx stan confirmed

**Martin1009** (6.5): Would not have done as well as people thought sorryyyy

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): they deserved top 5 in 2021 with discoteque tbh

**akanewasright** (6): pretty neat

**thedoublebanana** (6): I honestly didn't care for the Roop that much in 2020, but I enjoyed their 2021 song better.

**vayyiqra** (6): not bad but songwriters of the world please stop rhyming fire with desire I beg you

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): All the hooks in this are annoying

**DirtyRat583** (5): heard this many times before

**hannahspants** (5): honestly can't figure out how I feel about this one so I'm just smacking it in the middle

**Smuckles** (4): I'm sorry to the host in advance due to the amount of 'The roop is on fire' jokes they're going to get

**Stryxen** (4): lithua-naurrr

**thedoctordances1940** (1): ou this is very very very very not good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Quite possibly my favorite winning song of all time. I'm honestly blown away by this song and its performance every time I watch it. The sheer passion and emotion Marija puts in this performance, the poeticness of the lyrics, the way such an explicitly lesbian song was able to win the competition, even when her competition was Verka fucking Serducka...an absolutely legendary moment in Eurovision.

**racloves** (9): Hello fellow popheads lesbians

---
# Let's go lesbians!
**veryanniev** (11): I feel like somehow this song became quite underrated and it physically hurts me. Sometimes I catch myself thinking it might be my favourite winner song ever. It’s such a powerful performance and if I dare to rewatch it I cry every time.

**iniekcja\_** (10): an immaculate song

**moonagenightmares** (10): the winner this year being an emo lesbian while second place was a glittery drag queen is so iconic and just so eurovision

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): little-known fact but marija šerifonić was actually the person who invented lesbian feminism

**MrSwearword** (10): A lot of us looked at this song title and heard the note. You know full and good goddamn well which moment I'm talking about.

**nootnoot781** (10): one of the most powerful winners of all time. expecting popheads to do this dirty :(

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): This is so angelic.

**throwaway-7650** (10): absolutely elevated by the performance, 11 tbh

**you2009** (10): lesbian harem anime realness

**ZebraSun73** (10): This is the best ballad that has ever competed in Eurovision and my other 11 condender. Majestic. Devastating. Powerful. Iconic.

**speaknowred** (9.9): WOW

**babadork** (9.6): I admit to being balladphobic, but that might change if they all recruited their backup singers from Beverly Goldberg’s lesbian cult.

**jaztinax** (9.5): i didn’t understand this song when i was 10 and my friend and i used to call her the “caviar lady” because it sounded like she said the word “caviar” in the chorus. and i apologize for not realizing what a beautiful song and a beautiful person marija was until recently

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): (ignoring the spelling mistake) WOW. WOW

**awkward\_penguin** (9.3): Gorgeously sung, simply yet effectively staged, and transmits so much emotion even though most listeners don't know the language.

**sirpancakeXI** (9.2): this is so gorgeous

**CarlieScion** (9): so dramatic and for WHAT

**criestotheclicking** (9): great ballad, awesome staging and vibe.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh you know I love a build up to a choir

**daretheghost** (9): I think this one gets overlooked a lot when people talk about Eurovision winners, in favor of the flashier winners.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): I miss dramatic ballads I watched the first 3 seasons of American Idol as a tween I’m here for this

**fadedblue09** (9): this was lovely

**itsabop** (9): An absolutely gorgeous song

**noideawhatever** (9): i'm not the biggest fan of ballads in eurovision, but this is really beautiful

**skargardin** (9): this serve!

**thedoublebanana** (9): I was shocked when this won. But since then, I have come to appreciate this and I belt it in my car any time it comes up on shuffle.

**TiltControls** (9): hmmm maybe slower songs can be good

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Queen

**shhhneak** (8.7): Obsessed with every hair style here.

**afs** (8.5): molitVOCALS

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): video game music vibes

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): when they all sing together >>>

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): stunning yes, but it's no verka serduchka

**apatel27** (8): Same energy as someone nominating Carly for the Charity Rate

**cremeebrulee** (8): kurp said this was sapphic and we love that

**DefaultPophead** (8): Holy hell, go off Marija!

**hannahspants** (8): extra points for extreme sapphic vibes

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): The song on its own does little for me. But that performance is amongst the all time greats on Eurovision, some of the best vocals the stage has seen.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): she ate, no crumbs. I sing this when I want to feel like screaming at someone

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Good when the choir is singing with her but kinda boring for the rest of it

**happyletuce06** (7.5): dare i say it kinda overrated...

**s2pd** (7.5): Epic

**ashandimlotion** (7): the only Balkan ballad to win I think? And it isn’t the best one (Lejla outsold etc etc) but! 2006 was a lot stronger so I can respect this one’s win

**BebeLuigi** (7): It's a beautiful song, I just prefer a lot of entries in 2007 haha

**welcome2thejam** (7): Was tempted to write it off as okay ballad but a good voice, but once the backup singers come in, it goes off

# Popheads raters listening to Snail Mail:

**akanewasright** (6.7): performance and singer are insane, brilliant, talented etc, but the song itself is kinda mid for me.

**Stryxen** (6.5): it takes too long to get like really good

**whatyourheartdesires** (6.5): pretty but a bit forgettable for me

**Awkward\_King** (6): i think she might be gay

**celladonn** (6): Great voice but I'm too balladphobic for this

**emmaelf** (6): a non-english language winner, yay! just a bit boring.

**vayyiqra** (4): Slavic solidarity and all but this is trying too hard to be dramatic.

**thisusernameisntlong** (2.5): snooze

**thedoctordances1940** (2.3): who lets these kinds of songs do consistently well in eurovision

**Uberpigeon** (2): sue perkins i love your work

**frogaranaman** (1): why did this go absolutely nowhere

**guy\_like\_u** (0): one of the worst winners in history, even worse that it blocked Verka

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): FUCKING ROBBED BOTH IN THIS RATE AND IN ACTUAL EUROVISION!! This is SUCH a banger and I thought for sure popheads would eat this one up, most pop girls wish they could pull off a performance and song like this one. Early in the rate this wasn't even making Day 3 and I had NEVER been more appalled at a result in my life, so glad that Ani eventually pulled through though! And no, you're not mistaken, this is in fact the first Ukraine song to get eliminated, and it's STILL all the way up at number 13! If you ever need any confirmation Ukraine is the powerhouse of Eurovision, this rate proves it.

**racloves** (7): I’ll be shady, it deserved better

# Striking like thunder

**welcome2thejam** (11): This is legit giving me Persona 5 vibes I am only half joking

**2dina3dworld** (10): the live performance of this goes hard. When Ukraine goes hard, they bring the best of Eurovision

**akanewasright** (10): idk what the fuck this song is about but miss shady lady served here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This is what that Real Housewive Luann thinks she’s serving but Ani outsold heavily

**GapeCod** (10): if you read her name backwards you'll get the state MK lives in

**iniekcja\_** (10): the og yasgirlslay supreme

**noideawhatever** (10): no misses for ukraine so far. how can a country be so good at a song contest??? unbelievable

**nootnoot781** (10): just checked my shed and she’s still living there???? ani it’s been 14 years leave please

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I understand the lyrics less in this song than most others here, despite it being entirely in english

**daretheghost** (9): The GRIP Ukraine had on the contest in the late 2000s…

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This sounds like something by a Real Housewife, but like, with real vocals

**ignitethephoenix** (9): lyrics are kind of ridiculous but it slaps

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): Move over Eleni, here we have the OG robbed pop goddess serving you looks, moves, and a whole ass bop. Second place is an outrage.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): this lost to that boring guy? no taste

**thedoublebanana** (8.8): It's a fun song.

**afs** (8.5): ABBA sends their regards

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): yassification

**seanderlust** (8.5): I was going to make a rupaul joke because of the title but if ru made a song like this it would be the best song in her discog by a mile

**plastichaxan** (8.3): the shade the rusical print

**CrimsonROSET** (8): she said secret agent, she said dance, she said espionage on the discotheque

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): bop

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): this staging is so good

**No-Place-to-Go** (8): This was robbed of the win because a remotely attractive man from Russian buttoned open his shirt. Sigh.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): this production is so good 😲

**vayyiqra** (8): I remember one Popheads user who's now gone and was an Ani Lorak stan. Points were made!

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I guess it bops

**veryanniev** (8): Kirkorov is a demon and Ani Lorak is a Ukrainian siding with Russia but damn this song is good

**Stryxen** (7.8): it’s her https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ep50krvXMAEie0C.jpg

**happyletuce06** (7.5): again, she did everything she had to do and more

**awkward\_penguin** (7.1): Now THAT is some good staging. Vocals were shaky at times, but the choreography was A+, and the song isn't bad.

**BebeLuigi** (7): It was a really good performance

**emmaelf** (7): please free the men trapped in the box, they're not okay.

**Martin1009** (6): tbh qele qele was better

**s2pd** (6): Never got the hype

**Uberpigeon** (6): why is it called shady lady when theres nothing about being shady in it

**shhhneak** (5.7): She could do Secret Combination but Kalomira could NOT do Shady Lady

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): listen, I am the biggest Ukraine in Eurovision fan, but this song is pretty dreadful lollll great staging though!

**frogaranaman** (5): I mean this is fine ig?

**moonagenightmares** (5): it came and went

**MrSwearword** (5): I am aware that this is basically Ukraine's Dannii Minogue at the peak of her powers, but this is a case where the outfit and stage do the heavy lifting.

**musical\_pyn** (5): was going to give this a lower score but the chorus got stuck in my head so I'll give it some points

**hannahspants** (4): meh

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (4): not my type of music I get why it’s popular though

**racloves** (9): Just incredible. [insert chanting]


**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): The televoters have been vindicated! Spirit in the Sky is such a fun and silly bop that blew the audience away in 2019, but unfortunately the juries didn't feel the same, and this song still remains one of the biggest discrepancies between audience and jury taste. But I'm glad KEiiNO managed to get some love here! Including joiking in a pop song is probably something that had never been done before, I'm glad Eurovision managed to shed some light on such an underrated Norweigen music tradition. 

---
# Joiking enthusiasts 
**seanderlust** (11): you know that video of the guy being interviewed in a nightclub and he says he's terrified of osama bin laden and then the reporter tells him that bin laden is dead and he starts doing that weird high-knee clapping dance thing? that's how the build in this song makes me feel

**2dina3dworld** (10): CRYING SCREAMING THROWING UP MY FLATMATE USED TO LISTEN TO THIS IN THE CAR. This gets a ten purely on his behalf. It’s kinda good, actually

**GapeCod** (10): Fuck the juries.

**iniekcja\_** (10): eurovision at its finest

**jaztinax** (10): ROBBED ROBBED ROBBED I HATE JURY VOTES AND I HAVE SINCE IT WAS

**nootnoot781** (10): the juries unnecessarily slaughtered this but thank god it won the televote. it’s so infectious and the fact you can hear the audience belt the final chorus just shows how captivating this entry is.

**sirpancakeXI** (10): I physically can't comprehend how this is not even top 10 in jury voting

**skargardin** (10): oh god their massive robbery just came back to me

**veryanniev** (10): they were fucking robbed. this is the most Eurovision song that ever Eurovisioned

**DefaultPophead** (9.8): OMG it's the guys from Australia Decides 2022 that did the Kylie Minogue cover!!!

**ashandimlotion** (9.5): this is what Eurovision should be like from start to finish

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): what a fun mess, baldy carried

**you2009** (9.5): I'm in the crowd at an edm festival drinking water from a bottle being passed around catching mono

**afs** (9): this is so extra I love it

**CrimsonROSET** (9): ok but the chanting at the end served

**emmaelf** (9): feels like an algorithm attempt at creating a eurovision song based on what had worked over the past 5 years or so. it ends up better than some of the songs it riffs off, and the gimmick of three very different voices is still entertaining.

**speaknowred** (9): Robbed legends

**throwaway-7650** (9): baldies... I recommend a hair transplant specialist

**vayyiqra** (9): A yoik song ?! This is cool.

**whatyourheartdesires** (9): cheesy but very good

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): team bald guy

**s2pd** (8.5): I love every part of this

**apatel27** (8): Nothing against the song but the audience clapping definitely took away from the song. Clapping on every beat and louder on 1 & 3 is some white people nonesense

**criestotheclicking** (8): not as good as when I first heard it but it’s still super fun and a cool marriage of EDM and traditional music. On an unrelated note — why can’t the audience clap in time?

**guy\_like\_u** (8): just vibes

**happyletuce06** (8): fun! a bit basic tho

**LunaMoonMeUp** (8): A fun cheesy song with a flavour unique about the country sending it, it's what I want from a Eurovision entry.

**Martin1009** (8): I worship Alexandra Rotan

**Smuckles** (8): Bizarre, I'm into it. I like to think Aleksander Skarsgard listened to this while preparing for The Northman

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): dated but fun

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): sounds fun

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): I have never been very big on this song tbh, it feels kinda overrated

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): that one guy was just having the time of his life

**noideawhatever** (7): fun song, but also not the most interesting.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): it’s a lot of fun, especially the joiking (is that how it’s spelled?). Another interesting song

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Here for S-Pop (Sámi-Pop)

# Bald people haters

**plastichaxan** (6.7): this was going so well and then that toy ass bridge started i hate it here

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): idk what that guy with the deep voice is here for, like that's only a negative, but otherwise it's a bop

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this is for my bestie who i fought with about how much she wanted this to win this year

**BebeLuigi** (6): This was fine but winning the televote? Really?

**daretheghost** (6): I never bought the hype about this one.

**hannahspants** (6): I don't get the love for this song. It's okay, it's not bad, but winner of the televote? I don't get it.

**MrSwearword** (6): weak against a lot of the field here

**thedoublebanana** (6): I want to like this more, but Tom Hugo really ruins the whole vibe for me.

**welcome2thejam** (6): When that man and his voice revealed itself... best non-Epic Sax Guy moment of the rate

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5.5): I feel for that poor bald guy trying his best to give this boring song some flavour

**frogaranaman** (5): songs made for Tomorrowland mainstage

**shhhneak** (5): I WANT to like this but I also find the chorus SO irritating.

**ZebraSun73** (5): I think I might prefer this as a recording over their performance. I found the performance to be one confusing mess - i never understood the intended dynamic between the three performers. I love joik but the joik in this song feels gimmicky and just tacked onto the song. Europe must have seen something in this entry that i am just blind to.

**Kaylaboe** (4): u can always trust norway to send some lame dated 2013-edmpop

**racloves** (10): Yes Australia in Eurovision controversy aside, this song is incredible. If Australia keeps doing this we can replace Germany with them or something. Traurig

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Ah yes, Australia, my favorite European country...Ok in all seriousness, Dami absolutely KILLS this song, especially in the live performance. She hits EVERY note, even while sitting down, and it's just such a great power ballad overall. Eurofans were on the fence about Australia joining the competition, but after Dami, everyone quickly grew to love their presence, and they have continued to send bangers ever since ~~I'm pretending Isiah Firebrace does not exist so this statement holds true~~

---
# We love the Aussies!

**thedoublebanana** (11): This was the year of the ballads and although Jamala won, Dami Im outperformed her IMO. I wish the spotify version had the ending from the performance because it shows how much power and energy Dami put into this song. Absolutely stunning.

**celladonn** (10): gotta be patriotic and give my country's song a 10... Dami killed this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): VOCALS!

**DefaultPophead** (10): Never been so proud to watch an Aussie on live television.

**guy\_like\_u** (10): my robbed goddess. This was the best song my a MILE this year and remains one of my favourites of all time. Her vocals are jaw dropping here, even better than the studio version. I debated giving this my 11 but … Fuego

**iniekcja\_** (10): she really singlehandedly brought Australia into Europe

**itsabop** (10): Showstopping, powerful, beautiful

**Martin1009** (10): two tens in the same year? 2016 slayed

**MrSwearword** (10): Australia's best entry, brutally robbed, all the flurry of gay adjectives you can throw at a song.

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): Thank God Australia was there that year. Song still gives me chills. A pop anthem for the ages, sung by a VERY talented vocalist. Televotes did this dirty just because she wasn’t from a European country.

**nootnoot781** (10): the fact this would’ve won if they didn’t change the voting that year… rip

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): also deserved winner. I think Ukraine helps the competition diversify a bit from just pop. So I’m the long run it was a better choice. But I preferred this 😩. Australia peaked here. Go back to your roots!!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Dami being the best entry Australia has sent to Eurovision ever feels right (although Kate was HUGELY robbed)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): outsold Simon & Garfunkel, and Disturbed fucking wish

**shhhneak** (10): This almost got my 11 but it didn’t because I needed to demonstrate how it remains the most robbed song in Eurovision.

**Stryxen** (10): [More vocal slayage]

**throwaway-7650** (10): ty euro I lauv you! happy AAPI heritage month

**veryanniev** (10): I wish the studio version was even half as good as the live one, Dami Im’s voice is insane!!!!

**ZebraSun73** (10): She was robbed!! ROBBED!!!

**awkward\_penguin** (9.8): A manifestation of beauty and power. Wow.

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I still dont't get what Australia is doing here but this was a slay

**BebeLuigi** (9): It's such a good pop song honestly, and that live was so impressive

**criestotheclicking** (9): would’ve also been a worthy winner but I can’t say it’s better than 1944. Well I suppose she did hit those notes sitting down, which is an impressive feat.

**flavasavavandal** (9): if this was a cover of the Simon and Garfunkel song I was prepared to give it my 0

**jaztinax** (9): australia really went: let us blow you out of the water to make you forget how hilarious it is that we are here!!!

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): i maintain this didn’t deserve to win over 1944 despite what many people think but still a great song!

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): hello darkness my old friend- oh wait

**vayyiqra** (9): I still have no clue why Australia is allowed to compete in this contest but yeah this is good.

**speaknowred** (8.7): The best Australia has ever sent

**afs** (8.5): Australia?????

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): finally a good power ballad

**CrimsonROSET** (8): ok Simon and Garfunkel

**daretheghost** (8): Live version outsold.

**skargardin** (8): cmon vocals

**welcome2thejam** (8): Simple but effective. Rating the live version and this is the kind of song that works much better for me in that environment

**emmaelf** (7.5): a true eurovision anthem. not my favourite australia entry but they really do well. excellent chorus and better verses than others in the genre.

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): i was so scared this was gonna win like this song is FINE but there's so much better

**apatel27** (7): She can sing but this is Eurovision not X Factor. You can't just sit there for the whole performance

**cremeebrulee** (7): ok going into this rate i thought this was actually gonna be like 3 minutes of silence, that would’ve been so funny honestly

**Hogwartsreject1912** (7): If we were rating the live performance only this would be a 10 for sure

**LunaMoonMeUp** (7): Some of the best vocals to ever be highlighted on the stage. But the song itself lacks a je ne sais quoi that really makes me love it compared to other similar vocal showcases.

**s2pd** (7): Great vocal performance, but the chorus could have been stronger

**seanderlust** (7): okay....great gowns! (i actually like this song fine but the dress is gorgeous)

**TiltControls** (7): hello darkness my old friend

**Uberpigeon** (7): ok pop off

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): My biggest gripe with this song is that she uses the word “Facetime”. Like seriously?? Why not “space-time”???

**akanewasright** (6.5): this isn’t hello darkness my old friend what the fuck

# Get Australia OUT of Eurovision

**CarlieScion** (6): very 2016

**GapeCod** (6): Europe is a fake concept.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): generic (derogatory)

**hannahspants** (6): I'm supposed to love this cause I'm Australian but it's a run of the mill pop song with some not great lyrics. Dami has a great voice and she knows it, but she blew it on the final note by trying to be all "look at my pipes!" And it makes the end of the song sound weird. Also the staging was shit.

**happyletuce06** (6): she has a nice voice, the song is kinda basic

**thedoctordances1940** (5.6): who let australians participate in my eurovision song contest smh 🙄

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): way too classy for Eurovision and lowkey ruined the Ukraine-Russia head to head

**frogaranaman** (5): girlie sounds like she doesn't wanna be here lol

**Awkward\_King** (3): ive always thought this song was so overrated cant lie but at least she looks yass

**racloves** (7): Not quite my number one. Well, evidently it’s pophead’s number ten

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): And now Greece bows out of the rate with their only winning song thus far. And what a winner it is! You can tell how much fun Helena is having with this song in the live performance, the dancing is so energetic and works perfectly with the traditionally inspired music. It's probably the most modern sounding of all the pre-2010 winners, and that probably helped it out a lot in this rate.

# You're my number 10!

**akanewasright** (10): YOU’RE MY NUMBER 10

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh she’s serving 2

**GapeCod** (10): BOP OF THE CENTURY!!!!!!!!!!!

**nootnoot781** (10): should’ve been her second win, but again an excellent entry.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): banger

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): Dua Lipa-ish

**seanderlust** (10): okay wait they spilled with this drum line! bops quite a bit

**skargardin** (10): One of the best winners I fear, hooks upon hooks upon HOOKS

**speaknowred** (10): One of my favorite entries ever

**thedoublebanana** (10): There is a reason this remains one of the top winners of all time. It's a great song.

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): I forgot they had male back vocals in this song and they are so camp

**throwaway-7650** (10): LOL'd when they formed the 1. I stan!

**ZebraSun73** (10): I wish I had more 11s to hand out, this is really a cut above all the other 00s winners.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): Helena playing that guys spine made me boost this by 2 points

**afs** (9.5): omg there's so much DIVA in the performances

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): yassified counting

**Martin1009** (9.5): talented brilliant etc etc, the ha sounds so horrid tho

**moonagenightmares** (9.2): folk part best part (it sounds better live tho)

**apatel27** (9): The traditional dancing then the faux lyra playing 👌

**astrologicalangel** (9): would have been a 10 but it rhyming fire/desire is an unforgivable sin

**celladonn** (9): I'm shaking my ass

**hannahspants** (9): Second best performance of the early 2000s.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): On top of being a ridiculously catchy bop, this feels SO Greek, and I always love when I can tell what country a Eurovision song is based on sound alone.

**noideawhatever** (9): not my number one but pretty good nonetheless

**awkward\_penguin** (8.7): One of the catchiest songs to ever be on Eurovision, with a perfect blend of Greek folk instrumentation. It never gets old.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Really kicks into high gear once the chorus hits

**DefaultPophead** (8.1): Truly mesmering.

**criestotheclicking** (8): not my kind of song but it’s insanely catchy - impressive for Helena to do all that dancing and almost sound as if she were standing still.

**daretheghost** (8): I don’t love this song the way a lot of other people do but I always appreciate when Eurovision songs have some sort of cultural hallmark like the bouzouki and lyra here.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): she snapped but the lyrics are kind of corny. Let me be generous still

**iniekcja\_** (8): buying violin suspenders for festival season as we speak

**MrSwearword** (8): It's fine for what it is but considering My Secret Combination literally came three years later, it doesn't totally secure its throne of being the song from Greece that deserved to win.

**Stryxen** (8): the way this is so bad but so good

**whatyourheartdesires** (8): hasn’t aged much!

**you2009** (7.7): every single time they've done that line dance I think they're about to dabke and then I remember this is eurovision

**s2pd** (7.5): Verses could have been stronger, but still a bop

**Awkward\_King** (7): my number like 18

**emmaelf** (7): this is such a eurovision song. i'd happily drink to this.

**happyletuce06** (7): really competent, pales a bit compared to ruslana

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): the song is fine but the bit where she ties ropes to and then plays one of her backup dancers like a cello? Incredible

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the way i love everything about this apart from the chorus sigh

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): part of me thinks this is good but it's also kinda terrible

**DirtyRat583** (6.3): its giving shakira in a good way

# You're my number ~~1~~ 0

**BebeLuigi** (6): It's fun I just like her 2001 song a lot more

**bigbigbee** (6): Mid Shakira

**CrimsonROSET** (6): this is like your first rhyming exercise while also sounding like a Disney song!

**guy\_like\_u** (6): I like the way she played that one guys intestines

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I’m sorry I cannot get past that James Brown sample lmao

**welcome2thejam** (6): Heard her use "passion" and "crucifixion" and am now poring over the lyrics, wondering if Jesus Christ is her Number One

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): extremely overrated. Secret Combination is very similar but much better.

**frogaranaman** (5): the gag that this would be if it placed nowhere near first

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (5): this aged poorly in my opinion, very 2000’s

**vayyiqra** (5): Alright but then there are the awful "lover/undercover" "fire/desire/higher" lyrics (my pet peeve).

**veryanniev** (5): the performance is objectively good but this song never did it for me

**CarlieScion** (4): more like my number FOUR amiright

**LesApfels** (3): I'm sorry but this chorus is clunky as hell

**Uberpigeon** (3): her mind rhyming one with one

**racloves** (10): QUEEN. ROBBED.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): And here I was thinking this song had a chance of winning...Fuego quickly became one of the most popular Eurovision songs ever since it's electric live performance dropped and its shocking loss to Toy in 2018, which then gave Cyprus the idea that they have to keep sending uptempo pop songs to have a chance to win, and they have continued to send more or less the same song ever since. Joking aside though, you could very well argue Fuego was a real influence on what types of songs countries send to Eurovision, judging by the influx of songs similar to it in later years, but in the end none of them have the same influence or power as the original did.

---
# Yeah yeah, fire
**akanewasright** (11): this is the best song I’ve ever heard omfg

**guy\_like\_u** (11): We can’t talk about robbed without mentioning Fuego. The fact she did all that, in heels, and didn’t miss one note - astounding. Truly the Cypriot Beyoncé. The song itself is incredible.

**ashandimlotion** (10): every woman who dances at the ESC will be compared negatively to her forevermore

**CarlieScion** (10): YAAAS

**GapeCod** (10): This losing to Toy is arguably more iconic than the victory would have been. The drama of it all!

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): Gaslight, girlboss, girlbop. Eleni tore up that stage, and was unfortunate to go toe to toe with another excellent pop girlie in 2018.

**MrSwearword** (10): honestly, Cyprus is never winning this (or really hosting this) but this is the best entry they're ever having. Yeah yeah, fire.

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): Imagine this not winning lmao.

**nootnoot781** (10): i remember not caring about this at all until the first rehearsal footage dropped and then my jaw was on the floor. this is the power of staging

**skargardin** (10): FUEGO!!!

**Stryxen** (10): absolute iconicity yeah yeah fire

**thedoublebanana** (10): The performance and song that started a trend. Without Eleni we wouldn't have a lot of the songs from the recent years. This deserved to win on performance.

**throwaway-7650** (10): NICOLE SCHERZINGER OF THE PUSSYCAT DOLLS?

**ZebraSun73** (10): The drop into the instrumental is just delicious. This is top shelf ESC pop, pelicans fly-fly-flying included

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): pussy

**itsabop** (9.5): Deserved the win

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): a song so good Cyprus just kept sending it forever after

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**BebeLuigi** (9): I'm still baffled she didn't win the televote, she had by far and a miles the best performance of the night

**cremeebrulee** (9): taki taki taki taki

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Toy beat this????

**DefaultPophead** (9): She's so hot. I'm upset.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): now how did this lose to Toy

**Kaylaboe** (9): ... she deserved

**speaknowred** (9): Goddess

**whatyourheartdesires** (9): fire

**Martin1009** (8.5): Yeah yeah, fire

**moonagenightmares** (8.2): slay

**afs** (8): who is chanel and why are the comments all about that

**daretheghost** (8): This song goes off but the way it is the blueprint for every Cypriot entry since is a bit too much at this point.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): She's so beautiful and her dancing is amazing!

**hannahspants** (8): this song has terrible lyrics but it's stupid catchy and was performed fantastically.

**happyletuce06** (8): we will never have someone like her again

**Hogwartsreject1912** (8): Yeah yeah, fire.

**pleasegivemeasword** (8): that beat drop >>>

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the drop kinda slaps

**TiltControls** (8): oh the fire nation's in eurovision now?

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I don’t really like EDM but something about this works. I like the fake drop, the main melody in the chorus, the way that when she sings the last chorus the music gets all big… a very well-constructed song!

**plastichaxan** (7.7): i can see why this is a favorite but :shrug:

**shhhneak** (7.6): She looks like RuPaul would call her a star and then bottom 5 times before getting eliminated.

**apatel27** (7.5): Nice Choreo

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): this is good but the song is just sooo uninteresting, I heard ten of these in an hour on the radio at the time

**thedoctordances1940** (7.1): decent bop

**criestotheclicking** (7): this is fun, but I really despise the song for making every song similar to this referred to as a fuego clone - looking at Spain 2022, considering that Spanish influences is what makes the ‘fuego-esque’ genre (Replay, El Diablo, Chameleon to some extent). Great use of lighting also.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): cool girls don’t look at explosions

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (7): I didn’t like this AT ALL back then. But I must admit, it slaps

**s2pd** (7): Bop

**vayyiqra** (7): Nothing we haven't heard before but it's good.

**welcome2thejam** (7): I know she was surrounded by multiple fire jets, but that still could've easily heated up more

# Everything changed when the fire nation attacked

**emmaelf** (6.5): it has the drop, it has the lyric-less chorus, eurovision really does show the trends in pop music. a middling song, but the performance the artist gives is excellent and feels much larger than the song does.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): #JusticeForJuriji

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): gays were so mad when this lost to toy…not me though y’all stay safe

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): this would have been a radio hit in like 2017 or something but we’re past that

**noideawhatever** (6): it's nice to see a pop girl performance but the song is just ok

**seanderlust** (6): this is an anti-anti-drop account

**flavasavavandal** (5): Shakira could’ve killed this

**frogaranaman** (5): this has 2017 dance pop hit written all over it

**Melody** (5): still better than Toy!

**musical\_pyn** (5): I was going to give this a lower score but that post-chorus is incredible so I gotta give this some points

**sirpancakeXI** (4.5): I literally love eleni so much but this song never clicked for me……

**fadedblue09** (4): Solid performance but very generic

**racloves** (8): Totally agree with my cohosts comments, at the time I don’t remember particularly liking the song that much, but listening back now, I get it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Uhh…before this rate officially started I already had a ballot filled out with my scores and had this marked down as a 2 originally. I really did not like this song back then and thought it was so dramatic and overblown and for what. But now, given just how scarily relevant this song is again, even though it was based on an event that took place almost 80 years ago…yeah I finally get this song now. Eurovision has always been a very non-serious competition, and serious songs, let alone serious winners, are mostly a rarity. But no song has ever had as much *palpable* emotions like this one has. This isn’t easy to listen to and it’s not meant to be. This is a song about the singer’s grandmother being deported out of Crimea by a maniacal dictator, a singer who has faced extremely similar events earlier this year. Yes, it’s political. Yes, it technically goes against the rules of the contest. But if there’s any song that goes against the rules that should’ve been allowed, I’m glad it was one that’s as chilling and powerful as this.

---

**ashandimlotion** (11): excellent song, performance and message. I have very comfortable question for you. 1944, is 11?...... of course

**awkward\_penguin** (11): Music is personal, and you can see the emotions flowing freely every single second of this performance. It just keeps building and growing, and a story is told. The first verse and chorus show a scared and tentative singer. Then the second verse and chorus injects anger - you can see that she is fighting. In the bridge, she seems to be collecting her ancestor's memories - you can almost see spirits floating around her. And in that epic high note, she releases the power of traditions, blood and generations in a war cry that's simultaneously pleading, triumphing and lamenting. That tree lighting up is by far the most powerful image I have ever seen in Eurovision, and it will take a lot to beat this.

**fadedblue09** (11): I was already chilling before I even read the lyrics. That's the power of music for ya

**iniekcja\_** (11): with the way my music taste has evolved this has absolutely become my favorite winner, great song, great staging

**Kaylaboe** (11): the best performance to ever grace an eurovision stage. everything about it is sublime; her vocal performance, the subdued lighting, the high note, the LEDs, the kinda trippy beat that reminds me of gnarls barkley, the heartfelt lyricism.. perfection

**Martin1009** (11): Most hauntingly beautiful performance in eurovision. Chills everytime

**Stryxen** (11): [Vocal slayage] (also serious comment: the first time i saw this i was in awe, really one of the first songs i can remember just shocking me and having an impact - and it was on EUROVISION. ah, that’s history)

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I can’t really justify giving an 11 to anything else. I *wish* I could justify giving an 11 to anything else. I wish I could just hear this song and go “Oh sounds sad but pretty. 8!” But context means everything, of course. You could say that, thanks to that context, 1944 has become deeper and richer, it can be examined from many new angles, and in a sense I can enjoy it and appreciate it a lot more. But I would much rather live in a world where 1944 is just a pretty tribute to a sad time long gone. An 8.

**akanewasright** (10): holy fuck this is incredible

**Awkward\_King** (10): honestly very tempted to 11 this, its such a brilliant eurovision entry. jamala's performance is so moving, the graphics in the background aren't a gimmick but they really enhance the performance. the song actually bops as well while being very poignant

**criestotheclicking** (10): just an amazingly performed song. Obviously has an extra layer of meaning for people outside of Ukraine now, but has always been emotionally affecting.

**daretheghost** (10): Haunting.

**hannahspants** (10): stunning performance, stunning voice, stunning. I always thought that, though I do tear up when watching it now for obvious reasons.

**happyletuce06** (10): her voice. the tree. everything about this.

**Melody** (10): #FreeUkraine

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): another 11 contender here. yes political songs not allowed in eurovision bla bla (never been true anyway lol) but consider this: this song is amazing

**No-Place-to-Go** (10): One of the best Eurovision winners ever? Song hits even harder nowadays, because of obvious reasons. But damn, Jamala’s voice is incredibly powerful (that high note at the end - DAMN!). That production is very reminiscent of Burial’s work.

**nootnoot781** (10): ukraine is literally the best country in eurovision.

**nt96** (10): STOP STARING AT THIS COMMENT AND DO THE Y2UK RATE

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (10): deserved winner, loved it from the start. Stay strong Ukraine 🇺🇦 💛💙

**skargardin** (10): oh god the chills

**itsabop** (9.5): Powerful, emotional performance

**seanderlust** (9.5): holy shit this is an incredible song. the building scream in the bridge that leads into the chorus? incredible

**sirpancakeXI** (9.5): that staging holy shit. the golden tree sealed the win for me

**thedoublebanana** (9.2): Not to get political, but this song is so political. A great emotional ballad that tells the story of her family and you can feel it in the performance.

**speaknowred** (9.1): Ukraine is the best

**apatel27** (9): Last minute makes this song

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): A truly heartbreaking and powerful song back in 2016, only now to have gotten even more gut-wrenching.

**vayyiqra** (9): I saw some Discourse about this song on Popheads but idk anything about that so I'm rating it on vibes alone and I like it. Also the lyrics being about a pretty overlooked historical event is cool.

**whatyourheartdesires** (9): I wasn’t feeling this before Eurovision but I understood it when I saw the performance. Jamala remains queen and her performances are more chilling now than ever

**afs** (8.5): chilling with the current situation

**DefaultPophead** (8.4): You really feel her pain through her voice.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the chorus had me double checking which country I was listening to

**Uberpigeon** (8): she wants to be bjork so bad

**moonagenightmares** (7.8): this wouldve been better if it was entirely in ukrainian

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): I was gonna give this a 10 but if I have to compare her and Dami, Dami outsold completely. She’s a bit pitchy on this performance too.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7): eerily relevant song in current times.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I don’t think this one needs me to say anything.

**noideawhatever** (7): my least favorite of all ukrainian songs here and it's still pretty good

**Smuckles** (7): Wait, is that the drumbeat from Burial – Archangel? Is this future garage?

**veryanniev** (7): I genuinely wish I liked this more, because the song is very unique and important, but although the chorus is incredibly beautiful I absolutely despise how the verses sound. Her high notes in the end are otherworldly though, and the performance itself is really powerful.

**CarlieScion** (6.5): very beautiful lyrically, but vocally……..

**BebeLuigi** (6): The fact it won is great, sadly I don't really care for it before the last minute qdfsdfqsd The tree on the LED was amazing tho

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): alright but not like some mega collapse

**bigbigbee** (5): I think that this song is really cool and important and I love that other people can enjoy it on a musical level as well, but I unfortunately have not been able to

**emmaelf** (5): powerful lyrics in a song i just wouldn't choose to listen to again.

**frogaranaman** (5): this doesn't sound like the 40s (I may have entirely missed the point of this song)

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this song is literally 1944

**s2pd** (5): I might have liked it if I liked her voice

**throwaway-7650** (4.4): "go off vocals!" me 2 minutes later: "ou I got vocal-fished"
[/r/popheads/comments/v0gp6t/21st_century_eurovision_rate_reveal_day_3_it/iagu4gv/]

=====

TakeOnMeByA-ha: **MrSwearword** (4): Not because it was too political or whatever and even putting aside the fact Dami Im was fucking robbed, there's one good note of this song towards the very end; sorry y'all but Jamala can't really sing all that well.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): yes I am still bitter about this winning

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): that high note was a jumpscare

**shhhneak** (3): How does she sound off-key while talk-singing but can whistle note??

**guy\_like\_u** (1): I’ve said this is the worst winner in the past couple decades and stand by that today. I genuinely don’t know what people were thinking, this is horrible. She is so pitchy at the climax too

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I'm so happy Soldi made top 10!!! This song still remains one of my favorite songs to ever be entered into Eurovision, and the deep lyrics and unique sound, especially within the context of this rate, really helps it stand out amongst the other songs. Even though this song didn't win, Mahmood can take home a consolation prize, as this was the ONLY song in the entire rate that never left the top 10.

---
# Money
**BebeLuigi** (11): There were a few songs that I considered giving my 11, but I ultimately chose this one because first Soldi is absolutely amazing. But secondly I think since I started watching eurovision and following it this intensely around ten years ago, I haven't been taken for an artist the way I have been for Mahmood. He's by far the ESC artist the most present in my spotify playlists and I love many of his songs other than Soldi.

**criestotheclicking** (11): I love this song, but dislike the ESC cut because it reduces the number of come va-s in the pre-chorus. Soldi >>>>> Brividi.

**No-Place-to-Go** (11): This gave off more winner’s energy than Duncan Laurence, I’m sorry. Mahmood performed the SHIT out of this song. I still clap because that hook is IRRESISTIBLE!

**1998tweety** (10): hot kingie

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck me

**bigbigbee** (10): Recent k-pop composers must have listened to the same stuff that this guy did, because this sounds like some of the best k-pop songs that have come out in the past few years. Anyway I think this song is great. It really sold-i me on this rate when I heard it early on, HAR HAR HAR!

**daretheghost** (10): https://i.imgur.com/ACibm2p.png

**DefaultPophead** (10): I remember thinking this Eurovision year was super bland (look who won) and was doing my homework while watching. This was one of the only, if not the only (nah I'm exaggerating, KEiiNO and Hatari were so good), one that was less boring than my university work and commanded my attention. But that said, if this wasn't one of my most played songs of all time, I would dock Mahmood more for his NFTs. This would've been my 11. Yeah, docking one point off is a huge protest.

**frogaranaman** (10): the cover art really sold me on this being a bop

**happyletuce06** (10): great message, great song, great delivery

**iniekcja\_** (10): hottest entity to grace the esc stage

**jaztinax** (10): if only he brought this song to this year’s eurovision ughh

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): it’s the mega smash

**nootnoot781** (10): outsold brividi 1000 times over

**plastichaxan** (10): i need this man to do unspeakable things to me wow

**welcome2thejam** (10): Solid hooks and beat, and A+ use of handclaps

**ZebraSun73** (10): The supressed fury in this song is amazing, also does this amazing ESC thing of being three songs in one and it magically works?

**guy\_like\_u** (9.5): would have won almost any other year, it just happened to be up against a behemoth. I feel seen by these slogans on screen - “it hurts to be alive”

**speaknowred** (9.1): Italy

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): The whole damn package. Mahmood is at his absolute best sending bops.

**skargardin** (9): BOP

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): banger, how tf did this lose to arcade

**hannahspants** (8): is good

**noideawhatever** (8): huh this is really good

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): a grower for me. The instrumental of this is fantastic, I’m just not sure about his singing. I’m really sorry Mahmood 😭

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): I don’t love the song but everyone clapping makes the performance that much cooler

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I gotta check out this dude sometime

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Did you know that Mahmood was an Underrated [FRESH] Threads certified artist? Of course you didn’t, no one read those.

**s2pd** (7.5): Great beat, love the pre-chorus

**thedoublebanana** (7.2): I go through waves of liking this or not.

**afs** (7): sordy

**apatel27** (6.5): The audience clapping was neat

# Broke

**throwaway-7650** (6.3): I like this but I kind of have nothing to say about it at all

**DirtyRat583** (6): the audience LOVE this guy dont they

**emmaelf** (6): there's not enough of anything to cling onto.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): if I had a nickel for every time I was underwhelmed by a Mahmood Eurovision performance, I'd have two nickels - which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice

**vayyiqra** (6): head empty but this is alright

**LesApfels** (5.5): His song Dorado goes off btw

**MrSwearword** (5): Italy again thought they were winning with something so middling didn't they...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ok i need to get this off my chest real quick. sweden has been sending some of the most generic and boring songs to the contest every single year since loreen's win and every single year they consistently get top 10 rankings for songs that barely even bother trying. and the one year, the ONE year they actually send something unique and interesting to the contest, the show gets cancelled. what the fuck!!! i refuse to live in a world where goddamn i can't go on and fucking if i were sorry are top 5 ranking songs and move isn't. the world is a cruel and dark place and this song not getting the justice it deserves is worth it. but yeah, good song.

**racloves** (8): This is just so good

---

**akanewasright** (10): holy FUCK this is so good. Like it’s good to the point where I want to lower my other scores since I can’t give this an 11

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): I’m securing their Essence Fest booking as we speak

**iniekcja\_** (10): sumn sumn mother lake

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): The gospel chords are so good

**shhhneak** (10): Certified titty.gif bop

**TiltControls** (10): what happened to the papas

**thedoublebanana** (9.5): I know this would've flopped, but it's such a fun powerful song and really wish they got the auto-bid for 2021.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): as an Irish person I’m legally required to hate all Swedish entries and stop them winning, but this is painfully good

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): Sweden really sent thier best song in years for the cancelled one huh

**speaknowred** (8.6): One of the best Swedish entries in a while

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): slay. slay

**daretheghost** (8): Skirts dangerously close to Generic Uplifting Eurovision Song territory but I think it works.

**s2pd** (8): The ultimate Eurovision feel good song

**ZebraSun73** (8): Classic 2010s Sweden entry

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): it's nice but I didn't do this rate for gospel-core I fear

**criestotheclicking** (7): The Mamas were a crucial part of John Lundvik’s performance and it’s a shame they never got to grace the Eurovision stage in their own right. Despite this, the song is a little… vanilla.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s basic-ass motivational music… but still somehow pretty good?

**welcome2thejam** (7): Okay song but strong performances save it

**seanderlust** (6.7): is it cheesy? absolutely. but god it works so well I have to look past it

**DefaultPophead** (6.6): This is quite lovely, just a bit generic.

**apatel27** (6): Sounds like a 2016 song

**happyletuce06** (6): love their chemistry, a song is meh

**Martin1009** (6): Another standard entry from us. top 3 jury, 10th televote. 5th place finish

**Melody** (6): Sweden stop sending mid songs challenge.

**ashandimlotion** (5.5): the most melodiefestivalen song to ever exist in a lot of ways

**whatyourheartdesires** (5): bland

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): eh it's not terrible but it just irks me

**hannahspants** (4): yawn

**LunaMoonMeUp** (3): The Mamas are oozing with charisma and really know how to command a stage. It would be nice if they could release a song that doesn't sound like a reject from The Greatest Showman.

**moonagenightmares** (2): sweden really likes sending bland songs like this

# And the award for most unnecessarily TMI comment of the rate goes to...

**GapeCod** (10): In the first few days of January 2020 I met a guy on Tinder for the first time and he was a big ESC fan (like, "watching every national contest every year" big fan), so we hit it off rather quickly... Our first date went kinda bad because we were both poor college students and I couldn't really afford anything fancy. ☠ I took him to this cute little time-cafe place where we could like.. talk, have tea and maybe play board games and such, but when we arrived he was just... so needy, lmao, like he'd just sit there and expect me to do everything for him.. so yeah. Prior to that he would act all sweet in texts, he would send selfies of him doing mundane things which I used to find very cute, but after that it was just RADIO SILENCE. Worse than that, actually, because whenever I'd ask him if something's wrong he'd just say that he was too anxious to talk to me and would promise to get better, all the while asking me "not to leave him the way everyone else had"... So I blocked him on my birthday in February. ☠ Song unrelated.

**racloves** (10): would have won if the contest went ahead

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Yeah, there was basically no contest for who was gonna win the bonus rate. And why should there be? Think About Things is just a phenomenal pop song and is widely considered to be the would-be winner of 2020 had it gone on as planned for a reason. So congrats Daði Freyr, you may not have won Eurovision, but you won something even more important: the popheads' Eurovision Rate bonus rate!!

---

**apatel27** (10): Can't go wrong with some sax

**ashandimlotion** (10): the fact that non-ESC fans knew about this.. they could’ve had the world!

**daretheghost** (10): :daisybop:

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is giving 2020s Gotye and I’m kind of living my best life

**DefaultPophead** (10): This should've been a Eurovision winner, and more than deserves to be a rate bonus winner.

**frogaranaman** (10): easiest 11 I could imagine for this rate. this song is EVERYTHING and an example for why a good bass-line elevates songs to the next level. SO mad this is in the bonus

**GapeCod** (10): Outsold Bjork's son.

**guy\_like\_u** (10): WOULD HAVE WON IN 2020

**hannahspants** (10): would have won 2020 no doubt about it

**iniekcja\_** (10): I love real live instruments

**Kaylaboe** (10): reykjavík you will always be the 2021 host

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): Listening to Daði Freyr is like listening to pure distilled and bottled joy. I have little to no doubt he would have walked 2020.

**nootnoot781** (10): the winner that never was :(

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this may be the first time in history the word baby has been used in a song in the most literal sense

**shhhneak** (10): This would’ve CLEARED the schedule for Reykjavik 2021.

**Smuckles** (10): Very cute and charming. This would be my theoretical 2020 winner.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Such a groove, an instant earworm. A shining example of a song being pure fun

**ZebraSun73** (10): Iceland missing out on their long-awaited ESC victory is the real tragedy of the pandemic

**seanderlust** (9.7): I though the album cover for this was an NFT at first and i was ready to fight someone

**criestotheclicking** (9): this would’ve won in 2020. Is also far superior to 10 Years, although both are equally as sweet in subject matter.

**happyletuce06** (9): international hit and for a reason

**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): I fully believe this would’ve won

**jaztinax** (9): i love icelandic kookiness

**Martin1009** (9): Woulda had US-crossover

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): far superior to their 2021 song

**throwaway-7650** (9): it's giving

**speaknowred** (8.6): so cute

**s2pd** (8.5): My jam. Endless charm

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (8): I’m desperate for Iceland to win!!! They were so close here 😭. Oh what could’ve been

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): it's a really good song but like yeah that's it really

**moooo566** (7): i think i prefer their 2021 entry tbh, im glad we ended up with that instead

**thedoublebanana** (7): This isn't really my style of song, but I can appreciate the catchiness of it and really unfortunate after being favorite in 2020 and not being able to perform because of COVID in 2021, they deserve better.

**vayyiqra** (7): bop idk I'm running out of things to say here

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It sounds really stilted and awkward… but I think that actually works to its benefit?

**Stryxen** (5): oop… moving on

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Easily the song that shocked me the most with how well it performed, Wild Dances is probably the single most defining Eurovision song of the early 2000's, and for good reason! It's production is so unique and still holds up today, the staging is so iconic with it's outfits and, well, wild dancing, and Ruslana herself is a great performer and puts her all into this song. While it's by no means my favorite song from this rate, let alone my favorite song from the early 2000's, I completely understand all the love this song has and how it managed to place as high as it did.

**racloves** (7): Don’t get me wrong, I like this song, but I did not expect it to do this well

---
# Shi-di-ri-di-duy, shi-di-ri-di-da-na!
**babadork** (11): The director owes them an apology. How am I supposed to see their dancing with the camera zooming all over the place?

**DevilsOfLoudun** (11): This was so iconic. All of my family was shook. For me it's still the most energetic performance in eurovision.

**moonagenightmares** (11): QUEEN. ukraine is probably the number 1 country that just GETS how to do eurovision

**Uberpigeon** (11): ok slay

**apatel27** (10): Trumpets, Xena, Choreo What's not to like?

**Awkward\_King** (10): this feels so celebratory but also like a battle song its so cool and its boppy too!!! this has always been one of my fave eurovision songs i hope it does well!!

**BebeLuigi** (10): That was absolutely amazing, Still one of my favourite winners from the contest.

**bigbigbee** (10): The consistency of Ukraine in this rate is so high. I knew about Go_A and Verka, but when I checked for THIS song and saw “Ukrainian singer-songwriter…” that I was like okay, this is getting absurd

**CarlieScion** (10): GO OFF QUEEN

**cremeebrulee** (10): oh she’s serving

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this is like the most slay Medieval Times performance of my life

**hannahspants** (10): best performance of the early 2000s without a doubt. Completely unmatched.

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): If Sertab Erener made the blueprint for an iconic girlbop at Eurovision, then Ruslana perfected it.

**nootnoot781** (10): YESSSSS! ukraine getting their first win a year after debuting was well deserved with this performance. ukranian entries are always so much fun and this is no exception.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): she ATE this up. the choreo and styling are everything

**sirpancakeXI** (10): the way she danced somehow make me love it more

**skargardin** (10): ICONIC!

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): what a slay performance

**veryanniev** (10): no offence to Chanel, Eleni and other Eurovision girlies but this is what I call breath control!!!!I love this song and Ruslana so much ;)

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): unstoppable force tbh

**you2009** (10): I love xena warrior princess choreo slays too

**speaknowred** (9.8): Amazing song of course it is from Ukraine

**awkward\_penguin** (9.5): Absolutely iconique. Well-written song, unforgettable staging, great costuming, perfect vocals, and 100% representative of Ukraine.

**thedoublebanana** (9.5): Good song, but there were better songs that year. The performance gets you moving and makes you think this is a 10, but it's just not quite there.

**afs** (9): the title should have prepared me

**iniekcja\_** (9): she made six people seem like… more…

**moooo566** (9): now we're getting into some eurovision

**MrSwearword** (9): great production but the vocals are horrible

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): So I’ve discovered I’m a sucker for Eastern European pop folk music

**daretheghost** (8.5): This goes SO hard.

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Why are all Eurovision contestants lowkey hot?

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): yeah this is what makes eurovision great

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): Nice to see that Ukraine has always been doing absolutely wild acts and killing it

**emmaelf** (8): this is great spectacle and a good enough song to carry the performance.

**happyletuce06** (8): a huge step forward, she did everything she had to do and more

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I’m bopping

**Melody** (8): The Eurovision pop girls of the 2000s >> the 2010s/20s flops

**noideawhatever** (8): ukraine delivering as usual

**nt96** (8): Xena: Warrior Princess went hard on this

**s2pd** (8): Clear winner that year

**Stryxen** (8): come on choreo

**ashandimlotion** (7.5): massive bop, Ukraine are just so fucking good at Eurovision

**Kaylaboe** (7.5): not ukraine's best but i respect it

**indie\_fan\_** (7.2): The more I go through this rate, the more I realize there are going to be a bunch of types of voices I'm not accustomed to hearing. This one isn't too bad though

**CrimsonROSET** (7): insert that one video of the fairy flying into the fire pit

**Martin1009** (7): step one, get everyones attention, maybe a battle-horn?

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): don’t love the song but this performance is great tbh

**throwaway-7650** (7): are those... elephant noises in the intro and bridge?

**seanderlust** (6.8): an extra point or so because the outfits are very yass

**criestotheclicking** (6): not a massive fan of the song itself but the staging is killer.

# I Don't Dance

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (6): I guess it was the best that year

**Smuckles** (6): The album cover for this sure is something!

**vayyiqra** (6): Science cannot explain why I kind of like this cheesefest.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Eh, I've seen wilder

**shhhneak** (5.8): this is when Eurovision became Eurovision iykyk

**frogaranaman** (5): isn't this the thing they do in Midsummar

**guy\_like\_u** (5): Aside from the obvious Xena does Eurovision, this is a fun song if a little forgettable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ICONIC in every sense of the word. Conchita is an queen and sings this song beautifully, and her presence on stage is so commanding that she was able to win single handedly without any help from backup singers or dancers, something that hadn't been done in the contest since 1970! Many detractors would say she only won because of the beard, but this song is so magnificent that I think it could've won if it was sung by anybody, though Conchita herself definitely helps elevate this song to an even higher level.

**racloves** (9): Extremely iconic, and for good reason. This is what makes Eurovision amazing.

# Vote for the Drag Rate
**apatel27** (10): Gay Icon

**CrimsonROSET** (10): popheads is gonna hate this rate the best songs are ballads

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Jesus

**frogaranaman** (10): pussy truly popped with this one

**GapeCod** (10): ...why did I not like this at the time, I was literally an egg ☠

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Deserved everything, and got it too!

**iniekcja\_** (10): an iconic bond song and it's not even a bond song

**jaztinax** (10): conchita has my heart forever

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): I remember in 2014, Conchita was being touted as the "joke" act by most of Europe: a modern day bearded lady. But she sure showed her doubters, with an incredible voice and song that stands on its own without any of the context. Add the context of her being disregarded, only to become an icon for queer people across Europe - well, it's a classic. Truly phenomenal performance.

**MrSwearword** (10): this slays so hard and it was responsible for one of the best voting strategies in Eurovision history: "Piss off a Russian and vote for Conchita". I'm still gagged it took so long before a drag queen won this competition.

**musical\_pyn** (10): the best vocalist in this rate by far

**plastichaxan** (10): moved the whole world, the whole world was moved by it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I'll be honest, this song was never that impressive for me, but Conchita is amazing and iconic and this is truly such a defining Eurovision moment

**skargardin** (10): GAY ANTHEM!

**Stryxen** (10): a SLAY for the SLAYERS !! xx CHANGED the game NOBODY is doing it like Conchita WURK

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this is probably the first time I’m seeing this in its entirety and it deserves all the hype even though I have ballad-phobia

**veryanniev** (10): still in my top 5 Eurovision winner songs

**welcome2thejam** (10): Uber dramatic and I mean that positively. Hits some incredible show-stopper type notes. Think the live version does so much in terms of energy, presentation, and the crowd enthusiasm bringing it to the next level.

**awkward\_penguin** (9.8): Timeless.

**itsabop** (9.7): Eurovision legend

**afs** (9.5): VOCALSSSSSSSSS (also ass wings!!!)

**ashandimlotion** (9.5): the grip this woman had on the European public has not been seen since, and too right!

**emmaelf** (9.5): i'm trying to separate the huge impact the artist had from the ballad that was sung. the impact was amazing, the song was very good. very james bond theme tune.

**MoonlightByWindow** (9.5): god i’ve always loved how cinematic this sounds

**seanderlust** (9.3): I feel like this is an obvious winner contender, but for very good reason. conchita is an icon, but also this gives such a transcendent, big band-backed spirit lift

**BebeLuigi** (9): Stunning song, stunning performer

**CarlieScion** (9): bond theme who

**criestotheclicking** (9): stream To The Beat by Conchita Wurst!

**nootnoot781** (9): the yassification of bond themes

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): she slayed. Austria she is the benchmark. I drew a picture of her in art class when I was a teen. It ended up looking like Jesus, which just proves her impact is unmatched 😤👏

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): wait i know this one!!! this was iconic

**speaknowred** (9): Really good

**daretheghost** (8.5): Iconic.

**thedoublebanana** (8.5): I cried when this won. I was so happy. Although not my favorite now, in the moment, I was living.

**shhhneak** (8.3): I’m sorry but at 3:12 there’s a time traveller with an AUSTRIAN FACE MASK.

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): ok wow this is cinematic ...

**babadork** (8.1): This is the only one of these songs that I was aware of before doing this rate, but it’s kind of meh.

**DirtyRat583** (8.1): gorgeous

**flavasavavandal** (8): overrated but still iconic

**guy\_like\_u** (8): the bond theme that never was. I will never forget watching this live, it’s hard to deceive now but this winning truly felt like a huge moment. A beautiful ballad with a stunning vocal

**noideawhatever** (8): queen that made me aware of eurovision despite living an ocean away from europe

**nt96** (8): she lowkey outsold No Time to Die and Writings on the Wall, not that it's a high bar to go over anyway

**s2pd** (8): Quality Bond theme

**thedoctordances1940** (8): i feel like this is my last proper memory of eurovision, i very much lost touch with it after this year, but yeah this is a very good song

**Uberpigeon** (8): ok even i, a eurovision non-watcher, know how iconic this was. i also dont know why everyone was so confused about what a drag queen is.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I didn’t realize this song would be so… Bond-y. I like it a lot!

**Martin1009** (7.8): better bond-theme than Spectre's

**throwaway-7650** (7.7): rita ora to her career after Phoenix

**happyletuce06** (7.5): solid and iconic, nothing more to say here

**TiltControls** (7.5): the sound is gorgeous I just wish the actual song were a bit more interesting

**DefaultPophead** (7): Truly iconic. Sorry I can't score it higher.

# Actualy maybe don't

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it’s exciting a drag queen won and she sounds great, but like this song is snooze …

**Kaylaboe** (6): conchita slayed the hell out of this mid-ass song

**Smuckles** (6): I know my score isn't that high but I still like this more than most recent Bond songs

**vayyiqra** (6): Ngl I don't like this song but am being nicer to it because I want to support Conchita as a person.

**Awkward\_King** (5): iconic

**Imtotallyfine.jpg** (5): I’m sorry Conchita, but I don’t like ballads and that’s a me problem so there’s nothing wrong with your slightly boring song <3

**2dina3dworld** (3): the last.fm tags for this are… an experience!

**moonagenightmares** (3): really meh song tbh

**hannahspants** (0): I'm sorry. My least favourite song out of all the bunch. I just can't. It's a messy, boring song and the fact that everyone seems to love it makes me hate it even more. Conchita has an incredible voice but that alone can't save it for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I was so nervous for how this song was going to do in this rate. Verka is an absolute ICON in Eurovision, but Dancing Lasha Tumbai is by no mean the most conventional song in this rate, and I was fully prepared for this to leave in Day 1 from people who didn't get it. But to my surprise...Verka pulled it off! Even many people who weren't Eurovision fans doing this rate loved this song, and I'm so so happy this made top 5.

**racloves** (9): Ich liebe! Makes absolutely no sense, but that’s what makes it amazing.

---
# Camp enjoyers
**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): this…this is everything. This is what camp is all about. This is why we love camp people!!! This song is so over the top, silly eurodance I just adore it. The whole performance is weird and delightful that I want to live on the shiny silver space planet with these guys and jam to their eurodance polka.

**LesApfels** (11): This is the definitive Eurovision anthem I don't make the rules

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this song truly emobies everything I love about eurovision, it's catchy af, amazing outfits, great dacing, fun staging, charismatic performance, cheeky politics and it's absolutely camp. Phenomenal.

**Smuckles** (11): Aww I remember this one! The grin it gave me seeing this again. Prime Eurovision. This represents everything the competition is about, fuck your Loreen. You could skank to this VERY easily. This is Real music.

**2dina3dworld** (10): see this is an example of one half of my favourite Eurovision songs, the campy half dedicated to just being solely fun. Music doesn’t have to be serious to be good, and at least it isn’t another pop ballad.

**akanewasright** (10): if they remade Metropolis (1927) today, this is what the dancing scene would look like.

**apatel27** (10): Iconic

**Awkward\_King** (10): im so glad karlie kloss invented camp so this song could exist

**bigbigbee** (10): https://tenor.com/view/dancing-cat-glow-stick-cat-gif-15683985

**CarlieScion** (10): if u gave this below a 10 ur boring

**celladonn** (10): I hated this at first but I've seen the light and it's an absolute serve

**CrimsonROSET** (10): it’s camp your honor

**daretheghost** (10): TANZEN!

**DirtyRat583** (10): THIS PERFORMANCE ATEEEEEEEEEE

**frogaranaman** (10): this is camp

**GapeCod** (10): И-КО-НААААААА

**guy\_like\_u** (10): wow what a moment that is most pleasing to me

**iniekcja\_** (10): I don't know a better person

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): iconic

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): It's THE most famous Eurovision entry for a reason. People dismiss it as a joke, but the song is beyond catchy, the costumes are the most memorable the contest has ever seen, and Verka's cheeky charisma has enough stage presence to get everybody up on their feet. There is not a single flaw here.

**moonagenightmares** (10): peak eurovision

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): miss this in current eurovision SO BAD!!

**moooo566** (10): how this scores is going to be the ultimate test of whether popheads deserves to exist

**MrSwearword** (10): seriously, this is one of the best troll entries in Eurovision history and they gagged us with the fact this is a great song.

**noideawhatever** (10): why are ukraine always so fucking good. this country must be protected at all costs. FUCK YOU putin this will be playing when ukraine kicks your ass back to russia bald shithead.

**nootnoot781** (10): so many countries have tried so hard to get a joke entry as good as this one and failed. it’s just organically camp.

**plastichaxan** (10): come on THIS is camp, this is the camp i was hoping to see and they did it so well wow

**sirpancakeXI** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it

**skargardin** (10): I love how this pretty much encapsulates the kooky camp side of Eurovision in one song

**Stryxen** (10): verka an icon this is so drag

**thedoctordances1940** (10): how can this possibly be anything less than a 10

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): it doesn’t get more fun than this

**veryanniev** (10): simply iconic

**welcome2thejam** (10): Oh, this is a classic! Don't know much about Eurovision, but I do know every year needs an act with this kind of energy, even if few can match this

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): a staple at every Eurovision themed party

**you2009** (10): rocketman

**shhhneak** (9.3): Verka is the patron saint of Eurovision.

**awkward\_penguin** (9.2): I want to see...Russia goodbye

**seanderlust** (9.2): I don't even care that there's like 20 words in total in this song it fucking bangs

**afs** (9): RRRRRASHIA GUDBAI

**astrologicalangel** (9): this is what people think you mean when you say you're watching Eurovision

**criestotheclicking** (9): stupidly catchy - Verka is fun too

**jaztinax** (9): i hope this never gets forgotten as long as the world exists

**Melody** (9): one of the best joke songs of all time.

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): wait THIS is from eurovision?? how did i never realize. also unironically great

**speaknowred** (9): I listened to this at least every month

**TiltControls** (9): the tonal shift from the last one to this lmao

**ashandimlotion** (8.5): one of the most classic ESC moments of all time... should’ve won!

**happyletuce06** (8.5): an absolute icon

**Kaylaboe** (8.5): one of the most fun esc songs ever idc idc

**babadork** (8.3): This is a bop that deserves to be above the rules.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (8): Ukraine always brings the crazy.

**hannahspants** (8): its iconic, and actually a bop of a song, but I'm glad it didn't win.

**nt96** (8): it's camp shut up

**s2pd** (8): peak camp

**vayyiqra** (8): A fucking accordion on a dance track? Surely this is a bit. How is this good? Science cannot yet explain.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): omg this icon!!! Honestly this is camp and I don’t trust anyone who thinks otherwise

**thedoublebanana** (7.5): As a song, not great. As a performance, iconic.

**DefaultPophead** (7): This is the video you show people when they ask what Eurovision is.

**musical\_pyn** (6): I want to give this a zero and an eleven at the same time, now THIS is eurovision

# actually lasha tumbai is mongolian for "popheads goodbye"

**BebeLuigi** (5): When I started getting involved with the Eurovision fandom and the deeper side of it in like 2012/2013 I loved it a lot, but since it's then it kinda became the running joke that refuses to stop even when we have had enough qsdfsdfqsdf I'd feel bad giving it a score below average cuz I used to love it but now I'm just so over it

**emmaelf** (4.5): ICONIC. awful but iconic. i don't know if it'd be better or worse with more lyrics. if i was drunker, i'd give this at least two more points.

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (4): I’m way too harsh on joke entries, maybe I need to stop viewing them like actual songs 😩. I just don’t like the song I’m sorry, please don’t remove me from the fandom 👀

**cremeebrulee** (3): this was kind of annoying ngl

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): Is it iconic? Absolutely. Do I wanna listen? No comment.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I'm so fucking sorry Ukraine I promise I'll make it up to you with my scores for 1944 and SHUM I swear but this is just not good…

**RoyalBloodFool** (2): Ukraine loves to dance, sadly I don't

**throwaway-7650** (1.1): I'm thoroughly anti-entertained

**racloves** (10): this is my official proposal to Victoria De Angelis, please hit me up, I would be a great wife, we can have a little Italian wedding and Mika can officiate. I am on my knees for you

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Surprised? So was I. Måneskin is VERY controversial on popheads, mostly for their English songs which have become their most famous hits, rather than their songs in Italian, which is just a shame because Måneskin's Italian songs are 100x better than their English songs, this one included! There's a reason why they blew up literally overnight after winning Eurovision, in a way that hadn't seen since Celion Dion in the 80's, Måneskin just *gets* how to make a kick ass rock song. And yet, despite the fact that they made top 3, this was not a guaranteed placement *at all* for them in this rate. Just LOOK at that rate graph, they were spending the first half of this rate barely cracking Day 2 and even spent a bit of time in late Day 1! Watching this song slowly rise over the course of this rate was probably the most entertainment I've gotten in a while, and my only dissapointment is that this somehow didn't get even higher.

# Buonasera, signore e signori
**astrologicalangel** (11): I am a simp for every member of this fucking band

**Hogwartsreject1912** (11): Quite possibly my favorite winner ever.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): I get why this won, winners energy just emits from them

**noideawhatever** (11): damiano makes me question my demisexuality

**1998tweety** (10): the one group whos not a fad on this list

**2dina3dworld** (10): now, a lot of people know me as the person who has too many opinions on rock. Maneskin is controversial, and I feel like a lot of it stems from an expectation of rock as some sort of higher standard of “art” that borrows from a hallowed tradition of real rock musicians. Which is also a narrative repeated in many older genres. And even amongst people who like modern rock, Maneskin seems to be controversial as some sort of “derivative”. But what people miss is that music is intended for many different purposes, and sometimes it’s just intended to be dumb fun. Maneskin takes what’s missing from a lot of modern rock and makes it just silly fun. And you may ask me, doesn’t that apply to Machine Gun Kelly? Well, I can stand the Maneskin guys voice so that argument doesn’t hold any water. Just because your music is dumb fun doesn’t mean that it’s automatically excusable to be bad. It’s not fun when it’s unlistenable. Anyway, this song is just Party Rock Anthem for rock kids. Thank you for coming to my TEDtalk

**Awkward\_King** (10): seeing the success they've had post show has been so fucking cool, watching them win live was so epic and the heights they've reached since then it's wild it's only been a year

**bigbigbee** (10): listen, I played a lot of guitar hero as a kid. this score was predetermined

**celladonn** (10): Fuck yes

**cremeebrulee** (10): FUCK IT UP!!!!!

**criestotheclicking** (10): surprised that my favourite actually won for once. I wish they kept the outfits from the music video, ngl, but I can’t complain since they won in these ones.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I mean there’s a reason they were breakouts worldwide

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Fuck my life, this slayed me

**emmaelf** (10): powerful performance and fantastic stage presence. not sure when he breathed, lungs of steel. clothing apparently optional?

**frogaranaman** (10): being steelphobic by giving this a good score

**guy\_like\_u** (10): the power that has, the international implications that that has. I’m literally obsessed

**happyletuce06** (10): brought them ABBA level fame for a reason

**ImADudeDuh** (10): i know what everyone is gonna say, and I agree

**Kaylaboe** (10): where can i get myself an italian man

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): just an absolute banger

**moonagenightmares** (10): its been years since i loved a winner this much, and not only this song but maneskins discography in general (before they started releasing trash in english), i think its the first time that has happened so it was tempting to give this my 11

**MoonlightByWindow** (10): PERIOD! so glad this won, it reminded me why i love eurovision so much

**MrSwearword** (10): FINALLY Italy understood the assignment. A magnificent rock song.

**seanderlust** (10): JFC THIS GOES OFF!!!! okay maneskin made some points here

**shhhneak** (10): Eurovision hits different when your home country wins with your favourite song. I’m weirdly proud to see them blow up like they have.

**skargardin** (10): YAAS

**Smuckles** (10): Just a big ol' bowl of rock n' roll fun. Love the silly little Les Claypool-style dances they did across the stage. They can do all the lines of coke they want as far as I'm concerned, they deserve it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I will never not be mad that this kick-ass banger didn't really become a big thing in America but their super lame English songs somehow got all the radio play. Don't you just hate when that happens? cough cough BTS

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): Waking up early in the morning just to watch this win was a fantastic experience. I hadn't known what to expect, as I never watched any pre-show stuff, but my mind was blown. The effect has worn off a lot, but because of all the fond memories (I played it eight times that day) I have to give it this score.

**apatel27** (9.5): They jamming and I'm here for it

**iniekcja\_** (9.5): cutting off half a point for personal biases

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): like in tiktok I don't love the vocals but this is ✅

**speaknowred** (9.2): Refreshing

**afs** (9): they get hate but this is definitely a deserved win

**akanewasright** (9): I mean they did serve

**jaztinax** (9): don’t get too close to the table guys

**LunaMoonMeUp** (9): 2021 is, in my opinion, the strongest ever year of Eurovision. And Zitti e Buoni is a powerhouse of a track, that rightfully won. Outstanding showing from those rockers.

**Melody** (9): Ethan and Damiano were hot so 1 more point!

**TiltControls** (9): I really disliked beggin and I wanna be your slave, but this is actually really good

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): this is without a doubt their best song I have heard and deserved the win

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): I’m not a huge fan of these guys but they owned that stage

**BebeLuigi** (8): YESSSSSSSSSSSSSS Their charisma is out of this world

**nootnoot781** (8): deducting points because it gave us RAI hosting eurovision ❤️

**Stryxen** (8): HATE their music but this is unfortunately a great song

**welcome2thejam** (8): Walking a razor thin tightrope of rock, but I guess I come down in favor of it

**ZebraSun73** (8): Not a huge fan of the song (the chorus is a bit dull and repetitive, his voice is a bit too nasal for my liking) but their performance? A 10.

**Martin1009** (7.5): Is it your favourite, or are you just horny?

**plastichaxan** (7.5): ugggh i wanted to tank them so bad but y'all had to choose their only good song i hate it here

**s2pd** (7.5): It has a certain groove

**CarlieScion** (7): fun!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This isn’t bad but I still think a lot of y’all are just dickmatized

**hannahspants** (7): I get it they're sexy but come onnnn there were better songs in the 2021 cohort

TakeOnMeByA-ha: # People who probably tanked this song because it's the "Beggin" band
**GapeCod** (6): something about eurovision artists whose names start with Mån makes people overrate them

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (6): I’m going to be hunted for this but it’s not that great. I suppose it’s a good rock song but that’s really not my genre 😬

**sirpancakeXI** (6): my love for this song dropped steadily after the show ended

**daretheghost** (5): There is nothing particularly interesting or groundbreaking about a by-the-numbers rock song with one guitar riff repeating for 3 and a half minutes.

**ashandimlotion** (4.5): is it a bit fun and sexy? Perhaps... but the fact that it won against some of the best songs of all Eurovision history boggles me. On top of that, maneskin becoming the big ESC global success story of recent times and not say Loreen or Jamala hurts a lot. My heart is refusing it!

**flavasavavandal** (4): The fact that Eurovision made this band into legit superstars is still baffling to me. Just listen to music from 45 years ago guys

**thedoublebanana** (4): I can appreciate the song, but it's not for me.

**thedoctordances1940** (3.7): i genuinely do like the verses but yeah the hook just is not good at all

**Uberpigeon** (3): i do not understand their hype

**vayyiqra** (1): Why did it feel like last year was nonstop Måneskin discourse? Was it controversial that they won somehow? I find this really unappealing and have zero interest in them. Is this a hot take? Idk but I know I don't like this at all. I like rock; I do not like this.

**racloves** (10): no explanation needed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If there was any song in this rate I was rooting for as an underdog victor, it was definetely this one. Shum is a fan favorite among Eurovision fans, and it's not hard at all to see why. It's a perfect blend between tradtional Ukrainian folk music and modern techno, and the end result is maybe the most unique entry the contest has ever seen. And of course, you can't talk about Shum without also bringing up the presense of one Kateryna Pavlenko, whose voice and presense elevates this song to an even higher degree of excelence. It might not have won the rate, but this song has already won the hearts of fans everywhere, and if anyone was to come to second place to Euphoria, I'm glad Go_A were the ones to pull it off.

**2dina3dworld** (11): this was the song that convinced me that Eurovision could be good. I know, it’s a bad assumption to assume that Eurovision has never produced a single good song, but the only performances I had seen were the ones that didn’t exactly cast Eurovision in the best light. I don’t remember quite how I stumbled upon this song, but I’m half sure I was watching videos of performances with my flatmate when this song came up. This song hooked me instantly! I loved how the song sped up as it continued on, I loved how it borrowed from traditional music, and I just loved how dark and tense it was. And I still do! It’s a beautiful song and I’m proud to 11 it.

**bigbigbee** (11): powerful lady…I love how ominous this sounds while also being about spring coming. it feels sort of like an “old gods” atmosphere: nature, but in a dark, cool, almost creepy way. I liked this from the moment I heard it, and it’s only grown on me since

**cremeebrulee** (11): did this rate so i could 11 this xx shoutout to the popheads chart videos for putting me on cause they hit the slay button with this one

**LunaMoonMeUp** (11): This song has EVERYTHING I want from a Eurovision entry. I want it to feel traditional, whilst also sounding modern and fresh to today's audiences. I want it to feel truly unique and not have been done before. I want it to be a celebrtation of a countries culture, and preferably sung in their own language. SHUM ticks every single box for me, and is a rollercoaster of a song I just want to ride over and over again. On top of being my favourite Eurovision track of all time, it's probably also my favourite song of all time - period. Truly, a masterpiece.

**nootnoot781** (11): did everything they needed to do. perfect staging, perfect song, perfect performance. kateryna pavlenko you will always be famous

**nt96** (11): this is THE ultimate track for slut dropping and ass throwing, It has three different speeds at your disposal as well as short little breaks in case you need a second wind. I'm NOT taking any second opinions, now twerk like the rent is due!

**ZebraSun73** (11): To say that this song lives rent free in my head would be an understatement. We are lockdown flatmates and cannot escape each other. Shum has refurbished my brain. It is now a place of worship to our god, Kateryna Pavlenko. No thoughts. Only siyu siyu siyu siyu konopelechky siyu siyu siyu siyu zelenesen'ki

**apatel27** (10): Everything about this is amazing

**ashandimlotion** (10): obscenely fantastic

**Awkward\_King** (10): i want to go hard to this song at a rave fucked up on some shit that hasnt even been invented yet

**CarlieScion** (10): should have won what an awesome song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is when you toss everything at the wall and somehow (?) it all lands

**daretheghost** (10): BANGER

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): This was just an electro-folk bop

**DefaultPophead** (10): This song changed my life. I'm not being dramatic. Staging? Captivating. And is that a jaw harp I hear?

**guy\_like\_u** (10): Totally unique, totally never been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference

**happyletuce06** (10): 2nd place in the televote for a reason, catchy and rave-able

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): SLAVIC FOREST RAVE

**iniekcja\_** (10): This was an actual cultural reset, this song alone has so much influence on how the competition will change in the next few years, it's honestly unreal

**jaztinax** (10): the ukraine entry that could’ve had it all

**Melody** (10): The LEGEND.

**moonagenightmares** (10): western phers u better not tank this

**moooo566** (10): where else are you going to hear ukrainian electrofolk? this is what it's all about.

**noideawhatever** (10): omg ukrainian bjork. if she did this in any other year she would've won tbh what a queen. slava ukraini and FUCK vladimir putin.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is the sexiest thing I've ever seen in my life

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): is this hyperfolk?!

**sirpancakeXI** (10): Queen

**skargardin** (10): I was never expecting to hear this type of sound in eurovision but we love to hear it

**Stryxen** (10): this is just the coolest song that’s been on eurovision for a long long time

**thedoublebanana** (10): I'm sorry to the maneskin stans, but this should've won. The blend of traditional vibes with the rave it just perfrection. The original is better than the eurovision version but both are stellar.

**TiltControls** (10): this is dance dance revolution coded

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): SHUM is I think a good example of why the American Song Contest won’t work. While there’s lots of mainstream Western-style pop in Eurovision, there’s still tons of songs showcasing traditional and folk music from all the different participants, and then you have amazing songs like this one that can effortlessly bridge the gap between the two and make something amazing! America is just too monocultural for that kind of diversity. Unless we start seeing stuff like Bluegrass, Zydeco, or uh any Native American music, our Eurovision will be nothing more than another American Idol clone…

**whatyourheartdesires** (10): my faves last year

**speaknowred** (9.6): ART

**celladonn** (9.5): Genuinely so good

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): kateryna pavlenko i would die for u

**thedoctordances1940** (9.4): ou this is cunty

**afs** (9): Nightcore performances let's GO

**akanewasright** (9): this makes me want to dance in ways that no one should ever dance

**BebeLuigi** (9): The end of it is absolutely breathtaking, the people running on the LED especially wow

**Martin1009** (9): This even got the straights go crazy

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): this song grew on me. I don’t even know what to say other than I love it

**vayyiqra** (9): Really trying to be neutral when it comes to Ukrainian and Russian songs for the sake of this rate but this is just a straight-up banger I am happy to say, so that was irrelevant. It even overcame one of my biggest pet peeves, songs that change tempo a lot.

**throwaway-7650** (8.8): folk but make it house (edit: the wiki genres for this being dark-techno and folk help... anyway stream LESSERAFIM the great mermaid!)

**criestotheclicking** (8): this really grew on me once I saw it on stage. Kateryna is also an absolutely mesmerising performer. Ukraine really doesn't miss.

**s2pd** (8): If it weren't for Eurovision, who knew something like this would exist?

**Smuckles** (8): This is what people who don't listen to Bjork think Bjork sounds like

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): the tempo up was nice I guess

**1998tweety** (7): payolad win but its decent, tiktok smasha.

**emmaelf** (7): i like what feels like the more traditional elements of this. the merge with modern dance music takes away some of that for me.

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): i’m obsessed with her entire look

**veryanniev** (7): I’m in a minority of people who prefer Stefania to this lol

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the production slaps, I just don’t like their voices a ton

TakeOnMeByA-ha: # the juries

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i’m still in disbelief that a song and artist with these names and stylings is not a kpop song

**shhhneak** (4.5): This benefited from amazing staging an a wild performance but I just don’t love the song. Sorry!

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): why did I assume this was gonna be a Kpop group based off of the artist name… actually this could totally be an NCT title track

**hannahspants** (4): I adore Go_A. Solovey was my fave song from 2020, and I have some of their other music saved too. I really liked Шум (pre revamp) but couldn't quite get myself to like this one.

**seanderlust** (3.8): sorry I don't like the instrumentals on this one

**MrSwearword** (3): it's loony, but this is too lowgrade memeshit for me to truly enjoy. I know it's popular but I do not care.

**frogaranaman** (1): well I'm glad when this song ended, I'll say that much!

**racloves** (10): ICONIC. If you didn’t give this song a 10 your European status is revoked sorry not sorry. Congrats to our well deserved rate winner! It only makes sense that this won, as it’s pretty much the most well known 21st century Eurovision winner. I hope you are all feeling very euphoric at this result

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): The winner everyone saw coming from a mile away, but can you even be mad about it? There's a reason why Euphoria is still considered the greatest Eurovision song of all time even 10 years after its victory, it's just a simply *euphoric* pop song. The production still sounds as fresh today as it did in 2012 and Loreen's vocals are flawless and fit the vibe perfectly. While I do think it's slightly overrated, I can't deny that it's objectively fantastic, and a well deserved winner for this rate. And yeah, nothing else got even remotely close to beating it. Shum was its only real competition, and even at its closest Euphoria still had a 30 point lead. This song rocketed to first place after just a few ballots and never left it afterwards, and deservedly so. Congratulations to our rate winner!

# :pretendstobeshocked:
**DirtyRat583** (11): EUPHOOOOOOOOOOOOOORIYASS!!!!! rate winner i know it (disclaimer i dont know it please dont quote me on this)

**TiltControls** (11): another entry for the charity rate to winners pipeline??

**Awkward\_King** (10): this deserves to win with a 12 average. im not giving it my 11 because i have a more personal connection to other songs but in my mind this is THE eurovision song and it deserves the world

**daretheghost** (10): This will probably win, and it’s a worthy winner. But I’d like to be surprised.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): yea if this wins I can’t be mad

**DevilsOfLoudun** (10): we all know Euphoria is going to win and deservedly so. Best song to come out of eurovision this century.

**jaztinax** (10): i just know this is going to win

**Martin1009** (10): She really is the blueprint, I expect it to win the rate

**nootnoot781** (10): the most predictable rate winner of all time but it’s very deserving! the song, the staging, the live vocals… it’s so effortlessly beautiful

**plastichaxan** (10): this is winning the rate and im at peace with that

**2dina3dworld** (9): I’m fine with this winning but it’s a bit too 2010s electro without the fun for me

**ignitethephoenix** (9): oh yeah this has winners energy

**cremeebrulee** (8): she's cute but i would be underwhelmed w this winning

**Smuckles** (7): This is winning, right? I feel like this is the popularist choice since it's the one that doesn't sound like a Eurovision song. BOO! In the true spirit of Eurovision the winner should be a polka-techno nightmare, not this technically proficient song!

# Euphoric

**flavasavavandal** (11): This song just makes me feel proud to be from the continent of Europe

**GapeCod** (11): How could it be anything else, honestly? The whole of Baku applauding Loreen in the first 20 seconds of her performance... iconic. Deserves a 10+ average, let's be real.. Literally the best post-ABBA winner and it's not even close (My Number One and Fairytale are almost there).

**ImADudeDuh** (11): i mean? Hello? Shes a legend, shes an icon, and she is the moment

**itsabop** (11): Really goes without saying, this song IS Eurovision

**Melody** (11): Eurovision IS euphoria!

**MrSwearword** (11): Sure it's cliche to do so, but duh this deserves top marks.

**shhhneak** (11): This was my first Eurovision and it still remains as the greatest Eurovision song of all time. The way Loreen changed the landscape and had the other girlies try to imitate her.

**skargardin** (11): I went back and forth on a couple of 11 choices but it feels apt to give this its rightful flowers on the 10th anniversary

**akanewasright** (10): I died

**ashandimlotion** (10): changed the mf game, and is the best ESC ever, but I just need to give my 11 to a more fun choice sorry @loreen

**awkward\_penguin** (10): Perfection. Not only one of the best songs to ever be sent to Eurovision, but flawless performance by Loreen. Vocals, check. Dancing, check. Emotions, check. Everything is just done perfectly - the other dancer, the lighting, the camera work.

**BebeLuigi** (10): This is still amazing even ten years later...

**criestotheclicking** (10): this is an amazing performance. I don’t know how Loreen made an EDM song sound so beautiful but she managed it! I also really love the bit with the male dancer.

**emmaelf** (10): look it's objectively a banger. it started what feels like its own genre of eurovision songs. i like it in spite of it being very of its time.

**frogaranaman** (10): why do I feel like RuPaul has this as their top listened song of 2012

**guy\_like\_u** (10): This is it. This is the song that forever changed eurovision. Everything that followed is influenced by Euphoria. Lorene is the mother of modern Eurovision and permanently changed what a Eurovision entry should be. This still sounds fresh today and would win in almost any year it was entered. A genuinely great dance pop song that just happens to also have been entered into Eurovision.

**hannahspants** (10): pure class. Everything about this performance was amazing.

**happyletuce06** (10): i mean do i even have to say anything, it's so loved for a reason

**Imtotallyfine.jpg** (10): I wish I could also give 11 to this because it doesn’t deserve anything less than 11. I don’t like bare feet on stage but I’ll make an exception for Loreen.

**iniekcja\_** (10): icon

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): THEE Eurovision song

**LunaMoonMeUp** (10): The modern turning point for Eurovision, where a casual audience will actually admit that they like a song from the contest. A truly phenomenal song and performance.

**moooo566** (10): i'll defend others as being better eurovision songs, but yeah okay this is the best actual song to come out of eurovision, and i do love how she's extremely kate bush about the whole thing.

**noideawhatever** (10): what in the pop perfection is this and how wasn't this a smash hit worldwide???

**RoyalBloodFool** (10): You'll just hear it if it's Sweden

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I thought it was just a cute dance pop song before I saw the performance, now I get why Loreen is a Eurovision legend

**sirpancakeXI** (10): this still gives me goosebump after all this time

**speaknowred** (10): WOW

**Stryxen** (10): it’s like… too perfect…. But it’s still perfect

**thedoctordances1940** (10): yeah just a ridiculously good song, not much more to say

**vayyiqra** (10): a jam !

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Okay I get the hype

**veryanniev** (10): If I was solely rating the song I don’t think I would give it a higher rating than 8 because of how overplayed it is - but because I’ve rewatched the finale performance I’m giving it a 10. Loreen is simply entrancing, and this is definitely a case of a live performance taking the song to the next level.

**ZebraSun73** (10): Changed everything. 10 years has passed and it is still as good as it was in 2012. 10 instead of 11 simply because it would against the spirit of the contest to give the highest score to my own country.

**Kaylaboe** (9.5): objectively speaking one of the best eurovision songs of all time. but there's imo better songs in this rate so 9.5 has to suffice

**afs** (9): outsold RIRI

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me when someone asks where you’re you think you’re going with that outfit and they go ‘not dressed like this you aren’t’ and they put me in a sexy sexy outfit and are like ‘yassss’

**nt96** (9): easily outsold Zenyatta and that flop show

**Organic\_Volume\_1426** (9): nothing much to say. My non Eurovision friends know this. Loreens impact 🥵

**welcome2thejam** (9): Late 2000s/Early 2010s EDM called, they said "wow that's rad as hell"

**DefaultPophead** (8.8): I kept adjusting this score higher and higher. Gorgeous :)

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i originally had a snarky comment here but you know what, this song is better than i remember it being

**Uberpigeon** (8): team maddie

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): praying the Sam Levinson haters have a bias going into this one

**s2pd** (7.5): great song, but the vocal performance is a bit disappointing

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): last time we rated this I tanked it and said it was “Celine Dion singing a Calvin Harris track” but I’ve come around on it a bit since then, can’t say that I love it though

**thedoublebanana** (7): I never understood the hype behind this song. It's a good song, but it's not as epic as everyone makes it out tobe.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): her hand movements in this are so funny

**throwaway-7650** (7): lorde stole from this for her sick interpretive dance /neg

MrSwearword: Great job on the reveal, it filled me with *Euphoria*

TakeOnMeByA-ha: One more thing before we leave...with 30 different countries being repesented in this rate, it's only natural to wonder who performed the best overall. So, after calcuating the results of all the songs from each country, here is your list of the countries with the highest overall averages in this rate!

(Note: countries that are **bolded** are countries that only had one song to represent them in this rate, and as such their scores are heavily inflated by how well/poor their one song did)

1. **Austria**: 8.258
2. Ukraine : 8.131
3. **Australia**: 7.894
4. **Serbia**: 7.618
5. **Finland**: 7.564
6. Greece: 7.444
7. Norway: 7.441
8. Italy: 7.440
9. Cyprus: 7.346
10. Sweden: 7.254
11. **Moldova**: 7.180
12. Turkey: 7.060
13. France: 6.967
14. Iceland: 6.892
15. **Switzerland**: 6.751
16. Belgium: 6.700
17. **Germany**: 6.662
18. Bulgaria: 6.655
19. Latvia: 6.592
20. Denmark: 6.463
21. The Netherlands: 6.405
22. Russia: 6.088
23. **Poland**: 5.997
24. Estonia: 5.956
25. **Israel**: 5.798
26. **Czech Republic**: 5.785
27. Azerbaijan: 5.774

shhhneak: I did not expect Shum to get 2nd but Euphoria was an obvious (deserved) win. Catch me supporting my girl in Winners 3.

TiltControls: Great job to Kurp and racloves for such a great rate! My placements were all over the place but I had a hell of a great time scoring!

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

##**Songs**

Congrats to **Euphoria** for the win today! It sits at 212th overall on the averages leaderboard for all songs. It ties in spot with Kylie Minogue's All the Lovers and just a bit ahead of it is Paramore's Rose Colored Boy. And fitting for one of the hosts, it sits one spot ahead of A-ha's Take On Me.

Euphoria also becomes the 4th song sent to Charity Rate I to win a rate after being first rated in that rate (it placed 14th there)! (Other winners from that rate include Heaven Is A Place on Earth, Dancing On My Own, Simple and Clean). This causes it to surpass Charity Rate II's previously tied record of 3 (American Boy, Fast Car, Immaterial)

One other song got a leaderboard spot today and that is Amar Pelos Dois which comes 22nd for highest controversy across all songs! With the new addition it means there's one less version of Work From Home on the controversy board (they still have the #6 spot for their original rate performance).

##**Artists**

No updates here, especially in a fairly specific grab bag like this

For those curious though, the only artists from the rate we'd rated before were Loreen (Charity I), Maneskin (Tiktok), and Getter Jaani (Eurovision I)

##**Rates**

The rate just barely manages to miss the bottom 10 for rate averages by 0.002. It sits at the 11th lowest spot

The rate does take a leaderboard spot for highest % of 0's used, where 79.38% of the participants used theirs! Overall it is 9th across all rates for that stat

GapeCod: How well did Euphoria fare in the "biggest score gap between winner and first alternate" statistic? The almost 0.6 difference seems impressive!
[/r/popheads/comments/v0gp6t/21st_century_eurovision_rate_reveal_day_3_it/iaj6jd6/]

=====

TiltControls: It is! With a gap of 0.583 it'd be 6th overall for that stat. The ones above it would be 

Praying beating Learn to Let Go by 0.847

Your Best American Girl beating Cruel by 0.773

Mr. Brightside beating The Scientist by 0.686

How Will I Know beating Time After Time by 0.601

The Mother We Share beating Our Own House by 0.600
