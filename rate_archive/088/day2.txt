MrMoodle: I think Sicko Mode, Nice For What, Hotline Bling and Work will probably survive the day. One Dance is boring and might be in danger.

I feel like Posty's gonna keep Sunflower and hopefully Better Now. His other stuff is definitely looking shaky.

Uptown Funk, Locked Out of Heaven and *probably* That's What I like should be safe imo.

edit: alright i was pretty spot on except for better now. was not expecting that absolutely post malone slaughtering.

MrMoodle: lmao you're probably right about that tbh. That being said, there weren't all that many women on the top 100 anyway, so I don't think our hatred of men will become *really* evident until the top 40 or so.

Hotline Bling was the one I was most doubting, especially because of lines like "used to always stay at home, be a good girl" which, like, fair enough, yikes. But I dunno, there's still so much general mediocrity left that it might make the cut.

**[All scores](https://pastebin.com/sZTV1T5V)**

---

**ExtraEater** (10): I’m *really* confused at how this is here and DJ Got Us Fallin’ In Love, which is leagues better and much more familiar, doesn’t take its place. Perhaps I really am that young, but I only ever remember hearing DJ back then and never this one. Regardless, it’s a bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O oh my god. Sidenote: Remember when they needed to make a radio edit of this that said “Oh My Gosh?” Evangelicals need to be stopped.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): Usher’s clearly going through a mid-life crisis here oof.

---

**selegend** (10): points for i did it again so imma let the beat rock

**1998tweety** (9): Massive bop. I don't really like the bit in the chorus where it sounds like there's 5 or so guys making weird whisper scream sounds, but besides that it bops.

**nightjesus** (9): Yo Raymond vs Raymond was such a good album. Bop after bop after bop.

**vapourlomo** (9): My nostalgia clouds my judgement on this one, sorry. BOOBIES LIKE POW POW POW!

**waluigiest** (9): I don’t even know what this song is about but I go batshit when it plays. I didn’t know that music that came out when you were 13 has that effect, but it does.

**starlightzone** (8.8): Usher just gives me the good feelings I love when I hear him. Sometimes I forget just how good he is. He’s smooth, slick, and definitely got the right voice for a song like this.

**bandnitos** (8): o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o o oh my god yes i counted out the os

**rhyneston3** (8): I’m giving this an 8 because it looks like a pair of boobies (wow oh wow)

**wavingwolves** (8): idk i just i love usher's energy

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I remember when I use to love this song...lol

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.7): (#53) This is the only song I had to fully relisten for this rate, because I remembered NOTHING about it.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): Usher has maybe the best voice in pop music, why doesn’t this song use it?

**bespectacIed** (6): meh bop

**themagicwemade** (6): this was right next to havana and i thought it was Camila's OMG for a second so i gave it a 10 until i went back and reread everything

**timothy444** (6): Incredibly average

**survivorthrowaway5** (5.7): forgotten

**ggal2020** (5): I literally don’t think I’ve ever heard this song before

**starla\_** (5): wow this aged badly

**Xanleth** (5): It’s fine.

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): Decent "oooooh" main hook and production is let down by head-scratching song structure and mediocre Usher and even more mediocre will.i.am feature

**anothertown** (4): The saddest little snare i have ever heard

**FrankBedbroken** (4): the production just feels lifeless for the most part and it's lyrically super corny

**runaway3212** (4): No thanks.

**skargardin** (4): I don't think I've heard this before but it's.. a mess

**vayyiqra** (4): While I am intrigued what a "booty like pow pow pow" is exactly, this song is pretty bad. I like the melodies and the instrumentals, but the lyrics are so, so bad that they ruin it. The random chanting and clapping doesn't add anything either. This is so mediocre, and it's frustrating because there is a good song in here somewhere - it's just not the song they released.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): i have genuinely never heard of this song before this rate

**bloupp** (3): This was right after Havana so at first I thought it was OMG by Camila (which is way better than this one for what it's worth)

**steelstepladder** (3): This song is so of it's time it's kind of amazing

**hikkaru** (2): i haven't heard this song in so long but it's kinda shit... it goes nowhere

**ManofOranges** (2): Did they forget that part of you have to kind of mix up the way the song sounds throughout so that it doesn't get incredibly boring and repetitive. The whole time while I was listening, I was waiting for something, anything to happen in order to end my boredom and that my moment never came. There's nothing going on in this song, it's the textbook definition of a flat line.

**ReallyCreative** (2): This song sucks like wow oh wow

**rslashpoopheads** (2): We will be leaving this one in the past.

**fadedblue09** (1): RIP Usher, aka the original Britney Jean

**FKJVMMP** (1): The worst song Usher has ever made.

**Mudkip1** (1): so many of these songs are so fucking vapid i can't stand the GP

**palengard389** (1): Usher can do better

jackisboredtoday: u/ImADudeDuh you just reminded me of the "oh my gosh" edit omg.... i remember when i was in middle school my music teacher played this song and singled out that edit as a positive example of not swearing... then I promptly got in trouble later that class for playing Stereo Hearts of all things, which was apparently too raunchy for her somehow

**ExtraEater** (10): This song's lyrics are just plain corny, but I do enjoy listening to it. He really improves the Sting sample

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): I’m still not at all a fan of this song, but it’s so tragic to listen to now. This man was genuinely hurting.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Oof. I never liked this song. I hate his delivery, I hate the obviously 19 year old lyrics, I hate the production. I just don’t like the song and I feel like this is really gonna get overrated in the next decade in the critic circles.

---

**bandnitos** (10): this goes off so hard

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): :(

**bespectacIed** (9): I may not be a fan of emo-rap but this is genuinely sad and surprisingly WELL-SUNG. RIP Juice, drug addiction sucks.

**runaway3212** (9): This is not how lucid dreams work, but that adds to this song imo.

**starlightzone** (9): I think there’s something really powerful and heavy on this song and I think it’s really fucking beautiful. I don’t know why but it makes me feel something I wasn’t prepared for. It’s really something quite stunning.

**timothy444** (9): In hindsight, it's a bit twisted how such a depressing song like this manages to be a hit which says a lot about society. Still, it would be disrespectful to give this a low score considering that everything just falls into place and works, from the sampling to the lyrics to the downer mood throughout the whole song. I guess it's relatable to Gen Z and millennials?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.8): I didn’t like this song at first but it’s grown on me a lot.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This sounds pretty nice tbh. The lyrics are a little incel-y but at least this song is pleasing.

**hunnybee12** (8): :(

**ManofOranges** (8): Pleasantly catchy but I think the lyrics are kinda creepy.

**rhyneston3** (8): RIP king

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Love this vibe.

**stickywheels46** (8): r.i.p, Juice was talented

**Tolk1en** (8): Shape of my heart is such a masterpiece that I'm instantly giving this a quite high note. Juice WRLD work based on this song is interesting, I expected worse.

**megm26** (7.4): rest in peace

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): (RIP Juice) Hit or miss lyrics, singing is fine but the dark instrumental accentuated by the bass beats is good

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): I’ve grown to appreciate this song a lot more after Juice’s passing

**waluigiest** (7): this was a cultural moment that I just completely missed

**rickikardashian** (6.7): i know it has probably been said a million times but truly it does bother me that he says "lucid dreams where I can't move a thing", bro that's just a normal dream

**fadedblue09** (6.6): Was expecting a more atmospheric song, but not too bad.

**MrMoodle** (6.5): “who knew evil girls have the prettiest face” wow juice, very deep, rly makes u think. Fun song to sing along to, but maybe that’s just my nostalgia for mid-2000s emo talking. No disrespect to Juice WRLD, obviously, but the song has its issues.

**DrunkHurricane** (6): I hope people don't inflate their scores for this just because Juice WRLD is dead because this song is not good at all

**poppinmmolly** (6): RIP but eh

**vayyiqra** (6): I don't have a comment here but RIP Juice WRLD

**InternetDude19** (5.8): He is describing sleep paralysis, not lucid dreaming. Unacceptable.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.5): (#67) The term he's looking for is sleep paralysis. When you wake up but you can't move. Sleep paralysis.

**letsallpoo** (5): fuck yellowcard

**ReallyCreative** (5): I'm not a fan of the delivery or the production but it's still somehow not that bad? I feel like giving it a lower score but it doesn't really deserve it

**TragicKingdom1** (5): first out?

**camerinian** (4): rip and all but God this is whiny

**CritneySpearz** (4): depressing to listen to posthumously, but it’s still boring sry!

**FrankBedbroken** (4): very much incelcore music, but at least it's funny

**skargardin** (4): I've never been able to get into Juice's music, it just does nothing for me

**FKJVMMP** (3): It sounds pleasant enough but this is at least Blurred Lines-level creepy and weird, if not worse.

**hikkaru** (3): this is so overdramatic

**kappyko** (2): no insensitive comments please but i dont like this song

**nightjesus** (2): No disrespect, I just can’t get into it. The guitar strum sounds familiar though.

**steelstepladder** (2): I still really dislike this song even though I don't hate Juice as an artist

**Xanleth** (2): I never really listened to Juic WRLD before this and this certainly doesn’t make me want to now.

**ExtraEater** (10): It's good

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): It’s alright. Daya is an empty husk of a singer though.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I remember I read a comment somewhere when this song first came out that said something like “this will be the i

---

**palengard389** (10): Perfect balance of melancholy and dance

**Roxieloxie** (10): This song goes really hard when they're playing it a the TCS shows

**timothy444** (10): The drop may be annoying on each subsequent listen but Daya's vocals show a sense of desperation and emotion being forced out of her and it meshes well together against the buildup for each drop. I think of it as a story where each drop is just noise until the final (and best) drop where she overcomes her problem of insecurity. If this song doesn't get Top 30 in the rate reveal then r/popheads is officially cancelled for bad taste.

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): queen Daya deserves better

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): The guitar riff and Daya's vocals are so good.

**bespectacIed** (9): One of the best EDM songs from this era. That drop is PRISTINE.

**runaway3212** (9): Just great

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.8): this song makes me like it more than it has the right to

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): Ngl, this is a great chainsmokers track. The chorus (?) just feels so pleasing. Daya was a great fit for it and I’m sad that it didn’t bring her anymore notoriety in the music world. At least they got that Grammy. I know they wanted Rihanna, but I don’t think it would’ve worked as well. She was perfect for Calvin/Taylor’s song.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Aged. It's still a bop but I don't really listen to it at all anymore.

**starlightzone** (8.5): This is no Closer but I think the song has some strength and power to it. I think The Chainsmokers know what the fuck they’re doing and bring out some good vocals in their features.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): the drop is dated for sure, but I think Daya really carries the song well

**Jexan13** (8): The song until the drop: 10; the drop: 4

**rhyneston3** (8): Daya deserved more, insomnia and new were such great songs

**bandnitos** (7): their last good song

**Entire-Reflection** (7): honestly don’t mind this one

**vayyiqra** (7): When I saw Marina last fall, Daya opened for her and I found her so boring I just went outside during her set lol. While her voice doesn't stand out, I kind of like this song. The Chainsmokers may be basic but we can't say they are totally without talent.

**waluigiest** (7): I honestly had no idea this was the chainsmokers!! It’s too long but I like it

**megm26** (6.9): dolemi down

**InternetDude19** (6): I rather be listening to Roses.

**ManofOranges** (6): I listened to this song non stop in the summer of 2016. I was absolutely in love with it then. But I certainly don't listen to it non stop now and for good reason too.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): I literally never knew this was a Chainsmokers song until this rate

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Daya's performance is forgettable, would have been mostly okay if not for the awful breakdown

**bulforster** (4): The drops are atrocious.

**ReallyCreative** (4): bizarre vocal delivery and an obnoxious chorus hamstring an otherwise interesting song

**Xanleth** (4): This song is let down by the drop.

**hikkaru** (3): even as a chainsmokers fan the drop is horrid, the hardwell remix outsold

**nightjesus** (3): I really find this type of EDM super boring and annoying.

**skargardin** (3): No

**steelstepladder** (3): Oh Daya. You make Bebe Rexa look like she has a personality

**camerinian** (2): farty ass drop and farty ass Daya. Glad this song's been forgotten, just like Daya has. Fuck Daya was terrible

**fadedblue09** (2): Sorry but this is worse than Closer

**vapourlomo** (2): Ughhh this drop is ear-splittingly awful

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#93) what the fuck is going on here on this day

**FrankBedbroken** (1): absolutely godawful drop, boring uninspired buildup and vocals

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): why did you remind me of this song’s existence

**themagicwemade** (1): i think this is like one of the worst edm songs ever

**wavingwolves** (1): this kind of sounds like every other song by them but worse

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Twenty One Pilots is a good band!!! Vessel and their Self Titled albums are great depression albums. I just wish that they didn’t have that huge and annoying as hell fanbase in 2016 where all their fans started using that o with a slash through it for no goddamn reason. They still make good music that isn’t always r/Im14AndThisIsDeep and I will defend them to my 52nd to last dying breath.

**ExtraEater** (8): Catchy hook, terrible lyrics (and it’s the kind of terrible lyrics you can’t ignore, unfortunately). They’ve got a pretty good atmosphere going on, too. Shame

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I’m surprised this doesn’t get a ton of airplay and streams around Halloween. It’s the perfect Halloween song.

---

**bandnitos** (10): still slaps

**CreepyMannequin** (10): call me emo but I love this song

**Jexan13** (10): quisiera ser como la jarli kuin

**nightjesus** (10): I only saw this movie because TOP did this song. The video clip got me hyped for it. The movie was okay. Wasn’t Marvel level but it was enjoyable.

**GiftoftheGeek** (9): Better than the movie it's on the soundtrack of

**palengard389** (9): The ending is the best part no question about it

**timothy444** (9): Stressed Out shoulda been in the Top 100 as well but whatever, Heathens still bops

**camerinian** (8): this is the only good movie trailer song

**muchopartymuchomoney** (8): twenty one pilots' only good song

**runaway3212** (8): This song tricked me into thinking suicide squad would be good.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): these lyrics are kinda garbage but this goes off so...much to think about

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): kind of shook this one of the biggest songs of the decade, would have not guessed

**starlightzone** (7.5): I think it’s just fine. I bopped heavily when it came out but as time has gone on it’s been less kind to this song than it has been to others.

**ManofOranges** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mL2E7CLkXh8

**Roxieloxie** (7): yall kinda made me embarressed to like TØP on main now, this isnt their best song but i sang my ass of when i heard this live

**rslashpoopheads** (7): haha im so emo ahaha did i mention im emo ahahaha

**waluigiest** (7): once I allegedly won tickets to see them from a startup but they never gave them to me :/

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.5): (#56) Of course THIS is the song by them that gets here. Sigh.

**1998tweety** (6): It really is a shame that this is their only song here. I wouldn't call this a bad song but I got bored of it extremely quickly and there aren't any particular bits I'm a fan of.

**skargardin** (6): At least the SS soundtrack was quite good

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah no I don't get this band. This is an interesting song, sure, but I don't really like it.

**InternetDude19** (5.2): The frog ribbit sounds the guitars are making just make me wish I was listening to Creep.

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Pretty mediocre chorus, pretty decent breakdown in the last third of the track but otherwise pretty forgettable

**hikkaru** (5): kinda boring sorry...

**FrankBedbroken** (4): the few tracks i've heard from top i've just not liked except for levitate, maybe i should check out trench

**rhyneston3** (4): This is the TOP song that made it?

**vapourlomo** (4): Don't hate TOP, but this one doesn't work for me

**Xanleth** (4): Suicide Squad lol.

**steelstepladder** (3): More like all my friends are heathens this song blows

**fadedblue09** (2.8): This is their biggest hit?? Yikes.

**anothertown** (2): I hate this band but i respect that teens love them

**bespectacIed** (2): So bad. Stressed Out deserved its spot I thought it was more successful than this

**Popfan2489** (1): cant remember the song

**rickikardashian** (1): this is the most obnoxious attempt at a creepy, unsettling song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): white boys shouldnt be allowed to rap. post malone can stay but he’s on thin fucking ice

**ReallyCreative** (0): an offense against music, I cannot stand this band. The lyrics are gutter trash, desperately trying to be important/prolific, the production is a mess, the vocals are ANNOYING to no end, and this describes every 21 poolets song, not just this one

**ExtraEater** (9): Well, it could be worse. In another universe, This Is How We Do is here instead. I love the way she sings “that sound”

**ImADudeDuh** (7): is it bland? Yeah. Is it a bop? Kinda! It definitely pales in comparison to most of the Teenage Dream singles, but it’s still not a bad pop song, it’s not really a *good* one either, but oh well.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): Dull & Useless.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Another home-run for Katy in self-empowerment anthems, electric guitar chords main highlight in building crescendo in chorus, love the percussion

**rickikardashian** (9): I'm justifying my score with the fact that I loved this when I was younger and………….. I DONT WANT TO EXPLAIN MY SHITTY TASTE IN MUSIC, THIS IS FUN AND I LIKE IT

**1998tweety** (8): Tepid bop. Commercial music.

**palengard389** (8): Not Katy’s best but the end is cool

**ReallyCreative** (8): cute, not really substantive but she's a bop

**starlightzone** (8): 7 points for the chorus, .5 for everything else, .5 for kennedy davenport’s jumpsplits.

**TiltControls** (8): I used to hate this song, but something about two drag queens lipsyncing dressed in Hello Kitty attire finally sold it to me

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): catchy but this is one Katy song I just never come back to even with how popular it was

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Surprisingly not the worst Katy song in this list.

**Jexan13** (7.5): damn it, Katy is truly a hit or miss for me. Never really like this song too much, but it is fun.

**bulforster** (7): Cute but some of the verses' lyrics are very lame.

**hikkaru** (7): its fine... but she has FAR better on and off this list

**skargardin** (7): Yes it's a bit fight song esque but it does bop

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Kind of annoying but a summer anthem.

**alwayswords** (6): i hate the emoji lyric video

**bandnitos** (6): furry

**bespectacIed** (6): lyrics are so kindergarten but it slaps so who cares. Remember when she baited us with an edgy VMAs teaser for this? The burning of the signature purple wig? That was a fucking lie

**hunnybee12** (6): too corny for me

**ManofOranges** (6): This is not Katy's best.

**rhyneston3** (6): The sorority next to the fraternity I lived in were called the Tigers so of course they would play this song all the time between the hours of 7am-6am

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): me at age 12 hearing katy perry sing “eye of the tiger” : oh no shes gonna get sued by survivor

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): uur headteacher in primary school always made us sing this song so it makes me stressed by association

**anothertown** (5): Roar, Brave, and Fight Song all came out within 2 years of each other.. literally the nadir of 2010s pop

**muchopartymuchomoney** (5): tbh i think what bothers me the most here is that she tries to rhyme "lion" with "champion"

**starla\_** (5): katya vs kennedy should have been a double shantay

**themagicwemade** (5): i used to listen to prism every day in the car ride to school because it was one of the only albums i owned. we used to give my neighbor rides and he was a year younger than me and he never commented on the music but matthew im so sorry i forced you to listen to prism like 50 times i feel like i should repent or something

**vayyiqra** (5): As catchy as this song is, soccer-mom minivancore as a genre can go and take its bland inspirational anthems with it.

**gannade** (4): this has the same problem as fight song where the song is called ROAR and its vanilla af

**Hogwartsreject1912** (4): Sara Bareilles rip-off.

**timothy444** (4): Forgettable, unimaginative, monotonously safe and also probably the reason why Fight Song exists in the first place.

**Xanleth** (4): Brave was always superior.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3.5): hillary clinton vibes.

**wavingwolves** (3.5): i hated this song so much at the time and listening to it still bothers me to no end sorry katy but it's not your best

**FrankBedbroken** (3): sara bareilles' brave and regina spektor's fidelity but not nearly as good as either of those

**runaway3212** (3): I never really liked this one, one of katy's worst

**waluigiest** (3): Sara Bareilles outsold!! For real this was Katy Perry’s worst era

**CritneySpearz** (2): Justice for Brave by Sara Bareilles!!!

**nightjesus** (2): This song was made for the basic soccer mum that brings the orange slices to the game.

**RandomHypnotica** (2): Sara Bareilles deserved

**Roxieloxie** (2): is this song the same album as dark horse? either way brave did it better

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#97) This is like Firework, but worse? Like, a lot worse?

**FKJVMMP** (1): Firework, but worse.

**steelstepladder** (1): This song is like a more generic version of What Doesn't Kill You which is saying a lot

**camerinian** (0): This is what I imagine people who hate pop music think all pop sounds like, just empty inspirational cliches, grating lead piano with no bass or dynamics, and Katy Perry being her most Katy Perry (by that I mean a shitty singer with the energy of an annoying theatre kid who doesn't realise how much they suck). Also, the composition is fucking lazy, just a single piano chord hit on every half note, a verse melody that doesn't ever modulate past two notes, and a chorus that vaccuums out what little energy the track had. I hate this fucking song so much that I actually initially scanned this entire list of songs for potential zeros, found a different song to give my zero to, wrote out a whole spiel about it and why it sucks, and only now that I'm finishing the rest of the list do I realise that Roar was even here at all, and yet it all comes flooding back. That should be emblematic of how pathetic this trash is.

**jackisboredtoday** (0): the most formless, toothless, generic and pointless pop song of the decade. I swear this is what people who hate pop and belittle it as a genre for 5 year olds think pop music is

**ExtraEater** (10): Love this song. Shoutout to the equally amazing Bailando (Spanish Version) by Enrique Iglesias which deserved as many views, and I know it came close

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Fuck you justin bieber you crusty ass white bread bitch for ruining this bop. I’m still gonna give this a 10 to protect it from the lambs and people that don’t understand how a summer-y, latin pop song can be “fun” yet still want the radio to start playing PC Music.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): This song is just fun. This song evokes “summer” in a way that very few other songs do.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop, we love latinxcellence.

**alwayswords** (10): overhated

**camerinian** (10): fuck Bieber the original probably would have blown up on its own but whatever we love a track that brings the people together

**nightjesus** (10): fight me. This song fucking slaps.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is such a fun dance track!

**skargardin** (10): I loe Justin's version just as much as the original idc idc

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I like this song, sue me

**rhyneston3** (9): Puerto Rico really won in the end

**starlightzone** (9): Not a guilty pleasure song!! But I really enjoy it. I prefer it a bit more without JB but I can’t say I hate him here. His voice is just good. But I really like this. It’s very enjoyable and chill and sexy.

**wavingwolves** (9): i'm latina so i had actually never heard the version with justin and god his spanish is so painful to listen to and his verse is just... bad. anyway the original song is still amazing so i'll in fact give this a 9!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.3): (#35) It would be a 9 if it wasn't the JB remix.

**selegend** (8): a 10 for the original, -2 because of mustin

**starla\_** (8): but the original is a solid ten

**megm26** (7.5): this is actually a bop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): you know what... i'm gonna say it. despacito is good.

**anothertown** (7): What this could have been with anyone other than bieber as a feature

**Jexan13** (7): my god, gringos only gave attention to his song when an english speaking artist got featured. A very very mediocre feature. If this were the original it would have gotten a higher score.

**ReallyCreative** (7): this is fine but I have no strong opinions about it, it's just here in this rate

**rslashpoopheads** (7): The original is cute

**Tolk1en** (7): Unfortunately this remix is not as good as the original. Justin Bieber doesn't fit well. Aside from that this is a perfect latino bop.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): the original spanish would have scored higher. i say this as someone who does not speak spanish.

**bambamhenny** (6): god this song was inescapble

**bandnitos** (6): eh its just Still overplayed to me like i don't think i can listen to this song ever again tbh but its alright

**bespectacIed** (6): The original is a 8/10. I love this song (the one without Justin) so much, it's such a fun summer vibe. Iconic, influential, promulgated the Latin sound of the late 2010s.

**Entire-Reflection** (6): this is nothing like most music I like but for some reason I just can’t hate it

**gabcac** (6): but if it was the original it would be much higher

**hikkaru** (6): the justin remix :nauseated_face:

**Hogwartsreject1912** (6): The original would’ve gotten a 10. Maybe even 11.

**MasterWizardRyan** (6): Honestly the original is better

**runaway3212** (6): This is probably a good song, but it got overplayed to hell.

**static\_int\_husp** (6): Jutin Bieber on this song was U N N E C C E S A R Y

**themagicwemade** (6): i would give this an 8 but it's the version with justin bieber

**timothy444** (6): Gangnam Style died for this wtf

**untutorable** (6): please stream valentina by alaska thunderfuck

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I nominate Justin Bieber for Decade’s Most Phoned-in Feature.

**ManofOranges** (5): Much like Old Town Road, I appreciate the moment that this song created, but it was too overplayed to my liking

**Roxieloxie** (5): If this was the original it would've been an 11. Another song i escaped in 2017 so i actually like it

**steelstepladder** (5): More like Despacit-no

**vapourlomo** (5): The Bieber feature is pretty awful. And the song itself isn't great enough to totally overpower that.

**waluigiest** (5): justin bieber im still mad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): despaciNO

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): Great lyrics but the instrumental is just bad and ruins the whole thing, Justin is okay and the rapping in the second verse is good but the chorus is bad

**CritneySpearz** (3): Justin ruins it eek..

**FKJVMMP** (3): I wanted give it a zero because it kickstarted a whole trend *and 95% of these songs sound exactly the fucking same*, but by itself it’s not so bad. Except Bieber, who is terrible.

**FrankBedbroken** (3): bland, luis fonsi is just a dull personality and daddy yankee has made so much better than this, also i just noticed this is the version with bieber so this goes from a 5 to a 3

**InternetDude19** (3): I don't like it, am I racist?

**rickikardashian** (3): I despise this remix with every fiber of my body, not only did it make this already but hit in Latin America completely unscapeable, it also added Bieber giving absolutely zero fucks while singing. I just know damn well he was given a piece of paper with the lyrics, and he probably sent his part on a voice message recorded on his phone while he was lying in bed. Nothing valuable was added to this remix, except Fonsi changing a line to English and having the biggest representation of *white men being mediocre and successful* on the biggest Latin song of the decade

**stickywheels46** (3): Would’ve scored higher without JB

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): so many of these songs i’m rating so low because they just got so overplayed and they make me frustrated to hear now

**kappyko** (1): really shallow imo and justin adds nothing

**worlds-okayest666** (1): this song is so...boring? It feels like it’s trying so hard NOT to be that it just backfires and becomes an absolute snore

**Xanleth** (1): Despacit-no.

**slimboyfriend** (0): I will not relive the Despacito reign of 2017

**vayyiqra** (0): This is so bad. Spotify, please play anything but this or any other Latin pop song.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Post Malone’s best song imo. It’s hilarious how what started as a throwaway single for christmastime turned into one of the biggest songs of the following year and of the decade as a whole.

**ExtraEater** (9): It’s catchy, and that’s it. It sounds like Post Malone going autopilot, which is really not a bad thing.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I cant believe Post is good now. I’m glad to hear that.

---

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Post Malone really does have the ability to make his songs sound like a hit from the first note.

**ManofOranges** (10): Was kinda shocked by how much I liked this song, given how I'm used to not liking post man songs, but between this song and Circles I might have to give the man a second shot.

**1998tweety** (9): Bop.

**starlightzone** (9): I may just like Post Malone. It’s got some smooth beats, and I kind of just zoned out listening to it but in a good way.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.9): (#27) Take What You Want deserved. For Postie Stages of Grief, this is Bargaining.

**Jexan13** (8.5): great hooks. It's too bad that the production is that simple

**bandnitos** (8): what is he saying

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): infectious.

**rickikardashian** (7.8): I straight up was more familiar with the [Thomas the train version](https://youtu.be/KLPqAKeqjUE) than the original, and idk how to feel about that

**camerinian** (7): got 'em saying "sure it's fine"

**jackisboredtoday** (7): 720S bumpin Fall Out Boyyyy yyyeah

**rhyneston3** (7): I wish my Grandma did know Post Malone

**runaway3212** (7): Good, but nothing special

**steelstepladder** (7): It never gets any better, and it never gets any worse! A perfect seven

**wavingwolves** (6.5): https://youtu.be/gnavcUHC6zc

**yourfacesucksass** (6.5): I always change the station

**anothertown** (6): same i’ malso bumping fall out boy

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's okay

**slimboyfriend** (6): I like that it's short

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): gets an extra point for the fob reference but otherwise its just ok

**waluigiest** (6): I don’t think I’d actually heard this song before?

**fadedblue09** (5.7): In the forgettable tier of Post Malone songs.

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Instrumental sounds unfinished/unpolished, Post's rapping has good flow and charisma, just a mixed bag

**Awhile2** (5): post has some great songs no doubt but it seems like only his mediocre ones become hits

**FKJVMMP** (5): This is, totally indisputably, a song.

**FrankBedbroken** (5): first time hearing this, probably gonna forget how it sounded by the end of the day

**hikkaru** (5): this feels like such a non event idk how it's here, and above better now at that

**skargardin** (5): There's only so many times I can hear the same bragaddocious trap songs before I get bored of them

**Xanleth** (5): A lot more mediocre than the name implies

**CritneySpearz** (4.5): one of his more tolerable songs, probably because it’s short

**timothy444** (4): I don't necessarily hate it, but Post Malone can do better

**vayyiqra** (3): Is there an instrumental version of this because the instrumental track is at least a 7-8 but the vocals and lyrics aren't working for me at all.

**Roxieloxie** (2): i only like two of austin's songs and this isnt one of them[2]

**rslashpoopheads** (2): wow this is ass

**bespectacIed** (1): idk a worse person

**kappyko** (1): his worst

**nightjesus** (1): I’ve never heard this Post Malone song and you know what I was fine with that. What is this? This is so...not wow.

**palengard389** (1): Someone explain why people like this song. Nothing about it is good

**ExtraEater** (10): This is catchy

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): It’s like a lullaby. In all the bad ways.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Post Malone was so shitty before Wow. omfg.

---

**starlightzone** (9.5): Another Post Malone song I kind of just jammed to instead of writing anything up for but I really am really getting into him. I think he’s got something special.

**1998tweety** (9): I think this was the first Post song I started to like. Not the sound I associate him with but he pulls it off well.

**palengard389** (9): Probably my favorite Post song

**rhyneston3** (9): One of Post’s best songs

**fadedblue09** (8.4): Damn, Posty had that many hits, huh? Thankfully, his music isn’t obnoxious, so he can definitely stay.

**bandnitos** (8): kind of monotonous but still pretty good

**wavingwolves** (7.5): vibing

**timothy444** (7): Fine

**hikkaru** (6): catchy but dreary... the post malone experience

**rslashpoopheads** (6): it's fine

**steelstepladder** (6): More like his AP going mild

**waluigiest** (6): sweet, but

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.5): (#68) I swear I've gone through the five stages of grief with Post Malone. This is depression.

**ManofOranges** (5): This is what comes to mind when I think of Post Malone so I think it's understandable why I don't always envision his work as being good.

**nightjesus** (5): In this song there is like a siren or something with that frequency. So every damn time this song comes on it sounds like there is an ambulance, fire truck, or police behind me. It does annoy me.

**runaway3212** (5): Sweet but Psycho did it better.

**skargardin** (5): I just can't get into B&B

**vapourlomo** (5): A little sleepy for a song called "Psycho," huh

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): Really boring/sleepy for a Post track, forgettable Ty feature, just overall not memorable in the slightest

**Jexan13** (4.5): Everything about this is bland.

**camerinian** (3): zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

**Roxieloxie** (3): why are there so many post malone songs in this rate and why are none of them good

**vayyiqra** (3): PLEASE MAKE IT STOP, I BEG OF YOU POST MALONE, GO AWAY. AGAIN, NOTHING PERSONNEL KIDDO

**Xanleth** (3): Not a fan.

**CritneySpearz** (2): insufferable

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): not even the best song with the word psycho in its title released in 2018

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2): why is there so much post malone on here

**bespectacIed** (1): RED VELVET - PSYCHO OUTSOLD RED VELVET - PSYCHO OUTSOLD RED VELVET - PSYCHO OUTSOLD RED VELVET - PSYCHO OUTSOLD RED VELVET - PSYCHO OUTSOLD

**ExtraEater** (10): Twelve cars

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): I want to dislike this song, but I really don’t. Good for them, I guess.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): I hate this song so much. Easily the worst of Post Malone, and I have never liked 21 Savage or his presence on songs (until A Lot). It’s so boring, plain, and totally un-rock-star-like. It’s a song about being a rockstar and fucking hoes and smoking shit and the music video has Post as a badass swordsman, and yet the song still sounds like Postie just came back from a filling and his mouth hasn’t recovered from the anaesthetics.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Phenomenal rapping from both (the "No Mas -> 6 cars" line... whoo), icy and haunting production but issa bop, trap percussion works well for once

**CarlieScion** (10): main pop girl

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): not sure posty will ever top this.

**fadedblue09** (9): I now unironically believe that Post Malone deserves the title of main pop girl more than the actual pop girls on this list.

**starlightzone** (8.7): I really like this song actually. I think the voices are good and I love a slow back beat I can’t be faulted for this shit, don’t at me anymore. I like the heavy voices on this just slow and smooth back beat.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): one of my favorite post songs

**MasterWizardRyan** (8.5): Also bop

**FKJVMMP** (8): This is the song that made me understand the appeal of 21 Savage, and I love him. I still can’t *explain* the appeal of 21 Savage, but I get it now. Post Malone also exists on this song, allegedly.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): when Post says “ ratatatata“ I just thought of the video where that kid is like “I’m in the ghetto, ratatatatatata “ and now that’s all I can think about while listening to this today (until 21 Savage’s car garage line and the storyline behind that).

**nightjesus** (8): I mean I don’t recommend this life style but you do you Post Malone.

**starla\_** (8): why you got a twelve car garage when you only got six cars?

**megm26** (7.5): something something posty main pop girl something something

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I feel so guilty for liking this but the melody is infectious

**runaway3212** (7): Post Malone has a lot of songs that I don't really hate or love and this is one of them.

**steelstepladder** (7): More like fucking hoes and touch my willy daddy Malone ^-^

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.5): (#55) I like the 21 Savage verse more than the chorus. In the 5 Stages of Post Malone Grief, this is anger.

**bandnitos** (6): why did this have to be his first number one like why this of all songs

**hikkaru** (6): dummy catchy but it's too dreary for my liking

**vayyiqra** (6): This is like the Weeknd if he made music for falling asleep to.

**rhyneston3** (5): Posty has done way better songs

**vapourlomo** (5): I hated this song the first time I heard it, but it's grown on me. Still one of my least favorite Posty hits

**Xanleth** (5): Cause we all just wanna be big rockstars / And live in hilltop houses, drivin' fifteen cars

**InternetDude19** (4.1): How was this Post's first number 1? Who want's to listen to this song it's not fun, and it's kind of boring.

**bulforster** (4): Why is this song about how great being a rock star is so boring?

**ManofOranges** (4): Mm very boring to me.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Where's the melody?

**skargardin** (4): Maybe one of one's Post most annoying songs ever

**slimboyfriend** (4): This song is boring and 21 savage has no charisma here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU3nBp-DMUw

**1998tweety** (3): I used to have a complete rational hate for this song. I was so peeved seeing this meh song block Havana for so many weeks while Camila was busting her ass doing promo everyone meanwhile Post was sitting at home with the #1 song while something some week or jacking off of calling a girl ugly or something. Finally Havana got what she deserved and I hated this song slightly less but it still never really clicked for me. It's very boring.

**ReallyCreative** (3): the delivery of this is just so... lifeless

**timothy444** (3): I don't like it. ADoseOfBuckley was right when he said it sucks.

**waluigiest** (3): this is boring

**Roxieloxie** (2): im sorry i only like two songs by austin and this is not one of them

**camerinian** (1.5): It really kinda makes me mad how close this is to being good, but everyone involved went "Eh, fuck it" and clocked out of the studio an hour before their session was up. Post's delivery is monotone and bored when it should be sharp and warbly and irritating when it should be powerful, 21 Savage only puts any effort in when his verse is nearly over, and the fucking beat sounds like they exported the demo version that was missing a whole bunch of instrumental tracks and dynamic change ups that actually makes it any sort of interesting. I'm glad Post is basically just making pop music now, cos this suuuuuucked

**bespectacIed** (1): never heard of this song fully and I'm happy

**CritneySpearz** (1): sorry to this man

**ExtraEater** (9): This is the *opening song* to his debut album, and the very next song is Just the Way You Are? Way to cause a mood whiplash there, Bruno.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Thank god Bruno’s career path changed directions from him being a whiny doormat to becoming a cool cat.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): Jesus Christ Bruno, stop being so damn melodramatic.

---

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): This song made me feel so emo back then.

**skargardin** (10): Iconique

**starlightzone** (9.5): YUP another Ballad Bruno and another easy high score. DON’T CRY BRUNO YOU DESERVE BETTER. I’LL CATCH A GRENADE FOR YOU.

**1998tweety** (9): Mega bop, this used to be one of my main bops in middle school. Not as big of a fan of it now, but it's still nice to listen to.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): high school freshman me thought this was the greatest song ever, and tbh, he had a point.

**Jexan13** (8.5): the first time I heard this I was so bored... i'm a better person now

**rhyneston3** (8.5): Better than I remember!

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): A little boring with standard minor piano chords but decently classic-sounding and nicely dramatic and melancholic, Bruno's singing is great as usual

**Roxieloxie** (8): Mr. Mars really had this decade on lock didnt he

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This song has not been the same for me since that Kingsley video where he calls out this song, specifically the line “had your eyes wide open, why were they open?” Bitch your eyes had to be open too so you would know that

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): ok for some reason the music video for this was always weirdly funny to me? just him dragging this piano around LA

**bambamhenny** (7): the drama 🙄

**bandnitos** (7): his best song. i can tolerate this

**bespectacIed** (7): Lowkey emotionally manipulative but still a bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): One of Bruno’s less good songs but still a bop

**timothy444** (7): Possibly the best Bruno song before his throwback era. Though it might not have aged as well as I thought, it's still listenable and catchy enough to go back to this song again.

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): It's very mid but the vocals are good

**ManofOranges** (6): The lyrics here are kinda stupid, not gonna lie.

**waluigiest** (6): If I’d done this rate back in 2010 or whenever this song came out, I probably would have given this my zero. I hated Bruno Mars, and this song made me irrationally angry. I still think it’s kind of lame (e.g. the “eyes wide open” line, the general desperation) but he made some points and his voice is beautiful.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.3): (#70) Bruno, you were doing so well! What happened?

**hikkaru** (5): kinda a classic but also way worse than i remember

**nightjesus** (5): I’m so glad Bruno grew to the artist he did. But man the beginning was boring. The saving grace is the chorus. I’m sure I did like this song when it first came out though. I guess this album has aged a lot for me.

**runaway3212** (5): Bruno is very dramatic here, I dont like it.

**vayyiqra** (5): oh great another mid-tier Bruno Mars song please tell me this is the last one

**rickikardashian** (4.5): I didn't realize how whiney he sounded in this song, and for what? a girl having their eyes open while kissing?

**CritneySpearz** (4): this song always felt so over dramatic..

**muchopartymuchomoney** (4): the lyrics are too much

**rslashpoopheads** (4): I haven't heard this in a whole decade and I'm still sick of it.

**vapourlomo** (4): Man, I forgot how lame early Bruno was

**wavingwolves** (4): bruno.... calm down dude.... take a breather

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Can’t believe Treasure didn’t make it and this shit gets in.

**kappyko** (3): shrapnel

**Xanleth** (3): Not a fan.

**Popfan2489** (1): this seems like a song a serial killer would write

**steelstepladder** (1): Bruno is the only artist getting a one and a ten from me this rate

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): there are a lot of trap and rap songs that i used to not like that i've grown to love, but trap queen is still pretty average to me.

**InternetDude19** (5): This is my first time listening to this in full, did people like this as a joke?

**rhyneston3** (5): I love the Kidz Bop version

**skargardin** (5): One of those songs that feel so lost in time

**MrMoodle** (4): Weirdly kind of sweet, but this guy’s voice is literally unbearable to listen to.

**stickywheels46** (4): Fetty Wap sounds like he’s having a stroke when he’s behind the mic

**fadedblue09** (2.2): Bleh. Trashy hip-hop hit.

**RandomHypnotica** (2): never heard this one before. hope to never again

**vayyiqra** (2): I really do not like this. I like trap beats, but Fetty Wap's voice is annoying, and this song is just too cluttered at parts. I like the synth and the beat is okay, but that's about it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.7): 38

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): Fetty's rapping is trash and I never want to hear this song again.

**timothy444** (1): Don't torture me by refusing my score of -5 to this song. It's already punishment enough that this rate is making me scrobble a Fetty Wap song.

**ExtraEater** (10): Y’all know Lauren Bennett from G.R.L. (of Ugly Heart fame) is on this song? Anyways, this is a massive bop and the fact that this isn’t #1 with a 10.000 average really says a lot about this sub

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/529124797733666828/676988484392714281/6ca25be2d8ad52e4c4bee4d270e2d4bd308df82e.png

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): This has aged *way* better than it has any right to. An instant classic.

---

**1998tweety** (10): A classic on release and it still holds up now. Their one good song (Sexy And I Know It was meh).

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Dated and kind of silly but still makes me want to dance; infectious hook+chorus, amazing percussion and instrumental overall, screw it I'm shuffling

**bambamhenny** (10): pop perfection, a collapse

**hikkaru** (10): the way people think they're too good to not go absolutely fucking feral when those opening synths come in

**nightjesus** (10): This song reminds me of awkward 16 year old me at my formal after party watching my year level get drunk and me and my friends just kinda stood there awkwardly. Song is still a banger tho.

**poppinmmolly** (10): for me this takes me back to the summer before I started college, and so that makes me look back on this bop fondly.

**rickikardashian** (10): this song started sounding a lot better once every other song didn't try to copy it

**selegend** (10): lauren bennett is an icon who is a respected figure in our community i miss GRL and am now spiraling

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this aged like FINE wine and i do NOT care. Pop perfection.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.5): (#21) My guiltiest pleasure in this list. It is ONLY here because of Just Dance.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song is so 2011 but wow what a classic.

**starla\_** (9.5): wow I’m 18 again

**starlightzone** (9.5): This song hits a lot of good notes and I love it very much. It has no chill and they absolutely do not take themselves seriously in the least. I’m pretty sure neither of these boys can spell seriously but I love them.

**stickywheels46** (9): This is a GOAT party song

**vayyiqra** (9): It's time for Popheads to admit to themselves that they hate this song because it was everywhere the year it came out, not because it's bad. This is a bop, and the lyrics are meaningless but it's fun so who cares? The video is iconic too. Sometimes things are popular for a reason.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.2): The first time I heard this song I legit thought it was Black Eyed Peas

**anothertown** (8): Everybody say thank you Berry Gordy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): party rockers in the hou

**untutorable** (8): this is gonna go out early but that just means y'all fake af because i know when this was released every single one of you tried to shuffle

**vapourlomo** (8): Ah yes, those tacky-neon early '10s days. Before EDM was ploddingly serious

**alwayswords** (7.5): tbt to good ol days when everyone was the golden box man for halloween

**camerinian** (7.5): se tonight

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Has it aged well? Not really, but I have fond memories of this song. It's decent.

**Awhile2** (7): party rockers in the house or party rock is in the house? one of lifes great mysteries

**bandnitos** (7): party rockers in the house toniIIIIIIIIGHT

**hunnybee12** (7): this is definitely tainted by nostalgia... but it makes me happy

**Roxieloxie** (7): not to be r/lewronggeneration on main but my biggest regret in life is that i never got to go to a white frat party in 2012 and dance to stuff like this on the radio

**timothy444** (7): Iconic and a childhood highlight of mine :uwu:

**MasterWizardRyan** (6.8): Catchy and will definitely get the party started

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): “everybody just have a good time” wholesome kings just want us all to be happy

**1000\_nights** (6): Crazy how this is the 2nd biggest song of the decade when nobody has thought about it since 2012

**bespectacIed** (6): for its impact and absolute ubiquity. The song's kinda trash but in a fun way

**bulforster** (6): Remembering this made me smile but it's not very good lol

**runaway3212** (6): Bad, but also nostalgic so I can't be to harsh

**steelstepladder** (6): This song basically invented the pop drop and it does not NEARLY get enough credit for it

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): party rock is in the house tonight. now this is what i call epic. fellas. hate is bad.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): honestly this song isn't BAD, it's just forgettable

**rhyneston3** (5): The video made me take this down one point. Also Shots is waaaaaay better and should have been a bigger hit

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Imagine having the second biggest song of the decade and then just vanishing off the face of the Earth. It's fun but that drop......

**skargardin** (5): Might've been too hard on this in my own rate, let me bump up the score a bit

**Tolk1en** (5): I've listened to this on the radio too many times. Some of the sounds are interesting though.

**Awkward\_King** (3): my dad loves this song so it makes me cringe to hear

**gannade** (3): not a fan

**Jexan13** (3): My god, this song was so fucking obnoxious. Like, I never got its appeal, and I don't get it yet.

**megm26** (3): it’s objectively a terrible song but it was a cultural moment.

**waluigiest** (3): party rockers in the

**CritneySpearz** (2): honestly it has not aged well at all… my ears are bleeding

**slimboyfriend** (2): No.

**ulikejazz** (2): the trash jumped out

**fadedblue09** (1): Flashback to this awful era of party music. Won’t even bother to finish this, sorry.

**InternetDude19** (1): I didn't like this as a kid, and I hate it now.

**ManofOranges** (1): Didn't like this song back then and I still don't like it now. It's good that LMFAO were one-era wonders.

**themagicwemade** (1): everyone is not having a good time :(

**wavingwolves** (1): this is still as bad as i remember it being wow i can't believe people really listened to this because they wanted to

**Xanleth** (1): This song is exceptionally annoying. A lot of lead in this zeppelin.

vayyiqra: 1) Glad to see someone of you have taste

2) The line is "party rock **is in** the house tonight". If you listened to their first album of the same name, you would know. Party rock is a concept, it is transcendent. Party rock unites millions and parts the Red Sea. Party Rock is love, party rock is life. (Shake that.) 😎

**ExtraEater** (10): I like this song but I’d swap it out for Latch in a heartbeat

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): This song is boring, but it’s a pleasant boring so points for that at least.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Sam Smith going from Pete Buttegieg “I don’t care if you’re gay but don’t show it” ballad singer to non binary bop maker was the biggest plot twist of the decade.

---

**gannade** (10): we love them

**waluigiest** (10): this is really well written. Honestly this whole album is so important

**starlightzone** (9.7): FOR REAL this hits. They’re so fucking talented at making me feel things. It’s so beautiful and strong and I’m gonna cry listening to this again. They’re such a powerful artist.

**1998tweety** (9.5): :cry:

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): also one of my favorite songs at the time. i remember when a friend told me they didn't like sam smith and i was confused bc i thought everyone loved them. then i saw a lot of hate on popheads but i think that's slowed down since they've started doing more upbeat stuff. anyway, getting off track here but i love their ballads. nirvana would be a candidate for my 11 if it was here.

**fadedblue09** (8.3): I prefer I’m Not the Only One, but a ballad is always welcome breath of fresh air, especially in 2014 (and idc what you guys say, Sam shines in ballads).

**bespectacIed** (8): Let's be honest, absolutely no one was NOT blackfished by this song. Love them tho

**vayyiqra** (8): "I still need love, because I'm just a man." Same. :pensive: Sam has such a beautiful voice and I love the choral backing vocals as well. I've never listened to one of their albums before and probably wouldn't, but I really like this song.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): A little boring/draggy but clean and classic simple production is fitting, Sam sells the song with his longing, slightly melancholic singing

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): It’s fine but yes I’m a basic popheads user who prefers bops over ballads

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): THIS is how you make a good piano ballad, john legend take notes

**Hogwartsreject1912** (7): Never got the hype

**survivorthrowaway5** (7): classic; simple, universal

**timothy444** (7): Alright

**wavingwolves** (7): i just wish this had a bridge and a bigger last chorus but the vocal performance is pretty on point

**yourfacesucksass** (7): I love everything about Sam except for this song.

**bandnitos** (6): he has true bops. this isn't one of them.

**palengard389** (6): A little bland but it’s tolerable

**Roxieloxie** (6): i called this the target song for the longest cause i used to only hear it in target.

**vapourlomo** (6): How did Latch miss this list?

**FrankBedbroken** (5): they have a nice voice and all but this just sounds pretty uninteresting

**kappyko** (5): in the car crying 2 this

**ManofOranges** (5): I will never forgive Sam Smith for plaguing me with ad after ad trying to get me to listen to this song way back in 2014.

**Xanleth** (5): a little forced but it’s not bad.

**camerinian** (4): I'm so glad Sam ended up making more interesting music than this

**runaway3212** (4): I dislike this song, but Sam Smith went on to make some absolute bops so I can't be to mad at them.

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): Sam Smith's whining when they sing could not be less appealing, and the line "guess I'm no good at a one night stand" with a tone that can only be described as :*( sends me into a rage. They are talented but god damn do they put me to sleep.

**Awkward\_King** (3): why do i hate this song so much

**rhyneston3** (3): How do You sleep is one of my favourite recent songs. This is not that song

**skargardin** (3): Good god I'm so happy that Sam Smith evolved from doing their boring ass ballads

**steelstepladder** (3): More like Stay with dance beats and stop making this dreery ballad crap

**ComeOnPupperfish** (2.5): (#87) I'm so happy they got better.

**nightjesus** (2): not gon lie, some Sam Smith songs put me to sleep. This is one of them.

**hikkaru** (1): i'm so glad they gave up on this shit and they're now leaning into more bop territory... this is dreadful

**ExtraEater** (9): Eminem’s lyrics here are just terrible. Rihanna does indeed carry the song

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7.5): The Rihanna part 2 version is better. The Ariana Grande cover of Part 2 is better because there’s no Eminem on it.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): I still don’t know if this is glorifying or villainizing abusive relationships tbh.

---

**gannade** (10): yes burn the house down riri!!!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): iconic

**1998tweety** (9.5): One of his best songs, some of the lyrics get called out (like windowpane) but I don't mind it tbh. Rih sells it though.

**starlightzone** (9.5): This and the follow up are REALLY GOOD SONGS. I normally don’t love rap verses but I think these just hit in such a particularly beautiful way. I think Eminem and Rihanna get the right vocalization together.

**bespectacIed** (9): Iconic. Megan Fox needs to make a comeback and be the bad bitch cherry emoji queen that she is

**palengard389** (9): Part II would’ve been my 11

**timothy444** (9): Name a better Eminem lyric than "Guess that's why they call it window pane". Protip you can't

**Jexan13** (8.5): omg i'm calling the cops, where is R9 u liar, i hate the way you lie

**MrMoodle** (8): Very conflicted on this one. It’s either a very mature take on domestic violence or just wildly insensitive,  can’t pinpoint which. But Rihanna sounds pretty on it, so I’ll cut it some slack.

**fadedblue09** (7.7): Probably their best collab, and that’s not saying much.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Great performances from both even if the instrumental clashes with Em's rapping and the lyrics are a little weird

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Rihanna’s chorus is great but I have just not cared about the rest of the song as of recently

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): so many stupid lines in this song but i still love it

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I like this a lot at first but it hasn't aged that well.

**GiftoftheGeek** (7): Shoutout to radio for blanking the word 'fucking' but letting "tie her to the bed and set this house on fire" go

**nightjesus** (7): Red hair era Rihanna. My favourite. This song is super powerful and Eminem and Rihanna just go really well together here.

**Popfan2489** (7): the second best em ft Rihanna song

**rickikardashian** (7): I truly would prefer if this was just a 3 minute loop of the chorus

**runaway3212** (7): Rihanna carries this song.

**vayyiqra** (7): Great hook by Rihanna + acoustic guitar and Eminem yelling angrily makes this hard to rate. I know we rated it not long ago, and I forget what I gave it, but I'm feeling a "good, but not amazing".

**InternetDude19** (6.5): I appreciate that they tried; I don't know if they succeeded, but it's decent.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): (#62) Dad jokes!

**FKJVMMP** (6): Rihanna’s great, Eminem is... there... Production sucks though.

**steelstepladder** (6): More like Love the Way Eminem is such a FUCKING BOOMER

**vapourlomo** (6): Loved it at the time, but the production and Em's verses have aged pretty badly

**wavingwolves** (6): one of the best rihanna's hooks but the song itself is such a mess

**bandnitos** (5): lets just pretend only the chorus exists ok

**selegend** (5): eminem’s best song

**skargardin** (5): I've listened to this tens, maybe even hundres of times through the years but I'm still struggling to remember what it sounds like

**waluigiest** (5): I’m so tired of this song it didn’t need to exist

**muchopartymuchomoney** (4): i am still so tired of this song. sorry Rihanna :( i'm just tired of Eminem in general.

**Xanleth** (4): ehhhhhhhhhhh.

**CritneySpearz** (3): not even Rihanna can save an Eminem song from being unbearable

**hikkaru** (3): yawn

**ManofOranges** (3): I don't get it!

**stickywheels46** (3): Wasn’t a good decade for Em

**ReallyCreative** (2): gross, it's a shame Rihanna can't save this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): eminem has 2 good songs. this is not one of them

**ExtraEater** (9): The way Drake sings “got a Hennessy in my hand, one more time 'fore I go, higher powers taking a hold on me” is really catchy.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This song got 20 times better in retrospect. The dancehall vibes, Drake making a chill party jam, it’s the definition of “a vibe.” And even though it got SUPER overplayed in 2016, now that it’s not played every 20 minutes, it’s back to being a great song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): This was a forgettable song.

---

**fadedblue09** (10): One of my jams in 2016 and continue to slap until this day.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): I just fucking cried listening to this song because it made me think of 2016 and I got a little emotional, I need a therapist

**1998tweety** (9): A good Drake song huh

**runaway3212** (9): I like drake on this song and I think it's one of his best

**starlightzone** (8.7): One of like 5 Drake songs I really like. I love Smooth Singing Drake. It’s such a clean song and I love the beats it hits. I also love Kyla in here too, so good.

**starla\_** (8.5): still goes off

**vapourlomo** (8.5): I know a lot of people dislike this one, but I love its nocturnal vibe and ghostly Kyla sample.

**nightjesus** (8): Now this is a damn bop. One of the very few Drake songs that made it on to my end of year playlists.

**rhyneston3** (8): I love the little strings breakdown

**Roxieloxie** (8): this beat is actually really good, its no nice for what but im kinda a slut for non white trop pop

**skargardin** (8): Bop

**wavingwolves** (8): tbh i think this is one of the better drake hits and i respect it (also it sounds like a take care reject)

**bandnitos** (7): when i was youtube downloading music bc i didn't have money this wasn't available at all and im still bitter

**bespectacIed** (7): BOP

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Drake’s blandest hit

**ReallyCreative** (7): starts off strong but eventually just starts dragging, maybe if Drake didn't text minors...

**rslashpoopheads** (7): idk what to say about this

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): shout out to my mom bc this is her favorite drake song

**bambamhenny** (6): not a fan of drake tbh

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): (#60) Last dance, last chance for Drake to get a good hit.

**waluigiest** (6): live for the machine gun noise

**camerinian** (5): anyone actually listen to this since 2016? Feels weird that we ever settled for Drake being our trop pop guy

**FKJVMMP** (5): Kinda weird that Drake can introduce a new sound to pop while remaining so dedicatedly middle of the road at the same time.

**FrankBedbroken** (5): doesn't do a whole lot for me, but i guess it's pleasant

**ManofOranges** (5): I enjoy this song somewhat whenever I listen to it but I cannot for the life of me remember how it goes when I'm not listening to it and that's not good.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i don't like the girl singing

**timothy444** (5): Never got into this but it's not horrible enough to justify giving a lower score

**vayyiqra** (5): No. I will defend Drake on some things, but this song is not good. I hate that fucking reggaeton drumbeat, and it ruins almost any song that has it for me.

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Second half when the male sample kicks in is better than the first half; kinda lifeless instrumental with baffling female sample

**anothertown** (4): where’s the flavor

**hikkaru** (4): the non-nice for what drake songs here are so meh

**survivorthrowaway5** (4): made him artist of the decade

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): this song easily could have never existed

**themagicwemade** (4): i wish this was one kiss

**steelstepladder** (2): More like one dance to this song is too many

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2): too much drake in this rate

**Xanleth** (1): Bad song.

**stickywheels46** (0): The most boring song ever made

**ExtraEater** (10): Melodically, this song reminds me a LOT of “Do You…” by Miguel. Anyway, this is a bop that grew on me throughout the summer of 2019. This song came out exactly two months after Disclosure’s Moonlight EP, which was a fantastic, underrated nod to classic house music. This doesn’t quite continue that house streak, but they still had the spirit in them to imbue what should be a normal R&B song with something truly special. Don’t sleep on this one

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I chose this for the bonus rate myself and idk why i did tbh. I think it was cause I didn’t think we’d get a chance to rate this in the near future so I would just add it in here just for fun.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I love a good R&B song about taking things slow.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**Roxieloxie** (10): i love khalid and the videos of me loosing my voice annoying every white person around me when khalid played this at jingle ball are my favorite things

**starlightzone** (10): wait why did not this get into the top 100. It’s so good what the fuck. Blurred lines is here but this isn’t? EXPLAIN AMERICA.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Definitely one of Khalid’s best songs. He really needs to keep working with producers like Disclosure.

**Jexan13** (9.5): Imagine if Khalid released more songs like this; he would be loved in /r/pophe... JAHAHAH, I can't even say that with a straight face!

**bespectacIed** (9): I know y'all think Khalid is the paradigm of male pop blandness but this is a major bop, i don't care. The mv is also beautiful.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): This would be #26 in the list.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): I saw a lot of hate on this song but I don't really get it. It's just a chill, mellow but still danceable vibe

**waluigiest** (9): it’s too wobbly!! I listened while walking and almost tripped

**InternetDude19** (8): The only Khalid song I like.

**fadedblue09** (7.3): Super basic but probably the best song in the bonus rate.

**bandnitos** (7): if u wanna talk then talk damn

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): Why isn't this longer!!

**vayyiqra** (7): Well, Popheads has done the impossible and made me care about Khalid. I like this.

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Cute.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Really milquetoast fare even if Khalid's singing is decent and Disclosure's production is clean, everything is too low key

**skargardin** (6): It's alright but I still found Khalid's music to be so incredibly boring

**wavingwolves** (6): the way i always hear this song when i go to bars... i think it made me like it a little

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): I like Khalid and I like Disclosure but this song doesn’t play to either of their strengths

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): blah

**brodiepp** (5): this song got sooo annoying after not long

**FKJVMMP** (5): It’s simultaneously a good song but a bad Khalid song and a bad Disclosure song all at the same time.

**ManofOranges** (5): Kinda boring.

**vapourlomo** (5): Man, Khalid is bland

**steelstepladder** (3): Probably my least favorite Khalid song

**timothy444** (3): khalid is boring and this is no exception

**Xanleth** (3): Meh.

**camerinian** (2): what the fuck, Disclosure. Where is your groove. What is this “womp, shlorp dorp” ass production. Why is Khalid doing his shitty ass falsetto all over the chorus. booooooooooo

**kappyko** (1): fuck khalid. sorry dude!

**palengard389** (1): So un-catchy idk if it’s possible to sing this without being way off key

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I WANT IT. I GOT IT. I WANT IT. I GOT IT.

**ExtraEater** (6): Unnecessary

**ImADudeDuh** (0): 7 Rings is terrible. Ariana has made amazing songs. She’s made some of the best pop songs of the 2010s. She doesn’t use any of her talents on this song. On an album that has her trying to overcome sadness, why is she trying to flex on us how we aren’t as rich as her? People keep trying to just brush it off as “a fun bop that isn’t that deep!” which is true, but it’s also annoying as hell and with such an unlikable attitude. “Whoever said money can't solve your problems/Must not have had enough money to solve 'em” is one of the worst lyrics of the decade and is such a slap in the face to anyone who has ever struggled with money. There are ways to brag about money and make it seem fun, but having a white woman who’s never had to really “work” for her wealth rap about how much richer she is than I, is not fun. This song really marked the point when I think Ariana just became a bad artist. Add all this up with her blackfishing scandal (which considering [THIS](https://i.scdn.co/image/b1dfbe843b0b9f54ab2e588f33e7637d2dab065a) is currently her spotify picture, she doesn’t give a fuck about), and you get a song that i think has 0 redeeming qualities.

**bloupp** (11): The first time I listened to this song was the morning after it dropped. (It was released at midnight for me). My first reaction after hearing it for the first time was, "Wow, I'm glad I didn't stay up to hear this disappointment." But over the next few days, I kept feeling compelled to listen to it again. There was just this hypnotizing, irresistible quality to the song, and it drew me in like a fish to a lure, and once I bit, boy did Ms. Donut Licker reel hard. One year and 1,350 plays later, I can safely say that this song has changed my life, and in my opinion, is one of the best songs of all time.

**GiftoftheGeek** (11): Me, an 18-year-old, broke, skinny male shouting the lyrics in the car: WHEN YOU SEE THEM RACKS THEY STACKED UP LIKE MY ASS YUH

**alwayswords** (10): a moment in history

**bespectacIed** (10): Will my undeserved inflation of 7 Rings' score be enough the keep Ari into Day 3? Probably not but I have to try. I'm just sad because Ariana is the second pop girl I capital-s STAN but the two songs she has in this rate are not one of her best.

**hikkaru** (10): more like 10 rings

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Fuck the haters this song is perfection.

**palengard389** (10): Catchy, singable, perfect

**Popfan2489** (10): bad bitch anthem

**Tolk1en** (10): overhated. The lyrics are not so terrible for an Ariana song. The beats are amazing. I fell in love with in less than 10 seconds. Every note comes perfectly from the very beginning to the end. Not fond of the music video or it would have been my 11

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I will defend this bop until the day I die. Sure it’s not her best song but it slaps and people need to stop taking it seriously

**Awkward\_King** (9): sue me i like it

**rickikardashian** (9): when this first got released, I decided it was irony because of how ridiculous it was. For the sake of my own mental health, I've decided to keep that belief, even if it's not completely true:)

**starlightzone** (9): Julie Andrews career revival if she guested on this can you imagine. I really love this song and just basically the dangerous of spending your feelings.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): the rapping verse is genuinely one of my favorite ariana moments. banger.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.9): good but maria von trapp still did it better

**MrMoodle** (8.7): I feel like a class traitor for liking this song

**fadedblue09** (8.6): Popheads can fuck off, this is a bop.

**1998tweety** (8): Oop tbh I kinda like this song even though it isn't the best. I like the vibe and energy. Not to mention it's super catchy.

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.6): kinda clunky

**bandnitos** (7): he he he get it

**ManofOranges** (7): Say what you want about this song, it definitely is catchy.

**nightjesus** (7): heh.

**rhyneston3** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22D02NtWt-wulie this version would get a 10 from me

**skargardin** (7): An appropriate score

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I have such a polarized reaction to this song… I love the verses/bridge but god the hook is a pile of nothing and the lyrics only work for me when i’m in the right mood

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Catchy trap/dark pop fusion but ultimately rather vain lyrics and slightly blackfish-y/trend-hopping

**bulforster** (6): Ariana too black?? Is such a thing even possible??

**InternetDude19** (6): It's catchy but I wouldn't say I like it.

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): I've grown on this song over the past year but I still don't like it, I really don't know how THIS was the smash hit off of tu,n

**runaway3212** (5): I don't really get why this became a hit.

**timothy444** (5): Not good. She only made this song because she wanted to brag about how rich she is compared to everyone else.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4.8): (#77) Triple 7s, do I get cash?

**anothertown** (4): The Sound of Music is my favorite movie. Also, Ariana is primed for anticapitalist radicalization, she just needs the right person to do it. :bernie:

**kappyko** (4): so disappointing but it's fun. not going to fake outrage, but i do understand WHY this would piss off people and they're certainly valid in feeling that way. my qualms are mostly just that it's pretty shit

**RandomHypnotica** (4): I don't hate this song now as much as i did when I first heard it, but it still really rubs me the wrong way

**rslashpoopheads** (3): I, for one, welcome our capitalist overlords.

**waluigiest** (3): still anti-black

**wavingwolves** (3): why was this a single

**camerinian** (2): VSCO girls….. so many VSCO girls…..

**steelstepladder** (2): That is six rings too many you bourgeoisie bitch

**themagicwemade** (2): the rap part is the only redeemable part of this song and even it loses points for the stacked up like my ass line

**vayyiqra** (2): Not sorry, but this song blows chunks. It's a terrible use of an iconic melody over a bland trap beat, and the lyrics are boring and not relatable at all. In fact, musically it's okay; the lyrics are what ruin it. This album has way better. (Yuh.) This song is *not* one of my favourite things.

**Xanleth** (2): Never really liked this one.

**Roxieloxie** (1): I heard this song for the first time after old town road and i dont think i was expecting the trap country song to be my favorite of the two

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): imagine being rich. cant relate

**ExtraEater** (10): No matter what your stance on it, you can’t deny Bruno’s come a long way since this song. One moment it’s corny love songs and the next it’s genuinely spirited funk throwbacks. Go figure. Now if only Shawn Mendes could have a similar career trajectory (he veered into greatness once with “Lost in Japan”, but he’s never come close to recapturing that spark since then)

**ImADudeDuh** (6): It’s kinda fascinating to think about how Bruno Mars started the decade saying “You’re amazing just the way you are :)” and ending it with “i drink til im drunk, i smoke til im high.”

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): Man, Bruno’s first album is by far his worst.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Super romantic lyrics, rather sweet and simple and classic production, one of the best choruses in this rate, Bruno's a wonderful singer and sells his love song perfectly

**hikkaru** (10): that was a classic... a karaoke anthem

**Jexan13** (10): i'm literally crying

**poppinmmolly** (10): SO CUTE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Yes this song is corny as hell, no that doesn’t stop me from loving it

**starlightzone** (9.7): I prefer this Bruno over the more recent Bruno. I think it’s just so sweet and soft. I always enjoy a pop ballad about being in love rather than not being in love.

**ManofOranges** (9): Ok I know a lot of people hate old Bruno Mars here, and I'll name em, but personally I love this song. Maybe it's because I associate it with Pitch Perfect. Whatever the case may be, I will forever love this song.

**MasterWizardRyan** (8.5): Bop

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I've always thought this song was really pretty, shame this bruno is long gone

**1998tweety** (8): I don't really care for songs with this subject matter but it sounds alright.

**alwayswords** (8): a wedding classic

**runaway3212** (8): great & sweet

**waluigiest** (8): omfg I hated Bruno Mars so much when this album came out. Looking back…. This is sweet and I like it a lot. I was so bitter bruno I’m sorry

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): It's sweet but I'm glad Bruno moved on from this sound

**rickikardashian** (7.8): how do you find someone’s laugh sexy? does she laugh in a fake deep sultry way as if she was megan fox? does she not ever get those ugly laughs were you start sounding like a pig as you choke?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): never was a big fan of Bruno Mars first era songs, I definitely prefer the funky throwback sounding stuff over the pop. But he’s got a great voice and it suits him for sure.

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.4): bright; starmaker

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.3): (#47) Barf.

**bespectacIed** (7): i love bruno so this is a higher score than it deserves

**InternetDude19** (7): The percussion is more intense than I remembered.

**selegend** (7): this is the filipino fuckboy anthem

**themagicwemade** (7): i kinda miss ballad bruno

**vapourlomo** (7): Cheesy, but in a sweet, endearing way. Not as good as later Bruno, but it works

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): middle school me thought this was the deepest and sweetest thing, i actually kinda miss Bruno’s early style a little bit now

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Passable Bruno hit.

**yourfacesucksass** (6.3): I really hate this song

**slimboyfriend** (6): I get nauseous

**timothy444** (6): There's a lot of cheesy lyrics that it kinda hurts to listen to after all those years.

**bandnitos** (5): bruno don't lie to me

**rhyneston3** (5): Why is the girl in the video so naturally hot though, I know we are only rating the song but this annoys me. Also the pitch perfect mashup with Just a Dream was better

**rslashpoopheads** (5): 1D did it better.

**skargardin** (5): It's alright I suppose but it ain't no Grenade

**anothertown** (4): Doo-wops & Hooligans & Beerbongs & Bentleys

**camerinian** (4): early Bruno haunts me in my sleep

**nightjesus** (4): I find this song gets really boring really quickly. I dunno. Sappy songs like this have never done it for me. Bruno’s voice is great though.

**steelstepladder** (4): More like just the way you fart

**vayyiqra** (4): This is very positive and that's great, but I can't say I like it as a song. It's just so cheesy, and sounds like it would've been a hit from some boy band in the 2000s. Stream Timbaland - The Way I Are, a much better song than this one.

**Xanleth** (4): Saccharine and overdone.

**Awkward\_King** (3): this just makes me think of matty b im sorry. I love doo wops and hooligans just not this song at all

**CritneySpearz** (3): cringey tbh

**wavingwolves** (3): this was way too corny for me to enjoy even as a teenager, so now i feel it's worse

**palengard389** (2): boring love song

**gannade** (1): shawn mendes does this 'nice guy' schtick better

**ExtraEater** (10): This is good but Cake by the Ocean is better

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This was a huge bop at first. But, after the months of radioplay and the realization that a good chunk of the goodwill they earned from this comeback was built on the back of nostalgia, the song really lost it’s luster. Its a good song still, but its not the pop perfection I originally saw it as.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): The Jonas Brothers comeback has been really disappointing, let’s all be honest here.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, the perfect comeback song.

**GiftoftheGeek** (10): The girl from the "they're **brothers**" Vine was psychic or something

**ignitethephoenix** (10): not going to lie, this was one of my favourite and most listened to songs last year. It’s a summer bop and honestly it was the perfect come back song for them.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this bops HARD

**Roxieloxie** (10): there are three good songs on this album (sucker, only human, trust)

**timothy444** (10): A bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): A little lowkey but still groovy, production feels classic even for 2019, Nick's singing is a pretty nice highlight

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): wow WHAT a comeback song. Shame nothing else has lived up to this since

**alwayswords** (9): overhated

**Awkward\_King** (9): almost the only song from happiness begins i actually liked but i love it so!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Kings!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.9): (#29) Wow, good thing the Jonas Brothers only released this single, and nothing else! Looking forward to the album!

**starlightzone** (8.5): I don’t think my feelings are ever consistent on this song but I will say I think it does a lot of good things, and I think it’s got some smooth hits to it. The chorus REALLY SLAPS. WHEN THE BEAT DROPS IT GOES HARDER THAN IT SHOULD.

**runaway3212** (8): Stream SUCKER by Charli xcx

**waluigiest** (8): 2019 was full of pleasant surprises

**Xanleth** (8): Catchy but that remix with the vampire girl is stuck in my head now. KYUN!

**anothertown** (7.5): you know, it’s a bop. Nothing more and nothing less.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): there are some odd inflections in the vocals but it's pretty good

**bambamhenny** (7): shanari shanari ojou sama...memories broken, the truth that was spoken, i've even forgotten my name

**brodiepp** (7): this song was so good... the week of release

**vayyiqra** (7): Aside from the awful line "tattoo inside my brain", this is kind of a banger. Boy bands might've made some points.

**hikkaru** (6.5): meh

**bespectacIed** (6): This snuck in to the top 100 songs of the decade??? It kinda sounds like How to Be a Heartbreaker lol but it's a bop

**camerinian** (6): just give us Feel It Still you cowards

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Oh I love Portugal. The Man!

**wavingwolves** (6): this is one of the best songs from their new phase but it's still not really Good it's just massively Okay

**fadedblue09** (5.9): Don’t understand why America wants to make Jonas Brothers happen, but hey, at least they’re not 1D.

**nightjesus** (5.5): This song aged pretty quick for me not going to lie. Their earlier 3 albums still go hard in my rotation though. As well as ‘First Time’, the second single they released after the travesty of ‘Pom Poms’ before they went on hiatus. It had me so hyped...

**vapourlomo** (5): Alexa, play Portugal The Man but worse

**InternetDude19** (4.5): I hate car commercials.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): When u come back u better come back with a song that sounds like 45 other songs if u want it to be successful

**bandnitos** (4): this came out like two months ago how is this on here

**ManofOranges** (4): This was an incredibly underwhelming comeback single.

**palengard389** (4): Bland

**rhyneston3** (4): These are getting harder to be positive about. It’s ok, but Aly and AJ deserved the comeback that the Jonas Brothers had

**FrankBedbroken** (3): this is literally portugal the man's feel it still

**skargardin** (3): You really can get away with the most banal songs and yet hit #1

**steelstepladder** (3): This song is bad, and it's too slow, and the guitars suc,k and it's just bad

**gannade** (1): burnin up was their peak

**ExtraEater** (10): Really, really good. I don't follow Todd in the Shadows, but I heard he made this his #1 of the year in 2016 with no explanation? Well, he clearly didn't need one

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is the most iconic song of the generation between millenial and gen z. Every lyric is memorable and memeable. It has the most popular lyric video of all time and it is just such a vibe and a mood and all that shit. We stan The Godsmokers and halsey too i guess.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Yeah, this song is iconic as hell. And it’s actually pretty good, we were way too hard on it in 2016.

---

**timothy444** (11): I already wrote a full essay on why this song deserves a 10 in the All Star rate so just go there if you want to know my opinion on that. Also giving this my 11 because eff you to anyone who gives this their 0

**1998tweety** (10): Nostalgic masterpiece, we love a song that's super easy to sing along to.

**CarlieScion** (10): i think this is the first time im not giving this my 11 when it's appeared in a rate

**hikkaru** (10): i'll see you all in 2021 when we vote this into all stars 4

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): SO BABY PULL ME CLOSER

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Pop perfection that none of you want to admit is perfection cause it was overplayed and has a straight white male singing in it.

**ManofOranges** (10): Closer stans rise up! This song is a cultural reset and I am not open to hearing any dissenting opinions on this matter.

**rhyneston3** (10): Oh look a banger

**Roxieloxie** (10): I want the oldheads of popheads to know we're not gonna stop rating this song until it fucking wins. Im sorry yall only like to listen to norweigin blonde pop girlies that have names like Šætrüß that make beep boop music and sing about going down on some man they've known for two minutes, but your target model fave isnt making the charts anytime soon, this is

**steelstepladder** (10): Have y'all heard the Kidz Bop version of this? It's magical

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): time to make this songeniality for the 3rd time!!!

**TiltControls** (10): I better see a perfect 10 average to make up for all-stars

**vapourlomo** (10): It's honestly insane that the Chainsmokers, who are awful, lucked into two of the decade's best pop songs (the other being Roses)

**camerinian** (9): the song’s good OK can we please stop rating it now

**InternetDude19** (9): This is pop music.

**runaway3212** (9): This song just slaps

**skargardin** (9): Talent

**starlightzone** (9): Guilty pleasure song but not so guilty that I feel bad about giving it a good score. I really love the song. It was a song I kind of listened to a lot because Spotify put it on their random playlists a lot and I’m a basic gay ass bitch but I actually really like it. I feel like this is a Sunday Morning song and that’s all I’ve got to say on it.

**Xanleth** (9): Patrick Monahan wishes he could write a chorus as quirky and catchy as the one this song has.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.1): (#38) If you wanted to move Boulders, just use HM05 Strenght!

**alwayswords** (8): this song is kinda annoying but it has nostalgic value to me so [2]

**bambamhenny** (8): overplayed as fuck but it ain't trash

**FKJVMMP** (8): If I was still in high school when this song came out I feel like this would define my life forever.

**bulforster** (7.7): Oh lord, again? A-fucking-gain? Nothing new, nothing changed, same old shit! Same old fucking shit! (I don't even dislike this song but we *just* rated it!)

**rickikardashian** (7.3): we need to start thinking of different rates we can also submit this to. Another all-stars, the biggest #1 hits rate, another meme rate. I'm not dropping my hope in this song until it wins line or deserves

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I get why we all hated this song by the end of its run

**Awhile2** (7): this song was ruined for me when i learned the lyric is bite that tatoo and not like that tatoo

**Popfan2489** (7): not a bad song itself, but influenced all the bad songs that would later come

**vayyiqra** (7): We just rated this so I'm going to copy and paste my comment from that:

**MasterWizardRyan** (6.8): One of The Chainsmokers better songs imo

**Jexan13** (6.5): I remember listening to this thanks to a fuck-boi who shared it with me (it was never popular in my country), and kinda hating it, wondering why he shared that song made by literally whos. Later I discovered that it was massive everywhere lmao. It grew unto me but... meh

**bandnitos** (6): why are y'all so whipped for this song its just a basic edm pop song omfg

**fadedblue09** (6): I already rated this in the All Stars, and I’m just giving it the same score and move on.

**nightjesus** (6): Look not gonna lie but the actions being described in the song sounds like y’all need some therapy.

**starla\_** (5): for some reason this song makes me feel nostalgic even tho i don’t relate to it at all, it’s just so catchy with the fucking handclaps.

**static\_int\_husp** (5): Considering how many times we've rated this song, you would think I would have a stronger opinion on this song, but I don't. It just kind of... exists

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VYFaybw9jp8

**waluigiest** (5): I’m tired of rating this please stream Bing Bong by Christine Sydelko instead

**Awkward\_King** (4): invented music music didn’t exist before this song neither did culture invented music and culture and art

**megm26** (3.5): i almost forgot how much i hated this song

**anothertown** (3): See i had written “i hate this instrumental chorus” for my comment here, but then stupid love dropped

**bespectacIed** (3): Props for it being the face of the late 2010s EDM prosperity

**ReallyCreative** (3): for a better song, stream You Closer by Gretchen Lieberum

**rslashpoopheads** (3): HOW many times I gotta rate this shit? My score is just gonna keep going down. Amazing prechorus, absolute shit everything else.

**wavingwolves** (3): no, thanks

**CritneySpearz** (2): I mostly did this rate to make sure this abysmal song does not win, sorry Halsey

**\_\_Avaritia** (1.5): Still mad this song single-handedly killed electronic music in pop, horrendous hook, pretentious lyrics, was unique on release but sounds formulaic now, and above all, this doesn't make me want to fucking dance!

**FrankBedbroken** (1): i was very very close to making this my pick for the 0, but at the end of the day i just can't bring myself to do so because it's not completely worthless

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): giving this the same score that i did in all-stars 3

&#x200B;

serious now: damn it really has been 4 years. I remember hearing this at my uni bar before I enrolled there and just feeling euphoric that Halsey was getting the attention I felt she deserved. These days I think she's getting attention and then some but hearing this will always improve my mood. And yes, I gave this my 11 3 years ago in the 2016 EP Rate. The day I realized this sub would never love Halsey like I do. Which is why I'm fucking every last one of y'all up who sabotage this absolute classic earworm. Also I've never seen the lyric video in full, I only care about the official video.

**ExtraEater** (10): This is really really catchy and it’s great. Basically all there is to it

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): It’s grown on me but I can’t really give it the full endorsement.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): a grower and then swiftly a shrinker, I Don’t really care for Better Now.

---

**alwayswords** (10): i love the socks line

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): This song made Post a main pop girl officially

**ignitethephoenix** (10): king of writing pop hooks

**TragicKingdom1** (10): if this song somehow makes day 2 i will be elated

**InternetDude19** (9.5): Post Malone can be a great pop singer when he wants to be.

**starlightzone** (9.5): I really really like this song. I heard it when I didn’t know who Post Malone was and it’s all I can think about. It’s so good.

**MrMoodle** (9.4): Main pop girl Posty comes through. The subversion from “you probably think” to “you know I say that” in the chorus is really good. Honestly a pretty spot-on take on how people front/try to delude themselves as being “better off without him/her” after a breakup. Sounds great. Posty’s much better at poppy tunes like this and Circles than his more hip-hop oriented songs.

**1998tweety** (9): Bop, I do find it gets a bit repetitive after a while but at least it sounds nice.

**bandnitos** (9): this was the song that made me accept that post malone is good

**Jexan13** (9): the only Posty's b&b single that is actually good

**stickywheels46** (9): Gotta big up our main pop girl, Postie

**timothy444** (9): Millenial power

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): king of trap pop. pop trap? whatever. king of his genre.

**anothertown** (8): this fucking goes and he is serving a vocal

**hikkaru** (8): it's so damn catchy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): the only good song on b&b

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Another catchy, slightly darker banger, good chorus but a little disappointing outro and verses

**camerinian** (7): funnily enough, it was after this song that you could go around saying Post Malone's music was better now

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): (#51) I too, am better now that this Postie isn't around. This is denial, in the 5 Stages of Post Malone Grief.

**CritneySpearz** (7): ok this is the only decent Post Malone song..

**fadedblue09** (7): A bit generic but has its own memorable charm.

**ManofOranges** (7): Serviceable, I guess.

**ReallyCreative** (7): isn't this just Without Me but by a man

**Xanleth** (7): A better song indeed.

**nightjesus** (6.5): I’m finding I really only liked his first album.

**FKJVMMP** (6): The guitar is clearly just Change (In The House Of Flies), but that’s a good song so whatever.

**runaway3212** (6): A solid song, but gets old pretty fast.

**skargardin** (6): Still kind of fail to see how this is such a fan favorite on B&B but oh well

**waluigiest** (6): am I too old for this

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): The 80's version is like infinitely better

**jackisboredtoday** (5.4): this song isn’t it, but post malone is in fact better now that this new album was actually decent

**survivorthrowaway5** (5.1): generic

**palengard389** (5): Not a fan

**rslashpoopheads** (5): boring

**steelstepladder** (5): More like Post Malone is much better now

**rhyneston3** (4): I either really love or don’t like Post’s big hits, and this is in the don’t like category

**vayyiqra** (4): How many more songs does main pop girl Post Malone have in this rate because I really do not like his music. Nothing personnel, though.

**Roxieloxie** (3): i only like two songs by austin and this is not one of them [3]

**bespectacIed** (1): how does post have 4 songs so far in this chart, literally a terrorist

**ExtraEater** (10): The first song I got on the Jay Sean - Down radio from Pandora. Nothing but masterpieces in that station. Oh, and this song was legitimately winning for the first 10 submissions or so. Really sad I didn’t close the rate then and there, tbh

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Taio Cruz? Icon. Ludacris? Icon. Taio Cruz feat. Ludacris? Iconic.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): Yep...this song surely exists. I can’t believe this hit #1.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Two kings one bop. I really want Taio Cruz to have a massive comeback, he always serves.

**bandnitos** (10): wooOOOOOOOoooo

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Taio Cruz is an icon that we didn’t deserve. This is pop perfection and I also think this is better than Dynamite.

**letsallpoo** (10): the "just dance" to "dynamite"'s "poker face"

**palengard389** (10): Really good but sadly feels forgotten

**Roxieloxie** (10): FUCK I LOVE THIS SONG. IT IS PEAK EVERYTHING. Ughh this song is so good, it's like 10 years old and i still go hard as fuck to it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): omg i haven’t heard this song in years…what a fucking bop

**timothy444** (10): Better than Dynamite

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Love the synth arpeggios throughout and overall production, catchy as hell, Ludacris' feature is nice

**hikkaru** (9): dynamite is better bit this is still a classic

**nightjesus** (9): problematic lyrics with great production.

**rhyneston3** (9): I wish this was bigger than dynamite

**starlightzone** (8.5): I forgot all about Taio Cruz but I have to admit he hits a shit ton of good notes and does some really great songs. This is absolutely one of them. I don’t even hate Luda (jk no one can hate Luda)

**vapourlomo** (8): Man, we need Luda to spit guest verses on pop songs again

**wavingwolves** (8): taio cruz good

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): Taio Cruz is a powerful symbol in my life for my youth and the simply joy of middle school and the early 2010s

**bespectacIed** (7): bop

**ReallyCreative** (7): it is truly tragic how much Ludacris takes away from this otherwise amazing song

**skargardin** (7): Kings

**waluigiest** (7): I’m convinced no one has ever actively decided to listen to this song

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.2): (#59) Where did both of them go?

**vayyiqra** (6): oh Taio Cruz has more than one hit who knew and it's okay I guess, just a typical electro kind of dance-pop song

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Now THIS is dated.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4.5): did we really need 2 taio cruz songs in the top 100 of the decade lol

**FKJVMMP** (4): Dynamite without the benefit of nostalgia.

**steelstepladder** (4): More like break your fart

**brodiepp** (3): didn’t age well

**ManofOranges** (3): Nostalgia goggles must be what makes people like this song so much because I cannot fathom any other reason at all why a song like this would be liked.

**InternetDude19** (2.9): Save me Luda.

**fadedblue09** (1): Why are there 2 Taio Cruz songs here??? And I don’t recall this one??

**Xanleth** (1): why was Taio Cruz a thing.

**ExtraEater** (10): That hook is really catchy

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): The one emotion Bieber can actually pull off: genuine confusion and frustration.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): In the same vein as Sorry, I don’t know why this has been super overrated in retrospect. It’s good, but it’s not a great song in the grand scope of the decade.

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): my absolute favorite from him

**rhyneston3** (10): What a comeback! Love the whistle like instrument

**timothy444** (10): His last legitimately good song

**starlightzone** (9.8): Okay this beat is really a smash hit and I’m really fond of it. It’s good. It’s so good. I love the variety of instruments.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Big bop, this style change for JB did wonders on his career.

**InternetDude19** (9.5): Bieber's best single, and it sounds like Super Mario 64.

**nightjesus** (9.5): Where have you gone Justin? I miss this.

**runaway3212** (9): Justin Bieber at his most basic, but it really works in his favor.

**steelstepladder** (9): More like what do you mean you're not going to make more songs like this and instead make crap like Yummy?

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): sadly this is way better than his other stuff now

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): yummy wishes.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.4): I feel like Tropical House gets a bad name, but it can be done right. And Belieb it or not, he really did help popularize it in mainsteam pop music.

**anothertown** (8): the Purpose singles did not miss!!!!!!

**bloupp** (8): Great comeback single, ahem, looking at you...

**camerinian** (8): BE MORE STRAIGHTFORWARD is an underrated two seconds of pop from this decade

**Jexan13** (7.5): My bf says that this and Lean On are responsible for the terrible wave of boring chill pop with atrocious edm drops instead of chorus that plagued 2015-2018

**bandnitos** (7): the thing of celebrities holding up countdown signs was so weird

**ManofOranges** (7): Another actually pleasant Justin song, although Sorry is far and away the better song.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (7): at first both this and Sorry sound fantastic and a total 180 twist in quality for Bieber but eventually both just feel like decent pop songs.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Bland but cute.

**skargardin** (7): A good comeback single

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Kinda interesting bop with the tick-tock sounds and the chorus but a little forgettable not helped by Justin's meh singing

**hikkaru** (6): meh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i remember when this song came out and my brother was so pissed that he had to like a justin bieber song

**vayyiqra** (6): I like the instrumental to this but it's the Bieb, who I do not like, so idk what to give this. I guess I will be merciful.

**waluigiest** (6): sorry outsold!!!

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i’m only just realising how similar sorry and what do you mean sound

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.2): (#72) Justin sounds like he's either 8 or doing a very bad stand up routine. "Girls are so confusing, am I right fellas?"

**fadedblue09** (5.2): Not bad, but fuckboi-core songs really don’t do it for me.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (5): Overrated

**wavingwolves** (4.5): this was a time when i almost hated pop music. this song and the whole subgenre it represents is something i don't miss

**brodiepp** (4): bored of all these justin hits

**ReallyCreative** (4): there is absolutely no flavor to this

**survivorthrowaway5** (3.5): trashy, sanctimonious lyrics

**Xanleth** (3): A better JB song but still bad.

**bespectacIed** (2): Sounds like Closer and The Middle

**Roxieloxie** (2): yeah, i dont like the lyrics of this one enough to overturn my love of the beat

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2): this is literally just a slightly tamer and less creepy version of blurred lines

**ExtraEater** (9): The highlight of the track is easily the Cry Me a River interpolation, which usually just makes me wish I was listening to that song instead. It’s catchy, but leaves a lot to be desired (and there is no way that this was a more popular 2010s song than Call Me Maybe. This inverse system is wack)

**ImADudeDuh** (9): How tf did this get so big? It’s a bop, but like, it’s just Halsey trying to drag G-Eazy for 3 minutes and it worked and became her second biggest song of all time? Wild.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): Jeez, I didn’t realize how MASSIVE this song is. #12 on the Decade-End? Impressive. The song’s alright though.

---

**CarlieScion** (11): i see halsey, i give 11.

**bandnitos** (10): call me problematic but this deserved the success it got

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): idk why (yeah i don't know why) but this is one of my favorite songs of all time lol. it's just randomly perfect. when i found out it's about G-Eazy i got kinda disappointed though, but whatever it's still amazing.

**poppinmmolly** (10): before Manic dropped, this was my favorite song Halsey had put out. Now it's Finally//Beautiful Stranger, but this is still one of my favorite singles from her.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I've always liked Ms. Halsey from afar,as another black bisexual i appreciated the space she took up in pop culture. I really should think about getting into her because i've loved all of her recent singles. also i love my halsey stan mother, kina

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I've heard this like 2583 times and I'm somehow still not tired of it. Basic bop of the decade!

**timothy444** (10): Mega bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a really solid pop song. Also I didn’t realize how big this was

**rhyneston3** (9.5): Her Victoria’s Secret fashion show performance of this is amazing

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): the best song on manic, just because its subtle doesnt mean the songwriting isnt incredible

**hikkaru** (9): i DO like this song but i DON'T understand why it was so enormous? it's not halsey's best and it sounds no different from all the other trap pop songs out there

**Jexan13** (9): in a dream world we would be rating Nightmare

**ManofOranges** (9): I'm kinda surprised by how much I like this song. I couldn't tell you why but it just work for me.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Not sure what John Mayer was on calling this Halsey's best song. It's nice and I'm glad she got a big hit, it's a good medium between her style and a mainstream sound, but that's not what I go to Halsey for. At least it's better than Graveyard. It's weird af seeing this so high though, it does not feel like the 12th biggest song of the decade at all. Half of this list feels like bigger hits.

**bambamhenny** (8): funny how i actually discovered this song from an NHL player's spotify playlist

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's pretty good but I have no idea why it blew up as much as it did

**runaway3212** (8): A very very good song

**vayyiqra** (8): Halsey is overhated and that's the tea. I can understand not liking her voice because it's so raspy, but she is a good songwriter and I will stand by that.

**Xanleth** (8): Great stuff.

**alwayswords** (7): generic but still a bop

**bespectacIed** (7): I am shocked by the high placement of this but I know I shouldn't because this was a massive HIT. Cute, catchy song.

**skargardin** (7): One of my least favorite songs on Manic, I've gotta say..

**starlightzone** (7): It’s a basic pop song. That’s it. It’s fine. It’s nothing extraordinary. Sorry Halsey. Don’t come for me.

**themagicwemade** (7): why does she pronounce "high" like that. "feeling so aigh but too far away to hold me" ?? messy

**waluigiest** (7): this rate is really teaching me that chart performance is barely related to cultural footprint

**InternetDude19** (6.8): This has grown on me quite a bit.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Solid tune even if it kinda drags a little and it's kind of generic, Halsey's lyrics and vocals show a lot of growth

**MrMoodle** (6.5): can the basement that they run p*pheads out of just collapse already.

**1000\_nights** (6): I do not understand how this ended up above Royals, Call Me Maybe and All About That Bass

**gannade** (6): im a huge halslay fan but how tf was this so big out of ALL her songs

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.9): (#65) I literally skipped a comment on this and didn't even notice until submitting. Then, I remembered I got nothing meaningful to say other than this song is boring as shit.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): what a lazy use of cry me a river

**FrankBedbroken** (5): one of the better songs i've heard from her but she still does nothing for me as a performer and i just find it uninteresting and not compelling whatsoever sorry

**nightjesus** (5): It’s chill. I haven’t actually listened to the song all the way through until now. It’s okay.

**starla\_** (5): probably my least favourite Halsey song

**anothertown** (4): welcome to my kitchen

**vapourlomo** (4): This song is bland as hell

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i’m really surprised this song is this high in the decade end list? i guess it makes sense because this spent an absurd amount of time in the top 10 but it just feels like it had so little relevance and impact kinda?

**wavingwolves** (3.5): this is the one of worst songs halsey has and i hate it was so big because i like halsey but i highly dislike this

**camerinian** (3): I definitely could liiiIIiIIiiIIiiIIiive without hearing this song again

**fadedblue09** (2.8): Can’t stand these whiny vocals

**FKJVMMP** (2): One of the saddest attempts at cashing in on personal drama I’ve ever heard. Halsey’s so good on other people’s songs, I don’t know what happens to her on her own songs.

**kappyko** (2): this is an awful use of halsey's talents - she's been far more interesting

**steelstepladder** (2): This song is sooooooooo slow. It moves at a snails pace if I step on the snail and kill it.

**survivorthrowaway5** (2): sellout song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i hate halsey’s voice so much

**ExtraEater** (10): Choice lyrics - “You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty”, “By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times”, “missing more than *just* your body”, etc. At the end of the day, though, the star of the song is the production and melody. Very catchy pop tune

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Jesus Christ, Bieber is such an asshole [2]. Thank God Skrillex gave us one of the best pop songs of the decade.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): This is a great song, but it’s not a pop masterpiece of the 2010s that a lot of people praise it to be. Maybe Justin’s current era made me sour on this, but I think that i’ve always felt that this was overrated by pop fans and critics alike.

---

**CritneySpearz** (10): can’t deny that it fucking slaps

**ignitethephoenix** (10): always will be a massive bop

**nightjesus** (10): This song fucking slaps and I love the video clip to this song.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): justin really pulled this whole comeback off just to later release something like yummy huh

**rhyneston3** (10): So good, wish he still made bangers like this

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): his peak. will never get close to it.

**starlightzone** (9.8): NO IM NOT EXPLAINING THIS DON’T ASK. ITS GOOD. STOP ASKING.

**wavingwolves** (9.6): one of the best hit songs of the decade tbh

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Instrumental has aged like wine, great bop that isn't as dragged down by Justin's singing or meh lyrics, main melody isn't as annoying as I thought

**ManofOranges** (9): This is Justin's best song in my opinion. Although I think the chorus or drop or whatever you want to call it is really weak and could be better, the rest of the song is actually really catchy and not repulsive like other Justin songs are.

**starla\_** (9): i kinda miss tropical house

**waluigiest** (9): this is a major bop he really ate it

**vapourlomo** (8.5): Biebs' 2nd best song (behind One Time, of course)

**1998tweety** (8): What Do You Mean > Sorry periodt. I got kind of bored of this after a few listens but its still a bit of a bop.

**bambamhenny** (8): loved the mv

**bulforster** (8): Skrillex really snapped here, too bad the lyrics make my skin crawl.

**stickywheels46** (8): One of the only good Bieber songs

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Definitely his peak.

**fadedblue09** (7.2): Best Bieber song on this list.

**FKJVMMP** (7): Skrillex is a god and needs to make more pop music. Preferably with actual good artists.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (7): the production on this is good and all but i still don't get why some people treat this as some sort of groundbreaking revolutionary pop masterpiece. Bieber's annoying whispery voice is still there and the lyrics are pretty lame. but it's still lowkey a bop i guess.

**runaway3212** (7): Not as good as the other purpose era singles, but also not bad.

**themagicwemade** (7): i consider this an apology for yummy

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this just makes me think of when youtube rewind was somewhat decent

**InternetDude19** (6.5): I can't believe this actually worked.

**Roxieloxie** (6.5): re: one dance, i dont know how i feel about non ethnic trop pop, the beat of this is good but the lyrics are so bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): at least its not yummy

**bandnitos** (6): its very dated now but it was alright

**hikkaru** (6): not horrible.... but meh

**skargardin** (6): It just doesn't hit as it used to..

**steelstepladder** (6): We're gonna need another apology soon for Yummy

**vayyiqra** (6): We just rated this, and I repeat that this song is very catchy, but annoying. I hate the way he says "sahhrry". That's not the Canadian way! I really can't stand the Bieb and wish he would go away.

**FrankBedbroken** (5): he's still a massive asshat but thank u skrillex for the beat, probably one of his better tropical-ish productions

**ReallyCreative** (5): meh

**Jexan13** (4.5): clairvoyant king asking forgiveness 5 years in advance for releasing Yummy

**ComeOnPupperfish** (3): (#86) This has only soured on me.

**Xanleth** (2): I don’t like Bieber.

**bespectacIed** (1): not sorry (shady af comebacks 💅)

**timothy444** (1): Why are we rating this twice? Rating it lower this time because you made me listen to 'Sorry' twice this year now.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Imagine Dragons makes good music and idk why people don’t like them. They’re right in the middle of pop and rock, yet they aren’t rock enough for rock fans, not poppy enough for pop fans, and with them being everywhere, that just leaves them an easy target to get shit on by everyone and it sucks cause they make good songs. Radioactive is the best rock song of the 2010s and if rock fans don’t call it a rock song, then their stubborness of what can and can’t be rock is the reason that rock has barely changed sounds in the past decade and why it’s flopping on the chart. Also, Dan Reynolds is a fucking ally so we do stan.

**ExtraEater** (9): The intro and bridge are oddly hypnotizing. The drop is alright.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): It’s actually not bad now that I’m not hearing it on the radio 24/7.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Massive banger, it's weird and different but it works.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Instrumental goes hard as hell, dubstep synths accentuate it perfectly, Dan has a fantastic performance as well

**bambamhenny** (10): bonus points for being a song created for the trainwreck of a spider-man musical

**hikkaru** (10): I FEEL IT IN MY BONES ENOUGH TO MAKE MY SYSTEM BLOW :bop3:

**rhyneston3** (10): So atmospheric! Angsty teen me loved this so much

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh shit i didnt know this was here too, go ahead and get your low scores for this here and not in my rate. This is an iconic song from this decade and it still goes fucking hard for some reason

**runaway3212** (10): The last good Imagine Dragons song

**skargardin** (10): I still fux with this song, maybe my favorite Imagine Dragons song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): imagine dragons are good you guys just dont know how to have fun

**starlightzone** (9.3): LET’S HAVE SOME FUN THIS BEAT IS SICK I WANNA TAKE A RIDE ON YOUR RADIOACTIVE STICK.

**fadedblue09** (9): Definitely their best hit.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Invented Nickelback.

**timothy444** (9): I'm kind of glad that Radioactive is this high into the chart. It's Imagine Dragons but it's pretty heavy for a pop rock song and everything just goes off! They definitely nailed the post-apocalyptic mood of Radioactive

**Xanleth** (9): Still the best Imagine Dragons song.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I know I’m just going to roll my eyes at the imagine dragons hate that will come this way

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): remember going apeshit when they did this with kendrick at the grammys (or maybe another award show idk) and now they're garbage. sucks to see it.

**bespectacIed** (8): Imagine Dragons has a bad reputation but their first album is genuinely entertaining imo. Demons? It's Time? This song? All grits. Also, DAD reynolds, just a crumb, sir? Just a crumb, please.

**themagicwemade** (8): i used to say imagine dragons was my favorite artist in middle school and i would go back and punch myself given the opportunity. radioactive still good though.

**waluigiest** (8): honestly iconic this was huge

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): (#45) Funny how we're rating the three artists from the Commercial Pop rate and this somehow isn't my lowest score here. (Hint: it will be there.)

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): *deep breath* … *exhale*

**megm26** (7.5): i don’t hate this but marina’s radioactive is much better stream https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dU7GoCKSQfg

**camerinian** (7): God I used to really like this, but fuck Imagine Dragons

**hunnybee12** (7): man did i think i was hard listening to this when i was 12

**nightjesus** (7): My farts are radioactive ngl.

**ReallyCreative** (7): overplayed and corny but I can't deny I love the delivery of the chorus, I also like the noise after "breathing in the chemicals" and I will likely be the only person in this sub with that opinion lol

**Tolk1en** (7): A bit too rock for me.

**vayyiqra** (7): Yes, we know Imagine Dragons bad, but out of their big hits this is one of their better ones. The lyrics are kind of goofy (for one thing, why is he talking about chemicals, when radioactivity is a different thing) but the chorus is so anthemic I have to like it. I also never noticed how noisy and distorted the production is, but I kind of like it as well. On a side note, the comments on Genius that analyze the lyrics with in-depth discussion of biochemistry and Marxism are kind of hilarious. Who knew ID stans were so intellectual.

**ManofOranges** (6): I remember this one girl I didn't like in middle always, for some reason, saying "welcome to the new age" and it ruined this song for me a little bit.

**steelstepladder** (6): More like Imagine better music

**vapourlomo** (6): Still have some residual high school nostalgia from this one. Sorry, I don't hate it

**bulforster** (5.8): I'm pretty sad that this is worse than I remember.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.5): i have a feeling i will be dragging night visions next month

**alwayswords** (5): where is the inappropriate riverdale scene for this imagine dragons song

**FrankBedbroken** (5): oooooo i used to love this back when it came out but this has just aged awfully, the era of pop trying to merge itself with brostep was nooooot good

**bandnitos** (3): why did we let them prosper

**wavingwolves** (3): this just sounds like a publicity ad for itself

**stickywheels46** (2): This is just video game trailer music
