ExtraEater: A few days ago, I saw [this cool post](https://redd.it/fel5sk) about #101-200 of the decade-end. For those wondering, I assume [this guy](https://pulsemusic.proboards.com/post/7178443) is the source. The link I just gave only has 101-125, but I'm sure they've got the raw data for 126-200 somewhere

Anyway, after seeing that I thought, "Wow that's a lot of bops" and also "Oh if only I knew about the whole 100 for ideas for the bonus rate". Well, to honor it, [here's the entire #101-200 section of the Decade-End as SpongeBob](https://imgur.com/a/95kWcvU). Enjoy while you wait for the reveal

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Need You Now is probably the first country song I’ve ever loved. I remember when this song would come on the radio and I would always sing along with my mom. Even though I was 12 years old, i still sang with the passion of a 29 year old who just ended their 8 year relationship 2 months ago and is regretting every moment apart from them. The opening piano chords are beautifully sparse. Hilary Scott gives an passionate, yet lowkey performance to open up. Everything has a muted feel to it, and then just before the chorus hits it gets quiet and then… IT’S A QUARTER AFTER ONE! And everything kicks up for those next few lines. Then we get to Charles Kelley’s gruffer, more textured vocals, a perfect balance along with Hilary’s delicate vocals. This song is just a pure beauty and is even a lucky member of the “I don’t like country, but i like this!” club along with Before He Cheats, Not Ready to Make Nice, Tennessee Whiskey, Johnny Cash, and Kacey Musgraves. I’m so happy this made it to day 4 in a rate full of the most popular songs of the decade.

**ExtraEater** (10): When I was very young, I used to think this song was by Evanescence. Anyway, major bop with a great guitar solo.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): That was a classic, that was a classic.

---

**camerinian** (10): we love an actual "wtf I'm crying in the club rn" tune

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#6) My favorite country song. Yes, I know it barely counts.

**fadedblue09** (10): We love a country bop! And the only decent country song in this list tbh.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is one of my favorite songs of all time. Lady Antebellum are absolute legends and they knew exactly what they were doing when they made this song. It's got a perfect mix of everything a song needs and it's so effortless in its execution. I'm actually kinda mad this song is being rated just because I'm not excited to see popheads butcher it.

**rickikardashian** (10): pop-country heartbreak is a level of depressing that I beg the world I never get to, because if I'm ever miserable enough to write a song like this, I know I won't make it

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Timeless drunk anthem.

**runaway3212** (10): This song is made to drink wine to.

**skargardin** (10): Oh I haven't heard this in YEARS, such an amazing throwback

**starlightzone** (10): okay im gonna sound crazy but the beginning feels like a Kingdom Hearts song, and then it hits this smooth country and it’s just this beautifully sad thing where they want the other to come back BUT THEY CAN’T.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the only good country song

**1000\_nights** (9.5): Country music!! Yeah!

**1998tweety** (9.5): We love country ballads.

**InternetDude19** (9.5): A nice change of pace with the rest of this rate.

**bambamhenny** (9): this song was too grown for me to be crying to it back then

**bespectacIed** (9): A great country song, let alone a great country act? Rarer than Halley's comet

**ignitethephoenix** (9): when I say I like some country music, it’s songs like this

**nightjesus** (9): Hang on just a second. Is this the original version? I swear the production and mixing sounded so much better. Ah yeah after a quick check there is two versions. I like the other version a tiny bit better. But it’s not changing my score because this song is a damn classic.

**steelstepladder** (9): Hey remember when country music was actually country?

**themagicwemade** (9): it'S A QUARTER AFTER ONE

**waluigiest** (9): bruh I was in middle school deep in my feelings because of this song

**wavingwolves** (9): a perfect song to sing while drunk

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): didn’t care for this when it was big bc i was 11, but now i understand what sadness is and i can fully appreciate how everything comes together to make this fantastic

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): Yes it’s country but it’s a lowkey mascara-running mess of a hearbreak song.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): A touch overdrawn but nice and soap-opera-esque love ballad, lead guitar melody meanders a little but controls emotion of the song well, memorable piano progression as well

**bandnitos** (8): ITS A QUARTER AFTER O- *gunshot*

**vayyiqra** (8): I'm mad because I hate country but I like this song, as whiny and cheesy as it is. Maybe country made some points, although this is going out because of Popheads' well-known hatred of ballads and men singing.

**hikkaru** (7): issok

**timothy444** (7): Emotional

**Popfan2489** (6): boring verses fantastic chorus

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i forgot this existed. this feels so average wow

**alwayswords** (5): thinking about this psychology study that showed posting online about lady antebellum is correlated with low intelligence...

**rhyneston3** (5): I was gonna rate this higher but after listening to the Dixie Chicks I realized this is actually only mediocre

**starla\_** (5): until today i had never heard this song and i did not need to

**Roxieloxie** (4): im not a yeehaw head im so sorry

**ReallyCreative** (3): the harmonies are nice but there's nothing else about this track I like even a little bit

**Xanleth** (3): Not a country fan

**ExtraEater** (10): Great sample

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Big Freedia was featured on a number 1 song. Rupaul is a fucking FLOP!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Yes this song still slaps.

---

**camerinian** (10): UH HUUUUUUH THESE HOOOOOES

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#14) 'I keep letting you back in' examplifies my thoughts on Drake so well. I think he's over, then he releases shit like this, and I give him another shot when I know I shouldn't!

**FKJVMMP** (10): The girl power anthem that every girl power anthem should strive to emulate, and it was somehow made by this idiot.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Stop doing one of Drake’s best songs dirty guys

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is actually great, but I'm fully expecting it to be robbed because I know nobody will be able to see their Drake hate glasses.

**palengard389** (10): Drake’s best song by far

**Roxieloxie** (10): omg i didnt know nice for what was in here. The more yall make me rate this, the more i actually really like it. This has grown on me *alot*. I hate that it's by drake cause this is actually a really good song

**runaway3212** (10): Drake is amazing on this song and the message is amazing.

**skargardin** (10): Go off

**starla\_** (10): drake said women’s rights on this one

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): ultimate club banger

**vapourlomo** (10): Drake's best late-era single. Easily. That breakbeat and Lauryn Hill sample...mmm yes

**InternetDude19** (9.8): Every once in a while Drake will knock it out of the park.

**MrMoodle** (9.5): I cannot believe Drake’s shot at a class-conscious feminist anthem actually turned out this well, but here we are.

**1998tweety** (9): I think this is one of my fav Drake songs, the Lauryn Hill sample kind of carries it but his verses sound pretty good too.

**bulforster** (9): A beautiful hot mess. Mostly here for Lauryn and Freedia but these are the best Drake bars in the rate.

**hikkaru** (9): the best drake song here! periodt

**steelstepladder** (9): Fuck me Drake still has some bangers in him

**stickywheels46** (9): An anomalous hit in a sea of misses for Drake

**timothy444** (9): Why are we rating this twice?

**vayyiqra** (9): I feel like I just rated this song two days ago but anyway, the more I listen to this song the more I love the sample it's based around, and I like the lyrics a lot more too after looking up a detailed analysis of them. I know Popheads hates Drake, and I'm not a big fan of him either, but I really like this song. He might have boring albums, but he can write some really strong singles. Also, stream *The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill*.

**starlightzone** (8.8): I think this rapping works better for Drake than that short rapping he seems to do on some songs. Also I think he’s one of the Artists who really needs a collab to get him really hitting hard.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): the only truly fun drake song on this list

**bandnitos** (8): period

**ggal2020** (8): my favorite drake song

**poppinmmolly** (8): listen I really don't usually like Drake but this was an unexpected bop.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): thonking

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): did feminism better than meghan trainor

**wavingwolves** (8): this is so much better than god's plan and i don't get how it wasn't bigger

**fadedblue09** (7.6): Again, I’m skipping this and giving it the same score as I did in the All Stars.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.2): Drake has really lost steam over the years.

**Jexan13** (7): background music

**rhyneston3** (7): Jimmy made some points

**bespectacIed** (6): great intro, sample, and mv

**worlds-okayest666** (6): [insert Carly Rae Jepsen “Overrated. Not a fan.” gif here]

**anothertown** (5): this is the 3rd time i’ve rated this song and I say again, stream Ex-Factor by Lauryn Hill

**nightjesus** (5): It’s cool.

**waluigiest** (5): the weakest of the scorpion singles

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Honestly pretty boring and a little annoying even for Drake, kinda shouty rapping, not fond of the sample usage

**RandomHypnotica** (4): I'm always waiting for this song to finally kick off, then it just ends

**Xanleth** (1): Drake sucks.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): god i can’t believe people actually like drake’s music

**ExtraEater** (10): A considerably inoffensive and agreeable song for its themes of faith, hard work, and “who cares about money” kind of attitude. That’s not to detract against it, because it’s pretty catchy and that bridge is cool. Still, I much prefer “Good Life” from these guys.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Do the commercial pop rock rate this month!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): I like the energy to this. I love a good gospel shout-out.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a bop, OneRepublic always serve (Secrets remains their best single though).

**camerinian** (10): this…. This song is amazing. I've heard it a million times, and I think I'm only just now realising how fantastic this song is. The groove is tight, the lyrics are cute and the delivery is the best Ryan Tedder has ever sounded. I think I love this song. When did that happen

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#2) This deserves. It hurts that we're rating this twice, but in both times I find it the second best song in the rate, but not the first.

**hikkaru** (10): BANGER! CLASSIC!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Underrated bop from this decade

**rickikardashian** (10): when this first came out, I listened to it on a daily basis, but not this version, I would search for different versions of it and jam at any findable cover on YouTube. idk what was wrong with me

**Roxieloxie** (10): instead of plugging my rate here im gonna say that this song is a really good bop and a half.

**runaway3212** (10): I like everything in this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): damn maybe those jeep cherokee commercial soundtracks made a point

**timothy444** (10): Probably the only good "rock" song on this list

**TragicKingdom1** (10): gonna be wild when this goes out day 2 here and then wins next month

**Xanleth** (10): Absolute jam and would get my top score had Gotye not been on here.

**starlightzone** (9.9): I JUST LOVE THE BUILD UP IT HAS this song didn’t need to go as hard as it did and that VIDEO. Watch the video. That video is just incredible. I think this song is underrated and is worth every second it gets.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): summer 2013 anthem

**hunnybee12** (9): my favorite mom band

**rhyneston3** (8.5): Ryan Tedder is a really good songwriter, I don’t think I’ve ever heard a OneRepublic song I didn’t like

**ManofOranges** (8): I like the song but I don't love it. The chorus is also somewhat of a disappointment to me. It could be a little bit bigger or better.

**nightjesus** (8): I did love this song. It slaps.

**waluigiest** (8): okay I loved this song when it came out I had no idea it was this big lol

**wavingwolves** (7.5): reminds me of glee

**bespectacIed** (7): bop

**fadedblue09** (7): Pop-rock bop with wtf lyrics.

**starla\_** (7): this is a fun bop

**steelstepladder** (7): More like counting the days until we appreciate OneRepublic's late career music

**vayyiqra** (7): I want to not like this song, but that instrumental loop in the chorus is so damn catchy. I don't care about this band, but I like this song.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Very okayish slightly boring track (most of Native is better than this), but sounds decently triumphant and empowering, a little catchy

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): Bland but ok

**ReallyCreative** (6): there are some moments here but overall it just feels like this song is in that zone where it tries too hard to seem important and comes across as corny

**skargardin** (6): Kinda whatever, the chorus is catchy i suppose

**yourfacesucksass** (5.9): This song is so not it, how tf does no one else hear it??

**FKJVMMP** (5): I’d like it a lot more if OneRepublic could believably show any kind of emotion or pull off any style beyond bland Grey’s Anatomy rock. It sounds good enough, but I don’t buy it at all.

**Awhile2** (2): thank gofd we lef one republic in the 2010s

**bandnitos** (1): i refuse to press play i might go feral

**ExtraEater** (10): Okay, it’s not even the best 2010s pop song called “I Like It” that features latin pop superstars and hit Top 5 on the Billboard Hot 100, BUT it’s still really good. The way she goes “They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body…” for those bars is so catchy.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A latino anthem. I really hated this song at first, but by the end of summer, I was bopping to this all day. So happy to see that latin artists can still get number ones and Despacito wasn’t just a fluke.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): They picked a damn good sample, what can I say? I’m

---

**gannade** (11): a BOP

**1998tweety** (10): Mega bop, everyone here shines (although Cardi obvi steals the show) and adds a lot to the song.

**bespectacIed** (10): Belcalis' greatest contribution to humanity. "Yeah they call me Cardi B // I run this shit like cardi-o" ??? Iconic line. Bad Bunny what can I do for u king

**bulforster** (10): I do not like those Balenciagas, I think they look stupid but this song is so good I can forgive Cardi's taste in trainers.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#7) I too, like it!

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Deserved Record of the Year and other Grammies DO NOT @ me k?

**kappyko** (10): one of pop rap's biggest highs of the past decade - and bad bunny / j balvin are the best parts of this.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song has no right to be as good as it is, and yet it is as good as it is.

**rickikardashian** (10): I would let Bad Bunny **[redacted]** my **[redacted]** any time he wanted. All I want in return is **[redacted]**

**runaway3212** (10): Bold and amazing.

**starlightzone** (10): I think it might be my favorite Cardi B song. This is her 7 Rings except it’s more empowering and doesn’t compare her money to telephone numbers.

**vapourlomo** (10): Cardi's pinnacle (so far)

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Only flaw is J Balvin's mediocre feature, beat and sample and Cardi's flow and Bad Bunny all go hard, fantastic trap/Latin fusion

**camerinian** (9.5): even with all the performers firing on all cylinders, the best moment on this song is still that first bass drop in the opening sample. Fucking hard

**Awkward\_King** (9): im still not a massive fan of cardi but she can make a hit no doubt

**hikkaru** (9): bop

**survivorthrowaway5** (9): every cardi line is a hook

**themagicwemade** (9): i didn't really like any cardi songs until i heard this

**wavingwolves** (9): i love being latina yes

**ggal2020** (8): Song of the summer 2018

**InternetDude19** (8): I wish I enjoyed all Cardi songs this much.

**palengard389** (8): Always stop listening after Cardi’s part. Why are these other fools on this song?

**ReallyCreative** (8): I like It! I really do! The title is correct!

**Roxieloxie** (8): a latin bop

**steelstepladder** (8): More like I like it... wait

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): ultimate summer anthem. stream yhlqmdlg and colores.

**Tolk1en** (8): The song, the music video, the memes create a fun atmosphere

**waluigiest** (8): this had a moment and I’m grateful for it

**alwayswords** (7): shouldve only been cardi

**Awhile2** (7): stg americas going through a latin hit drought rn tusa bettr have hit number one by the time this ratte  reveal happens

**bandnitos** (7): fun

**FrankBedbroken** (7): tkm benito uwu

**nightjesus** (7): SPACI MAMI HOT TAMALE

**skargardin** (7): A cute moment

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Hmm, okay.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): cardi’s chorus > everything else in this song

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Love the intro, the rest not so much.

**timothy444** (3): The melody and beat is there but it doesn't mean the song is good.

**vayyiqra** (2): No. We already rated this, and I didn't like it then. I hate Cardi B's voice, and I don't care for J Balvin either, or the instrumental, or anything about this really. This is trash.

**Xanleth** (1): I don’t.

**ExtraEater** (10): I’m very thankful that Bruno Mars moved into this funky throwback-esque territory, because he is really good at it. Not much of his discography can hold a candle to that bridge, with its passionate wail of “Spend the rest of my days heeeere”.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The first big throwback sound that Bruno Mars did that got big, and it definitely changed the shift of pop music imo. It showed that the throwback sound definitely could be more than a novelty. It spawned so many other throwback sounds, including Bruno’s career post 2015.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): A banger. Bruno is a goddamn hit machine.

---

**Hogwartsreject1912** (11): OOOOOH OOOOH OOOOH OOOOH YEEAAH YEEAAHH YEAHHH!!!! THIS. IS. MUSICAL. PERFECTION.

**untutorable** (11): this is an ABSOLUTE banger

**1998tweety** (10): Probably one of my favourite Bruno Mars songs and I'm not entirely sure why, it just sounds extremely pleasing.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Bruno's magnum opus, perfect meld of modern and classic instrumental with Bruno's charismatic vocals, soaring chorus

**hikkaru** (10): treasure is better... but this is still a CLASSIC

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Bop robbed from the All Star rate

**ManofOranges** (10): This is probably my favorite Bruno Mars song of all time. Every single thing in this song, every little element adds to it and just makes it an absolute smash.

**steelstepladder** (10): Ahhh, the moment where bad Bruno turned into good Bruno

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): dont let this slapper of a song distract you from bruno mars saying owo in the bridge

**timothy444** (10): A huge massive bop that proves that anyone can leave behind everyone's musical perception of just another boring generic male singer.

**starlightzone** (9.7): am I a Bruno mars fan? When did this occur? Does Bruno Mars Is Gay?

**MrMoodle** (9.5): That buildup with the “for too lo-oo-wo-oo-wong”s is SO GOOD. Also, when I was listening to the song again for this rate I realised something cool about the structure - the whole point of the song is that basically Bruno is getting blue balled, i.e. being “locked out of heaven”, i.e. Bruno’s being a whiny entitled prick. But in the middle of the song, there’s that massive buildup, and you’re waiting for the release, and then… it just goes back to the verse? Bruno blue balls YOU. Eventually, you *do* get that drop after another long build-up, in which Bruno finally reaches heaven (“can I just stay here, spend the rest of my days here”) as the audience and Bruno collectively blow their loads. Maybe that was very obvious, but regardless, I find it very cool how the structure of the song takes you on a journey mirrored by the lyrics, regardless of how corny it is. My only real problem with the song is the “cuz your sex takes me to paradise” line, which, like, c’mon, subtlety.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): one of bruno's best. incredibly energy start to finish and never really gets old.

**bespectacIed** (9): Lukewarm take: Bruno is the biggest hitmaker of the decade after Rih.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): (#24) Get it, because sex is heaven. Urgh, the straights.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): this song always reminds me of a Police song I've never heard

**rslashpoopheads** (9): One of his best.

**runaway3212** (9): Bruno at his best

**vapourlomo** (9): The Police are crazy underrated

**camerinian** (8.5): OOH

**wavingwolves** (8.3): for the longest time i thought it was "you sext text me to paradise" and i found it both awkward and funny at the same time but last year i discovered the truth. very disappointing

**FKJVMMP** (8): This is my favourite Police song.

**Roxieloxie** (8): in 9th grade there was a kid that said this was his favorite song to listen to when he's sad and his sibllings are annoying him and he locks himself in his room and the teacher just looked at him and said "you know that songs about having sex right" and he looked so confused and sad

**waluigiest** (8): good energy

**FrankBedbroken** (7): even if it's a ripoff of the police it's still super enjoyable, probably his best song

**skargardin** (7): Boppy

**vayyiqra** (7): Why is there so much Bruno Mars in this rate this is more Bruno Mars than I have ever wanted to hear in my life. I have nothing against the guy, I just don't want to listen to him that much. Oh well, this is an okay song, even if it's blatantly trying to be a song by The Police. It's just "Message In a Bottle" but not as good. However, that song is an 11 so this one is decent.

**yourfacesucksass** (6.9): Every city’s “Mix” station still plays this daily

**nightjesus** (6): I mean it’s definitely a song I skip in playlists. Obviously I’m listening to the whole thing as I’m an honest bitch. It’s pleasant to listen to and I love the harmonies in the bridge. And the OOH sound is fun to do.

**survivorthrowaway5** (5.5): total heel turn but no controversy - imagine if a woman went from just the way you are to this

**bandnitos** (4): if you don't get your ass back to purgatory

**fadedblue09** (4): Never really liked this one.

**Xanleth** (2): Then welcome to Hell.

**ExtraEater** (10): Wrecking Ball’s [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wrecking_Ball_(Miley_Cyrus_song) for this includes a “mixed review” from the Philippine Daily Inquirer. I’m Filipino myself, and I have to ask: Why does the Wikipedia page include a review from the *Philippine Daily Inquirer*?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Miley Cyrus naked on a wrecking ball is one of the most memorable music video images of the decade for the sheer amount of thinkpieces and monocle popping it caused.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): The video>the song.

---

**Jexan13** (11): this is among the best songs of the decade. Such an incredible, perfect, powerful ballad.

**1998tweety** (10): Excellence, it annoys me that people drag this song when they really just don't like the video. Wrecking Ball is easily one of Miley's best songs and does not get the respect it deserves.

**Awkward\_King** (10): possibly the single most iconic song/video in pop culture this decade? definitely up there

**bespectacIed** (10): CULTURAL RESET. Gorgeous song and video.  One of the most unforgettable moments in pop history. Everything made in pop after this would never be daring enough in comparison.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is one of Miley’s best songs, sure the video was messy but iconic

**ManofOranges** (10): No matter how controversial this song was at the time back in 2013 and how I felt about it, I'll never deny that this is an absolute hit. A cultural reset.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): iconic song, iconic MV, just perfect, strong 11 contender

**Popfan2489** (10): iconic moment

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Miley was so hot in this MV.

**skargardin** (10): That was a classic

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): queen of wrecking my balls

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.2): this song was a whole moment although in an ideal world i would be giving we can't stop a 10 instead

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Explosive chorus, love the contrast with the rest of the song, Miley's singing is nice and sells the drama and longing of the lyrics even if the verses are just okay

**hikkaru** (9): a MOMENT, truly...

**ReallyCreative** (9): there are some aspects of the production that feel a little of the time, but this is such a powerful song

**Tolk1en** (9): I hate this when I was younger but it grew on me so much. I still refuse to look at the music video again.

**waluigiest** (9): was Miley’s Bangerz era the most culturally important moment of pop music in the last decade? No, but it might be in the top 10

**bandnitos** (8): i was 10 when this came out and i was unfazed by the video djjdhjfhjdf

**racloves** (8): the song isn’t amazing but it’s such an iconic pop culture moment

**rhyneston3** (8): This was a MOMENT. An unhygienic moment but a moment nonetheless

**steelstepladder** (8): More like this song wrecks my balls (but in a fun and kinky way)

**themagicwemade** (8): god what an event this song was

**wavingwolves** (8): miley bangerz era was really something

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I loved the buzz around it at the time but 7 years later I don’t give it any listens.

**ggal2020** (7.6): my gay awakening

**nightjesus** (7.5): Well I guess this song is relevant again.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): Why did we all lose our shit to the music video for this back in the day it wasn’t even that sexual lol

**FKJVMMP** (7): Never thought such a basic break up ballad could be this interesting.

**InternetDude19** (7): There is a great song in here.

**runaway3212** (7): The video tricked us into thinking this song was more interesting than it was.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): ok let’s be honest, without the iconic video and the moment it created how much less remembered would this meh ballad be?

**starlightzone** (6): I mean it’s FINE. It’s okay. It’s whatever. Her voice during it is weird and while I enjoy it, it’s a song I can’t justify any higher than this.

**vapourlomo** (6): We Can't Stop is better

**timothy444** (5): This is proof that Miley Cyrus has a mediocre music career and should've just stick with acting

**vayyiqra** (5): lol. I'm not even going to try to rate this fairly, because it's been ruined by the meme. I'm just going to give it a 5, a perfectly average score, and move on.

**Roxieloxie** (4): this was a moment, i dont know if it was cultural or not

**Xanleth** (3): This song got meme’d so hard it raises its value up.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (2): (#89) Ashley O outsold.

**kappyko** (1): for an era that branded her as the party girl her singles sure were some of the most boring shit she ever released

**fadedblue09** (0): Do people actually remember this song for its musical merit? All I remember is that awful video and all those tabloid attention-seeking antics Miley was doing. Without that, it’s nothing (and being on the low end of the list proves it). Sorry, but a song whose success thrived on mere desperation doesn’t deserve to be a decade-end hit.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Hozier has so many good songs. His debut was a folk classic* and Wasteland, Baby was an underrated (and in Pitchfork’s case, overhated) album. There was a really good writeup on the album [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/eanrfh/2019_rpopheads_album_of_the_year_14_hozier/) and I recommend anyone who liked Take Me To Church to give Wasteland Baby a chance!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Lesbians really won, huh. Good for y’all.

**ExtraEater** (9): I’ve never really liked Hozier because he just kinda feels like a watered down version of all his influences. He’s kind of in the same category as, like, Rag ‘n’ Bone Man. That being said, he knows his way around melodies, if this and Almost (Sweet Music) are any indication.

---

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): as an agnostic pansexual im legally required to give this my 11 sorry i dont make the rules

**1998tweety** (10): Excellence, I was really surprised to see this song blow up but I'm so glad it did. Tbh stuff like this probably helps normalize gay people so it's much appreciated (and it bops hard).

**alwayswords** (10): the lyrics :theflavor:

**bambamhenny** (10): let's go lesbians

**bandnitos** (10): gay rights

**bespectacIed** (10): Gay rats. One of most "un-pop" songs in the rate because it's actually well-written and nuanced and not just based on catchy melodies. It's so fucking beautiful.

**camerinian** (10): ugh this album is so fucking good

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Gay anthem from a heteroni and cheese we stan.

**rhyneston3** (10): Maybe Christianity made some points

**rickikardashian** (10): Todd put this in his inmemorable list when this dropped, the heartache I have isn't explainable

**Roxieloxie** (10): I cant believe im a hozier stan now, Removing the overplayed element of this, this song, and album tbt, goes so fucking hard yall

**skargardin** (10): King

**starlightzone** (10): This is just sultry and smooth and it makes me feel fucking sexy when I hear it. His voice is also SO GOOD.

**themagicwemade** (10): in my head i group this song with gotye's somebody i used to know for some reason

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): very very close to being my 11. a flawless work of art that has aged like fine wine.

**vayyiqra** (10): Did Hozier ever make it to church and also this song is definitely about fucking, but lesbian memes aside, is Hozier gay, or did he just want to make a song about homophobia to show support for gay men? :thinking: Maybe it's my Catholic upbringing but the combination of choral vocals and lyrics about sex (e.g. "Like a Prayer")  really gets me.  Catholicism is all about the weird intertwining of worship with repressed sexuality, of any orientation, so I get where he is coming from here being that he's Irish.

**waluigiest** (10): a god-tier song. I really ascended when this dropped. The way he blends the church/religion themes into the lyrics, the meaning, the production, and the orchestration..... masterful. Ally of the year.

**wavingwolves** (10): this is such a lesbian song

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): me being like a ten year old unknowing gay kid watching this music video and learning an ingrained fear of outwardly presenting my gayness. it’s a great video though

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): all hail the apparent king of the lesbians

**ManofOranges** (9): I was obsessed with this song when it came out. I absolutely loved it. I don't love it that much anymore but I still think it is top tier.

**nightjesus** (8.5): I forgot about this song. Damn it’s good.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): (#36) We love an anti-christianity bop.

**fadedblue09** (8): Out of the loop here: Why is Hozier big with lesbians?

**anothertown** (7): I really don’t respond to Hozier or anything about him at all but that chorus is undeniable

**runaway3212** (7): My sister played this song non stop for three months and I have never really recovered, but it's very good.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): This song really drags on.

**starla\_** (6): sorry to all my fellow sapphics but i just do not love hozier

**bulforster** (5.2): Needs more grit somehow, idk it's missing something. That high note on "DEATH-less" is especially weak.

**hikkaru** (5): kinda boring sorry...

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Decently dramatic instrumental is ruined by Hozier's gravelly singing, bad lyrics, every vocal melody from verse to bridge to chorus

**FKJVMMP** (4): I wish I felt as strongly about anything as Hozier feels about getting laid.

**ReallyCreative** (3): Sam Smith but make it straight

**vapourlomo** (3): This song is so plodding and awful. It bothers me that this is one of the few rock songs that broke through this decade

**palengard389** (2): Snoozefest

**Xanleth** (2): No.

**steelstepladder** (1): I have no idea why people think I Just Had Sex (Funeral March Edition) is good

**timothy444** (1): Boring

/u/fadedblue09 It's a meme, but I think the idea is he's one of the few men in pop nowadays who writes emotional lyrics, and it's a common joke lesbians make about themselves that they're overly emotional. As well his music sounds folksy so it fits with a meme that all lesbians want to live in the woods with their girlfriends and no one else. This is just what I've picked up kind of casually from the memes, but they do in fact like his music and find it resonates with them for whatever reason.

**ExtraEater** (10): Revenge is great but this is leagues better and a million times more nostalgic, and if you think this is bad/mediocre while the Minecraft parody is good you probably yell "Creeper!" out loud in public places

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/727/845/692.jpg

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I never played Minecraft, so I never got the meme. But this song still fucking slaps

---

#Yeah man!

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**Popfan2489** (10): best song ever

**rickikardashian** (10): CREEPER

**skargardin** (10): Deserved decade-end over that other tragedy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): creeper

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): revenge is still better extra

**timothy444** (10): omg i love revenge by captainsparklez

**vapourlomo** (10): I love EDM-era Usher! Sue me!

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a 12 and usher is a fucking king

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.5): This would be #20 in the list.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a great pop song.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): BANGER ALERT although Pitbull botches his feature, else it's catchy electropop that Usher does a great vocal performance for

**camerinian** (9): *insert Revenge reference here*

**runaway3212** (9): ,5 

**steelstepladder** (9): It's no Revenge but it's still good

**bulforster** (8.8): This is so much better than the Usher and Pitbull songs in the actual rate, America is tasteless.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): Despite how it is his poppiest song, he sounds so good and at home with it, even if it is different from most of his music. 2010 Usher took a turn and it was a good one.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): classic… fuck I love Usher’s voice so much

**Roxieloxie** (8): creper .... aw man

**anothertown** (7): Minecraft video

**bespectacIed** (7): Bop but Girls Generation - Karma Butterfly plagiarized and made it better

**starlightzone** (7): I mean it’s no Revenge by CaptainSparklez but it’s good.

**waluigiest** (7): ....rating this for the 2.5nd time in 2020

#Aww man!

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): i think you'll find the minecraft parody much superior

**bandnitos** (6): kind of overrated

**ManofOranges** (6): Stream revenge.

**racloves** (6): the minecraft remix would get a 10 duh

**FKJVMMP** (5): Extremely representative of early 2010s pop, in that Pitbull ruined it and it would have been much better if he just hadn’t been there.

**vayyiqra** (5): Maybe fittingly for a 2010s rate, the very last song is a meaningless club banger. I guess, like that messy decade itself, I will take it for what it is and move on.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): Can't believe you made me listen to this again.

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): this song is annoying and just when I'm really getting tired of it, Pitbull makes sure I will never choose to listen to it again

**Xanleth** (2): Do they though. Do they really?

**fadedblue09** (1.3): Can we all leave this kind of music in the past and move on. I can't believe there are people who are nostalgic for this stuff.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When Adele came out with this, it was such a pop culture moment. One of the best time to be watching the charts.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song is a whirlwind. Adele is a goddamn emotional hurricane and I love it.

**ExtraEater** (9): Good but I prefer When We Were Young

---

**starlightzone** (11): this is the song of the decade how do we even debate how beautiful this is? I think there’s an even more powerful Adele song that didn’t make this list but this HITS AS HARD AS IT CAN FUCK.

**1998tweety** (10): We love a power ballad.

**bandnitos** (10): PERIOD

**CritneySpearz** (10): iconic

**fadedblue09** (10): Even Adele’s weaker songs seem like gold when surrounded by garbage.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): that first hello is so iconic. Just that one word established dominance over the rest of the music world.

**palengard389** (10): The comeback of the century... Nothing beats the last 90 seconds

**runaway3212** (10): Adele said Hello and the whole world just died out of shock.

**skargardin** (10): We'll never see a comeback as strong as this ever again, her MIND

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): i feel like this song was so in your face that it annoyed a lot of people, and because of that, doesn't get the recognition that her singles from 21 get. but, in my opinion, it is a masterpiece from start to finish, and i need more of her sooner rather than later.

**vapourlomo** (10): Adele's best song, don't @ me

**bambamhenny** (9): The drop that shook the world also that one snl skit

**bulforster** (9): Maybe not her best song, but I would say her most iconic.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9): (#25) Goodbye!

**ManofOranges** (9): Very ethereal but it doesn't quite hit the mark of perfect for me. It just feels like there's something missing here, but I can't exactly tell what.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Now this is a power ballad.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): genuinely surprised this song isn’t higher on billboard’s list, this was MASSIVE during its release

**timothy444** (9): She has a powerful voice.

**waluigiest** (9): okay but when was the last time a single drop was this important

**Xanleth** (9): Another great Adele song.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.4): I remember not liking it at all at first…and then buying it off iTunes about 2 weeks later.

**bespectacIed** (8): Massive song that lowkey fell off the face of earth. But the global freak out this song induced will forever be etched on my mind

**nightjesus** (8): Kinda salty that when I sing ‘Hello...’ people thing I’m going in for the Adele but I’m actually singing Lionel Richie’s song. So they start to sing along and go ‘it’s me’. So PSA, if someone is going in for the ‘Hello...’ let them finish.

**themagicwemade** (8): maybe it's because we're in an adele drought but this song hits differently

**hikkaru** (7.5): it's fine but not nearly as good as most of her other singles

**rhyneston3** (7.5): Those pipes in the chorus!! Rest of the song is eh

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Standard Adele fare, nice and dramatic and polished instrumental, fantastic vocals, but pretty forgettable

**ReallyCreative** (7): easily one of my least favorite Adele singles, from a songwriting perspective, it's just lazy. If there's something that's going to hold Adele's legacy back, it's lazy lyrics, she just has the chops for most people to ignore it

**steelstepladder** (7): More like Hell yes

**vayyiqra** (7): My same comment as for "Someone Like You" which this is but not quite as good and more of a meme: *This is a great song, but it makes me so depressed. Not sad, depressed, which is a different thing. It makes me think about reaching adulthood and never finding love again, which is just so deeply depressing to me.*

**MrMoodle** (6.5): All I can think about when listening to this is “wow, it’s someone like you but worse in every way”. She gives a more intense vocal performance I guess? Still, pretty lame melody to work with regardless of her technical delivery of it. Just very underwhelming coming from Adele of all people.

**jackisboredtoday** (6): am i alone in thinking Adele’s lead singles are usually the weakest singles from her albums? this felt so meh to me compared to stuff like when we were young

**wavingwolves** (6): this is one of the adele's weakest songs tbh

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): iconic moment in pop culture but the song always annoyed me

**FKJVMMP** (2): God it’s sooo boooring. It could have been about anything and it still would have put me to sleep, but it’s just a shitty version of basically everything on 21 on top of being a total snore.

**kappyko** (1): god one of the most bland comebacks ever

**Roxieloxie** (1): im sorry, the song is good but this song is so deeply engrained in my hate for my 9th grade english teacher who literally was the devil, i cant listen to the whole thing anymore, the snl skit is funny though

**ExtraEater** (10): This is like the Right Round of this rate, except now Ke$ha’s credited and there’s a little less debate over how good it actually is. Apparently, this was originally set to have Rihanna as the feature, so there’s a tragic case of what could have been; she ditched this for Can’t Remember to Forget You with Shakira, which is good but not good enough to skip out on this banger.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Pitbull is an international treasure.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Old Town Road who? Also this chorus is FANTASTIC.

---

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): ah yes... finally.... the song of the decade....

**1998tweety** (10): Oh wow what a bop. Pitbull and Kesha both sound so damn good on this, the perfect collab.

**bambamhenny** (10): ke$ha and pop savior pitbool

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#8) Pitbull kinda snapped. Well, no, of course he didn't, Ke$ha earns this 10 all by herself, but he tried!

**gannade** (10): kesha made a single point in her career and this was it

**hikkaru** (10): THAT WAS A CLASSIC!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song still goes off all the time. One of the best dance songs of the 2010’s for sure

**ManofOranges** (10): Once again, I miss pitbull. Also I love this song.

**NotnotaMotmot** (10): bopbopbopbop

**ReallyCreative** (10): a rare moment where I think Pitbull adds something to the song, classic Kesha, a bop from start to finish and an iconic party anthem

**rhyneston3** (10): Wow now THAT was a banger hoo boy

**Roxieloxie** (10): Pitbul im begging please come back, i need new bops, you need to get another hit

**skargardin** (10): One of the best hooks of the tens methinks

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): i miss 2013

**timothy444** (10): Not to sound like an old fart or anything but I miss when Pitbull was a huge artist. He probably still is but not to the extent of other rappers like Post Malone and Future. Pitbull may have been too cheesy and corny but he turned it up to eleven and owned it. He was having fun with his songs and knew exactly how to lure someone in. This song is no exception and with Kesha's vocal hook + the killer instrumental, Timber has stood the test of time and it still bops to this day!

**vapourlomo** (10): DALE!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this song is really Kesha feat. Pitbull but the girlies aren’t ready for that conversation

**rickikardashian** (9.5): This very likely will be the last huge hit both Pitbull and Kesha have, and although I truly wish both of them are able to have another big moment, this might be the highest note to end your mainstream career

**rslashpoopheads** (9.5): Me when I go on the log flume ride in New France at Busch Gardens Williamsburgtm.

**starlightzone** (9.3): once again Pitbull doesn’t call himself Mister Worldwide at the start of the song and it’s a fucking bop. Coincidence? I THINK NOT.

**anothertown** (9): The harmonica hits different

**MrMoodle** (9): Early 2010s EDM pop trash perfection.

**themagicwemade** (9): i think this is the kesha song that got closest to recreating tik tok's energy

**yourfacesucksass** (8.2): The lasso that is my asshole was ready for this banger.

**Awkward\_King** (8): kesha invented the lumber business. invented district seven of panem

**bespectacIed** (8): Bop!!! King and queen of the rodeo

**vayyiqra** (8): Okay, we need to talk about what an incredibly bizarre song this is, and how improbable it is that it even exists. Pitbull and Kesha made an EDM banger with country influences, rap verses, and a fucking harmonica loop, and it became a huge hit. What the actual fuck? I'm so impressed they pulled it off and it turned out to be not just okay but a good song that I have to rate it highly.

**waluigiest** (8): *charli xcx voice* no boys no boys

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Kesha’s best and most listenable song before Rainbow

**wavingwolves** (7.3): i don't know what this song means

**bandnitos** (7): its going Down

**brodiepp** (7): this is the best song ever made. jk just copying what was in the post, anywho i stan kesha but not pit bull

**CritneySpearz** (7): ke$ha somehow makes Pitbull almost tolerable... almost

**FKJVMMP** (7): It’s good but Pitbull is no Lil Nas X.

**runaway3212** (7): Ke$ha is amazing as always, but the Pitbull lyrics make me cringe.

**steelstepladder** (7): More like it's going up I'm yelling good song

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.8): frat song

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Pretty catchy harmonica lead melody, Pitbull's rapping and Kesha's singing are just average, decently dancey but pretty trashy country-dance-fusion production

**jackisboredtoday** (6): if this were the Kesha solo version I’d add a point or two

**nightjesus** (5): Yo I have waaaaaaaaaaaay too many drunken memories to this song. They ain’t pretty.

**InternetDude19** (4): I can't stand it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): global warming been real quiet since this album dropped. hmm

**Xanleth** (2): Milo murphey’s Law has a better song with lumberjacks.

**ExtraEater** (10): I can’t remember exactly how I felt about this song at the time, but I definitely didn’t rush to turn it off whenever it came on (Same thing applied to Stupid Hoe, btw). It’s truly a tour de force in terms of catchiness, humor, unabashed self-expression, etc. That a song this joyous and *fun* was ever associated with the word “controversy” is a complete tragedy. That glorious outro where Nicki sounds like she’s losing her mind almost seems like it should ruin this song, but nah. If you skip that part of the song, have you really even heard the song?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I think about the shower thought that said “Nicki saying ‘I got a big fat ass’ at the end of Anaconda was a TL;DR of the song” a lot.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song is excellent. I will hear no words otherwise.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**anothertown** (10): She smacked me off the face of the earth with this song. I would hope that we are looking more kindly upon it than we did upon its release because it’s perfect

**bandnitos** (10): gay rights!

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic verses. Every line in this song is gold and deserves a grammy. I couldn't fathom how anyone could not stan or at least appreciate Onika when she drops mind-blowing lines like "Pussy put his ass to sleep, now he callin me Nyquil"

**brodiepp** (10): once again deserved a number one nicki, also my pink print CD has anaconda as only the karaoke version and idk why the fuck it’s so annoying and depressing bc this is such a bop

**bulforster** (10): Iconic. I'd give it my 11 if I could.

**Jexan13** (10): The song is everything. The damn video is damn iconic. HELL, that devil laugh at the end is ICONICT

**ManofOranges** (10): There is not a single thing wrong with this song. Nicki knew what she was doing. The fact that this wasn't on the decade end list is a damn shame.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what's not to love about this song

**Roxieloxie** (10): whats good miley

**runaway3212** (10): Nicki is so confident I absolutely love it.

**skargardin** (10): Look at the perfection

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): bro why does no one talk about how funny the last minute of this song is it legitimately cracks me up everytime

**waluigiest** (10): each time I listened to this song after 2014 my love for it grew immensely

**wavingwolves** (10): i wrote a paper about this song once so i may be biased but i literally think the whole thing is so clever. it's peak nicki and i love it!!!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): im convinced people who hate this song just hate fun

**rickikardashian** (9.5): This deserved a better chorus to make it a perfect song, because some of the lyrics are straight up poetry. "Pussy put his ass to sleep now he's calling me NtQuil

**camerinian** (9): the most chaotic hit of the decade, and I'm so glad it exists and fucked everything up with it

**ReallyCreative** (9): a really fun remix! possibly my favorite Nicki song

**yourfacesucksass** (8.2): I luvvvv dis fatassss

**ignitethephoenix** (8): iconic but not a personal favourite

**starlightzone** (8): Okay it’s fine. That’s it. It’s fine. I don’t think it’s that great and she definitely has better songs.

**vapourlomo** (8): Brilliant sampling

**Xanleth** (8): MY ANACONDA DON’T WANT NONE UNLESS YOU GOT BUNS HUN!

**steelstepladder** (7): Not my favorite Nicki song but it still goes off

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.5): This would be #57 in the list.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Pretty head-scratchingly cheesy production and lyrics, Nicki's rapping carries and it's pretty catchy but even the song overstays its welcome with the outro

**FKJVMMP** (5): Everything about this is either perfect or horrifying, works out to a solid average.

**fadedblue09** (4): Not even a good Nicki song was picked. Only BARELY better than her Roman Reloaded stuff.

**vayyiqra** (3): Yeah no. We have to support body positivity, and Sir Mix-A-Lot made a lot of cogent points about how underappreciated curvy women are (especially in the 90s unlike today) and we owe him for that, but this song is a mess. The lyrics are kind of bizarre (she seriously compares her vagina to cough syrup) and there is a part near the end where Nicki literally *cackles* about her fat ass. It's too much. The video, as with everything involving Drake, made for a decent meme but that's it. The song is trash, and Nicki has so much better, including other songs about her super/b/ass.

**ExtraEater** (10): With a generally dark atmosphere and direct references to the horror movie “The Hills Have Eyes”, it’s one of the odder #1 hits this decade. The closing lullaby being sung in The Weeknd’s first language (Amharic) is pretty cool.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I think it’s safe to say that The Weeknd is the best new (in the mainstream, don’t @ me) male pop star of the latter half of the decade. So many hits under his belt, and almost all of them are amazing. The Hills is a modern classic.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (3): I don’t know what anyone sees in this song but I just cannot stand it.

---

**Entire-Reflection** (11): this song is amazing

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Iconic. I don’t know what else to say as I’ve rated this a bunch and it’s one of my favourite songs.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): This song DEFINED my taste in music for like 2 whole years, and it’s still one of the sturdiest, best and most unique hit songs of the decade. I love it so much

**steelstepladder** (11): More like the chills I get when I hear this because I love it so much

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): career-defining.

**bandnitos** (10): I ONLY CALL YOU WHEN ITS HALF PAST i don't understand the rest

**bloupp** (10): My second pick for an 11, one of the best choruses I've ever heard

**camerinian** (10): It takes a giga Chad of an artist to make a song this bleak and horrific into a #1 and also fucking incredible and uncompromising at the same time. The Weeknd is a giga Chad

**hikkaru** (10): i will always prefer pure pop abel bc i'm a basic bitch but this is a slapper too

**Jexan13** (10): thank u Ariana for being an inspiration to this song

**rhyneston3** (10): If this song was a person I would want to fuck it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): If I had another 11 Id give it to this

**timothy444** (10): Gave me goosebumps

**waluigiest** (10): ultra bop. The duo of thing song and Can’t Feel My Face were revolutionary and I still love them

**1998tweety** (9.5): This is nice, it feels like background music but it's very good background music.

**starlightzone** (9.3): I love The Weeknd, and this is probably my favorite song by him. He’s so good and it’s such a chill beat with harsh lyrics. It feels like a fuck ‘em up song.

**bespectacIed** (9): The better number 1 song from BBTM.

**FKJVMMP** (9): Can’t wait for a Weeknd/Billie Eilish collab when she’s old enough that it’s not unbelievably creepy.

**ReallyCreative** (9): a little abrasive but iconic

**runaway3212** (9): The Weeknd being the best dude in pop music yet again.

**Tolk1en** (9): The Weeknd is incredibly talented, this song is one of the proof.

**vapourlomo** (9): How did something this gonzo top the charts?!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.9): (#27) The hills do have eyes. :eye:

**FrankBedbroken** (8): i feel so much like a douchebag for liking this and mixtape-era abel but god damn it this just sounds good

**Roxieloxie** (8): i thought this was in the night and im kinda mad now, but anyway i remember playing this song in marching band

**wavingwolves** (7.5): moody bitches love it

**nightjesus** (7): I do really like how the chorus be like that. That bridge be real nice too.

**survivorthrowaway5** (7): listen to this with the bass up

**themagicwemade** (7): it's so hard to imagine abel as some pussy slaying god when his hair looks like that

**vayyiqra** (7): This is an okay song (though it creeps me out a bit)  but, oh, how I wish we were rating a classic like "Starboy" instead of it. At least "Can't Feel My Face" is also in this rate.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Not a big fan of the dark instrumental nor Abel's distorted vocals, but kind of a bop?

**Xanleth** (6): Good enough.

**fadedblue09** (5.3): Meh. One of those songs that became a hit because its artist was on a roll when it was released.

**skargardin** (5): This never really connected with me. The verses are just such a drag.

**palengard389** (4): Yeah this is pretty mediocre

**rslashpoopheads** (1): yuck

**ManofOranges** (0): I hate this song so much. It just sounds like it's trying so hard to be something that it is most definitely not and the productions makes me wanna bang my head against a wall. I do not see a single redeeming thing trapped within this disaster of a song.

**selegend** (0): i fucking hate this song

**ExtraEater** (10): Just as great as the Fastball song btw

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is honestly one of Ariana’s top 3 songs. The sample is used beautifully, her and Mac balance each other perfectly, it’s so cute and I can’t help but get a smile on my face when it starts to play.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): God this song is so good.

---

**anothertown** (10): THE WAY YOU LOVE ME!

**bespectacIed** (10): HER BEST COLLABORATION. One of Ariana's best songs, it's probably on my top 5. This is fun, slightly innocent, slick, fantastic. Yours Truly for me is tied with Dangerous Woman as Ari's 2nd best albums.

**brodiepp** (10): simply beauty, timeless

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Mac and Ariana are so cute together ugh I love this and miss it

**InternetDude19** (10): I never listed to Mac Miller, but he did give me this, and for that I am eternally grateful.

**kappyko** (10): :(

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is perfect.

**Roxieloxie** (10): i dont listen to this one alot anymore but its still really good

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I GOT A BAD BOY I MUST ADMIT IT

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.5): This would be #17 in the list.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): This song was amazing to begin with, but with all that's happened since it makes this song feel so much more special.. like a moment in time captured

**bandnitos** (9): i loOOOVE the YWYa

**starlightzone** (9): I think Mac and Ariana vibe REAL nice. And her voice just is so nice here.

**waluigiest** (9): I forgot how much I liked her sound on her first album! This is excellent

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bops a bit

**camerinian** (8.5): gah I just want to give this song a big hug

**skargardin** (8): Bop

**steelstepladder** (8): Well this makes me sad

**Tolk1en** (8): I'm not fond of Ariana first albums, but looking back this song makes me feel nostalgic

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Instrumental sounds too minimal for its own good but overall not bad, Ariana's singing main highlight, Mac's feature is bad though

**bambamhenny** (7): honestly boring

**Jexan13** (7): truly an unfortunate song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): a very generic first single

**vayyiqra** (5.5): Okay this song is alright but why is it here, when Ariana had so many better songs last decade?

**fadedblue09** (5): I prefer Right There, sorry

**FKJVMMP** (5): It’s fine, but it’s not exactly peak Ariana. Mac Miller should have done more pop guest verses though.

**Xanleth** (5): It’s fine.

**gannade** (1): the way this song sucks

**ExtraEater** (10): This is nice, but it really hasn’t held up that well over time. Back then, it was a pretty massive song that nailed my image of summer. Now it’s a mildly catchy tune that just makes me want to listen to the Beach Boys song. Snoop Dogg’s verse is still pretty good, though.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A west coast anthem! This is such a nostalgia trip for me and takes me back to better days. It’s the picture of the “early 2010s pop” that people always try to praise any new pop songs for sounding anything close to.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Man, Teenage Dream was a damn good era.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): (Another Luke track that slaps... sigh) Excellent Snoop feature, a little cheesy but overall fresh, summery, dancey

**bandnitos** (10): CLASSIC

**bespectacIed** (10): Fuck this song's producer. Iconic song, the song of the summer forever. Snoop's rap bridge is iconic and will never not make laugh of how corny hilarious it is.

**ggal2020** (10): So hard to decide whether to give this or TikTok the eleven

**hikkaru** (10): kinda salty that the teenage dream title track isn't here but this is still a 10

**ReallyCreative** (10): legendary

**rickikardashian** (10): the entire teenage dream era was an amazing moment in history and I'm so glad I was alive while it happened

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Y'all bitches robbed this in the Song of the Summer rate.

**runaway3212** (10): Snoop Dogg just adds a lot to this song.

**skargardin** (10): Teenage Dreams' singles are really just tens

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): The best guest rap verse of any pop song ever

**timothy444** (10): Classic

**vayyiqra** (10): "Bop" doesn't begin to describe this song. This is pop perfection. It's silly and cheesy, and the video is absurd (Katy is naked for most of it and also shoots whipped cream out of her bra, both for no reason), and it uses a heavily autotuned millennial whoop as part of the hook. On paper this song should be utter trash, yet it's so infectious and fun that it works.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Mega bop. It's a fun catchy song and Snoop's contributions work really well with the song.

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): I both hate and love this song, I don’t understand it...

**anothertown** (9): TD’s best single :-)

**nightjesus** (9): Fun fact thought the lyrics where ‘Fine fresh beers’. Anywho a banger of a song. Also love a good Snoop D O double G verse.

**untutorable** (9): snoop dogg ate this

**waluigiest** (9): I really loved this song little gay 13 year old me learned how to play it on saxophone I was unstoppable

**survivorthrowaway5** (8.7): classic, always slaps - thanks max and luke

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Tik Tok, except it’s actually good.

**starlightzone** (8.5): The song lyrics are just basic but they’re fun. It’s like the best kind of basic. It’s cheerful and easy to listen to. I’m not gonna complain about bops like these.

**PointlessBibliophage** (8.3): that millenial whoop kinda sounds grating now tbh

**yourfacesucksass** (8.1): The lead single she needed. I really thought that One of the Boys was going to be the one and done album. I’m glad her Teenage Dream era was THE era for her.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (8): I remember how everyone was fascinated by the fact I knew every single word to this song back in 4th grade. Guess that’s how the gay rumors began.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): still think this Katy Perry song is slightly overrated

**vapourlomo** (8): Not TGIF, but it'll do in a pinch

**InternetDude19** (7.5): I believe that this is what the kids call a vibe.

**bambamhenny** (7): \*elmo voice\* NEW YORK BAABYY \*hits that whip\* BOIIII

**kappyko** (7): orgonon gurls was a moment

**wavingwolves** (7): katy came to brazil with her california dreams tour and a tv show host gave her a brigadeiro (a traditional brazilian chocolate truffle) and she turned it down saying she actually didn't like sweets even though it was her whole aesthetic at the time and i always think of this when i hear this song

**Xanleth** (7): It’s good.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.3): (#57) gorl

**ManofOranges** (6): While I love a lot of the songs that came out of the Teenage Dream era, this is not one of them, and if I'm being quite honest I don't understand how everyone else likes this song. Snoop's verse I think is just really bad and the song itself doesn't have the appeal that the other songs from Katy during this time have. It's painfully average at best.

**steelstepladder** (6): I know a lot of people genuinely love this song and a lot of people think of this as THE Katy Perry song but it's no where near as good as Teenage Dream or Never Really Over or even Hot and Cold

**jackisboredtoday** (5.7): this list has the wrong teenage dream singles

**Roxieloxie** (5): part of me outsold

**Tolk1en** (5): The music video traumatized me, and even though the song is good and I would have given 9 if it was released today, I can't give more than this because of the trauma.

**Jexan13** (3.5): i always felt this was the pinnacle of blandness. Maybe it was the offputting Dr. Puke production (i didn't like it even before knowing the trash he is), or that the song is just too cookie cutter, but i never liked it.

**ExtraEater** (10): We’re in that alternate universe where this somehow became a major hit. We should feel honored

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One of the most instantly recognizable songs of the 2010’s! Gotye and Kimbra confused the fuck out of everyone in April 2012, and then proceeded to get them all bopping for the rest of the year and decade. I remember when this was my mom’s favorite song, so much so that she took us to Target with the goal of getting his album and being disappointed when they didn’t have it.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Now he’s someone that we used to know...

---

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): Gotye got it right, make one hit song and then be an organic farmer for the rest of the decade

**vayyiqra** (11): It might be surprising, but I didn't like this song the first time I heard it. I'm not giving it my 11 because Kimbra is in it (though she did kill her verse) but because this is the song in this rate that makes me feel the strongest emotions. Being a millennial, the 2010s were a hard time, and that meant I either destroyed a lot of relationships, both romantic and platonic, or else they destroyed them instead of me. I regret a lot of things about the last decade, and this song is cathartic because it reminds me that there are always two sides to every story and it's not always one person's fault when things don't work out.

**Xanleth** (11): Perfect pop song of melancholy and misery.

**1998tweety** (10): Masterpiece, we love an indie hit.

**bespectacIed** (10): A really amazing song. Deserved its success. But Gotye was right, we didn't have to cut him off :(

**camerinian** (10): OK this song is still really great but I saw Kimbra drag herself through her verse at her live show like a year ago and it was really fucking sad so in a way I kinda wish this didn’t exist

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#15) BUT YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO CUUUUUUUUUUUUUUT ME OFF

**Entire-Reflection** (10): inb4 half of the comments are people saying “Gotye is someone we used to know”

**fadedblue09** (10): One of the most left field-sounding hits of the 2010’s and it really takes you back to a specific time without sounding dated or obnoxious. An 11 contender for sure.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I taught myself how to play the marimba riff back when I did percussion in high school because that’s how iconic this song is.

**Jexan13** (10): In a perfect world this song spawned a pop queen with a similar sonical aesthetic with at least 4 #1 hits.

**ManofOranges** (10): It will never not be shocking to me that a song like this by an artist like Gotye was so successful. The sheer success of this song really proves to me that success is equal parts up to chance and up to talent, and this song had the perfect storm of both.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): Gotye and Kimbra deserved more success after this

**rickikardashian** (10): I wasn't aware this was this big like, bigger than Call Me Maybe, Rolling In The Deep and Despacito? No wonder Gotye didn't have another hit, he didn't need to. His grandkids will have their tuitions paid with the royalties from this song

**rosesmp3** (10): i love drama what can i say

**runaway3212** (10): A song that has mastered simplicity

**steelstepladder** (10): More like somebody that I used to go out of my way to listen to

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): #bullygotyeintomakingmusicagain2020

**timothy444** (10): I disliked this at first but after these years, it's considered a classic Australian song for me. The usage of the xylophone throughout its entirety is just creative and it definitely shows off how indie music isn't as boring as people might think.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): one of the two real 11 contenders. i've been following the hot 100 since i was in elementary school, and this was the first song that really amazed me with how it became a hit against all odds. i stanned hard back then and it holds up just as way to this day...truly timeless

**waluigiest** (10): What a masterpiece! The sound building here (and honestly on his entire album) is otherworldly; he sticks these retro sounds with hypermodern ideas. This is a beautiful composition, and an emotional, balanced breakup song.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): kimbra ate

**yourfacesucksass** (9.3): I’ll give it this score for the Mike Dawes radio mix, the superior version

**bambamhenny** (9): the glee version outsold

**FKJVMMP** (9): It’s ridiculous how well-written this is. This is the kind of song every songwriter should aspire to make. Lost a point for Kimbra sounding way too much like Katy Perry though.

**FrankBedbroken** (9): need to listen to making mirrors at some point, probably one of the songs that have held up the most here

**nightjesus** (9): My coworker and I literally serenaded this song to each other the other day. It was actually great.

**ReallyCreative** (9): STORY TIME: I lived in a super Christian (though not necessarily conservative Christian so it wasn't awful for a gay boy like me) area and so all my friends were super involved in their church. I went to their big retreat/event for youth spring of my Senior year in high school. It was mostly harmless (they were Methodists so everyone was only so invested) while most events happened at the church, groups of kids would spend the night at another kid's house. It was me and like 6 other guys (all of us in chorus) including my straight crush and I remember one night we decided to learn how to sing this song acapella. Guess who immediately got typecast to get Kimbra's verse? I killed it tho

**skargardin** (9): A genuinely great one hit wonder, Gotye deserved so much better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): gotye come back to us pls

**themagicwemade** (9): i like to fantasize about the toxic, non-existent ex i'm still in love with but ultimately broke up with to this song

**vapourlomo** (9): I feel like this song fell off the face of the planet. Bummer — it's a great ballad with heart-wrenching lyrics and performances.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): This song is SO GOOD after some time away

**starlightzone** (8.5): spoilers this is like my 3rd time listening to this song at all because I kept avoiding it because I didn’t want it to get too overplayed or hyped for me. It’s really good, though. It’s got this nice chill feeling and Gotye has this really powerful voice that he has such smooth control over.

**InternetDude19** (8.2): In hindsight, this was a very strange hit.

**hikkaru** (8): america was tired of the edm bangers from 2012 so they dug up this indie pop song from the depths of australia, kinda iconic

**palengard389** (8): Good except I wish I could hear them when they sing the verses

**rhyneston3** (8): Great song, but the vocal mixing sounds a little weird? Like it seems in the verses the vocals should be louder than they are

**static\_int\_husp** (8): I think this is one of the only hits associated with two one hit wonders (who both have wonderful other music, btw!)

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.1): hooky

**rslashpoopheads** (7): How the fuck did a song like this have so much mainstream success

**Tolk1en** (7): I feel like this song didn't age so well. I used to like it a lot.

**Roxieloxie** (6): i was at a gay dance party and all i remember is the dj used the absolute worst drop possible of this song

**bandnitos** (5): zzz

**starla\_** (5): so overplayed that i reflexively cringe at it even tho gotye and kimbra are god tier antipodeans and it’s actually a pretty good song

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): I hate how low-key the verses are, the lyrics are mostly fine and the chorus is great but jars with the verses and honestly way too minimalist production

**gannade** (3): fad

**wavingwolves** (3): in hindsight it's so weird this song was as big as it was. it's not even good

**alwayswords** (2): somebody that i used 2 know (but seriously the chorus gives me a headache)

vayyiqra: > camerinian (10): OK this song is still really great but I saw Kimbra drag herself through her verse at her live show like a year ago and it was really fucking sad so in a way I kinda wish this didn’t exist

/u/camerinian I had the opposite reaction to that when I saw her. I thought it was hilarious and she was doing it ironically.

**ExtraEater** (10): It’s funny how the #1 song of the decade is perhaps the most blatantly inspired by a whole other decade. Literally any other song in the Decade-End Top 5 is both in 2010s culture and representative of it at the same time. Anyway, this is great and I never could’ve guessed that the same guy who made Just the Way You Are and The Lazy Song could do this.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The fact this is the biggest song of the decade and overplay still hasn’t killed this for me (even though it definitely has for some of you) is astounding. Dragons everywhere found in the unemployment line.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): The best #1 of the decade. This song is a juggernaut in all aspects, and it more than deserves to be the biggest hit of the 2010s.

---

**poppinmmolly** (11): this...defined the decade. Overplayed? yes, but don't forget that for the first few months everyone was bopping to this. Over the course of the last decade, we have seen a throwback in sounds to the 70s and 80s and this definitely brings us back to that funk sound!

**1998tweety** (10): Love this vibe, really surprised this is the biggest hit but it's also super deserved

**alwayswords** (10): :trumpet:

**bulforster** (10): Given the amount of trash and mediocrity in this rate, it's a minor miracle the Hot 100's biggest song of the decade is so good. Lorde stans better not sabotage this.

**camerinian** (10): The top song of the decade is an actual brilliantly produced jam that everyone loves and recognises as a high quality piece of music, now that's some wizardry by the GP

**CreepyMannequin** (10): Mark Ronson really did THAT huh

**FKJVMMP** (10): It’s a perfect song. Only reason it didn’t get an 11 is because it’s so obviously perfect that there’s nothing interesting to say about it.

**gannade** (10): yes this did that

**hikkaru** (10): i always say that this is like. the ONE song that is completely tainted by overplay for me (it usually doesn't bother me with other huge hits that were everywhere) but then when i listen to it again i have no choice but to stan

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): The image of a retired dragon is so delightful. Like, it’s over its village burning days and now just knits and goes on peaceful cruises and vacations.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The whitest funk song but idc, a bop is a bop

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): Pure fun, one of Bruno’s best songs

**Popfan2489** (10): this sounds like the song that future generations will listen to and be nostalgic for

**skargardin** (10): decade-defining and that's on periodt

**steelstepladder** (10): The most overplayed song of the decade should sound a lot worse than it does

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): This isn’t my favorite song on the list, but there’s no other song that deserves to be #1 of the decade more than this. It’s a timeless party anthem thats nearly impossible to hate. What more could you ask for?

**timothy444** (10): I love the funkiness in this and clearly everyone else did! Definitely deserved being the song of the decade.

**vapourlomo** (10): Is it overplayed? Yes, of course. Is it still a stone-cold, untouchable classic? Yes, of course.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.7): (#17) I believe it fully deserves the title of biggest song of the 2010s. It was HUGE.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Timeless production, #1 on the Billboard for a reason, phenomenal vocal performance from Bruno, truly funky and cross-generational

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I'm so glad THIS was the song to top the chart considering every other song in the top 5

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): An incredibly fun anthem that might be a little heavy on the nostalgia, but you cannot deny this is where Bruno shines.

**starlightzone** (9.5): This is what the decade is about. Uptown Funk is exactly what we, in this climate, deserve. Something just party and chill that doesn’t take itself too seriously.

**fadedblue09** (9): Honestly, I wouldn’t mind this winning.

**Roxieloxie** (9): I cant even pretend like i wasnt all over this when this came out. this is gonna get robbed though cause this sub 1. hates men and 2. is still mad over melodrama loosing

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Infectiously fun but gets old fast due to the huge amount of repetition.

**runaway3212** (9): This song just vibes so weel

**slimboyfriend** (9): On one hand it sounds like a throwaway song ghostwritten by Prince, but on the other hand that's why it's so good

**themagicwemade** (9): im both surprised and not surprised that this is the biggest song of the decade

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): freshman year of college vibes. super energetic and infectious. nice to see mr. mars add this to his list of honors. a 2020 album would be nice.

**waluigiest** (9): pure joy. This song is infectious and fresh and honestly it totally deserves its song of the decade status.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): this is kind of the best of what pop music has to offer: extravagant beats that reach your brain and turn themselves into serotonin and make you want to dance like a fool

**bambamhenny** (8): loved going off to this on Just Dance, and Bruno's one of the rare valid male pop artists

**bespectacIed** (8): Deserved its number 1 spot

**rhyneston3** (8): Overplay killed this one a little for me, but still a banger

**ulikejazz** (8): how is this so good but so mediocre?

**Xanleth** (8): Pretty catchy Jam

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): I mean hate men all you want, sure it’s overplayed but it’s also just a fucking good song

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): all gold everything lowkey better

**InternetDude19** (7.2): Overplayed but still quotable.

**FrankBedbroken** (7): neo-funk pastiches have been done to death by now but this still kinda holds up

**nightjesus** (7): I’m gonna give this a seven. DON’T BELIEVE ME JUST WATCH.

**vayyiqra** (7): I like this song but never loved it. The chorus used to annoy me because I couldn't understand what the hell he was saying - I thought "What is he saying, 'don't believe me just right?' What the fuck does that mean?". It's grown on me a bit though, and Mark Ronson is a great producer, but Daft Punk did retro better last decade.

**worlds-okayest666** (7): if we did this rate a few years ago my score would be much higher, but this is probably the worst case of “ruined by overplay” for me

**yourfacesucksass** (7): just no

**ggal2020** (6.8): Mark Ronson is hot

**palengard389** (5): So so so mediocre and undeserving of the top spot

**PointlessBibliophage** (4.5): meh honestly

**kappyko** (4): i mean what does it mean that the #1 song of the decade is just revivalist funk shit

**ManofOranges** (4): I'm sorry I've just gotten really sick of this song over time.

**survivorthrowaway5** (4): only sounded great in super bowl

**Tolk1en** (4): the instrumentation is horrible. And Bruno Mars' voice is hard to handle

**bandnitos** (3): im going to be honest i cannot fucking stand this song

**anothertown** (2): i feel nothing but dread when i listen to this. It sounds like the Cha Cha Slide.

**ExtraEater** (10): Did you guys know that the YouTube URL for this song’s MV has “YEET” in it? Behold: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tg00YEETFzg

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): A Classic! EDM would very well not be a thing if it weren’t for this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): I wrote a comment a couple weeks ago about how I feel like this song doesn’t get the recognition it deserves for kinda being the first EDM pop song with a full on drop to become big, and this song was a lot bigger than most people would probably expect! It’s iconic.

---

**nightjesus** (11): Forever one of the best songs in history. Forever the best Calvin Harris and Rhianna song. The hard hitting bass, synth, drums, and every thing just goes OFF and Rhianna sings the song so well. It’s so hard to listen to this song when I’m walking cause I just wanna go crazy when it drops.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Everything about this song is so great. The fact that it still feels like it could get popular today speaks for it's quality

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Single-handedly put electropop on the map, pulls off repetitive lyrics exceptionally well, addictive, infectious, Rihanna's - and Calvin's - best work to date

**bambamhenny** (10): God yes, and the MV, the best calvin harris collab

**bandnitos** (10): modern classic

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic. No other word for it. Blah blah blah DAE remember when makeup artist Rihanna used to be singer

**bloupp** (10): Forever has a place in my memories

**hikkaru** (10): invented edm. we love 18 months era calvin harris he made nothing but classics

**ignitethephoenix** (10): mainstream EDM peaked here, and what a wonderful peak is was

**jackisboredtoday** (10): a flawless anthem that defines a whole movement in pop music for all eternity

**ManofOranges** (10): This is, in my opinion, one of Calvin Harris' best songs, if not his very best. Everything about this song just has takes me there.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): BOP!!!

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): with a chef's kiss

**rhyneston3** (10): I fucking love Rihanna

**Roxieloxie** (10): if i give this a ten can we stop rating it

**skargardin** (10): THE best EDM producer / pop girl collab ever

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): iconic, legendary, game changing, never done before, etc.

**waluigiest** (10): okay finally something tasty

**wavingwolves** (10): this is what i call REAL MUSIC

**megm26** (9.9): i usually don’t like edm kinda stuff but this, this is iconic

**1998tweety** (9.5): A very good song. I do think it gets just a little overhyped but it's still extremely good.

**Jexan13** (9.5): the EDM drop always turned me off from this song. Like, I felt everything was perfect but that ruined it so bad.

**starla\_** (9.5): so iconic

**Awhile2** (9): invented edm wbk

**hunnybee12** (9): a true cultural landmark

**ReallyCreative** (9): The build up is probably the only medicore part of this song, feeling extremely derivative, but the drop makes up for it for sure. Rihanna is doing her thing and we're living

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9): let’s hope rihanna doesn’t get slandered in a rate once again

**starlightzone** (8.9): The only reason this isn’t a 9 is because I hate the beat that isn’t the Chorus. It just feels like a heart rate meter. But so much of this bangs.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.5): (#32) doot doot do do do do doot doot

**camerinian** (8): I really can't listen to this song on my own anymore but it still goes the fuck off as a party track

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Invented EDM.

**Tolk1en** (8): a grower, a bop. I find the vocals a bit boring, but the production is great.

**anothertown** (7): :roller coaster tycoon:

**FrankBedbroken** (7): guilty pleasure i guess but i have a soft spot for early 2010s electro house

**palengard389** (7): I guess this is alright but it’s not the most interesting

**runaway3212** (7): Solid song, but I never really understood the hype around it.

**timothy444** (7): We Found Love is an amazing pop dance single but it's also overrated and far from the best of what Calvin has also produced. The lyrics are repetitive, which isn't a bad thing if the instrumental make up the slack for it. Unfortunately, the instrumental portion of the track consists of generic, bland and honestly somewhat lame beats. The backing track sounds like it's stuck in the year 2011 which is unfortunate because there are singles from the same album that were released earlier that sound more futuristic. The song still bops but what the track boils down to is just loops and one girl singing the same thing over and over.

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.9): dumb; gay

**InternetDude19** (6): I don't quite get the appeal.

**steelstepladder** (6): More like We Found Love somewhere else other than this song

**vapourlomo** (6): It's obviously a well-written song, but a bit repetitive for me. Rihanna and Calvin both have better songs

**vayyiqra** (5): I want to like this song more because of its impactful video, but it's just so repetitive and isn't that great as a song outside of that context. If we were rating this song along with the video I'd rate it higher for sure. Both of these artists are talented and can do a lot better.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): I stan the real Rihanna, not this whitewashed EDM shit.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): not to sound like a Music Boomer but i really hate choruses/hooks that just repeat one phrase over and over again

**kappyko** (2): okay to elaborate this is the worse of the two calvin harrihanna songs. it doesn't make me feel, the drop is poor, it's not really badass or cool, the line in the hook sux

**Xanleth** (2): Not a fan of this one at all.

**ExtraEater** (10): Crack

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I remember when me and a friend were talking to another friend and she was making the playlist for a party in the drama club that she was in. She showed some songs that were definitely in and some that were up in the air, and one of them was Can’t Feel My Face. Me and my friend said that she should add it on the playlist but she said “it’s about cocaine addiction,” and I said that I knew and that made it even cooler cause it gave it a darker tone while still being a fun pop song. She then said “People in my family have died from cocaine overdoses,” and boy did my ass shut the fuck up!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Day 1,704 of my Mom bopping to this song : She still doesnt know its about cocaine

**timothy444** (10): Gotta say, this song is a bop and I'm amazed at how well this charted. It's energetic with some R&B influences and it's catchy as hell!

**waluigiest** (10): when I think of the most fun party that could organically exist they’re playing this song

**InternetDude19** (9.7): I may be grading this on a bell curve against the rest of this list, but this is a really good song.

**Awkward\_King** (9): omg all these songs just make me think of youtube rewind fuck lmao

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): michael jackson who? (i'm joking).

**vapourlomo** (9): The best Michael song since 1987

**vayyiqra** (9): It's not quite as good as "Starboy" but still, what a good electro song. Don't do cocaine, kids. Or if you do, be careful.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.5): (#34) Cocaine, kids. Don't do it!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A song that changed the course of pop music and did more for pop music than Lana ever could.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): The song that killed pop music. Lorde deserves so much better.

**ExtraEater** (9): Far from her best, but I’m not losing any sleep over it being this high

---

**FKJVMMP** (11): It totally changed pop music, and for the better. Definitely the most ‘important’ song on the list, and it sounds like it. I already loved Joel Little because of Goodnight Nurse but he was just about my favourite human being after Pure Heroine dropped.

**FrankBedbroken** (11): as if there was any other option

**GarlicEnthusiast** (11): yes

**InternetDude19** (11): Royals still sounds fresh 7 years later, and it stands head and shoulders above its' countless imitators. A true game-changer.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Significant shift in pop music from extravagant to low-key, darker, more minimal production which is a home-run, lyrics are perfectly relatable yet decidedly sick of luxury

**Awkward\_King** (10): lorde dog dead let em talk (but honestly even if it’s not my favourite lorde song by any means it’s still such a ten)

**bandnitos** (10): a banger of a nokia ringtone or whatever she called it

**bespectacIed** (10): This song, \*cockslayer voice\* i love it, it gives me that buzz ... \*lorde voice\* *a different kind of buzz*. Iconic, amazing, introduced me to what would become one of my favorite artists ever, but this sub overstates this song impact. Lorde wasn't the first moody white girl who made a downtempo song, r/popheads SIMMER THE FUCK DOWN. Also, it's kinda cringe listening to it knowing Lorde came from a well-off family, good education, label backing, and most importantly she's rich now, so she did became a Royal.

**camerinian** (10): this song fully ruined the New Zealand music scene for a few years but still it's good, anyway long ass post about it coming soon stream BENEE

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#13) The most influential song of the 2010s.

**CritneySpearz** (10): we love a 16 year old setting the pop music trend for years to come, just kween tingz

**fadedblue09** (10): I really do not wanna be associated with the Lorde circlejerk, but damn this song is just THAT good.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Changed pop as we know it.

**ManofOranges** (10): I still remember hearing this song for the first time. My dad was taking me to school and the radio was on and then this song came on and instantly my ears were listening. I made a mental note not to forget the lyrics so I could look the song and later and lo and behold I did and then I never looked back. It seems to me that whenever I hear a song and public and then search for it later, it's always a hit. Anyways, thank you Lorde.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): I mean it did change music

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): changed pop music forever

**Popfan2489** (10): great song

**ReallyCreative** (10): the song that launched a thousand minimally produced ships, most of which are bad but the original is very much perfect!

**rickikardashian** (10): This might not be the best Lorde song at all, but I'm so glad she has this huge hit to her name, because if it wasn't for it, I would never have learned about the excellence that Lorde is, and I don't want to live in a world like that

**rosesmp3** (10): a cultural moment

**skargardin** (10): Another decade-defining song but wbk

**starla\_** (10): one of my most played songs of all time

**steelstepladder** (10): I guess Lorde never looked in the mirror because she is a diamond in the flesh

**timothy444** (10): Sidenote: Lol I forgot I gave this a 10 in the Lorde v Marina v Lana rate, heck I forgot I even participated in that rate in the first place. Still deserves a 10 tho, issa bop.

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't even want to write a comment for this song. It's great. That's it, that's the tweet.

**waluigiest** (10): Lorde and I are the same age. This song came out in the middle of high school for me and it was revolutionary. Maybe it just spoke to my dramatic, alternative-but-ultimately-suburban soul, but this was one of the first songs that resonated deeply for me

**wavingwolves** (10): this song makes me want to cry now that i'm older because it sounds so genuine and naive. it's really like nothing else in this list, which just proves how important it was for mainstream music afterwards

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Invented the 2010s.

**starlightzone** (9): when will your faves ever? When they’re lily allen. But when they’re lorde they’re still top tier.

**bulforster** (8.8): Respect the hell out of it, don't love it

**1998tweety** (8.5): Def one of her weaker songs but it's still nice. There are some good lyrics here but I don't really care for it over her other tracks.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Lorde has better songs (this is still good) so compared to that and also other songs in this rate it’s not a standout.

**Jexan13** (8.5): it's kinda interesting, lyrically and sonically, but after listening to Pure Heroine... yeah, it's not that good as I initially thought

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): honestly, not one of lorde's best songs imo, the lyrics are top tier sure, but the instrumental feels a little lacking compared to other stuff on Pure Heroine

**MrMoodle** (8.3): This song is really good but it also ruined pop music and I will never forgive it.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.3): I’m not caught up in this love affair

**alwayswords** (8): this song just doesnt compare to the other ones on pure heroine

**anothertown** (8): the only lorde song i like. i was 20 when this came out so that’s probably why

**hikkaru** (8): one of her less good songs and i'm not just saying that to be a hipster, it's kinda uninteresting compared to the rest of pure heroine and melodrama. still decent tho

**themagicwemade** (8): blah blah it revolutionized pop music and all but. it's also a good song

**Tolk1en** (8): tbh I didn't find anything interesting with Lorde at her peak. Later, especially after joining popheads, I discovered her work and Royals grew in me.

**vapourlomo** (8): This song has the Pearl Jam effect, unfortunately — it's great, but it inspired a lot of awful music. Stream Melodrama.

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.7): signature song, classic, definitive; still one of the most unique pop songs of the modern era - you can just *hear* it

**rhyneston3** (7.5): Lorde makes music for people who weren’t cool in high school and thought it was because they were misunderstood but really it was because they wore too many flannels and took drama club way too seriously

**bambamhenny** (7): wasn't particularly impressed when it came out and still ain't

**nightjesus** (7): It’s so simple yet so effective. She’ll never be royal, but I’d say she has become indie pop royalty.

**Roxieloxie** (7): i still havent listened to all of pure heroin but now that i've heard more of it i can say, royals dose sound like a very pretentious suburban white song , however it kinda bops so

**Xanleth** (7): Good stuff.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): This is good, catchy, important, influential, but tbh hearing it again it doesn’t have the same heart-wide-open feeling that Lorde’s best songs would end up having on the rest of PH and Melodrama.

**runaway3212** (6): ,5 My least favourite Lorde song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Hot take but most of the influence this song had on pop culture was bad bc most of the songs that were inspired by this suck

**1000\_nights** (5): It's a shame Lorde's defining song is this boring

**DrunkHurricane** (5): most overrated song of the decade

**ExtraEater** (10): Props to Billie and Finneas for making a pop song so muted and soft while still having so much swagger.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One of the best songs of 2019. I remember sitting in my car on my way home from work listening to the new music friday playlist and this song came on. I was bopping to it a bit, and then the drop after the chorus happened and I legitimately got so excited and happy that I started bouncing up and down with a huge grin on my face cause of how good this song was. It really fought for my 11.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Deserves all the praise it got. And nothing about it.

---

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): pls give billie your 11s in the 2019 ultimate main pop girls rate

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic. I haven't been the biggest fan of all of Billie's song but this definitely got what it deserved.

**alwayswords** (10): DUH

**bandnitos** (10): this goes OFF!!!

**bulforster** (10): Duh.

**camerinian** (10): i don't think that bassline has left my head all year

**CritneySpearz** (10): recency bias but it's a fucking bop

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): It deserved every Grammy it won.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): everything about this song is brilliant, the production, the cheeky lyrics, and it being unlike any other song right now. I remember the first time I heard this song I knew it would be a hit.

**kappyko** (10): agree with todd on this one. SO good, and nothing else like it because last year's wave of billie imitators went for more bury a friend

**MrMoodle** (10): Finneas' work on Billie's stuff is easily some of my favourite production this decade.

**nightjesus** (10): Unpopular opinion but Billie Eilish and Finneas O’Connell deserved all their Grammy’s.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): *duh*

**rickikardashian** (10): There's no god I didn't pray for this to be a huge hit, and honestly I'm scared that now I might owe my soul to some entity, because the way this song blew up was not normal and definitely had some help from the other realm

**skargardin** (10): We love a signature song

**steelstepladder** (10): Duh

**timothy444** (10): Honestly, I thought this song was a little too tacky for my tastes but as I kept listening to this and 'bury a friend', I found myself vibing and relating to her energy. What can I say? It's a bop and pleasantly minimalist to listen to. bad guy doesn't need to go extra hard and it benefits from that.

**Tolk1en** (10): Time has healed the trauma that the grammys were. And I must realise and admit that Billie is a pure talent and this song one of her best

**vapourlomo** (10): duh

**waluigiest** (10): This is so deserving of all of its accolades. The writing and the production are miles above most of what plays on the radio. I listened to this album the night it came out, not really knowing anything about Billie, and was immediately hooked by this song from the first listen.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): overplayed but still a very good song, go billie

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.5): (#19) Duh.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): deserved that soty

**bambamhenny** (9): Love the mash-up cover by Bastille

**hikkaru** (9): one of the most recent songs on here but it's already a classic idc

**stickywheels46** (9): Billie is fuckin killing it, can’t help but root for her

**themagicwemade** (9): the outro to this song is literally the best thing released in 2019

**vayyiqra** (9): The first 2:30 minutes of this song bop so hard, but I've never really been sold on the slower trap part at the end. I still like Billie though and this is one of her best songs.

**InternetDude19** (8.9): Even in the context of modern pop this is weird, hearing this in alongside the likes of Pitbull and Train is mind-melting.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): This is such a fresh sound in the mainstream pop scene.

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): - tag yourself I'm might seduce your dad type

**survivorthrowaway5** (8.3): inventive; every lyric is a hook

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Catchy, uniquely abrasive yet simultaneously subtle is Billie at her finest, appropriately lowkey vocals; verse melody is slightly uninspired and last 40s is a distracting outro

**letsallpoo** (8): main pop girl

**ManofOranges** (8): Really fantastic song but I despise the outro. I have no clue why it's there. It ruins the flow of the song.

**slimboyfriend** (8): omg this teen drama

**Xanleth** (8): I like this song from Eilish.

**1000\_nights** (7): Remove the beat switch and it's an 8

**rhyneston3** (7): Love her, but not my favourite song of hers

**runaway3212** (7): ,5 Really good, but I like a lot of her other songs better.

**starlightzone** (7): I’m gonna be the controversial one. I don’t like her voice that much. This is a fine song. The whisper vocals are just not it for me sisters.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Duh

**FrankBedbroken** (6.5): never really got into the hype for this, but it's alright

**gannade** (3.5): why out of all the billie songs did this get big

**palengard389** (3): I’m so sorry but Billie sounds not good and it’s kinda annoying, especially the ending

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i have tried so hard to like this song and everytime i listen to it i just get more confused about its appeal

**Roxieloxie** (2): i dont even like her and i can tell you this is not her best single

**bespectacIed** (1): “There’s a difference between lying in a song and writing a story. There are tons of songs where people are just lying. There’s a lot of that in pop right now, from people that I know who do pop. It’s like, ‘*Bruises, on both my knees for you. Don't say thank you or please*’ and I’m like, what? You don’t have a bruised knee. '*Might seduce your dad type*’ I’m like, which dad? That’s posturing, and that’s not what I’m doing.” -- Billie Eilish, Vogue US March 2020 issue

**ExtraEater** (10): Okay but Gwen Stefani’s “Cool” did this a million times better

**ImADudeDuh** (5): This is one of the better songs off thank u next, but it’s still not that good. Sorry, Chris, especially since I’m assuming you gave a real impassioned writeup on why you love this song so much.

---

**bulforster** (11): This legit makes me tear up. It's so good and really pushed sweetener/thank u, next over the top to become by far the most significant pop era in recent memory. This is pop history laid ease.

**laurent1683** (11): This is my song of the decade because I've never heard simplicity win me over so easily

**anothertown** (10): A perfect song!

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is honestly one of my favorite songs from the past couple years, it’s perfectly cute, pointed, well written, catchy, marketed (her first number one), i really wish they’d submitted it for grammy’s over 7 rings

**bespectacIed** (10): one of her most meaningful and impactful, if not great, songs so I am giving it this score. It's still a bop, but the superficiality surrounding some of the lines and the music video detracts from how big of a deal this song is and should have been.

**CritneySpearz** (10): iconic song, iconic video, iconic era

**fadedblue09** (10): Definitely deserved to be her first #1. It really changed a lot of my prior views on Ariana and her music. Dangerous Woman stans can stay PRESSED. I’m glad that, for once, the GP is on the right side of history and acknowledges actual music quality.

**gannade** (10): ok ari snappt here

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): White people and gays were shook! Who knew name dropping could cause such an impact.

**InternetDude19** (10): This is her best song. I still tear up every time.

**Jexan13** (10): there's something about the synths here that are just... pefect, idk. Really sad lyrics and one of the few pieces of music that is made richer with the context.

**ManofOranges** (10): I was very skeptical when this song first came out, as it was not too long after Sweetener which I did not like at all. I even put off listening to this for a little while actually because I had Ariana burn out. And I'm kinda mad I put off listening to this song simply because It's probably some of Ariana's best work ever.

**nightjesus** (10): I CRIED WHEN SHE RELEASED THIS AND I’M NOT EVEN AN ARI STAN. This song is one of the best she has released. The lyrics, the production, THE VIDEO. There really is no fault.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this song cleanses my pores

**Popfan2489** (10): perfect pop song

**rickikardashian** (10): bacon eggs, bacon eggs, I'm so fucking grateful for my eggs

**runaway3212** (10): I think this is the defining song of the 2010's , not the best, just the defining.

**skargardin** (10): Take me back to the time this song dropped, truly a moment in pop music history

**timothy444** (10): This is a good Ariana Grande song and it's because no-one else could've sung this other than her. The song is just so personal down to the lyrics and it's bittersweet in a weird kind of way.

**Tolk1en** (10): This song is a perfect single to introduce the masterpiece that is TUN, the album. The stories, the release of the music video : perfection

**waluigiest** (10): This the peak of my Ariana stan identity. It fell off as soon as 2019 hit with her tattoo and 7 Rings, but this song is a masterpiece. It was a perfect ode to her recent explosion into the public eye.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): sometimes this is one of my least favourite songs from the album, but today I’m feeling it. I guess cause I haven’t heard it in awhile.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): we love having healthy and constructive perspectives on our exes, and a fun song on top of all that!

**starlightzone** (9.5): my favorite Ariana song. I think it’s beautifully done and just so peaceful and her voice is beautiful.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.3): (#22)

**1998tweety** (9): I listened to a Say So remix of this the other day and it kind of outsold the original oop. I didn't initially like this one release a whole ton but it definitely grew on me, one of her best singles for sure.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Powerful sentiment in lyrics in learning while being thankful for past relationships, Ariana's turning point into a full-blown pop star, love the sweet/twinkly, hip-hop-infused production

**hikkaru** (9): it's still a bop but tu,n the album has better

**palengard389** (9): No thank u Ariana!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): cultural reset.

**bambamhenny** (8): the music video surprisingly has no replayabilty

**steelstepladder** (8): More like Thank U for making this great song

**wavingwolves** (8): we support self love

**Xanleth** (8): A much better Ariana Song.

**yourfacesucksass** (8): Better than 7 Rings ngl, but I like Boyfriend more…even if it has the same structure.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Cute but not terribly interesting.

**bandnitos** (7): ooc of the album its not very strong but in context its pretty good

**FrankBedbroken** (7): definitely better than 7 rings, just a solidly enjoyable track

**rhyneston3** (7): Great lyrics but the chorus just doesn’t work that well for me

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): the lyrics are great but i just wish there were something more production-wise to grab me, because there’s kinda nothing there otherwise that makes me wanna hear this again

**Roxieloxie** (4): the t'challa, thanos cover outsold

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): next

**vayyiqra** (3): I've never liked this song. Something about it just annoys me. I know the lyrics are pure now, but at the time it came out I thought she was singing about finding men disposable or something (I think because of the memes about it), and that might colour how I feel about it. I know that's irrational, but even aside from that it's still a very repetitive and annoying song.

**ExtraEater** (10): I appreciated this song before, but I sure appreciated it a lot more seeing it as a huge contender for the #1 spot. Alas, time went on and its chance at victory slowly waned. Regardless, this was a bop since I first heard it in Just Dance 2, and each listen just reminds me how great it is.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): don’t stop, make it pop, DJ, blow my speakers up, tonight, imma fight, gold teeth, grey goose, trippin in the bathroom, bloodstains, ball gowns, trashin our hotel rooms, Greta Garbo, and Monroe, Deitrich and Dimaggio, Marlon Brando, Jimmy Dean, on the cover of a magazine, Grace Kelly, Harlow, Jean, Leonard Bernstein, Leonid Brezhnev, Lenny Bruce, and Lester Bangs,Birthday party, cheesecake, jellybean, boom, you symbiotic, patriotic, Sputnik, Zhou En-lai, Bridge On The River Kwai, Lebanon, Charles de Gaulle, California baseball, Starkweather homicide, children of thalidomide, Buddy Holly, Ben-Hur, Space Monkey, mafia, obtuse, rubber goose, green moose, guava juice, giant snake, birthday cake, large fries, chocolate shake, oh woah woah oh, oh woah woah oh.

**Awhile2** (11): kinda sad that the best number one of the decade was also the first number one of the decade but its whatever. ill get over it

**ggal2020** (11): this shit’s a bop n a half

**hikkaru** (11): the most "that was a classic" of all of these classics omfg... kesha just gets miss sarah tonin pounding at my door and i have no choice but to let her in

**waluigiest** (11): I can point to this song and maybe even the moment I first heard it, when someone’s phone rang in my English class and this was their ringtone, as the moment I fell in love with pop music

**worlds-okayest666** (11): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, feel like shit just want her back.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Kesha's white-girl rapping has so much personality even if trashy, cheesy production is still wonderfully dancey (gotta give Luke credit where it's due...)

**Awkward\_King** (10): listen i know it’s predictable to give all the early 2010s pop songs my main pop girlies 10s but there’s a reason i’m a pophead i was raised on these songs and they slap

**bambamhenny** (10): that app better run ke$ha her coins

**bandnitos** (10): glee's cover of this is their best cover no i will not be taking criticism

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic, ground-breaking, massive. Love her.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#12) Icon.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): We would not have made it through this decade without this song.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song was a cultural moment in the best way possible.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): BOP!!!

**nightjesus** (10): Legit when Tik Tok app was released I legit thought it was a fan app to this song. I was kinda disappointed when it wasn’t.

**palengard389** (10): Iconic

**poppinmmolly** (10): although released in the previous decade, I'm glad this made it to the year end in 2010 so we could have this absolute bop in this rate.

**ReallyCreative** (10): I am once again asking for the world to stop fetishizing old white rockers (Mick Jagger??? Again? Can we come up with new material??) but how could you give this song anything but the 10 it deserves

**rhyneston3** (10): All I wanna do is get drunk with Kesha

**rickikardashian** (10): This song reminds of all the wild parties when this was at its peak that I imagined I went, because I was 9 years old when this came out and never left my house

**rslashpoopheads** (10): The first time I saw the thumbnail of this video on the iTunes store I thought she was some new Disney girl.

**runaway3212** (10): Smartly made and perfectly sung makes this more than just enjoyable

**skargardin** (10): Iconic

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the fact that we're old for thinking of this first when we hear "tik tok..." i can't STAND IT!!

**vapourlomo** (10): The pinnacle of the early 10s pop boom.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.9): tiny sliver deducted because it blocked bad romance from the top and i am a salty, petty bitch

**starlightzone** (9.5): If you didn’t bop to this when you were in the parking lot outside of school what were you doing? Being a boring adult? Thought so.

**bulforster** (9): We started the decade off *right*. This is basically the ultimate late 00's/early 10's pop song.

**starla\_** (9): i bought a pair of light wash ripped up jeans when i was 16 because i wanted to emulate kesha

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Tik Tok is a good app y’all just hate children

**Tolk1en** (9): iconic, i can't think of anything else listening to this, but I think about tik tok when someone says iconic

**vayyiqra** (9): ~~Why has it always sounded to me like she says TSIK TSAHK ON DE CWAHCK in the chorus~~ This song is gloriously stupid, and also brilliant somehow??? It sounds like chiptunes meets electroclash, and it's so trashy and dumb, but also Kesha makes partying with her sound so fun. I have never been and will probably never go to a party like she describes in this song, but I can vicariously through her, and I appreciate that.

**wavingwolves** (9): did you know? the app tiktok was created solely with the purpose of being a place for people to share videos of themselves dancing to ke$ha's tik tok

**Xanleth** (9): Kesha, sticks out to me as a rather unique pop girl voice to me and this song is no exception.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9): still a banger

**megm26** (8.9): yeah it’s a trashy dumb party song but goddamnit it SLAPS

**survivorthrowaway5** (8.5): classic; credit to dr. luke

**steelstepladder** (8): More like Tik Tok is better than vine

**timothy444** (8): Genius at its time. Why try and make yourself the perfect popstar when you can embrace all the trashiness that comes with it? Kesha made it her brand and it works! Tik Tok was only just the beginning of her truly transformative career.

**FKJVMMP** (6): I want to like it a lot more than I do. Story of Ke$ha’s career in general.

**FrankBedbroken** (6): i think this aged well all things considered but i'm decking a whole point off just because dr luke idk

**Jexan13** (5): There's really something about Dr L*ke production that was always offputting to me. This is the prime example; I never liked this song too much. I felt the production was almost like white noise and too gray. Sorry, Ke dollar sign ha

**Roxieloxie** (5): everytime i hear this song i think of diary of a wimpy kid

**fadedblue09** (1): I will never understand why popheads continues to glorify Kesha’s pre-Rainbow stuff. She was literally the female version of LMFAO/Pitbull and deserves to be trashed for it.

**ExtraEater** (10): If Gangnam Style is the king of 2012, then Call Me Maybe is the queen. Oh, when YouTube Rewind wasn’t universally loathed

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I have never heard of this song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): *Thee* catchiest song of the entire 21st century.

---

**CritneySpearz** (11): legendaric

**rosesmp3** (11): i have vivid memories of hearing this song for the first time and it STILL slaps years later.

**runaway3212** (11): Fun pop perfection that has never been paralleled in th history of pop music.

**wavingwolves** (11): anyone that give this a score under 9 should be banned from the sub

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): HEY I JUST MET YOU / AND THIS IS CRAZY / BUT THIS SONG IS SO GODDAMN CATCHY AND IMMEDIATE AND DANCEY / SO HERE'S A TEN TO YET ANOTHER MEMEY 2011 SONG

**Awkward\_King** (10): im a faggot im a faggot im a faggot (deadass though one of the best pop choruses of all time, so amazingly catchy because of it’s production)

**bambamhenny** (10): how can i give anything less to the patron saint of popheads, invented pop, the strings still get me

**bandnitos** (10): a CLASSIC!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): Responsible for Carly's meals for the rest of her life. If it wasn't for the coins this song made, we wouldn't have emotion, side b and dedicated, so for this super generic annoying capital-H HIT, I am thankful

**camerinian** (10): the song's good OK can we please stop rating it now

**fadedblue09** (10): Truly iconic.

**hikkaru** (10): nowhere near her best but it still slaps idc idc

**ignitethephoenix** (10): sure emotion created popheads, but this songs popularity invented popheads. Without it, none of all would care about her. Also another song that is pop perfection.

**InternetDude19** (10): Iconic.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): Carly’s one and only hit the GP remembers

**nightjesus** (10): Bitch I knew this song before Bieber tweeted it. I think I heard it on Radio Disney and I instantly LOVED it.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): we have no choice but to stan

**ReallyCreative** (10): GAY RIGHTS

**Roxieloxie** (10): when Nathan Zed said this was the perfect pop song he wasnt lying. It's peak pop, also it brought us this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GkD3qrcETw) so what else is there to say

**starlightzone** (10): let’s be basic gays again and stop hating each other and go back to a better time when call me maybe was number 1

**timothy444** (10): The "Run Away With Me" girl before she became the "run away with me" girl

**Tolk1en** (10): a reset, it's a 11 in my heart.

**untutorable** (10): best pop song ever written

**vapourlomo** (10): This song's gonna win the rate (either it or Bad Romance). And I'm gonna be a part of the problem. Sorry.

**vayyiqra** (10): Should I even try to explain why I love this? We all love Carly here, and this song is an earworm. That's all that needs to be said about it. Ignore the sketchy grammar in the post-chorus and enjoy it, because it's pop perfection.

**Xanleth** (10): Even in my edgy ‘hate the pop music’ phase as a youthful teen I couldn’t hate this song with my whole heart.

**rhyneston3** (9.5): Curiosity deserved to be as big a hit as this (the non-album version though)

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Invented phones and pop music.

**themagicwemade** (9): HI MY NAME'S ROLANDA

**yourfacesucksass** (9): A classic whether it’s hated or not

**megm26** (8.7): this still slaps and it always will slap

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): i don’t even like crj that much im a fake pophead

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8.5): still a bop

**alwayswords** (8): gay rights!

**ManofOranges** (8): Love you Carly but I have to admit this is not as amazing as I remembered.

**skargardin** (8): Iconic

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Carly fans might act like they don't like ths song anymore, but we honestly have to recognize just how iconic this song still is. And honestly... is has always slapped.

**waluigiest** (8): always grateful that this moment happened

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): (#44) Ladies and gentlemen, our national anthem.

**FrankBedbroken** (7): even though i still like the song, me and my friend were talking about how we were excited about dedicated coming out and someone asked "oh the call me maybe chick?" in a dismissive tone and i got real sad :c, it's unfortunate that this has a bad reputation

**GiftoftheGeek** (7): Carly went from 'call me maybe?' to 'run away with me'. Character progression

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.7): undeniable - remember how crazy frat boys got to this?; prechorus is better than chorus

**FKJVMMP** (6): I, a straight man who was already out of school when this came out, am absolutely not the target audience for this. Catchy though, and it lead to greater things.

**kappyko** (6): now that i think about it i don't even really listen to this that much! it doesn't really work that much as a crush song, at least not as much as many songs on emotion and even kiss!

**steelstepladder** (5): So when are we going to admit this is one of Carly's worst songs and that it's ok at best? And I say this as someone who thinks Emotion is one of the best albums ever made

**bandnitos** (10): this song's piano thingy is surprisingly close to the arpeggio in the gravity falls theme song

**camerinian** (10): I prefer the live version where she doesn't go super high on the chorus. That is my only criticism

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#9) Listening to Adele is the closest I'll ever get to having a relationship, and that's already emotionally draining enough.

**hikkaru** (10): missing my nonexistent ex wife rn

**Jexan13** (10): taught me to sing. Badly, of course

**ManofOranges** (10): Probably Adele's best song in my opinion. There's not a thing in here that doesn't elicit some sort of emotion.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): i remember when this was my go to sad music

**bespectacIed** (9): overrated but it's undeniably iconic. I'm tired of rating the same two Adele songs tho

**fadedblue09** (9): A breath of fresh air to this rate, and to the awful music of the early 10’s.

**nightjesus** (8): Had a girl who I did singing lessons with sing this song and it was like listening to Adele. I was in awe. She gave me goosebumps.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): :’(

**vapourlomo** (8): Objectively great song that I don't have any desire to hear again

**vayyiqra** (8): This is a great song, but it makes me so depressed. Not sad, depressed, which is a different thing. It makes me think about reaching adulthood and never finding love again, which is just so deeply depressing to me.

**Xanleth** (8): Killer Vocals.

**anothertown** (7): (really small font so no one can see) shout out santana from glee

**FKJVMMP** (6): I appreciate the complexity of the emotion, the quality of her voice, all that. Still sounds like a fucking funeral march though.

**Jexan13** (10): when i heard this song and saw the video for the first time I was just shocked so hard. I only listened to electro pop, but that song was just soooo perfect. I became obsessed. Many years latter, I listen to it and love it just like the first time. Too bad there's only one 11.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): How many rates will this song appear in?

**palengard389** (10): THE BACKGROUND SINGING

**ReallyCreative** (10): One of Adele's best, I don't even know what it means to roll in the deep but I'm like YAS we could have had it all~!

**rickikardashian** (10): one day I'll be able to sing this properly, I know it, I don't care that my vocal range consists of 5 notes and I can't hold any of them for more than 4 seconds

**rslashpoopheads** (10): I heard this when it was first released and I KNEW it was gonna be a smash.

**runaway3212** (10): Adele is just amazing and this is her best song ever.

**skargardin** (10): Even if we've rated this a billion times already, it isn't any less of a ten

**starla\_** (10): somehow i never got sick of this one

**starlightzone** (10): Easy 10 No question about it this is the song that basically shot Adele right into the galaxy of pop divas. Her voice? Her Power? Nothing else. NOTHING ELSE.

**steelstepladder** (10): More like I'm rolling on molly and this song makes me feel the love

**themagicwemade** (10): i used to sing this as a child and my cousin who was, like, a broadway singer would bully me for my vocal technique. ella i was an 8 year old i didn't deserve to be attacked for my lack of breath control

**Tolk1en** (10): a cultural reset, a masterpiece, a serious 11 contender

**waluigiest** (10): the writing and performance are simply unparalleled

**Xanleth** (10): A powerhouse of a song from the singer.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): how many times has this song been in a popheads rate?

**megm26** (9.1): it always shocks me that adele was just 21 when she made this + the rest of the album, she sounds mature and wise years beyond her age.

**bandnitos** (9): period

**camerinian** (9): the song’s good OK can we please stop rating it now

**FKJVMMP** (9): Still easily the best song she’s ever made, even though I have no idea what half the lyrics mean. Gets the point across well enough anyway.

**GiftoftheGeek** (9): Shoutout to Adele for sneaking the word 'shit' on the radio for a while, simply because no one would expect it from her.

**slimboyfriend** (9): ok yes a classic

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): 2011 was different man.

**vapourlomo** (9): My inner soccer mom thinks this is a banger of the highest order. And she's right

**wavingwolves** (9): the amount of youtube covers this has... truly astonishing

**FrankBedbroken** (8): not much to say here, just an extremely solid tune from a solid artist

**nightjesus** (8): Man this song started a phenomenon. Adele was everywhere in 2010/2011. My middle aged hairdresser had her album on repeat for years.

**rhyneston3** (8): We love a good gambling metaphor that took me 8 years to understand

**timothy444** (8): I quite like this Adele song.

**vayyiqra** (8): I want to rate this higher for being such an iconic and classic song, but it's not even my favourite Adele song, so I can't really do that. But I also can't say it isn't a great song, because it is.

**DrunkHurricane** (7.5): overrated

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): overplay kinda ruined this one for me

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.1): classic

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Fantastic vocal and lyrics but the instrumental is okay and sounds dated as hell

**anothertown** (7): I have so much less patience for Ms. Dell than I used to lol

**InternetDude19** (7): This wasn't as good as I remembered it being.

**ManofOranges** (7): This is another song that I don't like as much as I did when it first came out. It also doesn't help that it somehow keeps appearing in rates.

**Roxieloxie** (7): popheads im begging you let me rate a new adele song

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): how many times to we have to teach you this lesson old man

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I was never as into this one as much as Adele’s other hits from 21, but hearing it removed from its dominance it’s a decent song with a great vocal performance

**RandomHypnotica** (6): OK, Rolling in the Deep is great, but this is like the 5th time we've rated this song and i'm just sick of it ok

**ExtraEater** (10): Frankly could’ve been the dark horse contender, the song that’s never been rated before that would pull an upset and beat all the predictable choices but yet here we are. I'm disappointed. I was ESPECIALLY disappointed when I saw that one rate ballot that gave this a ONE (1). When I saw that, this song's chances went down the drain and all my hopes in this sub were completely erased. Anyway, the synths on this are beautiful, basically the equivalent to a rainbow sherbet, and Nicki’s flow is undeniable

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This made it to the top 3? Holy shit??? I knew that a lot of people liked this song, but I didn’t think that nearly everyone liked this song! It’s kinda incredible how high this song got even with r/moralheads dragging Nicki’s antics now with every chance that they got.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): One of the best pop songs of all time. A classic

---

**bandnitos** (11): A FUCKING CLASSIC YALL DONT UNDERSTAND!!!! WEDDINGS! GRADUATIONS! FUNERALS!

**bbfan132** (11): an iconic bop that defined the decade. period.

**bespectacIed** (11): I'm reserving my essay-length blurb for my 11, that I know will not win because nicki is deservedly hated in this sub. This rate made me realize how surface level the charts have been in building my music preferences. All these songs are undeniably the biggest of the decade, but I enjoy so fucking little of the songs here that giving an 11 is so easy. It's a deceptively simple song: it's Nicki comparing two vastly different guys: a rugged, "street", practical guy and a professional, bougie, "has his shit together" kind of guy. Both guys have that something, that "super bass", whatever that means --- an aura, a vibe,  a huge ass, a huge dick, who cares. Nicki loves both of them equally. It's that fundamental expression of attraction in a pop song that entices me so much. But all of that corny shit I just said is trumped by Nicki's fucking lyrical humor and prowess. Like I said, Super Bass is just a basic love song but the way Nicki weaved these fucking hilarious bars with her strong imagery makes it so much interesting. Nicki has that special talent of bottling up the essence of pop through rap, and for that, i'm held hostage by Onika, forever.

**flemmli** (11): Pop Perfection

**kappyko** (11): from start to finish, this is THE crush song of the decade. ester dean is one of pop's best songwriters, the beat is like cotton candy and velvet and a million EDM R&B and hip hop genres melted and frozen and blended into a milkshake, nicki is at her best. nothing sounds as important or as sincere.

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, the first verse of this is incredibly iconic and you already know every twink has it memorized.

**anothertown** (10): He just gotta gimme that look when he gimme that look then the panties comin awf!!!!!!

**bambamhenny** (10): sue sylvester i hate you

**brodiepp** (10): big love to nicki, i’m so sorry u didn’t get a #1 sweetie, this song was fire to kickstart the queen of rap, chuck the deuce up

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#4) This is also stupid, but in the best possible way.

**CritneySpearz** (10): it took me too long to realize superb ass is a thing...

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Pop-rap perFECTION

**Jexan13** (10): this was teenager me's best song of all time, ok?

**ManofOranges** (10): The opening rap made me gay.

**Mudkip1** (10): iconic

**rhyneston3** (10): Icon legend star ninki minjaj

**rickikardashian** (10): If TikTok has taught me something about my generation is that absolutely all of us know the first verse perfectly. Nicki might not have a #1 hit, but this song defined an era

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Deserves a posthumous #1.

**skargardin** (10): Whew what a moment

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): remember when nicki minaj wasn’t controversial

**waluigiest** (10): sue sylvester ate it !

**wavingwolves** (10): i fucking love this!!!!

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this song feels like bubblegum to my ears

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): That first verse, absolutely iconic. This song is definitely Nicki’s signature song.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): The most impressive thing about this song imo is that, despite it's success, nobody else has made something that sounds as close to as good as this. This dreamy light pop-synth instrumental, with your standard rap verse, then this very poppy chorus it's just amazing.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): thisoneisfortheboyswiththeboominsystem

**FrankBedbroken** (9): modern classic, also side note does anyone still have that mashup with so hot you're hurting my feelings i neeeeeed it

**hikkaru** (9): we love pop nicki

**nightjesus** (9): If you think about it, Anaconda is the R rated version of this song.

**runaway3212** (9): I miss Nicki, she was at her best a great artist with good artistic vision.

**starlightzone** (9): I think this is probably one of Nicki’s best songs to date that doesn’t make me cry for any reason.

**vapourlomo** (9): Remember when Nicki was fun?

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a great pop song, *almost* perfection, but there's something just a bit off about the lyrics to me. It's full of strong hooks though, and I like how happy and positive it sounds.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): *clears throat* THIS ONE IS FOR THE BOYS WITH THE BOOMINSYSTEM

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Nicki's rapping oozes personality and carries the shimmering instrumental, okay chorus but overall just slaps

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): Had everything going for it to be a #1, but it just wasn’t for some reason.

**FKJVMMP** (8): I don’t know why every pop song she made didn’t sound like this.

**hunnybee12** (8): purely for nostalgia

**ReallyCreative** (8): More fun and interesting than I remembered? I was ready to throw this into the "okay but not really good" bin of 5s and 6s this rate is filled to the brim with but Nicki might have popped off here

**steelstepladder** (8): More like Nicki has a superb ass amirite?

**survivorthrowaway5** (8): classic, defining, signature; every lyric a hook

**themagicwemade** (8): i know every word to this song and i dont even know when i memorized them. it's like they were surgically implanted in my head when i realized i liked dick

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): the only song we haven't rated yet that could possibly win imo

**timothy444** (7): Deserves a lower score but popheads loves this song to death

**Xanleth** (5): This song is fine.

**fadedblue09** (3.5): Well at least it’s not Starships???

**Roxieloxie** (1): this specific nicki song brings back really bad memories of my old best friend

**ExtraEater** (10): Unless someone else can execute it with the same level of catharsis and dignity, “I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream” is officially *her* lyric. Style isn’t a part of this rate, but this song can pull just about the same weight, if not more.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): 1989 is an overrated record. It’s influence is way overstated and the album has a lot more bad songs than it really should to be able to be called a modern classic imo. It also marked a weird decline in Taylor’s writing especially for her some of the album cuts. Blank Space is good tho.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8.5): The lyrics are top-notch. I just wish the production was a lot better.

---

**MasterWizardRyan** (11): Taylor’s best single EVER!!!

**rickikardashian** (11): I could probably do a 30 pages thesis about how this is one of the greatest pop songs to ever be created on absolutely all aspects of it, but I know no one reads these things, so all I'll say is that from this moment forward, I sold my soul to this woman, and I have pledged complete loyalty to her until the day I die. I'm Taylor's property and I will die for her if necessary. Thank you my queen, for giving purpose to my life.

**themagicwemade** (11): my 11 was between this and someone like you but i ultimately decided to give it to this song because i am nothing if not a degenerate swiftie

**1998tweety** (10): One of her best songs periodt. The way she effortlessly dismantled one of the narratives thrown on her while also making it an extremely catchy song...her mind.

**Awkward\_King** (10): queen. I remember being like twelve and stanning taylor before i knew what stanning was in the 1989 era

**bandnitos** (10): her best single

**bespectacIed** (10): I put this in the league of All Too Well, False God and Holy Ground as Taylor's most well-written songs. Blank Space is not just a basic pop song, it's a character narrative. Pure genius pop.

**hikkaru** (10): honestly one of the most impactful songs on my relationship with pop music... converted me from a hater

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): I remember having “Darling, I’m a nightmare dressed like a daydream” as my bio on all my social media profiles. Damn. I was white as fuck in middle school

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Definitely one of Taylor’s best

**letsallpoo** (10): THIS IS THE BEST SONG ON 1989 AND HER BEST SONG POST-RED. FUCK STYLE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**ManofOranges** (10): Some of Taylor's best writing ever. She did that.

**nightjesus** (10): WHAT is pop music? WHERE is pop music? WHEN is pop music? WHO is pop music? Well I’m glad you asked. It’s right here.

**poppinmmolly** (10): still among my favorites from her, and by FAR my favorite music video. I don't think she can ever top it.

**ReallyCreative** (10): The self-awareness JUMPED out, we love that. Delightfully intelligent and catchy, well-produced, amazing lyrics, this is one of Taylor's best songs and really showed her potential as an artist to me

**runaway3212** (10): The perfect pop song.

**skargardin** (10): Perfection, the way she lyrically killed this song

**timothy444** (10): It's awesome for Taylor to play up the media reception towards her and turn it into another solid pop song

**Tolk1en** (10): Perfect song, perfect music video

**wavingwolves** (10): the quintessential taylor swift song. we love one of the best hit songs of the decade!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): the first time I heard this was in a McDonalds and i FULLY thought it was the pinnacle of modern music

**Roxieloxie** (9.9): Despite my feelings on Ms. Allison Swift, i cant deny this song almost made me a swiftie. i remember listing to leaks of this back in 2014 before school started. This is her best song nothing after this has even come close to toping this piece of art

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Clean, catchy if slightly generic production, love the chorus especially *tchk* before "and I'll write your name", Taylor's lyrics as usual the strong suit

**Popfan2489** (9): tongue in cheek and sassy, it’s so beautifully written

**rhyneston3** (9): I am not a Taylor Swift fan and this song almost converted me, it’s so well-written

**steelstepladder** (9): This is Taylor playing into her own negative perception in a fun way. For a significantly less fun time, you can check out the next album.

**vapourlomo** (9): Great song; legendary music video

**waluigiest** (9): Honestly it’s a masterfully constructed pop song. Clean production, good writing with a few very quotable moments, a neat mix of acoustic instruments and synthesized sounds, relatable content….. It’s like it was engineered to be a hit. None of that detracts from it being a great song.

**Xanleth** (9): One of the best Taylor Swift songs.

**starlightzone** (8.5): I mean the song is good but 1989 has better songs.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.4): One day I was playing Animal Crossing: New Leaf, and I went to the multiplayer island where you can play games with others from around the world. This was around the time Taylor released this single. I was typing in a message for it to be shown to the other player on the island. The message read, “AND U LOVE THE GAME” in all caps. The other player sent “OMG” and then left.

**fadedblue09** (8.2): Love Taylor, but this feels a little weak in this list. As an album track, it’s a 10, but as a decade-defining hit? I’m not feeling it.

**FKJVMMP** (8): Production wears thin after a while but this is everything the bitchy part of Reputation should have been.

**palengard389** (8): Good song but far from her best

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): top 3 taylor songs.

**vayyiqra** (8): This isn't my favourite song on *1989* but that is my favourite Taylor album by far and this is still a good song. "Style" is still the best song from this era though, and I wish we were rating that instead.

**bulforster** (7.8): This was such a moment but the production hasn't aged very well to my ears.

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.6): rebirth/reinvention song

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): (#42) This is lower than Shake it Off, because fuck you.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (7.5): maybe one day i will finally have a clear opinion on this song.

**FrankBedbroken** (7): ok taylor you win this time

**rslashpoopheads** (7): clever

**ExtraEater** (10): This was so likely to be the winner of the rate that this writeup (up to “...inevitable winner”) was done weeks before I even submitted the Decade-End Rate to the Rate Ideas form. Of all the songs in this rate, it’s received the highest average (9.428) and it ranked an impressive 3rd place in the later Winners Rate (with a 9.170), with only RAWM and Toxic above it (neither of which are in this rate). Add onto this the power of nostalgia, the love for 2008-2012 music, and the complete undeniability of TFM-era Lady Gaga in this sub’s eyes, and you have a recipe for an inevitable winner… And yeah, here we are. No alarms and no surprises. Refer to Chris' comment.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Yeah, it’s fucking great. What else is there to say?

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Are we surprised? Are we fucking surprised? Why did we think anything other than FAD Romance would win this rate? It’s got an amazing music video of course, and the song is great, but it’s nowhere near the top 10 of the decade end. It’s also the first song to ever win TWO rates but I 100% would’ve rather had Adele get this honor instead of Nosega! Some valiant people tried to fight the overrating but it was no use! Half the people that did this rate were 11 when this came out, so that automatically makes this the best song of all time of their gay lives! If I sound presst, it’s cause that’s what my tone is trying to be.

**1998tweety** (11): Obligatory Bad Romance 11. This song just has everything. Where did this Gaga go? I just want her back.

**\_\_Avaritia** (11): Legendary iconic bop, everything from the iconic 'rah-rah' hook, the driving electronic synths throughout, the fantastic 'walk walk' bridge, literally flawless

**alwayswords** (11): everything about this song is just :chefskiss

**Awkward\_King** (11): oh my god after listening to cheerleader this has never sounded better. one of gaga’s best songs, one of the best pop songs period

**bambamhenny** (11): ain't she that ra ra bitch, but for real a serve, when will we ever get another song like bad romance , a cultural reset etc.

**ManofOranges** (11): This song is legendary in every way shape and form. The way it opens, it lets you know right away that this song is going to be a tour de force, the likes of which you have never ever seen before in your life. The hypnotic chant that Lady Gaga does is absolutely unparalleled, and the lyrics are actually quite enthralling and ear-catching. There's not a single thing in this song that I don't love. I realize that this winning would be incredibly predictable but to that I say, "what's wrong with predictable?" This song deserves every single piece of praise it gets.

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): this is the only correct choice

**ReallyCreative** (11): A self-explanatory classic, an iconic moment in cultural history, and a homosexual awakening for closeted children of the Earth

**skargardin** (11): This is the pinnacle of pop music, THIS is how it's done! It hasn't aged one bit since it released, truly a legendary song.

**slimboyfriend** (11): YEs I'm hoping this wins another rate even though it won't

**bandnitos** (10): a modern CLASSIC

**brodiepp** (10): fireeeeeeee

**bulforster** (10): It was a cultural reset... it was a cultural reset.

**hikkaru** (10): this probably wins pretty easily and like... yeah it's what she deserves but also that would be real boring

**ignitethephoenix** (10): queen came, ate and conquered

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): Pop perfection

**nightjesus** (10): Cause I’m a free bitch baby.

**palengard389** (10): Dont like the first bridge but I like the second...that’s why you should have two!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Everything about this song is amazing. The crazy euro-pop influence, the ra-ra's the mv it's all just amazing and truly peak Gaga

**rickikardashian** (10): This was this decade? Jesus Christ, I feel like Bad Romance has just always existed, as if the entire universe was created by it

**runaway3212** (10): Gaga at her best, stream Stupid Love.

**starlightzone** (10): stream stupid love you stupid bitch

**stickywheels46** (10): This is r/popheads, this is going to win

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): i like some lady gaga songs but what the fuck do she know about cameras? (also congrats on the win!)

**Tolk1en** (10): Maybe the biggest cultural reset of the decade

**TragicKingdom1** (10): im giving this a 10 but i really hope it loses for the shock value

**vapourlomo** (10): One Gaga song made this chart?! At least it's one of the classics...

**vayyiqra** (10): I've told this story before on Popheads, but on NYE in 2010, I was at a club with my friends, and this song came on when it was close to midnight, and we all gathered in a circle and had an impromptu sing-along until it was over, with all of us knowing all of the words perfectly, and then went back to whatever we were doing before. If a super-gay pop song can make a group of drunk straight guys do that, it must be something special, and I stand by that. This is one of the best electropop songs ever written. If my 11 hadn't been used already this song would get it for sure.

**waluigiest** (10): a perfect pop song. Part of me doesn’t want it to win because it would be boring, but it really is just a masterpiece.

**wavingwolves** (10): that's gay

**anothertown** (9.5): hello lgbt community

**camerinian** (9.5): watch this win a second rate because we're all predictable bitches

**Jexan13** (9.5): I think it is a hate crime that the dramatic intro tune that is in the video is not in the single audio.

**yourfacesucksass** (9.4): Redefined and ushered in a new era of pop as dance. The heavy synths at the beginning is legit the sound of 2009-2011, you could hear it in so many songs, not just from RedOne but from Stargate, etc.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): I miss the peak of the TFM era, when electropop ruled the airwaves and this album somehow felt like the only thing that truly mattered

**steelstepladder** (9): For the last four rates I've participated in a song I gave a nine to won, and I get the sense that we have a good chance on continuing the trend today

**timothy444** (9): You can't deny the impact this song has had on modern pop music. What a pop icon.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.5): (#31) This better not win.

**megm26** (8.5): i wouldn’t be surprised to see this win the rate but it is a really good song.

**bloupp** (8): Great song but overhyped

**kappyko** (8): if this wins none of you will know peace. and it's gonna win because, well, it is a great song! but god am i tired of the fame/tfm era winning every rate it enters.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): A good song but overrated because of the MV and cultural impact.

**Xanleth** (8): Good stuff.

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.5): classic and smart

**letsallpoo** (7): god i dont want this to win but i cant give this a low score im sorry edit: nvm i can

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ok but why is this 5 minutes long. does it really need to be that long

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Eh, it’s fine, but I think it’s more of “Turn of The Decade” rather than something that represents the 2010s as a whole. And I really don’t feel a strong attachment to it, sorry.

**FKJVMMP** (6): The video justifies this song’s existence a lot more than the song itself does.

**rhyneston3** (5): I cannot understand a single thing she says in the post bridge (and in a lot of the verses as well?). I also hate spoken word prechoruses so overall not really a fan

**Roxieloxie** (3): im so tired of rating this, i know its gonna win but still

**selegend** (3): overrated

**gannade** (2.5): ugh fadga

**bespectacIed** (1): sorry not sorry because this score won't change its rank n e way. This rate is is so fucking predictable, we all know this is gonna win. And I do love Bad Romance as much as the next fag, and it's an undeniable master class of pop songwriting and production. But I feel like people has overrated the song (I can count 10+ songs from Ga that I rate above this) because the video is one of the most iconic videos of all time

TakeOnMeByA-ha: So this is what it’s come down to, huh?

With the crowning of “Bad Romance” as the 2010’s single greatest piece of music, r/popheads has finally completed their transition from pretentious music rag to absolute, unsalvageable garbage. Maybe I’m just old and out of touch. Maybe the children are wrong. But I have no idea how a song with such a generic beat and such a generic flow and such generic, mindless lyrics like “Bad Romance” is even considered a decent piece of music, much less some groundbreaking work of art.

It’s obvious at this point that r/popheads has changed, and for the worse. This wouldn’t have happened even five rates ago. Back then you could have critiqued r/popheads for their blind stanning of any female who breathes or their misandry or their forced, unfunny memes, but their rates? Their rates contained some genuinely forward thinking, boundary pushing music. When they made a rate it felt as if they were really trying to reward the best music of their respective albums. Don’t believe me? Their top three songs of the Futuristic Flops Rate were Kylie Minogue’s “All The Lovers” and “Get Out of my Way”, and Robyn’s “Dancing On My Own”, three songs that were unique, innovative, and overall well-crafted pieces of pop music. Let’s go back even further, to the One Hit Wonderland rate. r/popheads’ top three songs from that rate were The Proclaimers’ “I’m Gonna Be (500 Miles)”, The Cardigans’ “Lovefool”, and A-ha’s “Take On Me”. There’s no way, absolutely no way at all, that you can tell me that “Bad Romance” deserves to be ranked among any of those songs.

And you know what? I actually like some of this list. In the top ten alone I really like “TiK ToK” and “Rolling In The Deep” and “Super Bass”. But the songs that I do like are simply overwhelmed by the amount of trash elsewhere. And it’s not even as if these “trash” songs have some redeeming qualities here and there. It’s not as if they’re songs that, while well-executed, just fail to connect with me. The reality is that, try as I might, I simply cannot fathom what makes a song like “Bad Romance” or “Thank U, Next” an enjoyable, forward thinking piece of music. I can’t even fathom what makes those songs “decent”. To me they just sound like absolute, unmitigated, garbage.

So yeah, I’m getting older. What might have connected with me ten years ago may not connect with me now. But r/popheads has also changed. And in their attempt to gain a larger audience they’ve shed the bulk of the avant-garde music that might’ve scared off some of their potential audience (could you even imagine something as weird as the 4 minute long psychedelic odyssey that is “Take On Me” cracking the top ten in 2020?) in favor of music that largely panders to the lowest common denominator.

Congratulations, r/popheads. I hope all that extra ad revenue is worth it.
