=================================================================================

ExtraEater: Before we start:

* The bonus rate will be revealed in the same way as the 2009 rate, each song being revealed at the point they would be revealed if they were in the rate, based on its average

* As a small side event, a bunch of non-fictional/fictional characters are [holding a bet on the rate](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LejKMhBj7125mrPePDqG1EKw41kkE_hfdPASG_rfcgs/edit?usp=sharing) (spreadsheet linked). Updates at the end of each day

* To continue the tradition from the previous rate, there will be complementary SpongeBob images for each song. For example: [Justin Timberlake - Mirrors](https://i.imgur.com/wdAwJcE.png). These will all be compiled together at the end of the rate!

**ExtraEater** (10): Lol

**ImADudeDuh** (1): And people say white people have no culture

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): I don‚Äôt wanna watch you do anything Silento.

---

**Roxieloxie** (10): So like a week ago im 98% sure i saw silento on tinder, i didnt swipe right on him but i almost considered it just to verify if it was actually him

**bespectacIed** (8): Calling all my fellow hags. This is it, hags. This was our Renegade. Only it was fucking easy to dance and doesn't require every muscle group of your body.

**waluigiest** (8): okay but the video of the children choir singing this..... sauce

**vayyiqra** (7): lol. As dumb as this song is, it's a fun meme. It's only 3 minutes but feels longer, and also wtf is a stanky leg, but I don't hate it and it gives me a chuckle every time I hear it.

**yourfacesucksass** (7): Seven is like my, ‚Äúit was a song that went viral at one point‚Äù score

**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): i used to hate this so much, just like everyone else. but somehow i find it lowkey cute now. the "bop" parts are still insufferable though.

**starlightzone** (6): uhhhh I don‚Äôt even know how to describe what I feel when I listen to this I mostly assume it‚Äôs just like pure agony but I still bop.

**anothertown** (5): +1 for stanky leg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i can‚Äôt objectively rate this song bc its barely a song as it so im giving it a 5

**worlds-okayest666** (5): why is he telling me to break my legs? Is this a threat? Marty i‚Äôm scared

**PointlessBibliophage** (4.9): i will not

**bulforster** (3.8): Stank stank.

**jackisboredtoday** (3.7): i mean i hate it, but you can‚Äôt really hate this kind of song that much, it just is what it is

**bambamhenny** (3): meme song i'm sorry

**FKJVMMP** (3): I don‚Äôt know why this was ever treated as a real song, but as something to throw on at a primary school dance it‚Äôs fine.

**ignitethephoenix** (2): the dance is iconic but this is not good at all sorry

**poppinmmolly** (2): this is not good

**untutorable** (2): i don't want to do it anymore please i don't want to watch anymore!!

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): fuck this

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): Trash meme, trash lyrics, trash production, could not wait for the song to end

**alwayswords** (1): i hate this moment in history

**bandnitos** (1): HOW. HOW??????

**camerinian** (1): I kinda wanted to give this a few pity points because Silento's Twitter feed has been fucking depressing as of late. But I mean, like‚Ä¶ It's Watch Me Whip/Nae Nae by Silento

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#96) NO.

**fadedblue09** (1): More garbage, I guess...

**hikkaru** (1): no

**InternetDude19** (1): No matter how many times he says Bop, this is still not a bop.

**kappyko** (1): didnt madonnas company have something to do with this

**ManofOranges** (1): I think Silento is just a disgrace. He is just a disgrace to humanity and he is a disgrace to humans who are actually beautiful and classy and he just doesn't have the vernacular that he thinks he possesses. Somebody lied to him several times and told him that this song was fly, hot, sexy, and beautiful, and it is nothing like that, it is nothing of the sort.

**nightjesus** (1): Soulja Boy did it better.

**ReallyCreative** (1): iconic dances, absolutely garbage song, like one of the worst of this rate

**rslashpoopheads** (1): Cute dance tutorial.

**skargardin** (1): Bye

**steelstepladder** (1): Silento? ore like I wish he was silent OOOOOHHHHH!!!!

**stickywheels46** (1): Watch me puke cos this song sucks

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): hate to be a boomer but this is just not it.

**timothy444** (1): Terrible

**vapourlomo** (1): Get this knockoff Soulja Boy outta here

**wavingwolves** (1): i hope silent√≥ is having a nice day

**Xanleth** (1): I‚Äôd rather not.

**1998tweety** (0): Not good and annoying af, sorry.

**brodiepp** (0): i actually gagged when this started

**CritneySpearz** (0): I hope I never have to sit through that song again

**Jexan13** (0): i'm a boomer now, i will listen exclusively to dad rock

**MasterWizardRyan** (0): How did this manage to get here?!

**rickikardashian** (0): man, I never really heard more than "watch me whip, watch me nae nae", I can't believe y'all had to hear this on the radio, tonight I'll be praying for all the affected people

**TiltControls** (0): I'm glad we've left this behind in 2015

**ExtraEater** (6): Fun fact - This was last place for almost the whole rate until the very last day when it swapped places with Watch Me. It kinda deserves last place. This song is devoid of, well, anything. But at the very least, it‚Äôs not terrible

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Haha fuck you!!!!!!!!!!!11111

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): Fuck You Maroon 5. You suck.

---

**gannade** (10): cardi slayed

**palengard389** (10): PSA: the non Cardi version is better

**TiltControls** (10): I wouldn't be surprised if I'm the only 10 on this song, but it's actually really good

**DrunkHurricane** (9): not even nearly as bad as everyone makes it out to be

**Tolk1en** (9): honestly very overhated. Cardi B verse fits perfectly. The music video is also very cute.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I‚Äôve just heard this song so many times over the last year or two. For some reason I can kind of tolerate and like it now, but boy does Maroon 5 really aggravate me.

**CritneySpearz** (7): it's not that bad please be nice popheads omfg...

**poppinmmolly** (7): this one is okay but I'm gonna say...Maroon 5 have overstayed their welcome by about 5 years.

**starlightzone** (7): ugh. I actually like maroon 5 I just don‚Äôt like this song. Cardi is good but Cardi is pretty much always good. I need them to just do Songs about Jane again and then break up.

**Roxieloxie** (6.8): Maroon 5 either have a year with a really catchy top 40 hit or a really bad one, i guess compared to memories this isnt terrible

**1998tweety** (6): Cardi tried to save it but this is just too bland. Again, it's not incredibly awful but it's also more of background music. IDGAF what anyone else says, "I play with my kitty like you play with your guitar" is iconic af.

**bambamhenny** (6): cardi saved it

**ignitethephoenix** (6): It‚Äôs catchy but man I am sick of this song. Added a point for Cardi‚Äôs verse though

**fadedblue09** (5.8): Honestly the hate for this is overblown. Mediocre, but I‚Äôd rather hear this than those party music from 2011.

**rhyneston3** (5): Not their best but the video was super cool

**rslashpoopheads** (5): We really let this be the fifth biggest song of the decade.

**slimboyfriend** (5): I'm shocked to hear a guitar in a Maroon 5 song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): i don't particularly mind the song but it is more boring than most songs this huge.

**timothy444** (5): Boo

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): this is a song that actively wants you to not notice that it exists while it quietly plays in the background

**GiftoftheGeek** (4): Can't believe soccer moms felt this song so hard with lyrics like "I play with this kitty like you play with your guitar"

**ReallyCreative** (4): I like Cardi's verse but literally why the fuck is it set to this elevator music, how do people listen to this

**vayyiqra** (4): I had a bad feeling about this song because I don't like either of the artists who made this, and I was right. The instrumental is okay, but I don't like Cardi's voice at all. It irks me.

**\_\_Avaritia** (3): So generic it makes Ed Sheeran look like Charli XCX, would've been mediocre sanitary pop if not for Cardi's baffling verse (like that guitar-kitty line) and it clashes with the mood hard

**worlds-okayest666** (3): this is boring as fuck and Cardi‚Äôs verse adds NOTHING to it, to the point I don‚Äôt even understand why she was added on

**InternetDude19** (2.8): Boring

**ComeOnPupperfish** (2.3): (#88) Calling this the white version of 'Nice for What' is more offensive than anything Maroon 5 has released in the past 3 years.

**bulforster** (2): Mind-numbing garbage

**starla\_** (2): vanilla as fuck

**static\_int\_husp** (2): Adam Levine is giving about 20% effort the whole song. Cardi gives a okay showing, but it's not really worth it to save this song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): When I saw this song title for the first time I thought it was going to be about Adam Levine trying to cheer someone up by telling them that girls are into them. That alternate reality version of this song would have been so much better than what we got

**untutorable** (2): this is boring as shit

**vapourlomo** (2): *falls asleep*

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): i don‚Äôt know how i managed to not hear this song before everyone was complaining about it being everywhere? I guess it never caught on as much in the uk or i just avoided it. anyway yeah i hate it

**rickikardashian** (1.5): I already despised this song enough without the lyrics, but I decided to look up what he was saying and shit, it's infuriating how bad they are, I hate it

**alwayswords** (1): words cant describe how much i despise this song

**anothertown** (1): It is just nothing

**bandnitos** (1): a zero contender

**bespectacIed** (1): The absolute worst, soulless, blandest song ever. Those regurgitated lyrics and melodies are what caused global warming, wars, and world hunger. I hate this song, I hate post-2007 Maroon 5, \*jack antonoff voice\* I HATE IT!!!!

**camerinian** (1): ‚ÄúHEY MAN I‚ÄôM PRETTY TIRED CAN WE JUST CALL IT A DAY?‚Äù ‚ÄúUH, ADAM, WE‚ÄôVE ONLY DONE HALF OF THE VERSE TAKES. THERE‚ÄôS STILL LIKE A FULL FOUR BARS FOR EACH REFRAIN THAT WE HAVEN‚ÄôT DONE YET‚Äù ‚ÄúYEAH, BUT THAT INSTRUMENTAL RECORDING REALLY KNACKERED ME,  I THINK WE JUST PICK IT UP LATER‚Äù ‚ÄúDUDE WE ONLY GOT THAT ACOUSTIC LOOP RECORDED TODAY AND THE LABEL WANT THE SONG IN THE MORNING, WHAT DO YOU MEAN PICK IT UP LATER?‚Äù ‚ÄúMAN IDK JUST GET THE RAPPER OF THE MONTH TO FLESH IT OUT‚Äù ‚ÄúBUT THE SONG‚ÄôS NOT ABOUT ANYTHING, ADAM. IT‚ÄôS GONNA MAKE THEM LOOK REALLY DESPERATE‚Äù ‚ÄúUH OH SORRY BUD I‚ÄôM ALREADY GOING TO THE ELLEN STUDIO FOR PROMO BYEEEEEEEEEEEEEE‚Äù

**emuu1** (1): why do americans like this

**Entire-Reflection** (1): can we please go back to Songs about Jane now?

**hikkaru** (1): not even cardi can add any charisma or... anything interesting to maybe the most vanilla song on this list. i'll take any other maroon 5 song over this

**kappyko** (1): popheads' hate of this is unearned imo but it sucks a lot

**ManofOranges** (1): I am... disgusted.

**MasterWizardRyan** (1): üëé

**megm26** (1): why is this song so high the gp has no taste i hate it here

**nightjesus** (1): I hate soccer mums. And I hate that Maroon 5 know their audience so well. I need another messy bop like ‚ÄòThis Summer‚Äô from them this decade. I need them to take a risk. I do love a Cardi B verse but this one ain‚Äôt it. ‚ÄòPlay with this kitty like you do your guitar‚Äô is not a line this song deserves.

**PointlessBibliophage** (1): i'm glad i'm not a girl so no guy will ever sing this to me

**Popfan2489** (1): one of Cardi‚Äôs worst verses paired with one of the worst bands to date. The song says nothing and is so boring

**runaway3212** (1): What a time to be alive... where this song still somehow became a hit.

**steelstepladder** (1): More like Girls like poo

**stickywheels46** (1): No.

**themagicwemade** (1): no.

**waluigiest** (1): wtf so many of these top songs suck maybe I‚Äôm not a pophead

**wavingwolves** (1): fuck this song what's this even about

**Xanleth** (1): I despise this song

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): maroon 5 has like two good songs from this entire decade. girls like you is not one of those, it makes me want to rip my eardrums out upon hearing 2 seconds of it.

**FrankBedbroken** (0): now this on the other hand, this is complete nothing as a song, it's just the most lacking piece of music i've ever heard in a while, and i cannot for the life of me understand why someone likes this, there's nothing to hold onto other than levine's miserably boring vocals and plucky synths, a complete non-entity in song form

**GarlicEnthusiast** (0): not sorry about it

**skargardin** (0): BYE

**TragicKingdom1** (0): a sonic vortex into the shadow realm

**ExtraEater** (10): This is a huge bop and all, but Get Lucky was ROBBED

**ImADudeDuh** (10): If you are triggered or disgusted by this song, I understand, and I don‚Äôt want to make you feel bad. But, I believe this song is a massive bop and is obviously gonna be the bottom 10, so I don‚Äôt feel too bad about giving it a 10 for my own opinion.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): fucking disgusting.

---

**1998tweety** (10): It's messy but it's just so damn catchy.

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Corny (and problematic upon laser close inspection) lyrics aside, smooth and charismatic and versatile vocals and almost timeless groovy Pharrell production steal show

**alwayswords** (9): :iamlookingaway:

**poppinmmolly** (8): a problematic bop. I'm sorry, but it bops.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): i get the controversy but even after all these years, i still think the song slaps. sorry.

**Jexan13** (7.5): We all know this ain't getting too far on this rate, but... sonically, it's actually a bop and a half. Good thing I am a dumb latino and I struggle undertanding lyrics.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): ignoring the lyrics this song is pretty solid

**rickikardashian** (7): Did y'all notice Pharrell going "WOO!" throughout the entire track? I also didn't, until someone pointed it out, and now I can't unhear it

**vapourlomo** (7): The creepy lyrics are a 5, the funky beat is a 10 ‚Äî let's say it's a 7?

**FKJVMMP** (6): Yeah it‚Äôs gross, but *that groove though*.

**GiftoftheGeek** (6): I really wish this wasn't a bop because the lyrics are awful but...

**rslashpoopheads** (6): I'll compromise on how great and awful this song is and give it a 6.

**survivorthrowaway5** (6): there's a reason this smashed worldwide

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): even putting aside the issues with the lyrics here, this song isn‚Äôt a standout from the Pharrell renaissance or from the pile of mid-decade hits with a throwback sound

**ignitethephoenix** (5): God this song is so problematic but damn it‚Äôs so catchy. So that‚Äôs why it gets a 5 because if you don‚Äôt listen to the lyrics and think about the downfall of robin thicke‚Äôs music career and everything that entailed, it‚Äôs a bop

**InternetDude19** (5): Questionable at best lyrics hold back a good instrumental.

**ManofOranges** (5): I absolutely love the way this song sounds but I am not really a fan of the lyrics so I decided to split the difference.

**rhyneston3** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr51afj7eJY&list=PLjh69hOiTaK9zzththUjsqjab5vKyxGb1

**timothy444** (5): Aagh, the beat and song is so catchy and funky but the lyrics‚Ä¶ aw man, they're problematic. I already feel guilty for giving this a positive score but the instrumental and melody are amazing. If Blurred Lines had completely different lyrics and title, that weren't pertaining to rape, then this would get a 10. In other words, I'd rather listen to the instrumental.

**Popfan2489** (4): great production but super rapey

**runaway3212** (4): It's catchy, but it's also bad.

**megm26** (3.2): according to genius it‚Äôs about rejection but the lyrics are still really iffy. i like the production so i‚Äôll still give it some points.

**camerinian** (3): ughhhh fuck the funkiness of this track

**Hogwartsreject1912** (3): Lyrics ruin it.

**TragicKingdom1** (3): gets exponentially worse with each listen

**ulikejazz** (3): so problematic but.. a lil bit good?

**vayyiqra** (3): Ugh, I don't really want to get into The Discourse about this song. We all know it's creepy and Robin Thicke is a douche. Aside from the awful lyrics, it's kind of catchy, but also annoying. At least Pharrell regrets making it, so we can uncancel him. The best thing about it is the video, really, which bizarrely enough was directed by a woman and was intended to be empowering for the women in it. I guess it deserves a few points for trying.

**anothertown** (2): Lol.. Not surprising that TI was on this song considering what he said about his daughter‚Äôs hymen

**Entire-Reflection** (2): I‚Äôd five it a 1 or a 0 but I gave it 2 pity points for the fact it was sued for no reason

**kappyko** (2): even pre-cancellation this is just so ugly to listen to and one of pharrell's worst

**slimboyfriend** (2): musically the song is fine, but the lyrics are so awful that I can't pay attention to anything else

**starlightzone** (2): the ONLY reason this doesn‚Äôt get my 0 is because the beat is good but that‚Äôs it do not make me rate this ever again.

**steelstepladder** (2): More like burred limes. Who wants to eat a lime they can barely see? No one that's who.

**stickywheels46** (2): Rapiest song of the decade

**Tolk1en** (2): A horror movie, let's forget it

**wavingwolves** (2): the music video and the lyrics are really disgusting but i can't lie the actual music bops quite a bit

**MrMoodle** (1.5): The production and vibe of this song is great, but it doesn‚Äôt matter how catchy it is if the only thing I can think about while listening to it is how rapey it all is.

**Awkward\_King** (1): no thankyou

**bandnitos** (1): barely escaped getting a zero

**bespectacIed** (1): obvious first out but something else deserves my 0

**CritneySpearz** (1): this song makes me more uncomfortable than I remember...

**fadedblue09** (1): This song already got more attention than warranted, and it‚Äôs actually a mess?? Moving on...

**FrankBedbroken** (1): in terms of morals it's abhorrent, in terms of musicianship it's boring

**hikkaru** (1): disgustang

**MasterWizardRyan** (1): üëé

**nightjesus** (1): no.

**ReallyCreative** (1): wow that was so fucking stupid

**Roxieloxie** (1): i hate that the beat of this is so fucking good on this trashy as song. I was 12 and i remember this was one of my first glaring examples of how women are sexualized in the media and it was a mess. Word Crimes by Weird AL is the superior version of this song

**skargardin** (1): Bye

**starla\_** (1): DISGUSTANG. Marvin Gaye remains unbothered

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): bad

**themagicwemade** (1): if i had a second zero this would be it

**untutorable** (1): honestly the worst lyrics here are "i feel so lucky / you wanna hug me / what rhymes with hug me"

**waluigiest** (1): disk horse

**Xanleth** (1): I could and still do hate this though. What a disgusting song.

**bambamhenny** (0): we do not support these lyrics

**bbfan132** (0): people disregard the vile lyrics and call this a bop but it‚Äôs just a shitty marvin gaye ripoff‚Ä¶. seek taste

**bulforster** (0): DASCOSTANG

**ComeOnPupperfish** (0): (#100) This is a 0 for many reasons, but I think the one that encapsulates it most is Pharrell saying, I kid you not, the song was meant to EMPOWER women. Let that sit in.

**PointlessBibliophage** (0): words cannot describe how i feel about this song, but "ew" comes pretty close.

**rosesmp3** (0): brb i feel like i have to go take a shower now

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Sure, it was 2013 when this song came out, but I'm still amazed we thought this was fine to put on the radio

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (0): there is nothing likeable about this song, and the lyrics are so fucking disgusting.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5.5): I actually don‚Äôt hate this song, but I completely understand why everyone else does.

**ExtraEater** (5): I remember hearing the Zedd remix of this quite a bit back then

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Who likes this song? Legitimately, I have no idea who the audience is for a cod reggae Canadian song about asking the father for permission to date his daughter only for him to say no, only for him to date her anyway.

---

**nightjesus** (10): I DON‚ÄôT UNDERSTAND WHY YOU ALL HATE THIS SONG SO MUCH. Like all I hear is a solid bop. What do y‚Äôall hear?

**Jexan13** (9): this isn't bad. A bit cringy but... don't care hehe

**anothertown** (8): Shut the hell up and don‚Äôt look at me because this is good

**bambamhenny** (8): if thsi was the PMJ version I would have given a 10

**yourfacesucksass** (7.7): A one hit wonder. I can‚Äôt tell if this song annoys me or not.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): I unironically like this.

**starlightzone** (7.5): I don‚Äôt know how I feel about this song at all. It‚Äôs a bit of a weird song, but I‚Äôm down for it.

**Roxieloxie** (7): throwback to the time we were waiting outside the sony story in new york waiting for the wheelchair friendly cab to come and i heard the chorus of this song every 60 seconds

**runaway3212** (7): I know this song is not good, but at a lot of good times in my life for some reason this song was playing, so I still like it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): yall are rude for hating this song so much

**rickikardashian** (6.6): this was straight up the first song I heard the lyrics and went "....yeah they're shit"

**1998tweety** (6.5): Well. Tbh the first time I heard this I selectively interpreted it as a gay bop but that doesn't really work huh. Some of the lines here are quite yikes but it does kind of bop.

**ggal2020** (6.5): I‚Äôve never understood the hate for this song, it‚Äôs a cute little bop

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I actually don‚Äôt hate this song as much as everyone else here. Although in further listens, it gets funnier each time I hear it (which is probably not the intention)

**waluigiest** (6): ok but I really liked this song when it came out I burnt it onto a CD for my car

**FKJVMMP** (5): I want to hate this a lot more than I do. Very glad they never had another hit though, I‚Äôm certain it would have been awful.

**kappyko** (5): i miss this song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): i actually didn't mind this song when it was out, but listening to it now... it's not very good is it?

**bespectacIed** (3): Lyrically awful but it's a bop ig

**steelstepladder** (3): This song is overhated. It's still obviously not good but it's not the worst thing in the world. There are many, MANY worse songs in this rate

**Xanleth** (3): It‚Äôs not good.

**\_\_Avaritia** (2.5): Ruined raggae for the rest of my life, horrendously annoying chorus, lyrics feel even worse than Blurred Lines' except without any charisma in vocals and worse production

**FrankBedbroken** (2): whites doing reggae, nuff said

**NotnotaMotmot** (2): This might be the whiniest song ever made. It's exhausting.

**rhyneston3** (2): This guy was definitely bullied as a kid for legitimate reasons

**skargardin** (2): Thank god that they never took of, this song is just atrocious

**bandnitos** (1): we love zero contenders

**camerinian** (1): hahahhahhahhahahHHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#99) I thought this was the worst it got. I had this as my 0 early on. Then, I remembered Blurred Lines was in this.

**fadedblue09** (1): Some songs in this list just make Maroon 5 sound bearable.

**hikkaru** (1): ew

**InternetDude19** (1): Strong contender for my zero.

**ManofOranges** (1): This song is abhorrent. It's boring. There's nothing redeeming about it. It has about as good of a reason to exist and cockroaches.

**RandomHypnotica** (1): ugh this song is so annoying, gross and blegh

**ReallyCreative** (1): everything about this song is infuriating, from the outdated gender roles, to the croning annoying vocals, the title is apt because making someone listen to it is rude to the point of offense

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): when even naps hates your music...

**timothy444** (1): It's still terrible and I hate this song with a passion. It's whiny, pretentious and it comes to no-one's surprise that this is their only hit song. I guess the general public must've realised their mistake of letting RUDE! play for so long.

**vapourlomo** (1): Ban white-boy reggae

**vayyiqra** (1): WHY YOU GOTTA BE SO WUDE [...] MAWWY THAT GUHLL Fuck off, this song is so annoying and an embarrassment to my country. The only artist who should be allowed to make white reggae is The Police, and only because they were really, really talented and also never tried to pretend they weren't white as shit.

**wavingwolves** (1): well this is definitely a song that exists

**worlds-okayest666** (1): this song is horrible and I will NEVER understand how it was such a big hit

**Hogwartsreject1912** (0): Booooo

**palengard389** (0): HAHAHA this is an obnoxious mess of a song. Everything about it is just terrible especially his voice

**poppinmmolly** (0): I hate this song soooo much. The concept. The sound. The principle. The way he whines. Who the fuck cares if the dad doesn't approve it isn't 1930.

**themagicwemade** (0): the fact this got my zero over blurred lines says enough. i hate this song. it's exponentially worse because i live in hawaii so this was exactly the kind of shitty reggae song that just. never. stops. getting. played. i hate this song.

**untutorable** (0): i hate this song it plays all the time at my job i hate it here!!!!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (0): This is by far the worst #1 of the entire decade. An insult to popular music, it‚Äôs like a Bart Baker parody but ‚Äúunironically‚Äù. The video is gross and the jokes aren‚Äôt funny. The beat just pounds the same riff into your brain and I have no idea why anyone would like it.

---

**kappyko** (10): honestly this being on the list at all is surprising

**poppinmmolly** (10): this just reminds me of my freshman year of college. This blasted at every single party I went to that year.

**starlightzone** (9.5): I can‚Äôt fault how fun this song is and how much I love it. I just want to dance to it and I don‚Äôt even care. I‚Äôll give it a 9.5 because of the goddamn entertainment value.

**bloupp** (9): I love this song and I ain't afraid to show it

**ignitethephoenix** (8): The song is so stupid but it‚Äôs just so ridiculous and catchy so I can‚Äôt hate on it too much.

**vapourlomo** (8): I WORK OUT!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Kinda slaps but not as much as Party Rock Anthem and the lyrics are cheesy in a pretty bad way

**hikkaru** (7.5): the production slaps idc, the lyrics suck though. party rock anthem outsold wbk

**DrunkHurricane** (7): I go back and forth between absolutely hating this and bopping to it ironically

**Roxieloxie** (7): whatever i said for party rock anthem applies here too

**rslashpoopheads** (7): Cannot believe this was as big as it was but it's certainly catchy

**timothy444** (7): "Wait, Calvin gave this a higher score than Adele's Someone Like You?" yes I did what ya gonna do about it nerd

**rickikardashian** (6.3): you know how they say that where there's good there has to be evil? Party Rock Anthem is the good, and this is the evil

**bambamhenny** (6): not as good as party rock

**camerinian** (6): I am a juvenile piece of shit, and I absolutely will get my wiggle on and there's nothing you can do to stop me

**vayyiqra** (6): Yeah no. I will defend LMFAO and argue that *Party Rock* is a good album, and I even gave "Party Rock Anthem" a good score, but this isn't one of their better songs. I appreciate how dumb the video is and its satirical value, but it's also annoying. Which was clearly the point because it's definitely one of their most trollish songs, and that's saying a lot, but I still don't really like it.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): wigglewigglewigglewiggle

**1998tweety** (5): I have an irrational hatred for this song cause it was big when I was in 6th(?) grade and all the popular kids would sing it all the time and it made me mildly uncomfortable. Besides that, it's just kind of meh.

**bandnitos** (5): where are the party rockers i miss them

**nightjesus** (5): Oh yeah this also exists. I didn‚Äôt like dicks in the old budgie smuggler in the video clip but I guess it‚Äôs a creative choice.

**Jexan13** (4): I remember listening to this in the middle of high school with my best friend and laughing together with the disturbing video. Now that friend is many kilometers away thanks to this fucking shithole of a country. Ahem, thanks to those nice memories + breakdown, I won't give this a 3.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): surely one of the worst things to happen to america. but catchy.

**Tolk1en** (3): everything's wrong with this.

**waluigiest** (3): I forgot about the wiggle bridge and I took a few points off

**jackisboredtoday** (2.5): this song is something darksided and the kind of 2012 humor that‚Äôs aged terribly today

**Xanleth** (2): slightly better than their song up above but still garbage.

**bespectacIed** (1): war crime

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#98) No.

**CritneySpearz** (1): All I can think of when I hear this song is the 13 year old kid who sang this for his audition on X-Factor and it makes me incredibly uncomfortable.  How did that ever get approved omg..

**fadedblue09** (1): I‚Äôve had enough of these meme songs.

**FrankBedbroken** (1): worse than party rock anthem in every respect and even more painfully unfunny

**ManofOranges** (1): Deranged, psychotic, demonic, mind control.

**palengard389** (1): LMFAO is lucky Rude exists

**RandomHypnotica** (1): do i need to explain this score

**runaway3212** (1): The song is atrocious, but the video is the true crime.

**skargardin** (1): Trashy in all of the wrong ways, thank god that the LMFAO plague is long since over

**steelstepladder** (1): More like sexy? and I say no. It's not.

**wavingwolves** (1): i think this is even worse than rock bottom anthem or whatever that song is called

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1): how were they ever popular

**1000\_nights** (0): Wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle wiggle yeah

**InternetDude19** (0): How did we ever let this happen?

**megm26** (0): why did we, as a society, let this song get successful at all? it‚Äôs objectively terrible, it‚Äôs not funny, it literally has zero redeeming qualities.

**ExtraEater** (10): This song and its popularity plays out as if Bebe Rexha wished for a major hit from the monkey‚Äôs paw. I think there was even a comment about that somewhere on /r/popheads. Also, Dude's comment right below me forgot about the bangers known as "Cruise" and "Cruise (Remix)"

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Florida Georgia Line legitimately has more good songs than Bebe Rexha does. FGL has songs like Dirt, Simple, Round Here, and Confession.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): Need You Now‚Äôs evil little sister.

---

**letsallpoo** (10): if you gave this less than a 10 you are NOT a true rexhar or bad bitch

**ManofOranges** (10): I know this song is going to get eviscerated but I unironically love this song. There was a time in my junior year high school where I was absolutely in love with a straight guy that was in my anatomy and physiology class. The degree to which I was infatuated was honestly probably unhealthy, and it didn't help that he and I were almost always lab partners so I just got more and more attached. Eventually the semester ended and I had an utter breakdown over the fact that he's never going to be in a class of mine again and I'd never get the chance to live out my already impossible dreams because I'd never see him or speak to him again. Turns out though, that he and I would leave school the same way everyday, and so for those two minutes at the end of every day, I would literally be so elated. Then we would part ways again. And so, later in the afternoon, I would play this song on repeat as a sort of catharsis and hope--hope that one day, this relationship between me and him that I fabricated was actually meant to be and that it would, indeed be.

**starlightzone** (8.5): I think this slow song works really well for both of them and hits them both in the right ways.

**1998tweety** (8): It's alright, not my fav song ever but some of y'all will act like its the most annoying thing ever.

**rhyneston3** (8): Florida Georgia Line‚Äôs features are always so much better than their actual songs

**Roxieloxie** (8): every time a white person tells me that OTR isnt country enough i direct to them to this song

**rickikardashian** (7.2): feet aren't pretty

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.7): cheap

**bandnitos** (6): add this to the list of how did this become a hit

**bespectacIed** (6): I  hate country but this kinda slaps??? Mostly because of mother rexhar being the bad bitch that she is. But seriously, bebe's vocals are amazing it makes me forget this is borderline trap bro-country

**Hogwartsreject1912** (6): I only know this song because it gets played CONSTANTLY on the radio at the Duane Reade where I work and idk I think that means something.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): bebe is a country kween, Rexhars and perverts put your paws up

**skargardin** (6): Crossover queen

**bambamhenny** (5): *cringe*

**InternetDude19** (5): Bebe deserves better than these two dorks.

**Jexan13** (5): Oh my god this is so sonically bland, goddamn it

**slimboyfriend** (4): literally who has Bebe Rexha been all this time

**vayyiqra** (4): Bebe's voice is very nice ~~and also so is her [REDACTED]~~ but this song isn't good. The hook is strong, but the country and trap don't mesh together well (this was my problem with "Old Town Road" earlier). The end result is so mediocre.

**jackisboredtoday** (3.1): who is this song for?? it‚Äôs got such a weak hook, nothing interesting lyrical, i don‚Äôt understand how this caught anyone‚Äôs attention or why anyone would willingly choose to listen to it

**brodiepp** (3): don‚Äôt hate bebe but hate this country florida individual

**ReallyCreative** (3): absolutely cringetastic lyrics, some decent vocal harmonies on the chorus but overall extremely frustrating to listen to

**rslashpoopheads** (3): bye

**waluigiest** (3): zero sauce

**worlds-okayest666** (3): as a Bebe defender it pains me to give this such a low score but oh WOW this is bad (and to be honest, i think a lot of this is FGL‚Äôs fault)

**anothertown** (2): the descending piano line sounds like shit with the vocal in the chorus, who approved this? lol

**camerinian** (2): I really hope that Old Town Road has finally put a bullet in this shitty pop country crossover that isn't good at either pop or country

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Can‚Äôt wait for Bebe Rexha to ruin every music genre.

**\_\_Avaritia** (1): Atrocious, vomit-inducing chorus, FGL is just rancid on any song they're on and smother Bebe throughout

**Awkward\_King** (1): why the fuck? why the fuck does this song exist, why the fuck is it on the top 100? what? this is also somehow the first bebe rexha song i‚Äôve heard

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#92) I said 'Need You Now' barely counts as a country song, but it's 10x the country song this is.

**CreepyMannequin** (1): I love Bebe but this ain‚Äôt it

**hikkaru** (1): this is so boring...

**megm26** (1): i absolutely cannot stand this song. the members of florida georgia line have some of the most grating and annoying voices i‚Äôve ever heard, and imo bebe is better but still not that good. the lyrics aren‚Äôt that great, the 2nd verse has bebe talking about how she‚Äôs kinda afraid to open up to a new man and fgl just talks about how she‚Äôs beautiful. the rest of the song is just ‚Äúhow many different ways can we say if it‚Äôs meant to be it‚Äôll be?‚Äù the production isn‚Äôt anything special either.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): i'm not sure who asked for a Bebe Rexha FGL collab. and while Bebe's voice usually annoys me a lot, here she just sounds... meh. FGL is just FGL. this is a really boring song that gives me semantic satiation, and for some reason it feels like each line of the chorus was cut in half and left with an incomplete melody.

**runaway3212** (1): I dislike this song.

**steelstepladder** (1): More like it's Meant to Be that this get's out day one of the rate

**stickywheels46** (1): This song is NOT meant to be

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): the fact that this spent 50 weeks at number 1 on the country charts..tastelessness

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): literally every sound florida georgia line release from their mouths makes me want to die.

**timothy444** (1): Want to know how good a Bebe Rexha song is? The higher it charts, the more likely the song sucks

**Xanleth** (1): I really hope not.

**GiftoftheGeek** (0): If it's meant to beeee I'll turn the radio off

**nightjesus** (0): This is like fucking nails on a chalk board. This was meant to by my zero.

**ExtraEater** (9): I was there when this song was first released. Like, I was on /r/popheads, it was midnight on January 6, and I witnessed the [FRESH] posts for it come out. I was on plug.dj and someone (I think /u/frogaranman in his old account) played it. It bopped and it still does today. Good times

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): fuck y‚Äôall this song is a banger idc.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Is Shape of You the worst song ever? No. Was it given that label many times in 2018? Fuck yeah. Shape of You is one of the most basic songs of the 2010s. However, many people give the ‚ÄúIf I can‚Äôt find anything memorable about it, it‚Äôs worse than being memorably bad!‚Äù excuse for calling it the worst song. But, this song isn‚Äôt unmemorable, it has catchy parts ~~that were stolen from other songs~~ and some of the lyrics definitely stick in the mind. Idk, it‚Äôs definitely not good, but it‚Äôs not irredeemable and not even the worst Ed Sheeran song in this rate.

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): this song is good y'all are just haters!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): THIS SONG IS UNIRONICALLY A BOP. This album is actually really good and i associate it with semester 10th grade which was a very messy/sad time for me. I heard this album playing over the speaker at a store at the mall and on a whim decided to buy it because "its ed sheeran why not" im sorry the rest of yall are heterophobic and cant appreciate this bop, but i can and will continue boping

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): if this wasn‚Äôt sung by Ed Sheeran I 100% know y‚Äôall wouldn‚Äôt be hating on this.

**Tolk1en** (9): I'm not a fan of the lyrics and the music video, but overall I love the melodies, and Ed Sheeran's vocals.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (8): I guess I‚Äôll be the first to say this is actually a pretty good song

**palengard389** (8): It‚Äôs a little boring but the beat is perfect

**starlightzone** (8): I‚Äôm trying not to be harsh on this because it‚Äôs fun but on the other hand it‚Äôs not‚Ä¶ exactly a great representation of the decade. It gets a safe 8.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): i get that this is the most overplayed song of all time but it feels weird to hold that against it in a rate where essentially every song is overplayed. i think it's pretty good fun catchy pop and i'm happy for ed.

**1998tweety** (7): Y'all are gonna drag this but it bops a bit. It's not my fav song ever but it's also not awful.

**bambamhenny** (7): listen, I know he's the red devil BUT please check out broadway bares performance to this song

**rhyneston3** (7): Overplay has killed this again, but it still bangs

**skargardin** (7): Radio fodder, but good radio fodder

**Xanleth** (7): Good song.

**fadedblue09** (6.7): Overplayed? Yeah. Awful? Maybe, but this list puts it in the decent tier tbh.

**CritneySpearz** (6.5): it's not AS bad as misandry-heads makes it seem

**InternetDude19** (6.4): I never hated it.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I remember that I liked this better the first time i heard it

**survivorthrowaway5** (5.5): stormzy and major lazer remixes are great

**bloupp** (5): Better that I remembered, but that's not saying much.

**MasterWizardRyan** (5): It‚Äôs okay

**nightjesus** (5): I was going to give this a lower score as I didn‚Äôt like it when it came out, but I actually didn‚Äôt mind singing along to it. I don‚Äôt even listen to Ed Sheehan. I have no Ed Sheehan songs saved on my Spotify. His power is scary.

**Popfan2489** (5): so boring

**rosesmp3** (5): sia did it better

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i never thought id be defending ed sheeren but...this is overhated

**themagicwemade** (5): this was good the first time i heard it and it was downhill from there

**vapourlomo** (5): Not nearly as awful as some make it out to be, but it sure is mediocre! Also lol @ referencing Van Morrison in what's meant to be a club single

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Generic as hell, the synth melody and dancehall vibe are annoying and everything is just passable pop music

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4): (#81) Todd dunking on this song is still one of my favorite segments ever, and Ed fully deserves every minute of it.

**TiltControls** (4): castle on the hill deserved better

**untutorable** (4): very heterosexual song i just can't vibe with it

**waluigiest** (4): this is really bad and it was overplayed but I do like the marimba a little bit

**worlds-okayest666** (4): This is like...kinda overhated? But it‚Äôs still not very good

**yourfacesucksass** (4): I will pay someone to delete this song from Earth‚Äôs history

**hikkaru** (3): it's catchy but in like the rebecca black friday way where it's shit but it won't GET OUT OF YOUR HEAD ! not surprised this is one of the biggest songs ever, just disappointed

**RandomHypnotica** (3): i honestly can't explain why i don't like this song so much, it just feels wrong to me

**rickikardashian** (3): I didn't even realize how much I hate this song until I noticed how irritated i got the literal second this started playing

**selegend** (3): i mean it‚Äôs ok but also like aggressively ok

**vayyiqra** (3): I know Popheads hates Ed Sheeran so much it's practically a meme, but I really don't like this song. It's catchy, but the lyrics are a little cringe, and that trop-pop rhythm gets old very fast.

**bulforster** (2.5): Absolutely not. He really wrote this weak ass song for Rihanna??

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): A very irritating song but in spite of its ridiculous overplay, it is marginally better than the other Ed tracks on this rate

**alwayswords** (2): :killmetwice:

**FKJVMMP** (2): It‚Äôs not quite the atrocity it used to be now that the trends it was riding so blatantly have died, but Ed still sounds like a 12 year old bullshitting to his friends about all the sexy sex he sexes.

**megm26** (1.2): i distinctly remember going to a restaurant the summer this was big and at the bar next door some random middle aged man was doing some horrible ed sheeran karaoke and it was terrible and that memory makes this song even worst

**camerinian** (1): i can‚Äôt listen to any fucking trop pop songs anymore because this greasy shit decided to use the most basic-ass vanila formula for it and croon about how much sex he has over the top of it. I used to actually like Ed‚Äôs music, but this is the most fast food track he ever made, and not even decent fast food. It‚Äôs one of those shitty special burgers that Burger King always pump out where it‚Äôs like zesty chicken or some shit but the chicken is some basic unseasoned grilled shit and it‚Äôs slathered in that rank fucking sweet chilli/tomato ketchup combo they put on all their fucking ‚Äòspecial‚Äô burgers because they realise that the public is too suckered in by the marketing to notice that it‚Äôs just a variation on their last shit but with the same disgusting sauce and flaky thin lettuce they put on everything. Where was I going with this? IDK fuck you Burger King

**FrankBedbroken** (1): ughhhhhhhh this is so fucking white

**ManofOranges** (1): Fun fact, for a spanish project I had to compare and contrast two songs, one english and one spanish. This song was one of them, as it was just getting popular at the time and I just felt like it was an easy choice, and the other song was Shakira's "d√≥nde est√°s coraz√≥n" I would just like to say Shakira sweetie I am so sorry that I, in any way shape of form, compared you to Ed Sheeran.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): this song isn't just generic and annoying, the production is pretty disturbing in a bad way

**rslashpoopheads** (1): I genuinely don't understand what the appeal of this is.

**starla\_** (1): this song has no redeeming features

**static\_int\_husp** (1): This is one of the blandest contemporary R&B songs ever pushed to radio and I will die mad that Castle On The Hill got left in the dust by this

**steelstepladder** (1): More like shape of poo

**timothy444** (1): Disgusting even for an Ed Sheeran song.

**Awkward\_King** (0): it just it‚Äôs not *just* that i hate ed i just hate this song it makes me angry to hear grrr stop it

**bandnitos** (0): PERIOD!!!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (0): worst song in existence

**emuu1** (0): lit rally discosteng

**runaway3212** (0): God what a terrible song, I feel insulted eveytime I hear and I've heard it wayy too often.

**wavingwolves** (0): i kind of liked this song once upon a time but now that it was overplayed for a whole fucking year by straight people and now i really can't listen to even a second of it

**ExtraEater** (9): I really like Thinking Out Loud, but it took time to get this one because it‚Äôs just straight up not on the same (high) level as TOL. Ultimately, it‚Äôs good, but most of the time I‚Äôll turn to TOL for enjoyment instead

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): I like this song. It‚Äôs a re-tread of Thinking Out loud, but it‚Äôs cute!

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Hot take: This is worse than Shape of You. Much more bland and flavorless than SoY, and Ed has literally done this song much better and named it Thinking Out Loud. Shape Of You was bad, but it was interesting. It had weird lyrics and Ed trying to do sex good. Perfect is just a boring ballad.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Okay I know y'all hate Ed but this song is so damn good. Gets me in my feelings every time.

**poppinmmolly** (10): SO CUTE. Y'all just hate love.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song is on a spotify playlist of mine titled, songs that make me crave affection

**timothy444** (10): A heartwarming ballad that I'm still not sick of. Thinking Out Loud 2.0

**palengard389** (9): This song is beautiful I don‚Äôt get this sub

**MasterWizardRyan** (8.5): One of Ed‚Äôs best songs

**starlightzone** (8.5): UGH am I a basic person? Yes. That‚Äôs not related to me giving this an 8.5. IT‚ÄôS GOOD OKAY leave me the fuck alone I‚Äôm not made of stone.

**runaway3212** (8): A song that I hate to love, it's just so bad, but I can't help to love it anyway.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): i get why people would hate this song, especially after the radio didn't stop playing it for like a year straight, but... it is still a beautiful, simple, and enjoyable love/wedding song.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): maybe this is biased because this is better than every other single ed released in the past 3 years, but perfect is actually quite sweet and enjoyable

**1000\_nights** (7): Thinking Out Loud, but good

**ignitethephoenix** (7): you know what, at least Shape is You is catchy. This song while cute and has wedding dance potential is more of a bore, especially without Beyonce on this version. And it also tried too hard to be Thinking Out Loud.

**themagicwemade** (7): i think this song is cute until i imagine ed sheeran singing it and then it loses all romanticism

**fadedblue09** (6.8): I‚Äôm surprised this turned out to be a big hit, but I don‚Äôt mind it.

**megm26** (6.2): this actually isn‚Äôt that bad

**Xanleth** (6): It‚Äôs fine.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.2): (#71) It would be a 6.5 if it was the Bey remix.

**bambamhenny** (5): also inescapable as fuck

**bulforster** (5): Not really bad, just boring

**GiftoftheGeek** (5): Happy for you, Ed, but I'm bored

**Popfan2489** (5): such a generic song

**rhyneston3** (5): Thinking Out Loud‚Äôs uglier, dumber sister

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): a song alright

**waluigiest** (5): I think Ed Sheeran is like Taylor Swift, but even more heterosexual. I understand the appeal but this is not for me

**rslashpoopheads** (4): k

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): Thinking Out Loud stripped away of any personality or romance, okay sentiment but just the epitome of bland/boring

**hikkaru** (3): yawn

**ManofOranges** (3): Snooze fest.

**nightjesus** (3): yet another plain white bread love song from Ed.

**skargardin** (3): Divide had some good radio fodder, and then there's completely  banal songs such as this

**static\_int\_husp** (3): "Song that only exists to be used for a slow dance at a wedding" is a bad genre, and Ed has two of them on this list!

**vayyiqra** (3): This song is far from perfect. Ballads aren't all bad, but cheesy ones like this are. Just listen to "Wonderful Tonight" by Eric Clapton, which is this but better.

**camerinian** (2): I have never listened to this song all the way through, and I'm really hoping I can keep it that way for as long as I live, but I know deep down once my straight friends start getting married I'm going to be an eternal prisoner of this song. Fuck you Ed

**ReallyCreative** (2): this song is just... boring. nothing really happens it feels like a carbon copy wedding song with no heart or substance. Anyway, a reminder that Ed Sheeran goes multiple days without changing his underwear, just to ruin your day~

**starla\_** (2): Heterosexuality in a nutshell

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): i really really promise i don‚Äôt want to hate ed sheeran as much as i do i like some men‚Äôs music just god i hate this. Even if it was the beyonce version it‚Äôd still only be like a 4

**anothertown** (1): can we please kill all cishets and abolish marriage already

**bandnitos** (1): a zero contender . i really cannot stand this ginger man like this isn't out of spite i seriously hate this song

**bespectacIed** (1): I wish Ed didn't find the love

**bloupp** (1): I literally can't get through this it's just too boring

**CritneySpearz** (1): when I think of straight culture, this is it

**emuu1** (1): ew

**kappyko** (1): the worst of ed sheeran ballads. X era had so many good ones, and supermarket flowers is pretty - this is nothing at all

**racloves** (1): would be higher if it was the version with bey

**steelstepladder** (1): Perfect, more like Adolf Hitler (who was very far from perfect)

**Tedyonce** (1): I can handle shape of you but this one is unforgivable

**vapourlomo** (1): Dear lord this song is boring as hell

**hunnybee12** (0): i have a personal gripe with this song it geniunely makes me want to crawl out of my own skin

**ExtraEater** (10): Polite, relaxing jam

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Why do people like calling this a flop and that no one remembers it? Can‚Äôt you do that shit to something like Panda or Stay With Me?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): the most useless #1 of the entire 2010s.

**FKJVMMP** (9): I know it‚Äôs terrible and OMI sounds like a moron, but goddamn it makes me feel happy to be alive.

**starlightzone** (9): ITS SUCH A FEEL GOOD SONG. Oh my god this is just so happy I‚Äôm glad he found a cheerleader. I‚ÄôM SO HAPPY HE FOUND LOVE.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): OMI's singing is kinda weird but production carries hard especially when the chorus kicks in, pretty romantic lyrics

**camerinian** (8): this is still a fucking cute bop ok, no one expected this to be a hit just let them have this

**runaway3212** (8): This song weirdly works for me. I really like it.

**starla\_** (8): im the wizard of love and i got the magic wand

**rickikardashian** (7.5): this song sounds like musical.ly (Rest In Power)

**1998tweety** (7): Not sure how I feel about this, it bops a bit but I'm also not a fan of the lyrics or the vocals.

**megm26** (7): i know popheads hates this song but i think it‚Äôs fun little bop!

**wavingwolves** (7): this is painfully corny but i like it

**bespectacIed** (6): The chorus slaps. The horns are catchy. OMI's voice is relaxing. WHY DO YALL HATE THIS SONG SO MUCH??? I don't get it. Racism i think.

**rhyneston3** (6): It‚Äôs aight

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): ok i know this song is not good but it went offff that one summer.

**timothy444** (6): Maybe I'm giving this too high of a score but I really love Robin Schulz's work so‚Ä¶ yea

**bambamhenny** (5): what are you even doing here

**bandnitos** (5): i always forget that this song exists

**ManofOranges** (5): There's nothing to say for this one. I don't hate it like I've seen others hate it, but it's not that good.

**nightjesus** (5): This track is all over the place with the auto tune oof.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): idk why yall get so fired up about this song its the most inoffensive song i can possibly imagine

**bulforster** (4.5): This is such a non-committal love song lmao. "Do you feel like cheating", "No, not really"?? And that sax solo is slapped on so haphazardly, effort level non-existent.

**fadedblue09** (4): This is honestly another meme song, but eh, I don‚Äôt mind it.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): im sick im SICK

**skargardin** (4): Trop pop done wrong

**CritneySpearz** (1.1): who made this famous...

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#90) I want to hate this song more, but it's so... nothing. It's not a trainwreck, it's a boat very slowly crashing into an iceberg, and there is nothing you can do about it.

**palengard389** (1): Oh I remember this

**ReallyCreative** (1): these lyrics were literally written by a kindergard\tner

**TiltControls** (1): I don't mind the production, but the vocals are just not great

**vayyiqra** (1): *fOund mysElf a cheeeerlEEEEEadurrrrr* Fuck off, this song is almost as bad as that terrible Magic song. It's so cheesy and annoying, and I hate the dude's voice. Kill it with fire.

**Xanleth** (1): This would get my Zero if Drake didn‚Äôt exist.

**alwayswords** (0): I HATE IT HERE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (0): god Omi's voice is sooooooooo annoying he sounds like he's trying to do a weird indie girl voice but also mocking it at the same time. Not to mention the instrumental sounds so basic ugh

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Messy. It‚Äôs a song that says ‚Äúyour size doesn‚Äôt matter! :) boys want to fuck fat girls too! :)))‚Äù and I just know there‚Äôs gonna 3 comments that are gonna be like 200+ words long to try to defend it.

#Does Dude hate /u/1998tweety? Discuss

**1998tweety** (10): I am so so so so SO tired of people sighting this as a skinny-shaming song. Does Meghan Trainor have problematic songs? Yes, Dear Future Husband is a great example of one; but is All About That Bass one of those? Absolutely not. The lyric is literally playing on the trope of fat girls being resentful of skinny girls who call themselves fat. Meghan plays into that trope for a second and then immediately says no we're not gonna do that, we're all perfect regardless of our size. I seriously can't tell if people just choose to take this line out of its context to attack Meghan or if they genuinely don't understand the point Meghan is trying to make. Oh well, at least we can all agree it bops.

#Bass

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): QUEEN OF POP MEGHAN TRAINOR

**fadedblue09** (9.3): Another song that will get unfairly trashed because of its singer and admittedly problematic lyrics. Which is sad, it has a more unique charm than most of the female-sung songs in this list.

**Jexan13** (9): teen dumb me thought she just loved asses. I mean, same, but why the pink cute aesthetic

**worlds-okayest666** (9): ‚Äúdeath to skinny bitches‚Äù - Meghan Trainor, 2015

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Corny? Yes. Bop? Yes.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): I appreciate it more now than when it came out. I despised it at first.

**bambamhenny** (8): i actually loved this song a lot when it came out, love the vintage style

**ignitethephoenix** (8): It‚Äôs a cute song but it‚Äôs definitely a little passive aggressive.

**ggal2020** (7): aged like milk

**palengard389** (7): I listened to this for the first time in years and was pleasantly surprised

**skargardin** (7): Overhated methinks

**starlightzone** (7): I‚Äôm not going to stay on this too long because Meghan didn‚Äôt stay in this era long either. She had such a dip before coming back up and doing somewhat decently.

**wavingwolves** (7): nothing to hate on here!

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.7): people forget how catchy this is, controversy aside

#Treble

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.5): i'm more of a treble person sorry

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it has not aged gracefully but it's not bad I just would like to listen to something else

**alwayswords** (6): im glad meghan is past this stage in career :teeheehee:

**anothertown** (6): the ONLY thing that made this song successful was the doo wop arrangement and honestly? It holds up.

**ManofOranges** (6): I don't hate this song nor do I love this song. It's pretty middle of the road.

**megm26** (6): some of the lyrics are :/ but the production is fun and i like her voice

**vayyiqra** (6): This is a hard one to rate. I never really liked it, although it's catchy. It feels like a swing and a miss both musically and lyrically. I guess it had good intentions overall, but there's just something annoying about it.

**waluigiest** (6): so maybe a step back for both feminism and the fat acceptance movement..... but a tiny bit of a bop

**GiftoftheGeek** (5): "I'm bringing booty back!" "Booty never left, that statement is trash!"

**Roxieloxie** (5): this is tempo by lizzo for white women

**slimboyfriend** (5): blaccent, anyone?

**bulforster** (4): It may be a choice but her voice is aggravatingly nasal at some points.

**DrunkHurricane** (4): going to give it a few points for at least sounding good but fuck this song's message

**rhyneston3** (4): Thank god she started releasing good music after this

**static\_int\_husp** (4): I remember hearing this for the first time before it blew up on radio. I thought it was okay and she had potential. Boy, has that opinion changed a lot since then

**timothy444** (4): Meghan has definitely improved over the years but her first single wasn't it. All About That Bass is uninteresting at best and embarassingly tacky to be singing those lyrics. It's hypocritical considering the articles about her behaviour after the song came out (e.g. she tried anorexia). When reviewing these kind of songs, I try to seperate the artist from the song but in this instance, just knowing that history in Meghan makes me a little sick. The message in the song is great, but yeah, a bit hypocritical.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (3.5): (#84) I am too scared to give any takes on this song other than 'this is very bad'.

**\_\_Avaritia** (3): Annoying vocals and even more annoying hook ruin decent production and well-intentioned lyrics

**FrankBedbroken** (3): i don't think it's horrendous but i wouldn't mind if i never heard it again

**hikkaru** (3): not that this was good when it was a hit but man this aged

**nightjesus** (3): I want to say firstly that the hate this girl gets is unjustifiable. That said I‚Äôve never liked this song. It‚Äôs super boring.

**runaway3212** (3): Never got why this was a hit, I thin Meghan has made some good songs, but this is not one of them.

**steelstepladder** (3): Meghan Trainor's new album debuted at number 29 this week and I guess that means we all regret this

**themagicwemade** (3): at least it's not dear future husband

**Xanleth** (3): It‚Äôs not the worst thing ever but I‚Äôm still not a fan.

**camerinian** (2): why did we let this happen

**FKJVMMP** (2): I kind of appreciate it for being such a wasteland of stupidity and ignorance that it caused enough self-reflection to almost end a particularly toxic brand of social media social awareness.

**bandnitos** (1): i am biased against this song bc she dismissed eating disorders after its reception which pissed me off like saying that you "tried" to be anorexic isn't something you say its fucking brutal

**bespectacIed** (1): I will never forgive America for forever ghetto-izing black women expressing their sexuality but when ONE white woman sang about her big ass, it was propelled to number 1 for multiple weeks

**InternetDude19** (1): Meghan calling her butt "boom boom" gives me life.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (1): this song already sucked to begin with and it's so fucking oversaturated in every way, i'm not sure how it didn't get my zero

**Popfan2489** (1): not sure what message this song was trying to send, but it ended up being a weird skinny shaming anthem

**starla\_** (1): i do not care what kind of booty boys like, sorry meghan

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): stan lizzo

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (0): one of the worst songs ever made.

**vapourlomo** (0): Yiiiiikes I forgot about this one. What a toxic mix of painful corniness, retrograde production and body shaming.

**ExtraEater** (10): That bridge is fantastic. Even if the lyrics are cheesy, I think Charlie and Wiz are actually being genuine here.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Have y‚Äôall ever listened to a radio station so white that they cut out Wiz Khalifa 100% from his own song??? It fucking shook me when it happened and I think that was the first I discovered racism in the wild.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): I don‚Äôt ever want to hear this song again, but it‚Äôs not *bad*. One of the most overplayed songs in existence, I swear.

---

**poppinmmolly** (10): one time I passed by a funeral procession while this was playing on the radio and I teared up a little bit okay? Any song that provokes an emotional response out of my cold, robot heart gets a 10.

**timothy444** (10): Sure, it was made for one of the longest movie franchises but it doesn't discredit the fact that it's a Paul Walker rememberance tribute song. Such a shame that the Fast & Furious series didn't end at 7 because this felt like the perfect song to end the movies. Still, it's heartbreaking to hear this after losing someone close to you and I guess it hits lots of people in the feels.

**MasterWizardRyan** (9): Beautiful song

**Roxieloxie** (9): I associate this song with alot of bitersweet feelings, im still not sure how i feel about it

**Jexan13** (8.5): i haven't seen a single F&F movie, but this gets me sentimental

**megm26** (8.5): :(

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): I hate hate hate hate HATE Charlie Puth's wispy ass cardiac arrest singing but this song gives me the warm fuzzies.

**starlightzone** (8.5): OKAY I don‚Äôt really love every rap and pop collab but I REALLY like this. I think Charlie does something for this song that makes Wiz really shine which I appreciate. Note: are the fast and furious movies worth watching?

**1998tweety** (8): Overhated. It's alright.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Charlie‚Äôs part >> Wiz .

**rhyneston3** (8): I just recently watched Furious 7 and that bumped this up a couple points RIP king Paul Walker

**bambamhenny** (7): not particularly impressive

**nightjesus** (7): This song has actually grown on me a lot over the years. Probably thanks to my growing respect for Charlie Puth and his talent. Also the Kobe Bryant tribute they did with it stripped back was beautiful.

**vayyiqra** (7): HE GON' SKRRT THEN HIT THAT DAB LIKE WIZ KHALIFA Sorry, I have the meme rate on my mind. Like most of Popheads I don't really like ballads, but I will be nice because Charlie has a nice voice.

**bulforster** (6.5): What is Wiz Khalifa doing on a song like this lmao

**bandnitos** (6): charlie puth pisses me off

**skargardin** (6): It's ok

**Xanleth** (6): Dem Feels.

**fadedblue09** (5.6): The rap and the chorus are so disjointed that I‚Äôm surprised it turned out to be a huge hit tbh.

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Charlie's chorus, piano chords, and overall lyrics are sentimental and gorgeous, the rest is mediocre

**InternetDude19** (5): I actually enjoy Wiz's verses, but I don't like this song. It sucks that Paul Walker died, but was he really this big of star to sustain this enormous hit? I've always felt weird about it.

**FrankBedbroken** (4): sad white frat boy music

**kappyko** (4): charlie puths part in this is better than wiz khalifas sorry for having the worst take i could possibly have on this song

**selegend** (4): this would work as a solo charlie puth song tbh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): wiz khalifa is mid and charlie puth's biggest hit on the hot 100 would have been at #73 if paul walker hadn't died.

**vapourlomo** (4): Sorry Paul Walker ‚Äî this tune doesn't do it for me

**bespectacIed** (3): rip paul walker, but I can't stand this song

**ComeOnPupperfish** (3): (#85) The Fast and the Furious franchise can choke.

**CritneySpearz** (3): just not good.

**jval888** (3): song is just wailing I can't stand it

**runaway3212** (3): no

**slimboyfriend** (3): Imagine dying and having this awful song dedicated to you

**themagicwemade** (3): i live in hawaii so i have to hear a reggae remix of this song every so often and i think it's made me hate the original by association

**hikkaru** (2): adult contemporary rap songs... i hate it there

**ManofOranges** (2): I have a bone to pick with this song because I genuinely do not understand why people like it so much. Do people really care about the fast and furious movies? Did they ever? To me I didn't know a single person who cared about the movies and then this song comes out and everyone's hopping on the bandwagon or something? I don't know... Maybe people just like the sentimentality and use it to cope or something? In that case, find a better song, this one sucks.

**steelstepladder** (2): Damn who knew? More like your score is a two.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): i feel no emotions from this song whatsoever

**waluigiest** (2): lifeless nonsense

**ggal2020** (1): I absolutely cannot figure this song out, it‚Äôs just so bland and sterile I don‚Äôt understand how people cry to it??

**RandomHypnotica** (1): This song is soooooo boring, and it just feels like deathbait

**ReallyCreative** (1): the introduction is the most obnoxious combination of noises I think I've ever experienced

**ulikejazz** (1): sns this song is trash

**wavingwolves** (1): i'm very sorry to announce i hate this song. it may be the most overplayed song on this list for me (and it still plays so much on the radio here, i fucking hate it)

**FKJVMMP** (0): Charlie Puth is unbelievably boring when he doesn‚Äôt have a sweet bass line behind him, Wiz Khalifa is a useless moron and I can‚Äôt ever take a cash in this soulless seriously at all. Absolute disgrace of a song and I still can‚Äôt believe anybody ever found anything good to say about it. Feel like I‚Äôm taking crazy pills whenever I hear somebody talk about it like it‚Äôs anything other than an embarrassment to the concept of sad music. A man actually died and Wiz Khalifa‚Äôs talking about taking ‚Äúdifferent paths‚Äù, how am I supposed to feel anything other than kind of gross about the terrible human beings who put this atrocity together.

**vapourlomo** (8.5): *whispers* I think this song is adorable and I really don't get the intense hate. The weird lyrics are charming!

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Rubbish lyrics and basic as hell chords... but still slaps, sounds sweet and cheery enough to be enjoyable the whole ride through

**ggal2020** (8): When I was little I thought this song was from the 70s or something

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): my dad met the singer of train at a baseball game once but instead of calling him by his name he just called him train. just a fun fact i thought yall might like to know

**Xanleth** (7): I like Train and their weird Train-isms.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I have a soft spot for early Train so I‚Äôm kinda happy they kept making hits, but this isn‚Äôt anything special

**alwayswords** (6): ‚Äúlike a virgin youre madonna‚Äù

**bespectacIed** (6): Idg the hate? Is it the gangsta line? Yeah they're not the best band out there and this song doesn't make sense but this kinda slaps? Train released Drops of Jupiter (one of the best songs ever) so I forgive them for this basic granola white guy in white tshirt brown fedora with a ukulele concoction

**GiftoftheGeek** (6): Inoffensive music made for Walmarts and grocery stores everywhere

**RandomHypnotica** (6): this song isn't THAT bad, but overplay really hurt it

**vayyiqra** (6): If this were any cheesier it'd be fondue, except unlike Train, cheese is good

**wavingwolves** (6): hot take: this is just a aggressively okay song. it's definitely overhated, train has much worse songs than this. still, i have no idea what this song is about

**fadedblue09** (5.4): Would‚Äôve been tolerable if it weren‚Äôt for those awful lyrics.

**bulforster** (5.2): Some of these lyrics are repulsive, but if you don't really pay attention it sounds okay enough.

**hikkaru** (5): i don't have a burning hatred for this like other people but it's very mid

**MasterWizardRyan** (5): Love-hate relationship with this song

**rhyneston3** (5): I miss Drops of Jupiter train

**timothy444** (5): Bland enough to not even be worthy of a bad or good score.

**rickikardashian** (4): i don't like this trend of ruining songs I enjoyed before knowing English well enough to understand how bad they were

**runaway3212** (4): The more I hear this song, the less I like it.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): we really let this man say so gangster im so thug and went along with it

**Awkward\_King** (3): people who think being able to play train on a ukulele is a personality trait

**kappyko** (3): it's hardly the worst song ever made imo. sucks ofc and surprisingly so but there's been more offensive shit pumped out of the white man sensitivity machine

**ManofOranges** (3): Ugh, enough!

**1000\_nights** (2): Train lol

**camerinian** (2): I am remarkably flaccid

**InternetDude19** (2): Can you be this inoffensively bad?

**slimboyfriend** (2): nefarious

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (2): yeah i'd be completely fine with this not existing.

**bandnitos** (1): this was a very strong zero contender

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#91) NO! Get your ukeleles OUT!

**CritneySpearz** (1): str8s must be defeated

**FrankBedbroken** (1): auditive gentrification

**ReallyCreative** (1): compare Drops of Jupiter to this... my heart hurts

**ignitethephoenix** (0): this song makes my blood boil. It‚Äôs so annoying. Ukulele and slightly gross lyrics are a bad combo. Fuck this song.

**letsallpoo** (0): flames... flames, on the sides of my face, breathing...breathless...heaping breaths... heaping-

**steelstepladder** (0): First is the Worst, second is the best, Train is the one with the hairy chest

**waluigiest** (0): this shit‚Äôs anti-black and I‚Äôm not going to explain myself

**ExtraEater** (10): Major bop

**ImADudeDuh** (7): My life got 10x better when I just accepted that this is just trying to be a fun dance anthem for a Dreamworks movie and it‚Äôs not trying to be anything more.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): Overhated IMO. It‚Äôs just a fun song for a kid‚Äôs movie.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Funky, dancey, immaculate production with the resonating piano chords, more authentically joyous than Happy, Justin's singing is charismatic as ever

**DrunkHurricane** (10): fun, catchy, upbeat and overhated

**Jexan13** (10): in an alterante timeline this would be sung by... idk, Gaga, and /r/popheads would make this win

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is my dad's favorite JT song.

**1998tweety** (9): Bop.

**fadedblue09** (9): Yeah, sure, it‚Äôs cheesy and annoying but that pre-chorus is addictive enough to redeem it entirely.

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's really hard to believe these gem of a song was used for the Trolls movie of all things but whatever, a fun bop!

**rhyneston3** (9): So catchy and fun, just really puts you in a good mood

**bulforster** (8.5): Between this and that SZA song JT x Trolls is apparently the collab that gives us the bops we deserve from him, stan Trolls!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): overplayed but not as annoying as I remember

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Vanilla but fun.

**TiltControls** (8): very generic, but still good

**vayyiqra** (8): I hate that I like this song and I didn't even know it was by JT and it was for a fucking children's movie called *Trolls*. But whatever. I am going to be fair to it because I know Popheads hates JT and the rest of you won't. Again, Daft Punk did retro better last decade, but this is a very catchy and well-produced song.

**starlightzone** (7.5): WHY DID NOTHING FROM THE 20/20 COLLECTION GET AS BIG AS THIS SONG that album deserves a second chance.

**hikkaru** (7): cute

**InternetDude19** (7): I still like it. Timberlake salvages it.

**runaway3212** (7): I don't really like this song, but it's very fun.

**timothy444** (7): Ain't bad for a generic pop song but ugh, Justin Timberlake, you can do a LOT better!

**vapourlomo** (7): Not bad, as far as JT's dad era goes

**waluigiest** (7): This song just wants to be Happy by Pharrell. That being said it‚Äôs a lot better than I remember

**yourfacesucksass** (6.5): I liked it at the beginning, but after hearing it 500 times on the radio, in Trolls ads, on the Oscars, and still on the radio, I can truly hear how fucking unnecessary this song is.

**steelstepladder** (6): More like I can't stop feeling like this is good but not great

**wavingwolves** (6): this is fun but what trolls is even about

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.5): (#69) Nice.

**anothertown** (5): this song makes me think about when I was young (id say 14-20) and thought pop music couldn‚Äôt get any better than Justin Timberlake. Fuck dude

**themagicwemade** (5): why was a song from the trolls soundtrack allowed to get so popular

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): stream "the other side" instead.

**FrankBedbroken** (4): everything that can go wrong with the nudisco revival shit

**ManofOranges** (4): Another overplayed and grating song.

**skargardin** (3): No

**nightjesus** (2): I want to stop the feeling of listening to this song.

**Roxieloxie** (2): this movie wasnt bad but i cant say the same for this song

**Awhile2** (1): trolls arent as cute as minions

**bandnitos** (1): raw unfiltered rage i almost gave this my zero

**bespectacIed** (1): unbearably bad

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): we had to play this song in high school orchestra in sophomore year and it was so traumatic for me ive hated this song ever since

**ExtraEater** (10): It‚Äôs really hard to forgive this song for blocking Gangnam Style from #1, but it‚Äôs a bop so it‚Äôs a little bit forgiven

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Probably one of Max Martin‚Äôs worst songs. I always felt the hook of Adam Levine going ‚Äúniiiiiiiiight, tiiiiiiiiiiiiimes‚Äù etc at the end of each line was just a poor idea on paper, let alone in execution. Add in the fact that this is not really noteworthy among Maroon 5‚Äôs other radio filler of the past decade, this song just is not good.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): This song kept Gangnam Style from hitting #1. Fuck you Maroon 5, You Suck.

---

**CritneySpearz** (10): Everyone says Maroon 5 is trash post ‚ÄúSongs About Jane‚Äù but they definitely made some bops including this #1 hit which is hard to get not everyone has that

**palengard389** (10): Call me a Maroon 5 fan but this is just so fun

**rhyneston3** (10): This is unironically my second favourite Maroon 5 song (after Wake up Call)

**starla\_** (10): this song is my secret maroon 5 shame, it‚Äôs a banger

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I‚Äôve have always liked this maroon 5 song, so I can‚Äôt hate.

**themagicwemade** (9): confession i actually love overexposed era maroon 5

**1998tweety** (8): It's a bop, I don't like it as much as I used to but it's still a bop.

**runaway3212** (8): Yes I know Maroon 5 is very bad, but idk the song just makes me release dopamine.

**starlightzone** (8): Is it bad this album is hitting me as hard as Songs About Jane with the art and style? Seriously, this song is way better than the rest of their music this decade.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): one of their better hits.

**waluigiest** (8): Maroon 5‚Äôs decline was gradual and irregular, and this is kind of a neat bop

**Awhile2** (7): wow a marron 5 song this decade with an actual bass part u love to see it

**bambamhenny** (7): this song was better in my memory

**bloupp** (7): Infinitely better than their recent output, although that's not saying much

**Jexan13** (7): i listened to this ONCE and it got stuck in my head for an entire day. I'll give you that

**poppinmmolly** (7): an alright song

**Roxieloxie** (7): is payphone in this rate?, i wish payphone was in this rate

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I always felt like giving this song to a bubblegum pop girl would have made me like it much more, like imagine if Britney had the ‚Äúooohs‚Äù in the post-chorus and it sounds so much better already

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.1): overhated

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): (#61) Bland Maroon 5 song.

**timothy444** (6): Criminally overrated.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): omg how many more maroon 5 songs am I gonna have to listen to in this rate

**alwayswords** (5): the autotune is so excessive

**hikkaru** (5): i have not heard this since 2012

**MasterWizardRyan** (5): Okay

**ReallyCreative** (5): almost a good song but ultimately mediocre

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Another song I don't wanna revisit.

**vayyiqra** (4.5): I like the instrumental track enough, but I would like this a lot more if someone sang it whose voice I like, i.e. not Adam Levine.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): maybe I just avoided it through my sheer hatred of marron 5 post-2005 but I've literally never heard this song in my life before and it's this high on the list?

**skargardin** (4): How in the WORLD was this song big enough to make the decade end list?

**\_\_Avaritia** (3.5): Kinda boring... okay chorus but shit verses and whistling melody, just forgettable overall

**InternetDude19** (3.5): Maroon 5 should have gotten all the hate we directed toward Imagine Dragons.

**selegend** (3): at least it‚Äôs not animals i guess?

**Xanleth** (3): It‚Äôs not good.

**rickikardashian** (2.5): it is catchy as hell, but I hate the wooOOO

**vapourlomo** (2): Still hate this song for blocking Gangnam Style from #1

**1000\_nights** (1): It's a tough competition, but this is probably the worst Maroon 5 hit

**bandnitos** (1): this is for gangnam style

**bespectacIed** (1): the most forgettable number 1 song ever

**camerinian** (1): who likes this. Like, moreso than most milquetoast Maroon 5 songs, who went out of their way to think "Hmm, yes, today I will listen to nasal ass white guy reggae about how good he sexes yes very good I love human music"

**ManofOranges** (1): Please stop immediately.

**nightjesus** (1): oh god they‚Äôre so boring. How do they have so many songs omg this list? Its like eating a plain rice cracker. Bland and dry.

**Popfan2489** (1): I just can‚Äôt remember it

**steelstepladder** (1): More like One More Night I have to hear this and I'll kill myself

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): blocked gangnam style from #1 which automatically makes me hate it

**wavingwolves** (1): why

**muchopartymuchomoney** (0): the worst Maroon 5 song ever released, except for maybe Memories

**ExtraEater** (10): ‚ÄúThe song was nominated for Best Original Song at the 86th Academy Awards on March 2, 2014, but lost to ‚ÄòLet It Go‚Äô from Frozen. When GQ magazine asked Williams ‚Äòhow badly‚Äô he wanted the Oscar, he responded: ‚ÄòWhen they read the results, my face was... frozen. But then I thought about it, and I just decided just to... let it go.‚Äô‚Äù If you think this song is bad (and it‚Äôs not), just read that again for something worse.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): It‚Äôs fine.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I get it. It‚Äôs a song for feeling happy, but THIS is probably my biggest example of overplay killing a song. I wasn‚Äôt to fond of it to begin with, but after a 14 week long run at number 1, I really never wanted to hear this again until 2019. It‚Äôs still not good, but at least I don‚Äôt have a rage against it anymore.

---

**Roxieloxie** (9): is this song kinda annoying, yes, but i have alot of cute nostalgia for it

**starlightzone** (9): Pop music doesn‚Äôt need to be boring or basic, it can absolutely be a fun joy ride with some good feelings involved. Who needs pop ballads when you have music videos with minions dancing?

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): It's easy to hate this song but it is such a good pop song. I love the harmonizing ladies in the background of the post-chorus

**skargardin** (8): Overhated idc

**waluigiest** (8): feel pity for the sad people who irrational hate this song

**Xanleth** (8): Very upbeat and nice song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.9): (#39) 'Like a room without a roof' is a big mood, but not in the way he intended.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Victim of over-saturation but otherwise groovy production and Pharrell's vocals are good

**bulforster** (7.5): This is perfectly fine and nothing more.

**DrunkHurricane** (7.5): gets old way too quick

**megm26** (7.4): fun fact: when i first heard this song i thought it was by ceelo green

**Awhile2** (7): honestly only like this song because of the minions. theyre so cute

**bambamhenny** (7): if it hadn't been overplayed, would have had a higher score

**fadedblue09** (7): Cute.

**GiftoftheGeek** (7): Overplayed, but unlike Girls Like You I completely understand why.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): It is meant for a kids movie so I can‚Äôt hate it for sounding like this, but it‚Äôs not my cup of tea.

**Tolk1en** (7): Generally speaking I find Pharell boring but this song brings some energy.

**wavingwolves** (7): honestly this is fun and not even overplay made me hate it

**rickikardashian** (6.7): I‚Äôm aware that the major reason I‚Äôm so annoyed by this is just over-play, but I would be less annoyed by it if it wasn‚Äôt the musical equivalent of a deep-fried Oreo dipped in white chocolate. Even in my happiest days, I‚Äôm not close to feeling how this song wants me to feel. I also hate how Pharrel acts like one of those [‚Äúim shy‚Äù memes](https://twitter.com/chynnabon/status/1236255732921556992) in the video

**Jexan13** (6.5): GET YOUR HAPPINESS AWAY FROM ME YOU CREEP

**yourfacesucksass** (6.5): Byeeee bitch, who‚Äôs happy now?!

**Entire-Reflection** (6): this song fails at making anyone above the age of 7 happy

**hunnybee12** (6): a room without a roof would not be happy it would be moldy

**ManofOranges** (6): Another cute song where overplay ruined it for me.

**starla\_** (6): i worked in a cinema when despicable me 2 came out and i got sick of this real fast

**timothy444** (6): Everyone forgot this was from the Despicable Me 2 movie, didn't they?

**camerinian** (5): yep, he sure is happy

**FKJVMMP** (5): Feels like it should be way more interesting than it is.

**FrankBedbroken** (5): it was fine back then but nowadays it's... just not it

**nightjesus** (5): I fucking hate minions. Their yellow faces fill me with rage. Again, another thing soccer middle aged mums have ruined.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): i mean, this song is exactly as titled. It's Happy. Nothing more and nothing less

**rosesmp3** (5): God I Wish I Could Relate

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Insipid from its inception.

**runaway3212** (5): The definition of too happy

**vayyiqra** (5): This song doesn't make me happy. Pharrell should stick to producing, because it's what he's best at. It's in that same "catchy, but kind of annoying, and ultimately not that good" category as many other songs in this rate.

**1998tweety** (4): Annoying.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): does not make me happy

**steelstepladder** (4): More like crappy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): does this song ever end

**vapourlomo** (4): Pharrell has made too many incredible beats for this corny nightmare to go down as his signature song

**palengard389** (3): Never understood the appeal

**rhyneston3** (3): Catchy, but so annoying. Can‚Äôt Stop the feeling did it better

**themagicwemade** (3): i wish i felt whatever pharrell is feeling in this

**untutorable** (3): this is worse than i remember

**PointlessBibliophage** (2.5): so annoying

**alwayswords** (2): this song brings back traumatic middle school memories my teachers used this song for everything bc it‚Äôs pg and popular

**anothertown** (2): LEt‚Äôs abolish capitalism so talented musicians never have to make music for kids movies again

**Awkward\_King** (2): i‚Äôm sorry it‚Äôs just too overplayed. also i just can‚Äôt relate to the song tbh. STAN gru though

**bespectacIed** (2): so corny and insufferable. The only thing I love is the 4-beat intro

**CritneySpearz** (2): truly a tragic piece of pop music

**slimboyfriend** (2): mindlessly innocuous

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2): i fully removed this song‚Äôs existence from my memory

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1.5): unbelievable that pharrell released this but even more unbelievable that tyler the creator agreed to be in this video.

**bandnitos** (1): this song fills me with a potent rage

**hikkaru** (1): listen i like songs that try to be positive but this was annoying in 2014 and it's annoying now! I HATE IT HERE!

**MasterWizardRyan** (1): üëé

**worlds-okayest666** (1): this song is the reason why depression exists

**ExtraEater** (10): Look, I like a fair bit of their music and I don‚Äôt hate them at all, but I shudder at the thought of Maroon 5 crashing my wedding. That aside, this is a bop and I‚Äôm glad the newlyweds in the video enjoyed the party.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is such a bop. It‚Äôs not a deep song, but it‚Äôs great at what it wants to do, and it wants to make you sing along and just be happy for it‚Äôs runtime. And I respect that.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): It‚Äôs fine...useless but fine.

**CritneySpearz** (10): This song is also a bop, Maroon 5 haters better recognize

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is the last song I've LOVED from them.

**Roxieloxie** (10): this song isnt good but it has the power to make anyone who hears it come on the radio to start singing

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): For some reason this is one of the only maroon 5 songs popheads like. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs one of their best but I will give it a slightly higher rating than normal so that men can thrive a bit

**DrunkHurricane** (9): good but Katy Perry did it first

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Pretty timeless production, features one of Adam's best singing, pretty sweet (no pun intended) lyrics

**anothertown** (8): The best Maroon 5 song since This Love but yall aren‚Äôt ready for that conversation

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): (#46) The last good Maroon 5 song.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Honestly one of the best Maroon 5 songs in recent memory

**starlightzone** (7.5): I hate when Adam tries to hit high notes. I also hate when Maroon 5 tries to do something happier. I hate happiness. But it‚Äôs still fine. It‚Äôs not a garbage fire.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): lady gaga forced me to attend a maroon 5 concert (not clickbait!!!). so, hi guys, today i'm going to talk about the time when i attended a maroon 5 concert because gaga forced me to! so, okay, she was supposed to headline rock in rio in 2017 and so i bought tickets right when ticketing opened and prepared myself to see her after so many years. but, unfortunately, she couldn't actually perform because of her fibromyalgia, so, of course, the organizers put maroon 5, the headliner that would play on the next day, to replace her. the maroon 5 concert itself wasn't all that bad, but the most enjoyable song was definitely the last one: sugar. me and my friends actually hyped it and i have fun memories with it. this is the only maroon 5 song i'm giving a good score for that reason. anyway, if you liked this video, subscribe! and till next time!

**1998tweety** (7): Meh. I don't really like his vocals on the chorus so I was never a huge fan of this song, it's alright.

**ggal2020** (7): will I get hate if I say that this is the only Maroon 5 song I like?

**fadedblue09** (6.8): One of their more tolerable songs

**yourfacesucksass** (6.8): Such a bland song

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i still hate adam levine though

**bulforster** (6.5): Has Adam Levine's voice always been this bad?? This would be pretty good with a different singer.

**InternetDude19** (6.5): This is the only Maroon 5 song of the decade I like.

**bambamhenny** (6): maroon 5 said fuck marriage equality

**hikkaru** (6): cute... but just a bit too basic

**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): for a 2010s Maroon 5 song this isn't too bad

**waluigiest** (6): it doesn‚Äôt sound bad but oof the writing

**ManofOranges** (5): Why

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Why are all the bad Maroon 5 songs here?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): sugar‚Ä¶.no please

**timothy444** (5): Tip: If you're trying to make a completely safe and inoffensive single, go all the way. Don't just add the S word just to get that explicit tag on your song. It serves no purpose and feels like that line was put there for that sole purpose.

**vayyiqra** (5): Sugar, like this song, is just okay, white, and I get sick of it very quickly.

**camerinian** (4): no thanks

**rhyneston3** (4): I‚Äôd be pretty happy if Maroon 5 came to my wedding, but only if they didn‚Äôt play this song

**runaway3212** (4): The first terrible Maroon 5 song

**survivorthrowaway5** (4): sucks without nicki

**rickikardashian** (3): I still can't understand how Maroon 5 and Katy Perry made the same exact song, with the same exact video, and the public decided to choose the more obnoxious version to make insanely popular

**skargardin** (3): HOW many Maroon 5 songs are on this goddamn list?!

**themagicwemade** (3): this sugar is most definitely not sweet

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (3): this annoys me.

**kappyko** (2): i heard the falsetto in this and cried

**ReallyCreative** (2): who is telling Adam he can hit these notes, who is lying to him, who is telling him this is something anyone wants

**steelstepladder** (2): More like Sugar, no thanks

**bandnitos** (1): raw unfiltered rage

**bespectacIed** (1): one of the worst songs in existence

**dropthehammer11** (1): this is the only comment i'm going to leave on this rate to say that this song is total hot garbage and i dont know if maroon 5 can ever be redeemed for it

**FrankBedbroken** (1): this was a strong contender for the 0

**nightjesus** (1): why are there so many Maroon 5 songs oh my gooooooooooood. They‚Äôre ALL THE SAME.

**Xanleth** (1): I hate this one more than Girls Like You.

**ExtraEater** (9): If someone ever complains about a detestable radio hit that‚Äôs overplayed but I still like anyway (like Shape of You), I at least have this song to know what it‚Äôs like. I like it a fair bit, but I gotta be in the right mood. Marshmello‚Äôs synths have a terribly empty tone, whereas Bastille‚Äôs Dan Smith provides serviceable vocals at best

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I‚Äôm happy for the airtime Bastille got, but this song did not need to be the last big EDM song of the decade.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): Marshmello is the worst producer currently working. I kinda like the Bastille parts though.

---

**bambamhenny** (10): fuck y'all this song is a bop, also the MV has Miranda so it's practically a gay anthenm

**dlstantdreamer** (10): This duo was a match made in adult contemporary heaven (alongside Coldplay and Chainsmokers). This track took what was probably an already good track written by Bastille and dancified it so well.

**Roxieloxie** (10): First of all do the mens rate by the end of the month and give bastille your 11's. I have no idea why this of all bastille songs randomly blew up but im happy it did cause i've been stanning for a while and they have some good ass songs.

**timothy444** (10): Happier' is a song between two completely different artists in terms of genres and yet somehow, the way the song is presented and performed between them is a collaboration that feels eerily natural. It's bittersweet but in a way where you're relieved of the stressful relationship that this song is trying to get us to experience. It's soul crushing EDM and heartbreaking but it also inspires hope. Also it's a Marshmello song so y'all gonna rob it anyway from a better position when the reveal happens. Eff you for giving this masterpiece a 1

**TragicKingdom1** (10): prob my hottest take in this rate but this absolutely deserved to smash as hard as it did. something about dan's voice really meshes with the production

**palengard389** (9): EDM done right

**starlightzone** (9): It‚Äôs just a good song. The voice and beat is so smooth together.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): this officially makes bastille no longer a one-hit wonder and we have to celebrate that.

**1998tweety** (8): Idk his name but this man has such a nice voice. The rest of the song is alright.

**Awkward\_King** (8): i didn‚Äôt know this was as big of a song as it clearly was? woah that makes *me* happier

**hikkaru** (8): cute but how is this the 3rd biggest "edm" song on the list...

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I love the happy sounding sad lyric contrast, but Mashmello‚Äôs production is definitely not as good as Bastille‚Äôs part.

**rhyneston3** (8): I didn‚Äôt realize this was popular

**megm26** (7.3): unrelated to the song why is the version of this on the rate‚Äôs spotify playlist from now that‚Äôs what i call music! 69

**InternetDude19** (7): Marshmello tries his hardest to ruin this.

**vapourlomo** (7): One of the best examples of "bad artist, good song" (the bad artist is Marshmello, to be clear)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): Marshmello's production just feels sooooo weak. but Dan Smith

**alwayswords** (6): bastille‚Äôs singer has pipes

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6): (#63) Give Pompeii your 11s it deserves so much.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): well this is bittersweet. this song feels like it was made to piss me off specifically. when you get the best band ever to work with the worst EDM artist ever, the result is this mediocrity-fest. the lyrics are okay, but really lackluster for a Bastille song. the production is terrible, like in any Marshmello song, especially the drop. the only thing that saves this is Dan Smith's heavenly vocals. good for Bastille for getting a 2nd mehagit, though. shame it's also Marshmello's biggest. any other Marshmello hit would've been a 1 or even a 0, and Pompeii or pretty much any other Bastille song would've been an 11 contender.

**Xanleth** (6): Solid enough.

**rslashpoopheads** (5.5): I've never heard this before but the MV is so cute im crying

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Bastille's sort of sentimental but ultimately triumphant vocals carry the hell out of a mediocre Marshmello instrumental with bad horns

**bandnitos** (5): good for bastille but christ this is bland

**FKJVMMP** (5): I like Bastille but aside from Lewis Capaldi, Marshmello is by far the least talented person in mainstream music.

**poppinmmolly** (5): The pick of Bastille for this song is so odd to me. I don't think it worked

**steelstepladder** (5): More like sappier

**yourfacesucksass** (5): I just find this song so cringy. And the way the chorus is sung is just, no.

**fadedblue09** (4.6): This is Bastille‚Äôs biggest hit of the decade? Tragic.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): I've never heard this song before so how is it higher up than most of these songs

**camerinian** (4): how is this still the best Marshmello song and it's still barely ok

**ManofOranges** (4): Very generic and also, for a song called, happier, it doesn't really make me much happier, and I feel like that doesn't help the song's case.

**ReallyCreative** (4): the way this is literally Closer, this hurts as a Bastille fan

**runaway3212** (4): I dislike Marshmello's drops, they never really feel like drops.

**vayyiqra** (4): I had no idea what this was until the synth came in, and it was just okay throughout. There is such a thing as trying too hard, and this song is trying way too hard to be Bombastic Radio Anthem #39325.

**CritneySpearz** (3): the music video ruined the song for me because my cat died like a day before the mv dropped and now I associate this song with my cat dying :/

**skargardin** (3): It sure is a Marshmello song

**stickywheels46** (3): Good vocals, production ruins it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): Stream Doom Days

**MrMoodle** (2.4): Marshmello is a scourge on this planet

**bespectacIed** (2): The most dated song ever

**waluigiest** (2): I hate this honestly

**survivorthrowaway5** (1.5): lifeless

**FrankBedbroken** (1): the only reason this is not a zero is because i like the voice of the dude from bastille, i really really really really hate marshmello

**nightjesus** (1): oh god it feels like this decade has a lot of filler. This is the song I literally switched the radio station as I found this song so generic. Soz to people this offends plz don‚Äôt hate me.

**starla\_** (1): this was that popular? Who knew

**Tedyonce** (1): i can‚Äôt believe I was excited for this collab when it was announced

**TiltControls** (1): I usually really like Bastille but this does not work for either party

**Popfan2489** (0): marshmello sucks see Todd in the shadows review of him for my reasoning

MrSwearword: As someone who's new to the world of Dance Club Songs charts but a longtime EDM/Dance/Club/House music enthusiast, let me validate those of you who hate Marshmello.

Those beats are garbage and his shtick is a bootleg Daft Punk and Deadmau5 soaked in Kidz Bop.

**ExtraEater** (7): For those familiar with ‚ÄúJump in the CAAC‚Äù, a twisted remix of this was actually the second part of the original and was even the longer, more prevalent thing in its source. Despite that, the brief That's What I Like bit became the big famous part. The creator seems pretty bitter about that

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): this song is very forgettable but somehow I know every word? Crazy.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): This song has had negative staying power. Like this is Drake‚Äôs second biggest song of the decade, when Drake was arguably the biggest artist of the decade, yet this is like the 16th song I‚Äôd think of when I think of Drake songs. It‚Äôs probably the most ‚Äúdrake‚Äù song of his, but for all the worst reasons.

---

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): idk if that's what Drake was going for, but this song just has a "tired" vibe though it's still relaxing and that kind of song is exactly the kind of thing i needed in 2018. so thanks Drake.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is actually my favorite Drake song (I don't like many) so I'm glad this is also his highest on the list

**ignitethephoenix** (9): not my favourite Drake song but it‚Äôs boppy for sure

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): overplayed etc. but still a big banger.

**1998tweety** (8): Bop, background music bop but still a bop.

**Awhile2** (8): ofc drakes biggest hit to date would also be his most inoffensive

**rickikardashian** (8): the last possible evidence that there might be some heterosexuality left in me are my everlasting crush on Selena Gomez and the fact that I enjoyed this song way too much

**starla\_** (8): nice for what deserved

**Roxieloxie** (7): I like the vid for this song more than the actual song but, i do only love my bed and my mama im sorry

**waluigiest** (7): did anyone see that edit of AOC over this song

**anothertown** (6.5): https://vm.tiktok.com/VovcBS/

**bandnitos** (6): only fun for the bed and my mom part like there isn't a lot here

**hunnybee12** (6): the video is great but there's nothing interesting or memorable about the song at all

**rhyneston3** (6): I should not have rewatched Degrassi recently cause it‚Äôs making it pretty hard to take these Drake songs seriously

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Cute MV boring song.

**skargardin** (6): This really de-grew off me

**vayyiqra** (6): ["God's Plan" starts playing] I want to like this song, but the instrumental is so repetitive, and Drake sounds zoned out on it. It just feels low-effort. Memes aside, he can do better.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Besides the instrumental, there‚Äôs little to say about this.

**1000\_nights** (5): Is it possible to call a YE #1 forgotten already?

**bespectacIed** (5): Drake is so fucking corny. Bop tho

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): (#74) Manifest Destiny, ~~1700s, colorized.

**InternetDude19** (5): I still don't understand why this was a gargantuan hit. It's fine.

**nightjesus** (5): Gods plan was for me to put this at 5.

**starlightzone** (5): could god‚Äôs plan be for you not to rap like this ever again because I‚Äôd really fucking appreciate that shit THANKS.

**themagicwemade** (5): drake is the musical equivalent of khaki

**vapourlomo** (5): Not bad, but far from Drake's finest moment.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): ok but really this song was popular for like 6 months and then no one played it again

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Drake's not a great rapper, production is just blehhh, only noteworthy thing is the bed and momma line because same

**bloupp** (4): Besides a few quotable lines this isn't even close to Drake's best work

**hikkaru** (4): :verve:

**ReallyCreative** (4): Drake's voice drags on the ground like a toddler throwing a tantrum in a Denny's because their mom won't let them play the crane game

**camerinian** (3): historians are really gonna look back at 2018 in bewilderment that our Drake tolerance was so high that we let a piece of autopilot brag rap with no hook and maybe one memorable line tops become the biggest hit of the year

**FKJVMMP** (3): This is the kind of song that makes me think anybody could write a hit if they wanted to. There are worse songs out there but I don‚Äôt know if there‚Äôs anything that sounds like it requires less effort at every level.

**poppinmmolly** (3): nooooot a fan of this song at all

**steelstepladder** (3): Was it in God's Plan to suck?

**wavingwolves** (3): this is SO unremarkable that i had forgotten how it goes but the "my bed and my mom" line still SENDS me

**kappyko** (2): dire example of how drake has ruined the universe

**ManofOranges** (2): I do not love this song at all I'm sorry.

**runaway3212** (2): The 'my bed and mama' line is still beyond stupid

**timothy444** (1): He gave lots of money away in that music video but what I want him to give away are good lyrics from his mouth.

**Xanleth** (1): Of all Drake songs I find this the most annoying but it escapes my zero because he gave money away.

**runaway3212** (8): Drake is drake and it just works.

**vapourlomo** (8): KIIIIKI DO YOU LOVE ME

**vayyiqra** (8): This song is so chaotic. I know we've rated it before, and I said it's too messy then, with that one vocal sample being plain annoying. I like Drake's "___, do you love me?" hook though, and the beat does bop. I can see why it became a meme (other than that everything Drake puts out becomes a meme because he's so popular. The man himself is a meme, even). I can't quite decide what to rate it, but I think I like it. Also, I'm often in my feelings too, so I can relate. :pensive:

**yourfacesucksass** (6.5): I feel like Drake is a tiktok artist at this point

**nightjesus** (6): Kiki is a name of a town near me.

**timothy444** (6): Memes aside, I lowkey don't mind In My Feelings. Maybe it's the beat juggling or vocal chopping but it's a fun dance song.

**waluigiest** (6): when the in my feelings challenge went viral I thought it was lana del rey

**Jexan13** (5.5): get that cigarete smoke off my face

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Scorpion is SO BORING and this track shows it... it would slap if it wasn't so formulaic, hate his sample usage as usual

**skargardin** (5): meh

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i hope kiki is of legal age

**fadedblue09** (4.7): Definitely the weakest Drake song in the rate (including the features). I felt like at this point, he was aiming for the memes for the sake of it and almost borders on self-parody.

**ExtraEater** (10): ‚ÄúMy mama don't like you and she likes everyone‚Äù is a great lyric

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ‚ÄúIf you like the way you look that much, well maybe you should go and love yourself‚Äù is such a biting lyric and I don‚Äôt think we gave it enough credit to how much he snapped with that one line.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8.5): Jesus Christ, Bieber‚Äôs such an asshole.

---

**1998tweety** (10): It's nice, prob one of my fav JB songs.

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh wait this is the one on purpose i actually like.

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.6): can we get this justin back

**runaway3212** (9): Not as strong as LYTLM, but a very good try.

**bandnitos** (8): i hate that its good i really do

**starlightzone** (8): Okay soft JB is quite nice. I really like this song and think it‚Äôs smooth and gentle. Which isn‚Äôt what we consider JB.

**themagicwemade** (8): yummy could never

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Subtle but venomous lyrics that burn into your head, appropriately minimalist production that is dragged by Justin's so-so singing

**yourfacesucksass** (7.3): I don‚Äôt like this song very much but I can definitely hear how some songs released after this took mad influence from it.

**rhyneston3** (7): Not his best but not his worst

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): my grandma really likes this song for some reason

**rickikardashian** (6.7): I feel that when Ed was writing Thinking Out Loud he was like "lemme do this exact same song, but dissing the girl in case we have a nasty breakup" and this is what he came up with

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.5): (#54) Venom is not something he can pull off, but I'll take this over Yummy any day.

**alwayswords** (6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OHswYxHKf34

**InternetDude19** (6): I love Jed Bieran.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): boring

**skargardin** (6): Meh

**ManofOranges** (5): Meh. I don't see this as the actual abomination that I've heard other people claim it to be but it's certainly not noteworthy.

**starla\_** (5): blah but the Halsey version is even worse

**timothy444** (5): "So torn between the score I want to give. On the positive side, the song is catchy and the instrumental genuinely sounds decent and not annoying. On the other hand, it runs into the same problems that his previous single 'Sorry' had which was his childish demeanour that came along with the delivery of his lyrics. I know it's meant to be some F.U. song disguised as something sweet but it irks me how people just ate this song up and made it such a successful hit. Maybe it's because in comparison to Sorry, it sounds like heaven to the ears but a bad song is still a bad song. Justin Bieber still reeks and though the melody and harmony are on point, everything else in the track just pisses me off."

**worlds-okayest666** (5): halsey‚Äôs ‚Äúfuck yourself‚Äù cover >>>>

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4.5): that trumpet in the bridge can fuck off

**FrankBedbroken** (4): whiny, can't say i have any sympathy for this kinda shit

**nightjesus** (4): Justin sounds boring and the song is boring and Ed Sheeran wrote it why am I not surprised.

**steelstepladder** (4): He should have loved himself an not made Yummy

**vapourlomo** (4): Boring, and Biebs doesn't pull off snark well

**muchopartymuchomoney** (3): this aged terribly

**vayyiqra** (3): [insert viral video of Halsey singing "YEW SHOULD GOWW AND FUCK YOURSELF"] I support the idea of loving oneself, but I don't want to hear it from the Bieb.

**waluigiest** (3): bad but at least it‚Äôs not the Halsey cover

**fadedblue09** (2.5): By far the worst Bieber song in the rate. So dull and soulless, I‚Äôd rather hear his prepubescent songs tbh.

**survivorthrowaway5** (2.5): good topline but such trashy, hateful lyrics

**ReallyCreative** (2): I just don't really get this song it's boring at best and I've never been a fan of Justin's droning

**bespectacIed** (1): i don't know two worst people

**CritneySpearz** (1): I feel like if this song was released in 2020 by JB, people would hate it.  But he was in good graces from his comeback with Where Are U Now, Sorry, and What Do You Mean? So people liked this song.  Omg I‚Äôm making no sense, I‚Äôm just a hater.  This song is trash oop.

**palengard389** (1): This song is so boring it‚Äôs such a huge step down from What Do You Mean? and Sorry

**Xanleth** (1): I‚Äôd rather not.

**hikkaru** (0): I üëè HATE üëè IT üëè HERE üëè

**runaway3212** (10): Incredible

**waluigiest** (10): panda panda panda

**bespectacIed** (9): i've always loved the energy of this song

**bandnitos** (8): a banger 2 be honest

**camerinian** (8): currently dabbing very fucking hard AMA

**ManofOranges** (8): Almost addicitve how catchy it is.

**vayyiqra** (8): *panda panda panda* I am fairly sure we've rated this song not long ago and it's a good meme, but a little too goofy to take it too seriously. I like the instrumentals though and it's a good throwback to the gangsta rap of the 90s I remember, although the lyrics aren't really that deep. :panda_face:

**1998tweety** (7.5): A song that reminds me of my dear friend gannade. I was not a fan of this at all when it came out but it's grown on me.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like it initially but it‚Äôs too repetitive and gets old fast after the first minute

**InternetDude19** (7): "I got broads in Atlanta" is a great hook.

**rslashpoopheads** (7): ok

**steelstepladder** (7): Panda's are cool yo

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): i don‚Äôt know why i like this song

**vapourlomo** (6): (I actually prefer the Life Of Pablo version)

**wavingwolves** (6): BRRR

**\_\_Avaritia** (5.5): Rapping is kinda poor and the constant trills he does quickly lose their lustre, instrumental is pretty cool and icy though

**FKJVMMP** (5): Tiimmy Turner is one of the best hip hop songs of the decade but this is ok too I guess. The ‚ÄòCall Me Maybe‚Äô to Tiimmy Turner‚Äôs ‚ÄòRun Away With Me‚Äô.

**hikkaru** (5): meh

**rhyneston3** (5): I rated this lower in the hip hop rate but it has grown on me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): its literally just one verse repeated 5 times

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): /u/gannade outsold!!!

**yourfacesucksass** (5): This is my first real listen to this song in full, and I just don‚Äôt know

**nightjesus** (3): I feel like an old person asking this but literally what is this noise?

**fadedblue09** (2): One of the decade‚Äôs most WTF moments.

**Popfan2489** (2): I have fond memories of this song but it‚Äôs bad

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (4): ...y‚Äôall remember Green Light? Y‚Äôall did that song dirty in the 09 rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): This is one of the most important songs of the decade. It helped show a whole new generation of kids that black people can make boring ass piano love ballads just as bland as white people can.

---

**bambamhenny** (10): petty but i'm still bitter that when I first let my friends listen to this, they said it sucked then they switch like f slurs when it started getting mainstream recognition

**poppinmmolly** (10): I first heard this song in the spring of 2014 on a music video channel in Spain. I didn't hear it on the radio in the US (well, my neck of the woods) until that fall.

**starlightzone** (9.8): FUCK I LOVE JOHN LEGEND WHY DOES HE MAKE ME FEEL THINGS

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): I used to wanna sing this song to my high school crush when it was first getting popular, its so sweet and John Legend has one of the best voices of any man in the pop game

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Chrissy Teigen is blessed

**nightjesus** (8): I want to thank Chrissy Teigan being the reason this song exists. She‚Äôs the GOAT.

**rickikardashian** (8): the rights to this song must be cheap as hell because it's always sang on talent shows

**waluigiest** (8): what a nice lil ballad

**1998tweety** (7.5): It's alright, pretty inoffensive.

**survivorthrowaway5** (7.5): generic classic

**bespectacIed** (7): corny af but the piano is gorgeous

**rhyneston3** (7): Buy Cravings at your local bookstore

**timothy444** (7): Good but jeez he is so lame lmao

**ManofOranges** (6): Fine but boring to me.

**Roxieloxie** (6): slight ballodphobia but also made for love is better

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): it‚Äôs not a bad song it just upsets me to hear happy people sing about happy relationships. Happy STRAIGHT people at that

**InternetDude19** (5.5): Ooh ahh John Legend loves his wife.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): honestly, this is the first time i've heard anything other than the chorus in the song lol

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): (#73) Cuz aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall of me hates aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaall this song

**ReallyCreative** (5): John Legend is talented but this song is just boring and the writing is like, kindergarten. "Perfect imperfections" needs to be permanently exorcised out of the lexicon

**runaway3212** (5): 'cards on the table we're both showing hearts' is possibly the worst and best lyrics ever.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): i sleep

**Xanleth** (5): Blas√©.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4.5): overplayed to the point that it got really annoying to hear. also back when i was in high school, in music class this was legit the only thing half the people there knew how to play on the piano, and it got so annoying that my music teacher had to ban this song from ever being played at school.

**anothertown** (4): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm on your magical mystery ride‚Äù has to be one of the worst lyrics of the decade

**bandnitos** (4): basic

**skargardin** (4): An anthem for the straights I suppose. I'm tired of hearing this at every possible graduation..

**themagicwemade** (4): ruined for me by every girl who kinda knew how to do vibrato performing it in a talent show

**\_\_Avaritia** (3): John's decent singing cannot save this bland as hell instrumental nor the head-scratching chorus lyrics

**camerinian** (3): John Legend strolled with the boring ass four chord piano ballad so Lewis Capaldi could sprint

**fadedblue09** (3): This is what popheads thinks an Ed Sheeran ballad sounds like.

**vayyiqra** (3): If John is such a legend then how come I've never heard of him??? Checkmate atheists. Anyway I have nothing against ballads, but a midtempo piano ballad is the most boring way to do one.

**alwayswords** (2): yawn

**CritneySpearz** (2): the str8s really ate this shit up huh...

**FKJVMMP** (2): Even by John Legend standards this is boring.

**gannade** (2): imagine being married to chrissy teigen. then imagine writing a song for her. then imagine it being this. yikes

**ExtraEater** (10): A real cornerstone for inauthentic cheesy love songs, and for the record it‚Äôs much better than Perfect as far as emotional yield and musical influence goes. Ed Sheeran said this was influenced directly by Van Morrison, and although it may be sacrilege I think he really matched his influence with this great song. Dare I say it, it‚Äôs about as good as half the songs on Moondance, and Moondance is one of my favorite albums. It‚Äôs pretty weak as a true ‚Äúlove‚Äù song, but it‚Äôs very relaxing, and that‚Äôs really all I need.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song was the moment Ed Sheeran realized that playing it safe created big results. Still a great song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Ed Sheeran‚Äôs best slow dance song. It‚Äôs got  a catchy melody, Ed giving a great vocal performance that also has a personality more than ‚Äúu r so cute and i love you.‚Äù The lyrical choices can be weird at points, but that‚Äôs what separates it from a generic slow dance song.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Ed's magnum opus of a love song, phenomenal chorus is one powerful declaration of love, timeless production with romantic, heartfelt lyrics

**bespectacIed** (10): I am a staunch Ed hater now but confession time: I loved this song so much during my brief Ed Sheeran stan phase of 2017. The mv is gorgeously done. The song is so sweet and cloying. Yeah it's a little cheesy and overplayed but this is still musty Ed's magnum opus.

**poppinmmolly** (10): I. LOVE. THIS. SONG. It will be robbed, but I think it's so sweet.

**rhyneston3** (10): Really just a beautiful love song

**1998tweety** (9.5): Y'all are gonna rob this for sure even though it's super cute. Ed is really good at making this type of song.

**Roxieloxie** (9): It's not One or Photograph but this song is still really good, and yes this probably will play at my wedding at some point

**skargardin** (9): Yes it's been overplayed but it's probably one of his best singles ever

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): i get that popheads hates this song but i do not care.

**timothy444** (9): It's a bop but regardless, I know that some people out there are going to give this song their 0s because they hate Ed Sheeran for all the wrong reasons

**InternetDude19** (8.5): I danced with a girl at prom to this song, and all I could think about was how tight this instrumental is, and that solo?! . . . Fantastic! What a good song.

**starlightzone** (8): I actually don‚Äôt mind this. Ed Sheeran in this song is just so nice and unassuming that I would bring him home to mom unlike now when I don‚Äôt want him even in my eyesight.

**themagicwemade** (8): much like all ed sheeran songs, romantic until you imagine his face

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Can‚Äôt wait for popheads to trash this for being overplayed even though that applies basically to the entire rate.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): i like romantic ed sheeran and i'm not sorry for it

**letsallpoo** (7): lover title track wishes it was this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): Actually a good slow dance song

**alwayswords** (6.5): ‚Äúthinking out loud‚Äù wants what ‚Äújust the way you are‚Äù has

**megm26** (6.3): ‚Äúand darling i will be loving you 'til we're 70‚Äù are they gonna get a divorce when they‚Äôre 70? :(

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.2): bad vocals kill this - hear the strain in the chorus?

**camerinian** (6): the cooler Perfect (Christ that's a low bar)

**FKJVMMP** (5): This song immediately became significantly better when he released Perfect and I realised how bad it could have been.

**waluigiest** (5): I‚Äôm so bored of this man

**Xanleth** (5): Fine Enough

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4.5): (#79) Fuck you, Ed.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.1): I actually really liked x, but this was my least favorite song on the album from day 1 and i‚Äôm still disappointed it became the album‚Äôs biggest hit and the blueprint for so many of his other songs

**bambamhenny** (4): the way this song is gonna be used in so many weddings or whateverü§¢

**steelstepladder** (4): More like keep your thoughts to yourself

**vayyiqra** (4): Sorry Ed, but no. This is boring and belongs back in 1995 where it came from.

**starla\_** (2.5): another boring hetero moment

**anothertown** (2): my upstairs neighbor Mario literally BELTS this late at night at least once every couple weeks as if I didn‚Äôt hate Ed Sheeran enough

**CritneySpearz** (2): str8 culture must be destroyed

**FrankBedbroken** (2): mom music

**runaway3212** (2): Awful

**bandnitos** (1): zero contender

**hikkaru** (1): i would fall asleep listening to this at my wedding

**ManofOranges** (1): Why is Ed Sheeran on this list so much.

**nightjesus** (1): Oh god I FORGOT this existed. I honestly thought Perfect and this song where the damn same. But oh no. I‚Äôm sorry but I just. It‚Äôs so bland. It‚Äôs so slow. His voice is straining and it‚Äôs annoying as well fucking use your diaphragm Ed.

**ReallyCreative** (1): I never want to hear this song again and if that means blacklisting myself from weddings I'll do what needs to be done

**ExtraEater** (10): There are two Wiz Khalifa songs on this chart and neither of them are Black and Yellow

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Never forget that the lyric video for Payphone by Maroon 5 feat. Wiz Khalifa was a poorly drawn manga with adam levine saving his OC girl from zombies as a superhero version of himself and no I will never let this go. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FlQSQuv_mg

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): Jesus why are there so many Maroon 5 songs? Why won‚Äôt they GO AWAY.

---

**palengard389** (11): The sentimental sound and lyrics really get to me. The pre-chorus is phenomenal and the non-rap bridge is too. But even with Wiz it‚Äôs still 11 worthy

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): YES PAYPHONE IS IN THIS RATE IM SO HAPPY i really love this era of maroon 5 to be honest. Daylight is one of my faves and so is this. I actually like the radio disney/clean version a bit more but this song brings back good memories of my old house

**hikkaru** (9): is this actually good? maybe not but idc idc it's SO nostalgic

**themagicwemade** (9): i stan overexposed maroon 5 era what can i say

**bandnitos** (8): when this came out i was fucking OBSESSED

**starlightzone** (8): It‚Äôs good. Again, I‚Äôm a picky bitch and saying it‚Äôs nothing as good as Songs about Jane but it‚Äôs still actually pretty good.

**timothy444** (8): Maroon 5 definitely sold out way before 'this' happened but at least they still produced bops like this. The payphone analogy they use here is a bit too forced, sure, but it's cute seeing a song about such an outdated piece of technology make the Top 100.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): unironically a great song and the one maroon 5 hit this decade that 100% deserved to smash

**1998tweety** (7.5): Same deal as Sugar, Adam's falsetto just doesn't sound good half of the time when used constantly.

**ManofOranges** (7): Ok I do like this song at least a little bit.

**nightjesus** (7): this is the only decent song they‚Äôve released in the last decade.

**rickikardashian** (7): that Wiz Khalifa verse was the saddest, most pathetic attempt at a half-assed added rap feature

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): probably the last decent maroon 5 song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): this does not annoy me.

**survivorthrowaway5** (6.4): ruined by wiz's trash verse

**bambamhenny** (6): why are there so many maroon 5 songs

**muchopartymuchomoney** (6): for a 2010s Maroon 5 song this isn't too bad

**runaway3212** (6): the falsetto in this song is painful.

**megm26** (5.3): his voice is usually pretty annoying but it‚Äôs especially annoying in this song. the rap verse isn‚Äôt that bad though.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): not a maroon 5 hater like everyone else here but I haven‚Äôt really cared for this song ever

**rhyneston3** (5): I swear this song came out after payphones stopped being a thing??

**\_\_Avaritia** (4.5): Kinda catchy but pretty generic all in all, Wiz somehow makes the song even worse

**InternetDude19** (4.5): Man, fuck this shit.

**skargardin** (4): Make it STOP!

**steelstepladder** (4): More like I'm at a payphone trying to call my mom to pick me up because this party is playing Maroon 5.

**Xanleth** (4): This one is a lot more tolerable.

**fadedblue09** (3.8): Flashback to middle school‚Ä¶yeah, bad times.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (3.5): (#83) So petty.

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Why are all the bad Maroon 5 songs here?

**waluigiest** (3): this is just an ARK Studios song with better vocals

**camerinian** (2): that clip from the Todd in the Shadows review where the song starts and the screen immediately shatters? Yeah that about sums it up

**FKJVMMP** (2): Maroon 5 should get shitty guest rappers more often, it helps detract from how terrible they are.

**vayyiqra** (2): How many Maroon 5 songs does this rate really need? Two is more than enough for me. And what is Wiz Khalifa even doing here? Was this song autogenerated by a 2010s mashup program? I was so bored I didn't even notice this was a different song than the one before it until the end, and that's not a good sign.

**bespectacIed** (1): A song like its title object: obsolete, cheap, unnecessary in today's age, smelly

**ReallyCreative** (1): "one more fucking love song I'll be sick" says the man whose career has been built on the backs of the most mediocre love songs this generation has ever known, we have to laugh

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Look at the music. Not a cell phone in sight, just people living in the moment.

**ExtraEater** (8): It‚Äôs catchy, but Home by Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeros does this song‚Äôs cheesy forced sentimental folk thing *much* better. It‚Äôs really sad if a Los Angeles band doing cowboy cosplay is more emotional and evocative of ~the country~ than a Folk/Americana band from Colorado. And while we‚Äôre at it, Little Talks by Of Monsters and Men does this song‚Äôs ‚Äúhey!‚Äù chanting shtick *much* better. Ho Hey is obsolete in nearly every way

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2): god this song is boring

---

#"Accidentally" downloaded a Lumineers song

**bambamhenny** (10): god this song is just...

**InternetDude19** (10): I listened to all hundred songs in one sitting, and this really felt like a victory lap. I was stomping, clapping, cheering; it was joyous.

**nightjesus** (10): ‚ÄòI once accidentally downloaded a Lumineers song. I had to throw away my whole computer just to be safe.‚Äô

**Roxieloxie** (10): harmless bop

**starlightzone** (9.5): This song has such nostalgia. It brings me back to my childhood even though this was released in the 2010s. I think it‚Äôs such a good song. It‚Äôs so peaceful and charming.

**bandnitos** (9): im just impressed that this got in

**bespectacIed** (9): Gorgeous song. Crossed the fine line between country and folk without being annoying (for me at least, because I know many people are annoyed by this lol). "I belong with you, you belong with me in my sweet heart" is such a beautiful lyric.

**runaway3212** (9): simple yet effective.

**waluigiest** (9): I have no concept of how big this song was but I loved it!!

**Xanleth** (9): Kinda surprised this managed to scrape its way onto the list at the bottom here. Great song.

**fadedblue09** (8.1): Cute folk-bop.

**ManofOranges** (8): The logistics of including the lyric of "ho" in a song that is meant to be very sweet and kind are very interesting.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): i guess my favorite genre is indie. like it's probably stuff you don't know. have you heard of this band called the lumineers? *arranging beanie* yeah no they're like pretty underground i don't expect people to know them haha. *eating a leaf* anyway i also like some other bands that you probably haven't heard of. vampire weekend is one.

**vapourlomo** (8): It's cute!

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8): wow didn‚Äôt think i‚Äôd ever make it to the end of this rate

**ggal2020** (7.6): I want to dislike them so bad, but this song slaps

**1998tweety** (7.5): One of the few songs in the rate that I didn't immediately recognize based off the artist and title, but after the first couple of seconds I recognized it right away. It bops a bit but also gets a little annoying at some points.

**gannade** (7.5): this is the musical equivalent of cis straight white male who is growing a beard but shouldnt and is somehow fat but also vegan

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Pretty, lowkey song that is maybe a little too subtle/cloying for my taste, nearly overstays its welcome but the Ho! Heys! are catchy

#Threw away their whole computer just to be safe

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I don‚Äôt like indie shit that sounds like this

**rickikardashian** (5): I have never heard this before‚Ä¶..  was this actually that big? because out of 100, this is the only one I have no memories of

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): more like no hey hahah gottem

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): more like ho BYE xD

**wavingwolves** (5): i don't hate this but i definitely don't love it

**rhyneston3** (4): I‚Äôm normally ok with white guys with guitars, but only if there‚Äôs one of them.

**skargardin** (3): Apparently this was a smash hit yet somehow I've never heard it? It's .. whatever

**slimboyfriend** (3): mass produced generic brand indie folk

**brodiepp** (2): snoooooooooze

**camerinian** (2): can‚Äôt believe this is the indie crossover that got on the list before Pompeii or Feel It Still or Pumped Up Kicks or Shut Up And Dance. Boring, vanilla-ass Mumford and Sons wannabe snoozefest

**rslashpoopheads** (2): Invented the excruciatingly annoying trend of shouting HEY in stupid folksy songs.

**steelstepladder** (2): I don't know if this is unpopular but The Lumineers are so god damn boring and make garbage car commercial music

**vayyiqra** (2): Yeah I hate everything about this. The roots revival or whatever the fuck it was in the early 2010s was the worst thing about that decade's music and I hope I never have to be subjected to a band of white hipsters stomping and clapping while a mandolin plays. It's not a 1 (unlistenable) on my scale but it is a 2 (strongly disliked). A bad song to end a good rate on.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#95) 5% of the time, this song is great! The other 95%, I utterly despise it!

**hikkaru** (1): hated this in 2012 and i hate it now

**palengard389** (1): This is just awful

**ReallyCreative** (1): the damage Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic Zeroes did on our culture by making popularizing this brand of bland lifeless folk music (Home slaps though) cannot be quantified. Stream Neko Case, Sufjan Stevens, Laura Veirs or literally any actual folk artist instead of this gutter garbage or anything like it, I WILL be an elitist bitch on this topic you can call me out but I'm not picking up the phone

**timothy444** (1): it ends the list at 100 and should end this rate at 100!

**anothertown** (0): The period of time when the Lumineers, Mumford and Sons, all of those bands were big was the worst of times and that cannot be disputed

politicallyunique: Wow, why does this sub hate music so much? The sheer number of 1 ratings all these songs got... I gave 3 or less to very few. I don't get how you can be a pop fan yet get so worked up over some of the most popular pop. I'm seriously baffled. Except for #100 on this list, none of these songs are that bad.
