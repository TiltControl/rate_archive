ReallyCreative: I genuinely don't believe I've been upset about *any* of the songs to go out so far, even the few high scores I gave to the first 50 out were ones I knew the sub didn't like much. I'm excited to feel something today üòä

**ExtraEater** (10): Blink and you‚Äôll miss the fact that Christina Aguilera is in this rate because of this bop. Most should be thankful it‚Äôs not ‚ÄúSay Something‚Äù that‚Äôs up here instead

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Maroon 5‚Äôs best performing song in the rate, and are we surprised it‚Äôs their Xtina collab? This is a major bop, and I can remember when I started watching the billboard charts for the first time, this was my birthday number 1 when i started chartwatching, so it‚Äôll hold a special place in my heart.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): The last time Maroon 5 made anything good...or interesting for that matter.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a bop. M5 sounds great on this and Xtina eats up her feature too.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): BANGER ALERT, love the guitar and thumping kicks with the dubstep synths, Xtina killed her feature too

**hikkaru** (10): this pops tf off idc idc

**ManofOranges** (10): This is an absolute hit. Also, I remember hearing screw the nether before this song. That is all.

**rickikardashian** (10): SEE? I DONT HAVE EVERYTHING MAROON 5 DOES, IM NOT A MAN HATING GAY

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.5): (#20) My second guiltiest pleasure. It is also here because of Just Dance.

**MasterWizardRyan** (9.5): The beginning of shitty Maroon 5, this song rocks though

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.5): damn they used to be so much better huh

**CritneySpearz** (9): honestly it slaps, Maroon 5 haters need to appreciate this bop

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the most successful thing to come out of The Voice

**Jexan13** (9): omg who is that puta with the best band ever!? She can sing smh

**muchopartymuchomoney** (9): possibly Maroon 5's last actually good song ever

**rosesmp3** (9): wow remember when maroon 5 actually made some good songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): This song is actually a banger but bc Maroon 5 is on it y‚Äôall are gonna place it at like #75 or something

**timothy444** (9): The best Maroon 5 song on this list

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): adam levine go back to making pop music like this challenge

**megm26** (8.2): i know this sub hates maroon 5 (and with good reason) but you can‚Äôt deny this slaps

**anothertown** (8): Aged like a fine wine! *clink*

**bambamhenny** (8): it ain't that bad and i love christina on this

**bespectacIed** (8): cute, catchy, one of Maroon 5's better pop songs

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Probably the last good Maroon 5 song.

**starlightzone** (8): YEAH okay this is obviously promo for the voice but idc because I kind of jive with this anyways y‚Äôall didn‚Äôt vote for amy vachal and this is why god hates you.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.5): I don‚Äôt really understand the appeal of this song

**Entire-Reflection** (7): this was the end of good Maroon 5 ;-;

**jval888** (7): because I love Xtina

**runaway3212** (7): Yes Maroon 5 is bad, but this song is just fun to listen to.

**skargardin** (7): I still get horrible flashbacks from when my high school teachers used this in a performance at a christmas show..

**survivorthrowaway5** (7): revival song

**ulikejazz** (7): I want to hate it but I somehow just can‚Äôt

**waluigiest** (7): did anyone watch key of awesome as a teenager

**fadedblue09** (6.8): Xtina somehow managed to sneak into this rate. Queen of maintaining relevance through features.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): it‚Äôs so so

**nightjesus** (6): At least this song has character. It‚Äôs groovy, it has a kick ass feature. Still generic but listenable. Better than their later decade releases.

**ReallyCreative** (6): I just want to know why Mick Jagger. like do straight people know what makes a man attractive or are we stuck fetishizing old rock stars until the end of time. Christina is literally opening her clam up because Adam Levine(who I apologetically would like to ruin my life) can move like a 76 year old man make it make sense ! Otherwise not bad but not really good

**vapourlomo** (6): *sigh* alright, this groove is pretty nice

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): a foot-tapper for sure but not much more.

**bandnitos** (5): no thoughts its just mediocre

**GiftoftheGeek** (5): Christina you literally invented the slutdrop you're better than this

**poppinmmolly** (5): this song makes no sense, I am not a fan

**steelstepladder** (5): More like moves like Carlton

**FrankBedbroken** (4): probably the least worst song from them on this list?

**RandomHypnotica** (4): occasionally i'll forget this song exists and feel a sense of inner peace.

**rhyneston3** (4): after watching this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jf35K2Ps_aY I can conclude that Maroon 5 have no idea what they are talking about cause those are the whitest dance moves I‚Äôve ever seen

**themagicwemade** (4): i genuinely thought mick jagger was dead until just now when i googled it. fascinating

**vayyiqra** (4): A song this annoying has no business also being this catchy. Paradoxically, that just makes it worse. I don't even know what to rate it, but I'm leaning towards "dislike".

**Xanleth** (4): Meh.

**FKJVMMP** (3): It‚Äôs kinda hard to judge this fairly because it lead to some of the shittiest pop music ever made, but by itself it‚Äôs just kind of annoying.

**starla\_** (3): urgh

**NotnotaMotmot** (2): Why did this get popular? Somehow Maroon 5 and Xtina combined to put out their worst work for The Voice? Why?

**ExtraEater** (10): This beat is amazing. Seriously, the atmosphere that this sample creates is untouchable and Drake‚Äôs nonstop storm of catchy hooks makes me wonder how this song isn‚Äôt even higher up the Decade-End.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Jesus Christ Drake, you‚Äôre such an asshole.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): An iconic moment in Vine culture.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Iconic bop, biting lyrics that contrast the bright, kind of retro-ish/bouncey instrumental that fit the idea of 'hotline bling'/calling well

**bloupp** (10): iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): if you don‚Äôt think about the problematic lyrics, it‚Äôs a massive bop and one of his best pop-esque songs (Sorry Grammys is this pop). I still remember the day the music video was released because so much happened in Canada that day; Trudeau was elected, Bautista did that iconic bat flip and Drake dropped the video. everyone started making memes combining all these things together and Twitter was wild

**Jexan13** (10): there's something about the production and energy of this... it's simple, but i love how good it works

**vayyiqra** (9.5): My brother used to be a Drake stan but gave up on him because he claims he's a misogynist, and I kind of see where he's coming from since some of the lyrics in this song are rather sexist. If this woman he's singing about isn't with him, then it's not his business if she's out fucking other guys, especially since this is coming from a guy with a secret lovechild. But I still really like this song despite that, and think it's a modern classic. Also, it made for a good meme with the strange and colourful video with his awkward dancing.

**Awkward\_King** (9): i know it‚Äôs heterosexual of me to say but i do love this video

**camerinian** (9): this is the actual meme rate winner

**fadedblue09** (9): I thought I‚Äôd hate this more but it‚Äôs surprisingly fine.

**1998tweety** (8.5): He really is a meme king huh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): crazy that this never hit #1.

**wavingwolves** (8.5): drake gave dad dancing rights and i support him

**GiftoftheGeek** (8): Can we talk about how that damn video with 1.6 billion views opens with "I've played with feet before...I love feet" I'm kinkshaming Drake

**ManofOranges** (8): I don't think Ill ever be able to separate the memes and the wii music from this song.

**nightjesus** (8): This video clip was iconic. That owl jumper? Them moves? Slay Drake.

**rhyneston3** (8): If Drake can look sexy dancing like that then there is hope for me

**yourfacesucksass** (8): It‚Äôs honestly one of his better songs. It‚Äôs still not something I seek out, but so much better than iN mY Fe3lingS

**rslashpoopheads** (7): I know when that Hotline meme

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): haha its the song with the funny drake template in the music video hahah

**vapourlomo** (7): Decent song, legendary video

**waluigiest** (7): I liked this a lot more when it came out

**bandnitos** (6): dudududududududu

**CreepyMannequin** (6): I hate the gross lyrics but this bops

**Roxieloxie** (6): the wii remix outsold

**runaway3212** (6): Drake at his most mediocre.

**skargardin** (6): I tend to forget that this song exists

**steelstepladder** (6): More like I'm leaving you on read

**bespectacIed** (5): remember when Drake was just a moderately popular pop rap guy who could never ever top the Hot 100 except that one time Rihanna carried her? Idk what voodoo Drake performed to become a massive superstar after Hotline Bling

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5): (#75) This is so stupid.

**FKJVMMP** (5): It‚Äôd be rated a lot higher if I could tell whether Drake was being a terrible person on purpose.

**FrankBedbroken** (5): this was originally a 6 because it's enjoyable and fun to listen to still but maaaan that last verse is just uncomfy as shit

**hikkaru** (5): kinda boring sorry...

**starlightzone** (5): I think it‚Äôs been overhyped but I still think it‚Äôs fine. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs got a great back beat though.

**timothy444** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gYOEyzBFYa4

**ReallyCreative** (4): Sufjan Stevens is unbothered

**Xanleth** (0): I hate Drake so much and this song is annoying.

**ExtraEater** (10): Not a self-describing title, as you can tell from its placement

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Why do people like this song? It‚Äôs boring, badly produced, has weird as hell lyrical choices (how are you gonna be an all powerful girl, yet call yourself a dark horse??) It‚Äôs just a mess all around.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): Awful. Katy Perry should stop using hip-hop tropes. It is not a card in her deck. The drop is atrocious, Juicy J is useless, and Katy clearly has no idea how half of the metaphors in this song work.

---

**Popfan2489** (11): probably one of my fav pop songs ever

**anothertown** (10): Iconic final chorus full of adlibs, feeling like it‚Äôs building up to something, and then the song ends abruptly. That is so good. Fuck Dr. Luke

**ignitethephoenix** (10): invented trap

**jval888** (10): the best Katy song

**ManofOranges** (10): I am anticipating people to hate this song, but don't let that distract you from the fact that song this song is amazing. I remember playing this for one of my 7th band concerts and everybody in the audience was floored (or at least as floored as they could be from hearing 12 and 13 year olds play dark horse)

**rhyneston3** (10): Such a banger, I think this is the only Katy Perry single that would still do well on the charts if it were released today

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i luv christian rap <3

**fadedblue09** (9.7): This was a weird hit for Katy back then, but I believed it aged well.

**CritneySpearz** (9.5): slaps

**runaway3212** (9): Katy at the point in her career when it seemed like she could do anything.

**skargardin** (9): bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): Queen. Prob one of my least fav Katy singles but at least it was a hit. The verses are quite nice though.

**hikkaru** (8.5): this is like her biggest song which i don't get but it's still a boppy

**Jexan13** (8.5): Among the best from Prism. It's so catchy and unique and so many times better than Roar. Too bad they had to shoehorn the gross rap feature.

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): perhaps the worst rap break ever, but it is a bop.

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Love the way the song just keeps building and building.

**bandnitos** (8): i added a couple points bc of the lawsuit

**GiftoftheGeek** (8): I thought Katy said "so you wanna play with my cheek" for a while and was like "Okay I guess that's a thing people do"

**nightjesus** (8): You can‚Äôt deny this song fucking bops. The last chorus goes off. With Juicy J bringing it home. Yes.

**palengard389** (8): The lawsuit is a travesty

**rickikardashian** (8): Katy probably made this knowing she was lacking a song that conspiracy theorist could use to prove she‚Äôs a reptilian part of the illuminati that sold her soul to the devil

**slimboyfriend** (8): do u remember that article that counted all the cliches on PRISM? Here are a lot of them, but here I am liking it

**waluigiest** (8): okay this goes harder than it should

**InternetDude19** (7.5): I know Juicy J's verse by heart.

**bespectacIed** (7): a bop but there are better songs on Prism. Also the mv is peak Katy cultural appropriation

**survivorthrowaway5** (7): max martin is responsible for anything good about this song

**themagicwemade** (7): is what birds do called... levitating

**timothy444** (7): Trap music before trap music was a thing

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): remember when pop stars dabbling in trap beats was novel?

**MasterWizardRyan** (6.5): Honestly this song popularized trap music imo

**vayyiqra** (6): wow I love Jessie J

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (5.5): this song is actually good until it gets to that annoying breakdown. and i really can‚Äôt stand the rap part.

**bambamhenny** (5): the PMJ version outsold

**selegend** (5): rip :(

**starla\_** (5): this isn‚Äôt as bad as i remember, outsold Christian rap

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4.8): (#76) The black horse of this competition.

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i never clicked with prism idk what it is, i do want to like this song teenage dream was such a pop smash but i never quite did

**FrankBedbroken** (4): hadn't thought about this song in ages, just tends to fall flat

**starlightzone** (4): I hate this song oh my god I hate this song I have nothing nice to say about this shit. Why was this even a single from Prism when it would be better to just throw the entire album out.

**stickywheels46** (4): Katy doesn‚Äôt understand what a dark horse is lmao

**vapourlomo** (4): This was Katy's biggest hit of the decade?! Really?! Yikes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): that christian rap song that they tried to sue katy perry over for plagiarizing unironically slaps harder than this

**wavingwolves** (3): i remember listening to this for the first time and thinking "i can't believe this is a katy perry song" and that's still how i feel about it

**Xanleth** (3): It‚Äôs not really.

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): this song is a fucking mess and it's so obnoxious. Pre-chorus is pretty good into a vomitous chorus I will pass thanks

**\_\_Avaritia** (2): Idiotic lyrics (that Dahmer line... ew), Katy's decent singing is ruined by the rancid lead repeating melody

**Roxieloxie** (2): i dont know if i hate the video for this or the song more

**steelstepladder** (2): And I'm a pony just a freak horse

**ExtraEater** (10): Very mind numbing beat and vocals

**ImADudeDuh** (5): We really let a song that said r\*\*\*rded become a number one hit in 2014 huh?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (1): I‚Äôm *really* glad Igloo ended up flopping.

---

**1998tweety** (10): We love the song by a female rapper at #1 for the longest amount of time. Y'all are delusional if you say Charli makes this song, Iggy easily has the most iconic and quotable lines in the song.

**bespectacIed** (10): No matter how many times we rate this I'll always say Twice - Fancy outsold, and I'll always score it a 10

**gannade** (10): miss iggy iggz slayed. charli sucks

**ggal2020** (10): if Charli has to be permanently known for one song, this is at least a better choice than boom clap

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Back when I was in 7th grade, I was popular with all the eighth grade ‚Äùghetto‚Äù girls because I knew this and could twerk. I‚Äôd be twerking during recess rapping ‚Äúyou should want a bad bitch like this‚Äù and they‚Äôd be like ‚Äúyassss work bitch!‚Äù

**ManofOranges** (10): Just wanna point out that Charli made this song as successful as it is, but in every way, shape, or form imaginable I love this song. I know every single lyric to this song. The Clueless inspired video was also a serve. Everything is correct.

**rhyneston3** (10): Absolute slapper!!

**rickikardashian** (10): I can't believe the hill I decided to die on is defending that Fancy is a 10

**worlds-okayest666** (10): charli ate

**Awkward\_King** (9): only semi related but clueless is my favorite film, cher is so iconic as a character and paul rudd could fuck me anyday

**hikkaru** (9): yes this song is shit. yes i'm giving it a 9. what about it?

**nightjesus** (9): You can‚Äôt deny this damn chorus is ICONIC. Charli made this song.

**poppinmmolly** (9): every basic white girl's anthem in the summer of 2014 (including me)

**vapourlomo** (9): Iggy is a bad person and a bad rapper. But this song is still shockingly good ‚Äî testament to Charli's genius.

**InternetDude19** (8.9): Charli makes this song. And I never tired of it.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.6): Say what you will about Iggy, but this was a smash and you can‚Äôt pretend like it wasn‚Äôt.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Production isn't the best but Iggy's rapping shows personality and Charli holds her own on the chorus and first bridge, pretty good lyrics

**bandnitos** (8): if iggy didn't use the r slur this would be a 9

**RandomHypnotica** (8): DaE ChArLi bIt GoOd IgGy YaWn?

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Iggy is already long gone but this is a good legacy on its own.

**runaway3212** (8): 'LET ME IN, I BE THE I-G-G-Y' absolutely saves this song for me.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): this song is probably a lot worse than my perception of it, but fuck it. it was kind of the big song around the last time in my life when i was truly happy so i have good thoughts associated to it. also i would kill for another collab between these two.

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): Iggy kinda pops off here and but man the production could use some work from top to bottom

**alwayswords** (7): why did we let iggy get away with using a slur in 2014

**skargardin** (7): bop idc

**survivorthrowaway5** (7): starmaker - well, for 15 minutes...but deservingly

**FrankBedbroken** (6.5): somewhat guilty pleasure bc charli but still some of iggy's lyrics are just not it

**camerinian** (6): don't get it twisted, this is a 10/10 song, but it unfortunately has Iggy Azalea on it and that's an automatic four point penalty

**timothy444** (6): Iggy Azalea has this weird-ass accent and it's scaring me the hell out. The Charli XCX bits still bop.

**wavingwolves** (6): charli's career is really something huh

**steelstepladder** (4): More like I'm so antsy to turn this song off when it comes on

**vayyiqra** (4): Yet another song we rated not long ago and I didn't like it then so why would I now. We all know Iggy bad, Chorli good. The bassline kind of slaps. Thanks for reminding me to do my physics homework. Watch *Clueless*.

**waluigiest** (4): this is the third time I‚Äôve rated this recently and I‚Äôm sick of talking about Iggy

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4): i, too, want to drive my car from la to tokyo

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I wonder how far will popheads take this mediocre song just because it has Charli on it.

**1000\_nights** (3): Dated as hell (or maybe it wasn't that good at the time)

**jackisboredtoday** (3): this gets a bonus point for the beat and a bonus point for the hook, but I‚Äôm just never gonna come around on Iggy

**palengard389** (3): I still can‚Äôt get over how annoying Charli sounds in this

**starlightzone** (3): its so nice that even people who can‚Äôt rap can call themselves rappers.

**Xanleth** (3): Never liked this song.

**FKJVMMP** (2): Even Charli can‚Äôt save this from the embarrassment that is Iggy Azalea‚Äôs entire existence.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (2): this would be a 1 but Charli XCX's chorus gives it an extra point... sorry Charli but i just can't stand Iggy

**anothertown** (1): Wait!!! I can‚Äôt believe I just noticed she said the R-word in this‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶...

**ComeOnPupperfish** (1): (#94) No.

**Roxieloxie** (1): the one point is for charli

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): no!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8.5): soccer moms really won with this one, huh? Kelly Thee Clarkson snapped here.

**ExtraEater** (8): Pretty nice

**ImADudeDuh** (4): Kelly sweetie, this song is so damn generic. I don‚Äôt even want to waste typing strength on explaining how generic it is.

---

**dlstantdreamer** (11): This song is one of her best singles, she turned a common phrase into a smash hit single and it deserves so much better than it gets.

**fadedblue09** (10): Honestly, as a big Kelly stan, this isn‚Äôt even the best on the album but when you put it on a list like this, there‚Äôs nowhere to go but UP.

**gannade** (10): whew the vocal power

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): nietzsche found dead in ditch

**runaway3212** (10): Kelly has such amazing vocals.

**skargardin** (10): Look, it's a basic motivational anthem but sometimes that just exactly what you need, and this has unironically always been one of my favorite Kelly songs.

**timothy444** (10): Great

**worlds-okayest666** (10): a perfect pop song methinks

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Bops pretty hard, Kelly's singing is amazing as always especially at the bridge when she reaches higher

**1998tweety** (9): This is kind of bland when compared to her other big hits but it still bops a bit.

**hikkaru** (9): a classic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): she really is the queen of anthems

**rslashpoopheads** (9): My white people anthem.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (8): this sort of song usually gets a lot of hate but i think this one is actually pretty well executed

**starlightzone** (8): Everything she‚Äôs done before and after this song is better than this one moment in the Kelly Clarkson song book. But it‚Äôs still good.

**waluigiest** (8): Not Kelly‚Äôs best song by a long shot but damn she is a powerhouse vocalist

**ManofOranges** (7): I mean... the best way to sum up this song is that it's harmless.

**palengard389** (7): I‚Äôve seen a lot of hate for this song but I don‚Äôt know why. It‚Äôs pretty generic but pretty good too

**Roxieloxie** (7): oh 2013, i miss your music

**vayyiqra** (7): Maybe I misspoke earlier about minivan pop and soccer moms made a few points. I never noticed before that this song is, lowkey, an electro banger??? Listen to the instrumentals closely and not the vocals and it could be a Gaga deep cut easily.

**yourfacesucksass** (6.5): Really don‚Äôt like this song, really.

**nightjesus** (6): This song is played a lot at my work.

**rhyneston3** (6): Kelly can do better, at least she sounds great

**wavingwolves** (5.5): the chorus ain't it

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4.3): (#80) What if Since You've Been Gone, but bad.

**bandnitos** (4): fight song the prequel

**InternetDude19** (4): Tacky

**bespectacIed** (3): Friedrich Nietzsche plagiarism lawsuit, when?

**steelstepladder** (3): More like this song almost killed me because of how bad it is and I don't feel much stronger, just more depressed

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): stream stronger by kanye west

**kappyko** (2): the drop is terrible

**Xanleth** (2): I kinda wish it would. This song is so bad.

**camerinian** (1): what doesn't kill your career makes it less interesting to anyone other than soccer moms

**FKJVMMP** (1): This is the kind of song that kills careers. Thank god it did, between Stronger and Fight Song it might stop the next desperate singer looking for easy money from making embarrassing bullshit like this.

**ExtraEater** (10): Four words: Jump. In. The. CAAC. (https://rf9weu8hjf789234hf9.tumblr.com/post/172006661342/)

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): This song (and the whole album) slaps. Bruno was the best male pop artist of the 2010s. Debate your mother.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): Why this was a number 1 hit and 24K Magic wasn‚Äôt is one of the biggest questions of pop music in the 2010s.

#CAAC

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4CIbwB2rbo

**megm26** (7.6): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ATgFNHJcf2E

#Lucky for you, that's what I LIKE

**alwayswords** (10): my condolences lorde

**bespectacIed** (10): This is literally impossible to move your shoulders and head to. Bruno said you will BOP to this.

**InternetDude19** (10): Every line is quotable, Bruno's delivery is impassioned, and this is a fantastic pop song.

**timothy444** (10): There's just something here that makes "That's What I Like" an instant classic. Maybe it's the melody, or the way Bruno's voice sounds like it belongs in the 90's but either way, this is a great bop!

**bambamhenny** (9): bruno brings bops everyone

**hikkaru** (9): 24k magic title track and finesse remix OUTSOLD but this is a big bop too

**nightjesus** (9): So here is the T. While I LOVE 24K Magic, I don‚Äôt agree with it winning the Grammy, in my personal opinion, PERSONAL, I think ‚ÄòAwaken! My Love!‚Äô deserved the award. EITHER WAY, don‚Äôt get my words twisted, this song is a fucking jam.

**Roxieloxie** (9): The nerdist spidey life cover kinda outsold but this is still pretty good

**steelstepladder** (9): More like this is what I like

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Okay but pretty classic instrumental and okay lyrics carried by Bruno's charisma

**Jexan13** (8.5): This sounds like something from The Emancipation of Mimi, but good, don't @ me

**starlightzone** (8.5): While I love Ballad Bruno a lot, this is also just genius and such a good song for Bruno.

**ManofOranges** (8): Catchy.

**rickikardashian** (8): this song is nice, but the only reason this won song of the year at the Grammys was because in 2018 that category was just like a slow news day

**skargardin** (8): Underrated bop!

**starla\_** (8): ey eY EY

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): kinda surprised this song got as big as it did but it's pretty good

**1998tweety** (7.5): I thought this was just alright, all the other singles off the album were better so I was confused why this was the biggest hit.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): fun, but severely overrated.

**rhyneston3** (7): Where are the good Bruno

**waluigiest** (7): put this in the meme rate

#That's that shit I don't LIKE

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): he turned from nice guys to real douche real quick didn't he

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.3): (#58) This, funny enough, is not the Bruno I like.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.1): this bruno is actually not quite what i like, can we bring back the old one please

**FrankBedbroken** (6): it's alright but i can't hear this without thinking of jump in the CaaC so i think that's kinda hindered my enjoyment of the actual song?

**rslashpoopheads** (6): It's fine.

**survivorthrowaway5** (5.5): kinda smarmy

**fadedblue09** (5): Bruno was so big this decade even his filler made the decade-end list.

**runaway3212** (5): I find Bruno Mars somewhat annoying on this song.

**vayyiqra** (4): Not this fucking song again. I feel like we rated this not too long ago, and I didn't like it then, and I still don't. I don't even know why, because it's a fine and competently made song. This is just not what I like.

**CritneySpearz** (3.5): Maybe I hate all of Bruno‚Äôs songs omg...

**bandnitos** (3): i irrationally dislike this song like im aware that it's irrational but it won't make me like it

**Xanleth** (2): I definitely don‚Äôt like this.

**ExtraEater** (10): One of my bonus rate picks. Sabi absolutely dominates with every part she has in this song. Seriously, the ‚ÄúI'm the baddest baby in the atmosphere‚Äù pre-chorus might just be better and catchier than the chorus, which is still fantastic. Also, she is hot af in the mv

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Cobra Starship releasing You Make Me Feel and Good Girls Go Bad had a bigger impact on music than The Beatles‚Äô whole discography.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): [BANGER ALERT]

---

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop

**bambamhenny** (10): im actually a cobra starship stan

**bandnitos** (10): underrated classic

**ManofOranges** (10): This song was locked away in my subconscious, waiting for a rate like this to free it and remind me of this song and how much I liked it. Thank you.

**skargardin** (10): literally iconic

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): funny how the last thing we heard from sabi was "steaming like a pot full of vegetables" then she just disappeared

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Bop!

**brodiepp** (9): A WHOLE BOP, thanks for reminding me this existed

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Uncreative chorus but overall just a banger, production is clean and pure electropop sweetness encapsulated in 1 song

**starla\_** (8.5): i forgot this song existed...banger

**yourfacesucksass** (8.2): Rihanna-clone #2 had a decent hit here

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): This would be #38 in the list.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Missing my trashy white people anthems.

**bespectacIed** (7): BOP but if this were a Rihanna x Maroon 5 song it could've been a bigger hit. Good Girls Go Bad the superior Cobra Starfish song

**camerinian** (7): can't say I'd ever need to hear this song again, but I do love a yell-along pre-chorus

**waluigiest** (7): they fumble the bridge so badly

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This must be the America's guilty pleasure song to show up on a decade end billboard list and I don't blame this country for that

**vayyiqra** (6.5): This song is okay but who even remembers Cobra Starship? I'm old enough to remember when *Snakes On a Plane* came out and I still barely remember them. I doubt I would be rating this song as high without the combo of synth and female vocals which Popheads loves. Stream "Make Me Feel" by Janelle Monae, a great song, unlike this one which is merely decent.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): what ever happened to Sabi? Where is she now?

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's a little obnoxious but it's a bop

**Xanleth** (5): They were a thing for a while huh.

**anothertown** (4): this is bad but I hope Gabe Saporta is having an ok day

**starlightzone** (4): no.

**steelstepladder** (4): Good girls go bad is far superior

**wavingwolves** (4): i miss cobra but not this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): oh my god this aged SO badly

**fadedblue09** (2.5): That "la, la, la" part is dope but the rest of the song? Trash, like most every song from this era.

**FKJVMMP** (2): I want to like Cobra Starship, but god everything they make is so fucking annoying.

**ExtraEater** (10): Pop girl with great hook, rapper with corny lyrics. Worked for Jay-Z's Empire State of Mind, worked for Nothin‚Äô on You, works for Airplanes. I love that little swoon Hayley Williams does while B.o.B is doing his verses.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): One of the best hooks of the decade. I feel like everyone has at least one point went ‚Äúcan we pretend that airplanes in the night time are like shooting stars‚Äù

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Brings me back to 2010 ‚Äúdeep‚Äù Facebook statuses. Also Hayley Williams is the best part of this song.

---

**rslashpoopheads** (11): Why are songs about planes always 10/10?

**1998tweety** (10): Easily one of the best songs in the rate

**bespectacIed** (10): This was a massive fucking serve. Most random collab ever (bested only by B.O.B ft. Taylor Swift). That hook is ridiculously good, Hayley's voice is magical, B.O.B's verses are actually very meaningful and not half-assed. This is the best rap-song-with-a-repetitive-hook-from-a-pop-girl of all time.

**gannade** (10): omg the nostalgia

**jackisboredtoday** (10): This is like, the first big hit I ever loved and I‚Äôll know every line, every note of it by heart for the rest of my life. Middle-school me 100% stanned B.o.B, and I‚Äôm not even kidding when I say I nearly gave this my 11

**skargardin** (10): This has weirdly enough gotten some radio play at a local radio station this past month, I think it's part of some decade end campaign, and it holds up fantastically.

**timothy444** (10): Pop rap shouldn't have died. I love the catchy hooks between each verse and just like 'Timber', it bops hard. Airplanes has a more bittersweet tone to it but they still nail that feeling.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): giving this a 10 only because queen Hayley Williams is in the song

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Lovely overhanging piano melody and overall instrumental, B.o.B.'s rapping sells the longing/nostalgic message of the song and has quite a bit of personality, great Hayley feature

**Awkward\_King** (9): just for hayley‚Äôs voice tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (9): a classic

**nightjesus** (9): I mean I ain‚Äôt mad but, without fail, when I see an airplane at night I think of this song.

**Roxieloxie** (9): you know we love Miss Hayley

**fadedblue09** (8.6): Looking back this is actually pretty corny lol

**alwayswords** (8.5): hayley carried this

**megm26** (8.1): this is such a good song and some of the lyrics are really nice sucks that he‚Äôs a flat earther

**camerinian** (8): this was my favourite song when I was 12, and I think that says it all.

**FKJVMMP** (8): It‚Äôs trite and generic but Hayley Williams can carry anything to at least a 6.

**hunnybee12** (8): RAWR XD

**runaway3212** (8): I really like the chorus and the verses are not bad.

**waluigiest** (8): fellow millennial/zoomer cusps: who else remembers when everyone made the chorus to this song their Facebook status?

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.9): (#40) Insert here some sort of flat Earth joke.

**hikkaru** (7.5): the chorus is the only part i care about but said chorus is iconic

**bandnitos** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jylWVydRTrg

**RandomHypnotica** (7): i love that everyone on the team felt it was necessary to put Hayley Williams OF PARAMORE

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): definitely a classic of its time, but it loses points for it not aging great and for b.o.b. being a dumbass.

**bulforster** (6.8): I thought you couldn't trust airplanes because the airlines are part of the conspiracy to brainwash people into thinking the Earth is round instead of flat?

**GiftoftheGeek** (6): Decent song but man is Nicki's bit referencing it in Out of My Mind better *alone*

**InternetDude19** (6): Hayley is too good for this, and wishing on airplanes as if they were stars is too desperate an action for a song about rap not being fun anymore.

**ManofOranges** (6): There's not much going on here for me. Also very middle of the road.

**rhyneston3** (6): Both of Us feat Taylor Swift deserved this spot

**slimboyfriend** (6): I could use a dream or a genie or a wish or a genie or a dream or a genie or a wish or a dream or a genie or a wish or a

**starlightzone** (6): and all 6 points are for Hayley Williams, you fucking flat earther.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): xX~can we pretend that... ‚úà‚úà airplanes ‚úà‚úà in the üåôüåô night üåÉüåÉ skyüåôüåô are like ‚≠ê*üå† shooting stars ‚≠ê* üå† i could really use a wish üå†üòîüòî right now... wish üå† right now...~xX üòîüòî

**themagicwemade** (6): you think this song is good because you remember hayley williams but then B.o.B makes up most of it and you realize you don't have a clue what the lyrics to anything but the chorus are

**steelstepladder** (5): If I had a wish right now I'd wish that the verses were better because the chorus saves this song from being genuinely bad

**vapourlomo** (5): Bummer that the worst of B.o.B.'s three big hits was his biggest :(

**survivorthrowaway5** (4.5): still don't know why this was a hit

**ReallyCreative** (4): I'm sorry Hayley but you just aren't enough to save this mess

**vayyiqra** (4): If the world is round how come airplanes don't fly off it into space??? Answer that, "scientists". :sunglasses: No but really this song blows and even Hayley's part doesn't save it very much, even though I like her a lot.

**wavingwolves** (4): hayley, i love and support you, but i don't miss your collabs. also, how crazy and worrying it is that b.o.b is a flat-earther?

**kappyko** (3): hayley williams yes. bob no

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): popheads really loses their shit over the most generic songs just bc theres a pop girl singing on the chorus huh

**Xanleth** (2): Ironic flat earther B.O.B Is singing about Airplanes.

**ExtraEater** (10): A really catchy song that just gets catchier with each repetition of ‚Äúwork work work work work‚Äù. Now where did the Emo Polka Jazz version of this song go?

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Bop for the ages. This song has been the song of the summer since 2016.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶ weird and not interesting at the same time?

---

**fadedblue09** (11): Pitchfork is CORRECT. This is one of Rihanna‚Äôs best songs and among the best songs of the decade and this sub is a bunch of tasteless hoes for thinking otherwise. This literally invented minimalist club bangers and paved the way for non-English bops to rise. Anyone who rates this low doesn‚Äôt deserve R9 smh.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (11): i hated it at first but now it's one of my favorite songs of all time

**bespectacIed** (10): I'm the biggest apologist of Work. Anyone who makes fun of the "incoherent lyrics" (aka Caribbean patois) of this song is racist. This song is my forever summer bop, Rih re-brought her dancehall sound with this massive HIT.

**bulforster** (10): The song that truly made me a Rihanna fan. Her patois is everything and the less comprehensible she gets the more I love it. This probably would've been my 11 without Drake.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): White people act like this is bad and non-sensical. In reality, this is a masterpiece.

**laurent1683** (10): As hated as it is, this will always make me wanna zone out, in a great way

**nightjesus** (10): werkwerkwerkwerkwerksejrjdjjrbdjwerkwerkwerkwerkwerk

**rhyneston3** (10): I love you Riri!!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): Do you remember that part of 2016 where white people got really bold, which part you ask? the part where they thought it was okay to make gentrified covers of work/formation/panda and they really thought they were doing something, so black vine creatives started the #TrapCovers tag and did trap covers of really white songs like *you belong with me* , that was fun

**starlightzone** (9.5): If we rate this high enough she might release a new album before 2030.

**wavingwolves** (9.3): i love every single rihanna/drake collab so of course this is no different

**bandnitos** (9): this doesn't get enough respect

**runaway3212** (9): I gave this a 9, but when will Rihanna give us R9?

**1998tweety** (8.5): This song has definitely grown on me but I'm still not a huge fan. At least it's catchy and sounds interesting.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I‚Äôve always liked this song and have never been that person who is like ‚ÄúI can‚Äôt listen to this cause I don‚Äôt understand Rihanna‚Äù. Also drake and Rihanna collabs hit differently

**bambamhenny** (8): you ain't doing nothin but hoein on stage

**megm26** (8): i really love how she uses her native patois in this song

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Love the vibe/instrumental but the melody bores me.

**skargardin** (8): Twerking anthem

**waluigiest** (8): sis we‚Äôre starving

**yourfacesucksass** (7.4): Just like Rihanna, nobody texts me in a crisis

**steelstepladder** (7): More like pork (which is tasty)

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): i like the beat but that chorus is really lacking huh

**FrankBedbroken** (6): smooth instrumental but the chorus doesn't do it for me, also drake is a problem

**hikkaru** (6): never really been a huge fan of this... rih eats a lil i must admit but drake can choke

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's an okay but not great Rihanna song that really starts to go nowhere when Drake shows up

**vayyiqra** (6): werwerwerwerwerk Rih please enunciate better I know you can do it. There are parts of this song where she gives up and say "wahwahwahwah". Drake isn't much better with his nasal autotune of course. I want to like this, but the vocals are awful.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.9): (#66) Capitalism? In MY r/popheads? It's less likely than you'd think.

**ManofOranges** (5): I remember listening to this song for the first time and just being completely confused of how it was so popular. Like it just doesn't make sense to me. I don't find it catchy. I don't find it endearing. It's somewhat of a slog it listen through.

**themagicwemade** (5): i think this is the worst rihanna lead single

**vapourlomo** (5): Not to get all indieheads on y'all...but this is low-tier Rihanna. Too repetitive, with an awful Drake verse

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): Intriguing instrumental with okay beat but one of Rihanna's worst singing, Drake's feature is disposable, worst of all horrendous, horrendous hook

**1000\_nights** (3): No it's not that I 'don't get the patois', it's just a bad song

**Popfan2489** (2): drakes worst song but Rihanna‚Äôs part is good

**Xanleth** (1): This song is exceptionally annoying.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i hate this song so much why does rihanna sound like she's under anesthesia when she sings why does the instrumental sound like it was made in garageband in five minutes why does this song EXIST

**timothy444** (0): What is this? Why does this exist?  What's the reason behind this? Rihanna has a lot of music in her discography so there's really no excuse for this trash garbage song to be released. She can so much better and she's proven that with jawdropping singles like "Umbrella", "Disturbia" and "Where Have You Been?". But this? This is the song an asshole genie plays when you ask to listen to Rihanna. It's not even so bad its good. It's just... bad.

**ExtraEater** (10): As it turns out, you *can* evoke a lot of emotion with a few piano notes (that outro is pretty cool) and a grating rave sound

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Pitbull is an international treasure.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): Endearing. Pitbull was fun, we could use another hit from him.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely iconice, king shit.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Afrojack's instrumental easily the highlight of this banger, great vocals everywhere, makes me want to dance so bad

**bambamhenny** (10): this is like edm perfection

**hikkaru** (10): those piano chords !!! i am FILLED with nostalgia rn

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A modern classic. When else will someone rhyme Kodak with Kodak?

**ManofOranges** (10): I miss pitbull.

**nightjesus** (10): This is by far my favourite Pitbull songs and one of my favourite songs of 2011.

**rhyneston3** (10): Friendship ended with Polaroid, now Kodak is my new best friend

**Roxieloxie** (10): pitbul please come back and save us all

**skargardin** (10): Collab of the decade methinks

**timothy444** (10): Used to hate this song so much but it's such a massive collaborative bop. I don't want to go all r/lewronggeneration but I miss Pitbull.

**starla\_** (9.5): dal√©

**TiltControls** (9.5): Peak of Pitbull's lyricism

**wavingwolves** (9.2): i love mr. worldwide!!! this is a bop and a half!!!!

**alwayswords** (9): dale

**palengard389** (9): OMG A BLAST FROM THE PAST

**rickikardashian** (9): I used to hate pitbull so much when i was younger, and for what? homeboi only brought us bops after bops

**starlightzone** (8.8): is this pitbull‚Äôs best song because he didn‚Äôt say mister worldwide at the beginning of it? The mystery continues.

**MrMoodle** (8.7): Fuck everyone, Pitbull is a legend. This song has a really good vibe. Feels almost melancholic. I remember Todd did a review and made fun of the ‚Äúwe might not get tomorrow‚Äù type lines throughout the song. And, yeah, like‚Ä¶ Why would they not get tomorrow? But the ‚Äúend of the world‚Äù type vibe is matched very well by the sound and synth progression of the song, imo.

**anothertown** (8.5): I hated this so much at the time but i guess it‚Äôs aged well.. maybe i just have worms in my brain

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): a classic and one of the few times I'll say I appreciated Pitbull's presence (Timber!)

**bulforster** (8): I really do miss Pitbull sometimes and Ne-Yo's chorus is good I just wish the synth melody under it didn't sound like a whoopie cushion.

**FrankBedbroken** (8): this probably sounds better now than it did back then??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): When Pitbull rhymed kodak with kodak..ugh his mind!

**themagicwemade** (8): i mostly remember this song from pitch perfect

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): i know i'm about to give a pitbull song a high rating, but this song unironically slaps.

**vapourlomo** (8): DAL√â! KODAK!

**bespectacIed** (7): Bop. pitch perfect version outsold

**hunnybee12** (7): kodakkodakkodak

**steelstepladder** (7): More like this song has everything a Pitbull song should have

**vayyiqra** (7): This is like a distillation of every 2010s pop trend and lyrical cliche there is, and I want to dislike it, but as corny and kind of annoying as it is, it's kind of a good song.

**waluigiest** (7): summer 2011 was such a simple time. You could start a song by rhyming Kodak with Kodak and radio would eat it up.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (6.9): (#52) Nice.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): rhyming Kodak with Kodak, what a poet.

**gannade** (6): this was... a song

**megm26** (6): it‚Äôs kinda bad but it gives me so much nostalgia that i‚Äôd feel bad giving it a lower score

**bandnitos** (5): i was born in 2002 so idk how much i know but i do not remember this being big enough to get on here

**CritneySpearz** (5): Pitbull is like French Montana in that his features ruin every song for me.. tragic

**racloves** (5): I just love pitbulls opening lines

**slimboyfriend** (5): who tf is Nayer

**Xanleth** (5): So this is the Kodak song. I just knew it from that line being meme‚Äôd.

**rslashpoopheads** (4): This song is so annoying.

**InternetDude19** (3): This song sounds so dead and lifeless, who could ever dance to this?

**runaway3212** (3): Possibly the worst lyrics in this entire rate.

**fadedblue09** (2): More awful party music mess. So glad this trend is over. Also I thought Ne-Yo‚Äôs part here was Chris Brown for quite some time.

**Entire-Reflection** (0): I hate it I hate it I hate it

**ExtraEater** (10): Good

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Fuck y‚Äôall, this song still slaps.

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): I remember when this first debuted on the chart, and let me tell you, I did NOT expect this to catapult Cardi into superstardom so fast.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Defined Cardi's career as much as it defined the pop/hip-hop scene, as icy and venomous and bombastic from Cardi as it SLAPS

**bloupp** (10): Instant classic

**gannade** (10): hmmm... inch resting how i havent seen nicki here yet on this decade end chart and cardi's mainstream debut was all the way in 2017. inch resting

**Jexan13** (10): "insert the f*ck Pitchf*rk copypasta here"

**rhyneston3** (10): phew if this comes on at a party and you aren‚Äôt screaming the chorus then you‚Äôre a little bitch

**rslashpoopheads** (10): Step on me.

**runaway3212** (10): Cardi was at this point still a breath a fresh air and this song is still amazing.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): wig

**Awhile2** (9): so this is what its come to huh oh wait wrong sub

**poppinmmolly** (9): I shouldn't like this song, but I do.

**rickikardashian** (9): I have no clue how or when I learned all the words to this song, but I can rap this bitch perfectly

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's alright. Definitely not her best song as some people seem to think. It did a good job getting her into the spotlight but almost all of her singles are better imo.

**bulforster** (8.5): Invasion of Privacy vs Queen vs Fever would be a good rate (I know Cardi and Megan are in May's Rap Girl rate so this probably won't happen).

**survivorthrowaway5** (8.3): classic

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8): (#38) I make Money! moves.

**fadedblue09** (8): Yeah, Cardi can stay.

**ManofOranges** (8): The hook is kinda weak but Cardi has bars here.

**skargardin** (8): It's easy to see why this was her breakout hit, it's a banger

**starlightzone** (8): I love slow Cardi a lot. She‚Äôs definitely here to say fuck you and tell you why. She‚Äôs just top tier when it comes to good music.

**steelstepladder** (8): I still remember that who's this bad bitch? moment that came with hearing this song for the first time.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): insert that r/indieheads copypasta here

**waluigiest** (8): she‚Äôs so talented!

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I like Cardi but I couldn‚Äôt get with this song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): So this is what it‚Äôs come down to, huh? With the crowning of ‚ÄúBodak Yellow‚Äù as 2017‚Äôs single greatest piece of music...

**nightjesus** (7): I‚Äôm super happy for Cardi B and her success.

**bandnitos** (6): see lil BITCH

**hikkaru** (6): meh

**bespectacIed** (5): iconic but only ok

**vayyiqra** (4): WHY does - EVery - CARdi - SONG have - VOcals - LIKE this - IT gets - REALly - TIRing - to LISTen TO. While this song has a kind of cool and dark instrumental, I really can't stand her voice, or her lyrics, or really her in general.

**Xanleth** (3): Needs a Ptibull ‚ÄòKodak Yellow‚Äô remix.

**Entire-Reflection** (2): this song has a stolen flow and has the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôm rich I‚Äôm rich I‚Äôm rich‚Äù included

**timothy444** (1): She's basically like Nicki Minaj but if she tried way too hard which is already a low bar to achieve anyway. This has the same score as "Watch Me Nae Nae" but even that song is better.

**ExtraEater** (10): This is the actual most robbed, most underrated song in the rate. For starters, it‚Äôs the only full on, high-energy, Motown-esque *Soul* song on here (No, Pharrell‚Äôs Happy doesn‚Äôt count), and it‚Äôs a *really* good one, too. Plus, it‚Äôs not just a perfect pop song, but a neo-soul classic from a guy who already delivered one years before with Crazy (as half of Gnarls Barkley). This is basically his follow-up masterpiece to that masterpiece, and we‚Äôre treating it like it‚Äôs just another song? Please

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is a 10, but probably my least enthusiastic 10 that I‚Äôve given this rate. The throwback sound lost it‚Äôs luster after the rest of the decade decided to follow along with it, it kinda has a bit of a possible ‚Äúincel‚Äù vibe with it, and Cee Lo became a garbage person and said some terrible things after this was a hit. I‚Äôd be lying if I didn‚Äôt love every second of this song, but I‚Äôd also be lying if I said I didn‚Äôt feel a pang of guilt with this song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): An underrated gem. The Glee version sucks.

---

**anothertown** (10): Ok this song has always been corny but the production is incredible. The arrangement and the vocal harmonies are so classic and uplifting

**fadedblue09** (10): This song is just a MOOD, y‚Äôknow?

**gannade** (10): sucks that hes a rape apologist

**kappyko** (10): fuck cee lo green but this shit is radiant

**ManofOranges** (10): This goes out to all the people who play the censored version of this song.

**skargardin** (10): Pop culture history, luvs

**stickywheels46** (10): Big up Cee Lo, he‚Äôs just saying it how it is

**1998tweety** (9.5): Cee Lo Green as a person aside, this song sounds so damn good. I'll be honest though this is one of the few times where the censored version is kind of the superior version.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): the censored version is better and would be a 10

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): todd in the shadows core

**camerinian** (9): obligatory fuck Cee Lo but this do bop very hard

**palengard389** (9): Still sounds great!

**rhyneston3** (9): So fun to scream along to when you‚Äôre drunk!!

**steelstepladder** (9): More like all fuck yes

**wavingwolves** (9): i'm very partial to the censored version but this is good too

**rslashpoopheads** (8.5): Remember when this was the biggest thing for 6 months and then everyone just decided to forget about it forever?

**starlightzone** (8.5): If this was the censored version it would get my 0.

**ggal2020** (8): the clean version is better

**RandomHypnotica** (8): When I found out Cee Lo Green was also half of Gnarls Barkley i nearly had an aneurysm

**runaway3212** (8): Very solid

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.2): (#48) I'm happy they went with 'Forget' for the censored version, because any other alternative just sounds so silly. Frick! Screw!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Pretty classic sounding even if Cee Lo's singing is a little off-putting at times especially the bridge, pretty nice lyrics

**bandnitos** (7): rude

**FKJVMMP** (7): It‚Äôs still fun, but this was a *lot* better ten years ago. Before it turned out Cee-Lo was just the worst.

**GiftoftheGeek** (7): Great until that whiny-ass "WHYYYYY?!" bit

**Roxieloxie** (7): the muppet cover outsold

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): cee lo green. what a concept.

**vapourlomo** (7): Worn out its welcome a bit, but it's still got a charm

**megm26** (6.8): i‚Äôm so used to forget you this is sowed

**yourfacesucksass** (6.7): Fuck this song.

**nightjesus** (6.5): Ain‚Äôt that some shit.

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's been brought up in this sub before, but isn't it genuinely weird how this song is better without cursing? this version feels kinda bizarre to listen to and I don't like it

**timothy444** (6): Hard to separate the music from the artist but damn, it's a decent tune

**InternetDude19** (5.7): The radio edit is better.

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): MY ENTIRE CHILDHOOD I THOUGHT FORGET YOU WAS THE ORIGINAL i have no clue why i didn‚Äôt realise til now that this is the original and forget you was made for radio, what the fuck im so dumb how have i? what? what? im so confused

**brodiepp** (5): wait i didn‚Äôt even know u could have fuck uncensored in a song title

**hikkaru** (5): didn't LOVE this song when it was big and we don't stan ceelo green anyways so...

**waluigiest** (5): when i was in 8th grade I thought this was the best song ever recorded. Now..... not so much

**jackisboredtoday** (3.3): I never really liked the corny retro throwback in this even when it was big, and now that other songs have done it better I care for it even less

**selegend** (3): pig

**bespectacIed** (2): Y'all know the loser "scrub" that TLC was singing about in No Scrubs? This is his song

**vayyiqra** (2): I like the audacity of this song, but that doesn't mean I like the song itself,  you know? Some of the vocals on this are downright awful.

**Xanleth** (1): Yeah right back at you Cee Lo.

**worlds-okayest666** (0): cee lo green is fucking trash AND this song aged like milk...a lose/lose situation

**ExtraEater** (10): It's good

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): This grew on me last year finally. I always thought it was annoying, and I still think it kinda is, but now I realized that the big pull of this song is singing along to it yourself and it makes it fun!

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (2.5): ...it‚Äôs better than ME! or Look What You Made Me Do, at least.

---

**emuu1** (11): This was very bold of me to do

**fadedblue09** (10): Swifties (and popheads) can hate on her lead singles all they want, but they‚Äôre delusional for thinking Wildest Dreams or Style has better hit potential than this. Definitely her best chart-topper.

**kappyko** (10): a career high

**ManofOranges** (10): Yes it is stupid and that's why I love it.

**poppinmmolly** (10): so fun!

**rickikardashian** (10): this is just dumb, pure, white fun. whoever hates on it, is a boring bitch

**runaway3212** (10): No hate, but Taylor has not once been able to shake things off, that said this song is still very good.

**vayyiqra** (10): Popheads hates this song. This raises the question for me: Does Popheads hate fun? The answer is: yes. This is a BOP, and it's silly, catchy, and funny. I love horns, I love how goofy the lyrics are, I love the stupid "this sick BEAT" breakdown, and overall how gloriously dumb this song is. I will die on the hill of this being an overhated and underrated song.

**InternetDude19** (9.5): What is this beat? . . . This is the sickest beat.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): OK, I actually kinda love this song. And i actually *loooove* the spoken bridge part, it's so fucking cheesy it's amazing

**starlightzone** (9.5): thered be a 9.51 there if I could just because I think of roxxxy andrew‚Äôs ass shaking when I listen to this song and it makes my day better.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): it took me awhile to actually enjoy this song but now i do i really love it. one of the things about it is that it wouldn't work if was anyone else singing it, but it works for taylor

**PointlessBibliophage** (9.1): it might be one of the weaker taylor songs, but it's iconic and i will always sing along when it comes on

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Pepperridge Farm remembers when Taylor took a successful shot at her critics. A little repetitive but dancey, fun, Taylor sells her lyrics well

**bambamhenny** (9): PMJ version outsold again

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Kinda vapid but still a bop

**themagicwemade** (9): i think about the comment that said "style is not the best song on 1989 that starts with s" and ... they're almost right, to be honest. like, objectively, this song is significantly worse than style but sometimes u just wanna blast your ex man and his new girlfriend

**1998tweety** (8.5): Def one of her weakest singles, still a bop though.

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): it's fun and it's honest, even if it might not be the best song on this rate I appreciate it

**hikkaru** (8): it's good but literally any other hit of hers from red/1989 deserves a spot on this list

**ignitethephoenix** (8): a bop is a bop even if it‚Äôs kind of annoying.

**NotnotaMotmot** (8): This is how you make an upbeat song that doesn't get draining. "Happy" take notes.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): The bridge is absolute horseshit but I'm missing this Taylor.

**Tolk1en** (8): Before I knew her well, Shake it off

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.6): (#41) I am putting this higher than Blank Space and I stand by this opinion.

**bespectacIed** (7): i **ABHORRED** this song when it was released and perhaps the reason why I don't see 1989 in rose colored glasses as much as everyone does. That spoken/cheerleader bridge??? Crime against humanity. But through the years, I've softened up to this song, mainly on the verses and chorus, and I kinda hear how it bops a lil??? And the bridge is kinda campy??? This makes me afraid that I will soften up to ME! too in a few years.

**nightjesus** (7): Like it‚Äôs a good song. It‚Äôs super catchy. But my heart will always lie with New Romantics. Pop perfection.

**skargardin** (7): A fun time idc

**vapourlomo** (7): This song is objectively bad, yet I know every single word. *shrug*

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs not as bad as we said it was

**bulforster** (5.8): I instinctively do like this but the closer you listen and the more you think about it, the worse it gets.

**starla\_** (5): this sick BEAT

**steelstepladder** (5): More like Taylor Swift still hasn't shaken off the trend of making some of her worst music lead singles

**FrankBedbroken** (4): if_you_got_haters_it_means_you_re_doing_something_right.jpg

**rhyneston3** (4): I am not a Taylor Swift fan and this did not make many points in her favour

**jackisboredtoday** (3.3): taylor has some great songs in her discography but lead singles are NOT her fort√©

**anothertown** (3): I just like...immediatley picture Hillary Clinton when this comes on? Why happening?

**bandnitos** (3): this is her worst lead single. me! is cruel summer compared to this

**camerinian** (3): really glad I'm not 18 anymore and me and my friends can stop pretending this song was ever fun

**Popfan2489** (3): Taylor‚Äôs worst song

**timothy444** (3): There's this concept in economics called "The law of diminishing marginal utility" where the more you use a good or service, the less satisfied you will be with each successive use or consumption. This law can be represented on a graph with a downward sloping trendline. It applies to almost everything and that's also the case with the way people stream music. However, in the case of 'Shake It Off', the trend line might as well be a vertical line because while the first listen is amazing, once you listen to it two or three more times, the song starts to lose its novelty and soon Shake It Off turns into this bland average-ass song that everyone agrees wasn't good at all.

**FKJVMMP** (2): I love me some Taylor Swift, I even like Reputation, but Jesus Christ is this unbelievably annoying.

**Xanleth** (2): I hate this song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (1): i think when this and all about that bass were the top 2 songs in the country is when my depression got to the point of no return.

**Roxieloxie** (0): cant believe this era gave us one of the best songs in taylors disography, too bad it isnt this one

**ExtraEater** (10): This is a whole lot of fun. It‚Äôs the song that‚Äôs the most in the spirit of the title ASTROWORLD; it‚Äôs like a psychedelic rollercoaster that goes through the House of Mirrors several times.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Still in awe with how complicated this song is. One of the best and most defining songs of the decade.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): I thought I‚Äôd be sick of this song by now, but I‚Äôm not. That‚Äôs impressive.

---

**vapourlomo** (11): I swear, this song gets more bizarre and brilliant every time I hear it. A true masterpiece

**camerinian** (10): Can‚Äôt wait to be part of the generation that mentions this when talking about how good music was back in our day

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Probably one of my favourite songs from 2018. The secret Drake and Swae feature‚Äôs (when you listened to the album for the first time), the multiple beat switches, the memes, and just the overall vibe is fantastic.

**laurent1683** (10): Trap Bohemian Rhapsody

**ManofOranges** (10): Everything about this song just works.

**muchopartymuchomoney** (10): this isn't a song it's like three completely different songs clustered in together. three amazing songs, that is.

**palengard389** (10): The ultimate hype song

**runaway3212** (10): Plain awesome

**steelstepladder** (10): BACK IN HIGHSCHOOL I USED TO BUST A LOT OF NUTS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): unironically better than bohemian rhapsody

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): three perfect songs in one.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): this sub never feels more out of touch than when its confused over why this was such a huge hit

**wavingwolves** (10): the baddest bitch. it's crazy how huge this song was if you think about how this didn't even have a real hook. it was that powerful!

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Travis and Swae murdered while Drake did okay, mind-bending and crazy dark production, interesting structure, just a bop

**bulforster** (9.5): I don't really like Drake here but the rest is so good he doesn't bring it down too much

**MrMoodle** (9.5): Unironically this generation‚Äôs bohemian rhapsody, don‚Äôt @ me

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.3): (#23) I've heard multiple critics call it the Bohemian Rhapsody of our generation. While I wouldn't go that far, I can't help but see where they're coming from.

**bespectacIed** (9): Amazing pop rap song. Deserved its success

**Hogwartsreject1912** (9): Only trap song by a man that I like.

**hunnybee12** (9): my freshman year, aka sicko mode or mo bamba every time i left my dorm

**Popfan2489** (9): sick production

**skargardin** (9): She bops

**vayyiqra** (9): I don't listen to hip-hop very much but I know a great song when I hear it. That switch in tempo after the intro is amazing, and the melody that comes in around the 3:00 mark is too. I have no idea what this song is even about, and don't need to know.

**waluigiest** (9): I was pretty unplugged when this came out, so I somehow didn‚Äôt hear it until a few months ago. But WOW what a work of art

**rhyneston3** (8.5): When did the feat. Drake get added???

**bandnitos** (8): goes off

**FKJVMMP** (8): I only like maybe a third of this song, but goddamn what a third it is.

**FrankBedbroken** (8): somehow this used to be one of my least favourites from astroworld

**hikkaru** (8): bohemian rhapsody shaking

**RandomHypnotica** (8): ngl, the only reason i like thid song are those weird bass shaking bits that kinda fucking slay

**starlightzone** (8): song is fine, I don‚Äôt hate it, I hate the album cover but that has nothing to do with my score.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): outsold Bohemian Rhapsody

**fadedblue09** (7.8): I love the instrumental and those transitions.

**MasterWizardRyan** (7.8): This rocks!

**1998tweety** (7): It ain't my kind of thing but I can see why people like it.

**Awkward\_King** (7): it‚Äôs not my favourite song ever but i do like it

**Jexan13** (7): if i appreciated rap more maybe I would be loving this

**bambamhenny** (6): i don't feel about this any particularly

**rslashpoopheads** (6): Not the Bohemian Rhapsody it think it is.

**nightjesus** (5): I‚Äôve actually never heard this song all the way. I was super confused through most of this song. I have no idea what‚Äôs happening but it‚Äôs got a good beat. I feel like if I was to listen to this more it‚Äôs gonna grow on me.

**Roxieloxie** (4): its impressive but its not for me

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): I like the intro and have nothing really to say about the rest

**Awhile2** (3): i love everyone involved with the creation of this track and somehow its still ass

**CritneySpearz** (3): I actually didn‚Äôt hear this song in its entirety until now.. Wish I still hadn‚Äôt heard it!

**timothy444** (1): SpongeBob deserved better

**Xanleth** (1): Not good.

**ExtraEater** (10): Silly fun (with a very light economic message, very light because he doesn't really say that much), and hardly much more to it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Macklemore said ‚ÄúFuck Capitalism!‚Äù in 2013 and it became the biggest song of 2013 and ever since then, the music industry had been trying to make him flop so that socialism doesn‚Äôt spread. In this essay I will

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): MAN, This has not aged well. Overhyped to hell and back.

---

**bambamhenny** (10): yes I like Macklemore

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#11) Y'all did Macklemore dirty.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Poor people anthem we stan

**ignitethephoenix** (10): invented saxophone

**ManofOranges** (10): I have a total unapologetic love for this song. This was yet another moment in culture. Also I miss Macklemore just a tiny little bit.

**nightjesus** (10): But fo real, shop at thrift shops.

**Popfan2489** (10): very funny

**poppinmmolly** (10): kings of popularizing thrift shopping! Fun fact: growing up I thought Goodwill was something only really poor people could go to. Like a food pantry or something. I had no idea anyone could shop there.

**rhyneston3** (10): I hate hipsters and Macklemore somehow made me see that they have some good ideas

**rickikardashian** (10): why do I feel like the only bitch up in here that appreciates this song for the masterpiece it is? give some respect to our cheesy rap king

**timothy444** (10): Now this is true rap. Post Malone who?

**vapourlomo** (10): I don't care; This song is perfect. AHH HE GOT THE VELCROS

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Saxophone riff of the decade right here

**ReallyCreative** (9): Goodwill regulars R I S E U P

**InternetDude19** (8.5): People still look down upon us thrift shoppers, Macklemore was a champion for our people.

**MasterWizardRyan** (8.5): This song slaps

**survivorthrowaway5** (8.3): classic, starmaker, almost meme-y - prescient in that way; Lizzo energy

**1998tweety** (8): It's catchy, the hook is nice but I don't really care for the verses.

**alwayswords** (8): invented goodwill

**hikkaru** (8): this went harder in 2013 but... it's still a classic idc idc

**skargardin** (8): Name a more iconic opening line

**ulikejazz** (8): i like the idea of this song more than i actually enjoy it

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): waddup i got a big cock

**bulforster** (7): Macklemore is the worst part of this, his flow and enunciation set me on edge for some reason. Ryan Lewis and Wanz did what they had to do though.

**Entire-Reflection** (7): shouldn‚Äôt have won the Triple J hottest 100

**FKJVMMP** (7): Has not aged well at all because Macklemore is corny as hell, but it still bangs.

**runaway3212** (7): another song I dont dislike, but never really understood the hype around.

**steelstepladder** (7): Thrift shops are fun yo

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is dumb, but fun. Too bad Macklemore's career kind of fizzled out because he had talent.

**wavingwolves** (7): wow this is actually a lot better than i remembered it being

**Xanleth** (7): Fun gimmicky rap song and Thrift shops are rad.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Lyrics, production and Macklemore's rapping alike are hit-or-miss, intriguing message though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): it's fun but we can't forgive him for robbing kendrick and kanye even if it's not his fault.

**megm26** (6.3): it‚Äôs really stupid but it‚Äôs cheesy fun

**starla\_** (6): what what what what

**bandnitos** (5): they really just showed up and immediately fell off huh

**FrankBedbroken** (5): corny and you wouldn't catch me listening to this nowadays but as a song on its own it's ok i guess

**jval888** (5): was an 8 at the time,  it's aged very poorly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): pissss

**waluigiest** (5): this did NOT grow finer with age

**Roxieloxie** (4): i blame this song for hipsters making vintage clothing expensive now

**starlightzone** (4): There are better Macklemore songs and this is the one I have to rate? I hate the lyrics, I hate the beat, I hate the entire thing, do not even start with me.

**Jexan13** (1.5): The intro should burn in hell. The hook is the only decent part of this

**anothertown** (1): piss

**bespectacIed** (1): i once gave this a 0 on the rap number ones rate but somehow another song deserves a 0 in this rate

**ExtraEater** (10): Yeah, this is how you do an inspirational song without sounding totally cheesy. I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, this is totally cheesy, but it‚Äôs pretty endearing. ‚ÄúDo you ever feel like a plastic bag?‚Äù

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Firework is very close to being on Fight Song levels of cheesy white lady anthem, but it doesn‚Äôt cross that line for me. Also, the plastic bag line is good because 1. A lone plastic bag blowing through the wind is absolutely a mood I feel sometimes and 2. It gave us this bop https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNYaw4EJpZo

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7): The stringwork on this fantastic. They really gave the A-Team in terms of production.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): THE self-empowerment anthem of the year, just the right amount of cheese to make this track victorious, the strings in the pre-chorus are everything

**bambamhenny** (10): seeing a gay couple kissing in a music video was revolutionary for my young mind

**Jexan13** (10): i remember having another breakdown because i hated being bisexual so damn much because i had fell in love with a girl and then a boy, and all I did was suffer in silence because they never knew and I.. anyways, this song helped me and its video (and having another breakdown because i never kised someone and saw that damn video and felt like a dull firework hehe)

**ignitethephoenix** (8): it‚Äôs good but basic.

**ManofOranges** (8): I do love how anthemic this song is but there's something about it that just kinda makes me not like it that much.

**poppinmmolly** (8): kinda cheesy but still a bop

**ReallyCreative** (8): why have I felt more and more like a plastic bag as my 20s have gone on why is Katy attacking me

**rickikardashian** (8): help, I can't unhear "plastic bag plastic bag plastic bag plastic bag" throughout the entire song

**runaway3212** (8): As a kid I thought that Katy called a guy Fireworks, meaning he was fun for a short time, but after that there was just darkness.

**starlightzone** (8): SEE THIS IS A GOOD KATY SONG. How hard was it for her to just keep doing Firework? It‚Äôs really nice and I think the lyrics are just really powerful.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Why did I use to think this was the most motivational song of all time 5 years ago

**themagicwemade** (8): 'CAUSE BABY YOU'RE A plastic bag

**waluigiest** (8): my dad hated this song because he said a singular ‚Äúfirework‚Äù doesn‚Äôt exist and it‚Äôs grammatically incorrect

**wavingwolves** (8): this song is a light 8 but this version of it is a strong 10 https://youtu.be/rNYaw4EJpZo

**Xanleth** (8): Pretty great.

**bulforster** (7.8): Stream Plastic Bag

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Popheads users writing their comment for this song - https://i.imgur.com/LISeIQh.png

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): The production on this is so fucking dated but it's a fun throwback.

**bandnitos** (7): the better prequel to fight song by rachel platten

**bespectacIed** (7): i'm only scoring this higher than it deserved because it's iconic but MY GOD this song's so clich√© and corny

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): (#50) Smack down the middle for me, but the video's CGI is very bad.

**rhyneston3** (7): I remember buying the music video on iTunes and just rewatching the two guys kiss at the party over and over on our family computer and somehow I thought I was hiding in the closet really well

**rosesmp3** (7): i DO feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Eh, I actually like Roar better.

**slimboyfriend** (6): U don't HAVE to feel like a waste of space u big ol dummy

**megm26** (5.9): it‚Äôs not bad it‚Äôs just so generic

**steelstepladder** (5): More like Firework a little harder to make good music

**FrankBedbroken** (4): i'm very much not a fan of faux-emotional inspirational anthems sorry

**nightjesus** (4): do you ever feel like a plastic bag floating through the wind? Side note please don‚Äôt litter save the oceans.

**FKJVMMP** (3): I cannot stand most of these types of empowerment anthems, but this one‚Äôs at least got some energy to it.

**palengard389** (3): Love Katy but this is one is just not good

**Roxieloxie** (3): this has kinda been overplayed to death for me im sorrry

**ExtraEater** (10): Big nostalgia on this one. RIP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): RIP :-(

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (5): I was never big on this song and I point all the blame at human foghorn Aloe Blacc. Thank god he didn‚Äôt end up becoming a thing. (Also RIP Avicii)

---

**racloves** (11): it‚Äôs not very popheads of me but I‚Äôm giving my 11 to the legend RIP

**1998tweety** (10): Massive bop, rest in peace king.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#5) Avicii is the best mainstream EDM producer of the 2010s.

**fadedblue09** (10): Wow EDM can actually be decent??

**ManofOranges** (10): Avicii was one of the few EDM guys from the time when EDM was all the rage that I could tolerate and actually enjoy more often than not, and for that I have to give him props.

**Roxieloxie** (10): I dont listen to this song alot anymore but this song made me aware of Aloe Blacc who has some bops. Also this is one of the few songs where the acoustic and EDM version both go with the vibe of the song

**skargardin** (10): The EDM song of the decade if we're not counting Levels. Avicii will be forever missed but never forgotten, what a legend.

**starlightzone** (10): this could have easily been an 11 too. I think it‚Äôs such a powerful and strong song, and just blasts out and makes you feel fucking alive. You can‚Äôt listen to this song without feeling like you can do anything, and I fully believe that PERIODT.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): one of the few good edm hits

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): :(

**timothy444** (10): It's such a great combination of folk and electronic dance music! I love Aloe Blacc's vocals too! Avicii nailed it on this one and now that he's passed away, it makes this song so much bittersweet.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): an EDM classic.

**Entire-Reflection** (9): Rest In Piece

**hikkaru** (9): not my fave avicii song but it's still very good

**bandnitos** (8): this just makes me sad now :(((

**steelstepladder** (8): More like I miss Avicii :/

**themagicwemade** (8): i started to love this song because of the kidz bop version asdkfaskdf

**megm26** (7.9): rest in peace

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): one of the best entries in the subgenre of EDM songs with vaguely philosophical lyrics that kinda mean nothing but can feel like they mean everything

**InternetDude19** (7.5): Avici was always one of the better edm guys.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.2): My memory of this song was just how much it was overplayed, but its impact in terms of mainsteam EDM was huge and I can‚Äôt deny it.

**vayyiqra** (7): I don't *really* like any part of this song except the instrumental break and "Levels" is better but it's a good song despite that. RIP Avicii. :(

**rhyneston3** (6): Unless it‚Äôs Timber, country EDM is not my fav

**runaway3212** (6): Never got the hype around this one.

**stickywheels46** (6): r.i.p, gone too soon

**vapourlomo** (6): This reminds me of freshman year of college. That year was miserable. I could go without hearing this one again

**waluigiest** (6): I think this is bland tbh

**Xanleth** (6): WAKE ME UP INSIIIIIIIIIIIIIIDE

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): (RIP Tim) Interesting but ultimately botched fusion of country and EDM is only lifted by Aloe's raspy singing and pretty decent hook that precedes the pretty bad breakdown

**FKJVMMP** (5): It‚Äôs fine but I can‚Äôt really appreciate any folktronica after hearing Stolen Dance (which would have been my 11 if America had any taste and it‚Äôd been on the list). It just can‚Äôt compare.

**FrankBedbroken** (5): this hasn't aged as well as say, levels, for instance, aloe blacc is fine enough but idk the melody just isn't as appealing imo

**rslashpoopheads** (5): I guess we're letting anyone on this list now.

**bespectacIed** (3): r.i.p. but i can't stand this yeehaw EDM hybrid. Levels deserved its success

**gannade** (3): RIP but this was not good

**nightjesus** (3): This song reminds me of a lot of messy drunk nights. It goes hard when drunk off cheap wine.

**kappyko** (2): the drop is the worst part. interesting to see how aloe blacc codes as country here. remember when aloe blacc's "the man" received radio play?

**ExtraEater** (10): A killer R&B tune that still sounds as fresh and summery as it did on release. Great music video, too. Very surprised it struggled to even be anywhere near the Top 10 in this rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I really stanned this hard when the music video came out. I obviously moved on from it, but this is still a great pop song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Her only good song.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh what a bop. I remember listening to this once when it dropped, listening to OMG once (fitting that it's right underneath), and then going back to Havana for like 30 listens.

**hikkaru** (10): that was a classic.... throwback to when popheads loved this song and camila and were begging for them to succeed

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): The Kidz Bop versi√≥n is unironically better.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is a hit, plain and simple.

**palengard389** (10): Catchiest song of the decade imo

**rhyneston3** (10): So good! This was one of my favourite songs of 2017/2018

**rslashpoopheads** (10): An absolute bop.

**runaway3212** (10): This song just works.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): I used to despise Camila so bad, until I saw her do one (1) live performance of this, and I don't know how she just appeared on my good book

**starlightzone** (9.1): The .1 is for that music video. I hate that cover for the album dear god. The song is full on slow and sultry that I just don‚Äôt think hits in a way I was expecting when I first heard it (My first Camila song was Crying In The Club AND THAT‚ÄôS A 10).

**camerinian** (9): Thugga got a #1 single and I won't let anyone forget it, and Camila is here also

**ignitethephoenix** (9): so can we confirm that Camilla definitely peaked with this song

**InternetDude19** (9): I'm glad that Jeffery graduated.

**Tolk1en** (9): Without Young Thug it was an instant 10 for me. Unfortunately popheads hate Camila and this song will be robbed.

**Awkward\_King** (8): i always expect to hear ‚Äòhavana but it‚Äôs off key‚Äô everytime it starts i‚Äôve listened to it so many times

**fadedblue09** (8): Used to hate this, but I don‚Äôt mind it now.

**ReallyCreative** (8): Banana oo nana this morning I ate a banana oo nana oops I'm allergic to bananas oo nana

**timothy444** (8): I don't know what's cringier: me associating this song with a Star Vs. The Forces Of Evil AMA or the fact that I'm actually liking a song that was co-written by Pharrell Williams

**waluigiest** (8): love this song but she‚Äôs still canceled please don‚Äôt forget

**megm26** (7.9): this would be so much better without the rap verse i have no idea what he‚Äôs saying

**alwayswords** (7.5): the version without young thug outsold

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): the good: young thug has a #1 hit. the bad: this song being in every other commercial and award show and radio station and just inescapable. the ugly: camila cabello's racist past.

**bandnitos** (7): its a fun song im surprised that it hit number one though like i did not see that coming

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7): (#49) I always heard it at Louisianna, and questioned if it was the same guy with the mattress from Bolder

**CritneySpearz** (7): pop girls stop having unnecessary rap features challenge

**skargardin** (7): Young Thug ATE this song

**Xanleth** (7): Good stuff.

**FrankBedbroken** (6): JEFFERY JUST GRADUATED

**wavingwolves** (6): this was massively overplayed but i still enjoy it a little. it's an okay song

**survivorthrowaway5** (5.1): basic

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Thugger really the only saving grace of this song; Camila is uncharismatic and annoying (and bad!) as a singer and the instrumental is disposable

**FKJVMMP** (5): Camilla Cabello has a Capaldi-level horrible voice, but at least the beat‚Äôs good and Young Thug is fun.

**vayyiqra** (5): ooh nah nah banana ooh nah nah As catchy as this song is, it's really not good. That piano line is so repetitive, Young Thug's rap verse is boring, and the lyrics get old fast. It does have a lot of strong hooks, but Camila has better songs ("Crying In the Club" deserved better, or even "Never Be the Same" is better than this). Like most of her music, it's so mediocre, and it's frustrating because I like her voice and want her to make good music.

**nightjesus** (4): Young Thug‚Äôs rap has never ever made sense to me. It‚Äôs so out of place.

**steelstepladder** (4): Camila Cabello and releasing songs that are a weak four out of ten. Name a better combo.

**anothertown** (3): The unofficial song of ubers, drugstores, waiting rooms,

**bulforster** (3): A guy I was really not into tried to make a move on me to this song so now it puts me in a state of fight or flight. Todd in the Shadows also pointed out that the chorus sounds like it's sung by a minion which does make it funnier but not better.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZzQMwN7Us8

**bespectacIed** (1): Massive hit, one of the most inescapably catchy songs of recent times. But she's still racist :(

**Roxieloxie** (1): I was a party and this song came on and this latina girl turned to me and said "we dont claim her"

**ExtraEater** (10): We love a song associated with one of the best animated movies of the decade, if not the best! (Song of the Sea gives it hefty competition)

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse is the best animated movie this decade and is arguably more creative than every movie Disney has released in the past 50 years and you are not able to change my mind on this.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6.5): This song is *just* on the edge of being good for me.

---

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Love this song too much to acknowledge its flaws, Swae Lee has so much personality, the production is great and it's catchy as hell

**bambamhenny** (10): Stan Miles Morales, the superior spider-man and stan animated superhero movies

**FKJVMMP** (10): This is being the big spoon, in song form.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Only because of Spider-Man is it getting a 10. Otherwise, I‚Äôd probably give it an 8.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Spider-Man continues to bring good things to this world

**Jexan13** (10): I remember searching for this song in Wikipedia and seeing that one of its genres is Dream Pop. Choice, but it is a dream.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): This here is a vibe song

**Roxieloxie** (10): really mad that it was my favorite movie ever that made me learn what austin sounds like when he's singing. I hadn't heard this prior to seeing spiderverse so i associate this song with the first time i saw the movie, which was literally the one of the most magical night of my life. Its a cute song but my extreme love of the movie really pushes it over the edge for me

**timothy444** (10): Funny how a song from a kids movie can chart so high. Dope af

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.9): (#16) from the movie Spiderman: Into the Spiderverse. If you weren't aware. This is acceptance, if you're still keeping track of the 5 Stages of Post Malone Grief.

**starla\_** (9.5): my most played song of 2019, and it‚Äôs so low key i didn‚Äôt even notice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): ok so in the hip-hop number 1‚Äôs rate i gave this like a 6 and said it wasn‚Äôt anything special and. past me you were so wrong this song is such a bop

**bandnitos** (9): a cute song also y'all should really watch into the spiderverse

**rhyneston3** (9): This song somehow doesn‚Äôt seem to suffer from the overplay effect

**runaway3212** (9): The best song by both artist

**steelstepladder** (9): More like fun-flower cause it's a bop!

**vapourlomo** (9): I love that Post Malone's best song by far is also his biggest hit

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): in swae we trust

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): I'm actually surprised how much I liked this maybe Posty is a pop girl

**fadedblue09** (8.2): Had no idea it was THIS big, but hey, it‚Äôs fun.

**hunnybee12** (8): the music video just reminded me how amazing that movie is

**skargardin** (8): Some.. questionable lyrics drags down the score a lil but it does bop

**starlightzone** (8): It‚Äôs a fine song but I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs anything extraordinary. It just doesn‚Äôt hit anything powerful for me. However, I like their melodies together, it‚Äôs a very soothing set of vocals.

**waluigiest** (8): a good song, but I‚Äôm surprised it had such nuts staying power beyond Spiderverse

**wavingwolves** (8): one of the most pleasant songs to listen to

**ggal2020** (7.8): no joke, my campaign walk on music for high school VP

**bulforster** (7.6): Bit too much reverb for my liking and Posty's voice sounds worryingly damaged.

**1998tweety** (7.5): This another one of those songs that I don't really get why everyone gags over cause to me it's just alright. Never been a huge fan of Swae Lee though, I could see myself bumping this up to an 8.5 if it was just Post.

**PointlessBibliophage** (7.5): it's fine although i just don't see why of all posty songs it's this one that got award nominations and shit.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Hate Post Malone but this song really grew on me

**Awkward\_King** (7): main pop boys of the 2020s

**FrankBedbroken** (7): it's actually quite nice! not the biggest fan of either artist, but idk it's an enjoyable tune all around!

**hikkaru** (7): it's cute but that's kinda it... i get why it had so much longevity but it's also really mid

**vayyiqra** (7): I don't really like Post Malone and wasn't into this song until the chorus hit, and it is very pretty on god.

**bloupp** (6): Idk, I don't get the hype for this song. It's good but not #11 of the decade good.

**camerinian** (6): most overrated song of 2019. It's a nice vibe but, like, nothing more than that

**kappyko** (6): post malone's best pre-circles. wish circles was here honestly

**themagicwemade** (6): i saw spiderverse 5 times but i still couldn't remember what this song sounded like until i listened to it for this rate

**Xanleth** (6): Pretty chill song but it was the worst part of Spiderverse.

**ManofOranges** (5): I really don't like this. It's just annoying to me. I don't think it's totally terrible, but it lost a few extra points because Miles singing it in into the spiderverse puts me on edge.

**nightjesus** (5): I get it. Stoners would love this song. As I honesty have no idea how this song had been charted for so long. It‚Äôs so average. It‚Äôs a classic mumble rap song to me. Is it because Post Malone is on the song? Like I don‚Äôt get it. It‚Äôs also so short which, tea, is probably why it‚Äôs charted so well.

**1000\_nights** (4): Every time I listen to this, I forget that I'm actually listening to music. It's very impressive how empty it is.

**anothertown** (4): Softboy music

**CritneySpearz** (4): Post Malone‚Äôs voice is so grating to my ears in almost every song of his ugh‚Ä¶ just can‚Äôt get into it

**Popfan2489** (4): boring

**rslashpoopheads** (3): Where's the melody?

**palengard389** (2): Overrated song from an overrated movie

**bespectacIed** (1): Every fibre of my body hates Post Malone and I will forever resist the love of this sub for him

**ExtraEater** (9): I could think of a lot of trades for songs that should be in the Decade-End Chart, but trading ‚ÄúCheap Thrills‚Äù for ‚ÄúChandelier‚Äù is definitely the #1 swap I have on my mind. That being said, this is good

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): Holy shit I forgot this song existed.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): This is THE generic trop pop song in my opinion. There‚Äôs no personality, a generic ass beat (which became the building block for so many other generic beats after it), and I don‚Äôt know why you would listen to it willingly if you weren‚Äôt in a club or grocery store. If people drag Shape of You, I would expect they would also drag this too.

**dlstantdreamer** (10): Sia and Sean Pail broke RECORDS with this song. It‚Äôs much well deserved and I am glad Rihanna ended up rejecting it because she would have paid this dust.

**ManofOranges** (10): During the music video, at the very end when everybody's doing the time warp, I can't help unsee the fact that one of the dancers messes up and it's very obvious. Irregardless, this song hits. Even Sean Paul's part.

**Mudkip1** (10): i love cheap thrills

**rhyneston3** (9.5): Sean Paul has an almost perfect feature record, Nicki who?

**bandnitos** (9): sia deserved this number one and sean paul's a fun addition

**runaway3212** (9): Sia is a good songwriter and a good singer, meaning most of her songs are just good.

**Tolk1en** (9): I miss Sia so much. There is something special around her as an artist, an aura, something I can't describe

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): the Sean Paul feature just ain‚Äôt it sis

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): idc what you hoes say Sean Paul‚Äôs verse is good

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): Chandelier deserved this spot on the list, but I‚Äôll take the cute generic bop that I most associate with the word ‚Äúbop‚Äù out of any song

**1998tweety** (8): Erm..it's alright.

**gannade** (8): i gave an extra 5 points for sean paul. up wid it guuurl

**rickikardashian** (8): honestly, as much as I don't have any strong feeling about this song, I gotta give it to Sia, She created possibly one of the most overplayed songs ever and I don't despise it because if it

**starla\_** (8): why did she have to add sean paul to a perfectly good song

**starlightzone** (8): I‚Äôm as big a Sean Paul fan as any other pop head but I think the song is better without him. I prefer the original, and don‚Äôt think he adds anything really worthwhile.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (7.5): (#43) I swear I only remember this song exists for 5 minutes while listening to it, then it goes back to the void.

**hikkaru** (7.5): it's cute but chandelier deserved instead

**anothertown** (7): I love Sean Paul features

**bespectacIed** (7): The solo is so much better. Still bops.

**steelstepladder** (7): Another perfect seven that just stays solid no matter how much I listen to it

**timothy444** (7): Can Sean Paul not ruin every song he touches? Sia would've gotten a higher score if he wasn't in it.

**vayyiqra** (7): Maybe trop-pop made some points, but Sia has better songs in the 2010s, and also Sean Paul adds nothing and is kind of annoying here.

**waluigiest** (7): Sean Paul existing on this list is bonkers

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Sean Paul absolutely ruins the song and it's a little generic, but it's catchy and dancey as hell

**rslashpoopheads** (6.5): it's fine but a #1?

**Jexan13** (6): omg girl be playing with the insects in Beyonce's basement for free

**kappyko** (6): remember when popheads fucking loved this song

**skargardin** (6): Has Sean Paul ever improved a song? I think not

**themagicwemade** (6): who is sean paul and what is the appeal of sounding Like That

**Awhile2** (5): bitta bang bang oh wait wrong song

**nightjesus** (5): Yo I need money tho.

**Xanleth** (5): It‚Äôs fine.

**camerinian** (4): I just can't listen to this out and out trop pop anymore. I'm sorry, Sia. It's not you, it's Ed

**fadedblue09** (3.8): And here we have another mediocre song made by a popheads fave. Will popheads continue to stay delusional or will they come to their senses?

**InternetDude19** (3): Without Sean Paul this song is lifeless, and I still don't like it with Sean Paul.

**wavingwolves** (3): i don't like shape of you so of course i also don't like this

**ExtraEater** (10): A little better than We Are Young, which is still good. I distinctly remember Some Nights appearing on one /r/popheads thread about epic songs and the comment that mentioned it got a lot of upvotes. For some reason, I expected popheads to like it more based purely on that.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Nate Reuss is a soldier and has a mental breakdown for 5 minutes, complete with marching drums, soaring backing vocals, and an autotune solo, aka a perfect song.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (9): Man, fun. really brought a sense of bombast that we don‚Äôt really get anymore.

---

**camerinian** (11): this song is gloriously ridiculous and nonsensical and I love every second of it. I love the fact that they crammed basically every idea that they could in, from the massive harmonies to the marching band beat to the beautiful piano passages to the soaring guitar solos to the Kanye-esque autotune solo. All of that led by Nate Reuss who I miss hearing sing so bad, and he sells every note with glorious overblown conviction. This was what I hoped indie pop would always sound like, and that's not even remotely what happened but I'm glad we have this anyway. Magical

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Definitely my favorite fun. song and started my long running love of thing Jack Antonoff is involved in. A great song to scream along to at the end of a long, hard night.

**TiltControls** (11): when people think of the indie boom of the early 2010's this should be the song they think of

**1998tweety** (10): Robbed kings. The bridge is a bit odd but this song still goes off hard.

**Awkward\_King** (10): it‚Äôs basic but i just fucking love it

**bespectacIed** (10): I forgot how fantastic this album is. I miss fun :( Jack and Nate get your petty asses together and ~~have an intense all-night no-homo fuck session~~ make a new fun. album,,, goddamnit!

**CarlieScion** (10): also close to being my 11

**ComeOnPupperfish** (10): (#3) Y'all are gonna do him so dirty, I'm already ashamed.

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): Outsold We Are Flops.

**InternetDude19** (10): I've loved this since the first time I heard it.

**ManofOranges** (10): This is fun.'s magnum opus to me. Each and every aspect of this song proves to me that fun. was, to put it simply, that bitch.

**rhyneston3** (10): I could listen to that opening on repeat for at least 8 minutes

**rickikardashian** (10): so you hate on autotuned voice solo here, but when Coraline Polish Check does it it's fine? mmmmmm i smell misandry

**runaway3212** (10): fun. was such a weird period in pop music, but their songs are both awesome.

**skargardin** (10): Iconic

**starlightzone** (10): okay listen this song makes me cry I don‚Äôt want to explain why any further I think it‚Äôs so beautiful okay sO BEAUTFIUL.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I listened to the censored version of this song for so long that whenever I play the normal version I have a mini heart attack when I hear Nate Ruess say Fuck

**timothy444** (10): Majestic and one of the best tracks in this list. 2012 really was such a magnificent year in music and every single element here comes together in a big fire of glory! Some Nights is definitely going to remembered as one of the most legendary singles to ever chart in the future!

**jackisboredtoday** (9.6): This grew on me so much, I didn‚Äôt like it when it was big but by the end of the decade it was one of my favorite rock songs of the decade

**bambamhenny** (9): idc i like the auto tune

**ggal2020** (9): absolutely blasted this shit from my mom‚Äôs iphone 3

**hikkaru** (9): this is better than we are young idc

**vapourlomo** (9): Best Queen song since 1982

**waluigiest** (9): I LOVE FUN. Nate wanted to be Freddie Mercury so bad! A well written, well performed song. The song is like 50% bridge, which works until the ‚Äúterrible nights/lies‚Äù part

**nightjesus** (8.5): THIS IS IT BOIS THIS IS WAR!

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): one of my favorite songs at the time. would be cool if fun gave it another shot.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Uniquely anthemic, great snare drums and guitar riffs throughout, Nate's singing is nice and impassioned but the falsetto 3/4 of the way is slightly distracting

**FKJVMMP** (8): To this day I have no idea what‚Äôs going on in this song at all. It‚Äôs a glorious mess.

**Roxieloxie** (8): i cant give this the 10 i want to because i still know the chorus of the cursed 2012 tumblr version and i would like to forget

**steelstepladder** (8): More like most nights this is a banger

**vayyiqra** (8): I used to hate this song, because I hate "whoa-oh-whoa" vocals and thought it was in the same vein of boring indie-ish pop as Mumford and Sons (still the worst band of the last decade). Now it's grown on me, especially since I find the lyrics more relatable now that I know what it's like to have existential crises in the middle of the night. Last year I was having them several times a week for a while. Is all of adulthood like this? I really hope not.

**rslashpoopheads** (7.5): Better than We Are Young.

**wavingwolves** (7.5): idk why but every fun. song makes me incredibly emotional

**kappyko** (7): maximalism at its best - people will beg for "maximalist pop" and mean the most expired fake dr luke beats. this is what maximalism in pop really is

**Xanleth** (7): A much better song from fun.

**bulforster** (6.7): The chorus is great but I really dislike Nate Ruess' voice, especially when it's not layered and it does not lend itself well to that autotune solo.

**bandnitos** (6): why did they make a war movie into a song

**FrankBedbroken** (6): the autotuned squeal breakdown doesn't work for me

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Disastrous. Idk how you Americans managed to afford to give them another hit. Dope outro though.

**anothertown** (4): They clearly tried to do a big magnum opus type of song but none of it works. I hate the production on the duplicated vocals and I HATE ‚Äúhere they come again to jack my style‚Äù

**ReallyCreative** (3.5): I need ibuprofen

**Awhile2** (1): im really happy i hardly remember this song

**NotnotaMotmot** (1): Even though they got rid of the autotune shrill in the middle of the song, this song still gives me major anxiety anticipating that horrid sound. Quite possibly the worst thing that has ever happened in a pop song.

**MrMoodle** (0): This song makes me feel like the unenthusiastic kid at a school camp receiving a firm, but mostly disappointed scolding from a teacher because I won‚Äôt join in and be part of the community. Nate Ruess‚Äô conviction and determination grates me real bad. It makes me understand the perspective of the bully who calls people tryhards for caring about anything. He‚Äôs just putting in so much effort. He‚Äôs so intense. And then I feel like an asshole for thinking like that. This song hits a nerve for me.

**ExtraEater** (10): A total jam that‚Äôs more immediate and probably better than Thrift Shop. Thrift Shop is a little iffy with its message and the sax can put some people off, but there‚Äôs no arguing with a straightforward banger like Can‚Äôt Hold Us.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A song with a bigger impact than all of Good Kid Maad City! ~~jk don‚Äôt come after me heterosexuals~~

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Macklemore‚Äôs best song. He should‚Äôve kept making this song for the rest of his career.

---

**ComeOnPupperfish** (11): (#1) ... This will be a very hot take in popheads, but this might be my favorite song of all time? It's for sure up there. It's just so full of energy, such a good vibe, puts me in such a good mood! Yeah, the ceiling can't hold me! I got this! It's anthemic, it pumps me up when I need it, and I know Macklemore's verse by heart. The best song in the 2010s Year End, for sure.

**bambamhenny** (10): the horns bitch

**camerinian** (10): this isn't even close to what hip hop sounds like now and it's only gonna date worse in the future but holy fuck does it still bang hard

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I have always thought this is better than thrift shop and I still think that

**InternetDude19** (10): Macklemore's peak.

**Jexan13** (10): How Big, How Blue, How Beautiful but make it rap and straight

**ManofOranges** (10): This is Macklemore's best track ever. It's probably one of the best hype anthem's of all time and the energy just keeps building. I feel thrilled whenever this song plays.

**poppinmmolly** (10): they did this song twice when I saw them live!

**rickikardashian** (10): every rate with Mack I'll say this, if you're reading this, please come back, I want goofy fun bops to come back

**timothy444** (10): One of the most catchiest and energetic songs of the decade

**vapourlomo** (10): The anthem for every Seattle sports team. That alone makes it a classic

**1998tweety** (9): Massive bop, super catchy and has several iconic lines.

**hikkaru** (9): issa bop but it goes on for a bit too long

**hunnybee12** (9): i'm sorry

**ReallyCreative** (9): Ray Dalton's lowkey the highlight of this song, I love this vocals on this

**starlightzone** (9): THE BETTER Macklemore song from this album. Can‚Äôt Hold Us is just a power play of a song with a fast lyric and a powerful movement that just rocks your goddamn soul you dumb bitch.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): Deserved to be bigger than Thrift Shop

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): i know macklemore‚Äôs corny but that piano riff is SO buoyant and the hook is great‚Ä¶ this gets me bouncing every time without fail

**rhyneston3** (8): Macklemore is so hot

**skargardin** (8): banger

**steelstepladder** (8): Macklemore is better than a lot of people give him credit for

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Slaps thanks to Ryan's production, love the metallic piano chords and stomping percussion, Macklemore's rapping is okay and more hits than misses

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): macklemore's best song, not that that's saying much.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (7.5): lowkey a bop

**megm26** (7.3): this is a banger

**nightjesus** (7): Damn Macklemore can really slay a rap though.

**yourfacesucksass** (7): Indifferent about this song, yet I don‚Äôt like it‚Ä¶.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): junior midwestern prom vibes

**bespectacIed** (6): bop

**FKJVMMP** (6): Macklemore‚Äôs still corny as shit but it‚Äôs fun.

**runaway3212** (6): Macklemore has really done a lot of good things, but I never really liked his two biggest hits.

**vayyiqra** (6): This song is either too chaotic or I'm too tired for it right now but I kind of like it. That trumpet melody is really good - I feel like I know it from somewhere.

**bandnitos** (5): do you need to call a repairman

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Best left at sports games.

**waluigiest** (5): good bridge and chorus but the Macklemore part is not it

**Xanleth** (5): Meh.

**fadedblue09** (3): Sedated Thrift Shop redeemed by Ray Dalton‚Äôs hook.

**Roxieloxie** (3): @my middle school crush, fuck you

**Awhile2** (0): normally id give this song a one instead of a zero but the fact that white people still insist on putting this horrible song on at every function makes me loathe it with a passion. at least most terrible songs have been somewhat forgotten and can be ignored

**ExtraEater** (10): E.E.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (7.5): The solo version is better.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): ET is easily the worst Teenage Dream single, so the fact that this made it to late day 3 boggles my mind. Especially cause we are rating the KANYE WEST REMIX with lines such as ‚ÄúThey callin' me an alien, a big headed astronaut/Maybe it's because ya boy Yeezy get ass a lot‚Äù and ‚ÄúPockets on Shrek, rockets on deck/Tell me what's next? Alien sex.‚Äù You guys said this was a better song than Sicko Mode and Airplanes??? What is wrong with you guys.

---

**bambamhenny** (10): this song was used in so many fanvids/amvs back then

**bespectacIed** (10): An improvement to the original imo, even though Kanye's verses are gross (although I think that was the point, alien sex was meant to be very invasive and gross). E.T. is one of my katherine's best hits, it just STICKS.

**bloupp** (10): Kanye delivered us one of the most iconic lines in history and we will forever be in his debt for doing so. The song is ok too I guess.

**gannade** (10): Remix is a 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favs even with Kanye‚Äôs verse

**Jexan13** (10): The Kanye version is not superior in any way

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is ventures into so bad it's good territory for me.

**Mudkip1** (10): i dont care for kanyes verse but the rest of the song slaps

**palengard389** (10): ‚ÄúPockets on Shrek!‚Äù Still a great song though

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): yes give it to me alien daddy

**rhyneston3** (10): I like the non-Kanye version more but this one still slaps hard

**rickikardashian** (10): ***A L I E N   S E X***

**skargardin** (10): That was a classic

**starla\_** (10): katy‚Äôs biggest banger

**vayyiqra** (10): Another overhated classic on Popheads. Yes, this song is silly - it's called camp, maybe you've heard of it. It's also a genius pop song.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i used to hate on this version but it kinda slaps! Maybe alien sex made some points

**1998tweety** (9.5): Ugh what a bop. Twelve year old me got my life from this song so many times. Lyrics are iconic af

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Kanye lifts and drags this song down, but freakish and overall intriguing and fun instrumental, cool theme for a love song

**jackisboredtoday** (9.4): I think this is still the best thing Katy ever released, the beat is so cool

**DrunkHurricane** (9): why did this need a Kanye verse

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): didnt commas jack off to this

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): still goes super hard.

**timothy444** (9): Alien sex? Yes please!

**hikkaru** (8.5): the worst teenage dream single

**survivorthrowaway5** (8.5): we will rock you; underrated

**anothertown** (8): I hope this is what people in the 2060s or whatever think of when they think of typical 2010s music

**GiftoftheGeek** (8): Love Kanye or hate him, the "big-headed astronaut" line is brilliant

**Hogwartsreject1912** (8): The original would be a 10

**InternetDude19** (8): Getting Kanye for the remix would be like if Taylor got Drake for a Cruel Summer remix, instead of like . . . Swae Lee or Big Sean or something. A huge pop collaboration.

**rslashpoopheads** (8): That bridge tho

**themagicwemade** (8): hot take but the kanye verse MAKES this song. "tell me what's next alien sex" god his fucking mind

**megm26** (7.1): a l i e n  s e x

**bandnitos** (7): alien sex

**kappyko** (7): if you think about it very hard it's racist

**MasterWizardRyan** (7): I like it despite Kanye‚Äôs lyrics...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): insert ‚Äútell me what‚Äôs next alien sex‚Äù joke here

**waluigiest** (7): the taylor swift beef is so deep......

**Xanleth** (7): Forgot this song existed but it‚Äôs pretty good.

**MrMoodle** (6.9): Why are Katy Perry features always so iconic? Can‚Äôt decide between ‚Äútell me what‚Äôs next? Alien sex‚Äù and ‚Äúshe‚Äôll eat your heart out, like Jeffrey Dahmer‚Äù.

**bulforster** (6.8): This is actually better than I remember but Kanye still has some real clunkers in his lyrics, as iconic as they may be.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): KISS. ME. K-K-KISS ME. PS: "Pockets on Shrek...?"

**vapourlomo** (6.5): One of Katy's weaker singles from her imperial phase, and arguably Kanye's worst verse. Still kind of bangs?

**fadedblue09** (6): It‚Äôs...not bad, but I will forever be surprised this is one of her biggest hits.

**FrankBedbroken** (6): this suffers from the same problems as radioactive but the ridiculousness works in its favor

**starlightzone** (6): what did Kanye add to this song. Not that it was amazing before hand but it was definitely worth a 7.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): that Kanye verse really is something huh

**ComeOnPupperfish** (4.5): (#78) :yikes:

**FKJVMMP** (4): It‚Äôs too weird to really dislike, even though it is bad. Like, who made the decision to let one of the biggest stars in music release this? Baffling.

**nightjesus** (4): I was never a super big fan of the original and Kanye‚Äôs verse just makes it worse.

**runaway3212** (4): The hook is pretty weak and the rest doesn't help

**steelstepladder** (4): More like Extra Tarestri-ass

**wavingwolves** (4): it's wild to think that katy and kanye had a song together and it was this bad

**alwayswords** (3.5): this is already one of the weaker singles off teenage dream but it‚Äôs also the kanye version...

**CarlieScion** (3): alien sex

**ReallyCreative** (3): Katy's delivery in the chorus is the only thing saving this song, she's good but this whole thing is such a mess

**Roxieloxie** (3): im just, no

**camerinian** (2): pockets on Shrek

**ExtraEater** (10): Just the whole narrative surrounding this song, which is a major bop, just had me rooting non-stop for Lil Nas X. He is a blessing

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): Best meme hit ever. Also Billy Ray Cyrus is unironically the best part of this song.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Gay icon Lil Nas X blocking Taylor Swift‚Äôs weird, pandering, shoddily written attempt at a gay anthem is honestly one of the most culturally significant moments of the century.

---

**MrMoodle** (11): At first, I thought of Old Town Road as a big, dumb meme. A funny one, but a meme nonetheless, and hence, its wild popularity was something I found rather perplexing. But on my thousandth listen, something clicked. Really, don‚Äôt we all wish we could go back to the old town road, ride ‚Äòtill we can‚Äôt no more? Lil Nas X‚Äôs longing for a return of foregone days truly captures the bittersweet nostalgia which permeates a post-Trump world - whether that be in clinging to the elusive notion of a once ‚Äúgreat‚Äù America, or merely a wistful nostalgia for a simpler time, one before the ever-looming threat of climate change. As a people, we have been forced to develop a thick shell, as Billy Ray ponders on - ‚Äúgot no stress, I‚Äôve been through all that / I‚Äôm like the Marlboro man so I kick on back‚Äù - the Marlboro man, of course, reflecting an ideal of manhood, always laid-back, even in times of immense pressure. However, even for Billy, beneath that hardened exterior, built to protect himself from a rapidly changing world, is that of a boy, a boy who merely desires the honest joy of riding his horse ‚Äòtill he can‚Äôt no more. Old Town Road is a wonder. Lil Nas X is one of the greatest thinkers of our time.

**Roxieloxie** (11): another song i unironically fuck with. The grammy performance was a serve and if you dont think so you are old and jaded, i already know this is gonna out on day 4 but oh well.  also sense we last rated i've fallen in love with his EP and am  a  lil nas x stan

**TragicKingdom1** (11): one of the two real 11 contenders for me, and the song i eventually settled on. watching the grammy performance of this really made me realize just how attached i am to this song. so much of my thought over the past year has gone into every aspect of this song and i've enjoyed every second of it. it really just perfectly captures the fun but also meaning of pop music to me.

**bambamhenny** (10): we stan a gay cowboy and a true hustler

**bandnitos** (10): i am so afraid of y'all tearing this song to shreds

**bespectacIed** (10): The mixing of two wildly different genres to make the biggest hit in existence is nothing short of genius. Lil Nas X i live to serve you king, i just want a crumb of your throbbing c- \*mic gets cut off\*

**bloupp** (10): Deserves top 10 but y'all hoes are gonna take it out the first day, just watch

**camerinian** (10): protect Lil Nas at all costs

**Hogwartsreject1912** (10): I didn‚Äôt realize how much of a bop it was till the Grammys performance.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the fact this is number 7 on the decade end list and it was only around for a year, we have to stan Lil Nas X and Billie Ray

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): it's iconic what can i say

**steelstepladder** (10): I'm ride or die for Old Town Road and I will never give up on it

**stickywheels46** (10): The one song that united America in 2019

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): ended racism AND homophobia

**untutorable** (10): billy ray snapped on this don't act like he didn't

**vapourlomo** (10): This was *this close* to getting my 11. Dangerously perfect song.

**wavingwolves** (10): i love seeing videos of little kids singing this song with their whole souls and for being able to provide this much pure happiness this song is a 10

**ComeOnPupperfish** (9.6): (#18) I am too scared to give any takes on this song other than 'this is very good'.

**bulforster** (9): Nas' verses are the only thing that hold it back for me, now if were rating Cupcakke's Old Town Hoe...

**FKJVMMP** (9): For cultural impact alone. It‚Äôs also just really good but it‚Äôs way more of a pop culture event than a song.

**megm26** (9): deserved to be #1 for how long it did, it‚Äôs such a fun banger

**nightjesus** (9): Lil Nas X is a treasure that I hope soars. And good on Billy Ray Cyrus. Like it really rightfully topped off the 2010‚Äôs that the longest number one song of all time on the Billboard charts is a meme song featuring Papa Cyrus. It‚Äôs almost poetic. Shout out to black artists featuring the number one spot back to back. Rightfully deserved.

**runaway3212** (9): A honestly very bold song that I love

**waluigiest** (9): I am thankful that this cultural moment happened. We are better for it

**rickikardashian** (8.6): I really want lil nas to be successful this next decade. I know he won't top the success of OTR (because I honestly don't think anything will be able to do so) but the guy seems like such a good dude and we could truly use more LGBTQ+ representation of color

**alwayswords** (8): the best version

**FrankBedbroken** (8): recency bias probably but it's still fun to listen to idk

**hikkaru** (8): for some reason the radio here only ever played the original version as opposed to the remix which is completely baffling to me... the remix is so much better. billy's verse and the final chorus where they sing together... chef's kiss

**Jexan13** (8): i remember hearing this song when it was just a meme, with a Red Dead Redemption music video, thinking it was interesting but the vocals too offputting (yes, I'm a f*g who mostly listens to feminine sweet voices). Got used to it and can say that is actually quite nice.

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's good but I could see where people could get tired of it

**starlightzone** (7.6): UGH okay I think this is a bop but I just‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt vibe to this. I don‚Äôt know what it is but it feels like it misses the mark in a few places. HOWEVER the impact is sO good and this song is something else entirely and it deserves what it got and I‚Äôm proud of Lil Nas X.

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Not sure how this ruled the charts for so long, but this one‚Äôs actually interesting.

**skargardin** (7): boppy

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): the song doesn't really do much for me beyond it being incredibly catchy, but... its success is one of the most amazing stories in music history and i'm so glad i witnessed it and even gladder that nas seems to be such a cool person. very very happy for him and his record.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Kind of a so-so tune but I appreciate how genre-bending and history-defining it was, cool vocal performances and Nirvana sample but not a fan of the trap beat

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): stan nas

**1998tweety** (6): Well. I certainly don't hate this song anymore (it's grown on me a lot). I still don't think it's amazing but w/e it's fun.

**InternetDude19** (6): Billy Ray Cyrus improves this song a ton.

**ManofOranges** (6): While I think I will always appreciate and be in awe at the utter phenomenon of this song, I do not think the song is that good. If Billy Ray weren't here the song would be even lower, but thankfully he is so the song earns a few points in my book.

**rhyneston3** (6): Catchy, but Big & Rich did a better innuendo laced horse riding country song

**timothy444** (6): It went viral for a reason.

**vayyiqra** (6): As catchy as this song is, becoming such a widespread meme ruined it for me. I appreciate it for its creativity, and it's pretty good for a song Lil Nas X just wrote one day because he was frustrated, but now I never want to hear it again. I am trying to be fair though.

**rslashpoopheads** (5): Well it's something alright.

**Xanleth** (5): I never hated this song but I don‚Äôt care for it either.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): i've really never understood OTR. It's just so.... boring to me, idk

**kappyko** (2): the billy ray cyrus verse sucks imo and i've made my thoughts on enjoying this song clear before

**NotnotaMotmot** (2): I still don't get this one.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1.5): i actually can‚Äôt stand this song, also this brings back traumatising memories from last year when i had to analyse this song for a music exam. i barely passed that exam.

**CritneySpearz** (1): I think without Billy Ray Cyrus it‚Äôs kind of funny in a meme way, but he makes it unbearable...

**ExtraEater** (10): Will never not be a MASSIVE BOP. Plus, that bridge is perfect.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Just Dance 3 is one of the best video games of the 2010‚Äôs and this is a fact, not an opinion.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (6): Man, this song is so *2010*. I‚Äôm instantly transported to freshman year.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Absolutely iconic, massive bop. Nnn I actually sang this song for my audition in my school's play, it did NOT go well at all but at least I had taste.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): I THROW MY HANDS UP IN THE AIR SOMETIMES / SAYING AYO / THIS SONG IS SO GODDAMN CATCHY AND TAIO'S AUTOTUNED VOCALS WORK SO WELL-O

**alwayswords** (10): a feel good bop

**bandnitos** (10): i remember i got this on my ipod when i was like 7 and my dad just put the explicit version on lol

**hikkaru** (10): taio cruz king, a MEGA classic

**ignitethephoenix** (10): A CLASSIC! Also reminds me of when kids were like ‚ÄúI throw my skittles up in the air sometimes, saying Ayoo taste the rainbow‚Äù

**poppinmmolly** (10): this reminds me of my senior year homecoming dance. It was everyone's favorite song.

**Roxieloxie** (10): Miss Chyna kinda outsold a tiny bit but hers is a 11 while this is a solid 10

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Bring back this type of party pop music please I beg of you

**FKJVMMP** (9): I know it‚Äôs not very good, but god what a nostalgia bomb. I‚Äôm yet to meet anybody currently in their mid-20s who doesn‚Äôt get hyped as fuck when this comes on.

**ggal2020** (9): I feel like this should be at least top 10 just judging by how many very specific memories I have of it

**skargardin** (9): Taio comeback when

**starlightzone** (9): Taio Cruz is just a simple man he wants to make music for you to have fun listening to don‚Äôt sleep on him, invite him to your party.

**timothy444** (9): Loved it when I was still in high school, and still love it now.

**waluigiest** (9): his album was one of the first I ever bought and outside of the singles it was hot garbage!!

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.7): (#30) China Anne McClain outsold.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): king

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (8.5): this was such a bop back in primary school

**ReallyCreative** (8): I wonder if this is the song that set Lorde off

**rslashpoopheads** (8): Super dated sounding but still a bop.

**runaway3212** (8): The Minecraft parody is even better.

**vapourlomo** (8): This is the most 2010 song ever written ‚Äî and I love it

**vayyiqra** (8): Is this what Lorde meant when she said she was bored of told to put her hands up in the air? Probably, but it's still a banger. It's ironic I would like this song when I don't even like clubbing, but it's a classic. I can't hate it.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): ‚ÄúI‚Äôm wearing all my favorite brands brands brands brandzzzz‚Äù

**Jexan13** (7.5): omg you sound just like Shakira, no, it's Catherine Zeta, no, it's Marin... oh wait, this isn't Love + Fear. Or is it? Did Marina went the Ariana's route?

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): This song sums up 2010 so well. entirely unremarkable but kinda fun

**rhyneston3** (7.5): So dated but soooooo catchy

**FrankBedbroken** (7): it's probably nostalgia bias speaking but to me this is a banger

**nightjesus** (7): I THROW MY SKITTLES IN THE AIR SOMETIMES SAYING AYYO TASTE THE RAINBOW!

**stickywheels46** (7): Everyone born in early 2000s knows this one

**themagicwemade** (7): the minecraft parody would get my 11

**wavingwolves** (6.5): i like this song but i love the dirty picture song with kesha. that song reminds me of christmas!

**bespectacIed** (6): Remember those cringey Facebook pages circa early 2010s with long ass names like "I throw my skittles in the air sometimes saying ayyyy yooo taste the rainbow"??? Fun times. Anyways this song is laughably bad, the lyrics are so third grade but it bops i guess

**dlstantdreamer** (5): This was a bop at the time, but honestly aged soo poorly. It‚Äôs unfortunate because this was one of the first songs I associate with meme culture due to the ‚Äúi throw my hands up in the air saying ayo there‚Äôs  no mayo‚Äù jokes.

**steelstepladder** (5): More like this song is Do-do-do-do

**ManofOranges** (4): China Anne McClain outsold, but either way this song is still bad.

**CritneySpearz** (3): holy shit this song did not age well. trash!

**InternetDude19** (2): I'm sick of this song, and I hate the 2009-2010 club music, pretty much all of it sucks. Thank Lorde, we've moved on from that.

**Xanleth** (2): The Minecraft Parody is better.

**fadedblue09** (1): God this era of music was awful. Maybe Lorde made some points.

**steelstepladder** (10): Fuck it Like a G6 gets a ten because why not

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): we should bring back the word slizzard dev didnt just invent that dr. seuss ass shit for nothing

**themagicwemade** (10): i like how the bonus songs say "the way you make me feel like a g6"

**vayyiqra** (10): *POPPIN' BOTTLES IN THE ICE* Any millennial who remembers the glory days of trashy club bangers will know this opening line right away and know that it is one of the highlights of that genre. Dev is really underrated, as is the song of hers that sample came from ("Booty Bounce", an absurd trashy bop without which I bet PC Music would not exist). This song cannot possibly be serious, and therefore it a shitpost, and a masterpiece of one. I wish Far East Movement had done more, because if they made anything this good again we would have no choice but to stan. Also, give Dev the respect she deserves; stream *The Night the Sun Came Up* and learn from your elders.

**waluigiest** (10): I think about this song monthly

**jackisboredtoday** (9.5): where are beats like this in pop music today? i want this sort of electroclash back on the charts more than anything

**bulforster** (9): The Asian representation the world needs.

**rslashpoopheads** (9): Remember that time we accidentally let asian people be successful in the American music scene? We should try that again! Stream Identity by Far East Movement!

**vapourlomo** (9): For about 20 minutes, this sounded like the future. I miss that moment

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): terrible but iconic and I will not hear constructive criticism

**GiftoftheGeek** (8): My mom turned off the radio when Bruno said "your sex takes me to paradise" but let me and my little sister jam out to this drinking anthem

**yourfacesucksass** (7.7): I hated this song but kind of like it now? Is that how far music has come?

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this shit‚Äôs still so catchy to me, like i love the hook of this song fuck

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Pretty trashy from the rapping to the lyrics to the really dated production... but man does it slap, the bridge and chorus and the lead synth make it super catchy

**FKJVMMP** (7): If I wasn‚Äôt exactly old enough to have had this soundtrack every high school party I ever went to it‚Äôd be a 1.

**Xanleth** (7): Slick and catchy beat brought down by some of these lyrics.

**PointlessBibliophage** (6.6): i mean if you're gonna repeat a single number

**slimboyfriend** (6): Asian American trailblazers

**ComeOnPupperfish** (5.5): This would be #70 in the list.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): They get points for not sounding completely obnoxious.

**InternetDude19** (4): Leave this in the past.

**starlightzone** (4): equally no, don‚Äôt.

**bespectacIed** (3): iconic but meh

**ExtraEater** (10): Considering how corny it is, I‚Äôm surprised this sub doesn‚Äôt hate this song‚Äôs guts. Then again, it does have the amazing Janelle Monae, so I can‚Äôt be too surprised. Great song that doesn‚Äôt deserve all the hate for it that I actually just made up in my head. Is this what it‚Äôs like to be on stan twitter?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Janelle Monae has a number 1 and officially outpeaked your fave.

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (8): Man, I miss Glee sometimes.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Janelle's best song, a masterpiece. I love how the song actually slows down in the chorus.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Most phenomenal chorus of all here, once the first one happens the whole song kicks into gear, Nate's vocals are impassioned, love the instrumental piano + guitar

**bambamhenny** (10): jammed to this a lot when it came out

**bespectacIed** (10): A MOTHERFUCKING HIT. This was once my favorite song, I'm 100% serious. This song makes me emotional from how every melody and lyric is perfectly placed and timed. Only complaint is that Janelle deserved more than 5 fucking words repeated many times, that was mysogynoir

**CarlieScion** (10): v close to being my 11

**ManofOranges** (10): This song remains iconic to me. Also bonus points for introducing me to Janelle Monae way back when.

**MasterWizardRyan** (10): Janelle was severely underutilized, still a great song

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): our esteemed mod deserves nothing less, even if her part is so obscure that i was surprised to know she was in it at all. also the song slaps.

**rickikardashian** (10): this was the beginning of what would become a decade of me being Jack Antonoff's lil bitch boy. Anything he has touched for the past 8 years, I have stanned ^^except ^^Lena ^^Dunham . Here's to another decade where 70% of my music taste is just Antonoff produced songs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): 11 year old me was SHOOK when this song first came out

**themagicwemade** (10): is this song about domestic abuse

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): :)

**timothy444** (10): Criminally underrated.

**waluigiest** (10): I adore this song - I actually fell in love with the band and saw them live because of it. Wonderfully written and performed. I just wished the Janelle Monae bridge was differently orchestrated - I think there are live versions where her voice rises above and the annoying nananas aren‚Äôt there

**wavingwolves** (10): we are young and it fucking sucks i guess!

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i love this song and both these artists so much y‚Äôall. honestly i might prefer the version without janelle slightly more just because she feels a little shoehorned it, but alas, still a very high score

**starlightzone** (9.5): I feel like I have to give the mod a good rating but I really love this song. It‚Äôs so beautiful and smooth and really really fun. SET THE WORLD ON FIRE BITCHES.

**bandnitos** (9): omg a fellow pophead congrats on getting on the rate!!!

**runaway3212** (9): Amazing

**vayyiqra** (9): Jackoff is GOOD and yes this song could've used a lot more Janelle, but it's still a classic and you all just aren't ready for that conversation. I will admit the intro is a little annoying and I normally hate songs about being young because I can attest that being young isn't great for everyone, but this is still a pure and wholesome song.

**ComeOnPupperfish** (8.5): (#33) Stream Carry On.

**alwayswords** (8): a graduation anthem

**fadedblue09** (8): It‚Äôs mostly the instrumental that saves this song.

**hikkaru** (8): an anthem, a classic... though it's not actually that good nostalgia will cloud my view idc idc

**nightjesus** (8): This makes me miss 2012. I need to do more with my life while society still considers me still ‚Äòyouthful‚Äô.

**steelstepladder** (8): More like We Are fun.

**stickywheels46** (8): One of the best songs to drunkenly wail to

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): it blows my mind that this song being played on Glee launched fun. and that means without glee we wouldn‚Äôt have all the jack antonoff produced albums of the last 5 years

**FrankBedbroken** (7): a little too much bombast for my liking, but it's still a fun listen all in all

**rhyneston3** (7): I‚Äôve listened to this so many times and I still don‚Äôt know when Janelle‚Äôs part is

**camerinian** (6): The first verse is a 10/10 indie banger, the rest of it is like a 4/10 Samsung commercial, so I'd say that levels out to a 6

**FKJVMMP** (6): I respect it a lot more than I like it. Just like every other Janelle Mon√°e song.

**rslashpoopheads** (6): It's fine.

**Roxieloxie** (5): Okay so i dont like this song as much anymore cause of the first verse of, its sorta yikes

**starla\_** (5): i hated this when i first came out and i haven‚Äôt listened to it in like 6 years. I conclude its only good while drunk

**anothertown** (4): So grating and I hate the tempo change and the production on Janelle‚Äôs vocal. Stream Aim & Ignite (2009)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): sorry janelle

**Xanleth** (4): I‚Äôve never been a fan of this song but you can do worse

**CritneySpearz** (3): this song did not age well, imo...

**ReallyCreative** (3): Nate Ruess' voice is obnoxious I'm sorry I can't stand this song

**Awhile2** (2): i love janelle but thank god indie pop died.

**bulforster** (2): It starts okay then turns into a dirge that makes me want to bash my head in.

**gannade** (1): nate reuss cant sing at all
