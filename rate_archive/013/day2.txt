**THE 80'S RATE REVEAL DAY 2: Baby, They Are Stars**

Welcome, popheads, to the second day of the rate reveal of the 80's rate. Today is the second of three days where I will reveal the 37 tracks that you rated and commented on.

Today, as we continue the countdown to the top 10, we will take a closer look at exactly what made these artists great - not only their albums, but their live performances, personalities and cultural impact are what made them such stars.

The rate will begin at 17:00 EST, one hour after this post appears; this is also the case on Sunday.

Today I will be revealing #24 - #11, both in this thread and in the [Popheads Plug](https://plug.dj/popheads). Here are some fun facts:

* After a slight re-calculation, the overall average of all songs is now 8.037

* The average score of all songs revealed today is 8.127

* So far, Janet Jackson's average is 7.239

* So far, Madonna's average is 6.830

* So far, Prince's average is 7.638

* So far, Michael Jackson's average is 6.631

* Because of reasons you are all aware of, I had quite some difficulties in finding Youtube versions for all Prince songs in this rate - my apologies if you're following this in the plug and find the videos unsatisfactory.

I don't know, it's very sweet like you said. It sounds kinda sad but it has happy and cute lyrics that paint a vivid picture in my head, and the synths make it dance-y too. So it's like a mixture of emotions to me, and the repetitiveness of it makes it more mesmerizing. It kinda reminds me of Borderline, which makes me feel the same way, I love that song too.

Jelboo: **24: Prince - Take Me With U**

Average: 7.702

Highest scores: 10 x 2 (white_anarchist_teen, omgcow), 1x9.5 (ExtraEater),9.3 x 1 LuigiEatsPopcorn, 9.2 x 2 (TheAfricAsian, Hoplitejoeisdumb) and 9x2 (calltehshots, CandlePrince)

Lowest scorest: 4x1 (hoolytoledo), 5x1 (TeamAwesome4) and 6x6 (MrSwearword, mustangs16, triptoyourheart, Xtremlysean, CharlieCandle, TragicKingdom1)

Total points: 431.3

Although the song starts out rather ominous-sounding, it soon becomes a very cheerful, optimistic love song, almost 'immature', and kind of an odd one out on the album. The instrumentation is very Prince, very 80's - almost no bass, high register, and some rinkling sound that always reminds me of a bicycle bell. The strings in the background are terrific if you listen to them closely.

The excitement of a new, first love is tangible here - the song is buoyant and carefree. Appolonia does a *serviceable* job as the other singer in what is technically a duet, but other women have sang with Prince and done it better. 

All in all, while I think Purple Rain as one of the best albums of all time - somehow I think the least of Take Me With U, despite enjoying it. It's the least 'unique' and the least ambitious of the tracks.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*: It is interesting production but No T, No Shade Prince cannot sell an earnest love song.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: The lyrics and melodies are cool but the arrangement is especially cool with that weird ominous intro and the little synth string embellishments

*Look_A_Fangirl*: Not as great as the opener but still amazing, I’m sure with the context of the movie it would be higher.

*therokinrolla*:  A very pretty song, Prince’s voice really is a highlight in this song. I feel like I’m in a trance and I love it.

by: /u/TheKneesOfOurBees

Madonna's Dress You Up is one of those "forgotten hits", I feel. It's not iconic like Like a Virgin or Material Girl, so it's not the first thought thay comes to mind when mentioning this era, and it's not even a cool b-side that non hardcore Madonna fans have never heard of, or some rarity that she only sang in a concert in tokyo. It's just kind of, there. And to be honest, I'm pretty sure Madonna feels this way too, as this top 5 hit wasn't even included in her compilation album, The Immaculate Collection.

And yet, this is one of my favorite Madonna songs of all time. Man, I get all tingly whenever i hear this song. It might not be Madonna at her most adventurous (that fashion metaphore is as blunt as it can be, probably), but it might just be Madonna at her most careless, almost stupid fun. Nile Rodgers created a beat so incredibly fun and happy to match, which just makes me feel so sad whenever I am reminded how this gem of a song will never be remembered for how truly wonderful it is.

If this is out first night I'm suing you all bethes.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Itsafudgingstick*: That drum intro? That iconic synth melody? That guitar outro? The real introduction of sexy Madonna? Triggering the rage of Tipper Gore? This is THAT song!

*Hoplitejoeisdumb*: Infectiously energetic song.

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: a fun bop.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: This song was almost really cool, and then the lyrics happened.

*DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*: Queen of making parents triggered into creating the now iconic "Parental Advisory Explicit Content" label, indirectly.

*therokinrolla*: This hook will haunt my mind for years and years. ITs so perfect and hook-y, it will NEVER leave me. Brushing my teeth I’ll burst out “GONNA DRESS YOU UP” and ruin my mirror. Driving Imma start singing, “GONNA DRESS YOU UP” and crash. Madge is gonna ruin my car. In class Imma be learning calculus and I’m gonna shout to my short Russian teacher, “GONNA DRESS YOU UP” and get thrown out of school. “GONNA DRESS YOU UP, AND YOU UP, EVERYBODY GONNA GET DRESSED UP!”

*TeamAwesome4*: Some of it felt really repetitive, but I never got tired of hearing the same thing over and over, so I'm good with it.

Average: 7.755

Total points: 436.6

Highest scores: 11x1 (cloudbustingmp3), 10x8 (Kaphox, triptoyourheart, omgcow, limpyjr, eribertknows, mokitsu, white_anarchist_teen, calltehshots), 9.5 x 3 (dustinhaltom, Look_A_Fangirl, Jelboo) 9.2 x 1 (LuigiEatsPopcorn) and 9 x 6 (banananaise, ExtraEater, TheAllRightGatsby, Novvois, Nerdy_boy_chris, JoshuaReddit)

Lowest scores: 0 x 1 (DrunkHurricane) 3 x 1 (TeamAwesome4), 4 x 2 (letsallpoo, mindnoises) and 5 x 3 (hoolytoledo, Xtremlysean, mustangs16)

The 'love it or hate it' track on Purple Rain. Either the slow burning, falsetto vocals, endless 'baby' squirming and passionate screams work for you, or they don't at all, I don't really see a middle ground.

It won't surprise you that personally I am in love with this track. I love Prince when he gets weird, when he pushes the limits, when his voice and music just *go there*, try crazy shit. The more excentric, the better. And this song is just that - desire, impatience, confusion, all in one wild and demanding screech. Prince is on the stage, grasping for words, for resolution, for an answer - the woman is driving him *mad*. 

From the very slow build up, to the soft spoken word bridge, to the release and anger of the screaming, I think this is a masterful song, and a very powerful one. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*: He commits to this 100% [even if his vocals suffer greatly for it]

*DrunkHurricane*: Prince's falsetto is so awful oh my god

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: Dated, in the best ways

*TheAllRightGatsby*: It starts off verging on cheesy but Prince has too much charisma for that, and then the way the song builds and wraps up is so great

*TragicKingdom1-: The first part of the song is kind of boring, but the last minute or so Prince GOES OFF.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: Oh fuck this heartbreaking, starts out calm and turns into screaming over a lover that can’t make up her mind, fuck it’s too real.

*therokinrolla*: An insanely quiet intro insanely builds up to an insane scream-fest from Prince that is a little too much by the end. Shorten it up a bit, polish the edges, and you will have a much better song.

*Luigieatspopcorn*: ooh sweet ballad. Also those screams at the end are really irreplicable, nobody does it like Prince.

*calltehshots*: That kicked a bunch of ass. I’m snatched.

*eribertknows*:  The word “baby” is a little overwhelming and feels like a way out of having to actually write lyrics, but I love this song because I can hear so many of my favorite artists being inspired by Prince and these kind of songs and well, he sounds amazing. Also people who can make screaming sound good are special and we should appreciate them.

Jelboo: **21: Janet Jackson - When I Think Of You**

Average: 7.796

Highest scores:
10 x 8 (dustinhaltom, MrSwearword, BearlyEvenAPun, Jelboo, cloudbustingmp3, JunkyGS, Novvois, Hoplitejoeisdumb) and 9 x 7 (DrunkHurricane, jamesfog, limpyjr, lordpraisewifi, sh-ether, Nerdy_boy_chris, JoshuaReddit)

Lowest scores: 5 x 1 (ztarno), 5.5 x 1 (berober04) and 6 x 6 (TeamAwesome4, mindnoises, callmetidle, mustangs16, hjckirkwood, Itsafudgingstick)

by: /u/TheKneesOfOurBees

Isn't it funny that this song, probably one of the lightest in tone in Control, is actually the biggest hit for Janet from that era? Nasty and What Have You Done For Me Lately, both almost aggressive in tone, feisty and fierce, are far more of an indicator of the tone of the album than this, yet both stalled below number one. Not to mention, Janet would strike gold with an ever more aggressive and fiery album, Rhythm Nation 1814 (to be exact, she striked 6x platinum), and generally, Janet isn't well remembered for her sweet fun songs.

So how come the GP liked such a light song from an artist who is so bold in her statement? Well, the answer is, it's just that good. Sure the song is sweet and light, but it's lightness doesn't make it any less of a great love song, as Janet sings about how her lover is able to make her feel sky high just by thinking of him in the most sincere way possible. With a bubbly production to match and an iconic video that was way ahead of its time, this song became a hit because it was just. that. good.

And damn I hope your scores have shown that.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*JunkyGS*: Janet's first hot 100 #1 and a fan favorite. It shows Janet's innocence and that despite all this independence she is still susceptible to falling for a guy. The production is so good and Janet's tone is what really makes this song stand out amongst all the songs about falling in love.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: It's fine but it sounds kinda dated and doesn't hold my attention at all

*Look_A_Fangirl*: After a long break of few hours, thanks to other things :(, I finally got back into the rate with this song.

*therokinrolla*: A lovely track! The ending sounds like someone is having a seizure but otherwise

Sweet lord baby Jesus if this isn't smooth. These vocals! It sounds like Michael is really pushing his voice all the way here, gliding over the funky instrumental, crooning and groaning - it's the young singer's voice at its exhilarating, life-affirming best. The vocals are supported by a jazzy, funky disco backing that shows Quincy Jones' genius and is a perfect continuation of the sound of 1979's 'Off The Wall'. A very late disco song, you could say, but it doesn't feel out of place here at all.

It's up to you really to decide who is the real star of this song - because as far as my knowledge goes, this is one of the songs that Quincy had the most influence on on Thriller, this is a typical song for the producer. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*therokinrolla*: Best non-single from the album!(not that hard considering there’s only two but still)

*MrSwearword*:  it’s pretty good but considering the album and his mythos, this can’t sit with other Michael songs.

*Hoplitejoeisdumb*: Really dig the disco vibe on the track

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: This album is so good wtf.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: The verses don’t really do it for me but the backing vocals on the chorus are really really cool.

I've said time and time again that what I like the most about Purple Rain is how clearly it aspires for success. It is ambition in music, a heart's wish spoken with a voice of guitars, drums, synths and Prince's own vocals, a wish for acceptance, for love, for redemption, for recognition.

This is where this is the most lyrically the case. This is a triumphant celebration of Prince's ego. He's a star, ready to claim the stage and no shame for who he is. 

I find the drums satisfying, the vocals and lyrics fulfilling, the synths highly energetic and danceable - my only slight gripe with the song is the chorus, which I find just a bit too chaotic and crazy, although that might just be the point of the song.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: Relatable.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: Nice upbeat energetic dancey track but not a standout, just really good filler imo

*Look_A_Fangirl*: I want to use this song to walk into a room and be like BAM I HAVE ARRIVED.

This song was so raunchy and provocative that it upset parents nationwide. The controversy of this song and many others like it, mostly in the hard rock genre, led to the creation of the PMRC, a committee that pressured record labels, television stations, radio stations and artists to 'clean up their act' and created the Parental Advisory sticker.

So is it a horribly gross song, with revolting imagery and highly explicit lyrics? Kinda. Compared to what else is out there, especially today, it's a horny and steamy song but definitely not stupefyingly shocking. 

Nonetheless, listen to the slow, dragging guitar. Listen to Prince monotonous, slurring vocals, the erotically charged atmosphere of this song about a notorious nympho who turns Prince's world upside down. This is some of the nastiest funk His Royal Badness has ever put together. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Itsafudgingstick*:  I'm probably REALLY biased because this was the first Prince song I've ever heard but holy fuck this is perfect. So sensual and like I fell in love in the first few seconds.

*cloudbustingmp3*: sleazy perfection

*MrSwearword*: Just for inventing the Parental Advisory sticker alone.

*Tragickingdom1*: So sexy it literally formed the PMRC.

*patronsaintofaspies*: Wow I can't believe Prince predicted Nicki Minaj's entire career I'm shook

*TheAllRightGatsby*: Sex anthem tbh, an utter and absolute sexy bop, and the outro is pretty and weird too, much like Prince

*therokinrolla*: This song is absolute sex. SEX. Side to Side who? Sexxx Dreams who?(jk ARTPOP is still the best album) This song is HOT! “Call me whenever you wanna grind” ungghh

Lowest scores: 3 x 1 (hoolytoledo), 4 x 1 (Nfranklin50), 6 x 6 (ztarno, omgcow, MrSwearword, eribertknows, hjckirkwood, berober04).

Few songs make me as happy as this one. In terms of content, it isn't much - the lyrics are simple and vague. However, the song is a beauty. Janet's vocals are soft and sweet, the drums are so damn satisfying, the melody is an amazing construction, and those synth sweeps and guitar licks and drum riffs are so damn perfect. It combines the best of Control's both worlds: hard-hitting, high-energy music with a softer touch, girlish vocals, romantic lyrics.

The song takes risks near the end - a lot of Control is about these extended instrumental bridges. Janet was a dancing queen and her videos and live performances would gladly make use of these breaks to showcase her moves.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*CharlieCandle*: Cute song, one of the better ones in the album imo.

*JunkyGS*: Queen of teaching us psychology!

*Look_A_Fangirl*:  A lot better than You Can Be Mine, but still not Control level.

Control goes hard. It doesn't have time or room to spare and goes straight to the point. Everything about this song is tight - the words are well-articulated and half-spoken, half-sung. The drums are fast, hypnotic. The chorus is snappy, short, almost unnaturally cut-off. Janet Jackson announces her intentions to the world - she is here to take control of her identity as a musician and won't take no for an answer.

This no-nonsense title track isn't necessarily my personal favourite, I've always found something about the production jarring; several tracks on Control have the same spunky and fiery nature but also just feel 'smoother' to me, which is why I like them just a bit more. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Hoplitejoeisdumb*: a funky opening statement, a little over long for me.

*ExtraEater*: "I am in control of my life"

*JunkyGS*: God where the fuck do I begin? This is a true feminist anthem because it is so universally empowering for everybody to realize the control they have over their own lives & happiness. For Janet to take control of her private & public life in such an unapologetically fierce & raw way at a young age in the public eye with such intense pressure from family & media demands respect from everybody. This song is so inspiring, along with timeless trend setting / genre defining production makes the song legendary. This song cemented who Janet was as a person & artist while seamlessly threading the theme throughout the album without it being forced or seeming fake. She sings the song with such a calm confidence which adds even more to why this song is a masterpiece.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: I'm like 97% sure I'm gonna have this stuck in my head for the rest of the day and tbh I'm kinda excited about it, this is so good. This song makes feel like a BAMF, you go Janet.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: Now THIS is how you open an album, like holy shit this is great!

*Kaphox*: Queen of being sampled by Kylie Minogue!

LATELYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

... yeah. Luckily, after that, we get a god damn kick-ass song. You guys rated it higher than Control and I agree - if you take Control and give it some swing and some groove and you get this marvellous jam, which, coupled with a fantastic video, helped make Janet a household name. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*: 10 Janet’s GOAT. Simply put.

*limpyjr*: A few weeks ago, I couldn't remember the name of this song, so I googled "janet jackson ooo ooo ooo yeah." This has nothing to do with my review, I just felt like I had to share that.

*ExtraEater*: what (have you done for me lately)

*JunkyGS*: The classiest way to call out all the fucc bois boyfriends. It is an original & different angle on relationships because it tackles the topic of when they become stale / flat. Again super catchy with good lyrics that fit the melody and awesome production.

*Hoplitejoeisdumb*: "But little things are all you seem to give" 👀

*therokinrolla*: I love these spoken intros so much. “WHAT HAS HE DONE FOR YOU LATELLYYYYYY???” The song that follows is a perfectly sassy but underwhelming track

*Itsafudgingstick*: Can we talk about how iconic that intro skit was? Boosted an already great song to a solid score. Docked points for, again being too long.

I absolutely adore this song. It is something otherwordly, something unique, something achingly brilliant to me. It paints a picture of a nightscape, a city alive with potential, a man standing on the edge of tomorrow. It is melancholic and yet optimistic, it is haunting and yet soothing. What is it about? It doesn't matter. It is about not compromising your identity as much as it is about the excitement of going out and living. This cryptical ballad is one of the finest song Michael Jackson ever sang and, as far as its atmosphere, there is nothing like it in his entire oeuvre. 

From breathy, airy vocals, to the questioning chorus, to the angelic falsetto soaring through the nocturnal synths, I personally deem this a masterpiece of a song. Live performances turned this song into a much more erotically charged song, but the innocence and eagerness of this original version still remains as the best rendition.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: God this album is so good.

*patronsaintofaspies*: Madonna is shook

*calltehshots*: On an album with a lot of masterpieces, this remains my favorite song on Thriller and quite possibly my favorite MJ song of all time. There’s fragility and loneliness in Michael’s performance but also this youthful air of curiosity and excitement about whatever he’s about to experience and it’s contagious. There’s a hopefulness in this song that I find really beautiful and a great change of pace after the back to back to back bops of Thriller, Beat It, and Billie Jean.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: This is probably my favorite MJ ballad-leaning song. The chorus to this song has such a fantastic melody, it’s so freaking catchy, and I know he says “Does he do me do that way” but I always wanna just sing “Duhbeedoobeedah-day” cuz it’s too infectious to even sing actual words

*Tragickingdom1*: The perfect pop song. Smooth as hell with excellent vocals.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: This song surprisingly bored me.

*TeamAwesome4*:  My absolute favorite on the album and second favorite from Michael as a whole. When he does soft music well, I don't think anyone can touch him.

*Itsafudgingstick*: I love swoon-worthy teeny bopper Michael almost as much as I like Badboy/Mysterious Michael. Can he do no wrong musically?

*spacebabe27*: God this is such a beautiful song. I love this instrumental because it sounds like The Police doing R&B to me and it's just so simple and elegantly done.

*eribertknows*: Holy shit this is so good and ahead of its time IM SHOOK.

'stay here,' i commanded my horse. it neighed obediently. 

i gulped, firmly gripped the bag that was in my hands, and went inside the cave.

inside, there were even more crows and skulls. sinister music played in the background-think  phantom of the opera title song. poisonous fumes occupied the air. posters of zayn malik, nicki minaj and skai jackson had been ripped apart. i gasped and stumbled into the main chamber of the cave. there, behind the cauldron, a tall, despicable figure glared at me.

'what do you want you tr---y b--ch f----t c---k whore' she said

With a bassline very much like The Jacksons' 'Can You Feel It' (look it up and agree with me), this song is another iconic moment for Madonna, a fast-paced with really interesting synths in the background (they sound strangely modern, almost EDM at times!) and her trademark squeaky voice which she used for some of her biggest hits at the time. Dance-oriented tracks like this made Madonna a star and few will be able to boast they can resist this catchy earworm.

The lyrics here are clearly sarcastic and tongue-in-cheek, but you wouldn't believe the number of people who take them seriously. No, Madonna is not a rich snob, and the snarky tone should be obvious.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*:  If we’re keeping it real, this is the 32nd best song of Madonna’s career. Still, this is a hell of an album opener.

*JunkyGS*: To this day articles about Madonna will lead with “Material Girl Madonna” or something like that for a reason. This song is so fucking catchy and tongue in cheek in typical Madonna fashion. Angel: 8.5 This song is super cute and well-rounded overall lyrically, vocals, production, etc.

*Hopliejoeisdumb*: if anyone has money and wants to date a cute boy hmu

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: An iconic bop. But you all knew this already.

*patronsaintofaspies*: tfw when you're a socialist and madonna will never date you :(

*TheAllRightGatsby*: Oh boy this song is really testing where my border of "Too cheesy even for the 80s" is. A very solid chorus brings this back from the brink of oblivion but I still can't handle listening to this.

*therokinrolla*: Here’s my 11! Will this song last to day three? Hell no. But this song is such a bop! And there is such a hook! I feel like bathing in jewelry while listening to this song, I just love it! FEED ME MATERIALISM

Funky, smooth, satisfying, danceable - holy hell this song is a groovy disco paradise and it is songs like that have inspired modern pop/funk gods like Bruno Mars. P.Y.T. was originally perceived as a slow, lush, midtempo song, but during recording it was reworked into this spunky banger with extensive use of vocal trickery and another effortless performance from the singer, whose vocals really shine on songs like this and 'Baby Be Mine'.

Fun fact: the girls singing 'na na na' back to Michael, are his sisters, LaToya and Janet Jackson.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: Album favorite, every part of this song is flawless, the weird funk disco rock jazz pop overlap is flawless, MJ’s delivery is flawless, the lyrics are flawless, and I dare you to resist this song. (Also shout out to that ending section cuz now I can’t hear it without thinking of Kanye’s “Good Life” and I’m not complaining about it either.)

*DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*: I feel like this is one of the songs that inspired Bruno Mars so much.

Every time I think 'meh, is Like A Virgin actually a good song? She sings like a baby on helium' I give it a listen, and every time I realize what a fool I was being. 

The image of Madonna as provocative, sexually confident and laden with innuendo finds its birth in this song and its live performances. But what this song also proves, and much more importantly, is Madonna's ability to create timeless pop. While, yes, this song sounds decidedly 80's, it overshadows that possible drawback by being irresistibly catchy. And her vocals, sounding higher and squeakier than ever, just *work*, adding to the ambiguous and provocative imagery. Innocence and eroticism are combined in a career-defining song.

I can't help but wondering how much the bassline was inspired by Billie Jean, though.

*CharlieCandle*: I don't like Madonna yet this song is not only amazing but also a classic.

*JunkyGS*: I can’t relate to this song because God fucked me the moment I was born since he made me gay. Real talk timeless bop.

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: Relatable.

*Like_A_Virgin*: I C O N I C

*DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*: This iconic Madonna song is only controversial title as well as its supposed double entendre meaning in the lyrics. To be honest, this song is totally about love and not anything else that is NSFW.

*therokinrolla*: There is something so wonderful about the wubbing beat and I don’t know what it is. Literally I C O N I C.

*ignitethephoenix*: For some reason her voice just doesn't work with the song for me. It would have been better if someone else was singing it

*cloudbustingmp3*: one of THE greatest pop songs of all time! her delivery in this is so good for a reason i can't really describe, and this always pops off in live performances.

*Itsafudgingstick*: Nothing to say other than I'm highkey judging whoever doesn't give this their 10/11

Jelboo: Prince was rated before he died as well as exactly what he was, a legend. His death changed nothing. This is my honest opinion - he might have 'disappeared' a bit later on in his career but Purple Rain has always been regarded as one of the finest albums of the 80's and of all time.
