**THE 80'S RATE REVEAL DAY 1: SIGN 'O' THE TIMES**


Welcome, popheads, to the first day of the rate reveal of the 80's rate. Today is the first of three days where I will reveal the 37 tracks that you rated and commented on.

The theme for today is not just celebrating these artists and their... less well received songs, but also the 80's as an era of musical diversity and experimentation.

On Friday, Saturday and Sunday, the rate will begin at 17:00 EST, one hour after this post appears.

Today I will be revealing #37 - #25, both in this thread and in the [Popheads Plug](https://plug.dj/popheads). Here are some fun facts:

- 57 users participated in this rate.

- The average score was 8.031.

- The average score of the 13 songs revealed today is 6.988.

- In total, all songs earned 16640.3 points out of a possible 21347. 

- Out of 2072 different scores, 470 scores were higher than or equal to 10. That means 22.7%, or almost 1 out of 4 scores by all users for all songs were a 10 or 11.

- The most generous user was /u/Novvois, with an average of 9.324

- The harshest critic was /u/DrunkHurricane, with an average of 6.459

- The full scores for all users for all songs will be revealed after day 3

- 1 anonymous user's ballot was disqualified after a series of unfortunate miscommunications

As a reminder, these are the songs, albums and artists included in the rate:

Jelboo: **37: Madonna - Shoo-Bee-Doo**

Average: **5.88**

Total points: **329.3**

Highest scores: 10 x 2 (MrSwearword, letsallpoo); 9.1 x 1 (YorjYefferson); 9 x 2 (Novvois, Bluewaffles72)

Lowest scores: 0 x 3 (CharlieCandle, itsafudgingstick, triptoyourheart); 1 x 1 (cloudbustingmp3); 3 x 3 (TheAllrightGatsby, BearlyEvenAPun, mindnoises); 3.5 x 1 (DrunkHurricane)

Coming in at the very bottom is Madonna's Shoo-Bee-Doo. I cannot say I am very surprised; the song fails to really engage me at any point. It is unfulfilling, slow, and drags on too long. I know what they were going for; a sort of pleasant, Motown feel, but in the end I think it all fall flats in a repetitive and unnecessary addition to the album. Like A Virgin is at its best when it is upbeat, happy, carefree, and this song doesn't offer enough of that. It is both too slow to be entertaining and too fast to be emotive.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*: I can’t explain why I end up loving this song. I just…do.

*cloudbustingmp3*: overwrought and schmaltzy, but not in a fun way the way Crazy For You is. also way too long with an irritating hook.

*CharlieCandle*: Atrocious

*itsafudgingstick*: I kinda forgot this song existed honestly? I mean it's cute but if I weren't ranking I'd skip this so fast

*eribertknows*: Decent song but there’s a limited number of times you can say shoo-bee-doo in one song and be taken seriously and that number has been surpassed.

*Kaphox*: Always thought that this was a dud in an otherwise amazing album.

Jelboo: **36: Michael Jackson - The Girl Is Mine ft. Paul McCartney**

Average: 6.164

Total points: 345.2

Highest scores: 10 x 1 (Nerdy_boy_chris); 9.2 x 1 (ExtraEater); 9 x 1 (DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy); 8.5 x 4 (JunkyGS, eribertknows, patronsaintofaspies, bluewaffles72)

Lowest scores: 0 x 4 (BearlyEvenAPun, TheAllRightGatsby, Look_A_Fangirl, berober04); 1 x 1 (itsafudgingstick); 2 x 2 (TeamAwesome4, cloudbustingmp3); 3.5 x 1 (DrunkHurricane); 4 x 1 (MrSwearword)

The lead single for Thriller and one of three songs that two of the most successful artists in history worked on together; the other two are 'Say Say Say' and the McCartney-penned 'Girlfriend' on Michael's Off The Wall album. This sounds like a recipe for a song to stand the test of time, but as it turns out, it is nothing more than a tongue-in-cheek, sugary duet with lush production but a distinct lack of climax or groove or anything that the rest of the album offers. It stands out on the album in a negative sense - and while I do still enjoy it for its 'adorable' factor, it does really not belong on Thriller and is, considering the mythos of the artists connected to it, a disappointment.

If you want a taste of what these two were capable of making together, check out 'Say Say Say' which features McCartney and Jackson in an infinitely more energetic, upbeat and groovy collaboration.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*mustangs16*: I love MJ and Paul McCartney both so it breaks my heart a little that I don't like this song very much

*MrSwearword*: WOW this is corny as fuck. There’s saccharine pop and then there’s THIS.

*berober04*: BURN THIS SONG IN HELL

*itsafudgingstick*: I've honestly never been too big on this song whoops. Brandy and Monica did it better.

*banananaise*: this song reminds me of those awkward 70s variety show duets

*limpyjr*: This song is sappier and more generic than Great Value maple syrup.

*eribertknows*: So cute.

*ignitethephoenix*: The little dialogue part was cute. Just not feeling it much. This was apparently the lead single from Thriller, if someone pulled this shit today, the album could have flopped. But the rest of the songs are so good, who even cares if this was the lead.

Average: **6.364**

Total points: **356.4**

Highest scores: 10 x 1 (Kaphox); 9.5 x 1 (BearlyEvenAPun); 9 x 1 (DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy); 8.5 x 1 (therokinrolla)

Lowest scores: 0 x 1 (cloudbustingmp3); 3 x 2 (triptoyourheart, letsallpoo); 4 x 7 (omgcow, DrunkHurricane, 4Roux, Look_A_Fangirl, TeamAwesome4, dustinhaltom, MrSwearword)

Over And Over is cheerful, carefree, a song that feels hasty and eager. Madonna was young and ambitious and this song does a god job at capturing the impatience and ambition that must have been characteristic of her at the time. The song takes me on an imaginary journey - the journey of being a young woman dreaming of the stars and working hard as hell to get there.

The song itself is deliberately repetitive, which after a while becomes a bit of a bore, to be sure. However, I really enjoy the tempo and energy and did not expect it to end up so low!

miracleorange: Not gonna lie, this is actually one of my favorite Madonna songs, especially the extended mix on You Can Dance. It would be a difficult song to sing for anyone, especially in the days before auto-tune. Considering how fast and repetitive it is, most people would go very flat very quickly, but she managed to deliver a pretty decent vocal performance. Plus, it's just such a happy song and it pumps me up.

Average: 6.796

Total points: 380.6

Highest scores: 10 x 5 (JunkyGS, Nerdy_boy_chris, 4Roux, mokitsu, Novvois); 9.5 x 1 (cloudbustingmp3); 9 x 6 (ExtraEater, hoolytoledo, Hoplitejoeisdumb, banananaise, calltehshots, itsafudgingstick)

As far as slow erotic jams go, Janet Jackson can never get enough. I feel her career has suffered for it - at a certain point it just seems like she abandoned the socially and politically conscious material, and focused fully on eroticism of the raunchiest kind. I admire Janet's earlier career far more - its personal, autiobiographical musings on the world and on her own emotions. 
This slow, atmospheric song evokes images of a rainy day, two lovers in a bedroom (one of them, inexplicably, French). Ending albums on a slow ballad was a 'thing' in the 80's, but Control definitely deserves something better than this. The vibes are smooth, but the song all in all is forgettable - and the whole 'French is somehow more romantic than English' trope is kind of played out.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*: Good vocals but oddly droll for a sweetly romantic song.

*mustangs16*: I almost fell asleep halfway through listening to this song

*itsafudgingstick*: This is a slow song, so sensual, and that chorus is gonna appear in my dreams. I may also be biased since this song got sampled by Tinasha (or I just have good taste).

*spacebabe27*: Not a great closer to this entirely bop-filled album, but a great song nonetheless. Give me more spanish guitar in my R&B please.

*jailhousepoop*:  LMAO why is she speaking French?? Also a very boring song.

*DrunkHurricane*: wow this is boring

*ExtraEater*: #referencingthealbumitself #thisalbumwasfun **#Buy浮躁OnItunesItsAReallyUnderratedChineseDreamPopAlbum**

*JunkyGS*: This song is a foreshadow to the sultry & sensual side of Janet that will be a major part of future albums and songs. It gives me such a satisfying closer to the album and leaves me wanting more!

*ignitethephoenix*: Too repetitive and not catchy enough, also the French moans are super weird

To me this is a quintessential 80's sound - very remniscent of Madonna's debut album too, if you like this song you'll like it as well - and I really enjoy her higher vocals in the chorus and how the choir in the background interacts with it. The drums and the synth stabs really do their job as well to create a damn energetic, danceable tune. 

The song hits a snag after the halfway point, though. The bridge is kind of weak - but luckily a return to form is imminent. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*itsafudgingstick*: This is pretty alright but I'm not exactly gonna clamour to play it on repeat

*eribertknows*: What does “you make my load much lighter” mean and just imagine how much meme potential that lyric has. Also Rihanna did it better.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: The lyrics read like a 9th grader with a rhyming dictionary wrote them and the scatting is cheese incarnate but this is overall a cool track so I'll allow it.

Highest scores: 11 x 1 (Nerdy_boy_chris); 10 x 1 (Novvois); 9.4 x 1 (ExtraEater); 9 x 3 (MrSwearword, itsafudgingstick, hoolytoledo)

Lowest scores: 3 x 2 (DrunkHurricane, MindNoises)

When Quincy Jones and Michael Jackson teamed up first for 1979's Off The Wall, young Michael was a shy and reserved front man for The Jacksons, with a bright smile, high-octane voice and smooth moves - but one thing he was not quite yet, and that was sexy (at least not to most). Off The Wall featured the singer trying out some erotically charged themes and sounds, and Thriller went one step further with funky, romantic vibes like the one in this song. 


Erotic and romantic in one go, this smooth ballad was too much for Michael Jackson to record - so he asked to be alone in the studio, with the lights out, so that he could contentrate on singing without feeling embarassed. While the singer himself might not have 'felt' this song, I really do - the slow build from gentle romance to a much more physical desire is really well done. 

Again - to end Thriller with a song like this is somewhat of a strange choice, but in the 80's, definitely not unconventional.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*itsafudgingstick*:  Sonically the song is actually kind of similar to FHTF by Janet in that it's a slower, more sensual track. And just like FHTF I wanna give it all my love. Well, almost all my love

*eribertknows*: Wow gee thanks Michael now I’m horny and alone on a Saturday night, again.

*MrSwearword*: I’ve discovered that MJ can sell the idea of love even through the illusion of sex.

*ExtraEater*: it used to be an inside joke among my friends that this was the worst song on Thriller and that it was shit. we'd be listening to thriller and praise it but we'd all say "but The Lady In My Life is **shit**". now ofc it's just bc we didn't warm up to it at first, we love it *now* (or at least some of us do :eeyes:)

I remember the first time I heard this - upon hearing the very first seconds, I grinned broadly and thought to myself - 'damn, I love the 80's'. I feel like everything is on point here - the instrumental not in the least, which is well-produced and really works with the cute vocal delivery. One of the best non-famous songs on the album for me, although some moments in the song drag it down (the 'you lied' part is bad, the 'I know all about your kind' outro on the other hand is such a spectacular little moment for me).

See, I really like Like A Virgin, I really like 80's music, I really like Madonna - but I just don't care for this much. Madonna has done slow better, has done emotional better, and in my opinion, has done covers better as well. I think what this song does most is stretch the potential of Madonna's voice at that time, she sounds a bit unpleasant to my ears most of the time. The lack of lyrics are also disappointing. What saves the song is when the drums come on, adding a dimension to the song that would otherwise be a complete drag - it already feels entirely too long.

Jelboo: **29: Madonna - Angel**

Average: 7.305

Total points: 409.1

Highest scores: 11 x 1 (Kaphox); 10 x 4 (hjckirkwood, banananaise, mokitsu, 4Roux); 9.6 (YorjYefferson); 9 x 5 (BearlyEvenAPun, therokinrolla, TheAfricAsian, ViewtifulDude, limpyjr)

Lowest scores: 0 x 1 (hoolytoledo); 3 x 1 (omgcow); 3.5 x 1 (Look_A_Fangirl); 4 x 1 (bluewaffles72)

'Stay', 'Pretender' and 'Angel' to me are apex 80's - quick, fast, upbeat, energetic, sometimes rather shallow songs with strong hooks that rarely slow down and have a very characteristic, synth-driven sound. Out of the three I mentioned, I think I like this one the least - something about it is just too 'simple', too 'childish' - sitting inbetween the two behemoths of the album also isn't a blessing. 

Nonetheless, I was surprised to see these songs end up at the bottom - perhaps they are too dated, too much a product of their time? 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Novvois*: As a standalone, it's great. But sandwiched between the two biggest bops on the album hurts it. 

*MrSwearword*: cute song but not able to hold muster against the field.

*mokitsu*: The first time I heard this song, I wanted to skip it so bad but I just couldn't. It may sound like filler but to me it's just so beautiful. The synths and harmonies on the chorus give me life!

*eribertknows*: Someone tell Madonna that randomly saying “clouds just disappear” doesn’t make this shitty repetitive song any better or artsy.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: I tried to like this, I did, but I just couldn’t.

Lowest scores: 4 x 3 (mindnoises, letsallpoo, mustangs16)

Holy shit that loud-ass saxophone toot in the beginning is out of place. This song is the most like pre-Control Janet, if you ever wanna check her first two albums out. A very play-it-safe song that is adorable and cute and relatable, but it does not offer much more than that - also check out Janet's soprano cooing, surprisingly rare for her! 

Also, 'talk to hiiiiiim' is cheesy as hell. Janet has never been afraid of cheese, though - her albums are riddled with strange conversations, 'candid' discussions and moody musings.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*spacebabe27*: Another killer bassline from Janet omg.

*mokitsu:* Can relate.

*eribertknows*: Relatable.

*omgcow*: This title is me with every man I've ever been interested in

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: How relatable.

*JunkyGS*: Super catchy! This continues to show off Janet's youth and that very relatable feeling of your crush not knowing you even exist. This song is one of the weaker lyrically, and does not feel like a Janet record and could have been a song for other female artists. It doesn't suit being on this album and could have been cut imo.

I love love LOVE this. The instrumentals are hard-hitting, no-nonsense, snappy and direct, while the vocals are airy, whispery, elusive. It is a perfect song for Control - funky, danceable, self-assured, assertive. It is alive and ready!

In fact, it is one of my favourite songs on the album. Almost everything here is amazing to me. It has sharp synths, guitar solos, organ riffs, Janet giggling. Perhaps the song goes on for too long - a lot of tracks in the time were focused on making it dance-able and feature very extended instrumental sections. 

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*: nice and fluffy pop, but dear GOD this doesn’t work for Janet AT. ALL.

*cloudbustingmp3*: cute and fun but honestly could be like a minute or two shorter

*spacebabe27*: G U I T A R S O L O S

*eribertknows*: Ok so it’s official that Janet doesn’t give a fuck about lyrics but this shit had me shaking my ass so I’ll allow it.

*JunkyGS*: This song is pure bubblegum pop for the most part and sonically stands out a little bit because of that. It's not a track go back to as often as the others but it does have it appeals. Still has those playful self empowering lyrics like nasty, "You can be mine, if you're good".

Later in her career, Janet Jackson would sing about bondage, make-up sex, blowjobs, S&M and all the other sex under the sun and, in my opinion, lose track of what made her a star in the first place - a pop artist with a message about the soul and the world.
However, one thing she is not, and that is erotic just for the sake of it. Janet Jackson takes charge, and maybe, in a way, nowhere more than here, on Control's most introverted song, where she decides to *not* go for it. Let's Wait Awhile to me is beautiful, and important, and sends the right message. The mind needs to be ready too. People need to agree on relations and relationships before they go, as she says it subtly but poignantly, 'too far'.

Some might see it as 'ironic' that the RnB sex kitten would sing a celibate song like this, but, in her words, it's 'all about control'. She'll have sex and enjoy sex, but on her own terms. While the ballad itself is average, the message is not.

*cloudbustingmp3*: is it ironic that i've gotten dicked down to this before? anyway this is such a cute song

*mokitsu*: Can't relate.

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: A Message. But I can't relate tbh

*Jailhousepoop*: Doesn’t fit on the album, but even if it did I still wouldn’t like it cuz it’s a pretty basic song.

*JunkyGS*: Queen of Abstinence! But really the song is about love / relationship growing slowly, not anti sex and I enjoy this song slowing things down and fits the theme of control with Janet taking control of her body.

*Kaphox*: Beautiful song, but sorta slow in an album full of fast-paced bops.

In the movie, this song is a low point. The Kid is seeing the woman that he feels will save him with someone else, and his life at home is such a mess, and his relationship with his band is problematic - and he pours it out in this angsty, paranoid, panicky song that originally had a second verse that further explained the 'humans are computers, and love sickness is a bug in the networking' metaphor.

What makes the song special, for me, is when the vocals end, and Prince's guitar takes the stage. The second half is based on music written by Prince's father, who was a small-time musician in his time, and he actually gets a credit on several of Prince's songs. I play this song often just for the second part of the song - Prince and the Revolution go all out and I would have loved to see them jam it out to this song live.
