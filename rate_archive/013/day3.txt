**THE 80'S RATE REVEAL DAY 3: The Way They Made Us Feel**

Welcome, popheads, to the third day of the rate reveal of the 80's rate. Today is the last of three days where I will reveal the 37 tracks that you rated and commented on.

Today, I reveal the top 10 of this rate - a top 10 that is unique in how tight the competition is, the quality of music it contains, and the extraordinarily high averages present all throughout. Besides revealing the top 10 today will also be about remembering the past and taking a moment to consider what all these artists mean to us. For they are a panel of legends.

The rate will begin at 17:00 EST, one hour after this post appears. 

Today I will be revealing #10 - #1, both in this thread and in the [Popheads Plug](https://plug.dj/popheads). Here are some impressive facts:

* I would like to re-iterate that almost 25 %, meaning ONE out of FOUR votes in the entire rate was a 10 or an 11. This is incredible.

* The average of all songs in the top 10 is 9.253.

* There is no score lower than 4 in the top 10.

* Several of the songs in the top 10 can boast the impressive stat that around 50 % of the received scores were a 10 or an 11. The maximum of 10's and/or 11's a song could receive was 57 - so, you do the maths.

* Seven songs from the top 10 have an average over 9

deleted: At the time of release, would Popheads have loved all these albums? Or are the high rates pophead's way of saying we aren't standard millennial and like OG pop stars? 

Do you think we will look back in 20 years at Lemonade or 1989 or Dangerous Woman and treat it the same way as OG Madonna or Janet?

Discuss.

**disclaimer** this is in no way discrediting the albums, just trying to figure out if this is just being treated like wine where it just gets appreciated more over time?

=====

mokitsu: We are definitely overrating them maybe unconsciously because of the impact they had and because some of the artists are dead. But they are very good records too, especially Control and Purple Rain.

1989 will definitely be viewed as a Like a Virgin/Control while Lemonade will be viewed as a Velvet Rope/Butterfly type of album IMO.

=====

miracleorange: Honestly, I think these albums have really stood the test of time. I remember being in high school and deciding on a whim to listen to Janet and being utterly blown away by how great her music was, so much so that it sparked a need in me to expand my horizons beyond modern music. There's a reason these guys are considered some of the greatest of all time.

=====

Jelboo: I genuinely think that time weeds out the music that we don't necessarily want to hear anymore. What we remember now from the past is the best of it. These albums were massive when they were released, I think we would also have loved them. However, Madonna and Janet didn't have the legend status yet that they have now when they released these albums. Prince was on his way there, while MJ was already world famous. Perhaps reactions would have differred accordingly.

I'm thinking album like The Fame Monster, Lemonade, 21, Pure Heroine in recent times could prove to be remembered for a long time purely in the pop genre.

Jelboo: **10: Janet Jackson - Nasty**

Average: 8.791

Total points: 492.3

by: /u/TheKneesOfOurBees (also special thanks to /u/Kaphox!) <3

Nasty is iconic. I know we like to throw that word around a lot, but Nasty truly deserves the title. Whether it's the repopularizing the use of the word nasty and it's informal usage of describing something that is good, creating one of the most well used catchphrases of the 80's, or even just making a video with a huge influence on pop culture, there are very few songs that were able to be as influential on pop culture as Nasty was, and frankly, still is.

But even when just reviewing the song in itself, and not its immense legacy, you should know this song is incredible. As soon as Jackson demands to "give [her] a beat", you know this song is going to be a assertive, energetic and vigorous. While the lyrics might be hard hitting, with a story of a woman defending herself against cat calls and sexual harassment, the beat is incredibly infectious, and you may find yourself tapping your feet without even noticing.

Jelboo make this number one plz rig the rate i wont tell anyone.

Highest scores: 11 x 2 (mokitsu, JunkyGS), 10 x 20 (sh-ether, Kaphox, Reifiui, triptoyourheart, agentsofscranton, ViewtifulDude, bluewaffles72, Xtremlysean, MrSwearword, lordpraisewifi, mindnoises, omgcow, limpyjr, Novvois, Nerdy_boy_chris, letsallpoo, TheAllRightGatsby, ExtraEater, mustangs16, cloudbustingmp3., 9.6 x 1 (Hoplitejoeisdumb), 9.5 x 5 (CandlePrince, DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, poppinmmolly, TragicKingdom1, JoshuaReddit), 9 x 6 (jamesfog, VioletChutzkee, berober04, BearlyEvenAPun, patronsaintofaspies, calltehshots)

Lowest scores: 4 x 1 (TeamAwesome4), 5 x 1 (4Roux), 5.5 x 1 (eribertknows)

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*MrSwearword*: Invented secretly saying “fuck you” under the guise of a sexy song. ART

*cloudbustingmp3*: iconic

*poppinmmolly*: This dance routine is lit! One of my new fave songs.

*spacebabe27*: This instrumental is the right amount of danceable and sleazy sounding to solidify this song as the ORIGINAL hoe bop.

*jailhousepoop*: Another very energetic song! I feel like this is kind of what control will sound like, energetic and powerful beats! However, the song is less catchy than Control.

*limpyjr*: My first name ain't baby, it's Janet – Miss Jackson if you're nasty." DEAD.

*mokitsu*: This song really is the definition of iconic. The instrumental is so crazy, it goes SO hard. It just makes me want to dance.

*eribertknows*: The music is nice, but I mean, there’s like no valuable lyrics whatsoever?

*TeamAwesome4*: I feel like I'm gonna get torn apart by all the THOTs of Popheads for this: I really don't like this song.

*JunkyGS*: I absolutely love the production of this song, the way Janet's confident & fun voice rides the melody so well you have to try hard not to sing along to it. This is a song no matter what mood I am in will never skip if it comes on shuffle, also "No my first name ain't baby, it's Janet, Miss Jackson if you are nasty" is SO iconic. It tells you she down to get nasty if it is on her own terms, which is so much realer then pretending girls don't have sex drives.

Jelboo: **9: Michael Jackson - Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'**

Average: 8.796

Total points: 492.6

It was the start of something new. We had known Michael Jackson as a child prodigy raised by the classic soul powerhouse Motown, winning over hearts and breaking records as little Michael in The Jackson 5 and as the mysterious stage demon of The Jacksons as they broke away from Motown to become more creative in their journey through disco, funk and pop - and then, up until now, as the smooth and effortless disco diamond of 1979's Off The Wall.

But Michael wanted to start something - and three drum beats later, you know this is not another disco song. The hyperactive ticking time bomb that is Wanna Be Startin' Somethin' is restless, uptempo, frantic and no longer innocent - the lyrics are characteristic of the MJ of now - both celebratory and paranoid, both scared and defiant. As he rejects the gossip and invasions of his private life, he gives a strong, life-affirming message in spite of it all: "Hold your head up high, and scream out to the world - I know I am someone - and let the truth unfurl; no one can hurt you now, because you know what's true; I believe in me, and you believe in you."

It opens Thriller perfectly - it is faster, less glamourous, funkier and louder than Michael was before, and reveals more about the mind behind the music, a mind that seemed constantly to strive for good but get stuck on the bad. A very deserved top 10 spot for this highly danceable, irresistible opener.


Highest scores: 11 x 1  (triptoyourheart), 10 x 16 (jamesfog, VioletChutzkee, sh-ether, Kaphox, eribertknows, ViewtifulDude, hoolytoledo, hjckirkwood, limpyjr, Novvois, letsallpoo, TheAllRightGatsby, cloudbustingmp3, dustinhaltom, jailhousepoop, TheAfricAsian), 9.7 x 1 (YorjYefferson), 9.5 x 1 (calltehshots, Jelboo, JunkyGS) and 9 x 12 (ztarno, BearlyEvenAPun, Itsafudgingstick, agentsofscranton, bluewaffles72, MrSwearword, omgcow, Nerdy_boy_chris, ExtraEater, mustangs16, TragicKingdom1, JoshuaReddit).

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*MrSwearword*: the bridge’s “vegetable” moment isn’t cute, but that “Mama-say mama-sah ma-ma-coo-sah” line is pretty fucking iconic.

*YorjYefferson*: Quite possibly Michael's most brilliant song, and he made a lot of really great ones - that mamasay-mamasah sample/borrowed verse seals the deal

*Itsafudgingstick*: Here we go! I think this album is a clear representation of why MJ is the King of Pop, and this is a perfect start to a great album.

*jailhousepoop*: Such a funky dance song! If this song doesn’t make you stand up and move your feet you’re a liar. The “mama se mama sa” sample is also genius!

*calltehshots*: For a song so repetitive, it really shouldn’t be this grade A bop. You’re just a buffet, you’re a vegetable!!

*limpyjr*: The 'dum dum dum dum dums' that go with the guitar make me so horny.

*eribertknows*: I’m fanboying so fucking hard right now. Ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa, ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa, ma ma se, ma ma sa, ma ma coo sa.

*TeamAwesome4*: This song is so weird in its lyrical content, and its never seems to be anyone's favorite. It did have a sick bass groove though, but Michael did a lot better on this album.

*Therokinrolla*: Ah yes. Imo, this is a defining bop of Jackson. The horns, the chorus, the vegetable line, all wonderful.

Lowest scores: 6 x 2 (ztarno, Nfranklin50), 7 x 2 (lordpraisewifi, jailhousepoop), 7.2 x 1 (poppinmmolly)

From the very first twist of the synth to the very last second, this song is a ruthlessly efficient, straight to the point, absolute pop diamond. The lyrics use Messiah imagery to detail just how much Prince is in love with the woman he has finally managed to win over; exactly like Jesus, he will not judge her, he will not mistreat her, and he would give up everything including his life for her. At the same time, the lyrics are a mission statement for Prince as well - don't you dare to categorize him - he is neither woman, nor man, he is something you'll never understand. 

Definitely not the last time Prince would mix the spiritual with the romantic - he in fact devoted a whole album to it, LoveSexy, where the concepts of god and romance and eroticism are mixed in a rather interesting experience.

Imagine this song playing at a club when it came out - it is just irresistible. It keeps it short and tight and there is not a second wasted here; clearly one of Prince's best ever and one of the biggest songs of the decade.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*TeamAwesome4*: It took me a good long time to decide what song would get my 11 in this rate, but at the end of the day, it absolutely had to be this. I don't have any strong connection with Prince as an artist, but this song is gorgeous. There's something about how the song has no filler space. It comes in full force and leaves full force. It's such a fast paced and emotional run packed into under 3 minutes. Honestly, I'm a bit ashamed to be talking about it because I think trying to put my feeling into words is essentially impossible. I'm just in awe of how incredible this track is.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: And another ten, simply put this whole album is filled with classics and this is one of them.

*MrSwearword*: He sells the song just with the words “I would die 4 u”.

*YorjYefferson*: You had to do the hand motions with this one... I = point to yourself; would = still pointing at yourself; die = finger and thumb shaped like a gun pointed at your head; 4 = four fingers; u = point at the person looking at you like you're seven years old

*Itsafudgingstick*: This song is pretty hype, a tad repetitive though. Again somehow it works

*spacebabe27*: Would have gotten my 11 if Madonna didn't exist. That opening line is one of my favorite things to every come out of pop music.

*eribertknows*: Kinda torn on this one. Solid ahead-of-its-time instrumental, but weak lyrics. Overall forgettable compared to the rest of the album.

*LuigiEatsPopcorn*: ugg i should stop writing pointless comments with these songs i have nothing of note to say

*Therokinrolla*: Probably the biggest bop off of the album, once my ass start shakin it aint end till the song end

Lowest scores: 6 x 1 (lordpraisewifi), 6.5 x 1 (BearlyEvenAPun), 7 x 2 (MrSwearword, letsallpoo).

Another album opener exits the stage. In this crazy guitar and synth-fueled dance party, Prince tells the listener to pay attention and enjoy life, because it might all be over soon. Resist temptation, and resist 'de-elevator'.

Yes - the lyrics are not talking about 'the elevator', but 'de-elevator', which is Prince-speak for the devil. Resist and fight the devil, and enjoy the fuck out of life right now is the message of this frantic, energetic explosion of a song. The excitement and enthusiasm is tangible. It feels like an end-of-time song, but also like a brand new beginning. A very promising opener to the album, announcing to the world that Prince is out to become a star.

For decades afterwards, simply the words 'Dearly beloved...' would still drive entire stadiums and arenas crazy. This is a song built for concerts, built for performances, built for rocking out and going crazy. Fantastic song.

No other song received as many 11's as this one. Almost no other song received as many 10's as this one. For a good time, Into The Groove was cruising on at #1, high above all competitors. While this slowed down as time went on, the song itself is obviously deserving of the high praise and attention it received from you. Into The Groove to me is a quintessential 80's dance pop track, if not the best of the decade. Light on lyrics; sure. But they still do their job better than ever, and the music and the hooks of this song are absolutely irresistible. 

This song *is* the groove, an incredible earworm, a song that compels you to dance, that invites you on a trip to the past with its very characteristic 80's sound but at the same time rises above that label - to me it's timeless. It is rather stunning that this song originally was not even included on Like A Virgin, as to me it is superior to anything on the album and one of Madonna's finest tracks ever.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*TheAllRightGatsby*: All right I'm not the biggest Madonna fan but I'll admit it: this is an absolute bop

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: Queen of bops

*DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*: The best song on the album tbh.

*MrSwearword*: should’ve been a single in the U.S. Easily Top 5 80s songs of hers.

*mustangs16*: This to me is one of the songs that best represents the entire decade. It's Madonna at her best, and a strong contender for the best song in her entire discography.

*cloudbustingmp3*: certified classic banger! that "live out your fantasy here with me" section makes me feel so cute and attractive tbh

*spacebabe27*: THE ABSOLUTE PEAK OF 80S SYNTHPOP. Honestly I can confidently say, no exaggeration, this is the best pop song for it's time. It's incredibly catchy and dancy and Madge's vocals fit perfectly.

*calltehshots*: My ass is still shaking to this groove.

*limpyjr*: Queen of dancing for inspiration.

*mokitsu*: I wish I lived in the year 1984 so I could go to a gay bar and turn the fuck up to this!!!

*eribertknows*: Another average song but I was bopping my head for a few seconds so that’s gotta count for something.

*LuigiEatsPopcorn*: magical

*TeamAwesome4*: My favorite from Madonna. It's not deep or complex. It's just sounds really fucking good, and sometimes that's enough.

Jelboo: 
**5: Michael Jackson - Thriller**


Average: 9.354

Total points: 523.8

Highest scores: 11 x 2 (Itsafudgingstick, eribertknows), 10 x 29 (BearlyEvenAPun, sh-ether, omgcow, 4Roux, ViewtifulDude, cloudbustingmp3, Look_A_Fangirl, Jelboo, agentsofscranton, DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy, hjckirkwood, poppinmmolly, Nfranklin50, patronsaintofaspies, ExtraEater, ztarno, hoolytoledo, TheAfricAsian, Novvois, Reifiui, jamesfog, TheAllRightGatsby, jailhousepoop, mokitsu, calltehshots, Nerdy_boy_chris, VioletChutzkee, limpyjr, bluewaffles72), 9.7 x 1 (Hoplitejoeisdumb), 9.5 x 1 (DrunkHurricane), 9.3 x 1 (callmetidle), 9 x 7 (ignitethephoenix, lordpraisewifi, letsallpoo, CharlieCandle, CandlePrince, JoshuaReddit, YorjYefferson).

Lowest scores: 6 x 1  (MrSwearword),  7 x 1 (Xtremlysean), 7.5 x 1 (mindnoises).

The album that shares this track's name was released in 1982 - and this track was released in 1984. This is just one way of showing that Thriller was a cultural phenomenon that rose to the top of the charts and became the best-selling album in history. The song itself is almost impossible to consider without its groundbreaking, 14-minute video, which in itself was a watershed moment in pop history. 

Thriller is a campy, wild, freaky song, a Halloween staple, which is essentially a song about a man and a woman watching a scary movie, when the man pledges to protect his girl from all the scary stuff on screen - "all through the night, I'll save you from the terrors on the screen". The song is riddled with campy, cheesy sound effects and a memorable bass line, but to me it's Michael's vocals that are the star of the show. The emotions of fright, excitement and everything inbetween are clearly present in his youthful and gritty delivery.

Perhaps, to many, the song is overplayed, or too much linked with a specific time of the year or to its incredible video, and the qualities of the song itself are hard to differentiate from its aura - but I still listen to this song more than almost anything on Thriller, purely for the sheer energy it contains and the unique imagery.



-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*TheAllRightGatsby*: This song is as good as you remember. Literally that bassline alone would get this song a 10, but those lyrics and melodies and production and that voiceover on top of it is too much for my fragile heart to handle tbh.

*DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy*: Anyone who gives this iconic song less than a 10 is garbage and has no taste.

*MrSwearword*: I understand the legacy…of its music video. Song wise alone, great beat work, pretty decent vocals, etc. Fine. As merely a song, it’s impossible to rate because the video is SO married to the song.

*cloudbustingmp3*: literally iconic in every single way i dont know what else to say. the synths are probably my favorite part, but there's nothing not to love about this song/video

*jailhousepoop*: THUUUN THUUUUN, THUN THUN THUUN! ICONIC! ENOUGH SAID

*Itsafudgingstick*: If this doesn't get number one I'm judging all of y'all. The production is top notch and funky. And honestly who doesn't know that outro by heart at this point?

*omgcow*: Knowing all the choreography to this is one of my crowning achievements

*calltehshots*: An epic song with a legendary video. A pop culture staple. Halloween was never the same.

*eribertknows*: This is like the definition of a classic. We’re not good enough for this sort of perfection.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: INSTA-TEN LIKE HOLY SHIT THIS IS AMAZING ANG ICONIC AND LIKE EVERYONE KNOWS THE DANCE

*TragicKingdom1*: not gonna lie, I find the sound effects distracting so that subtracts some points. Can't say I don't listen to it every Halloween though.

deleted: 'give it up, bitch,' azealia growled, stretching her hand forward. 'you want nasty to get a #1, don't you?'

i started sweating violently. 'i, i...' I gulped.

'well?'

'I CAN'T!' I screamed. 'BORN TO DIE IS LEGITIMATELY ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS OF THIS DECADE! TO GET A SIGNED COPY OF IT IS A MIRACLE! IT WAS UNJUSTLY TREATED IN THE RATE IT WAS PART OF! I CAN'T GIVE IT UP TO YOU, AZEALIA! ESPECIALLY SINCE LANA IS A BETTER WITCH THAN YOU!'

'oh, i see,' azealia said, narrowing her eyes. 'well then...' she snapped her fingers. four voodoo dolls came out of a chest behind her. she snapped her fingers again. a needle emerged from seemingly nowhere, and it pricked one of the dolls. the doll collapsed.

'if that's the case,' she said, 'nasty is getting out at #10.'

'NO!' i screamed.

'next up,' she said, snapping her fingers, 'wanna be starting something at #9.'

'uh, azealia,' i said, as a needle pricked another voodoo doll, 'i'm sure we can'

'next up, the tr---y song.'

'wait what-'

another needle pricked another voodoo doll. i gasped when i realised what azealia had done. 

'NO, AZEALIA! NOT I WOULD DIE 4 U! THAT SONG MADE ME DISCOVER I WAS NONBINARY! NOOOO'

she gave an evil laugh. 'up yours bitch. up next, let's go crazy, and...into the groove!'

'NOOO! MY 11! LANA! I'M SORRY! HELP MEEEE!'

You know, in the past, 'crossing over' was not as simple as just working with another producer or trying a new genre. Back in the early 80's, there were separate awards at award shows for black and white musicians, and MTV was a channel that played white rock music and rarely anything else. For a black pop star to suddenly work together with Eddie Van Halen and make a rock song was important, and the song made an audience listen to an artist they might never have considered before.

Beat It is almost an 'educational' song - it warns against the dangers of gang life, of peer pressure. It is, despite its aggressive tone, a pacifist song, wrapped in a slick and irresistible pop/rock package. It would become a habit for Michael Jackson to include at least one rock song on every album after this one, considering the enormous success this song had.

Everything in the song works - the bassline is subtle but present, the drums drive the tempo way up, the guitar is satisfying and full (and that guitar solo!) and the vocals are emotive and a challenge for any cover artist. Add to that, this song was written and composed solely by Michael Jackson - if that was his only achievement in music it'd still be a very respectable one.

Wikipedia anecdote: "On the record, right before Van Halen's guitar solo begins, a noise is heard that sounds like somebody knocking at a door. It is reported that the knock was a person walking into Eddie's recording studio. Another story has claimed that the sound was simply the musician knocking on his own guitar. The sound, however, is that of Jackson knocking on a drum case, as he is credited in the album's liner notes."

Another fun fact - while mixing one late night in the studio, Michael asked to turn up the volume several times, until the speakers actually *caught fire*. 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*TeamAwesome4*: This is the song that really pushed me over the edge into a full fledged stan. I'm not sure if a more stone-cold perfect pop-rock song will ever be recorded.

*ExtraEater*: literal pop perfection in a song that isn't called hey ya or get lucky

*cloudbustingmp3*: aggressive anti-violence fun

*Itsafudgingstick*: My introduction to the greatness of Michael Jackson came in 3rd grade at a friends house playing Guitar Hero (I always was on the mic of course) and my first choice was always Beat It. Since then, this song, and other Michael tunes, have been stuck in my head (in a good way of course).

*TheAllRightGatsby*: Eddie Van Halen layin down the iconic guitar solo on this one, man. There’s something so teeth-grittingly tough about this song, there’s just this vibe that is so inexplicably COOL.

*jailhousepoop*: The guitar riff is iconic and the chorus is so powerful!

*limpyjr*: ICONIC.

*Therokinrolla*: To whoever who gave this under a 7, BEAT IT

*Look_A_Fangirl*: This song is not as good as I remember it to be.

A climax in the movie, a climax in the albom, a climax in Prince's career. Sometimes, Prince would seek to escape this song, and it was absent from concerts - but usually, and thankfully, it was more often the perfect song to end a concert with. 

Where do I start? This epic song brings everything to the table. It offers us the soul of Prince as well as his rock god status; it offers us a slow build-up and an explosion of release, it offers us an experience to close off an album like no other.

In the song, Prince wishes for love, for redemption, to see him and his loved one together, in a better place, even when the world around them is changing for the worse. As explained by Prince, on judgement day, the sky will rain with blood, as mankind weeps blue tears - mix blue and red together, and you get purple. When the end comes, when there is nothing left in the world, Prince and his lover still need to be together. The desire in his voice is tangible.
 
The aching for love and acceptance is present even in the music, in the guitar that screeches passionately. The song is a spectacle for the ears and evokes so much imagery without ever having an actual video made for it. 
I saw Prince perform this song twice in the same year, and once, yes, during an actual thunder storm - and my life was improved just by witnessing it. After some consideration, this is the song I gave my 11 to, because even in this rate, it stands out as an achievement.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: Amazing. Spectacular. Iconic.

*MrSwearword*: I have no idea what the fuck “purple rain” itself means and honestly…this is supposed to be ambitious but it is so bloated and overwrought.

*mustangs16*: This song in the pouring rain at the Superbowl might be the most iconic musical moment I have ever witnessed with my own two eyes

*omgcow*: There will never be a more epic moment in music then Prince performing this in the rain at the super bowl.

*Itsafudgingstick*: Its so long. But it's SO good that I can't hold it against it. Could you ask for a better album closer?

*limpyjr*: This was the first time I had listened to Purple Rain the whole way through, and now I have purified myself in the waters of Lake Minnetonka.

*eribertknows*: Sometimes a bit unnecessarily too long, but still a classic.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: Look, this song no matter what is ten or even eleven worthy, I really hope no one gives this a zero, if anyone gives this a zero, we should ban them, just saying.

*TheAllRightGatsby*: The power ballad to end all power ballads. I know the whole "power ballad" genre is considered suuuper cheesy (and with good reason) but we forget that it came around in the first place for a reason, and this song makes an awful good case for why it was worth it. You just gotta love Prince.

*Hoplitejoeisdumb*:  every second of this almost 9 minute song deserves to be in the album, one of the greatest album finishers ever.

If anyone had rated Purple Rain +0.1 more or When Doves Cry -0.1 less, there would have been a TIE and I would have needed a tiebreaker, such as most 10's or 11's (and in that case, as far as I can see, Purple Rain would have ended up in second place). But, When Doves Cry has by the tiniest of margins beaten Prince's other hard-hitter in the 2017 /r/popheads 80's rate, and claimed second place.

Consider, if you will, this picture: When Doves Cry is an extraordinarily weird song - and yet it was the biggest song of 1984, eclipsing any other star at the time. It lacks a bass, it lacks warmth; it is cold, uncomfortable, tense - exactly like the kind of relationship it describes. While the verses are romantic, they are only fantasy; in reality, these lovers are at odds with each other, and Prince wonders if he himself is to blame.

In the movie - and, since it is auto-biographical, it can be assumed to some extent in his own life - Prince's family life was tough, as his parents were in a very unhappy relationship. Adding to that, his own love life was heading in a downward spiral. This song is a confused thing, shivering in a world that's so cold. Who are the doves? Prince has called himself a dove earlier as well; the symbol of peace and love. When doves cry, it is because humans are scared and angry.

I think the entire song works so well not only because both the lyrics, the vocals and the bass-less funk construct such an accurate image of alienation and the misunderstood wish for love, but also because this is packaged in an irresistible hook that deservedly took the world by storm.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*TheAllRightGatsby*: This is a perfect song; an iconic melody, an instrumental that still sounds ahead of its time, loaded and meaningful lyrics, and Prince's freaking amazing voice spanning like four octaves. It's hard not to love this song.

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: I don't need to say anything. This song is perfection

*omgcow*: Amazing, iconic, legendary, etc. This has been one of my favorite songs for my entire life. There are home videos of me dancing to this when I was like 2.

*Look_A_Fangirl*: Oh man, this song. Let me start in on why this got my eleven. This song means a lot to me, it reminds me of some of the better days of my childhood, this song has always stuck with me. And then the chorus, that kinda hit home back then. After Prince died I decided to go back and revisit this song, and that chorus still hits home, even after all the crazy shit that has happened in the past two years for me.

*Itsafudgingstick*: This song screams 80s so much in the best way and it's fricking fantastic

*spacebabe27*: Everyone already knows how amazing this song is, nothing to be said.

*jailhousepoop*: THAT OPENING GUITAR RIFF IS MASTER! The catchy piano background instrumental is also legendary. I actually wanted to give this song my eleven but the ending instrumentals are just too extra.

*calltehshots*: Wig off.

*eribertknows*: I’m enjoying this album way more than I thought I would, but I must say, I don’t fully understand why this is the most popular song in it. I mean, it’s obviously really good, but his singing is more monotone than in previous tracks. The screaming around the 4 minute mark doesn’t work as well as previously. The instrumental at the 5 minute mark is wavy as fuck. I still feel like the song could be shorter though, and I don’t think it’s one of the best in the album.

*limpyjr*: If this song doesn't make the top 5 AT LEAST, all of you are blockedt.

*ignitethephoenix*: The guitar solo at the beginning is also one of the best intros to a song of all time

*LuigiEatsPopcorn*: Super fun

*TeamAwesome4*:  Possibly Prince's best song, and it's fucking fantastic. Might be the funkiest song without a bass in it.

*TragicKingdom1*: I can't really pinpoint what about this song makes it so amazing, but I think it's because there's this feeling of tension and desperation throughout the whole song.

Jelboo: 
**1: Michael Jackson - Billie Jean**

Average: 9.673

Total points: 541.7

"Father always told me you won't live a quiet life, if you're reaching for fortune and fame" Michael Jackson would sing some years later. Perhaps by then it had fully sunk in what it means to be the most famous man on the planet - you become a target for people with the worst intentions. As time went on, Michael Jackson would feel increasingly trapped by fame, which was a gilded cage that had granted him with a blessed and yet extremely alienated life.

Already in earlier songs, the glitz and glamour of his Motown days was revealed to be a surface layer for a mind in turmoil, and again here in the King of Pop's signature song there is a definite sense of paranoia and anguish - as always, wrapped in pop music perfection. Quincy Jones wasn't too sure about this song, but Michael insisted on including it, in its original form, including the long, simplistic intro that builds up to the first verse. Here it stands at number one, often lauded as the best pop song of all time, a catchy earworm that is perfectly constructed and perfectly executed.

The song would, understandably, become a fixture in all MJ concerts ever after and a song he would always be identified with. The mythos and reputation aside, there is no argument against the quality of the song; the way every single instrument works together - the bass, the drums, the strings, everything in the song blends together perfectly and creates an instrumental that testifies to the amazing collaboration between Jackson and Jones. As far as vocals, Michael perfectly captures the hounded, anguished imagery of the song, that of a man whose reputation is on the line. The vocals you hear are one take, the first one; they were perfect, and no additional recording was needed.

As far as my personal experience, I have heard Billie Jean so often in my life at this point that I struggle to hear it 'fresh' and unbiased; I do agree that it deserves its reputation, but it is definitely not the song of his that I enjoy the most. All that aside, in a very tight race for the number one spot, it still has a decent lead over its competition, a testament to it durability.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
*cloudbustingmp3*: probably the most legendary bassline of all time. When I Needed You is shook

*TheAllRightGatsby*: I know people know how good this song is, but do people really know how good this song is? MJ is a genius, straight up.

*Nerdy_boy_chris*: Hands down one of the best songs and videos of all time

*Itsafudgingstick*: BUT THE KIIIID IS NOT MY SON. Introduction to the most iconic Michael move ever? Check. Amazing instrumental intro? Check. A bop? Hell yeah it is.

*jailhousepoop*:  How many iconic songs does this album have? But of all the iconic songs, this one is the most iconic! The beat is instantly recognizable! The violin is magical! The bass is so funky! Every instrument used in this song is iconic on it’s own!

*Nfranklin50*:  had a teacher who literally did not know what this song was about and was taken aback when we told her. That same Teacher also gave me a B and ruined what would have been a perfect 4.0. So what does she know anyway this song is legendary.

*limpyjr*: This is THE song about stalking and obsession. The Police could never.

*eribertknows*: "I'm like, got up, thank the Lord for the day, Woke up by a girl, I don't even know her name” - Abel Tesfaye, 2016. “Billie Jean is not my lover, She's just a girl who claims that I am the one, But the kid is not my son” - Michael Jackson, 1982. The Weeknd did Billie Jean CONFIRMED!

*ignitethephoenix*: I love this song so much. One of the greatest songs of all time. I don't even know what else to write. The lyrics, Michael's voice, that beat and bass line, all of it is iconic.

*TeamAwesome4*: If someone gives this song less than an 8, I don't think I can actually trust anything they ever say again.

*CharlieCandle*: What is this garbage!? Well you're garbage, I'm garbage, let's be trash together.

*Therokinrolla*: This track has some of the best production of the 80’s. I loveitiloveitiloveit! This song is so theatric and its basically perfect.

Jelboo: I feel like there is something I need to say. When I proposed to host this rate, I was somehow a bit of a doubter. Pop is almost by definition a genre of trends, and of innovation, and of striving for more and better - and that endless search for perfection is what makes it so great. That is why I love pop music and spend so much of my time discovering what it has to offer.

As I imagined, the downside of this is that pop fans themselves are inclined to go for the new, to always desire something beyond what they already have - and that they rarely take a look back. I thought this rate would be a good opportunity to remind us of the giants on whose shoulders our current idols are standing, and to show that there is much value to be found in music that is 'old', and 'established', and therefore, *taken for granted*.

So I had a bit of fear in me that these albums would do badly in the rate. That the obvious datedness of the music would reflect badly on these artists and that, in the end, music from the past doesn't compare to the music of the future anymore...

But boy was I wrong - you guys did *not* disappoint. Ever since the scores began coming in, and your comments with them, I have been overwhelmed by the positive reception that **ALL FOUR** of these albums have received. Yes, there is a fixed order from 37 to 1 - but the average scores of these songs are absolutely stunning and show that you guys enjoyed listening to these records as much as I do.

Because I don't think I can say it enough - every song in this rate, even the ones at the bottom, were, in general, received warmly. While there is a number one, and a number thirty-seven, (there was no other way around it - competition at the top was *very* tough) - not one song didn't deserve the scores and praise it received.

So I just wanted to thank you sincerely - and perhaps overly dramatic and serious, as I always am - for participating in this rate and completely catching me by surprise with your scores. I hope these albums opened your eyes to the treasures of yesterday and you are all eager to continue your journey not only in the catalogues of these legends, but anyone else who you might think of who you might remember as a legend, but might never before have actually added to a playlist.

Sorry if this is all very cheesy and overly emotional, that is simply how hosting the rate and enjoying your participation has made me feel. It has been a pleasure!

Also, this [Madonna tribute to Michael Jackson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U4aQatsyz-Q) is something I wanted to show in the rate today, but decided against it in the end after asking around to see if it was a good idea. When it happened in 2009 it really, really got to me; if you're interested to watch, I sent the link above.

deleted: 'thriller next,' cackled azealia. 'and then beat it!'

'shit...' i said, dodging various knives that azealia was throwing at me using her telekenesis. me going into her lair had been a mistake. i should have asked lana to make itg and nasty #1 and #2 respectively. but how was i supposed to summon her?

'well, at least purple rain will win,' i said, 'that's a certainity-'

'oh, yes, it'll win,' the witch said, giving me a terrifying, evil, look, 'it'll win THIRD PLACE!'

'NO!' i scrambled to a wall, barely dodging a knife, and grabbed a guitar hung on it. the guitar was covered in blood. was it zayn's? did zayn even play the guitar? i didn't care. i also didn't care about whether billie jean or when doves cry won. both of those songs were amazing, and knowing azealia she would just cancel the rate and delete r/popheads. 

i grabbed the guitar, summoned all my strength, and started to perform a classic rock and roll song, with special lyrics for lana:

'JUST GIVE ME SOME OF THAT ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC

IT'S GOT A BACKBEAT YOU CAN'T LOSE IT

GOTTA BE ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC

IF DADDY WANTS TO DANCE WITH ME (IF HE WANTS TO DANCE WITH ME)'

----

'I GOT NO KICK AGAINST HONEYMOON

UNLESS HIGH BY THE BEACH ENDS WAY TOO SOON

I CAN'T WAIT FOR LANA'S FOURTH ALBUM

BUY HER SINGLE LOVE ON ITUNES!'

----

'THAT'S WHY I GO FOR THAT ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC

IT'S LANA'S FAVORITE GENRE

GOTTA BE ROCK AND ROLL MUSIC

IF DADDY WANTS TO DANCE WITH ME

(PLEASE, LANA, PLEASE SAVE ME)

(LANA, PLEASE, PLEASE SAVE ME)'

----

azealia cackled. 'won't work, bitch. r/popheads is delete-'

a brilliant flash of white light appeared. azealia screamed. i closed my eyes.

----

when i opened them again, i was in a valley. the sun was shining and flowers were growing. bunnies hopped from hill to hill. i looked behind me. a car from the 1950s was parked there. the driver looked at me, got out of the car, and took off her shades.

'you've been a bad boy, u/patronsaintofaspies,' she said, smiling at me.

'lana,' i gasped, 'i'm sorry. thanks for making billie jean win. i know it was my fault. i'll buy a million copies of LDR4-'

she handed me a slip of paper. without saying a word, she went back into her car, put her shades on again, and drove away. as the sound of her engine grew fainter, i read the paper and trembled at the words

'Next Rate'

MariahGr8rThnJesus: Just when you think Popheads is gay... smh

# #JanetIsTheBestJackson
# #JusticeForMadonna

Edit: Also I think we should have an Erotica Rate where we have to rate all songs from Erotica, minimum score allowed = 10
