**CONTROL VS LIKE A VIRGIN VS PURPLE RAIN VS THRILLER**

The 80's. Diverse, dramatic, dominant. You know the fashion - neon, oversized, leather and lace. You know the music - the new wave, glam metal, dance pop, the saxophone solos, the synth solos and the videos featuring enough eyeliner to paint the moon black and hair gel to fill earth's oceans. You know the artists - more specifically this rate's artists. Four megasuperstars who each in their own way helped shape not only this decade, but the decades to come, paving the way for the androgynous, the bold, the feminine, the sexually adventurous, the larger-than-life image that the modern pop superstar embraces in their footsteps.


We are talking of [Janet Jackson](https://ionehellobeautiful.files.wordpress.com/2016/02/14552105532192.jpg?quality=70&strip=all) - the youngest child of a music dynasty whose entire career has been about taking control of her own identity. She is an innovator, a leader figure, a queen of modern RnB, with albums that effortlessly dance from political to spiritual to sexual, and an aesthetic so recognizable it practically serves as the blueprint for so many modern female pop starlets.

We are talking of [Madonna](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/22/b0/21/22b021dad8cb092ca674d3e52fa4a7e9.jpg) - who at a very young age traveled to New York with no money and only one dream: to become a superstar. And that she did - a queen of controversy, a pusher of boundaries, a challenger of conventions, a paver of roads for other women to follow her, creating some of the most delicious pop tunes known to modern man along the way. 

We are talking of [Prince](http://www.billboard.com/files/media/prince-fabulous-tour-LA-billboard-650-1548.jpg) - the Minnesota native who dared to have a dirty mind, who didn't shy away from controversy, who turned flamboyance into an art form, believed in personal, sexual and spiritual liberty above all, and mastered dozens of instruments and genres in a never-ending quest for the top.

We are talking of [Michael Jackson](http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/michael-jackson/images/c/c0/Michael_Jackson_Billie_Jean_9.jpg/revision/20140727223512) - a juggernaut of pop, a fixture of global pop culture, the child genius who went on to obsessively reach for the stars and surpass them in a glittering career that few will ever repeat. A perfectionist who crafted pop like a mad professor, revealing through music the mind of a man who wanted peace for the world but couldn't find it for himself, and in the meantime creating some of the most iconic sounds, looks and images that pop music has to offer.

What's on the menu? Let's get right to it.



**[Janet Jackson - Control - 1986](http://www.billboard.com/files/media/janet-jackson-control-album-1985-billboard-620.jpg)**

Before *Control*, Janet Jackson was just one of many. She came from a family that had been living and breathing music for quite some time - and while her brothers were conquering the world with infectuous disco, pop and soul, Janet had, like most of her siblings, already released some solo albums. These were managed almost completely by studio bosses, producers, writers, managers, including her overbearing father, and didn't do particularly well. 

But change was on the way. Janet broke from her shell in every way. She ended her marriage with another Motown singer, James DeBarge, and severed her business relationship with her father and family, starting a professional relationship with legendary producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. What follows is an autobiographical album all about emancipation, control of the self, control of life, and not in the least, asserting her gender. Control was supported by well-choreographed videos which helped the album and its singles climb to the top and kickstart the rest of her career - and that of too many female RnB stars to count.

**[Madonna - Like A Virgin - 1984](http://static.spin.com/files/141112-madonna-virgin.jpg)**

Madonna had already released one successful album at this stage of her career, but was not about to rest on her laurels. Ever eager to change and to grow and to go forward, she quickly returned to the studio and gathered a strong group of people together to create *Like A Virgin* - where the controversy that has become synonymous with Madonna already starts with the name and artwork of the album, with what would become the image of Madonna all rolled into one: a mixture of spirituality, sexuality, and just a hint of anarchy.

It remains a highly influential dance pop masterpiece, a defining moment for her career. Madonna generated success for being confident and sexual, and controversy for these very same things. The album features some of the smoothest and giddy dance-pop you'll find while at the same time featuring some surprisingly interesting and non-trivial themes and lyrics. The 80's were in many ways still pretty conservative, and it was often music that challenged this attitude the strongest. Madonna would go on to become the queen of the controversy and one of the best-selling pop stars in history.

**[Prince - Purple Rain - 1984](http://static.spin.com/files/2016/04/prince-purple-rain-1984-2-compressed.jpg)**

In contrast to Janet and Madonna, Prince could be considered as somewhat of a household name by the time *Purple Rain* was released. The talented multi-instrumentalist had already written, performed and produced singlehandedly a series of soul/funk albums that had made the world take a closer look at the weirdly effeminate, outrageously sexual, scandalously talented young man from Minneapolis. With this album, though, Prince was out to conquer the world in one of the most dramatic and epic reaches for the stars that has ever been recorded on vinyl.

*Purple Rain* sees Prince team up with his band, The Revolution, for the first time, and should, or rather cannot be experienced fully without watching the [movie](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AuXK8ZbTmLk) as well. In the movie we see Prince portray a young musician desperate for stardom, for love, and for peace in a troubled household, and how he expresses these battles through his music. The movie packs a punch and showcases the music better than any other medium can. The songs on this rock/funk/soul album are dramatic, emotional, passionate, ambitious, alien, weird, afraid, joyous, energetic and hypnotic, all at the same time. A prolific career of experimentation followed - a musician must create, and so he did until his very last days.

**[Michael Jackson - Thriller - 1982](http://www.wepluggoodmusic.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/Thriller-Album-Review.jpg)**

In 1982, Michael Jackson was the breakout star of an already world famous group, The Jackson 5, who had broken records and captured hearts. The gifted child prodigy turned soft-spoken disco whirlwind and had already worked together with some of the music industry's biggest stars and created the best-selling album by a black artist at the time with 1979's *Off The Wall*, but the death of disco and the perceived failure to completely break through, prompted the notoriously perfectionistic Michael to set himself only one goal: to create the best-selling music album of all time.

And that he did. *Thriller* was a cultural phenomenon rather than an album, a devourer of the charts, a fixture in global pop culture. For a prolonged period of time it was everywhere, everyone was listening to it, and everyone was buying it. And this didn't happen by accident. Its mixture of rock, funk, soul and pop made the cross-over MJ was looking for, bursting into places where black artists hadn't been before and creating the very blueprint for pop music. The lyrics turn from paranoia to desire to anguish to wholesome love, while the music, videos and imagery only helped to further the impact the album had. The success of this collection of perfectly crafted pop songs and the videos and performances coupled with has never been repeated, despite countless attempts to do so.

**Rules - PLEASE READ ALL OF THIS BEFORE SENDING ME YOUR SCORES!**

(credit to /u/letsallpoo for this part!)

**FIRST OF ALL**: listening to Prince is way harder than it should be. [His music, according to latest news, will be allowed on streaming sites halfway the month of February \(12th of February\)](http://www.avclub.com/article/princes-music-coming-streaming-services-february-1-249430). If that doesn't happen, it's either going on a hunt through some of the internet's video web sites, some less... 'kosher' sites, or PM'ing me to hook you up. I also do advise you to check out the movie if you can, through the same means. Below I'm giving you as much as I can right now - some are album versions, some are clearly **placeholders**. *Please* PLEASE **PLEASE** rate the album versions to give the album the same shot as the others. Rating any other version of the song doesn't make sense in the context of this rate.

Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, but please refrain from giving decimal scores that have two demical spots: giving a 7.2 is okay, but giving a 7.25 will give me a headache. This is because I'm using a computer program to parse the votes and print everything out (more on that later).
Yes, you have to listen to every song. I will not accept your ballot if you have a score missing. That's because it will crash the program (more on that later). 

Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.

You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. This is ONE song total, NOT ONE SONG PER ALBUM. You can't give these to the bonus tracks. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results.

You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.

I am using a computer program that I designed in order to parse these votes! You can see it here. While this will make things a lot more efficient and reduces errors on my part, this does mean that scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link at the bottom of this post. PLEASE USE THAT. You can copy and paste it to a notepad file or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE use that format to send in you scores.
If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions.

If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!

This is correct:

Billie Jean: 1 What is this garbage!

These are INCORRECT:

Billie Jean: 1: What is this garbage!

Billie Jean: What is this garbage! 1

Billie Jean: I'm giving this a 1 because it's garbage!

Billie Jean: 1-What is this garbage!

Billie Jean: 1 (What is this garbage!)

Billie Jean: 1 - What is this garbage!

Have fun, and happy rating!
