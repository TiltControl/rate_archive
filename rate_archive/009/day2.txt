Kylie vs. Madonna vs. Britney: Day 2
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5mn8pl/kylie_vs_madonna_vs_britney_day_2/

Hello everyone! I'm excited to get this started. Some general notes:

* I'm revealing 13 songs today.
* The controversy scores that come after the averages are a measure of how divisive the voting was. The average for that is a 2, and anything higher than a 2.2 should be considered controversial.


I'll start at 6PM EST. Let's go!

We're establishing a trend here with the Britney deep cuts. Many regarded this as one of Britney's generic breathy and sexy songs, and some simply dismissed it as pure filler material.

"My biggest concern with this song is that we've heard three TOTALLY different songs from Britney with no true connection. I describe Fever as a restaurant meal, Music as a good homestyle meal, and In The Zone as one of those cheap deli platters with the slimy ham and super orange cheese. It's so random." /u/lassidoggy

"Varys, I mean Britney, master of whispers, plots the final showdown between the men of the free earth and the cursed white walkers, like the true mysterious puppet master that she is." /u/joshually

"Feels a bit like a filler on the album, but the beats go well with Britney's style...the end is a bit abrupt, but it's a great introducer to the next song, [Breathe on Me]" - /u/amumumyspiritanimal

Another Britney deep cut, however I'm very disappointed with how low this came. As far as Britney songs go, this is definitely one of the more interesting tracks, with an interesting combination of catchy production and ballad vocals. However, some people noted about how the song finds itself competing with the other ballad on the album, "Everytime". Some people thought that this song was better, some people felt like "Everytime" beat it. 

"It's not dark enough to really be interesting or sexy, but I like how the song builds into the choruses." /u/batmanji

"Britney Bitch has been so overtly sexual up to this point that throwing this song in there was a bit off. Enjoyable, but I'm probably not listening to it again." /u/therokinrolla

"It's (sorta) dark, but pretty boring. Think Katy Perry's Pearl bc that song was all grand and about a girl who was once great yet it still managed to be insultingly boring. Except this song is boring-er. This song and this song only gets my lowest score in the whole rate, which is a 7, but it still speaks quite a bit about the song." /u/extraeater

Surprisingly only Kylie's second song to be eliminated, this song serves as the closer to the album. On the song, Minogue returns to the very disco-heavy style we saw in her previous album *Light Years*. Several people noted the similarities between this song, and much of Cher's music in the late 90s-early 00s. Surprisingly, Kylie performed this deep cut on her amazing Showgirl Homecoming Tour, as a mashup with the Madonna classic "Vogue". Coincidental, as Madonna probably has the most famous song titled "Burning Up".

"One of two songs I'm giving less than a 9 in the rate. The guitar's just a bit too off to be good for me, and the chorus is not quite impressively catchy enough to warrant one. Madonna did the name better." /u/extraeater

"Ooh this one caught me by surprise. That sudden shift from laid-back guitar to fire bop (get it?) snatched my wig. Queen of autotune "yeahs", Cher who?" /u/jamesfog

"I'M BURNING UP BABY, I'M BURNING UP. It feels so different from the rest of the album, and it's a strong closer. It makes the album feel complete." /u/lassidoggy

All in all, this song definitely makes the album feel a bit more eclectic and less repetitive.

Many people consider this as just a filler track, but it does it's job well. It does fill up the album, and helps close the album, alongside the track that was previously just eliminated, "Burning Up". All in all, I don't think I have anything bad to say about the song, but I'm not necessarily raving about it. It's one of the more forgettable tracks, and it's just sorta there. 

However, the lyrics are great, and some Kylie fans see it as a "tribute" to her gay fans, and acknowledging her role as one of the biggest gay icons.

Several people praised the use of guitars in the song: "The guitars are a really nice change of pace from all of the electronic music on this album, and this song is really sweet" said /u/batmanji. /u/SkyBlade79 felt a similar way, saying: "I like the guitar in the background, and though this seems a bit dated, it’s certainly not bad at all".

"It's like a dance song that would work as a ballad if it was slowed down." /u/PM_ME_HOT_FOREARMS

"How is this so good? It's sweet, it's catchy, it's dreamy, it's everything." /u/angusaditus

Here is where we return to Madonna, with the track "I Deserve It". Personally, I'm actually surprised at how high this ranked, I definitely expected /r/popheads to hate the song - but I love it. I reckon we've hit the point now where I'm going to consider any song past this point to have done relatively well in the rate.

The acoustic track is definitely a change of pace in the context of the album - following the energetic songs "Music", "Impressive Instant" and "Runaway Lover". However, it also marks a change in the album, as this is where the energetic songs mostly end, maybe except for "Don't Tell Me". Some people even compared the song to her 1999 *Austin Powers* single "Beautiful Stranger".

"While Gaga did invent country, it was inspired by Madonna inventing Western inspired music with this song. (Those synths hurt my ears a little bittle though)" - /u/Therokinrolla

"Imagine a 2 week, 10 episode miniseries event on Lifetime TV about the drama filled life of Madonna through the good and the bad, the pretty and the ugly. Sure she's made some mistakes. Who hasn't? But she's grown, she's changed and she's become a teacher. This song plays over the credits and you can't help but agree: she deserves it." /u/joshually

"Now the first 5 seconds didn't impress me but this song convinced me to like the whole ballad+acoustic guitar aesthetic it's wearing proudly. I'm not sure how many others will like it, though." /u/extraeater

Another disco-inspired cut from Kylie, also harking back to the styles of *Light Years*. The song is about dealing with an end of a relationship, with the Queen of Pop offering some key advice on how to overcome a breakup: "lose it in the music". However, many thought that it didn't live up to some of the iconic singles before it - which are "Come into My World" and "In Your Eyes".

Despite saying that any song ranking around now has done "well", I am fairly disappointed by how low this was. It's definitely one of the better non-singles from *Fever*, in my opinion.

"A very danceable track. I just wanna get up and vogue... or jump up and down or do whatever white ass dancers do at the club." /u/lassidoggy

One of Madonna's slowest songs, I can understand how it might not appeal to everyone. However, personally, I've been through a couple messy break-ups and messy relationships. Many of the lyrics really speak to me, and I feel extremely emotionally attached to the song. I can relate to a lot of it.

However, my soppy anecdotes aside, the acoustic cuts is one of Madonna's finest ballads. And there are more than you think, from "You'll See" to "Falling Free", this is one of the best. Incorporating a slight use of electronic production, the song never goes overboard. It is a personal and heartfelt song, and the minimalist production really reflects that.

Some of my favourite lyrics: 

> Dream away your life
> 
> Someone else's dream
> 
> Nothing equals nothing

"The captain of the Titanic would’ve done well to heed the message of this song: “I’ll be gone before it happens”. When the layers of vocals kick in the last couple of chorus, the song becomes immeasurably beautiful, and as Madonna sings over the chorus “about losing my faith” - I think I found it." /u/joshually

"Definitely the best ballad on the album, and a really great closer to the album." /u/batmanji

Unlike Madonna, Kylie has only dabbled with ballads in her 30-year career. However, this minimalist ballad - like "Gone" - feels very down to earth, and serves as a great song prior to the hit Grammy-award wining single "Come into My World". The style of the song feels very ambient and atmospheric - and the production almost seems "fragile", aptly. 

Most people have positive comments to make on the song. /u/Jailhousepoop says that "Fragile" is "another deephouse vibe which I really like! Perfect music for when you’re driving at night". /u/Therokinrolla probably agrees with this, and commented: "The way she says "Fragile" the first time in the chorus is ear-melting. This might be the second best chorus from this album. After "Can't Get You Out of My Head" of course."

"Fragile is nicely atmospheric, but verges on being indistinct if you're not paying close attention." states Dominique Leone in the April 2002 edition of *Pitchfork*.

/u/joshually isn't as forgiving though, saying: "After the hit of four amazing songs in a row preceding this, Fragile unfortunately just pales in comparison. It’s not a bad song, but it definitely shifts the mood, and at this point, not for the better".

Inching its way into the top 20 is Madonna's second most emotional song, in my eyes. Lyrically similar to "Gone", however features a much more upbeat, energetic, and electronic sound. I relate with the content to the song in the same way I do with "Gone" - they're definitely on the same wavelength.

Madonna actually wanted to release this song as a single, however her record label thought that it was too similar to "Beautiful Stranger", and didn't want her to. Several of the songs on the album draw similarities to the song. 

"Built off the same formula as her frothiest of post-80s bops, Beautiful Stranger, Amazing melds the concept of 60s lite histrionics, playful pianos and high pitched whistles with new millennium technology and electronic dance, to convey her love for The One. The One who broke her heart. The One who betrayed her. The One who keeps hurting her, deceiving her, torturing her. I propose that this song is not about a lover, but rather, about another type of relationship: that of a lonely mother and a son that she just can't touch. Hence the intergenerational sound confluence." /u/joshually

"I love the intro. Heck, I just love the instrumentals a lot. Also obligatory "this song is Amazing" comment." /u/extraeater

Starting off as a ballad, the song eventually becomes a lovely, energetic bop. Despite being relegated to a bonus track, this is actually one of my favourite songs of the album - and fortunately Kylie did give it some recognition during the 2012 Anti Tour, where Kylie performed deep cuts and b-sides in small, intimate venues. It was also included as a b-side to "In Your Eyes", another song from *Fever*.

I find the song a happy, loveable track that's upbeat and makes you feel good.

Only the second single to go, surprisingly (or unsurprisingly?). It was the fourth single from *In the Zone*, and was written and produced by R. Kelly. Strangely, Britney's record label preferred this song over Toxic and Me Against the Music, and wanted to push it as the lead single. Fortunately, Britney could see sanity and ignored them. Alas, it was eventually chosen as a single. This song is just *okay* in my opinion, and is a weird choice for a single in my eyes.

"So the challenge of putting Toxic on In The Zone that there has to be a song that follows it. Outrageous is definitely the best option for this spot out of every song on the album, it's funky and sexy, but still on a lower key. I think this one will be pretty divisive." /u/batmanji

"Every word she says in the chorus is artsy sexy perfection, especially sex drive and shopping spree. This song is really good and the chorus is such a wall of H O O K" /u/Therokinrolla

"The beat makes me think of Get Ur Freak On and then I just get disappointed by this song because I'd rather listen to the good one. That combined with it being the source of Knee just makes me hate it. The bridge is nice, but not enough to save it." /u/cloudbustingmp3

Strangely, this song was intended to be the fourth single from *Music*. Don't get me wrong, though, this is probably one of my favourite songs from the album. Not only is it polarising, however, but it doesn't seem very radio friendly at all. From the people I've spoken to about the song so far, people definitely have contrasting opinions about the song. In the end, however, it was only released as a promotional single in some territories.

The synth heavy songs is a very energetic track, with Madonna's vocals being subject to heavy distortion in some parts. Critics praised it, calling it a highlight of the album, and also admired the production of the track. The song was a popular dance hit in the USA, reaching the top of the Billboard Hot Dance Music/Club Play chart.

"If you don't understand this song, then you have not achieved a higher level of consciousness. The transcendence achieved by the embodiment as represented by the high pitched autotuned voice harkens to a state of mind that can only be reached once you've opened up your mind and subsequently, your spirit." /u/joshually

MrSwearword: DAMN, this song is amazing. Should've been Top 15. I think the story goes, her label wanted "Runaway Lover" as the 4th single but she wanted "Impressive Instant" as RL was thought to have been too similar to what she did on Ray of Light.

When I listen to this song, I often group it with "Impressive Instant". It has the same energetic vibe, with the same impressive and experimental production. The song is described by Wikipedia as a "trance/house rave track". It is one of Madonna's few collaborations with William Orbit for the album, who is the mastermind producer behind (in my opinion) Madonna's best album, *Ray of Light*.

"“You lost your reputation on a woman” opens the song. You know she’s talking about herself right? In 1992’s Thief of Hearts, she claimed “you’re gonna pay” but now, two decades later, she’s learned her lesson - “it doesn’t pay”. Madonna is woke, y’all." /u/joshually

"I'm really liking club Madonna so far, this song would go perfectly with some strobe lights and glow sticks." /u/batmanji

"A.) I love the production. The beginning synths slay. B.) The song goes on a little too long C.) It damn well doesn't pay to be a runaway lover because who would run away from this?" /u/therokinrolla

One of the highlights from the album, in my opinion. The fast-paced track features some impressive production and stellar vocals in the latter half. Unfortunately though, the track seems to have been shelved by Kylie and her team. It rarely gets performed, and seems to be underappreciated even by Kylie fans. I'm happy that this got a moderately high score, although this track definitely deserves more. I guess you could say I have a "love affair" with this song"...

"I'm a little more mixed on Love Affair than I am with the rest of the album. Is it a good song? Ehh.. Yeah. Is it Fever-worthy? Not really. It just feels like Kylie pulling together what made her other songs so good. Of course, it makes for a good song, but is it really needed?" /u/lassidoggy

"This is giving me dance dance revolution and I'm living for it?" /u/calltehshots

SkyBlade79: Depending on how many people voted in this, and what the values were before they were rounded, that could actually drop it down to behind runaway lover.

I predict Don't Tell Me, Fever and Touch Of My Hand are on their way out soon tho because the others are MUCH stronger. Me Against The Music should be soon after too tbh.
