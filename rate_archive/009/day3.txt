Kylie vs. Britney vs. Madonna: FINAL day!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5mt6at/kylie_vs_britney_vs_madonna_final_day/

Hello everyone! I'm excited to get this started. Some general notes:

* I'm revealing the rest of the songs today.
* The controversy scores that come after the averages are a measure of how divisive the voting was. The average for that is a 2, and anything higher than a 2.2 should be considered controversial.

I'll start at **5PM EST**. Let's go! 

[Don't forget to join us on the plug.dj for a live reveal!](https://plug.dj/popheads)

Kylie's energetic opener to *Fever*, "More More More", was surprisingly well received by /r/popheads. For a non-single that hasn't received much attention from Minogue herself, the song has done well to inch itself into the top 15. The disco cut is a fast-paced, danceable, club track, which shows Kylie telling her lover that he's got her saying "more, more, more!".

"To kick Fever off, Kylie gives us a modern-sounding disco bop with sensual vocals. While I don't know if it's the perfect starting track, it's definitely strong enough to be on Fever." /u/lassidoggy

"It's good but there's nothing special about this, the beat is good, the vocals are nice, the lyrics are average. It's just ok, not memorable." /u/thelastsound

"This song got me wanting more more more, what a great way to open an album." /u/angusaditus

Another deep cut that's managing its way into the top 15 is one of Britney's favourite tracks - "Touch of My Hand". This is probably my favourite song from *In the Zone*, and one of my favourite songs from Britney overall. It's an interesting, atmospheric and dreamy track. From risqué lyrics, to decent vocals - this song is clearly one of her best. The song features some interesting overtones of Middle Eastern music, and according to the Wikipedia article for the song, was the very first song to be recorded for the album. 

The song has been performed live in several tours, too. From the Onyx Hotel Tour, The Circus, her Vegas residency, and - more recently - last year's *Billboard* Music Awards medley. 

"This song is steeped in sadness when you really dig deep into its true meaning. Britney has been betrayed her entire life - by her family, by her friends, and most unbearably, by her lovers. The only person she can trust is herself, and even then, her mental state has been deemed inefficient by some stupid judge. The only thing she’s got left is her hand. It’s the one thing that can give her comfort, that can set her free, that can make her fly, even if it is within the confines of herself. Fly free, Birdney." /u/joshually

"Dancin' in Circles who? Gaga wishes she could sing about bean flicking like this. The eastern-style strings are what make this song stand out for me." /u/batmanji

"Britney inventing masturbation in 2003! One of her best non-singles. There's a reason she still performs this song at her Vegas show, she knows how beloved it is by fans." /u/triptoyourheart

"*Feel the Fever*"

Kylie's final non-single to go is the iconic title track, "Fever". The synth-heavy club banger has some of the best production on the album - the song is just so infectious. From the beat, to the vocals, to the cleverly used autotune, it just screams bop. If Kylie wanted to release another single from *Fever*, I reckon this song could've been a contender.

Lassi agrees with me, adding: "This 'should've-been-a-single' bop almost got my 11. The chorus is one of the strongest on the album, and it feels like it could've rivalled CGYOOMH as her biggest hit. Feel the fever!" /u/lassidoggy

"Not feeling the circus organ (or whatever that is), but the long synth notes during the chorus are giving me a major throwback. Not sure why this is the title track for this album, when there are way better songs that also sum up the album." /u/batmanji

"omg I’m mad this BOP has been out since 2001 and I’ve just heard it right now where the fuck have I been this is gold" /u/calltehshots

"Just put your lips together... and blow"

In this coming of age album with themes ranging from discovering your sexuality, the loss of your first love, and the ups and downs of nightlife - and on top of that all that an album that has "Toxic" on it - "Breathe on Me" remains a real standout. A sensual trip hop influenced mid-tempo track featuring, at the time, a new risqué side of Britney lyrically and helped her transition from bubblegum pop to the mature and moody sound that we’d see in future releases like *Blackout* and *Glory*.

With heavy influence from fellow rate participants Kylie Minogue and Madonna (as well as Janet Jackson), Britney twists the sounds of her elders and smooths it into something of her own - a sexual, sultry, seductive love affair which Spears describes herself as “basically about being with a guy and not even having to really be with each other, but just the intensity and the anxiety between not saying anything. You don't even have to touch me, just breathe on me." Her connection with the song lasts as she’s performed it on nearly every tour since it’s release (and included it in her performance during last year’s *Billboard* Awards as well as recording mini videos for it on her Instagram). "Breathe on Me" continues being a fan (and Britney) favourite that rivals not just the best songs on *In the Zone*, but the best songs in her catalogue.

This feminist anthem firmly deserves its place in the top ten. The third single from the album, and one of Madonna's best singles, in my opinion. Ranking significantly higher than its Spanish equivalent, the powerful song addresses the double standard that society has toward women. To emphasize this message, the song opens with a sample of Charlotte Gainsbourg from the 1993 film *The Cement Garden*.

"In the heels of her phenomenal Billboard Woman of the Year speech, this song has so much more resonance. I think Madonna’s way of lashing out at a world so insistent on gender norms and boxes was to take those constructs and exaggerate them, thereby exposing their absurdity and flaws, hence bastardizing the wedding dress, overtly flaunting sex and fantasies, etc. WIFLFAG is almost a quick break from her battle to take a quick breather, and let the world sort of see into her pain and frustration a little bit." /u/joshually

"I really like how chill this song is, it feels like the musical version of sitting on a beach and having waves hit you. Only problem for me is the subject matter doesn't match up with what I'm hearing musically." /u/batmanji

"IMO one of the best songs that Madonna has ever made. [Throwback to that time I did an essay for the song as a Throwback Thursday post](https://redd.it/4ydbwf) I still think this is a very underrated feminist anthem." /u/DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy

This iconic collaboration between two of the biggest popstars alive - Britney Spears and Madonna. Coupled with an iconic music video, the song has become a staple of Britney's career, and one of Madonna's very scarce features. A strong dance track from Brit, with subtle overtones of hip hop music - similar to a lot of *In the Zone*. 

"This is still a good song but underwhelming for being the big Britney/Madonna collaboration. And by underwhelming I mean that a song that should be an 11 is a 9.5" /u/calltehshots

"Madonna, I love you. Britney, you my girl. But jesus, this song is so bad. The melody is awful, the lyrics are bad, and everything about it is just so cringe to me. This song is basically me trying to hit on an 18 year old twinky boy while wasted: it’s not a good look, lives are drastically affected, and nobody wins." /u/joshually

"The Spanish guitar and their sexy voices is what makes this song so amazing! It also doesn’t really sound like a feature but more like a fierce battle between those two. P.S: This is a song that is slept on so much. How did this only reach the 35th place on the billboard hot 100? It’s the QUEEN and Princess of pop??? Someone care to explain?" /u/jailhousepoop

"It was pretty rude of Madonna to interrupt Britney's song, especially after Brit just said it was only her against the music... The song by itself isn't that great, but the music video is iconic. I love the Sbarro placement at the beginning with the free Britney CD attached to the drink lid, I think I still have the one with Brave New Girl and one of the really old Black Eyed Peas songs." /u/batmanji

The original *Joanne* was Madonna in 2000. The country-inspired dance cut received very positive reviews from critics, and faired well commercially. In the United States, "Don't Tell Me" reached number four on the *Billboard* Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America. The video also earned Madonna a coveted Grammy nomination.

"one of her greatest! she killed me when she did this song at my RHT show! also i've known this song since i was like 6 or 7 and didn't realize it was Madonna until like 10 years after" /u/cloudbustingmp3

"This earned my 11. There's so many perfect components to this song, and it's one of Madonna's best hits, ever. It starts with a guitar, and Madonna starts giving us Sheryl Crow vocals and lyrics. Then, the beat kicks in, and we see how it fits into the interesting puzzle known as Music. I don't know much about Electronic Country Folk, but I can say that this is a masterpiece. Joanne wishes it could be like this." /u/lassidoggy

Stylistically different from the rest of *Music*,  this electropop-heavy track remains one of Madonna's most memorable. From the imaginative lyrics, to the corny-as-fuck video, to the stellar production. Madonna serves strongly electronically manipulated vocals on the song, and I'm totally living for it. For many people, the song carries heavy nostalgia.

"I'll be honest, this song was a let down at first. But over time I slowly began to like boogy-woogy-ing more. Honestly, I expectedy cookie-cutter pop like the other two albums(which isn't a bad thing) but I got blown away by how differemnt it sounds I really wasn't expecting it. I fucking love to boogy-woogy" /u/therokinrolla

"Despite being a total easy 10 I can't really come up with any part of this song I can highlight and make a comment about. I guess I can say it's just really good Music?😃😃😃" /u/extraeater

Kylie's first single to go out, ironically comes out after Madonna's *last* single. The dreamy, atmospheric track actually won a Grammy Award for Best Dance Recording in 2004 - Kylie's first, and only, Grammy award (so far). "Come into My World" is a minimalist disco song which Kylie pleas to her lover to come into her world. It was released as the fourth and final single, and third North American single, from the album on 11 November 2002.

"All I can really say is that it's an amazing song by her, and it definitely cemented her legacy as the underrated Queen of Disco-Pop. I looked at how this song did on the charts and it flopped in America, but came in at 15 in Canada. I guess Canada just has better taste." /u/lassidoggy

"Hands down CIMW is Top 5 Best Music Videos ever created. You guys should watch this [amazing drag performance of the song that stars yours truly](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MTGU1gLlF6k). 9" /u/joshually

"I don’t know what it is with the deephouse inspo beats in this album but I’m loving it! I like the pre-chorus a lot! It’s sounds like it’s preparing you for the real chorus." /u/jailhousepoop

"Weird choice for Kylie to make a Can't Get You Out of My Head knockoff on the same album as that song, but even a second-rate version of that song is still a bop. This song would have been a better opening song for the album. Would be an 9, but I love the music video, so this gets a 10." /u/batmanji

The second Kylie song that we wave goodbye to is "In Your Eyes". This infectious banger talks, lyrically, addresses the theme of sexual temptation. Personally, this is one of my favourite songs on the album, and draws inspiration from Cher's 1999 album, *Believe*. The production is unprecedented, and it feels very airy and atmospheric (as I keep saying), like the rest of the album. It feels cohesive, without feeling samey.

"The bass in the chorus deserves recognition! That drop out of the bridge and into the final chorus is actually the sound of me dropping dead because this song has slayed me." /u/cloudbustingmp3

"This is probably my favorite song off of the album and the whole rate in general. I see some classic Italian vibes in the production, I love the lyrics, and it’s just so fun and her voice is great on this one. This song actually gave me chills, and a song has to be amazing for me to do that." /u/skyblade79

"The jazzy vibe from the vocals mixes really well with the rest of the song. Not as good as the other Daft Punk influenced song Love at First Sight, but still really good." /u/batmanji

"The quintessential early 00's bop. The chorus feels cut off though, wish it was longer. It doesn't make me love it any less." /u/pm_me_hot_forearms

The quintessential Britney ballad. Featuring a plucky keyboard intro, the song is relatively minimalist in its instrumentation, and Brit's vocals compliment the simple piano medley in the background. And, for Britney at least, the vocals are better than usual. You can't dance to it like a ho, but still an enjoyable track if you're in the mood for it.

"I hate when people say Britney is just a voice slapped onto a premade song, because it means that they've never heard her best ballad and they don't know that she wrote it herself. It strikes a great balance between poppy and emotional, and the music box styled piano and harp play off of her "innocent" image she had before the breakup that inspired this song." /u/batmanji

"Originally I was going to criticize this song and say it was a boring ballad (despite the backstory) only saved by the instrumentals, but then I realized it was a single and I thought, nah I can't hate on the single. That aside, this is definitely NOT a boring ballad" /u/extraeater

"I said that Brave New Girl proves that uptempo Britney is the best Britney. This is the exception to the rule. The standout track from In The Zone. It's a gorgeous ballad with good lyrics (from Britney herself), a beautiful piano, and fragile vocals. In the song, she drags Justin Timberlake over the mountains, through the mud, and under the river. It's much better than what JT did with Cry Me A River." /u/lassidoggy

"Britney’s best ballad. The understated melody of the harp alongside Britney’s heartbroken, fragile performance really resonates with me. This is a good fucking song everyone who gave this below an 8 is dead inside." /u/calltehshots

I don't think any write-up could do this song justice - it has easily earned it's spot. The romantic dance track is one of Kylie's favourites, and a fan favourite, to date. And it's easy to see why. From sweet vocals, contagious beat, and lyrics that any gay couple could relate to. Interestingly, she actually recorded a song called "Love at First Sight" in 1987, for her debut album - however that has absolutely no relation to this song.

"Maybe if Gaga had taken Kylie’s positive attitude in this song and repeated “it was love it was love it was love” instead of “it wasn’t love it wasn’t love” Perfect Illusion would have been a bigger success. Well, that and like… making a catchier, funner, more upbeat and melodic song like this bop is." /u/joshually

"I didn't even remember this being released as a single, but I guess I heard it everywhere because it was definitely familiar to me when I listened to it now. Says a lot about the catchiness of this song." /u/pm_me_hot_forearms

"THE MOST BRILLIANT, PRISTINE, AND PURE EXPRESSION OF JOY AND LOVE THE WORLD HAS EVER HEARD! Like honestly, as unrealistic as it is I'm still holding out hope that someone will make me feel this happy! The production is so lush, and her backing vocals and lil ad libs make the last minute one of the greatest moments I've ever heard tbh.

For this song, and the next song, I don't think I could adequately write anything about them. I love them both equally, and I love them both so much. I know I'm a Kylie stan, but I probably couldn't choose between "Toxic" and "Can't Get You Out of My Head". So I'll choose my favourite comments, and I'll let all of you lovely people do the talking...

"The production of this track is as amazing as I remember it, but the vocals really let the track down a little. I'm not even trying to drag Britney Bitch her voice just isnt GREAT. Its fuckin legendary though." /u/therokinrolla

"[4]: Okay. I know that this is a lot lower than what a lot of people would give it, but I don't see the appeal. It's not the best song of the 00s, or of Britney's discography, or even on In The Zone. I like the Bhangra inspiration behind it, but I feel like it's too big of a song for her. Apparently Kylie wanted to do it, and I think that Kylie would have done a better job with it." /u/lassidoggy

"Easily in the top 10 songs of the past century. Everything about the production of this song is so perfect - the combination of Bollywood styled strings with the twangy guitars in the chorus and Brit's layered vocals seems weird on paper, but it works in a way no other pop song has been able to copy. And then Brit goes and makes one of the most iconic music videos of all time? This was the easiest 11 I've ever given in a rate thread, and is one of my favorite songs of all time. I will eat an egg if this isn't top 2." /u/batmanji

"I like this song" /u/extraeater

"It's Kylie's biggest hit, and for a good reason. Cathy Dennis works her magic on songwriting and production (as she did with Sugababes' About You Now and Katy's I Kissed A Girl). It's catchy as fuck, and it's a deserved.. DESERVED 2000s hit (cough Toxic cough)" /u/lassidoggy

"QUEEN OF DEEPHOUSE. But in all seriousness, this song is just hook after hook after hook. It’s like she merged many hit songs together but the pre-chorus to chorus to verse to bridge all transition very well. Good job Kylie!" /u/jailhousepoop

"I started off this list by giving some songs I already know and love 10s. This was an easy first. This song is pretty much the best thing Kylie's ever done, it's amazing. It's like the most important thing that happened in 2001 - quote me on this. The structure of it is so different from a typical pop song, but it works SO well. It's original, it's an amazing bop and if it were ANY other Britney song instead of Toxic in this rate it would get my 11. And I stan Britney hard." /u/luxmor

"it is true that all living things are subject to the dangers of nature. the lethal qualities of certain animals, such as the snake, have scared away humans and even other animals from the wilderness. but kylie was not scared. she was australian, not a fucking pussy. kylie, like any aussie, casually strolled through the 2nd most dangerous jungle in the continent (she wanted to take it easy today) on her morning walk. but today, there was something in the air, and it was all around. just as she was about to stealthily exit an underbrush of poison ivy, a snake came upon her. kylie knew this snake, for it was extremely toxic. with her vocal ability, she shook the earth by singing a really fkin high C to paralyze it. within a moment's notice, she used her learned-at-birth karate skills to kill it. but alas, before its dying breath, the wily snake bit kylie. within minutes, the toxic invaded her system and killed her. she died. the end. and can't get you out of my head is a really good song." /u/extraeater

"How clever, to incorporate the lalalalas that you just can’t get out of your head, to signify the protagonist’s same dilemma of being unable to get her love out of her head. God this entire era had her absolute best videos, didn’t it? The choreo and art direction of all the videos for this album were topnotch." /u/joshually

=====

cloudbustingmp3: but for a less caps-lock-y reply, here's the bulk of my comment i sent in with my 11  
  
Let me get this out of the way: your fave will never, my other faves will never, and she will never again attain this level of perfection.  

This is THE greatest pop song ever recorded! That bouncy syncopated beat lets you know your wig is about to take a journey into outer space. This song is literally hook after hook after hook without feeling like it's too much. The subtle changes throughout (that weird bloopy synth that comes in during the "won't you stay?" section and again later on, the strings that get more prominent near the end, her little "ooh ooh OOH ooooooh"s at the very end) keep the song feeling like a whirlwind of obsession. It's eternally futuristic and honestly I can't trust anyone who dislikes it.

raicicle: It's basically one of the most expertly written pop songs of the 00s. I'm gonna lowkey link a comment I made on this sub about the song from a while back:

> I was gonna write a little article on this, but I lost the text! I do still have this [info visual](http://i.imgur.com/mwS1ukm.png) though that I made.

> The song's not structured in a way that you could traditionally call 'verse-chorus'. There are sections that sound like choruses, and sections that sound like verses, but they're often placed and used unconventionally in the song.

> The 'A' section is the 'la, la, la' part. The 'B' section is the 'I just can't get you outta my head' part. The 'C' section is the 'every night...' part, and the 'D' section is the 'Set me free' bit.

> A and D are the hooks of the song. C is a section that exists solely to lead into D. More unconventionally though, the latter end of the D hook exists solely to lead into the main A 'la, la, la' hook. And that A section appears in really weird places in the song (first at the very beginning, then in between two B sections, before finally being used more conventionally).

> If you zoom out a bit though, you get AB-AB-CDA-AB-CDA in the song. This actually does look very familiar. It *is* actually verse-verse-chorus-verse-chorus, except your verses and choruses are made up of smaller bits put together. You can see how the 'la, la, la' hook functions differently depending on whether it's put next to a B section (to become a verse) or in the CDA runup (to become a CHRVCHES-style double chorus thing).

hoolytoledo: A part deux ala X vs. Blackout vs. Confessions? Those three are IMO the holy trinity of mid-2000's dance-pop. So many great singles (In My Arms, Break The Ice, Get Together are prime examples) and deep cuts, I probably might have just as much of a hard time than I did on this rate.

MariahGr8rThnJesus: Like tbh idk if Britney should've been in this rate it probably would make more sense as Music v Fever v All For You.

Britney should be w/ Beyonce and Xtina
