Kylie vs. Madonna vs. Britney: Day 1
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/5mgp6p/kylie_vs_madonna_vs_britney_day_1/

Hello everyone! I'm excited to get this started. Some general notes:

* I'm revealing 10 songs today.
* The controversy scores that come after the averages are a measure of how divisive the voting was. The average for that is a 2, and anything higher than a 2.2 should be considered controversial.


I'll start at 6PM EST. Let's go!

ExtraEater: It's the population Mean Absolute Deviation of all the averages
[/r/popheads/comments/5mgp6p/kylie_vs_madonna_vs_britney_day_1/dc3hdln/]

=====

Look_A_Fangirl: Controversy score is basically how controversial the song was in the rate, so like let's say a song gets like 25 1s and like 10 9s that would raise the score. The higher the score the more controversial it is. 
[/r/popheads/comments/5mgp6p/kylie_vs_madonna_vs_britney_day_1/dc3hfb3/]

=====

TeamAwesome4: Standard deviation.  For example, if everyone rates a song a 6, the controversy will be 0.  If half the people rate it a 10, and half the people rate it a 2, the average is still a 6, but the controversy score will be a lot higher.
[/r/popheads/comments/5mgp6p/kylie_vs_madonna_vs_britney_day_1/dc3hh61/]

=====

VioletChutzkee: Like others have said, controversy score = standard deviation. 

Let's say Song A gets an average score of 7 with a controversy score of 2. This tells you that the majority (68 percent if you want to be precise) of voters gave scores to this song in the range of 7 plus or minus 2, so [5,9]. 

Then let's say Song B gets an average score of 7 with a controversy score of 1. This tells you that the majority of voters gave scores to this song in the range of 7 plus or minus 1, so [6,8].

B has a more narrow range, so voters tended to agree on their scores = low controversy. A has a wider range, so there was significant disagreement between voters = high controversy.

Many people believe that this divisive song deserved it's place as a lowly bonus track. The B-Side of "Don't Tell Me", it seems to be the little sister to its *Ray of Light* brethren, "[Shanti/Ashtangi](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IJU8hlmjb4A)". Many people were very critical of the song, with /u/batmanji commenting on how it is "overprocessed, flat, boring and has nothing to do with the rest of the album". /u/PM_ME_HOT_FOREARMS was similarly critical of the song, criticising it for being "auto-tuned" and "unnatural". Ouch!

However, many people also praised Madonna for taking a risk with this Sanskrit bonus track. /u/loloeffeff says that it works because it's as if Madonna met Aphex Twin. Yikes. But some people, like /u/MrSwearword, enjoyed the song, but felt that it didn't fit with the rest of *Music* - a fair criticism.

joshually: As a yogi, I understand the progression. **Music** is the sequel to **Ray of Light**, the humbling period after true enlightenment.

An apt title, claimed many. This is one of my favourite songs from *Music*, so I feel personally attacked tbh. /u/spacebabe27 complimented the sound of the guitars in this song, however criticised Madge's use of autotune. /u/ExtraEater said that it grew on him, but also joined the exclusive group of...

People who mentioned Hannah Montana: /u/jamesfog, /u/batmanji and /u/extraeated

OK, but back to the song - and my personal feelings. I think the autotune really compliments the song, because it's literally titled "Nobody's Perfect". Obviously, Madonna doesn't lend herself to the great vocalists of the 80s and 90s, however can accept her flaws. She can do songs without needing to use auto-tune, but nobody's perfect. I think people really miss the message on this song, and definitely didn't deserve such a low ranking. 

"Madonna likes to experiment. Sometimes it's good, but sometimes you just wonder what she was thinking. This is the latter. The auto-tuned vocals are irritating, and it's just a poor moment in an otherwise great album. C'mon Granny, let's get you your meds before you go back to the studio." - /u/lassidoggy

Here comes my personal least favourite song on the rate. One of the most controversial songs on the rate, this is definitely one of the most polarising songs. Featuring the truly disastrous collaboration with the Ying Yang Twins, /u/lassidoggy adds: "I'm a sucker for Atlanta/Crunk/Dirty South rap. Britney doing a song with the people that did the fucking "Wait Until You See My Dick" song is absolutely hilarious, worthy of a 10". I don't know about that. The track is Britney's attempt at an "urban sound".

However, the song means a lot to /u/calltehshots. She says that it was "One of my starter hoe anthems that helped me be the hoe I am today. Bless this song". /u/joshaully also adds: "Shawty, we finna go to the club and get drunk wit britney, is my party mantra from 2002 to present. Also, can someone please tell me what that “boom boom” actually is? I still don’t know…. Help me complete my life."

Hilariously, the song was produced by acclaimed musician Tricky Stewart. Since this trainwreck, he produced "Baby" by Britney Spears, "Hard" by Rihanna, and "Up Out My Face" by Mariah Carey. So have things really gotten any better? At least he has "Single Ladies" by Beyoncé in his back catalogue...

... but soon enough, we're back to Madonna. It seems like people like the bops and hoe anthems from this album, but the ballads, not so much. Like many of the Madonna songs in this album, many criticise it for being a good song at heart, however simply drags on for too long. Are you in the team of people who think this is an emotional, heartfelt story? Or one of the people who simply regard this as a seven-minute dive into hell? I'd place myself firmly in the former.

"It's one of the stranger tracks on Music, but it's enjoyable. Her syllable-by-syllable, robotic delivery is impressive, and her French wasn't cringey either." - /u/lassidoggy

I also really enjoy the performance of this song at the Confessions Tour: [link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQIbh3LWDo4), where she brings out an Indian singer to join her onstage. I feel like that performance really does the song justice, and from one of her best tours.

"An even more odd track than Nobody’s Perfect, Paradise is like a 6 minute MOMA performance art piece: the extreme autotune, the Franch spoken interlude, the unnerving whispering, it all conglomerates into a sound so mind-bending, yet ultimately so heartbreaking, that even if you don’t understand what is happening, viscerally, you are moved to weeping." - /u/joshually

Certainly better than the previous *Music* bonus track "Cyber-Raga", "The Answer" is a gem in Britney's catalogue of rarities. The beat is really catchy, and lends itself to Britney's breathy and youthful vocals. I almost imagine this song as having the catchy beat of "(I Got That) Boom Boom)", and the really nice vocals from other *In the Zone* songs such as "Touch of My Hand" and "Breath on Me".

/u/SkyBlade79 was less complimentary, and asked: "why did britney even get famous with songs like these?"

Several people noted the similarities between this song and "I'm a Slave 4 U". However, "I'm a Slave 4 U" is a modern masterpiece so I'm here for that! The beat is just as catchy.

What do you guys think of this song? Too low, too high? answer me!

Madonna is no stranger to dabbling with foreign languages, and this is one of them. Her Spanish rendition of "What it Feels Like for a Girl"

/u/batmanji adds: "I'm assuming this was made either with the hopes of charting in Spanish speaking countries, or Madonna spent a lot of time touring in Latin/South America and performed this instead. Either way, it's not great. The translation is fine, but the pronunciation makes it really obvious she doesn't know what she's saying."

Most people liked this song, and just gave it the same score as they did with the English version. /u/Luxmor was a bit less forgiving, however, and comments: "Why did she think this song needed a (presumably broken) spanish version? It really didn't. Like, I'd get it if she were a native spanish speaker or something, but this just confuses me.".

"DIOS MIO, la voz de Madonna en Espanol es muy rica." - /u/mrswearword

"Si yo fuera una niña adolescente a principios de los años 2000, este habría sido mi himno" - /u/jamesfog

Here it comes... I don't think I could do this song justice with my writeup. Madonna's famous - or, depending how you view it, infamous - cover of the Don McLean classic "American Pie". This is also the most controversial song on the rate, so stick with me for this one.

I'd like to note first that we were rating the album version of this song - which is different from the video edit. Many people's hate of this cover comes from the video version, which is a disastrous remix of the album version, which - in some ways - sticks to its "roots". It is more of a ballad, and is driven by simpler and less electronic production.

"I'm not sure why she decided to include a cover and then also make it a single, but I do like this song. I knew all the lyrics start to finish back when it came out." - /u/angusaditus

"I wish this had been left off of the album, tbh. It really sticks out like a sore thumb and it's just a pretty lackluster cover." - /u/triptoyourheart

We finally return to our good old friend Miss Britney Spears. Quite a forgettable song, however features some of the more interesting instrumentation from *In the Zone*. /u/batmanji didn't care for it quite so much however, and gave his thoughts: "This song pisses me off because it ruins what is such a good run of songs before it. I like the melody of the hook, but I hate the synth choice for it, the rest of the song doesn't do anything interesting and I hate being told to dance in a song".
 
Far criticisms from batmaji, however /u/extraeater would certainly disagree, and praises Brinty for the international teas. "Can I just say, this album kinda has a global feel to it. I got that boom boom was kinda american, breathe on me was european, toxic was ???, and this song felt kinda egyptian or something similar".

In the end, though, it's nothing memorable.

It was bound to arrive eventually... but here it is. Our first Kylie song!

"This song will probably be divisive, but I really like it. Kylie's vocals are more soulful than the rest of the album, which fits really well with the electro-funk style of the song." /u/batmanji

This is actually one of my favourite songs from *Fever*. It's catchy, has an amazing beat, and I can totally slut drop to this banger. It's on the experimental side for Kylie, but I still love it. She's also serving vocals. I think my inner (who am I kidding) Kylie stan is coming out here, but I totally stan this song.

/u/Therokinrolla was less complimentary however, adding: "A weaker track, the telephone ring thing its got goin is sorta annoying. This track feels the most like filler and yet it is somehow still a bop". Still complimentary enough, though, I guess.

"This screams filler to me. I just didn't get it" - /u/jamesfog 

safe to say, he's now banned for life. bye bitch!

* Annoying: **✓**
* Bop: ✘

Well, it fulfils my 100% scientific criteria. Definitely one of the worst songs on this rate, in my opinion, but at least it doesn't have anything on "(Delete That) Boom Boom)". The whispered tone in this song doesn't do Britney any favours, and in general, this song just *isn't good*. It screams of random filler.

"Britney tries to do sexy, but with the random breathing and the lyrics.. It comes off slightly cheap and vulgar." - /u/lassidoggy

/u/spacebabe27, however, is more forgiving, and labels it an "underrated Britney track". Girl. I'd like to hear where that hoe is coming from, personally...

p.s.: Early Winter by Gwen is a GOAT song.
