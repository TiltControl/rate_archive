###Hi

and welcome to r/pophead's second charity rate! We are starting of the new decade of rates with some [good old-fashioned](https://redd.it/7an7o0) charity. All ***60*** songs have been chosen by people donating 10 dollars or more to our [2019 charity drive](https://www.gofundme.com/f/popheads-2019-charity-drive), in support of the Sylvia Rivera Law Project. [Together we managed to raise more than **$1500**!](https://i.imgur.com/KCwOXMX.jpg
) Congrats to Cascada and SOPHIE for being the only two people with multiple songs in the rate.

###The rules, shamelessly copy pasted

* Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine so long as it is to only 1 decimal place. Ex) 7.2 and 4.9 are good, 3.33 and 7.75 are not.

* Yes that says EACH SONG, ballots without all songs given a score won't be counted.

* Your scores should NOT be considered confidential.

* You may give ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11. Please reserve these for your least favourite and most favourite tracks. 

* You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again afterwards.

* For rates we use a program that makes life easier for both the hosts and the users. There is a very certain way that your ballot has to be laid out, and luckily, as your hosts, we have done it for you. [PLEASE USE THIS LINK TO FILL IN YOUR RATE SCORES](https://shorturl.at/nEIV6)

* If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space! Same if you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!

#####This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format:

>Cascada - Everytime We Touch: 10 Literal pop perfection, carly WHO

These are INCORRECT, LITERALLY ANYTHING OTHER THAN WHAT IS ABOVE IS INCORRECT:

>Charli XCX - Sucker: 1: her worst song

>Charli XCX - Sucker: her worst song 1

>Charli XCX - Sucker: im giving this a 1 because it is charlis worst song

>Charli XCX - Sucker: 1-her worst song
