Charity Rate II: Sylvia Rivera Law Project Day 3 - All my 11’s are wasted and I hate this sub
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/f4vcld/charity_rate_ii_sylvia_rivera_law_project_day_3/

HELLO and welcome to FINAL day of the second ever popheads-charity rate! Together we raised more than 1500 USD to the Sylvia Riveria Law Project, and people who donated 10 USD or more, got to pick a song in this rate! 

Today, starting at **3PM EST** I'm gonna reveal positions #20 to #1!!!

You can follow along in this thread or at **[Plug.dj](https://plug.dj/popheads/)**, where I'll be playing the songs as they go out!


Some #FACTS:

* **76** people did the rate! Thank y'all <3

* The average score was **7.151**, which is really high considering there's no unifying theme!

* The average controversy score is **2.082**, so anything higher than that should be considered really controversial. 

* Nobody enters Day 3 with more than a single song in the rate!

*A refresher on the song currently still in the rate:*

WHAT A CLASSIQUE. ICONICNESS. A MOMENT!

---



##**The hornyness-levels of the music video**

**agentofscranton** (10): girls aloud and sugababes are the two greatest girl groups to ever have existed and the us really fucked up by not giving them any love

**Leixander** (10): don't push the button jake

**moooo566** (10): if i had a fifth 11

**1998tweety** (9): Cute

**bespectacIed** (9): bop

**camerinian** (9): I don't think there are many pop tracks out there this good at building suspense and anticipation, and if it paid it off just a bit better, it'd be one of the best pop songs ever imo

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): dallas austin is such an underrated producer like he gave us hymns like this and rate runner-up Cool

**timothy444** (9): Nostalgia hits hard on this amazing pop track! It's everything that 00's pop music stands for and it's catchy af.

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): transitioned surprisingly nicely from xtc acid but even more surprising that this came out in 2005. Sounds newer than that.

**materialqirl** (8.5): PUSH THE BUTTON

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): "My sexy ass has got him in a new dimension"

**Chevsapher** (8.2): The cleverly-written melodies are the highlight of this track.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): honestly better than most girl group songs out there

**ManofOranges** (8): push the button don't push the button trip the station change the channel

**RandomHypnotica** (8): this is a song i entirely forgot existed but now that I remember i feel a little better about life

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Slutty bop

**junobeekeeper** (7.5): Ok so the title just made me think of that bit in Madonna's Hollywood that's like "Push the button! Don't push the button! Trip the station! Change the channel!" but this song actually really cute. I like it.


**ReallyCreative** (7): It's fine but it just never really explodes like I want it to? It's kinda lacking

**SteelStepladder** (7): Sugababes will never top their cover of Freak Like Me but this is good too

**wavingwolves** (7): this is such a romcom scene where the protagonist is choosing some clothes for a especific occasion song


##**The hornyness-levels of [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SA7AIQw-7Ms)**


**bandnitos** (6): kinda boring but what is the album name (taller in more ways) supposed to mean

**DaHumanTorch** (6): cute, i could see it growing on me but im running out of time to do this so shes getting a 6

**vayyiqra** (6): This was a cute pop song but I have nothing more to say about it.

**kappyko** (5.5): it turns out i dont hate uk girl group pop i just fucking hate girls aloud

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this feels weirdly against being a bop? Like it’s obviously trying but it’s definitely not succeeding.

**violentovernightrush** (5): why did this rate choose two bad songs from two iconic girl groups


##**No, that's Sugarland**

**SupremeShani** (8): I always thought Sugababes was a country band or something like that.


##**Yes**

**Mysario** (7.4): y'all remember that movie/short story where if you press the button, you get a million dollars but someone you don't know dies? is that what this song is about? and would y'all do it?

I grew up on pop punk and Against Me! Stop! is THAT bitch

---


##**Trans Rights!**



**agentofscranton** (10): how am i only hearing this song for the first time? an absolute experience of a song - a deserving winner

**bespectacIed** (10): Transgender Dysphoria Blues would have been my 11 but this is also a fantastic song

**camerinian** (10): Laura Jane Grace is a God damn icon with a God damn story and every single line of it is evocative and memorable. The melody lines are potent, the riffs are undeniable, and Laura is howling out every single line with lived-in passion. Against Me! are one of the best punk bands working, and even if it isn't capital P Pop, they deserve every ounce of respect as brilliant songcrafters.

**chihuahuazero** (10): I chose this song because it’s from an album of the year and it relates to the charity this rate is dedicated to. It’s a wonderful punk song where the verses paint the picture and the chorus distills itself into the barest lines. It’s full of despair yet the title builds up defiance. Laura Jane Grace encapsulates that queer experience, that struggle over not being normal and realizing that in the dark of night. But in order to survive, you find hope. Or rather, you fight for hope. Grace’s take on this may be harsher than popheads prefer, but it’s the appropriate sound for when you push back against the world’s injustice, a world that doesn’t deserve your niceties but your rebellion. Rock on, you true trans soul rebel.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): trans rights!

**ExtraEater** (10): The best song from the album next to the title track. We love a song that relates to what the charity drive is supporting!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is like 90’s green day but bring lgbt subtext to the foreground instead of just a quick lyric. We fucking stan.

**junobeekeeper** (10): aaaah I love this song so much. It has all the elements of really great punk song; simple chords, anthemic chorus, and a powerful message. What more could you ask for!

**kappyko** (10): yas

**selegend** (10): i love you laura

**SteelStepladder** (10): Popheads really does say trans rights

**SupremeShani** (10): Anyone who gives this less than a ten is a transphobic, and also tasteless because this is a good song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Laura Jane Grace said fuck TERFs!

**TiltControls** (9.5): Trans rights!

**Mysario** (9.1): not the best song on the album or even AM!'s best album, but it's still absolutely fantastic! PUNK IS NOT DEAD

**1998tweety** (9): This is cute

**RandomHypnotica** (9): very appropriate for the rate given the charity chosen, and although it's not typically the type of music this sub rates I hope everyone else can appreciate it too (cause it kinda bangs)

**skargardin** (9): banger

**TragicKingdom1** (9): for some reason the melody reminds me of the stanley steamers jingle

**wavingwolves** (9): i'd never heard this song before but this fucking rocks

**Leixander** (8.5): very meta

**ManofOranges** (8.5): Trans rights

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): did they sample christmas wrapping by the waitresses? either way, like it!

**alasyorick** (8.4): great guitar

**Chevsapher** (8.1): A bit too on-the-nose, perhaps, but there's rawness inside the chaos.

**bandnitos** (8): trans rights! also this is a banger

**Tolk1en** (8): one of my favorite discovery of this rate

**untutorable** (8): we had no choice but to stan trans rock legend ljg

**waluigiest** (8): damn I wish I’d known about this in high school

**berober04** (7): EA give me Skate 4 you cowards.

**vayyiqra** (7): I've never listened to much Against Me! and don't really like punk, but this is great :) I should listen to this whole album


##**Trans Lefts!**


**evilqueenlex** (5): I like rock music but I didn't like this tbh but I don't feel it's fair to rate it any lower because it isn't bad, I just don't like it.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): i’ve really been into rock lately but this isn’t special

**timothy444** (4): Generic sounding rock

**violentovernightrush** (4): i can't tell if i'm supposed to find this problematic?? also it's not my genre of music. nonetheless: TRANS RIGHTS!

**mms82** (3): i know i should support this song given donated to a trans rights group to get into this rate but its just not good :/

**DaHumanTorch** (2): this would have been a 1 if it wasn't for the great lyrical content (in 2013 too, ahead of their time!). i don't think this type of song is gonna get very far considering this is a pop subreddit full of gays

##**Toni Braxton**

**materialqirl** (11): YESSSS!!!!!! YESSSSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**selegend** (11): THEEEE best song ever.

**yourfacesucksass** (11): me to every past lover (who now?)

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): toni legend

**ManofOranges** (10): Holy hell this song is good

**1998tweety** (9.5): Oh wow this bops quite hard

**violentovernightrush** (9.2): oh shiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiit, this really went for it

**Chevsapher** (9.1): The basslines, the ad-libs, the bridge... this is ear candy!

**DaHumanTorch** (9): toni an icon...r&b perfection

**ningxin17** (9): this music video tho!! also Tamar’s backing vocals!

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song sounds like a lotttt of other songs in the genre in the late 90s/early 00s but it stands out through Toni's vocals, she really goes off here

**SupremeShani** (9): I miss this type of music so much.

**camerinian** (8): Jesus what a fucking hook that is

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Not unbreak my heart? hmm

**Leixander** (8): very late 1990s/early 2000s r&b, love it

**Mysario** (8): I miss this R&B sound. There's nothing super special about this song in context of that era but it defo still slaps

**wavingwolves** (8): you're right and you should say it toni

**anothertown** (7.5): I love that there are two Darkchild tags in the beginning, that’s history. Anyway, these lyrics are iconic and should be in the dictionary under “petty”

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): It's a good song, I just wish her voice wasn't mixed to a low murmur

**Tolk1en** (7): Unfortunately a bit too repetitive but still a bop


##**Tamar Braxton**


**timothy444** (6.5): Nothing special

**bandnitos** (6): kind of a serve but not a full serve also god it's so dated

**J\_Toe** (6): title is a yikes though

**vayyiqra** (6): I would write a long half-serious comment interrogating notions of what being a man even means in our sociocultural context or some crap but I'm getting tired after doing this rate for a few hours so I have nothing sorry. This is a *very* late-90s R&B song (2000 still counts) and that's all I can say about it.

**bespectacIed** (5): who included this in a rate celebrating trans people

**SteelStepladder** (5): Toni Braxton was in the Oogieloves and the Big Balloon Adventure and I'll never forgive her for that. Also this song is kinda mediocre.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): I like the lyrics and how shamelessly rude and shady they are but the instrumental does nothing for me

##**:comfy:**


**poppinmmolly** (11): when I saw this was picked I was like wow what a fucking banger whoever submitted this has impeccable taste

**1998tweety** (10): Black excellence, we love to see it

**agentofscranton** (10): this is one of my all time favourite songs and that chorus is so fucking phenomenal - it’s sex in auditory form - i have no clue what the hell she’s singing about most of the time but she delivers the chorus with so much power and passion that you can’t help but stand up and yell “YES! there IS a shark in the water! you go VV!”

**anothertown** (10): In college I took a class on film music and I was like yes i get it but nothing exemplifies the effect of putting the right music to film better than the Degrassi Shark in the Water Carnival Promo https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FivKixdo5x8

**Leixander** (10): in a better world, this would be #1 for at least 10 weeks everywhere

**untutorable** (10): this was in a degrassi promo so you know it's a banger

**violentovernightrush** (10): god why did we as people stop playing this song everywhere

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): degrassi stans where yall at

**bespectacIed** (9): massive bop that I have only listened now

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh WOW

**junobeekeeper** (9): Sharks are good. This song is good. Degrassi's quality is debatable but I literally only remember one subplot from it with a creepy teacher so... anyway cool song!

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): a bop and a half, the chorus is OUTSTANDING

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): degrassi: the next generation season 10 promo I see you

**Chevsapher** (8.3): The chorus grabbed me and didn't let go.

**SupremeShani** (8): This song builds up its dramatics in the best way possible.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): This sounds like something that would be in the Spongebob musical

**waluigiest** (8): holy shit I forgot about this song!!!! What a throwback wow

**Mysario** (7.5): look, she does the "doo do do do", sings part of a nursery rhyme, and clearly enunciated "BABY there's a SHARK"... she knew what she was doing

**bandnitos** (7): the name made me think of blood in the water from legally blonde the musical but like . it sounds like background music in an erectile dysfunction medicine commercial but it goes off

**chihuahuazero** (7): Is this what Tori Kelly tried to do?

**DaHumanTorch** (7): aww this was a cute happy bop

**SteelStepladder** (7): This is just perfect buttery late 2000's pop. I used to get it confused with put your records on all the time.

Paloma's voice is really comforting and this song just brings back memories from like high school bus rides in the rain, looking out the window and imagining myself in a sad rom-com.

##**Didn't comment AND didn't give their _own_ entry a 10**

**alasyorick** (9.5): 


##**People who are afraid of u/leixanders wraith**

**Leixander** (10): underrated legend, served 4 great pop albums and popheads is still sleeping!

**wavingwolves** (10): the bridge + the instrumental post bridge + the last chorus + the post last chorus = perfection

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): underrated alligator tearjerker

**violentovernightrush** (9.1): paloma really did that though, the british excellence in this rate kinda makes me not hate britain for once

**1998tweety** (9): This is quite nice

**ReallyCreative** (9): an anthem for my never-felt-love-before gay ass when I saw a hot guy in passing, Miss Faith hits the octave up and we're on a journey to greatness

**timothy444** (9): Strong 8, light 9

**junobeekeeper** (8.9): I'm picturing myself in a Waffle House doing the Audrey from Twin Peaks dance to this song. It's nice.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.6): that dramatic diane warren magic

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): her vocals phew

**Chevsapher** (8.4): The second half... oh my gosh.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Sia?

**rickikardashian** (8): is this Sia?

**SupremeShani** (8): This has nothing to do with the song, but Paloma Faith's album covers are all so gorgeous.

**Mysario** (7.6): great voice but average song

**bandnitos** (7): it's alright

**bespectacIed** (7): paloma deserved a crumb of lana, amy, adele's success

**SteelStepladder** (7): Solid song with a solid climax. Just solid all around

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): Not particularly special, but I’m a sucker for any orchestral based music

**vayyiqra** (7): I swear I have seen the name Paloma Faith so many times, and never listened to her, and this is ... alright. It's just the Amy Winehouse retro chanteuse thing, but more strings, which I am for, so I think it could grow on me. I want to know what the rest of her music is like now.


##**People who will not be spared in the uprisings**


**realboxwood** (6.5): Sia?

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6.5): idk why i though paloma faith was a male latin pop singer

**camerinian** (6): God I wish I liked Paloma Faith’s music more than I do, cos she seems fucking crackup, but this is pretty boring Amy Winehouse-lite soul, and tha marching band-ass beat does not suit this song at all. If Paloma was a weaker personality than she is, this would probably be rated a lot lower tbh

**slimboyfriend** (6): Even with the strings and vocals, this song still somehow stays static the whole way through

**waluigiest** (6): sia????

**anothertown** (5): cookie cutter neo soul. It is so jarring when she goes from her low register straight into that high-pitched belt it sounds like she’s on helium

**kappyko** (3): did sia write for her [looks up credits] DIANE WARREN???

Gay rights! But slightly too long for me to give it a higher score. Sorry, social media ruined my attention span.

##**Can actually sit through all of Titanic**


**agentofscranton** (10): stan the it's always sunny in philadelphia dance routine

**anothertown** (10): There is this art piece at the Guggenheim called “Gold Field” that is a thin sheet of pure gold the size of a dinner table. In 1990, another artist went to see it, feeling hopeless after 9 years of HIV/AIDS, 8 years of Reagan, the 80s in general, and said Gold Field represented “a new landscape, a possible horizon, a place of rest and absolute beauty… a place to dream, to regain energy, to dare.” Putting aside the implications of an artist saying that about an item that is essentially capital, I imagine the pop gays of 1990 felt the same about George Michael’s anthem.

**bespectacIed** (10): As a fashion f*g this song is iconic to me because of the Versace Fall 1991 show finale with all the iconic supermodels, which was then recreated with the Versace Spring/Summer 2018 show. Iconic video, too. We miss u george

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i want a time machine so i can go to a park restroom in the 90s and let george michael [redacted] my [redacted]

**DaHumanTorch** (10): george michael is LEGENDARY and so is this song. tho it definitely could've been shorter but that's just my low attention span speaking

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WE LOVE A GAY ANTHEM BY THE KING OF THE GAYS!

**junobeekeeper** (10): Classic. Always fresh, always exciting, always fun. Feels good feels organic. Also I know a priest who wants to sing this at a gay wedding, but that's unrelated.

**SteelStepladder** (10): I miss George Michael so much

**TragicKingdom1** (10): "why aren't there any interesting male pop stars?" popheads says before sending this masterpiece out on day 2

**Mysario** (9.5): thank you to the hero who put this song in the rate! I would've gave it an 11 but honestly the song goes on way too long for me to enjoy

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): An iconic anthem hurt by its disgusting use by corporations in cheesy yogurt and prescription medication commercials, truly deserves better

**Chevsapher** (9): Musically jubilant, lyrically blunt and honest. George Michael's delivery is always great, and

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): haha car commercial

**violentovernightrush** (9): /u/oliveoilgemini ily!

**waluigiest** (9): subtle coming out anthem!!!

**wavingwolves** (9): this was lowkey ruined for me because of how many commercials play it but it's still an uplifting banger

**camerinian** (8): Cannot believe I never gave this song the time of day before now, I love the anger in this

**vayyiqra** (6): 1) I thought this was Toto's "Africa" when it came on 2) I don't love this song but it's a classic 3) support George Michael don't be homophobic.



##**Attention Span Deficiency**


**ManofOranges** (8): Does it really have 6 minutes

**1998tweety** (7.5): It's nice....a bit long though.

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): way too fucking long

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): It’s a bop but did it really need to be 6+ minutes long

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): sort of a gay anthem but kinda boring

**chihuahuazero** (6): I’m still figuring out the appeal of George Michael’s solo career.

**SupremeShani** (6): No disrespect to George Michael, but I never really cared for this song too much.


**mms82** (3.5): always sunny is the only good thing about this song

**bandnitos** (2): i am sorry george but ... i can't i can't

**kappyko** (2): baggy but make it 6 mins also i dont like george michael that much sorry hot guy that likes careless whisper. this made me almost quit the rate sorry

##**Cries over Carly's lost disco era**


**ReallyCreative** (11): To all the gays who have been crying in this sub, desperate for Carly to release "Disco Sweat," get your ass in line and STAN. This bop is everything you need, a catchy chorus, solid production, and a bridge to DIE for. The last minute and fifteen seconds are an event, Gavin Turek is a GODDESS and I will be WORSHIPPING AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY. Can you homosexuals say the same?

**1998tweety** (10): Oh wow this is actually a massive serve.

**agentofscranton** (10): ok i’m obsessed with this song, god bless whoever submitted this

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): this song ran so Dont Start Now could run even faster

**ExtraEater** (10): One great discovery from this rate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait idk this song and it’s a major bop? Maybe we do stan

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): thank you to whoever submitted this you’re cool

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I love the throwback vibes on this! I hope her popularity pops off like Lizzo someday

**waluigiest** (10): UGH yes Gavin turek’s music is so glittery and wonderful I need to listen to her more

**materialqirl** (9.5): omg DISCO BOP

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (9.5): who is this woman named gavin and why does she make BOPS

**Mysario** (9.4): this is one of those songs that I really like but I recognize it's not that exciting of a song... oh well, I'll give a good rate for you :kisskiss

**Chevsapher** (9.2): I was obsessed with the Gigamesh remix a few years ago, but the original is good too! Great bassline, great hook.

**DaHumanTorch** (9): THIS PRODUCTIONNNNNNN it had no business being that good...how have i never heard this before i loved it

**junobeekeeper** (8.7): New queen of disco??!!

**violentovernightrush** (8.6): ooh, this is a bop!

**bespectacIed** (8.5): bop

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I'm such a slut for anything disco inspired.

**ningxin17** (8): I’m waiting for Gavin to blow up

**SteelStepladder** (8): This is the first time I'm hearing this but this kinda slaps!

**wavingwolves** (8): this is a serve


##**Wait, this isn't Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia.mp3!!!**


**bandnitos** (7): i had to look at when this came out because it honestly sounds like it was released decades ago

**anothertown** (6): we love a woman named Gavin, but this seems derivative

**camerinian** (6): The production has a whole lot of fonk to it, but tbh I'm not at all inspired to look for more by this vocalist

**vayyiqra** (5): ? Lol I always thought  Gavin Turek was a guy so I wondered who was singing anyway this is kind of chaotic and I'm not into it

Big bop!!! Pots and pans-haters can go choke

---


##**Madonna**



**bespectacIed** (11): As someone who, throughout teen life, had relied on music for comfort/escapism from sexual identity issues, Immaterial is the song that will forever stick with me the most. Two years ago this song made me realize that I have a little gender dysphoria. I still identify as a cis man because living in a homophobic country, you kinda have very little choices on how you could present yourself, but Immaterial always gives me 1) hope that I could explore the full range of my sexuality someday .... and 2) peace that all of this shit is meaningless and won't matter in the end

**bandnitos** (10): my mom hates this song

**camerinian** (10): every great party I attended from 2018 onwards had this playing at some point, and I don't think that's a coincidence. It's also not a coincidence I was on a lot of drugs a lot of those times too but that's neither here nor there

**chihuahuazero** (10): My fraternity turns up to this song. We’re a weird fraternity.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): sophie said "i'm gonna do what the other girls shoulda did"

**DaHumanTorch** (10): a classic. our cling clang bitch only makes bops

**hikkaru** (10): bop bop bop, sophie is amazing at pure sugary pop

**mudkip1** (10): bop of the century

**skargardin** (10): classic

**waluigiest** (10): this song is what liberation feels like. The moment the main beat pops in at 0:27 is life changing.

**anothertown** (9.5): amazing synth stabs.. any form, any shape, any way, anything, anything i want!!

**SupremeShani** (9.5): I'm always nervous to listen to SOPHIE because the way they describe her music sounds like assault on the mind, but this is so good.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): easily one of the more conventional songs on the album, it still fucking BOPS

**rickikardashian** (9): The "I was just a lonely girl..." part sounds like [this part of Jenna Marble's roast yourself video](https://youtu.be/9iIwCPXVDlA?t=117)

**SteelStepladder** (9): Great seeing some trans representation in this charity rate

**timothy444** (9): Kim Petras and slayyyter are better

**Chevsapher** (8.9): Cheesy, metallic, exuberant. I love it. The lyrics feel half-baked, but the production is exceptional.

**Mysario** (8): weird at points but overall v good

**vayyiqra** (8): In 2018, I couldn't stand Sophie and thought she was really overrated and her album was uninteresting. In hindsight that was just because Popheads (the Discord server especially) shilled her so much and were really annoying about puffing her up and spamming her lyrics. Now I've come around and appreciate her music more, and this is one of the better songs on her album and is a bop. I wouldn't mind if this song won, especially given the purpose of this rate.

**violentovernightrush** (8): i know from experience i don't like pc music (respect it, but it's not for me), but i actually like this one a lot

**junobeekeeper** (7.7): Cool!


##**Madame X**


**ReallyCreative** (7.3): There are aspects of this song I love but I just can't bring myself to take it seriously overall, maybe I need to try acid or something idk

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the parts without the high pitched squeaky voice and the chorus but idk I’m just not sold on this song even if the production is good

**Tolk1en** (7): this is 'ok' but nothing special about this song. Feeling like it could have been much more

**1998tweety** (6): Most of Sophie's music is ear r*pe but this is kind of decent. The chorus actually slaps but unfortunately the vocals aren't great and there's that weird point where she tries to sing too hard and it really doesn't work.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): I was having a fun time listening to this song but then the second verse came in and ruined what was other an 8.5 song

**ImADudeDuh** (0): i fucking hate this song and i fucking hate sophie

We take the jump up to the 8.-average! Fiona Apple is an alt-scene queen and this song really shows why she deserves that title!



---

##**Bjork-stans**


**bbfan132** (11): i should probably say more about this because i submitted it but the song speaks for itself - fiona is such a talented artist and i love her jazzy take on art pop (p.s. stream her albums, they are all excellent!).

**realboxwood** (11): I hope Fiona Apple is having a nice day

**wavingwolves** (11): this song is and always has been powerful but after that jlo scene in hustlers it gained a new life. if it was impossible to give this anything other than an 11 before, imagine now.

**\_wailordfan** (10): this music video is the definition of moody teen girls, and was the direct influence for Miley Cyrus' We Can't Stop video and so many others.

**bespectacIed** (10): I always have this feeling listening to old Fiona albums that all white alt/altpop girlies we love today would be DUST without her. She's really the blueprint.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): I'VE GOT TO MAKE A PLAAAAAY TO MAKE MY LOVER STAAAAAY SO WHAT WOULD AN ANGEL SAAAAY? THE DEVIL WANTS TO KNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**DaHumanTorch** (10): this was my first fiona apple song ever and wow i REALLY need to get into her asap

**gannade** (10): I thought this was sung was by JLo

**junobeekeeper** (10): Fiona my queen... this bops. Tidal the album >>> Tidal the streaming service.

**Leixander** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kG0c6CcpPZ4

**pickupthephonebaby** (10): really wanted to give this my 11

**rickikardashian** (10): JLo should have done the routine to this song she did on Huslters at the Superbowl, but the general public wasn't ready for that

**SteelStepladder** (10): I love Fiona so much it's not even funny

**SupremeShani** (10): It's Fiona Apple.

**Mysario** (9.6): I can accept that this song goes on way too long because the last 3rd is just the band dicking around and it sounds good and that was the 90s and for once that's okay, but I can't accept that the song has to start with "I've been a bad bad girl". Come on, Gwen Stefani sang "Just a Girl" a year before to fight lyrics like these

**1998tweety** (9.5): This is quite nice (a bit long though)

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): A slow burner with a magical pre-chorus and iconic chorus, can we talk about how Miss Fiona was like 17 when she wrote this? INVENTED being mean to boys

**Chevsapher** (8.1): This feels like a song that would make more sense within the context of the album. I love the instrumentation at the end.

**anothertown** (8): If this wasn’t in a Desperate Housewives commercial, music supervisors aren’t doing their jobs right

**camerinian** (8): I feel like Fiona Apple is one of those artists who I'd like a lot more if I listened to more of her music, but as far as alt rock girl jams go this is pretty toight

**letsallpoo** (8): this is, objectively speaking, a jlo song now

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): i’m gonna have to listen to more fiona apple now won’t i

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (8): i mean it's good but why is this 5 minutes 40 seconds long again

**yourfacesucksass** (7.9): i've been a bad bad girl, gaga

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this song has aged very well, I would have not thought it was from 1996. Also sis what is this album cover


##**Billie Eilish-stans**


**ImADudeDuh** (7): idk I really want to like this more than I do. I love the chorus cause it has the right balance of sex and intrigue, but the verses don’t have the magic that the chorus has? They’re just kinda boring ?? idk

**vayyiqra** (7): I am a 90s kid through and through, I grew up on alternative music, and this is a good song, but it's lost its lustre to me. I can't stay it's *bad* though, and the bridge is great.

**timothy444** (6): Listenable but boring

**bandnitos** (5): i know it's a classic but i just can't get into it

**violentovernightrush** (4.3): this is the hottest take, but i just don't like this song, i just don't like this style of music (though i love and appreciate miss apple all the same) fuck the 90s?

**kappyko** (4): too long and i need to spite the annoying fiona apple stan on twitter that dragged our popheads panel even tho they have the taste of a person that searches pop on rate your music dot com charts.... and their avi looks like lea michele

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): I know that objectively this song is good but I just can’t bring myself to enjoy it

I'm really glad somebody submitted this to the rate, because I was seriously considering doing it myself. It's just such a good post-party song. So smoothly produced and Tinashe's vocals and Chance's verse are just MWAH


---


##**Nursing a hangover**


**camerinian** (11): oh my god I love this song so god damn much. The woozy, smoky, late-night vibe is captured so, so perfectly. It evokes such a powerful feeling of the party where both your energy and the party’s is starting to fade, but everyone still determined to make one hell of a night of it in spite of that, even though you could call it wherever and be happy. You go through with it, start to internalise everything happening around you, all the while your brain is still telling you to liven up, it’s a party for God’s sake, and that strange middle ground feeling of confusion, frustration and elation provides just the buzz to carry you through. Tinashe's delivery is layered to be reserved and dreamy one moment and elated the next, and Chance has so many quotable lines that get the mood so well. And the hook. Holy FUCK that hook. It's just that right amount of bitter, snarky and tired with the world, but it's all anchored in that shared experience and the idea that we're all gonna end up somewhere we want to be at the end of the night. It's beautiful, it's poignant, it's jubilant, it's everything. I love this song.

**1998tweety** (10): Good lawd this song. Another contender for my 11 but Chance's verse ultimately made me give it to someone else. Deserves top 1- AT LEAST though.

**bandnitos** (10): a modern classic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): bubbling under smasha

**DaHumanTorch** (10): STAN TINASHE AND STREAM SONGS FOR YOU RIGHT NOW

**ImADudeDuh** (10): probably one of the first songs that I discovered from r/popheads specifically. It was during the plug.dj nights, and it was such a fucking bop.

**ManofOranges** (10): This song was locked away in my subconscious until I relistened to it for this rate so that's cool

**SteelStepladder** (10): I can't believe this wasn't a hit I feel like I heard it everywhere

**timothy444** (10): literally me

**TragicKingdom1** (10): probably a top 5 EDM song of the decade

**violentovernightrush** (10): i think this defined a generation but we don't talk about it

**bespectacIed** (9): MASSIVE FUCKIGN BOP. Deserved better

**skargardin** (8): Generic pop done good!

**Mysario** (7.9): the


##**Catching the zzz's**


**ReallyCreative** (7.5): it's fine, Tinashe is great, Chance is good, it's just not that interesting overall unfortunately

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): why do i feel like chance if offbeat for the first part of his verse

**vayyiqra** (6): Remember when hating Tinashe was so common on Popheads that it became a meme, and Tinashe's last album was really good and proved she has talent and that stopped? Not to stan her too much because I don't, but this is a good song and I like her voice. Can't say the same about Chance though.

**anothertown** (5.5): fun concept but it sounds so uninspired

**SupremeShani** (5): I'm sorry to Tinashe, but I'm not feeling this too much.

This is the type of Kpop I don’t really like that much. I much more prefer the bopiness of 2015-era Red Velvet and Twice 

---

##**Safely sat inside a structure comprising of four walls and a roof**


**cloudbustingmp3** (11): okay i know it's tacky to give your own submission an 11, but this is one of my all-time favorite songs and has been absolutely healing for me during an emotionally difficult time. there's an air of ~~mysteric~~ mysticism that transcends language barriers in the melody, and the futuristic house beat still sounds so fresh half a decade later. also please watch the stage mix to this and let some of the decade's best choreo snatch you bald

**1998tweety** (10): k-pop perfection

**agentofscranton** (10): puzzle moon by gwsn and view by shinee are better versions of this but that doesn’t lessen just how much this fkn slaps

**anothertown** (10): the step up to the bridge feels like a dopamine shot straight to the dome

**bespectacIed** (10): One of the finest k-pop songs ever released, that we're gonna have to rate again on April 👀

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i wish f(x) was still around omg...i love this song so so much and is definitely one of my most played kpop songs ever.

**gannade** (10): one of the best songs of all time

**Leixander** (10): love is four waauwauwauwau

**moooo566** (10): i miss f(x)

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): fuck this SLAPS why can’t this be the current pop landscape

**skargardin** (10): kpop perfection

**untutorable** (10): kpop at its finest

**violentovernightrush** (9.6): love IS four walls (would be a 10 if amber wasn't racist)

**SupremeShani** (9.5): This just reminded me that I should really start stanning these Korean pop girls at some point.

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): I actually fuck with this super hard

**Chevsapher** (9): THAT CHORUS. It's so K-pop, but so house-y at the same time! I listened to the track three times before I made myself move on.

**junobeekeeper** (8.8): Fantastic pop song. I'm grooving and bopping.

**camerinian** (8.5): Not normally a K-pop guy but I fully am a Disclosure guy and this sounds like an instrumental from Settle, which I am totally here for

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): why didn't u koreaboos tell me this song went off so hard??

**Mysario** (8.4): I'd awkwardly dance to this at the club

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is good, but it is not Twice - What Is Love? good.

**rickikardashian** (8): imma blame this sub for not being as into this as I thought I would be, because this gets hyped way too much as being one of the best Kpop songs, and I got my expectations way up. it's aight ig

**timothy444** (8): Good song but I can't understand what they're saying lol

**waluigiest** (8): the glamor this has.....

**yourfacesucksass** (8): I feel like I'm shopping at Forever 21 before they go bankrupt

**bandnitos** (7): fuck amber liu but this shit kinda goes off but also can we name this subgenre of pop and dance H&Mcore

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): Sorry if my K-pophobia is showing through but three of the four girls that sing on this song sound exactly the same and the only reason I even know there’s more than one person singing is bc I looked up a color coded lyric video for this song

**Tolk1en** (5): I just can't rate kpop, I do not feel anything listening to this, I would love to leave a blank note

COME ON VOGUE! Also I can't listen to this without thinking of the Glee-version with Sue Sylvester. Somebody please fix my brain for me.

##**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yj9dQDddAOE**


**Chevsapher** (11): The crown jewel of 90s house music.

**vayyiqra** (11): Even though I acknowledge this song has been called problematic because it's a white woman making a huge hit song off of a dance style made by black and Latino drag queens, I still love it. I love early Madonna, and this is one of her best songs from her early era, and it's a huge bop. I love early 90s house, and even though I don't like the drag culture of today much, I think the original culture from the 80s and 90s was fascinating. This is an amazing pop song. (Also, wtf, the video was directed by David Fincher? And not to be too horny on main, but her outfit in it ... :eyes:) Alright, back on message. This song's message is still really woke and inclusive, or trying to be, and I think Madonna was just trying to express her appreciation for ball culture, and she did bring a lot of attention to it. And as an aside, I also love all the Hollywood icons she names in it; the taste.

**1998tweety** (10): Classic, forever iconic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i got to go to an afterparty on the last night of Robyn's Honey Tour where she did a dj set and she played this and it was literally the gayest 5 minutes of my life

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of the most iconic Madonna songs. When I was 8 for jazz dance class we did our routine to this song and you bet it was great.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we stan a queen who got some people in the gay community to ban her music from some gay clubs because of appropriation

**ManofOranges** (10): Iconic

**mudkip1** (10): invented gay people

**ReallyCreative** (10): but WOW what a moment for my closeted gay ass hearing this song for the first time when I was like 11

**rickikardashian** (10): oh c'mon, putting this on this rate is just cheating, give the rest of us dumbasses that submitted _kind of_ underground singers a chance

**SteelStepladder** (10): Madonna at her most powerful

**TragicKingdom1** (10): i am giving this a 10 but i will be disappointed if it wins for some reason

**wavingwolves** (10): i'm gay so it's my job to give this a 10

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): when i was in 6th grade my world history class did a flash mob to a parody of this song about chinese dynasties

**SupremeShani** (9.5): There are far more knowledgeable people here that explain the importance and greatness of this song, so I'll just say Milan and Kenya murdered this lipsync.

**bandnitos** (9): a fucking classic

**camerinian** (8.5): I mean I do still really like this, but I liked it better before I'd listened to earlier gay house tracks, which this really wants to be so bad.

**violentovernightrush** (8.1): thinkin bout the scene in the devil wears prada that uses this song

**DaHumanTorch** (8): sue sylvester did it better sorry madame x

**Mysario** (7.7): I'm a poor bish so I'm listening to this playlist on the free version of Spotify which only gives me the option to listen to this playlist on shuffle. This became the first song I had to listen to so I wasn't quite eased into "music listening" yet. Normally, I'd give this song a higher score but comparatively, it's a long start to a long playlist. But yas I DO wanna strike a pose!


##**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xUbkrlZuAW4**

**mms82** (6.7): better Madonna songs

**RandomHypnotica** (6): it's ok but it kinda goes nowhere for me

**timothy444** (5.5): I'm probably going to get a lot of shade for giving this such a low score but this doesn't stand out. Yes, the song is listenable (a score above 5 means a song is good) but ultimately, it's just really average. I can't justify giving it any higher.

**bespectacIed** (5): It's a solid pop song, madge is a lgbtq fixture and this must have been radical in its time so I shouldn't be bitter that this is super whitewashed and soulless

**Leixander** (5): shtrike a pause

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): This sounds like every generic pop song that plays in the background of a shopping montage in a straight white romantic comedy

**agentofscranton** (3.5): i'm a bad gay i know i'm sorry but i really don't like this song beyond that bridge at all

##**All Stars**


**Leixander** (11): Justice for Shrek 2!

**1998tweety** (10): Seriously considered giving this my 11. Kinda prefer it over the original oop

**agentofscranton** (10): fairy godmother says gay rights!

**bandnitos** (10): need i say more

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): GAY RIGHTS

**evilqueenlex** (10): top 10 vma performance of the 2000s

**ImADudeDuh** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t2s4AJW7cMo

**ManofOranges** (10): Another literally iconic masterpiece

**mms82** (10): shrek 2 bops only

**ReallyCreative** (10): everything is BRILLIANT. the intro, the putting it in a different key than requested, the autotune (Cher's Believe is SHOOK), the instrumentation, a gay anthem PUSHING ITS LIMITS!

**rickikardashian** (10): Look, I'm just saying, DreamWorks would probably be making a few thousand dollars more if they put this on Spotify ^(and they would all come from me)

**SupremeShani** (10): Okay, was anybody going to tell me that the Shrek version of *Holding Out for a Hero* is not available on Spotify, or was I just suppose to read that in a Charity Rate on Popheads?

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (10): yourmusicsavedme.jpg

**timothy444** (10): Forget All Star by Smash Mouth, this is the true anthem of the Shrek movie series.

**untutorable** (10): main pop fairy god mother

**waluigiest** (10): THIS HAS ONLY GROWN FINER WITH AGE!!!! PUT IT IN C MINOR!!!!

**Mysario** (9.9): this song is like an 8.5 on it's own, but with the actual scene (https://youtu.be/A_HjMIjzyMU) especially in context of the movie, it elevates it tenfold! It's a fun cover that people have now thankfully realized is more than just a meme. Simply put, this song is shrekcellent

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Fairy Godmother is a main pop girl and also Shrek 2 > Shrek 1

**camerinian** (9): This version is so burnt into my fabric of being that every single time I hear the original, without fail, I have to spit take at there being no HIT IT

**DaHumanTorch** (9): ended bonnie tyler tbh

**hikkaru** (9): the greatest moment in cinematic history

**junobeekeeper** (9): Shrek 2 was the best out of the franchise in regards to both plot and soundtrack, don't @ me.

**SteelStepladder** (9): Glad to see the proper version represented

**TiltControls** (9): HIT IT

**Chevsapher** (8.7): Eurodance... with orchestral strings? I'm not normally into covers, but this is fascinating.

**bespectacIed** (8): it's on G minor tho

**RandomHypnotica** (8): gotta say i highkey prefer this version to the original

**Tolk1en** (8): This original song is a masterpiece and this cover is great.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): hot take ig but the original version is better

**ningxin17** (7): Fairy godmother outsold Bonnie

**wavingwolves** (7): i've never watched shrek but i love the original song so much that it's impossible for me to give this more than 7 and less than a 7


##**Non-believers**


**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): original is better and i don't have any nostalgia for the shrek movies tbh

**slimboyfriend** (6): The Shrek version is NOT superior!!

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): one of the worst shrek songs

**violentovernightrush** (5): her voice sounds nice

**yourfacesucksass** (5): not gonna lie I highkey hate this song

**vayyiqra** (4): I don't even know what to rate this. It's like a remix of a parody of motivational songs for movies from the 80s that would play over a training montage. I am leaning towards "it's bad" though, aside from being slightly amusing.

**kappyko** (3): OH WAIT ITS THE SHREK VERSION oh wait its the shrek version

That's some icon shit right there. However, I'm like 90% sure this lost a couple placings because of Unwritten being in the rate - they occupy the same space of late 90s/early 00s white women guitar-pop.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic nostalgic bop

**berober04** (10): We used to dance along like Penny and her mom out of Happy Endings when we were at Uni, what times.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6JF56Cfggk

**bespectacIed** (10): Is there a song more representative of the 90s adult contemporary dominance than Torn?

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): one of the best covers of all time period no tampon

**ExtraEater** (10): One of the best songs ever made across all genres

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We LOVE 90s white women

**ManofOranges** (10): The only gripe I have with this song is I'm pretty sure that at the end of Camp Rock that one girl won the competition by singing this song and I just didn't understand how she could win

**rickikardashian** (10): In my opinion, this is the best cover of this early early One Direction original song

**SFbby** (10): I've heard this song so many times but never knew what it was called until now

**SupremeShani** (10): Popheads who give this anything less than a ten deserve to be left cold and shamed and lying naked on the floor.

**Tolk1en** (10): a classic, an iconic bop, a masterpiece

**TragicKingdom1** (10): flaming hot take: the ednaswap version >>

**untutorable** (10): this is one of those songs that always gets me in my feelings

**wavingwolves** (10): this song made one direction and i'm grateful for that

**Mysario** (9.6): excellent song but I have a history with this song where I personally cannot give it the flat out 10 it deserves

**SteelStepladder** (9): When those slide guitars come in... FUCK YEAHHHHHHH

**timothy444** (9): Fun Fact: I used to think Torn and Unwritten were the same song.

**Chevsapher** (8.8): It's an enduring hit for a reason.

**mms82** (8.7): great cover

**anothertown** (8.5): The original version actually whips ass but Natalie took these devastated lyrics and put them on a summery tampon commercial bop instrumental. Always great.

**evilqueenlex** (8): "I am Natalie Imbruglia Torn" is my second favorite Shangela quote

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ended ava max

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): somehow i avoided ever hearing this song before, but it's nice

An iconique song, the remix/cover WISHES it was this good

---

##**That's the sound of nine 11s being wasted**

**junobeekeeper** (11): Ohhhhh man. Tracy Chapman's Fast Car is truly a great song. The understated guitar riff. The sheer power of the chorus that enraptures the listener, making them feel like they are the ones flying in the aforementioned Fast Car. The way the verses are just heartbreaking, and how it ends much like the beginning. It makes me feel like *I* belong, just for a moment.

**rickikardashian** (11): great, now I'm crying

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This was my submission to this rate, yes, but it still gets my 11 for others reasons to. It's such a good storytelling song. It's so hopeful but also saddening at the same time. When I hear it, I basically can't do anything but look out the window longingly for the 5 minutes it goes...

**SteelStepladder** (11): Maybe the real fast car was inside of us all along

**TragicKingdom1** (11): we fucking want the theatrical adaptation of this song. some of the best songwriting OF ALL TIME!!!

**violentovernightrush** (11): this song reminds me of both my best friend and my dad. my dad, because we drove through my hometown late one night a few days before i was supposed to go back to school, and i just looked over at him as he was explaining what it was about to me (i knew, but i let him explain it anyway) and i thought, i'm not always going to have you in my life, and it was kind of life-ruining, and this song soundtracked it perfectly. i love my dad so much and i know i got so lucky to have him as a dad when so many other people have terrible dads. i just love my dad and i miss him a lot right now. and then my best friend because she wrote me a story and she broke my heart with it and it was written to this song and i associate her with the supreme loneliness of loving someone you wish so badly you could rescue. i wish things would get better for you, babe.

##**Tracy Chapman**


**1998tweety** (10): A great song

**agentofscranton** (10): in an alternate reality this would’ve been my 11 had shake it out not been submitted, the absolute peak of folk / singer-songwriter music. it’s so gorgeously simple, the lyrics are beautiful, and her delivery is so fucking on point. just a fantastic song.

**bandnitos** (10): this barely got beat out for the 11 spot holy shit this song makes me sob every time i hear it

**bespectacIed** (10): one of the best songs of all time

**camerinian** (10): God this is such a beautiful, timeless song. I love that it has this wistful, Springsteen-esque escapism about it, but it's realistic about the realities of life that hamper our dreams at every turn, and despite everyone in this story getting bad hand after bad hand, they never let go of that possibility of dropping everything and escaping. It holds onto that glimmer of optimism and never lets go in spite of it all, and I'm a real sucker for songs about the strength and resilience of the human spirit despite overwhelming odds. We love a classic

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): everyone who gives this less than a 9.5 should be hit by one tbh!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): If you don’t find this song heartbreaking, you are legally required to venmo me $100.

**ManofOranges** (10): I wish I had a fast car, matter of fact I wish I had any car at the moment

**mms82** (10): this song is a movie and one of the greatest songs of all time

**moooo566** (10): the original and best

**ReallyCreative** (10): this song gets me emotional for NO FUCKING REASON like my car isn't even fast but I can't

**SupremeShani** (10): One of the greatest songs of all time, and that's coming from someone who usually hates acoustic ballads. There's something so beautiful about Tracy's vocals that just resonates with me, and the storytelling is so raw and creates a story that hits a bit too close to home.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): One of the most beautiful songs ever written

**TiltControls** (10): One best story songs out there. Altough I have to say, I absolutely hate the remixed version that got big a couple years back.

**timothy444** (10): Prefer the Jonas Blue version but you can't fault the original when it was a hit at its time.

**waluigiest** (10): One of my absolute favorite songs. It’s so beautiful it really breaks my heart every time. When the chorus comes in it’s time to rage tho don’t forget

**wavingwolves** (10): lovely lovely lovely

**Chevsapher** (9.6): I avoid listening to this song because it makes me too emotional.

**Mysario** (9.3): I don't have much to say about this song as I expected to but this song is iconic

**slimboyfriend** (9): Depressed power lesbian music

**yourfacesucksass** (8): i prefer the jonas blue ft. dakota cover but still like

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): i feel like i've heard this song before but also like i've never heard it

**untutorable** (7.5): i know it says fast car but i keep thinking he says fat ass car

**berober04** (7): When the then unknown Tracy Chapman was booked to appear down the bill at the Nelson Mandela birthday concert at Wembley Stadium on June 11th 1988, little did she know her appearance would be the catalyst for a career breakthrough. After performing several songs from her self titled debut during the afternoon, Chapman thought she'd done her bit and could relax and enjoy the rest of the concert. However, later in the evening Stevie Wonder was delayed when the computer discs for his performance went missing, and Chapman was ushered back onto stage again. In front of a huge prime time audience she performed "Fast Car" alone with her acoustic guitar. Afterwards the song raced up the charts on both sides of the Atlantic.

##**Jonas Blue**


**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (6.9): i had one earbud out and the first line came and i swear to god i heard "do you get a fat ass cock"

**anothertown** (4): Sorry I don't have taste

**DaHumanTorch** (4): yawn...is the car fast in an old person's terms? because to me it was going 40 in a 60

**vayyiqra** (4): I know this is a classic but I have never liked this song. I don't like the repetitive guitar riff, or how repetitive it is as a whole, and wait this came out in 1988 and Tracy Chapman is a black woman??? Well, I did not know that. I still don't really like this song, although I can see why someone would. Also, it's in the Wikipedia category "tropical house songs" which is ???

**hikkaru** (3): yawn

Eurodance bop! This is PEAK eurotrash bops, and this sub is way too damn american to enjoy it to its full and DESERVED extent. 

---


##**_This_ Feeling**

**bandnitos** (11): this deserved every single grammy on the like . night it would be nominated like yes this wins for best metal performance im sorry sir it just has to happen

**berober04** (11): This is my favourite song of all time. I try to pretend it's other songs, but it's not. This is musical perfection.

**skargardin** (11): This is the pinnacle of eurodance and NOTHING comes close to it. And somehow it manages to still be a timeless classic, iconic.

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (11): queen of early 2000s amvs and fucking up libraries!!!!!

**1998tweety** (10): Literal pop perfection. So many nostalgic memories to this song.

**agentofscranton** (10): the pinnacle of year 6 school disco culture

**anothertown** (10): ----this just in, all scores below 10 null and void!----

**camerinian** (10): where the fuck has my jaw gone

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): timeless bop!

**etherealmaiden** (10): Literal pop perfection, carly WHO

**ExtraEater** (10): This song is everything. It could really win the rate and no reasonable person would be mad if it did

**gannade** (10): one of the best songs of all time

**hikkaru** (10): that was a classic...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): This is better than anything Ariana Grande has released in the past 5 years.

**ManofOranges** (10): Never really realized just how amazing this song is in terms of quality literally legendary

**moooo566** (10): oh wow im 11 years old again whats up with that

**mudkip1** (10): what a moment, a moment that is most pleasing to me in my career

**Mysario** (10): an obvious rate winner! I have 2 requirements as my friend: (1) you are cool (2) you bop to this

**realboxwood** (10): omg watching AMVS on the home computer when I was 9 teas

**static\_int\_husp** (10): the first thing I think of when I hear this song is Dance Dance Revolution

**SteelStepladder** (10): It's almost to basic to explain why this song is good, it just is

**SupremeShani** (10): This is what Popheads should be talking about when they cry about pop music being dead and wanting dance music to come back. There's something so earnestly fun about this song that always puts me in a good mood when I listen to this.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Please rise for the Anime AMV shipping anthem

**TiltControls** (10): Throwback giving middle school dance energy and I love it!

**timothy444** (10): Do I have to explain why this deserves an automatic 10?

**Tolk1en** (10): litteral pop perfection, Carly WHO

**untutorable** (10): that was a classic

**wavingwolves** (10): hello i love fun!!!

**Chevsapher** (9.5): So dated, but so fun.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): this song is ICONIC. anyone who gives this less than a 9 or 10 has to be a dry, boring person

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): It is a requirement to go off when you hear the song

**materialqirl** (9.5): i still feel ur voice..

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9.5): this really didn’t have to go so hard

**mms82** (9): still so  hype

**violentovernightrush** (9): i have a very vivid memory of a sims 2 teen pregnancy mv set to this song

**\_wailordfan** (8.5): tbh I forget the song is longer than just one chorus and the mellow drop after the first chorus is a bit jarring

**ReallyCreative** (8.1): A staple of marching band field trips in high school, this song, while iconic, doesn't quite hold up these years later. It's still a banger though, don't get it twisted

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): early-mid 2000s dance songs were just so extra

**junobeekeeper** (7.5): Even my straight-ass Dropkick Murphys listening, PBR drinking cousin stans Cascada. I think that says it all.

**waluigiest** (7): banger. But its ubiquitous legacy turn into something of a meme, and I can’t think of a time I would want to listen to it or play it in 2020.


##**This Feeling by The Chainsmokers featuring Kelsea Ballerini**


**Leixander** (6): evacuate the dancefloor >>

**slimboyfriend** (6): I averaged out how terrible this song actually is vs. how much fun it sounds to get this score

**vayyiqra** (6): I can't get into Cascada beyond the incredible pop perfection that is "Evacuate the Dancefloor", and I feel bad because I really *want* to, you know? I know this is a classic, but it doesn't do much for me. : / It's so cheesy and that synth screams "2000s Eurotrash dance song #24874". It kind of bops, but it's still just not that good.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): the chorus is memorable sure but the instrumental really aged like all eurodance pop

**kappyko** (3): annoying.

##**Fuck Ellie Goulding**

**hikkaru** (11): THAT WAS A CLASSIC

**untutorable** (11): idk what to say this song just makes me feel powerful

**waluigiest** (11): perfect song. This was one of the songs that I heard as I was coming of age that made me fall in love with MUSIC. From the juicy synths to the gorgeous bridge, time-stopping bridge, it’s simply legendary.

**1998tweety** (10): It's no Ellie Goulding song...still a 10 though.

**agentofscranton** (10): mama this is what EXCELLENCE sounds like

**anothertown** (10): A slickly produced synthpop banger is something that can actually be so personal

**bandnitos** (10): and that's on xxxtentacleporn

**bespectacIed** (10): Bop. Anthem. Reminder of the good old days.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): iconic banger wig

**DaHumanTorch** (10): bless tik tok for bringing this song to the attention of gen z

**ignitethephoenix** (10): electronic pop perfection.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): let’s go lesbians

**Leixander** (10): classic!

**ManofOranges** (10): Lichrally an iconic song

**materialqirl** (10): :eye:-

**Mysario** (10): I made a list of like 5 songs I thought would be winners if I put them in the charity rate and 3 of them got submitted, this was one of them. Someone else put it in but I wish I did! One of the best songs out there and one that actually uses auto-tune acceptably!

**ReallyCreative** (10): An absolute classic and it's not even my favorite from the album. Pop perfection.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): if this doesn’t make it to day three i will actually cry

**TiltControls** (10): Ellie who?

**vayyiqra** (10): I will die saying that "In For the Kill" is the better La Roux from their (formerly)/her (currently) first era, but this is still a classic, and one of the first pop songs I ever loved. You had better believe that 20-year-old Vayy was a very, very sad boy, and he spent all his time in his room being too depressed to go outside, and he really needed this happy, uptempo, inspirational bop. Oh boy, did he EVER need it. Thank you, Elly Jackson. <3

**wavingwolves** (10): this song reminds me of how much i miss those punk goes pop compilations. can someone bring it back?

**Chevsapher** (9): A classic! Those textures.

**timothy444** (9): Truly the most underrated song of 2009 (you heard me, don't come at me Lady Gaga stans)

**SupremeShani** (8.5): There's an Elle Goulding joke to be made somewhere, but I'm not clever enough to come up with it.

**violentovernightrush** (8.2): this is a bop but la roux is SO fucking messy idk what to tell you

**camerinian** (8): I always felt like I should love this? It's really good, clearly, but… idk, the hook doesn't quite do as much as I'd like. It's weird, it's missing something, but I don't know what it is

**slimboyfriend** (8): I know she (rightfully) dragged Ellie Goulding for making basic music,  but pls stream s/t or Trouble in Paradise because Supervision is NOT GOOD!!

**SteelStepladder** (8): One of the best one hit wonders of the last decade!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Gamer anthem

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (7.8): does someone have the video of that lady dancing in front of xxxtentacion's mausoleum

This is some icon shit right here [2], but once again I think that this was hurt by Torn being in the same rate, and directly next to this song too 💀

---

##**The people in the car in that one vine**


**1998tweety** (11): Ugh this is so damn iconic. Everything you want from a song is here. Good lyrics, good vocals, a BOP chorus, and there's even more than you never would've thought to ask for like a choir. We absolutely stan.

**gannade** (11): sometimes i listen to this and pretend to do the dance in rihannas umbrella video

**\_wailordfan** (10): my favorite car sing along song with my guy friends.

**agentofscranton** (10): when the choir comes in i nut

**anothertown** (10): I’m going to go watch Schmidt’s The Hills Opening Credits Dating Profile Video ten times in a row https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zkf5SSdfQYA

**camerinian** (10): ok the way that pre-chorus builds and builds and builds until that unbelievable multi-tracked chorus drops in might be one of the best pop moments ever, second only to when the fucking gospel chorus takes over on the bridge, which is appropriate, cos this song is heavenly

**chihuahuazero** (10): When this song was popular, I fell in love with it and wondered what the song was named. My mom then bought the album CD. She might’ve made me a pophead.

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): [GAY SCREAMING]

**DaHumanTorch** (10): FEELTHERAINONYOURSKINNOONEELSECANFEELITFORYOUONLYYOUCANLETITINNOONEELSENOONEELSE

**evilqueenlex** (10): "aNd tHatS oN COMMA beCausE the REst is still UNWRITTEN"

**ExtraEater** (10): Masterpiece

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We LOVE 00s white women

**Leixander** (10): FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN

**letsallpoo** (10): the greatest song made by a white woman ever

**ManofOranges** (10): Fuckin banger

**mudkip1** (10): what song under 3k views is this?

**ningxin17** (10): FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN

**pickupthephonebaby** (10): iconic

**realboxwood** (10): Who would I even be as a person if I hadn't listened to this on repeat when I was 7

**rickikardashian** (10): all I think of when I hear this song is [this video](https://youtu.be/ofAPLr28_6A)

**Roxieloxiw** (10): FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN BITCH

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CoSAhMlba4

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (10): a fucking **BOP!!!!!!!!!!**

**TiltControls** (10): pantene goddess

**untutorable** (10): when i was like ten years old i was obsessed with this song

**violentovernightrush** (10): it's no pocketful of sunshine BUT it is the next best thing. i miss her.

**waluigiest** (10): maybe the pinnacle of songwriting? lmk

**Mysario** (9.6): not her best song or second best or even third best but big bop nonetheless

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): a classic

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): this song is on that youtube video "songs that get white people turnt" for a reason

**SupremeShani** (9.5): Listening to this after just hearing *Torn* is singer songwriter perfection.

**wavingwolves** (9.5): this song can be annoying but at the right times it can be uplifting. i'm not above it.

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Now THAT is a good chorus!

**berober04** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0GSXxNh4AM

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I really liked this song when I was 10 and didn't think I was gay. the CLOWNERY, the absolute circus I was

**bespectacIed** (8): Selena Gomez - Me and the Rhythm can choke, this is the OG Pantene commercial bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): the year is 2005, you’re on the school bus, you’re in 5th grade and you just downloaded this song on your mp3 player, you listen to this song and tell your friend how the boy in your class with a spiked mohawk is cute

**SteelStepladder** (8): Tell me you don't scream out FEEL THE RAIN ON YOUR SKIN when this comes on


##**Celebrated Vine's shutdown**


**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I used to love this when I was in middle school but cannot listen to it now without cringing

**junobeekeeper** (7.3): I have a twin sister who will get into habits of listening to the same couple songs on repeat, and recently it was this and Hips Don't Lie, and I heard them both every single day for three solid months. I did not get sick of them.

**bandnitos** (7): a classic but also really dated

**vayyiqra** (7): I like this song, and it starts well as kind of Alanis Morrissette-ish pop, but then the chorus hits and all I think is "why does this sound like music for a women's shampoo commercial". I think "Pocketful of Sunshine" is by far the better song from this era for her, and I want to like NB more because she's a good songwriter and she's also besties with Kimbra, but this song just isn't *that* good.

**alasyorick** (5): is it bad the start of unwritten and torn sound the same to me

I absolutely LOVE Florence, so this was a really easy 11 for me. I've listened to this song [more times than is possibly healthy](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/651542303303008271/678618643306643486/Skjermbilde_2020-02-16_kl._16.07.51.png) but i just LOVE LOVE LOVE the drama and build of this song. It leaves the charity rate at a quite respectable second place, after spending much of January at the #1-spot. So long and goodbye, my sweet princess. 

---


##**That's the sound of seven 11's being wasted**

**\_wailordfan** (11): my submission, and one of my favorite songs of all time. It is on my list of tattoo ideas, and the vocals and production just makes this song transcend time itself. The moment the organ enters, I'm overwhelmed by emotion. I don't really know what else to say except that this song deserves so much love and if it isn't top 10 I'll be very sad :(

**agentofscranton** (11): don’t mean to get too real, but this song came out around the time that I was coming to the realisation that I was a gay man, and growing up in a heavily religious household, I really REALLY struggled with that realisation and what being gay would mean and how that would affect my relationships with my friends and family, and it all just gets a bit much, y’know? but I heard this song for the first time, and idk I just so heavily related to it, so much so that i fucking started bawling. and I still do everytime I listen to it. I’m still not out to my parents, and it can still get a bit too much to deal with at times, but I’m coping better now, and everytime I feel myself getting low I put this song on, and just cry and get lost in it, and for 5 minutes everything just seems to feel a little better

**chihuahuazero** (11): I wish I can say more about this song, but I think a lot of y’all will say it for me. Cathartic.

**ignitethephoenix** (11): So I was prepared to give the song I picked for the rate my 11 however someone picked this song which made it a much harder choice. But alas I will give it my 11. A flawless song and my all time favorite Florence + the Machine song. It deserves to win the rate and I think it will win unless someone extremely tasteless tries to sabotage it.

**rotating3Dtext** (11): it’s one of my favorite songs of all time

##**I'm gonna let it happen to meeee^EEEEE^EEEEEEEEE^EEEEEEE^EEEEEE**


**1998tweety** (10): Far from her best song but it's still a 10.

**bandnitos** (10): and that's on fucking WHAT! period

**bespectacIed** (10): "Here's the funny thing: In my own crazy way, I was kind of happy. For the first time in years, there was no little part of me clinging to the dream of being with Robin. Which meant, for the first time in years, the world was wide open. Because, kids when a door closes, well you know the rest." **walks into a rainy street full of yellow umbrellas**

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): THAT held belt! whew Lungs indeed

**DaHumanTorch** (10): iconic tweet https://twitter.com/SAlNTKARDASHIAN/status/732793252039036928?s=20

**moooo566** (10): a lot of 10s in a row here maybe im just easy

**realboxwood** (10): In any other rate this would have been my 11 wow

**ReallyCreative** (10): Ceremonials is Flo's best album and y'all aren't ready to come to terms with that. "It's a shot in the dark, aimed right at my throat" is an EVENT of a lyric omg

**SFbby** (10): A cathartic release of emotion

**static\_int\_husp** (10): super cathartic

**SupremeShani** (10): Coach Beiste deserved better, both from Cooter and the Glee writers.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Absolutely euphoric and anthemic in every way

**TiltControls** (10): Gorgeous song

**vayyiqra** (10): I love this song, I love Florence, it makes me happy, it is pure. I needed this right now. <3 Thank you to whoever chose it.

**violentovernightrush** (10): this is such a good song. incredible vocals from florence, beautiful imagery, beautiful everything. she did so well. the chorus is euphoria.

**wavingwolves** (10): is this actually the most uplifting song there is? because in my book it is

**kappyko** (9.5): got me through some shit !!!!!

**Chevsapher** (9.2): Holy vocals, Batman!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): etertnal goddess

**SteelStepladder** (9): The world stops when that chorus hits

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8.5): low key slaps

**Mysario** (8): not the best Florence song but it's still great

**timothy444** (8): Personally, I prefer 'Sweet Nothing' but this song is alright

**waluigiest** (8): part really beautiful and good, part almost designed for use in Glee

**camerinian** (7.5): it's not my favourite Florence song, since I like her music angrier or higher octane, but her dynamics on this track and the swell on the last verse is legendary


##**And what about it.gif**


**anothertown** (4): florence & the machine is imagine dragons for women who wear vintage dresses

We have our winner! I'm one of the lowest scores for this but my explanation is that I'm neither American or a boy. This song is not relatable at all 😤 (But really, I have no nostalgia for this, it wasn’t big here in Norway & while I can appreciate the production and Estelle, the lyrics are peak Americanism)

**alasyorick** (11): such a classic

**evilqueenlex** (11): the quintessential pop song of the 2000s and arguably the entire 21st century

**ImADudeDuh** (11): I really considered making this my 11. Edit: well, apparently i considered it enough to make it my 11 lmao.

**ManofOranges** (11): Pure bop how do you not give this an 11

**slimboyfriend** (11): Estelle's voice sounds like smiling sunshine

**SupremeShani** (11): This should be the winner of the rate, but we know how Popheads can be. There is no other song as timeless as this one, Estelle just effortlessly soars over this gorgeous disco beat, while Kanye demonstrates how an artist should integrate a rap feature into a song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): One of the best songs of the 2000’s, and easily the best singer/rapper collaboration that will likely ever happen

**1998tweety** (10): A literal classic. Contender for my 11

**bandnitos** (10): TAKE ME ON A TRIP ID LIKE TO GO SOME DAY!!!!!!!!!

**bespectacIed** (10): I C O N I C

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is the song I submitted and I did it cause it’s a major bop, has aged flawlessly and has Kanye’s best feature. Estelle sounds flawless and I think this is one of the best songs from the past 20 years. If this doesn’t make top 5, I’m judging all those who gave it a low score tbh

**Leixander** (10): classic

**moooo566** (10): kanye's best track

**ningxin17** (10): every second of this song is perfect

**ReallyCreative** (10): I want to live in the America Estelle wants to go to, Kanye is great in this song too but let's be real here, this is ESTELLE'S MOMENT

**rickikardashian** (10): out of all the forms of media that have the word "American" in them, this is still the best of all those

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): vote bernie 2020

**SFbby** (10): SF >>>>>> LA

**static\_int\_husp** (10): looking at this critically, the Estelle parts are actually fairly cheesy. But the Kanye verses really make the song. What I'm trying to say, I guess, is that if Taylor Swift wants London Boy to be a hit, she should get Stormzy on a remix.

**SteelStepladder** (10): Kanye's best guest verse don't @ me

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (10): a massive fucking bop

**TiltControls** (10): kanye might not be the american boy you want right now...

**timothy444** (10): Finally someone added a Steven Universe song to a rate!

**violentovernightrush** (10): i bought this on itunes when it came out, and it was on my 3rd gen ipod nano (the square one) in seafoam green, and it was a really nice time in my life, and it's a very nostalgic song, and i like it

**wavingwolves** (10): every song that isn't this is bad

**Mysario** (9.9): I love this Crystal Gem of a song: it's extremely catchy, Estelle has a unique voice that compliments it so well and it even has some classic Kanye in it! I can't fully embrace a 10 on this for the sole reason that the song does kinda feel just slightly too long - however, it's still probably one of the best songs in the rate, top 4 easily

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): a legend and kanye

**\_wailordfan** (9): Tik Toks are all I can think of

**anothertown** (9): bop. this song felt unlikely to stay relevant but I’ve heard it on the radio a ton over the years and a remix of it was popular on tiktok lol. Also is it just me or does the mastering sound like shit.

**camerinian** (9): my flatmates have absolutely ruined this song for me by insisting on playing it every Friday, Saturday and any other piss-up day evening, but objectively it does slap and maybe in a year I'll be back to good with it again

**DaHumanTorch** (9): a classic...i still remember most of the moves from just dance

**junobeekeeper** (9): Ah remember when Kanye was normaler? Anyway Estelle rules.

**materialqirl** (9): its american boy luv..

**Tolk1en** (9): I remember this amazing feeling when I heard this song for the first time... the nostalgia... time flies too fast

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a great song, one of the best songs of the 2000s, one of the best duets I've ever heard, one of the best hooks ... I wouldn't be surprised if this got into the top 3 or even won.

**waluigiest** (9): Estelle really delivered a flawless piece of work. The melodies and writing are bomb. Kanye’s lazy verse gets in the way of what could be an 11

**Chevsapher** (8.5): Such a fun track, and her voice is lovely.

**agentofscranton** (8): the scene in gavin & stacey where smithy does kanye’s rap is 100x funnier than anything james corden has done since getting big in the us
