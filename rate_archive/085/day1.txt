Charity Rate II: Sylvia Rivera Law Project Day 1 - You'll Cowards Don't Even Do Rates
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/f3wex9/charity_rate_ii_sylvia_rivera_law_project_day_1/

*Since /u/carliescion is busy, I will reveal today's results.*

---

HELLO and welcome to Day 1 of the second ever popheads-charity rate! Together we raised more than 1500 USD to the Sylvia Riveria Law Project, and people who donated 10 USD or more, got to pick a song in this rate! 

Today, starting at **2PM EST** I'm gonna reveal positions #60 to #41.

You can follow along in this thread or at **[Plug.dj](https://plug.dj/popheads/)**, where I'll be playing the songs as they go out!


Some #FACTS:

* **76** people did the rate! Thank y'all <3

* The average score was **7.151**, which is really high considering there's no unifying theme!

* The average controversy score is **2.082**, so anything higher than that should be considered really controversial. 

* Cascada and SOPHIE are the only two people with more than a single song in the rate!

*A refresher on the song currently still in the rate:*

This song made me want climate change to quicken. Also FYI, this was not a real entry, somebody didn't get back to us with a song choice, so me and u/TragicKingdom1 decided to enter this bc charity.

---

##**Why are you the way you are**


**Mysario** (11): ​This is one of those unintentionally genius songs. Lil Dicky obviously meant for it to be a pop hit, but examined closely it becomes so much more than that. It shows the deepest emotions of a man torn between authenticity and image. The tiny-dicked white man's struggle to be "green," to be "worldly," to be "funny" but you hear the quaver in his voice, the uneasiness of this projected face of comedy and humanitarianism — and literally everything, the money, the fans, the stardom are all telling him this false face is what matters and that comedy is only achieved through playing a role. "Earth" is a dark, unique look at the true face of a comedy rap star, something that is so often shrouded in veils of insincerity. Also when Kevin Hart said "and I'm Kanye West"... I felt that

**timothy444** (10): Sure, it lacks the quality of most of the other songs in this rate but for the most part, the lyrics and jokes are hilarious (albeit not in the way Lil Dicky might have expected). Meghan Trainor sings how much she loves India, Ariana to play a Zebra and Kevin Hart to proclaim he's Kanye in the same song. It's such a dumb idea to think about, but it's amazingly genius in its own right. I honestly wouldn't be surprised if Lil Dicky made it that bad on purpose.  So that's how I'm going to justify my score because I'm pretty sure it's gonna be one of the first five songs to be taken out.

**mms82** (8.5): not that bad tbh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): this is katy perry’s biggest hit in the last 3 years

**yourfacesucksass** (7): I mean I don't have any additional opinion on this really

**materialqirl** (5): a mid

**napsandnetflix** (5): im a fat fucking pig


##**People who try to see the best in everyone**


**alasyorick** (4.2): cute message but hasnt got much else

**Chevsapher** (4): Shallow, clunky, and sometimes jarringly crude. Lil Jon made me laugh, though.

**Tolk1en** (4): They tried to save the Earth from the upcoming disaster, but ended up accelerating our race to apocalypse. I'm giving 4 points for some Ariana vocals

**vayyiqra** (4): Hey there, demons. It's me, ya boi. Anyway, stan environmentalism, but I don't really like this song. It's so cheesy, and I get that it's a tongue-in-cheek parody of charity awareness songs by 30 pop stars, and it's impressive how many big names are on this, but it's also cringe and not very funny.  The message is still kind of based though, and also the in-depth lyrical analysis on Genius is amazing. I can't hate it too much.

**realboxwood** (2): I like the part where Lil Jon says, "WHAT THE FUCK I'M A CLAM." That's fun.

**selegend** (2): two points for ariana singing am i black or white

**slimboyfriend** (2): All of these songs competing for my zero, I guess

**untutorable** (2): one extra point for being ridiculous

##**The 1s**

**bespectacIed** (1): I joined the deserved hate train when this was released but when I relistened in this rate I hate that I'm kinda living for it???? The lyrics are so fucking intentionally garbage, it's almost camp. It deserves a 0 average and its absolutely of the most awful songs in existence but the song genuinely made me laugh, and that's something I guess

**camerinian** (1): I can't in good faith give this my 0 because I did laugh at Kevin Hart as Kanye and Lil Jon as a clam my first time hearing this, and I hate myself for it because holy fucking shit, does it not justify Lil "Chris Brown just has a controversial past" Dicky lecturing US, THE PUBLIC about fucking social responsibility in between jokes about how great heterosexual intercourse is.

**cloudbustingmp3** (1): im literally shoving petroleum up my ass as we speak because of this dumb "song"

**ExtraEater** (1): Rate winner arrived!

**ImADudeDuh** (1): No!

**kappyko** (1): fuck off

**mudkip1** (1): who wasted their nomination on this sjndvlksjdnv

**RandomHypnotica** (1): perhaps my favourite line from this trainwreck is "We forgive you Germany", purely because of the AUDACITY lil dicky has to imply that we've been waiting decades from the holocaust for someone to officially declare as a spokesperson of humanity that we forgive Modern-Day Germany of the sins of the Nazis, and he himself is the one we were waiting for

**rotating3Dtext** (1): one point for good intentions? i guess?

**SFbby** (1): I forgot what this song sounded like so i went to go hear it and I remember now why I blocked it out of my mind

**SupremeShani** (1): I debated giving this a ten just to be obnoxious, but this song doesn't even deserve that.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): I feel like this should be an easy 0 but honestly the “What the fuck I’m a clam?” line makes me laugh so I guess I have to owe up to my own immaturity and bad sense of humor and give this a point

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (1): lol

**TragicKingdom1** (1): it was my idea to put this in so nobody's personal picks would be last place :)

**violentovernightrush** (1): this will get enough 0s without mine

##**The 0s**


**1998tweety** (0): I'm just doing my part on making this the lowest rated song ever.

**\_wailordfan** (0): the fact that he got Ariana Grande to acknowledge her black or white shit in a tongue in cheek way just makes this song worse

**agentofscranton** (0): lol fuck this guy

**anothertown** (0): the cherry on top of this song is “Produced by Benny Blanco and Cashmere Cat.” No it’s the fact that they got Leonardo dicaprio in the booth. No, it’s “We forgive you Germany”

**bandnitos** (0): and im kanye west

**bbfan132** (0): someone really picked this just so it could be the lowest rated song of all time… good choice i guess

**berober04** (0): Congratulations on the worst song we've ever rated - I hope you're proud of yourself. Farrah will be so proud

**chihuahuazero** (0): When you can’t tell whether this is supposed to be a charity single or a satire of it. Sadly, neither interpretation works.

**DaHumanTorch** (0): yes its pop heads circlejerk of me but it there any other song on here thats worse? i dont think there is. he mightve forgiven germany but germany and the rest of the world will never forgive him

**hikkaru** (0): disgustang

**ignitethephoenix** (0): As host of the meme rate, I will NOT be putting this song in it because you good people do not need to rate this song twice. Your mind, soul and body (especially your ears) deserve better than your to intentionally listen to the song twice.

**junobeekeeper** (0): I can't even do it for the goof, man. At least it was for a good cause?

**Leixander** (0): maybe b.o.b. was right

**ManofOranges** (0): seriously?

**moooo566** (0): oh no

**ningxin17** (0): what the hell is going on in here on this day

**ReallyCreative** (0): this was legitimately the first (and last) time I ever heard this... track. Maybe climate change made some points.

**rickikardashian** (0): pee pee poo poo monkey have big butt haha

**skargardin** (0): This is the most confident score that i've ever given

**static\_int\_husp** (0): A BAD charity song! and most charity singles already suck!

**SteelStepladder** (0): This song is a poopy diarrhea shitting fart ass butthole

**TiltControls** (0): The 'Farrah Abraham - On My Own' of this charity rate, except somehow even worse. Good job Lil Dicky for removing the competition for my 0

**waluigiest** (0): decadence in the worst way imaginable

**wavingwolves** (0): this is the reason why we have global warming

##**Crack-smokers**

**bandnitos** (10): WHT THE UFKC IS THISHJDHJHJH

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): friendship ended with not doing drugs crack is my new best friend

**evilqueenlex** (10): imma crack-free coward but this slaps...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I mean, he did make some points.

**Leixander** (10): i was read

**realboxwood** (9): I submitted this song as a joke but upon re-listening for the rate I realized it did not sound significantly different from what I listen to unironically

**Mysario** (8.9): Popheads aren't gonna smoke crack when y'all cowards are too afraid to touch another human being

**SteelStepladder** (8): I cri evry tiem

**camerinian** (7.5): cops can’t read

**anothertown** (7): This honestly is iconic. Eeyore rapping over an Animal Crossing beat

**static\_int\_husp** (7): honestly,,, not horrible

**vayyiqra** (7): I was ready to hate this, thinking it was an edgy song with crack use as a punchline (this has become common in stan culture and do not do this; if you do this you are an asshole and I will hate you until you stop doing it) but it's the opposite, and it was meant to destigmatize drug use and was written from his own experiences, so it's based. I don't love it, but there is something haunting and unique about it.

**junobeekeeper** (6.9): I'm fascinated by this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i mean he’s not wrong

**SupremeShani** (5.5): This sounds like a JPEGMAFIA title.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): is he wrong though

**rotating3Dtext** (4): lmao what is this

**SFbby** (4): What does this title even mean

**Chevsapher** (3): Just... incredible.

**bespectacIed** (2): y'all setting hip-hop to be dragged with these whack submissions

**ningxin17** (2): Viper is a living legend, wish I could give this a 12

**violentovernightrush** (2): he got a point


##**Weed-smokers**

**ReallyCreative** (1.1): Unironically better than Earth like I at least laughed at this

**1998tweety** (1): Wtf is this....

**brenda\_official** (1): the name is funny but this literally gave me a headache to listen to all the way through

**DaHumanTorch** (1): the fact that i almost changed my 0 from earth to this...chile anyways so

**ignitethephoenix** (1): ???

**JunkyGS** (1): Still better then Earth

**kappyko** (1): i get it but

**ManofOranges** (1): he is correct, i do not smoke crack

**materialqirl** (1): what..

**RandomHypnotica** (1): whoever wanted every rate participant to have to listen to this mess by submitting it is a sad person

**rickikardashian** (1): imagine submitting this, probably hoping you'll get the lowest score, and being second last to Lil Dicky, I have to laft

**waluigiest** (1): shut the fuck up

**wavingwolves** (1): i'm dying that you'll here just means y'all. also, say no to drugs, kids.

**yourfacesucksass** (1): need anyone say anything about this??

**slimboyfriend** (0): Someone's trying hard to get the lowest recorded score for a rate huh

**timothy444** (0): Hoping that my zero is enough for this song to prevent Earth from getting last place in this rate

Popping my pussy to a leaking sink as we speak!

##**Got that drip**

**mudkip1** (10): bop of the century

**realboxwood** (10): This gave me a headache!

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): the intro always makes me have to pee but i stan

**hikkaru** (9): me having a rave by myself in the bathroom after i just showered and the faucet is dripping

**materialqirl** (9): the beginning luv i..my ears..

**waluigiest** (9): who told her this was okay. This makes me feel terrible I love it

**Chevsapher** (8.9): It's hard to rate something incomparable to any music I've ever heard before.

**anothertown** (8.5): producers sample this challenge

**junobeekeeper** (8.4): The noises are crazy but we stan!

**DaHumanTorch** (8): all these water noises really made me need to pee

**bandnitos** (7): this is only for certain moods

**brenda\_official** (7): haha diarrhea iced coffee lactose intolerant funny joke haha

**camerinian** (7): I mean, I love this, I really do, I just don't know if I'd want to listen to it very much. Play this to me again at 2am on a bender and maybe it'll be a 10

**Leixander** (6): who knew i could bop to the sound of her peeing on a pan


##**[[LEAK]](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/es0brl/lady_gaga_stupid_love/)**

**ningxin17** (6): I love Sophie but this sounds like what I imagine bugs coming out at midnight to feast on crumbs in my kitchen sounds like and it makes me a little queasy

**ReallyCreative** (6): The production is enough to turn Hugh Hefner asexual but I can't bring myself to turn it off

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): this sounds like diarrhea?

**SteelStepladder** (6): Weird pick for a sophie song when Ponyboy is RIGHT THERE. This is still fine though

**untutorable** (6): this is like......hyperpop asmr

**rotating3Dtext** (5.5): it scares me

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): If I was on acid this would be a 10, but I'm just high on life :///////

**ExtraEater** (5): I get it, it's just boring in how it does it

**pickupthephonebaby** (5): not fun to listen to!

**SupremeShani** (5): I'm scared.

**yourfacesucksass** (5): it's just not for me

**Mysario** (4): weird at points but overall v bad

**SFbby** (4): IDK whats happening and it scares me

**vayyiqra** (4): I like Sophie but this song goes nowhere and feels kind of experimental for the sake of itself, i.e. indulgent. Her older material tended to be like that, so I don't like it as much, though some of it is enjoyable. This song is just a few minutes of gurgling noises though, not much of a song.

**letsallpoo** (3): you will never be farrah abraham

**poppinmmolly** (3): this sounds like I'm peeing in the ladies' room of a night club

**violentovernightrush** (3): oh yeah, i still don't like pc music, thank god

**1998tweety** (2): Wtf is this, this ain't music. I will give it a 2 cause it's different but besides that...oof

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this sounds like sophie had horrible diarhhea but still wanted to make a song so she did what she had to

**rickikardashian** (2): the transition from immaterial to this was surprisingly good, but that's kind of the only thing I enjoyed from it

**TiltControls** (2): It's well produced, but not something I'd ever want to listen to again. Just not my thing

**Tolk1en** (2): why ??


##**Has PTSD from having a leaking sink**



**timothy444** (1.5): I didn't know weird industrial noises could be submitted in the Charity rate! Trash and giving it 1.5 is being way too generous tbh.

**TragicKingdom1** (1.5): :onika:

**agentofscranton** (1): i’m really sorry i just really really despise this kind of music i’m so sorry

**bespectacIed** (1): Gave SOPHIE my 11 and a 1 that quick lol this is noise

**ignitethephoenix** (1): if Lil Dicky’s Earth did not exist, this would easily be my zero. A bunch of random noises that sound like gobbledygook and me peeing in the toilet isn’t music I’m sorry. I know Sophie can do better.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): this is fucking autotuned water, why the fuck do people like this

**kappyko** (1): we keep on deconstructing the club to where we never think to put the club back together

**ManofOranges** (1): what

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): id rather not listen to music that sounds like wet sharts thank you very much

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (0): this literally sounds like someone taking a wet shit

This is sorta cute, but the chipmunk vocals in the chorus can get kinda grating

---


##**People who definitely have a TikTok-account**

**mms82** (11): one of the best songs ever– two random high schoolers from the other side of the world from me whose other music is either really decent or god awful but this track is pure pop perfection. the chainsmokers put it on their weekly mix once, /u/the_chainsmokers should get this guy signed he has talent

**rickikardashian** (8.5): +.5 for the chimpmunk voice

**Chevsapher** (8.1): 2018 vibes.

**Mysario** (8.1): I smoke cigs never, but I do like how short and concise this song is

**1998tweety** (8): This kinda bops but I can't promote drug use.....

**DaHumanTorch** (8): ok this was really strange but i was vibing ngl

**bespectacIed** (7): bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): is this a tik tok song

**SupremeShani** (6.5): It's fun, something for the kids to vibe to.

**kappyko** (6): ok yas


##**People who bought TiK ToK.mp3 on iTunes**


**bandnitos** (6): popcorn lung

**ReallyCreative** (5): ahhhh yes, the male verson of buh-nah-knees and auf-uh-kahdees, fantastic production on verses just to lead into a horrible, horrible chorus. So quirky and interesting!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why does this bitch sound like ed sheeren

**timothy444** (5): millennial/10

**vayyiqra** (5): This sounds like Ed Sheeran singing a Weeknd song, and it uses way too many cliches of electronic music, but I still kind of like it. If it didn't have those annoying vocal effects I might like it more.

**waluigiest** (5): the writing is not good but it’s a little bit of a jam

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this is the stuff that would be at the bottom of the spotify new music friday playlist.

**slimboyfriend** (4): ew there's a drop

**violentovernightrush** (3.2): dream pop but make it unlikeable

**ignitethephoenix** (3): this song is a combination of some of my least favourite trends in music. It’s catchy but at the same time I can’t stand it.

**SteelStepladder** (3): I really don't like these types of chopped up vocal drops

**camerinian** (1): I genuinely don't know what the appeal of this song is. The lyrics convey nothing, the singer sounds bored and the drop is annoying as fuck. Who would want to go out of their way to listen to this? It's playlist fodder at best, and only if it was 2016 would anyone put up with it

**realboxwood** (1): It's lucky for them that Earth is here because otherwise "and have sex of course" would be a shoe-in for worst two second moment in this rate

**untutorable** (1): i'm falling asleep typing this

I'm sorry, I actually really like Imagine Dragons, but this is bottom tier-Imagine Dragons.

---


##**People who WILL be doing u/Roxieloxie's rate** 


**Roxieloxie** (10): it’s always so wild to me when people say that imagine dragons makes generic music when this second album exist that’s literally jam packed with songs that’s sounded like nothing else that was on the pop radio on 2015. Anyway support the commercial rock rat next month that I’m hosting :kisskiss:

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): imagine dragons are good though

**waluigiest** (9): okay I forget that Imagine Dragon has some gnarly, chaotic, wonderful songs like this. Seriously how the hell is this imagine dragons??????

**violentovernightrush** (8.9): my toxic trait is that i like imagine dragons (and what a song by them. remember the maad city/radioactive mashup??)

**Mysario** (8.8): I like this song since it's vastly different than a majority of their songs and goes pretty hard in the paint! However, if you could only see the darkest side of me, it feels like such a manufactured anger that it doesn't truly appease the animal that I have become

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.7): okay why isnt THIS what gets big and plays on radio nonstop? this is so interesting and i was ready to just slap a 2 on it bc it's ID anyway @danreynolds spit on me

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i'm like the majority of this sub in that i don't like imagine dragons but this actually slapped. i loved the production on the chorus. i know this'll get slightly robbed tho just cause of the hate train for them.

**Chevsapher** (8.3): I forgot Imagine Dragons used to make interesting music.

**moooo566** (8): i like imagine dragons im very sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): The production is great but I think it’s kind of standard otherwise (even tho it goes off)

**Leixander** (7.5): genuinely surprised

**1998tweety** (7): So the thing with ID is that rock fans make fun of them for actually be pop but their pop-rock songs are easily their best ones so I'll gladly take them over this.

**timothy444** (7): Imagine Dragons attempt to make actual rock music: The Song


##**People who WILL be reading Pitchfork's next ID-review**

**SupremeShani** (6): It's a song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): I didn’t really need or want to hear Imagine Dragons try to be Nine Inch Nails

**materialqirl** (5): imagine dragons sweetie..lower than hozier

**ningxin17** (5): low budget Korn rip-off

**ReallyCreative** (5): well they seem like nice guys so I can't be that mad at their success but wow this is mediocre omg

**kappyko** (4): great production but the yarl is a bit much. wait this is HARD

**wavingwolves** (4): i swear i gave this a chance but after so many amazing songs on this rate has this doesn't sound that good

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): Ew it sounds like a present-day Fall Out Boy b-side

**anothertown** (3): :oo wa a a a:

**vayyiqra** (3): Friction is a very important concept in physics and I want to support woke king Dan Reynolds but this is fucking awful. It sounds like a bad nu-metal song my buds would've played for me on their Walkmans in the elementary schoolyard and I would've politely listened but not liked it. I am only rating it as high as I am because the faux-Middle Eastern melody was kind of cool, and they seem like good guys, but I don't like their music.

**alasyorick** (2.2): they have so many better songs i don't hate

**bespectacIed** (2): awful song but we love trade dan reynolds

**ImADudeDuh** (2): Ok, I love Imagine Dragons, they’ve gotten way too much shit from everyone in the past 3 years. But this song, legit might be the worst song of theirs I’ve ever heard??? It was a choice, if this were Shots, it would’ve really fought for my 11 :/

**bandnitos** (1): this isn't normal i don't like imagine dragons like i fucking hate this

**SteelStepladder** (1): I think when you make music this ugly you have to have some damn good and interesting subject matter to back it up and Imagine Dragons sound as hollow as ever on this

**camerinian** (0): holy fucking shit what????? I didn't know what I expected from an Imagine Dragons song in this rate, but I don't think it was going to be Imagine Dragons doing …. Korn? Is that what this is? With, like, some Michael Jackson bullshit vocals and this, like, is it a sitar? a badly mic'd sitar? This sounds like ass

**realboxwood** (0): I really wanted to give Imagine Dragons a chance in this rate and not just shit on them for no reason, but when I was listening to this I half thought Dan Reynolds was gonna pop out from behind a wall and tell me I was being punk'd

The vocals are way too low in the mix imo

##**Miqui Brightside-Stans**

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.5): ooooh aquatic

**bandnitos** (8): this sounds kinda like something that'd play in an H&M but like a classy H&M

**ImADudeDuh** (8): wait why am i kinda bopping

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): i feel like this is some kind of inside joke that i’m not a part of but it slaps regardless

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): it's good but there's something missing from this song.

**camerinian** (7): kinda wished it developed a bit more over the runtime, but if this came on in some guy's DJ mix I'd vibe out

**kappyko** (7): a bop. made me listen to delaporte and clap clap is a bop stream it

**Mysario** (7): I thought this was a Spotify ad for a little bit. I think there's a good song under here somewhere but as far as I know, the remix probably muddles it

**Tolk1en** (7): An interesting idea but gets boring after one minute

**vayyiqra** (7): I had a bad feeling this would be reggaeton, my least favourite genre other than country pop, and thankfully it is not. In fact I like it quite a bit, although it could probably use more in the way of lyrics. (I couldn't understand what the fuck the singer was saying but I looked them up and can sort-of read Spanish well enough to figure out the gist of them.)

**DaHumanTorch** (6.5): i actually vibed with this, it was cute

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): there’s potential here but it’s not clicking

**SupremeShani** (6.5): Google tells me Azul Marino means navy blue, so the taste jumped out either way.

**Chevsapher** (6.2): Nothing exceptional, but I suppose you can still dance to it.

##**Mr. Brightside-Stans**

**1998tweety** (6): This has some elements I like but also some I really don't.

**junobeekeeper** (5.5): The blooping noises remind me when a teacher would get a phone call in class

**Leixander** (5): i thought my phone was ringing for a second

**violentovernightrush** (5): i thought my phone was ringing despite it being on silent for the last 10 years

**ReallyCreative** (4): do y'all like not listen to normal music is this an attempt to be "interesting" like the production is as if some stoner decided to make a mixtape dedicated to his mom's ringtone

**wavingwolves** (4): the start of this sounds like my ringtone and it got me confused for a few seconds

**rickikardashian** (3): this is just a v long Motorola ringtone

**selegend** (3): what

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this song is so minimalist it's barely a song

**SFbby** (2): Sounds like a non-stop ringing phone for the first minute AND it comes back after a short intermission

**SteelStepladder** (2): I really don't understand what this song is trying to make me feel

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): I don’t know why I expected this to sound like Mr. Brightside based on the title but I’m disappointed nonetheless

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): literally not even joking this slaps

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): BOP

**ExtraEater** (9): This goes off a bit

**ReallyCreative** (9): no one could fucking handle this song at the residence hall socials y'all don't even fucking know, SO MANY ICONIC LINES, shakespeare could NEVER

**Mysario** (8.8): an ironic bop

**camerinian** (8.5): Honestly I fucking love how they throw everything at the chorus, good taste be damned.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this makes me nostalgic to back when life was better and Vine was popular

**SteelStepladder** (8): This brings me back to sophomore year of college in a big way. A constant at parties everywhere.

**violentovernightrush** (7.6): UH OH

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): would be better if someone else was rapping/singing. I feel like this is a Flo Rida song but without flo rida.

**Chevsapher** (7.1): Goofy, but oddly endearing.

**slimboyfriend** (7): I hope Fleezy and Chello are still well

**1998tweety** (6.5): A lil bop but kinda annoying

**evilqueenlex** (6.5): i will forever associate this song with miley cyrus


##**Keep woppin[X18]**

**anothertown** (6): The first 25 seconds go off like no other. After that it’s just kind of repetitive

**junobeekeeper** (6): Can't find much to say about the song but to quote the music video "someone help me i'm white"

**vayyiqra** (6): When I heard the strings at the beginning I think my brain hopefully thought this was "Cloudbusting" and was sorely disappointed. It's not the worst song, but it's not my style. Also, what does wop mean, because it's an ethnic slur against Italians and uhh what? Wait nvm this is really pure I love this at least: *The song would re-emerge to mainstream exposure on March 20, 2013, when Miley Cyrus posted a video on Facebook which featured her twerking to "Wop" while wearing a unicorn onesie. While Cyrus had previously shared her fondness for the song with J. Dash and suggested that they make a video together, these plans never came to fruition. J. Dash was initially unaware of the video's creation, but would learn of the video from his personal friends and Cyrus herself while he was sick in bed with a stomach virus. He declared the video to be the moment that twerking became a mainstream phenomenon, and jokingly suggested that he and Cyrus should get matching unicorn tattoos.* SO PURE I CAN'T :3 :3 I'm bumping this up from a 4 to a 6 just because of this anecdote. Also I found out "wop" is an acronym for "[w]ith[o]ut [p]rejudice" which is also wholesome.

**SupremeShani** (5.5): Miley should have left this where it belonged.

**bandnitos** (5): the cover art is absolutely sending me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): I forgot there were lyrics to this song other than wop

**TragicKingdom1** (5): this would go #1 if the bangerz era happened today

**untutorable** (3.5): iconic but i literally couldn't sit through it

**RandomHypnotica** (3): i haven't heard a song this boring since the 2009 billboard rate

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (3): this is much more awful than i remember

**waluigiest** (3): there were exactly six seconds of this song I knew ahead of time. Six second version is an 8

**CreepyMannequin** (2): I haven’t thought of this song in 10 years and yet I immediately recoiled at the opening notes

**timothy444** (2): Uh oh (uh oh). Yeah, this isn't good and outdated by 15 years.

**Tolk1en** (2): please end my suffering

**DaHumanTorch** (1): this was the musical equivalent of someone coming up to me and shoving scissors into my ears

Big bop!!!!!! I feel like I've both never heard this song before and also have heard it a million times

##**Fatboy Slim**


**camerinian** (10): I can't believe I'm not giving my own song my 11, but the competition is seriously that fierce. Regardless, this is a song that's been ingrained in my psyche since my childhood, basically, and coming back to it with fresh ears has only strengthened my love for it. Norman Cook (aka dance icon Fatboy Slim) took everything brilliant about the original song and amped it up on steroids, making it irresistible. The opening guitar lick is transformed from a pretty fun melody into one of the best possible bases you could have for a dance track. The chorus is almost incessantly catchy, but it's so bouncy that I don't know how you couldn't love it. Fatboy Slim is a fucking legend of fun-ass music, and this is one of his best productions ever

**ExtraEater** (10): This will probably get robbed despite being a major bop

**moooo566** (10): a certified classic 10 out of 10 banger and a half thanks popheads

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.2): oh wow a summery bop we have to stan

**CreepyMannequin** (9): oh this bops

**rickikardashian** (9): this sounds like a song that plays at the beginning of a rom-com, while showing the main characters walking on the streets, while there's like car sounds and random people talking on the phone, and they meet by bumping into each other, making their stuff drop to the floor, and as they pick them up, they look into each other and fall in love immediately

**yourfacesucksass** (8.2): it's that song you've definitely heard but didn't know the name to

**Mysario** (8.1): "ha ha wow this sounds like a Fatboy Slim song, wonder if he's inspired by him" *looks up Norman Cook* "check it out now, it's the funk soul brother"

**anothertown** (8): this is the type of Semi Charmed Life/Flagpole Sitta late 90s alt pop rock that I wil stan until I die, plus it has good politics

**evilqueenlex** (8): where the hell have I heard this before???

**junobeekeeper** (8): Loses points for the line "Everybody needs a bosom for a pillow", but it slaps.

**kappyko** (8): oh this is that good shit... lemme listening again.... who the fuck submitted this omg this is amazing

**ningxin17** (8): stan fatboy slim

**ReallyCreative** (8): It's great but it's a little repetitive

**SteelStepladder** (8): OH FUCK I TOTALLY FORGOT ABOUT THIS SONG! I used to listen to it all the time in middle school! Good on whoever submitted it

**vayyiqra** (3): What the hell is this and why is the cover Christopher Walken from the video to Fatboy Slim's "Weapon of Choice"? (Good song and good meme by the way.) Anyway I don't like this. I was tempted to skip it by the end, and I don't skip songs in rates, ever.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): Is it possible for a song to be so bland and generic it’s actually painful to listen to? This song proves that the answer to that question is a definitive yes

##**Card-carrying members of the Johnny Neff-fan club**

**Mysario** (9): never heard of this artist or song at all ever, but I really dig it

**Chevsapher** (8.8): This song is too damn catchy to languish in obscurity.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A cute lil bop

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): i liked this a lot. this chorus reminded me of a song and it's KILLING me that i can't think of it someone please help it's eating me alive

**bespectacIed** (8): bop

**ImADudeDuh** (8): for someone with 9 songs, this is kinda a bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): why are all these songs good

**SupremeShani** (8): This sounds like it was created using some algorithm developed from looking at music from Tumblr, but the end result is actually something good.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.7): there's something about the vocals that bugs me but the melody is nice enough

**kappyko** (7): johnny neff ily

**Leixander** (7): this is like a fully english bts song

**letsallpoo** (7): did johnny neff submit this?

**wavingwolves** (7): the vocals could be better but it's still a fun and very well produced song

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I can't explain to you why I don't hate this song even though everything about it should make me. The melody sounds like it's from a cheesy 2000s child star's single, the vocals are vaguely pop punk, and the instrumental is nondescript alt tumblr pop. But the song's not that bad!

**bandnitos** (6): h

**vayyiqra** (6): I thought this was boring at first, but after the 3-minute mark it grew on me, and I am going to rate it a bit higher . I feel bad because I know it will be trashed since Popheads hates men singing, but it's really not bad.

This is just noise. Like white noise. To me

##**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eHQG6-DojVw**

**junobeekeeper** (10): An anthem! This song is great. Rostam is great. Yeah.

**kappyko** (10): this is absolutely going to be bottom 10 cuz he's a bottom and his singing always sounds like he's laughing but thats the appeal wait this is so hot i love this shit fuck im going to hate you all

**waluigiest** (10): I didn’t want to give Bike Dream an 11 because I submitted it, but it is probably in my top 3 songs of all time. Rostam is a stunning songwriter, producer, orchestrater, and performer. From the very start of this track, he captures this effervescent feeling of gay youthfulness. The asymmetrical drums feel clumsy and accent his lengthy, almost panicked lines. It’s ultimately a song about not quite knowing who you are or what you want. Bike Dream is all about dualities: public and private, sex and romance, activism and assimilation. It peaks with a great bridge reminiscent of his work on Warm Blood where the orchestration mostly cuts out and he just whispers the chorus. I get chills at how good this song is. If you have 20 minutes, listen to the Song Exploder episode on it.

**bespectacIed** (9): rostam is a toptier producer i love him pls come back to VW

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Two boys, one to kiss your neck and one to kiss your FACE

**SupremeShani** (8.5): Carly and Rostam sure do love their bikes.

**Chevsapher** (8.3): It's unrelenting, but smartly written.

**1998tweety** (8): This is weird but also kind of nice

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): I can't believe this was released in 2017, sounds like late 2000s, early 10s indie pop I swore I listened to in HS

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): I want to dislike this song for some reason but my latent horniness wins out I guess

**wavingwolves** (7.5): oh wow i'm missing out in rostam solo it seems! this is good

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its fine.

##**https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhxPBrxxaqc**

**Mysario** (6.6): the talking verses are both really endearing and horribly annoying, like the one person at a party you got sucked into a conversation with but you don't care that much about who they think will be the next big artist of the decade

**violentovernightrush** (6.1): rostam call ezra back

**bandnitos** (6): i like the chorus but that's about it

**cloudbustingmp3** (6): this just feels so half baked

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): bike

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): Why is the bass so fucking loud

**camerinian** (4): why does he sound like he's singing at gunpoint

**SteelStepladder** (4): Of all things to dream of why bikes? Kind of a dull dream if you're asking me

**Leixander** (3): the vocals... hunny

**vayyiqra** (3): I love Rostam's production, but this is so ... boring. I don't really like his voice, and ironically I hate the production on this with all the distortion and filtered vocals, and it's just indie-rock song #248523. Also, this song allegedly features Kelly Zutrau, the singer of the band Wet which I like, and ... where is she? Maybe there is the skeleton of a good song in here, but as it stands this song blows, I can't believe it's by the same guy who wrote "Warm Blood".

**DaHumanTorch** (2): this gave me a migraine

Is my 10 ironic? I actually dont know myself

##**Holy Writeup, Batman**


**timothy444** (11): Sweet But Psycho is a song that has a high emotional level of maturity hidden in the lyrics. It sparks you immediately from its introduction, as it begins with an ominous but threatening scream before the instrumental even begins. And then the beat kicks in and we soon realise that it's all in her head. Ava Max has said in an interview that the song is about a woman who thinks she's crazy because of the control she wants over the relationship. In reality, she's showing power as an independent woman. The song is made even more powerful by the way Ava is describing this woman, and not herself because she always puts others first. But enough about the lyrics, let's talk about the production. Cirkut does an incredible job on this single, but that doesn't mean he steals the spotlight from Ava's show-stopping vocals. The careful articulation of the beat, synths and even the composition of the harmonic vocal chopping near the bridge represents the most pop perfection masterpiece of this decade. It's genuinely no surprise at all once you've learned that it hit #1 in 22 countries. We didn't deserve Ava Max when the world of pop music was so depressing but she gave us her talent in the form of a 3 minute and 7-second song.


##**Maxipads**

**1998tweety** (10): Pop perfection, release the album though sis.

**ManofOranges** (10): I have no shame this song is great

**moooo566** (10): slaps i love ava

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (10): do you ever feel like a misfit

**wavingwolves** (10): this is intended to be fun and it manages to be fun, so it's an easy 10 in my book.

**Mysario** (9.9): do people not like her? do people actually not like this song? ??? I know very little about her life or what she's done but I think this song is absolutely fantastic and is one of my faves of the rate idk

**DaHumanTorch** (9): i've never gotten the hate this song has gotten (or how ava often gets shitted on in general in this sub). it's a cute bop that's a great throwback to early 2010s katy perry sounding music and i love it idc idc

**hikkaru** (9): overhated

**materialqirl** (9): bop but overplayed

**Chevsapher** (8.8): You know all those girls trying to be Harley Quinn five years ago? I think this is who they wanted to be. It makes for annoying lyrics, but it's hard to disagree that this song has polished production and an incredible chorus. Definitely a guilty pressure.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Ava kind of peaked with this song, not gonna lie.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): I really liked it at first, now it's like okay I guess

**bandnitos** (8): i am kind of sick of this song but i can't deny that it goes the fuck off also i love the bridge

**bespectacIed** (8): Red Velvet putsold but I know you fucking lying if you say this isn't a massive bop

**evilqueenlex** (8): popheads was so thirsty for dance pop in 2018 that ava max had some of y'all convinced she was the second coming of godga

**rickikardashian** (8): Ava has made sure to make very clear that this isn't just a song about a girl that's like kinda crazy, but is instead about _a strong, fierce woman, that confuses men with her intelligence and confidence, and because of this they call them psycho, but she's actually like, so sweet,_ and I just don't see it. I don't know if there was like controversy about the lyrics, but they're just fine, I don't know if anyone wanted the song to be a feminist anthem, not even Ava,because the explanation seems like it was made way after the song was over and someone was like "this needs to have a message, we need to *Empower The People ^TM* ". Just embrace the fact that you're singing about a crazy bitch and no one will be mad

**skargardin** (8): The SBP hate train needs to be STOPPED

**waluigiest** (8): GRAB A COP GUN KINDA CRAZY :-)

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): stream Torn instead

**anothertown** (7.5): o7 ms. max it's been an honor

**agentofscranton** (7): it feels like it was made in like a basics of pop music 101 course, but it got a really high grade

**chihuahuazero** (7): She may be far from being a main pop girl, but I see in this song Ava’s potential.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): percht to see the controversy score on this one

**mms82** (7): eh its no gaga

**ningxin17** (7): cute bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i don’t mind hearing this song like i wouldn’t be mad if it was a summer smash


##**Post Malone is the new main pop girl**


**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): why this sub chose to hype ava as the next main pop girlie is beyond me

**SupremeShani** (6.5): Pophead users will trash this and call it basic, and then end up having a Taylor Swift flair.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): i feel like todd explained my feelings towards this song pretty well in his worst of 2019 list https://youtu.be/x5HSLDqtwAo?t=702

**Leixander** (5): oh no no no no oh no

**junobeekeeper** (4): Ava Max seems like a perfectly nice girl, but nothing she has put out has really made me think "oh she's good", including this. Also I heard this one at work a lot and I think that's really impacting my rating. Sorry :-(.

**realboxwood** (4): This song should have stayed in 2012

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): It sounds like someone tried to make a movie about Lady Gaga's early career, but set in 2010s, and they couldn't get the rights to her music so they had to change the name of the main character and quickly slap together some generic sexless pop music to use instead

**static\_int\_husp** (3.5): It feels like an okay pop song but I absolutely cannot get over the lyrics. It comes off as endorsing toxic part of relationships and her voice sounds like K-mart brand shakira. At least the second has gotten slightly better with time.

**\_wailordfan** (3): I'm sorry but this r

**camerinian** (3): hahhahahahhahaa people actually thought she was the next Lady Gaga hahahhahahahahhaa

**SteelStepladder** (3): Out of all the Tumblr-alt-pop girls that we've gotten over the past decade Ava Max is the one with the least amount of star power... and that says a lot considering that Daya was a thing

**kappyko** (2): this is whatever on any given day. today i have no time for it.

**vayyiqra** (2): I don't hate Ava Max, but I hate this song, and everything about it from the shriek that opens it, the edgy concept, the repetitive hook, the ugly video ... it has hints of a good song in it, but this song makes me so uncomfortable to listen to it, and Popheads shilling it hard in the summer of 2018 just made me dislike it more. I work in mental healthcare so the "haha I'm/she's so cRaZy" trope does not sit well with me : /

**JunkyGS** (1): Met her at the VMAs and she a complete bitch to everybody there, so my tolerance for this basic throwaway bop is low.

**cloudbustingmp3** (0): oh she's sweet but a psych0

**mudkip1** (0): i bet she has really clogged pores

**violentovernightrush** (0): we really need to start examining persistent ableism in our culture more (and stop glorifying abuse???)

##**Somebody is about to be upset**

**SendMeYourSATScores** (11): i’m gonna be pretty upset if this doesn’t win


##**https://i.imgur.com/dF9NnS5.gif**

**DaHumanTorch** (10): one of katy's best songs in years, i still can't believe how it got paid absolute dust

**hikkaru** (10): a bop idc, in 2019 katy released three slappers and also small talk

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is too good for it's own good and Katy's own good

**materialqirl** (10): katys best song this era imo

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): this song not doing well on the charts is proof that america is in decline

**Mysario** (9.1): Katy's return to music in 2019 has been much better than what most of Witness had to offer and this is no exception. This is the 2nd time listening to it but I would probably rate it higher on re-listens but I got 50 more of these to sit through

**1998tweety** (9): A bop, this should've charted at the very least

**ignitethephoenix** (9): This song gets too much hate. I’m sorry if you find Katy perry has corny lines but she’s just having a good time while you are just hating because she isn’t replicating everything from teenage dream.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): corny as it is i love how low-key it is

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The verses are a bit clunky, but everything else about this song is Katy at her best.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.4): It's growing on me please don't hate

**realboxwood** (8): Several of these points are for that jumpsuit she wears on the single cover

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Guilty Pleasure? I’ve seen a lot of people say this song is trash and even though I understand their points and even partially agree with them I can’t help but like this song

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): the pre-chorus is great, but the hook isn't too great otherwise and I just don't think it makes use of Katy well enough?

**violentovernightrush** (7.7): this is kind of nothing, but that's what katy needed to do

**letsallpoo** (7): people did too much on this

**waluigiest** (7): not as good as Never Really Over but still a fine single

**SupremeShani** (6.5): Tears fall down my face when she revealed she hula hula so good, that he took her to the jeweler, jeweler.

**untutorable** (6.5): weird lyrics i'll be honest what the fuck does salty hair mean tabby told me it means wet with ocean water but it makes me think she tasted his hair and there are no heart shaped highways that i'm aware of....that being said it's overhated

##**https://i.imgflip.com/1r8vgu.jpg**

**anothertown** (6): This pop is not purposeful

**moooo566** (6): not her best work

**junobeekeeper** (5.7): I don't even remember this song ever coming out?

**cloudbustingmp3** (5): never really over outsold

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (5): never really over was right there?????

**bandnitos** (4): girl

**skargardin** (4): Maybe if Katy relased this after NRO it could have had some charting impact. That being said however, it's just a weak ass song with weak monotone delivery. If only the whole song had the energy of the final chorus...

**slimboyfriend** (4): Why pick the only bad song she released last year

**kappyko** (3): :( this is boring but it's definitely not her worst

**SteelStepladder** (3): Never Really Over reminded everyone why Katy Perry is one of the defining artists of the last decade, and Harleys In Hawaii reminded everyone of why she wont be in this one

**timothy444** (3): It really is the worst of the three songs she put out last year and she's making everyone realise that she should've just stayed a one-album-wonder.

**camerinian** (2.5): this is no different to the indistinguishable tuneless shit that made up 80% of Witness, just with a more annoying hook somehow. Shame, Never Really Over was good, but I'm thinking it was just a fluke now cos she's back on the same boring tat now. Rip katy

**vayyiqra** (2): I feel bad for Katy and bad about tanking this song's score but it's just so cheesy and bad. : ( I can tell she tried, and the instrumental is actually really nice, but the lyrics just have no heart in them when she sings them. If it were rewritten, but the lyrics are so cringe, I have to do this, like a dad in an old movie taking the family dog out to the backyard and shooting it because it's dying. I am putting Katy out of her misery.

**\_wailordfan** (1): I'm sorry but Katy good sis, I'm sorry that you'd ever think this was the next move for your career.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Remember when this leaked like a month early and the gays kept acting like this was the greatest song of all time and then it was released and THIS was the song????? Gurl don’t trust ATRLers….

**mms82** (0): every other song she's released post witness is so good, this is painful to listen to

This is. Horrible. In so many ways. I have no nostalgia for this song and her voice is possibly the most annoying thing in the world.

**moooo566** (11): all those other songs wish they were this good

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): kreayshawn ran so iggy could waddle

**ExtraEater** (10): The Barbie/Arby's lyric is a masterstroke of lyricism

**gannade** (10): the absolute peak of trashy white girl rap... kesha wishes she had a modicum of talent that kreayshawn has

**Leixander** (10): made arby's relevant

**letsallpoo** (10): she had nicki shaking

**ManofOranges** (10): When this first came on I was actually kind of disgusted and then I quickly realized... it's kind of a hit

**mms82** (10): still know every word

**DaHumanTorch** (9): i know this is gonna get dragged but it slaps idc idc, ya'll are tasteless

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i wish i could say this is better than every iggy azalea song but Work exists

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a bizarre song and I kind of love it. I don't know why, but I love when white hipsterish women do that sing-talk-rap thing which is not quite any of those things, and it's painfully early 2010s, and I fully understand how problematic it is, but I think I have a crush on Kreayshawn now and oh god oh fuck I hate that I love this song. It's brilliant, do not fucking dare @ me about it.

**Chevsapher** (8.1): This song is a fun, catchy mess.

**hikkaru** (8): BITCH YOU AIN'T NO BARBIE I SEE YOU WORK AT ARBY'S, NUMBER 2 SUPERSIZE HURRY UP I'M STARVING

**junobeekeeper** (8): Feels like something from a post 100 gecs world, and not a pre 100 gecs world.

**slimboyfriend** (8): Even though her vocals are mixed atrociously, she still makes it SLAP

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): I never thought I would ever describe something as trashy in a positive way but this is certainly trashy in a good way

**waluigiest** (8): I loved this song and I want to leave it in 8th grade. However I must admit there are some bars........ bitch you ain’t a Barbie I see you work at Arby’s

**camerinian** (7.5): ok I haven't listened to or thought about this song for years, did…. Did it always go this hard?

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): is this girl racist or controversial is that why she's on here I'm legitimately asking, it's not a bad song tbh

**yourfacesucksass** (7.2): does she now work at arby's too?

**bandnitos** (7): it's no go hard la la la but it's alright

**ningxin17** (7): Gucci Gucci paved the way foray these SoundCloud rappers

**SteelStepladder** (7): Ahead of its time and lowkey slaps

**violentovernightrush** (6.3): who introduced you to gucci gucci? for me, it was my camp counselor (it has been given an objective ranking, rather than a nostalgia ranking, which would be an 11)


##**Harry Styles-stans**

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): Kreayshawn walked so every other female rapper could run

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): this is almost good though lol

**timothy444** (4): rap music more like crap music

**SupremeShani** (3.5): Kreayshawn may be the twin to Azealia's abandoned albino child she wrapped in a malanga leaf, but this is fun to listen to sometimes.

**anothertown** (3): The least she could do was get a good beat. She couldn’t even do that.

**Roxieloxiw** (3): do y’all know how mad I was when I made a breakup playlist for my friend and I put broken-hearted by karmin on there just for her to tell me she’s some white rapper now

Stan Genesis. Invisible Touch > this 

---

##**Grandpas**

**TiltControls** (11): This was my submission, and easy 11 from me (well, except that it almost went to trans ally and rap superstar Donkey Kong). It's one of my favourite songs of all time. The song gives off the feeling that life and the world around are changing, but unlike other songs with this theme, it doesn't feel entirely negative here - more cautiously optimistic. Sometimes it's nice to have that element of positivity when life gets pretty hectic in case things still work out in the end.

**ExtraEater** (10): This will definitely get robbed despite being a major bop

**junobeekeeper** (10): Peter Gabriel is one of my all time favorite artists, so this song has such a special place in my heart. I also listened to it a lot during a time in life that absolutely sucked and I just felt like one day I was going to get out of it, and things would get better any time I heard it. It just means a lot to me, also Peter Gabriel >>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>> Phil Collins

**moooo566** (10): hi dad

**SteelStepladder** (10): Peter Gabriel > Phil Collins

**wavingwolves** (10): a classic. this is so marvelous, it takes my breath away everytime i listen to it.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this isn’t as good as I wanted it to be :yoshi:

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): I don't know why this is here but I've always loved this.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): Not my cup of tea, but master-class songwriting for sure.

**agentofscranton** (8): slay me acoustic king

**Mysario** (8): dadcore classic

**violentovernightrush** (8): your fave is problematic: me: loves this but doesn't like criminal

**camerinian** (7.5): I like the fact that is probably the first and last song we'll rate in 7/4 time. It's cute, and that main melody is very, very sticky

**ReallyCreative** (7.4): We do stan a 7/4 time signature, it's a good song but I'm not in love with it

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): don't give up outsold

**SupremeShani** (7): I am shook someone submitted this to a Popheads rate, too bad it probably won't last too long.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): trailer music

**vayyiqra** (7): I know this song is going down because it's old and by a man, but I want it to do well because I like Peter Gabriel; he is a great songwriter and one of my favourite men singers, and I really love his third album. This isn't one of my favourite songs by him though, although I like that he wrote a pop song in 7/4 and made it work.


##**Toddlers**

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): it’s just too bland

**1998tweety** (6): Not a fan of his voice, sorry

**chihuahuazero** (6): :5

This is . So. Fucking. Gay.

##**Members of r/popheadscirclejerk**

**ExtraEater** (10): Sample-based genres are the future of music

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is better production than every SOPHIE song

**Mysario** (10): phenomenally weird combo that works too well. Neil has been doing these mash-ups for a long time so he knows his stuff. Heck, he's been doing weird projects like this for even longer (y'all better know Potter Puppet Pals and "The Ultimate Showdown of Ultimate Destiny"). I respect his art. But the fact that Neil pulls a lot of these stems from Rock Band and Guitar Hero (that's right, "Y.M.C.A." was playable on Band Hero, where you can get Taylor Swift, Adam Levine, and No Doubt to do the YMCA) makes me adore him so much more. Also that "All Star" whistle is a great touch

**realboxwood** (10): omg Neil Cicierega showing these other girlies how it's done

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is the song that plays as you ascent into The Gay Heaven (tm)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): I want this to play at my funeral

**timothy444** (10): I have a soft spot for mashups and Neil's album is exactly why the genre isn't dead. We're probably never going to review Mouth Moods in full so giving T.I.M.E. a 10 feels appropriate.

**untutorable** (10): absolutely genius

**Chevsapher** (9.9): I never thought "YMCA" would make me cry, but here we are.

**camerinian** (9.5): what I wouldn't give to just spend an hour watching Neil's brain work

**junobeekeeper** (9.5): King of the Internet Neil Cicierega really captured the gay struggle, and for that we stan.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): this is unsettling in the best way like how did he even think of this combination

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (9): fallen gays we salute you

**anothertown** (8.5): I love this movie trailer

**evilqueenlex** (8.5): YMCA but make it a motivational ballad

**ningxin17** (8.2): less fun than the other songs on this album but oddly compelling

**bandnitos** (8): HWAT THE FUCJDJHSJDSH

**materialqirl** (8): heart attack at the beginning much-

**rotating3Dtext** (8): while not my favorite from the album (that’d be Smooth), it is Good.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): swinging my arms in the air while sobbing

**SFbby** (8): YMCA but with all the fun sucked out of it in exchange for a grand orchestra

**slimboyfriend** (8): Existential dread on a dancefloor

**SteelStepladder** (8): I play this when I get the aux at work sometimes

**violentovernightrush** (8): young man,

**chihuahuazero** (7.5): Mixing is rough, but boy this is one way to do a mash up.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I was definitely not expecting YMCA’s vocal part over Time from Inception. It sounds pretty good though.

**1998tweety** (7): This is weird, I don't know how to feel about this.

**DaHumanTorch** (7): im dying at how this made the rate but it went off

**ReallyCreative** (7): this sub has me just listening to like, literally anything y'all find I guess. this is fine, but like, let's find hobbies alright

**wavingwolves** (7): this scared the shit out of me but i like the dramatic atmosphere of it

**agentofscranton** (6): piss, shit, and the ultimate showdown of ultimate destiny are the peak neil cicierega tracks


##**Members of r/hiphopheads**


**bbfan132** (6): i’m not straight enough to like this…. either that or i take myself too seriously oop

**SupremeShani** (5.5): The Village People did not deserve this twink disrespecting them like this.

**berober04** (5): For as much as I *adore* Neil Cic and Mouth Moods, this is actually one of the weaker ones on the album for me. A fairly slow building song that uses its created atmosphere well, but I just don't know - it's not my bag.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): he has much more creative songs

**yourfacesucksass** (5): who?

**kappyko** (4): reframing ymca as a sincere lgbt anthem is great and clever

**rickikardashian** (4): yeah this just makes me uneasy

**Tolk1en** (4): My grandfather told me once (trying to transltae from french) that "mixing water and wine is making a bad thing from two good things"

**TiltControls** (3.5): Sounds like it could be used in the trailer for a dark and edgy retelling of the Village People

**hikkaru** (3): this makes me uncomfy

**waluigiest** (3): sis I didn’t wanna open youchube for this

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this is like someone took all the fun out of YMCA

**vayyiqra** (2): Ugh, everything about this, from the picture in the background to the ~ironic sample of "Y.M.C.A" over the dark synth strings that sound like a movie score, screams "hipster crap" and I kind of hate it. In fact the synth is the only thing I like about this. It could've been made into a great dramatic piece and maybe even used the sample to great effect if it wasn't so in-your-face, but it's just obnoxious.

**\_wailordfan** (10): there's like... 3 Jon Bellion stans on this sub, and I just got The Human Condition on vinyl so I've been bumping this track a LOT this week.

**agentofscranton** (10): where is my the human condition rate

**DaHumanTorch** (10): i love jon bellion so much, one of my favorite male singers for sure. i was so happy to see this bop in the rate. stream the human condition !

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yas this was my song. It’s not my favorite Jon Bellion song, but its my favorite that he has a music video for on my favorite album of his, so I just did it so we wouldn’t be entirely bored in the plug.

**mms82** (10): such a bop

**violentovernightrush** (10): this is jon bellion's best song

**Chevsapher** (9.2): It still holds up!

**Tolk1en** (9): The chorus is so good, the sounds are very interesting, the mor eI listen to it the more I love it

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.3): okay ms. wordplay i see you

**1998tweety** (8): This slaps but its also kind of weird at points

**bespectacIed** (8): bop

**camerinian** (8): E

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this song would be better if there wasn’t random “eeks” in the song.

**SendMeYourSATScores** (8): jon is like one of the 5 acts i’ve seen live

**vayyiqra** (8): I was sure I would hate this based on the guitar in the intro, and the political left's incessant jokes about guillotining the rich which are really unfunny and cringe. I ended up liking it a lot though. It's unique, and dramatic, and I love synth, and also every time that vocal sample comes in I think it's saying "yeet" which is one of my favourite words. This is a weird song but it's Art, you know?

**Mysario** (7.9): I'd do a Jon Bellion artist rate

**bandnitos** (7): i like this song but it reminds me of my jon bellion phase so that cuts off a couple points

**SupremeShani** (7): Maybe I should get into Jon Bellion at some point.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): This reminds me of video game music but I can’t place my finger on which game precisely

**chihuahuazero** (6): Jon Bellion is a fascinating musician. He might be a cornball, but he's a skilled cornball, and that's endearning.

**kappyko** (6): my sister used to fucking love jon bellion so so so much. this is nostalgic. corny but whats good pop without some corny shit

**Leixander** (6): yee

**anothertown** (3): Death Grips outsold

**ReallyCreative** (2.5): men exhaust me jesus christ like I'm physically and emotionally and mentally exhausted like this is just too much, Jon Bellion is hot though so he avoids a 0

**slimboyfriend** (2): I don't like this. The instrumental is distracting, none of the song's sections go together, and the lyrics make no sense if u think about them for more than two seconds

This just sounds. Very old. To me. In a really 'aged'-way.

---

## **Boomers**

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): omg my favorite thing about these playlist-like rates is finding a new gem i never would've paid attention to otherwise. this is summery perfection!

**ExtraEater** (10): Hey it's the girl from Fairytale of New York

**junobeekeeper** (10): Oh hey, this is the song I submitted (I don't think it's fair to give my own submission an 11, but that's just me)! Anyway, I'm struggling to come up with my own comment on this but uhhh Kirsty MacColl had a pretty awesome music career. Her music is really great eclectic stuff, with good things on all albums. This song is great. Even though my expectations for this song's placement are low (how can you win in a rate with the DK Rap?), I'm glad that I had an excuse to show off a song I really love while donating to an awesome cause <3 Trans rights!

**Leixander** (10): cute wholesome bop

**moooo566** (10): justice for kirsty

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): So catchy and upbeat I love it! Also the lyrics are relatable for someone like me who gets homesick so often

**wavingwolves** (10): i feel like i needed to listen to this song today so thanks to whoever submitted this because this is gorgeous

**camerinian** (9.5): Holy fuck the Fairytale of New York icon is a new wave icon too???????? And now I feel like that's an insult to call her that??????? It's my fault for not knowing how hard this goes???????

**slimboyfriend** (9): This song is a nearly perfect obscure 80s song, thank you to whoever requested this

**materialqirl** (8.9): omg HOW did i not know about her until this rate-

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): wow idk who you are kirsty but i like you

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I think we're **all** on the beach.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): idk what this is, but it was kinda nice?

**Chevsapher** (8): This track is too long, and the vocal mastering is questionable. On the other hand, it has solid bones and some great instrumental moments.

**kappyko** (8): i wanna be a friend of all the ppl that submitted the songs from the 20th century that arent the huge ones

**1998tweety** (7.5): It's kind of cute

**ReallyCreative** (7.3): it's cute but it's not really my thing

**SteelStepladder** (7): I only really know Kirsty MacColl from Fairytale of New York which is my favorite Christmas song of all time (and some of the melodies are actually pretty similar) but this bops!

**vayyiqra** (7): All right, some new wave! I was not expecting that at all, especially a new wave artist I've never heard of.  The lyrics aren't great, but it's produced by Steve Lillywhite, who can do no wrong, so it turns out well.

**Mysario** (6.9): it's good but I liked it better when The Primitives made it half as long and called it "Crash"

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): very background music to me

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this came out in 1995 yet there’s such a mid 80’s feel to it.


##**Gen Z**

**bandnitos** (5): it's ... ok? maybe? idk

**hikkaru** (5): this shit so long

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (5): she sounds tired

**DaHumanTorch** (4): sorry i just didnt like this, it isnt my kind of music

**timothy444** (4): Boomer music amirite

**SendMeYourSATScores** (2): this was way too long

**violentovernightrush** (2): not my kind of music

Angèle was once pitched to me as «french Lana Del Rey» but I don’t really see it.

---

##**F-Pop Stans**

**moooo566** (10): nothing like not understanding the lyrics to keep me on side

**berober04** (9): Fun story, I spent Christmas with my fiancee in France this year - and I couldn't escape Angele, so it was a lovely twist of fate to see her in this rate! Lovely song - though personally it was Oui or Non which grabbed my attention.

**cloudbustingmp3** (9): chill bop! lovely vocal tone!

**Tolk1en** (9): Angèle is very talente, she eserves her immense success in french-speaking countries, stream BROL

**materialqirl** (8.7): crepe?

**Mysario** (8.1): one of the better songs in the rate and I understood almost none of it

**violentovernightrush** (8.1): ooh, this is dreamy (and sounds like cœur de pirate if she had a less painful sounding voice, which is a plus)

**1998tweety** (8): French Rosalia Eilish snapped!

**bandnitos** (8): i don't know what the fuck she's saying but girl i am living

**junobeekeeper** (8): I have taken French for 7+ years, and yet I literally can not comprehend the lyrics because but je l'aime never the less.

**mms82** (8): french queen it vibes

**ReallyCreative** (8): can't understand a word but I really like this song

**rickikardashian** (8): I went to the genius page of this song, and it's in French, but I think it says this is about a lesbian, so I guess we're not only saying Trans Rights, we also say Gay Rights

**untutorable** (8): let's go lesbians let's go

**vayyiqra** (8): Shoutout to Thomas, our one Angele stan on the Popheads Discord server who has great taste, and this song proves it because it's great. What's French for "lo-fi chill beats to study and/or relax to"?

**waluigiest** (8): what if we kissed but we were deux reines?

**wavingwolves** (8): oui oui

**SupremeShani** (7.5): I don't know if there is like a meme behind this or it's just genuinely someone's favorite song, but she has a beautiful voice.

**Leixander** (7): je serai le roi ... je serai la reine! je serai le farceur ... DU CRIME! DÚNDÚNDÚN

**chihuahuazero** (6): I appreciate this opportunity to practice my French.

**SteelStepladder** (6): This is interesting... Don't think I'll ever listen to it ever again though

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): very chill and gentle

**kappyko** (4): cute!!!


##**Refuses to watch Parasite because of the subtitles**


**Chevsapher** (7.6): It sounds like a lyrically-driven song, but I don't speak French, so the full effect is probably lost on me.

**bbfan132** (6.5): sorry but i don’t remember anything about this and i’ve heard it several times

**ImADudeDuh** (7): non english songs have a harder hill to climb, sorry bout it.

**timothy444** (6): Weird single cover and I can't understand what she's saying lol

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): i don't speak italian so I don't know what they said and i'm too lazy to google, but it sounded fine. Nothing special though.

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this sounds like those french eurovision entries that are liked by France and only France

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): when does the song start

**camerinian** (3): look this reminds me of all the really dull low key pop my music school friends made in their first year that they all grew out of, but in French.


##**You take that back right now!!!**

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): French Halsey

####**SFbby** (5): RIP the monkey that got YEETED off the stage


##**Furries**


**1998tweety** (10): A classic

**bandnitos** (10): this was a contender for my 11

**berober04** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKDlqdsw1i8 / https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v9IKa0zL0NU

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): queen of rap wbk

**ImADudeDuh** (10): PERIODT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**letsallpoo** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gLwdbC-YDgo

**moooo566** (10): nice meme

**SteelStepladder** (10): I was very, very close to giving this my eleven but it felt cheap because it's the song that I submitted for the rate

**SupremeShani** (10): Just like Popheads was created because of Carly Rae Jepsen's critically acclaimed album *Emotion*, HipHopHeads was created when the DK Crew dropped the chart breaking hit *DK Rap*.

**TiltControls** (10): DK also says trans rights!

**timothy444** (10): Donkey Kong is a better rapper than Post Malone

**untutorable** (10): WALNUTS PEANUTS PINEAPPLE SMELLS GRAPES MELONS ORANGES AND COCONUT SHELLS

**Mysario** (9.6): this doesn't stand the test of time and sounds extremely outdated. But shout out Grant Kirkhope and my Funkey Kong Appreciators, y'all have style AND grace!

**junobeekeeper** (9.3): TBH... this song is practically just a Beastie Boys song, which is a good thing.

**\_wailordfan** (9): iconique

**ReallyCreative** (9): the Melee remix is infinitely better but we do have to put respect on the original

**rotating3Dtext** (9): i love donkey

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKDlqdsw1i8 superior version

**waluigiest** (9): wig. Loved when this would play in Melee I was obsessed when I was like seven. When they say walnuts peanuts pineapple smells I lose my DAMN mind

**Chevsapher** (8.5): The DK Rap transcends ratings.

**anothertown** (8): Bars!

**agentofscranton** (7.5): chunky, tiny, and lanky disappearing off the face off the earth after one release - latavia teas

**camerinian** (7.5): SiivaGunner absolutely ruined this song for me and now it sounds weird that not every single line is about how the coconut gun can fire in spurts

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): i’m so confused on how whoever made this 13 years ago literally nailed today’s meme culture

**slimboyfriend** (7): melee flashbacks

**violentovernightrush** (7): dk has the best board in mario party ds

**rickikardashian** (6): Man, they truly dragged that 3rd monkey thru the dirt


##**u/TragicKingdom1 and his many alts**


**ningxin17** (5): much worse than I remember, terrible production for a Nintendo song. When are we doing a video game music rate? They dragged my boy lanky and they absolutely didn’t have to do him like that

**vayyiqra** (5): DK64 is a great game and this song and its silly polygonal graphics was, in hindsight, perhaps my first introduction to the art of shitposting. It's such a dumb song and a little cringe, but I remember it fondly.

**wavingwolves** (5): not a gaymer so i don't get it sorry

**Tolk1en** (4): I'm sorry I know it's a meme song but it's just bad....

**kappyko** (3): wasnt the whole meme abt how this song is corny

**static\_int\_husp** (3): I know it's a meme but, I just cn't give this song a good score in good faith
