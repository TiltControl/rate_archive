Charity Rate II: Sylvia Rivera Law Project Day 2 - Only Rates Can Hurt Like This
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/f4epes/charity_rate_ii_sylvia_rivera_law_project_day_2/

HELLO and welcome to Day 2 of the second ever popheads-charity rate! Together we raised more than 1500 USD to the Sylvia Riveria Law Project, and people who donated 10 USD or more, got to pick a song in this rate! 

Today, starting at **4PM EST** I'm gonna reveal positions #40 to #21.

You can follow along in this thread or at **[Plug.dj](https://plug.dj/popheads/)**, where I'll be playing the songs as they go out!


Some #FACTS:

* **76** people did the rate! Thank y'all <3

* The average score was **7.151**, which is really high considering there's no unifying theme!

* The average controversy score is **2.082**, so anything higher than that should be considered really controversial. 

* Cascada is the only person left with more than a single song in the rate!

This is just Everytime We Touch, but not as good. Sorry, Ed!

---

##**Comments that DO mention Everytime We Touch**


**untutorable** (10): IT'S AN EVERYTIME WE TOUCH ENCORE

**wavingwolves** (10): i have to give it a 10 because this and everytime we touch are basically the same thing and i gave that one a 10

**ExtraEater** (9): I checked and nearly every song on this album sounds like a re-hash of Everytime We Touch

**Chevsapher** (8.5): It's “Everytime We Touch” with slightly more adventurous production...

**selegend** (8): who submitted everytime we touch part 2 LMAOOO

**SFbby** (8): Is this the same instrumental as Everytime We Touch for the chorus???

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): bops but it’s not every time we touch

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): Overshadowed by Everytime We Touch, and dated, but god damn does it put up a fight

**anothertown** (7): everytime we touch 2: the squeakquel

**camerinian** (7): On the one hand, this is very blatantly just Everytime We Touch again. On the other hand, it's Everytime We Touch again.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7): everytime we touch outsold

**realboxwood** (7): what if Everytime We Touch... was worse

**skargardin** (7): Some of the passages of this song are nearly identical to Everytime We Touch and the rest is just solid seven material.

**Tolk1en** (7): quite good but nothing compared to EWT

**waluigiest** (7): this is just the same as Everytime We Touch!!!!!

**SupremeShani** (6.5): I applaud the taste of the Popheads users who submitted multiple Cascada songs, but I don't like this one as much as Everytime We Touch.

**agentofscranton** (6): both this and everytime we touch kinda aged terribly but at least for me everytime is boosted by so much nostalgia, but this doesn’t

**bandnitos** (6): honey you'll never be everytime we touch also why is this literally the same exact song

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): everytime we touch but not good

**rickikardashian** (4): this song feels like I'm edging, because I spent the entirety of it waiting for the "cuz everytime we touch, I get this feeling..." part to come, and then I realized this was just a different song that it's pretty much identical to Everytime We Touch, but not as good

**SteelStepladder** (4): How is this basically the exact same song as Everytime We Touch but a billion times worse?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): cascada were really that out of ideas that they reused the everytime we touch beat for the chorus we do NOT stan


**RandomHypnotica** (2): this feels like a generic song from Dance Dance Revolution



##**Comments that DON'T, but are still about Cascada's songs sounding the same**


**ImADudeDuh** (9): even though this is literally just alphabetical order, why does the placement of this song feel shady af

**violentovernightrush** (7.2): cascada songs is the same

**junobeekeeper** (7): My biggest issue with Cascada is that every Cascada song sounds exactly the same and it's never a bad song but really I just want some variety.

**vayyiqra** (6): [copied from my comment on the previous Cascada song: I can't get into Cascada beyond the incredible pop perfection that is "Evacuate the Dancefloor", and I feel bad because I really *want* to, you know?] Also, it doesn't help that this song sounds so much like the last one. I've streamed whole Cascada albums and not been able to tell where one song begins and the other ends. They're fun, but they are a very formulaic band, and not good lyricists either. That instrumental break after the drop is pretty cool though.

**DaHumanTorch** (5.5): i've never heard a cascada song besides this and evacuate the dancefloor and...let's just say cascada isn't too adventurous with her music

**slimboyfriend** (2.5): I'm sorry, I can only take one Cascada song at a time

**mms82** (4.5): eh, cascada is a 1 hit wonder for a reason

**kappyko** (0): wait a minute its the same thing


##**Comments that do neither**

**1998tweety** (10): Cascada is excellence and that's all I have to say on that.

**Mysario** (9.4): worse than Maroon 5 but this still snaps

**\_wailordfan** (7): im I didn't realize two Cascada songs made it in the charity rate

**Leixander** (7): vengaboys found quaking

This is my favorite type of EDM x singer collab, other than Closer (Give it your 11s in the all stars and also decade end rate. Thank you).

---

##**Closer ft. Halsey**


**1998tweety** (10): Underrated bop

**bandnitos** (10): this song is so underrated if y'all paid it dust i will be extremely upset

**mms82** (10): ugh one of the best songs ever, should be an 11 in a different rate

**timothy444** (10): This has always been a sleeper hit for me but every so often, when I come back to listening to this song, it's like Capsize hasn't aged at all. It's not overblown nor does it have that star power of other songs in this rate but Capsize will always remain to be an underrated trop-pop classic for years to come.

**violentovernightrush** (10): im white

**materialqirl** (9): bop

**yourfacesucksass** (9): They used to play this vid on repeat on TeenNick lmfao, not complaining though

**Mysario** (8.9): this song is strangely mesmerizing

**ManofOranges** (8.5): I completely forgot I heard this song before pretty good though

**bespectacIed** (8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I really like Emily Warren’s voice, she deserves to be bigger

**RandomHypnotica** (8): wow this is Karma but made 3 years earlier marina wtf

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): it's good but not super memorable

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): i totally forgot this existed oop, this used to be on the radio all the time back in like 2016 (when I actually listened to the radio). this isn't amazing or anything but i enjoy it and wouldn't skip it if it came on

**Chevsapher** (7.2): It's not bad, but I know Emily Warren can do better.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): a nice mid 2010’s edm bop


##**Side Effects ft. Emily Warren**

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): oof this is already sounding dated tbh

**camerinian** (6.5): this was middle of the road Spotify-core trop pop when it came out, and removed from that time and place I guess that final chorus is a bit more ear-grabbing, but this is still pretty bland

**anothertown** (6): Emily Warren should be properly recognized on this sub for her efforts but i don’t like this song and all its clicking noises

**skargardin** (6): My interest in this song capsized years ago. Pretty inoffensive piece of midtempo edm.

**SteelStepladder** (6): this is peak tropical house but I really really don't like tropical house

**SupremeShani** (6): Throw me into the water.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): I SWEAR I’ve heard this song before but I can’t remember where I heard it from

**vayyiqra** (5): I want to like this because Popheads said Emily Warren reminds them of Kimbra except she doesn't here?? She sounds like avocadies girl singer #23246 and this song isn't interesting.

**wavingwolves** (5): this isn't bad but it just sounds like a lot of other songs from 2016

**waluigiest** (4): isn’t she running for president?

**cloudbustingmp3** (3.2): the spotify algorithm pop jumped out

**kappyko** (3): why did this end like a thank u next cut?

This is a really crisp and nice ballad. Also we've finally reached the 7.-average!

---

##**Young, stressed & depressed**

**SFbby** (10): Sad Bop

**timothy444** (10): Found a new song to put in my rotation playlist <3 . Reminds me of Christina Perri.

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): whoever submitted sasha ily. this isnt my fav song of her but ugh its still amazing

**1998tweety** (9): Cite

**Chevsapher** (8.6): Nothing groundbreaking, but exquisitely executed.

**Leixander** (8.5): the piano tune is reminding me of another song, solid

**SupremeShani** (8.5): So soft and tender, but not in way that bores me.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): this is a beautiful song, and the art works with it

**bandnitos** (8): sad peace signs

**bespectacIed** (8): hauntingly good

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its a bop but idk if its worth all the buzz around her

**vayyiqra** (8): Sasha Sloan appears on my Twitter feed a lot and I remember "oh yeah she looks cool I should get into her" and I never listen to her, but I really like this song. It's going down because of Popheads' well-known balladophobia, but it's one of the nicest songs in the rate and is even making me a bit emotional. :'(


##**Young, dumb & broke**


**violentovernightrush** (7.8): not my fave sasha song, check out at least i look cool if you like this

**Mysario** (7.7): generic slow song but I'm about it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): Her voice sounds like a grown up Billie Eilish and I like it!

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Oh she died? Awwwww. Mmmmmm. ANYWAY...

**junobeekeeper** (6.1): it chill.

**camerinian** (5.5): these hyper-tasteful piano ballads do nothing for me, but power to you if you get something out of this I guess

**evilqueenlex** (5.5): I really dislike songs in this style but it's not bad.

**SteelStepladder** (5): It's a perfect five. Not really interesting enough to really like but nothing really bad about it either

**waluigiest** (5): Taylor Swift as Bombalurina outsold

**kappyko** (4.5): cute

Yeah, keep suing the dead guy, old white men.

---


##**Juice WRLD**


**agentofscranton** (10): as soon as the song hits the chorus, i revert back into being a closeted teenager who would only ever admit to listening to pop-punk songs like this, but when i ran home i’d thrash about to teenage dream on repeat - and i’m a sucker for a good song about running away together

**camerinian** (10): fuck I hate Yellowcard, cos they seem like genuinely loathsome people with zero artistic integrity, what they're doing to Juice Wrld is completely shameful, and they also just happened to make one of the best pop punk songs of all time so I can't even pretend they'll be nothing more than a footnote in history. Fuck you Yellowcard. I love this song

**evilqueenlex** (10): would've been an 11 if it wasn't for American Boy being on this list.

**junobeekeeper** (10): look any song with an electric violin will get no less than 10 from me!

**kappyko** (10): DUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUVAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAL

**letsallpoo** (10): please stop suing juice wrld

**Mysario** (10): from one of the best albums of this genre, this song captures the pure essence of pop-punk perfectly with its hard sound, catchy melodies, and lyrics that relate to all teens out there who just wanna run away with their crush. Plus, it has violins! Name a better song with strings that isn't "Untouched" by the Veronicas, I'll wait

**poppinmmolly** (10): ugh one of my childhood faves!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): 2006 me loves whoever submitted this as their entry

**SteelStepladder** (10): This is the best mall rock/pop punk song ever made and I will hold this song close to my heart in a way other songs cant come close

**untutorable** (10): peak pop punk

**berober04** (9.5): https://soundcloud.com/theearlymourning/parallels

**anothertown** (9): Still bangs!

**Chevsapher** (9): This is 2000s pop rock at its best.

**hikkaru** (9): we love pop punk!

**materialqirl** (9): i was a middle school emo.. *ptsd*

**rickikardashian** (9): honestly, can we bring back emo angsty punk? I was always way too young to live it fully, but now I can pierce my nose and she my hair black if I wanted to

**waluigiest** (9): IF I COULD FIND YOU NOWWWW

**wavingwolves** (8.5): i love this song even if it reminds me of my first girlfriend

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its iconic but them suing juice wrld made me take off points. Jk its just that there’s better pop punk anthems to choose than this.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): Band Hero memories…

**1998tweety** (7.5): Bops a bit

**SupremeShani** (7.5): I feel like this was only included for the drama of the Juice WRLD lawsuit, and I appreciate that.

**bespectacIed** (7): Emo/scene music kinda had the tea with its depiction of directionless, bum lives. I want what they have


##**Yellowcard**


**ignitethephoenix** (7): if you looked up generic mid 2000’s pop punk song, this would probably be here

**moooo566** (7): this really isnt very good but it gets nostalgia points



**ReallyCreative** (6): An iconic bop symbolic of middle school. Too bad middle school fucking sucked.

**selegend** (6): i love emo

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): this kinda reminds me of gotta go my own way from high school musical 2


**cloudbustingmp3** (4): a throwback but not i've ever liked

**DaHumanTorch** (4): as ive said for lots of this, just not my type of music whoops

**realboxwood** (4): Hey fuck these guys

**vayyiqra** (4): All the emo kids loved this song when I was in middle school and high school and I don't think I've ever sat and listened to the whole thing myself, and it's ... okay. I can see identifying with the lyrics as a teenager, but otherwise I don't really like it. Emo music was never my thing - I was only emo where it counts, on the inside. :pensive:

**mms82** (2): super annoying

**violentovernightrush** (2): i'm not emo

**bandnitos** (1): that's for juice wrld

**pickupthephonebaby** (1): fuck yellowcard. rip juice wrld

I have a lot of nostalgia for this song, it's v fun for me but objectively kinda terrible lmao.

##**Kesha-stans**

**bandnitos** (10): yes i listen to rock music, dad

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): FUCK YOU!!!! ugh her mind

**hikkaru** (10): one of the only great songs on this album tbh, but whew it SLAPS

**Leixander** (10): FUCK YOU! SUCKER!

**skargardin** (10): Robbed of being a single methinks

**rotating3Dtext** (9.8): fuck you I still like sucker

**chihuahuazero** (9.5): New-Wavey goodness.

**\_wailordfan** (9): FUCK YOU

**camerinian** (9): this isn't even remotely what I want to hear anymore from Charli but holy shit I'm just glad a Charli XCX jock jam exists, I'd fully watch more sports if this played under the highlights (haha no I wouldn't imagine tho)

**DaHumanTorch** (9): FUCK YOUUUUUUUU SUCKAAA...ngl i miss this charli a lil bit! i live for her current music but i would love a track or two with this vibe in the future

**pickupthephonebaby** (9): underrated !!!!!

**SFbby** (9): Pop star Charli at full power on a catchy f*** you anthem

**waluigiest** (9): this punky Charli song is a huge guilty pleasure for me

**yourfacesucksass** (9): I will forever lover her Sucker era punk rock even if she hates it

**Mysario** (8.6): worse than JoBros but this still slaps

**anothertown** (8.5): I haven't been a serious charli listener since True Romance so i'm finding it fun how you can trace a coherent musical identity through the eras

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Not as groundbreaking as her new stuff but Charli saying “Fuck You sucker” is iconic

**slimboyfriend** (8): Charli hated Dr. Luke before it was cool...... she knew he was sleazy

**SteelStepladder** (8): I played this on repeat when I got this album but I do admit it pales next to most of the songs from Charli

**untutorable** (8): real charli fans give this a good score if you don't f*ck you sucker!!

**vayyiqra** (8): I remember seeing Charli in 2014 on tour for *Sucker* before the album had even come out, and she opened with this, and I had no idea what it was, but Charli screaming "FUCK YOU" and giving the audience the finger made me intrigued, because it was so different from her other music. It's a banger and a great opener to an underrated album. The production has aged badly, but it's fun and the lyrics are just dumb enough to loop back around and become brilliant.

**wavingwolves** (8): charli tried to revived the pop punk genre with her own hands and everyone paid dust but i appreciated it!

**Chevsapher** (7.7): I can't with that chorus, but I love the punchy-chaotic production.

**static\_int\_husp** (7.5): love the incredibly cheesy chorus. "Fuck you! Suckahhhhhhh!"

**evilqueenlex** (7): she should remake this song with her style of production now.

**materialqirl** (7): for a charli song e..

**realboxwood** (7): jayznoddingconfusedly.gif

**rickikardashian** (6.9): my score is as much of a joke as it is honest

**SupremeShani** (6.5): If I'm being honest, I never listened to Sucker before because Charli fans always says it's her worst album, and it's *interesting*.

**ExtraEater** (6): The last charity rate had SuperLove. This one has Sucker. lol

**gannade** (6): charli lowkey peaked during this era and yall keep stanning her pulling a zipper back and forth and calling it music



##**Kim Petras-stans**

**SendMeYourSATScores** (6): i don’t think i’m gay enough to enjoy this

**violentovernightrush** (6): submitting a song from true romance was bold (this is proto pc music)

**ManofOranges** (5): ...not charli's best

**Tolk1en** (5): the screaming hurts my ears, rest is fine

**mms82** (4.5): Charli XCX didn't have a great song between Boom Clap and Boys, fight me

**1998tweety** (4): I swear y'all early Charli stans are masochists. Brat-pop is awful except for Itzy.

**ningxin17** (4): iconic garbage

**RandomHypnotica** (4): this song is just edgy in all the wrong ways

**kappyko** (3): sucker was honestly a backloaded record

**ReallyCreative** (3): the song is close to greatness but not in the "it's good not great" way but in the "it almost did something, but missed, crashed, and set the entire countryside on fire" way

**timothy444** (3): Charli XCX before she was good

**bespectacIed** (2): I routinely forget that Sucker (album) is part of Charli's stunning discography for my mental health

**ImADudeDuh** (1): the first 45 seconds….. What the fuck.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): when will charli xcx and her fans realize that just because something is mildly catchy and unique it doesn’t make it good

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (1): this is fucking awful lol

I love this song and I really wish it had gotten a proper release

---

##**https://i.imgur.com/CllNkU5.png**

**DaHumanTorch** (11): one of my favorite lana songs and one of my favorite songs in general. a pure hate crime that this is unreleased. this had better make top 10 at least

**RandomHypnotica** (11): The fact that this song got cut from Born to Die is one of the greatest tragedies, it's one of Lana's best songs with a sultry, callous edge that i just LOVE

**1998tweety** (10): This isn't even her best unreleased song but I need to support Lana with a 10. A bop.

**junobeekeeper** (10): Wow, I feel like I've experienced 10 whole relationships, despite having been in zero! Lana's power!

**SFbby** (10): THE MOAN IS EVERYTHING

**SupremeShani** (10): Saying this sounds odd, but this song is how I discovered Lana. I was like browsing YouTube for Gaga leaks and demos when this showed up in my recommendations and I was *hooked*.

**wavingwolves** (10): i can't believe this was never released because this is kind of the ultimate lana del rey song

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Why was this never released? I think It’s one of my favourite songs I’ve heard from her!

**violentovernightrush** (9.5): let me take you back to my original tumblr tags when this was first posted there: #lana del rey #music box (this is a joke please laugh)

**Chevsapher** (9.1): The lyrics seem rather immature, but dang, this is undisputably one of Lana's best.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I actually think the trap beat holds this song back a bit but wow, I'm questioning Lana's taste if this didn't make the cut

**waluigiest** (9): …then what’s the worst thing that could happen to a girl who is already hurt….

**ningxin17** (8.5): slight tweaks to the production would make this timeless

**bespectacIed** (8): bopppp. The horns elevate the song

**ExtraEater** (8): Happiness is a Butterfly is the better LDR song about serial killers

**Leixander** (8): could be on Born To Die instead of Radio or smth

**materialqirl** (8): but queen of disaster is better

**alasyorick** (7.8): a nice jam

**Mysario** (7.6): the song isn't that great with an overbearing instrumental and cheesy lyrics even for Lana but gotta give props to whoever decided to put in an "unreleased" song

**vayyiqra** (7): This edgy title, and the crackling like it's a worn-out vinyl record, is not it. However, the hip-hop beat with the strings, and the very Lana vocals (including a reference to cola) do give an interesting insight into what would become her *Born to Die* sound, and I love *Born to Die*, so I kind of like it.


##**🔪🔪🔪🔪🔪**

**camerinian** (6.5): yo I love Lana but that has to be her tumblriest song ever

**bandnitos** (6): its alright but i wish it had a snare for some parts instead of just the clap

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (5.5): i see why this was left off btd 💀

**SendMeYourSATScores** (5): i really just don’t get the appeal of lana, this is probably her most exciting song but it’s still fairly boring and her delivery is so jarring, and for some reason there are people that label this song as “beautiful” which makes absolutely no sense to me

**kappyko** (4): the youtube link made this sound fine but stan paradise (song) instead

**ImADudeDuh** (3): shoutout to the lyric video that spelled ignite “Ignight”

**SteelStepladder** (3): I really don't like Lana outside of her new album and a few singles here and there. This song just sounds kind of messy and all over the place

**cloudbustingmp3** (1.3): god this is one of lana's worst and i can't believe people really think this is some sort of hidden gem that should've been released lmao

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): I forced a bot to listen to over 1000 hours of Billie Eilish songs and then asked it to write a Billie Eilish song of its own

##**Currently giving that big booty a slap**



**ExtraEater** (11): Can't wait for this masterpiece to win with an 11.000 average

**1998tweety** (10): Classic shit, y'all please don't do this dirty.

**berober04** (10): Close my eyes and pretend I'm 18 again and the world is still my oyster...

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we Love the national anthem for the united states of america

**ManofOranges** (10): This is a 10 solely because of the female vocals alone

**moooo566** (10): bop bop bop bop bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): YOU KNOW I KNOW HOW

**skargardin** (10): Possibly David Guetta's peak? Honestly this song is so describing of the 2010 stupid dance club era of music that I loved to death. Its' trashy as hell but so much fun. I submitted this just bc I rediscovered it a couple of weeks ago and was hit with nostalgia, oop.

**TiltControls** (10): Flo Rida needs more love. This song, wild ones and right round - all 100% bops

**DaHumanTorch** (9.5): timeless bop, one of my favorites from when i was a kid and it still holds up

**mms82** (9): great song still

**timothy444** (9): It's a Flo Rida and David Guetta song so of course it's going to be an absolute banger!

**alasyorick** (8.7): iconic

**Mysario** (8.7): childhood bop when I didn't go to clubs except that one time I went to an under 21 club oh God I'm gonna puke remembering that

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): A throwback bop! Never forget the EDM drop era! If this goes our day 1, just cancel popheads honestly.

**bespectacIed** (8): nostalgic

**kappyko** (8): oh this is good shit

**violentovernightrush** (8): it doesn't seem like he was doing that crazy, why couldn't the club handle him

**yourfacesucksass** (7.8): I laugh because Nicole gets no credit for this song lmfao

**Chevsapher** (7.6): I just found out that David Guetta and his team produced “I Gotta Feeling.” He didn't stray far from the formula with this song, although somehow, the result feels generic and flat.

**ningxin17** (7): LOVE the chorus, the verses are pretty bland/generic though

**SupremeShani** (7): There's a small part of me that misses the days when Flo Rida and David Guetta ruled the charts.


##**Can't afford Apple Bottoms-jeans**

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): like sure this rocked the alcohol-free chorus parties in 10th grade but it's not life changing in any way

**bandnitos** (6): isn't this the song from the guinea pig movie

**SteelStepladder** (6): Flo Rida, the king of great hooks with nothing verses

**wavingwolves** (6): nostalgia makes this sounds better than it is, but i'm happy we all agreed to let david guetta die!

**anothertown** (5): the brief but irritating era of pop maximalism on the eve of dubstep...

**camerinian** (5): this slaps until you remember that Flo Rida is the main presence and primary credit for this and yet the song would lose nothing if he wasn't here

**junobeekeeper** (5): I forgot about Flo Rida. Anyway, I've never been to a "club" but like. I'm sure it could handle Flo Rida.

**materialqirl** (5): its not 2009..

**cloudbustingmp3** (4): fun as a catchphrase but ugh there's something about early 10s EDM that sounds so cheap 90% of the time

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): Flo Rida peaked at Low

**vayyiqra** (2): Yeah no Flo Rida is only good as a meme and even then ... He can stay back in the 2000s. (Wait this came out in 2010? He was still relevant by then? Amazing.) Maybe if I were drunk at a summer party back then, I might mildly enjoy this, but as it stands, being depressed on a bleak winter afternoon at my kitchen table, this just doesn't hit.

##**Had a Valentine's date yesterday**

**Mysario** (10): big bop, one of my fave radio rock songs of the past decade! And I still got that love that keeps me waiting: my dumb cat when she makes me wait for her to MOVE off my staircase so I don't step on her and trip and fall and die. MOVE!!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Y’all are gonna do this song dirty bc it’s a rock song sung by a guy but this song slaps and I feel sorry for those who can’t see that

**timothy444** (10): Used to hate this song when it came out but now I can appreciate it. The origin of the music video itself is hilarious and it's a modern rock song that feels like a rock song. Pure simplicity.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): my personal pick! i went back and forth between a lot of stuff but ultimately i settled with the song that was highest on my decade-end playlist (which you can listen to here https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3b6RUNWGXq3deIBsha5pKZ?si=_XIvBL9SSiWcCROTDudcoQ) that we probably would never otherwise rate.

**mms82** (9.8): such a good song

**evilqueenlex** (9): I used to listen to The Black Keys so much

**ReallyCreative** (9): not gays on this sub sleeping on this song despite it being the most relatable song on the rate for them

**slimboyfriend** (9): indieheads unite!!!

**violentovernightrush** (9): remember 8tracks? yeah. i thought i was a hipster in 2011. i wasn't.

**waluigiest** (9): loved this era

**camerinian** (8.5): I'm fully of the impression that retro pandering bands like The Black Keys are at least partly responsible for killing the mainstream rock scene, but I can't pretend this doesn't still go the fuck off

**junobeekeeper** (8.2): Fun! Really pumps me up!

**1998tweety** (8): Bops a bit

**ImADudeDuh** (8): maybe heterosexuals do deserve rights

**SupremeShani** (8): I'm sure Popheads can relate.

**Chevsapher** (7.8): Interesting textures.

**bandnitos** (7): my older brother only listened to this song for like three months so like . it's ingrained into my mind

**DaHumanTorch** (7): i have such distinct memories of this song but i also feel like ive never heard it before huh...the chorus snaps tho, but the verses could have been better

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): ok i feel this

**SteelStepladder** (7): This one got hammered out of my good graces through commercials but I can see it has quality in it

**bespectacIed** (6): bop

**chihuahuazero** (6): The pinnacle of radio alternative.


##**Lonely, lonely boys**


**Tolk1en** (6): repetitive and boring

**vayyiqra** (6): I mean same, and this song is okay, but a little too rock-adjacent for me. I like the woman's voice though.

**ningxin17** (5): this is objectively a decent song but the black keys are so bland, sanitized, and soulless, I find it thoroughly unenjoyable

**Leixander** (3): does nothing for me

**cloudbustingmp3** (2): this song just irritates me for some irrational reason im sorry

**anothertown** (1): a man referring to himself as a boy… check. white noise ass brewery rock… check.

##**Destiny's Child**


**Leixander** (10): this will get robbed massively and i'll be mad... respect the legend!

**mms82** (10): this song is sex

**waluigiest** (10): this song made me believe in sex GOD I loved this when it came out and I still listen to it regularly

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.7): i just wanna say kelly rowland is the true gay icon

**evilqueenlex** (9.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tWMq8AlShcU

**SFbby** (9): The better Motivation song

**1998tweety** (8.5): Normani is....not really shaking

**Chevsapher** (8.1): Oh my.

**bespectacIed** (8): normani outsold

**SupremeShani** (8): I wonder how many Normani comments they will be.

**DaHumanTorch** (7.5): bop, though i could have done without lil wayne. kelly deserved better

**rickikardashian** (7.5): I straight up can't listen to this song without hearing Miss Juicy saying "I DONT WANNA FEEL MY...... ^LEEEEE^EEEEEGSSS "

**Mysario** (7.2): I miss the era of when every song had a Lil Wayne verse

**bandnitos** (7): god this just sounds so dated

**ImADudeDuh** (7): kinda awkward at points but still a bop

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): stream motivation by normani

**slimboyfriend** (7): Lil Wayne has never sounded sexier. So uh thx, Kelly

**SteelStepladder** (7): This song kinda slaps but I wouldn't go out of my way to listen to it.

**untutorable** (7): wayne's feature is so ridiculous it's a good song it really is but i can't get over "i put her on my plate, then i do the dishes"

**vayyiqra** (7): I've never heard Kelly Rowland's solo music, but this is good! It's really smooth, I love the instrumental, and her voice. I daresay it's even better than Normani's "Motivation", which is what I thought it was at first, though that is also a bop.

**violentovernightrush** (7): bop


##**Fifth Harmony**


**wavingwolves** (7): "when i'm done she hold me like a conversation" i mean... if you say so

**agentofscranton** (6.5): there’s a really fine line between being sexy and being kinda cringe, and this is definitely more on the cringe side of that spectrum

**CreepyMannequin** (6.5): would be at least a 7.5 without Lil Wayne

**camerinian** (6): this is Kelly's most popular song? Really?

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (6): i am imagining /u/gannade saying he doesnt want to feel his.... laaaygs

**anothertown** (5): Did she say "I don't wanna feel my legs"

**mudkip1** (5): normani outdanced

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this bitch really made a song about squirting and then made lil wayne sing “rain on my head call that brainstorming” huh

##**Prom queens**

**bandnitos** (10): IM SITTING HERE BBQ SAUCE ON MY TITTIES

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a song I randomly came across in the new music friday playlist and it kinda bopped

**rickikardashian** (10): It's quite shocking how bedroom pop is still a very small genre on this sub, but it does have a very great gems, and I truly think that mxmtoon is one of them. She maked very cute, honest tunes, and she deserves way more recognition than she actually gets. Give her music a listen, she probably will impress you c:

**materialqirl** (9.5): im sitting here crying in my prom dress

**realboxwood** (9.5): I'm morally opposed to quirky indie pop but this bops

**cloudbustingmp3** (9.3): this is cute and the production is like lowkey but surprisingly intricate? love it

**1998tweety** (9): Cute, we love an indie queen

**ReallyCreative** (9): UHM a serve???? We are taking NOTES

**SFbby** (9): Do schools really hold prom at school???? I know I wouldn't want to go back to school for an out-of-school event that's supposed to be about fun and enjoying the night.

**Chevsapher** (8.7): I was homeschooled until college, so I don't relate to this song at all, but it's so endearing! It sounds like something from a modern Broadway show.

**junobeekeeper** (8.7): oh mood

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): for some reason the name gave me kpop vibes so this song was NOT was i was expecting. That being said, it's pretty cute

**waluigiest** (8): okay this was cute and a little bit of a jam! I’m sittin here...... crying in my prom dress

**Mysario** (7.8): this song was good

**chihuahuazero** (7.5): Sadness sounds so cozy.

**evilqueenlex** (7.5): I'm too old for this song but it's cute

**SupremeShani** (7.5): This is such a cute tune, I hope she continues to hone her songwriting skills and branch out in terms of production and instruments.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): relatable

**bespectacIed** (7): bop

**wavingwolves** (7): i only know this girl and her songs because of tiktok and i think this one is pretty enjoyable and quite dreamy

**SteelStepladder** (7): Tik Tok has been using it's powers for good thankfully. Way better than all the shitty vine rap that got through

**vayyiqra** (7): Story time: I did not go to my own prom because I was 2cool4school, but I did go to my friend's because she asked me to be her date kind of as a joke, and at the afterparty we got super drunk and hooked up, and it was a terrible idea, and I lost my wallet, and anyway fuck prom. I totally empathize with mxmtoon here and this is a cute song.

**camerinian** (6.5): eh, sure, it's boppy.

##**Stephen King - Carrie**



**ignitethephoenix** (7): this is too indie / High school chick flick movie for me

**moooo566** (7): cant relate

**SendMeYourSATScores** (7): idk why i find this song so haunting, maybe it’s just because i’m literally old


**slimboyfriend** (6.5): indie pop girl voices unite

**anothertown** (6): Firstable, young people of popheads, please don’t think that high school means anything because it doesn’t, no one gives a shit once you have left. Secondable, for a relatable tik toker singer songwriter, these lyrics are incredibly underbaked

**DaHumanTorch** (6): eh not really my thing but i like her voice and the lyrics

**kappyko** (6): ily ricki

**violentovernightrush** (5.2): don't like the song but mxmtoon is so pretty and i'm gay so

**camerinian** (10): God Hozier's first album is fucking fantastic. This is an easy 10, and still I'm not sure if it'd be in my top 5 from the album. The smouldering atmosphere, the morbid lyrics and Hozier's liquid gold voice are a chocolate and peanut butter combination

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WHEN 👏 MY 👏 TIME COMES AROUND 👏👏 LAY ME GENTLY IN THE COLD DARK EARTH! 👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏👏

**mudkip1** (10): gay icon

**waluigiest** (10): god I forgot how much I loved this song and this album. The simple orchestration and the flowery, sweet lyrics just amplify the melodies. It’s a masterpiece in songwriting.

**SupremeShani** (9.5): There was this Tumblr post that was like this song played in an abandoned mine, and that's all I can think about.

**bandnitos** (9): i am just . i am just fucking vibing

**Chevsapher** (8.9): Excellent lyrics, tangible vibes.

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): god i love hozier's voice so fucking much, like idk a better male singer

**ignitethephoenix** (8): a good sad boi song

**SteelStepladder** (7): Oof, bad memories associated with this one to the point where I can't judge it accurately so a seven it gets

**materialqirl** (6): i dont like hozier

**vayyiqra** (6): [insert Hozier meme about lesbians stanning him, him living in the woods, and wondering if he ever made it to church] I like this although it's really slow going, after all the boppy uptempo songs in this rate.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): boneless Take Me to Church

**moooo566** (5): i just dont really get hozier

**Tolk1en** (5): I'm waiting for a big drop like "take me to church" but it's not coming and it's so frustrating...

**cloudbustingmp3** (4.2): this song is so zzzzz you better work bitch

##**Clutching sheets and they’re about to rip**


**1998tweety** (10): Okay I was not expecting this to bop this hard

**kappyko** (10): i heard this vocal delivery and immediately paid attention wow

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): ah yes, sex

**wavingwolves** (10): well i'm a sucker for 1. this kind of retro sound 2. songs about loneliness so this is a 10

**camerinian** (9.5): Honestly, this is the sort of horny energy I think I needed right about now, and it bops too??? Big choon this one

**Mysario** (9.5): this is my favourite song of the rate that I've never heard before

**anothertown** (9): This is a biggg bop and she’s gay also. You love to see it.

**bespectacIed** (9): megabop

**static\_int\_husp** (9): relate way to much

**ReallyCreative** (8.7): This is fun, I wish it was a little more uptempo, but the production is fantastic and L Devine kills the vocals.

**Chevsapher** (8.4): The lyrics are a bit blunt, but the guitars are funky and the melodies are solid.

**junobeekeeper** (8.3): Ok mood!

**bandnitos** (8): i love l devine !! it's not her best song but it goes off

**chihuahuazero** (8): Catchy and popheadsy.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8): the chorus is kinda bland but i love the verses and that wobbly intro

**ningxin17** (8): funky

**vayyiqra** (8): I have no idea who these people are but this bops and also, same girl.

**untutorable** (7.5): sounds like a tove lo song tbh

**SupremeShani** (7): This song has been recommended to me by Spotify so many times, and now that I listened to it, maybe Spotify made some points.

##**Can't take another night on their own**


**DaHumanTorch** (7): didnt dislike it or anything but eh

**ImADudeDuh** (6): sounds like a UK girl that is a one hit wonder that promo’d this song everywhere and did 1 US performance that no one gave a fuck about and went back to obscurity the next year.

**SteelStepladder** (6): This song is good but if I never heard it again I wouldn't be heartbroken

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i really don’t like the implications that she sleeps naked every night why would you do that to yourself? put some pjs on girl

**violentovernightrush** (5): this is kinda nothing

##**Well, where is it?**

**kappyko** (7): thinkpiece incoming


##**🤠🤠🤠🤠🤠**


**1998tweety** (10): We love MaR&Ben MoR&BR&Bis.

**agentofscranton** (10): not me finding out what rsvp stood for from a maren morris bridge

**gannade** (10): this and the bones are the only good songs off GIRL

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we stan CountR&B

**ManofOranges** (10): oui oui escargot baguette oeuvre louvre

**moooo566** (10): wow i love her

**ignitethephoenix** (9): So I’m not a country fan but my friend and fab co host of the Greatest Classic Hits Rate (poppinmmolly) told me to give this a try from Maren Morris discog because it was less country, and I definitely liked it! A bop although 80s Mercedes may be my fav song from her.

**Chevsapher** (8.7): Charismatic delivery, detailed production.

**Mysario** (8.7): this song rok n rolls ya

**DaHumanTorch** (8.5): wait this was cute. ive only known marinara as the middle girl but i may have to check her out

**RandomHypnotica** (8): RSVP? more like RnB

**SupremeShani** (8): Maren needs to make the crossover already and leave those tasteless country radio stations in the dust.

**waluigiest** (8): a sexy lil bop honestly

**violentovernightrush** (7.6): not my fave maren song, ngl!

**bespectacIed** (7): i don't follow maren's career, isn't she a country artist, when did she switch to RnB??? Btw this slaps


##**Didn't get the party invitation**

**vayyiqra** (7): I thought Maren Morris did country, wtf? I remember rating an album of hers and not liking it, and now she's doing this Ariana-esque R&B song with trap beats and I kind of like it? It's bizarre, but whatever. At least it's not country.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I like a country pop song that's unapologetically pop and also I just learned what RSVP stands for

**bandnitos** (6): is she a country artist or not ?? i am confused anyway im indifferent

**camerinian** (5.5): Stream The Highwomen

**junobeekeeper** (5.4): It's average

**SteelStepladder** (5): I tend to like Maren Morris but this is probably one of the most eh songs I've heard from her

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): Old Town Road did Trap Country first and better

##**Vine**


**1998tweety** (10): One of the times where the remix is kind of better. Original is still an absolute 10 though

**bandnitos** (10): a fucking classic

**SendMeYourSATScores** (10): i was gonna submit marian hill’s remix of sweet ophelia but it isn’t on spotify and it turns out there are like 5 songs in this rate aren’t on spotify :/ go stream it

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (10): serve me that country western tinged bop!!!

**violentovernightrush** (10): my yoga teacher was a zella day stan and this is the whitest sentence i have ever typed

**DaHumanTorch** (9): oh this was excellent, another artist from this rate i need to check out

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this sounds like it could’ve been a hit in 2017/18

**Mysario** (9): this song is, in fact, hypnotic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): This bops

**rickikardashian** (8.8): I'll just say, the tiktok version of this that is literally a 10 second remix of a remix slaps harder than it should

**berober04** (8.5): This may the song that has been in my spotify rotation the longest, I can't even remember what was the catalyst for it it's been so long, but it's just a song that makes me smile.

**Chevsapher** (8.3): Nice background vocals!

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): oh wow an interesting interpolation

**ReallyCreative** (7.3): I want to like Zella Day and this song is pretty good but it just comes up short

**camerinian** (7): instrumentally this is pretty blah but the hook is a lot stronger than most of the Spotify-core that sounds like this I'll give it that

**SupremeShani** (7): I have nothing to say, except I thought this said Zelda.


##**TikTok**

**timothy444** (7): I swear I listened to this before…

**bespectacIed** (6): only ok

**vayyiqra** (6): Zella Day is on my long list of "wow I should check her out" but I never do, and this is ... okay. The use of the cliche "Streets of Cairo" riff is weird, though.

**kappyko** (4): OH THIS TIKTOK BOP BSKEBAKEBAKBEAMNBENABEA NBEANMBEAN BEANBEANBEA NBAENBEAMNBEAN NAEMNFA MAWMFAWMFWAM oh the rest of the song is just ok :(

**anothertown** (3.5): can we please retire the "Streets of Cairo" riff!!!!!!!! please!

**SteelStepladder** (3): Can we retire this sample? Please? This song is probably better than a three but I've heard the "theres a hole in the wall" sample be used a billion times and most of those times were better than this that I just tune out when I hear it now

##**Confidantes** 

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): A REINVENTION! also this song + album came into the world like the same couple of weeks i did so it'll always be extra special to me because of that

**DaHumanTorch** (10): aussie princess making pop perfection what else is new

**junobeekeeper** (10): I will never forget the time my mom and I had an argument on whether Kylie Minogue was good (she is, and my mom is wrong). Anyway, this is one of my absolute fave Kylie songs. I love whoever picked this.

**Leixander** (10): kylie serving sex phone operator, what can we do other than stan?

**Chevsapher** (9.7): This might well be the best song in Kylie's discography.

**materialqirl** (9): confide in meme

**ReallyCreative** (9): SimCity 4 SNAPPED

**rickikardashian** (9): this is an unofficial bond song type of song

**slimboyfriend** (9): can indie pop gorl Kylie pls take over America now

**1998tweety** (8.5): Kylie queen

**agentofscranton** (8): this is a better bond theme song than literally every non-skyfall theme

**camerinian** (8): This isn't my favourite Kylie song by a long shot but I really love the mysterious trip-hop vibe this has going, it's like a lost Bond theme

**Mysario** (8): why does this feel like it played during a Yu-Gi-Oh movie?

**SupremeShani** (8): Nobody does seductive like Kylie Minogue.

**vayyiqra** (8): I love Kylie, ~~but it's painful how obviously she is trying to be Madonna on *Ray of Light* here. I still like it though.~~ Wait this came out in 1994?? Never mind, clearly Madonna was trying to be Kylie Minogue. (No shade though because I love both of them, and they are both queens to me. Wow, that is one of the gayest sentences I have ever typed, but I am secure in my sexuality so it's okay. Stream *Aphrodite* and *X*.)


##**Trust Issues**

**timothy444** (7): She has better songs

**violentovernightrush** (7): this sounds like what white people think middle eastern music sounds like

**SteelStepladder** (6): I've somehow completely and utterly missed 90% of Kylie Minogue songs but everything I've heard from her makes me feel completely out of touch with the acclaim she gets in some circles

**the\_pc\_demands\_blood** (5.5): im bored kylie

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this sounds like 3 different songs mashed up into one

**wavingwolves** (5): i forgot i was listening to this song while i was listening to this song

**bandnitos** (4): eh

**SendMeYourSATScores** (4): as much as i try i cannot get myself to enjoy a kylie minogue song

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this is just weird and not in any interesting way

**kappyko** (3): sorry

**RandomHypnotica** (3): honestly i kind of forgot i was even listening to music halfway through this song

**letsallpoo** (11): the greatest song ever made

**berober04** (10): https://www.popjustice.com/briefing/we-will-pay-100-to-the-first-major-pop-act-to-make-everyone-go-fucking-hell/

**ExtraEater** (10): Masterpiece!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): wait why is this so much better than I expected? We fucking stan!

**Leixander** (10): YOU CAN'T MISTAKE MY BIOLOGY!

**moooo566** (10): girls allowed are the best girl band please @ me

**anothertown** (9.5): Wtf! Queens of unconventional song structure! My two favorite trends of mid-2000s British pop girls were neo-soul and Space-Age-y electronic soundscapes and this has exactly both of them

**bespectacIed** (9): megabop

**DaHumanTorch** (9): wait this snapped, who is this girl group what

**vayyiqra** (9): I have a degree in biology and everything after the (kind of bad) intro is perfection and I love the unconventional structure of this song and the way the chorus hits when it finally comes in. I heard it on the radio in a pharmacy once and loved it and got into Girls Aloud and now I am a believer. Stream *Chemistry*!

**waluigiest** (9): okay I’d never heard this but major bop alert

**Mysario** (8.6): hello class, welcome to Bops 101!

**camerinian** (8.5): not really digging the spoken word chorus but the transition from that 70s rock stomp into the eurotrash breakdown is so fucking good I don't even care

**SupremeShani** (8.5): I never realized how unorthodox the structure for this song was for pop music.

**SteelStepladder** (8): Awww this is lovely!!

**Chevsapher** (7.8): There's a lot going on here, but most of the melodies are pop gold.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): Kinda repetitive but its catchy

**wavingwolves** (7): a song called biology from a album called chemistry? we stan

**junobeekeeper** (6.9): I expected AP Bio and this is not what I got. Kinda bops though?

##**Flunked science in 7th grade**


**ReallyCreative** (7.3): like too many girl groups (especially from the UK I've noticed) the base of the song is fine but it just doesn't really do anything or go anywhere, and suffers as a result

**rickikardashian** (6.5): this starts very similar to ABBA's Waterloo, and it got me hyped as fast as it got me crushed

**slimboyfriend** (6): sounds like 3 good songs mashed together with randomized lyrical topics

**timothy444** (6): It's boring but it's okay for a song to be boring. It just won't be getting a high score from me.

**violentovernightrush** (5.6): girls aloud has songs that are 50x better than this

**yourfacesucksass** (5): I wish this was Girls Silent

**bandnitos** (4): why does this sound like something off of a broadway musical soundtrack but not in a good way

**kappyko** (2): sorry i hate uk girl groups in this era edit: nvm just girls aloud

**Roxieloxiw** (11): did I really give this my 11 over work song, yes, am I sorry, maybe but this song is literally an instant bop. I love this game so much and I will go out of my way to go to new donk city just to hear the band play it I love it

**1998tweety** (10): Don't do this bop dirty y'all...

**agentofscranton** (10): super mario odyssey is my favourite video game of all time, and the mario franchise (really nintendo as a whole) means a great deal to me, and this song was such a great little love letter to the greatest man to ever come from italy - da vinci could never - the living tombstone remix also fucking slaps

**DaHumanTorch** (10): pauline ended all of ur favs, the main pop girl we dream about. i hope she makes a comeback for the sequel to once again save the industry

**ExtraEater** (10): A song that nobody hates, right?

**hikkaru** (10): MAIN POP GIRL

**ImADudeDuh** (10): if your favorite kingdom isn’t the mexican kingdom, you are a racist. This is a fact.

**pickupthephonebaby** (10): main pop girl

**SteelStepladder** (10): Super Mario Odyssey is one of my favorite games of the decade and this is my favorite part of the game

**SupremeShani** (10): Optimism is the only way I can describe this. I have been obsessed with song ever since it was revealed in that trailer, such an unabashedly blast of joy. You all better give Miss Pauline the respect she deserves.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): Pauline Main Pop Girl

**timothy444** (10): I own a Nintendo Switch but never played the game. That won't stop me from giving this banger a 10 though!

**Mysario** (9.9): the only time Nintendo has put out an actually great song on purpose ("DK Rap" withstanding). It's so fun and full of life! This was the last song I had to rate and what a great way to end it. Despite owning most first party Switch games, I don't own Odyssey so docking a point for my own carelessness

**Chevsapher** (9.1): This song has no right to be this good.

**anothertown** (9): Ok but this part in the game when you go through the festival and all the fireworks are going off n shit ;___;

**camerinian** (9): I cannot believe how smart all these fucking puns about Mario and the Switch are, and how they actually fucking work so well, God I love Nintendo so much

**napsandnetflix** (9): main pop girl pauline snapped

The production on this is really dreamy, but I really prefer pretty much every song on tu,n over any song on sweetener

---


##**yuh**



**bandnitos** (10): this is the best song in her entire discography but my 11 can't go to this, sadly

**DaHumanTorch** (10): ugh what a beautiful song! i love the drop and the vocals on the second verse and the end were especially pretty. the da da da's were ethereal. definitely one of the best songs in this rate.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love how Ariana put her own spin on this song, definitely one of the more underrated tracks on this album

**ManofOranges** (10): Personally wasn't really a fan of Sweetener but this song is definitely one I can get behind

**SupremeShani** (10): Ariana needs to cover more of Imogen's discography, or just bring her in the studio at some point, because this is my one of my favorite songs Ariana has ever done. Just the perfect blend of sweetness and intimacy and airiness.

**timothy444** (10): Damn that outro with Ariana's humming

**mudkip1** (9.5): the dubstep-ish moments keep it from a full 10 but i genuinely love this song so much

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): this a great cover that really blends the feel of both the original and the rest of Sweetener together into one track

**\_wailordfan** (9): My dumbass didn't realize this was a cover until last month, and this is hands down one of my fav songs on Sweetener and it wasn't even one of her original songs.

**bespectacIed** (9): Sweetener one of the best pop albums of our generation

**camerinian** (9): I know I'm in a small minority with this opinion, but Sweetner is my favourite Ari album, and they did it dirty by rushing out Thank U Next, cos there were so many incredible tracks like this which deserved all the promo

**ningxin17** (9): the layered vocals 🥺

**SendMeYourSATScores** (9): 3rd best sweetener track

**Tolk1en** (9): who is cooking onions again ?

**waluigiest** (9): the last four tracks of Sweetener are amazing. I was going through a breakup when the album came out and it never fails to put me back in that zone in an almost soft, comforting way. Her lush voice and the pulsing, trappy production are both so gorgeous

**alasyorick** (8.9): cute song good cover deserves more love.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This used to be my fav song off the album during release month but then I grew a brain and started stanning everytime and better off. It's still cute tho

**mms82** (8.5): not aris best but still good

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): oops I like this more than the original

**Chevsapher** (8.3): The drop seems undercooked, but otherwise, I love the production. The R&B-styled vocals are a good touch.

**cloudbustingmp3** (8.1): okay this would've been my 0 had i not had a revelation with Petener a couple of weeks ago and now i can appreciate what she did with the source material

**skargardin** (8): A great cover that plays to Ariana's strengths, a favorite off of sweetener

**violentovernightrush** (8): it hurts so much

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): Ariana does well here in the chorus and bridge but queen Imogen does it best (as she does most things), production isn't *quite* there for me but it's an interesting interpretation

**anothertown** (7.5): this song has grown on me more over time... everybody say thank you Tommy Brown.

**junobeekeeper** (7.5): Literally a whole vibe. The production on the vocals is *chefs kiss*.

**Leixander** (7.5): love the layered vocals but otherwise eventless cover

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): we need to goodnight n go to the polls in 2020 to beat trump!

**ExtraEater** (7): Original is way better

**SteelStepladder** (7): I like it but there is better songs on both Sweetner and Thank U, Next

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): I feel like the adlibs at the end were really unnecessary but otherwise its a cute song

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of *thank u, next* (yuh yuh) but this is one of the better songs on it for sure


##**nuh**

**Mysario** (6.9): Ari has a great voice that works with this song but if anybody else did this, it would be boring and that's kinda where this lies for me

**agentofscranton** (6): she's a cute girl but she's no imogen heap

**SFbby** (6): The beat drop happens at wrong time :(

**moooo566** (4): sure is one of aris most boring songs

**wavingwolves** (4): the pre chorus is good but the actual chorus is so fucking bad that just sours the whole thing

**ImADudeDuh** (1): fuck no

**kappyko** (1): one of her worst im so sorry :(

**gannade** (0): ari incomprehensibly missing high notes over a basic trap beat? wow, how innovative. thank u next.

##**https://open.spotify.com/track/1yERtbTiF9fKGxaelyLJOA?si=YmIN_w-oQECa0j3dWkKAaQ**



**1998tweety** (10): This is so groovy and nice

**bespectacIed** (10): Take Me Apart is the most brilliant, forward-thinking, pop album of the 2010s, give Kelela her fucking due

**evilqueenlex** (10): kelela is so damn good I have yet to hear a song by her I didn't like.

**Leixander** (9.5): dancing_detective_pikachu.gif

**wavingwolves** (9.5): this is a SERVE. what a gorgeous song.

**bandnitos** (9): yes !! ma'am !! thank you

**camerinian** (9): ugh this whole album is so fucking good

**kappyko** (9): only giving a 9 for the fish eggs video https://twitter.com/kuntdeluxe/status/1223758759714930688?s=20

**ReallyCreative** (9): the production on this song just checks all the boxes, such a chill song but there's a lot going on here

**SupremeShani** (9): I wanted to give this a ten just because I just know Popheads is going to disrespect Kelala.

**Chevsapher** (8.4): If the chorus was better, I would give this a 9. The production is immaculate.

**violentovernightrush** (8.3): kelala's voice is as hot as she is, thank god

**DaHumanTorch** (8): oooo this was good, i've never heard a kelela song until now and i might have to check her out

**junobeekeeper** (8): I realy like the instrumental here

**vayyiqra** (8): I read an interview with Kelela not too long ago, where she ranted about her hatred of white people listening to her music or something, which made me think "uhh okay, I guess I will respect that and not listen to your music then" but I am going to look past it now because this is a great song. I love nu disco, house and all adjacent genres, and she has a nice voice. I may have to completely change my mind on her and want to hear more from her.

**cloudbustingmp3** (7.8): not a highlight from the album but still good


##**https://open.spotify.com/track/5JHNg1hxZFT7TDEphhM4wj?si=V8hPTe_pS4-eoapSvR4alw**


**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): ok?

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i can’t remember anything about it

**SteelStepladder** (5): Kinda forgettable honestly :/

**mudkip1** (4): show me frontline and ill give her the 10 she deserves

**mms82** (3.5): boring

**Mysario** (0): I rated this higher because I liked the feel of this song but then I forgot how it went and everything about it 10 seconds later soooooo.... look, I think the worst thing a song can do is be forgettable. If it's good, you'll remember how catchy it was. If it's bad, you'll remember some stand out tragedies to it. If it has any one characteristic to it that you can hold on to, then at least it made an impact. Outside of the brief moment, I can't really say this had much of an impact on me or anything about it truly stood out. Sorry Kelela but you are tonight's biggest loser

bespectacIed: Yup we really need to have a rate with Take Me Apart on it someday so i can forget that a fucking Kelela song (one of the best on a spectacular album, at that !!!!l) only ranked 22, this is travesty, tastelessness and antiblackness

[/r/popheads/comments/f4epes/charity_rate_ii_sylvia_rivera_law_project_day_2/fhqrb9o/]

=====

JustinJSrisuk: It ended up this high in the rate because I had the taste to submit it! Though I feel like if I chose *Let Me Know* instead of this then it would’ve made it to day 3.

King shit!!!! Also Empress Of's vocals? Queen shit!!!!

##**Empress Of Everything**



**bespectacIed** (10): One of my favorite Dev songs

**cloudbustingmp3** (10): i feel my bones i feel my bones i feel my bones crack in your arms askjnakjsjksakjfasfn wig

**mudkip1** (10): love this

**SupremeShani** (10): I just realized I have heard this song so many times, but I never made the Blood Orange connection until now.

**violentovernightrush** (10): i love this song so much, empress of RUINED MY LIFE the first time i heard it, whoever submitted it please be my friend (also if anyone can tell me which of blood orange's other songs sound like this, let me know, because none do, and that sucks cause i love best to you so much)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): I know people throw out the word pop perfection so much that it’s practically lost all its meaning but that bridge and the buildup afterwards? Masterpiece

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): This song grows on me the more I listen to it, it's not something for everyday listening but when you really get into it, it hits different

**bandnitos** (9): this song is so goddamn good how have i never heard it before

**junobeekeeper** (9): Dev Hynes is SUCH a good producer and it really shines in this song especially. Blood Orange soundtracks my summers. Also, guest appearance by Empress Of!

**vayyiqra** (9): I knew I recognized Empress Of's voice! I love her music. Blood Orange has produced so many of my favourite artists and I haven't given him much of a chance on his own, but I will now, because this is great. Their voices work together so well, the melody is  neat, and the percussion adds something really unique. This song is amazing!

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): "I feel my bones crack in your arms"--An ode to overcoming osteoporosis in the name of love

**Chevsapher** (8.4): That marimba-sounding bit is awesome.

**anothertown** (8): woooow what a great drop

**camerinian** (8): ok this is actually a real bop. Maybe I should finally actually listen to Blood Orange at some point, since that name seems to be fucking everywhere

**DaHumanTorch** (8): ooo this was a good chill bop, i loved the production on this.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): good song but missed opportunity to choose the song with Carly from this album

**wavingwolves** (8): please stream freetown sound

**Mysario** (7.9): I think I accidentally played this song once on one of those xylophones when I was waiting at the doctor's office

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is alright, it's kind of cute.


##**Empress Of Bad Taste**


**Leixander** (7.5): beautifully produced but i wish it built up to something more vibrant

**\_wailordfan** (6): I saw them live last year when I saw Florence and the Machine, and I think I prefer the studio version to them live, but their style isn't really my style.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): nice, but didn’t really leave an impact

**SteelStepladder** (6): It's not my type of music but it's still decent

**kappyko** (5): why is blood orange really fucking good when he doesnt ruin songs with his shit falsetto. god bless empress of
