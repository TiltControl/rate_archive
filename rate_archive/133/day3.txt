**bigbigbee** (7): Oh yeah…The Jeffrey Dahmer era of pop music. That was weird

**seanderlust** (6.5): a little 3 edgy 5 me

---

## Fava beans and a nice chianti

**1998tweety** (10): iconic halloween bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): the Jeffrey Dahmer lyric 👀

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I’m glad this slightly blew up on TikTok because damn what a song. Also that bridge is just excellence.

**Awkward\_King** (10): deserves to win the rate lbr

**endcreditouilles** (10): a song about cannibalism that specifically mentions anus??? It's about time

**frogaranaman** (10): https://i.imgur.com/YPrpdNc.jpg

**grey/0x976** (10): IIIIIIIIIII. AMMMMMM. CANNIBALLLLL.

**hikkaru** (10): if tiktok (the app) was a thing in 2010 kesha would be the doja of it and have every song she releases go viral

**ImADudeDuh** (10): IIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIII AAAAAAAAAAAAAAMMMMMMMMMM CANNIBAL CANNIBAL CANNIBAL I AM

**nooodisaster** (10): This was my secret fav from the EP (i have no idea why we're rating 3 songs from the EP and only 3 songs and not even the 3 singles), so y'all better not pay this dust. Yes she refers to herself as an infamous serial killer, it's camp :janet:

**nootnoot781** (10): it’s cam-[GUNSHOT]

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this track goes SO much harder than I remember like holy shit

**sage** (10): tiktok dances

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): eating people is a girlboss move

**Stryxen** (10): ate up teenage dream its true

**throwaway7650** (10): actually robbed from the tiktok rate but that one line :peloton:

**UselessTacooo** (10): certified bussy bop

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the best written song of all time

**outsideeyess** (9.6): the product of a mother-daughter writing session. gotta love Pebe <3

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): Jeffrey Dahmer? Lecter Hannibal? Whatever, this song is dedicated to them.

**anothertown** (9): https://ibb.co/tc7q3cT

**IIIHenryIII** (9): can I still call myself straight if I bop to this?

**moooo566** (9): it sounds like cat nipple

**nyoom** (9): poll for popheads: who's the male rapper most likely to unironically write the line "but now that i'm famous you're up my anus"?

**skargardin** (9): RAWR

**teenwitches** (9): the grip this had on tiktok cosplayers was insane

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): It's kinda funny and ironic how this is the Kesha song that blew up on Tik Tok (the app), but the actual song called Tik Tok hasn't.

**waluigiest** (9): i am cat nipple (cat nipple) i eat you up

**akanewasright** (8): I’m glad a non-Luke song blew up on TikTok tbh

**apatel27** (8): sweet synth beat

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): She ATE

**daythreeinmiami** (8): The lyrics really are a serve aren’t they. I also lived that she really wanted to prove that she really could sing that ‘ohh oh wa ohh’ in the Tik Tok chorus in the bridge.

**Uberpigeon** (8): armie hammer type beat

**cherryices** (7.9): how many hannigram fanvids are set to this

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Jennifer’s Body did it better

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): this takes me back

**hielord** (7.4): Armie Hammer outsold

**jman457** (7.3): Some fun lines

**macnbee** (7): AND FOR DISSURT I SUCK YOUR TEATS

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i will admit a western pop girl making a song about being a cannibal is definitely an interesting concept. unfortunately i spent my entire adolescence listening to demented vocaloid songs and at least 10 of them were about cannibalism to some degree so this is nothing i havent heard before

**thePotatofairyy** (7): the second half is a lot better than the first.

**shhhneak** (6.9): These wild lyrics… did Kreayshawn pass on this song?

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): the lyrics are kinda disgusting

**CrimsonROSET** (6): endorse cannibalism

**duochromepalmtree** (6): don’t get me wrong, when this song comes on I go absolutely feral. But is it a good song? Meh not really.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Did not expect the horror themes honestly lol

**xavieryes** (6): i can't form an opinion on this

## Brussel sprouts and a 4 Loko

**jsonphile** (4): some great lines in here, but overall just a bit too annoying

**vayyiqra** (4): I could do without the vore, or the word "anus". This time I can't ignore the awful lyrics.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This somehow has one of the worst choruses in the entire rate.

**TiltControls** (2.5): i guess she's just a 21st century vampire

**fadedblue09** (1.5): I'm a vore kinkshamer sorry

**bigbigbee** (9.5): That pre-chorus is godly. Rihanna should break Drake's heart more often, they make bangers together.

**seanderlust** (6.8): if I had a nickel for every time in this rate I've had to forgive a mid verse from Drake because I like the singer's input, I'd have two nickels. which isn't a lot but it's weird that it's happened twice

---

## Quickly understood the "ate something" joke

**cremeebrulee** (11): a classic!!! drake’s verse is great, rihanna sounds super adorable, and i think it's a great example of a song that sounds of the era it's from. it really just transports me back to middle school. there's this obsession on the sub about how songs will "age", but i think this track is a good subversion of the "aging = bad" take because sure it doesn't sound like anything now, but it's just as enjoyable

**xavieryes** (11): One of my top 3 favorite Rihanna songs, if not my favorite. Everything about this song is simply perfect.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This song would be 2:23 in length if released in 2021

**akanewasright** (10): this song is the most fun out of the Drake/Rihanna collabs I think. It’s just… lighthearted and delightful and I have no choice but to love that

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I still listen to this song on the regular. It really is one of those songs that when you first listen to it, you know that it will be a common feature on your playlists for the rest of your life. It's the perfect song and the production of this song is just super stellar. And her vocals are so fjioiihruouo yes Rihanna slay me. A real classic timeless song. But W H Y BOTH my CD and Spotify censor the word ‘weed’ in Drake’s opening verse I’ll never freaking know.

**emayzee** (10): god i miss this era of drake

**frogaranaman** (10): the square root of 69 is 8.30662386 actually 

 edit: nevermind I just realized I missed the pun

**ignitethephoenix** (10): now why did they censor the word weed when Drake literally says “the square root of 69 is 8/ate”

**jackisboredtoday** (10): invented mathematics

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a banger, and one of my favourite drake verse's

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Oh na na-ing intensifies

**nyoom** (9.5): if anyone ever asks you "what's my name" you are legally obligated to rename them Farto

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Drake's verse here is… not good… but the rest of the song is such a serve I don't really care

**teenwitches** (9.5): drake really does his hardest to ruin this one

**wavingwolves** (9.1): best rihanna/drake collab apart from SLAY CARE that song is too amazing

**anothertown** (9): this has not shrunk an inch!

**ImADudeDuh** (9): boppity bop

**Iris3271** (9): The square root of 69 is the best bar Drake ever dropped and I will not elaborate

**jsonphile** (9): “square root of 69 is 8 something” wow this Drake guy sure is corny I can’t imagine he’s gonna be relevant for much longer after this song

**nooodisaster** (9): when drake made good music. their chemistry is so good ill forgive drake for thinking he ever had a chance w her.

**plastichaxan** (9): superior drake collab (and only good one tbh)

**hielord** (8.8): This is one of those songs I only like because of one specific part, but HEY BOY I REALLY WANNA SEE IF YOU CAN GO DOWNTOWN WITH A GIRL LIKE ME slaps so hard.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I still don't get the title

**nootnoot781** (8.3): squared rounded to the nearest whole number

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8.3): The square root of 69 rounded to the nearest tenth

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I remember really loving this song when it came out but good God Drake is heavily featured and his contributions to the song are horrible.

**fadedblue09** (8): This sounds a little dated than I remembered (that percussion is ugly), but Rih delivers

**moooo566** (8): wish he wasn't on this :/

**waluigiest** (8): this song is definitely an 8 something

**throwaway7650** (7.5): I always found this overrated and not anywhere near rihanna's best singles. bonus point for the square root line

**jman457** (7.2): More toned down than the rest of album even if the island influence is cool

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): i love this one a LOT back then

**apatel27** (7): Drake being the corny guy he is as usual

**Awkward\_King** (7): looking at the half filled ballot i had im now adapting for my finished ballot and apparently i thought it was a funny joke here to just doxx my full name AJKSDKJA

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): UMA!!! Say it lou- Oh wait, wrong song again! Sorry!

**TiltControls** (6.5): rihanna

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Inside you there are two wolves: one thinks Rihanna’s real name is ‘onana’ / the other replied to the chorus as if it was call and response with ‘Rihanna’. Both wolves were me at 12.

**rotating3Dtext** (6): drake’s rap sucks

**Stryxen** (6): i can see why you might love this song but there’s a whole lot of nothing here

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): If I pretend that Drake does not exist it’s a 7

## took several years to understand the "ate something" joke

**macnbee** (5): oh nana…wasmanay

**shhhneak** (5): Drake slander.

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is one of those 2010s songs that ive just heard too many times in my life and have at no point particularly liked so . im both tired of it and have no nostalgia for it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I assumed Drake would be my least favorite part of this song but honestly this beat is pretty obnoxious and it’s a minute too long. Chorus is catchy at least.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): why is drake even on this he adds literally nothing

**UselessTacooo** (3): I understand why this was popular when it came out, but it does not hit the same as it once did.

**thePotatofairyy** (2): Catchiness in pop songs either make a song fantastically fun or painfully annoying. I was never able to find this song fun.

**sage** (1): this song is actually so annoying

## ...but actually, it took me over a decade to get it

**skargardin** (10): The "the square root of sixty nine is eight something, right?" line JUST registered for me even after hearing this song what must've been hundreds of times im

**ReallyCreative** (8): why does Drake have to be so annoying on this song

**bigbigbee** (7): And with that, Nicki is down to one song. At the same time, there was never much risk of this not being Day 3, save for a few early ballots. This song is buoyed by both nostalgia (being one of the main singles back in 2010 – I recall the MV being huge) and modern hype (via trending on Tik Tok). Drake sounds nice on this, in my opinion; his style has definitely evolved since then (which is neither a good nor a bad thing), but I personally really like the way he raps on songs recorded back then.

## Michigan and Wisconsin in the 2020 US Presidential Election

**1998tweety** (10): the first verse into the chorus is incredibly iconic

**2dina3dworld** (10): I’m gonna be a Gen Zer and say that I know this song from Tik tok and thought it was a recent Nicki release

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It’s a little annoying but I don’t want it to seem like I’m sabotaging the album so I’m giving this a ten

**CrimsonROSET** (10): jaida look over there.gif

**davgonp** (10): Obligatory ten despite Nicki’s actions. I can’t describe how this song makes me feel. I sort of feel “betrayed” because of what Nicki has been doing recently. I wish I could have that moment for life…

**endcreditouilles** (10): Nicki and Drake at their best

**frogaranaman** (10): god, I wish Drake would get back in this kinda bag for his new music

**grey/0x976** (10): me and my friends watching this mv so much to the point where we had every scene hand gesture expression etc memorized

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorites from Nicki, I think this is the song that got me into her. Drake was great here too

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the singles on this album are so obvious

**sage** (10): smash

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song was so iconic when it came out

**throwaway7650** (10): vastly outsold the other drake collab here

**UselessTacooo** (10): the vibe this song has is unmatched. Is it bombastic? No, but it has that slow bop feeling that we need in more rap songs.

**nyoom** (9.5): drake: make me look like caesar / me: drake has terf bangs

**akanewasright** (9): This song grew on me greatly after [Wisconsin and Michigan turned blue in the 2020 election](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CLj2r7ubVsU)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): i liked this one until I did not.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Definitely the better Drake feature in this rate. I’m not usually a fan of slower Nicki Minaj songs but the vibe of this one is so good.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): in 2010 we were just drinking and trying to hold on to every glimmer of happiness in a world that felt very uncertain and this song perfectly encapsulates that feeling. And this was back when it was actually exciting to hear drake on a feature.

**Iris3271** (9): Nicki and Drake in this era were top tier

**outsideeyess** (9): this chorus is kinda a buzzkill but the verses are sooo good

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): when I would play this after every life achievement I accomplished in middle school

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Chorus is super limp and does not need to be repeated a hundred times but otherwise it's decent

**jsonphile** (8.5): I can only now associate this song with the meme that took the line “clap for the heavyweight champ: me. but I couldn’t do it all alone: we” and they used it to change Michigan (MI) and Wisconsin (WI) from red to blue during election week but whoever made it didn’t realize that the boot part of Michigan is part of Michigan not Wisconsin

**anothertown** (8): idk i kind of poohascend

**Awkward\_King** (8): oui

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This is a good song I just can’t get over that both artists in this song are now basically well known to be utter trash these days so really irony once again takes over here and I yeah, you probably now do wish more than ever that y’all could have had that moment for life.

**waluigiest** (8): there’s something so endearing about the 2010 nicki/drake combo

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): never been a big fan of the chorus

**nooodisaster** (7): very of-the-times but the mv was iconic and as always it's hilarious to see drake's hopeless & doomed pining

**rotating3Dtext** (7): it is kinda boring

**TiltControls** (7): I wish there was a bit more to this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): NICKI STOP RUINING YOUR SONGS WITH SINGING YOU CAN'T SING!!!! Also omg Drake actually sounds good here?? Pigs have truly flown

**apatel27** (6): How is Drake gonna eat you up on your own track

**Stryxen** (6): the verses ate but what is that chorus omg DO SOMETHING MOVE

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): I would give it a higher score, but Drake ruins the song for me.

**seanderlust** (10): Our first out in the top fifteen is Animal’s title track, which admittedly was a bit of a surprise to me (though not today’s biggest surprise IMO! :mischief:). Animal is a euphoric close to the main album and symbolizes music that Kesha wishes she could have done more of with her debut album. Twinkling synths build during the verse to a fast-paced, almost DnB-esque drumbeat that shows up on the chorus, which comes together with Kesha’s voice to produce a feeling of catharsis - the world is spinning at the speed of light, but take Kesha’s hand and dance anyways. The accompanying video is what I would call a Keshafied version of Taylor Swift’s “Style” - a series of striking shots with blinding lights, limb-heavy dancing and hairography aplenty. In this rate, Animal quickly settled itself into a solid mid-teens position, and never strayed too far from there. Your reactions ranged from some folks really loving it to some folks finding it forgettable. Both are valid takes! Music is fun because it’s subjective. What’s also fun is that this song was later sampled by 2 Chainz.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): This song was on the border of Day 1/Day 2 for many ballots, so I was pleased to see it rise up to a solid Day 1 position as the late ballots started to come in. This is a flavor of early 2010s electronic music that I find easy to listen to; it’s pretty and optimistic. A great closer for the original (non-deluxe) version of this album.

---

## Animals

**throwaway7650** (11): this song is just magical, it sounds so sparkly but still cohesive within animal and is the perfect closer to the standard edition of the album. the chorus is so anthemic (this song is in general) and uplifting, I'm choosing to look past dr. luke on the credits because of how much this song embodies kesha + her fandom, the animals (2010 animal checking in - but I'm saving storytime for my album comment :mischief:). anyway, this is one of the best songs in the rate for me and I really hope this can at least make it into day 2

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Went off

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the best thing about being a Kesha stan is that I can give every single song a 10 and I won't get shit for doing so (stop swiftie opression!)

**nooodisaster** (10): Greg Kurstin producing the best song on the album, i know thats right. So basically when this album released, Kesha said this song was a hint at the music she wished she could make more of if she had the choice. I think she should be so proud of what she's done since this, as she's made so many songs that not only match this song's lyricism and emotion (which are 10s), but far exceed it.

**thePotatofairyy** (10): Fun and free spirited with a lot of heart in it. Honestly a perfect title track and closer. Fantastic production with great build up and cathartic elements.

**TiltControls** (10): Still one of my favourite Kesha songs

**waluigiest** (10): it’s certainly the most beautiful song on the album. It’s almost out of place with its tender lyrics, slow start, and genuineness. The pulsing chorus pulls it back into the Animal world, but it’s definitely an outlier that does an excellent job at concluding the project.

**xavieryes** (10): strong 11 candidate

**xxipil0ts** (10): I forgot how good this song is! I wanna rip my heart out with this song!

**1998tweety** (9.5): this gives off perfect album closer energy, another potential single

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): this song reigned supreme in 2010 year-end compilation videos

**jman457** (9.3): Cool production

**akanewasright** (9): This song like… singlehandedly set the tone for Kesha’s fanbase. Not the sleeze, not the pervasive cultural appropriation (especially with the Native American headdresses, girl…), but a moment of sincerity and celebrating people for being who they are.

**apatel27** (9): Perfect closer to the album

**Awkward\_King** (9): this has the energy of a bad song but like its good ?????

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): Another non-stop song! The chorus is EUPHORIC. I also like the verse lyrics that are very carpe diem.

**jsonphile** (9): this is a Katy Perry song better than most Katy Perry songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i always forget how GOOD this song is omg get it onto a YA drama immediately

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): The second best title track in the rate. Also technically the worst title track in the rate.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): This sounds like it could be a Katy song. Like it totally sound like it could be from teenage dream. I'm not mad at it though. Not at all.

**outsideeyess** (8.1): i probably would like this song a lot more if there was like a live rock version

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): cool

**skargardin** (8): We love a solid pop ballad

**UselessTacooo** (8): This really sounds like a Katy Perry song. I’m curious if she had any influence on the track (songwriting etc.).

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): the Billboard Remix would be a BIG 10

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): this isn’t bad but it’s just some how the most generic song on this album. The rest of this album is very much the Kesha personality, this could really be any pop girl

**CrimsonROSET** (7): DCOM ending song (derogatory)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ironic how the title track of the album is the one thats least indicative of the album’s sound

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I like this song quite a bit, but I wish the arrangement wasn’t as poppy. I think it would have been more effective with a more stripped back production

**Stryxen** (6.7): this sounds like something from the indie pop rock bonus rate

**sage** (6.5): cute

**wavingwolves** (6.5): this is very okay

**duochromepalmtree** (6): my friends always loved this song but it’s just okay for me. Put your love is my drug back on

## Plants

**nyoom** (5.5): i'd listen to this happily for one (1) minute. why was this the title track?

**fadedblue09** (5): On paper, this is actually a decent song but her pitiful attempts at injecting emotions into her own voice just ruin it for me. Sorry

**frogaranaman** (5): totally blanked on this song the second after I finished listening to it

**macnbee** (5): I literally can never remember what this sounds like until I hit play again

**Uberpigeon** (3.5): aurora outsold

**daythreeinmiami** (3): But like I don’t like songs like this I’m sorryyyyyy not sorry. It’s just so generic and boring to me.

## Good Kesha be like: got jesus on my neck-a-lace, us, us

**1998tweety** (10): BOP

**AHSWeeknd** (10): R for Rihanna 😌

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): great song all-around

**celladonn** (10): HOT AND DANGEROUS

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I really didn’t think this woman could slay me as much as she did in 2010 but then she was like ‘lol I’m not done’ and released this and I literally died. The end.

**endcreditouilles** (10): how in the world does she make "selling our clothes, sleeping in cars" sound sexy and fun

**hikkaru** (10): one of my fave songs to drunk-sing

**IIIHenryIII** (10): a ten is a ten

**ImADudeDuh** (10): does anyone remember that tiktok account that would put their dog(?)’s face in random things every day to this song going “hot and DANGEROUS”?

**joeeswift** (10): this song is for rexhars and bad bitches only

**nootnoot781** (10): this is the gay anthem that born this way tries to be

**outsideeyess** (10): who would want to mess with someone who's got Jesus on their neck-a-luss-uss-oss?

**plastichaxan** (10): the feeling i get from this song aaaaa i cant describe but we really r who we r huh

**skargardin** (10): No other song captures the essence of 2010s pop music better

**throwaway7650** (10): I yassed so hard to this song/MV in elementary school

**xavieryes** (10): another iconic classic

**wavingwolves** (9.8): this chorus was laced with something... i'm still trying to find out what...

**akanewasright** (9.5): I have a really distinct memory of hearing this song on the radio when I was in Pittsburgh on vacation, and I have some nostalgia for any song I heard there. Plus it’s one of Kesha’s most infectious and positive raps, and I kinda just love that

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I may have dragged her through the mud for this rate, but honestly this is such a great song, and I cannot deny she has done a lot for the LGBT community. No-bridge edit when

**sage** (9.5): yassssss bridge slay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up up

**teenwitches** (9): dj turn it up-dup-dup-dup-dup-dup-dup

**TiltControls** (9): falls in the Firework camp of 'cheesy, but still a bop so idc'

**vayyiqra** (9): After hearing this I miss the age of "scene" now.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.7): "'Cause we make the hipsters fall in love" Kesha left r/indieheads on read in 2010

**apatel27** (8.5): Tiktok but with good lyrics

**duochromepalmtree** (8.5): being a freshman in college when this came out was awesome

**Awkward\_King** (8): idk who i am

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wait a minute who ARE you

**hielord** (8): arr arr arr

**jman457** (8): A bop even though it screams 2010 wish is basically her album

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): honestly the strangle kesha had on the charts back then

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the verses on this song but the chorus always falls a bit flat for me

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): we hittin on dudes… HARD

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Of the 2010/2011 I-love-my-gay-fans songs, this one has more personality than Fireworkand is more tounge-in-cheek than Born This Way, BUT it doesn't sound like Express Yourself, which I guess is the trade-off

**shhhneak** (7.1): Listening to this took 10 years off my life.

**frogaranaman** (7): irrational annoyance at this song because I have cringy memories to it but song slaps

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Why does she sound like a pirate in the chorus? We Argh Who We Arrgh!

**UselessTacooo** (7): a perfect club banger aside from that “turn it upupupupup” part that sounds like she’s having a seizure.

**waluigiest** (7): this song debuted at #1 back when that was extremely difficult, kesha won!!

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Not my favorite self help / vaguely it's okay to be gay anthem of the early 2010s, especially that bridge YIKES. But it inspired the iconic handle @iiswhoiis so it gets a few points for that

## Evil Kesha be like: got judas on my brace-a-let, ut, ut

**nyoom** (5): this is a very "get your drinks and pee now" song. that's not a bad thing, necessarily, i mean a telos is a telos, but if i want a bio break i can just pause my music

**Stryxen** (5): its fine

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): tik tok’s less interesting and more boring sister

**macnbee** (4): not quite as bad as that logic song re: musical attempt to engage with self-harm (we r who we r was written in the wake of several gay teen suicides), but still pretty obtuse imo

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I still don’t believe that this song ever reached #1… I have no recollection of hearing this at all as a kid

**thePotatofairyy** (3): Notably less catchy than previous singles.

## Timbaland fans

**1998tweety** (10): i originally gave the other songs in the bonus rate a 10 but I had to adjust them to 9s cause this song is on a whole nother level

**2dina3dworld** (10): disregard everything I said about Katy’s vocals over the course of this rate, this goes hard and Katy sounds super good in this

**akanewasright** (10): This is just comforting and warm and I sorta wish it was main rate

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song raised me, and if i could give an 11 in the bonus it would be to this. this song taught me to walk. to write. to express myself. i would not be the person i am today without this song and it should be the national anthem.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This is a real underrated 2010 banger and I’m really sad that it didn’t get bigger then what it was. I think it charted well here in Australia but this really was a solid song from Timbaland and Katy. Also Carry Out that he did with Justin Timberlake is a banger that I want played at my funeral.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): would’ve given it my 11 if it had been in the regular rate. Such a perfect song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): absolute classic

**RandomHypnotica** (10): if this doesn't win there is no justice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is so underrated from this era it's fucking amazing

**TiltControls** (10): do I really dislike the rest of the bonus songs so much, or am I just comparing them to this masterful track. Timbaland rate when

**TragicKingdom1** (10): legitimately one of her best lol

**apatel27** (9.5): Classic Timbaland

**jsonphile** (9.5): actually better than anything on teenage dream don’t @ me. Timbaland is just such a good producer

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this one is for king

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the outro ruins it

**plastichaxan** (9): this unlocked such a deep memory wtf

**thePotatofairyy** (9): Timbaland needs to come back. This is a hidden gem in Katy's discography. She sounds great here

**wavingwolves** (8.9): timbaland we love you

**outsideeyess** (8.8): it's so messy autotune-wise but I have such a nostalgia for this song because I covered it with my best friend as a kid. i do not percieve the outro

**fadedblue09** (8.5): This would be okay if...Timbaland didn't sing

**BeauMeringue212** (8): one of the worst music videos and the vocals sound weirdly underwater, but idc it's catchy still

**frogaranaman** (8): the Shock Value series is some good ass pop music

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Katy Perry features pre-Teenage Dream were immaculate

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): fine I guess

**awhile2** (7): iconic music video but the song itself is just ok

**throwaway7650** (7): timbaland should #not sing

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): Timbaland probably shouldn’t sing (he’s fine rapping & legendary producing but that first sung verse is rough)

**macnbee** (6): this is the only one I had never heard before the rate and you know what? Not bad

## The Neptunes outsold

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This is gonna sound really mean but… why didn’t they get a better singer for this song?

**seanderlust** (11): this is the one song in this rate that entered my playlists in 2010 when it came out...and never left. this is sincerely one of my favorite pop songs of all time, and if you were at a gay party in 2010 and someone played this and you saw the way the twinks lost their MINDS?? you would understand why. it's driving, it's dirty, it's sweaty, it's a filthy hot mess. it's not glamour, and it knows it - it's the pop equivalent of a mosh pit. it's an ode to being drunk and broke and hot and i love it so very much.

---

## Goes hardcore, has glitter on the floor

**grey/0x976** (11): if you picture a bi chilean boy on the middle school bus at 7 am looping this song on his shitty ipod shuffle in 2010 you will see me

**thePotatofairyy** (11): Another fantastic earworm. Has not worn thin a decade later. Just pure, trashy, campy fun

**1998tweety** (10): slut bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): I love stripper bops, makes me feel like I do exciting things

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Kesha sampling a song that’s over 100 years old is what the music industry needs to do more often

**Awkward\_King** (10): menmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmenmen

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I can’t believe I hated this back in the day. I had so much to learn…

**CrimsonROSET** (10): roddy ricch when he sees you wearing shoes in his house

**endcreditouilles** (10): me after half a glass of wine

**IIIHenryIII** (10): one of those songs where the pre-chorus is better than the actual chorus, but somehow it's not disappointing

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is an eleven worthy song tbh. This goes so fucking HARD

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I hated this so much when it was new but I flipped so hard on it I truly do want to write an essay one day on how great it is. It offends traditional sensibilities with how intense that first blast of autotune is and it attracts only those who want to enjoy its gritty, glittery, all-inclusive party

**plastichaxan** (10): this was such a collapse, the voice effects turned me into the hyperpop f- fan that i am today

**RandomHypnotica** (10): When I first heard this song I remember thinking it was the most explicit song ever… now I bop my head listening to hyperpop bitches tell me to lick their clit

**skargardin** (10): IT'S A DIRTY FREE FOR ALL

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the way i was OBSESSED with this music video

**teenwitches** (10): the sample on this shouldn't work but it absolutely bangs

**throwaway7650** (10): this chorus is arguably the best of the animal singles but it isn't getting my 11 unfortunately as the chants in the bridge get old real quick

**UselessTacooo** (10): Possibly my favourite Kesha song oop. It’s really fun and it aged a lot better than the rest of the album.

**wavingwolves** (10): this song exudes a deadly amount of bisexual energy so be warned before you listen or else you might turn into one of us

**xavieryes** (10): back in 2010 I never imagined the lyrics "got my drunk text on, I'll regret it in the mornin', but tonight, I don't give a-, I don't give a-, I don't give a-" would eventually become so painfully relatable

**akanewasright** (9.5): I remember that my mom had to explain to me why I couldn’t sing Tik Tok on the playground. She didn’t have to explain why I couldn’t sing this one.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): glitter bomb anthem

**sage** (9.5): slay

**BeauMeringue212** (9): I'd like to keep it on please

**frogaranaman** (9): it's cold as fuck here right now but I will another time Kesha

**nooodisaster** (9): Ugh so good Kesha really was a freak and people couldn't handle it.

**vayyiqra** (9): What will it take to make you capitulate? Wrong song ... or is it? That's because this melody is borrowed from "The Streets of Cairo", the stock "vaguely Middle-Eastern" melody. That's your musicology lesson for today. Anyway: party, drunk, glitter, naked. You get the idea. Peak Kesha..

**duochromepalmtree** (8): when I was seventeen I would go to this club in DC that was ALWAYS playing this song and I truly thought I was living inside of a cobrasnake photo album

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): a couple summers ago i used to work with this guy at a pet store and he said this was his favorite song of all time so this one goes out to you pet-store-coworker-i-dont-remember-the-name-of

**waluigiest** (8): I have a distinct memory of having a saxophone lesson and the girl before me realized her exercise was just the chorus to this song so then we all just started jamming to Kesha

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): This sounds like something that could be in a disney movie. Like I could see this being in "Descendants" or something.

**jman457** (7.1): Cool music video, kind of eh song

**shhhneak** (7): This is a Halloween anthem change my mind.

**nyoom** (6.5): "She explained that the song came about when she was out one night and was visiting a transsexual bar, stating, 'I have a song ... called 'Take It Off' about when I went to a drag show, and how really turned on I was by these transvestite men taking clothes off. I was like, What does that even make me?'" normal probably

**hielord** (6): I'm not a fan of the sampling on this song tbh

**Stryxen** (6): this bass would make me feel sick if i heard it in a club but anyways kinda slaps

**Uberpigeon** (6): these vocals are...camp!

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Yeah I definitely did not comprehend “They turn me on when they take it off” as a kid

## Goes softcore, is actually quite cleanly

**daythreeinmiami** (4): I don’t like this song too much I dunno. It just never did it for me. Aha I forgot about when saying ‘ehrrybody’ was the rage.

**TiltControls** (4): a great descriptor of the energy for both underground clubs and 24h fast food places after the bars close

**anothertown** (3): lazy

**jsonphile** (3): nope sorry this is just annoying

**fadedblue09** (2): eww what is this. serving early 2010s nugu kpop group teas

**ReallyCreative** (10): What a journey this song went through, out of the gate, in danger of going out day 1! It climbed pretty consistently though and was able to make a respectable top 15 finish.

**seanderlust** (7.8): the anthem of so many teens and young adults in the early 2010s making godawful life choices. god love it. this song is fun! while it can occasionally feel a little formulaic and some of the lyrics haven't aged very well (the "epic fail" line is uh...camp), it's overall an upbeat bop celebrating bad decisions

**bigbigbee** (5.5): Parties are so disappointing compared to what I thought they’d be like, based on 2010 music videos. This is Katy Perry at her corny best; the good version of Swish Swish. (THAT was such an epic fail.) 

 Shoutout to Rebecca Black in the MV; back then, I thought that it was so nice that Katy Perry offered her the chance to be in the video, considering the relentless hate she was getting online.

---

## lass frooby noo

**hielord** (11): The guitar riff, or however is called, at the start of the song just hits the right spot for me. It's pure 2010s pop, and the lyrics have surprisingly aged well. Oh, and THAT SAX! Timeless bop.

**1998tweety** (10): shes fun

**2dina3dworld** (10): this used to make me feel so edgy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Rebecca Black is a pop music ICON idc idc. And Kenny G honestly snapped here.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I really was not prepared for this album, emotionally or physically. I had no idea how much I could dance around my room to this song because I had no friends and I really had to use my imagination. Like I said I wasn’t prepared emotionally or physically.

**hikkaru** (10): i was obssessed with the mv back when it released she was crazy for that

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the use of just dance in this was iconic and I can’t believe it took a decade after the video for this song to finally be in a Just Dance game itself.

**nootnoot781** (10): the epic fail line dates this song so badly 😭 still a bop though

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this MV felt like the original Infinity War

**shhhneak** (10): This song gets me together every time.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the way this was played at EVERY 16th birthday party i went to in 2011

**throwaway7650** (10): the grip the MV for this had on pop culture... katy also ahead of her time with the rebecca black redemption arc #weloveheragain

**TiltControls** (10): These are some of the worst lyrics I've ever heard but I love it (also I don't think I've heard the words 'Epic fail' outside this song in nearly 8 or 9 years)

**vayyiqra** (10): Here's another very specific memory I have: When I was 23 I lived with my dad before getting my own place and was early into my pop-pilling. I was bumping this song, and it seemed quiet so I turned it up. After a while I noticed that my earbuds weren't plugged in, so what I was hearing was the song at full volume! I felt cringe! It was late so I don't think anyone heard it. Now my dad is a boomer who likes rock, but he likes Lady Gaga, so maybe it wouldn't have been too weird that his college-aged son was sitting in the basement at midnight blaring Katy Perry. But still, you know? :zany:

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This song really shouldn’t work. It’s obnoxious, a bit gross, uses the phrase “epic fail” unironically… and yet it’s one of the most perfect party anthems of all time

**xavieryes** (10): a bop. also stream Rebecca Black Was Here.

**davgonp** (9.7): There’s something about this one -the combination of Rebecca Black, Kenny G and Just Dance- that we will never get to experience again.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): the saxophone on the edge of glory outsold

**teenwitches** (9.5): this song is like 90% of the criteria for getting diagnosed with alcohol addiction

**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): I'm glad I used to not care for this song because now that I'm an adult, this song is so relatable and a pure blast

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): my one brain cell screaming lass frooby noo

**awhile2** (9): - its crazy for me to see how many more plays this song has on spotify than teenage dream or california girls when this song didnt feel nearly as big as those songs at the time of its release

**Awkward\_King** (9): rebecca black!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! no but like actually so glad she is in the music video for this its so sweet

**cremeebrulee** (9): ok does anyone remember that facebook meme (i'm aging myself yes) that was like “rebecca black KILLED fridays but katy perry made them cool again?” why did i find that shit so funny

**duochromepalmtree** (9): the theme song of every bad decision I made at seventeen years old. Fully believed I had Katy’s permission to get blackout drunk and make out with various classmates.

**frogaranaman** (9): I remember the first time that I watched this music video I was like "oh, dope! I should find a rich friend to throw some rager at this looks fun" and now I can't even imagine cleaning up all of that mess afterwards. it's already terrible cleaning up after adults, I can't imagine cleaning up after literal teenage high schoolers

**jsonphile** (9): anything with a sax solo is a win for me. Absolute bop

**sage** (9): smasha

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): This would be a 10, but the horn solo is just... no.

**jman457** (8.6): Screw the haters in the discord; the music video is iconique. Also the guitar is so infectious.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): OK this is the first time I'm invoking camp on this rate lol. Seriously this was just fun and it's super catchy

**Iris3271** (8.5): The music video gets an eleven

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): this video really was the moment and elevates the song by like five points

**wavingwolves** (8.3): i love the music video for this because it's a perfect time capsule of what the early 00s were like

**emayzee** (8.2): im too much of an introvert for this song to truly hit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): pretty fine, but I would prefer the other no.1 songs instead

**ignitethephoenix** (8): okay but 14 year old me lived for this music video that had Rebecca Black, Darren Criss, Kevin McHale and Kenny G

**nyoom** (8): katy perry: i want it to be absolutely crystal clear that i don't know what a nerd is. if ONE PERSON watches this music video and says "haha, me" you're DONE

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): me at 10 years old in summer camp: why do all the girls laugh at me and look at me weird for singing this song. me 10 years later realizing what the lyrics are: ah

**waluigiest** (8): las frooby noo

**Stryxen** (7.5): i know i have a really important memory associated with this song from my youth but i’ve repressed that period of time so i can’t remember it and idk if it was positive or negative (i remembered it was because i love the simlish version and would 11 that)

**AHSWeeknd** (7): A great song, but it gets old quick

**CrimsonROSET** (7): three thoughts: the simlish version of this losing the bonus in VGV is very pleasing to me // rebecca black is a serve in the music video // that sax line

**nooodisaster** (7): undersold the sim-ish version

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): last friday night i just sat quietly browsing the internet until i got too bored to stay awake

**anothertown** (6.5): waking up in vegas outpeaked

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): do u think the phrase "epic fail" will ever return to the popular lexicon?

**cherryices** (5): remember when glee cast members showed up in every music video between 2011-14

**macnbee** (5): I reported the music video for terrorism

**fadedblue09** (4): This has always been my least favorite of her singles from this era, it just doesn't have the magic of the other singles and feels really annoying

**UselessTacooo** (4): It’s fine I guess? I get what she’s going for but nothing new or interesting is happening.

**apatel27** (3): What’s with the random beeps that sound like half a phone vibration in the chorus

**joeeswift** (1): I used to like this song until I listened to it on full blast and the saxophone part made my ears ache and ring for like 2 days

## SO true do Legendary MCs of the 2000s



**outsideeyess** (9.6): when i was a kid I thought this was the pinnacle of songwriting. as an adult, I realize it's literally just a list. the missy version would've gotten a higher score

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9): I like the Missy Elliott version, its the same song but with Missy Elliott at the beginning

**akanewasright** (8): Missy made this a 10

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): It's cute. Wish it was the Missy version. Still super catchy! Sax solo serves, sorry RAWM (which I gave an 11, relax lol)

**bigbigbee** (9): This song was as high as #5 on some middle-early ballots, and I was hoping that it would continue like that; I don’t think this song got as much play as the other promotional singles off of Loud, but I love how distinct it is from them; very cool, very dark.

**ReallyCreative** (8): A song that started just outside the top 5 and had a rough road to the finish line. In the last ballot, it dropped from 8 to 11, the only time after the first 5 ballots that it was outside of the top 10.

---

## You had the guuUUUNN

**babadork** (11): Love that she aims high and goes for Bob Marley when she wants to show how cool she is. Best beat of all of her reggae-inspired songs.

**companion\_star55** (11): one of my all time faves from her, still gives me chills up to this day

**letsallpoo** (11): i love this little murder fantasy set over an electronic reggae beat. it was such a fresh song to hear through the loud album era, and it's one of the best-aging songs in this rate overall

**plastichaxan** (11): this feels correct, the storytelling, this song truly transcends every other song in this rate to me

**skargardin** (11): This has a snowball's chance in hell of winning, but I would like to see it do the best it can. I have felt it being underappreciated as far as the Loud-era goes.

**UselessTacooo** (11): I’m obsessed. The song is so fun, catchy, and memorable. Please besties, don’t rob this song

**1998tweety** (10): I guess she did become a merderer

**anothertown** (10): Murder ballads are a very cool part of history!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): love killing men

**fadedblue09** (10): Can we just appreciate how even at her most "pop", Rihanna never neglects to dedicate a track to her Caribbean roots. Not to mention one of the best storytelling in her discography.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): lyrically the is my favorite song here, love the story telling here with the reggae vibe. I think this was the most interesting song she had made at this point

**IIIHenryIII** (10): subjectively this is a 9, but it doesn't feel right, so I'm giving it the full score. I mean… the production is perfect

**nooodisaster** (10): THE BEST SONG DUH

**nootnoot781** (10): slayyy (literally and figuratively)

**throwaway7650** (10): the best loud single I said what I said (pls make it to day 3)

**wavingwolves** (10): #fuckmen

**cremeebrulee** (9.8): next in the ph series of “raters robbing songs about murdering men”

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): this is as song I never remember really liking until I hear it and I go "wait, this is a bop"

**akanewasright** (9.5): Frankly if Rihanna killed someone, I’d assume she was right to do so.

**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): Bold song with great execution. It sounded so fresh back then and retains its freshness to this day

**emayzee** (9.3): a merderer.....

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): The way I could buy a full album of just Rihanna adlibs. Rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum, rum-pum-pum-pum. Anyway, aside from the direct reggae influence and Rihanna leaning into her Bajan accent; the very essence of this song, from the storytelling to the pacing, feels like it should be a VP Records early 80s deep cut. Sad sort of murder ballad that's so gripping to hear.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I never get sick of this song. It’s so sexy and fun even though it’s about murder.

**frogaranaman** (9): my dad absolutely loves to play the Sirius FM reggae channel whenever we go on road trips together and while I love reggae I fully associate it with being on at least six hour road trips and hearing it for at least three of those six hours. also it's channel 42 lmfao blaze it

**sage** (9): bop

**hielord** (8.7): Bohemian Rapsody who?

**outsideeyess** (8.6): the storyline is brilliant

**jsonphile** (8.5): okay if Rihanna shot me though I would probably thank her

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): unfortunately overshadowed by other bigger singles

**AHSWeeknd** (8): The beat ain’t it but it still goes off

**nyoom** (8): "i didn't mean to hurt him" "i just shot a man down in central station in front of a big ol crowd" https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wwGsZZN-YD4

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i think rihanna should be allowed to kill a man and get away with it

**waluigiest** (8): like literally?

**cherryices** (7.3): i shot a man down, but i didn’t shoot the deputy (she didn’t do it, she didn’t do it)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , heh-huh-hah-hih

**awhile2** (7): such an unconventional song for rihanna at this stage in her career. I love that she went for it though

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The story line in this song is really captivating. This song for sure grew on me through the course of it. I did enjoy this. I also loved the production too.

**vayyiqra** (7): omg i cant believe rihanna killed a man im crying im shaking why would rihanna do this she shot me im dead now :'(

**TiltControls** (6.5): the anthem for all stars day 1 eliminations

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): It's the rom pom pom pom's for me.

**endcreditouilles** (6): pop artists from 2010 i'm begging you to step away from the siren and air horn samples in songs, please, you're so sexy aha

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): ...isn’t this just Bohemian Rhapsody? But worse?

## Bang Bang (Their Baby Shot Them Down)

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): I don't like reggae and I don't condone murder even if both are simultaneously committed by a bad bitch :/

**astrologicalangel** (5): why does the beginning sound like I'm in a circus tent slowly being surrounded by cop cars

**Awkward\_King** (3): this feels kinda messy

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Oh this is definitely my most unpopular opinion in this rate. I’m sorry this just doesn’t sound good. Sad because I usually love murder songs.

**seanderlust** (10): Love the guitars here and the emotional delivery from Rih. MAAAYBE I'VE BEEN CALIFORNIA DREAMIIIINNN!!!

---

## California Kings

**duochromepalmtree** (11): the woman can fucking sing! This is the best song between the four albums hands down

**jsonphile** (11): I don’t know why I love this so much but I really do. Rihanna just sounds so good here, and a nice guitar solo with a fantastic bridge. Top 5 Rihanna song right here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): popheads end ur balladphobia!!! this is a fantastic song, so much emotion, great vocals UGHHH and fun fact it peaked at 3 in australia

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): see Only Girl (In The World) comment

**1998tweety** (10): she ate this up, whew that bridge

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Rihanna’s stylistic choices have changed drastically but damn if wasn’t a great era

**akanewasright** (10): Not to sound like a Swiftie, but this bridge? Perfection. Incredible switch up for the song, and easily brings this song to a 10, maybe even an 11. This was the best Rihanna had sounded to this point, and it’s still one of her best ballads

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Topped the charts in Poland and Slovakia see what happens when you make QUALITY MATERIAL.

**frogaranaman** (10): holy fuck those beds are huge

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Hold the fuck up? This song is so much better than I remember???? Holy shit what?? Why wasn’t this a smash hit??????

**jackisboredtoday** (10): i am going to campaign against balladphobia when this is robbed

**joeeswift** (10): her best song, top tier!!

**shhhneak** (10): Maybe THE supreme underrated Ri song. She’s singing for her life.

**skargardin** (10): a perfect pop ballad honestly

**throwaway7650** (10): this is a taylor swift song [non-derogatory] (wait when this and TIWYCF are on 1989 (taylor's version)... rih/tay collab finally OMG)

**UselessTacooo** (10): Rihanna’s ballads (pre-anti) are always overlooked, and I will not stand for it anymore. The use of electric guitar on this is masterful and invokes so much emotion. Yes I’m a slut for electric guitar. What about it?

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Yes!! Rock-ihanna!!

**xavieryes** (10): It's been a long time since I last listened to this song... and holy shit I don't remember it being this perfect?

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): This kinda warm, fuzzy guitar love song is never something I pictured Rihanna doing, but it works

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i always think big girls dont cry by fergie is starting when this plays and then it isnt but its ok i guess

**wavingwolves** (9.5): when that guitar comes in... it hits just right...

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): a great ballad

**fadedblue09** (9): The perfect song for the upcoming Fenty furniture line (what happened to that btw)

**macnbee** (9): we need the sequel: alaska king bed (it's real and sleeps four i.e. the whole polycule). but yeah the song is great

**nyoom** (9): "chest to chest, nose to nose, wrist to wrist, toe to toe" they HAVE to be exactly the same height or else this just cannot work. (junji ito redshirt voice) THIS IS THE PARTNER FOR ME! THIS IS MY PARTNER

**TiltControls** (9): definitely one of Rih's strongest ballads

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.8): We stan Power Ballad Rihanna. Please do rock and metal Rih, I beg!!!

**outsideeyess** (8.8): wait can THIS be R9's direction??

**apatel27** (8.5): God I love Rihanna’s voice

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): this would've been a #1 smash if a stronger vocalist sang it unfortunately

**jman457** (8.2): Melodramatic as hell

**celladonn** (8): I like the guitar on this

**IIIHenryIII** (8): the first verse is gross, and this is coming from someone who loves S&M. Sex good, make love bad.

**Iris3271** (8): This should've been a bigger hit

**slimboyfriend** (8): It's definitely a power ballad banger

**Stryxen** (8): lemme lie down and close my eyes and take this in

**waluigiest** (8): my intense desire to have a massive bed comes back to this song

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): yes it's schmaltzy but her belting sounds so good on the track

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): cute but it is a ballad I’m afraid

**emayzee** (7.3): this sounds like it could be from the hannah montana season 2 soundtrack

**babadork** (7): I love a power ballad, but the guitar solo is just meh.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): people sleep on this one (HA GET IT)

**hielord** (7): this sounds like a popular song but I can't quite remember which one ffs

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): apparently there was a character in jojos bizarre adventure named after this song? weird song to use in jojo but ok

**anothertown** (6): i hate power ballads

**daythreeinmiami** (6): This song. Her vocals are stunning. The production is good. But I just don't like slow ballad pop songs regardless of who is singing them. Unless they have a spicy flare to them like Demi Lovato's 'Tell Me You Love Me' or 'Stone Cold', I just don't vibe. Anyway. My bias aside, this is a solid heartfelt ballad from Rihanna and her vocals sound really good on this. Guitar is cool in the end.

**nooodisaster** (6): we get it rihanna u can afford expensive mattresses

**Uberpigeon** (5): mattress ad music

## Gets in for free, no VIP sleaze

**2dina3dworld** (11): it was between this and Take It Off for my 11, I chose this purely because it had more plays. It’s a bad bitch anthem for the ages, I have no idea what it’s about but it makes me feel like I’m doing [redacted] in a bathroom with a couple of equally off their head friends in a shady club.

**1998tweety** (10): bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): is this song just one big innuendo?

**akanewasright** (10): I had a dream once where a group of guys were hypnotized into becoming a boy band who did a cover of this as a dirge. Anyway I love this song

**anothertown** (10): if you get dr luke, max martin, AND benny blanco on the track together, i want to at least die

**CrimsonROSET** (10): [insert here a compilation of victorious characters dancing to this song but most specifically imgur.com/QFMbzuf.mp4]

**duochromepalmtree** (10): A timeless classic

**endcreditouilles** (10): songs to not sing along to in an airport

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this sub on rate reveal day

**ImADudeDuh** (10): gay ass music video

**metanoira** (10): the victorious episode was SO good

**sage** (10): YASSSSS THE SMASH

**throwaway7650** (10): paved the way for all the halsey pitchfork basement jokes/memes

**UselessTacooo** (10): I have no comment other than yasss queen moment

**wavingwolves** (10): forever haunted by the fact my ex once told me she would listen to this song a lot because kesha's laugh sounded just like mine

**xavieryes** (10): hahahahaha dance

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9.5): i fucking LOVED this song in 2011 and while it doesn't hard as hard as it used to, i can't deny the impact it had on me

**teenwitches** (9.5): throw some glitter make it rain is iconic

**hielord** (9.4): Halsey outsold

**BeauMeringue212** (9): I love that this video made James Van Der Beek's kids cringe lmao

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Not usually a fan of one word choruses but sometimes it really is all you need. (Okay technically it’s five words but you know what I mean)

**nooodisaster** (9): We stan a solo writing credit. Also I'm so excited for everyone who has somehow not watched the Blow music video to see it during the reveal, it's truly a work of art that should've gotten an Oscar that year.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): This version is good, but the Cirkut remix is superior!

**jman457** (8.4): Electropop at its best

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): good but not my type

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): This makes me think of James Van Der Beek and how much I miss Don't Trust the B in Apartment 23.

**frogaranaman** (8): why does Kesha sound so coked out in the bridge

**ignitethephoenix** (8): have this vague memory of reading a YouTube comment or something saying this song was about cocaine (cause blow is a nickname for cocaine)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): it is a banger i cannot lie

**TiltControls** (8): me to my n64 cartridges

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): the deconstructed mix >>>>

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): furry solidarity

**Stryxen** (7.5): this makes me feel insane actually

**macnbee** (7): it's only okay but the bridge ELEVATES IT

**thePotatofairyy** (6): Chorus is a miss but the rest of the song is great

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This just sounds like every other K-pop girl group song???

## Has to pay cover and coat check :(

**fadedblue09** (5.5): another song that I do not want to remember

**Awkward\_King** (5): not my fave

**Uberpigeon** (5): the only thing that blows is this song!

**nyoom** (4.5): my impression of ke$ha is that she got a lot of songs that were rejected by artists with more of a vested interest in their artistic reputations and i respect that but also this does kinda blow

**daythreeinmiami** (1): There is a reason I’m rating this song so low. It’s because this song has memories attached to it for me and I don’t want to talk about it please respect my privacy in these trying times thank you. Also it’s so boring imagine going from a 10 out of 10 song to this but here we are.

## One of the truest comments we received

**waluigiest** (9): this music video really captured what 2011 felt like

**bigbigbee** (10): And Katy (+ 3OH!3) falls just short of the bonus crown! It was very close. I think it’s appropriate that this and Bottoms Up were the songs fighting it out to the end; they represent two different, but equally prominent, flavors of party music. I would have been happy to see either win; both can get me bopping!

**seanderlust** (10): the absolute COLLAPSE this collaboration was.

**ReallyCreative** (1): I genuinely believe 3OH!3 was made by God to destabilize soceity, but they were as bad at that as they were at making music

---

##3OH!3 apologists

**2dina3dworld** (10): two out of three

**anothertown** (10): instant bonus rate victory if i ever saw one

**awhile2** (10): WANT is a 10/10 album for me and i will fight anyone who disagrees

**Awkward\_King** (10): god 3oh!3 are unparalleled when it comes to trashy misogynistic dance music but they fuck it up everytime

**endcreditouilles** (10): tbt to summer days, blasting this song at your local Hawaiian Falls waterpark with your besties from church group

**fadedblue09** (10): People who think Marina’s cover of this is better are Calum Scott/Ritt Momney stans

**frogaranaman** (10): banger, simply put

**ignitethephoenix** (10): 3OH3’s misogyny >>> Eminem’s misogyny

**IIIHenryIII** (10): one of the best songs ever made

**nootnoot781** (10): 30H!3 are good actually

**plastichaxan** (10): the way this song helped me practice my english ill thank it for that

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is easily 3OH!3's best work, it's just so good

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): A fine addition to the DoucheCore canon

**waluigiest** (10): Incredible but I fear Marina’s half tempo cover outsold

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the yass slay tea if i say so myself

**xavieryes** (10): this song is just fantastic, should've been the huge 3OH!3 hit instead of Don't Trust Me

**cherryices** (9.9): ahhh the ringtone for my hot pink razr

**hielord** (9.2): A BOP

**1998tweety** (9): BOP

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): ngl i liked the version without katy better

**teenwitches** (9): this one had the scene girls going crazy

**vayyiqra** (9): This is trash. 3OH!3 are losers. It's great!

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Katy Perry has dyed her hair back to black and now she needs to singlehandedly revive Warped Tour just to tour it again.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): Apple Music wrote the whistle in the lyrics as “wee-woo” and I just wanna know why

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): i enjoyed this one

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I actually do think Katy added a ton to this song and it’s much better than the original.

**macnbee** (8): when I was young I was too timid to actually criticize so re: this song I once said "3OH!3 seem like nice guys but I don't care for their music" and my classmate said "um no they definitely seem like assholes"…anyway 13 years later I love the song and know they're assholes. character development

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): maybe I've been LMFAOpilled but this is so loud, ugly and obnoxious and I love it.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): at least it's better than my first kiss...?

**akanewasright** (7): The catcalling reminds me of the wooting in Trina’s Pull Over and the whistling in Megan’s What’s New… it kinda got in my good graces by reminding me of better songs

**celladonn** (7): Anyone else remember when "nice legs daisy dukes" was a big meme on tumblr

**thePotatofairyy** (7): One of those songs where the verses are significantly more fun than the chorus but still a bop

**babadork** (6): Why does Katy Perry sound amazing on this weird song about catcalling?

**daythreeinmiami** (6): Why does the chorus sound like it’s going so fast compared to the rest of the song like damn bros why you in a rush? Oh yay this is uncensored! I’ve never heard Katy’s full line without ‘shit’ being censored.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): That verse does NOT deserve that chorus

##"Douchebag Lonely Island" antis

**BeauMeringue212** (5.8): it's still catchy but god I'm so embarrassed to have actually liked this and to still remember all the lyrics lol

**apatel27** (5): It’s fine I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): you can say “it’s camp” all you want but 3OH!3 has always kinda sucked

**jsonphile** (4): I have no idea what I’m supposed to feel listening to this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): the daisy dukes line plagued my early tumblr years and i want to forget about it

**bigbigbee** (10): Seanderlust picked the songs in the bonus rate, and I thank him immensely for introducing me to this; I’ve been looping it since I first heard it. It’s just the best version of that pop-rap goodness that r/popheads already celebrated back in June of this year. And it’s made even better by the fact that the “rap” part of this song is Nicki during the time where her features were batting a 100.

**ReallyCreative** (10): one of the fonder memories from high school

**seanderlust** (10): God I'm so glad we get to rate this

---

## CAN get that 'tron, that Remy, that coke, that Henny, AND that margarita on the rocks-rocks-rocks

**awhile2** (10): top 5 nicki verse for me. One of the first nicki verses i ever learned in its entirety

**duochromepalmtree** (10): this is a great song

**endcreditouilles** (10): blasting this when i want to go out to the club with friends and act unapologetically insane

**frogaranaman** (10): alternate title: r/popheads Up

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Nicki goes so hard on this. Her verse is definitely the reason why I love this song to death. Too bad she's a horrible human being.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): I’m sorry but this is maybe the best verse Nicki has ever done, its on par with Monster in every way

**jman457** (10): Nicki’s best ever guest verse

**macnbee** (10): EXCUSE ME IM SORRY IM REALLY SUCH A LADY

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): look i know the main reason to listen to this song is nicki's verse but trey delivers

**thePotatofairyy** (10): One of my fav songs from the time period. Song itself is great but Nicki's verse is something else. I swear I astral project everytime her part comes on

**waluigiest** (10): I do not recognize the person I was before I heard Nicki’s verse in this song.

**1998tweety** (9): iconic

**daythreeinmiami** (9): Who EVER organised this section of this rate let us have a chat real quick. Honey what are you doing? Like this song is lit I love it Nicki’s verse is literally what elevates this song. Rest in Peace to Anna Nicole Smith. But Nicki also did that on ‘Letting Go’ by Sean Kingston featuring her in 2010. But I do appreciate that it’s not Monster I thank you for that. But to not have Letting Go at least also included? Almost criminal. DUTTY DUTTY DUTTY LOVE LOVE I’M NEVER GONNA LET THIS GO. Yes I was shaking my booty while writing this.

**outsideeyess** (9): one of her best verses and it doesn't make any sense lmao. RIP anna nicole smith

**teenwitches** (9): this has to be top 10 nicki features, if not top 5

**wavingwolves** (8.7): 🧍

**celladonn** (8.5): IT'S MR STEAL YO GIRL

**plastichaxan** (8.5): the way there are songs i won't recognize until Nicki's verse comes in

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): how many people are gonna mix up trey songz with tory lanez again

**apatel27** (8): Harder than most of Pink Friday

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this is pretty much carried by Nicki, Trey was mediocre here outside the chorus

**throwaway7650** (8): oh this is where that nicki verse is from

**davgonp** (7.4): Her verse is alright.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): a classic

**anothertown** (7): Rest In Peace to Anna Nicole Smith

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Ugh I hate how the only thing I can think of is that video of Blackpink working at McDonalds

**akanewasright** (6.5): Honestly I don’t really like any part of this song much besides Nicki’s verse…… BUT WHAT A VERSE

**jsonphile** (6): why did me ever let Trey Songz be a thing and why do I still somehow know like every word of this song?

## X's on the back of their hands

**babadork** (4): Nicki is great on this, but I don't want any of the rest of it.

**BeauMeringue212** (4): now why was Anna Nicole Smith dragged into this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): why is she shouting out to a random dead girl

**bigbigbee** (9.5): Some of the lowest skill level of pop star dancing happening in this music video. aesthetics on point though. I love snoop dogg

**seanderlust** (7): it's bubblegummy and fun, but gets dragged down because it just feels a little too basic. also "the girl's a freak, she drives a jeep and lives on the beach" sounds like one of those AI-generated t-shirts that are advertised on facebook

---

## Fine, fresh, fierce, has it on lock

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): might lose followers over this, but needs to be said. i find it extremely disrespectful when people dont stand for the national anthem. as soon as you hear “Toned, tan, fit and ready Turn it up 'cause it's gettin' heavy Wild Wild West Coast These are the girls I love the most I mean the ones I mean like she's the one Kiss her, touch her, squeeze her buns The girl's a freak She drive a Jeep And live on the beach I'm okay I won't play I love the bait Just like I love LA Venice Beach and Palm Springs Summertime is everything Homeboys Bangin' out All that ass hangin' out Bikinis, zucchinis Martinis, no weenies Just the King and the Queeny Katy, my lady (yeah) Lookie here, baby (uh huh) I'm all up on ya Cause you're representin' California” you need to be OUT of your seat!

**1998tweety** (10): CLASSIC

**2dina3dworld** (10): Katy Perry Sweet Treats Stuff Pack teas

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Remember when Katy tried convincing us that the Super Bowl crowd knew the words to this?

**akanewasright** (10): When I first heard this song as a Young Person ™️ I thought stilettos were an underwear brand and was confused why anyone would be okay with that

**anothertown** (10): The boys break their necks

**Awkward\_King** (10): she lived she served california cunt she died

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was second place for my 11. The Beach Boys wish THEY WISH they had this power.

**celladonn** (10): Very much a bop

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Snoop Dogg was the perfect choice for this song. Without it I don’t think this would have been as iconic. Also what the hell is the youth doing with the ‘you could travel the world but nothing comes close to the golden coast’ trend? I don’t get it. Honestly the zoomers are making a lot of Benny Blanco’s 2010 hits trends now, which I’m not mad at, but I’m also with Benny in the fact I have no idea what is going on. Oh I also do remember the exact thing I was doing when I heard this song. It was when it premiered and I literally stopped in my tracks in my room and went ‘holy shit’ and downloaded it straight away. Little did I know what Katy Perry was about to do to me for the rest of 2010. Mkaybye.

**emayzee** (10): not to sound like a boomer but this makes me miss when the concept of a ubiquitous "song of the summer" was still a thing

**hikkaru** (10): this is one of those songs where i think about it like hmm maybe it's not that great but then i listen to it and i have no choice but to give it a 10 bc of nostalgia

**IIIHenryIII** (10): city pop but not actually

**ImADudeDuh** (10): west coast best coast

**nooodisaster** (10): actually aged well - even to this day california still has gurls.

**nootnoot781** (10): like a 7 without snoop dogg

**outsideeyess** (10): the little production/vocal details are so cute. Snoop would've seemed like such a strange choice for a feature on this song but it works so well, I don't think any batted an eye.

**sage** (10): snoop looked camp right in the eye

**waluigiest** (10): I lived like the maximum distance in the US from the coast when this came out but I FELT IT

**xavieryes** (10): top-notch bubblegum pop at its finest

**shhhneak** (9.6): I have a vivid memory of a straight guy in my high school English class asking my closeted ass if I liked this song—and because I was in my pop music is bad phase and it was top of the charts at the time I said I’ve never even heard it.

**cherryices** (9.5): how is it that i like this better now than i did a decade ago? the snoop feature is perfect for this

**throwaway7650** (9.5): left shark ended that fad charli XCX

**awhile2** (9): one of the greatest pop rap verses of all time

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I usually keep switching back and forth on whether I think this song is overrated or not, luckily today I’m bopping

**skargardin** (9): we love a summer smash

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): did u know u can sing tik tok over this chorus and it works perfectly

**teenwitches** (9): empire state of mind outsold, but it's still a cute lil bop, plus it's got the millennial whoop

**thePotatofairyy** (9): A summer classic.

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is what we call "camp". The lyrics are bad! I hate that it has an overly autotuned millennial whoop! And yet, it's still a "bop". The video is ridiculous. Katy Perry shoots whipped cream out of her bra. It's fun!

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Everyone knows this song bangs so I’ll just share a personal anecdote: as a kid I used to think she was saying “Fine fresh beers, we got ‘em on lock!” I also used to think “Daisy Dukes, bikinis on top” meant they all wore thongs on top of their shorts

**davgonp** (8.6): I wanted that board game back then.

**TiltControls** (8.5): Sometimes they'll play the version of this without Snoop on the radio and I get so disoriented when there's just an instrumental break for no reason

**fadedblue09** (8): This sounds fresher than I remembered? I couldn't think of a better song that screams "summer" on first listen

**frogaranaman** (8): I wonder if there's a parody out there of people doing this for their state. like what does "New Hampshire Girls" sound like

**hielord** (8): I have deep memories of me watching the music video when I was nine and thinking "I shouldn't be watching this".

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): I moved across the country (by car!!!) the summer this song was everywhere and my mom and I still refer to it as the ‘California girls’ summer because it was on the radio three times an hour.

**nyoom** (7.5): dig the vibes but "we'll melt your popsicle" isn't an offer, it's a threat

**jman457** (7.3): Maybe its because im an east coaster, but the song sounds a bit dated even if the lyrics are fun

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): not my type of song but it's catchy as hell

**babadork** (7): "Bikinis, zucchinis, martinis/No weenies"

**Iris3271** (7): Fun summer bop

**macnbee** (7): nominating "Delaware Girls" as the sequel (🎵CORPORATE LAWS SO LOOSE WE'LL FOUND YOUR COMPANY🎵)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Imo this is the weakest one out of the singles. 😬 Is that controversial? Honestly it would probably be like an 8.5, but Snoop's verse drags it down.

**jsonphile** (6.5): I can’t decide if Snoop Dogg is the best or the worst thing about this song

**apatel27** (6): Empire State of Mind outsold

## fine, fresh, fierce, does not have it on lock

**cremeebrulee** (5): am i from the east coast or do i dislike this. the answer is both!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): This song is annoying to me. And that it was a "response" to Empire State of Mind is.......................................................something

**Stryxen** (5): i love to hate this song like i just have so many problems with it but it makes me smile and giggle

**CrimsonROSET** (4): Aren’t bikinis both a top and a bottom, what are the bottom part of bikinis called? Is it just a panty? Does it imply they’re partying topless? So many questions about a song with whipped cream titties

**wavingwolves** (3.5): unremarkable in every way possible if i'm honest

**UselessTacooo** (3): Oops! Only Sexual Innuendos!

## snoop dogg was tumblr's bone stealing witch CONFIRMED

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): I always used to think snoop said "squeeze her bones" and was always super disturbed

**seanderlust** (10): this, alongside teenage dream and hummingbird heartbeat, are the best tracks on the record and yes you can quote me on that. it's pining and reflective and beautiful. it manages to be danceable and sadly relatable. the harmonies in the background of the second verse are a favorite

**bigbigbee** (8): Back when this album came out, it felt (to me) like Firework was her big mid-tempo song, and this was a more moderate hit (by Katy's extremely high standards). Looking back, I personally think that this has aged much better, even if Firework is still more iconic to Katy's history. I was surprised at how much I liked listening to this, this go-around.s

---

## Kids A

**ImADudeDuh** (11): this is the most emotional song in the rate

**TiltControls** (11): this was in the very first rate I did and I really regret not 11ing it there. Though a lot of Katy's lyrics end up on the side of cheesy rather than heartfelt, this one knocks it completely out of the park. Also the MV for this has got to be one of my all time favourites

**1998tweety** (10): IN ANOTHA LIFEEEEE, one of her best songs periodt. 13-year-old me was in my feels with this song.

**2dina3dworld** (10): 1. this sounds like a Blink-182 song, like the one they beat to death in Tucson and 2. How do you make out to Radiohead??? Radiohead is like a sex repellant, and I’m saying that as someone who likes Radiohead

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Her best song

**akanewasright** (10): This song made me *cry* as a 12 year old who had no idea what any kind of relationship was like. And honestly, it doesn’t make me openly weep, but it still packs a punch, and the bridge still feels like a gut punch

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): this the song that should've been no.1 and when it did NOT, I was disappointed so it's the number 1 hit that got away.

**astrologicalangel** (10): damn that nostalgia hits hard

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): A moment of honesty here despite the terrible makeup this music video did make me cry when it came out.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I think this song is pretty much brilliant. Great storytelling and you can really feel the longing. It sounds SUPER dated at this point but I never get sick of this song. This song hits even harder listening to it now thinking about the person I would listen to it with then!

**fadedblue09** (10): One of the few songs on this album that actually commit to the concept of a "teenage dream", definitely a well-delivered tale of heartbreak from Katy

**frogaranaman** (10): I bet they were listening to Kid A

**hielord** (10): timeless crying

**hikkaru** (10): :catcry:

**IIIHenryIII** (10): that's her best song, there's no arguing with that (I'm a sucker for sad bops)

**metanoira** (10): gay depression

**nooodisaster** (10): Such a beautiful, bitter sweet song. It's pretty textbook (specific lyrics with a general chorus, catchy beat, slick production) and I don't mind.

**outsideeyess** (10): rip josh groban

**RandomHypnotica** (10): probably my favourite of the Teenage Dream singles, the song and the MV are both perfection

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of katy's best

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): no bc when i was 10 and saw the music video for this for the first time i genuinely thought it was the saddest video ever made and cried so hard at it. i didnt cry at the end of toy story 3 but i cried at the ending of the one that got away music video

**thePotatofairyy** (10): The production is some of my favorite from this entire time period. So bittersweet and melancholy

**throwaway7650** (10): love this song, truly the #1 that got away, I was a chart watcher back then - yes I was like 10 - and I was so disappointed that she didn't break MJ's record (in hindsight I realize this maybe is a good thing)

**xavieryes** (10): DAE the #1 that got away??

**davgonp** (9.4): Her best music video yet.

**wavingwolves** (9.2): [popcrave replies voice] more like the #1 that got away

**apatel27** (9): This is a sound that suits her voice more

**cremeebrulee** (9): yeah i'm a sucker for the "wrong timing"/"in another life" trope so she has me here.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): i cant wait to read all the oversharing stories about this song (bad end)

**daythreeinmiami** (9): So I’m smashing out this rate after listening to Red TV and I am so cried out from All Too Well ten minute but here it come the damn tears. And the video clip is criminal with how hard it makes me cry.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): it’s good but never had been my fave

**cherryices** (8.8): doesn’t quite beat ‘thinking of you’, for me

**celladonn** (8.5): Cute and not as overplayed as most of the other singles on this album

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): She should try making Tayor Swift songs more often because this one has aged maybe the best on this album

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): This should've gone number one too! Literally one of her best songs!

**jman457** (8.3): This song is actually hard to rate because im in my feels that my cat just died and when the song was popular I changed the lyrics to this to be about him.

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I always thought of this song as a more upbeat more electronic version of Thinking Of You (her best song), it's not bad tbf

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I think it's a fun, simple song that works. It's catchy and well-paced. Nothing too extra or overboard to distract or annoy.

**jsonphile** (8): okay seriously how do you make out to Radiohead??

**shhhneak** (8): Acoustic version cause this beat kinda sucks >>>>>

**UselessTacooo** (8): This is probably the best single from the era, but it’s not my favourite one. It’s super cute, and not in a bad way

**waluigiest** (8): I feel like the instrumental is too cheap and boring for the rest of the song

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): cute xx bestie xx live love laugh xxxxx

**endcreditouilles** (7): who makes out to radiohead? what is this, indieheadscirclejerk?

**teenwitches** (6): i just imagine trying to make out while pyramid song is playing through the aux and it makes me laugh

## The Kings of Limbs

**anothertown** (4): There is no creativity or imagination that went on here

**nyoom** (3): this song implanted false memories in me of living in the same small town as this insufferable pair of clowns making out to fucking radiohead all the time and getting matching tattoos within months of their first meeting. man am i glad they broke up

**bigbigbee** (11): So joyful. I like this one even more than TikTok sometimes. It's not just a "party song" (and I love party songs!) It's a wonderful, earnest sentiment. This is one of the most sincere declarations of love I’ve ever heard, and it's in a song that has the word "steez"

**seanderlust** (8): one of the things i really love about kesha is how casually charming she can be. like the fact that she wrote this song with her mom? amazing.

---

## High Scores (geddit?)

**buddhacharm** (11): queen of refusing to enunciate in the chorus, she walked so Ari could "yuh"

**TheQueenOfVultures** (11): I remember watching her perform this on SNL at a sleepover when I was 11. I was the only one who enjoyed it and now I'm gay and everyone else is getting an MBA.

**waluigiest** (11): The way this song builds and transforms is great. And it’s just so fun! Her delivery and lyricism are so playful. But really it peaks at the bridge; it’s this dark heavy segment in an otherwise sweet song that really plays up the self-destructive nature of love she’s describing…. It’s perfect!

**1998tweety** (10): i remember when Kesha blew up, I started stanning this song before everyone else got to it so I

**2dina3dworld** (10): personally my drug of choice is Prozac but love would be nice

**akanewasright** (10): This song is just SO bright and sunny. Like the love as addiction metaphor is a bit overplayed, but this one is just light and fun… and she likes your beard! What more can you ask for?

**Awkward\_King** (10): no because yas

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I'm amazed how fresh this song sounds in 2021, this is a whole bop

**celladonn** (10): That briiiidge, this slaps

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Tik Tok and this were just a taste for what 2010 had install for us. I strongly think that 2010 was one of those rare years in music where there everyone was releasing bops and no matter where you looked there was just pure pop perfection. I just wish it wasn’t he who must not be named that is behind all my favourite albums from this year.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): listening to this song is just as fun as the first time I heard it. How is that outro not a viral tik tok sound yet?

**endcreditouilles** (10): i thought i was cute as hell for downloading an illegal ringtone of this for my razor phone in high school

**ignitethephoenix** (10): her best song imo! Absolutely euphoric and perfect, I’ve always loved this.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it's such a fun bop

**jman457** (10): Best single from Animal

**macnbee** (10): it's a ten folks

**nootnoot781** (10): i like your beard

**nyoom** (10): the name's steez. STEEZ NUTS

**plastichaxan** (10): this brings me so much nostalgia cause i used to have a weekly top 10 thing on youtube and this was #1 for so many weeks

**slimboyfriend** (10): One of the first songs to capture my queer teen imagination.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): is this my favourite kesha song? i think so

**throwaway7650** (10): because YL(IMD), YL(IMD), YL(IMD) is my SSRI

**TiltControls** (10): Deserved Tik Tok's success

**nooodisaster** (9.9): I can't give any song that's "love = drugs" a 10, even tho this is a 10. I just can't anymore.

**babadork** (9.5): I like your beard.

**teenwitches** (9.5): i like your beard

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): i feel like both this song and TD title track describe the obsessive crushes you would have as a teenager, but this one is like . so so much more fun

**anothertown** (9): she taught me back then that an 808 is a drum

**apatel27** (9): Now this is what you call a certified banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): That bridge is so good.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): I have vague memories of this playing on Disney Channel… for some reason

**sage** (9): SMASH

**Stryxen** (9): uh oh this bops

**thePotatofairyy** (9): Fantastic opener! That bridge is one of my favorite moments of all time in pop music. Cute and catchy with a fun outro

**fadedblue09** (8.5): Best chorus of her career perhaps? Too bad she had to ruin this with one of the worst bridges in pop music ever.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): love as drugs, drugs as love, a metaphor that can go either way

**frogaranaman** (8): please don't do coke y'all

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): This is so cringey it's good!

**vayyiqra** (8): I hate "love=drug" songs! And yet there are a lot of good ones. Can we drop that metaphor though? It's cringe. She just said "crackhead" like it was a hilarious joke. I can't give this a 10 in good faith. Anyway, the chorus is fun!

**AHSWeeknd** (7): peak early 2010s/late 2000s music, if anyone ever asks what that era sounded like, play this song.

**jsonphile** (7): I like your beard

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this is a very meh single

**Uberpigeon** (6): my two pet peeves. love = drug metaphors.. and saying "your love"

## Coming down (the list of scores)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this did not age well

**UselessTacooo** (4): this aged terribly. The production is really bad, and Kesha herself isn’t very interesting here.

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Wow, comparing your infatuation with an addiction to a drug? What a novel and underused concept!!

**bigbigbee** (9): Super Bass was always going to be Nicki’s highest placing song in this rate, but I was curious to see how high it would place. This was hovering at #2 for a REALLY long time until a late 0 dropped it down to #5, from which it never recovered.

**seanderlust** (9): so cool of nicki to cover legendary pop icon sue sylvester

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): One of the five songs that was able to hold the crown for at least two ballots, Super Bass started strong, and maintained top 3 relatively easily until the last few ballots came in. One of the many shocking developments that came out of the last day of ballots!

---

## Booming systems

**davgonp** (11): It has to be this way. I’m so sorry.

**nyoom** (11): i did this once at karaoke so poorly that at the end all my friends had to say was "wow you're really good at english"

**shhhneak** (11): If I had a gun to my head and had to recite a song word-for-word to live it would be this one.

**Stryxen** (11): unfortunately the best song in the rate easily

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**2dina3dworld** (10): every year the line “you’re so shy and I’m loving your tie” gets more and more real. Why, of all things, did that have to be my type in guys

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): one of the first symptoms of being a [REDACTED] back then is by listening to this song and secretly dancing to it, and yeah, that's how they suspected me as a [REDACTED].

**Awkward\_King** (10): i honestly think the way nicki minaj and her team and her stans brush over the issue of her silencing her husbands rape victim disgusting, especially with the way she knows just saying other controversial things will work and distract the press from it and i- THIS ONE IS FOR THE BOYS WITH THE BOOMER SYSTEM TOP DOWN AC WITH THE COOLER SYSTEM WHEN HE COME UP IN THE CLUB HE BE BLAZIN UP HE GOT STACKS ON DECK LIKE HE SAVING UP

**babadork** (10): I could never hear this song again, and I will still know all of the words.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It’s genuinely impressive how well this stood up to the massive overplay.

**cherryices** (10): maybe ester dean should have been on more of these tracks

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i mean, come on now

**endcreditouilles** (10): war flashbacks to the time my mom wouldn't let me get jeans with holes in the knees so i set this song as her ringtone and called her every 5 minutes

**frogaranaman** (10): if any song of Nicki's in this rate should be top ten, this is the one

**hikkaru** (10): well i can't say i'm particularly interested in nicki winning a rate in 2021 but there's no denying the fact that this is such a bop and would be deserving

**ignitethephoenix** (10): iconic, probably the best pop rap song of all time

**IIIHenryIII** (10): he got that superb ass, I'll se myself out

**ImADudeDuh** (10): probably the winner of the rate tbh, i can imagine ppl drag most of this album yet give this a 10

**joeeswift** (10): a classic

**letsallpoo** (10): whew i hope this doesn't win

**macnbee** (10): unironically year- and even DECADE-defining

**nooodisaster** (10): THE BEST SONG DUH

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Sue Sylvester absolutely outsold nicki, we want the full sue cut

**sage** (10): thisoneisfortheboyswiththeboominsystemtopdownacwiththecoolersystemwhenhecomeupintheclubhebeblazinupgotstacksondecklikehesavinupandheillherealhemightgottadealhepopbottlesandhegottherightkindofbuildhecoldhedopehemightsellcokehealwaysintheairbutheneverflycoachheamotherfuckintriptripsailoroftheshipshipwhenhemakeitdripdripkisshimontheliplipthatsthekindadudeiwaslookinforandyesyoullgetslappedifyourelookinhoeisaidexcusemeyoureahellofaguyimeanmymymymymyyourelikepelicanflyimeanyouresoshyandimlovingyourtieyourelikesickerthantheguywiththethingonhiseyeyesididyesididsomebodypleasetellemwhothefiisiamnickiminajimackthemdudesupbackcoupesupandcheckthedeuceup

**skargardin** (10): I really think this for better or worse could pull a slumber party

**slimboyfriend** (10): I have to recognize that this is a legendary song that would've gotten my 11 if we weren't witnessing the downfall of Ms. Petty in real time.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ugh i always thought i'd give this song my 11 when we rated it but over the past 18 months i've rlly gotten sick of that so for that reason its coming second. still a FANTASTIC song and i've played the shit out of it the last 10 years

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): nicki honestly should stopped trying to make music after this one. literally nothing will top it

**thePotatofairyy** (10): Honestly, her best song. Anytime I go to a gay club and it comes on the whole room lights up. Spits fire then follows it with a catchy ass chorus. It's that song that you've heard a million times but still gets you happy each time.

**throwaway7650** (10): I hate to contribute to a 9+ average but nicki and swifties won

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): I didn't know Nicki covered "Supah Bess" by Little Mix.

**Uberpigeon** (10): finally some good fucking music in this album

**UselessTacooo** (10): Without this song Nicki would have never broke into the mainstream the way she did. Is it a generic pick to say it is one of her best songs? Yes. Do I give a fuck? Absolutely not.

**vayyiqra** (10): Once I was talking to a girl and mentioned this song and she said "wtf is Super Bass". True story.

**waluigiest** (10): you can have a great thing and then a swiftie ruin it

**wavingwolves** (10): one of the best hit songs of the 10s what else can i say

**akanewasright** (9.5): This is a 10 of a song but… I’d be pissed if it won

**TiltControls** (9.5): I don't think I appreciated this song back in the day but it is a bop

**jackisboredtoday** (9.2): me everytime this song comes on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MRnVuF5cZOc

**outsideeyess** (9.1): pictures Sue Sylvester in a wig

**duochromepalmtree** (9): why did we all think we were so special for knowing every word of this song? Whatever, it’s still a banger.

**jsonphile** (9): so many of her other pop oriented songs have aged poorly but this one has aged wonderfully

**jman457** (8.7): Remember this did this in Glee

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): its a lil overrated zzzz but still pretty solid.

**apatel27** (8): Not the biggest fan of the chorus

**BeauMeringue212** (8): it's annoyingly catchy

**daythreeinmiami** (8): I mean well done to Nicki for making one of the most iconic verses of the 21st century.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): -2 for being annoying

**fadedblue09** (7.5): You know, everytime I rate this I keep giving this a low score.....but I guess miss Minaj deserves a treat this time around. Brings a refreshing energy to an otherwise dull album

**anothertown** (7): Im closing the book on this one mang

**hielord** (7): I had a friend that used to promote the hell out of this song in 2011 and I always remember him for that :) if you're here say hello you thot

## sensible sound equipment

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I had to legitimately think on this one…….. I’ve decided that no it’s not actually good

**AHSWeeknd** (0): It’s such an overplayed song. The verses saved it tbh, but they couldn’t save it from my zero 😔

**JunkyGS** (0): Superbass is a catchy song but it honestly might as well be an Ester Dean solo song. The chorus barely features Nicki and I just don’t think it has aged well compared to the other hits in this rate. It was cute at the time but very meh for me now.

**davgonp** (8.773): Listening to this album again made me so upset, I’m so sad Nicki ended up like this.

**sage** (8.727): i get the complaints for it but i love this album so much idc she slayed so bad

**waluigiest** (8.467): This album was the first CD I ever bought. I was 13 and, after hearing Bottoms Up on the radio, I knew that I had to know everything about this rising star. I got it in November so it was Christmas time when I blasted it in our living room stereo, the only way I had to listen to it at that age. I remember decorating the Christmas tree and my mom being disgusted by Did It On’em… this is my Barb origin story.

**moooo566** (7.900): when this rate was announced i went to listen to this since i only know nicki from a few single, but i accidentally streamed roman reloaded instead, and i'll be honest it was a real disappointment to not get to 11 roman holiday

**jman457** (7.607): Roman Releoaded (The Re-up) (From the Vault) (Taylor’s Version) did it better

**nooodisaster** (7.560): put yourself back in 2010 and this album was IT. like the hype from gay!twitter/tumblr was unreal for this. Her "I'm a human beeeinnnng" feminist rant was just hitting tumblr. She was seen as fresh, progressive, weird, & relatable. Ahh to go back to when you could be an unapologetic barb.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.100): This is getting the lowest score out of the 4 albums, but I truly think it’s better than Teenage Dream and Loud as a full body of work. At least, it’s more personal than both of them, which makes it a whole lot more interesting and enjoyable.

**jsonphile** (6.933): well I liked more of this album than I thought I might. Her pop oriented songs I feel sound more dated, but her rapping is still fantastic

**xavieryes** (6.800): My least favorite of the 4 albums here, but still pretty fine in general.

**akanewasright** (6.793): So…. I don’t like this album much. Not even in a “god this is awful” just like… so many songs are kinda dull. It has a few good tracks, but I find that a lot of it has aged badly in some way, or that her ability to carry a song without rapping is… not strong

**throwaway7650** (6.767): this is somehow even more camp than TD, which has peacock and hummingbird heartbeat. that's about the extent of "positive" thoughts I have on the album :grinny: and super bass better not win... pleek!

**TiltControls** (6.767): Definitely the album I was least familiar with, but it went alright! Some good stuff here and some not so great stuff (as with the style at the time it seems), but overall a solid output

**apatel27** (6.300): Just a confused album. Is it Pop? Hip Hop? RnB? a weak amalgamation of all three?

**hielord** (6.233): The first part of this album is... rough. But it gets better and stays that way for the rest of the album. I certainly didn't expect to listen to a white straight man singing a slur in the middle of a song, so that threw me off a little, But the rest of the album is good (specially the middle part). I know I'm biased when I say that I prefer the "popier" version of Nicki, but she really excels with her vocals in these songs, so props to that.

**fadedblue09** (5.900): For the debut album of the most prolific female rapper of this generation, this is so….underwhelming. I expected to hear the spitfire verses that I usually hear in her features, instead she served me with...meandering vocals that awkwardly straddle the line between singing and rapping. Its lyrical themes are also so repetitive, at some point I felt like I was listening to the same track again and again. I guess the best thing about this is how she opened up a new wave of female rappers, including those better than her.

**skargardin** (5.867): Apart from the singles, there really isn't much of note here for me, sadly.

**metanoira** (5.833): look i tried

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.667): Sorry Nicki, you honestly never stood a chance with me… Independent of her, uh, personal controversies, I’m just not a rap person. I’ve tried to listen to a few rappers but none seem to stick. That unfortunately includes Nicki, though I did have some moments of enjoyment while listening to this album! Mostly the funny lyrics and voices she puts on, she’s good at that!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.633): I honestly expected worse.

**hikkaru** (5.567): this is the only album here i've never heard in full and i was very disappointed! it's just so boooooring i guess she saved all her personality and what made her so interesting at this time for her features. far too many mediocre ballad moments for me. it's crazy that super bass, the only really stellar song here, was just a deluxe track - i guess it wasn't slow and boring enough for nicki to include in the main album. thankfully there's no shame in giving such a horrid person a bad average so good riddance

**vayyiqra** (5.200): Here's the problem with this album: it's boring. A Nicki Minaj album should not be. Nicki is many things, but in her prime, she was not boring. Why is this so dull then? It's full of repetitive songs that go nowhere and have weak hooks and aren't memorable. Two horrendous songs in a row also drag it down a lot. Overall this was disappointing. Even putting aside Nicki as a person, this album is just weak. She can do better.

**celladonn** (5.200): I really tried to be objective and not let my distaste for Nicki as a person affect my rating but the truth is that this album is pretty mediocre. A lot of the production has aged BADLY

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.967): i dont really know where else to say this but does anyone else the album cover looks really off. why are her legs so long and where tf are her arms.

**plastichaxan** (4.700): wow i did not enjoy this at all, i’m sorry to Nicki, she’s great, she’s a good rapper, but this is not a good album and most of these songs are not that good, the production feels so out of place and honestly her rapping is what saved this from being a totally awful album… which i guess could be the point? idk

**AHSWeeknd** (4.533): this album seriously ain’t it. I’m surprised people actually like it, she’s done so much better and yet this is looked at as some iconic album. It ain’t it. If y’all had put any other one of her albums on here my average for one of her albums would’ve been higher, but oof this one is just bad.

**seanderlust** (9): i mean, come on. a classic. turn your brain off and party anthem. yes the lyrics are ridiculous but you know what it fits the vibe so it gets a pass. brain empty, no thoughts, ass shaking.

---

## Feels like P. Diddy

**celladonn** (11): Iconic legendary masterpiece etc etc etc

**emayzee** (11): something shifted when this came out

**Looks\_good\_in\_shorts** (11): Absolutely never fails to put me in a great mood, still one of my favorite pump up songs to this day

**rotating3Dtext** (11): the power that this has to turn people up even today...

**vayyiqra** (11): Why am I giving this an 11? You had to be there. It was a different time. I won't say simpler, because it was not. There was a "great recession" and millennials had it rough. We coped with partying and trashy-but-fun electropop. Is this just nostalgia then? No! I didn't like this song much at the time, I thought it was just a meme. It deserves respect though as perhaps the song that best captures the zeitgeist of its era.

**1998tweety** (10): the only song allowed to block bad romance

**AHSWeeknd** (10): An anthem for clocks!!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): i miss those times when you're just a song, not an app for disappointing cringefests.

**anothertown** (10): the best dancepop song of the 2000s has entered the room.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I mean it defined 2010's pop. Although Caitlyn Jenner owes Kesha reparations for what she did to this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Changed the world. Every line is a masterpiece. Every bleep iconic. Every bloop a cultural reset. This song is what my username is all about.

**cremeebrulee** (10): if i had last.fm back in 2010, this would be probably be my #1 track of all time and completely unmovable from that spot because i was so obsessed with this song. like to the point where i would play it on repeat before i went to bed??? a genuine 11 contender if rihanna weren't here

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Oh my god did I feel superior because I was one of the first in my class to know about this song. I introduced them to this. And Justin Bieber One Time. Yeah they thought it was a girl and didn’t believe me that Justin was a boy. 2009 was such a simple year.

**endcreditouilles** (10): 16 year old me singing along like i thought someday i would also be brushing my teeth with a bottle of jack before i left the house

**frogaranaman** (10): do the Tiktok rate

**hikkaru** (10): SO GLAD I GREW UP WITH THIS SONG AND NOT THAT SHITTY APP!!!!!!!!!! 😂😂😂😂😂🤣🤣🤣

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Ended the video platform

**IIIHenryIII** (10): one of the best pop songs of all time

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended fad romance

**moooo566** (10): toothpaste, babes

**nyoom** (10): ke$ha was so quintessentially, vibrantly, triumphantly 2010s and there's honor and glory in that.

**plastichaxan** (10): i cant deny how much of a classic this is

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Most of my memories of this song are from seeing really bad parody versions online more than the actual song, but it's an absolutely iconic and defining song

**shhhneak** (10): Some of y’all will never understand the grip this had on high school dances.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): probably the most iconic song in the rate

**teenwitches** (10): this turned middle school dances from lame to "last night was a movie"

**thePotatofairyy** (10): Someone once said "nothing will ever compare to the first time you heard this song" I think about that comment often. It's high brow camp lyrically and sonically one of the most catchy fun songs that just brings me joy.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I cried when she performed this at some award show in 2019, so it gets a 10

**throwaway7650** (10): what a fucking classic, she outsold that FAD app, addison rae and dixie d'amelio are OVER. this deserved to be in the tiktok rate (and win it) idc

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): The "OooOh OoOh WAoOh" will forever be iconic.

**waluigiest** (10): this had me misbehaving in 7th grade

**xavieryes** (10): a classic

**xxipil0ts** (10): This was a cultural reset, the blueprint me thinks.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): god this really just.,.,., deserves everything

**davgonp** (9.5): Easier times.

**hielord** (9.5): So thankful that Kesha invented clocks

**sage** (9.5): iconic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): dAe ReMeMbEr WhEn TiKtOk WaS jUsT tHe NaMe Of A sOnG

**wavingwolves** (9.5): this is the most influential song of the 2010s since it CLEARLY is the reason as to why the social media app tiktok exists

**jman457** (9.3): classic I fear

**astrologicalangel** (9): classic

**babadork** (9): So dumb it's great

**CrimsonROSET** (9): p diddy and naomi campbell dated, as so many songs will for some reason remind you of

**duochromepalmtree** (9): iconic, influential, life changing, etc

**Iris3271** (9): Mick Jagger is a strange beauty standard to have

**akanewasright** (8.5): I once did this song at karaoke in front of my mom, who banned me from listening to it as a kid. That lost this song a few points

**jsonphile** (8.5): an iconic song I can’t deny it. Instantly quotable lyrics, an infectious beat, and a song only Ke dollar sign ha could pull off

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): please play the Key of Awesome parody after this it was such a MOMENT on early youtube

**apatel27** (8): Ahead of its time

**macnbee** (8): queen of inventing chinese social media apps

**slimboyfriend** (8): She honestly has a better white girl flow than Iggy Azalea

**UselessTacooo** (8): I did not realize how terrible this aged. It is iconic though so… bonus points I guess?

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): don’t kill me… but this lacks the push it needs to go from good to great. It would’ve been cool if it’d had some sort of silly quirk or breakdown that was unique to this song and this song alone, but it just plays it too safe.

**nooodisaster** (7): This is overplayed even for me a huge Kesha stan. Like if I never heard this song again I would be just fine. But it also was an 11 for several years.

**TiltControls** (6): It's alright, but I've never enjoyed the song as much as everyone else seems to

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): They went too far with everything on this record

## listen, I expected a lot of comparisons to other artists for these early Kesha songs but I was NOT expecting him

**fadedblue09** (0): Man I HATE THIS SONG SO MUCH. Listening to this just unearths so many awful memories but honestly disregarding that it’s just a bad song in general? A bunch of stupid lyrics and irritating vocals. People are now acting like this is some masterpiece when in reality this is the Shape of You of 2010 (at least Ed’s vocals are bearable!)

**IIIHenryIII** (9.588): I might be the exception in this sub, but this album is so much better than Rainbow. BTW, High Road is her best album. Why are y’all sleeping on it?

**throwaway7650** (9.471): well, time to write an essay... I'm fully expecting to be near/at the top of album averages for animal and what can I say, look at the material! all 4 artists in the rate are icons of 2010 and the surrounding years but kesha (at the time ke$ha, I thought her stage name was so cool as a kid tbh) truly defines that era of pop for me and comes to mind first if someone asked me what represents the year 2010 for me - the answer is tik tok btw. I was such a hardcore casual kesha stan during those years if that makes sense, like I stanned her singles HARD (I watched those MVs so much). I just adore kesha's brand of pop, as a person, and as an artist ~~even if I haven't heard any of her other albums in full~~ and I really hope animal does well in the rate. also going to link pitchfork's retrospective animal review, which I just think is good reading https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/kesha-animal/

**hikkaru** (9.206): i just love kesha so much, prior to high road she was one of my go-to answers for an artist that has an immaculate discography and ofc animal is part of that immaculateness. we all know the singles but she shines so much on so many of the bsides, including the songs more on the ballad side. i hope we can all appreciate how fun this album is instead of treating her like the 2010 punching bag she was in this era

**xavieryes** (8.794): The second best album in the rate. Just pure fun.

**plastichaxan** (8.753): This album not only brings me so much nostalgia and conflicting feelings, but it also holds up so well, every song still hits for me and ugh i hate that’s it’s a bit tainted but doing the rate reminded me how much i used to love kesha

**akanewasright** (8.588): Kesha’s history with Dr. Luke makes this album complicated, but… it’s hard to argue that she isn’t the driving force of what makes this album memorable and good. She inhabits every syllable of nearly every song with personality and energy, and her songwriting, while crude and sometimes in poor taste, is already pretty damn sharp. These songs are good because of her, not because of anyone else.

**waluigiest** (8.235): Okay so I remember being in English class and hearing someone’s Tik Tok ringtone go off. That was the first time I ever heard Kesha and it was kind of the moment I fell in love with pop music.

**nooodisaster** (8.112): there was never a good song to 0 and say it there, so ill say it here: fuck dr. luke that man is not seeing heaven.

**sage** (8.053): i remembered liking this a lot more but its still really solid overall with a few absolute smashes

**celladonn** (7.882): I loved Kesha then and I love Kesha now

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.824): This album makes me feel so nostalgic for the early 2010's even though I had no clue who Kesha even was back then. But it's so crazy to see how much she's grown and matured since this album. I don't have that much else to say about this album. But one thing I do wanna say is I hope that all the karma hits Dr. Puke twice as hard as it should and that I hope he's able to watch his reputation and career burn to the ground 😊. Free Kesha!!!

**apatel27** (7.824): Definitely sounds better than when it first came out

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7.765): I enjoyed this one but not as much as Witness Teenage Dream

**metanoira** (7.529): this album is just so loud

**jman457** (7.500): Electro-pop at its best and worst

**slimboyfriend** (7.441): I can't believe how incredibly well this album has aged. It still sounds as irreverent and fun and stupid as it did in 2010.

**vayyiqra** (7.353): Well, this is a wild album. Haha, I'm funny. This album is classic Kesha: chaotic, unhinged, very (as we said back then) rAnDoM. Despite her "crAzy party girl" persona, this is more tame than I remember given its reputation at the time; having said that I listen to many such artists like Uffie, Nadia Oh and (Canadian) Peaches, who is way raunchier. However this album could still be called a classic of electro even if it is uneven and many of its lyrics have aged badly. It's fun music to turn your brain off and enjoy the bleepbloops and pretend you aren't an introvert but a frequenter of underground hipster parties in 2010. For that I have a fondness for it that the other albums in this rate don't.

**hielord** (7.071): Not gonna lie, I consider this one the weakest out of the four. I think it's too long (although I'm not even sure if all the songs I'm rating here are from the same album or album version, Spotify says otherwise) and there's too much filler. I try not to be baladphobic but this album doesn't help. Although I have to say that its highs are really good and it has some golden bangers.

**anothertown** (6.941): me and kesha never really connected... idk I was more into European electropop back then.

**BeauMeringue212** (6.812): I remember we found this CD in my friend's house while I was in my closeted era and I participated in his relentless bullying. Sorry to that man cos this slaps

**AHSWeeknd** (6.765): Listen, I’m all for meaningless, stereotypical pop music. But oh Lorde some of these songs are the definition of filler-track.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.500): I’m shocked at how well some of the songs on this album have aged…well at least the singles

**TiltControls** (6.382): Out of all the rates I've done oddly enough the Animal + Cannibal combo from my first rate still had my lowest album average. So I was definitely curious to see if I had much better things to say this time around. While it's not as bad as the first time around rating it, it's still not exactly my favourite thing to listen to. In terms of 'Party Kesha' aesthetic I think Warrior did a much better job. Too many of the songs here just have weird production quirks for me to fully enjoy. There's definite gold here - but I still can't say that I love this album as a whole.

**jsonphile** (5.912): I liked this a lot more than I thought I would. Granted some of these songs are incredibly annoying, but some are enjoyably trashy, and some are just great songs

**Verboten\_Prince** (5.824): This album is kinda like if Teenage Dream leaned less into rock and more into electronic… Honestly found a lot of it to be very grating and kinda dated, but you know what? If I heard any of these songs in the club I absolutely would get turnt!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.794): a product of its time and NOT in a good way. nearly every track on this aged poorly and theres no real reason to listen to it outside of the singles. #freekesha

**fadedblue09** (4.382): It’s no secret that I despise Kesha’s music, especially her pre-Rainbow stuff. This album is a combination of my least favorite elements in pop music (terrible AutoTune, inane lyrics, garbage electropop sounds). I just can’t fathom how someone can listen to this and enjoy it unironically, because to me this is literal noise pollution. Seeing all the revisionist poptimism she’s been receiving lately is honestly baffling but good for her I guess. But as harsh as this sounds, I can’t say I miss her presence in mainstream music at all. Sorry.

**bigbigbee** (10): This was my other 11 contender, so I’m pleased to see it make 3rd place, especially since it was stuck at #5 for so long. Listening to this song always makes me feel just like a high schooler all over again – carefree and joyful.

**seanderlust** (10): this one...oh this song holds a special place in my heart. it perfectly captures that dizzying, doe-eyed feeling of first love. even the references to sex in the bridge are overflowing with this optimistic youthful spirit. it's a simple melody but god is it effective.

**ReallyCreative** (5): This song is overrated and no amount of screaming, crying, pissing, shitting, or throwing up by y'all is going to change that.

---

## Drove to Cali and got drunk on the beach

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Can’t sing live this. Witness flopped that. The haters can say whatever they want and this will still be better than any song their fave has put out or will ever put out.

**cherryices** (11): i am so fucking boring for 11ing this!! 😵💫

**daythreeinmiami** (11): Those opening guitar chords honestly define a generation now. When this was released in 2010 it literally shook me to my core. I hate that this was produced by he who will not be named because this is probably one of the best pop songs released.

**hikkaru** (11): it's a perfect song

**macnbee** (11): right out the gate with my 11, this song defines the 2010s for me. I could listen to it every day for the rest of my life and still feel a manic surge of energy at the pre-chorus ("you and I will be young forever--"). I also love how her voice starts off thin & reedy and then builds as the song goes on.

**Sfbby** (11): The ultimate nostalgia anthem for millennials who wish they could relive the highs of their first love story

**slimboyfriend** (11): Even I, a nobody gay who thinks Katy Perry was (is) the most mediocre pop star in the game MUST admit that this is one of the best songs of the decade.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): one of the greatest pop songs OF ALL TIME!!

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now, pop perfection

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I remember tv ads for this that’d try and get people to make this song their ringtone

**akanewasright** (10): I need a fucking boyfriend

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): cuz it's legendary

**Awkward\_King** (10): increddible pop song i hate to say it but she really brought the pussy out of this one

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i cant wait to read all the oversharing stories about this song (good end)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): An undeniable hit. It's driving, catchy, euphoric. It's the sugary, anthemic EDM pop of the early 2010s in peak, perfect form.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): LET YOU PUT YOUR HANDS ON ME IN MY SKIN TIGHT JEANS BE YOUR TEENAGE DREAM TONIGHT.

**emayzee** (10): me listening to this at age 12: wow, a youthful summer romance sounds like so much fun. would love to experience that someday. me listening to this at age 23: wow, a youthful summer romance sounds like so much fun. would love to experience that someday.

**fadedblue09** (10): It's a no-brainer why this will forever be considered her best song: a perfect blend of electropop and pop-rock, equally catchy verses and chorus, and (ironically enough) a relative sense of maturity compared to the rest of the album. Yeah, I wouldn't mind this winning at all.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this truly is pop perfection and honestly is timeless

**IIIHenryIII** (10): pop perfection

**jman457** (10): One of the best singles from the Teenage Dream era.

**joeeswift** (10): where’s my fucking teenage dream?

**nooodisaster** (10): a classic, what can i say. hold up lemme put a goddamn mark.

**outsideeyess** (10): with this syncopation, how could I not give this a 10?

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's a classic, a smasha, a defining hit

**shhhneak** (10): This is just a complete collapse of a chorus. She came on this bitch mad as hell!!!

**skargardin** (10): This does take me back

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): iconic

**teenwitches** (10): https://slate.com/culture/2014/03/katy-perrys-teenage-dream-explaining-the-hit-using-music-theory.html

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Kind of the perfect pop song

**throwaway7650** (10): the inferior title track in the rate but still a 10 :noitstrue:

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): I'm sorry, but I can't think of this song without thinking of the Addison Rae version. But it really is a perfect pop song!

**vayyiqra** (10): Let's ignore how Katy was much older than a teenager when she made this! Here's an oddly specific memory: this song reminds me of 2010 when I was getting a bagel for lunch. It had salmon, red onion, capers, cheese, mustard, perhaps tomato. Why does this matter? It doesn't! But this song was playing and and I noticed it was good. Also, it was a good bagel.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Sis no one here says “Cali.” You’re better than that

**waluigiest** (10): this song had me wistful as a 13 year old who hadn’t so much as thought about kissing somebody

**nootnoot781** (9.9): great pop song, it can’t win though. that would be so disappointing

**moooo566** (9.5): weird that she'd open an album with a pop version of darren criss' masterpiece but it kind of works ngl

**TiltControls** (9.5): It's a great song, but I always preferred a lot of the other TD singles over it

**nyoom** (9): i've been listening to weed and foxes in fiction's cover for so long i kinda forgot what this sounded like but it holds up

**xxipil0ts** (9): I was ready to give it a lower score but the chorus really ties the song together!

**hielord** (8.7): The vocals are incredible here. I'm gonna be honest and say that I've never liked this song a lot, but I really appreciate its production.

**frogaranaman** (8): my dream as a teenager was to be a world famous performer and now the thought of someone even looking my direction sends me into a nervous fit

**jsonphile** (8): okay sorry sorry sorry but it’s a bit overrated. But it’s a solid song

**sage** (8): if the verses didnt sound like absolute shit this would be at least a 9

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): not my favorite Katy, but probably what she’ll be remembered for. Such an image-defining song

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I remember this being a lot better than it was, but the vocals haven’t really aged well - they sound breathless and strained

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): i know a lot of people consider this the best song on the album but in all honesty i never got the hype around it. its a good song but half of the other singles from this album are so much better

**ImADudeDuh** (7): idk i listen to it but it never really clicks for me like it does for most

**Iris3271** (7): Solid opener, not in love with Katy's voice in some parts

**Uberpigeon** (7): this is the most teenage dream song which is fitting because its called teenage dream

**UselessTacooo** (6.5): super overrated. It’s not bad, but it does not deserve half the love it gets.

**cremeebrulee** (6.1): on the plus side, this song captures the feeling of those really hormonal crushes you got as a teenager, but just like those crushes, i also look back at this and cringe. the bridge is really good tho dddd

## Drove to Idaho and got lost

**BeauMeringue212** (3): I used to love this song but I can't listen to it at all anymore. Something about the song composition just feels weird to listen to

##I have a theory

**endcreditouilles** (8): where have i heard this before...

**anothertown** (10): i used to watch the glee version and just cry. can't believe I was that gay

**plastichaxan** (10): idc this is such a cute song and as someone who’s heard both glee versions they just help this sound way better

**celladonn** (9): Usually I would never be caught dead saying the Glee version of a song outsold but in this one specific case the Glee version did outsell

**Stryxen** (9): banger and an 11 but it was on glee twice (-1 x 2)

**babadork** (8): I can't ignore that I wish I was listening to the Glee cover instead.

**wavingwolves** (6): does anyone remember that horrible glee version that people used to hype up for no reason? what was that about?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8.286): The pop bible for making cookie-cutter pop songs that actually works! (By the way, Dressin' Up is missing!)

**hielord** (8.279): I don't think that this album is appreciated enough. I may not know a lot about the pop music scene of the early 2010s, but this album was (and still is) groundbreaking. A strong body of work, cohesive (we love that word right?), full of bangers and bops. Even the deep cuts help keeping the album's momentum. If streaming was coming to an end this would be one of the first albums I would buy. At least 6 of the songs on this album hold emotional value for a lot of us, good memories of late childhood/teenage years/young adulthood. Katy's vocals are lovely, the lyrics are good, it's just a pretty well rounded album.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.143): insert the "some of y'all bout to be real mad at me, but it must be said video clip here.* Alright I love this album and I also do think it's a perfect pop album, but I HATE when people say stuff like "Katy needs to make another teenage dream" or " I wish she went back to old Katy." I literally hate it. Listen, because everybody need to hear this! THERE WILL NEVER BE ANOTHER TEENAGE DREAM!!! Katy has grown and she has matured so much since Teenage Dream. If y'all hold every single project she releases at Teenage Dream level, NEWS FLASH, you'll always be disappointed! Y'all need to realize that the old Katy isn't coming back! Okay!!! Just stop! Thank you and have a nice day!

**hikkaru** (8.107): a lot of the bsides on this are pretty rough but the singles are so iconic, and even if i see the flaws in some of them i can't help but feel the rush of nostalgia they bring me and score them well

**lipe18090** (8.086): THE most iconic album from this year

**AHSWeeknd** (8.000): This album, conceptually, is the perfect “teenage diary” sort of thing. It’s a good album but doesn’t really stand the test of time.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.964): The singles are the only good songs. The rest are mediocre at best. I love this era though. Back then I didn't care about the deep cuts and had never heard them before this rate, with the exception of Peacock, which I'm assuming wasn't a single. Anyway, all of these singles were part of my teens and I truly love all of them. Fun fact: I kinda stanned Katy. I used to like her music more than Taylor's.

**waluigiest** (7.857): not a single miss on the album proper, but Part of Me is a monstrosity

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.821): It’s the best album in the rate. It’s one of the best pop albums of the decade. Sorry not sorry.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.643): I went into this rate knowing full well that my scores for this album would faaaaar exceed the others… Not only is this the only one of the three that I’ve listened to before, but I just adore it. There are some stinkers, but they can’t outweigh the masterful musical production and bubbly optimistic themes of the album’s best moments. I wouldn’t call it an ambitious record, but it knows what it came to do, and by god did it do that!

**TiltControls** (7.429): The way I was able to score this album entirely by memory. One of my favourite album eras if only because every song seemed MASSIVE. Like there was no escaping the grip of Katy Perry for a solid 2-3 years. While this might be a negative to some, I found that the singles from this album were all stellar and I would gladly continue to loop them for eternity. Some of the non-singles seem a little too fillery for me to appreciate the album as a whole, it's still an important listen and hopefully the singles do much better this time around.

**jman457** (7.386): An album that defined 2010-2012, even though I would say it wasnt the best pop of that era

**xavieryes** (7.214): A pretty good album for the most part, even if it gets kinda terrible towards the end, but nonetheless iconic. It spawned 5 number ones (6 if you count Part of Me) for a reason.

**throwaway7650** (7.179): people don't lie when they say that TD is absolutely carried by the singles... like they are damn good singles (outside of 1 hehe) but the side tracks are tragic for the most part. still, there's no denying how impactful this era was and the MVs (remixes too, she's current taylor with tact) were just serve after serve. T.G.I.F! - me when it's day 1 of the reveal

**fadedblue09** (7.071): Great singles, beautiful singles…. In all honesty, this album was more enjoyable than I expected. Surprised at how this leans closer to pop-rock than the dominant EDM-pop at the time, which makes it more listenable than most of its peers. The album is mostly held back by Katy’s vocals and songwriting and I still don’t think it’s her best (that honor goes to OOTB), but it still has some solid songs.

**celladonn** (7.036): A lot of classics that have suffered from overplay and some less than classic deep cuts. It's fun!

**akanewasright** (6.993): the singles off this album are, for the most part, still really fucking strong, but nearly every other song made me go “well this isn’t BAD but it could be way better”

**nooodisaster** (6.821): someone on popheads said Katy Perry is gonna be seen by future generations how our generation sees Paula Abdul today and i never recovered

**anothertown** (6.786): 2010-12 were my first two years of college and just generally the worst two years of my life, and like it or not, this was the soundtrack!

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6.536): Proof that you can have good songs and not be a good album. The hits are all great and fun, but the album tracks are held together by Katy being able to half sell the cheesy lyrics

**vayyiqra** (6.500): I wrote the most comments for this album, so I'll keep it brief: This isn't a great album. It's some singles and a bunch of filler. I see its appeal but without nostalgia goggles it's a mediocre album that's slick and well-produced (yes Dr. Puke bad I know). It's a decent, uneven pop album by a pretty lady. Which is fine; I just can't agree that this is some kind of pop bible.

**plastichaxan** (6.486): I’m still amazed at the success this had back then, it’s fun even with its duds and honestly i miss katy being fun and trying too hard but in a different way

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.214): it was a cultural reset. what more really needs to be said

**jsonphile** (6.036): Honestly the singles are all a bit overrated in my opinion, but they’re (most of them) still bops. And yeah most of the non-singles on here are pretty terrible.

**cremeebrulee** (5.750): genuinely one of the most overrated albums discussed on popheads. i feel like this is what happens when people equate chart success with quality because i get that TD was record breaking in terms of billboard #1s, but i don't think that speaks on how good these songs are. i think a few of the singles are decent (last friday night, TOTGA, wide awake), but they don't really salvage the project for me.

**sage** (5.714): tbh this was nowhere near as bad as i was expecting because of some of the reactions to it but it still isnt giving. this album would be at least a point better if the mixing/mastering wasnt so bad 😭

**duochromepalmtree** (5.643): In high school my best friend and I would ride the DC metro and share headphones and listen to this album on repeat for HOURS. To me this album is wildly inconsistent. There are songs on here I LOVE and still listen to frequently. And there are some that would make my list of my least favorite songs of all time. Iconic album for sure though. These songs were everywhere!

**apatel27** (5.500): The production on a lot of these songs didn’t age well

**BeauMeringue212** (4.993): omg not Olivia owing credits to another 2000s pop girl

**seanderlust** (10): that "la-la-la-la" triggers something feral in me. I am a sleeper agent and rihanna just sang my codeword

**bigbigbee** (8): I think Rihanna is awesome but this song has never connected with me as much as some of her other promotional singles. I fully understand why other people like this, but it's just not dark enough to match something like Disturbia, nor bright enough to match something like We Found Love. But it’s Rihanna. It’s dance pop. I can and will party to this, and gladly!

---

## Is loved like they're a hot....pie?? I think?

**1998tweety** (11): this song is IT, whew what a pop anthem

**AHSWeeknd** (11): This won’t win the rate for some reason, but it’s the best song here.

**apatel27** (11): Go off queen! God tier chorus

**fadedblue09** (11): All the suffering I had to go through to give this an 11....yes, it is worth it.

**LesApfels** (11): Perfection. My favourite Rihanna song

**lipe18090** (11): Song of the year

**moooo566** (11): possibly the greatest pop song?

**nooodisaster** (11): When this song first premiered out the only mp3 on YouTube had "RYAN SEACREST... WORLD PREMIERE" tagged at the beginning and end. I loved the song so much I downloaded it to my iPod anyway, and spent the whole day listening to this song on repeat while playing Halo Reach Forge Mode on my Xbox 360. I still sing where the tag went in the song to this day.

**teenwitches** (11): bright, crazy, loud, in your face pop perfection

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is the ideal example of a pop song. You may not know it, but this is what peak performance looks like

**akanewasright** (10): GOD this song is incredible. Like it’s just an incredible dance song, and Rihanna sounds fucking incredible

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): i never replaced the gendered words while singing it in a school competition once and them sneaky fookin' eyes are all over me...

**Awkward\_King** (10): yeah this is it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): LET’S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO. One of the best choruses of the decade I know that’s right.

**cherryices** (10): this song smells like britney spears’ midnight fantasy. this song tastes like blue powerade. this song IS 2010 school socials

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Early 2010s EDM could be good, actually.

**davgonp** (10): This song has an unique feeling. Not to mention that flawless music video.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): LOW KEY I hated this song when it came out? I have no idea why? But it really grew on me when I was at a sweet sixteen in a stretched Hummer in 2010. That was the richest I have ever felt.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this was THE song to lock eyes with a cute boy across the room at a high school dance to

**hikkaru** (10): who else cheered

**ignitethephoenix** (10): massive bop, this was a moment when she dropped it as the lead and had the red hair

**IIIHenryIII** (10): that's an 11 contender

**ImADudeDuh** (10): want you to love me, like im a hot pie

**jman457** (10): Banger even today

**plastichaxan** (10): cultural reset

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Rihanna IS the only girl in the world

**Stryxen** (10): only bop in the rate

**thePotatofairyy** (10): The production hooks me from the start everytime. Probably the best example of what makes 2010 choruses so great. It's literally so loud in the best of ways

**throwaway7650** (10): classic but S&M is the better #1 that's a 10 I fear

**TiltControls** (10): BOP

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): This song is literally perfect and if it doesn't make at least top 5 we're gonna have a problem.

**UselessTacooo** (10): I lose my mind every time I hear this song. I’ve loved it ever since it came out and it hasn’t aged at all

**waluigiest** (10): want you to love me like im a hot pie

**CrimsonROSET** (9): a just dance anthem

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): rihanna has become the first woman in history. congratulations rihanna!

**Uberpigeon** (9): i forgot how much of a banger this is

**nyoom** (8.5): when you're actually nlog

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): ugh i want to give this a 10 bc i loved it for so long but now it doesn't hit as hard as the other 10's but still a fantastic song!!! what a lead single

**wavingwolves** (8.4): you're telling me she's not singing "i want you to love me like i'm a hot guy"⁉️

**TragicKingdom1** (8): great verses but the chorus is kinda shouty

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The chorus is soooo good! The rest is okay

**outsideeyess** (7.8): I never loved this song that much, probably cause I was never huge into dance music. the verses are fuckin great but the synths in the chorus seem kinda uninspired

**BeauMeringue212** (7): it's still catchy, but idk feels like it's missing something. Or just hasn't aged as well

**duochromepalmtree** (7): I don’t know if it’s blasphemy but I never really loved this song. When it comes on I absolutely jam but I’m never like “wow I really want to listen to only girl!” Never happens.

**sage** (7): bops but ive heard it so many times that im sick of it

## is unloved (no negative comments so nobody!)

##um, yes! love that journey for you!

**frogaranaman** (10): have sucked dick to this song before!! ❤️

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): this song absolutely shook my Christian rural high school, there were genuine arguments over whether the radio change the lyrics to be "Ass and Damn" because it would be MORE family friendly than S+M, people forget how puritan the 2000s into the 2010s were

**bigbigbee** (8): I realized Rihanna's power when I was on a subway in China in June 2011 and I saw a man in a pink feather boa singing along to this and bopping his head. I think about him often and I hope he's doing well. 

 While it had some early competition, after ballot #30 or so, it wasn’t ever a question of if this would win; the only question was by how much (and who would get the silver).

---

##manifesting R9

**akanewasright** (11): the way this song was literally like. Defining for me. This was one of the first songs I got into when I started listening to pop radio, and it was one where I both knew that it was stuff I wasn’t supposed to listen to and loved the shit out of it. I have loved this song for 10 years and I’ll love it for 100 more. You will have to pry this song out of my cold, dead hands.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): because you made realize my very first fetish at 7

**BeauMeringue212** (11): a lot of songs from this era of pop didn't age well, but this always slapped. As soon as you hear the bass it just feels nasty. Ester Dean went off

**CrimsonROSET** (11): let me put my asexual card aside for a singular second

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): This song is....everything? From the very starting "Na na na come ON" to the pounding beat. This brings me BACK to being at a gay club seeing this music video for the first time dancing like crazy. Unreal!!! The WAY Rihanna sings the chorus is power personified. She is in control of everything in this moment. She IS the moment. With my 11, I summon R9!!!! (delusional)

**frogaranaman** (11): when I sang this song during recess in middle school and gave some nuns a heart attack yasssss 😍

**ignitethephoenix** (11): First off, MAJOR BOP. Second, remember when this was age restricted but it’s literally like 5x tamer than a lot of other videos these days

**Iris3271** (11): She walked so WAP could run

**jackisboredtoday** (11): i just thought it was the greatest song ever made

**jman457** (11): When I I allowed to listen this song forever, but the track and music video are iconic.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Now I don't say this lightly, but this IS pop perfection

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): queen of sex!! [2]

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): https://i.imgur.com/I5xiAsL.png

**1998tweety** (10): im the embodiment of cringe so when i was in middle school I wrote a parody to the chorus and called it Science&Mathematics instead.

**2dina3dworld** (10): I learnt all of the words to this at age 9, and that caused my mum to promptly throw out her Loud CD so I would forget, but I did not. I can sing S&M like that one vine if anyone asks me to.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): There’ll probably a fair amount of comments for this song like “I loved this when I was a CHILD.” Or “I was too YOUNG to listen to this!!1!”

**anothertown** (10): ester dean deserves the world for writing "sticks and stones may break my bones but chains and whips excite me"

**apatel27** (10): Shoutout to my conservative IT teacher playing and singing along to this in class when it came out

**awhile2** (10): im sure im not the only one who had no idea what S&M was prior to this song

**celladonn** (10): I came so close to giving this my 11

**daythreeinmiami** (10): THIS IS THE BOP THAT JUST MAKES YOU FEEL EVERYTHING. Honestly what an album opener and really just a song where Rihanna just pushed all the boundaries and was like 'you know what, 2010's, we are all about sex. And honestly I feel quite a few songs off this album could be used for Hot Girl Summer to this day.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this song is why millennials like to be choked

**hikkaru** (10): a banger for the ages and some of the most iconic lyrics of her career

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this playing on the radio while i was 12 is what made me gay

**lipe18090** (10): Second best song of the year

**nootnoot781** (10): iconique

**plastichaxan** (10): kind of insane how so many songs here shaped me in different ways i will not elaborate

**sage** (10): slay cunt mama yassing

**Stryxen** (10): ESS ESS ANDDDDD EM EM EM ESS ESS ANDDDDD

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): remember when this MV was banned everywhere lmao

**teenwitches** (10): how this got past radio censors is beyond me, but it had all the boomers in shambles for months

**throwaway7650** (10): why was I so eager to watch the 18+ MV for this as a 10-year old

**TiltControls** (10): perfection

**UselessTacooo** (10): When I think of Rihanna, I think of this song. I remember learning about what this song actually meant and losing it because I was singing along in the car when it came on and I was a kid

**vayyiqra** (10): Many of you are too young for me to be comfortable with you listening to this at the time it came out! Let the adults here listen to Rihanna's horny bangers. nah I'm jk anyway this is a banger

**wavingwolves** (10): it's so crazy to think bdsm didn't exist before this song

**xavieryes** (10): i literally discovered what BDSM was because of this song lol

**hielord** (9.6): i feel like a leather daddy

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I'm already predicting the horny people of this sub will put this on the top 3

**Awkward\_King** (9): ill be honest id rather other songs win to this just because i enjoy listening to them more but god this is a banger and it is so well made

**duochromepalmtree** (9): she really had everyone, their mother, and their grandmother, singing “chains and whips excite me.” THATS what a hit song is.

**macnbee** (9): did anyone else watch like 80 billion naruto amvs to this song or is it just me

**thePotatofairyy** (9): Hooks galore. Right from the start. Her delivery is perfectly impacted and sultry without going overboard.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Your lying if you said that this didn't go over your head as a kid.

**waluigiest** (9): long live 13 year olds learning what s&m is with no understanding of sex or nuance

**outsideeyess** (8.6): a lil overplayed for me to get excited about it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Verses and bridge are kinda boring but GIRL WHEN THAT CHORUS KICKS IN.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Her biggest hit from this, it's aged about as well as you'd think. Really fun and catchy but not sexy in any way, which is sad b/c bdsm IS sexy :/

**nyoom** (8): rihanna is in top form but...i mean, there are interesting, insightful, sensitive things to be said about the appeal and experience of s&m, and not one of them is in this song. also i think i first heard this song in the "Dad On Board" ad for the renault samsung SM3 and i think that's hilarious: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HZUVDzu20Lo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ass ass ass and ham ham ham

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Back when I was a teenager, we had music that actually MEANT something, like S&M by Rihanna!!

## manifesting Fenty Furniture

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Ok lemme confess something....I really do not like this song. IMO, this song is responsible for the sex metaphor galore and half assed filler that plagued most of Talk That Talk. If this y'all's choice then...fine but I can't say I like it at all.

**jsonphile** (6.5): okay hot as hell but gets a little annoying

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): These lyrics are like if you asked a 7th grader to write a sex jam

**xavieryes** (10.091): Been a while since I've listened to Loud and I wasn't expecting to give it straight 10s, but even the tracks I remember being somewhat lukewarm on turned out to be incredible on this relisten so what can I do

**moooo566** (9.273): this is easily the most stacked album in the rate, ive never really listened to it all in one before but holy shit its good

**skargardin** (9.091): It took me a while to start appreciating this whole album due to everyone always shitting on her albums pre-ANTI, it really is a solid album with some absolute classics.

**AHSWeeknd** (9.091): You can now purchase this album on a re-issued vinyl for only $100,000!

**akanewasright** (8.891): Rihanna OWNED this era. Like… I was a kid and even I knew people who died their hair Rihanna red. This was one of the first ERAS I was really aware of, even though I wasn’t actively following pop music at the time. It felt like Rihanna could not miss. Every song on the radio was excellent, and upon rediscovering the full album, I’m pleased that a few of the other songs are just as good. There are a few weaker tracks, but when all 6/7 singles and a few deep cuts are good on an 11 track album, a few weak tracks aren’t much of an issue

**apatel27** (8.545): As an album it sucks but as individual songs it’s peak pop Rihanna

**lipe18090** (8.391): One of Rihanna's best albums FOR SURE

**jman457** (8.373): The first album that I ever owned, so it will always have a special place in my heart. Still slaps hard

**throwaway7650** (8.364): solid album, I've only heard half of rihanna's discography (this, GBBB, rated R, anti) and would rank this last tbh but that just shows how rihanna isn't just a singles artist at all. I don't love all the singles but they're all iconic. now give us R9 pls rih we've been waiting for more than 5 years atp

**TiltControls** (8.273): Not my favourite Rihanna album, but definitely one of her best. While Rihanna's strengths have historically been with her singles, there are a lot of solid album tracks to be found here.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.091): The way I haven't listened to any other Rihanna album, but I just know that this would be my favorite or, if not, in my top 3 at least. This album is weird for me though because there are a lot of meh songs, but then other songs are so good that they make up for the meh songs. Overall though it's a great album. I'm definitely gonna put this on when I feel nostalgic for the 2010's. And I think this might be an unpopular opinion, but I think that this is my favorite album from this rate.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.927): for an era of pop that didn't age so well, there are some pretty good track on this album that still hold up

**IIIHenryIII** (7.909): This is a great playlist of bops with a couple of awful songs. It doesn’t feel like an album at all. Somehow this still manages to be her second best “album”? She is the true definition of a singles artist, isn't she?

**jsonphile** (7.909): Easily my favorite album here and my favorite artist of the four. And although there are a few songs or parts of songs that sound very dated, overall it’s aged more nicely than the other albums. Probably Rihanna’s second best album after Anti. And umm…let’s just say that middle school boy me reeeeally liked these music videos

**plastichaxan** (7.909): I feel like Rihanna improved from album to album and this just proved how much she could do in terms of music and aaaa i just love her so much i think in general she’s one of the most interesting musician careers i’ve ever followed i miss you Rihanna please come back-

**nooodisaster** (7.818): The way she named her album Loud and then half these songs are midtempo midvolume tracks. I could never forgive her.

**fadedblue09** (7.773): Easily my favorite album of the four, Rihanna really demonstrated vocal growth in this album, which makes it stand out amidst all the obnoxious early 10s production choices. Though I disagree with the consensus that this is her best album pre-ANTI. While there’s nothing wrong with incohesive, “singles collection” type of albums, unfortunately not all of the tracks here exhibit single-worthy quality. In Loud’s case, there are thankfully just a few, but this would become a big problem for her next two albums.

**waluigiest** (7.727): I think this album is underrated. There’s fluff, but the singles are all solid to great and Skin is one of her best album cuts.

**hielord** (7.445): This album is short, straight to the point, and horny. Just how I like my men. The first part of the album is far stronger than the second part, but the whole album (and specially its singles) still hold up today as sexy anthems. Rihanna doing what she knows best, I really miss the Avon lady.

**hikkaru** (7.273): this is a nice album and i totally get why people say it's rihanna's best pre-anti, i think unfortunately a couple of the singles aren't really for me and there's some misses in the bsides - however i do love s&m and only girl with all my heart and would love if one of them came through with the win

**vayyiqra** (7.182): I will never fully "get" Rihanna. Don't get me wrong, I like her; she has many songs I like. However I'm never going to be a stan (do we still call them the Navy?) or be frustrated over R9 never coming out. If you love her music, great! It's better than two other albums in this rate! I just don't have much to say.

**anothertown** (6.909): this is really..singles

**celladonn** (6.864): I really like the variety, all the tracks on this album sound very distinct from each other. There are a couple of duds but it's a solid album

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.091): The range of quality on this album is WILD. It’s probably one of the least cohesive records I’ve ever heard. I can definitely see what people mean when they say Rihanna used to be a singles artist cause… yeah I’ll take ANTI over this any day.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.727): has some very high highs and some very low lows. probably the most inconsistent album in the rate but i did enjoy it regardless

**sage** (5.664): no because this album is actually so insanely overrated ..... rihannas worst other than her first 2 easily

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.591): This was my first time listening to this album in full and while there are some amazing singles on it it’s not great. The back of this thing is pretty weak.

TiltControls: Great hosting Bee, Sean, and RC!!! Hosting was top notch with some amazing shitposts and hints in there and the banners were amazing!

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates coming!

#**Songs**

* Well looks like **Rihanna** finally got her rate win! (not counting the videography rate). Sad that it's taken her this long, but **S&M** is a deserving winner for sure. It takes the spot as Rihanna's highest scoring song and across all songs it places in the top 100 highest scores at 66th (only 0.001 point behind rerate Into You and 0.001 point ahead of the first TD / Animal rate winner, Bad Romance). Also here's how the other 9+ songs line up:

 * **Only Girl in the World:** 135th
 
 * **Teenage Dream:** 154th

 * **TiK ToK:** 160th

 * **Super Bass:** 174th

* **TiK ToK** and **California Gurls** also place on the most times rated list; with TiK ToK moving up to 5 rates (tying it with Closer and Call Me Maybe) and California Gurls joining with 4

* **Roman's Revenge** has quite the performance. It lands in the top 10 most controversial songs at 9th (tied with Madonna's American Pie cover). Also gets on another list with the 14th most 0's at 20 (also tying it with Jewels N' Drugs and This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things. Funny enough, both were also from ultimate rates)

 * **Peacock** wasn't polarizing enough to get on the board for controversy, but it still comes close in 35th across all songs

* With 0.005 seperating the two, **Bottom's Up/Starstrukk** becomes the narrowest bonus rate win/loss (though technically the closest bonus rate winner was the double win of Hanson and Midnight Oil since they had the exact same score). Ignoring that case, it takes the previous record of Scared to Be Lonely winning over [One Kiss](https://c.tenor.com/EF8ZqiWOM6UAAAAC/dua-lipa-dancing.gif) by 0.013 points

#**Artists**

* Despite only rating two of her albums (and not having a win yet), **Nicki** now takes the solo lead as the artist that has appeared in the most rates at 19 (she was previously tied for the lead with Taylor). **Rihanna** moves up to 18 and takes Nicki's previous spot, now tied for 2nd with Taylor. **Katy** moves up to 7th with 16 and **Kesha** and **Kanye** both make the board by moving up 10th with 15 appearances each.

* As noted above, it's been a long time coming for Rihanna. She makes a new record of 'most rates before winning' participating in 17 other rates before finally winning this one. Though Nicki could take this record if she ever pulls off a win.

* In terms of pure songs, Katy now moves in 6th with 91 songs rated, Rih is 7th with 89, Kesha is in 9th with 84 (Nicki is 17th with 60 for reference)

Like 2020 DAP we've all rated everyone before, but of course some changes are coming 

* **Kesha:** 167th out of 277 artists with 7.368 (previously 171st)

 * Below: 2NE1 (166th by 0.003 points)

 * Above: Camila Cabello (168th by 0.009 points)

* **Rihanna:** 185th out of 277 artists with 7.237 (previously 201st)

 * Below: Bleachers (184th by 0.012 points)

 * Above: Imagine Dragons (186th by 0.001 points)

* **Nicki:** 224th out of 277 artists with 6.993 (previously 209th)

 * Below: Misterwives (223rd by 0.007 points)

 * Above: Jess Glynne (225th by 0.025 points)

* **Katy:** 234th out of 277 artists with 6.887 (previously 237th)

 * Below: T-Pain (233rd by 0.003 points)
