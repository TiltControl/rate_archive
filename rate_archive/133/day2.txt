**bigbigbee** (10): I Have No Way To Prove This But I Think That Kpop Composers Heard This And Took Significant Inspiration

**seanderlust** (6.5): nicki really was talking about tight holes in 2010...ahead of her time. that being said, girl WHAT is the end of that verse miss minaj :skull:

---

## The Weather Girls

**Awkward\_King** (10): why do i have to be gay

**endcreditouilles** (10): nicki bragging about having the tightest hole AND ending a man's life in the same sentence, what a wild ride

**fadedblue09** (10): This is what I expect most of Pink Friday to sound like

**jman457** (10): Mega bop

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The Weather Girls outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (9): The other person ruined this tbh

**sage** (9): camp

**UselessTacooo** (9): I used to think this was terrible, but over time it’s grown on me and I find it really catchy. Nicki’s verse is also great.

**waluigiest** (9): Rihanna’s verse is stunning and it’s a classic Pink Friday-era Nicki verse. So it’s a successful song.

**Stryxen** (8.5): ay ay ay ay ay ay ay ay

**1998tweety** (8): fat bitches

**daythreeinmiami** (8): I was literally about to start singing 'Ass' by Big Sean. We see where he got inspired from. This song is for sure a product of its time and I love that. It goes hard. This is for sure a hype pre drinking song. Bad bitches only y'all.

**wavingwolves** (7.8): nicki is usually the best part of the songs she features on but not this one

**akanewasright** (7.5): This song didnt age super well (production wise), but it still bops ~~and this is one of Nicki’s most fun verses in the rate~~

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , okay?

**apatel27** (7): Nicki popped off

**awhile2** (7): what an era in pop rap it was when every other song had some obnoxious yet super catchy beat like this

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she really rhymed catfishes with fat bitches huh

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this song is absolutely a mess but god it’s fun

**nootnoot781** (7): “cause it’s a raining men, fat bitches” was that NECESSARY???/

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): Fly is the superior collaboration between them. This is just too noisy and messy sounding, the production isn’t great

**nyoom** (6): we already had a perfect raining men song

## The Sports Boys

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): ngl i kinda hate this chorus

**TiltControls** (6): The way the Rih x Nicki collab on Loud is my lowest score and the Nicki x Rih collab on PF is my highest

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): The low score isn't even because of Nicki, I just don't like the song.

**Uberpigeon** (6): minus points for evoking a much better song

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): Ngl, Nicki features in 2010 tended to make a song more interesting but this is kinda limp

**nooodisaster** (5): offensive to the weather girls

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i'm afraid the weather girls heavily outsold

**throwaway7650** (5): streets are saying ariana/selena/teddy/etc.  were inspired by this song for ice cream (wait not lisa being the nicki then I-)

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): “Anyway RiRi, what rhymes with your name?” ajsksjlajlk

**anothertown** (4): I expect to at least hear the weather girls in the beatsense

**jsonphile** (4): okay pretty much the only song on the album I don’t like. Would be a bit higher if the production wasn’t so annoying and dated

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Ass ass ass ass ass Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass Ass ass ass ass ass ass ass ass

**macnbee** (4): NEXT

**metanoira** (4): weather girls outsold

**celladonn** (2.5): The Weather Girls outsold. And WHAT does Nicki's fat bitches line even mean

**astrologicalangel** (2): ...no

**ImADudeDuh** (2): oh ok, I was wondering where the bad songs on this album were.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): Some of the songs in this rate make me very nostalgic for this period of music. Other make me glad that we moved on. This is in the latter category.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i really considered giving this my 0 that chorus? prechorus? the eenie meenie miney mo part is so unpleasant to the ears

**bigbigbee** (6): Open your eyes...your eyes are open

**seanderlust** (6): this song did not need to make the final album cut imo. the production and emotion of the song get a little...farrah abraham-y at times

---

## 20/20 Vision

**SideBTrack8** (11): im sure this will be robbed but idc! such a good song

**wavingwolves** (11): emotional autotune is my favourite genre of music

**IIIHenryIII** (10): just so you know, this is an 11

**letsallpoo** (10): animal is a surprisingly good album to stream when you're sad

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): ableist bop!!

**throwaway7650** (10): me seeing animal's results if keshanators don't show up en masse

**akanewasright** (9.5): This song honestly feels a lot more like… real? than most of the album. Like it’s still over the top and hard edged, but this kinda fleshes out the Ke$ha persona as something more than just hollow sleeziness

**UselessTacooo** (9): more electro ballads for me to fall in love with

**outsideeyess** (8.8): such a good chorus

**1998tweety** (8): ableist but it does bop....

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): Could be a Millionaires song and that's why I like it

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): s[he] be[lie]ve[d]

**Iris3271** (7.5): The autotune is.. a lot but I used to cry over my middle school crush to this

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): An acoustic version of this would be sooo good.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): me when I look at rate results I don't like

**apatel27** (7): bit too edm

**astrologicalangel** (7): I would love to hear a rock/pop punk cover of this

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this sounds like u + ur hand at stretches and those are my favorites

**thePotatofairyy** (7): A hidden gem I discovered through this rate. The best of the non trash pop songs.

**Uberpigeon** (7): this bridge is giving eight year old's diary entry

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): In an album of crazy party and party-adjacent songs, this track surprisingly stands out for being NOT attention-grabbing. But I actually like it quite a bit! She finally gets a chance to really show off her vocal skills

**waluigiest** (7): the beat dropping is so funny

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this is fun

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): kind of boring

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.4): This song was weirdly long for me despite being 3:17? And somewhat generic now that we're deeper into the album.

**daythreeinmiami** (6): There are defiantly better songs on this album. It just sounds like a generic he who must not be named production slapped together for the album.

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I feel like I remember this song but so awesome but on a revisit its just okay? I don’t remember it being so slow! And that bridge is a mess lol

**nyoom** (6): out of context the line "you must be blind if you can't see" is hilarious https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/001/593/peopledie.jpg/

## I can't see a THING without my glasses!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): the verse's are boring but the chorus picks up at least

**AHSWeeknd** (5): “you must be blind if you can’t see” such intelligence

**frogaranaman** (5): it's fine. couldn't really make anything interesting out about it but whatever

**sage** (5): okay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Deaf.

**nooodisaster** (4): I forgot this song existed. And in like 20 minutes I will again.

**jman457** (3.8): Abelist language is not cool luv

**Stryxen** (2): girl i am bored

**fadedblue09** (1): Tries to be empowering but honestly it sounds pathetic

**ReallyCreative** (11): Yeah I'm not thrilled with this placement but Circle the Drain, despite holding the crown for exactly one ballot (mine), was never in contention to win. It even had a stretch in day 1 that it fortunately recovered from. This is still my favorite Katy Perry song by a significant margin, but apparently I am damn near alone in that sentiment!

**seanderlust** (10): miss perry went OFF with this one. I kind of love angry katy - you can really feel the sincerity in her voice on this one

**bigbigbee** (7): This song is so close to really good for me, but I just want her to go that SMIDGE further. I wish the chorus had more of a crazy melody, or maybe less restraint, or something.

---

## Bubble bath takers

**joeeswift** (11): best song on the album. I wish more people appreciated it instead of disregarding the album tracks as filler

**anothertown** (10): finally something new to add to my 2000s dance-punk playlist

**Awkward\_King** (10): aaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**CrimsonROSET** (10): is this a katy perry song with an ounce of edge holy shit

**wavingwolves** (10): if you ever think "i can fix him" please just listen to the wise words of katy in this song

**xavieryes** (10): E.T. and Last Friday Night were promotional singles before being proper singles and charted in the Hot 100 in 2010, just like this song, before both became huge hits in 2011, so ever since 2011 I've had a theory that this would've hit #1 if it were the sixth single instead of The One That Got Away, and I still stand by it to this day

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): This feels more like it belongs from the One of the Boys era, but I'm not complaing because it's great

**outsideeyess** (9.1): this was classic One of the Boys Katy saying hi on Teenage Dream, and I'm here for it. the lyrics are heartbreaking

**1998tweety** (9): she served cunt here

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): i wish she'll make more songs like this.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this honestly may be her most underrated song. It also is cool that she has an obviously personal song when a lot of this album is pretty broad

**nooodisaster** (9): Some clunky lyrics can't take away from the raw emotion Katy delivers on this. Rock always was a secret strength of hers, and this immaculately produced pop-rock is a brilliant example of that. Also she just goes IN over and over on this guy, like damn love that for her.

**sage** (9): this is great but why does this entire album sound like it was recorded, mixed, and mastered on a toaster

**TiltControls** (9): by far the best non-single on the album

**UselessTacooo** (9): One of the only good non-singles. She really shouldn’t have abandoned the pop-rock sound on Prism, because I think she could have gotten even more success with it. This song deserved to be a single.

**jman457** (8.8): Probs the best deep cut, she was mad as hell

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): Travie McCoy found penniless

**hikkaru** (8.5): so scathing... i kinda forgot this was an actually good bside on this album

**awhile2** (8): most underrated song on the album even if it sounds a bit out of place production-wise

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): can we add this song to the "what songs should have been singles" conversation

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Is it just me or does this sound like it could be a Lady Gaga song?

**Uberpigeon** (8): she said fuck !

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): This is my guilty pleasure. I am desperately begging for a Katy Perry pop punk album

**waluigiest** (8): stay away from her! get a job!

**hielord** (7.5): I've only heard this deep cut a few times and I didn't remember it was actually good lmao

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): bring back pop/rock katy!!!!

**2dina3dworld** (7): this used to be my favourite song on the album when I was a kid, and I don’t know why? Possibly because it was the edgiest thing I’d heard at the time, although now it sounds like Camp Rock compared to what I’d consider “edgy” now.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): That breakdown before the outro is great production. But overall it’s such an odd song for this album.

**akanewasright** (7): This is a good sound for Katy, and parts of this work really well, but it’s just clunky enough in parts that it takes me out of it.

**apatel27** (7): Would hit harder if she could match the tone with her voice

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Can’t deny that guitar slaps though but damn this song is so dark lyrically and is a real slap in the face from the cotton candy vibe of this album.

**nootnoot781** (7): soccer mommy outsold

**shhhneak** (7): Did I fucking stutter?

**emayzee** (6.5): soccer mommy outsold

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I think a lot of gays have a distinct memory of listening to the line "you fall asleep during foreplay cuz the pills you take are more your forte" at the age of 13/14 in the backseat of their family's car on a road trip feeling like they've never related to anything more in their lives

**BeauMeringue212** (6): The line about her drugged up partner falling asleep during foreplay is hysterical on an album that was targeted at children

**Iris3271** (6): She kinda sounds like Gaga in this

**plastichaxan** (6): outsold soccer mommy

## Travie McCoy alt accounts

**endcreditouilles** (5.6): this song is for those "I can fix him" bitches

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): Definitely not my favorite song with this title but I’m on board with her dragging this man to filth.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): The bridge is a little weird. Otherwise it's weird lyrically. I think it's a pretty hollow "breakup" song.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): that just ain't it, she sounds so constrained

**macnbee** (5): honestly I really appreciate the f bombs but it's only ok

**throwaway7650** (5): "I heard she put out a song that’s about me, or about some old habits or whatever... I look at it like this: I’m just stoked that she finally has a song with some substance on her record. Good job." - Travie McCoy

**duochromepalmtree** (4.5): this song was paid absolute dust by the GP and that’s for a reason: it sounds like a song from that one Kelly Clarkson album everyone hated. Lots of strange production choices throughout.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Sounds like a leftover demo from OOTB

**frogaranaman** (4): me to my bath bomb while I'm draining the bath tub

**nyoom** (4): soccer mommy scrubbed this drain clean

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): my garageband song i made when i was 12 sounded like this

**Stryxen** (3): terrible, actually offensive to soccer mommys everywhere

**TheQueenOfVultures** (3): This just feels kinda mean

**ImADudeDuh** (2): how do you fall asleep during foreplay

**vayyiqra** (2): This is musically okay but the lyrics are edgy and just Not It. That line about foreplay has strong "I'd Rather Die" energy. This tries to portray Katy as a sassy girlboss who is scolding a dude, but it comes across as bashing him for being a drug addict. Awful.

**seanderlust** (6.2): I don't really like the effects on the second verse also i think i downloaded an early version of this song that had her saying "shut your fucking mouth" instead of "you never shut your mouth" so the version that's on streaming now always throws me for a loop. it's fine though

---

## Fencing champions

**awhile2** (11): - literally a top 5 song of all time for me

**Stryxen** (10): banger

**UselessTacooo** (10): I really love the production on this. A lot of the album has the issue of dated production, but this track is really catchy. Also I really love her vocal delivery

**duochromepalmtree** (9.5): if you’ve never had a friend breakup that made you able to relate to this song you are very blessed

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): I can't decide whether this is honey's sleazy sister or bad blood's older sister

**1998tweety** (9): BAWP

**hielord** (9): the production -chef kiss- and wasn't touched by Dr L*ke at all omg

**wavingwolves** (8.9): why did taylor write bad blood if she could just have quoted this on twitter or something

**daythreeinmiami** (8.5): I really appreciate that this song exists. I actually had a girl who I lived with at uni who was like this with me. I literally learned things about myself that I did not know through other people. Was a wild time. It really made this song hit harder.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): petty!Kesha is a fairly rare side but oooo it's a good one. she gets so specific and name-drops the hoe; your fav could never.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): This would be a 7 but I relate to the lyrics a little to much.

**2dina3dworld** (8): this is the sort of petty bullshit I need to post to Facebook to shade people with

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): for all of my exes

**Awkward\_King** (8): me to all my friends who've seen me looping sufjan on the spotify friends bar and havent reached out to me

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the horns are awesome but i wish the song was less repetitive

**vayyiqra** (8): This is "Kiss N Tell, but better".

**jman457** (7.6): Great production

**sage** (7.5): fun

**throwaway7650** (7.5): olivia rodrigo could NEVER ~~traitor is better actually~~

**akanewasright** (7): Yeah this song is fun but sometimes it veers a bit too hard into being cruel for my tastes

**thePotatofairyy** (7): Makes me nostalgic for middle school drama when my friend dedicated this song to someone else

**waluigiest** (7): it’s so busy and a lot of it works

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): This is a mess but it’s a catchy mess.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Surprisingly one of the least annoying tracks on this album. Would still never listen to this by choice though.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): YOU'RE SUCH A BACKSTABBER is super catchy

**skargardin** (6): something about this chorus sounds off to me

## Et tu, Brutus?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this sounds like a song taylor swift wouldve written in 1989 era

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The intro reminds me of AJR and it makes me so mad

**ignitethephoenix** (4.5): eh not feeling this one as much

**celladonn** (4): The chorus is pretty grating

**nyoom** (3.5): with some reworking this could be fun, coupla punchlines, maybe a sample of that line "my mommy says my daddy's eyes are brown because he is so full of sh—"

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Kesha has come a long way in terms of music quality

**BeauMeringue212** (1): for an, albeit vague, diss track, it lacks energy and power. Chorus is flat af too

**frogaranaman** (1): I'm doing this rate while sick with the flu and I'm pretty sure this song just made my flu headache about 10x worse

## she asks Jeannie why she had to tell these secrets about K$'s sex life, so technically...

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): For some reason I feel like this song passes the Bechdel test

**seanderlust** (8.3): so uplifting! the decision to be so light with harmonies on katy's voice is an interesting one that I think adds something to the final mix

**ReallyCreative** (7): Perhaps the most prominent elimination so far, I knew that Firework would get lukewarm reception, but I was pretty surprised at just how poorly this song did overall. Not even really coming close to a day 3 finish either! Very surprising for one of the biggest songs of the rate!

**bigbigbee** (6.5): When I was in high school I was like OMG.......PWOGWESSIVE but now I think it's kind of cheesy

## Fourth of July celebrations

**1998tweety** (10): omg that pre-chorus into the chorus, i ascend everytime just like she did in the video

**2dina3dworld** (10): do you ever feel like a plastic bag? Yes, it’s called being depressed

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): you made me realize that I should be proud of me but unfortunately, I still feel like a collection of plastic bags drifting through a thick dog of confusion.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Wow this album has really had a perfect four track run so far I hope the next song on the tracklist doesn’t derail that. Anyway fuck patriotism, the Fourth of July is just an excuse to listen to this and Carrie & Lowell on repeat.

**davgonp** (10): Obligatory ten despite the plastic bag.

**fadedblue09** (10): On a technical level, this song has all the ingredients of a trainwreck (terrible vocals, terrible songwriting, generic production) and yet the end product feels.... perfect?? What sorcery is this, Katheryn?

**IIIHenryIII** (10): no, I've never felt like that. People who have already felt like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again, what does it feel like to feel like a plastic bag drifting through the wind wanting to start again?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the plastic bag video is a top 10 music shitpost

**metanoira** (10): gay rights and jackie cox's lip sync

**Sfbby** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rNYaw4EJpZo

**throwaway7650** (10): ok firework isn't that good but I have to give it a 10 because in 5th grade I was a part of the regional all-stars orchestra and I was going to play this song for the first concert of the year but then I had to move in the middle of the year and I remember asking the if I could keep the sheet music because there were only 4 people (3 violinists) in orchestra at my elementary school vs. there being actual sections in the all-stars orchestra and I was like "wtf is a 2nd violin" (those strings you hear throughout? that could've been me) when I first got my seat/sheet music so it's sentimental for me #sorry

**TiltControls** (10): The lyrics are a bit cheesy, but it's hard not to bop along

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a "bop"! My oddly specific memory of this song is being in a minivan while this was on the radio. I was with a friend on New Year's in 2012 and her mom was picking us up. This was prophetic since Katy is now "mom-pop" (joke). Plastic bag.

**xavieryes** (10): cancelled for promoting plastic pollution

**shhhneak** (9.5): This is the anthem for basic bitches but you cannot deny it’s a classic. The Super Bowl version still gives me chills.

**hielord** (9.2): omg THE gay awakening song, born this way who?

**hikkaru** (9): not actually that good just nostalgic etc etc

**ignitethephoenix** (9): we all make fun of “do you ever feel like a plastic bag” but I can confirm as a teenager, she understood me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): remember when this MV was banned in some countries bc 2 guys kissing

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): do you ever feel like a plastic bag! because you're a piece of trash!! live your dreams babe!!

**jsonphile** (8.5): this song isn’t as inspiring as it thinks it is, but it is a pretty solid song just for the production alone

**outsideeyess** (8.2): loved it a lot more 10 years ago, but it just got old for me

**TheQueenOfVultures** (8): The grip this song has on Kindergarten graduations, Katy planning for the future

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Why does she sound like she's fifteen in this song?

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): The national anthem of the United States

**waluigiest** (8): literally the state of gay rights in 2010

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): do you ever feel like a plastic bag, like a plastic bag, like a plastic bag, like a plastic bag, like a plastic bag

**apatel27** (7): lots of metaphors, a lot of which suck

**moooo566** (7): its better than roar (6) but its still a bland motivational poster dressed up in an inexplicably popular pop song

**plastichaxan** (7): the hold the video for this had on little me watching the 0.1 second gay kiss is insane

**teenwitches** (7): this is way more dated than i remembered it being, that awful club beat is so specifically 2010 it hurts

**akanewasright** (6): Honestly I think this song is good, and that the plastic bag line is honestly fine, it’s just… this was one of the first songs I learned to play on my guitar, and I have had to sing it so many times as a crowd pleaser to the point that I am *done* with it. Like it is a half decent song, but my god I want it out of my life

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): So it's a corny song, yes. But I think the core melody is actually really nice and Katy carries it nicely. Some of the strings and instrumentals nowadays does sound pretty cheap.

**daythreeinmiami** (6): pls add me to the list of users who comment DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE A PLASTIC BAG DRIFTING THROUGH THE WIND WANTING TO START AGAIN!1!!!!11!!1

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I am not a fan of forced positivity songs but next to Happy this is probably one of the most iconic ones.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): why did i use to think this was the most inspirational song of all time

seanderlust: ## those two weeks after the Fourth where my neighbors STILL SHOOT OFF FIREWORKS for some godforsaken reason

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this is shake it off but katy perry tried to be serious about it

**frogaranaman** (5): is this the white culture people always talk about

**nooodisaster** (5): Even when this one was huge I was only a moderate fan, and it's plummeted in time. I'm glad people got value from this but to me it's cringey to pretend a multi-millionaire cares about me or my life beyond what profit I can generate for them.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): these vocals are so bad in hindsight

**Uberpigeon** (5): when i was like eleven i thought this music video was the most touching and beautiful thing i'd ever seen

**jackisboredtoday** (4.5): hated this song for so long. “empowering” katy is the worst katy

**emayzee** (4.2): god i'm so glad we seem to have moved past this era of inspirational power pop

**anothertown** (4): i never realized how much repetition and simple vowel sounds are in this, like for babies

**macnbee** (4): never got the hype but we do love a plastic bag metaphor

**sage** (4): going into this rate i thought this would be my 0 but its nowhere near as bad as i remember

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): is it iconic? Yes. Should it be? No

**Awkward\_King** (3): i fear this is a victim of overplay, but then again i never tired of any of the first three tracks, i think i just find firework grating, the chorus is really like..,., tiring and cheesy, the verses are cute enough

**BeauMeringue212** (3): There are a lot of pop songs about some vague sense of empowerment, and this is one of them I guess

**nootnoot781** (3): okok so i remember watching the music video when i was about 10? and it was the first time i saw a gay couple and i was like why am i feeling like this???? i had to leave the room because it felt so weird. so yeah i think katy perry made me gay, or at least made me realise it, so uh thanks? she could’ve done it with a better song though

**Saison\_Marguerite** (3): Katy tried to recreate Christina Aguilera’s Beautiful but for balladphobes, and while I respect the effort, it did not land for me. I really do not like the production on this, the muddy EDM beat on the chorus gives Katy’s vocal no room to breathe. And even the plastic bag line is not as camp as I once thought, American Beauty is an overrated movie

**wavingwolves** (3): the most relevant thing brought by this song was this video

**Stryxen** (2): why did i only just realise i hate this song lmao the plastic bag line is a whole 11 tho

**cremeebrulee** (0): this whole genre of "motivational" anthems is rarely done in a way that isn't corny. also fuck this song for terrorzing the radio 10 years ago, i genuinely never want to hear it again.

**jman457** (0): Also pretty dated that thinks it says alot without saying anything at all.

## Pokemon Go to the polls!

**nyoom** (8.5): this has like hilary clinton campaign level lean in energy but i still like it

## That's her singing bestie x

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She makes a weird noise after one of third “boom”’s

**bigbigbee** (10): As I understand it, this was maybe a late cut from the Pop Rap rate in June? If that’s the case, I’m so glad we were able to pick it up for this bonus rate. I love everything about this: I love Drake’s verse, I love the plinky synths. I love how unabashedly fun it is. That tongue-in-cheek cheesiness was just part of the joy of 2010.

##Mr. Flinstone

**Awkward\_King** (10): idk

**duochromepalmtree** (10): iconic

**emayzee** (10): would give this an 11 if i could

**frogaranaman** (10): I got the flu to this song this weekend !

**grey/0x976** (10): ok i get it let me think i guess its my turn

**ignitethephoenix** (10): literally paved the way for the 2010’s, you just had to be there

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): best lyrics, best chorus honestly wish this was in the main rate so i could give it 11

**akanewasright** (9.5): Hmm this song is incredible

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): a keystone in pop culture

**davgonp** (9.2): Were some things easier back then?

**anothertown** (9): bedrock is post-good

**awhile2** (9): i always thought nicki’s egg white line was a sexual innuendo (probably because the pitbull egg white line in hotel room is an innuendo and it came out around the same time)

**celladonn** (9): This song is my little meow meow

**thePotatofairyy** (9): A 2010s classic

**waluigiest** (9): some verses are great, some are truly terrible, but they’re all legendary.

**wavingwolves** (8.6): it took me an embarrassingly long time (a full minute) for me to understand what this was about and i'm a grown adult

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): stupid in the best way. I know Wayne, Drake, Nicki & Gudda Gudda’s verses by heart, and the chorus has just the right kind of stupid charm

**2dina3dworld** (8): Pink Friday was an album for Gen Zers (this is like the third song I’ve recognised from Tik tok by Nicki)

**BeauMeringue212** (8): this gets a lot of sentimentality points from me tbh. This video felt like a big deal when it dropped

**IIIHenryIII** (8): is it bad that I still genuinely like this after all these years?

**macnbee** (8): definitely the best song that uses the word "asbestos"

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): I really can't give this song any higher than a 6 because every part of it is bad but that's what makes it good

**throwaway7650** (6): oh this is where that nicki verse is from [2] but I am #not a fan of lloyd's vocals on the chorus/hook I fear. nicki eats the men up btw, as usual

## idk was there like a dinkleburg or someone for the Flinstones? I never watched it tbh

**TiltControls** (5.5): my score is mid but let it be known that this is a lyrical masterpiece.

**endcreditouilles** (4): the feminine urge to put this pussy on your sideburns

**daythreeinmiami** (3): I’ve actually never listened to this song. My friend always kept pestering me to listen to it but I just never got around to it. But I guess finally 11 years later I have finally found some time. I didn’t really miss out on much.

**jsonphile** (3): this gets three points for Lil Wayne, Drake, and Nicki Minaj for actually being competent rappers, even if their verses here are very mediocre by their standards, they’re still leagues above anyone else here

**plastichaxan** (2.5): this would be a 1 without nicki wow

**apatel27** (2): All Young Money tracks suck

**AHSWeeknd** (1): are y’all sure we can’t give zero’s in the Bonus Rate?

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): This song was the culmination of many choices wasn’t it

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I hadn’t heard a fair bit of Animal (the album) before this rate, and I was really surprised and pleased with songs like this. Kesha is sometimes cheesy, even bordering on “cringe-y” with her lyricism, but something about her always seems so sincere to me that I appreciate it.

**seanderlust** (7): the abrupt change in energy between the first five songs and this one always takes me by surprise - who did this tracklisting? anyways, this is fine - as far as early ballad-y kesha songs, it works better than the other two imo.

---

## drinks a Pedialite, gets some pho and goes about their day

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an album highlight

**akanewasright** (10): This did more to humanize the abstract persona of “Ke$ha” than Stephen.

**apatel27** (10): The placement in the album is weird but a really heartfelt cry for help

**hikkaru** (10): NOW THE PARTY'S OVER AND EVERYBODY'S GONE I'M LEFT HERE WITH MYSELF AND I WONDER WHAT WENT WRONG 🗣️🗣️🗣️😿😿😿

**throwaway7650** (10): this is what katy thought the side tracks on TD sounded like

**wavingwolves** (9.5): i just love a good song about crashing down after a party and kesha had the best ones at that

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Wait why is this actually so sad?

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I'm all here for emo$ional Ke$ha

**TiltControls** (8.5): I know this era Kesha was known for her party style, but her slower songs on the album are seriously fantastic

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): Yeah I need more. Kesha you better have more songs like this I haven’t listened to.

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This is honestly such a beautiful song. That production in the verse is so good. It really is a Millennial ballad.

**macnbee** (8): the middle of this album reminds me so acutely of watching those mid-2000s lyric vids made in windows movie maker with comic sans font and pastel backgrounds

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I didn’t think it would be possible to fit a good ballad on this album but this is surprisingly high quality?

**fadedblue09** (7.5): A decent attempt at introspection but can she drop the whiny squirrel voice for once?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is pretty good was not expecting a mid tempo song showing her vocals here

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): not the best song here but it was a genius idea to make this concept the basis of the requisite ballad of the album

**BeauMeringue212** (7.2): her voice sounds good and a more downbeat song also helps vary the album too imo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): while kesha's speciality is fun songs, she really can make u feel alot of of emotions this song makes me want to cry

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): This is a decent ballad, but it's pretty underwhelming. I like the bittersweet singing and Kesha's singing.

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**CrimsonROSET** (6): someone thought they were SO clever writing hung-OVER YOU right

**nooodisaster** (6): You could imagine this song being a lot better if Kesha's lyrics were given softer/less generic production. But here we are.

**slimboyfriend** (6): Love the chorus. The rest is.....

## has to lie down in a dark room for HOURS

**sage** (5.8): i forgot how this sounded immediately after it ended

**duochromepalmtree** (5): I completely forgot this song existed and that’s for a reason lol. The first half of the album is SO FUN and this is just boring.

**nyoom** (5): i'd give Disgusting a 10 if it were here but being hungover is at least halfway disgusting so

**Uberpigeon** (5): ok for a uninspired ballady song this kind of gets a pass because its also a bit boppy

**vayyiqra** (5): Drink water after alcohol to avoid hangovers!

**waluigiest** (5): it’s close to being well written but it’s really not there. She has better ballads, like The Harold Song

**Stryxen** (4): oh no! rough night kesha? I hope you don’t have a party at a rich dude’s house next in the tracklist you need some rest!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): It’s not a banger. It’s not emotionally affecting. It’s just noise.

**frogaranaman** (2): plus one point for at least sonically representing how much a hangover sucks with how much this song sucks

**Awkward\_King** (1): .......

**bigbigbee** (9): What an opening. It feels like a good representation of what Nicki represented then - bravado and confidence that no one was doing it like she was. And who was, to be honest? Was she wrong?

**seanderlust** (6): a song that is supposed to be triumphant but just comes off a little flat, and that keeps playing for far too long

---

## Gold Medals

**Awkward\_King** (10): ur not but youre up there

**nooodisaster** (10): Still an explosive opener that sets the stage perfectly. The instrumentation is so joyous, her raps so of purpose, you couldn't help but get on her side in 2010.

**nyoom** (10): what can i say? it's the best

**sage** (10): slay opener.

**waluigiest** (10): lots of incredible moments but the best has to be her little ad-libs in the outro that just feel too close to the mic

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): damn, this is such a good song. It has the same vibe as "The Show Goes on", so it automatically gets a good score

**Stryxen** (9): got my hands in the air n shit

**thePotatofairyy** (9): Bold title to start your debut album and she fucking delivers

**1998tweety** (8.5): yeah you are

**akanewasright** (8): This production hasn’t aged well and the hook is weak but Nicki’s rapping is… kinda impeccable. Edit: oh… she mentioned her brother. Lemme dock half a point

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is a really good intro track. Big and braggadocios.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): its funny in hindsight just how focused nicki was in getting competition

**daythreeinmiami** (8): So we are going to just pretend the last 4 or so years in Nicki’s career haven’t occurred and just focus on what this album was in its moment in time. This song just makes me want to hustle for my success so I too can afford Jimmy Choo’s and so I can honestly just buy myself a house because my parents are baby boomers they have a house they are fine. I need a house.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Wait, this is actually so good.

**UselessTacooo** (8): It’s a fun song. I really love her flow on this, and overall is a pleasurable listen

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): That chorus… Nicki please… please… stick to rapping

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): Wow, she named dropped Sydney instead of Melbourne, that's minus 1 point

**hikkaru** (7.5): 2ne1 mopped

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): She was so easy to root for when she was an underdog :(

**TiltControls** (7.5): when anyone says any line saying I'm the ______ there's only one thing I can think of: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4AYFk91_HtQ

**2dina3dworld** (7): she mentioned Australia but not New Zealand!!! I’m now a proud Nicki hater for that reason and that reason only /s

**anothertown** (7): to all my badd bitches i can see your halo <33

**duochromepalmtree** (7): Nicki is at her best when she’s just bragging tbh.

**macnbee** (7): it's good but did it on em should be the opener

**nootnoot781** (7): x 3 = 2NE1

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): eh based on this song you’d be upper mid tier, but not exactly the best.

**apatel27** (6): Nicki why are you singing randomly???

**babadork** (6): I loved this at the time, but it's depressing now.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): don’t look up who Micaiah and Jelani are

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): i get why it's the opener but easily the worst opener of the four

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): “im the best” sure jan

## Most Improved award

**fadedblue09** (5): Opening with such a limp track that unfortunately sets the bar for the rest of the album

**frogaranaman** (5): ironic that this song is mid

**skargardin** (5): Big words for a song so... mid

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): i'm pretty sure this rate will prove the exact opposite

**vayyiqra** (4): Dubious title given what's to come

**throwaway7650** (3.5): this sounds ridiculously cheap, where's the budget... the hell

**AHSWeeknd** (2): No you ain’t

**seanderlust** (8): rihanna's version of this song does improve on the original quite a bit, if only in order to get rid of some...questionable bars from em (window pane :peloton:). also, she adds a very nice bridge!

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I loved the original (me in high school: WINDOW PAIN?!?!? THIS IS PEAK LYRICISM) and I really like this one too. That chorus is classic.

**ReallyCreative** (1): I have never enjoyed a Rihanna-Eminem collab and this is no different

---

## The first page of our story

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I remember talking about the implications of this song in a sociology class but it didn’t change the fact that it’s a bop.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): a perfect continuation to a great song about abusive assholes that is miles better than that Chris Brown remix of her song.

**duochromepalmtree** (10): okay look this song totally glorified abusive relationships but it’s such a banger I’m sorry it just is.

**endcreditouilles** (10): oh yeah i definitely posted these lyrics as my facebook status whenever my high school crush did anything slightly wrong

**Iris3271** (10): This song is very personal to me, may Chris Brown suffer for what he did

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): better than the original I SAID IT also eminem's verse in this is better than part 1

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): I would honestly give this my 11 if it wasn't for the feature.

**UselessTacooo** (10): this version is far superior to the original one. The more Rihanna the merrier, and she sounds stunning on this. Also surprisingly, I don’t hate the Eminem verse (unlike another song in this rate).

**xavieryes** (10): it's been ages since I last listened to this and considering how much I'm still sick of the standard LTWYL I was ready to give this like a 5 or something, but turns out I really like it, much more than I remembered.

**1998tweety** (9.5): the Skylar Grey demo outsold but this is still great.

**akanewasright** (9.5): Thinking about how the industry spent years trying to make Skylar Grey a thing to repay her for this hook… honestly they spilled, this chorus could move mountains, and I LOVE the bridge

**shhhneak** (9.5): This didn’t need to exist but trot out that chorus and I’ll eat it up every time.

**apatel27** (9): Pulling out a good verse from modern Eminem is always worth celebrating

**CrimsonROSET** (9): perhaps my most embarrassing score this rate and i gave peacock a 10

**nooodisaster** (9): this was so DEEP in 2010. "even ninjas have their wicked schemes" sasuke when he turned evil.

**throwaway7650** (9): I'm a LTWYL apologist I fear

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): Eminem's energy COMPLETELY clashes with this song. However I think the rest of the song is so good and the chorus is unshakeable.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): i get goosebumps every time she goes shhhhhhh

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): for the record Eminem’s verse is the sole reason this isn’t a ten. the Piano version without him would have a slightly higher score than this. the wailing on “so maybe IIII’M a MAASOCHIIST” is So good

**jman457** (8.5): The best version

**jsonphile** (8.5): I mean it’s already better than part I just because it doesn’t have the line “guess that’s why they call it window pane”

**outsideeyess** (8.4): the better version, sorry to any homophobes named Marshall who might be reading this. thinking of Ariana's vocoder cover makes me want an A(rih)ana duet

**2dina3dworld** (8): I do like the vocal arrangement, but there’s something really off about the backing track. It’s not as raw and loud as the originals.

**awhile2** (8): eminem and rihanna collabs on rihannas albums > rihanna and eminem collabs on eminem albums

**vayyiqra** (8): We know, Em bad, but the hook is incredible.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Oh this isn’t the window pain one? I think I like this one better!

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Just realized that "Part II" on the title twice

**TiltControls** (7.5): That's nice but I still don't know if you're feeling window pain

**cremeebrulee** (7): if i had a nickel for every time a song in this rate would've been improved if eminem wasn't on it, i would ha

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I like Rihanna’s version of Love the Way You Lie more I think. It feels more emotional and vulnerable.

**macnbee** (7): people SLEEP on part II

**nyoom** (7): will the real slim shady sit back down

**plastichaxan** (7): this was going so lie and then eminem started rapping i hate it here

**RandomHypnotica** (7): Part 1 is iconic. Part 2 is... here.

**skargardin** (7): It doesn't compare to the original but it's by no means bad

**hielord** (6.9): It is a decent sequel ngl but it felt a bit short

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): in hindsight it is so wild that we rewarded Eminem for making an Important (tm) song about domestic violence

**ImADudeDuh** (6): im sorry but all late 00s/early 10s “part 2”s by the woman singing the chorus of a big rap hit are all just worse than the original.

**Uberpigeon** (6): when i was like 11 one time i sang this while walking home thinking a record producer would discover my unknown talent and make me a pop star

## guess that's why they call it window pain

**sage** (5.5): why does eminem always sound so fucking pissed omg calm down pls

**hikkaru** (5): iconic chorus ofc and rih taking the reigns is great but i literally can not stand eminem omfg he gives me hives

**wavingwolves** (5): i used to love this song and now i can barely get through it without wanting to skip

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Honestly I like the original but we definitely didn’t need this.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): at least we’re not rating part 1 i guess. wouldve been a very easy 0 if we were

**anothertown** (3): That's an awfully hot coffee pot Should I drop it on Donald Trump? Probably not But that's all I got 'til I come up with a solid plot Got a plan and now I gotta hatch it But we better give Obama props 'Cause what we got in office now's a kamikaze That'll probably cause a nuclear holocaust And while the drama pops And he waits for shit to quiet down, he'll just gas his plane up And fly around 'til the bombing stops Intensities heightened, tensions are risin' Trump, when it comes to givin' a shit, you're stingy as I am Except when it comes to havin' the balls to go against me, you hide 'em 'Cause you don't got the fuckin' nuts like an empty asylum Racism's the only thing he's fantastic for 'Cause that's how he gets his fuckin' rocks off and he's orange

**waluigiest** (3): I have no interest in this saga anymore, and I’m tired of rating both parts.

**Awkward\_King** (1): why does this so viscerally remind me of uk ex factor can someone explain (derogatory)

**frogaranaman** (1): yeah this sucks sorry

**teenwitches** (1): i got so sick of this collab 10 years ago and i'm still annoyed every time i'm subjected to it. abuse isn't cute.

**Stryxen** (0): eminem really outed himself as the type to punch a wall

**seanderlust** (9.3): smasher. banger. girlboss anthem. yes it's one of those pop songs that's vague so it's universally relatable but god it goes off

**bigbigbee** (5.5): The MV is army propaganda, which puts it in the good company of the Call of Duty games and most modern Marvel movies (even the good ones)

**ReallyCreative** (5): K-Mart brand Kelly Clarkson song

---

## feminists

**1998tweety** (10): feminist bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Military

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): empowerment that my closeted ass needed after a long and sad week at the aftermath of a break-up

**anothertown** (10): For intellectuals only

**throwaway7650** (10): the lyrics are corny but I quite like this song's production tbh

**fadedblue09** (9): What are the odds that this isn't the only song with "stick and stones" in its lyrics

**hikkaru** (9): i just wanna throw my phone away. can you reach me? no, you can't.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Me-eeh-eeh Ooh-ooh-ooh

**TiltControls** (9): the chorus is a little clunky, but I can't get over how much I love the verses

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): ok i hate to admit it but this goes off

**akanewasright** (8.5): reminder that the demo of this song pre-divorce had the lines “You can keep the dog for me, I never liked him anyway” instead of “you can keep the Diamond ring” etc etc

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I never knew this was Katy, it's very commercial-core

**hielord** (8.2): This way my 13-year old empowerment song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Damn I like this a lot more than I remember. She just didn’t miss at all with the singles from this era.

**daythreeinmiami** (8): I remember when this song was releases she had just divorced Russel Brand and I think she said that she had planned this song before the divorce and it was just a coincidence or am I just imagining that? Any who I always thought this song had a few similarities to ‘The One That Got Away’. The kick sounds similar and the bridges sound similar. I do love the ‘ahhhh’ vocal sounds in the chorus. This song was a really nice add on to Teenage Dream.

**endcreditouilles** (8): Katy really mastered the Motivational Lyrics Over House Beat genre

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.8): I think it's a fantastic chorus. Katy can write anthems!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): there’s not enough nostalgia her for me to overcoming the cheesiness unlike firework

**BeauMeringue212** (7): idk why but I always loved how the guitar riff sounded

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the boring power ballad part

**frogaranaman** (7): why did she join the military in this music video

**sage** (7): bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): like i don't rlly like this song but i've listened to it a fair bit so maybe i like it more than i think i do

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): The inferior complete confection single. I said what I said.

**UselessTacooo** (7): I despise that I like this. It’s a guilty pleasure

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s… acceptable? I’ve never really liked it that much tbh

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Honestly anyone could've recorded this, but it's kind of a banger

**Stryxen** (6.5): a bit of a bop

**xavieryes** (6.5): lol

**jman457** (6.4): Not a stand out in her discography

**Awkward\_King** (6): slayyyyy

**ImADudeDuh** (6): even as a 14 year old, I knew this was underwhelming

**nyoom** (6): things katy perry misunderstands: poison, how to talk about punching, the block function

## yvan eht nioj

**apatel27** (5): Girlboss

**jsonphile** (5): no other Katy Perry song evokes so little positive or negative emotion from me

**macnbee** (5): army propaganda in the video…not poggers

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): the music video for this is so corny like her boyfriend cheats on her so she becomes a war criminal???

**duochromepalmtree** (2): horrible. Catchy af though.

**thePotatofairyy** (1): I never liked this song. Sounds so uninspired. Sonically uninteresting, lyrically as substantial as Fight Song.

**Uberpigeon** (1): Live laugh love in the United States Armed Forces!

**nooodisaster** (0): soooo generic like it phyiscally hurts to listen to. ANYWAY, .** can choke fuck that man. do your best to not listen to songs he's produced or just st**l them like youtube to mp3 is still a thing and spotify has local files. theft is moral in an immoral economic system. for legal reasons this is parody.

**waluigiest** (0): hard flop. It’s a disgusting parody of the energy captured on Teenage Dream. It strips the album of all of its character and wit to create this bland empowerment song with no edges and no emotion. Additionally, the end of the bridge is one of the most egregious pronounce ME as MAY to fit a rhyme I’ve ever heard, right before a chorus full of proper MEs

**wavingwolves** (0): every time this played on the radio while i was going or coming back from school it made me want to throw myself out of the window

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): genderbent slut shaming is still slut shaming but like, it was somewhat refreshing having the tables turned for one song

**seanderlust** (6.5): the first of the "oh yeah, this song!" entries in this album. it's fine, i just don't feel particularly strongly about it one way or the other.

---

## team "i'm anti-slut shaming but this bops"

**Awkward\_King** (10): the production on this album is so like caricature bubblegum pop but kesha's like more aggressive and raunchy delivery is so complimentary to it, its such a cool dynamic and GOD it just bops

**duochromepalmtree** (10): if you thought starcrossed wasnt an angsty enough breakup album have you tried kiss n tell?

**hikkaru** (10): the way she absolutely bodied this bside it's immaculate should've been a single

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I live for these lyrics

**nooodisaster** (10): The shoulda been single of the album, I loved this song so much back in the day. Finding out Max Martin, Shellback, and .** ALL produced this song, wow I had expensive taste.

**plastichaxan** (10): so true queen slut shame him

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): throwback to when 14 year old me found out i was "the other woman" in 2010 and listened to this song religiously

**teenwitches** (10): this is what tramp stamps thought they were doing

**throwaway7650** (10): the bubblegum chorus omfg I've never yassed so hard. YASS

**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): This song makes me wanna get cheated on. Fun campy bubblegum pop. That high note layering in the final chorus is one of my favorite moments on the album

**1998tweety** (9): she was ahead of her time referring to men as sluts

**apatel27** (9): Goes hard. Both the beat and the vocals

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): This is the definiton of a banger! This beat is RELENTLESS! Also the instrumental kind of sounds video game-ish but in a great way.

**Iris3271** (9): The reverse slut-shaming chef's kiss

**RandomHypnotica** (9): this bridge is so 2010 in the best way possible

**outsideeyess** (8.9): i think i may have overplayed this one

**jman457** (8.3): Bop even today

**wavingwolves** (8.1): nothing brings me back to the early 10s faster than slutshaming

**akanewasright** (8): Some of these lyrics aged poorly, but it’s so bright and boppy

**sage** (8): smash

**Stryxen** (8): this is like arcade game music

**Uberpigeon** (8): super mario type beat

**waluigiest** (8): okay but with some reorchestration this could be an early Paramore single

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Calling your ex-bestie a slut over gameboy bleep-bloops? I wish I thought of it first.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is very…loud but that hook is undeniable.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Outsold Selena /s

**shhhneak** (6.5): Feminist.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): wow has this song not aged well, especially knowing the context

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): "you’re acting like a chick, why bother" yawn

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): if you ignore the suggestive lyrics this sounds like a hannah montana song

**UselessTacooo** (6): It’s cute (compliment)

**vayyiqra** (6): Kesha keeps up the trend of "bops with bad lyrics I pretend not to hear".

## manphobes

**AHSWeeknd** (5): oof

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I am giving it a 5 because I just don’t know how to feel about it. Like it’s so catchy and god damn it that chorus is so funny but the raging feminist in me is like ‘girl that internalised misogyny’. But it’s so trashy it’s good.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): writes a 1000-word essay on why calling a man a slut is feminist actually

**hielord** (4.5): the bridge saved this song from a lower score lmao

**BeauMeringue212** (4): Bit of a step down. Doesn't have the charm of her other songs

**fadedblue09** (4): Can't believe I'm saying this....but Selena Gomez & the Scene did it better. Like...no joke

**frogaranaman** (4): this sounds like it's a video game parody song

**endcreditouilles** (3.5): we're in the "if taylor swift had a kesha era" timeline

**nyoom** (3): i don't know if this was an explicit reference to her leaked nudes but i'm uncomfy

**TiltControls** (3): The instrumentation here is a bop, but I actually don't love how Kesha sounds on this for the most part

**ReallyCreative** (5): I'd have an affair with Chris Martin, I'm not above it, this song I'm very much above, which is unfortuanate because on paper this should be a smash collab

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): back when Coldplay’s conceptual albums/songs weren’t panned 🥴

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): oh look, a non-straight person who absolutely loves Coldplay, you're rare as fuck, right?

**astrologicalangel** (10): God I wish I could give this an 11

**duochromepalmtree** (10): I love this song. and I had a total movie moment with this song as the soundtrack the summer after it came out. Think in the rain with your crush at an amusement park.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): as one of 3 coldplay stans here I’m begging can we rate another Coldplay album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Never would I think their voices would go so well together. It sounds so good!!! After all these years, I still don't get the title though

**jman457** (10): I low key loved this then and now

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): Mylo Xyloto kind of gets overlooked as a coldplay album, and this song is one of the highlights

**throwaway7650** (9.5): imagining the reaction my chinese parents would have to the MV... something about the chemistry between chris martin/rihanna is off (and god rihanna really doesn't have a good track record with asians huh)

**jsonphile** (9): Coldplay and Rihanna is an odd pairing, but I think they work nicely together.

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Did China ever have princesses?

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Not gonna lie, forgot this song existed. The only song I listen to off this album is ‘Paradise’. I didn’t really pay much attention to this song when it came out but Rihanna really sounds stunning in this. Her voice goes really well with Chris Martin’s. I really dig the synth thingy that they got going on too. Overall it’s not my cup of tea but I can appreciate it so I’m gonna give it an eight cause it’s a beautifully put together song.

**waluigiest** (8): I was SO INTO this Coldplay album. I never listened to any of their other music, besides the earlier huge music

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): catchy but not my fave

**anothertown** (6): ehhhhhhhhhhhh

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): After reading the Mylo Xyloto synopsis on Wikipedia I just wanted to say I am thoroughly confused and a bit unsettled

## and we'll never be royals (royals)

**apatel27** (5): Typical modern Coldplay song. Nothing interesting of note

**celladonn** (5): What does this have to do with China

**frogaranaman** (5): it's chill

**TragicKingdom1** (5): even ripe age of 11 i was like "wow this song is a mess"

**macnbee** (4): me in 9th grade after hearing the mandarin version of supergirl by super junior

**plastichaxan** (3): will my love for rihanna triumph over my coldplay hatred… seems like not

**wavingwolves** (3): what are they talking about

**TiltControls** (2): maybe I'll be in the minority here but the accoustic version is a solid 10. this just seems so overproduced in comparison (and I say that as someone who likes a lot of the overproducedness era of Coldplay)

## Popheads University PoliSci majors

**vayyiqra** (9): China has not had a monarchy since 1911!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): china doesnt even have a princess

## crying in the club right now

**1998tweety** (10): i really think this shouldve been a single, it would've showed people a side to her that wasn't trashy party bimbo

**akanewasright** (10): “*I have destroyed… our love… it’s gone…*” ran so that “*you come to me… in dreams at night*” could also run

**IIIHenryIII** (10): bangers that make your eyes water are the best

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Hot girls have problems too

**throwaway7650** (10): me when an animal track leaves day 1 (note: does not apply to stephen ~~and I hate to say it but backstabber~~)

**wavingwolves** (10): I'M LOSING IT! LOSING IT! LOSING IT! LOSING IT! WITH EVERY MOVE I DIE!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**xavieryes** (10): invented crying in the club

**jsonphile** (9): damn how’d the best song on the album come right after the worst

**macnbee** (9): I seriously really love this

**nooodisaster** (9): The only ballad that really works for me but there's also only like 2 ballads so this a worthless sentence.

**TheQwertyGuy99** (9): Kesha's version of Dancing On My Own. It's chorus achieves the intent of being sad and a club bop.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I wanna cry and dance to this all at the same time.

**UselessTacooo** (8): I’m a whore for electro-ballads so this is right up my alley

**waluigiest** (8): another classic sad girl at the club song

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): the verses are honestly weak but that chorus is still everything.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7.5): obligatory "this could've been a single"

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.1): I like parts of this song, mainly how minimal and stilted the verses sound. But the chorus is just ok to me.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Not with your hands tied?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): ¹

**apatel27** (7): wub wub ruins it

**BeauMeringue212** (7): Since U Been Gone for girls who wore 30+ rubber bracelets on each arm and went to Warped Tour

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): It’s no Dancing On My Own (Robyn version ONLY) but it gets the job done.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): It once again sounds like Generic Benny Blanco and you know who but with a little bit more. But there are a few songs that these two made together that ended up sounding similar. Like this also as similarity with ‘Part of Me’ to me.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Yola ended

**plastichaxan** (7): been there

**vayyiqra** (7): I'm in the corner watching you kiss her / there's no crying in the club / we don't stop until mascara's on the dancefloor / other songs about being sad while dancing. It's a good trope!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): SINCE U BEEN GOOOOwait what do you mean “wrong song?”

**sage** (6.8): its nice

**CrimsonROSET** (6): when did kelly clarkson get here

**TiltControls** (6): me when Dancing On My Own comes on

## dry eyes

**frogaranaman** (5): someone call Camila Cabello

**nyoom** (5): robyn's dancing on my own actually dropped this same year and i was hoping to find someone double dipping in the songwriting credits but no dice sadly

**Stryxen** (4): me listening to the high concept pop playlist

**fadedblue09** (2.5): Me listening to this god-awful album

**seanderlust** (10): not gonna lie - this one hurts because it is a BANGER!! it is to date my favorite kesha deep cut, and was actually very close to being my 11! PaaRDH is the most punk rock take on a (cough Paris Hilton owned cough) mansion party that you can have in a pop song, and it earned kesha a shitload of respect in my book. the grungy, garagy, unpolished production works so well for a song about showing up at a mansion and peeing in the champagne and throwing up in the walk-in closet. however, this song quickly fell all the way to being a day one cut before clawing its way back up to a mid-twenties placement. this earned comparisons from you all to artists ranging from Beastie Boys to Kelly Clarkson to……sigh the Tramp Stamps. oh well. anyways, tax the rich.

---

## party Animals (hehe)

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I don't like alcohol or parties, but this song makes me want to become a drunker and party real hard

**nootnoot781** (11): “where’s my coat?” “WHERE?” i fucking love this song oh my god. the lyrics that would be in brackets (idk the proper name, nor do i care) just makes this song perfect

**akanewasright** (10): GOD I love it when Kesha kinda gets a bit unhinged and this song is just gleefully off the wall. This honestly indicates more about Kesha’s actual artistic leanings than anything else on the album. Plus the song is allegedly about a party at Paris Hilton’s house, so I honestly have to stan her for throwing up in one of her closets

**anothertown** (10): the way she squishes "perignon" into 2 syllables is amazing

**apatel27** (10): that vocalisation of the beat just makes the song

**Awkward\_King** (10): COMEONLETSDOIT

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the one time i partied at a ‘rich dude’s house the police got called so i think i can relate

**hikkaru** (10): i'm waiting for her whole pop rock album like this, dirty love, let em talk etc it fits her SO well

**plastichaxan** (10): no cause i want to go to one and rob the rich dude in question

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Azaelia waiting for Grimes in Elon's house

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if theres one weakness i have in music its that any song that has a catchy guitar riff will automatically get a 10 from me even if every other aspect of it isnt that particularly good. this is an example of one of those songs

**throwaway7650** (10): we love a punk pop moment. dr. luke #OUT

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): While listening to this the most disturbing thought popped into my head… An MCR cover of this song would S L A P

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.7): Geez this album is so FUN! Another relentless banger.

**wavingwolves** (9.2): kesha had the BEST delivery, she nailed it to perfection every single time

**outsideeyess** (9.1): love that Paris Hilton is the titular "rich dude"

**daythreeinmiami** (9): I wanna go party at a rich dude’s house so bad thanks to this song but alas I am honestly too tired to party these days.

**Stryxen** (9): sounds fun kesha hope you have a good night kesha

**1998tweety** (8): Azealia Banks to Elon Musk

**BeauMeringue212** (8): honestly this is just silly, fun and dare I say c*mp?

**celladonn** (8): Comrade Kesha trashing the houses of the wealthy

**macnbee** (8): ACTUALLY SUCH A BANGER

**Uberpigeon** (8): the bimbofied last friday night

**vayyiqra** (8): I first heard of Kesha in a review of Animal that brought up the "pissing in the Dom Perignon" line. My memory is hazy because "Tik Tok" was surely out then, but it's the first time I paid attention to her. I thought "this looks ridiculous; now I have to hear it". In hindsight, it was camp.

**waluigiest** (8): verses really outsell the chorus. And the bridge is good too!

**sage** (7.8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): popheads, party at u/ImADudeDuh‘s house!!

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Vomit in the closets of all bourgeoisie!!

**hielord** (7): coming-of-age movie vibes

**jsonphile** (7): that’s a pretty nice guitar riff

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): This could be a beastie boys song if the synths were lower quality

**nooodisaster** (6): queen of redistributing wealth by committing property damage

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6): Honestly I would go to that party...

## next door, calling the police

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The chorus of this song was reminding me of some 2000s pop hit and I went insane for a while trying to figure it out. It was Behind These Hazel Eyes by Kelly Clarkson. I’m grateful to this song for getting me to revisit that stone cold 11.

**frogaranaman** (4): the rich dudes always have the worst parties I swear

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i wish it was catchier

**nyoom** (3): but i don't WANT to piss in the champagne :(

**UselessTacooo** (3): who listened to this song and thought “wooo! This is great and should be released!!”. It needs to go

**AHSWeeknd** (1): which rich dude?

**duochromepalmtree** (1): god awful

**fadedblue09** (1): Sounds like something Tramp Stamps would sing

**seanderlust** (10): sincerely such a steamy song. put this on after moisturizing and feel your oats a bit.

---

## moisturizes

**1998tweety** (10): im getting horny

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That guitar needs to make a comeback for R9. Well, if Rihanna makes a comeback for R9.

**apatel27** (10): Sexy Rihanna always works.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): this song is so sleek and she sounds so sexy. Was tempted to give it my 11

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is soooo underrated, and it's kind of the perfect compromise if you need a sex bop that isn't as explicit as s&m or as demure as whats my name

**jackisboredtoday** (10): i just thought it was the sexiest song ever made

**nooodisaster** (10): This will be paid dust and that's bc y'all are virgins who can't drive. But rly, I've fucked with this song and I've FUCKED with this song.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): queen of sex!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): rihanna's best non single song

**waluigiest** (10): this song is SO GOOD I love the long, sensual buildup to that explosive first chorus. It has no business being one of the best songs on the album.

**xavieryes** (10): one of Rihanna's best deep cuts

**akanewasright** (9): This is EASILY one of the best album tracks and it could never be a single because they can’t play a song this hot and heavy on the radio

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): IM A SLUT FOR BITCHING GUITAR SOLOS!!

**throwaway7650** (9): not sure what to comment for the song (edit: I now think this lowkey could be the blueprint for some tinashe songs? *looks at guitar solo*) so I'll just say sabrina sweetie I'm so sorry that skin flopped. stream looking at me

**teenwitches** (8.5): horny chill bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): , fine

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh this is about SEX sex

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I usually find “songs for lovemaking” to be cheesy but this one is legit hot.

**fadedblue09** (8): A very sultry number, and the electric guitar in the end is a highlight. Shouldve been the template for Talk That Talk

**sage** (8): smash

**Uberpigeon** (8): what the hell the guitar solo...i am listening

**vayyiqra** (8): :flushed:

**jman457** (7.6): A little long but hot as hell

**wavingwolves** (7.1): that guitar slayed!!!!!!!

**awhile2** (7): i love the hook on this song so much - just think it could do with a more upbeat remix or something

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Oh this is a real sexy time song. She's slow paced, she's smooth. The bridge could have given me a little bit more along with the chorus.

**TiltControls** (7): it's nice

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): This makes me feel so single.

**UselessTacooo** (7): I like it, but it objectively drags on too long. It could have cut 2 minutes, and been the perfect length, but it kept it super long and it eventually stopped being compelling. However, bonus points for the guitar solo Because I have an electric-guitar-in-pop-music obsession

**outsideeyess** (6.6): this doesn't fit the album lol

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): this just drags and isn’t as interesting as other tracks on here

**nyoom** (6.5): it puts the lotion on its SKINNN

**hielord** (6): sexy but kinda boring at the same time

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is just awkward to listen to. Like audio voyeurism

## ...or else it gets the hose again

**frogaranaman** (4): is this supposed to be sexy

**macnbee** (3): https://youtu.be/GA64j7nfRQk

**Awkward\_King** (2): this is horny but it kinda does nothing else for me ??? like go girl give us horny but it takes a lot of buildup just for a kinda subpar release, thats what ur horny over girl ?????

**IIIHenryIII** (2): it's just plain boring

**metanoira** (1.5): literally only for the outro did this not get a 0

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): This was the most boring song in the rate and, barring something especially obnoxious or offensive, that will usually warrant my 0.

**bigbigbee** (8.5): 3OH!3's gorilla grip on this rate

**seanderlust** (5): kesha can have a little objectification of men, as a treat. i remember liking this in 2010 when it came out but i fear it did not age very well and parts of it are straight up unpleasant. also what in the world is 3OH!3 talking about

**ReallyCreative** (0): one of the worst songs ever conceived

---

## cares what my middle name is

**endcreditouilles** (11): i made this song my whole personality in high school and honestly i don't know why i ever stopped

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Making a bop out of unintelligible terms is something only Kesha can do

**akanewasright** (10): This is probably the best version of Kesha’s early shtick. Like… her intent with her persona was to flip the script on the normalized sexism in music (and especially hip hop), and this song does that really well, really clearly, ~~without Dr. Luke~~, and it’s just a lot of fun

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This song slaps and if you disagree you have no taste I’m sorry and I will be checking the comments thank yew.

**frogaranaman** (10): this chorus used to be THE middle school breakup Instagram captions omfg, Drake who

**hikkaru** (10): one of the most iconic intros ever noitstrue

**moooo566** (10): 3Oh!3 kind of own, please dont crucify me, and kesha kills it too

**nootnoot781** (10): okay now this is camp

**outsideeyess** (10): romance-shaming men, we love to see it (except Kesha was just met with more slut-shaming)

**plastichaxan** (10): the way i still remember every single lyric to this… this album and kesha hold too much power over me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's camp, but the good kind

**throwaway7650** (10): 3OH!3 are fine but kesha is THEE main event

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): they don’t make hook up anthems like this anymore

**Iris3271** (9.5): 3OH!3 were iconic

**teenwitches** (9.5): 3oh!3 nearly ruins this one tbh

**cremeebrulee** (9): she’s so right i have no interest in what a man has to say ever

**emayzee** (8.5): i vividly remember sitting on a train listening to this on my ipod nano while admiring the silly bandz and outfit of the girl sitting across the aisle from me. the epitome of spring 2010 culture

**nyoom** (8.5): i haven't read any of her interviews or anything but nothing will shake my faith that ke$ha knew with absolute certainty that she would become the face of every THIS IS WHAT'S WRONG WITH THE WORLD THESE DAYS post and never once gave a single fuck

**sage** (8.5): smash

**wavingwolves** (8.2): when greta thunberg quoted this song in her speech (fuck you u/hikkaru)

**anothertown** (8): a perfect meeting of the minds

**apatel27** (8): When 3OH!3 pop off, they really pop off

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is one of her weakest songs but is still a banger? Just like Taylor, she has no bad songs.

**metanoira** (8): this is hyperpop

**nooodisaster** (8): The featured artist (who Im not gonna try and spell) sucked hard but I fuck with them for trying.

**slimboyfriend** (8): Have truer words ever been spoken

**Stryxen** (8): Slay Slay Slay

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I feel like this will be an unpopular opinion, but I actually really like this song.

**waluigiest** (8): wanna dance with no pants on? (holla!)

**hielord** (7.5): FUCK MIDDLE NAMES

**TiltControls** (7.5): I found this for vgv and now it's all I associate with the song: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0kz7-loRzUA

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i guess she also wants to see your peacock

**1998tweety** (6): this has def grown on me but I HATED it when it came out.

**BeauMeringue212** (6): instrumental is catchy but 30h3 add nothing to it and it's too repetitive imo

**Uberpigeon** (6): they thought of the first 3 words they could that rhymed with blah and went with it. One of the words was "blah" again

## calls me "buddy" because they can't remember my name

**jsonphile** (5): this is so horrendously annoying and obnoxious but it’s clearly intentional and it pulls it off so flawlessly I can’t even be that mad at it

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): https://twitter.com/murraywow/status/1442936692495712259?s=20

**duochromepalmtree** (4): okay this song aged so badly lol. Probably the weakest on the album tbh

**UselessTacooo** (4): sure is a fast electro song, but it’s just so dull to the point im writing this half asleep.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This is so ugly

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): the bar to outperform 3oh3 on any given song is such a low bar to clear and kesha still couldnt pass it

**xavieryes** (3): I'm not in love with this song

**fadedblue09** (2.5): I wanna zip her lips like a padlock after listening to this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): Somehow 3OH!3 has not benefited at all from 10 years of nostalgia. We don’t need and never needed an unironic version of Lonely Island.

## trash (complimentary)

**astrologicalangel** (11): listen, this is trash. Garbage. But it is my trash

**Awkward\_King** (11): trash

**vayyiqra** (9): This is trash. I love it!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): will this kinda of trash pop make a comeback in a post-pandemic world?? disucss.

**thePotatofairyy** (7): Trashy and fun but notably less fun that the other singles. Sounds like a song by the Millionaires. "Only matters who I is" is an S tier lyric though

**1998tweety** (10): that bridge whew

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): a perfect ending song for the album and the gigantic era it came from, and it should've been a number one!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this has always been one of my faves

**jman457** (10): made the re-release worth it

**nootnoot781** (10): her best song i think

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what can i say, it's pretty

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of katy's best ngl

**TiltControls** (10): Very close to getting my 11. I remember playing this over and over when it came out and I still associate it with that time. Some may think it falls in the 'boring' Katy song area, but I absolutely think she sells the song fully here

**outsideeyess** (9.7): a perfect era-ender

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): kind of a genius move for her to end this album with this reality check of a song. i wish the chorus was a bit more memorable, but it’s always been my favorite from the album.

**shhhneak** (9.4): Such a cathartic final minute. Her last good album closer.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): that's what witness would sound like had Max Martin been involved in it

**endcreditouilles** (8.7): wait i thought this was a teenage dream what happened

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): It kind of feels like diet The One That Got Away, but that still makes it a pretty great pop song.

**jsonphile** (8.5): I feel like this is sort of the forgotten single of this era, I don’t see much talking about this one compared to the other singles. But I actually really like this one. Excellent production

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.3): Dang i really like this song. I think here's a great crystallation of Katy's music being anthemic, poppy yet melancholy but it still works for me. I think the guitar strumming and steady beat mesh sooo well with the lyrics and singing.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I'm wide awake, but I wish I wasn't.

**xavieryes** (8): used to like it more, but still good

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): cute to realize this was about waking up from the teenage dream

**ImADudeDuh** (7.6): this grew off me

**AHSWeeknd** (7): the video really saved this song

**waluigiest** (7): it has a lot of the same unoriginality issues as Part of Me, but the more subtle beat and her mature vocal performance make it a lot better

**nyoom** (6.5): "Yeah, I am born again/Out of the lion's den" | daniel, respawning: ok wow i am usually WAY better at praying than that

**akanewasright** (6): I can literally never decide if I like this or not. I hated this on the radio and then bought it on iTunes and racked up plays of it. I thought i hated it again, but every other listen I get into it a little… eh, I’ll probably hate it again when the results get revealed

**frogaranaman** (6): how many "I was asleep during this song" comments are there going to be

**nooodisaster** (6): this was her witness era

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I feel like this song was trying to go for a really deep, emotional feel, but it’s unfortunately so hampered by the… lackluster songwriting that it just sounds like the most basic “I was hurt :( but now I’m ok :)” song

## nyquil

**BeauMeringue212** (5.5): the lyrics were just always too weak and cliche imo

**UselessTacooo** (5): I remembered this song way differently than it sounds. It’s so.. flat. It doesn’t progress, and the chorus is just blah. The outro is kinda nice but outside of it the song isn’t that great.

**macnbee** (4): unlike me when I'm listening to this, hehe

**sage** (4): snooze

**Uberpigeon** (4): evil katy perry be like fast asleep

**plastichaxan** (3.8): i’ve never been too big on this song

**Awkward\_King** (3): cursed to only ever think of the pentatonix/todrick hall wizard of oz pop music melody when i hear this./... braver than the us army

**CrimsonROSET** (3): there is a direct line from firework to this to roar and it only goes down

**daythreeinmiami** (3): Why does she have so many songs that sound like this? I swear.

**duochromepalmtree** (2): my friends used to joke they had never heard this song because the second I heard that “wide awake!” I would immediately change the song. I really hate it

**throwaway7650** (2): maybe this song isn't as bad as my score indicates but it's always annoyed me idk. especially the chorus... and I'd hear this all the damn time with katy still being in her imperial phase during TD... and speaking of the chorus, for some reason when I heard this song in my head (which was often again due to how omnipresent katy's songs were back then) the "falling from cloud 9" would transition into bronzong's cry and it's ingrained into my mind at this point and I can't unhear it (hm maybe I should create that edit)

**Stryxen** (1): this “song” makes me nauseous

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i sleep

**wavingwolves** (1): the music video for this is just a worse version of brick by boring brick by paramore (which is a good song and a rate winner, two things this will never accomplish)

**seanderlust** (10): i'm a little surprised this didn't actually make it to radio (other than in australia, apparently). this is fun and optimistic, it feels like a movie credits song that you would Shazam to try and see what it is and if you can buy it for 99 cents off iTunes

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I love pop rock Katy Perry! This wouldn't be out of place on One of the Boys. And I liked that record, so I like this!

---

## hummingbird feeders

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): This song deserves the popularity and acclaim that Teenage Dream gets!! The instrumentation is just an amazing arrangement of pop with a rock edge, and Katy’s truly giving it her all on the vocals! And I don’t give a fuck how unhingedly horny the lyrics are, it adds to the charm!!

**Awkward\_King** (10): ugh i need to hoover my floor

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Be me. Be 15. You are in car with family on a holiday. You are oldest. Declare yourself in charge of music. You put in CD you just recently burnt. It’s your October 2010 playlist. You forgot you put ‘Hummingbird Heartbeat’ on CD. You are deep in conversation with step-dad before you hear ‘YOU MAKE ME FEEL LIKE I’M LOOSING MY VIRGINITY’. There are young children in the car. Awkwardness ensues. But you then say ‘yeah nah but it’s a good song though’. 8 year old step brother agrees and begins singing the song by second chorus.

**hikkaru** (10): the best bside, absolute smash

**metanoira** (10): the opening line is jarring but i love it

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): The hit that got away

**TragicKingdom1** (10): some of my favorite cum metaphors

**waluigiest** (10): this is aspirational horniness

**wavingwolves** (10): "you make me feel like i'm losing my virginity" is an awful and unsexy line because there's absolutely nothing good about having sex for the first time. anyways this is a big yass and slay anyway

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.3): whoever this is about must have dicked her the fuck down

**1998tweety** (9): can't relate, but whew this totally should've been a single.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is a single, but the ones from the upside down are gifted of such wonder.

**fadedblue09** (9): This sounds more pop-rock than I remembered? Probably her best deep cut here tbh

**macnbee** (9): why was this not a major hit??

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): in between this and Peacock, DAE Katy has an avian fetish? anyways I really like the pop-rock guitars and 80s synth, and that’s enough for me to give a high score

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): a banger

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): It’s not just the singles - there are deep cut bops here too!

**celladonn** (8.5): The overlooked bop of the album

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): I totally why this one is so hyped up! It's sooo good!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): !r1 honey by mariah carey

**grey/0x976** (8): slaybak

**throwaway7650** (8): the lyrics are camp, this and peacock overhated

**TiltControls** (8): Honestly feels a lot closer to OotB than the rest of TD, but good thing I really enjoyed OotB (mostly anyways).

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is one of the most sexual songs I’ve heard that’s just a big metaphor fhdjfjjr

**jman457** (7.7): fun deep cut

**akanewasright** (7.5): This is camp but also… Katy you can write better melodies than this

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): This is cute! A nice little pop rock number. Kinda sounds like a DCOM song, but it's sweet and an earworm.

**jsonphile** (7.5): okay this kinda slaps

**cherryices** (7.1): somehow the album with S&M is NOT the horniest one in this rate

**duochromepalmtree** (7): the lyrics are dumb and the sound has aged like milk but i absolutely still bopped

**Iris3271** (7): Cute but cringy

**nooodisaster** (7): "i want teenage dream." "we have teenage dream at home." teenage dream at home:

**nyoom** (7): i was going to make fun of "Let's pollinate to create a family tree/This evolution with you comes naturally/Some call it science (science), we call it chemistry" but "I see the sunrise in your eyes, your eyes/We've got a future full of blue skies, blue skies" is genuinely very sweet and heartfelt and makes me smile

**RandomHypnotica** (7): that's one hell of an opening line

**teenwitches** (7): it's like a bad bon jovi song with way too many innuendos

**thePotatofairyy** (7): Cute, subtly flirtatious opening line. Fun safe pop song

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): ok i genuinely don’t know if she’s talking about her actual heart or like . her clit

**hielord** (6.9): This sounds exactly like 2011

**BeauMeringue212** (6.7): she sounds good on this more pop rock sounding backing track

**IIIHenryIII** (6): she's getting extra points because I like the word "hummingbird"

**ImADudeDuh** (6): this was a nice OOTB era song but then she had to go for the obvious cum metaphor

**shhhneak** (6): Some people don’t know why this wasn’t a single and to them I ask, have you heard these lyrics?

**xavieryes** (6): the other bird song is better

## my cat, sitting beneath the hummingbird feeder, waiting

**UselessTacooo** (5.5): I really love what it’s trying to do, but it keeps falling on its fucking face

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Normal people at a gas station: “filler ‘er up!” Katy Perry after writing the singles for her albums: “filler ‘er up!”

**anothertown** (5): this was almost something.. not enough energy to it

**frogaranaman** (5): oh the song is about sex

**Stryxen** (5): the first line i so nearly gave up on this rate but then this kinda got good lol

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): ok girl we get it you’re horny

**Uberpigeon** (5): Madonna ended!

**endcreditouilles** (4): "constantly craving for a taste of your sticky-sweet" i'm going to send someone a strongly worded letter

**vayyiqra** (4): All of you who want Disney pop-rock to come back need to stop texting and go find God. This is awful.

**awhile2** (3): stupide metaphor

**plastichaxan** (3): zzzz

**sage** (2): this sucks why are people yassing over it

## Got every reason to feel like they're that bitch

**AHSWeeknd** (10): More of David Guetta should’ve been featured in the Bonus Rate. Specifically that “Turn Me On” song, I would’ve given it a two but still.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): 2010's edm is very hit or miss, but this went hard and still sounds good

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This really is my cup of tea. This is my shit. This is my jam. I have had so many people laugh at me when I’m in my car and this song comes on and I just turn up the volume and really let myself go. Basically they really do be saying ‘who that chick’?

**hielord** (10): my runway song since I was 13

**ignitethephoenix** (10): who cares if it is dated, it’s a bop

**skargardin** (10): megabop

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Sexy chick minus misogyny

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): so underrated in rihanna's discography

**wavingwolves** (9): heavy autotuned rihanna is a YES!

**outsideeyess** (8.5): this bridge is heavenly

**throwaway7650** (8.5): the jolinprint jumped out re: the MV

**duochromepalmtree** (8): this song is so dated but it was so much fun when it came out!

**ReallyCreative** (10): We love a sample that creates a joint slay moment. Unfortunately, this song was pretty throughly robbed, and there was never much doubt that it wasn't the championship contender this cohost thought it would be.

---

## Shots! Shots! Shot shot shot shots!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Such an easy song but Rihanna single-handedly made it a bop

**anothertown** (10): got my raybans on and im feelin hella cool tonite yeaaaaaaaaa

**cremeebrulee** (10): absolutely iconic avril sample, so this is such an easy 10

**ReallyCreative** (10): We love a sample that creates a joint slay moment. Unfortunately, this song was pretty throughly robbed, and there was never much doubt that it wasn't the championship contender this cohost thought it would be.

**jsonphile** (10): underrated bop. Just a fun laid back song about letting loose on the weekend

**skargardin** (10): Oh for it to be 2010 and the Avril sample

**xavieryes** (10): she sure got her mind on her money alright

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): heard this on the radio once and the host started talking over the end of the song. Fuck you whatever radio station that was, you have no idea what you did

**akanewasright** (9.5): I don’t know who had the idea to use that Avril Lavigne sample, but they’re a genius and they deserve only nice things

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): Now this is making me nostalgic to copious drinking college and pre-pandemic happy hours. And the Avril sample is brilliant.

**shhhneak** (9.3): Instantly recognizable Avril sample. When you, a queen, come across another queen and discuss how to best maximize your joint slay.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): a great song to listen while I replace alcohol with apple cider vinegar instead.

**awhile2** (9): the avril sampe should not work nearly as well as it does

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Maybe it’s because I’m listening to Animal alongside this but the “yeah-e-yeahs” in the background really sound like Kesha to me. Anyway I really like this and I’m glad this rate got me to revisit it.

**TiltControls** (9): 'Cheers to the freakin' weekend' would've made a great alt title for day 3 of 2020 Ult Ult

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): COYOTE UGLY UP IN HERE NO TYRA!!!

**outsideeyess** (8.6): this Avril sample is so perfect omg, I just never realized how goddamn long it is.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): a Rihanna island-pop song sampling Avril Lavigne sounds like the worst thing ever, but this is a vibe

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The first of many Rihanna songs that make me want to smoke a blunt with her

**wavingwolves** (8.5): i love the sample here i'm sorry! i know it doesn't work but i like it! i think rihanna can do anything!

**endcreditouilles** (8.1): this song is a perfect snapshot of 2010, i feel transported

**jman457** (8.1): Ultimate drinking song

**apatel27** (8): Didn’t realise it was an Avril sample until recently

**CrimsonROSET** (8): let rihanna say fuck

**frogaranaman** (8): doing shots while this song is playing in the background >>>

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i like this better now than i did in 2011 lol

**teenwitches** (8): the avril sample was a stroke of genius

**waluigiest** (8): if good vibes only was a song

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): im mixed on this but i think its more positive than negative

**hikkaru** (7.5): i like it but the avril sample has always been a bit out of place for me... i'm with you one of her best songs btw

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the sample is iconic but this song never did it for me

**nooodisaster** (7.5): wow it took me 11 years to realize she was saying "BASTARDS get you down" not "bar-studs"... my hearing aid era

**throwaway7650** (7.5): bonus half a point for the tyra banks line... CTFU

**duochromepalmtree** (7): nostalgia is absolutely bumping this song up for me. The first time I heard the Avril sample I lost my mind. Is it a good song? No probably not. But it sure is a lot of fun.

**Uberpigeon** (7): i WILL drink to this

**metanoira** (6.5): why is she yodeling like ok caroline polachek

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (6.5): I'm giving this a low score because I can't drink.

**macnbee** (6): points for the avril sample

## IPA bros

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I WANT TO KNOW who came up with the idea to use Avril Lavigne’s vocals in the background.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i never really liked this, but the avril sample still sends me

**vayyiqra** (5): Look, I'm Canadian and a millennial and this Avril sample (from a ballad even) is so bizarre it takes me right out. I can't get past it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Sounds awfully slow and boring for being a party song

**fadedblue09** (4.5): IMO the weakest Loud single. Also I love Avril but who tf thinks her wailing is worthy of a sample

**1998tweety** (4): this sample is horrendous

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): id rather be listening to the avril lavigne song this is sampling

**celladonn** (3): A song about celebrating should not be this droning and monotonous

**Stryxen** (3): oh this just does not end

**UselessTacooo** (2.5): This song is so messy. The “yeeehyeeh” sample(?) does not fit, and her vocal tone in it makes its lowkey unlistenable in parts.

**sage** (0): this is literally one of the most go girl give us nothing songs ive ever heard like theres nothing going for this omg... its like they were actively trying to make it suck

**ReallyCreative** (9): stream Fly by The Chicks

**seanderlust** (8.5): is this cheesy? yes. but it also works well. rihanna's serve on the hook bumps this up a couple points for me

**bigbigbee** (5): The lesser of the two Nicki / Rihanna collaborations in this rate, in this host’s humble opinion. I just am not terribly excited by Rihanna's chorus in this.

---

## has their seat tables in the upright and locked position

**1998tweety** (10): they ate this up

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It’s a little annoying but I don’t want it to seem like I’m sabotaging the album so I’m giving this a ten

**duochromepalmtree** (10): by far the best song on this album. The harmonies in the chorus are so beautiful and a great contrast to Nikki absolutely crushing the verses. Great song.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this is the superior version of Firework

**fadedblue09** (10): Rihanna doing charity, we love to see it! But honestly Nicki sounds enjoyable here too

**grey/0x976** (10): another anthem

**joeeswift** (10): this is MY fight song

**TiltControls** (9.5): great output from both here

**apatel27** (9): Probably their best collab

**frogaranaman** (9): this is so me when I come to win

**ignitethephoenix** (9): underrated bop here, I’m surprised it never was as successful as other tracks here

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I can't not associate this song with Rapist Kelly thanks to Ryan Murphy

**ImADudeDuh** (9): thinking of when i called this her best song in like 2016, my delusions

**nyoom** (9): the melody line and beat kind of sound like it could be a b-side from stars' in our bedroom after the war album. the ending part with the repeated "get ready for it" specifically feels very indie pop to me

**TheQueenOfVultures** (9): Rihanna makes the most out of that boring chorus but its easily the best of the inspirational tracks on the album

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): This actually is really sad, wow! And Rihanna sounds so good here!

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): GIRLBOSS GASLIGHT GATEKEEP

**hielord** (8.5): Powerful.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Rihanna sings 12 synonyms for "win" and we cry.

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): its corny but . 14 year old me ate it up so

**BeauMeringue212** (8): this kinda came and went considering how big a collab it was, but I think it's cute

**sage** (8): the weakest of the singles here but still SLAY!

**skargardin** (8): I don't know what it is about early 2010s Rihanna hooks but they do give me that buzz

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): remember when rap songs had to have a pop hook to chart

**throwaway7650** (8): the far superior rih/nicki collab in the rate :noitstrue:

**UselessTacooo** (8): if y’all rob this song I will cry. Nicki and Rihanna are a perfect combo.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): ok maybe this one can stay a lil

**celladonn** (7.5): Rihanna's hook really elevates this

**shhhneak** (7.5): New Directions should’ve lost the Regionals the moment they let Blaine rap this.

**anothertown** (7): an underrated insane glee moment when they mashed this up with r. kelly

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh this song

**vayyiqra** (7): Rihanna is trying to save this album though it's futile

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Definitely one of the better sounding rap ballads on the album but I’m still pretty booooooooored.

**slimboyfriend** (6): Well Rihanna is here

**waluigiest** (6): “I am not fly / I am levitation” is so unintentionally funny

## overslept and missed the flight

**akanewasright** (5): I love Rihanna but this chorus is melodically *nothing*, and Nicki isn’t really great here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): oh so THIS is the song that comic of the girl flying came from

**Uberpigeon** (5): dont bring in rihanna and get her to sing that uninspired chorus

**cherryices** (4): i came to win 🙋🏾♀️ to fight 🤜🏾 to conquer 🧍🏾♀️ to fly :) 🧚🏾♀️

**daythreeinmiami** (4): Like I love that they have a song together I just think it’s really boring and lacklustre. Like they could have given me everything and this is what we got. I wanted more.

**thePotatofairyy** (4): These two together have no right making a song this boring

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This is so boring lmao sorry… that chorus really grinds everything to a halt huh?

**bigbigbee** (8.5): I’ve thrown my body around to this song like I was in goddamn Hollywood week on So You Think You Can Dance too many times to count

**seanderlust** (7.4): this feels...odd in katy's discog. it feels like an attempt to branch out of the sound she was previously known for which, while getting props for being inventive, feels like it's going for banger peaks that it never quite achieves.

---

## comes in peace

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (11): You know songs like that, they are stories that people can identify with. You know what I mean, anybody. Children were singing the song at graduations. At weddings. At funerals

**1998tweety** (10): the video version which stitches both Katy's bridge and Ye's 2nd verse together is supreme

**2dina3dworld** (10): Rose Tyler vibes

**anothertown** (10): 🛸 bogos binted

**celladonn** (10): Would I fuck an alien? Well, I have played every Mass Effect game

**endcreditouilles** (10): love katy for putting a pussy worshipping song on her album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I've lost count of how many times I got probed after being abducted ascending to heaven to this banger

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the exclusion of the Kanye remix here is Shrekphobic

**shhhneak** (10): Stands for Eleven-worThy

**SideBTrack8** (10): the kanye remix outsold tho

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): literally wtf is this song even about

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): THIS WAS THE BEST SINGLE! FIGHT ME!!! But the solo version is better.

**xavieryes** (10): cancelled for using the A-word (even if it's not in the title), fetishizing ETs and doing every possible form of ETfishing in the video, someone call Demi

**akanewasright** (9.9): I remember being actively upset that radio stations started playing this instead of firework……… I was wrong. The Kanye version is better I think

**hielord** (9.8): this is pure camp you twinks. Kanye's version would've gotten my 11 tho

**UselessTacooo** (9.4): this is my favourite single. I know people say it aged terribly but it just don’t see it. It’s really bombastic and the chorus is so much fun

**macnbee** (9): I feel like people don't give this enough credit for committing so fully to the dubstep/techno sound

**nyoom** (9): someday this song will be a mildly offensive artifact in like, the history of nonterran xenophobia museum archives

**skargardin** (9): it's still the smasha

**throwaway7650** (9): the worst #1 hit without kanye I fear (thus not a 10), still good though

**waluigiest** (9): her voice here is so pretty :) and the chorus is honestly cool

**outsideeyess** (8.8): when this song went #1, we used positive reinforcement to make Katy think it was ok to pronounce words like "extraterrestrial" or "unconditionally"

**sage** (8.5): smasha but the kanye version is better

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This version not having the Kanye verse simultaneously makes it better and worse. Regardless, it’s a weird ass bop.

**daythreeinmiami** (8): 2010 was a simpler time so we can’t be too mad that she used the world ‘alien’ in the chorus Demi please forgive her. That chorus really slaps though doesn’t it.

**moooo566** (8): hot take: this song is weird

**nooodisaster** (8): Not me still remembering the parody song of this I made in high school about dating a guy who uses too many big words.

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): it bops but when i hear “wanna be a victim” i can’t help but flinch a bit

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): ...what a concept

**TiltControls** (7.5): The Kanye feature version would be a 10

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I never got the hype for this.

**babadork** (7): If this had been the Kanye version, I'd have rated it much lower.

**cherryices** (7): my sims at 3am: WANNA BE A VICTIM READY FOR ABDUCTION

**fadedblue09** (7): Katy conflating extraterrestrial with supernatural makes some.....very interesting metaphors in this song. Probably the most dated single but the prechorus is chilling, I'll give her that

**TheQueenOfVultures** (7): Why aren't we rating the Kanye version?! He rhymes "Astronaut" with "Yeezy get ass a lot", there's a lot to discuss.

**Iris3271** (6.5): Demi could never

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Kesha may have had sex with a ghost in 2012, but Katy Perry was fantasizing about being abducted and infected by a sexy alien in 2010

**BeauMeringue212** (6.2): ngl it kinda misses something without Kanye

**frogaranaman** (6): can't be the only one that thinks the Kanye West remix is the better version of this song

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): The fact that this song can only be about either someone who can’t speak English or literally fucking an alien… why do you do these things Katy

## comes in uh....war? I guess?

**jman457** (5.5): Its not the Kanye version so….

**apatel27** (5): It’s a song

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.1): The vocal processing in the chorus bit is really unpleasant. It's just a pretty clunky song now.

**jsonphile** (3): I genuinely don’t understand how anyone can like this song. It’s so grating and annoying and I’m totally fine if people want to have sex with aliens I get it there are sexy aliens but this ain’t sexy

**grey/0x976** (2): isnt the same without kanyes verse

**wavingwolves** (2): can't explain how much i always hated this song

**duochromepalmtree** (1): i hate this song I’m sorry it sounds bad to me

**CrimsonROSET** (0): does anything about this seem like a good idea to anyone?

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this is gonna go farther than it should. The only positives I can say is thank god this isnt the kanye remix.

##pockets on Shrek, rockets on deck

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): alien sex by probing my ass wide open? cool!

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a masterpiece, but what about the remix? Insert "camp" comment. Alien sex.:praiseye: (Unironically though.)

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): yes I prefer the version with Kanye talking about alien sex, and what about it?

**Uberpigeon** (9): alien sex

**hikkaru** (8): missing pockets on shrek what's next alien sex

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): im assuming that bc theres no ft kanye west in the title on the rate form we’re not rating the version with him on it but let it be known that if we were i would be giving this song a 1 because good god does that verse absolutely destroy the flow of this song at the end. not even alien sex can save that

**thePotatofairyy** (6): Doesn't do much for me anymore but I have fond memories of being on the bus exclusively singingb"alien SEX"

**Awkward\_King** (0): her vocals on this never matched the production for me, her airy voice sounds like the song is just draining her out and it throws it off for me, also similarly to firework i find the chorus quite grating. at least the kanye version has alien sex
