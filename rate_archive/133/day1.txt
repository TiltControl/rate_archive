**seanderlust** (7): i love the subject matter of this one, but i'm not crazy about the production. i think a little more finessing and a sharper direction for this song could have made one of the best songs in the CD, if not in katy's entire discography, but unfortunately it just never gets there

**bigbigbee** (3): I just think, how did this song get put on such a fun album? It just feels like a juvenile understanding of angst. This song was always low, but not last place until about the final third of ballots.

---

##Ready for the road less travelled

**UselessTacooo** (10): I feel like this is objectively bad, but I somehow got emotionally attached to it and now it’s probably my favourite song on Teenage Dream. Sorr not sorry I guess.

**outsideeyess** (8): another likely OOTB holdover, and that's what I'm living for

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): it’s weird she has a Christian-esque song on an album with a song like Peacock but okay you do you

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Katy really writes singles and then filler tracks, there’s no in between 😭

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): this is fine but it's definitely a filler

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this is one of the only songs on the album I didn’t like originally that I think sounds better now!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): Rihanna's Question Existing but not as good

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): This sounds like it could be in a movie soundtrack.

**waluigiest** (7): she’s singing like this!?? for maybe the most forgettable cut??

**xxipil0ts** (7): The Production felt very 2020. The lyrics, however, kind of draws it back.

**hielord** (6.4): I kinda see what she was trying to do here but like, hmmm, it didn't work?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): interesting production that takes a more subdued approach to the incoming dubstep trend but the song its in service of feels half baked

**1998tweety** (6): the definition of filler

**IIIHenryIII** (6): It sounds like a witness reject. She really was ahead of her time.

**nooodisaster** (6): It's filler.

**vayyiqra** (6): This song feels "fake deep" like an algorithm pieced together Biblical references to make a "meaningful" song.

##...idk, can you just pull up directions on Google Maps?

**emayzee** (5.7): this sounds like it stole the instrumental from my love by justin timberlake except this one isn't good

**CrimsonROSET** (5): idk girl figure it out

**sage** (5): its not bad its giving my love by jt but not slay

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): idk what it is about this song but the chorus just doesn't work for me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): hyperpop? more like hyperpoop

**throwaway7650** (4.5): sounds like a demo... should've kept it that way tbh

**jman457** (4.3): pretty forgettable

**apatel27** (4): Why is there a wub wub beat on a ballad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Lol upon first listen I thought Darude - Sandstorm was playing in the background.

**fadedblue09** (4): Yikes, this is super painful to listen to

**macnbee** (4): don't care

**skargardin** (4): this is rough

**Uberpigeon** (4): watch everyone have a comment saying "im not living for katy" or something

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I get this song confused with Pearl all the time… after all, they are equally boring...

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): Another clunky song here. It sounds weirdly atonal, or just not a well-thought out song. Like the instrumentals and Katy's singing don't mesh well together.

**Iris3271** (3.5): Sounds out of place

**slimboyfriend** (3.5): I don't know what she was trying to do with this song in any way. Vocally? A mess. Instrumentally? A mess. Lyrically? A cliche..... and a mess

**akanewasright** (3): The intro production was exciting… but this topline is kinda nothing

**celladonn** (3): I can appreciate the lyrics but this is so boring

**grey/0x976** (3): that bridge entirely ruining this song

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like someone put Rise over a weird dubstep track. The vocals dont even go with the instrumental at all JAFNDVKJADFVN

**nyoom** (3): that [writing on the wall] won't [incite me to start a holy war], because i can't read!

**2dina3dworld** (2): GET THERAPY

**daythreeinmiami** (2): This is boring and I hate how she annunciates some of the words in the verses. Also I feel like she’s screaming the chorus like that is a vocal strain hunni.

**frogaranaman** (2): I am currently living for the idea and eventual reality of eating a Canes box combo with no slaw extra toast butter on both sides with my future bear bf while snuggling during the winter

**Awkward\_King** (1): wtf is this bestie

**BeauMeringue212** (1): she sounds whiny here and the instrumental is awful. I wish you could give 2 0's

**cremeebrulee** (1): the delivery on this song is so weird, like she sounds super strained on the chorus

**Stryxen** (1): snooze

**wavingwolves** (1): i'm sorry but she sounds absolutely horrible in this and i'm surprised someone actually thought it was good enough to put it on an album

**xavieryes** (1): the album goes to shit from this track onwards

**thePotatofairyy** (0): Truly despise this song. Its like weirdly meta. Like, who IS this song living for? That intro is so tacky and cheap it loses me in 2 seconds. Singlehandedly brings the album quality down.

**TiltControls** (0): yawn

**seanderlust** (6.5): I just want to draw everyone's attention to the fact that when she says "she was a hurricane" I'm pretty sure that's not an echo effect- that's literally just katy in the booth saying "she was a hurricane cane cane cane cane"

**bigbigbee** (0): Why do they call it oven when you of in the cold food of out hot eat the food?

---

##Hurricanes

**AHSWeeknd** (10): If she was a pearl then who was the oyster? And if the oyster is supposed to be her mother, then would she also became an oyster in order to produce a pearl? Or is the oyster her father? In this world, perhaps women are pearls and men are oysters. But then how do they mate? Maybe pearls are just eggs, eventually breaking to let men into the world. If that’s true, then this world would make it seem like both men and women have both of the necessary reproductive systems and don’t require intercourse. That’s honestly a strange yet fascinating concept. It also brings into question the idea of periods.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): The way she flipped the lyrics around at the end! Bye!!!

**jman457** (7.3): John Steinbeck is shook

**ignitethephoenix** (7): corny but it’s not terrible. It’s just very on the nose

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): i thought it was cute

**hielord** (6.6): Kinda cute I guess

**plastichaxan** (6.5): this is fine but it kept going for too much without being that interesting

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): really sweet

**1998tweety** (6): feminist anthem

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): nope, too clichèd

**CrimsonROSET** (6): now that you’ve come out of your shell, maybe you can use that as a butt pad?

**UselessTacooo** (6): This is trying so hard to be a stunning ballad, and it barely falls flat. If she let this sit in her folder to work on for a little bit it could have been much better, but as it stands it feels like it’s missing something essential.

**waluigiest** (6): 11 years later I’m still not sure if I like this song

##Gusts of wind

**cherryices** (5.7): pearls are actually rather fragile, katy

**fadedblue09** (5.5): The most memorable part to me is how she says "Joan of Arc"

**ImADudeDuh** (5.5): is this about rupaul saying “nothing you say matters unless that camera is rolling”

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): What just happened. Just really forgettable

**joeeswift** (5): it’s not particularly good but it’s not particularly bad either

**teenwitches** (5): the lyrics sound like something emo teen girls would have scribbled in a composition notebook in 7th grade

**vayyiqra** (5): Another Katy song with autogenerated lyrics, only for empowerment ballads.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Would be a lot more effective if Katy had the vocal skill to pull it off… she did not...

**jackisboredtoday** (4.3): i’ve forgotten this song was on the album so many times now

**BeauMeringue212** (4): the first verse was building nicely and it's some of the best lyrics on the album. But it sounds so unfinished, more like a demo. Little bit disappointing

**macnbee** (4): pitchfork voice on this forgettable track, perry likens herself, bewilderingly, to the statue of liberty and joan of arc and not a more effective, modern heroine like Elsa from Frozen

**nyoom** (4): things katy perry misunderstands: tasteful literary references, the speed of avalanches, the trojan war(?)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (4): the verses are actually nice but the chorus is so trite and ruins it

**skargardin** (4): I was about to say this was a step up from who am i living for? but it just got worse than I remembered as the song progressed

**Stryxen** (4): mitski outsold on this and firework nobody has ever heard of katy parry

**TiltControls** (4): still yawning. I really wish the verses were a bit better here cause parts of the song sound quite nice

**anothertown** (3): (mr krabs voice me lovely douter pearl

**duochromepalmtree** (3): I think this song is mind numbingly boring. Sad too

**hikkaru** (3): do i have something on my face?

**thePotatofairyy** (3): Better than the previous track but still very underwhelming. Pretty boring melodically and cliché lyrically

**wavingwolves** (3): i guess this could be worse (as seen on who am i living for?) but it's still bad

**apatel27** (2): EDM beat plus bad vocals = meh

**cremeebrulee** (2): my firework score + the number of john steinbeck references

**daythreeinmiami** (2): The lyrics are so cringe and this song is just so simple? It just screams filler to me.

**grey/0x976** (2): why are these bridges ruining good songs

**TheQueenOfVultures** (2): The lyrics are sort of just a list of metaphors...

**Uberpigeon** (2): the only pearls i care about is mr krabs boss bitch daughter and the one in mitskis mouth

**nooodisaster** (1): please be produced by *.**** so i can give it my 0* FUCK

**sage** (1): crickets

**throwaway7650** (1): production is fine actually and the 1st verse/prechorus are fine but the chorus vocals are just horrible... and then it's all downhill from there

**xavieryes** (1): tedious

##Get her ass

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): “I can’t believe she’s become a shell of herself” — Me when Katy released “Roar”

**IIIHenryIII** (6): was she already hinting on her witness era with some of these deep cuts?

**frogaranaman** (1): you know, I was so confused for the longest time about how we went from Teenage Dream to Witness. but I had never listened to Teenage Dream in its whole before, so now that I'm listening through this record... I get how that transition happened

**akanewasright** (0): This song is about Katy’s own career after witness, in this essay I will

**bigbigbee** (7): So I expected this song to get 0s, but the sheer number of them (20 out of 94 ballots, or 21% of all ballots!) ended up surprising me. This placement is absolutely fair, but I echo the commenters who bemoan the fact that Nicki is not solo on this track, because I think that her parts are incredible.

**ReallyCreative** (3): RA RA like a dungeon dragon is perhaps one of Nicki's most iconic lyrics but this Eminem verse...

**seanderlust** (0): can eminem please stop yelling at me

---

##Dungeons and Dragons

**awhile2** (10): probably a top 5 eminem performance post his relapse, some of nickis best verses and the beat is wild. I think my pr for fastest mile was while i was listening to this song. Would be my 11 if kesha wasnt here

**fadedblue09** (10): Now where was this energy and explicitness in the rest of the album? Unfortunate that Eminem is here but can we do about it

**grey/0x976** (10): my 12 year old self had no business knowing these lyrics by heart and watching the lyric video every day before school

**shhhneak** (10): Nicki making Eminem say “raah, raah, like a dungeon dragon” is so powerful.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): damn this song still goes HARD

**waluigiest** (10): when I learned about Roman I fully radicalized.

**nooodisaster** (9.9): Subtracting 0.1 for the f-word but as an f-word lemme just say this SLAPS HARD. I used to be able to rap this word for word. 4 minutes later... oh wait i can still rap this word for word yikes. literally the list of offenses this song commits is too long to list. the only way this could be more problematic is if dr. luke had produced it. and yet.

**1998tweety** (9.5): this would be a 10 if not for Em, especially him calling me a f@g

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): Nicki definitely told Eminem that he could say faggot and I'm okay with that

**jsonphile** (9): LIKE A DUNGEON DRAGON play but actually would’ve been better without Eminem here

**sage** (9): i would give this a 10 if it was the lil wayne version but i hate eminem

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): eminem i despise you and the throne you sit on but "rah rah like a dungeon dragon" has lived singularly in my head for far too many years for me to get to this point in my life and let you ruin this moment for me

**wavingwolves** (8.4): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/626601739835015181/861113325714800640/image0.gif

**IIIHenryIII** (8): that's f*cking hilarious

**xxipil0ts** (7.5): The production gives me PC music and Arca vibes

**outsideeyess** (7.2): Lmao remember when ppl could call us these words in music marketed directly to us, and we just had to accept it? I grew up on the censored version and I'm grateful Eminem's part was better as mostly just DJ scratches.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I was gonna give this a 10 because it’s iconic and a D&D anthem but…there is a slur here. Also throwback to when I actually thought Nicki Minaj was British for several years.

**macnbee** (7): songs that make you run through your house on all fours

**moooo566** (7): ugh ugh like a dungeon dragon what the fuck is she talking about

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The emotional rollercoaster I went on, hearing Eminem saying “maggot,” mentally preparing myself for him to finish the rhyme, being pleasantly surprised he didn’t actually do that... then hearing him say the word anyways

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): I hope Timothee Chalamet reprises his legendary performance of this in Dune 2

**apatel27** (6.5): Eminem bro what you doing? Slim Shady should’ve retired in 2002

**astrologicalangel** (6): this has definitely grown on me

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I love the beat song this and Nicki is good, but Eminem just went full misogynist and homophobe with his parts … how to ruin a song 101

**Stryxen** (6): nicki ate, eminem… understood half an assignment

seanderlust: ## Settlers of Catan outsold

**akanewasright** (5.5): Why did Nicki give almost half of the song to Eminem? She’s on fire, but his verse doesn’t have the flow to be fun and the lyrics are just kinda… :audience:

**babadork** (5.5): It has been over ten years, but I still have so many questions about Roman Zolanski.

**AHSWeeknd** (5): what was she thinking

**anothertown** (5): Minus five for eminem

**nootnoot781** (5): eminem shut the fuck up challenge

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): this has amazing moments and repulsive elements

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): this song could've been so good if eminem could just shut up

**Uberpigeon** (4.5): how is roman holiday so fun but this is just.. :I

**2dina3dworld** (4): this started flopping after Nicki made dragon noises. Nicki dragon noises were the peak of music

**rotating3Dtext** (4): ew get out eminem

**TiltControls** (4): apparently this rate I am an eminem anti

**ImADudeDuh** (3): nicki’s and eminem’s verses are not good (ok nicki’s is good in the first half)

**nyoom** (3): dungeons and dragons speedrun WORLD RECORD (NOT CLICKBAIT)

**hielord** (2): wow I'm gonna pretend like I didn't listen to that... verse.

**UselessTacooo** (2): Eminem destroying a great song, no surprise here! He took a funny weird song into… not that.

**CrimsonROSET** (1): the journey i went on from ‘oh i can make a d&d joke i dont get to do that often in popheads’ to ‘eminem is here, oh no’ to ‘eminem why are you pissing on this girl’ to ‘eminem why are you saying gay slurs in the 21st century’

**duochromepalmtree** (1): I’m sorry this song is needlessly aggressive. Especially Eminem wtf. That verse is worse than I remember it

**thePotatofairyy** (1): already wasn't feeling it then I hear the f slur? Trash

**BeauMeringue212** (0): everything about this was uncomfortable to listen to.

**celladonn** (0): I'm booing and hissing and pooing and pissing

**daythreeinmiami** (0): It’s ironic a little bit isn’t it? Cause one could say that Nicki might be a has been. One would even say she’s mad someone else is in the top spot… Also Eminem, I got beef with Eminem y’all. And this verse really highlights it. Holy crap does he have just some disgusting lines towards woman and just his use of slurs it just rubs me the wrong fucking way. Like I love the production of this song and the I think Roman is hilarious but gah. Yeah nah I can’t get behind this in 2021.

**endcreditouilles** (0): honestly this song would be a masterpiece but Eminem's cringey & outdated lyrics and unnecessary slur ruin the song for me and take me out of it completely.

**frogaranaman** (0): if I had a nickel for every time I rated the lowest possible score an Eminem feature in the 2010s Ultimate Rate, I'd have two nickels. which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice, right?

**hikkaru** (0): im sorry but the fact that eminem has half this song to himself... he legitimately activates my fight or flight i hate how angry he is and combining that with the homophobic slur makes it even worse. no matter how entertaining nicki's parts and especially her british accent are i just hate listening to this version of the song so much

**imasalesman** (0): surely people don’t enjoy this

**Iris3271** (0): I really have no words to covey how bizarre this song was

**metanoira** (0): this just isnt as exciting as Roman Holiday and then Eminem used the f slur and it went from boring to terrible

**plastichaxan** (0): so nicki's need to collab with awful people is not new huh

**RandomHypnotica** (0): The instrumental feels obnoxious, eminem's verses are gross and disgusting, even without the slur, it's just a blegh song.

**skargardin** (0): I had completely blocked out of my memory how godawful this is

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): yall already know why

**teenwitches** (0): god this is insufferable

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (0): even ignoring the unironic usage of a homophobic slur this song still sucks

**TheQueenOfVultures** (0): It's ok because Elton John gave them both f slur passes

**throwaway7650** (0): yes I am a british cigarette, how did you know, em? is it because I used my 0 on a song you're a part of in a rate at, hm... gay little r/popheads? #0_killshot #nohomo https://urlzs.com/uDpWH

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (0): This is the first time I've ever given a zero... or any score below a five for that matter. I honestly hope this goes out day one. First off, there's too much going on. Secondly, we don't like homophobic men here.

**vayyiqra** (0): This starts good but the longer it goes, the worse it gets. Em's verse is truly horrible. We've had discourse about it, but I need to stress there are many problems with it. I don't like Em, but will argue some of his work has artistic merit. This does not. It's not just That Word; it's disgusting, poorly delivered, and worthless. I won't write an essay on it but it's one of the worst verses I've ever heard, and I've heard the Iggy freestyle (joke). Nicki's parts aren't great either, and her accent, which used to be qUirKy, is now cringe. This is awful.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I really had no idea how disliked this song was! I’ve always thought it was boppy and funny. The people have spoken, though…and the people have said fuck my opinion, am I right?

**seanderlust** (2.5): POV: you gave a suburban mother of three a few margaritas and asked her to write a song in the style of CupcaKke and the results were very not good

---

##Peacocks

**Awkward\_King** (10): no bc i dont have the energy to defend this rn but im right

**CrimsonROSET** (10): 1. I know this is gonna go out early so I don’t have to feel guilty boosting this a bit 2. This score is based single-handedly on the chatroulette video because it’s one of my favorite videos on the internet and it brings me infinite joy

**endcreditouilles** (10): this is the pièce de résistance of the album

**joeeswift** (10): much better than I remember??

**Stryxen** (10): amazing the bridge is literally fine art, would win the high concept pop rate

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): im just here for the controversy score

**waluigiest** (10): here katy perry subverts the patriarchal hegemony of externalized sexuality while acknowledging the labor it takes from both parties to transfer agency from the oppressors to the oppressed

**macnbee** (9): you say peacock and no one bats an eye. you say poopcock and everybody loses their mind

**nooodisaster** (9): THIS is what I came here for. She was self-aware how obvious the metaphor is, and let the lyrics be outrageous, idiotic, and hilarious. I miss when pop got to be funny.

**outsideeyess** (9): prefer the clean version's ock-ock-ock, but still a bop. the dramatic bridge is hilarious

**throwaway7650** (8.5): wish TD was a visual album to witness (heh) her vision for this

**xavieryes** (8.5): "pica" means dick in Portuguese so as a Brazilian this sounds more hilarious for me than it already is

**hielord** (8.4): Queen of Euphemisms

**akanewasright** (8): I’m not gonna lie the bridge is so fucking funny to me that I boosted this like 3 points

**davgonp** (8): This was my favorite song back then and I told everyone about it. I didn’t understand English. I had no idea what it was about.

**moooo566** (7.5): hey do you guys think she's singing about penises?

**teenwitches** (7.5): a horny bop that sounds like it could have been in high school musical 3

**cherryices** (7): i’m sorry but the bridge is comedy gold!

**IIIHenryIII** (7): 14-year-old me anthem; now I get why people thought I was gay. Fun fact: I always knew peacock was a metaphor for penis, but only last year I realized it sounds like "big c*ck"

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): its catchy and fun but a little grating

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): No, she isn't singing about that! Ya nasty! She's obviously singing about the one time she met an exotic bird trainer and he wouldn't show her the peacocks. Duh! Get your heads out of the gutter, you dirty minded freaks!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): This lowkey could be a Charli song, and y'all would gag

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): for those of us who were in primary school when this was released, some of us may remember how kids spread the rumour, in hushed, scandalised tones, about how this song was about “Sex”! And for some of us, this was our first experience with innuendo in music, and for all of us, it would certainly not be our last.

**anothertown** (6.5): me searching "oscar isaac" on various social media sites

**awhile2** (6): what a waste of some amazing stargate production. The bridge is so nice (in every regard except lyrics)

##Pigeons

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): fuck you for making me accidentally come out of my closet to my mom with the share button.

**daythreeinmiami** (4): ew imagine wanting to see Russel Brand’s peacock.

**babadork** (3): Better than I remember, but my brain still refuses to retain anything about it other than "Peacock, cock, cock"

**frogaranaman** (3): don't think this is how you get men with degradation kinks in your dms but then again I have never tried so who am I to speak on the issue

**ImADudeDuh** (3): you know what? I want songs this terrible again. This is awful lyrics, awful production and awful vocals. And guess what? I was entertained. Maybe not in the way that was intended, but it was much better than a boring 8 minute song.

**celladonn** (2.5): This isn't as bad as I remember it being but like it's still pretty fucking bad

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Who in their right mind said “this should follow Firework”

**apatel27** (2): Of the many horny katy songs this is one of them

**skargardin** (2): the only saving grace of this song is it being somewhat catchy I suppose

**TiltControls** (2): Despite the score I gave it this song is simultaneously a 2 and an 8

**BeauMeringue212** (1): rhyming peacock with biatch is the pinnacle of what the year 2010 was like

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (1): I’ve been a front line Katy Perry defender since 2010 but I just can’t. I can’t.

**duochromepalmtree** (1): no absolutely not.

**fadedblue09** (1): Any grown adult who still finds this funny should be ashamed of themselves

**nyoom** (1): i'm really showing my ass here but i first heard this song in one of those comedy clip compilations for hannibal of all shows. it was in a clip where will graham walks out of his house in boxers and they kept winding-rewinding that bit so the nbc logo kept overlapping with his crotch and hugh dancy probably should've served the video maker a c&d. anyway for all the terrible things about 2021 at least no one can make this song again

**shhhneak** (1): Insanely embarrassing that this follows a parade of bops.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): "I’m hoping it will be a gay-pride anthem,” Perry told EW’s Whitney Pastorek in our Summer Music Preview. ”Peacocks represent a lot of individuality…. It’s not just like, ‘I wanna see your bulge.”’ And then she went on to clarify: ”It does have the word c–k in it, but art is also in fart! It’s all in how you look at it.”

**Uberpigeon** (1): i want this to pea-stop!

**UselessTacooo** (1): burn it. It has nothing good going for it. The only good part is the Harmonies in the pre-chorus.

**astrologicalangel** (0): I was convinced I was being too harsh to to song, but then I relistened and no fuck this

**jsonphile** (0): this is not funny sexy or catchy in any way. This must be what WAP sounds like to people who hate WAP

**letsallpoo** (0): this song is an affront to god

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (0): You know, I really liked Peacock a few years back, but MAN this song has become incredibly grating & immature. No thank you

**rotating3Dtext** (0): no.

**slimboyfriend** (0): I can't believe a gay man was not involved in the writing of this song

seanderlust: ##Thank you for asking, PC! Twelve.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): how many comments are going to say this is camp

**jman457** (10): High Camp. This triggered a sexual awakening to our middle school grade. Suddenly half the artwork in art class was of a peacock.

**plastichaxan** (10): are you brave enough to give this the misunderstood camp piece the 10 it deserves?

**thePotatofairyy** (10): Camp at its finest. The bridge has some of the funniest lyrics in conjunction of the dramatic delivery

**metanoira** (8): camp

**1998tweety** (7): its camp

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s… camp? Am I using that word right?

**hikkaru** (6): i'm sorry i can't resist IT'S CAMP IT'S CAMP IT'S CAMP

**sage** (5.5): this is camp

**wavingwolves** (4.5): the worst sin of this song is being boring as hell beside the main camp lyric

**cremeebrulee** (3): camp but also bad

**RandomHypnotica** (1): it's camp, but the bad kind

**vayyiqra** (1): Haha the lady said peacock, which is a double entendre because a cock is a word for a bird and also a penis. Yes, I know, it's "camp". It's still bad. It's not only cringe, but insulting. Haha, she said "chicken" which is another bird. A male chicken is also called a cock. Get it? This song makes me die inside.

##I Can't Believe It's Not Camp

**jackisboredtoday** (4.9): this isn’t camp its just bad. points for the sheer audacity of it but still… yikes

**ignitethephoenix** (4): maybe I would call this camp if her vocals were better

**nootnoot781** (1): i promise you not everything is camp, this is just bad. like painfully so

**seanderlust** (8.6): this is soft and sweet and sincere and i love it for that. it's a tough pill to swallow that relationships aren't like the movies, and the ones with longevity actually take work and sometimes feel bad and don't have neat resolution. idk i'm thinking on main again, sorry. BOP WIG CITY POP

**ReallyCreative** (7.7): I don't hate this, but it is a Target brand Sara Bareilles song. It started off firmly day 2 but just collapsed as more ballots came in.

**bigbigbee** (7): It's sweet. I'm not sure I want piano ballads from her as much (and I think that her lyrics aren't always strong enough to support slow songs), but I like music that sounds like this.

---

##cinemaphiles

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Katy a kinophile confirmed.

**joeeswift** (10): I feel like this song lasted 10 mins but im not complaining

**outsideeyess** (9.6): :'(

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): My hot take is that this is really pretty and one of Katy’s best ballads, yeah it’s not deep but I still like it

**jman457** (9.2): really sweet even

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Nothing super ambitious here but it’s just really, really pretty.

**duochromepalmtree** (9): the best ballad Katy has ever put out! No question. I also think it’s a great closer.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is such an underrated song in my opinion, probably one of my personal favorites from Katy. I can definitely relate to the disappointment of experiencing love and having it not be like the idealized image we see plastered all over pop culture. It’s a beautiful ending track!

**waluigiest** (9): I love to pretend like I relate to this song

**1998tweety** (8.5): cute

**nyoom** (8): katy perry: he'll be the one that, finishes your / me, nodding sagely: sandwiches. i know this one

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Oh no, not a ballad! Ugh, I relate! Can't wait for this to go out on day one because of all of the balladphobics.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): this is gonna get robbed huh

**nooodisaster** (7.5): I still to this day do not know if this song is supposed to be romantic or not.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Katy is the worst part of this track unfortunately, she's not bad, it just has a lot of potential that feels like it's not met

**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): Really grown on me over the years! The prechorus sounds fantastic and a huge highlight of the song! Katy sounds fantastic on here as well!

**awhile2** (7): usually dont like ballads but this gives me disney original movie soundtrack vibces which i fw and i love the drums in it

**fadedblue09** (7): Very Disney-ish ballad. Reminds me of Fergie - Finally

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): its nice but the vocals don't carry it

**vayyiqra** (6): Every time I hear this think of "Just Like the Movies" by Regina Spektor, which is a better song.

##What are these "moving pictures"?

**TiltControls** (5.5): I just wish there was a little more to the song. I don't think it builds up as well as it thinks it does

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): not my thing lol

**daythreeinmiami** (5): It was an okay song. It was really meh for me. There was like a high end frequency in there in like the pad they used that was super duper insulting to my ears. I was listening to my CD version though (that someone had donated to the op shop. I mean it was a win for me I got this album for $2 but also slightly insulted that someone would donate this like where is your taste hello?)

**imasalesman** (5): silence ballad

**skargardin** (5): painfully mediocre I fear

**2dina3dworld** (4): I always tried to like this as a child because I thought enjoying ballads made you deep, turns out ballads can be good but this is not.

**akanewasright** (4): this is perfectly okay but I never feel the need to hear this again. Also wtf is up with the vocal production?

**anothertown** (4): she went very wig here

**CrimsonROSET** (4): and that’s on unrealistic expectations

##:eggplant:

**AHSWeeknd** (10): what ever happened to Taio Cruz?

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I don’t know if this score is controversial but I don’t care I love this song. This song to me was so underrated in 2010 and it deserved more wait one second this isn’t the version I’m used to. That’s okay it’s still slapping just as hard. But yeah this song fucking slaps. Hard.

**plastichaxan** (10): this song predicted the way the internet would work for years and years to come wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I always associate this with Take It Off in my head for some reason, but they're both 10's anyway so it doesn't matter

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): FINALLY RECOGNITION FOR THIS SONG

**throwaway7650** (10): I'm mixed on the electrotrash genre but I love this tbh. taio cruz one of many that recognized kesha's potential (as he should), she's such a star. this is my bonus rate winner but if it doesn't, princess of china FTW

**xavieryes** (10): invented nudes

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): asking for nudes poetically

**outsideeyess** (9.4): how i learned about nudes

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**thePotatofairyy** (9): Has that "2010s" sound that I adore. Just fun mindless pop in the best of ways

**wavingwolves** (8.3): got a memory that hit me just like a that's so raven vision about how much i looped this song during christmas in 2010... what was going ON with me

**akanewasright** (8): It’s the way I asked my parents if I could buy this from iTunes when I was like 11 and didn’t know why they said no

**celladonn** (8): When this started I thought it sounded awful but I was shaking my ass more and more as the song went on

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I… don’t know why I like this

**skargardin** (8): the beat drop REALLY caught me off guard

**jman457** (7.6): Kesha ate here

**waluigiest** (7): I LOVED THIS SONG it sucks but I still think it’s fun

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): unfortunately this is the worse Taio Cruz notable singles but we still stan Taio. Also TIL Taio wanted Gaga on this at first

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I forgot Taio Cruz, and by extension this song, existed for a good three years before this moment

**apatel27** (6): wub wub sucks

#:well:

**BeauMeringue212** (4.5): 2010's songs about sexting on Motorolas are the funniest shit ever lmao

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): I was so prepared for the lyrics to be super dirty, but they’re just boring and repetitive? Where’s the detail??

**anothertown** (2): Oh interesting it's complete ass

**frogaranaman** (2): if a man asked me to send a "dirty picture" I would not send a nude out of principle

**jsonphile** (2): sometimes I wonder if Taio Cruz deserved better than just having two hits and disappearing but then I hear a song like this and nah we made the right choice

**2dina3dworld** (1): this is less wub wub and more blub blub

**duochromepalmtree** (1): I have never heard this song before for good reason. I will be submitting a bill for the distress I experienced listening to it.

**fadedblue09** (1): This is a Taio Cruz hate account

**macnbee** (1): are they for real with this…

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): The week Taio Cruz was bullied off Tik Tok was as retribution for this

**bigbigbee** (5): This track was pretty consistently low day 1, and I get it, though it’s certainly grown on me since the first time I heard it. I like the theme of self-confidence and strength. I agree with the commenter /u/thePotatofairyy that this song is hurt by the early, seemingly out of place instrumental section, because I think the intro is very promising.

---

##Queens of spatial awareness

**throwaway7650** (10): this absolutely does not deserve to be the least-streamed track

**awhile2** (9): the first ten seconds of this song is one of my favorite intros to any song ever. I wish the rest of the song was as strong. Also is it just me or does the sample sound like gaga

**waluigiest** (9): okay but the drama is excellent

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): not this deep cut being my fave track on the album

**jsonphile** (8.5): probably the best production on this album

**UselessTacooo** (8): those heavy synths are to die for

**vayyiqra** (8): This is good only because of Swiss Beatz.

**sage** (7.5): this is bottom 1 on the standard but still good

**thePotatofairyy** (7.5): I'm conflicted. It's a pretty damn amazing track!.... with the exception of that instrumental break after the 30 second mark that lasts an entire damn minute. The rest of the song so is damn strong its a shame that portion exists.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): The production is actually so good.

**babadork** (7): Great verses but a boring chorus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): is it controversial to say that nicki’s pop songs >>>> nicki’s rap songs

**outsideeyess** (6.8): I never realized how much of this song is a part that sounds like a weird transition but that's supposed to be the chorus

**1998tweety** (6.5): me when i show up to class 20 minutes late because i missed the train

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this is going to go out early day 2 and no one is going to miss it

**hielord** (6.5): I'm not trying to trash the song by saying this but the fact that is less than 3 minutes long makes it really good lmao.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): I like the piano/drum combo on that beat but it really needed more of a hook, and the themes of this haven’t held up for me as much as Nicki’s best work

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): not my type

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Definitely has one of the cooler instrumentals on the album.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ‘Why is it that you could only see the worst in me?’ the joke writes itself

##Asking for directions

**jman457** (5.2): Sounds like filler

**apatel27** (5): The backing track is more interesting than Nicki here

**ignitethephoenix** (5): zzz

**TiltControls** (5): There's some sort of punch just missing to the song. It builds and builds super well and then doesn't really pay off all that well

**akanewasright** (4): Nicki’s rapping is solid as usual but there’s not really enough of that to get me through the rest

**duochromepalmtree** (4): I honestly think this song is extremely boring

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Is she about to fall asleep?

**daythreeinmiami** (3): This music sounds she heard it playing in spa and she just began spitting lines and then she was like ‘I’m gonna need the spa music your using cause I got something here’ and then gave the spa music track to the producer and they gave it a modern flare cause let’s be honest all spa day relaxation music sounds like it comes from the late 90’s and this track sounds like the late 90’s and the early 2010’s had a baby.

**frogaranaman** (3): and here I go press skip!

**IIIHenryIII** (3): the beat is nice but that's about it

**Stryxen** (3): may as well not be !!

**AHSWeeknd** (1): what was she trying to go for??

**fadedblue09** (1): I want to like the message but this bored me to tears

**bigbigbee** (8): STEPHEN! DIDJA PUT YA NAME IN THE GOBLET OF FIYAH energy

**seanderlust** (7): here's the thing: I've listened to this album off and on for more than a decade, this song included. With all that listening time, I did not realize how serious Kesha was in writing this song until our rate came out and The Discourse(TM) started. I had always thought that she was only partially serious and was cranking her stalker vibes up to an 11 to basically take the piss out of herself but apparently I was wrong (also there's some other parts of this song that she's talked about that I won't go into detail but were a little :peloton:). Still, seven points for all the time I spent in blissful ignorance.

---

##Calling me

**nootnoot781** (10): this will be songeneality <3

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the way she made fun of taylor before it was cool

**outsideeyess** (9.7): you're missing out on a pretty neat sweater, Stephen!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.4): This opener is giving "Hide and Seek" realness, problem on purpose. This song is so charming and audacious. Kind of reminds me of an early Kate Nash song. Even when Kesha is sounding insecure she's full of personality here.

**nooodisaster** (9): The closest we'd get to non "$" Kesha for years. And I paid it dust on release. It's actually SO good. Hilariously specific, still super catchy, weirdly wonderful. And not a trace of .** in the song credits.

**teenwitches** (9): insert overly attached girlfriend meme here

**davgonp** (8.8): This one sounds so fresh.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): He’s just not that into you.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): underrated

**celladonn** (8): I love the intro

**daythreeinmiami** (8): I guess time has softened me to this song because I used to hate this song but now I find it really cute.

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I remember LOVING this song and it didn’t exactly hold up but it’s still super fun

**nyoom** (8): https://jrpg.moe/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/smtsteven1.jpg WHY WON'T YOU CALL ME

**shhhneak** (8): I hear Neue Kesha on this and honestly I love it.

**slimboyfriend** (8): anyone who spells their name with the ph and not the v is worth writing a song about

**BeauMeringue212** (7.5): it's a cliche, but we love a good slow tempo song to break up an album a bit right?

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's cute, but feels a little out of place tbh

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Mmm mmm mmmm Hey Stephen, I know looks- Oops wrong song! My bad!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): imagine being in love with someone named stephen lmfao

**Uberpigeon** (7): fun fact this was written about Stephen Merchant!

**waluigiest** (7): he won’t call you because he spells his name the gay way

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): hey Stephen? More like BYE Stephen

**1998tweety** (6): this is doing a bit too much for me

**AHSWeeknd** (6): King or Colbert?

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I kind wish it was more obnoxious?

**wavingwolves** (6): sorry to this stephen but the stephen from the taylor swift song won by being the muse for a better song

##Has my number saved under "DO NOT ANSWER!"

**hielord** (5.8): such a flop it doesn't even have the lyrics synced to the song on Spotify

**endcreditouilles** (5.7): hey stephen i know looks can be deceiving i'm actually kesha why won't you call me

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): listen its cringy but i fear it still bops

**sage** (5.5): its cute

**anothertown** (5): she's giving theater kid

**CrimsonROSET** (5): wow this song wasnt even ok when it came out was it

**fadedblue09** (5): besides the cringeworthy fetishizing of student-teacher romances, that spoken word thing is unbearable

**metanoira** (5): its giving you

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): this kinda sounds creepy af now. also "i can't take rejection" relatable

**jman457** (3.2): me when my dad wont call me back

**akanewasright** (3): Yeah knowing that the story behind this is not only completely true but that Kesha had a legit pattern of stalking makes me not enjoy it much at all. I like the beginning though, and it almost sounds sweet at times

**cremeebrulee** (3): what mfer named stephen has both kesha and taylor down this bad

**hikkaru** (3): i think he won't call you bc this is the worst song on the album

**macnbee** (3): god this is like nails on a chalkboard

**throwaway7650** (2.5): the chorus is kind of a mess... that one vocal distortion is doing a good laura les imitation I guess? overall it sounds like an prototype KKB demo unearthed from a decade ago. kesha and taylor we're going to need to have a pep talk about what went wrong with songs with "stephen" in the title (also certain parts of this song remind me of the dear baby girl/briona video)

**UselessTacooo** (2.5): it sounds like a bad musical theatre song, but on drugs

**Stryxen** (2): why would i call you stephen your name is kesha

**vayyiqra** (2): Why is Kesha trying to sound like Imogen Heap on a stalker anthem? I want to like this, but the concept is so bad. This is a bizarre song even by Kesha standards. Why is she doing a bad accent? That's Nicki's thing! Why is she talking about petplay? I'm done.

**skargardin** (1): I'm sorry but I find nothing enjoyable here

**TheQueenOfVultures** (1): The production butchers her voice here sadly.

**ignitethephoenix** (0): the desperation here, girl please find another man I’m begging

**joeeswift** (0): she ruined the amazing four track run, this is just terrible

##we said FUCK stephen king

**Saison\_Marguerite** (2): Now I remember why I never had this song saved. PSA to pop girls: stop writing songs about guys named Stephen

**frogaranaman** (1): his name is Stephen, that's the first red flag

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): FUCK the name stephen its such a stupid fucking name why cant you just spell it steven like a normal person or why cant it just be pronounced like stef-fon the way it’s spelled dumb fucking name and a dumb song to boot

##I get what you mean, but Imogen Heap is Imogen Heap for gays

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Ke$ha is just Imogen Heap for gays

**seanderlust** (9.3): an instrumental that is very interesting for the time combined with nicki at her most self-effacing and vulnerable makes for one of the most interesting songs on the album

**bigbigbee** (8.5): The backing instrumentals and the choice of drum machine (?) are very 2010 in a way that makes me feel nostalgic. I can picture myself sitting on my high school's quad at sunset when listening to this song. It’s not an interesting anecdote….but it’s true! As someone else pointed out, it’s very Stars

---

##Saving the day

**fadedblue09** (10): The instrumental here is weirdly mesmerizing. Also one of her decent attempts at singing tbh

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Wow, This is really good. It's so personal too. I'll be honest I didn't expect this from her.

**davgonp** (9.4): I’ve always loved this song.

**1998tweety** (9): the production on this is immaculate

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): this is not the type of track I expected to hear from nicki, but the spacy production kinda works great

**sage** (8.5): i wanted a breakbeat song because of the intro but this is still good

**TiltControls** (8.5): a little repetitive, but still nice

**xavieryes** (8.5): It's not your fault, I'm a bitch, I'm a motherfuckin' monster

**wavingwolves** (8.1): what pinkpantheress song is this

**jman457** (8): Slow nicki is the best

**anothertown** (7): breakbeats

**awhile2** (7): this is like if aphex twin produced a pop rap track

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Nicki at this point the only person who can save you is yourself.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I kinda feel like I’m at a supermarket a little bit with the boops.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): this song is actually so pretty and I always forget that Nicki has a beautiful singing voice. But it’s sort of boring too.

**nooodisaster** (7): peach in every single mario game

**nootnoot781** (7): pinkpantheress print

**nyoom** (7): this album is a fascinating exploration in how thin the line between "pop" and "indie pop" can be. the drum machine breakdown sections are really cool and again, very stars to me. and the vocals are there too i guess

**waluigiest** (7): it’s giving powerpuff girls theme song

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): not bad just boring

**metanoira** (6.5): production on this is so confusing

##Sending loving, praying energy to that boat capsized in the harbor

**IIIHenryIII** (5): "I'm a monster", at least she's self-aware. Oh, wait… never mind

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): not bad but not good

**UselessTacooo** (5): serving heart rate monitor

**apatel27** (4): sounds pretty generic

**CrimsonROSET** (4): that snare is just so overused at this point

**frogaranaman** (4): save me from listening to this song ever again

**macnbee** (4): the middle of this album is such a slog I'm sorry

**SideBTrack8** (4): the Funky Drummer sample was wasted on this

**throwaway7650** (4): tbh I do like nicki's singing voice but this song is rather... filler

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): If you take away the rapping, what exactly is there left for Nicki? It’s not like she’s a great singer or anything

**akanewasright** (3): decent production but….. there’s kinda nothing here melodically

**Stryxen** (3): this song is a mess and not in an interesting way just in a teases you with being an interesting mess way

**thePotatofairyy** (3): The production doesn't not fit? It reminds me of that video of that mascot in Japan playing the drums extremely vigorously.

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Wasn’t there a video of her performing this and she pretends to die at the end?

**celladonn** (2): That beep sound that plays constantly is really annoying and mixed way too loud

**Awkward\_King** (1): ive been so funnily self conscious of saying "this isnt giving" since i saw that meme of like imagine having a conversation with a straight person and they're just like "giving WHAT" but likw..,, this really isnt giving

##Let's get some shoes....let's party....

**sage** (10): omg kesha doing nu-disco before it was cool??? her impact omfg FAD LIPA IS OVER.

**throwaway7650** (10): the production is insane tbh (and no dr. luke again #yass)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.1): This song is so a slinking synth song. It's sooo catchy and the lyrics again are sarcastic and fun. I love the committment Kesha has to this character. Love bimboification!!!

**anothertown** (9): electroclash yup yup yup yup yup yup

**daythreeinmiami** (9): WE CAN KEEP IT KINKY AND SHE KEPT IT KINKY.

**waluigiest** (9): let’s get some shoes….. let’s get some shoes…

**wavingwolves** (8.8): music to have a dressing up montage to

**hikkaru** (8.5): this being crazy underrated.... it'll be one of her first out for sure but it bops

**fadedblue09** (8): This is a pleasant surprise! Very slick and low-key, which makes it (relatively) not obnoxious

**jman457** (8): Really sleek vocal performance and production

**nootnoot781** (8): she has a better song called boots and i think that proves things are just better without men

**outsideeyess** (7.9): this was always my least favourite on the album

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this slaps, also a precursor to the Rainbow era??

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is kind of hot i think?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): this song feels like a trashy 00s reality show and i mean that as a compliment

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): same

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): I'll take the boots... but you can keep the boys.

**akanewasright** (6): Boots on Rainbow outsold, but this is also solid

**frogaranaman** (6): totally missed the opportunity to make a house track titled this and play off the "boots n cats" joke

**nooodisaster** (6): This may be a fan favorite, and if it is, I'm sorry. Suffer.

**skargardin** (6): well, the production slays

##Bitch don't wear no shoes in my house!!!

**apatel27** (5): Black Eyed Peas reject

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): cant decide if this is bad or camp and my head hurts so this is getting a middling score

**shhhneak** (4.2): We are DEEP in the album filler.

**macnbee** (4): booooOOOOOOOTS….boYYYYYYIESS

**nyoom** (4): rah rah like a boy in boots

**TiltControls** (4): Shoes - Kelly

**Uberpigeon** (4): i give this a boot

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Not a fan of either these things tbh.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): so people sing this song to learn how to beatbox???

**astrologicalangel** (2): this sounds like a rough draft of a song

**BeauMeringue212** (2): Her Joanne era

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): this sounds like it was written for a shoe store commercial

**thePotatofairyy** (2): Sounds like a MySpace era song.

**UselessTacooo** (2): help? What? Excuse me?

**Verboten\_Prince** (2): This sounds incomplete

**AHSWeeknd** (1): it’s that “shoes” song but worse

**Stryxen** (1): how many people were scared me too i was really really scared

##Kissy Christmas, Ru!

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is the definition of a guilty pleasure, what a banger

**endcreditouilles** (10): this was the first time i heard the word "panties" in a song and lemme tell you it awoke some energies in me

**frogaranaman** (10): they really decided to get onto every single "misogyny that slaps" playlist with this one

**moooo566** (10): 3OH!3 have been in this rate a LOT and it owns

**nootnoot781** (10): ca-

**RandomHypnotica** (10): it's weird just how many times 3OH!3 has featured in this rate by now

**skargardin** (10): now here's a classic!!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i still love this song unironically

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): Probably gross that 3oh3 are the ones singing this but it bops

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Dumb party song? That's all an introvert like me needs to feel like they're living their life on the edge

**outsideeyess** (9.3): i love how dramatic the production is in the verses

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**plastichaxan** (9): 3oh!3 make the most douchebag music i shouldn't like them

**celladonn** (8): Regrettably this bops a bit

**ignitethephoenix** (8): name a more iconic trio than 3Oh3! and Kesha

**apatel27** (7.5): Douchebag Lonely Island strikes again

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): im ashamed to admit this but i have such strong nostalgia for this song and its bc it was in a fucking mario x peach amv i used to watch a lot when i was 9

**waluigiest** (7): 3OH!3 fully epitomizes the emergent raunchy/sleazy pop culture that peaked in like 2009-2011

**throwaway7650** (6.5): kesha/the chorus carries (blah x3 outsold)

**macnbee** (6): the video for this is a core memory of mine but not in like a good way

**vayyiqra** (6): Enough 3OH!3

##Misandrists...M I S AH N D R Y....

**akanewasright** (5): These two never recaptured the blah blah blah magic huh

**rotating3Dtext** (5): DISGUSTING

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The severe underuse of Kesha

**anothertown** (4): i know this has its stans but i think this is deeply inferior to the previous singles and 30h3 was past their time anywayz

**daythreeinmiami** (4): Blah Blah Blah was better by far. I actually haven’t heard this song in years. The chorus goes alright but the verse is just underwhelming. Ugh the kissing sounds in the bridge make me shudder in disgust.

**TiltControls** (4): the verses are iconic but the chorus is so forgettable

**wavingwolves** (3.1): the lip smacking sounds oh god make it stop please MAKE IT STOP

**duochromepalmtree** (3): it’s bad. Really bad.

**AHSWeeknd** (2): what ever happened to 3OH!3?

**babadork** (1): I wish I could give this my 0.

**BeauMeringue212** (1): fridget anthem

##we don't need to compare two bad bitches like this

**jsonphile** (3): why did we tolerate 3OH!3 when Cobra Starship was right there doing the same thing but better

##They miss the old Kanye, chop up the soul Kanye..

**1998tweety** (10): rest in peace 😔

**sage** (9.8): it gave

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): I love it. It’s lyrically flawless, and while the production is a little convoluted, it’s really catchy and fun.

**shhhneak** (9.4): Ma’am I think you should address the 2021 Nicki first…

**akanewasright** (9): This actually makes me kinda emotional…

**nyoom** (9): "you see, for every bad, i did a ton of good" uh haha i sure hope so! ...haha...

**Stryxen** (9): honestly i’d usually hate this but i just kinda love it

**thePotatofairyy** (9): Great flow, great production, pretty damn interesting lyrics! A highlight!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): yes I do miss the old Nicki more than ever

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): I love songs like this. Where the artist is talking to their past self.

**outsideeyess** (7.8): love the concept, but part of it sounds like the synths have been ripped from Vengaboys' 1998 hit "Boom, Boom, Boom, Boom!!"

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): I need that Old Nicki. That best game in the game Nicki. That not tweeting about her cousin’s testicles Nicki.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): corny, but sweet

**wavingwolves** (7.2): i miss the old nicki? straight from the gold nicki?

**rotating3Dtext** (7): bring the old nicki back...

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This song always makes me burst out laughing… I don’t know if it’s the hilariously cheesy piano line, Nicki’s ahem attempt at singing the chorus, or just the fact that this track should be an introspective and emotional look back at her career, but it just turns into another round of Nicki bragging about what a badass bitch she is. But I guess I still enjoy it. It’s quintessential Nicki

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): imagine an updated version of this lmao

**TiltControls** (6.5): it's cute ig

**hielord** (6.1): yes please, call her back

**celladonn** (6): Excited for everyone to make the same "the old Nicki can't come to the phone right now" joke

**duochromepalmtree** (4): boring and I would never chose to listen to this song

**TragicKingdom1** (4): she really set herself up with this one

**2dina3dworld** (3): the lawyer line is really aging like a wine made with milk

**seanderlust** (9): this is simultaneously one of the worst songs i've ever heard in my life and so, so great

---

##Named "That Bitch"

**sage** (11): haters you ca-

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It’s a little annoying but I don’t want it to seem like I’m sabotaging the album so I’m giving this a ten

**Awkward\_King** (10): if nicki didnt literally deserve to be in prison id 11 this

**grey/0x976** (10): nicki noona

**nootnoot781** (10): haters you can kill yourselves

**nyoom** (10): the combined forces of "competition? why yes i would love some" and "YOU A CHIHUAHUA, I'M A ROTTWEILA" makes this the easiest score in this rate

**throwaway7650** (10): help not them being koreaboos in the MV

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): "I can't believe it, it's so amazing / I can't believe it, this beat is banging / I can't believe it (I can't believe it)", literally me after checking this out

**1998tweety** (9): "haters you can kill yourself" me to everyone who has this album with an average under 5

**akanewasright** (9): This is so bright and fun and aaaaa I wanna dye my skin pink and plot something destructive in a cute way

**astrologicalangel** (9): this song is objectively bad but I actually love it

**waluigiest** (9): 4 full minutes of camp

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I'd be lying if I said this wasn't my favorite Nicki Minaj song in 2010/2011

**hikkaru** (8): this is so camp

**ignitethephoenix** (8): it’s camp except that one line saying haters should k*ll themselves

**nooodisaster** (8): another hilarious song, but perhaps unintentionally this time. "hater you can KILL yourself" truly the artist of our generation.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this is so stupid…

**Uberpigeon** (8): when i tell you i spat my drink out after a certain line

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): for some reason my high school cheerleading team used this song for tryouts so will.i.am singing "check this motherfucker out" is what soundtracked my "she's cheer captain and i'm on the bleachers" moment djfhjsdf

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this is a terrible song, it’s got problematic lyrics for days, it’s been parodied by Shane Dawson… but it’s so stupidly awful that it goes around to being absolutely hilarious purely because of how messy it is and how it seems like the song and it’s legacy are trying to fill out some problematic song bingo.

**skargardin** (7): Oh wow I had completely forgotten about this music video

**thePotatofairyy** (7): I literally thought this song was a tiktok edit until this rate. It's outdated but in that fun 2010s way. Overstays it welcome a bit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): cuz J hate that guy here.

**anothertown** (6): ugh this is making me reflect on how i tried to make Nicki's first verse my entire personality in 2011. this hurts

**duochromepalmtree** (6): I cannot in good conscious give this higher than a six because it sounds like how it feels to wear uggs with a denim mini skirt. This is one of my three year olds favorite songs now though

**frogaranaman** (6): incredible 2010 energy in this one

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): r r r roll up to the party with my crazy pink wig

##probably named Stephen smh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): never liked this one

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): inb4 will.i.am gets “it’s camp”ed into another songeniality win

**ImADudeDuh** (5): oh no, not this one

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (5): I would like to know who thought this collab would be a good idea, so that way I can lock them in a room and play this song on repeat at full volume and torture them with there own product.

**Iris3271** (4.5): Haters you should kill yourself bumped this up two points

**fadedblue09** (4): ok but this is literally just will.i.am's song

**TheQueenOfVultures** (4): Falls apart after the haters you should kill yourselves

**BeauMeringue212** (3): somebody is gonna call this hyperpop or camp or whatever, but I'm just gonna call it bad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VN4AzqX_MDE

**letsallpoo** (3): where is the cheryl version so i can give it a lower score

**wavingwolves** (3): wow (but in a bad way)

**macnbee** (2): worse than when she tweeted about her cousin's friend's testicles

**shhhneak** (1): Genjutsu ass song. This felt 12 minutes long.

##Haters you can kill the radio star

**outsideeyess** (11): fucking brilliant use of a sample. this was probably my most-played song of 2011. this 11 is for will.i.am, not nicki.

**awhile2** (10): like 95% of williams solo discography is trash but this song is absolutely amazing. The sample and the bridge are what make it

**endcreditouilles** (9.7): video killed the queen radio star

**moooo566** (9): im a sucker for a good sample

**teenwitches** (8): i want to hate using video killed the radio star as a sample but i can't

**hielord** (7.2): Nicki killed the radio star, but honestly, is that surprising? She has this ability of killing careers, including her own.

**vayyiqra** (7): Only good because it samples a better song.

**jman457** (6.8): Streaming killed the video star

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): Video killed the radio star didn't deserve this

**daythreeinmiami** (6.5): That line, you know the one, alwwaaays threw me off and I never liked it so this song loses half a point for that. Other than that I think that this was a really neat way to sample Video Killed the Radio Star and it really gave it another life. But I have beef with the bridge. Like Will.i.am was really doing some weird drops in his production in the early 2010’s and I really didn’t like it.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): the sensory overload on the first 30 seconds of this song from the sample to the message to the haters i felt like it was a fever dream

**Stryxen** (6): can this owo girl in the background shut up

**babadork** (5): I love the sample, but I am not here for two will. i. am verses.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): This sample had good potential and they just… ughhhhh

**jsonphile** (4): I’m sorry if I hear this song I’m just going to want to listen to video killed the radio star (an absolute bop)

**celladonn** (3.5): Video Killed The Radio Star didn't deserve this

**TiltControls** (2): ngl I hate the sample use here

**plastichaxan** (1): every “oh-oh” made me drop my score, the woo-hoo effect

**apatel27** (0): Where to begin? The absolute waste of ‘Video Killed the Radio Star’, the terrible lyrics, the extreme repetitiveness of it all and will.i.am. It isn’t camp, it’s just bad. Campness requires a degree of ironic exaggeration, this is just dull.

**UselessTacooo** (0): insufferable. The autotune needs to go, and who the hell greenlit the “oooow ooow”.

**seanderlust** (5.7): the song is pretty mid but what in the world is up with that conversation in the second verse? :peloton: maybe this dude should leave tbh

---

##Transparent

**1998tweety** (10): emotional bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): this is super cute, I can’t tell what she’s saying but I’m living for it (update: I now know what she’s saying and goddammit it’s no longer cute but why does it bop so hard)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i played this everytime my 2011 boyfriend and i had a fight which was like once a day

**TiltControls** (9): maybe the best of Nicki's sappy pop stuff. listening to this makes me feel all nostalgic for 2010

**sage** (8.8): YASSSSSS

**akanewasright** (8.5): This song is kinda disgusting in every way… but unfortunately it was comforting to me when I was feeling shitty and insecure

**jman457** (8.5): first nicki song i ever stanned

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I forgot about this song, it’s better than I remember

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Every time I hear this song I'll always think of that one video where she lip-syncing this and she put the mic down. It's so funny to me.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): bad chorus, bad acting, bad human being, not that bad song

**CrimsonROSET** (7): the whiplash from the last two songs to this is insane but i don’t think i want to hear nicki say shit ever again

**UselessTacooo** (7): the verses are stunning, but like with most Nicki songs, the chorus is boring and feels tacked on.

**xavieryes** (7): Oh I see they really got you gassed, like I'm a thing of the past. Betta slow down dummy, you about to crash. Stank pussy ho, I'm givin you a bath. Thermometer in hand and I'm comin for ya ass. Who you think you gettin past? I see right through you, your whole shit is made of glass.

**nooodisaster** (6): she has better ballads tbqh it's aged fairly badly.

##Opaque

**duochromepalmtree** (5): it’s just boring and the hook does nothing for me

**frogaranaman** (5): title accurately describes what this song did to my ears

**Stryxen** (5): this gets more annoying as it goes on lemme turn my ears off for now

**TheQueenOfVultures** (5): this is like a draft of crying game

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Nicki I don’t care… leave him idk

**waluigiest** (5): when Nicki is bland, she is not successful

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): this sounds like n-dubz (derogatory)

**BeauMeringue212** (4.5): nice break from the homophobia and feces but that's about it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): God she was really serving an absolute plague of mediocre rap ballads back then.

**daythreeinmiami** (4): When I first heard this song I honestly had no idea Nicki could sing and I thought it was feature so it really surprised me in a good way. Also the video clip to this is iconic honestly her body is out of this world amazing. Anyway praise aside I find the production to be kinda generic and it’s not her strongest in my opinion.

**fadedblue09** (4): Terrible rapping, terrible singing, go girl give us nothing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this chorus deserves to be on a better song

**AHSWeeknd** (2): Did we ever find out how he did that?

**thePotatofairyy** (2): It's just boring.

**throwaway7650** (1.5): this song describes nicki and her fans at this point tbh

**ReallyCreative** (9): camp

**bigbigbee** (8.5): "Electric Guitar" is not a sound I associate with this album but I think it works great here. (I really like guitars in music). This is an interesting choice to close the original album (a.k.a. non-deluxe album) because it feels a bit out of place, sonically, with the very synthy, electronic rest of the album...but I think it works still!

---

##Stream Unwritten

**fadedblue09** (10): The kind of nostalgic production I live for. Now why does she rap better in the poppier songs?

**moooo566** (10): i really like this

**sage** (10): this song is so fun idgaf i love it

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): cute bop

**waluigiest** (9): it’s just a fun song to end a fun album!!

**emayzee** (8.8): a combination i didn't know i needed

**1998tweety** (8.5): we love Natasha's charity

**nyoom** (8.5): perpetually in awe of nicki's ability to take words that don't conventionally rhyme (e.g. "innuendo" and "depend on") and flow them together so smooth i don't even notice. you know someone's good when they make it look easy

**TiltControls** (8.5): very fun! always glad to hear Natasha Bedingfield

**outsideeyess** (8.1): I've always thought Natasha sounded like Bieber in the opening

**ImADudeDuh** (8): we love a ROBBED masked singer queen

**throwaway7650** (8): good but natasha on the hook just makes me want to stream the animal title track instead. kylie outsold too

**UselessTacooo** (8): way better than I ever expected. It’s a perfect way to close the album (aside from the bonus tracks of course). This is what Nicki is best at

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): everything about this is so... surreal?? How did Natasha end up on a random deep cut with Nicki in 2010???

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): they really pulled this collab out of a hat huh

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7.5): Not Nicki pulling a Taylor and only giving Natasha the backing vocals and adlibs!

**hielord** (7): Natasha's vocals go so well this song, I love it

**rotating3Dtext** (7): NATASHA BEDINGFIELD?

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7): an edging anthem!

**xxipil0ts** (7): This felt like such a random collab but it somehow worked.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): this isn’t actually good but its datedness reminds me of better times, and its still just very funny to think of Natasha Bedingfield on a Nicki song

**AHSWeeknd** (6): What was this album supposed to be??

**awhile2** (6): was this the last thing anyone ever heard natasha bedingfield on ?

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): natasha ruins this sorry

**vayyiqra** (6): Natasha is like Nicki in that she can write amazing songs, and sometimes does, but then has whole albums of filler.

##The Pantene Girl??

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): what

**akanewasright** (5): The opening guitar made me think I was about to hear All Night by Beyoncé… kinda bitter that didn’t happen

**daythreeinmiami** (5): This is the most interesting feature that I honestly did not know existed but they really did Natasha dirty like they only gave her a bit of the chorus huh. It doesn’t even sound fantastic. Like she really has more to offer and that’s all they limited her to? That’s so sad.

**frogaranaman** (5): LMAOOOOOO NATASHA BEDINGFIELD?

**metanoira** (5): natasha what r u DOING

**nooodisaster** (5): It's just such filler like there was no purpose for this song we can move on.

**skargardin** (5): This is such an odd collaboration in hindsight

**Stryxen** (5): hard to form an opinion on

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why is this song the way i find out natasha bedingfield is british

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Natasha Bedingfield?? The Pantene girl???

**CrimsonROSET** (3): what is this combo, it works about as well as you’d expect

**macnbee** (3): this was natasha bedingfield's Last Chance to make a good song again before all my goodwill from Unwritten was eroded

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I feel like that shitty electric guitar in the background is grinding into my brain.

**duochromepalmtree** (2): Jesus Christ this song is bad. Natasha sounds completely off tune.

**cremeebrulee** (1): i literally forget this song exists sdjfhdsjkf

**wavingwolves** (1): this combination sounds bad on paper and also bad in reality who could've thought

**jman457** (7.8): Why do I remember all the words all these years later

**1998tweety** (7.5): Avril outsold

**ignitethephoenix** (7): fuck you know who

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i actually dont hate the vocals in this chorus

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): The Vocals!!! She really has such an underrated voice.

**waluigiest** (7): avril’s influence all over this album

**outsideeyess** (6.8): A+ vocals, D- production. if it weren't for her vocals in the chorus, I would consider giving this a 3.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i feel like the instrumental and the vocals were meant for two different songs but she decided last minute to put the two together

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This album is ultimately a product of its time, some of these beats/production choices ain’t it at all.

**awhile2** (6): i love when the beat finally kicks in but otherwise the song is pretty weak imo

**CrimsonROSET** (6): just let this be a ballad we don’t need the synths, this sounds like a bad EDM remix

**throwaway7650** (6): I overrated this so much initially what the hell (how did I have this as an 8)... it's giving sea shanty remix of sad indie girl song. avril outsold

##Keep it simple

**Awkward\_King** (5): just leave him girl ????

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Very unoriginal comment but I can’t think of anything else: Avril outsold.

**celladonn** (5): This just kind of exists

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this gives me A Star Is Born “generic bad pop song” vibes

**nooodisaster** (5): vocally she's trying but lyrically ohhhh my god. rihanna doesnt even have writing credit like there's no excuse not to hire another writer

**UselessTacooo** (5): it’s okay. I would never choose listening to this song specifically but if it came on I wouldn’t skip it.

**BeauMeringue212** (4): it feels like the vocals and backing track are at war

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): What is this production honey. I’m pretty sure I’ve heard that sound in a video game before

**Stryxen** (3.5): forgot i was listening to this lol

**companion\_star55** (3): i love you rih but i never cared for this

**daythreeinmiami** (3): So by the second chorus I do not like the production of the song and the composition. However Rihanna's vocals are just stellar. She really belts out her heart and I just love her vocals. But this song is for sure a filler song. The fast paced drums in the chorus just don't match up with her belting vocals it just sounds not right. And then when it does the thing in the bridge and it revs up slightly off beat...not for me fam.

**sage** (3): :audience:

**frogaranaman** (1): sorry if this score delays R9 but I hate this lmao

##"Well don't come" is still so iconic

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.2): paging Kendall Jenner

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): well don’t come

**akanewasright** (6): this song has done one good thing for society, with the Rihanna/Kendall Jenner Twitter interaction, and honestly that’s more than most mediocre filler tracks can say

**fadedblue09** (1): Boy where do I start? Let's see: the clunky melody, lazy songwriting, bland production, and then you have Rihanna's emotionless wailing in the chorus....everything about this song just screams HALF-ASSED. (note to Kendall Jenner: gurl get some taste)

**bigbigbee** (6): Nicki's not bad on this but man the sample is horrendous, and it's CONSTANT because it's the ONLY thing in the chorus.

---

##*tyler the creator voice* oh no I hope I don't fall

**2dina3dworld** (10): When someone asks “who was in Paris?” The answer is “Nicki and Beyoncé”

**cremeebrulee** (10): it's still a smash i fear

**jman457** (10): IPR better support this

**wavingwolves** (9.1): this sounds like a cobra starship song omfg

**akanewasright** (9): dumb fun

**Awkward\_King** (9): the mario party 4 minigame where u have to tap a repeatedly and knock down a bunch of dominoes >>>

**duochromepalmtree** (9): underrated tbh. This song is so fun and Nicki has some really fun lines. The bridge is pretty awful but it’s CAMP (and that’s the first and only time I’ve used that word in this rate I promise)

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Thank you for recognizing this as the second best bonus track on this album by including it in this rate

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): Name Drop Queen!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): weird closer but great song

**UselessTacooo** (8): This song is perfect (except this absolutely horrendous chorus). I don’t know if it is a sample or not but it’s definitely bad. If Nicki sang the chorus it would probably be a 10

**1998tweety** (7.5): me boppin to the Canada shoutout

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): , so does one's career.

**awhile2** (7): jr rotem’s production makes me so nostalgic but this is definitely the most dated sounding song on here - and it has quite a bit of competition

**endcreditouilles** (7): heh titties

**frogaranaman** (7): I feel like I've taken shots to this song before

**skargardin** (7): this worked surprisingly well

**teenwitches** (7): i totally forgot the big pink existed until i heard that hook again

**Uberpigeon** (7): she wasnt lying when she said used to be bi now im hetero!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I will never get over “I sign tiddies!”

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): its funny how Nicki’s either worked with or feuded with almost every woman she namechecked in this song by now

**outsideeyess** (6.9): oh god this fucking chorus...

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): heavily sampling a succesful indie hit from the year before in your song is a really bizzare choice, and it feels so out of place and weird in the track

**apatel27** (6): any song with a whoa whoa in the background automatically loses several points

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why include this in the album lmao was it even a hit

**daythreeinmiami** (6): Wait what is happening this isn’t Nicki Minaj. Oh wait here she is. Damn this is Nicki saying she could take your woman and she doesn’t give a fuck. Love that for her.

**TheQueenOfVultures** (6): The closest we'll probably ever get to ranking Big Pink

**waluigiest** (6): I miss her brag tracks from BEFORE she was actually famous

##standing and :audiencing:

**anothertown** (5): used 2b bi but now imjust hetero<33

**throwaway7650** (5): not the sample... maybe I shouldn't have done IPR

**nyoom** (4.5): hey look at that poorly-balanced girl! she got WEAK ANKLES! (NOO that's the thing i'm sensitive abooout)

**astrologicalangel** (4): Nicki's part is great, but the chorus is so oversung it's like it's from a different song

**babadork** (4): The girl power songs make me sad now.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I swear to god this exact synth line was used like 5 times on this album.

**TiltControls** (3.5): this just feels lazy

**macnbee** (3): why does this sound like fuckin…bastille

**nooodisaster** (3): Since I don't care about this song I'm just gonna rank the bonus songs we didn't get to rate: Catch Me > Wave Ya Hand > Blow Ya Mind > Roman's Revenge Remix > Girls Fall Like Dominoes > Muny

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): lmao the mariah carey line. girl you dont even know whats coming

**fadedblue09** (2): Atrocious sample choice. Pharell's Pennsylvania townhall noises outsold

**jsonphile** (2): this is one of the worst hooks I’ve ever heard

**sage** (2): .. no... why was this included 😭

**Stryxen** (2): why did she choose to make it sound like that the verses are so fun but girl...

##listen...American Idol was a rough patch

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Did she say she HIT Mariah Carey???

**seanderlust** (10): Diddy outdone on his own song by two different people on one of his own songs? it's more likely than you think

**bigbigbee** (6.5): Nicki is absolutely the best part of this song. Watch the MV for a masterclass in charisma; she was simply magnetic in front of the camera.

---

##Hello....good morning

**BeauMeringue212** (9): She kinda ate that verse tbh. Also love how Nicki used Dublin as a rhyme in 2 songs lmao

**cremeebrulee** (9): the 2010 ult hosts are so sexy for putting this in the bonus omfg this is genuinely such an underrated nicki verse

**throwaway7650** (9): love the intro/instrumental and nicki's verse

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i had no idea this song existed till now but DAMN wish i knew about it in 2010. nicki really shines here, she rlly was so talented

**waluigiest** (8): I think this was the only song of the rate I didn’t already know… but it felt like I’d heard it before. That classic Nicki verse!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): nice

**daythreeinmiami** (7): So this wasn’t available on my Spotify so I watched the video clip and now I just long to see what being rich and lavish was like in 2010.

**macnbee** (7): now we talking

**frogaranaman** (6): oh god I forgot about this song

##Good night bestie

**jsonphile** (4): I mean if we were gonna do a 2010 rap song with Nicki Minaj and Rick Ross we should’ve done Monster

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): mmm no thanks goodnight

**AHSWeeknd** (3): the 2010s were really something else.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): i hate just about everybody on this song

##now why was this the exact drink I associate with this song

**duochromepalmtree** (9): I completely forgot about this song but i was so obsessed with it when it came out. Omg this makes me want a well whiskey ginger in a plastic cup so bad

**bigbigbee** (7): I miss when k-pop b-sides all sounded like this song

---

##visible

**fadedblue09** (10): A very straightforward R&B song with a distinctively summery flavor

**xavieryes** (10): ta-ta

**TiltControls** (9.5): super underrated imo

**IIIHenryIII** (9): this one is a grower

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): I felt so seen by this song! Like this exact thing happened to me.

**celladonn** (8.5): I like the production on this one, the Enya sample is inspired

**jackisboredtoday** (8): I never played this back in 2010 and treated it as the weak link on the album, but its grown on me a lot more in the last year or so & I’ve kinda fallen into liking it quite a lot by now

**jsonphile** (8): that synth at the end there is really dated but the rest of the song is great

**throwaway7650** (8): cute midtempo ballad, doesn't deserved to be the least-streamed

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this was cute

**duochromepalmtree** (7.5): the lyrics on this song are absolutely awful. Completely juvenile and the lines either dont rhyme or they use the same word. But Rihanna completely elevates the song with her incredible vocals. Especially that BRIDGE. it kills me.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.4): It's...ok. A dip in the rest of the album, not the same highs are before.

**hielord** (7.4): On my first listen and I really love this

**outsideeyess** (7.4): a little cheesy in the production but her vocals sound peng

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Rihanna sounds great here but the production isn’t exactly matching it. There’s better ballads on the album.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): stream faded by alan walker

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i feel sorry for this song being surrounded by such A-Grade bangers

**1998tweety** (6): ok

**AHSWeeknd** (6): this really was the choice to sit in between Cheers and Only Girl 🥴

**daythreeinmiami** (6): This song kinda reminds me of 'Take a Bow'. The production isn't as crisp as the previous songs. But her vocals are beautiful in areas of the song. It's not half bad. It's okay.

**frogaranaman** (6): me every night when I'm falling asleep

**wavingwolves** (6): it's cute

##invisible

**akanewasright** (5.8): This song is perfectly alright, but it’s really, really generic

**jman457** (5.1): sounds like a GGGB reject. Sounds dated even in 2010

**nooodisaster** (5): don't do it.... don't do it...

**plastichaxan** (5): not all albums can be perfect i guess

**sage** (5): fine

**Stryxen** (5): forgot this song as soon as it was over

**waluigiest** (5): her voice is good but the lyrics are so boring

**Awkward\_King** (4): yeah this sure is a ballad by a main pop girl from the years of 2006 to 2011

**macnbee** (4): like the song from my memory

**UselessTacooo** (4): is it just me or is she singing at a different tempo than the production? Either way it’s a non-captivating ballad with questionable drums.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): What a nothing song. I don’t even remember what it sounds like now!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): see its called fading because as soon as youre done listening to it the melody completely fades away in your brain and you cant remember what it sounds like

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this production has aged more poorly than any other song in the rate and its not even catchy or camp. FLOP!

##Yeezy season approacheth

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It’s a little annoying but I don’t want it to seem like I’m sabotaging the album so I’m giving this a ten

**wavingwolves** (10): wow

**thePotatofairyy** (9.5): They both ate! Normally I think Nicki is clearly the best part of any of her collabs but they both did so damn good here I can't tell who I prefer!

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**waluigiest** (9): I honestly forgot about this song. Somehow it’s one of the least referenced bits of this album, but it is still fantastic from start to finish. Kanye’s verse is good, the beat is just glamorous enough, Nicki’s bars and voice are both great. It’s everything Fly wanted to be.

**outsideeyess** (8.7): includes some of her best verses on the album

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is good but not like camp good like this feels actually kinda good

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): this should be like, a 6 but the way she delivers that laugh before “i’m the best now, anybody with some money should invest now” is literally one of my favorite moments in her career

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): good, good, good...

**babadork** (8): This is the only song on this with a featured rapper that doesn't sound like she's holding back.

**celladonn** (8): This is pretty good, Ye's verse is fun

**CrimsonROSET** (8): with so much shit that this album has had so far, sometimes its easy to forget that nicki is just unmatched on bars. Like, if she just kept to it, holy shit. Sadly, she never does.

**daythreeinmiami** (8): girl same I do be blazin. Wait is this sampling ‘Don’t You Forget About Me’ by Simple Minds?

**nooodisaster** (8): problematic royalty rapping for 5 minutes yup

**sage** (8): bop

**throwaway7650** (8): all of the collabs on this album are eating I fear

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8): Only a popheads rate could make me sit through a 5 minute song that feature Kayne West.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): decent but the production is just too chaotic for me

**Iris3271** (7): Not Kanye's best, too long

**nootnoot781** (7): mega what

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I think I like this song? I like Kanye’s part at least

**TiltControls** (6.5): some great stuff from Nicki here, but at this point all the production is starting to blur together for me

**fadedblue09** (6): The first verse started with a bang but it just went downhill from there. Also Kanye's feature was highkey boring

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): i never rlly noticed how bloody long kanye's verse is till now

**vayyiqra** (6): I was hoping Kanye would save this. He didn't.

##Drake fans

**astrologicalangel** (5): meh

**duochromepalmtree** (5): this song is SO DATED. I could hear this in thirty years and still be able to pinpoint exactly when it came out. Such young money era.

**frogaranaman** (5): I'm not smoking weed🌿🍁😴😏🚬I'm smoking💨😜the bible😇😋🙏📕because heaven⬆️😍👐😂is the highest you can get🙌😤

**hikkaru** (5): this is so long and for why

**jman457** (4.6): The mix/sample sounds messy. Like she gave her best songs for Kanye’s album the same day

**akanewasright** (4.5): is this blazin like “getting stoned” or blazin like “on fire”? Because it fails at both

**UselessTacooo** (4.5): it’s just really… flat? It sounds like it wants to do much more but Nicki is just stuck saying “uhm blayyzann”. Kanye’s verse was fun though

**anothertown** (4): the Don't You Forget About Me sample is so strange. lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Nicki’s verse on this is pretty great but I don’t really need the rest of the song, especially the last minute or so.

**macnbee** (4): so rude that nicki MADE monster but kanye can't summon enough energy to make his feature memorable

**xavieryes** (3): overall uninteresting, including the Kanye verse which just feels like nothing. it gets more boring every second. the anti-Monster.

**shhhneak** (1): idk felt like sabotaging this.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): why do the vocals sound like theyre a half a step out of time with the music

**IIIHenryIII** (0): two awful people in an awful song

**bigbigbee** (8): This music video is really so creative - I love the use of fabric to represent multiple settings (the way it’s used to create water and blood are really great).

**seanderlust** (4.5): hyperpop (derogatory)

---

##The Illest

**grey/0x976** (10): slayyyy

**nooodisaster** (10): I love this one. The simple, airy production flowing around Nicki's smooth yet firm delivery is like a warm blanket. The love she describes here I can honestly say is beautiful. It's timeless in that it spans eras, yet is so specific in its cartoonish references of past lives and pop culture. It's an endless cycle of finding each other, an idea so innocent and grand at the same time, never taken too seriously.

**nyoom** (10): nicki's knowledge of asia seems pretty spotty but SOMEONE involved in this mv has watched enough c-dramas to know the tropes, and honestly? when non-asians see asian aesthetics and go, THAT'S SO COOL, I WANT THAT, it gives me warm fuzzies because YEAH IT IS, ISN'T IT?

**waluigiest** (10): I was gonna gush about the music video but I took my nostalgia glasses off and realized it was just pretty appropriative

**wavingwolves** (10): oh this sample!!!! bitch!!!! it's great

**sage** (9.8): this instrumental is so good

**duochromepalmtree** (9): the sound mixing on this song is god awful but I just love it. So sweet and fun and absolutely ridiculous but in the best way

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): this uses the annie lennox sample very well

**teenwitches** (8.5): i had to explain to my then-10-year-old sister who bruce willis was because of this song

**thePotatofairyy** (8.5): I had no idea this song was so good??? I remember dismissing it back in the day but damn it's fun

**emayzee** (8.4): i can't hear this without thinking of the tom holland memes anymore

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): cool.

**apatel27** (8): Showing good variety. Good use of samples, raps and singing

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I used to think this was really boring but I actually like it more now then when it released

**jman457** (8): knocked down a couple points for weird asian representation

**outsideeyess** (8): great sample

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this slaps

**throwaway7650** (8): idk if this makes sense but this song makes me feel :soblove:

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): bring bruce willis references back in pop music

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): the Annie Lennox sample hits

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): the beat is so immaculate

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): i can't dissassociate this from the "nicki working at mcdonald's" clip

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): the samples carries I fear, the song is just alright

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute but i was never a huge fan

**anothertown** (7): yur like a candy store and i'm a toddlore <33

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the beat gives such a feel good vibe

**jsonphile** (7): weird cultural appropriation but okay far from the worst thing Nicki has done

**Stryxen** (7): cute little bop

**TiltControls** (7): annie lennox rate when

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Everybody go stream I Love You's by Hailee Steinfeld!

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): this sample lmao

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): i want a funny comment about the samurai speaking thai but i feel like the clever things about that cultural mishmash were picked clean so i’m just gonna draw attention to it

**akanewasright** (6): One of my friends made a viral TikTok saying he thought the beat/a cappella stuff at the beginning was from a glee cover instead of a real song and that… removed a point or two for me

**CrimsonROSET** (6): die hard like bruce willis

##L-O-V-E-L-E-S-S....generation

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this sounds like a song for an ad for Justice

**frogaranaman** (5): beat is iconic but the rest of the track is just fine

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): One day I’d actually like to learn Thai… seems hard as hell but I think it would be cool to know… oh also what is this song

**fadedblue09** (4.5): She was right to disown this song

**Awkward\_King** (4): this sample is cute

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): “Your Love (x700)”

**macnbee** (4): the sample on this is so funny for no reason

**hikkaru** (3): this is so boring why was she so obsessed with these pop rap ballads on this album

**UselessTacooo** (3): I don’t like the way she is basically just talking. Aside from that it’s okay, but not spectacular or anything of the sorts

**celladonn** (2.5): I hate that I immediately recognised this sample but I recognised it from. Neil Cicierega's Annoyed Grunt rather than the Annie Lennox song where it actually originated

**daythreeinmiami** (2): I love her delivery and the song is mixed nicely I just don’t like it all together you know? Like this song has never done it for me so I ain’t gonna pretend it’s doing something for me now. Mostly it’s because I hate that sample. I can’t remember where it originally is from but I hate that song.

**metanoira** (2): minus 5 for that geisha line

**AHSWeeknd** (1): I’m glad TikTok turned this into an egregious sound because this sucks

**SideBTrack8** (0): it probably doesn't help that i don't have any nostalgia for most of the album but i just really never want to hear this again

**bigbigbee** (8): AN O-L D-M A-N, YOU ARE AN OLD MAN - me to the one neutered boar in my herd of guinea pigs (aspirational)

**ReallyCreative** (4): A song with a very tumultuous run, going from the bottom of day 1 to briefly reaching day 2, just to get batted back down again. It's not very good, but I'm sure its elimination will upset some people.

**seanderlust** (2): there's just a little too much going on here. the production feels like when you make a powerpoint and use every slide transition there is.

---

##Land Before Time fans

**2dina3dworld** (10): me to anyone on the server who’s over 20: “you’re a dinosaur”

**awhile2** (10): - most underrated song in the rate. If this goes out on day 1 i wlil riot

**Awkward\_King** (10): tell me why this was one of the songs i was obsessed with as like an 8 year old

**daythreeinmiami** (10): You are a dinosaur if you think this song is lame. Literally time has made this song so much better.

**grey/0x976** (10): D-I-N-O-S-A-U-R A DINOSAUR! AND O-L-D M-A-N YOURE JUST AN OLD MAN! HITTIN ON ME WHAAAAT ?! YOU NEED A CAT SCAN!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the funniest and most clever song ever made

**moooo566** (10): iconic

**nooodisaster** (10): Ironically and unironically a 10. .** could never produce something this fun and anti-creeper so ** had to give it to Max Martin. When I say this is a feminist anthem I am not joking around.

**nootnoot781** (10): C A M P

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Lanas's daddies found fossilized

**TheQueenOfVultures** (10): I can't make it not bop sorry

**throwaway7650** (10): ~~DINOS~~AUR THIS IS ~~DINO~~SAUR GOOD. CAT SCAN.

**outsideeyess** (9.4): Ke$ha's spelling gives Fergie a run for her money

**anothertown** (9): me talking to my grandchildren voice) and then in 2010, when max martin made a track with kesha that sounded like alphabeat meets the b-52s

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is the best kero kero bonito song we’ve ever rated, also ‘DINOSA you are’ is genius

**plastichaxan** (9): this song made me stop looking for old men on certain… sites

**teenwitches** (9): lots of "rawr XD" energy here

**waluigiest** (9): okay but all of the background vocals on this song are amazing!! Plus the roars and whistles, it’s really a sonic experience

**hikkaru** (8.5): her pen omfg.... she was insane for this one

**jman457** (8.5): my freshman year jam

**nyoom** (8.5): who was spitting like ke$ha

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I'm dumbfounded that a mainstream pop star would be ballsy enough to put a song this stupid (and great) on their debut album in 2010

**xavieryes** (8.5): paleontologist queen

**endcreditouilles** (8.4): kesha please finish the word i still don't know how to spell dinosa

**wavingwolves** (8.3): and FUCK old men that hit on extremely young women

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): this is an absolute mess but… im kinda vibing?

**akanewasright** (8): this is dumb as hell and too clever at the same time... and yet it works

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): It’s not a masterpiece but god there are so many creeps out there who need to hear this.

**cherryices** (8): if somebody wrote this song about me i really would just fossilise out of shame

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I will not mention the G word, I will not mention the G word

**sage** (8): camp

**skargardin** (8): this is by all accounts objectively bad but god it's entertaining

**vayyiqra** (8): This is like Toni Basil's "Mickey" but from hell. Ageism is bad, but then hitting on much younger women who don't want it is also bad. So who can say if "Dinosaur" is good or bad? Eh nvm it's pretty good.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): LOL

**babadork** (7): I don't even know why I like this so much.

**duochromepalmtree** (7): my instinct is to give this a low score because it’s an awful song. But any song that makes fun of creepy old guys trying to hit on young women deserves at least an seven from me! It’s funny to think that when I was 17 I sung this song thinking about 30 year old men at the clubs lol

**thePotatofairyy** (7): Look. I love daddies but this song is so damn stupid it's fun

**TiltControls** (7): :camp:

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I, uh, applaud the originality of the concept

**apatel27** (6.5): is it camp or is it just meh

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this deserves the “it’s camp” comments peacock will get, though I still don’t love it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): probably the catchiest song about getting catcalled

**imasalesman** (6): ended old people

**joeeswift** (6): very camp.

**Uberpigeon** (6): me when i see /u/vayyiqra 👴🤪

##Fossilized

**Stryxen** (5.9): it needed to be said it was on everyone’s minds

**BeauMeringue212** (5.6): Me when I message guys 2 years younger than me on Grindr

**1998tweety** (5): i cant decide if this is good or not

**hielord** (5): ageism

**TheQwertyGuy99** (5): No. Is this a parody song. Even Max Martin couldn't save this one.

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (5): There have been very, very few songs where I've wanted to skip half way through... this is definitely one of them.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): it sounds trashy but I'm more bored than irritated honestly

**ImADudeDuh** (3): oh this is bad outside of the “D I N O S A U R” moment

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): no thnx

**macnbee** (2): so intrusively bad holy fuck

**AHSWeeknd** (1): Ross Gellers favourite song

**frogaranaman** (1): change some of the lyrics and this would be on the new Teletubbies album

**jsonphile** (1): I can’t stand this I’m sorry I try to enjoy dumb fun Kesha but this pushes my limit

**metanoira** (1): no to daddy rights

**UselessTacooo** (1): this song can disappear. It sounds like it was made on GarageBand in an hour.

**seanderlust** (7.5): shoutout to whatever man is yelling in the background of the chorus

**bigbigbee** (7): I can't make "shitted on em" not funny

---

##you know I had to do it to em

**awhile2** (10): so many iconic lines in one song i couldnt even choose one to put in this comment

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is still so funny idgaf nicki is at her best when she's completely unhinged

**grey/0x976** (10): this instant classic

**jman457** (10): 13 year old me at this shit up, goes so hard

**macnbee** (10): IF I HAD A DICK I WOULD PULL IT OUT AND PISS ON EM….literally started fifth wave feminism

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): god this song goes hard

**throwaway7650** (10): papa bear sweetie I'm so sorry about your mom and dad

**waluigiest** (10): after listening to this for over a decade I just learned the lyric is “I don’t know what layaway look like” … NOT “I don’t know what Lil Wayne look like”

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I can’t believe a song about shitting on haters, literally, has some of the best lines and best production on the album

**wavingwolves** (9.1): too many lines here are worth highlighting so i'll just throw a yasss and move on

**daythreeinmiami** (9): When Nicki did it good she fucking did well. Like imagine making a song about defecating this good. Only Nicki really could honestly.

**nooodisaster** (9): This song is soooo funny (intentionally). Safaree's ad-libs still are the highlight. When he talks about Just For Me Perm? Legendaric behavior.

**sage** (8.5): oh she ate...

**shhhneak** (8.5): Me imagining a KIDZ BOP version of this.

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**duochromepalmtree** (8): I really love the production choices made on this song. Lots of interesting sounds.

**UselessTacooo** (8): once you notice the erratic cowbell in the background you will never be the same

**hikkaru** (7.5): shidded on em is iconic ofc

**nootnoot781** (7.5): but like why would you make a song about having a scat fetish????

**TiltControls** (7.5): it's giving cher

**outsideeyess** (7.4): remember when stuttering used to be Nicki's signature? the guy talking in the back is kinda funny

**frogaranaman** (7): 💩

**ignitethephoenix** (7): “couples of wet wipes in case a bum try to touch me” and “you used to be here, gone Nair” ; these lines send me

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (7): Nicki, hate to break it to you, but this wasn't the serve you thought it was.

**akanewasright** (6.9): This album is pretty piss friendly so far… good for Nicki?

**nyoom** (6.5): man i wish i had a dick so i could pee it sounds sick

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): great beat but i don't think nicki was the best fit for it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): the impact i felt the one time i heard the explicit version of this at age 12 before i went back to the clean for the next 5 years

**anothertown** (6): bitch i can't even spell welfare . . .

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): S H I D D E D O N E M

##"Dee Dee...Megadoodoo..."

**2dina3dworld** (4): she has to be saying “shitting on em”. It’s not even subtle, she’s talking about number twos and all.

**hielord** (4): at least the transition from the previous song is nice

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I found this beat so annoying on first listen that I gave this my 0, but now it kinda slaps

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): It’s probably objectively the worst song in this rate but at least I laughed.

**CrimsonROSET** (3): haha all these bitches is my sons so funny lets ignore all the comments on body excrements please

**Awkward\_King** (2): this could be a better song!! it isnt but it could be!

**AHSWeeknd** (1): These lyrics 💀 I’m sorry but one of the only good beats on the album had to be ruined with these messy ass lyrics

**BeauMeringue212** (1): I just... can't with somebody rapping about piss and shit

**fadedblue09** (1): I feel like being shitted on listening to this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): me when nicki said bitches is my sons at the beginning https://uploads.dailydot.com/2020/04/leo-pointing.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&ixlib=php-3.3.0

**vayyiqra** (1): We did not need these mental images. This would be an easy 0 if not for the song before it, which is gross on more levels.

**xavieryes** (1): yeah this song is shit

Saison_Marguerite: maybe Susan Boyle should’ve been in this rate instead of Pink Friday

bigbigbee: Hi IIIHenryIII! 

Oh my god. I did miss your ballot. I am SO sorry! This is completely my fault.

As an explanation: I had reddit set up to send me an email every time I received a ballot so I could track them. But the email for your ballot for some reason went to my "promotions" folder in Gmail, which I always delete because everything else in that folder is an advertisement.

We've incorporated your ballot for Day 2 and Day 3 and will discuss how to fix this Day 1 post soon. Thankfully, your ballot did not change which songs made which days!

My sincerest apologies again, and sorry to /u/seanderlust and /u/ReallyCreative also who have to do more work because of me.

IIIHenryIII: Hi!!!

It's totally fine! No need to apologise. These things happen. It was just a surprise not seeing my scores, but it was really not a big deal. Sorry if my comment sounded like a complain. That was truly not my intention. 

Now I apologise for giving you all more work. You really didn't have to incorporate my scores. I've never hosted one of these rates, and I cannot even imagine the amount of work you all had to put in this awesome rate, specially after this. Hearing that my ballot didn't change which songs made which days is such a relief though.

Anyway, now that I have apologized, I should say thank you for doing this. I really appreciate how caring and committed you three are. I'll make sure to join the beatsense room today to show my support. Sorry once again and thanks!
