The Redemption Rate - Reveal
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/

HELLO and WELCOME to the first and only day of the Redemption Rate reveal!!

To recap, in celebration of the subreddit's 5th birthday, we rated 30 of the most robbed songs from across rate history, all chosen by public vote. It all culminates in an extremely chaotic reveal today that begins at **2PM EST.**

Before we begin, please enjoy these stats:

* [131](https://pastebin.com/R4jUncnW) people sent in scores. My aggressive promotion paid off!

* The average score was a **7.620.** I think this is lower than most people expected!

* The average controversy score was a **2.298.** I didn't bother to check where it ranks but this is much higher than usual!

* Only **one** song did not receive at least one 11. Any guesses?

Please join us for the reveal in our [plug.dj room!](https://plug.dj/popheads) We will be moving at a quick pace with minimal shitposting to accomodate for our one day reveal.

RandomHypnotica: > Only one song did not receive at least one 11. Any guesses?

I'm going to guess Lovefool, it's the only song on here I can't see anyone being a diehard fan of enough to give their 11 to it over EVERYTHING else

bulforster: Manifesting Lovefool winning with no 11s

TiltControls: Similarly I can see Cyndi pulling an ABBA-like run and making final 5/10 just based on appreciation, but with no 11's
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4ctfo2/]

=====

ReallyCreative: that still remains the wildest thing to happen in a rate to me outside like Slumber Party

no 11s but a like 9 average or something wild

and Dancing Queen was a song everyone liked but realistically only gave that high a mark because they were afraid it wouldn't be appreciated EVERYONE walked away from that rate upset lmao

=====

pat-rickstar: What does the "controversy score" thing mean? I've done a few of these now and I still dont really get it. 

Freedom for the win ✨
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4cug8c/]

=====

ReallyCreative: it's like the standard deviation I think (it might be the standard dev lmao)

basically you know how if a song has rates of 4, 6, and 8, it has an average of 6? a song with rates of 2, 6, and 10 also has an average of 6, but the standard deviation (controversy) is higher

I could be deadass wrong though I didn't go to school for math
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4cusn4/]

=====

pat-rickstar: Ohhhh ty, that makes sense!
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4cvz2b/]

=====

bigbigbee: You're right and this is a fantastic ELI5 explanation!

You can think of the controversy score (standard deviation) as being the amount that the majority\* of scores differ from the average. 

So if the controversy score (SD) is 1.2, and the average score of the song is 6, then the majority of scores were between:

4.8 ----- 6 ------ 7.2

whereas if the controversy score was 3.1, then the scores are way more spread out, and the majority\* of scores were between: 

2.9 ---------------------- 6 ---------------------- 9.1

(\*^(majority = 68% of scores. By definition, 68% of scores fall within one standard deviation of the average, assuming a normal distribution, blah blah stats blah))
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4cw0fz/]

=====

bulforster: I think it's just the standard deviation which measures how spread out the scores are
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4cutmg/]

=====

pat-rickstar: Thanks, I studied statistics actually so I should probably have worked that out lmao
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4cw6f0/]

=====

rickikardashian: I know my 11 will be done wrong, I know it, but I had to give it my appreciation

This has grown on me quite a bit over the years, just as it's grown into icon status within the hip hop canon. One of the first songs to mark the moody trap phenomenon that has dominated the charts since 2017, I'm glad Popheads is able to recognize its genius enough to vote it in despite not being by a white pop girl. This actually wasn't last place until the last flood of submissions but it ended up being behind 29th by over 30 points, just as pretty much everyone predicted.

---

**awhile2** (11): smells like teen spirit is this generation's XO TOur Llif3

**frogaranaman** (11): this song is goated goodbye to anyone that doesn't like it

**steelstepladder** (11): People are going to do this song so dirty I can feel it in my bones

**bespectacIed** (10): So glad this got in, this is the most influential song of all time (lol maybe not OAT, just of the entire music industry since 2017). I think my tolerance for emo-trap/pop starts and stops with uzi

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): I don't like anything else by Lil Uzi Vert, yet this song is one of the best ones I've ever heard. The production, the lyrics, the flow, it all comes together to form a striking and interesting song.

**RosaPalms** (10): I can tell it’s a masterpiece but (because?) it defies explanation. Just looking at every part of it individually, it’s unassuming, but all together it’s just kind of jaw-dropping. It has the sweeping, epic feel of “SICKO MODE” or “Bohemian Rhapsody” but it’s a tight three minutes, like how???

**selegend** (10): one of the best hits of recent times

**wavingwolves** (10): not afraid to die gang

**Stryxen** (9.4): this song was literally everywhere… very much appreciate that it’s so good

**RVA\_101** (9.2): Out of all the emo rap songs, this one is probably the definitive, best one. It still amuses me how much 'push me to the edge, all my friends are dead' pops into my head.

**fadedblue09** (9): Billie's Xanny found quaking.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): minecraft is shaking

**worlds-okayest666** (9): i have many problems with uzi (see: his weird transphobic lyrics), but i still really love this. it just slaps, what can i say!

**ReallyCreative** (8.9): it's a rap song by a black man so it will probably go out immediately but it's really good

**camerinian** (8.5): Uzi will never top Money Longer but like if this is what the kids now are nostalgic for in the future then I fully respect that

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I'm far from a lil uzi fan but this song is sooooo good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): can't believe i let ya'll talk me into not listening to this song bc "generic mumble rap" bc it slaps (even tho the lyrics are on the depressing side - After Laughter vibes)

**bigbigbee** (8): Great instrumental, but his vocal quality on the higher notes grates on me a bit

**Sundraliz** (8): My mom would tell Mr. Vert to enunciate more

**CrimsonROSET** (7.6): I'm just happy we could get a more than one rap male act in this rate.

**bbfan132** (7.5): a pretty good track!

**Hielord** (7): It brings back memories

**purplechilipepper** (7): I love the production on this but it isn't really my thing

**SmileAndTears** (7): This is quite decent

**twat\_brained** (7): I generally kinda dig this song

**vayyiqra** (7): Never heard this before but dark trap bangers >>>

**wasian-invasion** (7): Idk why I had an irrational dislike of this song in 2017 but the chorus is v catchy

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): I know a lot of people like this track a lot but… I just can't get into it. Uzi's voice is grating, the track sounds pretty samey throughout, and it just never hooked me

**1998tweety** (6): this is alright but he tries to do a bit too much at some points

**ManofOranges** (6): I don't really see what ya'll see in this I'm sorry.

**skargardin** (6): i totally get this song's appeal but at the same time i find it insanely overhyped, I've tried to get it to click several times but it just hasn't and neither has any of his other music sadly

**seanderlust** (5.3): Idk man this one just feels kind of basic in terms of production. The lyrics are pretty good.

**InternetDude19** (4): What's that noise in the background?

**CritneySpearz** (3): just don’t like the nasally voice T_T

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i've never liked this tbh.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (2): I… just don't see the appeal

**nightjesus** (2): that clicking sound is so irritating. Also I have no idea what he is saying. God mumble rap is just not my thing.

**team\_kockroach** (2): Catchy chorus, bad verses. People say it makes you “feel something”, but I don’t hear it. Also XXXTentacion ripped this off to make SAD!, and that’s even worse.

**gannade** (1): :pensive:

**Jackalope117** (0): wtf even is this

**lapascalia** (0): I just really don’t like the sound of his voice sorry…

**mudkip1** (0): sorry kappyko

I was very surprised by how successful the campaign for votes for this song was, as it ended up placing in the top 5 most voted songs for this rate. This was definitely a left-field move for Bridgit coming out of her Disney days, and her lack of music since the *Nemesis* EP has grown a cult following surrounding her. I'm not the biggest fan of it but it's certainly more remembered than some other EPs from the 2016 EP rate (does anyone remember Kiiara outside of "Gold"?)

---

**agentofscranton** (11): what kinda drug was i on not giving this the 11 it so deserves in the original 2016 ep rate - also it's like leagues better than literally every song that placed above it what kinda drugs were we on as a sub tbh

**akanewasright** (11): Holy fuck. I can’t believe I hadn’t heard this before. This is gorgeous and wonderful and wow shit I love it.

**carolcrossing** (11): cause this song deserves more love

**ManofOranges** (11): For the longest time this was my most streamed song on Spotify, and I think it's because when I first created my Spotify I pretty much only listened to Bridgit's Nemesis EP for like two weeks. And there's a reason for that--it's amazing. I love this song so damn much. Bridgit honey please release more music.

**mudkip1** (11): period

**1998tweety** (10): queen snapped here, this EP is immaculate

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WINNER ARRIVED

**nightjesus** (10): This is the best song Bridgit has ever released.

**selegend** (10): one of the best choruses ever

**teenage\_meme** (10): this gets a 10 for the vocal effects alone

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): it's guess it's ok if this song gets robbed she's already a successful Harvard/MIT scholar

**WiiFightTrainer** (10): Why hasn't she made new music

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): This song had e v e r y t h i n g needed to be a hit. I remember stumbling upon this in 2016 because I was searching for her X-Factor performance (lmaoooo) and then I saw this video and was instantly hooked from the moment it started. The entire EP was so "in" but ahead of its time. 2017-2019 had this sound. Lo-fi, moody, atmospheric, whatever the hell, her sound was so perfect for the time and every paid dust to her.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): ngl, my expectations for this song were kinda low thinking this was just popheads hyping up some Disney Star's pop output with rose-tinted glasses, but it's actually surprisingly solid and moody. Although the Kaiydo verse can go

**cremeebrulee** (9): this was whatever to me on a first listen but i googled the lyrics and that chorus is fucking stunning wow

**lapascalia** (9): This is so smooth

**worlds-okayest666** (9): this is just so calm and pretty, i love it. Bridgit please come home, we miss you...

**rickikardashian** (8.5): the amount of song bridgit had available for this rate was shockingly high, and they all deserved to be here

**camerinian** (8): I reckon this song is more interesting than it is, like, good, but I'm enough of a wanker that that does it for me anyways

**gannade** (8): do i like this song? hmm. but i want to support mudkip.

**skargardin** (8): this song is still so fresh and cool sounding, ughh love it

**twat\_brained** (7.6): anyone think Kaiydo sounds like Khalid? I wonder what he's up to these days

**InternetDude19** (7.5): I wish she made more music.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): This is good. I think.

**TiltControls** (7.5): 🐟🐟🐟 I haven't listened to this in a while, but I forgot how much I enjoyed it. Chorus is gorgeous. I don't know how well the guest rap verse fits here though.

**Stryxen** (7.3): every time it goes at-lan-tis it feels good on my brain. the rest is eh

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): I don't hate this, but it just does not hold up to most of the other tracks on this rate.

**bigbigbee** (7): Ugh, such a mixed bag. I LOVE the first 50 seconds or so, but I really dislike the instrumental part of the chorus, especially its first iteration.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): this is really cute!

**purplechilipepper** (7): such pretty synths and such pretty vibes

**RosaPalms** (7): this is quite good, I’m hearing for the first time but I love the beat and the vocal effects. there wasn’t anything wrong with the rap verse necessarily but it felt very different from the rest

**vayyiqra** (7): Never heard this song before but it's really good. It's like "Hide and Seek [Chill Lo-Fi Mix]" if you follow.

**WaffleWhales** (7): Ready or Not remains superior

**RVA\_101** (6.8): The Imogen Heap style vox effects caught me by surprise. I lowkey enjoyed this a lot. Kaiydo's verse is alright, not one of the better juxtapositions of a rap verse in a pop song but still not too contrived and still passable.

**fadedblue09** (6.7): Kinda hideous-sounding, but there are certain elements I like.

**bbfan132** (6): this is decent but i really don’t get the love for this, it sounds like a bland pop track from 2016

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): i appreciate Bridget trying to do something different for this, but it misses the mark for me. i forgot how popular this sound was in 2016

**wavingwolves** (6): it's okay but it does pales in comparison with other songs in this rate

**ignitethephoenix** (5): I appreciate the effects they tried out and lyrics but this isn’t that good especially compared to all the other songs here

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): the rap verse is...not cute. the rest of the song is even less so. justice for snap my fingers.

**steelstepladder** (5): This is actually my first time hearing this... I don't get it

**seanderlust** (4.7): is this one of those Tick Tock songs?

**CrimsonROSET** (4): ca·coph·o·ny /kəˈkäfənē/ noun, a harsh discordant mixture of sounds.

**CarlieScion** (3): who

**Hielord** (3): Underwhelming, it sounds so generic.

**cocosairdep** (2): *Fast asleep with the fishes*. Relatable.

**awhile2** (1): the only time ive heard this song before was when i did the original rate it was in like 3 years ago and i still remember it because of how bad it is

**joeeswift** (1): i seen this being really hyped up in the past, disappointed

**SweatpantsLesbian** (0): I had never heard this song before and wish that was still so

**wasian-invasion** (0): Idk nothing about this song works. The clunky lyrics spoken so dramatically, the vocoder, the drowsy pop drop, the rap verse, Bridgit rapping a line, and is she implying the mob tied cinder blocks to love and tossed it in the river?

This song is from the infamous Disney/Nick stars singles rate and after many years I finally see the appeal of it: it's basically a self-titled era Britney song except performed by Ashley Tisdale at the peak of her High School Musical fame. Unfortunately, she was not taken seriously by the participants of this rate and even held the bottom spot briefly.

---

**gannade** (11): jessica alba fantastic. makes me wanna shake my ASSet

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**agentofscranton** (10): we as a society failed ashley tisdale by not making this a number one smash internationally

**anothertown** (10): One of the most underrated masterpieces… No thoughts, head full of mania and 5 Hour Energy

**awhile2** (10): [disapointed my ashley tisdale beat never blew up](https://soundcloud.com/awhile2/ashley-tisdale)

**cashewconstellation** (10): BOOOOOP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): legendary bop

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is literally so sleazy and I mean that in the best way possible. Ashley Tisdale's Disney music career always seemed to be in a really weird position, but damn if she didn't have some hits.

**plastichaxan** (10): the way this shook me to the core when it released... it still holds so much power

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): Miss Tisdale really said y'all can eat this ass because I am not a Disney girl no more and served! we stan a sis finna slay a bop! She gave us Dracula with that organ, PCD with that vocal, and XTina with the dirrrty lyrics.

**selegend** (10): that intro is one of the best moments in music. like mozart couldn’t do that

**Stryxen** (10): this is for ashley tisdale only, i don’t really like this song

**teenage\_meme** (10): MY QUEEN

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): the rightful winner of this rate

**worlds-okayest666** (10): slaps much, MUCH harder than it should. this would be deservingly praised by critics and popheads alike if a more “respectable” pop artist released it. (although maybe it is praised already? idk i dont really keep up with that stuff much lmao)

**brendjac** (9): The only thing “he” better be saying is that this song is a bop.

**lapascalia** (9): This is still a banger

**nightjesus** (9): Okay can we just all agree that Headstrong was a banger of an album.

**Tolk1en** (9): amazing intro and bridges + many nice characteristic sounds of the 2000's. Biggest bop of this rate

**WaffleWhales** (9): Gabriellla Montez has been real quiet since this dropped

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I’m not really into Disney ex-acts as the rest of the sub, but I didn’t feel like I wasted my time either, so I guess she’s good.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Trashy 2000s greatness from the boldest fashion icon of the time

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): one of ashley's best songs

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): A missed opportunity when all the simpletons were too preoccupied with Vanessa and Say Ok.

**twat\_brained** (8.4): I act like this song wasn't all that great but hey what do I know I stan Slayyyter ¯_( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)_/¯

**bigbigbee** (8): I love Castlevania

**RosaPalms** (8): I was just old enough at the time to feel above High School Musical but this song goes off. Got that Middle East swagger jack that Timbaland was doing like four years before.

**team\_kockroach** (8): It’s a total ripoff, but god I’m a sucker for the instrumental claps. I love the intro so much.

**wavingwolves** (8): i still don't understand what she'd singing but yes!!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this song is so all over the place (goes from pop to Halloween ?) but it does bop.

**bbfan132** (7): fun but not much else to it

**hunnybee12** (7): it sounds… cheap

**jasannn** (7): so 2000's but she pulls off the song well.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): dated but so high energy

**skargardin** (7): hoe anthem

**vayyiqra** (7): This is dumb but fun and it's so aggressively 2000s pop; I love it.

**akanewasright** (6): This song following up the Céline song was... jarring to say the least. It slaps though.

**CritneySpearz** (6): uhh.. I think I need a few more listens

**Hielord** (6): Go through Sharpay

**InternetDude19** (6): It's better than I expected.

**CrimsonROSET** (5.7): I love her voice singing, I hate her voice rapping.

**RVA\_101** (5.6): The instrumental is strangely hypnotic. But it also seems like a dollar store Promiscuous. This must have been incredibly risque at the middle school dances.

**astrologicalangel** (4): do I not get this? Am I missing a joke?

**lightningcrying** (4): not even nostalgia could save this one

**TiltControls** (4): It's a fine song, but given the state of the competition it's very much outmatched.

**wasian-invasion** (3): Idk why the fact that this was released before Phineas and Ferb is so funny. Like she tried for the typical Disney star breakout then said fuck it and went back to kids shows. Smart move

**SmileAndTears** (2.5): What in the Britney Spears reject is this? This late 2000s production style just isn't my cup of tea

**bespectacIed** (2): thank god I didn't have a disney channel childhood. I don't have to overhype dated sounding, moderate hits from ex-acts that are just soulless rehashes of early 00s pop/rnb

**vintagebathingsuit** (2): wow this gave me a headache

**cocosairdep** (0): This is so awful. The lyrics are generic and the production sounds cheap, I’m sorry but it aged like milk. I love Ashley, but this isn’t it. ~~Pls don’t come at me I’m scared.~~

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I like some ideas from this song, but the production sounds really harsh and abrasive for no reason, Ashley's singing is kinda off, there's like 2 sections repeated ad nauseum through the whole song, and it's just super basic.

**seanderlust** (0): These lyrics are my drunk friend telling me an incomprehensible story while we are in line for hot dogs.

**steelstepladder** (0): We could have had Ray of Light

One of my favorite side arcs of 2020 has been the renaissance of the Barbz a.k.a. Nicki Minaj stans via TikTok, and I like to think it began with the surprise resurgence of this avant-garde banger as a meme on the app last year. I'm not sure this is a song I could listen on repeat nowadays (it reminds me too much of my middle school days) but it's much more interesting than pretty much any material Nicki has put out since 2014 in my opinion.
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4cy2lr/]

=====

TragicKingdom1: **nootnoot781** (11): this song is fucking art.

**Sundraliz** (11): Barbz learned it from Roman. Maybe they need a Barbz Holiday.

**wasian-invasion** (11): I'm no barb but I had to. This song is like pure chaotic energy and exactly what I need for 2020. Also the sped-up meme version activates some primal fight or flight response in me

**1998tweety** (10): massively iconic, Nicki's impact on pop culture is severely understated

**agentofscranton** (10): forgot about the 2012 rate for a sec and thought this had lost the meme rate to the mii channel theme and just didn't think anything about that

**anothertown** (10): I love the Wikipedia page for this song

**Awkward\_King** (10): the best nicki song.

**bespectacIed** (10): Try to look past the meme status and see how masterfully made this camp hit is. Onika truly the most entertaining pop star of our times outside and inside her music

**cashewconstellation** (10): Someone called this the Bohemian Rhapsody of rap and yeah

**cremeebrulee** (10): tik tok smash hit

**joeeswift** (10): I used to listen to this as a joke and now I’m obsessed

**ManofOranges** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SFDJQpf73DA&t=56s

**plastichaxan** (10): look I hadn't listened to this outside of the meme and I wasn't expecting this to be the best Nicki Minaj song I've ever listened to, even better than stupid hoe

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this is such an experience ugh

**selegend** (10): beez in the trap is better but this will do

**skargardin** (10): iconic in all its messiness, its so insanely theatrical

**twat\_brained** (10): my sleeper Barb cell has awoken from its dormancy

**WaffleWhales** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZkC_zO9l9cY

**worlds-okayest666** (10): idc this is great even without the meme

**CrimsonROSET** (9.8): Everyone, please rise to the national anthem.

**Stryxen** (9.8): theres so much going on that nothing works at all, very much 2012 vibes. love it though

**SweatpantsLesbian** (9.5): I miss when Nicki was weird in a good way

**bbfan132** (9): the execution is a bit rough at points but i absolutely love the concept of this

**bigbigbee** (9): This song is like, really addictive but also I can’t say I always ENJOY listening to it? Does that make sense? In any case, I really admire this song for just existing in its weird glory

**hikkaru** (9): this classic..

**rickikardashian** (9): @tk you better have a good 10 minutes of sped up memes queued up for this reveal or else we’re catching hands

**SmileAndTears** (9): This is fucking hilarious

**yourfacesucksass** (9): Okay SO when the synthy dance melody comes in later on in the song I SWEAR it sounds like a ringtone I had on my Motorola Razr back in 2006 LMAO. That just solidifies the memefication of this song.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): How did she fit so many iconic, meme-worthy bars into 4 minutes? I'm not really a barb but this song is so chaotic I have to respect it

**akanewasright** (8): This song is a glorious mess. I miss the period where Nicki had this much chaotic energy (and used it in her work)

**jasannn** (8): a tiktok legend

**lapascalia** (8): This song is nuts… but maybe kind of genius too?

**teenage\_meme** (8): this was my first time hearing this, and as someone who really can't stand nicki anymore, i quite liked it! this might be an unpopular opinion, but i like her accents lmao

**Hielord** (7.8): I had only heard the meme part of the song, and now when hearing the full song I'm honestly surprised, because it's not bad at all lmao

**bulforster** (7): Part of me thinks this is an unmitigated disaster while another thinks it's an iconic masterpiece so I have no idea what to score this.

**J\_Toe** (7): oop, I didn't know this was on the list. Have been trying to not stream her music after twice collaborating with he who shall not be named

**nowqueenofpop** (7): [every edit w/ the second verse is blasted directly into my brain by a stan twitter operated laser]

**Tolk1en** (7): 7 points for the memes

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): OK so, I love the verses, iconic memes and all, but the chorus is just way too grating, even for Nicki

**RVA\_101** (6.6): Her manic delivery here that defined early Nicki Minaj work is either highly amusing or highly annoying depending on who you ask. I'm right in the middle ever so slightly leaning to the left. The slightly off key 'Come All Ye Faithful' is jarring but probably intentional, I imagine this is what a defensive fight amidst a mental breakdown sounds like. 'Take your medication Roman'... maybe there is a personal anecdote hidden in this song?

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): iconic for the memes but I wouldn't choose to listen to it otherwise

**team\_kockroach** (6.5): The chorus and verses give me whiplash. I’m fine with Nicki’s crazy energy on this song - it just seems unfocused, especially in the context of the rest of the album.

**CarlieScion** (6): literally just a meme

**frogaranaman** (6): I just think of the Tiktok memes lol

**hunnybee12** (6): how am I supposed to take this seriously anymore

**ignitethephoenix** (6): the song is more meme than an actual song at this point. I like it but more cause I’m amused

**RosaPalms** (6): a huh huh huh huh-huh huh-huh-HUH

**WiiFightTrainer** (6): i'm too lazy to post the ful l verse so someone else please do it

**seanderlust** (5.6): The rapid bongos? Three bars of the song just being grunting noises? O Come All Ye Faithful samples? Queen of just throwing shit at the wall.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): i get the appeal but not my fave nicki

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5): while ranking this song I had to really ask myself if I actually liked this or if I was only for the memes? Turns out it's the latter, cue the insane mumbling

**wavingwolves** (5): ended christianity

**\_helenzhang\_** (4): it's...wild but like in a bad way

**InternetDude19** (4): Honestly, it kind of reminds me of "u".

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): every YT youtuber who managed to learn more than three words of this and made playing it or mumbling it over a reality tv clip every 10 seconds into their personality ruined this song for me. also the ending is just, what who and why is she giving us kidz bop we belong together

**camerinian** (3): You can thank the two 19-year-old white girls I shared a house with for six months for fucking ruining his song for me. They've basically done the same for American Boy too which I think is comparable to a war crime

**steelstepladder** (3): Yeah, I feel confidant in lowballing this a little bit

**vayyiqra** (2): Yeah this bops, but it's so cheesy. It's like Nicki going back and forth between being Marina on The Family Jewels for the chorus and then Lizzo on the verses and then it bizarrely interpolates a Christmas carol which is okay because haha get it holiday, but also the more I listen to this song the more I think "no, I don't like it, it's too weird". An important lesson from science: not all experiments are successful.

**astrologicalangel** (1): I thought the British voice was just an intro skit, but then it came back and it was the chorus... 😬

**fadedblue09** (1): Nicki's worst album absolutely does NOT need redemption, and this is no exception.

**Jackalope117** (1): Roman Holiday by Halsey is 11/10 tho

**carolcrossing** (0): hahahaha i need a roman holiday after this song hahahahaha

**nightjesus** (0): Oh...oh Nicki...I’ve never heard this and I really wish I didn’t...this is really not her best. At all. Like it has potential but then she ruins it with that off tune singing and the Roman persona. It’s a no from me.

**NotWith10000Men** (0): what the f u c k is this

**TiltControls** (0): IMO the weakest by far in this rate. Parts of it work, but it doesn't make me ever want to listen to the whole thing. The chorus is especially grating. Usually I like chaotic Nicki, but not this time. I was the lowest score for it last time (old acc), and it looks like I will be again.

Bleachers makes indie teenager coming-of-age driving-down-a-sunny-highway music and this is a perfect example. (The music video literally takes place on a highway.) The rollicking beat always lifts me up and I'm glad that something from *Strange Desire* had another shot at taking the crown as it is one of my favorite albums of all time. That being said, I really expected it to do better considering it is an absolute bop but I guess y'all only like Jack Antonoff when he gets white pop girls to sing his songs for him.

---

**camerinian** (11): I’m so glad I finally get a chance to give this an 11. This is one of the most perfect hooks indie pop ever dropped, and it is so effortlessly simple, I’m astonished that it still has as much impact as it does. But it’s not just a great hook, it’s everything around it that feeds into how powerful the chorus ends up being. The instant energy provided by the drum fills and the roaring guitars, the immediacy of the lyrics that pulls you straight into the heady rush of the relationship and emotional turmoil that Jack went through, the perfect alternation between his rich baritone on the verses when you need to be drawn in and his soaring upper register when everything flies off the handle in that perfect, perfect chorus. I adore this song, and any type of music that works from the same template as this has a master key direct to my heart. I love it, I love it, I love it.

**SmileAndTears** (11): This is Jack at his best. Absolutely stunning song. We WILL be rioting if this isn't at least in the top 10

**worlds-okayest666** (11): ok this was not an 11 contender for me at ALL, but relistening to it for the rate i was completely won over. i know bleachers are a bit controversial but this is such a good song. it makes me think of speeding down the road, the wind blowing in your face, not a care in the world...i just really like it, idk. it perfectly encapsulates that nostalgic summer feeling for me. I do enjoy the charli version a slight bit more, tho (call me basic!), but this is still immaculate. I had to stan!

**1998tweety** (10): gay bop

**CarlieScion** (10): we all pray to jack godtonoff for good bop fortunes

**ImADudeDuh** (10): its ok

**InternetDude19** (10): I need something to take the sadness out of Saturday night; I guess this will have to do.

**J\_Toe** (10): I didn't hear this album when it was released, but in 2018 when Love, Simon was released, and now it's all I think about then listening to Strange, Desire. I love it.

**skargardin** (10): SUCH A ROLLERCOASTER

**TiltControls** (10): I think I just love Jack Antonoff at this point.

**wavingwolves** (10): yes!!!! i'm a motherfucking rollercoaster

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): the Charli version is a 10

**Stryxen** (9.2): he was really going for cinematic main character end of the film moment here and he nailed it 62.

**lapascalia** (9): Really enjoyed this, sounds like a nostalgic summer song to me

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's no I Wanna Get Better but I have to say I am slightly aroused whenever Jack uses his bass voice and the bridge does it for me

**RosaPalms** (9): the reason “Getaway Car” didn’t get my 11

**steelstepladder** (9): Weeeeeeeeee

**twat\_brained** (9): would be a 10 if it wasn't on 13RW ☺️

**wasian-invasion** (9): I'm a slut for you jack

**gannade** (8): i support my friend dude

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Jack Antonoffs style is so distinct. They way I could see Taylor or Lorde singing this...this is like a song off Lover but with more rock production

**team\_kockroach** (8): These lyrics don’t mean anything, but the guitar riff and percussion are awesome. Knowing Antonoff, it doesn't surprise me.

**bbfan132** (7.5): a fun song but it doesn’t do a ton for me

**RVA\_101** (7.3): The frenetic rhythm reminds me of Joe Jackson's 'Steppin' Out', but with that soaring anthemic synthpop spin that defines most of these songs. I enjoy the rollicking rock sound here.

**seanderlust** (7.1): This song is permanently intertwined with Love, Simon in my brain. I don't know if that works for or against it.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I'm just happy popheads voted in a male-led rock band.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): The mixing bothers me a lot but still a bop

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this is fun

**vayyiqra** (7): Jackoff good but this isn't one of his best but it's still good

**kappyko** (6): i guess

**nightjesus** (6): This is cute. Kinda sounds like a 2012 indie throwback.

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Probably my favorite Bleachers song, but honestly I just don’t like Antonoff’s band project. It’s kinda telling that I listen to the Charli version more, and I don’t even like Charli!

**NotWith10000Men** (3.5): this is so bland

**selegend** (2): no <3

**Sundraliz** (1): This is the kind of song I hated hearing on the radio in 2014

**awhile2** (0): as much as i may dislike some of antanoffs work with the pop girlies at least hes not making trash like this anymore

I lowkey like the HAIM cover of this better but the songwriting is super memorable. Shania gets very little love on this subreddit (probably because of her association with c**ntry music) but I'm glad this got in anyways. Not at all shocked it's in the bottom 10 because of the amount of twang though.

---

**NotWith10000Men** (11): I'm not exaggerating when I say this is one of the greatest country songs of the 20th century

**1998tweety** (10): canadian excellence

**agentofscranton** (10): the canadian divas rate results were such a travesty omg how was shania not the entire top 3 smh

**bbfan132** (10): iconic country bop <3

**brendjac** (10): This song looks like Brad Pitt AND will keep me warm in the middle of the night

**cashewconstellation** (10): BOP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended men

**ManofOranges** (10): This song DO impress me much.

**mudkip1** (10): bop

**skargardin** (10): yall better not rob this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): miss Shania is so underrated on Popheads and that don't impress me much

**TiltControls** (10): Country QUEEN!!!! Demolish that man

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Country-pop BANGER. Can't get over how the riff reminds me of the Hannah Montana theme for some reason.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): when I say I listen to country music, I mean this

**jasannn** (9.5): This is my first time listening to this and I can already tell this is iconic.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): Shania taught young, 6 year old, gay me, that men weren't shit and that I shouldn't be impressed by them. I didn't listen, but she made the effort

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): A megabop and a classic

**pat-rickstar** (9): International version >>> country version

**PointlessBibliophage** (9): ended m*n

**rickikardashian** (9): shania said KAM in the 90s and she was right

**yourfacesucksass** (9): Quote me, this is Shania's best from Come on Over.

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): For a 21 year old song, it carries a lot of personality. It’s a little longer than it needs to be, though.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8): I loved the music video for this growing up, always thought that Shania was one of the coolest, most confident women out there.

**lapascalia** (8): I forgot how much fun this song was lmao

**wavingwolves** (8): several points were made in this song

**RVA\_101** (7.7): I forgot just how massive this album was. I'm not trying to disrespect Taylor Swift fans because my flair probably sets off red flags but this album perfected the country pop formula long before Fearless did. Actually this is more country rock than pop I'll admit. I dig the twangy guitar licks and fills.

**twat\_brained** (7.6): well Shania hasn't impressed me in recent years so (blows raspberry)

**seanderlust** (7.3): "Okay, so you're Brad Pitt. That don't impress me much." - someone who has never seen Troy.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): Look, I appreciate Shania Twain's songwriting ability, but her music is just too twangy for me to like

**CrimsonROSET** (7): Well, THAT impressed me much! [INSERT LAUGH TRACK]

**steelstepladder** (7): I mean it impresses me a little bit

**Stryxen** (7): It’s hard when I know nothing about a song and rate it, I just always default to 7 in case im missing something

**camerinian** (6.5): I mean… it don't.

**anothertown** (6): Ok. So you're Brad Pitt!

**MelodramaticLemonade** (6): With a title like this, it's just calling for trouble

**nightjesus** (6): This brings me back to long trips across the country in the 90’s.

**worlds-okayest666** (6): i feel like i should like this a lot more than i do

**plastichaxan** (5.8): i feel so mean this rate but this is how i've felt about a few songs so far :(

**awhile2** (5): literally the most common four chord progression in rock right? save tonight and passenger both instantly come to mind

**RosaPalms** (5): I loved this in the nineties when it came out, but it doesn’t hold up

**Tolk1en** (5): Correct song but I can't rate country music properly...especially in this rate

**Hielord** (4.5): Well...

**cocosairdep** (4): Those spoken lines are hard to hear.

**wasian-invasion** (4): First time listening to it, but idk I was expecting more?

**bespectacIed** (1): society has progressed past the need for country music

**vayyiqra** (0): Yeah no. I grew up in Ontario in the 90s and never liked this song and never want to hear it again. It's not that good.

*Hounds of Love* is one of the highest scored albums ever rated, so I was expecting a song from it to pop up here. I like it enough although it feels a bit needlessly chaotic. I'm very curious to see how "Running Up That Hill" does in the second Winners Rate next month considering this stayed in the bottom rungs of the rate basically the entire time.

---

**bbfan132** (11): absolute fucking perfection, i love kate bush so much

**InternetDude19** (11): This might be my favorite song ever. No other song is able to capture the rush and the fear of falling in love like this one.

**bespectacIed** (10): Never understood how most people would put running up that flop and ballbusting above this masterpiece. Anyways the point is moot, Paper Bag should have won that artpop rate.

**J\_Toe** (10): so lush and beautiful. I definitely understand Writer in the Dark more after listening to this track, and the album as a whole.

**kappyko** (10): who the fuck are the kate bush stans that did this we could have had janet

**RandomHypnotica** (10): I'd still rank Cloudbusting a fraction higher than this, but the title track is still so exceptional they all deserve 10's

**RosaPalms** (10): an experience. cinematic.

**steelstepladder** (10): This better get top 10

**Stryxen** (10): im giving out so many tens but like how can I listen to this and give it anything less

**vayyiqra** (10): One of her prettiest and most :uwu: and relatable and underrated songs ever. I don't think this will win, but I really hope it does well. This is one of the best synthpop ballads ever.

**wavingwolves** (10): classic

**twat\_brained** (9.7): okay maybe cloudbustingmp3 has made some points

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): this isn't even like top 10 in this rate for me probably just because it's so stacked but god this is such a good song kate would really deserve to win

**camerinian** (9.5): I might go and throw my shoes into the lake yuh

**ReallyCreative** (9): can't wait for Ms. Bush to get robbed by a generic Dula Peep song

**SmileAndTears** (9): Wait wtf this is so good

**Sundraliz** (9): The hounds of love have really been coming for me lately girls :(

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**RVA\_101** (8.5): Kate Bush crawled so Bjork and Fiona Apple could walk, so Lorde and any other current alternative pop artist could run. While this isn't my favorite song off the album, it's still one of its many high points.

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): Everything has aged so well. I love the rock-influenced drums and the ooh-ooh-ooh’s the most.

**frogaranaman** (8): I _AM_ a Kate Bush gay!! and what about it!!!!

**yourfacesucksass** (8): As someone who listened to Kate Bush for the first time because of this rate, I am really pleasantly surprised. I don't really know what I was expected, but I love how this song feels like I'm running through the forest. I like that it just moves forward and (I realize this sounds stupid lmao) like, it's just moving forward omg I'll end my comment now.

**seanderlust** (7.7): Hmm, what should we add as a sample to this love song? I know! How about a 1950s B-grade horror movie?

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): Not bad, but I don't see myself coming back to it much

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I once again appreciate how ahead of her time she was, but this isn’t really for me

**CrimsonROSET** (6.7): Again, where's the explosive end? It just fizzles out.

**bulforster** (6.5): This is a bit too manic for me.

**awhile2** (6): probably her most overrated single easily

**bigbigbee** (6): I really wish I liked this more than I do. There’s such a wonderful Florence and the Machine sound in the instrumental here (yes, I know this song came first), but IDK, I just don’t enjoy listening to it.

**cashewconstellation** (6): don't crucify me, this is my first time listening to Kate Bush and ugh, it's kinda mediocre

**fadedblue09** (6): I think this works better as an album track. But honestly, saying this needs redemption sounds kinda oxymoronic considering its parent album swept in its original rate and is the record holder for highest album average (I believe?).

**lapascalia** (6): Not my style

**skargardin** (6): Look I get why this is here and I love some songs on this album but this particular song doesn't really do anything for me sadly

**Tolk1en** (6): this is....ok but does it really need redemption ?

**NotWith10000Men** (5): don't really like how she sings sorry

**mudkip1** (4): i like her other music better

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): i like the drums

**gannade** (3.5): its not the worst thing ever

**nightjesus** (2): Kate Bush is a hit and miss artist for me. I gotta say I didn’t enjoy this.

**selegend** (2): boring

In retrospect, the fact that this only came in 4th in /u/kappyko's EDM rate (*Settle vs. Skin vs. 99.9%*) is pretty shocking, considering it was the most commercially successful and critically lauded song in that rate. The Disclosure song that went on to win that rate, "White Noise," ended up placing last in the first Winners Rate, so I like to think this song being voted back in is justice for a poor result back in 2017. It actually held onto a spot in the top 10 for the first 50 or so ballots, but slided down all the way to 23rd.

---

**plvstvcbvrds** (11): This song is literally everything. It's a club bop, it's a rainy day moment, it's a pre-game, it's that one time I got lost in the city i went to undergrad after a party trying to get back to my dorm alone playing music on my phone speaker even though my phone was on 2 percent and I should have called an Uber instead of walking

**1998tweety** (10): nonbinary excellence, such a massive bop

**anothertown** (10): i forgot how much this BANGS!!!

**awhile2** (10): one of the best hits of the last decade

**bbfan132** (10): i honestly don’t care for most of sam’s music, but this is undeniably great (the production helps for sure)

**bespectacIed** (10): Excellent. I had a crush on the cute guy on the elevator in the mv (paolo gallardo) omg

**bigbigbee** (10): Da, da-da~ I used to do contemporary dance in high school, and this song makes me miss that. On a related note, I’m mad that this song was never used properly on SYTYCD (it was featured in one Vegas week and once as a slowed-down piano cover – booo!)

**frogaranaman** (10): this took me BACK

**hikkaru** (10): disclosure's pop songs are sooo good

**ignitethephoenix** (10): perfection. Disclosure and Sam never miss (stream Omen as well).

**InternetDude19** (10): Perfection

**ManofOranges** (10): I remember Sam Smith was literally every during that one like 2014-ish period. Constant youtube ads for Stay With Me and I heard I'm Not the Only One a lot as well. But while I really didn't care for those songs, I really dig this one. I know it's a take that's been done to death already, but it's true it's true!

**skargardin** (10): such a banger

**steelstepladder** (10): One of the best songs of the 2010's

**Sundraliz** (10): wtf was that meme that had this song in it. Someone please link it to me. NOT the ones with all the furries.

**teenage\_meme** (10): now this is a SONG. the production is endlessly satisfying.

**TiltControls** (10): One of the best electronic collabs of the 2010's. Before this sam smith was just some slow ballad singer so it was surprising to see them absolutely demolish on this song. Maybe we should try to get Lewis Capaldi to do the same 🤔🤔

**twat\_brained** (10): one of my favorites in 2014

**wavingwolves** (10): DAAA DAAA

**worlds-okayest666** (10): still bangs as hard as it did when it came out. I wish Sam would make more dance music, their voice sounds immaculate on it (arguably better than it does on some of their ballads).

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): This is one of only two good Sam Smith songs. Can you guess what the other one is?

**camerinian** (9.5): Settle is such a fucking good album it's ridiculous. Disclosure are groove kings and their chemistry with Sam is obviously perfect and symbiotic and complementary and their belting is something incredible too. Intimacy has never sounded so big

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): This is still the best song either of the acts have made.

**lapascalia** (9.5): It sounds just as fresh as it did when I first heard it, a real modern classic for me.

**agentofscranton** (9): i used to despise this song for some reason but that was when i was young and dumb and i know better now god bless

**Hielord** (9): I am floating in space

**jasannn** (9): Who would've thought that Sam Smith on house synthy song would work so well?

**wasian-invasion** (9): I've always known this song was great but listening to it purposefully for the rate really makes me appreciate how amazing this song is

**nightjesus** (8.5): This was one of my favourite songs in 2013. It’s kinda aged for me now but still a bop nonetheless.

**brendjac** (8): Bop bop boppity bop!

**CarlieScion** (8): fuck user leixander

**RosaPalms** (8): still one of only two Sam Smith tracks I’ll listen to on purpose

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): their most popular song for a reason

**vayyiqra** (8): I have no words to say here other than "bop".

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I was gonna give this shit a super low score but I'm drunk and it kinda slaps?

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its good but real overrated tbh

**nowqueenofpop** (7): This song is objectively good but it’s making me feel like I’m in HS again and I can’t!

**SmileAndTears** (7): Eh. It's fine I guess

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (6.5): this song was so overplayed

**pat-rickstar** (6): I've never really got the hype for this song

**seanderlust** (5.8): "Now I got you in my space, I won't let go of you" - the Other Mother from Coraline

**akanewasright** (5): I don’t really like this song very much (it was overplayed to the extent that it barely sounds like music to me anymore), but it’s too well produced for me to give a score any lower than this.

**team\_kockroach** (5): Beautiful verses let down by an ugly chorus - and why are there only two verses? I went through Disclosure’s discography, and they’ve got range: working with a full orchestra on Sam Smith’s “Writing’s on the Wall”, clicking drums on Lorde’s “Magnets”, and catchy steel drums (I think?) on Khalid’s “Know Your Worth”. Why did Disclosure drop the ball on this one?

**RVA\_101** (4.6): I'll admit, this doesn't do too much for me. Just sounds slightly like a generic MDMA rave club anthem on first impression. Maybe I just need to listen to it more. It's hard distilling these songs to a single score based on a single listen. God knows how many Kanye songs I initially thought were trash before relistening.

**astrologicalangel** (4): overplay has ruined this for me

**cashewconstellation** (4): what is this

**fadedblue09** (4): Really don't care for this kind of music, I'm sorry.

**plastichaxan** (4): I know this is one of Sam's best songs and I like them but I can never click with their music, and I've tried. I really have tried

**Stryxen** (4): I hate to say it but I just don’t care. maybe it’s the overexposure. or the disclosure

**brenda\_official** (3): i can’t deal with sam’s voice no

**Awkward\_King** (2): listen i wanna exaggerate my low scores so they still actually have some weight but a 2 in this rate is like a 7 in any other rate, i've just never liked latch as much as most other people. but i fucking love the la la latch medley/cover by pentatonix, maybe it's sam smith i dont like lol

**CreepyMannequin** (0): I forgot how much I hate Sam Smith’s vocal performance on this song

**ReallyCreative** (0): Sam's lower register is so amazing... and then in the chorus they decide they want to squawk and screech like a bird, I hope this song flies away. I don't know why they did this. I don't know what the point is. And baby all I need for you to know is-

An emotional bop. Pink sounds like she's on the verge of tears this whole song and it's a gut punch on every listen. This was one of the highest voted songs in the nomination stage, probably because of its unique emotional depth (for a pop hit, at least). I have to say, I REALLY expected this to do better because it just screams "song Popheads should stan" to me, but I guess it couldn't overcome people's negative feelings towards Pink.

---

**fadedblue09** (11): I just love soulful, powerful pop-rock bops with a bittersweet side to it. Seeing its parent album get demolished in its original rate, and being shut out for the first All-Stars, I guess it’s fitting that this gets redemption. And as much as I love Kelly (see flair), y’all overrated her a bit (the Breakaway title track really didn’t need to be in Top 5…). Damn, doing this rate makes me wish I really joined them sooner!

**ImADudeDuh** (11): This is one of the best and most emotional pop hits of all time tbh.

**RosaPalms** (11): no flash, no gimmick, just the perfect marriage of deep emotion and weapons-grade hooks. this song is a staggering achievement. this song is poptimism made manifest.

**selegend** (11): there are very few songs that make me cry l!ke a b!tch and th!s !s one of them.. her vocals are so raw and vulnerable !t’s astound!ng

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop, one of her most underrated songs methinks

**astrologicalangel** (10): was prepared to rate this a 6 or 7 until I listened to it and remembered how amazing it was

**awhile2** (10): most underrated p!nk single

**cashewconstellation** (10): one of my favorite P!nk songs, did Euphoria before Euphoria

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This song is the perfect mix between emotional Pink and pop-punk Pink, and I don't think she'll ever be able to top it. Also the strings in the last chorus are orgasmic

**steelstepladder** (10): Comparing this to anything Pink has done in the past few years is staggering

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): oh man this song just hits hard every time. one of pink's best

**teenage\_meme** (10): one of my all-time faves. the lyrics hit hard.

**TiltControls** (10): If Supercut didn't exist this is an easy 11

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this always gets me emotional skfjghdkg. one of her best

**camerinian** (9.5): I really love it when Pink moves away from her snarky, detached side and just goes straight for the emotional jugular. This track is devastating in the best ways

**bespectacIed** (9): pink made topnotch caucasian music

**SmileAndTears** (9): This is really good omg

**wavingwolves** (9): pop rock excellence

**twat\_brained** (8.8): I heard Please Don't Leave Me on the radio yesterday and it reminds me how it's kind of a step down from this

**bbfan132** (8): a pleasant song but it isn’t amazing or anything

**cocosairdep** (8): Nostalgia might be upping this 1 or 2 points tbh. It just encapsulates that pop-rock 2000s sound so well.

**nowqueenofpop** (8): The way this and the everytime mv used to make me cry! Emotional classics

**Stryxen** (8): lol I just remembered that song she did for spongebob about scurvy. this one is pretty good too

**Tolk1en** (8): Not a fan of P!nk and her music but this is one of her best. Deserves redemption

**wasian-invasion** (8): aww my mom loves this song

**seanderlust** (7.9): Starting a Change.Org petition for a version of this song with just strings backing her voice

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): good but not iconic for pink compared to other songs

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): can't deny that chorus

**RVA\_101** (7.3): I immediately recognized this song as soon as she started singing and didn't know Who Knew was the title I thought it was 'Long Gone' or something lmfao I'm a dumbass. This is pretty good anyway. A radio staple, but one that's more tolerable than it is irritating. Properly listening through headphones as opposed to in a Walmart let the tinier details like the strings and synths shine through the overbearing rock guitars.

**akanewasright** (7): I... forgot about how emotional this song was. I can’t even take off as many “Dr. Luke points” as I’d like to, this was just too good. This deserves a 10.

**nightjesus** (7): Ugh once again 2006 delivers with Pink’s ‘I’m not Dead’. This song had young me craving for a love I didn’t even understand.

**skargardin** (6): I have a soft spot for Pink but this is just ok

**lapascalia** (5): Is it just me or does this kind of sound like Since U Been Gone at the beginning? Anyway, it’s not a bad song but Pink doesn’t really do it for me unfortunately.

**vintagebathingsuit** (5): ehh...it's okay

**ReallyCreative** (4): more like Who Cares

**vayyiqra** (4): Yeah no I don't vibe with Pink and never have. I respect her as a person, but her music is boring. My mom literally drove a minivan when I was a kid so I know what I'm talking about here.

**team\_kockroach** (3.5): P!nk’s so unenthusiastic. The subpar lyrics and bad production don’t help things either.

**anothertown** (3): Thank you Alecia, that’s enough

**CrimsonROSET** (3): Where's the boom? This song should end with an explosion, not with a whisper! What the hell, Pink?

**yourfacesucksass** (3): I just really hate this song lmao. If anyone ever wondered why P!nk is now fully adult contemporary, this is why.

**Sundraliz** (0): This was the kind of song I hated hearing on the radio all the time in 2006

It may not mean much but I'm very proud of how Y&Y has grown in popularity over the years on this subreddit. They're really exactly what this sub always says they're looking for in a gay pop star: unapologetic electropop bops with colorful visuals. And I also like to think that both of their albums' unlikely inclusions in rates have contributed to that growth <3 <3 Even though this ended up not making the top 20 they will ALWAYS be rate winners and not every artist can say that.

---

**Hielord** (11): I live for a bop with strong gay vibes.

**1998tweety** (10): synthpop excellence, kingies snapped

**agentofscranton** (10): still as euphoric as the first time that i heard it, what a fucking moment

**bespectacIed** (10): Aptly named. Pop bliss.

**bigbigbee** (10): Surprise of the rate for me – I’d never heard this before, but I loved it instantly.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Glee would cover this in a heartbeat.

**CritneySpearz** (10): slaps, fucking Olly is a gay icon wow

**frogaranaman** (10): good god this never gets old

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this is definitely my favourite song from them. A perfect blend of dance and pop

**J\_Toe** (10): This song is great hook after great hook, and they still improved a lot by their next album

**skargardin** (10): iconic, reset, olly sounds SO good here its insane

**wavingwolves** (10): this is a song that just brings me back instantly to that one especific pop music period in 2015

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i am so tired of y’all sleeping on y&y it makes me SICK!!! a gay man making unabashed electropop bops...what isn’t there to love like i truly don’t get it

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): Pure electropop bliss

**TiltControls** (9.5): Perfect mix of great production and great vocals.

**camerinian** (9): If I ever make music of my own, this is what I want it to sound like. Majestic

**steelstepladder** (9): Aaaaaaa that synth riff makes me so happy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i forgot how much i loved this song

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): I associate this song with such a special time in my life. The somewhat beginning of Fall 2015, leading up to even greater things. Ugh, whenever I hear it, it just takes me back immediately and I love it.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I actually don't know why I'm not into Years & Years more, I haven't heard a song by them I haven't really liked

**seanderlust** (8.4): Uncredited co-writer of this song: Miss Sarah Tonin.

**bbfan132** (8): this was my favorite song in 2015 - i don’t love it as much now but it’s still good and brings me back

**nightjesus** (8): Years & Years are seriously underrated. They produce pop perfection. Shine is still a song I constantly listen to and this album has been out for 5 years.

**Stryxen** (8): I love this song but I want to spread my scores out a bit. this would usually be like a 9.5

**twat\_brained** (8): love the juxtaposition in the lyrics: I was the king under your control

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't really like this band but this is a good song and also synthpop good.

**wasian-invasion** (8): one of the last songs I ever bought on iTunes lol

**lapascalia** (7.5): Pretty good, but also sounds a tiny bit generic to me…

**jasannn** (7): I thought this was a The Weeknd Song.

**RosaPalms** (7): is that a damn bag-pipe on the drop? ok dis hard

**SmileAndTears** (7): There's something I don't like about that chorus but I can't put my finger on it

**RVA\_101** (6.7): Euphoric production that reminds me of Latch, but better executed.

**akanewasright** (6.5): This slaps

**CarlieScion** (6): fuck u TK

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): ehhhh sounds very boy bandy

**anothertown** (5): generic

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): the beginning instrumental is actually very annoying

**selegend** (4): i’ve always liked shine much more

**gannade** (3): i heard his voice crack on the first two words and i dont think the song improved from there

**fadedblue09** (1.5): I really hope that one day I can find a male LGBT musician to stan, cause these synthpop acts really aren’t doing anything for me.

**mudkip1** (1): i find this bland

**team\_kockroach** (0): The lyrics are vapid, and the male vocalist sucks. After 2 minutes, I turned it off to listen to the Carly Rae Jepsen version - and I still didn’t like it.

jfc this song is 7 and a half minutes long! and somehow doesn't drag! This is a textbook power ballad but the constant tempo changes and theatrics make it stand out immensely. This only barely made it into the rate but it's definitely not the typical Popheads Approved song so good for Celine at getting another shot. It ended up beating some more traditional bops that got more votes than it in the nomination stage so I think it did well all things considered!

---

**rickikardashian** (11): this was the first rate i did, and to this day, i'm not over the heartbreak of having my first 11 lose the way it did. shania and celine were disrespected like no other that day and that’s a wound that might never heal

**1998tweety** (10): canadian excellence

**anothertown** (10): Celine rules. AND IF WE!!

**bbfan132** (10): i love how the queen of bland adult contemporary music somehow released an epic 8 minute track that is packed with tons of raw emotion and is easily her best song…. celine did that

**bespectacIed** (10): not mad this got in bc this is my fave celine song but Prom >>>>>

**CarlieScion** (10): major bop

**fadedblue09** (10): Ooh, another song that I voted in! Truly a divine experience in every listen, and the definition of an epic, monstrous ballad. One of the few 5+ minute songs that is actually worth it (Venice Bitch wishes).

**ignitethephoenix** (10): legendary...they don’t make it like this anymore

**ManofOranges** (10): Literally iconic. This is one of those songs where I kinda forget about, but when I hear those opening notes, it all just comes back to me now.

**nootnoot781** (10): this song is so fucking melodramatic but oh my god it works so well

**nowqueenofpop** (10): the fact that this song is here and didn't win its rate the first time around tells me that no one has enough taste to appreciate this 7 1/2 minute power ballad. She was 2nd in line to get my 11

**selegend** (10): i know this is a 6 minute ballad but every second of it is so gorgeous that the song never feels like it’s 6 minutes. like it feels like that movie that you could just keep watching over and over without getting sick of it

**teenage\_meme** (10): this song is everything i hate: a ballad, schmaltzy as heck, over 5 minutes long..... and yet it almost got my 11. it's the DRAMA of it all! the sound effects, the dynamics, that climax of BABY BABY BABY! so good. the exception to all my rules.

**TiltControls** (10): This was one of my last cuts before sending my ballot since I didn't think it had much chance getting in (cause ballad). But I am so so glad it managed, it's an absolute classic oozing passion! It's so satisfying to just belt (or lipsync) out!

**Tolk1en** (10): all hail the queen Celine

**camerinian** (9.5): listen to Meat Loaf you cowards this is literally dad rock and it's fuckin sick

**twat\_brained** (9.2): Saw Celine open her Courage tour with this and it honestly floored me

**bigbigbee** (9): Yeah it’s super long but this scratches my theater kid itch just right

**jasannn** (9): The emotion in her voice elevates the song so much.

**purplechilipepper** (9): Canadian queen serving us the shameless drama

**SmileAndTears** (9): Ok this is beautiful but it didn't need to be 7 minutes long. Also omg those thunder sound effects I-

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): god they just don't do music videos and ballads like this now. 90s theatrics were really on another level

**wasian-invasion** (9): I went through a period in high school where I was obsessed with this song. The melodrama of it all still gives me life

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): ok this song does not feel as long as it is because her voice is angelic omg

**akanewasright** (8): One of the most amazingly bombastic and over the top songs ever.

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I can't believe I've been sleeping on celine my whole life

**RosaPalms** (8): this slayed in the nineties and still does

**skargardin** (8): vocal queen

**team\_kockroach** (8): As an ‘03 baby, it’s hard to objectively listen to 90’s pop. I like all the tempo changes, though.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): i expected to hate this but this is actually really good...not sure if it needed to be 7 minutes long tho

**yourfacesucksass** (8): Miss Meat Loaf has some pipes!

**plastichaxan** (7.9): this could've used like one minute less

**Stryxen** (7.8): SEVEN AND A HALF MINUTES WHY …anyway this is in the best episode of glee !!

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): I was liking this song, but then it seemingly repeated itself, and then I realised the track was just 7 minutes long for no reason instead

**cocosairdep** (7.5): Nice song, but it was a little bit too long. Also, some lyrics were kind of weird for a love song: *There were those empty threats and hollow lies/ And whenever you tried to hurt me/ I just hurt you even worse* Don’t mess with Céline, I guess.

**lapascalia** (7.5): How did I not know this is over 7 minutes long?! She sounds amazing as usual though.

**seanderlust** (7.2): Clock the vulnerability shift between the end of the first verse and the start of the first "but when you touch me like this"

**nightjesus** (7): I used to sing this song all the time when I was little. It’s still an emotional ballad but holy moly it’s so long.

**pat-rickstar** (7): One point for each minute of the song…

**wavingwolves** (7): yeah this goes hard but i still can't believe this is here instead of prom by sza...

**RVA\_101** (6.3): This particular production sounds like something straight out of a Broadway play. I've never been a particularly big fan of Broadway. The sleigh bells unintentionally give me confused Christmas vibes. This is like a cross between an ASPCA song and All I Want for Christmas Is You. Her belting halfway in though remind me why she's deservedly respected among vocalists. It's still a good song, but maybe not something I'd come back to from these 30.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): This is a 10, but I detracted a point for every minute that could've been cut from this song.

**hunnybee12** (6): 90s diva ballads are not my thing

**gannade** (5): i kinda wish i voted for sza now

**steelstepladder** (5): Still kinda shocked the Celine Dion stans came in clutch

**Jackalope117** (4): would've given this song a 5-6 maybe but why is this garbage 20 fucking minutes long

**vayyiqra** (2): Yeah no. I'm also flexing my Canadian privilege on this one and saying I do not ever want to hear Celine again unless I'm watching Titanic. This is unbearable and I like long songs but this is auditory torture and should be banned under the Geneva Convention.

I like *Loose* more in concept than execution, and this song is an example of why: it just feels very overproduced. This is one of two songs from the *Loose vs. The Dutchess vs. Oral Fixation, Vol. 2* rate, and I'm surprised it made it in considering I don't see it talked about very much in comparison to other Nelly songs.

---

**nightjesus** (11): This song. This freaking song. My young tween self was not ready for 2006 and the iconic music the year blessed us with. Maneater shook me in a way that I still haven’t recovered from 14 years later. Loose in general is just an album that I still go back to.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): i prefer 3 or 4 of the other singles on loose but that just goes to show how strong of an album loose is

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): absolute bop! This was the height of Nelly's (and Timbaland's!) career. We're never gonna see anybody do it like this again.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): major bop!

**plastichaxan** (10): sometimes i forget Nelly Furtado's impact in my life I've failed as a latino

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): Again, just a monumental moment in my gay ass existence. This song came out and it was instantly my bisexual thot anthem to slut drop to at every party it played at in high school. i broke an iphone dancing to this shit at homecoming, ok. and it wasn't my phone!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This is the superior Nelly song to Promiscuous and I would gladly die on this hill

**skargardin** (10): anthem

**Sundraliz** (10): quintessential listening

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): queen of vore

**TiltControls** (10): A fantastic song from a fantastic album.

**Tolk1en** (10): This song is a box filled with nostalgic moments and high school memories

**twat\_brained** (10): SHE'S A MANEATER! A MANEATER!!!

**worlds-okayest666** (10): hot take incoming: this > Promiscuous. Promiscuous is a classic too, but this just exudes POWER...it never fails to make me feel like the baddest bitch alive. to be fair, the (absolutely iconic) Just Dance routine def made me love this song more

**Hielord** (9.5): This song is such a banger a speaker caught fire when they were recording it.

**akanewasright** (9): What a damn good pop song. Timbaland and Danja are such good producers

**anothertown** (9): the live drums really carry this album! sometimes i like this more than promiscuous

**J\_Toe** (9): I can actually imagine Britney singing this track or Promiscuous if she released an album in 2005/06

**teenage\_meme** (9): did anyone read the "behind the lyrics" on spotify? what a fun, informative ride. anyway, timbaland can do very little wrong in my eyes. a genius.

**wavingwolves** (9): period

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): me once this quarantine is over tbh, trashy and obnoxious but very iconic and fun coming from Ms. Furtado

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): a banger but i hate what they did to her vocals

**bigbigbee** (7): I was a kid around the time this song was on the radio, but I never really connected with it then. I’ll listen to it if it’s on but I won’t seek it out.

**camerinian** (7): The verses are kind of a lot but fuck me that hook is all-time

**cashewconstellation** (7): this is my first time hearing it, the chorus is kinda nice, but it's just okay

**frogaranaman** (7): is this song about eating ass

**nowqueenofpop** (7): Hall & Oates could never

**RosaPalms** (7): at our senior variety show, this girl was gonna do like a krav maga demonstration and she was looking for the right music for the routine and I suggested this and she told me, verbatim, “I really don’t wanna go out there to a song called ‘maneater’” and I get it, but I feel like an opportunity was lost nonetheless

**SmileAndTears** (7): These verses are NOT it. Can't say I enjoy this style of production either. Love the chorus

**steelstepladder** (7): Say It Right is better

**vayyiqra** (7): Yeah this song is kind of a banger and has a strong chorus, but it's far from the best song on Loose, let alone the best in this rate so no sorry. Also, her voice is annoyingly nasal in the verses but that's just how she sings to be fair.

**wasian-invasion** (7): Never listened to this song before but not bad. The chorus is super catchy but the verses are a bit grating

**seanderlust** (6.9): I'm going to set my thoughts on the song aside and instead highlight that according to Furtado, A SPEAKER CAUGHT FIRE WHILE THEY WERE RECORDING.

**RVA\_101** (6.8): I'll admit I was more familiar with Say It Right and Promiscuous than this one. Still think I prefer those two after listening to this one again but it's still a fun little club song, drums hit hard. Man Timbaland was undefeated in 06 wasn't he. Lmao at his little outro too

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): Every aspect of this song is shooting in a different direction, but I can't not love it?

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the chorus is way better than the verses

**astrologicalangel** (6): it's catcy but idk about the lyrics...

**ManofOranges** (6): I do like this song, at least somewhat, but part of it just seems to drone on.

**yourfacesucksass** (6): Something about this song, it's like it could've been better but it just...

**cremeebrulee** (5): i prefer promiscuous

**team\_kockroach** (5): The acapella bridge is irritating. Otherwise, it’s a very average ‘00’s song.

**fadedblue09** (4): Really boring, not super fond of her 2006 output tbh. Debut era Nelly >>>>>

**purplechilipepper** (4): I really don't get the Timbaland style tbh it's always felt so soulless to me

**Jackalope117** (1): My life is worse for hearing this

**mudkip1** (1): grating

A song that really shouldn't work as well as it does. There are very few full-on Fergie *stans* left out there, but her singles run in *The Dutchess* era is highly revered by this subreddit for being campy, fun and majorly commercially successful, leaving no surprise why this was voted in. Unfortunately, those same aspects held back this song among some participants, leading to its elimination in the bottom half of the rate.

---

**kappyko** (11): literally THE reason i wanted this rate to happen so if lady gaga is above this im breaking something

**wavingwolves** (11): nothing more iconic than this i think

**WiiFightTrainer** (11): this made me misspell tasty in 4th grade. a lot.

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**awhile2** (10): my go to karaoke song

**fadedblue09** (10): Queen of creating an adjective for herself! Your fave could NEVER.

**frogaranaman** (10): really just one of those songs that makes you think, "how _can_ someone hate this?"

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a cultural reset

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Classic!

**ManofOranges** (10): Part of my identity growing up was being able to sing the rap portion of this song. It was a sport for me to be the only one at the party who actually know this part, or if there was someone else who knew it, then it was a competition to see who could do that part the best, and there was no way in hell I was going to lose.

**nightjesus** (10): Once again 2006 delivers with Fergalicious from the Dutchess. If you don’t need to sit down after listening to this song you’re not doing it right. Also low key humble brag, this is my go to karaoke song and the crowd loves it.

**nowqueenofpop** (10): I think loving this at six years old genuinely shaped me as a person

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Glamourous was outsold here, but this song is still an all-time classic, and I'm a sucker for spelling in songs

**rickikardashian** (10): fergie dropping the illiteracy rates in the country. L-E-J-E-N-D

**skargardin** (10): the confidence she exudes, i want that

**Stryxen** (10): just for the cultural impact

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): how many of ur faves can put their name in a song and have it come out perfect? none i bet

**twat\_brained** (10): this song is just hook after hook after hook and it NEVER GETS OLD

**worlds-okayest666** (10): Fergie is unironically a fave of mine and I will defend her until the day I die. this is genuinely a perfect pop song: it’s well-produced, catchy, has just the right amount of attitude and star power...truly iconic.

**SideBTrack8** (9.5): tastey

**TiltControls** (9.5): F to the E R G the I the E is ICONIC here!! I think I listened to it so much in 6th grade I know the lyrics off by heart at this point

**anothertown** (9): I am ok with this being 5 minutes long. Each piece of this song comes in, stays its welcome, and returns when needed. Balance and equilibrium

**bespectacIed** (9): the dutchess' singles run whew, classic after classic

**joeeswift** (9): this song makes my lonely ass feel like I’m being lusted after

**plvstvcbvrds** (9): because william misspells the word tasty but outside of that, it's a bop!

**Sundraliz** (9): Will.i.am was right this is it

**bbfan132** (8.5): a bop but i don’t love it

**hikkaru** (8.5): is there anything in the world as iconic as this

**bigbigbee** (8): Fergie said stop calling singers by their given names as if you’re their best friend!

**teenage\_meme** (8): the rap is still iconic, but i see this mostly as a novelty song from my early teen years. it goes on REALLY long, but so many memories associated with this one.

**wasian-invasion** (8): Iconic karaoke pick. The radio edit would be ranked higher, but this outro(?) is like a minute and a half too long

**yourfacesucksass** (8): I mastered the fastest part of the song, and for WHO? I guess just MYSELF.

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): It was a 5 before I came to the realization I know every single line.

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): I've stanned this song since the third grade

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7): Fergie and will.i.am are the og spelling bee champions, sorry tswift

**jasannn** (7): TA TA TA TA TASTY. I do wish the song was a little shorter

**lapascalia** (7): It’s fun and catchy but I’m also kind of tired of it…

**steelstepladder** (7): Iconic? Yes. Does it deserve a higher placement than most of the songs here? No.

**vayyiqra** (7): Good meme song, great shitpost; too bad it goes on about a full minute longer than it needs to though.

**lightningcrying** (6.5): not nearly as good as i remembered it being,,, what happened

**RVA\_101** (6.2): 'T A S T E Y' c'mon Will. His production is still great tho. Fergie's sort of rap-singing style reminds me as a predecessor to Kesha's style.

**akanewasright** (6): I miss Fergie a lot.

**camerinian** (6): Just let Fergie have her fucking solo career Will

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's iconic but it's also just bad, as far as egotistic flex songs go I've heard worse

**RosaPalms** (6): it’s iconic but is it good? T A S T E Y

**seanderlust** (5.3): "I got reasons why I tease em" cardi b voice WHAT WAS THE REASON??? WHAT WAS THE REASON???!?!?

**Hielord** (4.8): This song doesn't have the right to be almost 5 minutes long.

**astrologicalangel** (3): the beat sounds like a swarm of bees and I can't ignore it

**team\_kockroach** (2.5): -_- Don’t make me listen to the Black Eyed Peas again

**Jackalope117** (2): Fergie is not it

**wanderingimpromptu3** (2): catchy but annoying

**insolentire** (1): What I don't like about Fergie that in her solo she was just Will.I.Am's pawn. And it's a shame since she sometimes shows that she could be quite interesting in her own way (take A Little Party Never Killed Nobody)

**InternetDude19** (0): Bad memories.

**pat-rickstar** (0): Thought about not using my 0 for this rate because there's not really a deserving song here but this is my least favourite

**purplechilipepper** (0): I feel bad because I usually love dumb white girl rapping but I hate this song, the production is brutally boring and so is her flow

**SmileAndTears** (0): God I hate this song, it's so obnoxious I can't even enjoy ironically

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Honestly do not think Fergie has done anything that i do not find personally embarrassing

**vintagebathingsuit** (0): the fact that this is nearly five minutes long is a crime against humanity.

The worse Bleachers song in this rate! This song was the fanbase favorite album cut of *Reputation,* endlessly rumored to be a single and eventual smash hit to no prevail. It certainly sounds like a hit, but maybe that's not a good thing? Anyways, this was in the bottom 5 until the flood of ballots on the last few days when it suddenly surged to my disappointment.

---

**jasannn** (11): This song marked the better half of Reputation.

**joeeswift** (11): cindy...this is ART

**wanderingimpromptu3** (11): everything about this song hits, lyrics cleverly chosen, the thrumming energy holds throughout

**1998tweety** (10): this sounds like a hit and that's not a good thing

**akanewasright** (10): This is one of my favorite Taylor songs. It’s also just a wonderful song to perform. Every crowd I’ve played it to has either loved it or gotten mad at me for keeping the gendered pronouns the same.

**bbfan132** (10): the best song on reputation and the best taylor x jackoff song

**bigbigbee** (10): The bridge of this song makes me go feral

**carolcrossing** (10): still waiting for a music video

**hikkaru** (10): robbed of getting a mv

**ignitethephoenix** (10): very glad this Taylor song got in cause if it was any other Taylor song that was on the list, it wouldn’t have got a high score. This really is one of her best songs and it deserves so much better

**InternetDude19** (10): One of the few good things to come out of reputation.

**lapascalia** (10): I just love this song

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm just gonna take this moment to say that I really, really like Reputation. Yes, I probably do have brain worms but that's my opinion!!!! Anyways, I think this might be like the 5th best song on Reputation, if that. Still good nonetheless, but not godly.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the way she and jack wrote that bridge in less than a minute

**rickikardashian** (10): guys… im starting to think the getaway car video might not be happening

**RosaPalms** (10): nearly got my 11. pulp masterpiece for the ages.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the last 60 seconds of this song give me goosebumps every time

**teenage\_meme** (10): THE DRAMA

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is underrated, this album is underrated, Jackoff is your king, this beat is great, the synths are great. Stop pretending you don't like this, you hipsters, and get over it.

**wasian-invasion** (10): The production is just so stereotypically Jack Antonoff but I love it, especially how the prechorus and the last chorus build up

**wavingwolves** (10): the key change really hits all the right places

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): One of my favourite Taylor songs

**camerinian** (9): I really just wish this was a Bleachers song cos I can hear Jack's inflections in Taylor's vocals and can't unhear him singing it instead. Still, any song of this style basically hacks its way directly to a high score for me

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a hit!

**NotWith10000Men** (9): in all the noise of reputation, I always forget about this one

**ReallyCreative** (9): the only thing from reputation worth salvaging, but boy is it worth it

**SmileAndTears** (9): Jack Antonoff can do no wrong

**team\_kockroach** (9): I live for the G minor chord on “Us traitors never win”.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): very good but i do feel like there’s better on reputation

**twat\_brained** (8.7): TAYLOR IN C MAJOR>>>>>>>>>>>

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): Getaway Car is definitely a solid pop song, I enjoy it but I don't have any super strong feelings about it or anything

**bulforster** (8): The verse and prechorus are so overwrought and the bridge is honestly kind of boring but the chorus and outro are stellar.

**seanderlust** (8): I think Reputation gets shit on often by a lot of people (myself included) but boy did it have some high highs.

**skargardin** (8): the chorus really is impeccable

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): I don't see why people say this is better than Delicate, but pop off?

**Stryxen** (7.5): I’m always like “I love taylor but this is so safe” and then play cruel summer

**TiltControls** (7.5): One of the better off of Reputation, but still not as great as some of her other hits. (Killer bridge as always though).

**RVA\_101** (7.2): For an album often reported to be her worst since her debut, this is a pretty strong showing. I'm a sucker for those vocoders again (in the beginning, at least it sounds like a vocoder). As well as those violins/strings. As much as I might like to deny it, this woman is a great songwriter when she wants to be.

**frogaranaman** (7): here's how Cruel Summer can still be a single

**nightjesus** (7): You know, I really love Reputation. I honestly think it’s one of her strongest pop albums. Getaway Car isn’t my favourite on the album but it’s still a decent bop.

**steelstepladder** (7): You got a getaway car. I got a ticket to anywhere.

**Hielord** (6.5): It doesn't stand out that much for me, but it's a nice song for reputation, I guess

**vintagebathingsuit** (6): this is noisy basic bleachers pop, sorry swifties.

**nowqueenofpop** (5.5): Tom’s I <3 T.S. shirt

**fadedblue09** (5): I'm a reputation apologist, but this has soured on me. I realized I prefer the more moodier songs on it (e.g. So It Goes) whenever I play this album. And she has like, a dozen better synthpop songs on 1989 anyways.

**purplechilipepper** (4): I'd rather just listen to bleachers lmao

**gannade** (1): i want to -dun- -dun- GET AWAY (from this song)

**bespectacIed** (0): i love reputation i hate dis song

**cremeebrulee** (0): the original cruel summer 🤡this song is just fine to me? i think taylor has better on rep alone so i'm not super attached to it

**kappyko** (0): I am still unsure how this got the hype. And Cruel Summer is in fact so much better??

**selegend** (0): i don’t like supercut and supercut part 2 is even worse

**SideBTrack8** (0): don't doxx me please

A subgenre-defining ballad whose lyrics have not aged well. This was everywhere back upon release and I think a lot of people in this subreddit have nostalgia for it because they were "not like the other girls" back in 2012. Back when scores first opened, this was the last place song, but it slowly clawed its way up, almost making it into the top half of the rate. Balladphobia lost??

---

**cocosairdep** (11): Song of the decade, and my personal favorite. Everything about this song is beautiful. Just listening to it makes my day.

**Tolk1en** (11): If I had to be sent to a lost island and only bring one song for the rest of mylife, that could be this one

**vayyiqra** (11): I remember the Discourse about this song when it came out and if Lana was serious or trolling, if the lyrics were ~satire or internalized misogyny, and I wasn't sure myself what to think; but now I have decided it is a Classic and a beautiful song.

**1998tweety** (10): lana really cant ever do any wrong huh, this will be robbed tho....

**astrologicalangel** (10): iconic

**bbfan132** (10): the singles on born to die were all excellent and this was probably the best one

**cremeebrulee** (10): THE lana track beautiful entrancing and an 11 contender

**NotWith10000Men** (10): my favorite chorus from her I think

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this makes me wanna put on a long flowing dress and slowly sip wine as i recline upon an ornate sofa and stare at the sunset

**RandomHypnotica** (10): THE Lana song. If you've heard of Lana, you've heard Video Games. It's no surprise this song really got her to the mainstream with all the acclaim it received, it's just gorgeous

**ReallyCreative** (10): you really can't argue with the legacy of this song, it introduced me to the concept of a sad bop way back in college and I've never been the same since.

**RosaPalms** (10): stone classic, I love a lot of her music and the best cuts on Norman Fucking Rockwell barely top this

**steelstepladder** (10): Why does Lana Del Rey even make music anymore? She has one song in her and this is the absolute best version of it

**WaffleWhales** (10): I’ve listened to the Video Games x Super Bass mashup more than the original

**wavingwolves** (10): the way she sings the "is that true?" meeeelts my heart

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i’ve really soured on lana lately but this is undeniably beautiful. a highlight of the BTD era and her discography in general.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): one of my favourite songs from her.

**Stryxen** (9.1): this song sounds so american. the US national anthem.

**SmileAndTears** (9): A classic

**camerinian** (8.5): This song is an important part of my musical DNA whether I like it or not and it's just a shame I'm not 15 anymore lol

**teenage\_meme** (8.5): as gorgeous as ever.

**seanderlust** (8.3): I think I'm biased on this one. Can someone who isn't a depressed bottom review this?

**twat\_brained** (8.3): love it but it's just one in a line of dreary sadgirl ballads which Lana should and has moved on from

**RVA\_101** (8.1): With the dirge style vocals and production I imagine this is what sex in a funeral home feels like.

**lapascalia** (8): Really good but not her best for me

**nightjesus** (8): This is one of the only Lana Del Ray songs I genuinely like. That piano just gets me every time.

**Sundraliz** (8): I hadn't heard this song in a long time, I'd forgotten all the things I love about it.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i only got into this song this year (sue me) but i love the relaxing and peaceful nature of it

**team\_kockroach** (8): Robopop, this song’s producer, also made Maroon 5’s “Payphone” and Little Mix’s “Power”. How could he go from something so awesome to two mediocre songs?

**wasian-invasion** (8): Gay confession: I first listened to this when it popped up on all the best of the decade lists.

**pat-rickstar** (7.5): I'm conflicted on this song because it's really pretty with gorgeous production but I've always found Lana's vocals to be really boring sorry

**patcheso8** (7.5): omg a Lana song I actually kind enjoy??

**anothertown** (6.5): what video game do you think Lana's bf was playing? for the time period and personality i assume he has, probably something like dark souls or bioshock? braid?

**nowqueenofpop** (6.5): the indiecore tumblr of it all

**yourfacesucksass** (6.5): I won't forget hearing this song for the first time when she performed it on American Idol. What a time to be alive lol.

**Hielord** (6): I just never got the hype of this song, I'm sorry.

**Jackalope117** (6): Actually like a lot of Lana songs more than this

**jasannn** (6): I'm not the biggest Lana fan but this song is cute and it feels like I'm in Sleeping Beauty.

**purplechilipepper** (6): this song got be into BtD so I'll always be grateful but yeah it's one of my least favourite songs on the album now

**skargardin** (6): she's got way better stuff than this for sure. As a debut single it remains an iconic introduction but it isn't one of my favorite songs of hers.

**CrimsonROSET** (5): And the winner is... The Ascension, out Sept. 25th. Give it up for The Ascension!

**J\_Toe** (4): I'm gonna be honest, Lana didn't click for me until the stretch of Marina's Apartment Complex - Venice Bitch - Doin' Time. But they're also the only 3 Lana tracks I like.

**plvstvcbvrds** (4): besides the fact that me and elizabeth are not on good terms after her temper tantrum, this was never my favorite song of hers. it's just too dreary and pretentious.

**akanewasright** (3): Lmao this song deserves better but Lana doesn’t.

**frogaranaman** (3): Lana Del Rey makes music for people who have sent the text "sorry that you got hurt" multiple times

**gannade** (3): this sounds like a racist wine aunt that had a little too much and shes trying to seduce her obese husband

**kappyko** (3): boring as fuck compared to the best of BTD

**ManofOranges** (3): I'm gonna be perfectly honest, I do not like a lot of Lana's early stuff. There's nothing to make me interested in the song, I just don't care.

**selegend** (3): kinda boring, i used to stan but it hasn’t stuck as well as the other btd singles

**fadedblue09** (2.5): After rating two of her albums and now this, I can safely say that Lana just isn’t for me. I just don’t see the appeal of her vocal quirks and the fact that I have to endure every song for like an eternity is just….ugh.

**bespectacIed** (1): yeah we don't need a lana redemption arc in any form ever

**brendjac** (0): I really have no comments other than I don’t like it and never have. Love her later stuff but this just doesn’t do it for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): no ma'am.

We won't rate *Future Nostalgia* until early next year so this will have to hold us over until then. The rate this is from (*Dua Lipa vs. Camila vs. So Good vs. All Your Fault Pts. 1 & 2*) is known for two things: being a showdown between "Havana" and "New Rules" that ended with neither winning, and also having its premise almost immediately disproven by Zara Larsson and Bebe Rexha's descents into irrelevancy. I'm not sure how exactly "Be The One" fits into it but I'm guessing we're making up for the fact that we didn't stan Dua quite as viciously back in 2018.

---

**1998tweety** (10): one of her best songs, an AMAZING debut single

**bbfan132** (10): i lowkey like this more than most of the songs on future nostalgia

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ngl one of my favourites from her stills idc if it’s generic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): probably the best on her first album

**ManofOranges** (10): Of all Dua's songs, this is the one that I would've pegged to be the winner in its rate. It's lichrally immaculate, there's nothing quite like it. It's simple, yet complex, it's quiet, but it's loud, it's the moon, but it's the sun. Quite a way to start your career with a song like this coming right out of the gate.

**nightjesus** (10): Dua’s first single was huge here in Australia and for good reason. I’m pretty sure it went to number one on our ARIA charts. Sometimes Australia has taste.

**plastichaxan** (10): dua's second best song yup

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): the way i thought this was her debut single

**rickikardashian** (10): blow your mind winning that rate still doesnt sit too well with me. justice for this and lush life

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): lost in your life deserved but we will stan anyway

**twat\_brained** (10): all I can think about when I hear this is me making a video where it gets faster every time Dua repeats the previous lyric lmao

**vayyiqra** (10): Anthemic. One of her best songs. Future Nostalgia is good, but I love her first album so much.

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this deserved to be as successful in the US as it was internationally. such a fun lil pop bop

**lapascalia** (9.5): This is one of my favourite Dua songs of all time, it’s so dreamy

**hunnybee12** (9): one of my favorite songs to come out of the tropical house trend

**insolentire** (9): This is the best from her debut. Naivete, sence of wonder and lust for life all wraped in a perfect pop song.

**pat-rickstar** (9): Probably my favourite Dua song pre-Future Nostalgia

**skargardin** (9): I remember hearing this song when she had just debuted and they were pushing her as this supermodel who was starting a career in music. She was on my radar bc this song is excellent but the amount of things she's done in such short time is pretty crazy

**SmileAndTears** (9): Lowkey outsold every song on Future Nostalgia except Physical

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): This was her best song before Future Nostalgia, I'll stand by this.

**team\_kockroach** (8.5): There are four different producers for this song, so I don’t know how to praise for the gorgeous production.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): One of Dua's most memorable songs for me cause at her concert she did the whole let the audience sing bit with the bridge

**Hielord** (8): I knew this song before miss Dula Peep was cool.

**selegend** (8): her best song but compared to some of these songs it’s an 8

**Stryxen** (8): why did she have to make this so catchy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this song has summer written all over it

**akanewasright** (7.5): Just a really cute, simple bop.

**J\_Toe** (7): I knew this song for years before I knew who Dua was - whoops.

**RosaPalms** (7): I dig it.

**teenage\_meme** (7): cute song, but i wouldn't listen to it on my own terms

**RVA\_101** (6.9): I'm really enjoying the bassline that's upfront in the mix.

**seanderlust** (6.1): A decent first single from Dula Peep. It's good, but I'm also not surprised that New Rules is the better known track from this album.

**cremeebrulee** (6): this song is fine but sticks out like a sore thumb considering the quality of everything else here

**gannade** (6): i no longer shop at H&M so i no longer have a need for this song

**ReallyCreative** (6): The chorus is angellic to start out with but "I can be the one" followed by 5 seconds of silence... a choice when you have production on the vocals as good as it is here. Everything else about the song is fine, nothing too special. Unfortuatenly in a rate with this much talent, it suffers as a result.

**wavingwolves** (6): i don't know what this song is doing here at all... it's a cute girl between mostly gorgeous girls so...

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): I knew I wasn't wrong in disliking this album

**fadedblue09** (5): Lol I remember coming across this MV back in 2015, thinking she was some sort of obscure synthpop act. Still can't believe this and New Rules were on the same album lmao. Anyway, this is fine, a bit forgettable unfortunately.

**steelstepladder** (5): A similar problem to Alterlife but worse. This is good but after hearing classic after classic it falls up short.

---

The most nominated song for inclusion in this rate. Stanned by both the artsier and more mainstream sides of this community, this is very accessible but also definitively onbrand for Grimes with its odd lyrics and screeched chorus. That sounds like a drag but this is still a 10!

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): i wasn't here for the original rate this was in but grimes is one of my most listened to artists ever so i had to give this my 11. looking at the results and seeing her dominate the top 10 and miss #1 sucks but i have hope considering this was the most voted in entry!

**hunnybee12** (11): absolute banger

**RandomHypnotica** (11): This is THE perfect Grimes song. The lyrics are kinda nonsense but still manage to paint a picture of this mysterious italian mobster vampire, the production is incredibly detailed and rich, and it's just so easy to get lost in

**1998tweety** (10): its chaotic but it surprisingly works

**bbfan132** (10): this song is so fucking epic, i love it

**bespectacIed** (10): imperialist scüm but give credit where credit is due, she did two flawless albums

**bulforster** (10): Who needs coherent lyrics when your production goes this hard?

**ManofOranges** (10): This song just reeks of racing montage music, and I mean that in the best way possible.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): honestly just the premise of the song is a big fat 10

**rickikardashian** (10): the reason grimes’ life has gone down the way it has is because of her having like ⅓ of the top 10 this rate and still losing

**Stryxen** (10): the screams are what make this the best song in this rate - when you declare a state of wWAAARRR

**Sundraliz** (10): Nice one Grimes, thank you.

**vayyiqra** (10): This isn't the best song on Art Angels (I think that would be Realiti, insofar as there can be a best song when almost every song on it is an 11) but it is an undeniable bop. It fucks, it slaps, it bites, it yeets, I'd better stop before I go through every verb in the English language. Song good.

**wanderingimpromptu3** (10): amazing, her voice is just a tiny bit too shrill

**worlds-okayest666** (10): kind of a timeless classic tbh...like genuinely idk if she’ll ever top this. it just slaps SO hard.

**akanewasright** (9): This would be a 10, but I’m trying to not give half the rate a 10

**camerinian** (9): Y’all ever played Crypt of the Necrodancer? This fucking slaps as a custom track

**insolentire** (9): Grimes is best when it comes to making irresistible speed bops. Janelle is close second.

**pat-rickstar** (9): I can't believe Ariana gets dragged so much for her enunciation when this chorus exists, I had to google those lyrics because I had no clue what she was saying. It does slap though

**purplechilipepper** (9): the part where she screams never fails to get me hype and the hooks are fucking killer omg

**steelstepladder** (9): Grimes!

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): Coco Peru voice Why is this woman screaming at me

**anothertown** (8): X, the unknown variable ⚔️ Æ, my elven spelling of Ai (love &/or Artificial intelligence) A-12 = precursor to SR-17 (our favorite aircraft). No weapons, no defenses, just speed. Great in battle, but non-violent (A=Archangel, my favorite song) (⚔️🐁 metal rat)

**frogaranaman** (8): HEY! A LONELY VAPE. ALONE WE VAPE, NO. HEY. A LONELY VAPE. ALONE WE VAPE, NO.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the only good grimes song.

**lapascalia** (8): So this was my first time listening to this song (I know), and I’m not exactly sure how I feel about it, but I think I like it!

**skargardin** (8): boppy

**twat\_brained** (8): go off miss sugar baby weirdo with a kid who will cost you millions in therapy bills

**seanderlust** (7.7): I mean this as a compliment, but this song sounds like an all-female Alvin and the Chipmunks is trying to kill me.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): This is so chaotic

**patcheso8** (7): this actually wasn't horrible

**yourfacesucksass** (7): I don't remember how I found this years ago, but I think it still holds up

**RVA\_101** (6.3): Her erratic vocals are disorienting. I love it. This is like a twisted take on bubblegum EDM pop. God knows I'd get strange looks in the car playing this though.

**nightjesus** (6): I see the appeal. But damn this would be a hard song to sing.

**wavingwolves** (6): she has way better songs

**CrimsonROSET** (5.5): This sounds like a fake J-Pop song.

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): she sounds childish…...

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): this is my first time listening to a Grimes song and it's just not for me. giving it a 5 bc at least the beat is catchy and fun

**wasian-invasion** (5): no grimes that's not what I meant by fuck elon musk

**team\_kockroach** (3): This is not even close to Oblivion’s quality.

**RosaPalms** (2): as the world burns and Grimes prepares to become the queen mother of a society of billionaire escapees on Mars, surely we can finally admit that this song was always vapid noise, trash, plus the only parts of this that aren’t cringey bullshit are just “Since U Been Gone”

**TiltControls** (2): this is weird cause I like most of Art Angels, but this song stresses me out too much

**fadedblue09** (1): St. Vincent and FKA Twigs were up against….this mess? Sorry, but this was just awful, irritating and...kinda basic? For a song coming from an art pop album, I expected so much better. At least Two Weeks won in the end, so I guess there's still some hope for humanity.

**Jackalope117** (1): I always knew I didn't like Grimes but this proves beyond a reasonable

**selegend** (1): really bad and overrated

**ignitethephoenix** (0): when perfectly good production gets ruined by Grimes voice <<< It’s even more annoying cause their are moments where she does sing normally (like the bridge) which I like but then she has to do all the dumb pitching effects and screaming

**WiiFightTrainer** (0): don't kill me but i don't get grimes

This was the highest rated song up for inclusion in this rate, although that's mostly because the rate it's from (*Madonna vs. Whitney Houston vs. She's So Unusual vs. Forever Your Girl*) had fairly low participation. I think it's pretty overrated like the rest of Cyndi's music: there's a decent hook here but I really dislike her vocals and the production is not as vibrant as I'd like from a song from the 80s.

---

**bbfan132** (10): this was my 11 in its first rate and i hope it at least makes it to the top 15 this time…

**fadedblue09** (10): Oh hey it's another of my voted songs! Truly a timeless, transcendent tune. Wish I discovered rates sooner so I could've given this an 11.

**InternetDude19** (10): Ugh, a classic.

**ManofOranges** (10): Just a really great song, point blank, period.

**nightjesus** (10): THIS SONG BETTER ONLY HAVE 10’S AND 11’S AND WHO EVER RATES IT LOWER IS DEAD TO ME. Seriously this is Cyndi’s best song. It has so much emotion. Such simple instruments. The magical is all in her voice and her delivery. My favourite 80’s queen.

**RosaPalms** (10): absolute stone classic. maybe so perfect it’s boring?

**RVA\_101** (10): This was another 11 contender of mine, but gave it to another song ultimately. Didn't have to listen to it again to remind myself it's an 11 but listened to it again anyway because it's so good. This is honestly one of her best songs in general. One of those voices of the 80s that you can just easily recognize due to its standout quality, especially in the chorus. To hell with Girls Want to Have Fun, this is the best song on the album.

**TiltControls** (10): Classic song that had the misfortune to be paired against one of the biggest juggernauts in popheads history

**WiiFightTrainer** (10): Another classic song

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): A MOTHERFUCKING CLASSIC

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): oooh I can feel the tears welling uppp

**yourfacesucksass** (9.5): Classssic, atmospheric, the deep synths. Cyndiii!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): This is the musical equivalent of nostalgia. Everytime I hear this, I just have happy memories abou the past.

**Hielord** (9): Timeless song

**J\_Toe** (9): the Napoleon Dynamite jumped out. Or idk, something funny. Will anyone even read this?

**lapascalia** (9): An actual classic, and it never gets old for me.

**ReallyCreative** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L55VHa3-jC4

**selegend** (9): legend

**steelstepladder** (9): Ballads are born to get destroyed but I hope this does well

**wavingwolves** (9): i'm actually so happy that this was chosen for this

**plastichaxan** (8.7): time(less classic) after time(less classic) yup

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is of course iconic but her vocals knock it down a bit

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Cyndi does raspy, shaky vocals so much better than any other 80s icons. I'm looking at you Kim.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): also a classic

**Tolk1en** (8): iconic, deserves redemption.

**vayyiqra** (8): a classic for sure let's hope it survives popheads' routine balladophobia

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): god there are so fucking many good songs in this rate this is impossible, me giving it a 7.5 means nothing because i've given 90% of the songs that or higher but i just can't go any lower

**seanderlust** (7.5): It's a little hard to peel this song away from its place in the pop culture zeitgeist, but once you do...it's good. Just good.

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): The chorus is an overplayed letdown, but the verses are more gorgeous than I’ve expected.

**awhile2** (7): incredibly corny but still good

**gannade** (7): a classique but its kinda eh

**cashewconstellation** (6.8): I honestly think this song is boring

**skargardin** (6): a classic for sure but this has never really done anything for me

**worlds-okayest666** (6): i dont like this that much but also i kinda do? idk its very cheesy

**brendjac** (5): Cyndi has so many better bops...

**NotWith10000Men** (5): ehhhh cyndi doesn't bring a whole lot to the table

**nowqueenofpop** (4): A great example of a song that would be better sung by someone else

**SweatpantsLesbian** (4): Most overplayed song in radio history

**anothertown** (3): bleh

**hikkaru** (3): boring lol

**valyse** (0): I can't imagine thinking this song could possibly be in need of redemption...

Paramore always does well in rates and this was not an exception. "Misery Business" feels like the song that needs more redemption but I suppose this song needs a chance to shine outside of the shadow of "Hard Times."

---

**Awkward\_King** (11): one of my favourite songs of all time it means so much to me ahah

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (11): this is my favourite song of all-time, if it doesn’t do well popheads is confirmed tasteless

**bbfan132** (10): i adore the video for this song, as well as the live performance of it on the late show

**twat\_brained** (10): One of my top 3 songs on After Laughter and somewhere in my top 50 of 2017

**vayyiqra** (10): LOWKEY! NO PRESSURE! :kimbryell: What a fun, cute song.

**wavingwolves** (10): will this ever not be extremely relevant?

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this song makes me go :))) but it really, really shouldn’t

**Stryxen** (9.5): after laughter good :) but my friends say after laughter bad :( also why is this not Pool ??

**plastichaxan** (9.4): i don't trust anyone who doesn't like this era of paramore

**ImADudeDuh** (9): kinda a shrinker but still a bop

**lapascalia** (9): Wow had never heard this song before, love it!

**ReallyCreative** (9): I love the slight unhinging of Hayley's vocals on this song and the video is amazing, one of my absolute favorites

**team\_kockroach** (9): Suffers from a weak pre-chorus, but is otherwise perfect. The silly guitar’s awesome, the lyrics are awesome, and Hayley’s energy is everything.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): Hard Times outsold.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): I like this more than I remembered

**seanderlust** (8.3): "I want you to stop insisting that I'm not a lost cause" WHOO this line.

**CarlieScion** (8): hey its that rate i hosted

**nowqueenofpop** (7.5): omg I forgot how fun this song and mv is!

**RVA\_101** (7.4): Love the 'hang with me and my weather' chant. Also love the bouncy bassline and wave of guitars. Also, wasn't this band known for a wildly different sound than this poppier one I'm hearing on this track? Or am I misremembering. Could have remembered Hayley and Co. being a lot more rockier than this. But hell, if their pop is this well executed then I don't mind that switch up.

**1998tweety** (7): this is kind of overrated ngl, still decent tho

**anothertown** (7): referring to men as “boys” is a pet peeve

**awhile2** (7): there were like 10 paramore singles to choose from and at least 7 of them were better than this but w/e

**J\_Toe** (6): I have so few thoughts on Paramore but several girls I did Uni with were obsessed with this band, and Hayley in particular. But idk, they're just not for me :(

**RosaPalms** (6): it’s fine

**skargardin** (6): Insanely confused as to how this got in this rate? Is it really that loved?

**steelstepladder** (6): Wow this feels harsh. I like it but this rate is just too strong to not judge on a harsh curve and I don't really want to see this last that long.

**fadedblue09** (2): Of course the blandest song on After Laughter (besides maybe Fake Happy) had to be the r/popheads pick.

**nightjesus** (2): Unpopular opinion but the beginning and verse is really familiar to Hard Times. I didn’t really like After Laughter as a whole as well.

**gannade** (1): i thought taylor swift made white people music but this was truly so so bland

I've always felt this song was slightly overrated, it has some great pop songwriting but I don't think it has the over-the-top quality that makes Gaga shine. I was surprised when compiling the eligible songs that this had only been rated once because of how overdone this era of pop (and the Gaga singles from around then in particular) have been in previous rates. Surprisingly, this did not live up to the high expectations set by previous Gaga singles in grab bag rates and is the final cut before the top 10. This is a surprisingly tasteful spot for it imo.

[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4d7z93/]

=====

TragicKingdom1: **J\_Toe** (11): the most 11est song to ever exist. My favourite song ever. It's a representation of intrusive thoughts in social settings, told in a way accessible to the public as a dancefloor anthem. Plus, I frequently listen to Gaga Bey Britney fan edits.

**1998tweety** (10): where is part 2 we fucking want it, queens snapped so hard

**anothertown** (10): some may say that the song is not as good without the video, but those people are weak and wrong

**bbfan132** (10): easily my favorite lady gaga song, the production goes hard and beyonce’s part is great as well

**bespectacIed** (10): something shifted

**bigbigbee** (10): That harp intro <3

**cocosairdep** (10): Iconic song, iconic collab, iconic music video, iconic choreography, iconic looks. Still waiting for the sequel of the video btw.

**cremeebrulee** (10): giving this a 10 because it's a perfect song BUT i hope it doesn't pull a Bad Romance 2

**CritneySpearz** (10): iconic, video phone who?

**frogaranaman** (10): these fuckers at the end of the music video promised to never come back then fucking did I hate them

**Hielord** (10): Queens of telecommunication

**ignitethephoenix** (10): still waiting for telephone part 2

**kappyko** (10): we probably should have had some sort of album rule because i just fucking know this is gonna win. that said this is her best song

**ManofOranges** (10): Literally so iconic. I remember being so mad when this song came out because I foolishly used my actual birthday for my Youtube account and because of that I wasn't able to watch the Youtube video for this song because I wasn't old enough. It took me a while to realize that I could just make a new account, but once I did, watching the video and listening to the song was literally transcendent for me.

**nootnoot781** (10): my soul leaves my body when beyoncé comes in

**nowqueenofpop** (10): It's actually against the law to give this anything lower than a 8. I know every basic pop stan loves this song but you know what? A song can be overrated AND be outstanding! But I will never forget that they said “To be continued…” it was all a lie, guys, it was all a lie, she LIED

**pat-rickstar** (10): Truly iconic, the phrase "cultural reset" is overused but this song and music video really was one

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): This song could k*ll my whole family and I'd say thank you or whatever the kids are saying on stan twitter these days. She gives us vocals, she gave us choreo, and best of all, she gave us 'this is a disastuh'

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): give us the sequel miss gaga, we demand it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Gaga still owes us the conclusion to this story and I won't let myself die until she gives it to us

**ReallyCreative** (10): One of the most iconic collaborations ever, from the video to the song itself.

**rickikardashian** (10): they dont do bops like this anymore. this is the pinnacle of stan culture, nothing else will top it

**Sundraliz** (10): What a song. I wish I could feel what I felt again the first time I heard this song or saw the music video. Ladies please make videos like this again.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this MV scarred me as a 14 year old but ICONIC

**teenage\_meme** (10): to me, this is a perfect pop song. simple but layered and exciting production; hooks galore; two amazing singers. i know it's one of the more "basic" songs on TFM, but that's what makes it such a classic. forever obsessed with this one.

**wavingwolves** (10): still waiting for that sequel

**worlds-okayest666** (10): I really hope we don’t have another Gaga win bc that would be such a non-event, but GOD this is so good. collab of the century, mayhaps?

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): one of the best and most iconic songs of all time

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): In middle school I always deleted my internet history after watching this in fear of being outed as a basic gay bitch

**lapascalia** (9): Even though something about this song kind of stresses me out (which might be the point), it’s an iconic collab for the ages.

**skargardin** (9): banger

**Tolk1en** (9): iconic collab, amazing vocals and production. Maybe just abit too repetitive

**twat\_brained** (9): I will not be forgiven for this but it's not a 10 for me anymore it just isn't as great as I remember

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (8.5): this was such an EVENT back then, it does sound a bit dated to me now tho

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): It's amazing and iconic but a tad bit overproduced

**yourfacesucksass** (8.5): I don't get the hate for this song. The lyrics are the epitome of a club song, and I like the phone motif down to the outro. It matches the content of the song.

**Stryxen** (8): I give this an e-e-e-e-e-e-ight

**joeeswift** (7): we need pt2

**steelstepladder** (7): The video overshadows the song and lowkey rightfully so

**TiltControls** (7): I know it's technically iconic but I really have no attachment to this song besides recognizing it's pretty good.

**WaffleWhales** (7): early 2010’s pop is a bit lost on me

**WiiFightTrainer** (7): somewhat overrated, but good nonetheless

**RVA\_101** (6.4): Middle school memories shining through here lol. I already remembered the chorus before relistening for the review so that's a good start. The distorted synths and vocal effects are kind of annoying after a while and it definitely sounds like a product of its time but still enjoyable nonetheless. Love whenever Beyonce does that forceful aggressive singing that makes her voice all gravelly ('should have left my PHONE at home')

**seanderlust** (6.4): It's good, but I also don't know anyone whose favorite Gaga song is Telephone.

**brendjac** (6): Y’all we need to be honest with ourselves: it wasn’t all that.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its ok but will be a very boring winner

**insolentire** (6): I loved it, but it didn't age well. Half of other Monster tracks are better

**NotWith10000Men** (6): production on this didn't age that well, sounds very busy and fuzzy

**nightjesus** (5): So I never really loved the song itself. I actually love the video clip for it. I mean the Pussy Wagon is iconic.

**akanewasright** (4): I overplayed this HARD

**gannade** (4): beyonce's 20 seconds is a serve but not sure about the rest so I will average it out

**RosaPalms** (4): overrated, aggressively mid cut for both artists at best. video was a lot of fun tho.

**team\_kockroach** (4): Damn, this aged poorly. The effects on Gaga’s voice and Beyonce’s verse feel particularly bad. I like the chorus, though.

**selegend** (3): it needed more beyonce.. like a lot more beyonce

**camerinian** (2): Look I swear I'm not intentionally tanking potentially another winner by Gaga, I love the Fame Monster as much as anyone, but this has always been the lowlight for me. The first chunk of the chorus and the core piano line are well done melodically and really sticky, sure, I'll give it that, but it's based around a stupid, thin, one-dimensional conceit that is not developed at all within the song, the stuttered post-chorus is on the side of annoying that Gaga is normally really good at avoiding, the drop into Beyonce's really forceful verse has always felt cringe and out of place, and the vocal line on the "out in the club" section is genuinely ear-grating. I really feel like this song has coasted its entire life off of goodwill from Bad Romance, when it's not even remotely as well crafted or deserving of that praise.

**fadedblue09** (1): Lol Gaga stans were desperate enough to get her in the rate, they even voted one of her most mediocre singles. Sorry sis, you have no business being in a stacked AF field.

**vayyiqra** (1): MAH-MAH-MAH TELEPHONE Yeah this is a bop but it's also overrated and the line "sippin' that bub" irrationally annoys me. I'm very over this song and never want to hear it again. Beyonce ate on her verse though.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): And you all rack on Born This Way. Bey really should've left her phone at home.

Jesus christ, y'all just can't get enough of the 2018 NPR Core rate. It had three songs from it voted into the All Stars 3 rate and now another here. Anyways, this is the standout album closer from *Dirty Computer* and it's just as epic 2 years later. I'm glad the album seems to have held its spot as a Popheads favorite despite Janelle not having the cult of personality surrounding her that some other artists have.

---

**1998tweety** (10): complete excellence, the thesis and best song on DC periodt

**agentofscranton** (10): had a very awful vision of if glee was still around today that they'd do a very on the nose political episode where this was performed by rachel at the end of the ep with santana and mercedes as just backup singers

**bbfan132** (10): janelle did that

**bigbigbee** (10): The end of this song made me inexplicably teary on a walk one day. At times cynical, at times inspirational, with a killer melody, harmonization, and beat – it’s very unique among songs I typically listen to

**frogaranaman** (10): I hate y'all for not making this win initially

**ImADudeDuh** (10): god i fucking love this song. such a great album closer.

**ManofOranges** (10): Mmm very, very good.

**nootnoot781** (10): i hope americans make this their national anthem within my lifetime

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): this is the new national anthem, i don't make the rules

**ReallyCreative** (10): FUN FACT: Olive Garden's Endless Pasta special was inspired by Janelle Monae's Endless Talent.

**skargardin** (10): WE STAN

**steelstepladder** (10): PERFECT

**Stryxen** (10): everyone rights!!!!! I love this so much it’s so uplifting

**TiltControls** (10): political bop!

**twat\_brained** (10): if Janelle Monae of all people can make being American sound as glorious as this then maybe I can renege on my contempt of it. Maybe

**worlds-okayest666** (10): this is a great song already but in the context of the album/film, it’s even better. just...chef’s kiss.

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): A jam.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): still relevant until the end of time probably

**cocosairdep** (9): Ok... I’m embarrassed to admit I’d never heard any Janelle Monáe before this rate. This song is amazing though, and made me curious. I guess I’ll have to give Dirty Computer a try.

**wasian-invasion** (9): Works really well as the album closer

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Really good lyrics

**seanderlust** (8.3): This feels so much like it's from a musical that Janelle should have won a Tony for it.

**anothertown** (8): rip this is such a prince instrumental

**SmileAndTears** (8): The speeches in the middle kinda ruin the flow of the song but apart from that it's good

**vayyiqra** (8): I wish another song from this album had been picked because this one isn't my fave (that would be Screwed/Django Jane) but it's still good and the lyrics are topical as ever.

**fadedblue09** (7.6): It’s a fun, uplifting bop, though I'm quite ambivalent to how the message was executed (I can say the same for many other DC songs). Then again, I'm not American, so maybe it works for some people?

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): Too much like a commercial/movie soundtrack, but it sums up the musical themes of Dirty Computer really well. The drums hold it back.

**RVA\_101** (7.2): A political statement can sound either sincere or forced, but this one is seamless and doesn't necessarily hammer the message to death.

**awhile2** (7): smh how was this voted in but no prince

**nightjesus** (7): Queen mod Janelle delivering us the goods with that Prince influence. These lyrics are also giving me life. Holy shit this is the America I want.

**wavingwolves** (7): i'm not american but this bangs still

**plastichaxan** (6.7): not the best dirty computer song honestly

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): groovy

**insolentire** (5): Worthy closer, but DC has much stronger tracks.

**Tolk1en** (5): There's this nice message and meaningful lyrics but overall I can't get into this song

**RosaPalms** (4): I hate this song because of its reference to “poor whites” at the end, as if poverty doesn’t disproportionately affect every race of American more than whites. I wish they would have said “Appalachians” or “farmers” or some identifiable subgroup instead. it literally kills the song, I can’t do it. Too cringe. Still love u

**wanderingimpromptu3** (3): well produced, kinda heavy handed lyrically

**valyse** (1): I love Janelle, but this song is cheesy from lyrics to production.

The only song from a mixed-artist grab bag (so not counting grab bag rates with singles from a handful of artists) to get voted into this rate. I'm glad it's getting its due because it's one of the most memorable songs of the 90s to me; I'm surprised it's not being included in the VH1 Top 100 Songs of the 90s rate next month.

---

**patcheso8** (11): amazing

**1998tweety** (10): iconic bop

**bbfan132** (10): it’s a one-hit wonder but erase/rewind and my favourite game are just as good as this, if not better… stream their other albums/songs!!!

**bulforster** (10): A perfect song.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): pop perfection. If this isn’t top 5 (minimum top 10) cancel popheads

**ManofOranges** (10): I would've loved to see this win the One Hit Wonderland rate, simply because I think we could all see Take On Me winning from a mile away and it kinda would've been interesting to see if it had lost to an equally deserving, but less expected winner. Obviously that didn't happen, and I definitely don't see this song winning this rate either, but that won't stop me from paying it its due diligence.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): It is pop perfection. Do they have better songs? No. They might think they do, and they are wrong.

**rickikardashian** (10): this is another song that as a member of the lgbt community, ive decided to reclaim. this level of sweetness and utter desperation for approval cant be reached by a straight person

**RosaPalms** (10): nuclear hook

**skargardin** (10): the ONLY version of this song that exists in my mind

**steelstepladder** (10): Actual pop perfection?

**teenage\_meme** (10): a classic childhood song for me. so lovely and breezy, reminds me of chillin in the backseat, singing along. so sweet.

**twat\_brained** (10): I regret not doing the OHW rate because I would've given this my 11

**wavingwolves** (10): t i m e l e s s

**WiiFightTrainer** (10): Classic song

**plastichaxan** (9.8): definition of a timeless classic

**gannade** (9.5): a classique

**Hielord** (9.5): Yes baby, I'm your fool, just make me yours

**cocosairdep** (9.2): This song still sounds fresh to this day.

**akanewasright** (9): This is a perfect pop song.

**astrologicalangel** (9): I love how sugary sweet this song is, especially when the lyrics are so sad

**frogaranaman** (9): iconic bop

**lapascalia** (9): It’s a classic, what can I say.

**ReallyCreative** (9): there's so much going on with this song but it's all so good, a lowkey blueprint for a lot of indie pop I think

**SmileAndTears** (9): Once again, a classic

**team\_kockroach** (9): Twenty-four years later, the chorus hasn't aged a day.

**worlds-okayest666** (9): ahhh that’s history. also i unironically love the vocaloid cover of this

**CrimsonROSET** (8): While this was robbed, nothing was winning over Take on Me.

**nootnoot781** (8): in the mood to annoy millennials so… i only know this song because of tiktok. it’s catchy as hell though

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): a classic

**vayyiqra** (8): A classic bop. I love 90s pop.

**yourfacesucksass** (8): Man the 90s was really the time of the female-led alternative bands. It's funny since Gwen's Make Me Like You sounds like a soft-sample of this song.

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): Like I get this song is supposed to sound desperate, but idk that doesn't really make it more enjoyable to listen to

**seanderlust** (7.3): You can draw a straight line from this song to Mitski's "Nobody."

**insolentire** (7): Iconic in its catchiness and dorkyness.

**awhile2** (6): i prefer The Cardigans - TaylorSwift

**selegend** (6): i wish i liked it more

**nightjesus** (4): I never liked this song as a kid and I’m still not there as a grown ass adult.

**nowqueenofpop** (3): I have NEVER in my life yelled at a girl like this… I actually have never ever given a score this low in a rate and I generally don’t like to give scores below 5 but I already disliked this song and after hearing it at work every 45 minutes? Good luck to Lovefool

**NotWith10000Men** (2): ew I don't like this at all

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Sorry but I just really hate this. These one-hit wonders just fall between the endearing and irritating with no middle ground.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (1): i don't care about this song and i do not believe i should

Amy Winehouse has won two previous rates with songs from her album *Back to Black,* and this is hoping to be the third. Unfortunately I think it's one of the weaker songs in the rate, not that it's bad, but it doesn't really go anywhere imo. Amy doesn't really get her due as an icon on this subreddit all the time though so I'm not upset by this inclusion. This was actually planted in the top 5 for the first 50 or so ballots and I was looking forward to an arc of it outlasting songs like Your Type, Supercut and Gimme More in a grand upset but that didn't end up fully panning out.

---

**RVA\_101** (11): That this album didn't win AOTY is one of many of the Grammys' stumbles, this is the greatest British soul album since Dusty in Memphis (21 is a great but distant second place to me, this record is easily a monumental achievement). There are certain albums where the throwback sound is well executed but somewhat cliched and derivative (24K Magic is a prime example), and then there are albums where it is well executed and a fresh take on the genre it pays homage to. And Back in Black is that album. This song in particular sounds like a clever take on Stax/Memphis soul with its horns. Great drumming, and fucking hell the bassline. Hats off to Amy and Mark Ronson, and I hope she at least realized her worth before she died as it seemed everyone really piled it on her towards the end.

**bbfan132** (10): amy winehouse was extremely talented, i wish we could’ve heard more from her :(

**bespectacIed** (10): ten like the rest of B2B

**hunnybee12** (10): one of my least favorite tracks off back to black and still a 10

**ignitethephoenix** (10): queen

**J\_Toe** (10): Remember that time an interviewer asked Amy if she was a sex symbol, and she answered "Only to the gays"?

**RosaPalms** (10): “I cheated myself, like I knew I would” RIP Amy. Sentimentality aside, I’d have given this a 10 in 2007. It really is so good. “you shrug, and it’s the worst / who truly stuck the knife in first?” is a delicious twist. The only thing worse than a partner cheating is your partner not giving a shit about your cheating

**Stryxen** (10): I know this song is SO good

**twat\_brained** (10): we miss you queen

**wavingwolves** (10): amy is very much missed yes this is one of the most gorgeously written songs i know

**cocosairdep** (9.5): Such a great song. One of Amy’s best imo.

**camerinian** (9): Imagine not liking Back to Black. What would that say about you

**skargardin** (9): queen

**Tolk1en** (9): Who is cutting onions ?

**seanderlust** (8.9): Leave it to Amy to write a song from the perspective of a cheating partner and have it be kind of charming.

**yourfacesucksass** (8.7): My favorite song of hers.

**1998tweety** (8.5): why do i know this song from the rayman raving rabbids video game

**akanewasright** (8.5): Man, this album was perfect.

**lapascalia** (8.5): What a beautiful voice she had

**frogaranaman** (8): god her voice is godly

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's not my favorite Amy song but it's still oozing with talent and taste

**steelstepladder** (8): I do like other Amy songs like Back to Black better but this is still good

**anothertown** (7.5): I don’t like Amy songs that have too much instrumentation filling up the space, but I get why people like this

**bulforster** (7.5): I wish there was a bridge or some other development, I start getting a bit bored by the end.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I prefer Valerie, but Amy's talents can't be undermined.

**SmileAndTears** (7): This felt like one giant verse

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): sounds exactly like what I'd expect an amy winehouse song I've never heard would sound like

**nightjesus** (6): Amy Winehouse is a talent that I really miss. Her music isn’t exactly my taste but her talent was raw and I miss the love people had for her music. She was such a phenomenon.

**teenage\_meme** (6): i'm sorry!!!! i just don't like this old-timey style!!!!

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Is this supposed to be one of the album standouts? A little clunky tbh.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): love her voice but the songs not for me

**vayyiqra** (5): Yeah I never cared much for Amy just not my style.

**team\_kockroach** (4): I’ve never understood Amy’s weird enunciations, or how the production is so droning (even during the chorus). But I like how the lyrics tell a story.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): can't we just let amy winehouse rest in peace

*Sawayama* is one of the sub's favorite albums of the year so far, so Rina is naturally attracting a lot of new fans to her previous EP. We actually already rated it back in 2018 with "Cyber Stockholm Syndrome" winning, but I'm glad she gets another chance to do well in a rate (considering she won't be appearing in any grab bags based on commercial success.)

---

**1998tweety** (11): oh WOW this song is so damn good, lowkey deserves to win. that key change oh my lorde, the energy in the song I LOVE it

**plastichaxan** (11): this isn't close to being my favorite Rina song but giving it my 11 feels more right than any other song in this rate

**agentofscranton** (10): idk what was wrong with me when i did the original rate but this high key deserved to win

**awhile2** (10): i like SAWAYAMA but nothing on it is as good as this or Ordinary Superstar

**Awkward\_King** (10): i just love it so much, please dont be out early lol

**bbfan132** (10): a behemoth of a song, definitely my favorite from rina!

**bespectacIed** (10): listening to RINA three years ago was legitimately life changing. Like, I never knew "pure pop" (banned) was possible to be this innovative and creative

**frogaranaman** (10): icon

**nootnoot781** (10): DID SOMEBODY ORDER POP PERFECTION? i cannot believe i slept on this for so long

**pat-rickstar** (10): God, discovering Rina's music was easily the best thing that has happened to me in this awful year, she really never misses.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): "Rise and Redefine" is such a great lyric ugh

**ReallyCreative** (10): THIS IS MY alterlifealterLIFE YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO alterlifealterLIFE beep WHY ARE YOU SO SCARED OF FALLING??!?!??!?!?!?!

**skargardin** (10): the guitar riff, the keychange, yup, this song has got it all

**Stryxen** (10): this is easily one of my favourite songs in the rate and if it’s even slightly robbed I will scream. no, I didn’t vote for it.

**Sundraliz** (10): I love Rina Sawayama's voice

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this is really just The Best of Both Worlds but more artsy when you think about it

**twat\_brained** (10): Britney would be proud

**WaffleWhales** (10): I thought it was “Afterlife”

**wavingwolves** (10): rina bringing guitars back to pop yas we want more of it

**astrologicalangel** (9): I guess at this point I have no choice but to stan

**bigbigbee** (9): As with any good nostalgia track, makes me want to dress like 2003 Kwon Boa. I think she’s made better in this vein, but this is exactly my kind of song.

**hikkaru** (9): take me as i am was my rina song of choice but i will accept this banger

**lapascalia** (9): Love this! I haven’t had the chance to listen to her EP yet, but this sounds like it could have fit right in on SAWAYAMA.

**nightjesus** (9): Rina brought back the 90’s and rose it to another level with Alterlife.

**rickikardashian** (9): i gave this a low ass score on its original rate….. what is wrong with me? this is amazing

**RosaPalms** (9): In hindsight, this feels so obvious, like of course we needed the sonic pallet of nu-metal in an unabashedly pop package. This is the kind of music I always wanted Amy Lee to make

**worlds-okayest666** (9): she’s an icon, she’s a legend, and she IS the moment, i mean c’mon now. Rina and guitars are a match made in heaven

**yourfacesucksass** (9): God I haven't heard ONE bad song from her

**anothertown** (8.5): Cruisn the World for N64 (Clarence Clarity Remix) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dnBt5x4ZeW4

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): why is she so good I continue to stan. Her music is such a breathe of fresh air

**CrimsonROSET** (8.3): Oooh, those guitars.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.3): first Rina song i've listened to and wow this goes off??? i get the hype

**NotWith10000Men** (8): okay rina's latest album just moved way up on my "to listen to" list

**nowqueenofpop** (8): These type of songs very quickly turn into after school specials about not caving to peer pressure or being yourself and following your dreams or whatever and we’re so glad Alterlife didn’t do that. Rina rock legend

**selegend** (8): i love it but it’s a little corny lyrically

**vayyiqra** (8): Rina good and this is like music from an edgy cyberpunk anime from the 2000s which was no doubt intentional.

**wasian-invasion** (8): Yeah I listen to ROCK I'm not like other girlz

**RVA\_101** (7.8): Digging the production, a mix between those distorted rock guitars and cutting edge synthpop. And a guitar solo? Yes please. The key change is a little cliche I'll admit but I'll let it slide because the song is really good, and because it surprisingly descends back to the original key as it rides out. For hearing all the people on this sub rave about her I definitely say the impressions from this particular track is worthy of that.

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): This is a good song but I just can't fully get into it I don't know why

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): Love Rina.

**seanderlust** (7.2): "Don't stop for any red-blue light" RINA SAID FUCK BLUE LIVES

**Hielord** (6.8): I thought my printer was dying at the start.

**cremeebrulee** (6): not my fave off RINA honestly kinda confused why its here

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i love Rina but i never cared for this all that much. Take Me As I Am was robbed tbh

**steelstepladder** (6): I really love Rina Sawayama but this just does not hold up to the rest of the songs in the rate

**fadedblue09** (5.9): A little boring, but at least she has a nice voice.

**cocosairdep** (5.8): I like her voice a lot, but the production is too loud and busy imo.

**kappyko** (5): still the worst on the EP!

This is the kind of show stopper that I've always imagined Rihanna closing a Super Bowl performance with. The production feels timeless and I think if we redid the 2016 Ultimate rate these days it would score much higher with a few years' distance from it being a hit. That being said, it has been outlasted once again by "Freedom," so maybe things wouldn't be too different.

---

**team\_kockroach** (11): Forget Disturbia - this is Rihanna’s best song. From that 6/8 doowop groove, to Rihanna’s range, to the beautiful backup vocals, everything is perfect. Shame that the rest of ANTI couldn’t be this good.

**1998tweety** (10): turns out rih can sing oh wow

**astrologicalangel** (10): instant classic from the moment it came out

**bbfan132** (10): her vocals here… she nailed it

**bespectacIed** (10): rihmember when she did music

**cocosairdep** (10): One of Rihanna’s best songs, and her best vocal performance for sure. Her voice is so unique and perfect. The doo-wop instrumental is so good, too.

**fadedblue09** (10): One of the 4 songs I voted that actually got here lol. Not really my favorite song, but ANTI is one of my personal favorite pop albums of the decade and I'll take every opportunity to show my love for it.

**gannade** (10): do i like this song? yes.

**Hielord** (10): You fucked me so good that I almost give you my 11.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): why didn't this get a music video i'm fucking fumin

**patcheso8** (10): one of her best

**rickikardashian** (10): i never could have imagined that the makeup woman would be able to replace Stay as the song in her catalogue that people on The Voice would always sing, but she surprised us once more

**RosaPalms** (10): I’d be scared to put out new music if I knew it’d have to measure up to this, too

**RVA\_101** (10): I'll admit, it was between this and another track to get my 11. The other track edged it out ever so slightly. Her vocal performance is unparalleled here and reminds me why Anti is her best project to date. Throw in the doo-wop style backing vocals, reverb and tremolo soaked guitars and ye. Not much to be said here. This didn't win a rate and wasn't nominated for a Grammy? 'Robbed' is an apt description then.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): who would've thought 2005 rihanna could've pulled off a song like this

**TiltControls** (10): One of Rihanna's most heartfelt vocal performances and among the best songs of her career!

**lapascalia** (9.5): I always remember her singing at the Billboard Music Awards in 2016 when I hear this song, she blew me away with that performance.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): I can't hear this song without think of my drinking buddy

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): Rihanna's voice when she goes soulful is such an event

**CrimsonROSET** (9.2): MVP of this entire fucking rate goes to those strings.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): the raw vocals here, a historic moment for Rihanna (also please drop some music)

**jasannn** (9): Her vocals are everything.

**selegend** (9): former musician rihanna made many points here

**SmileAndTears** (9): Another classic

**Sundraliz** (9): Rihanna just release ANTI again and call it a day, it's good enough for the Skyrim treatment.

**wasian-invasion** (9): God I can't believe this is Rihanna's most recent solo single. If she does end up being a full-time beauty guru, I'm glad she left us on this note

**worlds-okayest666** (9): tbh there’s songs from Anti i like a lot more than this but don’t get me wrong; this is still REALLY good

**seanderlust** (8.9): "Oh, and baby I'm fist fighting with fire just to get close to you." That's it. That's the summary.

**akanewasright** (8.5): I really wanted to give this a 10, but I have to be meaner to everything than I would be normally. This song probably isn’t as good as Freedom, for example, even though I really do love it.

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Is there someone else singing on this song that’s uncredited because some parts really don’t sound like Rihanna at all

**Stryxen** (8.5): yes!!!!!!!!! absolutely!!!!

**IDontWorkHereAtAll** (8): Must be worms on the brain

**ManofOranges** (8): There are parts of this song that I like, there really are. I just hate to say it, but I don't really like Rihanna's high voice (falsetto, I guess?), something about it just doesn't sound right to me. The rest of the song I think is by and large fine though.

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): this song captures what it's like to drink henny after a bad breakup and maybe puke on the side patio of an outdoor bar in a beach town while some old man holds your purse and tries to use your phone to call your friends but he doesn't understand the emojis you use to signify your bffls from regular friends

**skargardin** (8): c'mon vocals

**wanderingimpromptu3** (8): I really like this song but it never quiiiite reaches catharsis and that's frustrating

**wavingwolves** (8): ahh the good old times when rihanna cared about music

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This is a song I never would've expected to be by Rihanna before I heard it, but honestly it doesn't really work for me. Between having parts that sound like Tones and I decided to guest feature, and the pretty repetitive nature of the instrumental it just ends up feeling kinda derivative to me

**twat\_brained** (7.7): I can appreciate artistic risks but this was a step too far for Rihanna. What worked on Stay doesn't work here.

**yourfacesucksass** (7.4): 2015/16 was such a weird time when blue-eyed-soul-tinged songs came out. Like Little Big Town's Girl Crush, Keith Urban's Blue Ain't Your Color, and then Love On The Brain.

**anothertown** (7): her vocals are beautiful, but the instrumental and backing vocal sound like she got them from the 99c store

**kappyko** (7): sorry i like Needed Me and Consideration more........ also really got into Kiss It Better. and Work is good idk this is just something i don

**nightjesus** (7): This is so mature and Rihanna’s voice is so beautiful on this song.

**steelstepladder** (7): A solid Rihanna effort but not one of my favorite songs of hers

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (5.5): sorry RiRi I only have worms on the brain

**awhile2** (5): worst song on ANTI tbh

**nowqueenofpop** (5): I love her but I never understood the hype around this song… that being said yes I am still screaming along

**purplechilipepper** (5): always felt like a pretty generic ballad to be tbh

**teenage\_meme** (5): this is like the one rihanna song i don't like. i just can't vibe with the throwback sound. i'm sorry

**vayyiqra** (4): The title of this song annoys me because I hate how in pop culture we seem to have forgotten that the word "mind" is a thing that exists, and while the line between the functions of the brain and its physical structure is admittedly quite arbitrary, anyway the song itself doesn't do anything for me so no.

**frogaranaman** (0): this is the sonic equivalent of taking that tool they use to get the gunk off your teeth during dentist cleanings and scraping it against my brain

Of all the songs on my "white kid with a snapback in 2011" playlist, this one has probably aged the best. It was Kendrick's first hit because of the infectiously repetitive hook, but that doesn't mean it lacks the depth or critical acclaim of basically any other Kendrick song. This was actually the longest running leader of the rate, and I was really rooting for it because it was on nobody's radar as a potential winner, but it kept racking up 7s and 8s while the songs above it got 10s and its lead was chipped away.

---

**bigbigbee** (11): One of the best song narratives of all time. There is SO MUCH story packed in, and not a single line is wasted. And the instrumental is perfection. I first heard it in the remix Poolside Identity, where it improves the other song (Inside Identity, an anime opening…lol) in every way possible. (Highly recommend, lmao https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zj-M9pvQSyo)

**bbfan132** (10): it sounds like a song of its time but i still love it

**bespectacIed** (10): one of kendrick's best

**camerinian** (10): Good Kid M.A.A.D City might be album of the decade and this is one of many, many highlights

**cremeebrulee** (10): i looooooove kendrick and this song particularly. i love that its a drinking song that's self aware and it's such an earworm

**CrimsonROSET** (10): I'm surprised how little songs there are in rap about alcoholism, when it's an issue just as prominent (if not more) than drug addiction.

**frogaranaman** (10): this was one of the first raps I learned

**ignitethephoenix** (10): the first song that made me a fan of him.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When this is 3rd out 🤡

**kappyko** (10): who the fuck chose this over maad city

**ManofOranges** (10): This was one of my picks and I'm so glad to see it in here. It's catchy, it's satirical I think, it's meaningful, it's just a really good song. The pure irony of singing along the word "drank" to anti-drinking song, Kendrick really has the mind of a mastermind- er, the mind of a master... what is it? I don't know, but he's just smart like that.

**RosaPalms** (10): powerful, real artist type shit. on some ludonarrative dissonance type shit, this fucking kills as a party track

**skargardin** (10): this hits so hard

**steelstepladder** (10): You don't get many songs about alcoholism in the mainstream

**team\_kockroach** (10): It could’ve been trimmed - the “pour up, drank” refrain is repeated 4 times, and the chorus is repeated 3 times. But Dr. Dre always makes the best beats, Kendrick’s verses are iconic, and the Black Hippy remix is awesome.

**twat\_brained** (10): one of the best descriptions of alcoholism I've ever heard in music, this is right up there with Rehab.

**vintagebathingsuit** (10): LOVE this song. wish you could give more than one eleven.

**wavingwolves** (10): a pool full a liquor almost sounds good to me that's how this year has been going. also this is way tooooo good

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): goddddd I need to listen to more kendrick

**brendjac** (9): Iconic anthem

**bulforster** (9): The lyrics, flow and production are all amazing but Kendrick's voice is always just a bit grating to my ears.

**nightjesus** (9): Once again Kendrick just delivers.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): ya'll better not let this song go out on day 1

**TiltControls** (9): An anti-drinking drinking anthem. The fact that someone could accomplish that really shows Kendrick's talent.

**RVA\_101** (8.7): Love that this is the reference from /r/collegebasketball (those who are over there during tournaments know). I'll admit being surrounded by alcoholics in the extended family and friends who sort of don't get why I don't drink (I mean they get it and they don't pressure me but still I think they find it kind of strange) probably influences my opinion on the song. But it's definitely a little relatable.

**lapascalia** (8.5): Kendrick doesn’t miss

**jasannn** (8): Great flow and great melody

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's catchy and I like the subject matter, Kendrick's voice has never been a favorite of mine but he makes some points here

**vayyiqra** (8): S Y R U P S A N D W I C H E S Okay memes aside this is good. I'm so into dark "atmospheric" trap instrumentals.

**worlds-okayest666** (8): i was uh...really incorrect about the meaning of this song the first time i heard it. gotta say, i like it a lot more now that i know what it’s actually about. also, love the production but i wish that snare wasn’t so loud. it almost hurts at some points

**yourfacesucksass** (8): The brooding beat and melody is giving me haunting and I dig it.

**fadedblue09** (7.8): Hmmm good. Gets a little monotonous after a while though.

**seanderlust** (7.1): This hits different than the album version, where at the end of the song he reads himself for filth and then his friend gets shot

**wasian-invasion** (7): ugh swimming in vodka sounds so painful

**1998tweety** (6): this is kind of meh

**SmileAndTears** (6): This snare makes my ears bleed. I also really don't like this chorus

One of Britney's biggest slutbops, this was among the least shocking songs to get voted into this rate (although Break The Ice got a bunch of votes as well.) I think it's good at what it does but what it does isn't particularly groundbreaking so I am very happy it didn't fulfill its destiny as the obvious winner of this rate.

---
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4dbjs5/]

=====

TragicKingdom1: **bulforster** (11): I'm Britney's bitch.

**hikkaru** (11): not to be the basicest bitch in the room but there's no other option for my 11

**ignitethephoenix** (11): one of her greatest songs. This gets my 11 because it seems like the most deserving of being considered a winner. Other than toxic, this is her other peak so I feel like it’s only fair if I try to support this to win (this could definitely be sabotaged though calling it now).

**letsallpoo** (11): /u/ImADudeDuh SUFFER!

**nowqueenofpop** (11): everyone is going to give their 11’s to Telephone but I’ll stand up for what’s right and give my 11 to this hedonistic multi-layered classic. It’s a club anthem, it’s a metaphor, it’s a critique of fame and paparazzi, it’s a wink of self-awareness, it’s everything we needed it to be and more. When she said "they want more? Well I’ll give them more” I was shaken to my core.

**purplechilipepper** (11): IT'S BRITNEY BITCH

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): name a song intro more iconic than "it's britney bitch." considering the shit britney has gone through in the past 20 years, the least ya'll could do is let her win this

**teenage\_meme** (11): with so many great songs in this rate, i thought i might end up giving my 11 to someone other than britney, but this song stands above them all. i don't know if there's anything i can say that hasn't already been said, but i've known this song for 13 years and it shocks me every time. the opening line (of course!), her confident delivery, and of course, that dark, grinding production. a masterpiece by all involved, and by this britney stan's standards, one of the best songs EVER.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): "Gimme More" is actually a desperate plea from Britney to break free from the chains of her conservatorship, disguised as both a sex anthem and a strike at public attention. The opening line, "It's Britney, bitch" is a blunt expression of her personal individuality and her declaration of independence as a human. Who is it? It's her. It's Britney. She is no one but herself. Her identity has been stifled and she wants that to be known. When she says "We can get down like there's no one around," she is indicating that she wants to finally live freely without someone always watching over her. But, nevertheless, they "keep watchin'," and she must "keep dancin'." This leads into the chorus, where they chant for her to give them more despite her own wishes. Proving herself a cunning lyricist, this can double as Britney longing for more freedom each time she forlornly chants "gimme more." The second verse starts with "The center of attention (do you feel this?) / Even when we're up against the wall," which further demonstrates how Britney is shoved into the public eye against her will, even when she's in a tragic situation such as this, hence her questioning if anybody can feel her desperation. She hints at this further with the next lines: *"You got me in a crazy position (yeah) / If you're on a mission / You got my permission". Britney once again details how she is in a catastrophic situation, and lets anyone know whose mission it is to set her free that she very much wants their help. In the bridge, Britney flat out states "I just can't control myself," making her situation abundantly clear to anyone who hasn't caught on by now. In the outro of the song, Danja even speaks in code as Britney's conservator, well aware of the stranglehold it has on Britney's life, saying, "Ah, you gonna have to remove me / ‘Cause I ain’t going nowhere." It is beyond clear that Britney's conversatorship needs to be removed, and she has been pleading for our help for years, even in her most iconic songs. Free Britney.

**twat\_brained** (11): stream Slayyyter's remix

**1998tweety** (10): iconic

**anothertown** (10): A synthesizer (also spelled synthesiser)[1] is an electronic musical instrument that generates audio signals. The synthesizer was invented in 2007 by music producer Danja during the production of Britney Spears’ album Blackout.[2]

**bbfan132** (10): probably her best song, a perfect intro to blackout

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): Has any other song ever produced such an iconic line? Brought out everyone's inner stripper? Defined an era?? I don't think so. Gimme More was a cultural reset, this is a song that will be remembered forever #freeBritney

**Hielord** (10): WHO IS IT?, i live

**J\_Toe** (10): There are still so many pop songs released today that are trying to go for the sound/atmosphere of this track

**lapascalia** (10): It’s just legendary at this point

**ManofOranges** (10): Really great song. Honestly I wouldn't be surprised if it won since Britney's songs do amazing in like every single rate.

**nightjesus** (10): IT’S BRITNEY BITCH! Also side note, I’m not sure how many of you have heard Slayyyter’s cover but holy shit it’s so good.

**plvstvcbvrds** (10): and it was almost my 11. There's nothing like driving thru Los Santos and ignoring people getting robbed while you enjoy the sights while this song plays in between two 80s songs you're too young to recognize and for one moment everything is perfect before you crash into a cop and get a star.

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): most iconic opening line in history of opening lines

**RandomHypnotica** (10): It's Britney, Bitch

**rickikardashian** (10): i was going to say “im glad this is getting a revival because of gays on tiktok” but honestly, as long as there’s gays, this song will never die

**skargardin** (10): this feels most likely to win but we shall see...

**Stryxen** (10): I don’t trust anyone who says this isn’t their favourite song

**Sundraliz** (10): Intro to my all time favorite dark pop album

**Tolk1en** (10): iconic masterpiece. I could listen to this all day

**wavingwolves** (10): made me gay i think

**worlds-okayest666** (10): still Britney’s best song to this day. from the iconic “it’s Britney, bitch” intro to the breakdown and Danja outro...it’s just 4 minutes of complete electropop perfection. like cmon, even hipsters who consider themselves too “cool” for pop have to admit this bumps, and THAT’S how you know it’s a true classic.

**plastichaxan** (9.7): timeless classic this really had me trying to pole dance every chance i could when i was 8

**akanewasright** (9.5): This is a great song, and it was also kind of formative to the development of my musical taste.

**brendjac** (9): It’s Britney, Bitch! Enough said.

**ReallyCreative** (9): me at the hibachi place when they ask how much sauce I want poured on my entree

**wasian-invasion** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tB3ZEZrR7OQ

**yourfacesucksass** (8.8): it's so buzzy and fuzzy and i just really appreciate the slutty pop 2006/2007 era. I still think Piece of Me is the best track from Blackout don't kill me bye.

**awhile2** (8): you heathens this shouldve been piece of me

**Awkward\_King** (8): it really is britney bitch

**selegend** (8): she deserves another rate win

**TiltControls** (8): for sure the most memorable opening of a song ever

**RVA\_101** (7.1): I imagine if this sub had a vote for a national anthem this is one of the nominees. This is not one of the Spears songs I'll unabashedly listen to but it's still a great song. As an aside, her dead eye stare in the album cover is kind of eerie though, wasn't this the record released around the time of her breakdown? Her pale look looks akin to someone breaking down compared to Circus which was also around that time

**camerinian** (7): I think I like the song more for its memeability than the song itself, but in this economy that counts for a lot

**steelstepladder** (7): Super super iconic... but compared to other songs in this rate I'd kinda be dissapointed if it won

**vayyiqra** (7): Yes this is a bop, but it feels kind of empty lyrically, but also it's a bop.

**seanderlust** (6.9): This song has earned its iconic status, but as a piece of music it's just good. I think other parts of Blackout are way stronger.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): kinda sounds like basic britney

**CrimsonROSET** (6): Everyone's hyping this one up so much, is it all because of the 'it's Britney, bitch'?

**SmileAndTears** (6): The intro is iconic but the rest... great gowns, beautiful gowns

**wanderingimpromptu3** (6): catchy, starts very strong but just too repetitive

**team\_kockroach** (5): Why does the tempo feel so slow? I like the vocal effects, but the percussion feels empty.

**RosaPalms** (4): Sometimes I wonder what the infamous VMA performance would have looked like if she’d been at her absolute best, and honestly? I don’t see her doing that much better with this song. It’s kind of listless and meh.

**bespectacIed** (1): Piece of Me>>>>

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i never liked this

**vintagebathingsuit** (1): i feel like i just don't get britney's type of pop.

**fadedblue09** (0): The fuck is this mess. I never cared for 2000's club music, but wow this is worse than usual because Britney does absolutely nothing to make the whole ordeal any bearable! Someone like Robyn or Kylie could inject something of value here, but this is just so dry, soulless and every element seems aimed to grate my ears. Absolutely no redemption for this atrocity.

It's really hard not to be impressed by the soul and rock spirit of this song, and I think the genre blending and overall message really sum up what makes Lemonade an exceptional album, which is why it nearly won the 2016 Ultimate rate. As the runner-up to the most infamous rate winner of all time (Slumber Party), it's no surprise that people wanted to finally see it try again for rate glory. Despite being stable in the top 5 for the entire rate, it never quite made it to that number one spot, but it's had an epic run regardless.

---

**astrologicalangel** (11): there are a lot of great songs in this rate, but this one is the most powerful, and it's stuck with me the most

**bespectacIed** (11): objectively the best and most meaningful song in this rate and will lose again. But what's ironic is I wouldn't have given this my 11 on its the original rate, it'll be Love Drought lol. Anyways the BET awards performance of this with bey and kendrick splashing through the water is the greatest awards show performance of all time, it's not even close. I think I astral projected during the 6 minute performance

**CarlieScion** (11): robbedt

**CrimsonROSET** (11): Queen stays queen.

**pat-rickstar** (11): I'm not exaggerating when I say this song gives me chills which almost never happens for me. This winning would feel right as Bey and Kendrick are the only artists with two songs in the rate

**skargardin** (11): the song truly deserving of redemption.

**bbfan132** (10): this song speaks for itself, i love it

**camerinian** (10): punch me in the fucking face everything about this is so obviously flawless

**cremeebrulee** (10): i gave grimes my 11 but i am rooting for this to win because its by far the most deserving. bey and kdot both sounds incredible here and i genuinely can't believe lemonade hasn't produced a rate winner

**frogaranaman** (10): somehow y'all will Slumber Party this song into #2

**gannade** (10): #BLM

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (10): This song is so powerful, both sonically and lyrically. Beyoncé sounds so good here, strong and completely in control of her voice. I really like Kendrick's verse here, I like it even more now that I've heard the whole season of Dissect dedicated to Lemonade. The analysis they do there made me pay more attention to Kendrick's writing.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): excellence

**ImADudeDuh** (10): When this goes out in the bottom half, the racism....

**ManofOranges** (10): Now this is a hit.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): loooooove a drumline

**purplechilipepper** (10): Kendricks bit at the end is such an amazing high-energy moment and I've definitely replayed it multiple times when this song comes up on shuffle

**steelstepladder** (10): The two artists with multiple songs in the rate we have no choice but to stan

**Stryxen** (10): deserves to win lol

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): everything about this song - vocals, production, message - slaps

**twat\_brained** (10): in this reignited era of Black Lives Matter protests this song deserves to be having a resurgence in popularity.

**wavingwolves** (10): we need more bey + kendrick i think

**worlds-okayest666** (10): dont have much to say about this other than it’s fucking ICONIC

**seanderlust** (9.6): To quote a soon-to-be-replaced Senate Majority Leader, "nevertheless, she persisted."

**1998tweety** (9.5): Bey's bit was of course a 10, thankfully Kendrick ate too so he didn't knock it down much!

**lapascalia** (9.5): The power in this song…

**TiltControls** (9.5): Should've beat Slumber Party

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): there's so much energy in this one, Kendrick is fine, not my favorite but he doesn't take anything away from the song imo

**RVA\_101** (9.1): That hook yo. Fuck. This could easily be covered by a rock band and it wouldn't sound out of place a bit. The drums, the bass, the vocals, the organs. The distorted vox at the end. A marching, anthemic statement that sounds equally apocalyptic as it does optimistic.

**nightjesus** (9): Everything Kendrick touches turns into gold. He really brings this together. Beyoncé and him sound fucking fantastic together.

**RosaPalms** (9): probably the only song in existence to lose a point because of a Kendrick Lamar feature. The only time K Dot got washed by another artist on a track. But man, he got washed

**fadedblue09** (8.5): I prefer the more intimate side of Lemonade (Love Drought, All Night), but honestly this is good too. I can see this going down as a protest song in the near future.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): Still bummed they didn't do the full version at coachella. Loved how well the brass and marching band worked

**plvstvcbvrds** (8): crissle or kid fury was the one who said this song was giving us nike ad and they didn't lie. i ride with bey but this song is not my favorite. but that BET awards show version and performance made me come around a lot.

**cashewconstellation** (7.7): I honestly think Beyonce should have done this song solo

**team\_kockroach** (7.5): Too much like a commercial/movie soundtrack, but it sums up the musical and lyrical themes of Lemonade really well. The drums definitely hold it back, but Kendrick kills the verse.

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): I've never liked those anthemic blood-pumping kind of songs. I liked Kendrick's part tho

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): i see why slumber party won

**vayyiqra** (6): Catchy but not my vibe. How have I never heard all of Lemonade anyway? I should get on that.

**awhile2** (5): literally the worst Bey song that was up for redemption wtf

One of Carly's best songs, very memorable hook and great throbbing bass production. This is the only song represented from our first ever rate (*Emotion vs. 1989 vs. Dangerous Woman*), surprisingly. Perhaps we will have to redo that entire rate someday! I shouldn't be surprised that this made it all the way to 2nd place despite flying under the radar in hype but that's the strength of Carly on this subreddit for you.

---

**cashewconstellation** (11): My favorite song in Carly's entire discography.

**CritneySpearz** (11): yes i'm a WHORE for CRJ so it's an easy 11, but how can you not absolutely scream your heart out to these lyrics omg

**lapascalia** (11): This is one of my favourite songs ever by Carly, it never gets old for me.

**ReallyCreative** (11): Carly has this knack for making songs "feel" queer even when they aren't explicitly so, and there's no better example than Your Type. That desperate feeling of longing, feeling obligated to apologize for exposing how you feel, the explosive chorus proclaiming that you know you'll never be more than a friend. Every aspect of this song feels queer coded (and I believe it was originally written about a gay man?) and that's why Carly is queen of the gays.

**SideBTrack8** (11): >>> RAWM

**1998tweety** (10): ugh this song really is that bitch huh, a MASSIVE gay bop I really have no choice but to stan huh

**bbfan132** (10): stream love again and never get to hold you

**bespectacIed** (10): Hennessy on my lips take a little sip privacy on the door imma make the shit grip

**bigbigbee** (10): makes my heart feel full and happy

**camerinian** (10): This is probably gonna be my favourite Carly song forever and ever. I love how potent every stage of the grieving process seems to be sold here, and it leads to simple but effective lyrics, a powerful vocal performance and an absolute monster of a hook. The goddamn wail of agony on the chorus is awe-inspiring and amazing and pulls together a masterpiece of pop. Mwah

**CrimsonROSET** (10): Call Me Maybe girl, upvotes to the left.

**frogaranaman** (10): quick which Twitter mutual that I'm in love with do I send this to

**InternetDude19** (10): Relatable.
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4de9um/]

=====

TragicKingdom1: **ManofOranges** (10): I closely associate the way this song makes me feel with the way the song "Sleepover" by Hayley Kiyoko makes me feel, so I'm just gonna revise the comment I made for that song in its rate and use that: This song takes me back to the crush I had a few years ago on this guy who was in my anatomy and physiology class who was really hot and he and I used to talk all the time and we were always partners in partner activities and so I'd think that maybe he actually is gay but that he was just too afraid to tell me and that he was actually closeted or something I don't know. So we'd be partners in like a blood pressure activity and I'd have to take his blood pressure since he was my partner and I'd think "maybe this is the time that I ask him if he's ever streamed emotion by carly rae jepsen" but I felt like that was too on the nose so I didn't do it and I'd just focus on how big his arms were and how I kinda wished he'd choke me and then I'd remember where I was and ask him how to write blood pressure correctly even though I knew how to do it simply because I really just wanted to have any reason to talk to him. And then at one point we had a test about muscular system or something like that and I'd pretend like I'm gonna flop the test because I wanted to talk to him some more and then I'd get a 100 on it and he'd be like "you're smart" and I'd be like wow I think he wants to marry me and then I'd help him correct the questions he got wrong and hope that maybe during that time he'd tell me something really personal or ask me to prom or something, I don't know, and then nothing would happen. And then we'd come back to class another time and he'd drink a bottle of water and I'd feel like I'd have to drink a bottle of water too because imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Rinse and repeat for like 5 months and then it's the end of the semester and I realize that I'm never gonna have a class with him again because he just doesn't take the same classes I do and so I have a break down and one day I go home and I just can't take it anymore and I come out to a friend for the first time. So as one of my mechanisms for coping I went back to Emotion and remembered this song and for like a whole damn week I'd listen to this song and think "I'm not the type of girl for you" and "I love you I'm sorry I'm sorry I love you" and I'd try to get over him but then I'd go back the next day and there he was and sometimes he'd like stretch or something and I'd see a little bit of his stomach and I'd go right back to fawning over him because I really was desperate and a straight man's whore. And that would go on until the end of the semester and then I'd think, "oh well at least I won't have to see him anymore so maybe I'll get over him" but it turns out that he and I exited the school the same way so we'd actually just exit the school together and walk beside each other and talk and I knew I was fucked but I couldn't help it. And then whenever he wasn't at school or he didn't walk beside me at the end of the day I went home and listened to this song because I assumed he somehow figured out that I was into him and he never wanted to see me again but it's okay because I simply was not the type of guy for him. And that continued to the end of the year and all that time I was really thinking he'd still come out to me as if a white boy located in the southeastern united states and who played on the football team was actually gay--what was I thinking. And the year ended and once again I listened to Your Type and thought "at least I'll get over him because I won't be around him" but I legit dreamed about him sometimes and then I'd have to listen to this song or vent to my friend or something and eventually the beginning of the next school year came and I was like "okay that's it we're done I'm over him" and then I was exiting my chemistry class one day and I saw him and I purposely walked so we'd be walking together in the halls and it was at that moment that I knew I still wasn't over him. And I asked him if he was going to a school dance later that week and if he had a date because I was once again expecting him to say some really personal shit like that he was actually really wanting to ask me to go with him and was just too afraid to say so but then he was like "well I was gonna go but my parents don't like the girl I was gonna go with" and my heart broke into a million pieces and I went home and moped and knew that I shouldn't have fallen for a straight man but I just couldn't help it and then I listened to Your Type for like a 100 times on loop. Good times.

**nootnoot781** (10): wow i love the *checks notes* sixth best song on emotion

**patcheso8** (10): extremely relatable holy shit

**PointlessBibliophage** (10): an eternal mood for crushing on your straight best friend, excuse me while go brood in a corner streaming this on repeat like i've done for the past four years

**rickikardashian** (10): Carly releasing a song as good as RAWMe is lowkey problematic, because songs that are also pop perfection have to live in the shadow of the ultimate pop song, this being the biggest victim. this is the perfect queer coded song for the gays to cry when they fall for any straight guy that showed them a bit of human decency

**skargardin** (10): I won't ever get enough of this song

**SmileAndTears** (10): Carly invented unrequited love ugh her mind

**Tolk1en** (10): Pop perfection. One of CRJ's best

**vayyiqra** (10): No "omg this is totally about me and my straight crush" discourse from me; honey, I -am- the straight crush in this scenario. All I can say is: Carly can make as many sappy 80s ballads as she can and I will listen to them and love them. [Side note: the video for this is really cute and aesthetic and perfect.]

**wasian-invasion** (10): One of my faves off Emotion. You can just sing along at the top of your lungs cause Carly just gives off soo much emotion (heh)

**wavingwolves** (10): yeah i'm unlovable what about it

**worlds-okayest666** (10): so GOOD!!! this > RAWM and no i will not apologize

**Stryxen** (9.6): second best song from emotion (justice for 1et’s get 1ost)

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): My only issue with this and some other Carly songs (like RAWM) is the vocals being too quiet in the verses (it does make the chorus hit harder though)

**TiltControls** (9.5): I am forever grateful to the CRJ stan in 2015 who used to play this all the time over my uni gym's speakers and got me back into Carly

**astrologicalangel** (9): love a good pining song

**cremeebrulee** (9): this used to be a skip for me on the album but it eventually grew on me. while i do love it now, i can't look past the fact that i wished emotion made it here instead lol

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I like this song but it’s not one of my favourites from her

**insolentire** (9): Second best from EMOTION (after Run Away With Me). Carly is pop delight

**steelstepladder** (9): Fantastic. Would rather have Emotion though

**twat\_brained** (9): Great but Roses and First Time were right there

**yourfacesucksass** (9): Production and lyrics are so on point. Top 3 from Emotion.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): I don't even really like carly but this SLAPS?

**jasannn** (8): It's not my favorite off EMOTION but it fits perfectly within the album.

**purplechilipepper** (8): this song is amazing but tbh it's not even in my top 5 on emotion

**RosaPalms** (8): big ol’ pop banger. mid-tier for EMOTION, so, like, really fucking good

**seanderlust** (7.8): It's basically a song about the friendzone, but goddamn it is a jam. I'LL MAKE TIME FOR YOUUUU-HOOOO!

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (7.5): it's sad pining hours lads

**akanewasright** (7): This would be a 10 if I didn’t have a really horribly embarrassing story involving the song.

**awhile2** (7): honestly the hook sounds like it could be from a gaga song so this is better than 90% of crj's discography

**letsallpoo** (7): i remember i deflated my score for this in the original rate because i wanted taylor to make the top 5

**Sundraliz** (7): This one isn't in my top half of Carly songs. Doesn't stop it from being a 7 of a song though, Carly's power.

**RVA\_101** (6.7): Lmao already I can tell my last.fm is gonna look so strange for these next 30 tracks, these are definitely not songs I'm used to listening to on a regular basis. That being said, this first one is pretty solid. Love the '80s style drum machine and synth bass. One of those 'big soaring chorus' songs I see

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I really love this song, but if this wins, I will SIGH because she clearly does NOT need redemption! Carly absolutely ATE in that rate and if she has any songs that need redemption, it should be a song from Kiss IMO.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): enjoyable but i don't enjoy EMOTION as a whole as most of popheads so shoot me

**anothertown** (6): a C-tier emotion song

**team\_kockroach** (6): Why does r/popheads blast Justin Bieber and Shawn Mendes for making the same song over and over again, when CRJ does the same thing? TBF, this is an exaggeration, because Carly has some seriously talented songs, but this is...not one of them.

**plvstvcbvrds** (5): I do not like this song and I probably never will. It's such a pick-me anthem and the instrumental is wasted on the lyrics.

**gannade** (3): aged like cheese

**nightjesus** (2): This was like my least favourite song off the Emotion album. It should have been Emotion the song. In my fantasy that’s what I’m listing too.

It was inevitable that a song from *Melodrama* would make it in, but why this one? I would've preferred "Liability" because it defies this sub's typical balladphobia and is a bit of a meme for being associated with twink angst. Anyways, this is quite good like the rest of its album despite just being another upbeat Jack Antonoff song. But I'm really surprised that "quite good" was good enough to win this rate, as it had a come-from-behind rise to the top from around 20th place over the course of the rate, despite having a relatively low 8.524 average. If there's one conclusion that we should draw from this rate's top 2, it's that the circlejerk around certain albums seems to trump the circlejerk around certain songs.

---

**\_helenzhang\_** (11): i will NEVER stop talking about how much i love love love the prechorus

**brendjac** (11): One of the best songs of the past three years, period.

**guayaba\_and\_cheese** (11): Miss Lorde really snapped when she wrote Supercute. It gets my 11 for the feelings and images it manages to evoke. I can clearly see the movie that goes along to this track. The wonderful moments, the laughter, the polaroid pictures at golden hour... only to feel the crash coming cause it was just wishful thinking. It's a song about regret and overthinking, "in my head I do everything right, when you call I'll forgive and not fight". To wrap this up, this songs gets me in my feelings and I will probably drunk karaoke this once the pandemic is over.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): On top of being a perfect song in every way, it taught me how to spell 'fluorescent' which came useful in my English exam where almost everyone else got it wrong, so thank you Lorde

**PointlessBibliophage** (11): possibly her best song, but then again we all know most tracks on melodrama could be that

**seanderlust** (11): The decision to leave the first part of the third verse as an unpolished Voice Notes track.....chef's kiss.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This is the best song on Melodrama, my favorite song of 2017, and my 11 the last time we rated it, so yeah, it's still my 11.

**Stryxen** (11): oh finally, my emotional support song. fancy seeing you here

**SweatpantsLesbian** (11): Her best song period.

**TiltControls** (11): Even though I gave this a 10 last time, I don't think I fully appreciated how great of a song it is until a few months after. The production, the lyrics, every single thing about it just comes together perfectly.

**WaffleWhales** (11): deserves

**1998tweety** (10): she snapped here ill admit that, we want her Joanne era (but about her dog instead)

**bbfan132** (10): i haven’t listened to this in a while… thankfully, it’s just as good as i remembered it being

**bespectacIed** (10): timeless

**camerinian** (10): It's been three years how the fuck does Melodrama just keep getting better with every listen

**cremeebrulee** (10): my favorite track from melodrama usually changes with time, but most times than not it'll be this

**frogaranaman** (10): when those saw synths come in.. yeah❤️

**hikkaru** (10): wild and fluorescent come home to my heaAAAAARGH

**hunnybee12** (10): inmyheadidoeverythingright🥺

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Best song off melodrama perhaps

**InternetDude19** (10): I don't remember exactly why, but a few years ago in English class we had to stand up on the teachers desk and recite a quote or a song lyric that resonated with us. I think this was for a poetry unit? Anyway, I got up and smugly said, "In my head I do everything right" and the class went wild. This song is a part of my legacy.

**J\_Toe** (10): With themes of memory and nostalgia this does indeed seem like Melodrama's answer to Ribs

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm surprised that, of all the Melodrama songs to make it on here, this was the one. Don't get me wrong, it's amazing, it's just there were so many to choose from since Melodrama was essentially almost all of the top 10 in its rate. Still love it though. It's top-notch.

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this song reminds me of a bad time in my life and I'm STILL giving it a 10, it's that good

**pat-rickstar** (10): I hate that I now associate this song with a phcj post of a p*rn video but I love it so much, easily a top 3 Lorde song for me

**plastichaxan** (10): this isn't even top 3 melodrama for me and it for sure is a 10

**purplechilipepper** (10): I almost gave this my 11 but Britney tho

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Supercut is just such a rush from start to end, it's exactly what I love about the tracks on Melodrama

**rickikardashian** (10): im the biggest lorde stan and i truly believe that melodrama is one of the best pop albums to ever be created……… but seeing lorde stans LOSE IT when los ageless got revealed as the winner? priceless.

**skargardin** (10): in the context of the album it's EVERYTHING but it holds its own just as fine ugh

**steelstepladder** (10): "In my head I did everything right" is such a soul crushing lyric it's not even funny

**team\_kockroach** (10): Jack Antonoff’s drums are everything. I love RTJ, but El-P butchered the remix when he took them off.

**twat\_brained** (10): comE HOME TO MY HEART AAAARGH!!!!!! Worss cannot describe my love for Ella

**wasian-invasion** (10): I was listening to Melodrama while prepping dinner and my dad asked what's a supercut and I honestly had no idea.

**wavingwolves** (10): the best from melodrama

**worlds-okayest666** (10): i know this is like...an incredibly basic opinion, but jesus this song is so GOOD. i used to not like the outro but i’ve warmed up to it, it’s like a moment to just sit there and think about everything/come down from the emotional journey miss Lorde just put you on
[/r/popheads/comments/iobvfj/the_redemption_rate_reveal/g4dewzr/]

=====

TragicKingdom1: **ignitethephoenix** (9.5): one of my favs from melodrama for sure

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): she really made a song about the only place I can afford to get a haircut, economically conscious queen, Grimes found imperializing

**Hielord** (9): Sad banger

**lapascalia** (9): One of the best songs on Melodrama

**RosaPalms** (9): And you know what, fancy? You don’t need an appointment at Supercuts. They love walk-ins!

**Tolk1en** (9): Her voice really resonates... Damn this was perfect pop. Did lorde release an album today @DidLorde?

**CrimsonROSET** (8.7): I could do with a bit more intense drumming, but at the same time, this is great!

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Once again, Jack Antonoff can do no wrong

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): Melodrama as a whole is amazing and this song is no exception

**vayyiqra** (8): "~In my mouth, I have mashed avocado" - Lorde but also this song is good. Again, Jackoff is your king. Bow down to him, losers.

**insolentire** (7): Melodrama has better tracks, but it's good

**kappyko** (7): melodrama :/

**nowqueenofpop** (7): Lorde I wish I vibed with your sound a bit more… but sometimes it really is just a supercut of us :/

**wanderingimpromptu3** (7): I thought I was going to give a lower score than this but while the chorus melody is too flat, she is SUCH an incredible lyricist. "we were wild and fluorescent come home to my heart"

**RVA\_101** (6.8): Predictable chord progression but Lorde's songwriting makes you forget that. This is still probably not the best song on the Melodrama record but it's still a strong showing. I don't know if the vocals sounding like they were recorded raw in front of a piano with a cell phone in the middle was an artistic choice but I'd say it worked. The end is very atmospheric, love when artists just let the song ride out like that.

**astrologicalangel** (5): is it too controversial to say I prefer Pure Heroine to Melodrama?

**nightjesus** (4): This reminds me of Ribs a little bit which is a song I really adore. This one I don’t really vibe.

**fadedblue09** (2): Second worst song on Melodrama (right after Writer in the Dark, obviously). (Seriously, wtf is up with these choices).

**selegend** (1): the one song i really don’t like from melodrama

**gannade** (0): this sounds like ass
