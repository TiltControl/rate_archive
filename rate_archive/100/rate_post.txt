# The Rules

* We will be rating 30 songs in this rate and you must rate all of them for your scores to count.

* Assign a score to each song between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine, so long as they are to one decimal place (i.e. 5.4 is fine, 5.42 is not). Also, please use periods (.) for the decimal places and not commas (,).

* You may give ONE song an 11 and ONE song a 0. Reserve these scores for your favorite and least favorite songs in the rate.

* The only place you should submit your scores is at the preprepared link found above and below.

* Feel free to change your scores at any time up to the due date, just PM me about it.

* I reserved the right to reject and ask you to resubmit any ballot if I feel you are unfairly sabotaging any of the songs! That being said please take advantage of the full range of points if possible; if you give all 10s then your scores will barely matter.

* If you would like to add a comment to your scores, the correct way to format them is:

> Nelly Furtado - Maneater: 10 all these songs by white women will EAT the songs by MEN!

This is THE ONLY WAY to properly form comments.

Because this is a shorter rate that interrupts the normal rate schedule, it is going to be due much sooner than a rate normally would after going up: this rate is due at **noon EST on Monday, September 7th.** Fortunately, you won't have to wait long for the results, because they will be revealed later that day!

Thank you all for reading and good luck to those seeking redemption! Also if y'all let Gaga win yet another grab bag I will be forced to cancel rates forever so keep that in mind xoxo
