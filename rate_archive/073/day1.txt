---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (6): The closing track of She's So Unusual! It definitely sums up the album well and utilizes the synths and dance-pop instrumental seen in all tracks before.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (1): Sis what is this anime voice in the back talking about them loving sushi. The jazz is great but holy fuck the adlibs and the random voice. The only thing keeping me from giving this a zero is some moments of good vocals and the production

---

##Yeah Yeah!

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Justice for “He’s So Unusual.” Like a lot of new wave songs the lyrics don’t make a lot of sense, it’s more about the onslaught of sounds and the overall vibe. And man, what a vibe! This is one of those “everything and the kitchen sink” songs that I adore. Cyndi goes everywhere at once on this track; she’s both placed firmly at the center of the track and wandering above everything aimlessly. She injects her already off-the-wall vocals with a B-52s-esque twist and her performance ends up sounding insane in the best way, and it’s perfectly matched by the band who are just *nailing* it. Plus there’s touches of surf rock, which as a California boy I always love. The snippet of “He’s So Unusual” that plays as the song is closing is just the cherry on top of an already delightful song. It’s not a perfect song by any means, but I think that’s why I like it so much. More than any other song in the rate this is just pure crackerjacks, it’s an explosion of vibrant energy that takes it home but leaves us wanting more.

**Chevsapher** (8.3): This is a genuinely fun track, and I like the synths mimicking a roller rink organ, but those vocals in the left stereo channels are... interesting.

**MrSwearword** (8): a nice and peppy closer

**skargardin** (8): This actually bopped really hard, if the adlibs had been removed it would've been a nine.

**waluigiest** (8): at least the ending of the album kind of bops

**radiofan15** (7.7): Funny and quirky... her vocals can fucking choke but her ear for interesting and slightly annoying for interesting melodies is ever present.

**bbfan132** (7.5): this is a mess but it’s a fun one

**bespectacIed** (7): I don't like sushi

**slimboyfriend** (7): She’s so versatile, she can even sing in dolphin

##A No No.

**1998tweety** (6.5): Not a very good closer, very mediocre.

**vayyiqra** (6): This was a really weird ending to this album. [SUSHI I LOVE SUSHI what the fuck is this line? Am I hearing these spoken vocals right, or am I having auditory hallucinations right now in my left ear only? What a weird artistic choice.] The lyrics are kind of dumb, but I'm ... glad it exists I guess?

**J\_Toe** (3): what the fuck is that line about sushi? And that voice?

**agentofscranton** (0): I actually don't mind Cyndi's vocals that much compared to other people but good god who on earth approved the gremlin betty boop impression in the background of this song when her regular singing voice already sounds like a half-drunk teenage girl with a smoking addiction

**ignitethephoenix** (0): As soon as I heard the baby voice just in my right ear, I had to give this a 0. God its so cringe and ruins the song.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): "what do you think we should add to this song?" "Yes"

##This did not get any scores over 8

**1998tweety** (8): Maam please don't end this album of ballads with a 6-minute long ballad.

**bespectacIed** (8): Should've closed this album with Greatest Love of All but still a great ballad

**Chevsapher** (7.8): Another solid but uninteresting melodramatic ballad. Why is it six minutes long, though?

**MrSwearword** (6): competent but oh my god why the fuck is this the closer to the album

**waluigiest** (6): I don’t want your love I want your money

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): This is background sleeping music

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this album was surprisingly boring

**slimboyfriend** (5): I’m falling asleep

**Ghost-Quartet** (4.5): It’s not a bad song but it’s way too long and it’s NOT sexy! Aspiring songwriters, just as a tip never use the word “pleasure” in reference because it’s gonna gross your audience out. When the song started and Teddy was singing I felt like I needed to call an adult.

**vayyiqra** (4): All these ballads are blending together, and this one did not need to be six minutes long. At least I got through this kind of dull album, finally.

**skargardin** (3): Goodbye, this was terribly boring. I struggled to keep focus past the first minute.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): i've been so bored with these last 3 whitney please

**radiofan15** (1): no thanks... please let me go, I wanna go!

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (8.5): One of the slower songs on Forever Your Girl, Next To You is one of my favorite showcases of Paula's voice. On the album, it is right after Straight Up, and they contrast each other well but work thematically.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.7): I didn’t expect this from Paula, this is very silky and dreamy. It’s a nice change of pace from the more in-your-face, sillier tracks but it still blends in. Maybe I’m crazy but it feels a little ahead of its time, slow this down a little and add some trap drums and this could have been released by an alt-r&b girl last year.

**1998tweety** (8): Snooze a bit but I was expecting an obligatory ballad. It's cute.

**Chevsapher** (7.9): It's not a bad song, but it's easily the most uninteresting track on the album. Next, please.

**waluigiest** (7): dreamy and certainly pleasant

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I enjoy the Pokémon-esque production but not a fan of her ballads.

**bespectacIed** (6): Ballad hater alert but it's not that bad just a bit boring in comparison to the million other 80s ballads

**MrSwearword** (6): a saccharine slow number that every fucking 80s album was required to have. It's not terrible but unnecessary as fuck.

**vayyiqra** (6): I love 80s pop ballads but this one ain't it.

**slimboyfriend** (5): A flat four and a half minute interlude between the two best songs on the album

**radiofan15** (2.1): NO NO NO FUCK THE FUCK OFF CHEESY 80S BALLAD!

**ImADudeDuh** (2): because they need somebody to go home first

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (8.5): Ironically, the score between love potions 8 and 9.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4): I want to like this song but cyndi sweetie, you're so close with the production and lyrics but God that voice, I know you're trying but sis, it didn't hit. This would be a great song if it was given to someone else

---

##Love Potion Number 8

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): One of my favorites from this album, she sounds insane and I’m here for it. I love the weird lyrics on this song!

**Chevsapher** (8): I love the concept and the verses, but that chorus is subpar.

**radiofan15** (7.5): Chaotic and experimental little bop... the middle portion is a serve and a half, she really DID THAT before Sophie was even a thing!

**1998tweety** (7): There are elements of this that I like (the production is great), but also a bunch I don't (the vocal delivery).

##Love Potion Number H8

**vayyiqra** (6): Filler. It kinda bops, ngl, but I see now why some other Popheads complained about Cyndi's voice being annoying. It just has this unusual timbre and can get very high-pitched.

**MrSwearword** (0): oh my fucking god, this is so horrible and made of failure

**waluigiest** (0): oh boy where do I even start

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): The instrumental here is really upbeat, and Lauper's voice only adds to it. I really like the "I don't wanna be" part. There's a lot of interesting instrumental choices here that work well with Lauper's voice.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5): Stream Witness (title track) by Katy Perry

---

##Will You Be My Witness?

**1998tweety** (8): This is a cute bop but Katy is not shook at all

**Chevsapher** (8): It works well with the album, and I enjoy its little quirks, but this song definitely isn't single material.

**letsallpoo** (8): insert katy perry joke here

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Someone’s gonna make a Katy Perry joke, aren’t they? It’s a fine song I guess, the reggae vibes are a nice change of pace that blend well with the overall sound of the album.

**JunkyGS** (7): Katy Perry Shook

**MrSwearword** (7): I am not mad at the B-52's sounding beach pop vibes this song is emitting but I can literally get this jush from The Tide is High by Blondie

**waluigiest** (7): this is postmodern

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Katy did it better not gonna lie...

**J\_Toe** (6): something something Katy Perry something something wig...

**slimboyfriend** (6): Blah blah blah, Kathryn Perry did it better...

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): insert katy joke

**skargardin** (5): This album is seriously hit-or-miss at this point

**vayyiqra** (5): [insert hilarious Katy Perry joke] This is a weird song. The rhythm is weird, the melody is weird. I can't explain why but I just don't like it.

**CarlieScion** (4): i will not make the obvious joke

**ImADudeDuh** (2): did everyone just decide to play out of sync on the bridge?

**radiofan15** (0): Katy Perry and even fucking MAGIC! outsold.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this is worse than every song on the katy album

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): The first of two tracks with Jermaine Jackson in Whitney's album, Nobody Loves Me Like You Do is a really sweet song. I really like the parts when they both sing, they really work great together.

---

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is a cute duet

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): These melodramatic romantic ‘80s duets… honestly I’m here for it. The lyrics, the music, the singing, all of it has this gravitas to it that really makes love sound monumental. Especially the lyrics.

**Chevsapher** (7.9): A well-written love ballad, but it's not terribly interesting.

**b\_mcq** (7): aww cute

**bespectacIed** (7): The worse of the jermaine jackson duets in this album

**ignitethephoenix** (7): They sound great together but wow I’m just very bored by this point in the album.

**waluigiest** (6): not that interesting but it doesn’t sound bad

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Whitney just BULLDOZES over Jermaine lol

**skargardin** (5): i sleep

**radiofan15** (4.1): insomnia has found her biggest foe!

**vayyiqra** (4): I like ballads sometimes, and duets, and piano, and 80s cheese. This one is not working for me though.

**MrSwearword** (1): the previous track did much better than this bullshit

**bbfan132** (0): this is the most overly saccharine song i’ve ever listened to…

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7): Cute I guess

---

##I DO Need You

**bespectacIed** (9): Fell in love with the first 3 seconds

**Chevsapher** (8.6): I have a few minor nitpicks with this song, but it's surprisingly good for an album track. As with many songs on this album, the bridge is the best part.

**1998tweety** (8): My least fav so far but it still bops, sax solo slayed.

**vayyiqra** (8): I can't get enough of this late-80s/early 90s sound. I'm not even listening to any of the lyrics on this album, because they don't matter. This an unabashed dance-pop album, and the production is what carries it. Also, I love saxophone in pop songs, when it's done right. Who doesn't?

##Independent

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Sonically, a boneless Straight Up. Also vaguely Jepsen-esque??

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I think I said “Knocked Out” was the most filler track on this album but that’s just because I literally forgot this existed.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): Not a fan of the extra baby voice here from Paula. It’s also a bit empty sounding and drags on longer than it should.

**skargardin** (5): this was just really boring, sorry queen

**waluigiest** (5): don’t need this

**radiofan15** (4.4): Cute sax solo... but you let an anonymous sax solo to outshine you Paula!

**MrSwearword** (3): simply put, I'm sure there's worse but fuck if this song isn't made of failure

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): Madonna's voice here is solid. The chorus is my favorite part. A really fun, shorter track that really fits after Burning Up.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5): I expected more from Madonna than this, I know she can do better

---

**1998tweety** (9): Ok why is every song so far so good, I'm shook.

**radiofan15** (8.7): Kinda light and disposable but quirky and fun enough for me to enjoy.

**Chevsapher** (8.4): This is weakest song on the album, but it's still a fun track.

**waluigiest** (8): the pulsing sax is so sexy

**vayyiqra** (7): It's a bop but one of the weaker tracks on the album. I still like the swing feel it has though.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): It’s fine I guess. It sounds like it could have been from a musical maybe. There’s actually some potential here but it’s undercut by the tinny instrumental that robs the song of any power it might have had.

**skargardin** (5): It's kinda forgettable in the grand scheme of things

**slimboyfriend** (5): Ehhhhhhhh she can do better

**ImADudeDuh** (4): oh this feels very awkward

**MrSwearword** (1): this is fucking awful and corny

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): The second song with Jermain Jackson on this album, and I understand why, cause issa bop sis. Jermaine once again serves a chill bop, whos voice compliments her very well.

---

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): This dynamic funk! I think it gets weighed down by some of the instrumental choices (I’m not a huge fan of the way that they made that drop happen after the chorus) but when it succeeds it’s soooo smooth. Jermaine and Whitney have really good chemistry.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Another cute duet, I think this is my fav of their two.

**Chevsapher** (8.2): The strings at the top of the mix are the best part (apart from Whitney, of course).

**bespectacIed** (8): The better of the two jermaine jackson duets in the album

**waluigiest** (8): this song throbs

**ImADudeDuh** (7): a dora bowl

**MrSwearword** (7): at least this duet doesn't immediately suck but oh my god the saccharine content; put this on the back of diet soda cans.

**vayyiqra** (7): If all of this album had more of this energy I would like it more.

**slimboyfriend** (5): I just wanna know who said “You know what could really make this album go off? Jermaine Jackson. TWICE.”

**radiofan15** (3.5): I'm dying please someone help me!

##Thinking about Vocals

**waluigiest** (10): paved the way for frank ocean and ariana grande

**bespectacIed** (9): VOCALS

**CarlieScion** (9): ari is shook

**Chevsapher** (8.6): HUNH! Upbeat, dark, and relatively experimental, with some fun melodies. It reminds me of Janet's Control album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.7): This song is almost too long for me but through smart lyric writing it manages to keep my attention. Like, the imagery and verbiage in the verses are really cool. And I was snatched a little bit when Whitney changed up her style for that third verse.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I’m shook this sounds like it was produced by dev hynes

**1998tweety** (7): Not really feeling this, it's hard to explain but the song sounds off at a bunch of points.

**vayyiqra** (7): I have some problems with this production but I love the synth bass on this. This might seem weird but it reminds me of the video game soundtracks from the 90s I grew up with, which I swear is the reason I like electropop today.

**radiofan15** (5.7): This is so 80s that Stranger Things asked her to tone it down a little.

**MrSwearword** (5): it feels incredibly half-assed considering Whitney's vocals are there and the beat just sucks

**skargardin** (4): It's in one ear, out the other, unfortunately

---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4): Another song that would be great if it wasn't too long, if she shaved off two minutes it could work, but by dragging on too long, my score drags too

---

**vayyiqra** (10): I fucking love this song. Madonna really snapped when she invented the academic subfields of biochemistry and social neurobiology. This deserves to be better-known.

**waluigiest** (10): I LOVE long 80s dance hits that is an era we will never be able to recreate

**Chevsapher** (9.2): The strongest non-single on the album. The driving bassline, melodic ad-libs, and spoken-word portions are my favorite parts.

**1998tweety** (8): This is cute and it has a nice beat, but it does drag on a lil too long.

**radiofan15** (7.5): Definitely the lowest point of the album... it's quite a good albeit unsubstantial song, but the score is as low as it is because this one has no right to be longer than, let's say, Bohemian Rhapsody.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): synth line reminds me of Nasty Girl by Vanity 6

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): What’s Madonna’s obsession with putting an underwhelming instrumental break in the middle of her songs?

**MrSwearword** (5): once I heard the "chemical reaction" line, I couldn't entertain this song

**waluigiest** (9): this is so theatrical she delivered her y’all

**1998tweety** (8): This is a cute bop

**JunkyGS** (8): Queen of telling The Gays to get off grindr and go out irl

**Chevsapher** (7.9): The hook is a bit weak, but the chords and melodies in the verses are interesting.

**vayyiqra** (7): Lyrically it's kind of a nothingburger but it bops.

**radiofan15** (6.5): Her voice is too good for these kind of generic songs.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): This is just way too repetitive even though she sounds great as usual.

**bbfan132** (5.5): her voice is the only thing saving this song from getting a lower score, yikes

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): The narrative it presents is cute but kind of interesting for how long the song is. It’s like, she’s lonely, so she goes to a party and finds a guy? That’s not very evocative, nor is the melody/chorus very strong, so when we get to the final two minutes of the song which are basically just her repeating “someone for me” over and over again there’s not really any power behind it. The verses are cute though, they kind of save it for me.

**MrSwearword** (1): same problem as track two but this pisses me off more

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (8.5): The last track on Forever Your Girl! One or the Other is really different lyrically from the beginning of this album, and the progression from those early lyrics to now was solid. As for the song, I like that the instrumental sounds like it's popping out at you. The part with multiple vocals is really great.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): Queen of decisions!

---

##Chose the One

**waluigiest** (10): this didn’t have to slap so hard honestly it sounds like a flirty Mario Kart dance party

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The strongest non-single on the album. The keyboard solo and the breakdown are pure fun, and the hook is deliciously catchy.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A cute bop closer

**ignitethephoenix** (8): bop!

**bespectacIed** (7): A banger and a cute closer

##Chose the Other

**radiofan15** (6.9): Why is this the album closer?

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Kind of a weird ending for the album. She’s having her “forgotten early Kylie Minogue B-side” moment.

**vayyiqra** (6): Why is there a Michael Jackson song on this album? Oh well, it's okay I guess.

**slimboyfriend** (5): Indistinctly You Girl xoxo

**MrSwearword** (3): terrible closer considering the previous track.

**Chevsapher** (8.6): I like the timing on the melodies, and Cyndi's vocals work really well here. Also, was that a high note?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Was that… was that a whistle note?

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is decent, again, not the biggest fan of the vocals, but I like the lyrics on this.

**radiofan15** (7.2): Cindy sweetheart you ain't Mariah, don't ever do that fucking whistle note again, its way above your capacities.

**MrSwearword** (7): energetic but inconsequential at large

**vayyiqra** (7): It's very cheesy even by the standards of this rate, but fun. Also, she said "time after time" which means it's meta, whether on purpose or not, and I love meta stuff.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): Not a fan of Cyndi’s voice particularly in this song

**DrunkHurricane** (4): her voice is really annoying here

**waluigiest** (4): that whistle note was straight comedy!! But I listened to Prince’s version and that song is actually beautiful. Sorry Cyndi!

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like a drunk bachelorette guest at a drag show trying to sing along to whatever Katy Perry song the drag queen who placed 10th in Rupaul's Drag Race is performing.

MrSwearword: If I counted right, the skinny ledger for Day 1 looks like this:

**MADONNA** wins Day 1 with only 2 songs being chopped

**PAULA** survives and almost wins Day 1 with 3 songs being chopped

**CYNDI** had 4 songs chopped

**WHITNEY** loses Day 1 with 5 songs chopped

Damn, the strength singles can have y'all

bespectacIed: I gave the remaining whitney songs at least a 10 so I'm not mad at the slaughter. Knew madge's gonna dominate anyway w/ her almost ballad-less debut
