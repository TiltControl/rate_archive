ElectricBoogaloo41: # #10: Whitney Houston - Saving All My Love for You

**Lowest Scores:**

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): Houson's vocals in this song are impeccable! The second single from Whitney Houston, Saving All My Love For You was one of the world's first times hearing her incredible voice, turning her into a worldwide superstar. While it isn't a dancepop song, SAMLFY is definitely one of my favorite songs in the rate. The very pretty piano notes and the incredible saxophone solo also help make this song the beautiful piece it is!

---

**bespectacIed** (10): We love an edging/abstinence anthem! Whitney made infidelity sound like a religious experience. This song, from its storytelling to her vocals to the instruments IS a religious experience though.

**CarlieScion** (10): what a queen

**MrSwearword** (10): THIS is how you come correct with ballads, people.

**1998tweety** (9.5): The vocals on this...wow what a slay.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): mmmmm, listen to that band. Listen to that sax. Honestly you could take Whitney off this track and it would still be a total bop, but when you put her on top it’s just overkill.

**radiofan15** (9.3): cute and subdued ballad... truly suits her better than most of the material here.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): finally some iconic music

**Chevsapher** (8.9): The production is overly melodramatic for my tastes, but this song is a classic. Those soaring vocals are indescribably incredible.

**waluigiest** (8): not single…. Just saving my love

**slimboyfriend** (7): A nice paint-by-numbers 80s ballad

**vayyiqra** (6): It slightly bops but it's uninteresting.

ElectricBoogaloo41: # #9: Madonna - Burning Up

---

**Average:** 8.403 **// Total Points:** 260.5 **// Controversy:** 1.775

---

**Highest scores:**

(11 x1) radiofan15

(10 x9) 1998tweety, CarlieScion, letsallpoo, MrSwearword, phch123, rosesmp3, static\_int\_husp, vayyiqra, waluigiest

(9 x2) b\_mcq, charlixcxbox


**Lowest Scores:**

(2 x1) Ghost-Quartet


---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): One of the shorter songs of the album and Madonna's second single. Burning Up has an incredible chorus and the strings that arrive ever so often are great.

---

**radiofan15** (11): I can see Jane Fonda and other middle aged ladies dancing her ass off on an aerobics VHS tape at the rythm of this classic.

**1998tweety** (10): Every song so far has bopped so hard, I know Madonna is good but I was not expecting this

**letsallpoo** (10): a confession: i first learned of this song's existence when britney covered it for the femme fatale tour

**MrSwearword** (10): THE 39TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER which if I'm the highest score for this song, I won't be surprised because this isn't entirely viewed as essential even if it made to Celebration compilation, haters

**vayyiqra** (10): This song is so high-energy and fun. Also, that synth break is pure gold. A very underrated cut.

**waluigiest** (10): this song walked so Carly Rae Jepsen could run

**Chevsapher** (9.5): Once again, the version on Spotify definitely isn't the original mix. Weird. Anyway, the pulsing production is addictive, and Madonna's melodies are as strong as ever. The lyrics are embarrassingly on-the-nose, but in a self-aware way that was undoubtedly intentional.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Everyone’s favorite ~obscure~ Madonna song. ‘S okay...

**ImADudeDuh** (6): her weak vocals kinda evident on this song, but that chorus whew

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): jessie j's impact

**Ghost-Quartet** (2): Is she serious? This song is awful. I won’t give it a lower score because a lot of the problems I have with it are more symptomatic of the times than this specific song, but this is a capsule of what was wrong with ‘80s music. Bad lyrics that are overzealously cheesy in all the wrong ways, empty synths that plod along, singers that sound dead and unenthusiastic (I did not buy that “come on”), and an overall cheap sound.

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9): I like that Madonna's voice comes in later into the song, so we get to hear the incredible instrumental! Madonna's voice and the instrumental blend really well too.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): A certified BOP that Queen Carly Rae Jepsen sampled in Cut to the Feeling. The introduction of Madonna and her stellar album

---

**charlixcxbox** (11): Quintessential dance pop, energetic straight forward and an amazing beat with powerful lyrics

**ignitethephoenix** (10): An iconic first song from a debut album!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): fucking queen. imagine having this be your opening song on your debut, ugh the power.

**MrSwearword** (10): THE 37TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER even if I tend to prefer the other singles to her name, still worth heaping praise

**radiofan15** (10): Karly Rey Jensen's Cut to the Feeling outsold but this is still a gigantic bop.

**vayyiqra** (10): Still pop perfection. What an amazing single, and beginning to Madonna's discography.

**Chevsapher** (9.6): I've loved this song for years. It's so catchy, funky, and fun. Madonna's penchant for crafting great melodies is on full display here, and the unabashedly post-disco production packs a punch.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Wow this is a massive bop, we stan a song based off of an iconic bop anime.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9): cut to the feeling's impact

**waluigiest** (8): cut to the feeling intro lookin ass

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I had a dream, or was it real? We crossed the line and it was ON WE CROSSED THE LINE

**J\_Toe** (7): Cut to the Feeling (by CRJ) samples the intro to this song :)

**bespectacIed** (6): Love the twinkly intro but the song just fell flat to me

**Ghost-Quartet** (5.5): I can totally hear the influence that this had on songs like “Cut To The Feeling” but like… they did it better. The lyrics are really dumb.

Sweetie, we're not gonna read on dumb lyrics considering most of the Paula Abdul filler gave you everlasting life and the fact you have the gall to say Carly did *anything* better than another recording artist, let alone the Queen of Pop, MADONNA.

ElectricBoogaloo41: # #7: Madonna - Borderline

**Average:** 8.784 **// Total Points:** 272.3 **// Controversy:** 1.371

(9.7 x1) radiofan15

(9.5 x1) agentofscranton


**Lowest Scores:**

(4 x1) CarlieScion


---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): Borderline is one of my favorite Madonna songs vocal wise. The sincerity from her voice is really showing. These vocals, paired with its synth melody, would become a staple in many of Madonna's other dancepop hits. Despite (the album version) being a bit on the longer side, every second of this song feels powerful, genuine, and just fun. I think overall, this is definitely one of my favorite Madonna songs.

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic is a word I abused in this rate but is there a better word to describe half the songs here? Borderline is just so quintessentially 80s. Awesome video, too. It's on my top 3 Madonna songs.

**MrSwearword** (10): THE 14TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER be it the video version of album version. YAAAAAAS SLAY

**skargardin** (10): a goddamned classic

**vayyiqra** (10): I love this song and think it's 80s dance-pop perfection. I'm a bit confused why we're rating the extended version but still it's one of my favourite Madonna songs ever so I'm not complaining.

**radiofan15** (9.7): Rachel Berry, Finn Hudson and their mashup of this song and Open Your Heart outsold big time but this is still a gigantic bop... but still, this has no right being almost 7 minutes long.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): why the fuck is this 6 minutes long - it would've been a 10 if it wasn't so damn long

**Chevsapher** (9.1): Why is the Spotify mix seven minutes long? The actual album mix is much shorter. Anyway, this is easily the most polished and radio-friendly tracks on the album. It's not one of my favorite Madonna songs, but it's grown a lot on me. The intro has always reminded me of 90s video games, for some reason.

**slimboyfriend** (9): My mom’s favorite Madonna song, I come from a family of TASTE. Also, the GLEE mashup with Open Your Heart is so good that you forget the fact that it shouldn’t be

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is a cute lil bop

**waluigiest** (8): solange outsold

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): There are points in this song where Madonna actually sounds good! It starts really cute and I was into it for the first half. I’d give it a higher score but there’s that weirdly long, really empty instrumental break in the middle that drags the song down. In general the song feels way too long, it could easily have been cut in half. The music video basically does and it still feels too long.

**CarlieScion** (4): this has been ruined for me bc it sounds like a norwegian joke song

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): Madonna just misses the top 5 with her last song eliminated. Holiday was just outside of the top 5 for most of the rate, while her other 3 songs in the top 10 continued to rise into the top 10, leaving her with her last 4 songs being eliminated successively. With this, Madonna is now are first artist out in the rate.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): A classic song that is still played on the radio to this day. I have heard of this before but I didn't even realize that it was Madonna until I started this rate.

---

**MrSwearword** (11): THE 8TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER. This song actually sparked my return to listening to Madonna songs in general and remembering that Madonna is THAT. BITCH. in terms of absolute jams, bangers or "bops".

**vayyiqra** (11): This is one of the greatest pop songs in history and it's so good I don't even care how repetitive the lyrics are. Don't we all need a holiday? Who can relate woo~

**1998tweety** (10): I've definitely heard this a lot before, a massive bop of my childhood.

**bespectacIed** (10): Best production in the album, a club classic

**Chevsapher** (10): This track has one of the best basslines in popular music, and the song itself is exceptionally well-crafted. The breakdown is the cherry on top. The original six-minute mix has some great moments toward the end, but I prefer the beefed-up bassline in the later mixes. The various concert and mashup versions borrowing elements from “Music Sounds Better With You” are also fun.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Bop! People who can’t go on holidays are shook!

**skargardin** (10): legend

**radiofan15** (9.6): TBH I'm quite shocked Ms. Ciconne was capable of creating a Latin vibe out of such a basic back track... ugh her and her producer's minds.

**waluigiest** (9): this is such a classic dance hit

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this was iconic (obviously, cause it was in Just Dance 2) but her vocals are kinda weak on this?

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It’s alright, it’s cute, it’s fine. I don’t know what she thinks she’s doing with that bridge though. The album really starts to perk up at this point.

ElectricBoogaloo41: # Madonna

---

**Overall Average**: 7.896 **// Average Controversy:** 1.520

---

Madonna's first album is also her shortest, with 8 tracks, each with varying lengths. They all work well together atmospherically and lyrically, as they all detail Madonna's sentiment towards the person she is singing to. The album itself is really energetic and songs like Holiday and Borderline are full of positive and upbeat energy.

---
**vayyiqra** (9.500): This album was by far the thing that made me want to do this rate the most. I've loved this album every since the first time I heard it in 2016 when my best friend randomly put it on while we were working on a film project. I like all of Madonna's early work, but this is my favourite album by her. Almost every track is a banger, and it's really impressive that several of the songs were written solely by her. I never get tired of this album, and I owe Madonna for being one of the artists that got me into pop. Overall score: 9.5.

**radiofan15** (9.387): Short, sweet and to the point... some of the songs overstays their welcome, but they're still strong enough to carry on this iconic and powerful debut. [Score: A]

**Chevsapher** (9.188): "Holiday" and "Lucky Star" are both among my top ten Madonna songs. The album itself is packed with fun tracks, but I think the pieces are better than the whole.

**charlixcxbox** (8.500): In my view a horribly underrated album, with I Know It, Think of Me and Burning Up receiving barely any recognition relative to their merit

**waluigiest** (8.375): this is an exceptionally coherent and tight album.

**MrSwearword** (7.750): A pretty good album stacked with five bangin' songs and three that shouldn't be talked about.

**bespectacIed** (7.625): I wouldn't have thought this debut will produce the biggest female popstar in history, but I recognize and applaud the impact this had in pop music

**TragicKingdom1** (7.125): Probably one of the least notable Madonna albums despite being her debut. It's pretty typical post-disco 80s dance pop, with the singles being standouts and the rest being filler. You don't really learn anything about Madonna from listening to this, which is particularly odd because much of her music is dependent on her image at the time. [Grade: B]

**slimboyfriend** (7.000): I’ve only heard the singles (So like half the album) before listening to this album all the way through, and I’m shocked at how good this album is. It’s cohesive without being (too) repetitive, her voice is expressive, the lyrics aren’t terrible, it’s not too long, you can still dance to it, and it has justified hits with only one mediocre song. It’s better than anything she and many other pop stars have put out this century.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.263): In general I’ve never loved a Madonna album, but usually I find one or two songs that I connect with. I did not here. Obviously Madonna is an incredibly important and influential artist but wow was this album unremarkable, if she wins I WILL be pissed because this is far and away the worst album here. Her voice is squeaky and annoying on this album, and Paula Abdul is in this rate. Usually there’s at least smart writing and good production to back her up but both of those things are absent here, which makes me question why so many of the songs were so long.

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): I really like the instrumental. The lyrics are solid and smart as well, which is an added bonus.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7): Taylor teas with that line about snakes

---

**J\_Toe** (11): I have to thank Alaska Thunderfuck 5000 (of drag race fame) for introducing me to this song

**1998tweety** (10): I was debating giving this my 11 because of it's iconic lipsync, but it lowkey benefits from that edit cause this version drags out a bit at points. The edit has all the highlights quickly packed together so I prefer it in that sense. Of course the original is still a 10.

**agentofscranton** (10): Santana Lopez outsold

**c\_isforeirlahc** (10): heart eyes emoji

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): [this moment literally changed my life and redefined how I think about music,](https://66.media.tumblr.com/e3c8c94b961a128c61f07b8da2ac02b4/tumblr_inline_pewgyoBRbS1si4ouw_540.gif) thank you queen Paula. Am I basic gay for just giving this a ten and then not writing more? Yeah, probably.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I would thank Glee and ms Santana Lopez for introducing me to this song. An iconic performance and I would also like thank Ms Paula Abdul for giving this bop to us.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): queen of spreading out her singles and not just putting them at the front of her album!

**MrSwearword** (10): COCO vs. ALYSSA in Season 5 of Drag Race. Paula's best song/other signature provided one of the most vicious lipsyncs in herstory to its amped up production. It's ferocious as a motherfucker.

**Chevsapher** (9.1): Everyone go listen to the extended mix with the rap bits.

**bespectacIed** (9): My least favorite of the 4 number ones this album spawned but still pretty iconic and it birthed that Coco vs Alyssa showdown

**waluigiest** (9): another song that I was introduced to by a Naruto AMV

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): The line “All the world’s a candy store and he’s been trick or treatin’,” the dramatic synth solo, the “rap.”...the 80s 100 percent deserved this song.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.5): this song walked so cowboy casanova could run

**vayyiqra** (7): is this about taylor

**radiofan15** (5.7): If I keep listening to Paula Abdul's album repeatedly would every song stop sounding the same?

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): For the first few submissions of the rate, this song was in the lead with over a 10 average. It eventually fell a bit while other songs continued to rise. It constantly switched places with a few other songs in the rate, but it always retained its position in the top 5 and high average. My personal 11, Straight Up never fails to feel fresh, no matter how many times I’ve heard it. The lyrics are sharp and successive, which really adds to the song. Paula’s vocals mesh really well with the dancepop production. I’m really happy to see this song getting the recognition it did!

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5.5): A song that has surprisingly been in the top 5 since the beginning, I dont really see why it was rated so why becausse its really just samey. Maybe that says something about Paula if this is her highest rated song in this rate

---

**c\_isforeirlahc** (11): I know it's hashtag illegal for me to not include a comment but I should not have to justify this. Easily the best song in the rate.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): literally iconic in every sense of the word holy fucking shit. she did not have to snap but her man was playing runaround so i guess she really DID have to! UGH!!!!!!!!

**letsallpoo** (11): better than every song by the beatles combined

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): people really wanna be out here saying j cole went platinum with no features when his entire career was built on the foundation of this woman's pop perfection boppery... yeah i said it

**TragicKingdom1** (11): absolute classic and one of the best songs of the 80s. the "lurking" tone of the beat throughout the whole song really fits the lyrics (similar to TLC's Creep) and there's too many hooks to count

**1998tweety** (10): A MASSIVE and iconic bop. Deserved all the success it got and more.

**bespectacIed** (10): It pained me so much that I couldn't give it an 11. 80s perfection. Amazing. Stunning. Well-produced. Slutty. Angsty. One of the best pop songs of all time. One of the best drag race lip syncs of all time

**MrSwearword** (10): RAJA vs. Carmen in Season 3 of Drag Race. Also, this song is considered Paula's signature and with good reason.

**Chevsapher** (9.8): Out of all the songs on this album, this one has the most enduring appeal. This degree of polish and cohesion is hard to find.

**radiofan15** (9.1): Knowing absolutely anything about Paula's discography my guess is that this was a single and the biggest hit of the album... if I'm wrong, it truly deserved better... if I'm right, then shame on Paula for not putting the same effort in the rest of her material.

**waluigiest** (9): my original comment was “current mood” but since then we were straight up and it worked thanks paula :-)

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): No explanation needed.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I find the clashing instrumental to be a little grating, it’s really good but I can’t listen to it on repeat or anything like that.

**vayyiqra** (8): This is 80s pop cheese perfection. Why not an 10 then? Idk, just to be contrarian I guess. This is going to be in the top 5 whatever I rate it anyway. Side note: the horns are a really nice touch.

ElectricBoogaloo41: # Forever Your Girl

---

**Overall Average**: 7.635 **// Average Controversy:** 1.457

---

 Forever Your Girl, for me, is strong from start to finish. You can really feel the story progressing from The Way That You Love Me to One or the Other. There are really sentimental parts of this album, such as I Need You and Forever Your Girl, but the more confrontational tracks (Cold Hearted and One or the Other) help create a great contrast that gives the listener an insight on what Adbul is feeling in the moment. Adbul's voice and the instrumentals work well together to create a story with plenty of bops along the way.

---
**Chevsapher** (9.190): This is one of my favorite albums ever. The production is incredible; I'm always amazed that the album was created with as low a budget as it was. Paula's vocals are easily the weakest in the rate, but she sings with enough charisma to keep the album interesting.

**bespectacIed** (8.550): The BEST album in this rate and one of the best pop albums of all time, its production is just chef's kiss. Deserved its immense success and multiple #1s yet still highly underrated.

**TragicKingdom1** (8.250): The best album in this rate imo, Paula makes up for her lack of vocal chops by giving a blend of pop and new jack swing that has aged much better than anything else here. I'm not sure there was much room to evolve from here, which is probably why she was only a superstar for another era after this, but she deserves to be remembered for more than just American Idol based on this album alone. [Grade: A-]

**c\_isforeirlahc** (8.200): This is one of my all-time favourite albums anyway, every song (bar maybe two) is a BOP. Obsessed.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.910): This was the only album I had listened to before the rate and I assumed it would steamroll everything, and while the other albums definitely turned out better than I expected I still rate this as a very good album. I really think Paula’s musical output is underrated, it’s just sheer fun. Even if she’s not the strongest singer she made up for it with a complete lack of shame and willingness to get weird with her music, something I think we need more of today.

**waluigiest** (7.700): I think the sounds are sooooo cheesy on this album but a lot of them still work.

**vayyiqra** (7.000): I'd never listened to Paula Abdul of my own free will and just knew her as that judge on American Idol who was big in the 80s and had a mysteriously Arabic-sounding name. (She's Mizrahi, who are kind of like Arabized Jews.) I liked this album the second-most of the four in this rate, probably not enough to listen to it regularly but it's still fun and has little filler. Overall score: 7.0.

**MrSwearword** (6.800): The album isn't terrible but holy shit is the singles vs. album track gap HUGE.

**slimboyfriend** (6.600): She had some bops on her hands, but she also had some filler too. I don’t know if it’s just my millennial/Gen Z attention span speaking, but all of these songs are nearly twice as long as they need to be. I usually love big kitschy 80s pop songs, but the non-standout songs make this album sound dated in the worst way a pop album can.

**radiofan15** (6.270): Having only heard one Paula song, once, in my entire life, I wasn't sure what to expect from this album... what I got was generic 80s electro-pop, nothing that I truly hated but nothing that I truly liked (expect for one song each)... at least Ms. Plane Crash Survivor still have all of that sweet American Idol money to survive. [Score: C]

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): One of the most viewed 80s YouTube videos, a song referenced countless times,  and a song referenced countless times. Girls Just Want to Have Fun was Lauper's breakthrough hit, peaking at #2 on the Hot 100 and making the top 10 on numerous charts. Wikipedia also states that it has been covered by over 30 artists, which is an incredible feat. A dancepop staple, GJWTHF has been cited as a woman empowerment anthem, by Lauper and numerous critics.  Lauper's unique vocals are perfect for the incredibly catchy chorus, while the synthpop production feels timeless. But this song has way more than the instrumental and vocals. Well-placed backup vocals, well-written and fun lyrics, and a powerful message turns this song into one hell of a song. For all of these reasons, this song just sneaks itself into the top 3.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): Lit rally a classique. As critical I am of cyndi, this is amazing. The guitar and the production actually complements her voice and really snapped in having one of the most memorable and iconic songs of the decade.

---

**DrunkHurricane** (11): a fun and iconic bop

**bespectacIed** (10): Impossible to hate. One of the key music videos of the 80s. Invented having fun. Girls only knew how to pout and be angry before this was released

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Legendary song. Can confirm because I am a girl.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): obviously pretty iconic

**MrSwearword** (10): Cyndi Lauper's GOAT. This is not up for discussion.

**radiofan15** (10): You know songs like that... they are STORIES that people can IDENTIFY with... I mean anybody, children will be singing this song at graduations... at weddings... at funerals...

**rosesmp3** (10): THE original bop, love the third verse

**skargardin** (10): Classic fun-filled bop, what else is there to say

**slimboyfriend** (10): Girls don’t want to be oppressed under patriarchy, they just want to have fun!!

**Chevsapher** (9.8): A classic. The production is extremely busy, the synths are wacky, and what even is that solo instrument? But it all works together so incredibly well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I hope whoever came up with the idea to do that marimba sounding synth solo got their dick sucked. This song is such a crowd pleaser, it goes off at a party or at a concert, but when I just sit down and listen to it it loses some of that power.

**vayyiqra** (8): THEY JUST WANNA wow I can't believe Cyndi Lauper invented sex-positive working-class feminism in 1983 what an intersectional queen. Seriously though, even though I don't love it exactly this is a great song and deserved to be a huge hit.

**waluigiest** (8): the little ping pong instrumental break after the first chorus? that’s the juice

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): honestly this is pretty overrated, i just don't find it that catchy? i get why it's such a gay anthem though

**CarlieScion** (2): god. i hate this so much. i used to like it so much, but it sounds like nails on a chalkboard now

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): One of the slower songs of Lauper's album, this song was her first #1 hit on the Hot 100 chart. Like many of the other songs on She's So Unusual, this song's production is accompanied by synth notes and unique guitar strings. Wikipedia uses the word "jangly," which I think is perfect for describing the production. Lyrically, the song is about always being there for somebody, even if the two are far apart. I think that this is a really great ballad, and it successfully shows off Lauper's versatility as an artist. The song takes components of her dance-pop songs and uses them to create a powerful ballad, which I think is very creative.

---

**bbfan132** (11): everything about this song is perfect. the guitars in the background, cyndi’s mellowed out voice, the lyrics, the production in general, just everything…. we have to stan

**rosesmp3** (11): wiping my tears off the keyboard as i type this comment tbh

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This is THE 80s synth pop song. Say what you want about Madonna being an icon in her pop niche, or Whitney's amazing voice, or Paula's... something. But none of the other songs in the rate so thoroughly define the sound of a subgenre of pop that is still relevant today. Whether you look at Robyn in 2010 or Taylor Swift today, this songs influence is still felt. It's just that iconic.

**waluigiest** (11): watch Episode 1 of The Gay and Wondrous Life of Caleb Gallo on YouTube

**agentofscranton** (10): i wish i was a teenager so i could fantasize about having my first kiss at prom to this song, now i have to fantasize about hooking up at an office christmas party

**bespectacIed** (10): Literally invented time, humans lived in a limbo devoid of rhyme and reason before this was released I think

**ImADudeDuh** (10): pensive

**MrSwearword** (10): the sappiest song that actually sounds good and deserves the praise it gets

**Chevsapher** (9.7): Easily one of the best-written songs in this rate. It feels so heartfelt and sincere. The percussion has not aged well, but a good song transcends dated production.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Iconic song. It has withstood life time after time after time.

**radiofan15** (9.5): Cheesy 80s ballad with a killer chorus but sometimes lots of cheese it's what the doctor ordered so i'm fine with it.

**1998tweety** (9): Oh wow I've heard this plenty of times before, a slay.

**J\_Toe** (9): Napoleon Dynamite absolutely slaps

**CarlieScion** (8): this sounds like bette davis eyes

**vayyiqra** (8): I don't like ballads much as a rule, but this is a classic, and the prechorus alone is just such ear candy that I have to rate it highly.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I was never REALLY a fan of this song, but I can’t deny it’s güd. Her voice is also noticeably softer and vulnerable here.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I’ll be honest, I’ve always found this song kind of annoying. Usually I like Cyndi’s voice but she sounds like she’s choking here and the melody of this song moves at such an awkward tempo. It’s like it’s moving at 1.25x speed and always half a beat ahead of itself. Mariah sampled this for a song on *Memoirs Of An Imperfect Angel*, which is my favorite Mariah album, but incidentally the song is my least favorite song on there.

ElectricBoogaloo41: # She's So Unusual

---

**Overall Average**: 7.321 **// Average Controversy:** 1.946

---

 Cyndi Lauper combines her unique voice with synth-based instrumentals to create a very unique-sounding project in She's So Unusual. The messages are strong and her delivery of the album's themes only reinforce them. Songs like Girls Just Want To Have Fun still sound fresh and are still exciting to listen to with each listen. Even in the album's ballads, Lauper is able to incorporate the synth-instrumental her dance hits use to further the album's individuality.

---
**Chevsapher** (8.744): This rate gave me a reason to finally listen to this album from start to finish. Cyndi's songwriting and unique vocals really shine here. The quality drops off a bit toward the end, but overall, it's a great pop album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.222): I really had Cyndi underrated. I’ve always held something of a vendetta against her because she won the 2013 Tony Award for Best Original Score for her work on *Kinky Boots*, which upset me because I thought all of the other shows had better music (Tim Minchin was robbed) but you know what… maybe she is talented? Her vocals on this album are insane in the best way, I really appreciated how crackers she goes here.

**slimboyfriend** (7.944): I heard this album was supposed to be good, I just didn’t know HOW good. Growing up, I never thought of Cyndi Lauper as someone who made very impactful music until I listened to this album. She straddles the world of punky New Wave rock and pure pop so naturally here. Every song sounds like an authentic extension of the strong-willed, independent [and… unusual] woman that she presents as. I think this album paved the way for any mainstream or mainstream-adjacent pop girl to use their offbeat quirkiness as an advantage in their music.

**bespectacIed** (7.722): Legendaric new wave/pop album but very filler-filled especially the side two

**MrSwearword** (7.556): The hits are here and the album isn't that bad, bar that one awful as fuck song. Consistency matters y'all

**radiofan15** (7.233): She can's sing for shit, her career flopped after an era but the production in her music is actually good and her songwriting skills are impressive... is Cindy Lauper the 80s version of Charli XCX? [Score: B-]

**agentofscranton** (6.722): if only I loved the album itself as much as I love it's title

**vayyiqra** (6.667): I have never really fucked with Cyndi Lauper's music aside from a few singles that everyone knows (all of which are on this album). While they are all great songs, the rest of this album felt bland and fillerish which dragged it down. I think she just isn't an album-based artist. Anyway, it still has redeeming qualities. It's very theatrical and campy, so I understand why she is a gay icon, but it's not really my thing. Overall score: 6.7

**charlixcxbox** (6.556): This album drops off a cliff for me about half way through, but I was really impressed by the consistency of the first half

**waluigiest** (5.556): she didn’t need to release this whole album…. Just drop Time After Time and leave…..

**TragicKingdom1** (4.222): I'm honestly floored by how bad this is. Cyndi reminds me a lot of Katy Perry in the sense that she has a really unique voice that only fits really specific styles of music, and this album showcases none of them! Every song that remotely work does so in spite of Cyndi's horrible squawking, and the almost rock-infused delivery that she takes on in the latter half of the album is truly unbearable. This does not hold up whatsoever. [Grade: D]

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (11): Girl I hear something and it SLAPS. The vocals and the saxaphone, just great. The best song on this album and this rate for me personally. This is Whitney at her best, she already delivers iconic vocals and the production and lyrics showcase that perfecty. A classic and amazing bop that is timeless.

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): The third single of Houston's self-titled debut is the winner of our rate!This synthy dance-pop song is one of the faster songs on the album. It's incredible chorus, once again backed up by Houston's powerful vocals, utilizes a combination of synths and drums to really give the song it's dancepop feel. As Houston has more slower songs compared to the other albums, I think this song comes in at the perfect time. At first, Straight Up was in the lead, but once this took the top position, it barely budged. It kept a 10+ average throughout most of the rate and has the highest average of any song ever rated! It also was extremely uncontroversial and had the most 11s of the rate.

---

**1998tweety** (11): WOW this song is so so good and relatable. The vocals are amazing as always, but the production and lyrics measure up too. That sax solo too....ugh

**agentofscranton** (11): the best song in this rate and it's not even close - whitney really had the 80s gays by the throat with her dance bops huh

**b\_mcq** (11): mood or whatever the kids are saying ps I'm 21

**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): This has got to be the most innocent love song ever made and I love it

**bespectacIed** (11): The second most joyous song of the 80s, only beaten by Whitney herself with I Wanna Dance With Somebody. How many pop girls henceforth have been inspired by this preppy cheesy hopeless romantic gargantuan of a crush anthem? I am gushing and rambling because this is 80s pop music distilled to its essence that Whitney (and madge) has mastered: fun, catchy, simple, about love, inspiring, danceable, AMAZING

**CarlieScion** (11): this is an explosion of pure happiness

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This song is so good ugh. The easiest standout of the album! Whitney needed more bops like this on here!

**JunkyGS** (11): Look up the acapella vocals for this song to be fucking blown away at some of the most perfect vocals ever! The tone, range and pitch omg..... Also fun fact the song was created solely for Janet but her management passed on it thinking it wasn't as strong as the other songs on her album (lol.) This was Pre-Control Era Janet with her dad as her management so....

**sailormunelune** (11): How Will I Know is a quintessential pop song. From the spunky production to the power vocals, it's an irresistible classic that never grows old. Miss Whitney really did that.

**skargardin** (11): This is gay culture, I love this song so much and the video is also so ridiculosuly cute.

**slimboyfriend** (11): Whitney Houston knows my emotionally stunted gay heart.

**charlixcxbox** (10): Easily in the top 3 of all the songs across these albums

**Chevsapher** (10): Amazing vocals? Check. Energetic synthesizers? Check. Catchy melodies? Check. Fun lyrics? Check. Killer bridge? Check. This song is easily one of the best of its time.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ugh my second choice for an 11 tbh

**J\_Toe** (10): This is the kind of music I love from Whitney. I just wish Dance with Somebody and So Emotional could have been on this album :(

**MrSwearword** (10): a classic Whitney song that deserves the praise

**vayyiqra** (10): I swear I have heard that percussion sound in the intro sampled so many times, and I have no idea what it even is let alone where it's from. Anyway, this song absolutely slaps. I forgot she even did this song and was not expecting it to be on this album, so it's a welcome break from the dull ballads. This is the good kind of 80s cheese. :kimbryell:

**waluigiest** (10): excellent..... and how WILL I know?

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is a great song (I mean, it must be) but honestly I’ve never liked it all that much. It just sounds cheap, and not even the normal ‘80s cheap. I also don’t really buy this sort of innocent bashfulness from Whitney, it feels out of place even at this age. But it’s still a fun pop song!

**radiofan15** (8.3): A Capella version outsold but this generic take is fine too...

ElectricBoogaloo41: # Whitney Houston

---

**Overall Average**: 7.415 **// Average Controversy:** 1.692

---

 With a combination of ballads and dance songs, Whitney Houston made a name for herself with this album. Her strong vocals were present through the entire album, with each song being a great display of her incredible ability to hit and hold notes. The featured artists on the album have voices that work really well alongside Houston's, which only strengthens the album. I really like that Houston was able to find the right balance between ballads and faster songs in not only this album, but in every project she would work on afterwards.

---
**bespectacIed** (9.200): I am a huge whitneynator and a worshipper of R&B so yes I am biased. It's not a fluke that this is the then-biggest debut album of a solo female performer, one of the highest selling female albums of the decade, and spawned 3 #1s that all became classics. Her vocals is only rivaled by Mariah in the all of music, but I'd argue this is THE better self-titled debut.

**Chevsapher** (8.510): Whitney's vocals are easily the best in the rate, but so many tracks on this album failed to make a lasting impression on me. Ballads just aren't my cup of tea. With that said, "Greatest Love of All" finally clicked for me, and discovering "Thinking About You" and "All at Once" made listening through the album worth my time.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.950): I actually kind of thought that this album had the smartest writing of all three albums. It also felt like it was the most mature, which is odd because I think Whitney is the youngest one? The tracks have issues standing out from each other but they’re still consistently good, and do unfold themselves on a closer listen.

**waluigiest** (7.700): she’s iconic. I wouldn’t replay a lot of the ballads but still. Amazing songwriting and melodies here

**charlixcxbox** (6.500): I hate to say it but I find this album incredibly boring - How Will I Know is flawless but the other tracks don't compare

**MrSwearword** (6.300): A classic case of solid ballads but with album cuts that have really weak and subpar production choices that really fuck with talented singers the hardest.

**TragicKingdom1** (5.950): I question the inclusion of this album in the rate considering most of it is ballads that focus on Whitney's voice, but it was such a monumental debut I can look past that. That being said, the reason it was so massive was because of that series of #1 singles, because clearly the rest of the album was not any pulling any weight, with every other song being some flavor of boring filler. I was let down because this doesn't feel like any sort of artistic statement, and honestly Whitney had better singles later in her career anyways. [Grade: C+]

**vayyiqra** (5.900): I was dreading rating this album and so I put it off for days, maybe weeks after doing the other three. I've never been very interested in Whitney's music despite knowing what a great singer she was. It turned out I was right, and this was by far my least favourite album in this rate, and it was so different from the other three I feel that it shouldn't have been in the rate at all. There were a few enjoyable tracks, and one great song ("How Will I Know") but a lot of what I would think of as filler. It was just underwhelming, and a lot of it was samey, so it wasn't the strongest debut. What can I say? Popheads hate ballads. Overall: 5.9

**radiofan15** (5.680): Voice of gold but drowned by recycled-quality cooper material. [Score: C-]

**J\_Toe** (5.300): kinda wish we got to rate her second album, but that would go against the whole debut theme.

1998tweety: The only black woman in the rate winning and achieving the highest rated song of all time? Perhaps popheads has some taste.

amumumyspiritanimal: Sadly didn't had time to do this rate no matter how badly I wanted, but Whitney getting the first better-than-perfect song is truly what she deserves. Forever an icon in our hearts.

waluigiest: The top 2 were clearly the best songs in the rate to me and I went back and forth on where to put my 11. Ultimately I went with Time After Time, but I’m so happy with how it turned out. Whitney deserved :-)

Thanks for hosting!
