https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/c8hfds/80s_dancepop_debuts_rate/

Cher, Janet Jackson, NSYNC, and Kylie Minogue. What do they all have in common? Well, they're not in this rate, BUT! they are just four of the many artists who have released major dance-pop hits. Dance-pop is a subgenre said to have been established in the 80s. This is especially backed up by the legendary artists of the 80s that introduced the genre. Four of these artists, Paula Adbul, Cyndi Lauper, Madonna, and Whitney Houston, WILL be rated! Their debuts contained innovative dance-pop tracks that would be remembered for years!

# **Paula Abdul - Forever Your Girl**
Released in 1988, Paula Adbul’s Forever Your Girl turned the choreographer into a household name and dancepop sensation. With #1 singles on the Billboard Hot 100, the album became the most successful debut of its time. The album’s legacy is still very visible. It ranks at #10 on the All-Time Albums Chart for women on the BB200, and placed within the top ten of two year-end album charts (1989 and 1990). It also reached number one in Canada’s and Australia’s respective album charts. It is currently 7x Platinum in the US and remains a staple 80s album.
 
With the release of her album, however, Adbul didn’t forget her background in choreography and dance. The album has a multitude of dance hits. Furthermore, music videos for the album, such as “Straight Up,” showcased the artist’s incredible dance skills and earned her an award for choreography at the 1989 MTV Awards.

# **Madonna - Madonna**
Before Madonna set out to achieve an incredible record string of Top 5 hits and establish herself as the Skinny Legend that will later influence many of your faves, she released her debut, self-titled dancepop album. With the lead single, “Everybody,” being a large success for the singer, she immediately worked off of that success, releasing “Burning Up” and then the album itself. At 8 tracks, Madonna is the shortest album of the rate track-wise, but with a mixture of different lengths and unique instrumental choices for each individual song, Madonna’s self-titled left a giant legacy and served as the perfect view into the music for which she would be known for years to come. The album itself is very diverse. Songs like “Borderline” and “Holiday” showcase Madonna’s strongly sincere and passionate vocals while introducing Madonna as a dancepop powerhouse. 


Many of the singles are still known today and would be an inspiration for many dancepop artists of the 80s and 90s. A foundation for a star being born and the establishment of a main pop girl that would inspire many of your faves. Although the album did not peak as high as the others in this rate, the legacy this album left is definitely visible.

# **She’s So Unusual - Cyndi Lauper**


Before the massive success of the album’s lead single, “Girls Just Want to Have Fun,” Lauper released her true to form debut album, She’s So Unusual. The synth-based dancepop album showcases the uniqueness that made Lauper one of the most discussed newcomers of the 80s. One of the most interesting components of the album, Lauper’s vocals, would be discussed alongside the perfect balance of synthpop and pop rock found within the album.

# **Whitney Houston - Whitney Houston**
The album with the most ballads of the rate ~~that this sub will pay dust if you cant dance to it~~, Whitney Houston’s 1985 self-titled debut would be the world’s first glimpse at not only the artist’s incredible vocals, but also her incredible versatility as an artist. While *You Give Good Love* and *Saving All My Love for You*  would show Whitney’s impeccable ability to take on powerful notes that she would become known for (“I Will Always Love You” and “I Have Nothing”), the synth-filled spectacular of “How Will I Know” would also showcase her ability as a dazzling dancepop singer that would lead to (“I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)” and “I’m Every Woman”). 


Interestingly, the album. The legacies of this album and Whitney Houston herself are present in the music world even today.

# **The Rules**


- Rate every song with a score between **1 and 10**. You may also give **one song each**, either an **11** or a **0**. **For your 11 / 0 to count, please leave a comment with the song** (the formatting for which can be found below).


* Rate every song with a score between **1 and 10**. You may give one song a **ZERO**, and 1 song an **ELEVEN**. You may use up to one decimal place in your scores, any more will crash the program. If you do use anymore decimal places, we reserve the right to round up or down as appropriate.


- Be sure to use the prepared link to send in your scores. It is important that ballots are correctly organized so scores can easily be recorded. 


- If you need to change scores for any songs after submitting, feel free to DM one of us with the songs whose scores you wish to change and their new scores.


- Try not to rate albums with a super low average, as there is a **predetermined threshold average for each album**, that must be met.


- To add comments to either a song or album, do the following:


 >She Bop: 10 I Bop, You Bop, He She Me Bop, Bop, Bopping, Boppology, the study of Bop


 >Album: Madonna: Inspired I’m Lindana and I Wanna Have Fun


- The following formats, and any formats besides what is written above, are **INCORRECT, and should NOT BE USED.**


 >She Bop: 10 - I Bop, You Bop, He She Me Bop, Bop, Bopping, Boppology, the study of Bop


 >She Bop: I Bop, You Bop, He She Me Bop, Bop, Bopping, Boppology, the study of Bop 10


 >She Bop: (10) I Bop, You Bop, He She Me Bop, Bop, Bopping, Boppology, the study of Bop
