MrSwearword: Knowing Day 2 of rates tend to be messy hell ground zero, I'm gonna generously guess it's a 2:3:3:2 ratio split like so:

PAULA is gonna be left with Straight Up and Cold Hearted

MADONNA is gonna be left with Holiday, Lucky Star and Borderline

CYNDI is gonna be left with Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Time After Time and She Bop

WHITNEY is gonna be left with Saving All My Love for You and Greatest Love of All

No telling what the fuck is gonna actually happen but the MESS will be real

ElectricBoogaloo41: # #23: Paula Adbul - Knocked Out

**Lowest Scores:**

(4.5 x1) b\_mcq


---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (5): Why is this so long, this is going to knock me out. A domestic abuse anthem?

---


##TKO!
**Chevsapher** (8.7): This track has grown a lot on me since I first heard it. The hook does its job and the bassline is solid, but the most enjoyable part is definitely the bridge.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Bop

**vayyiqra** (8): I love the intro to this. This weird, heavily synthetic kind of beat is better than PC music any day. Every other single on this album got to at least #3 while this one only got to #41, but it deserved better.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the intro sounds like if SOPHIE made music that was listenable

**waluigiest** (7): “love TKO” and the following guitar interlude is really nice, the rest is eh


##TK-NO!
**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): There’s a good concept of a song here, but it isn’t executed as good as it should be

**radiofan15** (6.5): Is there a reason why all of the drums in her songs sounds the same?

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.4): Eh, of all the songs on this album I’d say this is the most “filler.” It’s just a bunch of ‘80s sounds, it’s a cliche more than a song.

**MrSwearword** (6): boring track to follow an admittedly languid opener

**slimboyfriend** (6): This is THE definition of mall-core. Paula bringing out my inner Maxxionista

ElectricBoogaloo41: # #22: Cyndi Lauper - She Bop

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): Lauper's vocals really shine here. They make the chorus super exciting. The "I hope he will understand" part sounds sooo good, and I look forward to hearing it each time I listen to this song. This reached #3 on the Billboard Hot 100 and the Top 10 of a number of charts, and was one of Lauper's more successful singles.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4): A song about conjugation and masturbation at the same time. A song where she lists every tense before bop and implied masturbation and perhaps dancing. Whatever she tried to do, it didnt work, and its a messy song overall.

---

##SHE BOP!

**MrSwearword** (10): holy shit, first time listening to this song [don't ask why] but THIS is the masturbation jam she's famous for? WERK BITCH, this is an energetic as hell song.

**Chevsapher** (8.8): That chorus pops into my head at the most inopportune times.

**1998tweety** (8): The chorus of this song be like: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=--hsVknT1c0

**bespectacIed** (8): "Oop she bop"

**ImADudeDuh** (8): i think we ALL bop!

**slimboyfriend** (8): Ms. Cyndi INVENTED masturbation. Without her..... where would we be??

**vayyiqra** (8): I can't believe Cyndi Lauper invented female masturbation and also I can't believe there are still people who don't know what this song is about when the music video (which is hilarious) still exists. There is a long tradition of pop songs about masturbation (I Touch Myself, Darling Nikki, Pictures of Lily, Body of My Own) but this is the peak of masturbation songs. As a song I don't love it, but it deserves credit for that.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): If you don’t play MMMBop in the plug, I’m going to be disappointed

**radiofan15** (6.5): How original it would be to comment that "this kinda bops"...?

##she stop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Did she just invent the word bop? Damn these albums really were influential. I don’t know if “bop” is the right word for this song though. Sometimes quirky is too quirky.

**J\_Toe** (6): is this where the term came from?

**waluigiest** (5): this is pretty saucy. But it also sounds bad.

**CarlieScion** (4): does she really tho

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/277554530294431744/594919606242508801/i_B3_P20i2_SGu9_O.gif

---

**bespectacIed** (10): Diana Ross in a golden sparkly gold gown at the 1987 American Music Awards, introducing Whitney as the next performer wearing a white pantsuit white white stilletos combo in her signature poofy hairdo holding a white microphone. Bodying this song. THAT, is the most beautiful live performance of a song of all time.

**CarlieScion** (10): you are the one i have been dreaming of! king! of! my! heart! body! and! soul!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): The juxtaposition of putting this after “How Will I Know…” Apparently this was a single but it doesn’t seem to have a music video, [but the single art](https://images.rapgenius.com/ef81d4f97317b319a909db728cff34de.284x284x1.jpg) really makes me wish that it did. I think this ended up being my favorite song from the album, it really shows the power of this kind of melodramatic ‘80s style. Everything is so damn serious, it’s almost ridiculous but the sheer power of it keeps you from laughing. It makes me nostalgic, both for this kind of music and for my long lost love. Maybe I’m just a slut for broken hearts. The lyrics are great and this is one of the best choruses on the album.

**Chevsapher** (8.7): This song has a certain Disney quality that I enjoy, and the production has aged surprisingly well (at least compared to the rest of the album). Overall, this is one of the album's better slow songs.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is nice, but I wish it had a little more of a kick in it. The key change at the end was nice though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): The harmonies though!

**MrSwearword** (8): I'll allow something boring to pass only because at least there's some force in Whitney strong enough to break through the fog of bullshit that is this production.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the production on this makes it sound like the karaoke version of itself

**skargardin** (6): filler

**waluigiest** (6): again not an unpleasant ballad but also not interesting

**vayyiqra** (5): Oh, we're back to the sappy ballads again. I feel nothing for this so it gets a 5.

**radiofan15** (4.4): I just don't care at this point... kill this album please!

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): The synths here sound really pretty! I really like the transition from the intro synths to the chorus as well.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (6): I can't decide if I like this or not, cause I think it works at times but just when it gets good, it disappoints me

---

##Up All Night

**1998tweety** (10): The Riverdale cover of this was a big slay so I'm giving this a good score.

**b\_mcq** (10): omg the synths at the start

**Chevsapher** (9): Lyrically and melodically, this is one of the best songs on the album. The bridge is a bit grating, but apart from that, the arrangement is fabulous, especially the arpeggiating chimes.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I had no clue this was Cyndi Lauper! Definitely have heard it before.

**radiofan15** (8.2): I hate her voice but she has a decent ear for melodies and is quite charismatic so I can let it slide... also, that synth solo is fucking everything!

**slimboyfriend** (8): omg I wasn’t paying attention and that synth solo scared me when it came in.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): It’s good but doesn’t inspire. I do like how twinkly and soft it is.

##Good Night

**bespectacIed** (6): Love the tears for fears-ish intro but kinda boring

**MrSwearword** (6): it's fine but I can do without it, to be honest

**vayyiqra** (6): It's kind of cute, but it's not holding up well on a second listen. The arpeggiated melody is kind of neat, and there is a kind of bizarre and random keyboard break which is different if nothing else. I'm surprised this was apparently a big hit, and also that it was written as an acoustic song.

**skargardin** (4): She sounds really bad on this track, at least the synths are cute.

**waluigiest** (4): the vocals and the instrumental are fighting

---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): The synths and the vocals jumped out

---

**skargardin** (9): another absolute classic

**Chevsapher** (8.8): The ad-libs are great, and the sax solo is a highlight.

**radiofan15** (8.6): Kinda generic and forgettable but it's still catchy and charming enough to leave an impression... also, we need more pop songs with sax solos.

**1998tweety** (8.5): The og sax solo (prob not but I'm saying it anyway); Gaga, Katy, and Carly are shook!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): This actually isn’t bad.

**vayyiqra** (8): Even though it isn't one of my favourites on the album it's really catchy and often gets stuck in my head.

**waluigiest** (8): this is wet

**slimboyfriend** (7): I’m surprised I found a better-than-decent deep cut on this album

**ImADudeDuh** (5): abrasive a bit, but the piano line is cute

**Lowest Scores:**

(4 x1) b\_mcq

---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.5): A dance bop that would go off in the club playing in the background

---

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ok she snapped

**waluigiest** (9): yo this is sweaty and sexy

**Chevsapher** (8.6): The chorus is a bit week, but those disco guitars make up for it.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A lot of these songs are similar sounding but they're all bops so I'm not complaining.

**vayyiqra** (8): This might sound weird, but all of the instrumental tracks on this album remind me heavily of the soundtrack to a Sega Genesis game, and I'm not mad. This bops. [Adding a point for the lol-worthy line "make me come ... alive". However, note that Madonna sang the line "a chemical reaction" five years before on her debut.]

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.2): It’s music that’s trying really hard to sound fresh and modern that ages the worst. That makes it sound like I don’t like this, but really it’s just fine. It’s got a good chorus and some memorable moments but more than a lot of songs on Paula’s album the dated sound holds me back from liking it.

**bespectacIed** (7): hoe anthem

**radiofan15** (6.2): SHOUTING OUT LOUD THE SONG'S TITLE IN THE CHORUS DOESN'T MAKE IT MEMORABLE AND CATCHY PAULA!

**slimboyfriend** (5): It just sounds like the 3 songs before it, but even more watered down

**MrSwearword** (3): subpar and inconsequential trash

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): The opener of Whitney's debut album immediately gives us a look into the great vocals that follow in each and every song! This is a really nice track and I like the background vocals.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): The first track of Whitneys debut album showcases everything about this album, the amazing vocals, the smooth production, and the timeless lyricism. The first time I heard ths, the power her voice, the TALENT, left me shhok and wigless like her on the cover

---

**b\_mcq** (10): this was alllllllmost my 11 :'(

**bespectacIed** (10): Ethereal vocals unmatched in the industry, of course whitney kickstarts her career with a sexy, vocal FLEX of a ballad. To quote this song, "So good, so good, woooAaaoooh"

**1998tweety** (8): This is a cute opener

**waluigiest** (8): gorgeous 80s ballad this works well

**Chevsapher** (7.5): A decently good song with decently good production. Whitney's vocals are the best part by far.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): It’s decent but a little boring

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.3): A solid start to the album, right off the bad they hit us with those silky vibes and that *voice*. I love that the verses are like, three lines but because of how Whitney sings them they feel so much longer. It’s a somewhat unremarkable song but Whitney and the production bring such romance to it.

**slimboyfriend** (7): Whitney does ballads like nobody else…. I’m just not a big fan of ballads

**radiofan15** (6.7): Damn Mariah is... doing fine and completely unbothered...

**vayyiqra** (6): Starting an album with a ballad is always a weird choice, but I do kind of like the "quiet storm" sound (one of my favourite genre names ever). I just wish it had a little more energy.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): kinda boring tbh

**MrSwearword** (5): a solid opener, but this bores me

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.5): Slayyyter teas with the sultry voice at the beginning

---

**MrSwearword** (10): THE 38TH GREATEST MADONNA SONG EVER. Granted, you need to be in the right 80s mood to truly enjoy it but once you do or develop it, it shall snatch your wig clean off.

**radiofan15** (10): A classic bop... maybe a little bit too fucking long but still a bop.

**vayyiqra** (10): This is pure dance-pop fun. Also, stream "The Greatest Hit" by Annie which samples this song and is also a bop.

**Chevsapher** (8.9): Perhaps this song isn't objectively good, but vapid club music is my guilty pleasure. Besides, the melodies are great.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.1): I like this one, it has a lot more personality than the other tracks on the album. Her vocals have some spunk here that I believe, though she starts to sound like a child towards the end there.

**1998tweety** (8): Another bop, but it doesn't really hold up to the rest of the album and it's also weak for a closer.

**bespectacIed** (8): I read on wikipedia that Madge was mistaken as black due to this song lmao dunno why it made me holler

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): This was obviously made for the club because it’s too long

**waluigiest** (6): starts really strong but doesn’t keep the energy

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9.5): The opener to Forever Your Girl, The Way That You Love Me is pretty interesting. I really like Paula's voice in this one, and the pre-chorus + chorus are great!

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): A bop thru and thru, a great opener for the album. Paula slays with the infectious beat and vocals. One of the best songs in the album and the rate

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a bop but that drum sound that goes through the whole song gets anno oh shit there's a guitar solo? we fucking stan

**Chevsapher** (9.7): Slick production, a great bassline, vivid imagery, catchy melodies... this is easily one of the best songs in Paula's discography.

**bespectacIed** (9): love the funky AND rock production, what a great opener

**c\_isforeirlahc** (9): WHAT A FUCKING OPENER. Paula did not come to play huh

**1998tweety** (8.5): A bop of an opener

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.3): And she exits the gates like a cannonball. I love the cheekiness of this song. Like, the lyrics are saying one thing, but something about the music is telling me something else! The lyrics say “I don’t care about money” but that kick drum says “but you’re still paying.”

**waluigiest** (8): finesse this rich man, but for love. yes anti-capitalist paula

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Gives me MJ+Madonna vibes here.

**radiofan15** (7.3): Cute song... but we need Paula to stop singing this song through a fan...

**MrSwearword** (7): a good opener but a lesser of the hits/songs to Paula's name.

**slimboyfriend** (7): “It ain’t your 90 foot….. YACHT” Great, but it’s like 2 minutes too long. Like YES we know it’s not the money OR the diamond ring OR the Mazerati OR the house on the hill OR the trips to Brazil OR

**vayyiqra** (7): Wtf this bassline slaps. This is the kind of 80s club bop I live for. The lyrics are a little basic though, which is this album's weak point.

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (9): A really good intro track! The synths at the beginning are really fun and the song gives an insight into the production of the rest of the album. Money Changes Everything is one of the longest tracks on She's So Unusual, but that doesn't take away from the song for me. I really enjoy the instrumental break in the middle of the song and the last minute or so where Lauper belts out the last few notes.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7): Capitalist queen

---

**MrSwearword** (10): an in your face opener and I live

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): This song as an opener is incredible. It just drops you into this narrative and places you squarely into her world. And it’s the perfect song to showcase the emotion and expressive range in Cyndi’s voice.

**bbfan132** (9.1): THOSE VOCAL RUNS.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Damn, what an album opener. She just reaches through the speakers and slams you with that voice. And a harmonica solo? She shouldn’t have, but she did, for us.

**Chevsapher** (8.5): Yes it does, Cyndi. Yes it does.

**radiofan15** (8.5): I can see this song being a hit if it was, quite ironically, performed by a man who could sing a reach the required high notes, or maybe a male with a raspy voice like Springsteen... but as it is it's still works quite well...

**agentofscranton** (7): the song was an 8 until she decided to try and destroy my eardrums with those high notes

**ImADudeDuh** (7): I love this isntrumental but cyndi's voice gets p grating

**skargardin** (7): She spilledt

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I mean, tea.

**1998tweety** (6): Erm I am not a fan of her singing voice. The harmonica (?) is a choice too

**vayyiqra** (6): Excuse me there has been a mistake there is a rock song in my 80s dance-pop rate. It's not a terrible one though at least.

**waluigiest** (3): she’s right but god her voice is so unpleasant and the instrumental sounds like background music from The Sims

---

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (10): The title track of Paula’s album is out at #13. As the album’s fourth single, Forever Your Girl is a really sweet love song and a great example of dancepop. This was also Adbul’s 2nd #1 on the Billboard Hot 100, of four from her debut album.

---

##Forever Your Girl

**bespectacIed** (10): The song just exudes pure joy to me. How Will I Know's equally pretty sister from another father

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Honestly, this is the best song on this album. I think this playful yet genuinely sentimental tone suits Paula’s uniquely girlish voice very well, I really believe her on this song. Every part of this song is dynamite, chorus, verse, pre-chorus, bridge, intro, outro, whatever, click anywhere in the runtime of this song and it’ll have my attention. More than any of the other songs in this rate I’ll just replay this one over and over again.

**MrSwearword** (10): One of the cuter sides of 80s pop that needs to be valued a little more

**Chevsapher** (9.6): The piano line, the vocal interjections, the build-ups... this is the full-on pop experience.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is cute

**waluigiest** (8): the drums are so corny but there’s no denying how fun this is

##For Never

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): gets a little loud

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): It’s good, but like… why is there a man in this song?

**radiofan15** (6.3): Why does every pop girl from the 80s sounds as if they grew up in an exoplanet with an helium-rich atmosphere?

**vayyiqra** (6): This album is fun but starting to get rather samey. This track is alright, but it very much feels like discount Madonna. It reminds me strongly of "Borderline".

**Lowest Scores:**

---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): This empowering and emotional ballad is her best on the album. She belts out and unleashes it all when she realizes that the greatest love of all is her loving and believing herself in the face of adversity (also could be interpreted as a masturbation song, which is a common theme for some reason in this rate)

---

**1998tweety** (10): This is absolutely iconic

**bespectacIed** (10): Whitney queen of covering songs and making everyone associate it with her forever. This song is practically gospel at this point

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of her most iconic ballads

**MrSwearword** (10): Exhibit B of HOW THE FUCK YOU COME CORRECT WITH BALLADS. Also, Shannel vs. Akashia from S1 of Drag Race. Not only does talent win, so does intentionally conking off a headpiece and spinning after a fall. LEGENDTINTA

**Chevsapher** (9.6): This song has the most interesting subject matter on the album, although the lyrics sit oddly on the melodies sometimes. Overall, though, the songwriting, production and vocals make this song a showstopper.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This song is the be-all end-all of inspirational anthems. No song before or after has even come close to accomplishing what this song accomplished, no matter how hard they all try. Nothing will ever match these corny lyrics, those strings, those slow burn drums, and Whitney’s earth shattering voice. Did you know this song was a cover? Because I didn’t until I looked it up for this rate. Whitney finds someone else’s song and she makes it her bitch. Legend.

**slimboyfriend** (9): The ballad of all ballads. You think it’s hit its climax, and then she keeps going and going and going.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It’s a cheesy song but Whitney pulls it off so good.

**radiofan15** (7.3): Traditional and generic ballad but it kinda works so I can't hate it that much.

**charlixcxbox** (7): I struggle with this song because the singing is obviously amazing but I just find the melody excruciating

**waluigiest** (6): oh my god.....

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4): fuck them kids

**vayyiqra** (3): No disrespect to the dead, and Whitney was an incredibly talented woman, but I must be frank: enough with the sappy ballads already.

---

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): Really nice song, I like the almost duet and the contrast wordplay.

---

**Chevsapher** (11): The album mix is good, but the single mix is even better. Ridiculously catchy songwriting, a well-excecuted concept, a singing cat, a good bassline... what else could you want?

**bespectacIed** (10): iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): MC Skat Kat has better animation than Cats (2019)

**J\_Toe** (10): lol i can't believe this was one of the six music videos I had downloaded to my iPod Nano in 2008.

**MrSwearword** (10): responsible for a legendtinta lipsync...OK not legendary but memorable lipsync between Chad Michaels and Mimi Imfurst. The song itself is a good slice of 80s cheese.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9.5): It takes guts to be this cheesy. Paula’s vocals already sound a little bit cartoony so she was just like “screw it, I’ll do a duet with a literal cartoon” and the results are surprisingly great? I have a sense that this felt stupid and dated when it came out, which meant that it was only ever going to get better with age as nostalgia turned it from painfully stupid to enjoyably so. I honestly miss when this kind of synth laden gentrified “hip and fresh” rap was that used to be everywhere in the ‘80s and ‘90s, like [those old Wendy’s training videos.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PJ-JBFXh2IU&frags=pl%2Cwn) It came from such a strange place of innocence.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): when will your fave duet with an animated cat and get a #1 hit out of it??

**DrunkHurricane** (9): queen of physics

**agentofscranton** (8.5): queen of being in a relationship with a cat

**radiofan15** (8.2): Is this the one with the animated dancing cat in the video? Because I had completely forgotten that song until this rate and it's quite better than I remembered it...

**1998tweety** (8): I liked this song for a bit, but after a while it started to get a lil old. Still bops though.

**slimboyfriend** (8): MC Skat Kat 2020

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): serving tv theme song teas

**vayyiqra** (6): The folk psychology idea that opposites attract has very little scientific support so I'm docking a point for the lyrics. However, I like the beat, as cheesy and silly as the lyrics are.

**waluigiest** (5): it’s funky and I see why it’s iconic but some of the writing is really lackluster

MrSwearword: Official scorecard is a 2:4:2:2 ratio with Madonna leading the pack. Predictions then and now...

> PAULA is gonna be left with Straight Up and Cold Hearted

BOOM, CALLED IT

> MADONNA is gonna be left with Holiday, Lucky Star and Borderline

I thought Burning Up would be chopped at #11 but it made Top 10 with her sisters, slay

> CYNDI is gonna be left with Girls Just Want to Have Fun, Time After Time and She Bop

BITCH, HOW DARE Y'ALL CHOP SHE BOP

> WHITNEY is gonna be left with Saving All My Love for You and Greatest Love of All

I *SOOOOOOOOOOOO* DID NOT expect Greatest Love of All to be chopped but ended up half right.

bespectacIed: Great top 10. I am prepared for How Will I Know to lose to Holiday since y'all seem to love it so much (i did too i gave it a 10). Holiday - SNSD still outsold tho

shannytyrelle: all three remaining Madonna tracks better than Holiday, my least favorite on the whole album, but watch it be the one y'all send to a top 3 spot.
