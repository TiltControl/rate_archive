This song isn't special and it's kind of just H&M-core, but I will give it credit for surprisingly really sounding like it could really fit on Expectations? That's such a rarity for EDM features. Anyways, Closer was robbed in /u/hikkaru's rate.

Perched for a vocal minority of users to rail against this song because of the Ari feature! This is pretty good but it's basically just a chill bop and not much more. The two sound great together but the song never evolves past the core riff that's introduced in the opening notes of the song. The most noteworthy thing about this song is how Troye bungled his album promo so hard that this missed the Hot 100, oof

---
**1998tweety** (11): Love this song so much, had it on repeat like crazy right when it dropped. The low sexy vocals on the bridge are so orgasmic. Love the throwback sound with the drum too. Despite Ari and Troye both being on the same song, both of them bring their own flare to the song and no one really overshadows the other. A great collab.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): even got ariana on it ugh

**axestogrind** (10): This is the best song Ariana has released out of everything she did 2018-2019 no I will not elaborate

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): so lush. this song's like getting a hug from an old friend

**ChaseLights** (10): The only other real BOP of this album

**ExtraEater** (10): an actual groove

**lilguavachan** (10): i just love how chill and lowkey this song is. and their voices sound great together.

**ManofOranges** (10): Excellent song, excellent collaboration

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a bop. too bad Ariana's presence wasn't enough to make this song chart in the main Billboard Hot 100 list.

**twat\_brained** (10): flawless. I swear the only weak feature Ari had last year was Bed. This really got the crowd back into it during Troye's concert too

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): A great chill bop, the production shines as it fits both Troye and Ari well. Although ari cant do much so she doesnt step on troye, she delivers good vocals. The drums really stand out as they create the atmosphere of the song that the vocals can be on. This is the type of song you want to play at home and like slowly bop too or you can full on twerk too. https://youtu.be/L-pOCrM5NYE

**lagozzino** (9): Not the big dancefloor killer that the gays were hoping for, but its the ultimate sweet understated bop for just dancing in your bedroom and feeling yourself. (and I'd kill for an oldschool 12-inch style remix that expands on the "i don't wanna sleep tonight" breakdown)

**ramskick** (9): I have absolutely Danced To This in my room.

**nooodisaster** (8.5): "and do that thing we never do sober" You mean fall asleep at 9pm on the couch in the middle of binge watching Great British Baking Show?

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): I was so happy to hear Ariana on a track! I wasn't expecting it.

**CarlieScion** (8): kinda bops

**frogaranaman** (8): Dance Dance Revolution (?????????????? Dansu Dansu Reboryushon) (DDR), also known as Dancing Stage in earlier games in Europe, Central Asia, Middle East, Africa, South Asia and Oceania, and also some other games in Japan, is a music video game series produced by Konami. Introduced in Japan in 1998 as part of the Bemani series, and released in North America and Europe in 1999, Dance Dance Revolution is the pioneering series of the rhythm and dance genre in video games. Players stand on a "dance platform" or stage and hit colored arrows laid out in a cross with their feet to musical and visual cues. Players are judged by how well they time their dance to the patterns presented to them and are allowed to choose more music to play to if they receive a passing score.

**J\_Toe** (8): really want to like this song, but the lyrics are just missing so much. There's almost a story here, but so much is missing that it leaves, say, references to kitchen lights to sound randomly and specific and out of place.

**jamesfog** (8): cute song

**melodyllic\_** (8): this one grows on you i must say, but there are still a lot of other songs i'd dance to before this

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Very nice to see a straight female artist beloved by gay men actually collaborate with one of them, and all in all I find Dance To This to be one of those slow, pleasant bops that I'd love to hear on a ride home during Friday night. Ariana doesn't even outsing Troye all that much when she comes in, which is a relief. My only major complaint about Dance To This is the spoken bridge, which doesn't fit the song at all and seems to be there only to get the gays rised up. Hint: It doesn't do that.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): Nice bop

**skargardin** (7): it’s not really memorable or anything but it’s a fun time

**SkyBlade79** (7): this makes me want to drink even though i never want to drink

**tchalla1966** (7): Ariana coming to save this album.

**rotating3Dtext** (6.5): I… dislike this song more every passing moment

**waluigiest** (6): I have been underwhelmed by this since it came out!!

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): yuh

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): i cannot dance to this

**kappyko** (4): why do all the bridges on this album suck

**ggodisawomann** (3): no sorry

**selegend** (0): ariana’s highkey the only good part of the song, but even then her part isn’t that interesting. i hate that bridge

A chill, fun, summery bop, "Lucky Strike" sees Troye returning to the production of Alex Hope, who he collaborated extensively with on his debut album. You can tell pretty easily tbh, considering this feels like a slightly more upbeat version of "Cool," but it has a pretty infectious vibe regardless. I don't think it's the most special song ever, and I can't imagine it converting a new fan over songs like Seventeen or My My My.

---
**frogaranaman** (11): Tove Anna Linnéa Östman Styrke (Swedish pronunciation: ['tu?v? ²st?r?k?]; born 19 November 1992) is a Swedish singer and songwriter. She gained popularity as a contestant on Swedish Idol 2009, finishing in third place. After the show, she started a solo career in electropop. She released her debut album Tove Styrke in 2010. The New York Post included Styrke in its list of "10 Artists to Know in 2011". In 2015, she released her second album, Kiddo. Three years later, in 2018, she released her third album, Sway.

**ggodisawomann** (10): I LOVE THIS MORE

**lilguavachan** (10): a cute little summer-y bop

**melodyllic\_** (10): such a rich and beautiful piece of pop. the harmonies on 'tell me all the ways to love you' get me every single time!! the imagery is amazing as always

**ramskick** (10): when I first heard this song I thought that Troye Sivan had just hit a Lucky Strike. Turns out he's actually super good, all puns aside.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): me: “i hate smoking” me after listening to this song: https://i.imgur.com/fGSeIOl.jpg

**1998tweety** (9.5): A MASSIVE bop. Love how chill the chorus is, such a vibe.

**jamesfog** (9.5): bopp

**kappyko** (9.5): the best song on the album because the drop is actually effective

**twat\_brained** (9.3): I guess the heart in the video is meant to represent what happens to it when you smoke too many Luckies? Definitely looks fun

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (9): hints of "Style" Taylor Swift. 1989, Big Machine Records, 2014

**nooodisaster** (9): werk fan favorite!!

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): This is a bop that you listen to in a good mood and move along to a little bit too much in public.

**Chelzero** (8): I'd give this a 9 but I had to take a point off for romanticising smoking. Don't do drugs (including cigarettes!) stay in school practice safe sex

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): See my comment for What A Heavenly Way To Die: I wouldn't call Lucky Strike filler, but it's still lacking something that makes it absolutely memorable. The one thing it does have over the aforementioned song is that 'tell me all the ways to love you' is a much better hook. Also, in the context of the rate? It makes a pretty nice parallel to Lucky Escape.

**skargardin** (8): It took this one becoming a single for me to pay proper attention to it. It actually is a groovy bop that has grown a lot on me.

**ChaseLights** (7): it's ok

**SkyBlade79** (7): what does the chorus even mean

**tapdancingpig** (7): This is an okay love song with phenomenal production.

**waluigiest** (7): here and there

**J\_Toe** (6): Why do cigarettes get mentioned in so many Troye songs? Smoking is not sexy. It really takes me out of the song and makes me think of his lovers as gross. Also, again with the repetitive production.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (6): Also didn't click

**ImADudeDuh** (3): Lucky Strike is an American brand of cigarettes owned by the British American Tobacco groups. Individual cigarettes of the brand are often referred to colloquially as "Luckies." Lucky Strike was the top-selling cigarette brand in the United States during the 1930s. CANCELLED for promoting cigarettes

**tchalla1966** (3): this song was a bore someone send me some lucky strikes to finish this album

I think of all the songs on the album, this stands out as the one that feels the most like it could fit on Communion. It's definitely a bop, but something about the tone and looping of the production makes it seem just like a worse version of "Ties" or "Worship." I do give it probs for the short spoken-word bridge though, that's a neat touch. Otherwise, though, this doesn't stand out.

---
**lagozzino** (11): cuz I remember... You Told Me The First Time... I WAS JUST A RENDEZVOUS-VOUS-VOUS-VOUS

**1998tweety** (10): These synthy low-voiced sexual bops are amazing. Not the biggest fan of the bridge, but the verses and chorus are so so good they make up for it.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): hookup culture smh

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**J\_Toe** (10): a really unique topic to discuss in a pop song and exemplary of why it is important for queer perspectives to be given a platform in the pop landscape.

**kappyko** (9.5): that bridge snatched me into venus

**ChaseLights** (9): They snapped, they served us a bop to call out all y'all nasty gays who only like to hook-up, couldn't be me

**nooodisaster** (9): I'm bopping soooo hard to this.

**waluigiest** (9): this album is so good!!

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I always love songs like this that have a kind of dangerous, intriguing atmosphere they cast their listeners in. After the brief stint in disappointed that was Hypnotized, Rendezvous fortunately returns Palo Santo back to excellency by being incredibly sleek and engaging.

**jamesfog** (7.5): just a physical rendezvous :bopping:

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): BOP

**ramskick** (7): if there are any Years and Years fans near me, I'm down to rendezvous so we can just listen to their music.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The autotune is a choice but the production slaps

**frogaranaman** (6): Reminds me of the late 18th to early 19th centuries.

**melodyllic\_** (3): too much autotune and too much similarity come on olly

Love the back-and-forth between Hayley and Kehlani here. This is probably the boppiest song on the album other than "Curious," and I think the pop drop after the chorus is a major part of that. I've never hated the pop drop and I think this is a great example of it! Plus, the music video is amazing

---
**CarlieScion** (11): First of all, the transition from Feelings into this is heavenly. This bittersweet duet with Kehlani is about being with a girl who isn't ready to admit their sexuality. Honestly, this song is a 10/10, simply because of the chemistry between Hayley and Kehlani. This has been compared to Strangers by Halsey and Lauren Jauregui, simply for being a pop duet between two queer girls. Strangers, however, is about the natural end to a relationship when you can't even recognize the person you're with anymore. This song is about not being able to even start a relationship, because - as Hayley sings "I only want a girl who ain't afraid to love me // Not a metaphor of what we really could be". Hayley wants a true relationship, someone she can be with publicly.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): the highlight of the album, my 3rd contender after all for you and plum for my 11...perfect summer bop

**ggodisawomann** (10): this is THE gay smash

**jamesfog** (10): major chune x

**lilguavachan** (10): kehlani did that

**melodyllic\_** (10): a whole ass bop!! hayley and kehlani's vocals are brilliant together, and coupled with a chorus that slaps, what more could you ask for?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): moms

**nooodisaster** (10): 20biteen is so powerful

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): holy god this is a gay bop

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): To quote /u/yatcho: The lesbians made some points when they declared her Jesus The best song on the album and was close to being my 11 but both bloom and this are my personal 11s but I chose Bloom for the rate oops. Hayley and Kehlani deliver an amazing banger, solidyfying their power as lesbian and wlw icons. The chorus is absoultely amazing and their voices work so well together. Deserved to smash and be pushed to radio.

**twat\_brained** (10): this sounds like a fifth harmony reject but given to the right production team; the chorus literally sounds like Camila and Lauren's voices layered over one another. And IT'S GREAT! This kind of music is, in fact, what I need ?

**ramskick** (9.5): What I Need is for this song to finally get out of my head.

**1998tweety** (9): A nice duet, but this song is extremely problematic because it features 2 womxn who attacked Rita Ora because of Girls. Seethe hypocrites.

**ChaseLights** (9): Goes off all the way

**selegend** (9): kehlani outshined hayley but still, a bop

**hikkaru** (8.5): Kehlani doing the opening verse is amazing, but the song loses steam quickly. Still a bop tho

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): God, I'm living for this just for the fact alone that it's two badass queer women of colour delivering a well-crafted pop song that could've been a huge hit in an alternate universe. I'm not a fan of some parts of the song, but the chorus is an incredible earworm, and Hayley and Kehlani have a great dynamic. Between this and Strangers, I'm totally down for more gay ladies collaborating together! Maybe next we can get Brandy Clark and Brandi Carlie?

**ImADudeDuh** (8): I don't really like the verses all too much but the bridge again makes me fall in love

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8): Two queer queens SNATCHING MY WIG

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.5): hook is super catchy, Kehlani really outdoes her vocally on this tho

**skargardin** (7.5): These verses are not it

**tapdancingpig** (7): This is cute, but there’s not a whole lot of substance here.

**frogaranaman** (6): https://redd.it/83nwc3

**waluigiest** (6): not bad but feels like radio filler

**kappyko** (5.5): 10 for kehlani and none for hayley! hayley shouldnt be rewarded for kehlani having good vocals

**SkyBlade79** (4): feels kinda bubblegum

**mysario** (2): issa catchy song, but her autotune is somehow too noticeable and not prominent enough. Also fuck Chris Brown

This is catchy but the production feels kind of rough around the edges. I was much lower on it until I saw the music video.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): this song got me hooked on her, such a fitting chorus

**axestogrind** (10): [Together] Feminist! Lesbian! Vagina!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): A fucking snatcher holy shit, the bridge is SO GOOD

**lilguavachan** (10): the bass guitar... the lyrical content... a serve and also a personal attack.

**ManofOranges** (10): I used to think this track was average but it has grown on me so much legitimately one of the best tracks I've heard

**ramskick** (10): I feel only very positive feelings towards this song.

**skargardin** (10): Sexy bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): i want the guitar to impregnate me

**ExtraEater** (9.5): riveting

**rotating3Dtext** (9.2): I like how the album starts with such energy and keeps it for another song without pause

**CarlieScion** (9): The bass on this makes this song. This would've been a 10 if Hayley properly emoted while singing "sorry that I care". The chorus is one that I kinda wanna scream at the top of my longs while driving. I really relate to the lyrics ??

**SkyBlade79** (9): this is a big ol bop, I love the many tone shifts

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): A pensive bop that gets too real about feelings with someone, its the type of song that you bop to while avoiding what the feelings that come through when you really think about the lyrics

**1998tweety** (8.7): This is a bop but imo it gets eclipsed by the other singles.

**hikkaru** (8.5): that gritty bassline, YUH

**nooodisaster** (8.5): A seeeerrve. Great production, interesting lyrics, and just... an aura to it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): This is a very stellar opening track to Expectations. Our society does tell people to erase all traces of sensitivity from their personalities thanks to its hell-bent nature, and Hayley resisting that attitude is very refreshing as a piece of much-needed subject matter. Ballads very rarely start a record well, but this is an exception.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): pure unapologetic pop. I LIVE!

**ChaseLights** (8): A bop, goes off but not all the way

**frogaranaman** (8): https://redd.it/8ghrao

**ggodisawomann** (8): when this comes on shuffle I quake

**melodyllic\_** (8): a simple bop you can groove to but nothing too major

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The transitions on this album are very underrated

**waluigiest** (8): messy in a fun way

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): Vibes vibes vibes

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): kind of boring, and overproduced at the same time. Not sure how you do that tbh.

**kappyko** (5.5): this isnt terrible wtf but the bass guitar is ugly as shit

This is probably the most EDM song on the album with its strong house influences, and it was also the biggest grower on the album for me. The rapid fire delivery in the chorus makes for a really infectious hook, and overall it's just an extremely danceable song that you can let loose to.

---
**1998tweety** (10): Oh wow this sounds so sexual, I love it.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): still cant stop listening to this one

**CarlieScion** (10): synthpop bop

**kappyko** (10): oh my fucking god they did it didnt they.... literally every part of this is so slick it makes me scream

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this makes up for the lack of a bop that album opener is

**ChaseLights** (9): That high note alone whew! Troye is QUAKING! Also this is such a good bop, this is a Tranter-Michaels cowrite too, so I mean you just KNEW this was gonna be it

**rotating3Dtext** (9): horny bop

**skargardin** (9): Sexy dancefloor jam

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): This song is a pleasant surprise, those background deep synths are the perfect slate for the monster of a chorus.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): This song has me singing me hallelujah while dancing

**twat\_brained** (9): oh this is that GOOD synthpop I need in my life!

**waluigiest** (9): dance dance slap slap

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Here's a song that relies in a chorus that features a sense of urgency - I won't be surprised if this scores higher than a lot of Palo Santo, thanks to how much Popheads is a sucker for upbeat music. As a second song on the album's tracklist, Hallelujah retains the interest that Olly captures with Sanctify, and it's overall a fun track that gets you further into Palo Santo.

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): hi welcome to Forever 21

**ramskick** (8): When I saw that this album was released I audibly said Hallelujah.

**SkyBlade79** (8): this was really good

**frogaranaman** (7): Reminds me of 1969.

The title track of the album, "Bloom" talks about Troye's experience losing his virginity as a gay bottom. Personally, I really appreciate how whole-heartedly this song embraces that, considering how there's a sense of shame (a lot of the time internalized) about being a bottom or a twink in gay spaces online. I don't think this song is as good as My My My but it deserves to go down as a gay anthem nonetheless because it is a slutbop with a wholesome message about being a slut.

---
**hikkaru** (11): I don't really like Troye all that much (don't hate him, just not the biggest fan of his voice) but this is an amazing song. Just pure boppy pop bliss and definitely deserving of my 11.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (11): A bottom anthem that will be iconic amongst gays, the sultry guitar song accompanies Troyes best song on this album and the whole rate. The gayest song on the album without going into graphic detail, Troye makes it into a beautiful thing of submission, opening up and ready to cross that line with his partner. It captures all the feelings of excitement, nervousness, and trust that goes into losing your virginity for the first time. As the song progresses and the guitar goes on, the energy increases and the song reaches a height as it hits many beats that for me make it one of the best songs.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): bussy wide open

**axestogrind** (10): Bottom excellence

**ggodisawomann** (10): Troye did THIS, we love an anal anthem

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a gay anthem that somehow made it into the radio playlist in my work, ugh i stan

**jamesfog** (10): bop, bad mv

**lilguavachan** (10): we love a cute little gay bop about bottoming

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): an album highlight. can't believe Troye almost never put this into the album

**poppinmmolly** (10): an 11 contender but Curious bops a little harder

**selegend** (10): a masterpiece tbh. it’s so open about gay sex and how beautiful it can be

**waluigiest** (10): personal gay sexual liberation yes thank you

**1998tweety** (9.5): A big gay bop. Love the song except for the weird modulated bridge.

**ramskick** (9.5): My love for this song continues to bloom.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Oh wow this is actually lovely.

**twat\_brained** (8.7): Pretty alright for a title track honestly, but the video threw me off somewhat

**CarlieScion** (8): we stan anal sex

**frogaranaman** (8): Bloom is the fourth studio album by American dream pop duo Beach House. It was co-produced by the band and Chris Coady, and was released on May 15, 2012, by Sub Pop. The album was written over two years of touring and was recorded at Sonic Ranch in Tornillo, Texas, over seven weeks. Building on their previous album, Teen Dream (2010), the duo continued to add live drums to their song arrangements for Bloom, supplementing their drum machine rhythms.

**lagozzino** (8): This boy got a song about spreading his hole to play on the radio. The one true icon of 20GayTeen.

**melodyllic\_** (8): troye's teenage dream is ultimately a little forgettable but sweet nonetheless

**rotating3Dtext** (8): points off for the awful lyrics vide

**nooodisaster** (7.5): "bops about bottoming" nuff said.

**oliveoilgarlic** (7.5): twink fantasizing about his crush while sitting on a bench in a mall in 1988

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Ugh, I wish I wasn't giving this a kind of subpar score. It's one of the most unique and engaging tracks on its parent album for sure, which is why it attracts so much infamy, in the first place, and I'd definitely call it one of the best off this record, in general. It's just that the fact that the lyrics are obviously about bottoming feel me with anxiety, for some reason. This is probably related to bad memories (before you cackle I'm talking about very, very bad memories that have less to do with messy sex and more to do with, to be blunt, abuse) that the song reminds me of, but I'd feel bad about dropping its average based on that alone, so I'm giving it a decent score and running away. See ya!

**ChaseLights** (7): #BopsAboutBottoming

**SkyBlade79** (7): pretty good

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): https://cdn.bulbagarden.net/upload/thumb/2/2a/044Gloom.png/250px-044Gloom.png

**MelodramaticLemonade** (6.5): It's just fine but nothing stands out tbh

**tchalla1966** (5): This song was the beginning of Troye meh era, and it's the second song on the album.

**kappyko** (4.5): this song never blooms ya dig. i gave this a high score in jukebox but when compared to the rest of the album and albums in this rate it is nowhere near the top and nowhere near my thing. the chorus is so WEAK.

**J\_Toe** (4): I really dislike this song. TBH the concept of a gay artist writing an unabashed gay sex song in a pop landscape dominated by straight pop songs was exactly what I want din 2018. But, like, the key hook of this song, "yeah I bloom", isn't pleasant to listen to. It sounds auto-tuned and yet still flat at the same time. Plus the animated lyric video still scares me.

**ManofOranges** (4): This song to me feels like I should like it and yet for some strange reason I just don't

**mysario** (3): I'm bloom da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa, da ba dee da ba daa

This song caught me completely off guard at release because it sounds *nothing* like anything Y&Y have ever released. Steve Mac, producer of songs like "Shape of You" and Rita Ora's "Your Song," really stands out as producer here with the xylophone (?) riff looping throughout he song. There's an air of cheery sarcasm to the song that makes it really special and easy to play on loop. Despite being an extremely femme song, Olly definitely exudes power over the relationship he's describing, and that's hugely empowering to me.

---
**BearlyEvenAPun** (11): One of their best, Y&Y just do upbeat songs so well.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): When i heard this on the popheads 100 songs of 2019, omg the bops arrived.

**kappyko** (11): this is SO FUCKING CUTE AND I LOVE CUTE POP!!!!!!!!!!!

**PuggleMaster** (11): The song that made me fall in love with this album

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): yes such a perfect "fuck you" song, Lily Allen is proud

**hikkaru** (10): a bouncy fun bop!

**J\_Toe** (10): I like the combination of poppy uptempo production with sad lyrical content. It gives the song an undercurrent of resilience.

**jamesfog** (10): hit x

**ManofOranges** (10): This song really snapped

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this is so summer and lighthearted i love it

**poppinmmolly** (10): an 11 contender because this bops really hard but Curious still bops a little harder

**ramskick** (10): yeah I'm never gonna get over this song.

**twat\_brained** (10): Flawless, perfect choice for a single and just instantly pumps up my mood

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): Its like they know my ex and made a song about him while making it a bop and a half that I can listen to when he tries to crawl back into my life. The lyricism and production jumped out

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.5): the instrumental kind of serving royalty free music on a youtube video but otherwise bop

**nooodisaster** (9): the PRECHORUS to this. My phone autocapped that but I'm keeping it bc yeah, agreed.

**1998tweety** (8.8): This is a cute fun bop. Again, I wasn't the biggest fan of it at first but it's grown on me over time. The Key remix is a slay too.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Why didn’t this dominate radio?

**Chelzero** (8): I loved it when I first heard it but doesn't stand up to repeated listens well. Still a cute song though

**letsallpoo** (8): the instrumental really holds this back

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): I'm not going to lie; even if If You're Over Me is the one hit song off Palo Santo (well, it's a hit if we're talking about the UK, anyway) I honestly prefer some songs from Years' and Years' debut album over it. This is nice and fun to listen to, but in its timidness it doesn't seem to have as bright of a shine due to its sonical timidity. I still like the song, and I will admit its lyrics are pretty engaging, but there's a lot better on Palo Santo.

**skargardin** (8): gets shit on way more than it deserves, it’s cute

**waluigiest** (8): the honesty!!!

**ChaseLights** (7.5): It's a bop and it grew on me a lot, but it's still a little too twee to be my fave.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): This sounds like a Kidz Bop jingle done well which still isn't a great complement sorry

**CarlieScion** (7): this gets played daily at the work radio. thanks work radio for ruining this bop

**melodyllic\_** (7): a bouncy, fun bop that is enjoyable in the moment but forgettable in the long run

**rotating3Dtext** (7): sigh, THIS had to be their big hit this era?

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): The opening is serving Kickstarter video music

**ExtraEater** (5): halo santo (get it cuz halos are usually over people's heads hahahahahaha)

**SkyBlade79** (4): this sounds like something that they would play at Kohl's

**axestogrind** (3): If there was a letterboxd but for music I would list this album under Albums With Its Worst Song As The Lead Single alongside EMOTION

**frogaranaman** (2): Reminds me of 2001.

My favorite song of Charli's 2018 output. It's kind of gimmicky lyrically, but I think making an electropop bop with a big chorus is more than enough creativity required for a collaboration with such different artists like this. The only complaint I have is that Charli really drowns out Troye on the chorus.

---
**CarlieScion** (10): lets go lesbians

**ChaseLights** (10): Troye actually doesn't that bad here, and of course Charli has given us a full-out bop because it's Charli baby.

**ggodisawomann** (10): noineynoineynoine

**J\_Toe** (10): my favourite thing about this song is how many times I see people younger than 18 bopping to it at my gym. They weren't yet alive in 1999, lol. But maybe, given the state of the world, that's what they're hoping to return to. Or maybe (more likely) Charli's production is just that killer!

**jamesfog** (10): a banger

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): WHOLE BOP CHARLI XBOX GO

**melodyllic\_** (10): one of the most carefree, no-fucks-given bops of the year. the bouncy, propulsive instrumental combined with charli's commanding, distinctive vocals and troye's laidback, effortless tone make for a banging tune.

**rosecoloreds** (10): queen charli

**skargardin** (10): pop perfection coming thru

**tapdancingpig** (10): This is a pure bop, and I would give this my 11 if it was in the legit rate.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This song made me become a Lyft driver

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): The power they have together....ugh their minds. We stan the massive throwback banger that actually took off a bit and got a chance of reviving XCX3 and its what she deserves. Troye works and they pull it off together.

**twat\_brained** (10): i mean how could it not be a 10

**1998tweety** (8.8): This is a cute bop, Charli is a lot better when she makes weird pop music instead of PC music.

**poppinmmolly** (8): this vidoe has stuff from '97 and '00 which I can't get past but it still bops!!

**tchalla1966** (8): honestly take me back to 1999

**Chelzero** (7): the nineties are overrated

**frogaranaman** (7): I want to go back to when I was only alive for three months, that sounds like a dream.

**selegend** (7): it’s a 10 but troye contributes nothing noteworthy to it

**rickikardashian** (6.9): the production is real nice and the whole melody is so nice, but God, I just hate when lyrics are just “here's me naming old things”

**kappyko** (6): fine

**nooodisaster** (6): Troye was 4 in 1999.

**static\_int\_husp** (4): This is seroiusly the worst song Charli released in 2018. Super generic and derivative, espically when we know what she's capable of

**ImADudeDuh** (2): I don't want to go back.

This is such an odd song and I'm glad it got so much attention on the subreddit. Basically, the song has a ton of buildup during the verses and pre-chorus but then the chorus hits you HARD with a dark, sexy, spoken-word chorus. It's such a risk and it really makes the song stand out, so major props to MNEK for taking it. It does kind of drag in the middle of the song but this is deliciously gay. Also glad that it was able to beat 1999 in the bonus rate because he was definitely the underdog in this scenario!

---
**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (10): MNEK's album flopping was an insult to people with taste everywhere. this song is incredibly well-produced and well-composed, and MNEK sings his ass off, and can we talk about that key change?

**ChaseLights** (10): A bop, the gay king we deserve, can't believe y'all vanilla gays are gonna stick us with he-who-can't-sing-live

**Chelzero** (10): #justiceforlanguage the best song of this rate tbh

**frogaranaman** (10): Yo, real talk: why the fuck does this bang? There’s a million reasons for it not to but it ignores all those reasons.

**J\_Toe** (10): tbh I would have preferred Language on this rate over Bloom 10x.

**lagozzino** (10): The bop of all bops. If I could give an 11 to a bonus track this would be it.

**lilguavachan** (10): a serve.

**ManofOranges** (10): It's a shame this song isn't in the actual rate because this is without a doubt in my mind an 11

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): invented cunnilingus

**oliveoilgarlic** (10): a tremendous banger with the perfect contrast between dark production and cute lyrics. one of the best all around pop songs of 2018

**selegend** (10): this should win the bonus rate

**skargardin** (10): this would’ve been my 11 if Language was in the main rate, it’s THAT good

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): A massively gay banger that popheads has paid dust to. Incredibly underrated, MNEK is out here making gay bangers with his great production. The tea is that if he gave this to a pop girl with the same production that he made for himself, y'all would immediately stan.

**1998tweety** (9.5): Experimental bop we STAN

There's a very sexy, dark aura to this song that really draws in the listener, and compared to the very joyous tones of a lot of Communion I was excited that Y&Y were going in this direction for their new era. However, this does kind of wear on you after a while because the clunking riffs are pretty repetitive. It's a very good song in moderation but I haven't felt the need to play it more than once in a row since the album dropped.

---
**piccprincess** (11): fuck you tk

**waluigiest** (11): i am QUIVERING he met one too many masc4masc guys

**selegend** (10): the song that plays when i go to hell for sodomy

**MelodramaticLemonade** (9.5): Best bop best choice for lead single

**nooodisaster** (9.5): SLUT DROP!!!

**melodyllic\_** (9): a nice mystical bop. love the contrast between the verses (in minor) and the chorus (in major)

**ramskick** (9): whenever someone tells me they love Years and Years, I sanctify our friendship.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): A kinky gay bop that slaps

**twat\_brained** (8.8): Great intro! Not sure I get the sanctification motif but it sure sounds lovely! If the rest of this album sounds this good I'll be well pleased!

**ManofOranges** (8.5): I'd probably like this song even more if I knew what sanctify meant tbh

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I didn't immediately like this opener when I first listened to Palo Santo because of having mixed thoughts whether Olly's voice was fit or not, but as it stands now I think there's enough earnest done here to make Sanctify actually great. While Olly doesn't make for the best seductive performer, he tries his best here by focusing on his passion, and it pays off very well.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.5): weird choice for a first single i gotta say

**skargardin** (8.5): This has only grown on me this past year

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is a cute bop, it was a bit disappointing as the lead single but it's grown on me in the context of the album.

**CarlieScion** (8): V good chorus

**ChaseLights** (8): Olly tryna serve us a Justin Timberlake but actually good, okay king!

**jamesfog** (8): This was a shrinker

**tapdancingpig** (7): This is dark, but... also kind of unpleasant?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6.7): i understand that they wanted to signify a new era has commenced, but this just lacked the dance-able vibe you would expect from Years & Years

**frogaranaman** (6): Reminds me of 2016.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): This song is honestly incredibly boring, I’m sorry everyone. I’ve always dug Olly’s vocals but this song honestly does nothing for me.

Greg Kurstin is one of my favorite pop producers, and he has a particular style of 80s-throwback synthpop that several artists have borrowed: see Halsey's "Strangers" and Carly Rae Jepsen's "Higher" for other examples. So pairing that sound with one of my favorite artists is a dream come true for me. But not only that, it's also super dark and tense, which are my favorite qualities in a pop song! Overall, this song is just perfectly tailored to me, so I feel like I have to give it my 11. It might not be my most listened to song for me, and it doesn't always hit the spot because of its very particular dark mood, but when it connects it connects *hard*.

The BIGGEST surprise of the rate is this getting so high. It wasn't quite strong enough to muscle past each of the most beloved singles from each of the artists in the rate, but it still outperformed songs that people thought could win like Bloom or What I Need. 
---
**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (11): why was this only a bonus track? it's incredible! that chorus!

**ramskick** (11): My love for all music except for songs that aren't this one has gone up in flames because of how much I love this song holy shit it's so fucking incredible.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): second best song of the whole album, it feels so ominous from the beginning and never disappoints. deserved a spot on the standard edition though.

**jamesfog** (10): A gem. Amazing production

**kappyko** (10): okay idc if the rest of this song sucks that intro si a fucking 10 edit this song slaps and deserves

**lilguavachan** (10): ugh their minds, we love this 80s inspired dark, moody song about an ain't shit daddy

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): my vagina when he fucks me up real good

**selegend** (10): giant BOP

**skargardin** (10): something something deserved to be one the standard edition?

**axestogrind** (9): Kind of gives me 00s pop in that chorus? VERY strong close to the album... really solidifies how hard they fucken snapped.

**CarlieScion** (9): now THATS what i call a closer

**ChaseLights** (9): The kind of synthpop bop that they could have replaced Palo Santo with on the standard version, sounds kind like Let the Music Play

**frogaranaman** (9): Reminds me of 1987.

**lagozzino** (9): Y&Y do their best Pet Shop Boys impression and honey it is one killer impression.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I'm surprised this wasn't on the main album, although I can see why it may not have fit in the tracklist. It's almost better than every song on Palo Santo except All For You, if I'm being honest! There's some really promising songwriting here and an inmediately captivating atmosphere that tells you that Up in Flames is going to be good. I hope the fact that it's the final bonus song at the end of the longest album in the rate doesn't make it end up placing low.

**1998tweety** (8.8): Ok WOW why wasn't this on the standard edition?? It fits musically and it's not like it was packed anyway.

**melodyllic\_** (8): it's a bop but it's way too similar to some other tracks in the album

**SkyBlade79** (8): the 80s is shaken

**waluigiest** (8): good but not the best

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): Omg MJ realness

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This is perhaps the most 80s sounding track on the record. It’s solid, if not a bit generic.

**J\_Toe** (6): unlike the tracks on Bloom, this song is so clearly retro that it sounds more like a tribute than a shallow retread of an earlier pop sound.

The dramatic lead single to Bloom, this was definitely a glow-up of maturity for Troye. Production and melody wise, it's extremely polished, and that just gives it an aura of effortless coolness. I think this will be a staple in gay bars and clubs for years to come because it just has a certain X factor to it.

---
**ggodisawomann** (11): jesus christ this is my FAVORITE song to scream to in the gay bar

**twat\_brained** (11): call me a basic ass hoe but what else is gonna win? Maybe Curious

**1998tweety** (10): A MASSIVE BOP, it did take a while for me to come around to it but now I love it. Such a good gay pop song.

**ExtraEater** (10): unbelievable song like what the heck wow

**ImADudeDuh** (10): WIG WIG WIG!

**J\_Toe** (10): switchedonpop was right that this is a perfect pop song that teaches you to sing it on the first listen. It sounds so euphoric and is exactly what I want from Troye.

**jamesfog** (10): bop of 2018

**ManofOranges** (10): I get chills whenever I listen to this song

**melodyllic\_** (10): i don't know how troye managed to capture the essence of euphoria in 3 minutes and 25 seconds but he did it

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): i love this, but someone compared this to Lorde's "Green Light"… girl-i

**skargardin** (10): YAS come thru gay anthem!

**SkyBlade79** (10): this is definitely a bop and a half

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): Lions and Tigers and Bears Oh My My My! I die every night with you

**axestogrind** (9): KNEW the album was going to be good when he dropped this I just KNEW.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (9): Never knew wigs could be torn off by seizure triggers, but here we are

**nooodisaster** (9): The lyrics aren't as interesting as Blue Neighborhood's singles, but it's just as well made of a pop single. The vocal and synths layer and compound in an explosive way that feels like Michael Jackson's 80s output, but even gayer.

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): WHAT A CHORUS

**ramskick** (9): My My My this is quite a good song

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): The song that first came out and turned me into a stan

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): Some people are predicting that this'll win. Honestly, it'd be pretty weak material in a Winner's Rate, and I still think Curious has a chance of conquering it, but I do agree that this is Troye's best chance. My My My is catchier than your average Troye fare, and it shows more of the personality that I've been hoping to see from him more frequently, too. The only disadvantage I can think of is that it doesn't seem inherently as gay as the rest of this album, but maybe I'm just missing something about it.

**waluigiest** (8): how is this album so relatable

**frogaranaman** (7): .my is the Internet country code top-level domain (ccTLD) for Malaysia. MYNIC is the agency responsible for the domain, and is under the Ministry of Communications and Multimedia (KKMM) and regulated by the Malaysian Communication and Multimedia Commission (MCMC). MYNIC administers the name space for the .my top level domain (TLD). This involves the registration of domain names as well as the maintenance and operation of a domain name registry (a central database for .my domain names).

**tchalla1966** (7): good start to the album am I about to stan?!

**ChaseLights** (6.5): a danceable spin on Troye's tired sound

**CarlieScion** (6): I overplayed this to hell last year

**selegend** (6): bland

**Chelzero** (5.5): skippable

**kappyko** (4): not as disgusting as i foudn it last year but it's so milquetoast as an alt pop dance pop song. the chorus is so weak and the production is like a bad zayn song

This is a major bop, but I don't think it quite lives up to the hype it received on the subreddit. The fast rap part is iconic but I feel like the production is unusually lurchy and repetitive. I listened to this a lot in the spring but I found myself drifting away from it as the months went by. Would've loved for this to be her breakout hit, but I think its shortcomings are so obvious that I'm not surprised it wasn't.

This settled into the runner-up slot fairly early in the rate but it never came within ~15 points of All For You. Honestly I expected this to be the winner going in but it kinda flopped in terms of gathering 11s, which was its main pitfall. Still an admirable effort by the artist who ended up being the rate's biggest underdog.

**poppinmmolly** (11): this bops so hard it should have been way bigger than it was.

**1998tweety** (10): A MEGA bop. The chorus is so so good. I do wish it had a bit more of a bridge though.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): almost as good as what i need but still a perfect 10

**CarlieScion** (10): This wasn't the lead single, but this is THE single. This is the closest Hayley has come to breaking out in the mainstream, even performing the song with Taylor Swift at Gillette Stadium - truly a 20gayteen Moment™. Most notable for the fast-sung line "didyoutakehimtothepierinsantamonicaforgettobringajacketwrapupinhimcauseyouwantedto?", this song is about the same relationship from What I Need. While What I Need explains why the two lovers didn't work out, this track centers around Hayley obsessing over her lost lover's new relationship. The chorus ends in a two-punch of a line - "I'm just curious // Is it serious?". Hayley is asking her previous lover if her new relationship is serious, but she's also asking if their feelings for each other is serious - serious enough for her to act on them.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): I'm going to admit that this song gave me weird biphobic vibes at first because of its plot, but after considering how it was based on a real person Hayley had a damaging relationship with, I think the lyrics are easily passible if you apply a biographical reading towards them. Whether Hayley knows how to talk about bisexuality in public is another story, but since she's friends with people that I personally believe are bi, I don't hold up the idea that she's that kind of gay woman to scrunity. As for the song itself, it's definitely Hayley's most infectious and easily appealing single. It's not my go-to lesbian anthem, but I do enjoy it very much. It's probably the best on Expactations, or at least the best single.

I have no idea how this wasn't the lead single, it's such a ginormous bop and absolutely deserved to smash (at least in the UK.) Beyond just having a ton of hooks packed into it, I also think there's a level of subtle complexity behind the emotion of the song that I really appreciate. I can hear both the frustration but also the sense of really being over this guy he's singing about.

This song was decisively in the lead since day 1 of submissions because 25% of the participants gave it an 11. It is INSANELY gratifying to me that a group that sometimes it feels like only I stan (to the point where their inclusion in this rate was questioned!!) ended up doing so well. Thank you to all the fans old and new who supported Y&Y this rate!!

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (11): not just the best of the album, best of this whole rate, the whole last year, and probably one of the best of the 2010's. Into You levels of good. Perfect example how you can be petty and regretful and angry and annoyed and fed up with your self-blaming cycles, but still have enough power and stamina to move forward, leave behind, and learn from all the toxic shit of a bad relationship. One of the most bombastic choruses I've ever heard, and the song just oozes energy at literally every point from start to beginning. That "you look like you so damn scared" without the backing track after the bridge is just perfection. Usually I have to reverse the song to that point because I just can't get over it. It's a shame it wasn't a lead single because it's so elevated, so 80's yet so 3010's. You guys really did it. If this isn't top 5 y'all can wait for the cease and desist's.

**ChaseLights** (11): Absolutely godly, this is an amazing bop and we are blessed to have the opportunity to get our lives to this, we are truly sanctified.

**J\_Toe** (11): anthemic. You can song along after only a few listens.

**jamesfog** (11): Major banger that I slept on. Better thank King xo

**ManofOranges** (11): Actually iconic

**MashLuke** (11): amazing song they did that wig flew we stan

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): For me, pop always works best if it makes use of the joyous, euphoric, and, occasionally, lyrically dissonant melodies that we struck gold with during the better part of the 80s. All For You is an excellent example of what I'm talking about. The song works incredibly well off its sound, and at the end of the day it just comes off across as so amazing to my ears that it stands out above the rest of this rate whenever I take the opportunity to listen to it. For that reason, it's getting my 11.

**selegend** (11): the gays should’ve stanned this more. mister olly and co gave us EVERYTHING we needed.

**skargardin** (11): Maximalist pop perfection, it is everything I want out of pop music.

**withoutgrl** (11): - literally the banger of the century

**1998tweety** (10): This song is such a massive bop, the chorus in particular. The one part I want to highlight in particular though is the bridge. First of all, we get 2 different sections which is a treat considering some songs just recycle the pre-chorus or something. This bridge is clearly about sex: "kneeling at your temple" is obviously about a blowjob. "No hands, no rush", the bottom is cumming hands-free. "No touch, no drug", the bottom is not on poppers. "No blood, no love", this one is the most interesting of all; "no blood" is referring to how the couple is equating barebacking with love. AIDS can be transmitted through blood, but using a condom can prevent that. If you're not willing to bareback with your partner, then you don't love them. It is also a take on polysexuality and cheating since you would hopefully be using a condom on someone you don't normally have sex with, and this use of a condom means that there is no love, what you're doing is purely sexual.

**axestogrind** (10): Wrote a long thing about this in the TOP 100 POPHEADS so UM... go check that out! TL;DR: great song!

**ExtraEater** (10): party-o santo

**hikkaru** (10): HUGE bop, one of the boppiest out of this entire rate and specifically this album which is pretty much ALL bops

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg Janet's All For You is a major bop, but it's is slightly unstable a bit

**kappyko** (10): they did it gays!!!!

**lagozzino** (10): I cry every time I remember that they spent their time and money promoting "Play" as a single instead of this.

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): Greg Kurstin fucking snapped. i wonder if this will receive bigger attention if this was the lead single

**ramskick** (9.5): Whenever I introduce someone to Years and Years I want to explain that it's all for their ears because of how good they are.

**twat\_brained** (9.4): Sensational. I love it and I do want it all for me!

**CarlieScion** (9): bop

**MelodramaticLemonade** (9): BOP AND A HALF

**waluigiest** (9): they’re really taking us through all these moods

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I was shook at how good this was and then I saw Greg Kurstin produced

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): For the longest time, I thought it said this gaydar is all for you or something and I thought it was odd but then I looked up the lyrics and was disappointed that it wasn't that. I still love the song https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/518893521286201344/560454355694780426/emote.png

**melodyllic\_** (7.5): a standard synthpop banger in the vein of their previous album. the harmonies are tight tho

**frogaranaman** (7): Reminds me of 1988.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I don’t really like the production on this that much but the chorus again is bop territory

# Bloom

---

**Overall average**: 7.504

---

Going into this era, I really wanted Troye to prove himself, because he gets a lot of shit on this subreddit and on Twitter for only being famous because of his sexuality and not because of any musical merit. To me, Blue Neighbourhood was such an important album because of the ways his sexuality intersected with the music, and thankfully, Troye doubles down HARD on here, aiming for a much more mature and polished body of work. It wasn't his commercial breakthrough, and he still doesn't receive respect in a lot of spaces, but I'm personally completely satisfied with the range of experiences he captures in this album, and I think it will hold up for years to come. [Grade: A]

---
**ExtraEater**: quite frankly one of the biggest leaps in quality from debut to sophomore i've seen yet, like damn the guy went from Subpar Neighbourhood to this? whew. also every song title is good.

**J\_Toe**: I wish Boy in Jeans by Ryan Beatty was in this rate instead of Bloom.

**axestogrind**: The amount of GROWTH he's shown between his debut and his sophomore is staggering. Blue Neighbourhood has its moments but the two albums aren't even comparable anymore. Ms. Sivan saw the criticism of BH being faceless, said NOT on my watch and then promptly delivered this fully-formed, cohesive, thought-out piece of pop excellence.

**jamesfog**: much better than his first album xo

**melodyllic\_**: A breathtakingly honest and tender portrayal of young love. The songs are slices of life that can be spliced together into a storyline or interpreted individually, and demonstrate Troye's fervent desire to enjoy the little moments in life, preferably with a special someone.

**amumumyspiritanimal**: Troye stepped his game the fuck up! Blue Neighborhood was a great album but Bloom is just amazing. It's popping, it's dipping, it's spinning with sheer queer energy and happiness and I'm so glad to be able to listen to it. It reaches a level of class I couldn't dream of, and he managed to do it without filter songs. Every song has a purpose and a message, and he managed to make a unique song like Plum. I FULLY STAN. the album is a must have for every gay teen and I think it might turn into a classic a few years in the future, it's definitely pawing the way for upcoming expressive gay artists. [tens across the board]

**patronsaintofaspies**: I listened to Bloom last year and thought it was pretty boring, but coming back to it after months made the record grow a little on me. I still think Troye needs to find a way to make his identity more prevalent in his sound, and the album being on the slow side bugs me a little at times, but overall I see Bloom as a stellar step in artistic development for Troye. The explictness of Troye's queer identity on tis album compared to Blue Neighbourhood is also refreshing, and ultimately a good sign for the future of LGBTQIA+ pop.

**frogaranaman**: Australian twink.

**waluigiest**: this man wrote an album about being a baby gay and we all relate

**nooodisaster**: okay but why did spotify reorder this album, I just wanna know

**1998tweety**: Love this album a lot; not sure if I like it more than BN yet but it's clear Troye has matured a lot. Can't wait to see what he makes next.

**SkyBlade79**: machine gun kelly was better

**MelodramaticLemonade**: I feel like Troye is blooming to be a top in this album

**oliveoilgarlic**: Waelcome to my gardien we have banaenies and avocaidies

**ManofOranges**: I've never listened to Troye's first album and so I didn't know what to expect from this album. I had listened to My My My when it first came out and that was the only single I'd listened to so I fully expected the album to sound mainly similar to that with more upbeat and high octane song sound. And some of the songs went for that more pop sound but others surprised me with how relaxed they were and they sounded so good while doing it. I honestly think the more relaxed songs are the highlight of this album and I believe that Troye really shines in them. The other songs were hit or miss. Overall though, I think this album is actually really impressive.

**kappyko**: when troye sivan eventually releases his artistic glitch pop masterpiece in 2025 titled "fag" none of you are allowed to say ppl only like it bc hes gay

**mysario**: p chill

TragicKingdom1: # Expectations

---

**Overall average**: 7.359

---

I've said this about a lot of albums at this point, but I really wish I liked this album more. The songwriting and Hayley as a personality really interest me, and there are some really great ideas here, but the production feels pretty cheap for most of the album. Plus, despite the great interludes between the songs, there really isn't a consistent vibe to get into it. I couldn't point to any particular word to describe the album, which is pretty rare to me. Ultimately, I think Hayley does have a niche in the pop sphere, but I would understand if you came out of this album being kind of bored and confused as to why she has a fanbase. [Grade: B+]

---
**ExtraEater**: good album

**J\_Toe**: best album titled Expectations released in 2018

**axestogrind**: UM HOW GOOD is the cover off this album. Lesbians DO do everything better, including but not limited to album artworks, and that's just a fact that we all have to accept I think?

**CarlieScion**: There's apparently a theme for wlw in 2018 - naming their debut tracks/albums Expectations. But why did Hayley choose this name for her album? She says it's because expectations are both the best and the worst part of herself - she has high expectations to both herself and others, which often comes back to bite her in the ass. She's also said that she thinks Expectations is an album best listened to from start to finish, which i definetly agree with. The interludes only makes sense in album context, and the transitions from for example Feelings into What I Need are good enough to warrant a full album listen through. The album deals with themes of love (Wanna Be Missed) - especially being in love with girls who aren't ready to love you back (Curious, HNLY and What I Need), fame (Palm Dreams and Under The Blue/Take Me In), physical and mental illness (Mercy/Gatekeeper) and the loss of a loved one (Molecules). Hayley has said that every track on the album is like a little piece of her history, which is why there are so many different themes covered. Expectations feels very organic, much like Hayley's last two EPs. Both song-writing and production feels like it wasn't put together by a big team in a studio - which is both good and bad. It feels like a clear picture of Hayley and who she wants to be, but there are also a few kinks that makes the album feel more raw - like Hayley's delivery on some of the songs (for example, singing "Sorry that I care", while sounding like she... doesn't care at all). Instrumentally the album is very dreamy and summery. There are lots of drums and at some points, especially vulnerable moments, there are guitars. The album sounds like Los Angeles. Sometimes Hayley experiments with the production, like on Mercy/Gatekeeper, where it switches between a soft melody and almost satanic chanting on Gatekeeper. It's also important to note that Hayley's voice is very husky and smokey, which makes the album seem more raw and organic too - her voice isn't perfect but it is rather unique.

**jamesfog**: i dont like her but her music is quite good.. x

**amumumyspiritanimal**: such an amazing and perfectly crafted album! if it didn't had xx I would've given a perfect score. I mean, it's still flawless though.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I think Hayley suffers a bit compared to her fellow competitors in this rate, because this is her first studio album. She's had time to practice with Disney and EPs, of course, but it's no wonder the themes on Expectations aren't as fleshed out as the ones on Bloom or Palo Santo. Aside from that, I love and support Hayley for being WLW representation as a genderfluid person whose first exposure to queerness was the lesbian community, but as a sort of fellow dyke, come on, sis, you need better producers that don't just slap bass on everything you release! My complaints aside, Hayley is a genuinely talented writer and musician, and I look forward to the rest of her career.

**frogaranaman**: Lesbian.

**lagozzino**: I think this could be a killer album if she actually edited herself, but practically every song keeps going past the point where its run out of musical ideas. My note for almost any song would be "This was nice, but then it just kept going and going"

**waluigiest**: I’m overall underwhelmed with this album but the standout tracks are VERY good

**skargardin**: Some of the songs on this album are real duds for me but I will say that my appreciation for the album grew as I read on some of the inspirations and meanings behind the songs.

**MirandaCrocsgrove**: I think Hayley still excels on EPs. This albums has really high highs, but the fillers kinda drag it and makes me want to avoid listening to it entirely.

**nooodisaster**: Lesbians are so powerful.

**1998tweety**: This album is way better than I remember it. Love all the transitions, makes the album flow super well and work better as a body of art.

**MelodramaticLemonade**: My gay ass's go-to album for sobbing other than Melodrama

**oliveoilgarlic**: I admit my expectations were higher for this album but I’m lesbian and in the end I have nothing but respect for my president

**ManofOranges**: When I first listened to this album when it came out, I was fairly underwhelmed honestly. The only track I had listened to and really had any kind of liking for was Sleepover. All the other tracks to me felt very meh and I really thought this was a fairly weak album. After listening to it a few times for this rate, however, it's really grown on me. I really appreciate the production on these songs as it's really what makes this album stand out in my opinion. I think this was a very solid attempt by Hayley to make a very cohesive and thematic album and I think for the most part she succeeded. The only thing that hinders this album in my opinion is that sometimes it gets too repetitive without making the repetitive sections really enjoyable so sometimes I'm just left waiting for the tracks to end. Other than that though, I think this album is really good, and I really look forward to what Hayley will come up with next.

**kappyko**: ex act tries to make melodrama and ends up with more bops but also too extra. production sucks. i blame this album beign bad on the ugly stiff production courtesy of that dickhead and the ugly vocal takes by hayley. kehlani is the saving grace

**strawberryswing1**: An unremarkable album

**mysario**: p groovy

TragicKingdom1: # Palo Santo

---

**Overall average**: 7.957

---

Despite being a huge fan of Years & Years already, I only had moderate expectations for this album because I felt like they were going to continue with the same sound they already developed on the previous record and not move beyond that. However, I was pleasantly surprised that I actually enjoy this much more than Communion! It's a lot more polished and even though the filler tracks are easy to identify, everything is working at a higher base standard of hooks and production than before. In addition, I feel like there's more standout tracks that have made me much more able to get people to stop sleeping on them when I share it with them. This is definitely a darker album in its sounds from their previous era, but in a way that gives off more badassery rather than sadness. I think that if more people listened to this album, Y&Y have the potential to be on par with Troye's popularity, at least on this subreddit or on stan twitter. [Grade: A+]

---
**ExtraEater**: good album title

**J\_Toe**: favourite album of the lot. I love the ambition and execution behind this album and the whole aesthetic behind its promotion and video(s). (Yet another reminder that the Dirty Computer Emotion picture belonged in this rate, but would have blown everything else out of the water)

**axestogrind**: LITERALLY forgot how consistently strong this album is throughout, probably the most consistent album out of the 3 quality wise (but also arguably sonically). There might be a few mediocre-at-best songs but there's no songs that are straight duds, I believe they snapped your honour.

**jamesfog**: best gay album :yas:

**amumumyspiritanimal**: such an amazing and well thought out album, they really found their sound. the album feels so primal and soulful yet intricate and beautiful and capturing. one of the best albums of the decade, most definitely. the only problem it has is with song placements and order, but in the age of streaming and playlists thats not a big deal.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Isn't it funny that we've rated both of Years and Years' albums when every other sphere of the pop world pays them even less dust? As a person who wasn't a huge fan of their previous record, Palo Santo was a huge surprise and a solid improvement that stood out upon my first few listens of it. It still has filler here and there, but Olly has ultimately adopted a level of artistic vision and identity on Palo Santo that rarely emerged prior to its release. If Years and Years keep on honing themselves like they did for this era in the future, I'll be very interested to see what kind of music they'll make in the future.

**frogaranaman**: English twink.

**lagozzino**: Top album of 2018 don't even try to tell me otherwise.

**waluigiest**: this is the highest quality album of the rate but the one with the least clout. Beautiful writing, vocals, instrumentals.... knocked it out of the park

**skargardin**: I love this album.

**nooodisaster**: So I listened to this album and was like 'wow, the storyline is so powerful and clear, I love it!' And then I realized I'd listened to it on shuffle, lmfao.

**1998tweety**: I love how sexual and synthy this entire album is. Very consistent with a couple of high peaks without any real duds.

**MelodramaticLemonade**: As much as I appreciate a happy gay album, I can't relate AT ALL

**oliveoilgarlic**: electronic beats to try on floral button downs in the H&M dressing room to

**ManofOranges**: This album is, in my opinion, arguably the most conventionally pop out of these 3 albums and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that. If anything I think that may assist it in the rankings. Or maybe not, I'm not sure. For me it makes the album the most appealing in terms of sound but also makes it feel like everything blends together a bit at times. It's not a bad album by any means though. It has its fair share of amazing songs and, in my opinion, the best song in the rate. So that must say something.

**kappyko**: white men made points. for once. no seriously the production on this is more mysterious and evocative than the actually fucking beige dance pop on all of bloom or the sludgefest and compression and honking of hayley kiyoko

**mysario**: p rad
