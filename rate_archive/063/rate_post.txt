The 20GayTeen Rate!!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/amazap/the_20gayteen_rate/

2018 was a great year for LGBT-centric media, with movies like *The Miseducation of Cameron Post* and *Love, Simon* garnering critical acclaim and television shows like *Queer Eye* and *Pose* captivating the world. Music was no exception, and given the high percentage of LGBT people on this subreddit (over half of the userbase, according to the last census), it is understandable that we would want to celebrate the achievements of queer artists this year with the highest honor that can be bestowed in this subreddit: a rate. With that being said, let's introduce the albums we are rating!

(In the tracklistings below, there are YouTube links to music videos or if the song is unavailable on major streaming services.

# Troye Sivan - *Bloom*

It's hard to be a gay member of Gen Z and not have heard of Troye Sivan. In the early 2010s, he got his start as a YouTube vlogger, becoming one of the most prominent LGBT creators on the site. Given his background in musical theater, it seemed natural to pivot to music like all YouTubers seem to do at some point (regardless of their talent.) His debut single "Happy Little Pill" reached #92 on the Billboard Hot 100, and his career only went up from there. His debut album *Blue Neighbourhood* was released in late 2015 and reached #7 on the Billboard 200, as well as spawning his first top 40 hit "Youth." 

That leads us into his sophomore effort *Bloom.* Often favorably compared to Lorde's *Melodrama,* the album explores extremely personal experiences of Troye's as a gay person over some of the most sophisticated pop production in the industry. The album may not have been a commercial breakout for Troye, but it definitely proved his artistic worth as a short but sweet slice of synthpop.

# Hayley Kiyoko - *Expectations*

Hayley Kiyoko, dubbed "Lesbian Jesus" by her fanbase, has had an extremely interesting career trajectory. She got her start as a member of the girl group The Stunners, which also contained future Dancing With The Stars 10th-placer Tinashe. From there, she had her breakout acting role in the Disney Channel Original Movie *Lemonade Mouth,* where she played the edgy one (if I recall correctly.) After that movie somehow failed to produce a sequel, she stayed under the radar until the release of her unapologetic lesbian anthem "Girls Like Girls" in 2015, which is probably her biggest hit to date. This established her away from the Disney branding and developed her fanbase as an independent queer artist.

That brings us to her long awaited debut album *Expectations,* which arrived this year after Hayley was stuck in EP purgatory for half a decade. The album has received praise on the subreddit for its uptempo bops, as well as for having great transitions between the tracks, making it a complete sonic experience from front-to-back. Again, we're in synthpop territory, with lyrics relating to Hayley's experiences as an out lesbian woman.

# Years & Years - *Palo Santo*

Compared to the other artists in this rate, Years & Years (lead by openly gay frontman Olly Alexander) have experienced a lower level of notoriety on stan twitter and in the pop music community as a whole. Despite this, they have a number of accomplishments to their name. In early 2015, they won the annual BBC Sound of... poll, which launched their career in the United Kingdom as their next single "King" debuted at #1 there. That summer, their debut album *Communion* was released and gained a cult following that lingered until the beginning of their second era.

Their second album, titled *Palo Santo* began with a splash with the high-budget, futuristic video for the lead single "Sanctify" capturing the attention of the pop music community. The visual unity of the era through its [short film](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gfsndFf0PU8), combined with the slick electropop sound (so electronic, in fact, that Billboard counts the group as electronic dance music) lead them to a much more critically acclaimed release this time around. In addition, they returned to the UK top 10 when "If You're Over Me" peaked at #6.

* Metacritic Score - 81
* Pitchfork Score - 6.5

That's not all, however! Each of the artists involved have several loosies, features, or rare tracks from these eras that deserve to be rated in an **OPTIONAL** bonus rate. I've also thrown in the biggest singles from MNEK's 2018 album, as I came very close to including *Language* in the original submission of this rate, as well as Rita Ora's pop girl collaboration "Girls," for reasons that should be clear to you if you were on this subreddit during its release. Like all bonus rates, you cannot give any of these songs your 11 or 0. **You can rate as few or as many of these tracks as you'd like!**

# Da Rulez:

* Listen to every song listed (excluding the bonus rate, which is optional) and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). You can use up to one decimal place, although I recommend only using integers and multiples of 0.5, because you're not special for giving a song a 7.3.
* You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11). These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. You also must leave a comment on any song you give an 11 or 0, but only if you are /u/Piccprincess or /u/CarlieScion.
* You must use the prepared link to send in your scores.
* Feel free to PM me on Reddit or Discord if you'd like to change any of your scores.
* I reserve the right to reject any ballots that I suspect of sabotage, and to expose your scores in a variety of humiliating ways. 
* You can also add comments to any song or album! The following format is the only acceptable format for song and album comments, respectively:

> xx: 1 why is this in the rate?

> Album: Bloom: As an aspiring botanist, this album speaks to me. 

Any of the following formats are INCORRECT and must be CORRECTED or your ballot will be REJECTED:

> Here: 1 - Alessia Cara did it better!

> Running Shoes: as somebody with no use of their legs, i have to give this a 1.

> Karma: /u/Elitefourbrad 1

> Seventeen (Reprise): (1) Only Lorde is allowed to have reprises on an album!

> Lucky Strike: 1: Lucky Strike sounds like a future hit. That's not a good thing.

> Album: Expectations (okay, but what about the Lesbian Holy Spirit?)

> Album: Palo Santo - WE FUCKING WANTED MNEK !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
