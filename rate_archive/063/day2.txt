Jax Jones makes bops and y'all should check out his EP if you enjoyed this track! I think this is the best song on there, and I think it's really refreshing to have an EDM song that doesn't rely too heavily on a drop.

---
**jamesfog** (10): uk hit

**twat\_brained** (9.2): love the vibes on this one

**tapdancingpig** (9): A bop and a half

**1998tweety** (8): A fun bop

**ChaseLights** (8): This is the part where I say that I like Jax Jones a lot and while I don't think this is his best song, it's still a pretty good jam and I mean it's not like they could have served us Breathe 2.0 (but they totally could have)

**nooodisaster** (8): Honestly when I first listened to the album I didn't even realize this was a bonus track, it fits so well into his discography.

**axestogrind** (5): Its position at the end of the album that it was tacked onto for bonus streams makes it so disappointing WOW...

**frogaranaman** (5): I got nothing creative for this, the song’s meddling.

**lagozzino** (5): "Bland" adjective: lacking strong features or characteristics and therefore uninteresting.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): I either find Jax Jones songs incredible or incredibly mediocre and this is the latter

**skargardin** (4): Fun bop but this has got to be some of the most uninspired shit I’ve heard in a long time.

**selegend** (3): i usually jax jones’ music and y&y but this doesnt work

**melodyllic\_** (2): wow it's very repetitive even for a jax jones song

Olly dives headfirst into his falsetto on this song, which considering how he already sounds normally is a huge risk. However, I think it really pays up! He sounds like he's exerting himself but in a way that's so exuberant over getting the words of the song out of his mouth.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): this song screams 20gayteen summer to me i love it

**kappyko** (10): it's no like a prayer but its fucking great okay

**lilguavachan** (10): we love a coming out anthem

**melodyllic\_** (10): the instant standout for me tbh. a total banger and one of my anthems for 20gayteen

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): a bop, but sounds filler-ish

**skargardin** (10): C’mon single material!

**ramskick** (9): I feel like my friends look at me as the preacher of Years and Years music.

**1998tweety** (8.3): The bridge is interesting but I'm not sure if this song is the best fit for something like that. Otherwise, I like it.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): still enjoying it but my cold is not allowing me to fully appreciate this music ugh

**CarlieScion** (8): that falsetto

**lagozzino** (8): Just a fun fact for you: Olly wrote this with the intention of giving it to Nick Jonas. Knowing that, his vocals do kinda sound like Nick's at certain points here.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8): THIS MAKES ME WANT TO SIN

**ChaseLights** (7): Yes take me to CHURCH but I'm kind of a sinful bitch so I don't like spending a lot of time there

**jamesfog** (7): drag him x

**nooodisaster** (6.5): ended the catholic church

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): This song isn’t as distinct as the last few sadly

**frogaranaman** (5): Reminds me of 2003.

**oliveoilgarlic** (5): not even the best gay seduction song where they rhyme “preacher” with “teacher”

**SkyBlade79** (4): idk this imagery

**waluigiest** (4): okay the first dud of the album. Don’t like his vocals and the lyrics are kinda dumb

**skargardin** (7): Confession time: I've never played a game with these, in my head, "new" Eeveelutions. This one's pretty weird.

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): The vegan one. Kinda pushy, but will still ultimately respect you if you don't convert. Rolls their eyes any time someone talks about PETA with them.

**waluigiest** (5): weird how Gen 4 is the best generation but the eeveelutions flopped :/

If you've had any sort of serious conversation with me on Discord, you probably know that I am deeply closeted and have virtually zero experience with real life romance. When I think of my hopes and dreams for a future relationship, this is the song I imagine being the anthem behind it. It's just dripping in atmosphere and subtle power. It's a deeply personal song not because it's particularly revelatory, but because it really makes you feel like you're living in Troye's blissful world. I know this isn't the catchiest song, but it's my favorite song by Troye because it delivers an unfiltered, vulnerable, incredibly gay feeling directly into my bloodstream.

---
**lilguavachan** (11): it's so... dreamy and atmospheric. and i'm just a huge sucker for cheesy ballads about being in love (especially when it's gay).

**melodyllic\_** (11): what a massive sounding song. an amazing closer and the perfect encapsulation of the album's essence: a tender and euphoric love punctuated by moments of desperation and tension

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (11): Pitchfork made some points when they compared this track to Frank Ocean’s Blonde. It’s a soaring, atmospheric track that defies genre, taking from ambient electronic, traditional pop, indie music, and more. It’s perhaps the most mature song on the record, the part of the record where we reflect on all that has happened, a bombastic finish that is as pensive as it is simple. There’s no questioning, but instead there’s a simple statement: “I am an animal with you.” Animal is rabid, a track that feels both incredibly intimate and absolutely massive. This closer is easily the greatest song on the album and the best piece of music Troye Sivan has created thus far.

**1998tweety** (10): My other choice I was debating for my 11, love this song so so much; an awesome closer to the album that packs so much emotion into it. There's something so primal about saying you're an animal for someone, which I love even more with the context that Troye is gay (although I don't think this was his intention when making the song).

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): how can a song be so perfect oof

**lagozzino** (10): I'm a sucker for these kind of slow build arrangements, and the noisy climax that this builds to is divine.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (10): Such a cinematic and perfect closer

**nooodisaster** (10): What a closer. This is haunting yet romantic, hellish yet beautiful.

**Chelzero** (9): very chill pop, but that's not a bad thing. Would have given 10 but I'm not feeling the bridge, I find it a bit jarring

**frogaranaman** (9): Animals are multicellular eukaryotic organisms that form the biological kingdom Animalia. With few exceptions, animals consume organic material, breathe oxygen, are able to move, can reproduce sexually, and grow from a hollow sphere of cells, the blastula, during embryonic development. Over 1.5 million living animal species have been described—of which around 1 million are insects—but it has been estimated there are over 7 million animal species in total. Animals range in length from 8.5 millionths of a metre to 33.6 metres (110 ft) and have complex interactions with each other and their environments, forming intricate food webs. The category includes humans, but in colloquial use the term animal often refers only to non-human animals. The study of non-human animals is known as zoology.

**ManofOranges** (9): Kesha only slightly outsold

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9): This is the type of song that you listen to late at night right before you go to sleep and want to hear one song that ends the day for you

**axestogrind** (8): This has the same energy as those slow as fuck critically acclaimed movies that take forever to get to the action but by the end it's super worth it

**ggodisawomann** (8): this bops

**ramskick** (8): I like to think I'm an animal of some sorts. I particularly identify with the sloth.

**kappyko** (7.5): okay that bridge served frank ocean A R T Y rnb and is really good which makes me sad the rest of the song is a mid ballad... outro is cute though

**CarlieScion** (7): eh, not that strong of a closer

**twat\_brained** (7): i just checked and saw there were two extras ugh i thought this was it

**ChaseLights** (6.5): I went back to sleep

**patronsaintofaspies** (6): I get that Troye is trying to portray a queer relationship in the forbidden love model here, but I'm really tired of queerness being associated with sin and disgrace, even if it's as a literary device done by queer people, and I hate to just basically fall onto cliche complaints about Troye when I don't even dislike him, but, nah, the way he's singing Animal isn't making me convinced that he's done something really scandalous at all. By golly, the boy needs to work on his voice. It can get really boring. Overall, a not insignificant but ultimately poor closer.

**jamesfog** (5): overrated. bad bridge too. :sorry:

**waluigiest** (5): I….. this is so hyped up and so underwhelming

**tapdancingpig** (3): This just rings hollow.

**ImADudeDuh** (0): Troye Sivan in the most calm voice ever - .....i am an animal.............

This is the big atmosphere setter of the album, with the main focus being on Olly's delicate vocals as he croons about how obsessed he is with his new lover. I think

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): they should've released it after the h&m campaign but ok

**axestogrind** (10): When the album first came out a lot complained about how out-of-place this felt within the tracklist and, while that's kinda true, it doesn't stop this song from being literally gorgeous talented amazing beautiful brilliant never been done before totally unique. When he hit the high oOoooooOOOs I really felt that.

**lilguavachan** (10): i'm just.... a huge sucker for ballads.

**tapdancingpig** (10): The bridge made me fall immediately in love with every other part of the song.

**waluigiest** (10): his voice…… I’m crying and cumming

**skargardin** (9.5): Sure, it’s on a kind of an iffy spot in the tracklist but it provides a nice moment of serenity and THOSE VOCALS?! Perfection.

**ExtraEater** (8.5): palo hypno

**kappyko** (8.5): very effectively cute

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8.5): this is beautiful this makes me want a man so bad

**1998tweety** (8.4): This is a nice ballad although I prefer their bops; lyrics are nice though.

**ramskick** (8): From the moment I heard Years and Years for the first time, Olly's voice hypnotised me.

**SkyBlade79** (8): this feels like a The Weeknd song and I love it

**twat\_brained** (7.7): if only the song was as hypnotic as Olly's heart

**ChaseLights** (7.5): A slower jam, not quite my fave but I can HEAR the emotion Olly sweetie

**nooodisaster** (7): my heart has been dickmatized https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Y_2snD9nrY

**patronsaintofaspies** (6.5): I'd call this the earliest track on Years and Years' album that I'm not a fan of. I actually think Hypnotised starts out kind of strong, seeing as it stands lut more immediately mysterious and captivating than most other ballads stuck in the middle of these kinds of albums; that being said, Olly's voice isn't good enough to lift the rest of the song up, and in the end Hypnotised unfortunately isn't much better than standard filler fare. Bonus points for spelling Hypnotised with an s instead of a z, though. WE FUCKING WANT BRITISH ENGLISH!!!

**CarlieScion** (6): i'm sorry this was kinda boring

**jamesfog** (6): filler

**melodyllic\_** (6): v minimal and stripped down but i'm not sure these types of songs are the best suited to his voice

**frogaranaman** (4): Reminds me of 1770.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (4): I don’t mind ballads but this isn’t very special at all

whew the TALENT jumped out with this collaboration. I listened to the Greatest Showman soundtrack back when the movie released but never got around to watching the film, and I didn't remember this particular song at all until this cover was released. And they made it a total bop! It's slightly funky but also just a wholesome bop. Jess and Olly sound great together, and I hope the UK hype machine for The Greatest Showman doesn't end before this gets a chance to become a hit over there.

---
**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): ok dis a bop

**poppinmmolly** (10): a bop!!

**skargardin** (9): GLYNNCELS RISE UP

**1998tweety** (8.5): Glyncells rise UP. This song is TK-core to the Ava MAX.

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): Holy shit, I expected this to suck and it didn’t!

**ChaseLights** (8): I mean this is a good song in the musical and I like their cover, so fair is fair. I am TIRED of Jess Glynne though.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): This song is too good for the Greatest Showman soundtrack tbh

**static\_int\_husp** (11): The most logical extension for an Eevee. Flareon is that kid you knew who was closeted in high school but you see them five years later living their best gay life. Smokes weed but doesn't make it part of their personality. Super fun to be around, but still a smol floof at heart.

**frogaranaman** (10): If you don't give every single one a 10, fuck you.

This song is odd because it feels mildly glorious during the chorus slash "na na na"s but the verses are just SUPREMELY unimpressive. Like, there was clearly only one idea for this track and they fleshed it out and called it a day. Really love the distorted trumpets in the instrumentation though.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): so beautiful

**axestogrind** (10): Don't know what instrument (trumpets? horns? I'm ACTUALLY a dumbass) that is in the chorus, but its usage here is SOOOO fucking cool.

**ManofOranges** (10): Chemists across the world are quaking in their lab coats

**ramskick** (9.5): There are very few molecules in my brain that don't actively love this song.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (9.5): The synth with the chorus sends me, this song could have been a great closer

**CarlieScion** (9): This song was inspired by something rather tragic. The brother of one of Hayley's friends was murdered. She said the whole situation felt so pointless and hopeless. At the memorial, somebody recited a poem with the lines "he’s not gone, [it's] just that his molecules have rearranged". You can feel Hayley's pain when she's singing "I've lost you" - but it also sounds like she's singing "I've lost truth".

**selegend** (9): really sentimental and sweet

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (9): Nobody really talked about this track when the album came out but I hope this does decently well in the rate, it’s an album highlight.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This would've been a suitable closing song as well.

**kappyko** (8.5): this one's cool. you're cool. love the 8bit stuff

**nooodisaster** (7.3): :)

**ChaseLights** (7): She could have ended the album here

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): This song will be played at my funeral just sayin

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): There are some beautiful melodic choices in Molecules, but at the end of the day the ballad is, like so many other songs on Expactations, obscured by mediocre production and deprived from the ability to present its greatest strengths. In the context of my comments, this is cliche to say at this point, but it doesn't make my complaints any less valid.

**twat\_brained** (7): still feels like filler and definitely solidifies my confirmation that the album falls off after Curious. And the ambience here is good, I was on an airport shuttle and just felt lost in space and time. Then again that might just be from this cold I’m having; I blew my nose so hard that I damaged my nerves around my right eye

**waluigiest** (7): when I listen to this song I have the intense suspicion that it thought it did something

**melodyllic\_** (6): has an interesting structure but i don't think the song manages to maintain the momentum of the first verse

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (5.6): it's been more than a year and i still can't remember how this song sounds

**frogaranaman** (5): https://redd.it/8anzmy

**rosecoloreds** (5): i feel like a faux wlw for giving Hayley low rates but what can i say... i had high Expectations and was disappointed

The opener to the album, "Seventeen" recounts Troye's experience with having sex with older men back in his youth. Personally, I imagine these encounters taking place in a gas station bathroom and Troye not knowing that the other guy should use a condom, but I digress. I think the song sonically really fits the lyrical topic because it captures this sense of melancholic nostalgia. Just like with other things we're nostalgic for, having illegal sex in your youth probably wasn't the best idea in hindsight, but as Troye sums it up, "it was real to me."

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): King of Grindr U g h

**axestogrind** (10): A gorgeous look into the psyche of young mlm and the sexualisation that surrounds the identity. Masters the tightrope walk of poignancy while being a catchy pop song. Basically perfect?

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): is sex even real?

**ramskick** (10): If there weren't better songs in this rate I'd give this song a Seventeen out of 10.

**jamesfog** (9.5): GOOD intro

**ChaseLights** (9): Great intro to the album, dark but still a bop, shame the album goes downhill from here

**MelodramaticLemonade** (9): Perfect opening track the new Spotify tracklist could never

**melodyllic\_** (9): despite being quite a regular sounding synth heavy lorde-esque song, the tenderness of it really wins you over

**waluigiest** (9): BABY GAY…. Baby gay :(

**nooodisaster** (8.5): A great intro to the album. The lyrics are confessional, overtly sexual, and a bit uncomfortable (with the age), which are all recurring themes of the album. It's a bit understated, but still a bop, and a great prologue to the main love story.

**twat\_brained** (8.1): Not really into the themes here but it sounds gorgeous!

**1998tweety** (8): This is a cute little opener but I feel like it doesn't really work in any other context. I don't really listen to this song unless I'm listening to the entire album. Annoying that Spotify changed the order cause it really takes away from this song.

**frogaranaman** (8): Seventeen (Hangul: ???), also stylized as SEVENTEEN or SVT, is a South Korean boy group formed by Pledis Entertainment in 2015. The group consists of thirteen members divided into three sub-units, each with a different area of specialization: a 'Hip-Hop Unit', 'Vocal Unit', and 'Performance Unit'. Seventeen has released two studio albums and five extended plays.

**selegend** (8): grindr anthem

**tapdancingpig** (8): These lyrics feel a little childish... but they work.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): watches call me by your name once: “and he said age is just a number”

**Chelzero** (7.5): I'm kind of uncomfortable about the subject (I didn't like CMBYN sorry don't hit me) but the song itself has a nice vibe

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): king of jail baiting

**kappyko** (7.5): okay but alessia cara already did this concept of opening track named seventeen better and sharon van etten also outsold

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): So, I'm kinda known in my friend circle for being super suspicious and anxious towards age gaps in sexual and romantic relationships because of past trauma I've had related to similar situations, a bias which I've often expressed in my undying hatred of media such as Call Me By Your Name. The thing, is though, I can't be mad at Troye for writing Seventeen. I'm still giving this song a relatively low score because it makes me nervous occasionally, but I had a talk with somebody recently where we discussed the fact that oftentimes, queer youth are faced with the terrible choice of hiding their identities or entering into ethically ambiguous relationships with much older people, which I think is what Troye is trying to go for here. It's not directly stated until the song's reprise, but I think the underlying implications in Seventeen's narrative are that, yes, Troye did get to express his sexuality for the first time during the encounter he describes in his lyrics, but despite that fundamental effect of said encounter, something about it just wasn't quite right. Troye's retelling of his past is something that I think is done with care and responsibility, and at the end of the day I don't have any misgivings towards how he feels about his story.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (7.5): I never thought that we could get a ballad about grindr hookups while underaged but here we are

**ManofOranges** (7): Cute song and all but I don't think it's like cream of the crop or anything like that

**oliveoilgarlic** (6.5): generic production but bold lyrics

**ggodisawomann** (6): this is cute

**lagozzino** (6): This song honestly makes me a little uncomfortable. Like its literally about an older man taking an underaged guy's virginity. Its a relatable gay experience but like... don't open your album with it.

**SkyBlade79** (6): gives me some creepy vibes but good overall

**J\_Toe** (3): Look, no. No, Troye. No. I guess this song is supposed to sound sweet and nostalgic, about a seeming rite of passage for Troye in losing his virginity. But it just sounds creepy hearing him repeat that a guy in his thirties told teenage Troye that age is just a number. It sounds like there's a power imbalance here and that Troye is being exploited. I wouldn't be surprised if in the future Troye retires this song.

This is the definition of a "mild bop." It has a very midrange vibe where it feels slow enough to resonate with the emotion but also fast enough to bop to. The "can you hear me howwwwwllll" riff is subtley extremely catchy, and it makes the song what it is.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): should've been on the standard edition but O K

**ManofOranges** (10): I don't really know why but this song is just so enticing to me it just has that extra something that makes it so good

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): im only giving this a 10 so u/fax5jrj won't castrate me jk this song really issa 10

**Chelzero** (9.5): a bop and a half

**jamesfog** (9.5): This sounds like a Lorde song

**ramskick** (9): I'm a really bad singer so I'm sure that whenever I sing along to Years and Years it sounds like howling.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Okay maybe this bonus track deserves rights.

**1998tweety** (8.1): This is cute, sounds kind of filler-ish so it's good its on the deluxe.

**axestogrind** (8): At this point in the tracklist it's really apparent that, like, there's no bad songs on this album... there just isn't... no matter how hard they try they refused to make a bad song on this one.

**ChaseLights** (8): A werewolf dance-bop

**ImADudeDuh** (8): furry KING

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): A lot of the tracks on this album don’t have much in the way of progression, but this song has some considerable buildup between the verses and chorus that works pretty well. It’s a relatively minimalist track on an album full of pulsating, sometimes dizzying instrumentals, and as a result it’s easily one of the strongest on the record.

**lagozzino** (7.5): In my opinion this is catchy enough to be considered for a single, but I get why it was left off the main album. It's just a bit too cheery for the rest of the mood.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): Also a bop

**melodyllic\_** (7): nice harmonies but we've established that. a bit unnecessary and doesn't add anything to the album.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): S.O.S. she's in disguise/S.O.S. she's in disguise/There's a she wolf in disguise/coming out, coming out, coming out/A domesticated girl that's all you ask of me/Darling, it is no joke, this is lycanthropy./Moon's awake now, with eyes wide open/My body is craving, so feed the hungry/I've been devoting myself to you Monday to Monday/and Friday to Friday/Not getting enough retribution or decent incentives to keep me/at it/Starting to feel just a little abused like a/coffee machine in an office, ah/So I'm gonna go somewhere closer to get me a lover and tell you about it/There's a she wolf in the closet/Open up and set it free [wolf sound]/There's a she wolf in the closet/Let it out so it can breathe [inhales, exhales]/Sitting across the bar, staring right at her prey/It's going well so far, she's gonna get her way/Nocturnal creatures are not so prudent/The moon's my teacher, and I'm her student./To locate the single man I've got on me a special radar/And the fire department's hot line in case I get in trouble later/Not looking for cute little divas or rich city guys that just want to enjoy/I'm having a very good time and behave very bad in the arms of a boy/There's a she wolf in the closet/Open up and set it free [wolf sound]

**nooodisaster** (6): this better be a deluxe track

**frogaranaman** (5): Reminds me of 5000 BCE.

**J\_Toe** (5): honestly, the average of scores I give this album probably drop because of the bonus tracks.

Pusha T who? This is the greatest diss track of 2018. I find the glee that Olly takes in just EVISCERATING his emotionally abusive ex super satisfying and delightful. I think the melody adds to this: the rhythm at which he lists the problems with his former flame reminds me a lot of playground mockery, but in a way that's also super catchy.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): one of the best breakup songs ever. you can just feel the stories behind it. the minimalist instrumental early on is also a nice touch, it works amazingly well, and the transition into the power-heavy bass-y instrumental works extremely well.

**CarlieScion** (10): a very interesting instrumental, but they pull it off well!

**skargardin** (10): living for the pettiness on display here. FINISH HIM

**nooodisaster** (9.9): This grew on me the most of any song. At first I hated the production, but everything else was so good I had to stan. The lyrics and vocal melody are beautiful, and THAT FALSETTO. Y&Y is at their best when Olly's reading his ex for filth, and this is the best example. "You think you're special/But maybe I wouldn't agree" I have to laugh every time. Overall my fav lyrics of the album, as well as the catchiest song, this is such a winner. Still, I wish there was an acoustic version just to hear what it'd be like without the Rugrats theme-song playing as the background. So yeah, gotta subtract some points.

**ChaseLights** (9.5): This is the kind of bop you listen to when you're walking out of your raggedy ex's apartment with a box of all the things he said he's not keeping and you remind yourself that you're better off without that manipulative drunk, fuck u C***y, I'll pray for your liver because you really tore that shit up and you were lousy in bed anyways but anyways have a nice life, i really came off better in the long run

**ramskick** (9): whenever a Years and Years song gets out of my head I feel like it made a lucky escape

**waluigiest** (9): the beats the lyrics the honesty woah

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8.5): God they're minds....the storytelling

**axestogrind** (8): GET HIM OLLIE!!! DRAG IT!!!!! Imagine being his ex and getting this song written about you wow I would just straight die on the spot...

**kappyko** (8): cute!!!!

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): The production this slaps

**1998tweety** (7.8): I like the lyrics on this, but there are some weird sounds going on in the background and I'm not sure if it works.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): BOP

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): In the context of this rate, Lucky Escape is a very nice contrast to Troye's Lucky Strike. To be clear, the latter song is better, at least in my mind, but Lucky Escape is still a pretty decent ballad. Olly's voice may not be all that appealing to me, but the emotional weight carried by it makes Lucky Escape's themes heavier and more haunting; it's probably the best slow song on Palo Santo, if I think about it.

**twat\_brained** (7.4): I damn near had a lucky escape from doing this rate until TK forced my ass lol i feel you olly

**melodyllic\_** (7): a bit too much autotune in the chorus and it's a bit lackluster after the excellent preacher

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (6.7): is this a dig at Olly's ex ?? also the bridge is the best part, too bad it wasn't extended enough

**jamesfog** (6): overrated

**ImADudeDuh** (5): why is there those BWOMPs on the second verse

**frogaranaman** (4): Reminds me of 1293.

Ugh, I really wish this made the US edition of the album over Rendezvous or Howl. I think having a darker house song would've really rounded out the album and added a little more variety. That being said, it doesn't stand out too much because there isn't a ton of tension being built up.

**ChaseLights** (9): It's so rude that they left this off the standard and the deluxe when they could have easily just dumped the title track

**1998tweety** (8.7): Another big bop that should've been on the standard (or at least the deluxe). Robbed.

**skargardin** (8): Hmm it feels kinda similar thematically to some of the later tracks on the main album but it’s definitely not bad.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): Bop but Joni Mitchell outsold

**lagozzino** (6): I'm totally fine with this having been left off most editions. It's a decent filler track and not much else.

**frogaranaman** (5): Sure.

**melodyllic\_** (2): this feels like a skeleton of a song?? apart from the vocals & bass there's nothing of substance here

This song explores a feeling of simultaneous danger and excitement in a relationship. The production (especially on the vocal front) is extremely catchy, and I think it's just a really neat song in both concept and execution.

---
**nooodisaster** (11): MAYBE OUR TIME HAS COME! MAYBE WE'RE OVERGROWN!! EVEN THE SWEETEST PLUM!!! HAS ONLY GOT, SO, LONG!!!! Okay so I don't really have an alliance in this and would be happy with any of the three winning. So I'm just voting for my favorite song here. If any of you dumb homos give this less than an 8, maybe gays don't deserve rights.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): literally one of the best songs of the decade

**ExtraEater** (10): a big surprise from the non-singles section when i first listened in 2018. what a great chorus and riff

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): this bitch knows what she's doing because "Plum" sounds a lot like "cum" in here

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Really surprised I don't hear more about Plum. Troye delivers a fantastic chorus here, the likes of which I'd like to see more from him, and the song as a whole deals with the relationship between sensuality and maturity that's way less anxiety-inducing to me than Seventeen or Bloom. I really hope this does well.

**ramskick** (10): This is a really sweet plum that has lasted a really long time.

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (10): An amazing bop, the production and his voice just slaps! A banger that I keep going back to and it delivers every time. Deserved to be a single (but looking at how many songs on this album are singles, he'll probably release it anyways with a great video)

**1998tweety** (9.8): I'm sure I'm like the tenth person to say this but it really sounds like he says cum instead of plum. This song has so much energy into it, hopefully it gets a video.

**jamesfog** (9): underrated

**melodyllic\_** (9): a nice bop in the vein of my my my and bloom, i would rank it higher than bloom but lower than my my my

**skargardin** (9): Makes this a single STATT

**axestogrind** (8): The sexual undertones, oft linked to botanicals and its connotations of femininity, that are prevalent throughout the entire album are kinda brilliant TBH be honest? [gavel slam] NOBEL LITERATURE PRIZE!

**CarlieScion** (8): BOP

**ChaseLights** (8): Y'all do the most on this song, it's not that great

**Chelzero** (8): I have a soft spot for sad EDM songs. the drop is pretty weak though

**ggodisawomann** (8): I love this

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Even the sweetest cum

**letsallpoo** (8): "heh heh the plum is my BUTTHOLE xD"

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8): Troye finally delivered the sad bottom bop wow

**selegend** (8): super cute metaphor, but the lyrics are quite sad

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (8): watches call me by your name once: “the ripest peach or pear”

**frogaranaman** (6): A plum is a fruit of the subgenus Prunus of the genus Prunus. The subgenus is distinguished from other subgenera (peaches, cherries, bird cherries, etc.) in the shoots having terminal bud and solitary side buds (not clustered), the flowers in groups of one to five together on short stems, and the fruit having a groove running down one side and a smooth stone (or pit). Mature plum fruit may have a dusty-white waxy coating that gives them a glaucous appearance. This is an epicuticular wax coating and is known as "wax bloom". Dried plum fruits are called "dried plums" or prunes, although, in many countries, prunes are a distinct type of dried plum having a wrinkled appearance.

**hjeIp** (6): gay filler

**J\_Toe** (6): I like the sound of this song enough, but the song is so dour.

**tapdancingpig** (6): The production here is fun, but the lyrics are kind of nothing, and the hook is weak as hell.

**carly-rae\_sremmurd** (5): these lyrics...

**ManofOranges** (5): Out of all the fruits he chose to sing about a plum???

**waluigiest** (5): eh

**kappyko** (1.5): fart-y synths annoying guitar drop bad lyrical metaphor bland

**SkyBlade79** (0): this is major filler

**tchalla1966** (0): meh

This is decent, but I'm not really sure what tone it's trying to go for. I think it would be much stronger if it fully committed to being more of a slow jam, but the bass just feels out of place as it is. There's not a lot of momentum flowing through the song but it sounds pleasant, I guess.

---
**1998tweety** (10): A sex bop. Love the bass in the chorus.

**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): god shes so amazing i glad we have a lesbian queen like her

**ManofOranges** (10): This song takes me back to the crush I had last year and still kinda this year on this guy who was in my anatomy who was really hot and he and I used to talk all the time and we were always partners in partner activities and so I'd think that maybe he actually is gay but that he was just too afraid to tell me and that he was actually closeted or something I don't know. So we'd be partners in like a blood pressure activity and I'd have to take his blood pressure since he was my partner and I'd think "maybe this is the time that I ask him if he's ever streamed emotion by carly rae jepsen" but I felt like that was too on the nose so I didn't do it and I'd just focus on how big his arms were and how I kinda wished he'd choke me and then I'd remember where I was and ask him how to right blood pressure even though I knew because I really just wanted to have any reason to talk to him. And then the test about muscles or something would come up and I'd pretend like I'm gonna flop the test because I wanted to talk to him some more and then I'd get a 100 on it and he'd be like "you're smart" and I'd be like wow I think he wants to marry me and then I'd help him correct the questions he got wrong and hope that maybe during that time he'd tell me something really personal or ask me to prom or something I don't know and then nothing would happen. And then we'd come back to class another time and he'd drink a bottle of water and I'd feel like I'd have to drink a bottle of water to because imitation is the sincerest form of flattery. Rinse and repeat for like 5 months and then it's the end of the semester and I realize that I'm never gonna have a class with him again because he just doesn't take the same classes I do and so I have a break down and one day I go home and I just can't take it anymore and I come out to a friend for the first time because I just couldn't do it and she tells me to listen to this song and for like a whole damn week I listen to this song and think "at least I have him in my head" and I'd try to get over him but then I'd go back the next day and there he was and sometimes he'd like stretch or something and I'd see a little bit of his stomach and I'd go right back to fawning over him because I really was desperate and a straight man's toy. And that would go on until the end of the semester and then I'd think, "oh well at least I won't have to see him anymore so maybe I'll get over him" but it turns out that he and I exited the school the same way so we'd actually just exit the school together and walk beside each other and talk and I knew I was fucked but I couldn't help it. And then whenever he wasn't at school or he didn't walk beside me at the end of the day I went home and listened to this song because I assumed he somehow figured out that I was into him and he never wanted to see me again but at least I had him in my head. And that continued to the end of the year and all that time I was really thinking he'd still come out to me as if a white boy located in the southeastern united states and who played on the football team was actually gay what was I thinking. And the year ended and once again I listened to sleepover and thought "at least I'll get over him because I won't be around him" but I legit dreamed about him sometimes and then I'd have to listen to this song or vent to my friend or something and eventually the beginning of this school year came and I was like "okay that's it we're done I'm over him" and then I was exiting my chemistry class one day and I saw him and I purposely walked so we'd be walking together in the halls and it was at that moment that I knew I still wasn't over him and I asked him going to a school dance later that week and if he had a date because I was expecting him to say some really personal shit and then he was like "well I was gonna go but my parents don't like the girl I was gonna go with" and my heart broke into a million pieces and I went home and moped and knew that I shouldn't have fallen for a straight man but I just couldn't help it and then I listened to sleepover for like a 100 times on loop. Good times.

**waluigiest** (10): reminds me of high school and falling for boring straight boys

**ExtraEater** (9.5): slow burner, bored at first but it really hit me at about the third "in my head"

**Chelzero** (9): gay

**MelodramaticLemonade** (9): I relate too much I'm crying

**ramskick** (9): I would love to have a sleepover at Hayley Kiyoko's place just to talk to her.

**skargardin** (9): Waaay better than I remembered, cute!

**ChaseLights** (8): Doesn't go off but isn't meant to, very cute, makes me wish I was just a full on lesbian because I hate men

**oliveoilgarlic** (8): I saw her open for Panic! last summer and before this song she yelled “have you ever fallen in love with your best friend???” and both me and the friend I was with screamed out the names of the straight girls we fell for in high school so this track gets an 8 from me for being part of that moment

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): A song that conveys a feeling us gay people know all too well about crushing on someone that doesn't recipriocate, the sorrow and the almost hopelessness, but Hayley takes that heartbreak into a comforting song about appreciating the feeling anyway.

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): Funny story: I still vividly remember this being a part of our sub's first jukebox (see, Poo? I'm a true fan) and from what I can tell the reaction to it was middling. I certainly enjoy the moody, laid-back vibe Hayley has to offer here, but I don't think Sleepover has the production it needs to make it a truly great cut off Expactations. More atmospheric effects would have certainly helped it greatly.

**twat\_brained** (7.1): okay a bit more chilled and soothing which I can appreciate but not entirely my style

**CarlieScion** (7): Sleepover is the softest track on Expectations. It's about that longing, soul-crushing feeling a lot of gay girls have when they start developing crushes on their straight best friends. This is pretty much the 'Girls Like Girls' MV in song form. It's not a "lolz i was friendzoned" kinda song, it's much more Delicate (isn't it, isn't it) than that. It's about taking solace in knowing this person closely, even if it hurts to not have them in a romantic way.

**melodyllic\_** (7): ehh its ok but i dont know what it wants to be? is it a bop or a slow song?? idk

**nooodisaster** (7): I'm still triggered by slumber party. This is better tho.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): Don’t let this rate distract you from the fact that Beyoncé blew a 3-1 lead in the 2016 Ultimate Album Rate

I think sonically this is basically just a competent retread of earlier concepts in the album, but I will give it credit for a very relatable depiction of anxiety through its lyrics. The mental turmoil represented by the constant repetition of the title is very much how my mind behaves sometimes, and I think the song has value for that alone.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): perfect song and really good about describing anxiety issues

**CarlieScion** (10): bop

**ramskick** (10): don't panic but I'm obsessed with this entire album.

**J\_Toe** (9): fits in well with a 2018 pop landscape in tune with mental health experiences, such as In My Blood and breathin'

**tapdancingpig** (8.7): Okay why do these bop so hard?

**kappyko** (8.5): boppy boppy boppy

**1998tweety** (8.2): Another song I'm glad was put on the deluxe; it's a nice bop but it doesn't reach the heights of the ones on the standard edition imo.

**strawberryswing1** (8.2): Coldplay's Don't Panic >>>>

**ImADudeDuh** (8): my therapist @ me

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Not sure whether the fact that 'don't panic' seems a bit independent from the rest of this song's chorus makes the song catchier or makes its hook end up sounding more abrupt, but this is a pretty solid bonus bop! It comes after two boring tracks, so that's a plus, too.

**SkyBlade79** (8): this a leg kicker

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (7.8): Ellie Goulding outsold

**ChaseLights** (7.5): A cute little jammer.

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7): Bop

**nooodisaster** (7): fuck you, I'll panic if I want to

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (7): I think this is a fan favorite but I think I like the prechorus a lot more than the bland chorus. Overall, it’s a nice track though.

**waluigiest** (7): slaps but not enough

**frogaranaman** (6): Reminds me of 1955.

**lagozzino** (6): My least favourite track on the whole. I don't know why, but the way he says "Don't Panic" over and over just rubs me the wrong way.

**melodyllic\_** (6): it bops, but so does the rest of the album. i'm actually not a fan of olly's falsetto/higher register on this track which is weird bc i really like his voice hmm

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (4): Ollys falsettos usually works but here its too much and it misses. Nice production but I cant get over that voice

The gap between the production and the songwriting here is vast. On paper, it's a pretty generic guitar ballad, but the synthy riffs surrounding the guitar core add a really solid layer of atmosphere that more than make up for the song's shortcomings. Also of note: there's some really excellent vocal production here with the vocoder fading in and out.

---
**ExtraEater** (11): sufjan stevens, empty ice cream cups, high class life. also by the time this rate is revealed it's going to be "the spring" that troye is talking about!

**MelodramaticLemonade** (11): Could I have given the 11 to obvious rate winners like My My My! and All For You? Yes but can I betray a song that is perfection and deserves an 11? NO

**rosecoloreds** (11): i once sobbed in the shower while the instrumental part was playing and i felt like i was in a gay indie movie

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This is just a very nice chill song, and probably the most beautiful of Troye's string of very good songs at the start of the album

**CarlieScion** (10): cute slow lil song

**lilguavachan** (10): if i didn't give animal my 11, i'd give it to this. it's that same dreamy and atmospheric vibe, but i like how warm animal is more than how sad the good side is (if that makes sense idk)

**ManofOranges** (10): Fairly laid-back song but I think that's where it gets its charm and quality

**MirandaCrocsgrove** (10): pretty jarring to put in the middle of two bops

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (10): This is 2018’s Liability

**waluigiest** (10): beautiful, grounded breakup anthem. And the little autotuned harmony in the last chorus is fantastic

**frogaranaman** (9): The Good Place is an American fantasy-comedy television series created by Michael Schur. The series premiered on September 19, 2016 on NBC. The series focuses on Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell), who wakes up in the afterlife and is introduced by Michael (Ted Danson) to "The Good Place", a highly selective Heaven-like utopia he designed, as a reward for her righteous life. However, she realizes that she was sent there by mistake and must hide her morally imperfect behavior while trying to become a better and more ethical person. William Jackson Harper, Jameela Jamil, and Manny Jacinto co-star as other residents of "The Good Place", together with D'Arcy Carden as Janet, an artificial being who knows all the information in the universe and can produce any item out of thin air, which she uses to help the inhabitants.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like this but it feels kind of long and also goes all over. It is nice seeing Troye do something a bit weirder though. The lyrics are nice too.

**kappyko** (8.5): surprising intimacy but still cold

**melodyllic\_** (8.5): the harp!!!! fuck yeah

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The longest song on the album, and really a song of two halves. There's the acoustic confessional, which honestly is well written and offers a viewpoint rarely seen: the breaker of hearts, acknowledging what they'd done, but still not regretting it. Then there's the crazy electronic production that explodes and disappears with nearly no warning yet honestly I love. Basically what I'm saying is Lorde did it better.

**ramskick** (8.5): This song definitely shows the good side of Troye Sivan's music

**twat\_brained** (8.4): Watching *Boy Erased* at TIFF before attending the Bloom Tour last fall was such a great decision, I got to experience this song in two very different yet incredibly powerful settings. May be somewhat slow but I still really admire it

**Chelzero** (8): this is classic "indie film protagonist looking wistfully out of car/train/bus window" soundtrack

**lagozzino** (8): That little twinkling electronic outro is heaven

**rotating3Dtext** (8): sad sad sad. That outro is both unnecesary and my favorite part

**The\_Gay\_Whovian** (8): Emotional beautiful ballad

**skargardin** (7.5): cute little ballad, absolutely love the synths

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): This is really sweet.

**axestogrind** (7): He said vocoders lives matter

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): The Good Side automatically wins praise for me for being a break up song filled with actual details about its central relationship's detoriation instead of sticking to being vague in its statements, which is a plus for me as an aromantic person who gets tired of hearing so many generic love songs occasionally. Musically, though, I do find it rather boring. Sorry, Troye, but acoustic guitars are not it.

**jamesfog** (6): meh

**ChaseLights** (5): an okay ballad

**ImADudeDuh** (5): stop thinking you're deep for including vocoder on your song

**J\_Toe** (5): tbh i don't much care for this song. Shawn gets dissed all the time for sounding too close to his sources of inspiration, and this likewise sounds too close to Sufjan Stevens.

**selegend** (4): some sufjan bs

**SkyBlade79** (4): idk what this means

A really cute sing-a-long bop, but I don't think there's much of note here. I really like how says "But good things are coming to me" because I can feel the comfy feeling radiating from him. The keyboards sound great as the backbone to the production but it definitely could've been amped up.

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): iconic

**J\_Toe** (10): I like the bouncy poppy sound here :)

**kappyko** (9.5): this entire album is just going to make up for the first two huh--- a big change from last year's rate oop

**oliveoilgarlic** (9): I LOVE the chords on this

**ramskick** (9): I really hope no bad karma comes my way for bopping to this song all the time.

**twat\_brained** (8.3): (insert reddit karma joke here)

**1998tweety** (8.2): My main in League of Legends. Middle, Support, Top, Jungle: that bitch can do it all. A gay icon too!

**ChaseLights** (8): A Michael Jackson-esque bop, just in time too...

**Chelzero** (8): quick confession, I don't think karma is real

**ManofOranges** (8): Buddhist icon

**melodyllic\_** (8): a nice chill song, took time to grow on me

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Karma is a sort of backbone track that doesn't immediately catch your attention, but starts getting more and more interesting with each new listen. I regarded it as filler the first time I listened to Palo Santo, but now the groove on the chorus sounds great to me ears. I wouldn't call it a standout track or anything, but it's pretty good!

**waluigiest** (8): “Delete your history.” - Hillary Clinton

**MelodramaticLemonade** (7.5): THE FALSETTO AT THE END YAS

**jamesfog** (7): /u/elitefourbrad xoxo

**lagozzino** (7): The worst song on the main album as far a I'm concerned, and it's still a 7.

**nooodisaster** (6.5): the most interesting thing about this song is it sounds like he says "animes are trying to catch up"

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (6): https://i.imgur.com/xEWFnTW.png

**frogaranaman** (5): Reminds me of 400 BCE.

This is the most visually evocative song on the album in my opinion. I imagine getting surrounded by a literal flood and being pulled in passionately by the dark waves. It sounds super intimate and the climax of the outro is a genuinely powerful

---
**amumumyspiritanimal** (10): should've been track #1 but its okay it's still a major bop

**ImADudeDuh** (10): omg when the tempo started picking up, my WIG started picking up too!

**ramskick** (10): whenever I listen to this song and actively love every second I definitely don't feel like it's the darkness in me.

**SkyBlade79** (10): yo this a god damn bop. amazing title track

**ExtraEater** (9): palo santo

**twat\_brained** (8.7): oh damn there's a title track? nvm i remember this, particularly olly's pronunciation of "palo santo". This album needed an uptick in quality and I'm glad I got it!

**MelodramaticLemonade** (8.5): BOP BOP BOP NTH MORE TO SAY

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): I think the 'swallow medication' line is a bit awkwardly constructed, but Palo Santo's title track is an incredibly acute description of the aftermath of a toxic relationship that I rarely find in pop music. It's already a stellar song on its own, but the subject matter makes it all the more intriguing for me, although it does make me realize the somewhat concerning fact that most of the songs on this album could fit into this exact same narrative. Did we ever get a backstory behind this album or something? Is Olly okay?

**1998tweety** (8.2): Wasn't the biggest fan of this when it came out, but like pretty much all of the singles it grew on me.

**CarlieScion** (8): good title track

**Chelzero** (8): I like the backing vocals

**nooodisaster** (8): /stacy lane matthews voice/ "who the fuck is palo santo, i just wanna know"

**skargardin** (8): I have to admit, some of the imagery in Palo Santo is a bit..pretentious and vague, most notably on the title-track but the sonics are really cool.

**kappyko** (7.5): omg im a dumb bitch i got confused with palo alto... i love the ramping up of intensity here

**melodyllic\_** (7): isn't palo santo a dick joke??

**waluigiest** (7): is this about being gay or about god

**ChaseLights** (6.5): I like it but like it's kinda not it, we didn't need a title track tbh

**axestogrind** (6): The recurring concept running through this album is so powerful like, this is not something they made this is in different AREAAAAS what the fuck!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6): you're the darkness in me palossand toe

**frogaranaman** (5): Reminds me of 1528.

**ThatParanoidPenguin** (5): Eh title track that just feels kinda awkward in delivery, sorry everyone

amumumyspiritanimal: Honestly this is the most consistent and fair rate I've participated in so far, I'm glad how the top 15 turned out, though I expected Plum to make it too, it was kinda cut early, being one of the most interesting songs from Troye. But I'm still ready for that Curious/All For You/Bloom/Sanctify/My My My top 5.

&#x200B;

P.S.: This might be the only rate where I don't really regret giving 90% of the songs a 10.
