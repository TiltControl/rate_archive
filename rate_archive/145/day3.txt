**Stryxen** (8): I was not surprised this made day 3… barely… At the very last moment it snatched this placement from The Last Man on Earth and made my Songeniality vote very easy (when I would have otherwise joined the Forever (Songenialiting) train. I think over quite a few (Valentine) cuts, this song’s placement is quite undeserving, even though I really really like. It’s just very pretty.

One thing I really love about this song is how much personality it contains, especially for a track in the opening stretch of the album. And the phone call “Hey is mum there? / It’s just me I felt like calling” is one of my favourite moments in music of 2021. A lot of discussion around this song was about how she pronounces Los Angeles, “Losangelease”, which is funny but also kinda smart, representing how out of place she feels there. I also love the delivery of “I won’t say no! / I’ll give it a go!”, as corny as a song about a UK indie band trying to make it in LA is, I do find it quite inspiring, especially at that line. But yeah, again, not bothered about this cut at this point.

---

#compliments to the chefs

**SmileAndTears** (11): The irony of this being the best Lana Del Rey song to come out in 2021 when homegirl put out not one but TWO albums that year. I know she was mad!

**sunsetb** (11): Shot for the spot at the top

**Awkward\_King** (10): this sounds so demure but also so celebratory, ellie's tone is so refined and well directed

**bespectacIed** (10): Woahh this is epic, probably the best song on the album. I assume this is their Party In The USA, small fish in the big pond story, and I love it. They sound self-aware but brimming with hope. The storytelling sold me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I live a pretty boring life and tbh I enjoy how boring it is. A little vicarious excitement does me just fine.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): damn it werewolf alice, you didn't tell me what the delicious things were!

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): again, loveee songs with stories, and the phone call effect was cool

**camerinian** (10): I know you wouldn’t really call this “dream pop” as such, but like, there isn’t a better descriptor for this. I feel like the clouds are personally whisking me away, and those clouds are coming from the pipe of some skeevy LA executive type and that definitely should concern me but isn’t the sensation just nice?

**celladonn** (10): stunning!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh FUCK yes, this is probably the 2nd place for my 11 i fucking LOVE these vibes

**daybed** (10): :hungrythots:

**frogaranaman** (10): "extravagance disguised as elegance is boring / I don't belong here" wow okay way to call me out

**gimmeyotacos** (10): the harmonies!!! the bass!!!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the title speaks for itself

**imbaby122** (10): every minute of this song is earned. perfection. and so thematically relatable. i don’t belong here, i’m socially anxious and a long way from home, i’m calling my mom, expect i’m talking about a liberal arts college in maine and not los angeles

**jman457** (10): This almost gives refined version of Born to Die era Lana

**plastichaxan** (10): the vibes are kinda strong here

**runaway3212** (10): me eating the flesh of my enemies after being vegan for two years

**skargardin** (10): AAAAAAAAAH

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): the narrative!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): really great hazy instrumentation mixed with vocal layering and a catchy hook to boot

**UselessTacooo** (10): My jaw is agape

**wailord\_fan** (10): Los Angeles? Don't know her. I only know los angelease.

**shhhneak** (9.6): When the vibes are off, I’m out. And the vibes are definitely not off.

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): I really like the wistful escapist feel of this, this really struck a chord with me

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): It's pretty delicious!

**1998tweety** (9): bops a bit

**afs** (9): this receives the Tommy Cash TM stamp of approval

**apatel27** (9): What a tune

**DefaultPophead** (9): I don't even like this song that much but it feels like I'm cheating on it if I rate it lower?!?

**homestarguy** (9): Just an absolutely dreamy chorus. Those harmonies are sent from heaven above!

**synyyy** (9): Reggae seems to improve everything except when -ton is added to it.

**vayyiqra** (9): I love this? When did that happen?

**welcome2thejam** (9): Disillusionment in and about L.A./California can be its own genre at this point

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): the way she sings los angeles is so adorable

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): party in the USA outsold when it comes to songs about going to Hollywood

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): CANNOT relate, I definitely CAN say no and would NOT just "give it a go"

**BasedButta** (8): stop it wolf alice if i vibe any harder i might disintegrate

**qazz23** (8): love the harmonies

**steamedasparagus** (8): this always reminds me of the party scene from lady bird

**violet** (7.5): lana del rey?

**akanewasright** (7): on a scale from like. Brussel sprouts to filet mignon, I give this like… idk a turkey or something

**jay?** (7): hmm it was an instant 10 then the spoken word whispering part made me ungag.. i had to retract my yass

**quinnpsych** (7): I like the vocals throughout most of this song, I feel like it drags on for me

**reput4tionera** (7): this song is so long

**seanderlust** (7): i mean...i guess i would believe you're in los angeles? why would i not believe it?

#complaints to the chef!

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): this really does sound like one of those 00s indie songs from a band that you’d never hear from after releasing this one song.

**sarcasticsobs** (6.3): did nothing for me

**kappyko** (6): i love the lyrics but i feel like this is too much of a slow burn especially after the intro already being a slow burn

**TiltControls** (6): this is more of an appetizer than a delicious thing

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I actually would 100% believe a girl like you would be in “Los Angelees”

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this is the exact type of nothingness indie rock song that i hate

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): this is just the intro but twice as long (and half as good)

**n1colas valentine stan** (4): five minutes and four seconds TOO LONG

**fadedblue09** (3.5): I have an irrational distaste of how the word "vibes" is used here

**Stryxen** (6): I am a bit scared I underrated this slightly… it is in my bottom 5 songs in the rate but I’m not sure why I’ve never connected with this song emotionally and I think I might regret this score in the future… but I get why people love it so much. This was a top 10 contender for a while, and now I’m a bit sad to see Wolf Alice down to just one song.

Anyway yeah, this song is pretty cool - especially the last minute, feels like essential Wolf Alice, and I really like the dark vibe. It’s hard to explain it any more than that. Anyway moving on, Blue Weekend and Valentine are on the same footing now lol.

#it was unfortunately too late to change their 11 to this when they asked, but i promised i would shout them out on this song

**synyyy** (9.5): Once more is me replaying the song, I guess I'm the obsessed one

#💋

**bridgemoney** (11): So many contenders but I just had to go with this one. Ellie's singing is brilliant, and the music perfectly captures the cinematic nature of the album. This might just be my favorite Wolf Alice song ever.

**My tasteless friend Emilie** (11): unexpected slay

**ACORGIORGY** (10): The last chorus feels like the stars aligning for this band and everything firing on all cylinders. I would get the hype if there were more moments like this on the album.

**apatel27** (10): Now this is how you build up a track

**bespectacIed** (10): I might have misjudged and slept on the album because why am I hearing back to back serves, second and third song in?? This is so good.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t really have much to say this song is just very yass and slay.

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): loved this one blending in from delicious things, and also was very relateable with my weak character and trying to justify my poor decision making capabilities

**endcreditouilles** (10): this is the horniest shoegaze i've ever heard

**homestarguy** (10): The In Rainbows-ification of Wolf Alice and I am HERE FOR IT.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Listening to this feels better than having an orgasm, I swear

**jay?** (10): it gave what it needed to give and more!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wow this was a grower, I always liked it but relistening to it for this rate it just HIT

**SFbby** (10): Moody, hypnotic, operatic, orchestral, and absolutely riveting

**steamedasparagus** (10): ONCE MORE ONCE MORE ONCE MORE

**thedoctordances1940** (10): fucking adore this song, the final chorus is just insane

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): one of my favorite songs of 2021, the building tension in the verses and then the big release in the chorus that is catchy as hell is immaculate

**Arybeck67** (9.7): yes gives us that rock!!!

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.7): the bridge aaaaaaaa

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): I love the way Ellie changes her voice and shows her range throughout the song. So beautiful and mourning.

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): love the guitar, sounds kinda 90s/grungy

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): ou the vocal performance... *pooh ascending gif*

**1998tweety** (9): AKA a mirror message

**afs** (9): who's gonna say this is Lana's new album title

**imbaby122** (9): love a good transition. love a good whisper asmr moment. love a good take it all away moment just to shove it all back in. love it.

**runaway3212** (9): this sounds dangerous but also slay

**TiltControls** (9): some of the notes in this are on another level

**UselessTacooo** (9): cute but not as cute as everything else

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Sounds ethereal

**waluigiest** (9): they should play this when someone goes home on Drag Race (a la Home on American Idol)

**CrimsonROSET** (8): oh the vibes are GREAT on these choruses

**daybed** (8): actually this song is very good but! i think is overrated

**fadedblue09** (8): The chorus of this is euphoric

**vayyiqra** (8): The drums are lowkey one of the best things about this even though the guitar stands out more.

**seanderlust** (7.8): her voice sounds so pretty here! i especially like the harmonies on the chorus against the arpeggiated guitar

**jman457** (7.6): This builds really nicely

**quinnpsych** (7): I like the moody tone of this one, vocal production is good, vibes are witchy

**reput4tionera** (7): i like the drums a lot

#It’s Not Personell… its DRAG! P.s Log OFF. Alyssa E

**akanewasright** (6.9): this and delicious things blending together was a mistake because I can never remember what this one sounds like aside from the title line

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): a good chorus that gets let down by some of the weaker verses on the album

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): I had the score higher but that chorus sounds so out of place

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i mean i guess it’s better than the last song

**BeauMeringue212** (4): vocals are nice, but the song is a bit department store commercial vibe

**kappyko** (4): more like dipshit on the ass

**n1colas valentine stan** (3): tf is that bro

**Stryxen** (9): This is one of my favourite Lucy songs… and I’m starting to realise I forgot to double check my scores because I meant to give this a 10. The constant energy, ridiculously good percussion work with that hazy distorted overprocessed sound make this sound exactly like an important but distant memory, that gets you hot in the face from how strong the emotions were then. And the lyrics of this are so vivid, and HORNY. 

Some of my favourite lyrics from this: "Catch my breath to breathe your name / I am just the fool you took me for", "You gave me your hands / 'Cause you didn't know what to do with them / And I showed you the way / Even though I'd never been" , “Has my faced changed, baby, how will I know? / I'll stay ready for you to take me, take me, take me, take me". Lucy Dacus one day you will be recognised for your genius, masterful lyricism.

This was top 10 for a surprising amount of the rate, despite having NO 11s (this is the highest song to receive no 11s I believe, and for a long time it was the least controversial song in the entire rate! We all seem to really like this song! I was rooting for this a lot, perfectly contributing to the album’s concept but shining in itself as a standout - could have done great as a single in my opinion.

#BONK

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is slaying, the chimes in like the prechorus are so fucking pretty

**bespectacIed** (10): whew I couldn't describe my first time as profoundly and metaphorically as this. All I remember is that it was awkward, fun, and I came :shrug:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): But you can feel it for the second time a first time! Look on the bright side!

**frogaranaman** (10): Lucy stop writing relatable music challenge (she fails every time)

**jay?** (10): GAG GAG

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): horny ass bop for virgins

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): in love with this song

**RandomHypnotica** (10): why yes lucy, this IS your first time in a rate huh? Welcome to Hell

**steamedasparagus** (10): this got me through some shit last year lol

**therokinrolla** (10): "I'm just the fool you took me for" I no joke think about this lyric at least once a week why did it hit me in the way that it did do that

**throwaway-7650** (10): this deserves 10s/11s as much as hot & heavy and brando tbh

**wailord\_fan** (10): "I may let you see me on my knees / but you'll never see me on all fours" is one of my favorite lyrics of 2021, and I think it's partially because of her delivery.

**waluigiest** (10): when I say I’m horny this is what I mean

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): Her lyrics make me feel like I've loved a thousand lives and loved a thousand loves.

**plastichaxan** (9.5): very underrated in the album wow

**violet** (9.5): OMG???????

**jman457** (9.2): catchy little garage rock tune

**afs** (9): what do you mean Ms Dacus, Carly taught us it always feels just like the first time, the first time

**breadcrumbs6969** (9): an interesting topic for a song, also LOVE the instrumental before the chorus

**endcreditouilles** (9): I've never been so sad and so horny at the same time

**GapeCod** (9): healthy minds make sexy bodies, let us touch so much of ourselves together

**homestarguy** (9): Sleek, linear, “Historian”-ish rocker—though more uptempo than a lot of cuts on that album. This one slapped hard live.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): "I'm a starfish", she had me in the first half, but then she dropped this line

**qazz23** (9): Love the drumming, probably my favorite off the album

**quinnpsych** (9): Drums, absolutely driving this song. This is one where I don't know much about the song coz I always get lost in the instrumentation

**shhhneak** (9): me, am empath, sensing she’s horny.

**synyyy** (9): Thank you for painting the wrong image in my head with that first verse...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): its called first time because this is the first time in this rate i’ve genuinely enjoyed a song so far

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): As much as I love this, I must concede that “I’m a starfish on the kitchen floor” is one of the most unsexiest phrases ever. Like the rest of the first verse is super steamy but… starfish?? 🤔

**welcome2thejam** (9): The Genius annotation to "But you'll never see me on all fours" literally just says "reference to sex"

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Sometimes I do find this song a bit bitter tbh, but it is very well written

**bo\_g\_o** (8): yeah that's why they call it a "first time" lucy, because it happens first

**CrimsonROSET** (8): for the first time in forever

**just\_thonking** (8): Best song on Emotion Side B

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): love the heavier guitars and drums on this one

**UselessTacooo** (8): The slay bop in question

**fadedblue09** (7.5): The drum work is excellent

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): this feels a little bit like the sum total of all the songs on this album mixed together to me, but luckily this album is really good so even a more generic mix of the ideas here is still good

**Arybeck67** (7): something about this song has never clicked for me, though the production is quite interesting

**BasedButta** (7): good i guess, just not my tempo…

**imbaby122** (7): going into this i thought lucy dacus was virgin music but i stand corrected

**reput4tionera** (7): i am bouncing around right now it’s a good song to bounce to

**TiltControls** (7): 'how will i know'? lucy really trying to appeal to raters to get that 10+ average

**vayyiqra** (7): I like the drumming on this a lot. It has some energy! (I play drums.)

#jail for virgins

**bulforster** (6.8): I know it's intentional but some of the lyrics here are just kinda awkward

**gimmeyotacos** (6): i’m sorry i just do not care for this song but lucy’s lyrics are the reason i even rated it as high as i did

**runaway3212** (5): this song kinda sucks lol but I love her voice so idm

**thisusernameisntlong** (3.5): this sounds unnecessarily loud to me

**Stryxen** (10): This song is when I knew this album would be something special. It was a lovely morning. I had spent the entire night before listening to Blue Weekend, emotionally raw and vulnerable from real life stuff and the music I had just listened to. I cried because of this fucking song on my first listen. I was soft as a dune! I listened to this and stared out the window a lot that summer. Perfect theme song to listen to in longing. To listen while you wait, just to wait.

This song spent most of the rate period here, occasionally hopping up into top 10, but after receiving its 0 it was just edged out by the real #10. This was my r/indieheads ultimate rate 11, so I’m glad this did well (just beating its performance on indieheads too, at #12, although the average is nearly 0.5 points higher)

---

#soft as a dune!

**afs** (11): I am NOT going to be basic and 11 Paprika or Be Sweet. Kokomo 11N has a better ring to it anyway.

**quinnpsych** (11): This song is unreal. It literally drips in nostalgia, the guitar post-chorus is just so reminiscent of that longing and wanting she's talking about. I've always thought of that guitar as a secondary vocalist, it hits me every time. I feel like the little 'blips' that come in before the chorus start some kind of flashback sequence that lead you into your childhood. I don't know it's just incredible. The strings in the chorus, the vocals. The more whimsical elements of childhood joy mixed with the nostalgic overload that comes with growing into adulthood. Literal masterpiece. 'and maybe i'm not that worthy'

**2dina3dworld** (10): Indieheads would call this “Wilco-lite”. I would call it “Wilco but better”.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): the instrumentals are perfectly nostalgic sounding for the song, the violins are beautiful too

**bespectacIed** (10): Goddamn what a stunningly-written sad, nostalgic song. I know it's is about longing and regret but jbrekkie still managed to put rose-colored filters on it... like, it still fits the 'jubilee' theme cuz you know what... pining for lost love while accepting things for how they turned out to be IS a small step towards eventual happiness. Genius me thinks. Im reading into this too closely idc, this song is so beautifully bittersweet

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): the longing in this one makes me think of some mitski songs, to me melancholy and yearning/longing are sadder than anything so i can't listen to this one without crying lmao i'm pathetic

**GapeCod** (10): kappyko, OUT

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this used to be my favorite song on the album, but this rate made me appreciate some of the other tracks more and now this is my third favorite?

**imbaby122** (10): longing for the longing of young love. where was my whirlwind high school romance :(

**jay?** (10): jaw dropped why lie

**plastichaxan** (10): baby i’m not that worthy

**seanderlust** (10): "watching you show off to the world the parts I fell so hard for" -- GOD EVERY TIME THAT LINE

**SFbby** (10): I think I converted a few coworkers into Jbrekkie fans with this song - it's dripping in nostalgic tones

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): "Evansville, South Bend/ Oh lets go my friend" just doesn't have the same ring to it

**throwaway-7650** (10): not to doxx myself but I used to live ~36 miles to t- [redacted]

**UselessTacooo** (10): Songs based around grand strings always captivate me, and this is no exception.

**welcome2thejam** (10): There's just something about songs about staying in some ordinary town while someone you love leaves, and you're just stuck there kicking around, hoping they're living their best lives. And even though it's probably too late to go back to the way things were, a little piece of your heart fantasizes they'll show up at your door one day and bring that bit of happiness back to your life (see Fountain of Wayne's Hackensack). They get to me in a way that is DEFINITELY not projecting

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I love the old school vibe, the guitars bring this a nostalgic touch

**NewAccountNow** (9.5): Michelle just dont fucking miss

**sarcasticsobs** (9.4): “watching you show off to the world, the parts i fell so hard for” and “i know they deserve you too, and maybe i'm not that worthy”. all i know is pain.

**1998tweety** (9): i can't wait to get into an intense relationship and break up so I can relate to songs like these

**gimmeyotacos** (9): lyrically, this is the best song of the album. if someone wrote a song like this about me i would simply pass out

**homestarguy** (9): This one is so nice. Has a real Belle & Sebastian vibe to it, which I appreciate as a B&S stan.

**My friend Ais** (9): she forgot to score this one at first so I got to tell her how much I loved it before she scored it 😈

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): beautiful song tinged with nostalgia

**violet** (9): so pretty yass

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): i was a teenage simp too bestie

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): i love the instrumentation on this album so much, it really paints a picture. light woods. flowy curtains. faint light of dawn. i am describing a cheap pinterest board but i meant this as a compliment

**celladonn** (8.5): the lyrics and instrumental... really lovely

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I had an internet friend who lived in Kokomo, Indiana. They moved away as soon as they physically could

**wailord\_fan** (8.5): It's such a vibe.

**Arybeck67** (8): pain

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This songs deserves all the credit in the world for giving me something positive to associate with Indiana.

**bo\_g\_o** (8): aruba jamaica ooh i wanna take ya to bermuda bahamas this joke is unfunny

**DefaultPophead** (8): This song is really nice to but it just doesn't stand out compared to the rest of the album.

**frogaranaman** (8): *very stan twt reply voice* where

**reput4tionera** (8): this song is so pleasant

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Cafe music… that’s a compliment btw

**thedoctordances1940** (7.9): it's really funny because it references indiana which is like indy (yes indy definitely refers to the state and not the city of indianapolis) but also it's indie music, it's so smart

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): it's kinda Animal Crossing New Leaf core

**BasedButta** (7): walking simulator pleasant, or: how to country right

**runaway3212** (7): This song isn't necessarily short but I do find it a bit underdeveloped, however strings always slay so when there's strings on a song it slays

**steamedasparagus** (7): I skip it!! Sorry!

#hard as nails!!

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): a bit too cottage core for me, but cute

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): IN one ear, OUT the other

**CrimsonROSET** (4): I love a slow number early in because it’s the clear ‘ok get a drink’ part

**n1colas valentine stan** (2): did you guys know the fruits on the album cover are actually persimmons and not oranges

#come on pretty mama

**babadork** (11): Fuck Mike Love, but I do love The Beach Boys

**jman457** (9.4): The Beach Boys have been really quiet since this dropped

**akanewasright** (9): ~~Aruba, Jamaica, ooh I wanna take ya~~

**synyyy** (9): Aruba, Jamaica, ooh, I wanna take ya to Bermuda, Bahama, come on pretty mama-wait, wrong Kokomo

**qazz23** (8): better than the beach boys (original comment lololol)

**vayyiqra** (8): This song always makes me think "eh" until I remember how pretty the strings are and the solo and I should check out the Beach Boys someday and

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): the beach boys kinda outsold

#it’s what we deserve

**endcreditouilles** (10): if i see any 0s for this song i will be deleting the sub

**Uberpigeon** (11): My poor little meow meow. This song blows me away every time I hear it, it’s such a hard hitting emotional outpour I love it so much. Cancel the rate, the real winner just got robbed!!!  

**Stryxen** (7): When this song was released as a single, I adored it. I was all in on Blue Weekend by Wolf Alice and pre-ordered the CD and a t-shirt. I listened to How Can I Make It OK? on loop until the album came out later, and then in the album I found myself not really wanting to return to it, it started to feel a lot emptier next to the more uniquely Wolf Alice tracks full of personality throughout the album, whereas How Can I Make It OK? started to feel slightly limp. It really grew off me for a while and I considered giving this a negative score - thankfully I don’t dislike it anymore, I actually like it again, but I understand where the love comes from for this song. 5 minutes of mutual love in a friendship that never seems to be easy, very much a centrepiece in the album thematically, I’m just not the biggest fan musically.  

How Can I Make It Ok? had a JOURNEY this rate. Initially placing at around #8 or so, and then a 0 launched it down into the 20s, only after 8 11s and 38 10s did it manage to recover to a respectable place in the top 10. This is where we say goodbye to Wolf Alice, who somehow blew their lead against Snail Mail’s one song left in.  

---

#i just want you to be happy

**ignitethephoenix** (11): This is my 11 because it’s an excellent song but also need this energy absorbed into my soul.

**jman457** (11): The Main character energy this gives off. It builds so beautiful, despite the simple message. One of the best discoveries from a rate recently.

**just\_thonking** (11): This was my SOTY writeup so I'm obligated to 11 it. The chorus is just so cathartic!

**oscarbrierley1** (11): the best vocal performance of the rate. Changes up to keep it interesting. A bop.

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): i cry

**akanewasright** (10): I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPPY

**Arybeck67** (10): the production is top notch, the lyrics are top notch, the song is top notch

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is kind of the best song ive ever heard or will ever hear. this song makes me feel absolutely at ease, i feel like everything will be okay

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): That last chorus I’m ASCENDING.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): i'm yassing

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): the chorus is wonderful with the backing vocals and lyrics are really nice

**daybed** (10): this was an 11 contender it's just so full of love and how the song just keeps growing and growing, stunning.

**endcreditouilles** (10): A perfect embodiment of the pain of stepping on your cats paw and trying to apologize but she doesn't understand you

**frogaranaman** (10): people pleaser anthem

**homestarguy** (10): It’s like if ABBA decided to come back and record another anthem in 2021. Wait—I’m hearing a voice in my earpiece, you say what now???

**hunnybee12** (10): the first notes make me tear up sometimes bc i know the emotional turmoil thats incoming

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it just gets better as it goes

**jay?** (10): wow another 11

**Mudkip1** (10): this would be my 11 if it weren’t for miss zauner. Everything about this is fucking beautiful. The buildup, the vocals, the lyrics

**qazz23** (10): really strong vocals, love the buildup to the final chorus

**quinnpsych** (10): This shit is my jam, I love the way it builds, especially with the background vocals in the chorus. Great great great

**skargardin** (10): I JUST WANT YOU TO BE HAAAAAPPYYYY

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): magical

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): there's a lot to love on this track- the dreamy synths, the chunky baseline, the vocal production, the build.. I could go on

**vayyiqra** (10): I love the chorus to this and one comment said this is Haim-like. I would agree the chorus is like when Haim are at their best (that is, LARPing as Fleetwood Mac or another 70s soft-rock act).

**waluigiest** (10): give it to me Stevie Nicks

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): this song is more than OK

**afs** (9): idk about that but the music is doing good

**imbaby122** (9): this song is constantly scratching itches in my brain. when the guitar comes in! the vocals! the little instrumentation breaks!

**steamedasparagus** (9): yes

**synyyy** (9): Ellie can go from Sarah Bonito to Avril Lavigne to Marina and I'm here for it!

**UselessTacooo** (8.8): Nooooooo I wanted to like this so bad but it’s just a lethargic slob of music actually as I type this in realizing it’s incredible move on with your day

**TiltControls** (8.5): why make it ok when you can make it amazing like this song

**ReallyCreative** (8.2): a little sleepy but still good

**kappyko** (8): this is them asking me how they can make the album actually good and that's why this song and the next two are finally above decent

**runaway3212** (8): Iconic but also boring

**throwaway-7650** (8): the vocals are both poohascend.gif and <a:audience:851956371884998706>

**welcome2thejam** (8): Whenever I make a particularly bad take:

**thedoctordances1940** (7.6): good song but a little overrated

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): now why is this the blue weekend track everyone claims is the best............ i'm sorry i don't hear it

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): I had to force myself to like this song because it's the fan-favourite from the album, but now I can tolerate it. The more I listen, the more I understand its merits, but it's not a very fast grower for me I'm afraid.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): this is the song that a middle-aged white man would put on when he's trying to learn to cook for the first time after he divorced his wife, because she always cooked the meals, and he realises he quite likes it.

**camerinian** (7): this doesn't really kick off until the 3 minute mark but DAMN what a kick off

**CrimsonROSET** (7): there’s no way they’re not saying ‘i just want you to behave’

**reput4tionera** (7): this is nice

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s cute I guess

#yeah it’s okay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i mean it already is an ok song. you dont have to try much harder

**2dina3dworld** (6): idk how they mixed both the heartland rock revival and the 80s synth revival into one song but they did it… and it’s kinda average.

**fadedblue09** (6): Sounds like a Florence song

**bespectacIed** (5): A bit bland, and the lyrics super mundane and uninteresting

**BeauMeringue212** (2): It just feels like a limp Christine and the Queens cover

**n1colas valentine stan** (0): this feels like its drilling into my skull

**Stryxen** (10): The massive orchestral theatrics and powerful vocal performance in ‘Tactics’ suddenly reduce to a whisper in the opening lines of ‘Posing For Cars’, where she can barely force the words out. Confessing her anxiety to a lover, she is small, while her other feels untouchable. This sentiment is expressed in Kokomo, IN - but this time it’s real, it’s final, it’s urgent. Her vocals are desperate, her lyrics are tender as her anxiety becomes an impossibly massive, unbeatable battle. “And how could you ever conceive / this adolescent heart, skipping beats?” - the lyrics are careful and controlled, to hold back the overwhelming flood of begging, as she weakly demands to be seen and heard - to no response. When all the fears inside have dried out and she has become “a hollow root pushing through” into her lover’s “full and firm” world, she becomes “the empty space inside the room”. Her breakdown ends sourly - quite literally, the lyrics ending on the word “fermenting”- and with nothing else to say, a standing ovation-worthy guitar solo takes over: melancholic, but freeing.

I more than adore this song, I was going to 11 this when I found out the rate got picked, but another song stole my heart in the meantime. I’m glad this received a lot of love in this rate, it’s truly special, and nothing less than a masterpiece. This was actually #2 for a good while (and you definitely do not know what the #1 song was), but slowly, place by place worked its way down here over the 120 ballots after mine.

#correct people

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I gave this, I Know The End, and Happier Than Ever all 11s, so obviously I have a type. But really, out of those 3, I think I like what this one does with it's outro the best. You really sink into that guitar solo, and I think it captures the warm emotions of the song better than any words could describe.

**akanewasright** (10): [is this jbrekkie?](https://images-ext-2.discordapp.net/external/C5Ck9OOlTzJFlqpQQ4NHcJNU1Ohree32JLtGE5_qYKQ/https/giant.gfycat.com/PlayfulSlipperyGrayfox.mp4)

**bespectacIed** (10): the album both starting and ending with a two massive, joyous songs. This is just too beautiful and emotional of a love song. It reminds me of something that would fit well on Angel Olsen - All Mirrors lyrically. And that guitar solo whew, immaculate. Perfect cap to the album.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): instruments? Where were they the rest of the album?

**daybed** (10): stunning closer the outro is just the gates of heaven opening.

**endcreditouilles** (10): kachow

**gimmeyotacos** (10): i’m in search of a boyfriend to drive off into the sunset with while we listen to this song

**jay?** (10): gaggggedddddd why lie

**Mudkip1** (10): this is maybe the best song ever made

**My friend Ais** (10): (Alex note: she was so right about this)

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): a better closer than i know the end thats for sure

**plastichaxan** (10): me the time i got high and tried to stop traffick but there were only like 2 cars and my friends pulled me back ouu

**quinnpsych** (10): Bruh, this guitar solo is one of the best things I've ever heard. It makes me feel like I'm in love with the actual love of my life. Euphoric.

**reput4tionera** (10): such a good closer hhhhhh

**throwaway-7650** (10): sad that I couldn't 11 this... if only I did indieheads ult 😭

**UselessTacooo** (10): This is the perfect way to close out the album. I don’t think I could have asked for anything else. I love how everything explodes in the second half just before closing out the album in deafening silence.

**vayyiqra** (10): I firmly believe that long, guitar-driven closing tracks are often the best kind of closing track and this is no exception. Best line: "it's been one o'clock for hours". What an oddly specific yet evocative way of summing up the mood here, which is languishing on the couch late at night listening to music. Many nights have been spent doing just that to this album.

**wailord\_fan** (10): What's a better duo than Dead Oceans backed albums and 5 minute + anthems as album closers?

**xxipil0ts** (10): - i can't believe she made such a good closing track. i thought i was gonna through this album without crying but here we are.

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): Paprika and Posing for Cars were the two standouts from my first listen of this album. Still, they hold up. Two perfect pieces of bread holding this amazing album sandwich together.

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): this guitar solo literally cleanses my soul every time i hear it. it's so good. how is it this good

**indiefan** (9.7): That guitar solo at the end brought the score up for me

**thedoctordances1940** (9.6): takes a bit to get going but when it does oh my fucking god

**shhhneak** (9.5): God tier instrumentation

**afs** (9): you'll get run over pls

**bo\_g\_o** (9): the guitar solo is everything

**camerinian** (9): god damn what a closer. I could honestly to 15 minutes of that outro

**steamedasparagus** (9): Just a single slow desire fermenting!!

**synyyy** (9): Car references, the desire of love, and a powerful guitar solo. Michelle is one step closer to asking me if I have anything against dogs.

**TiltControls** (9): cars in bondage

**welcome2thejam** (9): Reading that the song structure is partly Wilco based unlocked something for me

**imbaby122** (8.5): even though it takes a while to build up for my preference, it feels like an ending. it evolves into a conclusion.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): at least half of these points are solely for the guitar solo at the end

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): love the way this one builds

**violet** (8.5): WOKE FROM A DREAM IN WHICH YOU LEFT ME POSING FOR CARS ON THE AMERICAN STOOOP

**jman457** (8.3): A nice conclusion to this album even though I feel like it overstays its welcome

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): now what exactly is jbrekkie doing posing for Clairo???

**1998tweety** (8): not half this song being instrumental..its nice though

**BeauMeringue212** (8): the guitar solo was a perfect way to close the album

**fadedblue09** (8): Kind of a slow burn, but the guitar outro is majestic

**frogaranaman** (8): MOTOMAMI????

**homestarguy** (8): A very cathartic ending! Coulda climaxed a bit sooner, but still a nice finisher.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I always say how much I love long songs (yeah, I consider any song above the 6 minutes mark long), but they need to try different things as it goes on, there's no need to make a 7 minutes song if you gonna repeat the same sounds over and over again. This is not completely true for this track

**skargardin** (8): I absolutely love the outro here

**BasedButta** (7.5): aaaah, the indie staple. huge songs that take like two or more minutes to get good

**just\_thonking** (7.5): I prefer posing for Planes: Fire & Rescue

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): takes like 4 minutes to get there but then it’s great

**breadcrumbs6969** (7): expected more and imo it doesn't justify its running time

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I think this is not the best way to end the album, it drags and is also the one of the most down tempo songs here. The guitar solo and build up at the end is cool but overall it doesn’t work for me as nicely as it could.

#wrong people!!

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): Yo La Tengo could never

**Arybeck67** (6): tbh, I think this is a pretty bad closer to a solid album. I probably would like it better if it was placed somewhere else on the tracklist.

**qazz23** (6): The solo carries this one entirely

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Ehh I feel like something’s missing to make this a better closer

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): takes too long to get going. Doesn't work as well as the other long song in the rate for me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Unlike Triple Dog Dare we definitely didn’t need all seven minutes of this.

**runaway3212** (3): ending an underwhelming album with an underwhelming song she's so real

**Stryxen** (6.5): This song is great, and a more than welcome inclusion on Jubilee, I wouldn’t ever even dream of skipping it. I just can’t help but find it a bit underwhelming - it’s sonically quite a generic track on the album without enough lyrics to distinguish it. For Jubilee, literally in my top 5 albums of all time, that is high praise, but in this rate it is my personal villain. I want the other songs with 

This did about how you’d expect throughout - roughly #7-#11 the whole time, but an influx of 11s during extensions suddenly shot it up to near the top of the bracket.

**bulforster** (9.8): stream bumper - pop songs 2020

#want to be good

**fadedblue09** (11): The album standout for me. Hearing layered and well-detailed instrumentals in a song is a sure way to get my attention.

**hikkaru** (11): SLAY TACKLE

**ReallyCreative** (11): Literally one of the best songs of 2021 to me, absolute perfect from the drop of the best to the insane swell of the brass in the bridge. The faintness and the clarity of Michelle's vocals are just deliciously haunting and warm. The GORGEOUS saxophone. She left the mother lake dry when she made this

**BasedButta** (10): hypnotizing, incredibly pretty i feel like i'm in a kandinsky painting this is gorgeous

**bespectacIed** (10): Another witty metaphor, I love this song so much. Love how it acknowledges that happiness needs to be brute forced into submission sometimes whew. And that final instrumental that feels like us succeeding?? against all odds?? Jbrekkie's mind it amazes me

**camerinian** (10): there were like three distinct points in listening to this where I was like “oh crap this is a great song” and then it would immediately go and somehow top itself.

**gimmeyotacos** (10): has your fave made an introspective song about overthinking dark thoughts that also makes you wanna dance and has a banger sax solo? didn’t think so.

**hunnybee12** (10): once on a hinge date i put this on aux while i was driving and the guy was like "wow,, this is a really cool song" and looked at me like he was surprised.. then proceeded to tell me about his band inspired by pink floyd. tldr he was a terrible kisser and i never saw him again

**Mudkip1** (10): this is maybe the best song ever made

**plastichaxan** (10): don’t mind me while i’m tackling the emotions that this album brings out in me

**quinnpsych** (10): I LOOOOOVE slide tackle. Guitar pick slaps, drum line slaps, synths that pulse in the chorus are unreal. No bad words. The vocals in the first line of the chorus ascend me

**steamedasparagus** (10): Undeniable

**synyyy** (10): My brother is failing to understand why I love this, and to be honest I haven't gotten a clue either

**throwaway-7650** (10): the way this overtook posing for cars for my 11 after ih ult ou

**vayyiqra** (10): A banger! There was a kind of awkward moment the other day where MK said this song is upbeat or something like that, and I said the lyrics are very dark, and those are both true statements. MK if you are reading this I'm sorry if I came across as a pedant there. However the key to this song is that it's both; it sounds joyous and fun and you can jam out to it, and yet at the same time it's got lyrics like "obsessing in the dark" that hit when you're up late pondering where life is headed. I should go back to therapy shouldn't I oh no

**you2009** (10): I found out literally 5 minutes ago what a slide tackle even is and I guess this is the only win sports will ever be receiving in my life

**akanewasright** (9.5): me when I’m playing football idk I haven’t played a sport since gym class sophomore year

**imbaby122** (9.5): this song is hitting different rn bc i’m tackling this void so hard you wouldn’t even believe. this void is stubborn and relentless. the sax solo rests my weary head tho <3

**2dina3dworld** (9): me playing rugby

**afs** (9): syn is going to KILL me

**DefaultPophead** (9): The score goes higher every time I listen to it. It's just a massive grower and I finally got there.

**frogaranaman** (9): isn't this like a red card penalty

**jay?** (9): served why lie

**seanderlust** (9): okay ima slide tackle this depression....damn this void got hands!!!

**xxipil0ts** (9): - I love this breezy bedroom pop song she made

**UselessTacooo** (8.8): How was this not a single?? It would have been a perfect follow-up to Be Sweet in my opinion.

**1998tweety** (8.5): the violin serve, the outro ate too

**homestarguy** (8.5): This “Slide Tackle” will not get a yellow or red card from me. I don’t love this one as much as I used to, but it was one of my go-to late-night highway drive songs last year.

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): they should use this in the next FIFA game

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is some really good sitting in the backseat on a long drive while the sun is setting vibes.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): some songs i wish packed more of a punch, but like this is still cute and boppy

**celladonn** (7): not one of the most memorable songs but i do love that sax

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): mid but the good kind of mid

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Vibey (I hope I’m using that word right)

#obsessing in the dark

**NewAccountNow** (6.5): ok she might miss

**CrimsonROSET** (6): be good to me baby just doesn’t have the same ring to it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i dont watch sports what’s a slide tackle

**apatel27** (5): Background > Lyrics

**jman457** (5): This is a bit boring, especially compared to the first 3 songs

**breadcrumbs6969** (4): very unremarkable, sorry

**runaway3212** (4): this is the point in the album where it starts boring me to death

#not sure, let’s ask the audience

**reput4tionera** (9): i don’t know what kind of instrument did that solo (it has saxophone vibes but im not sure) but it served

#🎷

**bo\_g\_o** (10): [happy saxophone noises]

**bridgemoney** (10): That sax is euphoric.

**waluigiest** (10): [sax solo]

**welcome2thejam** (10): Everyone talks about the horns in Paprika for good reason, but they're next level here. And that groove! Ear candy the whole way through

**oscarbrierley1** (9.5): saxophone solo slay, so fun.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.2): gotta love the sax and the guitars on this

**qazz23** (9): Yay, sax solo 🎷

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): really groovy track, love the horns

**ignitethephoenix** (8): nothing like a good saxophone

**violet** (8): slayful sax

**IIIHenryIII** (7): not the unsexy saxophone

**Arybeck67** (6): eh, but the sax is awesome

#the 1975

**cremeebrulee** (10): love any song that can join my “this is a 1975 song” playlist

**RandomHypnotica** (10): we could probably make a rate out of all the songs that concievably could be a song made by The 1975 because they they sound vaguely synthpoppy and have a saxophone

**Stryxen** (10): This song is also very special, but mostly because it’s just a lot of good fun. The best part of this track has to be the bridge, the confidence in her delivery and lyrical assassination of this man nobody likes is pure catharsis. "You say, "Here's lookin' at you, kid" / Thinking I wouldn't understand the reference / You admit you think we're fated / I'll be lucky if I'm your third wife” - flawless. And then the stunning chorus - “All I need for you to admit / is that you never knew me like you thought you did” provides maybe the perfect statement piece for this album, letting her reclaim her own sense of worth and indepence from the people and place that thought they could teach her how to live. And it’s all focused into resent for this one annoying man who thinks he knows everything, very relatable!

While I thought this song maybe had upset winner material, and definitely assumed it had top 2 on the album potential, it was never beating either Hot & Heavy or Triple Dog Dare, and only a couple times got to taste the top 5. It gets real competitive now, I think I only have 10s and an 11 left after all.

---

#you guys are literally so right

**camerinian** (11): This song. This fucking song. This song has brought me to tears numerous times, more than any of the other outwardly "sad" tracks on the album, and it is entirely thanks to that hook. That simple, direct, brutally effective hook. Realizing that someone has picked up an entirely misguided impression of who you are and having to recognize that your relationship is on futile ground as a result is an utterly devastating feeling that I don’t think any other musician has touched upon, certainly not with this much precise power. That would be enough, but the fact that it's also a slap down of every pretentious artsy boy who only visualizes their relationships through the lens of media consumption (the kind of which I definitely was at a point) gives the ache at the core of the song so much more potency. I liked this album on first listen, but I had no choice but to stan after I heard this. One for the ages

**celladonn** (11): soooo many great little lyrical moments here, one of my favourite songs of last year

**therokinrolla** (11): It's rare that a production-lyric combo so strategically and effectively seizes you into its space and its time. Brando, through all the introspection and analysis into companionship for it's own sake, is a goofy song. It's filled with witty one-liners ("they play oldies in the afternoon for the elderly, and me and you") and hilarious take-downs ("you think you're Brando but you'll never come close") about a girlbossing, gatekeeping, gaslighting know-it-all that Lucy seems to have only tied herself to for the sake of having a friend. A tale of a self-absorbed king being neutered, portrayed as a back and forth between the two. And for all of it, the production matches perfectly. The backing acoustic guitar was snatched from some Bard of the Year winner. It's the perfect beat to dance back and forth to, and the clumsily thudding percussion is perfect to dance to, laugh to, and cry to. This "antagonist" is so pathetic he hopes she won't get the references to fucking Casablanca just so he can feel superior. Our wannabe Brando is just a tool, and she lets us know that. So tell me why Brando gives me the same warmth of nostalgia I get when I remember any of my grandest and happiest memories. The bounce and rhythm to the actual music backing the track feels so precise to the narrative as previously mentioned, but it manages to be wistfully lightweight enough just to gently land you on the surface Lucy's world. There's a penetrating somberness that follows you like a dog lost in a park, exaggerated to the same degree as the comedy. It's clever, but it's piercing when she admits that he knows so much more about oldies films than he ever will about her. And yet she's stayed. This song rocks, where rocks has like at least 3 different meanings. It's high school prom vibes, even better than Olivia Rodrigo has achieved. I can smell the musk of bare wood walls, taste the grocery store deli pinwheels, and feel the back and forth of the creaky old floor of whatever rundown hotel my high school rented out for a prom. This is one of the best songs of all time.

**wailord\_fan** (11): oh boy howdy what an 11 contender. Throws punches, timely for a Lucy Dacus song (under 3 minutes!!) Quite possibly her best hook she's ever written.

#dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against men

**1998tweety** (10): hot king

**2dina3dworld** (10): I hope my not so Brando is doing alright, somewhere.

**akanewasright** (10): this one kinda snuck up on me

**bespectacIed** (10): My most listened song in this entire rate, I don't wanna be doxxed but my last.fm has proof. I was obsessedddt when this was released and played it nonstop because I was living for the drags loool. Get him, jade!!! We've all known a pretentious brando in our lives; heck, we ARE that person sometimes, and hearing Lucy lamenting about him in detail is a mixture of hilarity and secondhand embarrassment. A welcome comedic break from the sadness and heaviness of the album. Anyways, no one's scalp was left intact after hearing the "you called me cerebral" line

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is triggering my suppressed misandry.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): this song has taught me a valuable lesson: never date film nerds. lol but for real though this song is everything

**bridgemoney** (10): To be fair, I'd say Lucy is probably the most "cerebral" member of boygenius.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): why she's mad she was called cerebral instead of pretty? I think the first one is a better compliment, isn't it?

**quinnpsych** (9): Fuck yeah, once again the drums in this album are top tier, driving the energy of this song. I love the lyrics as well, such a fuck you but also I loved you type energy. Like you weren't right for me, but I wish you were. That's what I get from this song.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.2): cute

**apatel27** (7): Reminds me of a guy that thinks quoting IASIP and 80s B Horror Movies is a personality

**breadcrumbs6969** (7): really really hate people like her friend lmfao, also the left from right from wrong line was really good

**gimmeyotacos** (7): i hated this song so much when it first came out but it’s grown on me a bit… i can’t even explain why i don’t love it ugh

**UselessTacooo** (7): Bussy bop!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): So uh… I never really cared for this song. It sounds nice enough. But I guess nothing really pops out to me like other tracks on this album
#i thought this would be the highest lucy song, this is all YOUR faults!!

**DefaultPophead** (6.5): This would've been a good Snail Mail song. I feel like it needs more energy or grit, but it's still nice.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): such a classic Lucy song in terms of storytelling and the indie rock sound, but prob my least favorite on the album

**runaway3212** (6): this is kinda nice but compared to the other slays on the album im a bit bored

**vayyiqra** (6): god. I had a classic film phase when I was a teenager like she's talking about in the lyrics and am so glad I didn't (I think anyway) become as bad as the pretentious guy in this song. Narrow miss though.

# Blue Weekend

---

**Overall Average**: 7.888 **// Average Controversy:** 1.738

---

**Stryxen** (7.636): A lot of feelings about this album, but mostly, we really fucked up this ranking. This is my favourite Wolf Alice album, and has one of their best songs, an undeniable 10, The Last Man on Earth, and we called it a day 2 cut… and don’t even get me started on Play The Greatest Hits.

The first dozen ballots this album was kinda stomping, and it got a pretty high average, and a pretty high controversy, but I guess it lacked a real standout to give it the momentum to make it any further, even into the single digits. However, it received a lot of love, and it more than deserves its place here - it was the most obvious matchup for Jubilee in my opinion, with its dreamy shoegaze flairs sprinkled throughout and general level of acclaim, but I’m very glad there are two other albums in this rate too. God these results would be disastrous without Lucy here.

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.091): this was almost my favorite album from last year, Wolf Alice slayed!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.000): I love the vibe this album gives off. It's perfectly titled. The instrumentation in almost all of the tracks is so infectious. I honestly have nothing else to say except that I truly love it.

**just\_thonking** (8.955): Was not expecting my score to be this high tbh... maybe I need to reevaluate my 2021 rankings

**indiefan** (8.891): This was one of my A(s)OTY last year (at least with the exception of THAT song), so I think that tells you all you need to know.

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.882): i love this album

**afs** (8.818): lmao the only track I had heard from this prior was play the greatest hits so the first tracks gave me severe whiplash

**apatel27** (8.773): It's just a solid album with no bad tracks

**imbaby122** (8.727): another one of my favorite albums of 2021, wolf alice captured a feeling in a bottle. nostalgia, loneliness, insecurity, homesickness, trying to find a sense of belonging. all the while delivering lush, cinematic banger after banger after banger. wolf alice knows how to write a good rock song, there’s little moments of genius throughout the album that give me goosebumps every time. ellie is the most impressive vocalist in the rate, both in technical ability, and emotively. everything comes together to make a cohesive and intriguing album.

**bridgemoney** (8.636): I've been listening to Wolf Alice for a few years, and it's great seeing them get the attention they deserve recently. Their sound hasn't been the same for any of their albums, but Ellie's so dynamic as a vocalist that they can make almost anything work. Definitely one of the best UK bands out there right now.

**breadcrumbs6969** (8.591): definitely the most fun, but the middle section is very clearly the weak link

**RandomHypnotica** (8.391): The first time I listened to this album, I liked it, but didn't pay it too much mind overall apart from Beach II which i looped the fuck out of. Then, shortly before this rate, I started looping Play The Greatest Hits. Doing the rate, I've now started looping Lipstick on the Glass. A new track on this album stands out every time I relisten to it, and I think that's a great sign of quality.

**steamedasparagus** (8.273): spent an embarrassing amount getting a blue weekend shirt shipped to Florida

**oscarbrierley1** (8.227): the dark Electro rock sound just works for me. It was a struggle to not rate half the album higher than everything else

**SmileAndTears** (8.164): A lot better than I remember, to the point where I might go back to this album from time to time. Delicious Things is just that bitch

**CrimsonROSET** (8.000): oh i forgot to leave a comment on this at first but it’s such a welcome discovery! These other three albums focus much more on the indie side than the rock side, so i’m happy to see that one artist decided ‘fuck it let’s get loud let’s get quirky let’s get weird’ to imo great heights

**skargardin** (8.000): It loses some steam in the back half but the highlights are EXCELLENT!

**plastichaxan** (8.000): I’m surprised this held its own for me against such strong albums, I guess part of it cause it grew on me and part of it cause I was in a good mood rating it but it is also good it just could be way better, the potential is clearly there

Stryxen: **thedoctordances1940** (7.882): english people are confusing

**BasedButta** (7.864): nothing that incredible, but very, very high quality, maybe even better than jubilee, but, strangely, not as remarkable. anyway this rate was awesome

**jman457** (7.818): This album has such amazing songs, but as a whole can a bit uneven. But shows Wolf Alice one of the most talented bands today

**Awkward\_King** (7.818): my hair is currently dyed the blue weekend colour collab they did w bleach london so i feel obligated to stan

**camerinian** (7.818): holy shit do these guys know how to build a crescendo

**cremeebrulee** (7.782): female manipulator music yass

**bo\_g\_o** (7.773): it's good! not every song is a winner but it's very enjoyable as a whole

**TiltControls** (7.773): I hadn't relistened to this in full for a few months and I'm surprised how much more I liked some of the tracks this time around! Really great stuff!

**vayyiqra** (7.727): I gave this album a try once. It was meh, not into it. I thought it was quite critically acclaimed, yet the #rates hivemind seemed to think it wasn't good. This confuses me, because upon a second listen it's really ??? good ??? Alt-rock with dream-pop vibes ??? okay I'll stop doing the Tumblr thing with the punctuation. Anyway, this is quite a vibe, and would really hit on a humid summer's night, I think. There were good crunchy rock riffs, there were some synthy moments, some ethereal vibes. This album lived up to the hype I had heard before and I think it will be in my regular rotation from now on.

**throwaway-7650** (7.682): I didn't care for this album at all in 2021 so... progress!

**celladonn** (7.636): This grows on me a little every time I hear it... it's good :)

**frogaranaman** (7.545): why is this rate so gay

**NewAccountNow** (7.500): I don’t know how i missed this album but I’m happy i got to it.

**therokinrolla** (7.455): Wolf Alice certainly released an enjoyable album - there is a grit to the production that feels quite uniquely paired to the delicacy of Ellie's voice. It doesn't lack flavor, but it does feel as though it lacks some salt. While often demanding attention via it's volume and density, it fails to leave a lasting artistic impact, rather tending to marinate in it's genre than leave a unique impression. Good album, but I don't see myself revisiting it.

**welcome2thejam** (7.455): Wolf Alice got memed a bit at indieheads for people getting upset in threads over its lack of year-end placements. I can see the appeal, very solid album thoughout, but nothing really hit the top-tier that would make me be a "Where's Wolf Alice?" type of guy

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.364): Technically it’s my second favorite album in this rate but… I don't know. I just didn’t connect to it as much as I wanted to. Sounds pretty though!

**shhhneak** (7.255): Passes the vibe check.

**bespectacIed** (7.182): The only album in the rate I listened for the 1st time... And I was pleasantly surprised! It is an enjoyable record with superb instrumentals, but tbh it didn't jump on me, shake my shoulders, and rock my core like the rest of the albums in this rate. I wish there was more thematic cohesion instead of being a collection of anthemic songs. And there were as much super profound songwriting than there were boring ones in here.

**MassiveThief** (7.045): definitely my favorite album of the bunch, mostly because it changes up so much. The other 3 are just so samey and don't have the songwriting to back it up, this has dream pop vibes to hard rock and stuff in between.

**bulforster** (6.809): Enjoyed this more than I thought I would! It's maybe the most consistent album in the rate? Just lacking a true standout track I think

**2dina3dworld** (6.636): this is… probably not the fourth I would’ve chosen! Sure it was very popular, but it’s a pretty safe and boring album. It doesn’t stand out that much, and a lot of the songs just verge on “there”. In a post-punk world, it just doesn’t seem inventive or inspiring or even just cool. It’s incredibly 2010s, and I mean this in that it sounds “too clean” (which is a complaint I’ve heard about the Beths as well) and it doesn’t feel like it took any risks outside of “Play the Greatest Hits”. There’s no unique colour, no innovation or anything that sets Wolf Alice apart from any other indie band.

**kappyko** (5.773): The kind of album that people would be angry over for not appearing on year-end lists then proceed to say they did not listen to anything on the actual list

**BeauMeringue212** (5.609): I really tried to get into this album, I didn't go into the rate with the aim of tanking it. There's nothing technically "wrong" with it either, none of the songs are atrocious or anything. But only 2 songs left any kind of memorable impact on me and made me feel something

**n1colas valentine stan** (5.027): "check it out. vibe it. really really dig on it... and then... remember that feeling." me trying to stockholm myself for months into liking this project, but at least it serves a good purpose into being a good album to nap to

**fadedblue09** (4.909): Normally I try to rate things on their own and avoid comparing them with the others, but I feel that this album is out of place here. The other 3 are all emotional songwriter albums, but this one is straight-up alt-rock. Besides not being fond of the vocal production, I find this album lacking in an emotional backbone that I can resonate with, and thus I ended up having a very….hollow listening experience. Apologies to the fans, but I just couldn't connect with anything here.

**Stryxen** (10): I cannot speak enough praise about this song - it didn’t hit too much on first listen when it was released as a single. I thought “meh be sweet is better” well basically: I was wrong. EASILY one of my favourite songs. Ever. I don’t even know where to begin with writing about this song.

“Can you tell I’ve been posing / This way alone for hours” is an instantly iconic lyric, backed up by this almost groaning synthy orchestra. It is so sensual, so intimate, so heart wrenching. “Closeness / Proximity / I needed / Bondage”. Every lyric following is calculated, as she holds back from begging to this person. And then that sudden moment of clarity after the abandonment - “When the world divides into two people / those who have felt pain / and those who have yet to” it comes like an epiphany, that she swiftly shakes off and goes straight back to begging - she is so regretfully head over heels for this person who will never be able to give her the attention she needs. I’ve been there. I can’t write about how amazing this song is - it just exceeds any words I have.

This was winning, between ballots #10 - #40 Bondage was occupying the top spot almost constantly. And then it just dropped after a string of 5-7s. And I was heartbroken, but I was glad to see the 11s for this. You guys get it.

---

#those who have felt pain

**ACORGIORGY** (11): This song goes from good to transcendent the instant the second verse starts.

**BeauMeringue212** (11): this wasn't my favourite song on the album on first listen, but after many relistens and after reading Crying In H-Mart, Michelle's memoirs about her relationship with her late mother, it just resonates so much more. The "when the world divides into two people..." lyric is actually in the book. It's a beautifully longing song, and when you find out about some of the grief that possibly inspired it it feels much more devastating

**steamedasparagus** (11): Had fun telling my family my fav song of the year was called 'posing in bondage'

**welcome2thejam** (11): Everything about this song is gorgeous, constantly leaves me stunned in my seat. Perfectly builds and builds until that final third, honestly might be one of my all-time favorite minutes in music.

**1998tweety** (10): their best song

**akanewasright** (10): insert Mike Wazouski with microphone meme

**Arybeck67** (10): ahhhh this song is so damn good. Fully encapsulates the feeling of longing for that love and affection you once used to receive so often but now no longer get. The production is incredible as well.

**bespectacIed** (10): breaks my heart to not give 11 to my absolute favorite song on the album. I've been obsessed with this song for a looong time like it was therapy lol. The lyrics, man. The production. The double entendre on 'posing', the bait and switch on 'bondage'... The chorus that smashed Maslow's pyramid of needs... That genius second verse that challenged miss Britney's tenets1 in Circus... So fucking slayful. What a flawless song.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): who wants to go fuck around in a supermarket in the middle of the night with me

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): loved it, expected something sexual and very glad it wasn't, sounds ethernal

**cherryices** (10): does this remind anyone else of big girls don’t cry?

**cremeebrulee** (10): the last minute of this track where the vocals cut out and it’s just the shimmery, gorgeous instrumental? literally healing. she’s right i DO need it

**CrimsonROSET** (10): of course this is an assumption, but a song about intimacy? where are my sex bops Michelle!

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is one of the songs that I have learned to appreciate more, it really kicks in after the first chorus. Shit, I just realized this might be my favorite song off the album and I truly want to give it my 11 😭

**jman457** (10): If Rihanna’s S&M was a cool girl

**Mudkip1** (10): this is maybe the best song ever made

**musical\_pyn** (10): my favorite song from the album and my favorite song from 2021 (until this rate)

**plastichaxan** (10): no cause the first time i got tied up i was so scared he was gonna leave me there this is so relatable

**seanderlust** (10): "those who have felt pain, and those who have yet to" send tweet

**SFbby** (10): I think we could all use a little bondage in our lives

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Throwback to when some "photographer" on Grindr asked me if i wanted to model leather gear for him

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this song makes me want a relationship then I realize I’m doing rates

**throwaway-7650** (10): I didn't care for this as a single but in the album... a 10

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): the gradual build-up and the sonic layering builds such a dreamy atmosphere plus i really enjoy the lyrics

**UselessTacooo** (10): Deep dark synths? Sign me up

**vayyiqra** (10): An 11-worthy song, especially with the beautiful and aesthetic video, I think of this as a companion piece to "Be Sweet". That seems very weird since they sound nothing alike, but that's kind of the idea; one is an uptempo enthusiastic song about pining and longing and whatever, like it's putting up a front to hide how lonely you are, and this song is just openly and plainly saying it. Something existential crisis something ennui, but with ramen in a convenient store late at night with a stranger you just met. And that's beautiful. :hanawinsCries:

**wailord\_fan** (10): This is a definite 11 contender. The beat change about halfway through reminds me so much of a Pokemon soundtrack.

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): Didn't like the song at first, but then I saw the music video and it intrigued me. And then suddenly I was walking down the aisle getting married to it. Am in love.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.7): absolutely killer outro

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): this is the horniest (metaphorical) song in the rate

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): finally an anthem for the vampire gays

**synyyy** (9.5): I was keen to check the music video out after hearing the title's name. Sadly, there was no bondage.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): dissapontingly SFW

**thedoctordances1940** (9.1): wait this is incredible actually

**afs** (9): am I the only one who thought about atoms when I saw this title (and kinda manifested to be correct???)

**bridgemoney** (9): Between this and Road Head, Michelle must have a pretty interesting sex life.

**camerinian** (9): not to be crass or anything but hnnnnnnggggggh

**celladonn** (9): those who have felt pain and those who have yet to... ah.

**quinnpsych** (9): This was actually the song that got me into JB properly. The sexiness and insecurity of this song are fantastic. I love so much. This whole album she nails yearning

**TiltControls** (9): bondage for cars

**shhhneak** (8.9): Vers energy.

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): I think about this song whenever I see this guy on the apps who lives very close to me who is a photographer and does free fetish shoots. Honestly? I could use some LinkedIn quality lewds and nudes for the girlies to gag on

**imbaby122** (8.5): michelle made this for the touch-starved girlies thank you michelle.

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Mesmerizing song but I would have to be in a very specific mood to listen to it I think

**n1colas valentine stan** (8): has she not heard of social distancing?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): maybe this is just because im watching the music video as i watch this but lord is this song is so sexy

**BasedButta** (7.5): gets going once the instrumental layers start coming in, pretty good but i’ve seen this vibe done better before

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): For HOURS? Damn that sounds uncomfortable.

**reput4tionera** (7): this song is nice but it’s not my fav on the album y’know

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): the music video being set at the same store as the Shallow scene from a star is born… she was really off the deep end for that one

**NewAccountNow** (6.5): but not by much

**homestarguy** (6): Opening sounds like something from the “Fez” OST. Pretty nifty sonically, but kinda boring outside of the ending groove. Calling out the safe word for this one.

**jay?** (6): did not gag that much why lie

**qazz23** (6): Not that interesting except the outro

**runaway3212** (6): the way she sings is so boring but then the instrumental comes in and it just starts to jam so bad and then she starts singing again and it's just like damn I wish we could've gotten this track instrumentally.

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Nice to see her channeling an FKA Twigs impression but doesn't really work for me

**frogaranaman** (5): if the Spotify algorithm decided to make a song based off of what it likes to suggest to people this is what it would come up with

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): This kinda sucks. But idk I also thought Oxytocin sucked, so maybe I just don’t have a taste for arthouse-y songs

**Awkward\_King** (2): i am sorry for what i am saying but i have never been a fan of the melody of this song i find the chorus really grating and wanted to force myself to like it because of how coming of age movie soundtrack it is which is usually my shit but this just.... i dont know, it doesnt work for me. i like elements, like i think the build-up is effective just not for me, and i think a lot of the lyrics are slay, but it just doesn't hit for me like it should

**MassiveThief** (1): complete snoozefest if im bein honest

**Stryxen** (10): The little 8 minute epic that could, and DID. This was truly unexpected and I will be very surprised if anyone even predicts this placing over Posing For Cars, nevermind in the top 5! This song steadily worked its way from early day 3 up to here by a constant steady influx of well-deserved 11s, totaling up to 13! The most common comparison people make with this song is obviously Night Shift, and while I agree it doesn’t quite reach the epic high of Lucy’s best song, and one of the top 10 songs of all time, it’s magnificent in crafting a complete and thorough narrative, as well as contributing to and capping the album’s plot and concept - truly masterful and I am THRILLED to give this song such a high accolade (at the time of writing this it’s just bubbling under a 9-average, I hope it can crack it [it didn’t])! She really opened her shows with this on tour - didn’t even say hi first.

---

#nothing worse could happen now

**1998tweety** (11): love night shift's little sister, masterpiece.

**bespectacIed** (11): Okay, where do I start. Reject Japanese Breakfast sure-win, embrace Lucy Dacus supremacy. Upon my first run through the album, it got me saying "hmmm this is the pièce de resistance, the main bitch of the album" to multiple songs lol... Hot and Heavy: perfect already how could she top this... hold up, VBS is a server...nope it has to be Thumbs... but wait Brando is the true slayer.... until it finally solidified with the closer (ala former rate winner I Know The End). What a masterpiece of a song! A showcase of the transformative power of songwriting. This phenomenal, seven-minute queer saga went through the hyperspecifics of well-remembered memories, zoomed into the painful details, and finally climaxed on that one important fork-on-the-road moment in the past: the TRIPLE DOG DARE. Like, Lucy knows what happened has already happened, it can't be changed. But what if she and her "friend" took that leap on that one singular point in their lives? That one dare they ultimately didn't commit into ... what if they did??? It's impossible to go back to that moment...but in one final verse, Lucy made an open-ended reimagination of her past, gave us something equally hopeful and heartbreaking (whichever way you see it) and made one of the most E P I C indie rock songs of the past few years.

**bo\_g\_o** (11): i don't really know how to express my feelings about this song. it conveys this feeling of being in love with your best friend but not being able to see them because their parents are homophobic and don't want you around them. it strikes a chord that every LGBT person can relate to, the fear of losing someone due to hatred and bigotry, the self-loathing and fear people have, and the yearning, oh god, the yearning. maybe not all LGBT people have encountered this (I am lucky enough to have never gone through this myself), but nevertheless everyone understands the pain of going through this, and the desire to run away from these restrictions and build a new life with the one you love. and let's not ignore how this song fucking builds! yes, it's seven minutes long, but it spends those seven minutes building more and more tension until it releases all of it in a euphoric climax where lucy imagines getting what she wants and running away and starting a romantic relationship with her best friend. god i love this song.

**daybed** (11): I try to not listen to this song that much cause it's just too sad, but! she delivered very hard, as of today i have 138 plays of it, i have yet to experience something as amazing as this it breaks me every single time, best song to ever exist probably.

**frogaranaman** (11): uh oh!!! here comes the buildup that makes me want to cry from growing up queer and Catholic at the same time!!!!!!!

**pheromenos** (11): need i say more

**songbirdskeepsinging** (11): changed my life. Best album closer

**TiltControls** (11): This level of storytelling, the build-up, the vocals... perfection. It's long but it works so amazingly

**xxipil0ts** (11): - im p sure it's an experience to have homoromantic experiences while exploring our sexualities in our youth. i actually cried the first time listening to this just bc of how much i remember being so closeted but out to someone and we got a little too close. i luv lucy so much.

**akanewasright** (10): oh this is… brilliant

**Arybeck67** (10): fuck this describes young wlw love so well. Being closeted, not knowing why the world hates you before you've even declared yourself to be gay. Perfect.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now THIS is a closer.

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): the beginning was a bit slow, but i love songs with stories and you know how to start a flame is such an excellent line with context

**camerinian** (10): the bit about stealing a boat and running away officially makes this song yacht rock, therefore my headcanon ending for the album is Lucy and this girl cracking into the margaritas and blasting the Steely Dan until they die in a Poseidon-style rogue wave

**celladonn** (10): fuck

**endcreditouilles** (10): this is the midwestern bisexual agenda

**GapeCod** (10): Do you have something against DOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOGS?!

**gimmeyotacos** (10): hot take- this is arguably lucy’s best song after night shift

**jay?** (10): gag why lie

**jman457** (10): nothing like a song that wants you to escape your hometown and watch the world burn

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): the gay agenda is real and its this song

**quinnpsych** (10): I mean, the build in this song, the childhood story romance once again. It's fantastic. It's showstopping

**ReallyCreative** (10): that's how you end an album girlies

**reput4tionera** (10): i love really long songs!!!!!! also i wrote a whole paragraph on this song for my writing class and i got a B on it (the entire semester’s worth of papers was graded in one thing so i couldn’t see if i got a B on this paper specifically but like who cares). this song deserved more than a paragraph but i needed to stay on topic y’know

**seanderlust** (10): the gay yearning.....I'm gonna spontaneously combust

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I can't believe she decided to open her tour with the most depressing song of 2021

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): this song slaps

**throwaway-7650** (10): this and posing with cars sit at the same table. to rave.dj!

**UselessTacooo** (10): Perfection. A beautifully handled slow build into an explosion of a lifetime. A definite highlight of the album, if not the rate

**wailord\_fan** (10): The 7 minute SERVE. oh boy this song makes me sad, but only because I discovered it during the peak of my relationship, and I could see him with me forever, and then because of family issues and his own emotional short comings, things ended, and now the second verse hurts. "I never touched you how I wanted to / What can I say to your mom to let you come outside". I wish families would just be more open and accepting of their LGBT+ kids...

**waluigiest** (10): I’m gay and in levitating

**afs** (9.5): you will NEVER be I know the end (I'm sorry)

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): Lucy, you can't just end an album like that and expect me to be okay. I feel such despair and romance and grief and a looming feeling that I will never experience love... oopsie!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): did she really end up with her face on milk jugs? "Anyways", that word ruins this song for me

**bridgemoney** (9): Run away with me, but actually gay.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): THE LAST NINETY SECONDS? I MEAN COME ON

**homestarguy** (9): Love how Lucy imagines her own happy ending to a “what could have been” romance. On this album I appreciate how she juxtaposes phrases from childhood like “do you love me not” and “triple dog dare” with the more serious and unknown parts of growing up.

**steamedasparagus** (9): ha gayyy!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this song gave me musical blue balls for cutting out that ending explosion so early

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Ugh she’s such a good lyricist

**BeauMeringue212** (8.7): I feel like this one must sound great in arenas, it's very anthemic. Love the burst toward the end

**imbaby122** (8.5): i think i set my expectations too high bc i saw this song was 7 minutes and expected night shift levels of build up and payoff but this is still good

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the build up is really good. Its makes the length work for me

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): she's got him there 🤷

**synyyy** (8.5): Drugs are better, drugs are better than--wait wrong song

**violet** (8.5): cute and sad at the same time

=====

Stryxen: **cremeebrulee** (8.3): i feel like . she's trying to recreate the emotional buildup of night shift but it doesn't quite get there. still, it's quite a heartbreaking song and a really unique way to close off an album of reminiscence by rewriting this ending

**runaway3212** (8): the worst closer in this rate until it become the best closer in the rate

**SmileAndTears** (8): Sad that the beginning is slow and boring because otherwise the song is really good

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): really solid closer

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): the first 4 minutes are kinda :midafexplosion: but then like it does really pick up after that

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Overstays but I enjoyed the buildup and storytelling

**Awkward\_King** (7): is this the i know the end of the rate

**MassiveThief** (7): it's cool, I like the climax in the outro but still feels a bit too long

**qazz23** (7): nice ending, but it's sooo long

#i guess the end is here

**BasedButta** (6): it gets decent towards the end, but she’s extremely hellbent on the emptier sounding instrumentals and i hate it, the first 5 minutes are very boring…

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I’m begging these indie girlies to stop having the longest song at the end of the album

**indiefan** (6): honestly didn’t get much of my attention sonically until the last two minutes

**Raykel** (6): I get why people like this but for some reason when the band fully comes in it sounds like my headphones are doing that thing where the wire is getting worn out and making the sound come in and out, it took me a bit to realize that was just the song.

**vayyiqra** (6): I just realized there are a lot of references to watching movies on this album and its title is Home Video. Wow I should not have begun this album after staying up all night. Anyway - like a lot of the album, good storytelling in the lyrics even though musically the song's not really my thing.

**Stryxen** (10): Just a fantastic song, and iconic opener! This song lets me live my rockstar fantasy lip-syncing and air-guitaring - everyone does it. don’t lie - and how it just builds and releases again and again always at the perfect times. She came back with something to SAY and I was hooked from first listen - this is already in my top 10 most scrobbled songs ever with over 200 listens.

I’m sure deep down many people had hope this could snatch the win in an upset, but after the massacre the first two days… mollusc friends I think we should gracefully accept this as a win - she’ll probably be back for day 1 on all stars after all!

It’s quite a shame this song couldn’t quite get the 9+ average, but I’m not surprised by this placement.. After a while it became very clear the only songs that ever stood a chance of winning were our top 3… after this elimination, it gets real close.

#darling raters

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this song… the instant I heard this song I knew I was gonna be into this album. I'd heard Heat Waves and Pristine before, and liked them, but never fully loved them (I still hadn't listened to Lush in full at that point), and yet when this song came out, it was a quiet week, so I decided to give it a listen... and I was instantly hooked. The absolute explosion of emotion when that chorus crashes in is so euphoric and heartbreaking and passionate and filled exactly the hole that I didn't realise I had. If I'm being honest with myself, there are other songs on this album I love slightly more, and should probably 11, and even though this won't beat jbrekkie, I still want to give it the best chance possible (and it still absolutely deserves the 11, I can only give out one unfortunately).

**Raykel** (11): Love when a song has a statement first lyric then the synths fully come in, it's like you've been just told a secret that'll change everything.

**runaway3212** (11): SO WHYD YOU WANNA ERASE MEEEEE

**1998tweety** (10): ended February 14th

**2dina3dworld** (10): the verses let this one down, but there’s a very strong chorus and instrumentation hidden within.

**akanewasright** (10): “SO WHY’D YOU WANNA ERASE ME??????? DAAARLING VALENTINE????” me when a boy I like doesn’t talk to me as much for a day

**Arybeck67** (10): "Let's go be alone, where no one can see us honey" I know Lindsey here is talking about her relationship with Amandla Stenberg, but damn does that hit when you've been in a closeted gay relationship. This song quite literally encapsulates the feelings you have when you are first broken up with by someone you were in love with, and the mixed emotions that come from it.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this title track so perfectly like encapsulates the vibe of the album cover i adore it so much, the gorgeous red, the slightly stilted posing, it is subtle yet undeniably eyecatching. the chorus of this song hits me like a brich every time and it is perfect.

**bespectacIed** (10): She was at her lowest... Dragged to filth as industry plant, set up to fail by P4k's overenthusiasm, gay, on every white male indie fan's hitlist... She had something to prove. She had 10 dollars, a synthesizer, and a dream. Job done.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Oh wow what an exciting, dynamic song I’m sure it’s a sign of what else is to come on this album.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): if only the rest of this album was as great as this song

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): literally one of the best album openers in the history of planet earth, grabbed me the first time i listened to the album and never let go since

**bridgemoney** (10): I adore this.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this album could have been a one song ep

**daybed** (10): top 10 songs of 2021 snail is such a joy to listen to

**DefaultPophead** (10): I love songs that allow me to scream.

**fadedblue09** (10): The chorus hard carries this one, but it's such a powerful one

**hikkaru** (10): we kinda want snail mail to slumber party

**homestarguy** (10): God those hazy synths in the intro, the lustful lyrics, THAT CHORUS. This one has it all, and sets the standard high for the rest of the album.

**jay?** (10): yup yup yup

**musical\_pyn** (10): so why'd you wanna erAAAAASSSSEEEEE MEEEEEE

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): wow someone is going to make a joke about biphobia aren’t they

**plastichaxan** (10): i know this will pull snail mail through and well look at the material here it’s just kinda the best song ever

**quinnpsych** (10): Wow this is definitely one of my favourite songs from the last couple years. What the fuck even is the drop into the chorus, it's so charged with energy and desire and longing. Trend alert: yearning

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): "why'd you wanna erase me?" - my bisexuality to Snail Mail when I have a boyfriend and write a song using female pronouns #NotAPhoebeBridgersAlt #StreamSilkChiffon

**synyyy** (10): Is this how it feels to be gay AND sad? I got myself a new spiritual animal!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): "So why'd you wanna erase me?" - Bi people to snail mail

**throwaway-7650** (10): ...anyway stream phoebe bridgers - sidelines, a future 11 btw!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): really great opener, a clear highlight on this record

**UselessTacooo** (10): My first introduction to this song was the Popheads Top 100 Songs Of 2021, and boy was it an introduction. At first I was confused. I had heard so many great things about the song, but the first verse felt flat and mediocre. Then, out of nowhere came this explosion of a chorus and I was left needing to pick my jaw up off the floor. It explains the iffy intro and creates a perfect experience. While the song itself may not be the best thing ever, the experience more than makes up for it.

**wailord\_fan** (10): Another 11 contender baby. Good golly what a great album opener. It's a shame that the album suffers by having its strongest song both as its first single, and the album opener.

**waluigiest** (10): if this had come out when I was 19 I would have been so unwell

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): the chorus is really good but the rest of the song, I wish there was more done with it. But I can ignore than for “WHY DID YOU WANT TO ERASE ME DARLING VALENTINE”

**violet** (9.5): so whyd u wanna erase meee

**bulforster** (9.3): you just can't deny that chorus

**shhhneak** (9.3): This is the best title song in this rate

**afs** (9): NOT INDEPENDENT rock

**BasedButta** (9): BasedButta’s school of music TIPS: if your verses are slower sounding, you need some texture on the instrumentals and a chorus payoff… and this checks out both boxes! (psa, BasedButta’s school of music tips doesn’t do anything besides reaffirm their music tastes, it's worthless)

**gimmeyotacos** (9): great opener! so catchy! so fun to scream along to this

**ReallyCreative** (9): the openers in this rate are so good

**skargardin** (9): SO WHY'D YOU WANNA ERASE MEE

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): Just Monika.

**TiltControls** (9): Took a bit to grow on me, but damn that chorus does great work

**vayyiqra** (9): I don't know where I've heard this song before (maybe Popheads Jukebox?) but I really like the chorus and its alt-rock vibe. Very 90s. I grew up on this stuff.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Chorus packs a wallop (especially that riff!) and I love the resignation in way she sings "I adore you" in the outro

**songbirdskeepsinging** (8.7): Best song on the album. The rest really lack a punchy melody.

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): this is far from the best song on the album but it's probably gonna go the furthest which frustrates me because i have a love-hate relationship with the chorus. the verses are great tho

**steamedasparagus** (8.5): the contrast between the verse and the chorus is a bit much but strangely enough I don't have that issue with Madonna

**jman457** (8.3): This is good, but it got a bit overplayed on my local alt radio

**GapeCod** (8): "You won't believe what just 2 months do": me doing a 180 on this album over the course of the rate. Jokes aside, somehow this is my least favorite single, which may be a hot take. I love Lush very very much, so I should love this title track too, since it serves as a perfect transition between the two albums, but at the same time... said transition is the thing that doesn't work for me that well, for reasons I can't properly articulate. I still like the song, but it had me scared for the direction this album was going to take when it first came out.

**imbaby122** (8): let’s go lesbians let’s go

**qazz23** (8): I like the harder sound during the chorus

**reput4tionera** (8): oh she kinda slayed with this (note after i finished this album— this was the only song i actually enjoyed)

**Overall Average**: 7.347 **// Average Controversy:** 1.844

Uberpigeon: i like this album AHGHGHA

Stryxen: what benji said but i LOVE this album. And its performance was just horrible to witness, from the beginning it was very clear she would struggle, and it ended up not being the worst it got through the rating period lol. At one point 8/10 were day 1, Forever (Sailing) was early day 2 and Valentine was just scraping the top 10. Glad we sorted ourselves out, slightly. This easily takes the lowest album average in the rate, which is a shame. This was in my top 5 AOTY, which was massive because my expectations after the perfection of Lush were HIGH. And she *just* about met them.

**n1colas valentine stan** (10.000): why do you guys hate lesbians

**Arybeck67** (9.800): this album was my favorite album of 2021, and holds a special place in my heart as the album that defined my relationship with my first love and it's subsequent disintegration. It is a perfect album that captures the feeling of young wlw heartbreak to its most minute detail. I have no idea if popheads will give this album the love it deserves, but I sure will.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.620): this album... I'm just so enraptured by it. It's truly one of my favourite albums ever, there are so many songs on here that I am absolutely obssessed with and could listen to for hours (and have!), it just connects with me on a compeltely different level, and I know this rate is going to hurt me, but if it does... i have the perfect heartbreak music to listen to!

**breadcrumbs6969** (9.400): she put her whole snailussy into this one and i love it, the first half was much stronger but it's still my favourite by far, and also unfortunately saw myself in way too many of these songs but lindsey may i please suggest a therapist???

**musical\_pyn** (9.100): I listened to this album last year but it didn't really grab me, but listening to it again for this rate things just clicked and I fell in love...might be my favorite album in the rate by the end of this

**plastichaxan** (9.000): Overhated album, I kinda get why, but still, I really really like this and discovering Snail Mail last year was a highlight. I write this from the past but I want you popheads to know I am disappointed, I am disgusted and this deserved better. I just can feel I will be feeling that.

**gimmeyotacos** (8.820): lindsey jordan is the queen of unrequited love and yearning so yes i’m gonna listen to her music and yes i’m gonna love it no matter what direction she goes in and yes i’m gonna defend her when people complain about her going “too pop” or being “too polished.” her lyrics hurt me in a deep and personal way that’s unrivaled by most artists

**bespectacIed** (8.700): Snail Mail is an enjoyable artist, and this was a great followup to her breakthrough album. She sounds mature, massive as her built-up hype, and ironically, more lush than ever. And the songwriting is so much stronger here.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.650): One thing that captivated me about Valentine was its run time. Snail Mail could have gone on and overstayed her welcome but she decided to keep it short and sweet, which is appreciated. Not that she doesn't use her time effectively, Valentine hooks you immediately with it's title track and keeps things rosy throughout. Solid, solid, solid. 8.5/10

**throwaway-7650** (8.400): the front half would be a 10/10 EP and the back half... well

**akanewasright** (8.400): I think I like about half the album, and am uncomfortably read to filth by the other half. I genuinely like this album a lot, but at some point it stops being fun and starts being just ugly. Which isn’t bad, just. Wow

**steamedasparagus** (8.300): I told all of my friends about her 'how to install a bidet' youtube short

**bridgemoney** (8.200): None of the songs here reached the heights of Pristine or Heat Wave, but it's still a pretty good album. Lindsey has one of the most unique voices I've ever heard, and I loved hearing all the imperfections in her vocal delivery. The acoustic songs could go though.

**welcome2thejam** (8.200): Improved in standing a teensy bit since last year, and it was already on my top ten AOTY. Front-loaded, but the end pacing makes sense. Lindsay does such a good job of portraying both desperate for love and resigned to her romantic fate

**My friend Ais** (7.650): my fave of these women

**cremeebrulee** (7.550): lindsey please hmu i will treat you better i promise

**Awkward\_King** (7.500): hypno

**ktajlili** (7.500): I think this is a bit underrated, especially on popheads. It's not the most interesting album. There are too many slow songs that kind of sound the same, but when it hits, it hits HARD. I still feel emotional listening to headlock, and Valentine is so catchy and explosive. I think Valentine really conveys what it's like to have your heart broken and then slowly heal.

**skargardin** (7.500): I think I'm going to need some more listens of this album for it to fully click it me, it has a lot of great moments though for sure!

**majid** (7.410): she set the bar quite high with her debut album, i am still pretty happy with what this album turned out to be. she has clearly ventured to a poppier sound, while also still being fairly consistent with her songwriting

**imbaby122** (7.400): valentine is a solid album, though it fails to reach the highs that the other three albums in this rate achieve. lindsey’s songwriting is not as strong as the others, and the production can leave something to be desired. the album never really falters though, just stalls. when the album steps out of the conventions of its genre, when it has pay off to its build up, when a song is lyrically compelling and strong, or when a vocal performance is particularly striking, i can see snail mail’s brilliance seeping through.

**TiltControls** (7.350): It's not my favourite of the 4 albums and some of the songs took a little while to grow on me, but it's solid overall

**vayyiqra** (7.200): I think I've heard this album before? No wait, that was Lush, which I randomly listened to last summer. It was alright. Anyway, I need to slightly redact what I said about Home Video - I kept saying "this is alright, I can see the appeal, but indie rock isn't a genre I like". Like anything else, there are exceptions, and I think this album is the kind of indie I can dig, being a bit more poppy. (This is also why I like Jubilee.) Ironically my favourite genre used to be rock, but not indie - I'm not cool enough for that. However there's an alt-rock sound here on many songs that brings to mind my troubled youth. I'm into it. This album surprised me by how much I liked it - I always had this idea in my head that Snail Mail would be kind of boring to me, frankly. This was not the case !

**Posing-With-Fishes** (7.200): she can hit hard, but it's far between

**therokinrolla** (7.050): I love her voice, I love her passion, and in her best songs, I love her deliberacy. Her songs with well-fed visions pan out spectacularly, and should form the basis of an indie rock classic album. Alas, she falters with the most inconsistent album of the bunch that prefers to revel in non-specifics, sonically and lyrically. Her voice got me through it though.

**BeauMeringue212** (7.050): It's a solid album with some great tracks, and I really like her vocals, but I think it's just a bit too one-note

=====

Stryxen: **SmileAndTears** (6.920): This album falls into the background so quickly for me. It’s not bad, just deeply, aggressively unremarkable.

**NewAccountNow** (6.850): good album but i was expecting more after Lush, still looking forward to more from Lindsey

**jman457** (6.690): Sorry this album didnt connect with me at all, which sucks because I really liked her first album.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.650): title track is just like by far the best song on the album and the rest is kinda eh mainly

**indiefan** (6.520): Decent production, Boring ass voice. Sorry not sorry :P

**BasedButta** (6.450): she’s good! some low lows but good all in all!

**IIIHenryIII** (6.400): I'm gonna start by saying my average doesn't reflect how I truly feel about this album. I was very kind to it because I like this type of music, so I couldn't give any of these songs a score below 5, except the atrocious Madonna (does that make any sense?). If I had to give this album a score, it would be a 4 or maybe a 5. Well, now that I got this out of the way… just a bunch of disconnected thoughts: I wouldn't mind if all of these tracks got out on day 1. I really don't like her whining/sobbing voice. The way she sings, her enunciation is annoying. I don't think this is a good album. All of these songs sound the same. There's nothing original about her music.

**shhhneak** (6.330): Phoebe Bridgers sends her regards.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.300): Okay so I don’t like her voice. That should probably be apparent by now from all my comments. It’s like she has what I call “sorority girl rasp” (someone please tell me I’m not making this up and this is a real observable phenomenon!! Think “Maddie, Recruitment Vice President” from that one sorority video lmao). Thankfully it’s not as bad as… other artists I’ve rated, and the instrumentation is really vivid and lush (wink) and it’s still pretty easy to immerse yourself in the vibe, even if you have to hear a voice crack every 5 seconds.

**frogaranaman** (6.300): well written but def the last one I'd revisit out the bunch

**apatel27** (6.300): It's decent but the duds are more non descript than the other albums

**just\_thonking** (6.250): I love Valentine! (the song)

**CrimsonROSET** (6.100): I like this album when it remembers what indie rock is

**qazz23** (6.100): the more upbeat moments are good, but otherwise it fades into the background

**fadedblue09** (5.900): There seems to be a consensus that this is the weakest album in the rate. While I can see why, I probably enjoyed this more than expected. I appreciate the emotional rawness of the record, even if it does not necessarily translate to an enjoyable listen.

**oscarbrierley1** (5.850): sorry to this album. It sounds like she's losing her voice for the whole thing. Apart from that it's just like a less interesting version of the other albums in the rate.

**celladonn** (5.800): This is like easily the weakest album here i fear, though I have really tried to like it. I think part of it is that i just really dont like the way she sings a lot of the time. And the best tracks of this album really don't hold a candle to the best tracks of the others here.

**bo\_g\_o** (5.750): eh. bland indie rock that doesn't really offer anything interesting

**camerinian** (5.700): man I really tried with this album, there have been plenty of times I’ve gone into rates with next to no experience with an artist and come out a fan, but I don’t know how you could even suggest this isn’t the weakest collection in the rate. Japanese Breakfast has more interesting musical ideas, Lucy has better poetry and control of atmosphere and Wolf Alice has much stronger moments of catharsis, not to mention all three have better vocal presences. This feels like bog standard indie fare I could hear at any given time on student radio, and it’s fine at that, but it just doesn’t hold a candle to the other pieces here I’m sorry

**bulforster** (5.620): The songwriting just isn't really there on most of this for me.

**2dina3dworld** (5.300): Snail Mail’s voice does not do it for me. This album has a lot of good instrumentation, lyrics and other ideas but they’re all dragged down by how painful I find Snail Mail’s voice because it’s very thin and nasally. If the album kept the momentum of Valentine, then I’d be inclined to say that it’s a solid or even a good album, but slow songs make my problems with the vocals worse and are also just bland.

**kappyko** (5.100): This album literally shouldn't have been released

**thisusernameisntlong** (5.000): all these albums have great openers but the rest of the lineup have other highlights too

**songbirdskeepsinging** (4.830): weakest of the four albums i'm sorry

**MassiveThief** (4.800): not gonna lie this is rough. feels like all of the good songwriting was spent on the title track. most everything else is a snoozer. voice is nice, production is fine, but nothing is really memorable.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.700): i used to feel bad about not liking snail mail but after she came out as biphobic i dont feel bad anymore LMAO

**Stryxen** (10): A magical introduction: the marching band percussion, triumphant horns, lyrics and vocals that command your attention - it’s like being suddenly transported to a parade, to welcome in a new age of happiness. This song is a celebration of joy and a tender acknowledgement of the pain that is needed to allow love and wonder to exist. Paprika is equally one of the most heartbreaking and cathartic songs of all time. This album is healing, and Paprika is the centrepiece of it all.

Here we lose a LOT of 11s (by far the most in the rate, snatching that accolade from Triple Dog Dare in the last week of rating). I see the love for this song, but I’m glad it’s not the top 1 choice from this album… mostly because it doesn’t have a Simlish version of course!

---

#AT THE CENTRE OF MAGIC

**2dina3dworld** (11): this is the horniest (literal) song in the rate

**GapeCod** (11): One of the better Pringles flavors

**gimmeyotacos** (11): OHHHHH IT’S A RUSH!!! what a truly jubilant track. god i feel so alive whenever i listen to this song

**hunnybee12** (11): i'm not good at explaining why i like the music i like, i just know my heart feels full when i hear this. it makes me hopeful and happy and not much in this world can do that. i knew from my first listen this was a song that would mean a lot to me for a long long time

**imbaby122** (11): i can’t do this song justice through words but for me personally it perfectly encapsulates the feeling when you admire someone who’s magnetic and personable and who everyone loves. and i know that this song is supposed to be jubilant celebration of artistry but it makes me long to be special, to create magic, to light up a room, to have everyone waiting on my words. i want my presence to feel like the soundscape of this song, with its warm twinkly synths, and it’s cascading crashes, and it’s lush instrumentation. but it never will. it’s a bittersweet feeling to love that type of person and to know that you will never compare.

**NewAccountNow** (11): Absolutely perfect opening song

**plastichaxan** (11): i don’t think there’s any song that makes me feel the way this does, it just makes me teary eyed and feel so many things inside and i feel the need to scream “OH, IT’S A RUUUSH” cause that’s just exactly what the feeling is

**sarcasticsobs** (11): truly one of the most ~enchanting~ songs i’ve heard from the past couple of years, c’est manifique. ring that gong, baybeeee!

**SFbby** (11): So grandiose, so lush, so exuberant. I certainly am lingering onto every word she says.

**skargardin** (11): it IS a rush!!

**thedoctordances1940** (11): perfect song tbh, the horns omfg

**thisusernameisntlong** (11): SotY! It's a rush!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (11): one of the best album openers and pop songs of the past couple of years. its so bright and puts a huge smile on my face every listen

**UselessTacooo** (11): While I fully understand why Be Sweet is the big favorite from the album, I can't just ignore the greatness of this track. Maybe it's the horns, or maybe the explosive chorus, but something draws me to this song in a way no other does.

**1998tweety** (10): this is beautiful, ascending a little bit

**ACORGIORGY** (10): Thinking about her gleefully striking a gong to this live helped me survive 2021.

**BasedButta** (10): Paprika sweetie im sorry i couldn’t give you my eleven, you’re still better than 99.9% of the songs ever made

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Starting the album off with a beautifully written song musing what it's like to captivate people with your beautifully written songs is such a flex and I love it

**bespectacIed** (10): Perfect opener for an album about jubilation, my gawd. Exquisite songwriting, it's insane how good this is. The horns are too perfect. Also, me who hasn't seen the movie: yeah this absolutely captured the essence of the movie because of uhm, the flavor

**bridgemoney** (10): Really good on chicken.

**celladonn** (10): this is, like, overwhelmingly beautiful

**daybed** (10): this is one of the best songs ever made, everything from the lyrics to the production just sticks to you, truly a blessing that this songs even exists

**DefaultPophead** (10): The perfect album opener. The lyrics get me in a specific mood that is hard to replicate and define, yet I love so much. One of the best songs of 2021, and one of the best album openers ever. Wish I could have two 11s!

**GiveUpTheKingOfLimbs** (10): would be the best opener if it weren't those sneaky meddling british kids disguised as wolfes

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it sounds like a parade (complimentary)

**jman457** (10): An almost cathartic transition from the grief of her previous work to just pure happiness

**Mudkip1** (10): this is maybe the best song ever made

**reput4tionera** (10): she hit the slay button with this song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I want this for me so bad

**seanderlust** (10): she describes this feeling like a surreal parade and I think it nails that aesthetic. the horns are transcendent

**songbirdskeepsinging** (10): best opener

**therokinrolla** (10): This song makes me wonder if I've ever experienced true joy. True, visceral, experiential joy. Because that is all this song is: strong, euphoric joy. Where it really gets me, however, is the liminal feeling the more quiet sections lend to the song, that first verse of poetry is so stunningly sweet I want to bite it. No song represents that album cover more than this absolutely stunning track.

**TiltControls** (10): Opening with the best I see.

**violet** (10): she slayed marching bandcore like

**waluigiest** (10): i love a lush song. What a joy

**welcome2thejam** (10): Show me what those horns do

**afs** (9.5): not jbrekkie embracing her dinner persona

**homestarguy** (9.5): OHHHHHHHHHHH IT’S A RUSH :)

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): thinking about ddr and I both rave.dj'ing this with can we dance

**bo\_g\_o** (9): it is indeed a rush

**frogaranaman** (9): when I saw her live (one of her first sets back, a festival), she forgot the second chorus and then someone in the front yelled it so loud that she got so happy and started happy laughing. so she was just laughing and smashing the cymbal as hard as she could and it made the vibe of the show SOOOOOO FUN for the rest of it

**jay?** (9): gagged why lie

**n1colas valentine stan** (9): “People are saying paprika… paprika is good, but, no. Come on. It doesn’t taste like anything” - Mica and Matt from Magdalena Bay, 2022.

**ReallyCreative** (9): I think I'm a little cooler on this one than most, but it is an EXCELLENT opener. The trumpets really setting the tone that this album is straight outta Hoenn.

**steamedasparagus** (9): I would die for you Michelle

**vayyiqra** (9): Yes I have said this song is overrated; yes I am giving it a 9; we exist, we are valid. I will never understand why so many of her fans seem to think is the The Single Greatest Song ever, or at least that she has ever done, but it is fun and a good opener. Quirky, even. It really does capture well the weirdly specific vibe of the deranged parade of animals in the dream world of the anime movie Paprika, you know? I have to say that. And it is a good song. (But the next one is better idc idc)

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): it’s a nice ode to performing and song writing

**synyyy** (8.5): Clown music, but meant to be music!

**Awkward\_King** (8): i love how lush this song sounds, it truly sounds like a celebratory parade, it sounds triumphant and joyous and uplifting

Stryxen: **breadcrumbs6969** (7.5): cute but nothing special

**runaway3212** (7.5): paprikas actually so overrated, tomatoes >>>

**akanewasright** (7): …okay like this song is *good*, it’s a solid opener, but I do not get the ravenous praise it gets. Like ig I’m missing that indie gene or something, but go enjoy your gong filled joy while I sulk in the corner

**apatel27** (7): The movie was better

**Arybeck67** (7): a very emotionally accurate song, especially the line "All alone, I feel so much"

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i keep thinking this won indieheads ult for some reason

**qazz23** (7): I like the horns, though it's a bit too polished

**quinnpsych** (7): I personally don't get that much of the hype behind this song. It's always been rated the best song on the album, but something about it I just don't completely connect with. I think it's the drum line which feels a little bit like a march for me. I still really enjoy it, it's very overwhelming sonically

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Oh god oh fuck oh no those horns are giving me Phoebe-reated PTSD

#paprika?? i barely even know her!

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): it’s a decent opener, but as a track is gets outdone like seven times over the course of the album. idk, i don’t dislike it, but it’s never been a standout to me personally

**fadedblue09** (6.5): reminds me a lot of Kyoto

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): is it actually a good song or does it just have horns

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): It feels…just okay.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): I want to like this more, but I guess I don't quite feel like I'm in the center of magic.

Stryxen: So... top 2

We have Lucy Dacus - Hot & Heavy and Japanese Breakfast - Be Sweet... and we have a little reveal surprise planned. Anyway two favourites, one a lot more favourite than the other - but both have been flip-flopping alongside Paprika for the win. But who snatched it in the final few ballots?

**Stryxen** (11): Honestly… I couldn’t even begin to explain my love for this song… but I SHALL try! It started when I was the one to post this to popheads, and even though it wasn’t love at first listen, I have always liked this song! To be honest I didn’t really care for this Lucy era at first, it came out when I didn’t have much time or energy for music, so even though I adore Lucy, and Night Shift is in my top 10 songs of all time, this entire album managed to escape my listening cycle for a good while. 

I knew this was my 11 when I went to stay in my hometown roughly 2 months ago, and I needed to go back into my small little hometown for a week and revisit a lot of pain from the past - I put this song on once just because it felt fitting, and then listened to it for roughly 4 days straight. This song is pure nostalgia tinged with loving regret and regretful love. The strongest emotions you can possibly feel that make you uncomfortable and embarrassingly flushed, but so cathartically that you’ll chase the feeling.

And then I saw Lucy live. This song. Is. An ANTHEM. I’m simply so proud of how it performed, I knew it was a top 10 lock but WOW? TOP 2! We did it! This was even winning at around ballots #80-#100, and for a while was the ONLY song that could compete with Be Sweet. I do obviously wish this song could have won, equally for my love and for the gag. DAY 2 ALL STARS HERE WE COME!!!!.

#Hot & Heavy

**CrimsonROSET** (11): Is it a boring choice in a rate where I commented how other songs are boring winner choices? Yes, but you didn’t see it!

**IIIHenryIII** (11): that's what she said

**MassiveThief** (11): oh it's good. REAL good. the way her voice bends on "you wanted me to beeeend the rules" is a top tier moment.

**shhhneak** (11): IT’S BITTERSWEET TO SEE YOU AGAIN

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): I wouldn't call this an emphatic 11… Like, I didn’t come into this rate like “Aww yeah I’m definitely 11-ing this song!!” This album (and rate oop) just had 3 perfect songs and this happened to be the one that I liked the most. It gets you into a mood man. Makes you miss the past, even if in reality it wasn’t as good as you remember.

**2dina3dworld** (10): so there’s this local radio station here that plays “the hottest indie from all over the world”, and my friend's dad listens to it. Through listening to this station, he discovered Lucy Dacus’s Hot & Heavy, and started listening to it and recommending it to my friend. My friend told me this and it kinda pissed me off because firstly, when your friend's parents get into something it makes it not that cool, and second, this is a song about escaping your hometown and the repression within it. He pretty much chased his other kid out of our hometown by being allegedly terrible, and sees no problem with his own backwards attitude. The point of this song went so far over his head that it’s probably still rocketing upwards outside the atmosphere.

**apatel27** (10): big mood

**Arybeck67** (10): this song kinda narrates where I'm at in life, looking back on everything and still being able to move forward while empathizing with my past self. The Bruce Springsteen-esque production just elevates the track.

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I love this song, it really brings back memories of my teen crushes

**bespectacIed** (10): What a spectacular song. I find it amusing to note that this is kinda the antithesis of another song in this rate, Kokomo, ID wherien the protag is now the one going back to a hometown and re-meeting someone after a long time, instead of the one stuck in a hometown longing for someone to come back. The storytelling here is so compelling, i felt the pain of seeing someone you've grown apart with and them being happy, so now you're happy too but in a wistful way... 10/10 opener

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Take me to the universe where we all just wear the same cozy hoodie.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): this song really captures a feeling of returning to a place you spent a lot of time at and have a lot of nostalgia for and reminiscing on past memories, and while I haven't really experienced this before, I still find it incredibly moving.

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): sounds really nostalgic and i love that, the switches are really interesting and it's the second best opener in the rate

**daybed** (10): Lucy is one of the best lyricists of recent years such a well written song in every single way

**GapeCod** (10): Hearing "underestimated and overprotected" for the first time morphed me into a puddle of tears.. So true. Except I am in fact overestimated.

**gimmeyotacos** (10): as soon as lucy sang “the best that I could give to you was nothing at all / the best that I could offer was to mess your calls,” i knew that this album would ruin me

**homestarguy** (10): One of the best opening tracks of the year, this song has it all. Sweet, nostalgic subject-matter, a verse that takes some lovely twists and turns in the second half, and that GLORIOUS “War on Drugs”-esque outro. Perfect song.

**jman457** (10): great way to start an album, gives huge main character energy

**kappyko** (10): the springsteenification of indie rock is kinda annoying but this rules

**Mudkip1** (10): another 11 candidate. Obsessed with this

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): this song and a blunt

**quinnpsych** (10): Ugh speaking of euphoria and nostalgia, hot and heavy is that bitch when it comes to nostalgia. just when it fades into the piano towards the end of the song, i love

**runaway3212** (10): slay opener

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): can I just loop this 10 more times?

**throwaway-7650** (10): the last minute is the rush TXT was referencing in blue hour

**TiltControls** (10): this song makes me feel

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): perfect mix of levity and melancholy

**UselessTacooo** (10): One thing all these albums have in common are genuinely perfect intros.

**waluigiest** (10): such a perfect thesis for the album. It really sets up the nostalgic discomfort

**welcome2thejam** (10): Listening to this alone in my room on my birthday was a bad choice

**xxipil0ts** (10): - Her best single for this era, tbh. I can't believe she unearthed every resentment I had. I hate her for it. Lover her tho xx

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): me when I'm running on a treadmill

**akanewasright** (9.5): man… she’s really that vivid of a writer/storyteller huh?

**therokinrolla** (9.5): "Now you're a firecracker on a crowded street" just sounds so satisfying. The explosion of power at the end, the sparking of the flame, what an opener.

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**Awkward\_King** (9): lucy why are you making me feel this i dont want to feel this

**fadedblue09** (9): Starting off this album strong EDIT: Wow this album literally peaked here and went downhill after quick huh

**imbaby122** (9): bro why do these songs keep hitting me with nostalgia i don’t need to be reminded of how much i miss living with my mommy

**NewAccountNow** (9): sets the albums tone

**plastichaxan** (9): the title omg that’s so me

**synyyy** (9): That drum beat reminds me of Less Than Zero. That being said, stream Less Than Zero.

**violet** (9): this song is like a firecracker on a crowded street

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): queen at having a great intro and then making a disappointing rest of the album

**DefaultPophead** (8): The song kinda goes on in an unpleasant way, but it's still nice. She's a great songwriter, but this is far from the best song on the album sonically or lyrically. I can't feel myself rating it any lower even though it pales in comparison to the next few songs.

**frogaranaman** (8): this song was def written about me (Lucy has no idea I exist)

**jay?** (8): gag

**reput4tionera** (8): this song is so fun

**steamedasparagus** (8): ha gayyyyy

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): gives coming of age movie

**qazz23** (7): like the upbeat sound of this

**vayyiqra** (7): I was told everyone loves this song upon hearing it the first time. I think this is the second time I am hearing it. It's pretty good I guess. idk

#Cold & Light

**BasedButta** (6.5): pleasant i guess

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): im really starting to thinking doing this rate was a bad idea

#omg jessie ware hi!!

**ACORGIORGY** (10): Both Lucy and Jessie Ware have proven that this title automatically makes for a great song.

**hikkaru** (10): she and jessie ware both ate with 2021 songs called hot & heavy

**afs** (9): I wanna listen to Jessie Ware

**ReallyCreative** (9): a good year for songs with this title

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): jessie ware YOU'RE DONE!!!!

**just\_thonking** (8): Jessie Ware outsold but this bops

**SmileAndTears** (8): Jessie Ware outsold

Stryxen: An adorable album. I have gone on and on about its concept and how masterfully its executed, but I really need to make it known. This album is flawless, not a single moment is out of place or doesn’t contribute to the rich history and complex personality woven throughout the tracklist. Also Kissing Lessons raised the album average by like 0.005 lol.

Very pleased that this was realistically the only album in the rate that gave Jubilee a run for its money in the top 10, when it’s the one I fought tooth and nail in the discord to have included. And I’m just so proud of Lucy! I love her so much, let’s show her support next time we rate her in BOYGENIUS RATE.

**majid** (9.692): this is one of my favourite albums of 2021 alongside jubilee

**bespectacIed** (9.667): Of all four albums in this rate, this one is my personal, biased favorite (hmmm ok maybe neck and neck with Jollibee). As the undisputed best member of boygenius, Lucy didn't disappoint me with her deeply impactful, straight to the bone songwriting in this follow up to Historian. The way she captured nostalgia, trauma, and coming-of-age here is so damn beautiful, I felt like I, myself was revisiting my own past through her lyrics

**wailord\_fan** (9.500): I was listening through this album a lot during the peak of a relationship, and subsequent breakup.

**camerinian** (9.333): please refer to the literal 5300 words I wrote about this album for the sub in January

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.292): She deserved the PHCJ header, a missed cultural opportunity

**IIIHenryIII** (9.225): This is such a great album. I still can't believe how no one ever came up with this concept before. It's brilliant. Lucy is brilliant. On a side note, I feel like I should give all of these tracks a 10, but then I think some of them didn't quite get there.
[/r/popheads/comments/uvd4s7/2021_indie_girls_rate_reveal_day_3_its_a_triple/i9l90p9/]

=====

Stryxen: **throwaway-7650** (9.200): one of my AOTYs last year and I still underrated it. smh

**bo\_g\_o** (9.083): while this album doesn't ever quite come close to the perfection that is night shift, overall I'd say that it's still a stronger album. Lucy's writing is brutally honest and cuts you to the core, making you feel every single emotion she feels, and it's an amazing experience.

**kappyko** (9.000): Actually very good

**apatel27** (8.833): Didn't expect to hit as personally as it did

**2dina3dworld** (8.708): this album. Wow. There’s a lot to say about it, and I don’t know where to start. I grew up in a small town, and this resonates because you see so many of the stories Lucy tells reflected in the people around you. Mostly, I see the themes of Home Video, of intergenerational trauma, repressive conservatism and pain reflected in the people closest to me. Lucy’s lyrics are incredibly accurate to the international small experience that even a New Zealander like me can relate to and paint the picture of the scene she sets in my head. Some of the songs are a bit samey or not very interesting instrumentally, but the lyrical themes more than make up for it.

**plastichaxan** (8.650): This is such a grower, I’m sorry I ever called you boring Lucy I wasn’t paying attention to anything or maybe just needed to suffer a bit more before I could appreciate how good this but in the end I did purrr

**CrimsonROSET** (8.583): ‘oh so you called jubilee boring but this is what you like?’ Well this album didn’t trick me with upbeat bops! It has always been sad girl music on the forefront and sometimes it picks up a bit but it always focuses on being sad!

**afs** (8.583): premium Conan Gray!!!

**celladonn** (8.542): Definitely one of my favourite albums of last year, we love lyrics we love storytelling

**gimmeyotacos** (8.500): wow the highs on this album are VERY high. i saw lucy perform in august of last year in brooklyn. it was my first live concert since 2019 and i believe it was her first solo live show since the pandemic had started. when she performed thumbs, it was so quiet you most likely could hear a pin drop. she performed a sufjan cover with tomberlin. and she ended the show with night shift where everyone was screaming the lyrics and i felt a catharsis that i hadn't felt in years. anyways, i'm kinda rambling and this anecdote is kinda getting off-topic but i guess what i wanna say is lucy is such an incredible singer-songwriter and she never fails to make feel all the feels

**GapeCod** (8.500): Honestly, this album is waaaaaaaay too tragic for this rate, and for any rate at all tbh.. Like, I love it to hell and back, but it's such an emotional struggle to listen to for an activity that's supposed to be fun.

**frogaranaman** (8.417): great album to hate the Catholic Church to

**therokinrolla** (8.375): The most gripping album is easily by one of the most gripping voices in all of music. Her lyricism is paralleled by very few artists, and I would consider it echelons above her peers (even perhaps other members of bands of which she may be a part of). This album expands the universe of the voice she introduced in her first two albums: emotional intensity is often paired by her humor, wit, and penchant for sarcasm and irony. And, unlike Historian, she isn't just learning anymore, she has learned, and presents her findings to us in songs like First Time and VBS. Sadly, not every song hits well musically, with some of the songs perhaps working better as slam poetry than actual songs eyes Christine and Partner In Crime. But the Lucy Dacus Lyrical Universe is too compelling to write off the songs completely regardless, I listen just to hear her through that shoe at the alter, or her talk about how she doesn't drink coffee. At her best, she makes some of the best contemporary indie rock full stop. At her worst, she is engaging and profound.

**n1colas valentine stan** (8.375): A triple dog dare, a triple dog dare, A triple dog dare, a triple dog dare, A triple dog dare, a triple dog dare, A triple dog dare, a triple dog dare, A triple dog dare, a triple dog dare, A triple dog dare, a triple dog dare, A triple dog dare, a triple dog dare, A triple dog dare, A tri- [GUNSHOTS]

**jman457** (8.350): Ok this album surprised me a lot, I was worried it was gonna be a repete of punisher; which i felt as a whole felt like a chore to sit through as a whole despite not really having bad songs

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.333): Ah, the whole reason I’m doing this rate. I was so scared to listen to this at first, since it was fresh after the disappointment I experienced listening to Punisher for the first time. But GOD was I glad I did it, cause I connected to this album and to Lucy in ways I never thought possible, and her writing style was something I understood and fell in love with instantly. Whereas Phoebe prefers to write rambling thoughts, extensive metaphors, and non-sequiturs, Lucy is able to stay in the small spaces of her songs and laser focus on her topics while still weaving the little details, inner emotions and relatable awkwardness into a beautiful tapestry. I don’t think any album I’ve ever listened to has spoken to me as directly as Home Video has. And not to keep comparing these two but, you know, for all the praise Phoebs gets for being a queer icon, Punisher never struck me as that gay of an album. But the same can’t be said of Home Video. Queerness is in its blood and in a lot of the heavy topics it discusses. I may not be exactly like Lucy (she’s a bi/pan girl and I’m a gay guy) but I understood every little thing she said right down to my core. I’ve been there. I’ve lived a lot of it. I can sympathize with her, and when I hear her sweet and welcoming voice through my headphones, it feels like she sympathizes with me. This album sounds like a warm hug. tl;dr: she just like me, she just like me fr

=====

Stryxen: **welcome2thejam** (8.250): Lucy does such an incredible job of bringing you into the stories she's telling. Even if the sound of Snail Mail or JBrekkie appeal more to me, hard to deny her talent: possibly my favorite songwriting across the four albums

**steamedasparagus** (8.125): one time I recommended her a book on instagram

**BeauMeringue212** (8.117): I've always enjoyed how cinematic and diaristic this album. Lucy really recreated the feeling of being in your teens and struggling through intense love and friendships

**shhhneak** (8.108): What a great queer coming of age anthology.

**bridgemoney** (8.083): There's a few great songs here, but most of it was just generally enjoyable and not much else. I appreciate the strong lyrics, but I wasn't that engaged with the childhood stories Lucy was telling other than Brando and Triple Dog Dare. We need a full boygenius album ASAP.

**imbaby122** (8.083): unsurprisingly i have a lot of lgbt friends who are obsessed with lucy dacus and boygenius and recommended this album to me. going in i only knew night shift, which sets the expectation pretty high, and i was impressed with home video. i think lucy is the best lyricist on this roster, and even when the production is a bit blah, the lyrics and delivery often make up for it. i playlisted almost all of the songs, and i definitely plan on diving into the rest of lucy’s discography.

**musical\_pyn** (8.083): My favorite lyrics out of any of the albums in this rate, Lucy Dacus is just an incredible songwriter

**TiltControls** (7.917): Still regretting not discovering Hot & Heavy and Triple Dog Dare until two days after the best tracks of 2021 submissions. Anyways this is my fave of the 4 and would be over 8 if Kissing Lessons weren't here too

**RandomHypnotica** (7.842): The only album I was unfamiliar with going into the rate, and I was kind of let down unfortunately. Most of the singles are great, and there is certainly some great lyricism on here, but idk... i hate to say this, but most of these songs just make me want to listen to a Phoebe song instead 💀

**NewAccountNow** (7.750): second best third of BoyGenius delivered, y’all know number 1

**breadcrumbs6969** (7.625): didn't really enjoy this one, it was very diary like and confessional and while i do like personal details it almost felt like someone going on and on and on about their life for forty minutes

**skargardin** (7.583): Her songwriting on this album is obviously amazing throughout. Her ability to tell a story is so poignant and beautiful. Not everything on this album hits for me, but when it does, it really hits.

**ktajlili** (7.500): I wasn't expecting to like this as much as I did based on previous songs that I've heard. Hot & Heavy is an okay single, but I don't think it represents Home Video's nostalgic and story-driven songwriting all that well. I still like the song, but it's a bit basic. There are so many great songs, and with the exception of Partner and Crime, it all fits together really well. I love how it centers around figures of her childhood. She really conveys the themes of sexuality, queerness, and religion with specificity. I find the production a bit boring sometimes but I like the songwriting.

**just\_thonking** (7.208): Very strong storytelling but a bit b*ring at times

**cremeebrulee** (7.167): lucy's storytelling abilities are really excellent but sometimes it just feels like i'm listening to a friend talk and not quite a song. which can be nice but it makes it more difficult to relisten casually. i think while i liked roughly the same amount of songs from this that i did from historian, there's no one standout from it so i think i still prefer historian. i did like the concept of this album a lot though, it's a very honest way of approaching nostalgia which is not an easy thing to do.

**SmileAndTears** (7.067): I find Lucy Dacus to be a very uninteresting singer. Her voice is smooth and soothing but also extremely monotone. She makes it work on songs like Thumbs because the song is supposed to sound cold and emotionless (ironically that’s also where she is at her most emotive) but on the rest of the album she has to rely on production to keep things interesting and it doesn’t always work…

**Posing-With-Fishes** (6.750): I appreciate the lyricism, I really do, but this was a slog

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.750): this album just doesn’t click for me, maybe because I don’t really pay attention to lyrics

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.708): i liked it a lot more than i expected tbh. im gonna blame popheadscirclejerk for that

**MassiveThief** (6.625): Somewhat hit or miss. a few great songs, some good, but a fair amount of meh/filler. Definitely runs out of steam halfway.

**vayyiqra** (6.583): Well then. I've tried to get into this Boygenius cinematic universe of artists. I've listened to their albums several times, hoping they will click. So far, they haven't really. Historian is probably my favourite of them, though. I didn't listen to this album before this rate though - why? It's silly. I have this weird, niche phobia of distorted faces, and the ghosting effect on her face on the cover bothers me. (Shaking, crying, throwing up, you know how the meme goes.) I know, that must seem like an absurd reason to not listen to an album. I guess I also didn't expect to love it either though, since this genre of indie rock so beloved by zoomers is not my thing. I have thought about it and decided that while I can appreciate the lyricism, the music itself is the barrier here. But this was an enjoyable enough listen. Lucy is a good songwriter; it's just not my thing. I promise I tried to be fair to it though.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.550): 0/10 no night shift

**oscarbrierley1** (6.042): a real mixed bag, some great moments and some awful moments.

**qazz23** (5.833): some good tracks here but not as good as Historian, wish there was more variety

**fadedblue09** (5.042): I find this album quite disappointing, especially with such a strong opener and the premise seemed to intrigue me a lot. I was not fond of her vocals and production choices, which just deterred my attempts to emotionally connect with the record, and the album rarely strays away from the indie-folk formula barring a few exceptions.

**My tasteless friend Emilie** (4.500): slow

**BasedButta** (4.250): not my style at all. stupid talk-singing with annoying lyrics, drivers license the album, i hated it. maybe it’s an album problem though, because kissing lessons was pretty good

**Stryxen** (10): A more than deserving winner! It was surprisingly close the majority of the rate, with Paprika with raw 11 power first taking the lead, followed by Posing in Bondage with initial lack of controversy, and then Hot & Heavy (by virtue of avoiding contrarian JBrekkie tanking), but Be Sweet’s lush instrumental and evocative emotional vocals helped this raters’ favourite slowly and steadily take the lead. I feel very privileged to crown this masterpiece into the popheads hall of fame and I can’t wait to give it yet another 10 in Winners’ Rate 3!

---

#Sweet!

**akanewasright** (11): The way I heard this and dropped everything to stan

**endcreditouilles** (11): she spilled when she said to tell the men to count their days

**homestarguy** (11): I singlehandedly lost my falsetto last year belting this song in the car, I think. For that honor, it deserves my 11. It’s a perfect song and I will not apologize!!!

**ktajlili** (11): Pop perfection, truly

**Mudkip1** (11): this is the best song ever made

**rotating3Dtext** (11): it has a simlish version, what more do you need

**vayyiqra** (11): The perfect new wave song was written in 2021. Really. I can picture the garish video this would have if it had been made back then. Every detail is perfect, the sound of the synths, the cheesy backing vocals, the random "woo!" near the end (I love when songs do that, don't ask why). This is a banger, and the relatable content I come here for. Like I was saying in my album comment, this album has a lot of themes I think you can't quite get the same way unless you are Old like me and have had a very serious and long relationship that you regret ended the way it did and I'd better stop now I'm oversharing. [Part of comment redacted; you don't need to know more] It brings up pain. But it's pain I can BOP to and that's the important thing.

**violet** (11): this song is too sweet to not give it my highest score.

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**ACORGIORGY** (10): I assume this will deservedly win the rate. This chorus is unfuckwithable.

**Awkward\_King** (10): what a perfect pop song, this is a predictable winner but god i hope it does win because it fucking deserves

**bespectacIed** (10): Hello rate winner, most probably. And it'll be deserved. The embodiment of the 2012 overly attached girlfriend meme being the consensus indie favorite song of 2021? Maybe feminism won.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Suck it, indieheads. Perfect song.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): there's this one person who's a prominent user on indieheads who hates this song and calls it walgreenscore, and while it does kinda sound like pharmacy music it is still a monster of a bop and hating it is a SIN and TASTELESS

**celladonn** (10): she really hit the slay button here

**chidi\_ariana\_grande** (10): Oh so this what being happy feels like

**cremeebrulee** (10): it’s gonna be a little funny when this wins because this is 100% a pop song… but it was THEE best pop song of 2021 so it absolutely deserves

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i understand how this won in popheads but that doesn’t suddenly make me happy about it

**daybed** (10): so lovely and just her voice mixes so well with an expensive instrumental, beautiful.

**frogaranaman** (10): my parents say the chorus sounds like a belting goat. and that's why it's good!!!

**hikkaru** (10): she got the pop gays (me) hook line and sinker with this one

**ignitethephoenix** (10): basic take but this is a great song

**IIIHenryIII** (10): this is the best song on the album, you can't deny it, don't be a contrarian (ok, Posing In Bondage might be slightly better)

**imbaby122** (10): banger. never heard a song even half as groovy as this one.

**jay?** (10): it gave why lie

**jman457** (10): The simlish version outsold a bit

**majid** (10): i do think this song is slightly overrated yet i can't help but give it a 10

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): i am going to be SO angry when this wins

**plastichaxan** (10): condragulations Raja ~~i hope~~

**RandomHypnotica** (10): While I wish anything else was gonna win this rate, I still can't bring myself to hate this, it's just pop excellence

**ReallyCreative** (10): me to my Dunkin iced coffee

**reput4tionera** (10): she was insane for this

**skargardin** (10): SMASH

**steamedasparagus** (10): I would die for you Michelle x2

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): She sounds so sweet but some of these lyrics are so threatening

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): so carefree-sounding, reminds me so much of last summer

**UselessTacooo** (10): This is just an incredible pop track. Not much more to say, because everything about it has already been said.

**wailord\_fan** (10): Overplayed? Maybe. Fantastic and utterly deserving of its eventual win? YUP YUP YUP.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Would be tempted to 11 the Simlish version

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): Could play this on loop! Another huge grower on this album.

**afs** (9.5): not jbrekkie embracing her dessert persona

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): Love the bassline and funky guitar, it might be h&m-core but it just works goddamit

**camerinian** (9.5): hello obvious but also deserving winner

**NewAccountNow** (9.5): great follow up

**2dina3dworld** (9): the 80s pastiche is overdone, and Be Sweet doesn’t do anything especially great or inventive with it, but it’s cute!

**Arybeck67** (9): one of the catchiest songs of the last year and honestly exactly how you feel when you want your partner to live up to your idealized view of them

**breadcrumbs6969** (9): really fun, love it

**synyyy** (9): I just searched her best songs according to popheads, so don't judge me

**throwaway-7650** (9): this song is good! but not rate winner good! tanking in winners 3

**waluigiest** (9): if there’s one thing I love it’s an upbeat song about being horrifically upset…. Time to cry in the club

**gimmeyotacos** (8.5): “caught up in my feelings, overthink the truth” girl, SAME

**just\_thonking** (8.5): after seeing this beat expectations in the indieheads rate I am very curious to see how it does here

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.5): why be sweet when Sour clearly outsold in AOTY 2021

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): i’ve cooled on this a bit since the single release, but it’s still a joy to have

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): good song but not the clear top 1 on this album too many people make it out to be

**oscarbrierley1** (8): catchy as hell

**quinnpsych** (8): Was one of the songs that got me into this album. I enjoy it, but has shrunk on me since the album came out. I love the verses and pre-chorus so much, but the chorus gets a little grating at times with the "beliieeeeeeeve". Idk might just be me lol. The guitar in the verses is unreal though. Now listening to it though it fuckin slaps

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It’s cool but if I must be honest the way she sings “I wanna be-LEEEVE” really annoys me

**sunsetb** (7.5): I wanna believe in a less nasal-y chorus

**cherryices** (7): i guess the plaintiveness of the vocals is kind of working here… still don’t love it

**Posing-With-Fishes** (7): look, it’s good and all but this is kind of boring

**SmileAndTears** (7): I’m sorry but her tone is so nasal here. That chorus is painful to listen to. A shame cuz the rest is pretty great

**TiltControls** (7): I wish I disliked this more cause I don't really want this to win but there's also not much really wrong with it as a song. it's just fine. and hopefully something better than fine can win

#and sour i’m sweet and sour sweet and sour i’m sweet and sour bitch!

**qazz23** (6): The chorus is good, prefer Paprika though

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): popheads will listen to the most 6 out of 10 synthpop song of all time and say this is the fourth best song of 2021

**apatel27** (4.5): Background at a roller rink vibes

**runaway3212** (0): I know this is supposed to be the rate winner but my goodness she sounds sore when she sings "I wanna beLIEVE" which is a problem with the entire album but here specifically it becomes a problem

# Jubilee

---

**Overall Average**: 8.316 **// Average Controversy:** 1.692

---

Stryxen: Rating this album was quite hard. And hosting these results was quite a lot to witness. Jubilee is one of my favourite albums of all time - I don’t think I would be quite the same person if this album wasn’t released this time last year, it was exactly what I needed to hear. I did not believe joy could exist through grief and loss, Jubilee showed me I didn’t need to. From the magical marching sounds of Paprika, the infectious glee of Be Sweet, Slide Tackle and Savage Good Boy, and the wistful longing of Kokomo IN and Tactics to the regretful despair of Posing For Cars and In Hell, and the swelling feeling of abandonment in Sit and Posing In Bondage. This is a flawless album, a true 10/10 to me. I rated it… not like that… for results that would reflect my love for the other 3 albums, but numerical scores can never truly reflect the power of art, and Japanese Breakfast is an artist. Michelle Zauner… you will ALWAYS be famous. Stream [some of](https://open.spotify.com/track/6fyMExLM9mmtXAQKCnTaZG?si=282491bf43e842e1) [her loose singles](https://open.spotify.com/track/2OZXdq8Z8pyvGWDnzhHFEX?si=f4df3f2436494542) and [the bumper EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/3aq7whJpYQjC5m2GGENivF?si=rO9mTVOISsGaffPBWhwxJQ) if you want more dreamy or synthy masterpieces - she cannot release a bad song, and her first two albums are flawless too!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10.100): I don't think I could find a flaw in this album if I tried, every one of these songs has been my favorite at some point and

**plastichaxan** (10.100): My God this is one of my favorite albums of all time, every song hits too hard, I haven’t gotten tired of listening over and over. Every lyric, everything done here just gets to me and everytime I listen to the album I catch on to something or just enjoy it (in a music sense cause this is sad af) and just wow I love her so much

**majid** (9.900): best album of 2021 no it's true

**bespectacIed** (9.600): Perfectly named, flawlessly executed album. More than the pristine 80s soft pop production, It cannot be overstated how amazing the songwriting in this album is. Smart, witty, effective use of metaphors and double entendres, but still grounded and unmistakeably jbrekkie. I will throw hands and feet to anyone who says this is overrated, this deserved every bit of flowers and more, she IS the moment

**vayyiqra** (9.400): I was planning to low-effort this rate and only write comments for this album because I'm in a hurry (my own doing) but didn't because I'm a perfectionist. I could have easily done that though if I felt like it without even hearing the album. That's because I love this album. It is the only one in the rate I'd heard more than once - as of writing this, it looks like I've played it front to back well over 50 times. It never gets old at all, because it's great. I would even say it was my favourite album of last year. The songwriting is masterful and the lyrics connected with me in a way a lot of the songs in this rate didn't. I think this might be since I'm coming from a kind of similar place to Michelle Zauner here, weirdly enough. This feels absurd to say because I am definitely not a Korean woman. However I'm about the same age as her and in that weird stage of adulthood where you're not in your 20s and not "young" anymore but also not middle-aged and it's kind of confusing. Your parents are getting old now though and you have to worry about them dying someday, pets are dying, there's thoughts of marriage, you have a career or are supposed to, and your own mental health to take care of too. It's what we call A Lot and I wouldn't expect our younger members to identify with this stuff the same way - that's normal, it's just a different stage of life. You have your own problems at that age, which I've already gone through. But this album just hits on a personal level for me and also, to be blunt it's got a lot of bangers. I liked Soft Sounds but this is next level shit. Thank you for making the soundtrack to my summer depression, Michelle Zauner, and making it bop too.

**SFbby** (9.400): Can I give every song on this album a 10 please? There's something special about this album and the way it tackles the bittersweet passage of life. Also if you haven't already go read Crying in H mart and go to Hmart to see Michelle Zauner do a cooking show on the tvs.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.370): michelle zauner, i have been extremely happy to witness all your success. now please be my friend

**imbaby122** (9.350): one of my favorite albums of all time. it helps that most of the songs are very relatable to my personal experiences, but mostly i’m just impressed with how every song sounds like the feelings that the lyrics convey. it makes the songs that much more emotionally impactful, they tell immersive stories. such a special and unique album, michelle is an incredible lyricist and vocalist and i’m so glad she brought this album into the world.

**welcome2thejam** (9.300): Maybe it safely treads some well-worn ground sonically, which keeps it from being the top of the top-tier. But for me, this might be one of the most consistent albums I'll ever hear, basically every track works for me on some level. Will visit Jubilee again and again in the future.

**afs** (9.250): most perfect album of all time that isn't from gaga

**bulforster** (9.220): These other albums have the unfortunate fate of being matched against what has become one of my favourite albums ever.

**BeauMeringue212** (9.000): One of my favourite albums last year. It's such a great balance of indie pop rock and dream pop, and I'm so glad to have come across it and discover the band.

**throwaway-7650** (8.950): one of my AOTYs last year and I can't hate its domination tbh

**synyyy** (8.950): It seems our friend has now become fitter, happier and more productive. No thanks to popheads.

**bo\_g\_o** (8.850): love it, every time I listen to this it just puts a smile on my face

**kappyko** (8.800): She slayed I fear

**skargardin** (8.800): For being an album about joy, she still managed to keep its themes really complex, and I can appreciate that. I think that's my favourite aspect of this album, and the production of course which is stellar.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.800): I love this album. Everything about it is so mesmerizing.

**bridgemoney** (8.750): I like Jbrekkie going for a bigger sound than her previous two albums. Horns in indie music just make anything sound ten times better. Glad she's finally at a point in her life where she can make songs about joy and happiness.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.750): One of the few albums I listened to the moment it dropped, I thought it was pretty good but was ultimately unswayed by the hype. Revisiting it unveiled a first half being some of the most vibrant and grasping songs of Japanese Breakfast's catalogue with the second being mostly a tad forgettable before being salvaged by Posing in Cars. Overall, a pretty great collection of songs. 8/10

**gimmeyotacos** (8.740): best album of 2021! this album really is something special. the way michelle explores joy in all its forms is fascinating. i genuinely think i could listen to this once a day for a year and still never get bored of it

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.680): i had never listened to this album in full but i really liked it and see myself revisiting it again

**cremeebrulee** (8.680): i did the AOTY writeup for this so there’s very little i can say that i already haven’t, but this album is so warm, inviting, healing, and just plain magical. i’m so happy to see it get its flowers on the sub and with the general public, it’s growing to be one of my favorite bodies of work ever. i’m far from happy irl but for the duration of this i can pretend <3

**steamedasparagus** (8.550): When I saw her in concert someone gave her a watermelon and she danced with it

**camerinian** (8.500): i would honestly be happy with this album being twice as long as it is. Not everything here works all the way through but there’s just a lot of potential that I kinda want to hear what else Michelle is thinking of doing with her music. I’m perched very excited to see what she does next after this

Stryxen: **shhhneak** (8.470): That’s my GRAMMY award winning best new artist.

**musical\_pyn** (8.400): this is probably my favorite album in the rate (and my favorite album of 2021...) but I'm realizing the individual tracks are not as strong on their own. Still an incredible album with some incredible lyrics.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.370): :persimmon:

**jman457** (8.360): A definite album of the year contender for me just pure bliss, even if I feel it gets weak in the second half of it

**breadcrumbs6969** (8.350): to me this was unfortunately the most forgettable album, i can't recall what half of the tracks sound like or what they're about, but i mostly enjoy it while listening

**thisusernameisntlong** (8.300): this album is so good to revisit because it’s always better than I remember

**2dina3dworld** (8.300): so, this was my top album of 2021. For some reason, the more I listen to something, the harder it gets for me to vocalise why I do or don’t like it. I think what hooked me on Jubilee is that it’s a very ethereal album. The instrumentals are often quite light and lilting, with many small details to pick apart within the songs themselves without being overwhelming or cluttered. The songs on the first half are all memorable and super strong songs on their own, and the second half is alright I guess. But sometimes an album you can listen to, in many different spaces and moods, and not get sick of any of it.

**just\_thonking** (8.150): A grower

**celladonn** (8.150): The rumours are true... Miss Breakfast made a very good album

**NewAccountNow** (8.100): i dont have to words to describe how much i love this album, might end up being an all time of mine.

**BasedButta** (8.050): I knew one song from them before this rate (Paprika) and took it as a lucky shot but they are just that good, they’ve earned themselves a new fan. I normally have low scores in rates but I just don’t have the courage to give them anything too low, even when I don’t vibe with the song I can just hear the layers and passion, everything is so concise and well made…

**TiltControls** (7.900): The favourite to win, but I kinda hope someone else can pull it off. (Or at least give it to Paprika!)

**SmileAndTears** (7.890): This was better than I remember, and I think the album definitely gets better with more listens.

**n1colas valentine stan** (7.550): JAPANESE THREE COURSE MEAL JUBILEE DEVOURED

**frogaranaman** (7.400): live show Good

**RandomHypnotica** (7.370): I'd listened to this album a few times last year, really trying to like it, but never quite getting there. However, listening to it for this rate, something was different, and it just finally clicked for me. I still do think it's a tad overrated, but it well and truly deserves it's spot here

**fadedblue09** (7.150): I only heard this album for this rate, but I get why it’s by far the most popular album here. The album offers a diverse but cohesive set of sounds, emotional songwriting and a pop sensibility that shines amidst the indie elements that tend to unnecessarily obscure a lot of albums of its kind.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.100): it's a really well constructed album, but some of the vocal choices are strange to me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.500): At the risk of getting crucified for speaking ill of popheads’ indie darling of the year, I’m just gonna say it’s a cute album but not for me and leave it at that

**qazz23** (6.500): some good stuff but it seemed too polished at times

**CrimsonROSET** (5.900): I’m sorry, I wish I could like this- but like at some point all the songs just sound the same.

**apatel27** (5.700): It just doesn't hit like Psychopomp or Soft Sounds did

**My tasteless friend Emilie** (5.700): be sweet carried

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.500): i dont think i’ve ever understood the appeal of an album less than this one

**MassiveThief** (5.300): yyeaahhh I'm not a fan. The upbeat tracks are fine, but the slower ones just lack anything interesting imo. Everything outside of the first four tracks is super forgettable, and even those first four are just pretty good.

TiltControls: Amazing job to Alex and Benji for hosting this! Missed the first few days unfortunately, but day 3 was fantastic and it sounded like a great time! (Forever was still robbed though)

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

##**Songs**

Congrats to **Be Sweet** for the win today! Be Sweet becomes the **172nd** highest rated song of all time. It sits below Lily Allen's The Fear and Clean Bandit & Jess Glynne's Rather Be (the two are tied) and just above Katy Perry's Teenage Dream (from last year's 2010 Ult). It also becomes 1 of 23 rate winners to win with a 0 attached (Introvert, Damn Daniel and Blinding Lights were the most recent 3 to get that distinction)

For the score placement of the other two 9+ tracks

* Hot & Heavy: **233rd**
 * In terms of score Hot & Heavy also ties with Demi Lovato's Don't Forget and Stevie Wonder's Higher Ground

* Paprika: **250th**
 * Paprika also just barely misses the leaderboard for most 11's (20 are needed for a spot)

##**Artists**

Note that while all 4 artists are new to the board, Japanese Breakfast and Snail Mail have previous scores influencing their placement with Machinist and Heat Wave respectively

* 32nd: Björk (+0.004 points)
* **33rd: Japanese Breakfast** (New)
* 34th: D'Angelo (-0.002 points)

-

* 56th: Little Simz (+0.004 points)
* **57th: Lucy Dacus** (New)
* 58th: Quay Dash (-0.001 point)

-

* 64th: Q-Tip (+0.024 points)
* **65th: Wolf Alice** (New)
* 66th: Green Day (-0.002 points)

-

* 175th: Master P / Troye Sivan (+0.009 points)
* **177th: Snail Mail** (New)
* 177th: KAYTRANADA (Tied)
* 179th: Lady Gaga (-0.006 points)

-

##**Albums**

**Jubilee** just barely sneaks onto the leaderboard at #25 for highest averages! It knocks Fetch the Bolt Cutters off the board.

**Blue Weekend** is the only other album to set a record (and not for earliest exit! Getting top 10 avoids them of that fate). They actually have the 8th highest 11 spread for the album across all rates, with every song except No Hard Feelings picking at least 1 up! 

##**Rates**

No records today, but the rate becomes the 27th most participated rate ever!
