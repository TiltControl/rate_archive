https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/uu48pr/2021_indie_girls_rate_reveal_day_1_snail_mail_is/

#HELLO RATERS

It’s day 1 of the biggest rate of all time, the 2021 Women of Indie Rock rate or “Indie Girl acclaim” for short. You can see the announcement and discussion post [here](https://redd.it/tuma9v)

This weekend we shall be revealing the songs we rated from four of the most acclaimed indie albums of 2021, from lowest to highest average and today we’re revealing #43-#29 **starting at 3PM EST** or roughly 45 minutes from when this is posted.

###SOME STATS:

Number of participants: [121](https://pastebin.com/ediurfg5)

Average score: 7.879 (i’d say that’s… pretty high!)

Average controversy score: 1.736 (i don’t know a less interesting controversy number!)

---

Be sure to keep this thread open in the next couple hours to see each song as it's eliminated with its average, some commentary, a banner featuring our favourite comment(s), and every user’s comments and scores!

And join my lovely wonderful talented cohost u/Uberpigeon [in the queup room we have rented out especially for us](https://www.queup.net/join/popheads-safe-space) to listen along to the eliminations, watch some custom hints and shitposts, and have a little chit chat with your fellow raters.

Reply to this and list your predictions for **TOP 5 IN ORDER**, and also guess the winner's average score for a tiebreaker!


Edit:  
Congrats to TiltControls! 5/5 songs correct, in the exact order, and only 0.01 off the correct average!  

Special shoutouts to CrimsonROSET for guessing Be Sweet's average exactly, and plastichaxan for also getting the exact top 5 (I asked them for an average prediction and they were much further off, FLOP)

**Stryxen** (10): I had a feeling this would come dead last as soon as I thought about how the results might look, and to start with it looked like it would just about escape it, with [REDACTED] initially taking the bottom spot. Then the 0’s came in - very sad! This song is truly special, very experimental, very punk actually. It’s actually post-music and post-song. The lack of structure in a 5 minute track is definitely something you love or hate, and I personally ADORE it. It sounds exactly like a long hot day locked inside wishing the world would pass you by, finding comfort in the destruction, how there’s some pleasure in knowing you’re in pain. That’s what this song perfectly captures, I just think it’s gorgeous and I stare at the ceiling listening to this a lot.

#snail fail

**DefaultPophead** (10): On first listen to this album, this one stood out the most and, even though I can partly explain, it's mostly instinct and an unexplainable connection. I swear to lesbian jesus if this is the first song out I'll puke and cry and shit at the same time. Then again, I'm expecting "Play The Greatest Hits" or something to be first out. RIP that was one of my most played songs of the year... anyways, back to this song. This isn't the most amazing song in the world, but the way she just sighs "feels like I'm losing my mind" gets to me so badly, the same way "does his love make your head spin" in "You Don't Know How Lucky You Are" by Keaton Henson does. And when I connect to a song or a sound so deeply, I have to show it in my score lol thank you for listening to my botched, low-budget TEDx Talk.

**GapeCod** (10): She's so fucking broken here, oh my god.

**jay?** (10): yupp yup

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): something shifted in the music industry when this dropped - ended multiple careers

**runaway3212** (10): so fucking pretty

**Arybeck67** (9): ouch, captures that feeling of depression all too well

**1998tweety** (8): cute

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I like the more accoustic direction on this, it suits her singer songwriter vibe

**RandomHypnotica** (8): despite researching extensively for my writeup I still have no fucking idea what c. et al. is supposed to mean

**synyyy** (8): It's alright, sorry I ran out of slay moment comments

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): i think she shines more on the stripped back, folkier songs

**akanewasright** (7.5): …I remember being this fucked in the head. Alcohol + codependency = this kind of shit

**homestarguy** (7.5): Charmingly lazy-feeling, even if it’s not my favorite song on the album. Great acoustic guitar work on this one, especially at the end of the verses.

**gimmeyotacos** (7): cute but i rarely come back to this song

**IIIHenryIII** (7): ever since I've heard of her, she gave me a bad impression, like she looks so arrogant and smarty, and this song title just proves me right (again, the instrumentals are beautiful, but what the fuck is wrong with her voice?)

**quinnpsych** (7): I like this song, but it doesn't stick with me. I've listened to it probably 10 times and I don't know any of the melody

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's fine but it kinda kills the momentum of the album

**steamedasparagus** (7): the guitar is nice

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): i wanna lie down often & feel overwhelmed by routines too but i don’t make whiny mediocre songs about it

**endcreditouilles** (6.5): shaking and crying and throwing up but in song form

**imbaby122** (6.5): so burn out vibes also +1 point for name dropping me

**bespectacIed** (6): ok, she didn't impress me much with the ballads... i think her husky voice doesn't lend well to slower songs

**breadcrumbs6969** (6): just kind of boring, no structure, last verse is very nice

**reput4tionera** (6): it’s cute

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): I just don't like how her voice sounds on this, and I don't like the guitar

#snail mail literally spat on them

**SmileAndTears** (5): she really is the King Princess of indie-rock, just somehow even more bland and boring

**vayyiqra** (5): Is this the song the #rates hivemind hates? It's not that bad. Kind of slow, yes, and acoustic. Her singing is a bit rough. But it's nice enough. At worst it's mid.

**wailord\_fan** (5): I just find that it's a really weak melody...

**jman457** (4.6): sorry this is a bad coffee house song

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): wow this is even more boring than i remembered sorry nicolas

**throwaway-7650** (4): not sure why this is SO hated... the vocals could be better I guess?

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Taking away all the interesting backing music and forcing people to only listen to your voice is not a good idea Ms. Mail

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Etcetera because this song just feels like scraps.

**chidi\_ariana\_grande** (3): ctrl alt delete

**CrimsonROSET** (3): feels like I’M losing my mind like the lyrics don’t back up such a put back instrumental/vocal performance

**just\_thonking** (3): this song leaves my brain as soon as I hear it

**oscarbrierley1** (3): with a song this minimalistic I want a great vocal performance, but it sounds like she's losing her voice.

**UselessTacooo** (3): hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm

**Awkward\_King** (2): i think i want to like this because of the title which is such a lame reason sdsdej, the song unfortunately does nothing for me, miss slug is at her best for me when she's rockier.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1.5): i dont know a more boring song

#etc. etc.

**BasedButta** (1): so slow

**fadedblue09** (1): Ok I try not to be harsh but wow there is literally nothing redeemable here

**2dina3dworld** (0): I think this is the song where my problems with the album are most apparent. Her voice sounds strained and reedy, it’s very boring instrumentally, and it’s just not engaging at all.

**camerinian** (0): I feel like a dick for even giving out a 0 in this rate, but, like,... this is incompetent right? I'm not the only one hearing this? The guitar work obviously sounds like ass but for no clear reason, the mixing and production is totally directionless, Lindsay's voice sounds like she was recording this mid-Covid recovery, and the lyrics (like most of the lyrics on this album to be frank) and not inspired or poetic enough to give a reason for why the fuck it sounds like this. I'll admit Snail Mail had an uphill battle for me as the one album here I was totally unfamiliar with prior, but even considering, I'm just utterly astonished at how not good this is.

**celladonn** (0): this is so boring and she sounds so bad i can't stand it

**ignitethephoenix** (0): I don’t think it’s awful, but it’s dull and definitely the worse song in the rate significantly so it gets the 0

**kappyko** (0): snail mail lounging on the couch just chilling in her snuggie clicking to mtv so they can teach her how to dougie. sorry but i feel like im audibly hearing her sing out phlegm like flecks of mucus just came out onto the mic

**MassiveThief** (0): i cant remember anything about this even after like 5 listens. feels like it should have been a 30 second lil interlude instead of a full song.

**shhhneak** (0): We probably could’ve been spared this as an interlude.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): the one thing this album did not need was a slower acoustic song tbh

**thisusernameisntlong** (0): this album is normal boring but this song is offensively boring

#speak on it

**plastichaxan** (8): all the 0s for this... sick and twisted

#and what did we learn at the women of indie rock reveal

**afs** (8): grammar lesson blegh

**waluigiest** (8): come on academia

**frogaranaman** (5): what in the English major

**TiltControls** (6): what citation style is this

**Stryxen** (6): As a Valentine defender to the death, I will say this is a moment on the album where the whiny quality of her vocals is unnecessary and even detracts from the song, which I otherwise find such an endearing signature quality! Overall, I still have positive feelings towards it, plenty of emotion and acts as a light moment surrounded by the dark themes of the album - gives it a hopeful yet regretful vibe, knowing what’s to come in the album’s plot. 

This was basically a lock for bottom 3 since I put the very first ballot (mine) in and it spent most of its time at #42, only switching occasionally with #41… what could that be?? Anyway, not too bothered about this cut, I think c. et al. is better so wouldn’t have minded this dropping 1 place either....

#Light Blue

**1998tweety** (10): what the hell why do I feel like crying

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): this one is SO dramatic

**jay?** (10): YEUPPPP

**RandomHypnotica** (10): hearing Lindsey sing "I'm not going back" knowing this album is about the end of the relationship described is so emotionally devastating, and yet this whole song just feels so beautiful and loving and precious

**runaway3212** (10): I just love her voice so much

**throwaway-7650** (10): this sounds like a jubilee song [complimentary] collab NOW [2]

**akanewasright** (9): her voice sounds awful but like :soblove:

**Arybeck67** (9): this song is so full of true, pure love that you can't help but love it. It's such a bittersweet ode.

**gimmeyotacos** (9): ok but the way she sings “nothing’s gonna stop me now”… bruh

**n1colas valentine stan** (9): her voice really does it for me... i cried several times

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): the folkier arrangement suits Lindsey's rough-around-the-edges vocal performance really, really well

**sarcasticsobs** (8.8): “no more endless nights, only the lightest blues” i forgot this rate was going to bring me pain. i enjoy lindsey much more on the rock-ier side or stripped back like this

**afs** (8.5): should've saved this one for lush with this colour but pop off bestie

**camerinian** (8.5): easily the best song on this album and I don't know if that's a hot take or not, but it's the only place Lindsay's vocals unambiguously work with her instrumentation. The strings really do sound fantastic and the brittle performance does stand out over them

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Not that this relationship sounds extremely healthy, but I wonder what it feels like to be completely enveloped in someone else's existence that you want to wake up early every day just to be awake in the same world as them. I don't think I am capable of this love or capable of being loved so this song is a nice way for me to feel it for a moment.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): a little yeehaw music to be gay to

**IIIHenryIII** (8): honestly, I think this song has the best instrumentation, but this melody ain't it, neither it's her voice

**quinnpsych** (8): I like this a lot. Didn't expect anything so touching and stripped back from this album. I think about the guy I love every time, it's actually a good representation of how I feel a lot of the time. Fuck it let's run away

**synyyy** (8): For being Carly's favourite colour this song was a bit of a letdown

**UselessTacooo** (8): cute (affectionate)

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): Blue Light outsold

**TiltControls** (7.5): the instrumentation is 100% more interesting than snail mail here

**homestarguy** (7): Beautiful if a bit underbaked tribute to a passionate past relationship.

**imbaby122** (7): another track that didn’t go anywhere but it didn’t need too it was very sweet :)

**reput4tionera** (7): ok this song is rly nice

**vayyiqra** (7): Very pretty.

**bespectacIed** (6): Cute, if not lyrically sparse

**frogaranaman** (6): don't you love the color of the sky

**kappyko** (6): you know i love a good falsetto

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the instrumental is pretty

**skargardin** (6): It's pretty but doesn't leave much of an impression on me sadly

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): So if I’m assuming correctly, the gist of this piece is that nothing’s gonna stop her now

#Fight or Flight Blue

**apatel27** (5): It's definitely a song

**CrimsonROSET** (5): this song is ukelele-coded

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): it's cute but also so boring

**cremeebrulee** (4.3): “I wanna wake up early every day / just to be awake / in the same world as you” damn i am too single for this

**fadedblue09** (4): Too underwritten to make a huge impression

**MassiveThief** (4): kind of a slog to get through

**jman457** (3.5): Sounds like a sour Ballad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Great color, non-great song.

**celladonn** (3): this is kind of nothing

**chidi\_ariana\_grande** (3): listening to this just song is more boring then sitting in silence

**qazz23** (3): not a fan, just fades into the background :(

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): her lyrical genius in the second chorus omg

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2.5): this feels like wonderwall for lesbians

**Awkward\_King** (0): this song ran over my cat

**Stryxen** (9.5): This song can make me cry, quite easily in fact! I’m not sure why but I view this as the emotional centrepiece of the album - a scrapbook of anecdotes from her time in her hometown, centred around one person who she lost all respect for over time as they grew into opposite people 

The “Back on the bench, making plans / watching the day end hand in hand … I’ll be going now” verse hits me to the core - the emotional strain of accepting this place you once loved has changed, because the people are coming and going like a cycle - and the unstoppable passage of time. “In ten years he’ll have a daughter / she’ll grow up and he can’t stop her” is one of my favourite lines of the year and the sky/sunset metaphor?? “No, the sun can’t break the habit of going down”. High concept. Perfect song to me, I only didn’t give this a 10 because it - obviously - shouldn’t win lol, probably did not need to worry about that. This was another total lock for bottom 3 - even in last place for a good portion of the ballots somehow :(

---

#the seemingly hundreds of people in the studio that day

**homestarguy** (10): Another in a nonstop barrage of odes and laments (often both in one song) to growing up on this album. I absolutely adore this one, it’s cute yet contemplative with top-notch wordplay—like the best of Lucy’s songs.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it's giving "that was so fun"

**camerinian** (9.5): this is the most miserable campfire I've ever been to

**seanderlust** (9.5): this is a great way to illustrate toxic masculinity. when we say toxic masculinity we don't mean manly men bad, we mean please go to therapy

**throwaway-7650** (9.5): really cute lyrics. and ending! john mayer could never

**bespectacIed** (9): Day 22832 of asking Mitski to debut as the fourth girlgenius. Again, superb songwriting (I think I said this in almost every song here), love the message and the linear narration

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This song makes me feel like I’m sitting around across from a campfire with Lucy eating a perfectly toasted marshmallow. God please take me there.

**bo\_g\_o** (9): I really like this, it's a cute, gentle sing-along song that acts as a nice breather after thumbs. plus the studio banter at the end is adorable

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh i love a chorus that changes meaning as the songs goes on

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): this one gets a lot of hate, but i think its a really sweet song and love that the boygenius crew was on it

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): Mitski does some backing vocals here so it’s automatically good

**afs** (8): this track gave me PTSD (punisher track stress disorders) but does enough to get 8

**akanewasright** (8): holy fuck these backing vocalists

**gimmeyotacos** (8): this song is so cute

**MassiveThief** (8): just very pleasant to listen to. her voice is perfect here. definitely picking up on some Big Thief vibes

**quinnpsych** (8): Reminds me of It's nice to have a friend by TS. Something about that cute primary school romance, it's cute. Love boygenius revival here

**synyyy** (8): She talks about the sunset as if Jack Harlow's album was rising from the other end of the horizon.

**waluigiest** (8): outro makes me smile each time

**1998tweety** (7.5): us with curfews relate, the outro did take me out a bit though.

**steamedasparagus** (7.5): hi mitski

**TiltControls** (7.5): Going Going Gone Bad Reloaded

**jman457** (7.2): Mitski, Julian Baker, and Phoebe Bridgers on this together was a little to powerful, just wish the song was more exiting

**DefaultPophead** (7): I hate the way this sounds, but my God the juxtaposition of the violence and gentleness is next-level songwriting.

**frogaranaman** (7): baseball announcers when someone hits a home run

**jay?** (7): not much of a gag

**reput4tionera** (7): fuck daniel!!!

**sarcasticsobs** (7): cute ending

**vayyiqra** (7): Kind of like the last song in that it has dark lyrics over a musical background that doesn't sound like it. I didn't care for the song itself but gave it a good score because the lyrics were saying something important about how toxic behaviour is not inborn but learned.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A cute little campfire ditty

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): i really don't like cheesy outtakes from the studio as an outro, it's so corny and lame

**wailord\_fan** (6.5): this is really cute, but I really have grown to dislike hearing conversations in the recording studio added to songs.

**shhhneak** (6.4): Phoebe Bridgers will backup vocals on anything.

#Daniel

**endcreditouilles** (6): @ all artists i am begging you to stop with the recording studio "that was the one!" outros. Such a jarring end to a beautiful song

**imbaby122** (6): lucy is a lyrical genius but i just need a littttllleee more than acoustic guitar

**therokinrolla** (6): okay mitski cannot save this one

**welcome2thejam** (6): Can't wait for the off-Broadway jukebox musical about the day Boygenius and Mitski came together and recorded this

**Arybeck67** (5): probably the worst track on the album. I can appreciate the sentiment, but the lyrics don't really hit, nor does the sparse production.

**n1colas valentine stan** (5): charli xcx in 2019:

**thedoctordances1940** (4.2): :Worried:

**oscarbrierley1** (4): the spoken bit at the end sounds like it should be a the end of an album, not the middle. It also doesnt make sense for the song because its boring and forgettable, not something to congratulate everyone on.

**Posing-With-Fishes** (4): I don't like it, it's kind of annoying I'm sorry

**runaway3212** (3.5): wish this song would going going gone of the tracklist

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): oops we’re going straight back into the boring songs on this album. the ending was cute though

**breadcrumbs6969** (3): ended toxic masculinity which is the only reason it isn't getting a straight up zero, i LOATHE the outro and if you have to put quirky recording studio audios on your album (looking at u caprisongs) make sure you put them as interludes so i can delete them from my library; also the cloud/sunset metaphore sounds like something out of a twelve year old's essay

**UselessTacooo** (3): I’m just wholly disappointed

**qazz23** (2): least fav, everything blends together at this point :(

**Awkward\_King** (1): this song's existence does nothing to improve my quality of life

**BasedButta** (0): stop please? is this even rock? im going to kill someone stop with the shittiest guitar ever, oh my god

**Stryxen** (8): I think this is a truly underrated track - absolutely awesome. The building tension in the instrumental is perfectly complemented by the panic in her vocals throughout. “One more drink ‘til I can lay beside you / though all at once is better” … I mean COME ON! That’s so well written wow. The relief and acceptance in the final verse feels like such a sudden shift as she’s still trying to hold on through alcoholic delusion but has the realisation of her breakup forced upon her. I think it’s genius structuring and songwriting - everyone who scored this highly you are truly dear to me. The other day I was listening to this and thought I should give this a 10 but alas, I had already finished the banners and did not have the time to remake any. 

This song wasn’t bottom 5 for the whole rate, but it was consistently doing… bad… like low day 1 the whole rate… let’s move on before feelings get hurt… and start hurting japanese breakfast and wolf alice fans’ feelings.

---

#Like her dog

**Arybeck67** (10): this was the runner up to getting my 11 in this rate and damn does it deserve it. The lyrics are insane and the production really puts you in the shoes of drunk, heartbroken girl desperately trying to fill the void the loss of her lover has put in her.The outro hits like a pile of rocks and Lindsey's fragile vocals work overtime to portray the depth's of her heartbreak.

**jay?** (10): YUPP

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): Girl named Autom: I know I ate periodddddddd 💅💅

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Lindsey is so incredibly harsh on herself in this song, she's cruel and spiteful, lines like "who was I to ever want like this?" are fucking mean, and yet I find myself relating to that intense self-loathing more than is probably healthy. It feels so relatable and vitrolic and defeatist in a way not many other songs have captured for me, and I absolutely adore it. One of MANY 11 contenders from this album for me

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): OMG WHO THE F*CK IS THIS WOMAN LINDSEY?!? Who in the actual hell can make you feel like this?

**Awkward\_King** (9): i guess i couldn't keep her f*g around

**breadcrumbs6969** (9): the outro... my god

**gimmeyotacos** (9): “i’m free but who was i to ever want like this?” miss lindsey who said you could attack me like this

**homestarguy** (9): Wow, now this one seems like the emotional climax to the album to me, with the themes of fiery ex-relationships and Lindsay’s addictive behaviors coming to head. Really dig the 3/4 feel in the chorus, which gives it a sense of urgency.

**afs** (8.5): automeightpointfive

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): any decent sad indie girl has to have a song comparing a relationship to owning a dog

**synyyy** (8.5): can i be like your dog

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): the “i’m like your dog” vs soccer mommy’s “i don’t want to be your fucking dog”

**bespectacIed** (8): great production and songwriting, again

**camerinian** (8): ok the groove on this one going to the outro does really work

**musical\_pyn** (8): "I'm like your dog" is one of the saddest lines I've heard in a long time jesus

**runaway3212** (8): really pretty

**steamedasparagus** (8): idk if it works 100% but it's really cool

**welcome2thejam** (8): Didn't realize so much of this album is Lindsay being a simp with tragic consequences

**seanderlust** (7.9): i particularly love the guitar on this one. i think the stronger guitars against the light occasionally discordant piano sets the mood very well

**imbaby122** (7.5): rip lesbians

**plastichaxan** (7.5): automATE

**BasedButta** (7): very interesting how it keeps subtly changing pace

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Kinda feels like they automated the writing process just a bit. But it’s still nice.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): when the party’s over’s sexy slutty sister

#bore-tomate

**jman457** (6.7): Liked the guitar, but otherwise was a bit bland

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): yes, girl, go ahead and waste all of the potential this track had 😡

**TiltControls** (6.5): it's not terrible, but at this point the album starts to drag a bit

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6.5): another song that is pretty solid lyrically but lacks an enjoyable melody

**GapeCod** (6): what's with the dog motif?

**quinnpsych** (6): Meh

**reput4tionera** (6): i love short songs but i feel like they are not working in ms. mail’s favor on this album

**throwaway-7650** (6): the melody lost me as the song went on... it's giving improv /neg

**UselessTacooo** (6): It’s just too dull to entertain me

**vayyiqra** (6): The lyrics about alcohol are a bit dark knowing she went to rehab before making this album. I hope she's okay now. :frowning:

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Uhhh

**fadedblue09** (5.5): The instrumentals seem excessive

**BeauMeringue212** (5): it's a nice song, but I feel like so many of them tease an outburst of energy that just never comes. This one could benefit from  something to shake it up

**frogaranaman** (5): robots be like

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): me when I’m giving 5s to all the songs in this album

**apatel27** (4): It's just awkward melodically

**Stryxen** (3): I’ll be honest - it’s not terrible! I would never skip this and it deserves its place in the album for sure. The YOU FUCK WITH MY FEELINGS line is jaw dropping. But overall the vocal layering is a bit too… discordant for me? and it doesn’t really hit on an emotional level.

This was bottom 1 at first (thanks to me) but slowly rose, even escaping bottom 5 for a while. Actually yeah for a while, Wolf Alice would have been the last to lose their first song

#brace for heartbreak

**jay?** (11): wow.. this is beautiful

**camerinian** (10): YOU FUCKED WITH MY FEELINGS for best two seconds of this rate

**hunnybee12** (10): a perfect song to put on repeat and cry over nothing

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): This song is one of my favourites, but honestly I won't cry if it goes out day one. I'm not very protective or passionate about it, I just really, really like it.

**plastichaxan** (9): I personally AM a plaything to make life exciting if anyone is interested

**runaway3212** (9): this is actually mind of a mastermind advice

**seanderlust** (9): I know they're not serious but lowkey galaxy brain

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): It’s a bit lowkey, but it works. The harmonies sound beautiful

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): the only way to be safe from heartbreak is never getting into relationships, that's simple

**just\_thonking** (8.5): :(

**MassiveThief** (8.5): catchy, simple, cute, relateable, love it.

**synyyy** (8.5): The quintessential slow song syndrome strikes again!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): exactly! That's the same logic I tell myself! And I'm so happy!!!

**BasedButta** (8): lucy take some notes this is how you make a good acoustic guitar song

**bridgemoney** (8): r/indieheads

**ignitethephoenix** (8): omg so true, this is why I’m single

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's a little Sunday School for me but they aren't wrong

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): kinda timid and basic but a bop anyway!

**TiltControls** (8): I mean I suppose?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): a cute little interlude. once again, the vocal layering is incredible

**violet** (7.3): pretty

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**Arybeck67** (7): kinda blasé

**BeauMeringue212** (7): the lyrics and production are more folksy and direct than some of their dreamer songs but I enjoy it

**frogaranaman** (7): no u aren't lmfao

**homestarguy** (7): It’s super pretty but…a bit too twee compared to the rest of the album imo. Giving props for the vocal work tho.

**imbaby122** (7): safe from heartbreak (if you never speak to anyone ever)

**qazz23** (7): a change of pace, but good vocals nevertheless

**UselessTacooo** (7): maybe it’s just me but these abrupt stops into acoustic guitar ballads on all these albums is off putting. It jumps so aggressively and makes the songs around it worse

#will never fall in love

**breadcrumbs6969** (6.5): VERY mellow, kind of jarring after smile and feels way too long even though it's short

**steamedasparagus** (6.5): I don't like it

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): cute! next to gorgeous...

**bo\_g\_o** (6): that title is like that one meme of eddie murphy pointing to his head

**ktajlili** (5): ugh boring

**reput4tionera** (5): ok this one was kinda boring

**skargardin** (5): this fails to make a lasting impression on me idk, it's weirdly sandwiched between two of my favourite songs on the album

**Stryxen** (8.5): ABSOLUTELY NOT!! STOP THE COUNT!! A beautiful closer that immediately stuck out as a standout for me. The strings are simply gorgeous! and again her vocals are impressively evocative. EVERYONE cried at this perfect ending to an emotional rollercoaster of an album.

Basically, I’m glad this avoided the bottom 5, wishing it was higher is probably asking too much, since it only gets worse from here, and I didn’t even give it a 10 lol.

#mi-yass

**Arybeck67** (10): goddamn. I cry without fail to this song every time. I can't really do much other than this song captures the pain of letting go and growing up so well, that you would think Lindsey was way older than she is. A great closer to a masterful album.

**bespectacIed** (10): It's a stunning, sweet song. I love how the strings add so much more dimension to the song, I won't be mad if Lindsey goes to a more orchestral route on to her next project hmmm. After wrestling through heartbreak and anger and disillusionment for the entire album, this is an apt closure

**daybed** (10): lord she is sick

**endcreditouilles** (10): mother

**jay?** (10): EXACTLYYYYYYYYY OMFG.

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): crying to this is therapeutic you guys should try it

**runaway3212** (10): slay closer to a slay album

**throwaway-7650** (10): love a good orchestral arrangement... instant 10 once that kicked in

**plastichaxan** (9.5): Mia don’t cry I’ll do it for you

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): I love strings, therefore I love this

**DefaultPophead** (9): Activated - Depression

**gimmeyotacos** (9): this song has made me ugly cry way too many times

**imbaby122** (9): definitely the most impactful emotional beat on the album and i’m not just saying that because my name is mia

**shhhneak** (9): God how I wish the rest of this album had a full orchestra.

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): “you're not here to walk me to my door, now I just love you more”. oh.

**afs** (8.5): well, I wish I heard more of that violin!

**pleasegivemeasword** (8.5): i just love strings

**synyyy** (8.5): Yes, heaven isn't real and has been replaced by a furry convention

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8.5): beautiful, lush, and clean closer

**breadcrumbs6969** (8): acceptance and closure (at last!)

**frogaranaman** (8): this is so gay and for what (when will he love me back)

**GapeCod** (8): live slow die old good girls do it well

**jman457** (8): ended the album on a really nice note

**quinnpsych** (8): Sweet song, once again sad :(

**RandomHypnotica** (8): OK it's time for me to admit that this and c. et al sound SO similar to me, I literally cannot tell them apart until the strings come in here, like I swear they are the exact same song wtf

**steamedasparagus** (8): this was so bad live

**welcome2thejam** (8): Ooh, bringing in the light piano and strings for the breakup track finale is a good move

**celladonn** (7.5): the orchestral elements are very nice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): maybe its just because im relieved this album is finally over but this is so much better than anything else on this album its not even funny

**homestarguy** (7): Look, it’s a sweet song lamenting a breakup, but it’s a bit too on the nose lol. Still a pretty way to close the album.

**reput4tionera** (7): it fills the role of guitar ballad at the end of a an album so i guess it works

**vayyiqra** (7): This is a very pretty closing track. I like the strings.

**hunnybee12** (5): her voice sounds... gritty

**IIIHenryIII** (5): stop name dropping people I like just to try to make me like your music

**qazz23** (5): nice orchestration but kind of a boring closer

**camerinian** (3): man I really thought I'd be adjusted to her voice by now but this just sounds bad. The strings section is doing a lot of heavy lifting

**thisusernameisntlong** (2.5): shouldn’t be sad it’s over, should be happy it is

**Stryxen** (7): It’s a very pretty song! I have quite a few nice memories with the song, I remember on release night this was one of the tracks I looped. It resonated with me deeply, I believe this was written for me personally. 

Anyway, no hard feelings of course! This song was basically a guaranteed day 1 cut, even dipping into the bottom 5 occasionally, but we shall move on with grace. The majority of this discourse this song tended to be “yeah no strong feelings about No Hard Feelings”, but still

**Controversy:** 1.721

#good vibes only

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): An anthem for realizing that being bitter is only raising your blood pressure and shortening your lifespan.

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): a sweet song about closure and the amy winehouse reference is just >>>>

**jay?** (10): gagged me quite a lot why lie why lie

**TiltControls** (10): a bit restrained and kinda short, but for some reason it connects with me completely

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): I remember hearing this song and how it felt to listen to this song for the first itme, and it was just before the album released as I was on the bus to the hospital. It was my third Wolf Alice song (after The Last Man on Earth and Smile, as these were the three pre-release singles I heard) and I remember thinking, oh god I have to stream this album when it comes out. It's so beautiful it actually makes my heart swell. How can a breakup song be so sweet and calming and bittersweet and safe?

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): this is so pretty and soothing

**steamedasparagus** (9.5): embarrassed to say I hadn't heard love is a losing game til they mentioned it in this song

**frogaranaman** (9): man, this one just hurts

**just\_thonking** (9): Bumping up half a point for the Love Is a Losing Game appreciation. Love IS a losing game!

**sarcasticsobs** (8.9): why are all the sad songs in this rate getting to me i’m not even lovesick or heartbroken leave me ALONE

**homestarguy** (8.5): Nice choice to keep it to mostly bass in the instrumental. Rest In Power, Amy Winehouse.

**synyyy** (8.5): nice song i guess, anyway moving to the beach

**SmileAndTears** (8.4): me when I'm tasteless and skip the first half of track 6 on Melodrama

**1998tweety** (8): omg another Lorde reference

**afs** (8): remember what I said about b*llads

**CrimsonROSET** (8): imo there’s nothing more mature than ending a relationship in friendly terms, you share so much of your life with that person and to lose that and still go ‘no this is still special even if it’s not the same’ shows so much respect for both yourself and the other it’s insane

**kappyko** (8): think the only p consistent quirk in my tastes is my favorite songs on albums being barer often darker songs that are usually ranked pretty low by others. see also: big star by lorde, tonight by angel olsen, the one song on laurel hell i dont remember right now

**vayyiqra** (8): Ethereal moments on this (good)

**welcome2thejam** (8): Beautiful stripped-back track. Stopped right when I would've wanted it to hit that next gear, but admittedly it'd probably have been at the expense of album pacing

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): too short

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): really solid folky moment. fits really well as the penultimate track of the record

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): more like No Loveless

**akanewasright** (7): this is very sweet but I’m somewhat disturbed at how I heard a rhythmic olo

**imbaby122** (7): no strong feelings about no hard feelings

**qazz23** (7): a bit boring but the bass is good

**reput4tionera** (7): that was nice

**skargardin** (7): Honestly this album loses some steam in the last half

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I suppose it’s pretty

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): crying in a bathtub to love is a losing game girl i've been there

**Stryxen** (7): This song begins so iconically, opening the second half of Jubilee, which is simply FULL of despair. This manages to set the tone with the throbbing synths, they sound like something clawing at your throat to get out, or something… pulsating… yk… BONK. Probably my least fav of the horny songs in the rate (Feeling Myself/First Time/Sit) but that trio is so top tier that is still high praise. I LOVE this song due to the shoegazey production and, I just rated it down here so it didn’t overperform over the other songs I adore.

Again, another song destined for day 1, although it wasn’t always bottom 10, and wasn’t even the bottom Jubilee track for a good portion of the rate! Anyway, nice to finally see you Michelle, back to a bit more even footing in the rate now…

**throwaway-7650** (10): #SEATED

**UselessTacooo** (10): This has some of the best production I think I’ve heard all year. The dream-pop esc soundscape with Jbrekkies lush vocals makes for an incredible journey

**1998tweety** (9.5): Kagome whenever Inuyasha is pissing her the fuck off

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): caught up in this song

**afs** (9): that first line was supposed to be in the previous track

**bo\_g\_o** (9): jbrekkie could make loveless but mbv couldn't make jubilee

**breadcrumbs6969** (9): in the mood for yearning (again) i guess

**sarcasticsobs** (9): the textures on this, let’s gooo

**SmileAndTears** (8.7): a slay and a half

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): I like the shoegaze-lite production on this

**synyyy** (8.5): It goes somewhere, I don't know where, but it goes somewhere!

**violet** (8.2): shes sitting

**cremeebrulee** (8): this is an early cut and honestly jbrekkie needs some but this is still amazing idc. i wanna drown in those synths

**GapeCod** (8): stay, lie down

**steamedasparagus** (8): I like it

**BasedButta** (7.5): pretty good but it lags behind for me a bit as i’m not a fan of the use of empty space (also i wish it went harder)

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): This song is one of the weakest on the album for me, but that's just because the whole album (besides one song) is almost perfect. I do love the lyrics on this one, though! "Hear my name in your mouth and I'm done for" is such a simple line but I think about it a lot.

**ReallyCreative** (7.2): I'm afraid this one doesn't live up to the potential hinted at in the opening riffs

**Awkward\_King** (7): i think this is grand in a way i like as opposed to posing in bondage

**jay?** (7): also didnt gag that much why lie

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): i love shoegaze

**reput4tionera** (7): the intro’s kinda hyperpop i think

#🧍

**vayyiqra** (7): I made what I thought was a funny joke yesterday about this song being ironic because it's called "Sit" yet I used the "person_standing" emoji that means "meh". Nobody thought it was funny or reacted to it. Posted cringe, I guess. Anyway this song is nice enough - I like the piano a lot - but it always feels a bit fillerish. Not that it's filler itself, but it's one of the weaker tracks on here for sure.

**Arybeck67** (6.6): the production is nice but that's it

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): “sit” being followed by “good boy” in the tracklist just has me thinking about training a pet

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): and stay

**runaway3212** (6.5): now if this would be sit/stay it would be a 13 but sadly it's only Sit so it's half of that score

**frogaranaman** (6): me to my pet dog (good)

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the instrumental is really good, but the she's coming for ariana's bad annunciation gig with the vocals. It makes it sound like a demo

**quinnpsych** (6): Sit is always one of those songs I skip. I'm honestly kind of scared by it, I don't know it creeps me tf out. Something about the synths mixed with her vocals, makes me feel like I'm dying

**skargardin** (6): in the grand scheme of things this song is just kind of there for me on this album

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s okay

**welcome2thejam** (6): My apologies to Sit for being smack-dab in so much great music that it sounds just okay in comparison

**akanewasright** (5): yeah this is the clear least favorite for me. Maybe it’ll click one day, it’s not like it’s bad, it just washes over me every time

**homestarguy** (5): Fussy, underwhelming. My least favorite on the record. Still pretty tho.

**hunnybee12** (5): jbrekkie, friend, we couldve cut this one ❤️

**NewAccountNow** (5): :|

**Posing-With-Fishes** (5): maybe it would've fit more in Soft Sounds and it could've been rated higher

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5): this one drags a bit for me. think it could benefit by being shorter

**RandomHypnotica** (4.5): putting this next to Savage Good Boy makes it really seem like this section of the album will be about training a dog when looking only at the titles

**bulforster** (4.3): The dud of the album. Basically posing in bondage again but worse in every way.


**apatel27** (3): Where's the substance

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): the beginning of this song sounds like that shitty running up that hill cover they used to play all the time on my city’s alt rock station. i think i’d rather listen to that song than this

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): It’s called “Sit” because the song does nothing for three minutes.

**qazz23** (0): Weakest point of the album, not a strong hook here

#👁️ 👄 👁️

**imbaby122** (8): i’ve been listening to this song for months and just recently realized that the namesake of the song is the lyric “say to sit on your face” like damn i didn’t know this song was horny!!!

**bespectacIed** (9): I love how jbrekkie's concept of jubilation includes sitting on someone's face. She's just like us! p.s. the prodction makes me think of a mitski and the antlers' lovechild

**gimmeyotacos** (8): adds to my drunk and horny playlist

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I can’t believe she made such a vibey song about sitting on someone’s face

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): on my face, please

**seanderlust** (7.5): michelle....go take a cold shower dear

**CrimsonROSET** (4): my original comment for this was ‘oh this sounds really intimate let me read the lyrics’ I mean I was right but oh wow

**Awkward\_King** (11): the opening notes of this song are such a slay, especially after c et al, it's such like a jolt of adrenaline out of nowhere. the guitar line is so lovely and this overall is just a song i have not tired of

---

#people i don’t trust as much as reddit user awkward king

**Stryxen** (9): Glory is one of the most streamed on the album and I think it’s so deserved, despite being an (according to these results) overlooked album cut. This placement is such a robbery, the “owe me / own me / know me” rhyme scheme is so fun and those little syncopated guitar strums in the chorus just tie this entire song into a masterpiece for me! One of my favourite songs from one of my favourite artists. I thought this was a fan-favourite from the streaming numbers, I’m clearly out of touch with the mailinators

#glory

**apatel27** (10): More guitars please

**bespectacIed** (10): Banger alert. I was grateful she didn't completely abandon her classique indie rock sound because I am such a fan. This took me back to Lush with the familiar guitar work

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): she came in hot and didn't let up for a single second

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): i wanna do poppers

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): "you owe me / you own me / you know me: is like "live laugh love" levels of songwriting but she made points so i'll ignore it

**ReallyCreative** (9.4): she's serving your honor

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): jesus died for you! And you! And YOU!

**jay?** (9): yup

**steamedasparagus** (9): this was so good live

**violet** (9): i love this song!!!

**bulforster** (8.5): Apparently this is the most like Lush? Seems like that album would be more my thing since I also liked her exchange song....

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended britney

**fadedblue09** (7.5): maybe it's because the last song was so bad and I might be inflating this, but I enjoyed this a lot

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): honestly, I think this might grow on me (I swear I've heard this melody from the chorus before but I can't pinpoint it)

**akanewasright** (7): there’s a joke i could make about “you owe me, you own me” but… yeah no I’ve been there, it sucks to be mad at someone for making you feel horrendously alone, but are still just. Stuck to them like codependent glue

**DefaultPophead** (7): Maybe it's just that this is after Madonna and c. et al. that it doesn't sound too pleasant, but hey it is what it is. Not bad, but I wouldn't probably revisit this unless I was listening to the full album. And I'd probably skip if it came on shuffle.

**frogaranaman** (7): this is cute

**GapeCod** (7): Same problem as the title track, but a bit worse, this is Lush worship that doesn't really reach the heights of neither that album nor this one.

**homestarguy** (7): Enjoy the return to the rocker-type cuts here, even if there isn’t much that separates the verse and choruses instrumentally. They can’t all be the title track.

**imbaby122** (7): i’m pretty neutral on this track but i added it to my liked songs so it deserves a 7

**jman457** (7): nice guitar

**MassiveThief** (7): more fuzzy guitars and catchy hooks pls

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): Snail Mail should do more short songs like this one!

#snorey

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Shoutout Jesus.

**chidi\_ariana\_grande** (6): ur right tho indie girls are soooooo oppressed

**oscarbrierley1** (6): a less memorable version of so many other songs in the rate. Somehow short and drags on too much.

**reput4tionera** (6): i like indie rock but these songs are blending together so bad

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): pretty forgettable, maybe because it feels like a cut off Lush

**vayyiqra** (6): I really like the guitar on this.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I want to like this I really do, but those “you oooowe me”s are just too much

**runaway3212** (4): the only dud here

**TiltControls** (4): I can hardly remember anything about this track

**CrimsonROSET** (3): oh i hate hate hate each and every single one of those ‘you oooooowe me’

#i’m bitches

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): bitches be losing their minds to the guitar solo in this it’s literally two goddamn chords!!!!

**Stryxen** (8): I think this song is excellent. Another rambling monologue from lucy put to a light constant guitar strum, but it resonates with me on another level - I don’t remember giving this an 8, I thought I had given it at least a 9.5 - my bad. The lyrics are stunning, narrating her and her best friend’s relationship as they grew up and apart, with the energy slowly building to a release, as if an explosive fight could break out at any moment. But then it simply dissolves as she finds out her friend lost their virginity a long time ago and she realises they had grown up apart from each other, breaking their childhood promise to “grow old together just to pass the time” (one of her best lyrics btw)

I could honestly highlight any single lyric here, this song is genius. But I’m not sure the raters were particularly keen on poetry set to a lowkey instrumental (that’s the vibe I’ve been getting from a lot of these eliminations). I wish this was higher. The future isn’t worth its weight in gold / The future is a benevolent black hole.

#🤸

**exciting\_patient4872** (11): The fakeout build-up is lowkey genius. Perfectly emulates intense emotion that is bottled up.

**DefaultPophead** (10): This is top 5 material and if you disagree, you're wrong and your opinion makes me cry. Thanks a lot.

**GapeCod** (10): Lucy talented, she do

**jay?** (10): gagged me

**ReallyCreative** (10): I definitely sense that this song will leave early, but I really think Lucy's writing style lends itself incredibly well towards folk, and I'd love to see her do a true folk album.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The part about finding out her friend lost her virginity hit me so hard… Like yeah I’ve definitely been there, the surprise that these supposedly far-off and foreign concepts like sex are suddenly and unexpectedly happening right in front of you. It’s part betrayal, part jealousy, part fear. Like you’re losing a friend, or realizing you knew less about them than you thought you did

**wailord\_fan** (10): AH sad song that makes me sad.

**1998tweety** (9): omg these lyrics cut

**BeauMeringue212** (9): I love the dreamy instrumentals. Idk why but this song also makes me think of the Virgin Suicides for some reason

**bespectacIed** (9): really well-written song, very relatable. Slowly losing your childhood into teenhood was a surreal feeling

**homestarguy** (9): Very Sufjan-ish instrumental. Love Lucy’s harmonies on this one, and how she once again effectively encapsulates the weirdness of growing up and losing innocence through a friend’s romance.

**therokinrolla** (9): I can foresee this getting panned for good reason: it's melody is so repetitive, but it's a good one, propelling the narrative forward into the benevolent black hole.

**throwaway-7650** (9): "~~cartwheel~~ monkey bars and a broken wrist" 5th grade me

**IIIHenryIII** (8.7): I can't do cartwheels anymore, can you believe that? And now I'm convinced they're dangerous

**afs** (8.5): ffs the drums at 2:30 really made me think we were going THERE

**synyyy** (8.5): nice

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): Lucy take notes this is what we need from a song by you

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): the drum bringing in the 2nd verse actually jump scares me sometimes

**camerinian** (8): My only disappointment with getting this album on vinyl is that side A doesn’t come to an end on “the future is a benevolent black hole”

**CrimsonROSET** (8): and you and I would be like a couple of cosmonauts

**imbaby122** (8): now this is something i can relate to, very much virgincore

**n1colas valentine stan** (8): i cant believe she would write this song wtf lucy dacus :sob: :sob: :sob:

**quinnpsych** (8): The repetitive melody in this song reminds me of a song you'd sing in church. I fuck with it

**runaway3212** (8): this song is also so slay btw I never learned how to do cartwheel so this song could never be me

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): the future is a benevolent black hole

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): doesnt really go anywhere super interesting but I really love the melody and the lyrics

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): this song feels the most like filler on this album, but it's decent filler

**plastichaxan** (7.5): i think lucy could perform to this doing cartwheels like that fergie video

**TiltControls** (7.5): now do a backflip!

**jman457** (7.3): some great lyrical moments on here but not my fav track

**Arybeck67** (7): again, a bit of a forgetful track

**breadcrumbs6969** (7): i really liked the first part and can def relate to the fear of death when i was younger, even sometimes now but then i didn't like the second part lyrically at all

**frogaranaman** (7): this is so me when I'm doing cartwheels

**kappyko** (7): ohhh i know some gay person is gonna say this is just like snail mail and mitski

**shhhneak** (7): Without a chorus it sounds like a weird fable but set in modern suburbia.

**waluigiest** (7): every perfect album needs a song that’s just okay

#shartwheel 🤸🕳️

**reput4tionera** (6): i feel like everyone loves this song but its my least fav on the album 😭

**vayyiqra** (6): The storytelling on this album is neat and all. I think I'm just too tired to appreciate the music right now.

**RandomHypnotica** (5): firefly… juice??? They have juice??? I have never been gladder not to have fireflies here

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): its fucking boring!!!

**cremeebrulee** (4): is this the origin of “fell to my knees at the walmart parking lot” bit

**fadedblue09** (4): Her voice cannot pull these stripped-down songs [2]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Apt title because this song just kinda rolls along until it stops.

**BasedButta** (2): just very boring, oh god

**Stryxen** (8): Horny jail for you Ellie! The production here is insane - I thought i had this rated slightly higher tbh, but an 8 is still a great score for a great song! This became a slight 11 magnet in the last week or so of ballots and I see why, it’s just very different from quite a lot in this rate and it sounds like pure distilled pussy! 

Another lock for day 1 unfortunately, at one point even dipping into bottom 5?? I was shocked, i was in tears almost. I guess we hate sex positivity on popheadaches

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): We love flickin’ the bean!

**IIIHenryIII** (8): the instrumentation in the verses are top-notch, but the chorus is so disappointing

**quinnpsych** (8): This song is good y'all. Sexy and dreamy and nighttime

**TiltControls** (8): a little forgettable at first, but when it explodes... so good

**vayyiqra** (8): Is that a Rhodes electric piano on this alt-rock album ??? Wait no, it's a Wurlitzer I think. I was close. Anyway this band is fully committed to the retro LARP and I like that.

**akanewasright** (7.7): insert normani wap dance green screen here

**ignitethephoenix** (7.7): was not expecting a masturbation anthem / teaching a man how to please a woman on this album but here we are!

**reput4tionera** (6): i forgot everything about this song as soon as it was over

**homestarguy** (5): Dig the sound and the vocals, but overall I’m not really “feeling” this one songwriting-wise.

**Stryxen** (8): The discourse on this song was headache-inducing. It’s just some vocoder, and it works perfectly for this song thematically and conceptually, representing her hiding her age and immaturity to be with an older partner. Cool idea! INCREDIBLE songwriting! 

I could maybe write an essay just about this verse: “Knee-deep in the city that never sleeps / I lay down in the middle of the street / Lamplight like parallel suns / Crowding out the early morning stars / Concrete holding heat from the daytime / Picking petals to see if you will be mine / Do you love me? Do you love me not?”

This managed to scrape day 2 for a good while but a sudden influx of low scores in the last week or so basically cemented it here exactly for the rest of the rating period. Shame - although i had this pinned as a bottom 5 cut from the start, so I will take this as a win.

---

#every comment probably mentions hyperpop, autotune / vocoder, or Farrah Abraham - no need to categorise

**Awkward\_King** (10): this is so gorgeously hypnotic, it feels shrouded in haze and blurry vocoder its wonderful its such an experience

**bo\_g\_o** (10): ooh! chill! it's really chill! the vocal effects are a bit hard to swallow at first but they manage to give the song a unique atmosphere

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): love the vocal effect and the story, favourite off the album

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I hate the vocal effect, it is so unnecessary

**jay?** (10): gag it down

**musical\_pyn** (10): at first I did not like the autotune, but now I think it's an inspired choice and the song would be so much worse without it. my 11 for this album

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): somebody tell her hyperpop is not really a thing anymore

**plastichaxan** (10): i love hyperpop

**runaway3212** (10): oh no my weakness autotune

**2dina3dworld** (9.5): autotune queen

**you2009** (9.5): it was YEW cher...

**afs** (9): Farrah was the blueprint.

**Arybeck67** (9): this song is awesome, the auto- tune works perfectly when analyzing the lyrical narrative

**cremeebrulee** (9): oh this is fucking heavy omg.

**frogaranaman** (9): "when I asked you to coffee, could you tell I don't drink it?" okay well just shoot me right in the heart I guess

**gimmeyotacos** (9): the vocal effects and the shredding at the end... too good

**imbaby122** (9): lucy dacus is the last artist i’d expect to experiment with autotune but it works so well?!?? i’ve given up on pretending i like coffee in fact i’m an avid and outspoken coffee hater.

**quinnpsych** (9): The vocal effects in this are rad

**synyyy** (9): I know artists get inspiration from odd sources but Farrah Abraham was not what I was expecting.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): the use of vocoder on this track is a bit of a risk but it pays off in a big way imo

**apatel27** (8.5): Autotune works surprisingly well for a rock track

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): I hope she tries more songs in this style someday!

**shhhneak** (8.4): Thank you to Lucy’s voice collapsing that day so we could get the vocoder sound.

**jman457** (8.3): her hyperpop era

**bespectacIed** (8): Not that it's bad, but this is the least interesting song in an album full of lyrical masterpieces. The climax breakdown was so good though. I just don't think the vocal distortion is necessary, righttt

**camerinian** (8): holy fuck lucy dacus hyperpop

**homestarguy** (8): A delightful mess unlike any song she’s put out before. It’s not my favorite, but it offers another fascinating story from her early romantic life, and love how it dissolves into noise at the end.

**qazz23** (8): don't mind the autotune, the shoegazey second half is good

**reput4tionera** (8): cmon hyperpop!!!

**vayyiqra** (8): Autotuned Lucy Dacus turns out to be good? Interesting. I can get into this sound from her.

**waluigiest** (8): between not drinking coffee or rum and cokes, I thought she was a mormon the first time I listened.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Eventually grew to be cool with the voice effect, but boy, the rest of the song had to do a hard carry job to get there first

**BasedButta** (7.5): okay. fucked up electronic sounds are always great but not quite enough here sadly

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): The autotune is tasteful and well executed…but I don’t have a great feeling about this one’s placement.

**wailord\_fan** (7.5): cute concept, and obligatory 'she used vocoder because she lost her voice' comment, but the song doesn't hit that hard.

**seanderlust** (7.3): I really like the use of auto tune here! the narrator feels fairly emotionally distant from this past relationship so I think it makes sense

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): the autotune being used on this distracts me from the lyrical content about a predatory relationship, but I appreciate her trying something different

**akanewasright** (7): they really put the autotune on a song I don’t emotionally connect to in order to trick me into stanning… it’s only working a little

**BeauMeringue212** (7): At first I wasn't sure about the vocoder since it stands out so much next to to the other tracks, but I've grown to like it more

**just\_thonking** (7): Is this hyperpop?

**ReallyCreative** (7): the autotune is an interesting choice but not necessarily a good one, I love the last minute or so though

**SmileAndTears** (7): the autotune was definitely a choice

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): this was the LAST album I expected to hear heavily autotuned vocals, and I don't think it's really working here, but the rest of the song goes off

**1998tweety** (6.5): sorry but its a boot from me, the guitar is epic but idk about the voice filter.

**celladonn** (6.5): i fear this wouldn't be memorable at all without the autotune

**sarcasticsobs** (6.5): i know she gave a good reason for the vocal editing but i still don’t like it

#i have never listened to farrah abraham in my life i don’t even know what everyone is talking about

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.2): her T-Pain serve

**oscarbrierley1** (6): the autotune/vocoder is a choice. It's interesting but not super for me.

**steamedasparagus** (6): doesn't work imo

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): shes in her vocaloid era

**CrimsonROSET** (5): fine this album does miss, the autotone while it works for the message of the song is a choice that I sonically hate!

**skargardin** (5): I fear I'm not a fan of the auto-tune here

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): The coffee line is so relatable… but also I kinda don’t like how it sounds like she’s singing into a fan

**xxipil0ts** (5): - We don't talk about this one but good for her.

**ACORGIORGY** (4): I feel like good singers using autotune have to do something more than just... sing with autotune... to make it interesting.

**kappyko** (4): it's honestly really a shame how the auto-tune is pretty bad because this song would definitely be great without it

**UselessTacooo** (4): This is such a missed opportunity. There was 11 potential in this song, but layering it with insufferable amounts of vocoder just ruins it.

**babadork** (3): I like the idea of using autotune for a narrator that is pretending to be someone she isn’t, but this does not sound good.

**endcreditouilles** (3): not a fan of the vocal effects here

**MassiveThief** (2): god I wish she just didn't do the autotune. there's a lot of cool stuff happening but her voice is honestly unbearable.

**Mudkip1** (2): I’ve realized I either really like or really dislike the songs on this album lol, there’s almost no in-between

**fadedblue09** (1): This was literal pain to listen to

**Stryxen** (8.5): I’m shocked by this elimination. I really really like this song, it’s so much fun. I genuinely cannot understand disliking this song THAT much and thought this was a day 2 lock, if not a day 3 placement! The chorus full of religious imagery representing the regretful worship for this person is stunning to me. Addictive guitar, and that outro is so relatable - I broke up with someone because I wanted to listen to this song in its full glory, even if it was as the Original Madonna in question.

---

#Ais if you ever read this (she won’t) i am so sorry

**My friend Ais** (11): !!!

#group therapy session

**Arybeck67** (10): when all the glitter of obsession fades, you are simply left with the reality of your situation. God, Amandla really did a number on Lindsey 😭

**Awkward\_King** (10): the melody of this is slay i love the prechorus, the we're not really talking now hook gets stuck in my head so much

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): tbh very very clear single material, and the get to it now or we can fight on the phone line spoke to my soul

**cremeebrulee** (10): put me on a pedestal and i’ll only disappoint you :(

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh fuck yeah where was this energy the rest of the album

**daybed** (10): probably everyone will make this joke but washed the hag.

**gimmeyotacos** (10): "i’ve come to hate my body / now it’s not yours, now it’s not mine" absolutely ruined me

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): she really did not miss choosing the singles for the album rollout... cleared the hag

**plastichaxan** (10): so true bestie fuck absolution

**RandomHypnotica** (10): which of the 7 sins would you abolish first? I'd say get rid of gluttony

**ReallyCreative** (10): what a SERVE

**steamedasparagus** (10): shoutout closeted christian upbringing

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): This song is just sort of strange and I love it. I want me a toxic, pining, weird, co-dependant, sexy, religious, romantic wlw relationship ughh

**bespectacIed** (9): Lindsey chose singles well in this era, this is awesome stuff.

**welcome2thejam** (9): My new religion worships that moment when the verses briefly speed up right before the chorus

**1998tweety** (8.5): icon

**afs** (8.5): if indie rock becomes mainstream will this track bag her a feature on some mediocre trend following Madonna track

**BasedButta** (8.5): it loses steam towards the end, but still good, groovy, great drums

**synyyy** (8.5): minus one point for this not being about the gang bang queen

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I love Lady Gaga too!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): “We’re not really talking now” - Madonna and her fans after she released American Life

**chidi\_ariana\_grande** (8): Bitch, I’m Snail Mail

**homestarguy** (8): Love the groove on this one, even I think it’s a bit clunky lyrically. Again tho, really enjoyed this one overall.

**jay?** (8): hmm

**runaway3212** (8): madonna an icon idc

**jman457** (7.5): solid tune

**TiltControls** (7.5): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EVWae2SXQAAA4v0.jpg

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): really like this one but the clunkiness of the lyrics in some spots really holds this song back

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): wanted to make a joke turning the metaphor to Madonna the singer but I realized there’s basically no religious metaphor she hasn’t beaten me to

**akanewasright** (7): this is around the point where the album stops being fun for me and starts being >!hey, remember when your unhealthy love for someone nearly drove you to alcoholism at 17?!<

**quinnpsych** (7): I liked this song a lot more when I first listened to it. Chorus still slaps

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): dunno what people who properly listened to this think of it but it’s good as a mindless bop!

**throwaway-7650** (7): [stan secret](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FrCz6qvPJXE)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Pretty boppy

**sarcasticsobs** (6.7): i would like the chorus synth removed. but i like the drum pick up during the second verse

#you specifically should yeah

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): i feel like i should like this more

#a madonna stan/anti war broke out?

**BeauMeringue212** (6): I enjoy the song but without a strong chorus it feels a bit anticlimactic for me

**fadedblue09** (6): Interesting progressions but again, not a big fan of her vocals.

**frogaranaman** (6): I thought she was dead

**imbaby122** (6): this song is very disjointed nothing flows it just happens

**qazz23** (6): ummm.. much rather listen to Madonna (original comment lololol)

**vayyiqra** (6): Again, I'm Catholic and lyrics that talk about religion in a critical way (like Lucy) or use it as imagery and metaphor (like this) tend to appeal to me. The song itself isn't great, but the lyrics are quite vivid, so I like that.

**camerinian** (5.5): well at least the groove is nice. Not a lot on this album so it does stand out

**oscarbrierley1** (5.5): the instrumental is interesting... I don't really like it though

**ACORGIORGY** (5): This song needs to figure out what it wants instead of trying to be a bunch of things all at once.

**reput4tionera** (5): i mean it’s a song

**shhhneak** (5): Maddoneh

**static\_int\_husp** (4): girl, do you need a therapist reccomendation to work thru why you're not talking now?

#3 comments that tanked this for very different reasons

**2dina3dworld** (3): …actually Snail Mail wouldn’t be a bad choice to play Madonna in the Madonna biopic

**IIIHenryIII** (3): keep the name of our queen out of your f**"ing mouth

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): imagine naming your song after the worst pop star of the 80’s

**Stryxen** (7): Get his ass Lucy, the first cut of any of the vaguely man-hating anthems (lemme think what qualifies here. Brando, The Last Man On Earth, Savage Good Boy? Tactics? Kinda, Lipstick on the glass if you stretch, oh I just remembered Going Going Gone is out, nevermind.) The SECOND cut of any of the vaguely man-hating anthems. Not much discourse about this song, but I quite like it. I have one really special association with a friend of mine who said this reminded them of me - I tried not to read too much into it.

---

#the first comments to never hurt another

**camerinian** (10): crazy how none of the other albums in the rate get the waterworks going as quickly as Lucy does. We stan a queen who doesn’t waste time in dealing out emotional damage.

**GapeCod** (10): comphet

**seanderlust** (10): the groom at a wedding lucy dacus is attending: https://img.buzzfeed.com/buzzfeed-static/static/2018-05/1/11/asset/buzzfeed-prod-web-01/anigif_sub-buzz-14948-1525190301-2.gif

**throwaway-7650** (10): I wish I could make playing matchmaker sound as poetic as this

**sarcasticsobs** (9.5): this shit is heartbreaking “I'd rather lose my dignity, than lose you to somebody who won't make you happy” like, fuck off

**akanewasright** (9): …fuck, man

**bespectacIed** (9): Not suprised this was the song sapphic fans (aka 90% of lucy fans) identify with the most. Queer yearning, gotta be one the most depressing genres! The last verse reminds me of Death Cab for Cutie - Cath

**DefaultPophead** (9): Oh God, the lyrics to this one... "Knowing you, they'd be the first kid to never hurt another | I see you look at him and wonder if he'll make you a mother" Instant crying. She has made me into a sinner. I am so rageful and envious omg

**gimmeyotacos** (9): this song hurts me on so many levels

**homestarguy** (9): We all wish we had such a caring friend as Lucy as she is to Christine. :)

**IIIHenryIII** (9): who doesn't like a homewrecker?

**jay?** (9): gag

**reput4tionera** (9): god this song…

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I wish I was mentally healthy enough to not like this song

**waluigiest** (9): @ all of my high school crushes who didn’t end up gay

**bulforster** (8.8): oof, been there

**shhhneak** (8.8): This one is hitting hard today for some reason phew

**babadork** (8.7): Lucy Dacus seems like a good friend.

**1998tweety** (8.5): bi bop

**celladonn** (8.5): these lyrics devastate me a little

**jman457** (8.2): A nice little queer tune

**afs** (8): Tilted by Chris OUTSOLD

**apatel27** (8): Lucy is a good one

**Arybeck67** (8): ngl, this song is a bit forgetful but pretty nonetheless

**CrimsonROSET** (8): and people said this album cant be about FRIENDSHIP

**quinnpsych** (8): a cute little song. it's too sweet, and it is very much the gay youth experience. Hating the boyfriend, dreaming of scenarios that will never happen, but in a morbid way willing them to happen so you can have your romantic ending. Instrumentation adds a lot to this feeling

**runaway3212** (8): this is heather for hot people

**synyyy** (8): I may end up dreaming about the photograph lady chasing me with her shoe...

**violet** (8): her voice is so pretty on this song omg?!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Honestly I don't want romantic implications cause this is great, and any "they're not good for you" song where the singer seems attracted will inch it closer to unwanted Treat You Better territory

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): oh this is very sad and very gay

**imbaby122** (7.5): shitting on my friends’ partners is a profession.

**steamedasparagus** (7.5): ha gayyyyyyyy

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7.5): great storytelling

**bo\_g\_o** (7): it's a bit short but it's still really moving and captivating

**frogaranaman** (7): damn who hurt her

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): shes so real

**therokinrolla** (7): I want to give this a higher score but it's simply not the most musically interesting song. BUT THROW THAT SHOE QUEEN GO OFF OMG

#boo boo i’m throwing tomatoes (and shoes)

**breadcrumbs6969** (6.5): very mellow and a bit disappointing after the opener, got a bonus 0,5 because of the few lines in the outro

**ktajlili** (6): idk i don't like how this is placed at the beginning of the album, especially after something as catchy as hot and heavy

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): :Dull:

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Girl, he’s trash!

**oscarbrierley1** (5): yawn

**UselessTacooo** (5): I’m here for slay bops not naur ballads

**vayyiqra** (5): I kind of feel nothing about this, sorry. (And as a Catholic that's kind of odd.)

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Sorry I don't really love her voice that much to be listening to a stripped back track like this

**SmileAndTears** (4.5): Christine in MoM 🤝 This song -> Being the least interesting part of either project

**MassiveThief** (4): filler imo :/

**BasedButta** (2.5): ooookay it’s the album’s second song and it’s already time to get boring i see

#[RATE]???

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): Christiiiiine, untraced by the world outside you, anyways

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): save your love for someone like meeeee, you don't have to be a part time, christine

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): and the queens

**violet** (10): fave song on the album

**1998tweety** (8.5): ate a bit

**afs** (8.5): alright why aren't these tracks mentioning the titles

**homestarguy** (8.5): A dark track lyrically, but I really enjoy Lindsay’s command of that gentle jangly rock sound on this one too.

**synyyy** (8.5): Head lock for last place, they said. Bullshit

**bespectacIed** (8): Great song, could fit in Lush well. Very gay. Flawless production as usual

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Hit me with your headlock baby.

**frogaranaman** (8): she really yassified this one

**steamedasparagus** (8): ARE YOU LOST IN IT TOO!!!

**vayyiqra** (8): I like her description of the way she wrote this song. Weirdly relatable! [I was going to elaborate and trauma-dump about depression but chose to redact that.]

**welcome2thejam** (8): Grew on me since last year. This is the one everyone thought sounded like a Lush descendant, right? Cause I can hear it now

**endcreditouilles** (7.7): how many people do you think have drunk texted their ex lyrics from this song at 2am

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Not sure why this one doesn't get me like the rest of her stuff. She is whiny and screechy but I usually really dig that. Can't give it too low of a score (it's not like I don't like it) but I can't put it up there with the other stuff.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): there's a haunting sound played throughout the track that kinda made me like this song after a few listens

**quinnpsych** (7): I like this song, I don't love it. Once again I feel like vocals are fantastic.

**seanderlust** (7): you'll NEVER be imogen heap!!!!!!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): really dreamy song but the vocal performance is a bit off-putting to me

#head-lock for songeniality?

**apatel27** (6.5): Her enunciation is really bad on this one

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): got off to a good start but this kinda went nowhere from there for me

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): more like putting me in a headlock of boredom :haha:

**jman457** (6.2): just sounds like background music

**imbaby122** (6): kept waiting for this to go somewhere

**reput4tionera** (6): these songs are starting to blend together maybe phoebe bridgers had a point. they fought right

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I don’t understand how this song is mostly low notes and yet she still sounds like she’s struggling to hit them. It has to be on purpose right? She’s choosing to sound like that?

**cremeebrulee** (5.7): she really said ✨💘 suicide 🥺✨

**UselessTacooo** (5.5): It’s as if we constantly build to a heaping pile of nothing

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I am indeed lost in this, can’t find what’s good about it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): oh wow another boring snail mail song who could’ve guessed it /s

Humantrashcan: Okay popping into this rate has made me aware that I need to be more active in theses rates, though ive done a few in the past. What I will say, even tho I didn't participate in this rate. Valentine and Ben Franklin are amazing songs to me, but BF specifically as someone who has felt with addiction, this song was something that was just great to listen to. Means nothing now but its my absolute 11. IDK  this song just really touched me

ZebraSun73: Howwwww did I miss the deadline for this I am a fool. Snail Mail clearly needed me. Anyway thank you popheads for making a Indie Girls rate and a Eurovision rate, the two pillars of my ~~life~~ music library. 

Also How Can 11 Make It OK?
