#RIP SNAIL MAIL

Welcome to day 2 of our Valentine listening party! Aka the 2021 Women of Indie Rock rate! You can see the announcement and discussion post [here](https://redd.it/tuma9v)

This weekend we are revealing the songs we rated from four of the most acclaimed indie albums of 2021, from lowest to highest average and today we’re revealing #28-#15 **starting at 3PM EST** or roughly 45 minutes from when this is posted.

At the end of the day I will open a form to vote for the MOST ROBBED SONG, eliminated on day 1 or 2, so make sure you’re keeping notes!

**AGAIN, SOME STATS:**

Number of participants: [121](https://pastebin.com/ediurfg5)

Average score: 7.879 (...will we be reaching it today?)

Average controversy score: 1.736

Be sure to keep this thread open in the next couple hours to see each song as it's eliminated with its average, some commentary, a banner featuring our favourite comment, and every user’s comments and scores!

And join me and my lovely wonderful talented cohost u/Uberpigeon [in the queup room we have rented out especially for us](https://www.queup.net/join/popheads-safe-space) to listen along to the eliminations, watch some custom hints and shitposts, and have a lil chit chat with your fellow raters.

**Stryxen** (7): This song is adorable!! Cute concept which works on two layers, satirising modern dating being all about unattainable grand gestures, and empty unfulfilled promises to stay together in the most impossible circumstances, while also making commentary on the ignorance and evil of the richest contributing to the destruction of the earth. I think that’s so cool, and she explores every possible inch of this ideal!

Overall, I really like this song, the opening vocal effect is slightly jarring, especially after SIT, but it has really grown on me over time - it’s so faux-cheerful that it feeds into the idea of abandoning humanity for this artificial love and pretending to be okay with it. But also there are some really dear and tender confessions of love in this, that it remains earnest. “And when the city’s underwater / I will wine and dine you in the hollows / on a surplus of freeze-dried food”.

Once this received its 0, right at the start, it was doomed to a low placement, but WOW am i impressed at how this clawed its way JUST into day 2. And if anyone was at the reveal yesterday for the Savage Good Boy first out - it was kind of a hint that it was first out day 2. Nice to see you again, Michelle, feel free to stick around for a bit!

---

#how did this get here

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): I don’t listen to this song often enough! It’s really good! The vamping in the background reminds me of that Devotchka song used throughout Little Miss Sunshine - “The Winner Is”, lol. Anyway, I like the goofy backing vocals and wry lyrics. Good lyrics about how bleak and selfish the character she portrays is.

#that was strange

**akanewasright** (10): Idk where the haters for this came from but like. Idk have better taste

**Awkward\_King** (10): this tickles my brain so nicely, it feels so warm this song feels like hot chocolate in summer

**bespectacIed** (10): As one boy, all i can say she is right and we should let her speak, men are trash. Btw alex g you are not exempt

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): my toxic trait is thinking this is romantic, sugar daddy applications in dms

**cremeebrulee** (10): overhated and for WHAT... this song is so cheeky and sweet, it feels like a cute inside joke between michelle and her husband that we’re being let in on

**daybed** (10): savage good boy is such a jam very boppy and just i always feel very happy jamming out to it

**endcreditouilles** (10): this is such BDE (big daddy energy)

**plastichaxan** (10): me too

**qazz23** (10): love the bass and synth that chugs along and the guitar outro (favorite off the album)

**reput4tionera** (10): YEAAAAAHHH!!!! LETS GOOOOO!!!!! this song is so good im shaking ass

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): No one understands modern love like she does

**vayyiqra** (10): Haters just don't like fun! Why don't you like this? It's zany, wacky, quirky. It's funny and ironic! She is making fun of how billionaires have these dumb schemes they think will save the planet or something but their sci-fi plans won't do that at all and will just leave them alive after the apocalypse all alone with nothing to show for it, Ozymandias style. It's satire or camp or whatever. Is it the pitched-up vocals you hate? Because that's really only a very small part of the song. Eh I give up, trash this if you want. I think it's great though.

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): utterly convinced these lyrics are just leaked Discord exchanges between Elon and Grimes

**ACORGIORGY** (9): We stan unhinged love songs.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): let's be honest, we'd be bullying any other artist to death if they titled their song "savage good boy"

**jay?** (9): twerkulator why lie

**n1colas valentine stan** (9): the alien vocals at the beginning never fail to startle me

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): but does a light shine on him?

**synyyy** (9): Screw the apocalypse, can I have the bunker? My parents don't approve of me blasting the speakers with Christian rock

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): Alex G's production is great on this one

**afs** (8.5): I wanna be your sh-

**imbaby122** (8.5): grimes x elon fanfic ❤️

**bo\_g\_o** (8): part of this song sounds like have you ever seen the rain

**bridgemoney** (8): Imagining Grimes calling Elon this as a form of dirty talk.

**camerinian** (8): >starts track with three seconds of alvin and the chipmunks, >effect doesn’t come back for the rest of the track, >refuses to elaborate further, chadpanesebreakfast.png

**celladonn** (8): how did she manage to make this concept sound endearing

**musical\_pyn** (8): "the chipmunk voice is good" I scream into the void

**welcome2thejam** (8): The points I took away for that weird vocal effect were almost instantly made up by the oomph of that first piano note

**jman457** (7.7): A fun time

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): ok but like truly how is this NOT about a dog?! THESE TITLES ARE SO MISLEADING

**homestarguy** (7.5): This one is cute! Love the fun stuff Michelle does with the harmonies here. Cool guitars too.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I hate the title of this song but the actual song is fine

**just\_thonking** (7.5): This being right after "Sit" always makes it sound like she's speaking to a dog

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): While definitely my least favorite from the record, this is far from a bad song. The chiptune vocals throw me off instantly every time they show up, but when they are gone the song is just as incredible as the others.

**sunsetb** (7.4): Motion to ban autotune baby voice

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): https://rave.dj/moY_kwdF9jZXmA

**1998tweety** (7): transmasc anthem

**frogaranaman** (7): me to my pet dog (evil)

**gimmeyotacos** (7): least favorite of the album because of the weird high-pitched baby vocals and how short it is but i dig the concept and can appreciate that it’s a nice lil uptempo bop in between the slower songs in the second half of the record

**quinnpsych** (7): I like this song, but I can't listen to the start without wanting to violently throw up anymore

**runaway3212** (7): me after my dog said to me: "all the rates you're doing and all the courses you're passing will never truly distract you from the emptiness inside your soul"

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I hate that filter in the beginning oh my god… literally the devil’s voice

**xxipil0ts** (7): - gatekeep this from the nft discord user

#will not be tasked to repopulate

**thedoctordances1940** (6.7): probably the least interesting song on jubilee overall and the intro is kinda annoying

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): that little voice in the beginning is so annoying

**BeauMeringue212** (6.5): I've never been crazy about this song tbh, parody songs about super wealthy powerful people aren't that novel and the lyrics aren't anything special

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): This is the Jubilee song that people really don’t like? It’s cute!

**seanderlust** (6): I am also fascinated by this concept - I am perplexed by the billionaire urge to sit on a giant pile of wealth like a dragon to be slain in a knight's tale. that being said, musically this one sticks less with me

**SmileAndTears** (6): that was definitely a song, I guess

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): this aint too bad aside from the weird intro

**you2009** (5): no one knows what it means but it's provocative gets the people going. not me tho

**apatel27** (4): What was the point of chipmunk backing vocals

**GapeCod** (4): Okay I genuinely don't like this. It sounds like a mediocre Phoenix song (with significantly better lyricism because Phoenix, lol), so whenever I listen to it I just get the urge to listen to WAP instead.

**TiltControls** (4): wow i can't believe she managed to get the chipmunks for a collab here

**CrimsonROSET** (3): This album loves to challenge preconceived notions. For example, I always thought boring was worse than offensive, and this song is here to challenge that!

**fadedblue09** (3): Is this supposed to be satire or something? God I hope it is but either way it's BAD.

**oscarbrierley1** (3): I HATE the intro, the lyrics are a bit 2000s. Stream if I were a boy and like a boy.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): girl what the fuck is this

**throwaway-7650** (1): thank god the live version exists so I don't have to 0 this

**DefaultPophead** (0): This song feels like sandpaper to my ears. Sounds bad, has bad lyrics, and has a bad music video. Easily the worst in the rate. Yes, I copied and pasted this from my r/indieheads ultimate ballot because my feelings have not changed since. How can fantastic albums like Jubilee and Blue Weekend both have huge duds ugh

#Hi steamedasparagus G

**steamedasparagus** (6.5): Hi Alex G

#do you actually want me to do this for you it’s not too late

**Posing-With-Fishes** (10): for every Savage Good Boy 0 I will bring down Be Sweet by 0.5

**Stryxen** (7): When I saw Lucy play this live, yeah it hurt a lot. I put my head down and sobbed, but I could feel the mutual understanding and love around everyone in the audience. This song is spectacular lyrically - and it doesn’t need anything more musically to make it flawless, I only didn’t give it a 10 because like, if everyone did that it would be very awkward in Winners 3.

I was considering removing this from being a must-rate in the lineup, and making it like an optional bonus thing: the point of this song is not really to rate it on a scale of 1-10, but the 5 11s this got made me glad I didn’t.

*Call me if you need a friend / or never talk to me again / but please stay*

---

#<3

**apatel27** (11): Hearing people you're close to earnestly saying they want to die and not being able to change that really is the worst

**majid** (11): it's a quite simple song, but it still manages to evoke so much happiness in me. it always gives me hope whenever i believe that i'm at my lowest and consider giving up, even when my mind convinces me that nobody is there for me. it holds a very special place in my heart :)

**reput4tionera** (11): this song made me have a genuine not quirky breakdown and i couldn’t listen to it for months. it’s just… so raw and emotional. like i don’t cry to songs a lot but this had me full body sobbing. like… wow.

**seanderlust** (11): i've decided against traumadumping in this comment because at the end of the day this is a fun pop music game on a fun pop music server but i just need to voice that this hits really hard. there are a few folks from my past that i really wish i would have said this to.

**throwaway-7650** (11): used to sing with lucy but now she's singing to me so... yeah.

**bespectacIed** (10): Yas, the designated boygenius song. I've heard like a million songs related to depression in my life, I usually think hearing another one won't move me, but this one still did. Props to flipping the POV to the one who cares for someone who self-h@rms. That bridge never fails to make me cry, the helplessness and pure love emanating in it is staggering, like there really is nothing u can do but hope that someone you love still chooses to stay.... Wtf why is this rate so heavy lol the feels are really feelsing???

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): As someone who has had…dark thoughts before, this is an extremely comforting and emotionally affecting piece of music. Thank you, Lucy.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): god this album fucking wrecks me

**homestarguy** (10): Sometimes I gotta hear this one again. Once again, what an amazing friend Lucy must be.

**imbaby122** (10): i think i’d rather be stabbed than listen to this song again but in a good way. i am a blubbering mess rn it was everything i needed to hear but don’t want to hear. my heart is breaking for my mom right now she knows that i’m suicidal and i can only imagine how helpless she feels when i’m thousands of miles away and she can’t feel secure in the fact that i’m safe. i miss her so much why did you do this to me lucy

**runaway3212** (10): not me crying

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): this song stopped me in my tracks on first listen, and the backing vocals from Phoebe and Julien pair so well with Lucy

**wailord\_fan** (10): Sad song that makes me sad part 3.

**steamedasparagus** (9.5): yeah

**1998tweety** (9): taylor swift to her bf after she threw a book at him or something

**akanewasright** (9): let me take advantage of Reddit’s spoiler feature for this bc TW suicide >!I’ve had three different friends who were actively considering suicide and/or were doing bad enough that I was seriously (and validly) worried for their lives. It’s… maybe the worst thing I’ve ever felt. Literally just waiting for them to get online or talk to someone in my circle so that I could know for sure that they hadn’t gone through with it. Writing paragraphs about why they needed to stay alive in my head, feeling stupid and helpless. I just remember trying to figure out how I could carry on with them gone. Fortunately, everyone in my case didn’t wind up going through with it/are alive now, but… yeah! I very much connect to this song, and it’s going to be hard for me when this leaves!<

**celladonn** (9): another song that makes me double over in pain, thank you lucy

**gimmeyotacos** (9): hard-hitting lyrics and a mini boygenius reunion?! i’m bullying everyone that gives this song less than an 8

**IIIHenryIII** (9): how can someone not stay after this amazing plea?

**jay?** (9): gag

**waluigiest** (9): this hurts so bad

**shhhneak** (8.6): It sucks that this experience resonates with me. I don’t wish it on anyone.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): me watching the reveal to every Snail Mail song

**afs** (8): Billie is screaming

**breadcrumbs6969** (8): heartbreaking

**CrimsonROSET** (8): GET! YOUR! LIFE! TOGETHER!

**n1colas valentine stan** (8): crying to this while my back slowly and very dramatically slides down my bedroom door

**synyyy** (8): My brain to me during this rate when Kendrick, Radiohead's side project, f+tm and MCR drop on the 13th.

**vayyiqra** (8): :hanawinsSad: These lyrics are heartbreaking and hit a lot more than most of the rest of the album with the undertones of being about suicide.

**SmileAndTears** (7.7): Evil Mitski in First Love/Late Spring be like

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this one doesn't do as much for me

**Arybeck67** (7): ouchhh again, but whatever it is, I can't help but compare the track to also Julien Baker-inspired "Graceland Too" by Phoebe

**DefaultPophead** (7): I really like the lyrics on paper, but when I hear this song it just doesn't hit. I'm sorry, Lucy!

**frogaranaman** (7): good song to cry to

**quinnpsych** (7): Omg too sad, I don't like to think about why she wrote this song

**TiltControls** (7): okay i still need to do spring cleaning don't call me out like that!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Cute but the lyrics get a bit rambly and confusing. I blame Phoebe. No she doesn’t have writing credits but I’m just gonna assume her sheer presence creates a lyrical black hole other better writers get sucked into

#</3

**jman457** (6.7): probs my least fav song on here

**Awkward\_King** (5): dont like how much this is hitting what the fuck i want to be sick

**BeauMeringue212** (5): the lyrics are very beautiful and sensitive but the melody is a bit dull and I don't like the strummy guitar part too much either

**GapeCod** (5): The "please don't make me see this things" line takes away so much merit from this song's message for me. As someone who's been suicidal for almost a decade at this point, the last thing I need to feel is implications of guilt, no matter how subtle and unintended they may be.

**oscarbrierley1** (5): yawn

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): I would leave but the next song slaps

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): well i wont. bye

Stryxen: we are playing "Bitch Please" by Death Grips in the reveal right now to break the tension.

But if we went straight into the next elimination it would be quite a lot of whiplash anyway...

**Stryxen** (10): I didn’t have high hopes for this song really, but at first I was blown away. For the first ~20 ballots, THIS WAS #7. Lord take me back.

This song is excellent - perfect to SCREAM along to, I could talk about the lyrics but seriously nobody cares, it’s all about the ARGHHHH. IT ISN’T LOUD ENOUGH, 👹PLAYTHEGREATESTHITS👹. I think I could lipsync for my life to this and win the season immediately from one performance.

**Uberpigeon** (10): Everyone seems to love or hate this song, and it’s very interesting to see the chasm in opinions. Personally I love it but I think it isn’t loud enough.

#[Let’s get loud!](https://youtu.be/ZHjuemDkZSI)

**BasedButta** (11): YEAH PUNK IT UP (note: this stole my 11 at the last possible moment)

**2dina3dworld** (10): FINALLY, true post-punk!

**Awkward\_King** (10): I HATE MY PARENTS

**hikkaru** (10): ok whew....

**homestarguy** (10): Best type of breakup song imo. IT ISN’T LOUD ENOUGH!!!!!!

**MassiveThief** (10): yeah they snapped. i'm in between headbanging and shaking mad ass.

**musical\_pyn** (10): such a nice change-up for this rate and Wolf Alice does this so well

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): why do i have a headache all of a sudden

**Posing-With-Fishes** (10): an 11 if my 11 never existed methinks

**qazz23** (10): love how it shows off their punkier side

**RandomHypnotica** (10): THE FUCKING ENERGY ON THIS HOLY SHIT LET ME LOOSE I WANNA DANCE I WANNA SCREAM I WANNA FUCK I WANNA LIIIIIIVE AAAAAAHHHHHH

**seanderlust** (10): THIS IS SO FUN OMFG. PLAY THE GREATEST HITS!!!!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I like when she yells

**UselessTacooo** (10): I feel like she’s yelling at me. It’s unsettling.

**waluigiest** (10): this is so iconic

**DefaultPophead** (9.9): One of my most played songs last year. Much like "Valentine" I love how this allows me to scream.

**synyyy** (9.5): Avril Lavigne could NEVER.

**afs** (9): independent ROCK

**akanewasright** (9): IT ISNT!!! LOUD ENOUGH!!!

**apatel27** (9): maybe being british makes this significantly better

**camerinian** (9): You reckon “it isn’t loud enough” was just an improvised lyric yelled at the producer when Ellie heard the vocal mix?

**endcreditouilles** (9): Alexa play Despacito

**gimmeyotacos** (9): this song FUCKS and i will not tolerate any slander of it

**imbaby122** (9): PUMP UP SONG ASF

**sarcasticsobs** (9): lovin’ the screams

**welcome2thejam** (9): Actual banger

**thedoctordances1940** (8.7): an absolute fucking banger, but it doesn't really work in this album i feel, like especially the start just feels like it comes out of nowhere, maybe would've worked better as an opener

**steamedasparagus** (8.5): bubblegrunge 2

**jman457** (8.2): We love a little punk moment

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): now this is the titular hit

**bespectacIed** (8): an attempt to altrock-ify Sleigh Bells was made. This is cool, I like the energy.

**bridgemoney** (8): I always like the angrier wildcard song on Wolf Alice albums (Yuk Foo on Visions Of A Life for instance). Ellie has great energy as a punk singer and I wish she could utilize it more.

**celladonn** (8): i'm headbanging

**vayyiqra** (8): Lol wtf how did we go from the last song to this practically being riot grrl. I'm not mad though, this is a jam. Shoutout to women yelling stuff over upbeat rock music. Gotta be one of my favourite genres.

**1998tweety** (7.5): not sure if I like this or not

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): me when I listen to ABBA Gold

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): my anti screamo senses are twitching a bit

**breadcrumbs6969** (7): my ears hurt, but it is fun, really intense and a nice departure from previous two songs

**Mudkip1** (7): honestly? camp

**oscarbrierley1** (7): I dont love shouted songs in general and it's a bit noisy for me. But its fun

#too loud

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): well they won't be playing this song

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): could this song belong here, the vibes are kinda different here

**hunnybee12** (6): inspired a playlist called 'songs that give me anxiety when played while i'm driving'

**IIIHenryIII** (6): this surely ain't one of them

**jay?** (6): hmmmm

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Is this what people call “real music”

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (5.5): pretty catchy, but sticks out like a sore thumb when listening to the album

**bo\_g\_o** (5): this is a bit too rowdy for my taste

**therokinrolla** (5): this was unnecessary

**throwaway-7650** (5): 500 Years Of Winter - Pizza Song by 5SOS outsold

**wailord\_fan** (5): I hate that I don't like this...

**shhhneak** (4): The greatest hit of day 1 maybe.

**BeauMeringue212** (3): it sounds very Saturday morning cartoon opening theme, afraid this isn't really my thing

**ktajlili** (3): not a good attempt at punk.

**runaway3212** (3): hyperpop but also terrible

**TiltControls** (3): well that was some whiplash

**indiefan** (2): Maybe this is why Greatest Hits albums suck

#no fun!!

**fadedblue09** (0): Was about to make them fun of them making a song with such a title but holy shit this is unbearable

**frogaranaman** (0): I never got why this song is in the tracklist lmao. it feels so out of place compared to the rest of the album

**Stryxen** (8.5): As much as i love this song quite a lot, I think it was definitely time to go a while ago, gorgeous strings and that heart wrenching vocal performance make this a massive standout on Jubilee for me, where it’s obviously not for most (bottom 3 here). I just adore it, but yeah, it was time to go. I listen to this song in the shower a lot, take from that what you will.

This song had a very uneventful rate, it received exactly ONE 0 and ONE 11, and those were within 2 ballots of each other both on the last day of extensions iirc. I don’t think this was ever not early day 2. I don’t really know what to say else. Benji where are the comments help a cohost out.

#Tactical

**bulforster** (11): [can't say it any better than this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/975588401849983013/975588472997941278/Screenshot_20220514-012025.png)

**akanewasright** (10): I know no one really cares for this song but like… ugh. I have had a relationship or two in my life where everything was awful by the end and for my own sake, I had to cut myself off from them. These were with people I really did care about, and they were among the hardest things I’ve had to do. At some point last year, my head was back in that place where I missed someone like that that I hadn’t really seen in years, and a friend of mine put this song on. I’d heard the album when it came out, but all those months later, I finally fell in love with the song and put it on my anxiety playlist. I don’t think this is my 11, because I associate it with a truly horrendous point in my life and I’ve regretted 11s of that sort before, but this song will be robbed and it will hurt me

**jay?** (10): oh i audibly yassed why lie

**musical\_pyn** (10): the most underrated song on the album imo

**plastichaxan** (10): dosing up on fiction as we speak besties

**imbaby122** (9.5): me and michelle are living the same life because boy do i relate to her having a distant relationship with her father after he moved on to have a new family. i have never had a unique experience ever.

**Arybeck67** (9): this hits a bit hard since my ex moved to Europe after we broke up so ooft, sad girl really sad girling

**bespectacIed** (9): makes me feel so soft and delicate and wanna go lie down in a fetal position

**reput4tionera** (9): you know when a song has 3/4 time signature vibes then you realize it’s in 4/4. i just had this happen

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): cross a sea wow she’s in her Moses era

**UselessTacooo** (9): Kokomo, IN ‘s sister

**vayyiqra** (9): I know this song is about escaping her toxic father and so on but I just want peaches right now. I'm tired, the song is sad. It's very pretty. But I'm kind of dying here struggling to finish this rate. Anyway I hope Popheads doesn't trash this. (They will.)

**1998tweety** (8.5): beautiful

**afs** (8.5): this track will be snubbed simply because it's less perfect

**celladonn** (8.5): this is so pretty

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): This doesn't feel like a song I'd rate very high normally, but it's just so cute and I feel mellow.

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): the orchestral intro is GIVING

**synyyy** (8.5): Here we go... again

**thedoctordances1940** (8.4): it's just like a really good song innit

**breadcrumbs6969** (8): beautiful but i liked it better before i found out what it's about

**IIIHenryIII** (8): I'm not crying, I spilled water on my eyes

**runaway3212** (8): yass strings

**TiltControls** (8): 5 year old me using my overleveled starter to beat all the other pokemon trainers

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): cute but definitely a weaker track on this absolutely stacked album

**gimmeyotacos** (7.7): simple and bittersweet

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): pretty

**jman457** (7.5): this is really sweet

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): Fire Emblem >

**apatel27** (7): The strings are nice

**homestarguy** (7): This one is pretty, if a bit long. Those strings tug at the heartstrings tho!

**steamedasparagus** (7): I skip this one too!! sorry!

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): love the strings on this one but takes a bit too long to build for me

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Aww violins that’s how you know it’s gonna be sentimental

#SABOTAGE

**BasedButta** (6.5): kinda boring but it’s still pretty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): This is pretty while it’s on but I’m never gonna seek it out.

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Lots of heart wrenching lyrics here even I feel like it's filler

**n1colas valentine stan** (6.5): ive heard this song tons of times and never managed to remember how it sounds like its just a bit too forgettable to me

**quinnpsych** (6): Honestly doesn't jump out at me ever, like i'm never like yeah let me listen to tactics. It's a good listening experience though

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): the strings are nice but if you’re gonna make a song about disliking a parent, can u make it bop more so i’m a little distracted from my own reality

**frogaranaman** (5): board game music (derogatory)

**qazz23** (5): The strings are good but not feeling much else

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i thought this album was supposed to be fun

#the whiplash of receiving the first and only 11 and 0s for this within like 2 hours of each other

**CrimsonROSET** (0): as we discussed before, the worst you can be in an album is boring. I’m sorry Akane, but I literally don’t find reason for me to come back to this in the slightest- and especially when almost closing out an album that has this as the final slump, I can’t justify this. Sometimes, the best tactic is to know when you’re doing too much.

**Stryxen** (8.5): Genuinely impressed, this song managed to escape any and all discourse, but this feels like the correct placement in that case. First the Valentine singles and now the LUCY singles… oh it’s over.

I love this song too! It took a while to grow on me but there are some really iconic lyrics in this - constantly adding to the innocent mischief alongside the confusingly mature aspects of this relationship with someone she met at Vacation Bible School. It’s a great showcase of uniquely Lucy songwriting

“Your poetry was so bad / It took a lot to not laugh / You said that I showed you the light”. Iconic, you instantly know exactly who this person is from just these three lines. And a lot of people highlight the sudden explosion of distorted guitar, which is kinda genius after “Playing Slayer at full volume helps to drown it out”. Just a stunning song, but not really too mad at this placement - it’s getting real competitive now.

#Vagina Bussy Slay!!

**ACORGIORGY** (10): This lady VBSes.

**apatel27** (10): Guess she couldn't change him

**BeauMeringue212** (10): my high-school friend used to write awful notes app poems and send me them so I'm giving Lucy a 10 for also having to go through that. Song's also good or whatever

**bespectacIed** (10): CATCH IT, AYESHA EROTICA!!! jk ayesha still outsold. But this is so vividly written, the superb storytelling comes thru again. Dealing with religious trauma is an entirely familiar topic for me, and I don't particularly enjoy revisiting that again lol but this song slays

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): the second verse was so unexpected i had to rewind, chorus was really sad to me bc it reminded me of my own experience and not being able to out myself to my parents ugh

**camerinian** (10): boy sure is a good thing I can’t relate to being a confused 13 year old having my first serious crush at a religious summer camp under the shadow of a simultaneous turbulent family dynamic and shying away from interaction as a result. Nope. Cannot relate at all. Thanks for this totally unrelatable piece of music Lucy which, by the way, I have no means of connecting with.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): as someone who was also a church kid and helped out in something that’s basically VBS, this songs resonates a lot with me. I honestly think I learned so much about myself in it, and not even about just spiritually just in general. It’s a wild world out there.

**daybed** (10): YOUR POETRY WAS SO.BAD.IT.TOOK.A.LOT.TO.NOT.LAUGH...she didn't had to go so hard

**endcreditouilles** (10): sad sluts for jesus

**frogaranaman** (10): traumatized Catholic school kids MAKE SOME NOISE!!!!!

**ReallyCreative** (10): yeah as someone who also grew up Christian in Virginia, this one makes some points!!

**reput4tionera** (10): the first lucy dacus song i heard and i was hooked i love a religious trauma moment

**seanderlust** (10): the full post punk guitar bit out of nowhere HELLO????

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Thankfully I don’t have catholic guilt in addition to all the suppressed sexuality stuff, but VBS does still speak to me a lot. Making friends with fellow freaks while the world around you tries to teach you that your existence is wrong. And the “darker than before” line just 🥺

**wailord\_fan** (10): I'm a sucker for pointed jabs in songs, and hearing the guitar kick in after the mention of Slayer absolutely kills me every time. Also: religious raised kids who realized that a lot of your childhood was kinda messed up, put your lighters in the air.

**waluigiest** (10): This song is a perfect example of why I love her songwriting. It’s understated and unpretentious but uses poignant details (e.g. “your poetry was so bad / it took a lot to not laugh”) to bring you into her world. I’m seeing her live this summer and cannot WAIT for the “playing slayer at full volume”

**shhhneak** (9.7): This is the lesbian Predatory Wasp of the Palisades

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): Lucy, why did I not like you straight away? What is wrong with me? Look at your writing. "Sedentary secrets like peach pits in your gut | Locked away like jam jars in the cellar of your heart" How was this not immediately my thing? I'm upset that I didn't write those lines. Why should I even try to be a writer? Ugh I've been sleeping on this beautiful album for too long... thank the lord that this rate made me revisit your album.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): this would've been a ten if she had gone full on rock & roll after the volume line

**Arybeck67** (9): where are my fellow VBS practitioners

**musical\_pyn** (9): playing Slayyyter at full volume DOES help me drown it out

**runaway3212** (9): The guitar in this song, im literally so gay

**synyyy** (9): Dammit I thought Lucy mentioned slayyyter and was about to cancel her for prioritising the wrong church

**jman457** (8.7): The storytelling on this track is amazing

**afs** (8.5): what a tease I was hoping more ayehsa erotica references and fewer slayer references... even slayyyter was fine

**bo\_g\_o** (8.5): I am not a religious person at all, nor have I had many experiences with religion, but that doesn't really matter because this song does a really good job at painting a picture of this troubled person who is struggling with their faith and their place in life and is going through a crisis

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Kinda wish I didn't like this so my comment could be "Very Bad Song"

**sarcasticsobs** (8.4): the blast in noise after mentioning slayer always gets me

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): I love her story telling abilities a lot

**throwaway-7650** (8.3): so this how I find out that there was a nutmeg challenge on tiktok?

**GapeCod** (8): several seasons of Only Connect conditioned me into reading this as VIBES with the vowels removed.

**imbaby122** (8): i finessed the vbs system i’d go as my friend’s plus one to the fun parties with petting zoos and water balloons so i wouldn’t have to do the bible stuff

**ktajlili** (8): this is a grower, but it's sad, sweet, and nostalgic once you listen to it a few times.

**plastichaxan** (8): ayesha erotica TRIED

**steamedasparagus** (8): shoutout first baptist orlando vbs 2005

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): I am truly so grateful I never attended a Christian summer camp

**therokinrolla** (8): Incredible idea for a song, would be a 7 if not for the incredibly clever Slayer part

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended ayesha erotica

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i think i hate the rhyming of seven with heaven in the first line but the rest of the song makes up for it. (EDIT: wait is the recurring line of "your poetry was so bad" a callback to the rhyming of the first line being atrocious because this could be fivehead...)

**homestarguy** (7.5): Cute lyrics and storytelling, even if it’s just a cheap imitation “Karma Police” instrumentally. The “Slayer” part rules tho.

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): the weird false breakdown around the end is great

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): Vagina Bussy Slay

**qazz23** (7): nice heavy guitar at the end

**quinnpsych** (7): I've never really connected with VBS, I don't know why

**RandomHypnotica** (7): his poetry's bad, but does he blame the news?

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (7): the loud guitar moment after singing about playing Slayer was a nice touch

**welcome2thejam** (7): I'm a sucker for alliteration, so that peach pits/jam jars verse? Ooooh baby

**jay?** (6): you cant put on the snail mail wig and pretend to be snail mail!

**My friend Ais** (6): (purely for the guitar bridge)

**TiltControls** (6): ew visual basic

**UselessTacooo** (6): I mean the explosion at the end is stunning, but everything else in its way is mostly dull. I just need something to grasp me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): ok i know vbs is supposed to stand for vacation bible school but i’m a weeb and therefore its impossible for me to not read it as vivid bad squad. anyway stream rad dogs https://youtu.be/ZMbWDpC1N7s

**fadedblue09** (5): Teeters on annoying

**vayyiqra** (5): Is every song on this album about religion and her childhood? Note that's okay (I listen to Sufjan lol), I'm just a bit surprised how much she talks about it on here. Idk what I was expecting.

**BasedButta** (4): yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaawn… but 15 seconds of good fallout sound at 2:00!!! why didn’t you do that for longer or for the whole song? that part ends and we are immediately thrown back into boringland, there’s just no payoff, she teases us with some electric guitars later and that’s it… girl I know you can do it just give me something!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Like the evening religious classes I went to as a kid, this is mostly boring.

**indiefan** (4): Jesus shit I had my music at a high volume why was that necessary

**Mudkip1** (0): i honestly can’t explain why I dislike this as much as I do, it feels so blah to me

**Stryxen** (10): This was probably the biggest grower on me while I was digesting these albums fully during the rate period, a beautiful ode to friendship that has been hitting quite hard recently. I just love my friends a lot and I wish I had the words to tell them that, but I just accept that they know, because of course they do!

Rate-wise, this did okay… quite a bit under average score but a middling placement, not much discourse and two 11s was nice to see! We decided this is the 3rd best closer in the rate, above Mia, but that was never changing. Let's be real.

#MY girls on the beach

**qazz23** (11): this is a perfect closer, love this shoegazey sound

**bespectacIed** (10): Ooohhh I get it now. The thundering, anticlimactic wave of The Beach connects to the gentle ebb and flow of II. This sounds more, idk, intentional and structured than part 1. I prefer this one by a mile. lyrically and sonically. Actually I love this, this is stunning. What a joyous, touching, almost reassuring ender to a thematically all over the place album (which I guess was the point, I just prefer cohesion). Fave song on the album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The sequel is sometimes better than the original!

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): a nice closing track although it is much much better in the context of the album

**cremeebrulee** (10): this elicits the same sort of cathartic feeling that posing for cars does, they're really two of the best album closers i've heard in a while. like the "it's ok" makes me feel so comforted and warm.... anyway she's so right. i played this on the beach with my girlfriends on a spontaneous trip at 2am and hearing it while watching the waves crash onto the shore in the dark with some of my favorite people in the whole world? happy ever after indeed

**daybed** (10): gorgeous closer but purrr let's go to the beach beach let's go get away

**jay?** (10): yeah take a seat babe @ariana

**you2009** (10): this and posing for cars were battling it out for my 11 like just some of the best album outros I've heard this year

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): great closer

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): Okay so this was the song that got played up by people around me to the point that it physically could never reach my expectations, and that might have something to do with how I feel. It’s an incredible song, but it doesn’t blow me away like the other songs on the albums do. However, because of how spectacular everything else on this album was, it would have been damn near impossible to top.

**DefaultPophead** (9): Much like "Delicious Things" this song doesn't feel like it deserves such a high score but I am lying to myself if I score it any lower. My confusing baby. I never want to listen to it but when I am, I love it.

**gimmeyotacos** (9): such a beautiful closer to this album. this song really feels like a warm hug

**hunnybee12** (9): revisting and rating this album is making me see it might be one of my fav albums ever omg...

**IIIHenryIII** (9): the first one is superior

**imbaby122** (9): what a closer. speechless.

**steamedasparagus** (9): it's really pretty I love it

**throwaway-7650** (9): good song but she wants to be posing for cars SOOO bad ou.

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): wonderful way to close out the album

**seanderlust** (8.6): a floaty gorgeous final note to this album. well done

**violet** (8.6): i liked this song a lot more than the first The Beach

**1998tweety** (8.5): still a damn liar

**afs** (8.5): should've named the other one bitch and this one beach, would've been more interesting~

**akanewasright** (8.5): George Lucas’s “Star Wars”. Francis Ford Coppella’s “The Godfather”. Wolf Alice’s “The Beach. All works of art improved upon by their sequels

**synyyy** (8.5): And with that, I conclude my rate!

**TiltControls** (8.5): the better beach

**apatel27** (8): Like the bookmarking in this album

**bo\_g\_o** (8): good closer

**camerinian** (8): hey do I need to have seen the first The Beach to know what's going on here

**homestarguy** (8): A little too washed out, but still a cathartic as hell ending to the album.

**quinnpsych** (8): Dreamy beach pop once again, I enjoy it

**reput4tionera** (8): this was fun

**runaway3212** (8): slay outro

**welcome2thejam** (8): Got a great "hanging with your friends at the shoreline with nobody around for miles" sound. Love the guitars too

**jman457** (7.7): Nice little ending

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): cute lil closer

**frogaranaman** (7): I mean yea lol

**ReallyCreative** (7): Not the strongest finish if I'm being honest, not enough energy

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Okay

#the beach 2/10

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): shoegaze????

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): The Beach…[2!!](https://youtu.be/MtQ9aFanWik)

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why would you make a part 2 inferior to the original i dont understand pixar

**vayyiqra** (6): :hanawinsHug:

**n1colas valentine stan** (5): i actually hate going to the beach so its on brand for me to think this song is mid... anyway glad this album is over

**kappyko** (4.5): LET'S GO GET AWAY!!!!

**BeauMeringue212** (4): bit of a fizzler as closers go

#lol

**RandomHypnotica** (10): An absolutely perfect closer, it feels like the distillation of hanging out with your high school friends for the last time before you all graduate and move out and start living your own lifes, knowing you'll drift apart naturally and find new friends, but still cherishing the moment you're in right now, safe, happy and grateful, reminiscing on all the memories you've had with them up until the moment.

**Awkward\_King** (3): i cant remmeber which of my friends stan this song but this is nothing to me so im just gonna apologise to hypno ??

**Stryxen** (8): …and welcome back Lindsey! I think we all saw this coming after yesterday. I do have to agree the vocal performance can slightly hold back this ridiculously good bassy instrumental. And these lyrics are cut-throat, it’s really good for a mindless bop as the melodies throughout are catchy as hell but you can also really delve into the lyrics, which are fundamental to establishing some themes of the album. They really show her new level of maturity in her approach to writing about relationships and heartbreak.

“You wanna leave a stain / Like a relapse does when you really try / …and damn, this time I really tried”  
 
I don’t think this deserved to go quite so soon… but I’m not surprised, a super early 0, yeah it never stood a chance. Thankfully, the rest of the album (read: 2 songs left) are SO beloved we might not be seeing her for a while…I just need the Valentine stans to have something, I’m so sorry this is happening.

---

#suckers for the pain

**akanewasright** (10): idc about her vocals I’m too busy shaking my tits

**Arybeck67** (10): the production used here is so awesome and the whole thing just captures the confusion and pain that comes from the breakup you had with someone you truly loved. Also, the lyric booklet has the lyrics "I never should've hurt you..." in quotation marks, signifying that the lines are being said by Lindsey's ex, which I think is an important contextual piece to the song. It's fantastic.

**Awkward\_King** (10): cummies

**bespectacIed** (10): A brilliant followup to Valentine. After successfully showing her maturity with the lead single, she doubles down with this boppp. She sounds so self-assured and put together, and the layering in the production is so groovy and superb, I especially creamed when the extra notes came through after the bridge. Maybe it's called Ben Franklin cuz she caught lightning and bottled it up for us.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Imagine Dragons but make it slay.

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): definitely thought it was fun, i LOVED the beat

**GapeCod** (10): the best Benjamin in this rate so true

**jay?** (10): YUPPPP

**n1colas valentine stan** (10): rent was due. the biphobia accusations were getting to her... valentine as a single was not paying the bills. she had only a few cents from lush left. she came on this bitch mad as hell !!!

**plastichaxan** (10): i wish i had the devil in me :(

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this postmaster general can slot his parcel through my back door anytime

**runaway3212** (10): such a slay sophomore opener

**seanderlust** (10): i love her voice here, especially on the cloying "huh, honey?" on the chorus.

**wailord\_fan** (10): This is such a fun sound though, and really feels different compared to Lush, which I know a lot of people didn't love, but personally I live.

**you2009** (10): I swear I mean this in the most complimentary way possible but the way she struggles to stay on pitch is what makes this song perfect to me LIKE...the angst. inject it!

**homestarguy** (9.5): This is such a cool song instrumentally, a beautiful melding of slinky guitars and synths. Plus the lyrics are so soul-bearing too!

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): this song absolutely sounds like it discovered electricity or whatever

**afs** (9): Frankie Grande gasps

**bridgemoney** (9): I got no money and I do care about sex.

**DefaultPophead** (9): This song feels like a whole novel within three minutes.

**quinnpsych** (9): The melody on this song is unreal, especially the chorus. It's groovy, and I love Lindsay's vocals throughout this album. So bratty and harsh, but this track for me is vocally the best on the album

**synyyy** (9): Cool and all but did Ben's kite ever get struck by lightning?

**throwaway-7650** (9): a point deducted for not explaining what the song title means

**UselessTacooo** (9): I love this song so much, but in this instance the vocal performance doesn’t sound unique, just mediocre. The production is a masterpiece though.

**vayyiqra** (9): This song is great, what? Why didn't anyone tell me this Snail Mail album had songs with grooves on it? That seems important.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Weirdly obsessed with the two second shot of her in the music video pushing herself up the floor and potentially getting rug burns for reasons I cannot begin to fathom

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): she’s so miserable she’s just like me fr

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): this has actually grown on me

**CrimsonROSET** (8): but what does it have to do with ben franklin

**imbaby122** (8): drooling over the bass line

**TiltControls** (8): one of my favourite skateboarders!

**waluigiest** (8): the guitar that plays in unison with her vocals in the chorus is so crisp

**sarcasticsobs** (7.9): liked the lyrics on this one

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I love the grimey sounding guitars

**jman457** (7.7): Hamilton stans are shook

**1998tweety** (7.5): ended that fad

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): lin manuel miranda count your fucking days

**shhhneak** (7.5): The snake in this video sure gets around.

**steamedasparagus** (7.5): presidential type beat

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): good hook meh rest

**camerinian** (7): any song that reminds me of Closer by Nine Inch Nails is a win in my books. Could have done a bit more with it though

**fadedblue09** (7): ok but I don't get how the title relates to the song

**qazz23** (7): catchy chorus

**reput4tionera** (7): i mean its fun

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Okay her voice is really bothering me. Like she’s singing way past her ability. Which is a shame, cause other than her voice I actually really like this one

#HUH, honey!!!!????

**static\_int\_husp** (6): realized today that I think Snail's voice sounds like a more nasaly and annoying King Princess

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (6): the chorus is pretty catchy but the verses dont do it for me

**bo\_g\_o** (5): in one ear and out the other, just like every other song on this album not named valentine

**chidi\_ariana\_grande** (5): It’s kinda interesting

**frogaranaman** (5): wasn't he like a slave owner

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): literally what does this song have to do with ben franklin

**Stryxen** (7): Oh dear, this song has suddenly grown on me a lot. Writing this 6 hours before the reveal, very tempted to rig slightly. I won’t… anyway a 7 is still a good score but I have recently realised this song is stunning. The Beach II was a much quicker grower but I realise now this is the perfect counterpart, the same strength and love in her friends’ relationships is still here, but there is turmoil and slight contempt. “Are we still friends / If all I feel is afraid? / You're not a bitch / But just a bit when you're bored” I just love this writing, perfectly sets the tone of regret and anxiety present throughout the album as she fights to find this simple love in her life.

I love lyrics like “Let others battle / We don't need to battle / And we're both shouting” you can feel her shaking her head thinking how ridiculous it is, and as she storms off - literally using a metaphor of a storm in her mind, she tries to find how to fix this easily. And can’t. “Now I'm lying on the floor / With our love off the shore / I close my eyes and imagine / I'm not there”. The building tension to that final line and the sudden cut off, perfect. It perfectly captures frustration and regret, and anticlimactically ending a fight before it gets worse. 

I’m rambling a lot - anyway this song is great, everyone who said all the album intros in this rate are 10/10s, you spilled, ashamed I did not see this sooner. This song stayed roughly exactly here the entire rate. Early-Mid day 2 is full of predictable and uneventful eliminations, even though these songs are great. Late day 2 is where it will REALLY kick off.

**Uberpigeon** (10): A great opener I think! The slow build to that pounding climax sets the vibe for the rest of the album.

#each each lets go get a wave

**GiveUpTheKingOfLimbs** (11): this song fucking rips

**2dina3dworld** (10): now this is how you do an intro

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): love the melancholic vibes

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the one thing i love about this rate is that indie artists know how to fucking open an album

**daybed** (10): the fact this is just an intro and it washed multiple artist discography

**endcreditouilles** (10): LETS FUCKING GO OPEN UP THIS PIT

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love how it keeps getting bigger and bigger and then ends

**Mudkip1** (10): this is such a gorgeous intro

**ReallyCreative** (10): Wolfcki Minalice

**UselessTacooo** (10): I have genuinely no words. I’m just sitting here in awe. Before this rate I had put off listening to this album (mostly because my friend is an annoying stan) but now I regret not checking it out sooner.

**wailord\_fan** (10): holy shit what a bop and they don't even perform it on tour :(

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): the build of this song is so magnificent as an album intro

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): Love myself a Shakespeare reference. We need more! Feed me!

**SmileAndTears** (9.5): This and Delicious Things is one hell of a 1-2 punch

**thisusernameisntlong** (9.5): I love the way this song builds up, saur good

**jman457** (9.4): What a way to start off this album, so cinematic

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): I'm also not a bitch, just a bit when I'm bored!!!

**afs** (9): what stopped them from calling this the bitch

**frogaranaman** (9): the "I'm not there" is pure chills every single time

**qazz23** (9): good opener, love how it picks up in the 2nd half

**reput4tionera** (9): this is my first time listening to this album and this made me excited

**shhhneak** (9): the way thiS BUILD UP!!

**synyyy** (9): Damn I sure hope she didn't reference Katy Perry with circling the drain

**throwaway-7650** (9): oh I love the contrast between the ^verses and the **CHORUS**

**cherryices** (8.8): see you on day one

**gimmeyotacos** (8.5): love how this song explodes at the end

**imbaby122** (8.5): perfect intro but the ending is so jarring when i listen to it outside of the album

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): the openers this rate are so good though innit

**1998tweety** (8): you're such a damn liar

**BasedButta** (8): steady rising rhythm is enjoyable

**runaway3212** (8): I fucking hate sand, it's course it's rough it get's everywhere and it's also homophobic

**skargardin** (8): great atmospheric intro to the album

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): really strong opener, just wish the vocals at the start were louder in the mix

**bo\_g\_o** (7.5): okay shakespeare nerd, i see you quoting Macbeth

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): its nice for an intro but nothing i would go back to voluntarily

**apatel27** (7): Nice opener

**camerinian** (7): OK well if The Beach is so good, then why isn't there a The Beach II??

**homestarguy** (7): More like “The Beach House”

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): good opener... :thumbsup:

**quinnpsych** (7): I have beef with how this song is mixed, and most of the album really. I can't hear anything she's saying in the verses. And generally it's so quiet. It's intentional I'm sure so the build feels natural. But it means I don't hear what's going on for the first half of the song. But actually now I think I like it now that i'm listening to it again, strong ending

**steamedasparagus** (7): this whole album is mastered really low on spotify and I hate it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A great build-up that unfortunately goes nowhere

**welcome2thejam** (7): Got a well-paced ebb and flow, and I'm not saying that as a title-based pun

#they say what they gonna say

**akanewasright** (6.5): the buildup and prompt cutoff saved this score

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): This is a good enough intro but doesn’t really hold its own super well as a stand alone song.

**bespectacIed** (6): We're only at the opener and I am whelmed. I almost went somewhere with that crescendo but it ended too soon

**jay?** (6): turn the mic UP!

**vayyiqra** (6): It's more of an intro, not a song, but it's cool.

**TiltControls** (5): this still just feels like an intro track

**kappyko** (4): let's go to the beach each

**plastichaxan** (3): this encompasses a lot of my issues with this album no i won't elaborate

**Uberpigeon** (10): https://imgur.com/a/XBOkF8P [he changed it to a 10 later]

**Stryxen** (7): I simply like this song, it even performed way better than I expected, JUST clutching top 20 and even top half of the Home Video Rankings! (even though it’s slightly below the rate average, i still think this performed excellently) 

I thought this would be quite an uncontroversial inclusion with Lucy using it to extend the Home Video era and keep momentum into the tour, but a few people definitely tanked this for being unnecessary, even if they didn’t say it :monocle_emoji:. But a lot of people loved it! So I’m glad it’s here. I think a lot of the appeal is from Lucy’s energy on this track, constantly at 100% which mirrors her childish excitement at kissing her crush, and overall it’s just a cute, innocent, and pleasant story, and a lovely tension-relieving epilogue I often queue after the album, a reminder after Triple Dog Dare that her childhood still had plenty simple moments of innocence.

And also, I WANTED TO LIVE BY A BODY OF WATER!!!!

**wailord\_fan** (10): this is SO cute, and it's not sad either. A missed connection, but ultimately still a positive experience, or at least reflectively looked at positively.

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): why wasn't this 7 minutes long and on the album!!!!

**synyyy** (9.5): This song is shorter than my predicted relationship span, and I do not know which one pisses me off more.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): maybe someone here could teach me?? 👉👈🥺

**afs** (9): my first kiss went a little like this:

**homestarguy** (9): Hell yeah, this is Lucy’s bread and butter for me: a shimmering short rocker filled with the idyllic wonders of young love. Just wish it were longer. :(

**qazz23** (9): I like the punchy power pop sound of this, nice that it's under 2 min also!

**violet** (9): yass

**plastichaxan** (8.8): too short

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): kinda sinful to make this not even 2 minutes

**n1colas valentine stan** (8.5): wish it was longer

**seanderlust** (8.5): so tongue in cheek! very charming and nostalgic

**jman457** (8.4): A nic groovy tune

**thedoctordances1940** (8.2): wait this is kinda cunt why wasn't this on the album

**BasedButta** (8): you shouldn’t have ended the song there honey you were doing so good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YaG5SAw1n0c

**bo\_g\_o** (8): it's super short but it's also super GAY and I LOVE IT

**camerinian** (8): we love an artist who, if you know even the slightest thing about them, you can work out everything the song is about from the title

**gimmeyotacos** (8): too. damn. short.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): just train with your pillow, kids, that's what everyone does

**MassiveThief** (8): short, cute, has fuzzy guitars, lesbian, LFG

**quinnpsych** (8): Too short but again, #gayrights

**SmileAndTears** (8): bisexual queen! Something something nick nelson

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Not even two minutes?? Man

**waluigiest** (8): i ordered a 7” vinyl of this song and USPS lost it

**welcome2thejam** (8): Like this as the "fun" epilogue

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I like this but it’s just so abrupt

**1998tweety** (7.5): there is so much going on here

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this is cute but it’s pretty much an interlude

**thisusernameisntlong** (7.5): I need some

**throwaway-7650** (7.5): aur... an extended version would be a 10, we need it lucy

**CrimsonROSET** (7): love some cherry chapstick

**frogaranaman** (7): cute. makes me want to kiss boys

**imbaby122** (7): TOO SHORT

**runaway3212** (7): fine I guess

**shhhneak** (7): Sadly it ends before it gets anywhere.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): gay

**steamedasparagus** (7): ha gay

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): lets go lesbians!!!

#ewwww that’s gross 

**DefaultPophead** (6.5): This was the last song I rated in this rate, and I am giving my score based on the other scores. I didn't like it as much as the songs on Lucy's album, but it was better than "Feeling Myself"

**breadcrumbs6969** (6): cute but doesn't compare to the rest of the album, way too short and sounds almost like a demo

**UselessTacooo** (5.5): bleh

**TiltControls** (5): this feels a little half-finished

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4): really forgettable

**fadedblue09** (3): inessential

#it actually raised it overall lol (don’t read too much into this)

**Posing-With-Fishes** (5): including this lowered the album’s average some more

**Stryxen** (10): Another song whose robbery just ASTOUNDS me. This is one song I am highly considering 11-ing and if it keeps flopping like this (currently at #29 (at the start of May), thankfully it rose a LOT) I will have no choice but to show my love for this. The quirky, airy but heavily bassy instrumental offers a different take on the cinematic vibe (and body-of-water motif) she has constantly used throughout her career and it can instantly conjure an image of a ship on calm waters sailing out to the horizon - her vocals are serviceable, but just as in Lush - give it a characteristically emotional, even angry flair - which she plays off as if she is trying to suppress. The self-awareness of her destructive behaviour in this relationship: “Doesn’t obsession just become me?”. “NOTHING STAYS AS GOOD AS HOW IT STARTS”. The hook is infectious and it references the melody in the verse that lets it build momentum throughout. And then she enhances this with these vocal inflections - so signature Snail Mail - “Icy cOLd come ON I LOVED youuu”. I get so happy when i get to the pre-bridge (?) with the deeper background vocals and realise I still have like half the song to go. And then in comes “So much destruction - look at what we did - that was so real - you don’t just forget”. The character she becomes in this moment is me.! She slowly adds layers of vocals over this to drown it out, and you can once again picture that image of a ship as it crosses over the horizon - perfectly ends the first half of the album, as the relationship crosses the point of no return, concluding the first half of Valentine, and immediately setting the stage for “Madonna”, who serves, politely, out of respect for the masterpiece and emotional EPIC that is “Forever (Sailing)”. I absolutely adore this song.

**Uberpigeon** (8): This is such a cute song but I just can’t help think about how good it would be with someone who could sing better. Croaky vocals have their place but

---

#Forever (Slaying)

**Arybeck67** (11): this song man. My instant 11. My first love played this song after she gave me my first kiss. Little did we know then that it would end up being an almost ironic illustration of how our relationship would end. Forever (Sailing), from its zany production, to its heartbreaking lyrics, and it's soul crushing vocal presentation, grips you and does not let you go. It forces its listeners to bare witness to the pain Lindsey feels in the absence of her lover, and her inability to let go of the love that left her. The guitar riffs at the end of the song invoke the image of a person desperately trying to let go of their grief and obsession through song. It is a masterpiece through and through, and a song that will always hold a special place in my life.

**musical\_pyn** (11): I did not expect this to get my 11, but GOD this is just a perfect song that just builds until an ever more perfecter outro. and the vocal delivery? mastah-piece

**n1colas valentine stan** (11): the way she misconstructed and redefined what it meant to convey and obtain the concupiscent anomalistic clearance showing us that idiosyncratic is ebulliently inevitable while simultaneously substantiating the superiority of women

**ACORGIORGY** (10): Top tier sad girl yacht rock, and a lovely first runner up for my eleven.

**bespectacIed** (10): My most listened song on the album, such an earworm. I love how it reminds me of oldies ballads, the production and instrumentals channeled that perfectly. The songwriting comes through as well.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It’s like I’m on a sexy, indie boat….

**breadcrumbs6969** (10): she is OBSESSED, the lyrics are genuinely disturbing

**bridgemoney** (10): Floating through space, mind empty, no thoughts, just vibes.

**GiveUpTheKingOfLimbs** (10): best indie love song

**jay?** (10): YUPPPPP !!!!!!!!

**plastichaxan** (10): i just yassed so hard miss snail delivered the yass mail and ATE

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is where I ask the hosts to play the Bastion end theme as the interlude

**ReallyCreative** (10): Forever (Slaying)

**shhhneak** (10): I’m obsessed with the rhythm and layering of this.

**steamedasparagus** (10): I'll love you from the city to the stars!!!

**sunsetb** (10): Forever sailing into my heart

**TiltControls** (10): When I first heard the album, this was the one that stood out most to me. Love the whole vibe of it

**welcome2thejam** (10): Is this yacht rock?

**you2009** (10): this boat has some holes in it but...!

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): no actually this album frustrates me because i don't ever want to experience this level of heartbreak again but also i want to be in love like this again so now what

**BasedButta** (9): great calmer sounding song

**imbaby122** (9): the melody in the chorus is so goooooodddddddd. goosebumps whenever the chorus hits but the outro is just a littttlleeee long for my taste.

**quinnpsych** (9): Groovy asf, it feels like sailing on a golden harbour. I associate this song strongly with the colour of gold. Maybe a summer thing, but it's a gold song

**vayyiqra** (9): I am once again asking why no one told me Snail Mail made songs with grooves and synths. If I had known that, I would've listened to this album before now. There's a bit of a sophisti-pop vibe here, if you've heard of that. (If you haven't, it's a bit like city pop but more laid back and also British. Seriously.)

**violet** (9): i love the retro sound of this omg

**1998tweety** (8.5): sex bop a bit

**afs** (8.5): why are there brackets?????

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): I'd play this in my non-existent coffee shop.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): probably has the best production on the album

**synyyy** (8.5): Can't be indie without sad lyrics over happy instrumentals :3

**celladonn** (8): the sample really makes this

**chidi\_ariana\_grande** (8): Why the parentheses? Couldn’t it just be “Forever Sailing”

**just\_thonking** (8): Idk why but this feels like a cover of a Madonna song or something

**qazz23** (8): good harmonies on the outro

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this is a cute enough song, but it’s a bit coffee shop.

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this has a real chill like cheesy 90s soundtrack vibe to it (note: i am just saying words)

**homestarguy** (7.5): Leans a bit on the borrowed chorus, but I dunno something about Lindsay achingly singing about an ex is compelling enough for me to enjoy this one.

**jman457** (7.4): groovy track

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she’s cute but like what is cute next to gorgeous

**UselessTacooo** (7): Why is everything and nothing happening at the same time

#Forever (Failing)

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this song goes on forever (sailing)

**thisusernameisntlong** (6.5): the outro is giving Earth Song

**thedoctordances1940** (6.4): oh no did you get lost at sea that's so sad

**apatel27** (6): Dragged a bit

**runaway3212** (6): I know this is hyped up but while I find it good it's a bit overrated

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): if this came on at a coffee shop it’d probably be pleasant to listen to

**IIIHenryIII** (5): go on and never stop to make music again

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (4.5): like the lyrics, not a fan of anything else about this track

**reput4tionera** (4): i bit my nail and accidentally gave myself a hangnail during this song. also it’s kinda boring

#Forever (Snailing)

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Why isn’t this called “Forever (Snailing)”

**frogaranaman** (6): missed opportunity for the title to be "Forever (Snailing)"

**Stryxen** (8.5): Japanese Breakfast’s ‘In Heaven’ is one of the most heart wrenching songs I have ever heard, by focusing on the small moments that make a great grief, following the passing of Michelle’s mother, real: the song opens with “The dog’s confused, she just paces round all day, she’s sniffing at your empty room.”. On 2021’s Jubilee, Zauner reprises this title, with ‘In Hell’ concerning the passing of that same dog, as the once-processed grief is eventually brought back to focus. It’s mature and detached from the situation: “No one ever tells you just how clinical death looks / and I can’t unsee it: the two shots it took.”, but there is the familiarity “With my luck, you’ll be dead within the year / I’ve come to expect it.” of old pains resurfacing and becoming fresh: grief never goes away, and each new grief is unique. While the album’s slightly homogenous instrumentals and production here leave a bit more to be desired for this song to truly stand-out, the lyrics shine on their own. 

Hard to believe we used to want to rate this album in a “light” themed rate.

#hell is this rate truly

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): This song guts me like no other

**apatel27** (10): Is it bad that my favourite track on this album is her reliving her trauma

**camerinian** (10): this lowkey might be one of the most gorgeous, devastating choruses here. I don't know if this is a fan fave or not but I really came to adore this one

**hunnybee12** (10): after i read her book i literally feel like shes my close friend. her pain is my pain. her joy makes me content. parasocial relationships are bad blah blah entertainers are supposed to provide COMFORT!!!! jubilee is the album i put on when i feel alone or stressed. michelle we love you

**imbaby122** (10): my grandma passed this year after months of suffering and medication and being bed-bound. needless to say i listened to this song on repeat to cope.

**jay?** (10): yassed why lie

**musical\_pyn** (10): maybe my favorite song lyrically on the album

**plastichaxan** (10): i don’t think an opening line hits me as much as “with my luck you’ll be dead within the year, i’ve come to expect it”... no words

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): i'm a crying mess and if it wasn't for another song this would be my eleven

**ReallyCreative** (10): absolutely brutal and beautiful

**reput4tionera** (10): sob

**throwaway-7650** (10): rina sawayama:

**vayyiqra** (10): It's weird how affecting this song is when it's about the death of a pet, something I think of as not being all that hard, and yet my cat died two years ago and I still miss him all the time. Death is fucked up, and the older you get the more of it you see, and yet it never quite becomes normal. Maybe it's because you have to be reminded that someday it will happen to you too. Either way, this song kind of fucks me up. :hanawinsCries:

**wailord\_fan** (10): HELL IS FINDING SOMEONE TO LOVE AND I CAN'T

**welcome2thejam** (10): Fits for me in the "I'm feeling a bit morose and need something sad but not that heavy to scratch that itch" category

**bulforster** (9.7): I have such specific a memory of being taken out of class by my mom when my dog was put down as a kid. Obviously this song is a direct line to that for me but in a cathartic sort of way.

**sarcasticsobs** (9.7): “this is an album about joy” - michelle zauner, a liar

**afs** (9.5): wait am I on the wrong album

**seanderlust** (9.5): "Wheeled you in, laid on your side / I cried and cried and at my signal/They stopped your heart and then you died" - an album that is apparently about joy

**1998tweety** (9): oml these lyrics

**BeauMeringue212** (9): somebody said that Jubilee is a happy album for sad people and I think the bright poppy production on this track next to the extremely bleak lyrics makes a great case for that

**breadcrumbs6969** (9): lyrics hit me reaaally hard

**oscarbrierley1** (9): love most of this song, but some of the 'yous' sound off to me

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): hell is doing all the indie rates in the voting form (not 2018 Indie Pop though she's hot)

**akanewasright** (8.5): me when this goddamn rate gets revealed

**homestarguy** (8.5): Should call this one “In Laurel Hell” since this sounds like a long lost Mitski track.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): that's not how your music feels like

**synyyy** (8.5): For goodness sake Michelle this album is supposed to be about being happy :'(

**TiltControls** (8.5): hell is watching slumber party win against anti and lemonade

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): people claiming jubilee is a happy album… then what is this!! what the fuck is this!!!!

**gimmeyotacos** (8.2): there’s a 50% chance that i’ll cry whenever i hear this song

**Arybeck67** (8): the production is so sleek on this track

**BasedButta** (8): im emotional abt this one… but what if it went longer and had a little more oomph to it? I would just die, but not before upping it to 10

**bespectacIed** (8): the better 2021 song about a dead dog

**bo\_g\_o** (8): heavenly

**DefaultPophead** (8): My dog is very ill and this makes me very sad. I am on a library waiting list for Crying in H Mart and that will probably make me very sad, too.

**fadedblue09** (8): Very immaculate, nostalgic sounding

**qazz23** (8): this is sad :(

**quinnpsych** (8): The melody in the chorus reminds me of something from my childhood. Don't know why

**steamedasparagus** (8): Death bopz

**thisusernameisntlong** (8): me when the quarantine hit

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (8): love a melancholic track with more upbeat production

**violet** (7.8): she spilled with these lyrics.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): sorry Michelle, I get that this is sentimental and all but it’s pretty average

**thedoctordances1940** (7.4): omg it's where the people who have given paprika a 3 are

**frogaranaman** (7): hell sounds vibey

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): im fed up of this song but it had its moment

#what the hell!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): castiel after confessing his love for dean:

**just\_thonking** (6): closer to purgatory imo

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s meh

**jman457** (5.7): Mid for this album tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (5): but what degree of hell because like I’ll be fine

**runaway3212** (4): in hell TK keeps telling us "all rates have been chosen and all host have been contacted" but then they never get revealed, also you would be forced to wear ugly itchy sweaters.

**Awkward\_King** (1): i think this is where the cohesion of the album actually becomes something i dislike because this has no elements that make me like it that aren't already in all the other tracks. i don't think it detracts from the album, it just is not necessary for me and i do not care for it.

#this is about a dog

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Dreading having romantic feelings of any kind? Relatable.

**Stryxen** (6): I just can’t assign a number to this song, simply breathtaking. I just don’t think it deserves to win, and could have pictured this placing anywhere in the results… but this seems fair enough.

These lyrics are stunning, and honestly so is the instrumental. I usually skip this in the album, but only because it’s too much to handle. As a piece of art it more than stands up in its own right and shines among dozens of other gems in Lucy’s discography.

#get it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Shoutout to all the shitty, bigoted parents out there. Burn in hell.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (11): Holy shit, what a song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i dont think there are any words that can properly describe the emotions i feel listening to this

**waluigiest** (11): I knew this would be my 11 before starting the rate. The first time I heard this song, it touched me in a visceral way and every time I listen to it I get chills. Maybe it’s tapping into my own uncomfortable relationship with my father. She lets her writing dominate, with the ethereal background swelling to accent her emotions. It’s get violence, sadness, humor. Maybe its biggest songwriting success is the parallel structure of holding the father’s/friend’s face in her hands… masterful!!

**1998tweety** (10): ill admit I prefer Thumbs Again cause of the energy but WOW this song is absolutely haunting. "I imagine my thumbs on the irises, pressing in until they burst", wow what an absolutely graphic line.

**apatel27** (10): What a cathartic track

**babadork** (10): I really love “Thumbs Again,” so I might be inflating this score slightly. This is still really great, but “Thumbs Again” is perfect.

**bespectacIed** (10): VISCERAL. Trauma dumping and love bombing maximized their joint slay. When this was released as the lead single, I knew this new Lucy record is gonna be one for the books. Trult, the lyrics are so fucking visceral, heavy, powerful. Trauma is a bitch and it's easy to feel violent about it, and realizing that the secondhand anger lucy has in behalf of her friend/lover only shows her pure love, dayumn. Brb gonna break down again

**bo\_g\_o** (10): this song... i have no words

**camerinian** (10): good luck with your funny little meme comments for this one, you heartless fuckers

**celladonn** (10): her storytelling has obliterated me

**CrimsonROSET** (10): immaculate songwriting of the rawest form. even if you don’t really like how slow the album is, I think this is the peak of the album holding back for you to focus on the stories she has to tell.

**daybed** (10): the picture this song paints in your mind, of her wanting to be there for this one person she obviously cares about so much so that she is willing to do anything for them.

**frogaranaman** (10): my friend has one of the promo VHS tapes for this song and Lucy quote rt'd him tweeting it to share photos he took of the night Julien and her met 😭 anyways ty for putting me onto Lucy, if you read this you know who I am I've told you my reddit user before lmao

**GapeCod** (10): Thank you for showing this song to me, /u/wavingwolves, I cherish that moment very dearly.

**gimmeyotacos** (10): where all my ladies with daddy issues at?

**homestarguy** (10): Hooh boy. The pain oozes through Lucy’s voice over a pretty but incredibly sparse instrumental, a haunting combination. This one still causes me to freeze like no other song can.

**jay?** (10): gag

**quinnpsych** (10): I mean just story telling at its best. It's haunting and beautiful and terrible and sweet and morbid fuck i love this

**ReallyCreative** (10): her ability to calmly convey rage is inspiring

**reput4tionera** (10): jesus christ

**runaway3212** (10): yass queen slayyy that man

**sarcasticsobs** (10): masterclass in lyrics

**seanderlust** (10): lucy is so fucking funny why did she promote this by sending it to fans on a VHS tape? who the fuck has a VHS player???

**throwaway-7650** (10): in a rate full of fantastic songwriting, this is the 11 by far lyrically

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): excellent, excellent song. delicate and devastating at the same time

**wailord\_fan** (10): AH sad song that makes me sad part 2

**welcome2thejam** (10): Lucy is an outrageously good storyteller

**xxipil0ts** (10): - I always try to avoid this song just bc of how dark it is. I love how detailed she talked about her feelings.

**Arybeck67** (9.7): ouchhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

**songbirdskeepsinging** (9.5): the storytelling in this album is just perfect

**TiltControls** (9.5): kyoto 2 fast 2 furious

**DefaultPophead** (9): I felt like I was right there with Lucy, both digging my nails into her knee and getting my knee dug into.

**kappyko** (9): I think I might be the only person who was literally recommended to listen to this song by their own father LMFAO

**therokinrolla** (9): eyeballs bursting eyeballs popping imagine shoving your thumb into a mans eyes until they literally pop

**imbaby122** (8.5): this song makes me feel safe. my father is an asshole and whenever he manages to speak to me he just makes me feel bad for never talking to him. so true lucy i don’t owe him shit.

**SmileAndTears** (8.3): yasss murder ballad

**afs** (8): godDAMN do NOT mess with the photograph lady

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Honestly, I used to find this song so boring sonically and didn't get all the praise it gets, so I decided to imagine it playing during a murder scene on a show and then it hit me

**plastichaxan** (8): i gave this a “5 not feeling her” and idk what i was thinking lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I get what she means, but one thing that’s always kinda bothered me about this song is that there’s like no explanation as to what’s so bad about the dad. I’m not asking for a verse detailing his every abuse of her daughter, but like the only thing we see as listeners is him trying to be nice if a bit awkward, and her just getting super uncomfortable. Obviously it’s realistic that someone doesn’t want to talk about sensitive topics such as this, but in the realm of songwriting it just kinda feels like a disconnect, between this father who’s trying to be kind and get closer with his daughter and Lucy who’s just all “I WILL GOUGE YOUR EYES OUT YOU ASSHOLE”

**jman457** (7.7): something about this song doesnt gel with me,has good atmosphere though

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): i bet there's a section of twitter that thinks wanting to kill your partner's estranged daddy is hashtag relationship goals. my people!!

**just\_thonking** (7.5): The evil henchmen from Spy Kids be like

**synyyy** (7.5): Without the vocals, this could be another track in one of Poppy's ambient albums that no one checks out.

**violet** (7.3): the ocean sounds yasss!

**bridgemoney** (7): Plot twist: The choking turns her father on.

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): the way she wants to commit manslaughter good for her tbh id help her hide the body

**vayyiqra** (7): I was kind of expecting to hate this song after seeing the lyrics and how weirdly violent the are - that seemed so out of character for Lucy and kind of uncomfortable. For a second I wasn't sure why she would write something so edgy. After reading about the story behind the song I can see now she was just being honest and saying what she felt at the time she wrote it and she was upset. Aside from that, it is musically, a pretty song. I like how quiet and ambient it is.

Stryxen: 
#I feel wrong dragging this song

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): Lyrically, this song is great… but musically, it just isn't doing it for me, it feels lacking. Thumbs Again does a better job of filling out the song for me, and I understand why people would resonate with this one, but it's just not for me.

**Awkward\_King** (6): fuck you and your phoebe bridgers ass daddy issues lyrics

**shhhneak** (6): “Bound to him but it’s all relative” I love wordplay so much.

**breadcrumbs6969** (5): lyrically beautiful but instrumentally boring and slow, i can't see myself relistening to it at all

**bulforster** (5): I think this is just too much for me

**hunnybee12** (5): the eye imagry made me shudder a bit

**thisusernameisntlong** (5): .db

**thedoctordances1940** (4.4): i'm sorry i just find this pretty fucking boring

**jackisboredtoday** (4.3): the only song on this album where the specificity and detail strikes a weird note for me. I appreciate why people like it but this one has a certain kind of intensity that just leaves me uncomfortable

**ACORGIORGY** (3): The first time I heard this, she played it live when she toured on the 2019 EP. It was jarring then, it's jarring here, and the reworked version of it is jarring again, too.

**fadedblue09** (2): At the risk of sounding repetitive, I just don't think she has a strong enough voice to be doing stripped down songs, and it'e even more apparent since this is acapella

**oscarbrierley1** (0): I guess if you like this kind of thing it might be ok. It's a no from me though. It's just not interesting or catchy at all

#me if we ever rate hard drive by cassandra jenkins

**Stryxen** (8): I really like this song but I’m not too bothered about this cut, I think day 3 would be a bit of a stretch when it kinda blends into the rest of the album in a rather unflattering way for me. By itself - love. In album context - a bit underwhelming. There are some ridiculously fun moments - like the first verse rhyming scheme: “tentative / into it / sensitive / adjective / suggested it / sedative / good at it” building up to a massive release of “you don’t like me? WELL THAT ISN’T FUCKING RELEVANT”. It’s somehow so corny but delivered so genuinely that it’s just good fun and remains endearing.

Also I believe this is the first Wolf Alice single cut? Congratulations on having the most correct single choices of all the artists in the rate.

#smiling laughing playing having fun

**cremeebrulee** (11): i was gonna 11 a jubilee song but i realized at my core i am an angry person and not a happy one . also this goes so hard and will be robbed, it needs all the help it can get

**akanewasright** (10): this is so guitar hero vibes omfg

**apatel27** (10): A good 90s throwback

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This song makes me feel like I’m going through some light jokerfication but yassified.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this is what r/indieheads thinks rap music is

**ignitethephoenix** (10): oh she snapped, I love an angry woman

**oscarbrierley1** (10): the instrumental is so catchy

**qazz23** (10): really like the vocal delivery and chorus

**Arybeck67** (9.5): I love the vocals on this track and the way everything is said, it's divine

**synyyy** (9.5): Pro tip: use the shoegaze sound like how you would use a smile.

**homestarguy** (9): Damn do I like nu-metal now???

**imbaby122** (9): this song is for my deranged and unhinged moods when i feel like tearing sheet metal apart with my teeth

**jay?** (9): i give my 9s where i see fit!

**MassiveThief** (9): goes hard. the little tritone synth line that comes in the background right before the chorus hits is such a small detail that means so much. in general the transitions between sections are so well done.

**n1colas valentine stan** (9): FINE it bangs

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (9): typically not a fan of heavier rock but they pull it off really well on this track

**vayyiqra** (9): wait this is a banger

**jman457** (8.7): The 90’s alt girl vibes are off the chart

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): this is still groovy as fuck and sure it's not the most representative of the album but its so slay

**camerinian** (8): I can’t tell if this would go the fuck off live or if it would be seriously underwhelming as you all lose the subtleties

**GapeCod** (7): Wish she stopped doing the whispering voice.. This is like a top 5 track in the rate without them

#rolling eyes, hating. bitch BYE

**wailord\_fan** (6.5): the hook is killer, the verses bug me though.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): fuck around fake smile

**Mudkip1** (6): a heavy metal moment

**BeauMeringue212** (5): I was getting hyped when I first heard the intro but I kept waiting for a burst of angry energy to come and it never did

**musical\_pyn** (2): I just...do not like this song at all--there's SOME artistic merit so I won't give it a 0 but, yikes

#[RATE]???

**just\_thonking** (9.5): Better rapping than Jack Harlow

**bespectacIed** (9): Another serve, hold the fuck up, wolf alice keeps giving me the smack cam. Punk, on my indie rate?? The lyrics are very fun.  And the Doja Cat flow on the verses, tell me I'm not tripping cuz wow...

**1998tweety** (9): did not end Avril but still a serve

**IIIHenryIII** (8): smile by Avril and by Lily are much better songs, go stream them, but keep on streaming this one too

**thedoctordances1940** (8.6): this just sounds like if poppy were british

**UselessTacooo** (8): Wait this isn’t a poppy song?

**breadcrumbs6969** (8): sorry but the lyrics are kinda cringe, sounds like if lizzo were to make an empowering indie rock song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): serving Suicide Squad soundtrack

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): this is Wet Leg’s millennial wine mum lyricism but without the tongue in cheek humour

**kappyko** (5): this is like an illuminati hotties song that can't commit to the bit of going hard the entire time

#only 3

**TiltControls** (9.5): katy perry comment count guess - 6

**afs** (9): can we manifest Katy Perry releasing a track like this

**runaway3212** (4): outsold smile by katy but nobody else (this is a hint to the host to play lily allen in the rate reveal)

**Stryxen** (10): I don’t really know where to start with this elimination. This was #2 for the first 20 or so ballots, so when this started rapidly dropping around the ~60 participants mark, I was just shocked. It hung around the #12-14 region for a moment and I lowkey hoped it got a tank to push it into day 2 so I could vote it for songeniality - which I already have, and the form will be posted momentarily. I really don’t understand why this is a day 2 cut. This song is simply stunning.

There are SO many things I love about this song, but I would especially like to highlight: "Lines between lines between lines that you read about yourself" and then "Lies after lies after lies but do you even fool yourself?" honey that is poetry. I also love how it starts so soft and quiet as she explains to this man all his wrongdoing but when she accepts "and when your friends are talking you hardly hear a (WORD)" then the song builds and channels into pure force until she's just letting him HAVE it and he has no choice but to listen. She was fed UP. Sometimes I imagine I’m the man to humble myself.

I really thought we would be sending this to All Stars :sob:

**Uberpigeon** (10): What can I say that has not already been said. A manhating slowburn synthy ANTHEM. A beautiful explosion of sound makes this such a rewarding listen and I’m not surprised it’s the raters’ favourite (Other host note: Last Man on Earth was a winner contender for a while lol, idk what happened actually)

---

#Krystal i’m so sorry you don’t deserve this

**DefaultPophead** (11): This is one of my favourite songs of all time, so giving it my 11 was obvious. The song inspires me to write every time I listen to it. It was my first Wolf Alice song I heard when it was first released, and the album became my most streamed of last year. I have so much attachment to it.

#have not stopped thinking about this comment

**akanewasright** (10): I fully heard the line as “the only thing you should be asking for is head”

#dislike of, contempt for, or ingrained prejudice against men

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Only one man left on the Earth? This is the popheads dream.

**bo\_g\_o** (10): god what a fucking massive amazing ballad, werewolf alice really knocked it out of the park here

**daybed** (10): this was the first song i listened by Wolf Alice and honestly i couldn't be happier that this was my intro to them. What a gorgeous song the way the chorus just comes in...amazing!

**frogaranaman** (10): when do I send this to him

**hunnybee12** (10): im too lonely for this tonight

**IIIHenryIII** (10): it's the obvious choice, but I'm a basic dude (that was my 11 from the very beginning until I forced myself to change it; it was a tough decision, but I wanted to show my appreciation for Lucy)

**jay?** (10): like.. WOWWWW....

**plastichaxan** (10): this kinda washed all their other songs i almost took the 10 from those but they all get the original scores as a treat to wolf alice for this being so good

**reput4tionera** (10): oh they absolutely ate

**runaway3212** (10): this slays so much

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): let the Wolf Alice light shine on you

**TiltControls** (10): I don't think about this one enough, which I should change cause it's actually fantastic

**tip-of-the-yikesberg** (10): another one of my favorite tracks of 2021. the exceptional vocal performance from Ellie and the gorgeous ascending instrumentals still give me goosebumps when listening

**UselessTacooo** (10): even as just a ballad I was fully prepared to give this a 10, but when it built I literally went into shock.

**gimmeyotacos** (9.5): this song is so pretty omg

**homestarguy** (9.5): Loved this one a lot last year, though not quite as much now. Still an achingly beautiful single, even if lyrically it’s a bit played out. That little bridge is such a nice touch.

**imbaby122** (9.5): don’t mind me just sobbing and screaming and pissing and shitting

**just\_thonking** (9.5): Did anybody else watch that Will Forte TV show... feels like a fever dream

**afs** (9): was thinking of giving it a low score because b*llad but it picked up!!!

**Arybeck67** (9): this is the song that made me listen to the whole album back in 2021. The long pauses in the music that build up to the epic ending at the end are amazing

**celladonn** (9): love the way this builds

**ReallyCreative** (9): drag him girl omg

**synyyy** (9): sad piano noises

**thedoctordances1940** (9): yeah

**violet** (9): lovely song

**BeauMeringue212** (8.7): The other song on the album that struck me. Very beautiful for a takedown song about a male narcissist

**throwaway-7650** (8.5): the lullaby version appeared in my release radar!

**jman457** (8.4): Nice climax of the album

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this goes in the christian bops grab bag

**MassiveThief** (8): I will let the light shine on me, thanks Ms. Alice.

**qazz23** (8): a bit slow to start but a good ending

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): It was cute at the start but I really liked it when it got all Beatles-y

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i think ellie could sing anything to me and id believe it. like ok. no more men on the earth. i am not here. goodbye.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): where are Will Forte and Kristen Schaal

**breadcrumbs6969** (7): nice but doesn't do anything for me until the second half, i never would've guessed this was the first single

**n1colas valentine stan** (7): shes alright

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): ok the second half was really good

**vayyiqra** (7): :hanawinsCries:

**welcome2thejam** (7): Will Forte outsold

#men

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): this song just never did it for me… call me balladphobic idc

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): sounds like a lana b-side until the beat comes in. It then gets weird in a good way.

**steamedasparagus** (6.5): I don't like it!

**bespectacIed** (5): overrated tbh... I didn't know why this was the lead single. Theme wise it's alright, Walter White complex, I get it. I'm just not gagged by the lyrics nor the production.... The back half of this album is indeed mid, I've made up my mind now.

**kappyko** (4): ok ballad becomes overstuffed rock nothingburger

**ACORGIORGY** (0): This is irredeemably boring.

oscarbrierley1: 1. Posing for cars
2. Kokomo, IN
3. Hot & Heavy
4. Paprika

This is less of a prediction and more wishful thinking, they're fine songs but they don't hit as hard as the other remaining songs.

itsallgood69: Wtf, Tactics was so robbed. I should have done this rate just to try and get that song a higher ranking
[/r/popheads/comments/uuspnv/2021_indie_girls_rate_reveal_day_2_swaying_in_the/i9htcqg/]

=====

bespectacIed: Jbrekkie dominance as expected. Not mad there, if someone deserved their flowers, they should get them.

Lucy half-robbed, but the right songs are still in. Gonna keep quiet because my jinx is ALWAYS strong and hmmmm okay imma keep quiet now

Snail Mail murder. No words. Y'all will pay. Y'all are on the wrong side of history

For all my Wolf Alice slandering I really think Delicious Things and Lipstick on the Glass are excellent 10s. My only beef is with that overpraised single that has the most trite, granola, chicken soup for the soul production and lyrics ever hnggg

GapeCod: I'm ditching snail mail for songeniality because you somehow let Thumbs go out day 2.. Bullshit tbh
