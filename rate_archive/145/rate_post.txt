>*"Lucidity came slowly*  
>  
>*I awoke from dreams of untying a great knot"*

One of indie’s favourite indie sadgirl darlings decided she was too sad and not darling enough, and made the best album of 2021. (note: i am an unbiased host i promise)

After 2 albums and 1 best selling memoir of exploring the grief of losing her Mother, Michelle Zauner put her sadness away (for like 3 tracks at least) and went full upbeat art pop all over everybody.

Jubilee is, according to Miss Breakfast herself, about *Joy.* And joyful it is, in all its forms. The rush of performing to an audience, being a billionaire bunker boy, and putting down a beloved pet. Wait, that doesn’t sound very joyful! Well… More than joy, jubilee is about *trying to be happy*, and all the bittersweet emotional journeys life can take you on to reach that goal. It’s relatable, it’s transportative, and it's transcendental.

It’s a phenomenal album. Her dream-pop and shoegaze roots have blossomed into grand string and horn arrangements, and groovy synth hooks. Her inimitable vocals are better than ever, and she can still shred the guitar when she has to. It’s Japanese Breakfast at peak performance, and a total career defining moment. This is the album that needs the least introduction, ranking highly on popheads’ various end of year shenanigans. If there’s anyone new to this album, I think you’re in for a huge treat, and if not, I hope you have a great time revisiting the masterpiece that is Jubilee.

>*”Being back here makes me hot in the face*  
>  
>*Hot blood in my pulsing veins”*

*Home Video*, the third studio album by Lucy Dacus, was announced on April 13th, 2021 alongside the release of single ‘Hot & Heavy’, a nostalgic head-banging anthem with intense lyrics that everyone with a single childhood memory could obsess over. ‘Hot & Heavy’ makes the perfect entry point for *Home Video*, a loose concept album narrating an overwhelming visit to your hometown - where each and every turn brings back a vivid memory, all constituting a scrapbook of an album.

The three other singles continued this story in the lead-up to the release of the album: ‘VBS’ (standing for ‘Vacation Bible School’) contextualises her experience as a queer woman growing up in a religious family. The official lead single ‘Thumbs’ tells the story of a meeting with her friend’s negligent father, whom she swears to kill for the pain he caused her loved one - this song was played at shows for a while before its official release, but Lucy requested the audience did not film it, due to the emotional toll it took on her to record. The narrative of pre-release singles came to a climax with the fan-favourite ‘Brando’, which I can describe as nothing less than a cathartic bop, verbally dismantling a pretentious ex-friend of hers for his annoying behaviour and representing her finally leaving the situations which were mentally damaging to her as an impressionable child.

As her third album, *Home Video* is a successfully ambitious project: it truly has it all for sonic and thematic diversity united under a complete concept: First Time… horny twerk anthem; going going gone and partner in crime… intimate lofi bops, even hyperpop production, with Triple Dog Dare… acting as a prog-folk epic that brings the album in a cyclical narrative. Home Video was immediately adored by fans of Lucy and the boygenius cinematic universe - being somewhat of a spiritual successor to Phoebe Bridgers’ rate-winning *Punisher* from 2020 and ranking in popheads top 25 albums of 2021 (at a humble 21)!

Lucy’s career has definitely been building up to this album, and still she shows no signs of slowing down - with the release of ‘Kissing Lessons’ this year, a loose single to support her globally sold-out [couch tour](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/935651800978165850/941759780417060874/image0.jpg), which we have decided to include in the rate - since it also received a lot of love and fits comfortably among the *Home Video* canon:

>*“Let’s go be alone where no-one can see us honey.*  
>  
>*Careful in that room, those parasitic cameras,*  
>  
>*Don’t they stop and stare at you?”*

Lindsey Jordan (of moderate Snail Mail success) began writing material for her 2021 sophomore album *Valentine* in 2018, coming off the success of her sudden breakout debut album *Lush*. Navigating life, suddenly thrust into the spotlight and on a constant demanding tour, she began a more withdrawn approach to her stardom and career: a perspective that decided the direction of the lead single and opening track ‘Valentine’, released on September 15th 2021. The opening lines of the album are direct in establishing the effect the attention of her newfound fame had on her personal life, particularly the breakup central to the plot of *Valentine*. The second single, ‘Ben Franklin’ was released a month later, catching us up to date with the most intimate corners of her personal life, specifically her semi-hiatus accompanying almost 2 months in rehab. This experience clearly inspired much of the subject matter of *Valentine* too:

>*“You wanna leave a stain?*  
> 
>*Like a relapse does when you really try*  
>  
>*...and damn, this time I really tried”*  

*Valentine* is clear, condensed, and concise; a stark contrast to the overwhelming emotional toll *Lush* took on Jordan, [cannibalising her emotional songwriting capabilities completely](https://pitchfork.com/features/interview/snail-mail-valentine-interview/). Her characteristically emotional vocals are still present, but with a definite improvement since the charmingly rough performance on *Lush* that gave it such an intimate personality. Even the stunning cover art shows a different side of Snail Mail - pastel colours and neatly dressed, ready to deliver her thoroughly planned take on heartbreak, years in the making. This album is, above all, a break-up record, focused on discovering the balance between the desire to improve herself during this experience, while finding comfort in her self-destruction. She discusses honestly and with a self-awareness that doesn’t alienate the listener, but does not glorify her substance abuse.

Critics (myself included :) ([benji probably wants me to clarify this is not one of his writeups](https://imgur.com/a/Qhz2EvP)) loved the album, even receiving a [Best New Album (8.5/10) review from Pitchfork](https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/snail-mail-valentine/), and for good reason! *Valentine* represented a risk, with a change in sound from her universally adored debut, pivoting towards stripped down acoustic album cuts that support the poppier stand-out singles - it’s a dynamic that lets each track on the album breathe and inherit their own personalities, spawning many fan-favourite songs throughout its 10 song, 35 minute-long tracklist:

>*"Do I belong here?*  
>  
>*The vibes are kind of strong here"*

Wolf Alice are a British rock band composed of 4 members, none of whom are called Alice. They are composed of multi-instrumentalist frontwoman [Ellie Roswell](https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/Ellie-Rowsell.jpg) and guitarist [Joff Oddie](https://media.gettyimages.com/photos/joff-oddie-of-wolf-alice-performs-on-stage-at-finsbury-park-on-june-picture-id991118318), who formed the band, and were later joined by bass player [Theo Ellis](https://www.expressandstar.com/resizer/mFjtADEAU4CIi10zG05QfsFXpKc=/1200x0/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/mna/ADYC2CWD3NFEBLMOK6S7IMSD2M.jpg), and Drummer and backing vocalist [Joel Amey](https://www.smallstepsproject.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Wolf-Alice-600x400-w.jpg). For the sake of this rate, however, we will be pretending that it’s just Ellie because “Women of indie rock (and also some men because in wolf alice)” doesn’t have the same ring to it.

A fixture in the UK’s indie rock scene since their debut in 2015, Wolf Alice’s 3rd studio album Blue Weekend is the band digging in their heels and declaring that they are here to stay. And rightly so! The bar was high after their critical smash Visions Of A Life, and after an extended quarantine in a music studio the band birthed an album very much on par with their excellent discography.

Blue Weekend explores a different sound for the band, trading the noisy rock production for more sweeping synths and ethereal vocal arrangements. Of course, the band still hasn’t lost their trademark Wolf Alice eclecticism: the album is a rapturous rollercoaster that ping-pongs its listener from scrappy pop punk tracks to emotional piano ballads. The album was received, as is usual for Wolf Alice at this point, to great critical acclaim. (except from pitchfork and melon but they are nerds and losers!) They were nominated for a mercury award, and actually won a BRIT award! [much to the ire of Mixers across the nation](https://twitter.com/jadespotato/status/1491155474288607234). But the flop mercury award who cares about that? The real mark of quality is what our beloved raters think of them! And I hope you little dears have a wonderful time listening to my favourite album of 2021.- Benji aka Uberpigeon

* You can give one 11 and one 0 **across the whole rate**, so save them for your absolute favourite and least favourite songs in the rate. These are completely **optional** so don’t feel you have to use either if you don’t really love or hate any track that much!
* Comments are *generally* not required but we really encourage you to leave them if you have something to say! Point something interesting out, share a story, or make a joke and be shady or silly. If we like your comment enough we may feature it on a banner that we will post when that song gets eliminated >:)

**Your scores and comments should be formatted like this:**

>Partner in Crime: **2** against humanity

Formatting like this will not work and your ballot will be rejected:

>Headlock: More like a head-lock for bottom **"1"**  
>

* If you have submitted and want to change any scores at any time, **DM me** with your new score and/or comment and I will be happy to correct it!  

* **Please don’t sabotage** with your scores just to help out your favourite albums in the rate - it’s completely fine if you dislike a song or even an album, but if your averages are extremely disparate without justification in comments, we will ask you to add comments explaining your opinion.

We can’t wait for all of your tasteless ballots and horrible horrible opinions and would be so grateful if anybody who sees this took the time to go through the rate, even if you haven’t heard a single album yet!

That’s everything, have at it! ~~Due date will be sometime **early-mid May**,~~ and there will be a reminder post shortly before it but we will probably be very annoying promo-ing this, so the earlier you get your scores in, the quicker you can escape us!

## DUE MAY 14TH
