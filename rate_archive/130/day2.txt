**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): Easily my least favourite song from Tourist History, this song just kinda exists. It's pleasant, but I’ve never had it saved and I don't really feel much but some light joy when it's on. To me, this sounds the closest to where they took their sound on Beacon, but it's still too underdeveloped to be interesting, especially as the closer to such a high energy album. This could’ve swapped places with any number of Day 1 tracks and I would’ve been fine.

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): I’m shocked that this snuck its way into Day 2 because it’s just so lackluster to me. Tourist History was better off closing out the album with either ending up Eat That Up or Kids, because this does not match the energy of like … the last five songs in the tracklisting. Something this unmemorable should have left yesterday.

---

## **stubborn (adj) - antonyms include docile, obedient, submissive**

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is one of my favorite instrumentals like…ever

**Stryxen** (10): i sing this and i become northern irish, his accent showing up constantly is saur cute

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this song never gets old by the 15th time

**modulum83** (9): i don't know how this works as a closer but hey another banger from the cinema club boys they just don't miss

**throwaway7650** (8.5): nice closer but not among the best on this album

**BeauMeringue212** (8.2): I like the lyrics here too, they're very earnest.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): I wrote a bit of what was just nice embellishments in the instrumentation: great shredding guitars that remind me a lot of What You Want, as well as a nice kick that -... uh, kicks in, in the chorus, interesting little skips in the percussion during the bridge. I don’t think this track is like, the best thing to end on or anything memorable, but it’s still again, a solid enough track that makes me know that I had a good time overall on Tourist History. Just like the record that houses it, the closer is not a masterpiece or anything, but it’s undeniably enjoyable.

**bbfan132** (8): fun outro!

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): kinda great

**ctatkeson** (7.1): Not really to my taste, though I liked it

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Surprisingly upbeat for a closing track?

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.9): A good beat, a good chorus.

## **It's getting old by the 15th time**

**fadedblue09** (7): Kind of an average closer to an awesome album

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): This just kinda ends?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I am not stubborn and I'm also not that impressed.

**jman457** (5.3): Alright

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): See the comment for Undercover Martyn. Pretty much the same here.

**runaway3212** (5): very bland compared to the rest of the album

**Uberpigeon** (5): girl take it ur therapist idk i dont wanna hear it


## **I got you**

**GapeCod** (9): Creme pls come up with an earth signs joke for me.

## **Capricorn Placements**

**frogaranaman** (10): I would actually like to disagree and say that I am indeed stubborn and there is nothing you can do to change that

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i dont know how to feel about this being the capricorn song i feel somewhat attacked

**TiltControls** (8): am so

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): lies. i am

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I am very stubborn but I did enjoy this song.

**plastichaxan** (7): maybe i am what do you know man

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): that’s where they’re wrong

**Awkward\_King** (6): yes i fucking am bitcj

**intl\_orange** (4.5): No, I really am

**cremeebrulee** (10): No I’m legitimately screaming at how many people showed up for this one. Please look at the rank graph for this one, this song has legit been through it ALL. I’m gonna hope that its small crew of 11s enjoyed this song for the same reason that I did— because it’s an example of an instrumental interlude done well, one that has an incredibly tense buildup and a perfect resolution— and not just because this is the only song without male vocals on it 😭 As iconic as it is for making Day 2, I’m glad it’s leaving now before it beats too many of the other songs.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): aww man, we really tried huh? I'll be honest, before the rate started, this was my least favourite track. I'd written it off as nice but fluff and kinda filler on the album. But seeing so many passionate comments about it really made me want to give it another listen, and I *get* it now. The way the track builds is absolutely fantastic, and it's absolutely deserving of all the praise it got. Unfortunately, it was doomed from the start as both the longest track in the rate, AND fully instrumental, but the fact that it made it to Day 2 at all is impressive. If you enjoyed this track, i HIGHLY recommend listening to the title track from their next album, [Bankrupt!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gNZ4xpMGoO4) because it has a very similar feel, while also having a better payoff imo

---

## **Y'all kind of legendary for this**

**jman457** (11): Y’all are gonna do this song so dirty, and I wont stand for it. Like the first time i heard this it floored me

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Sometimes I don't like indie rock as much as other genres. I tell people it's because it can be pretentious. Anyways, I am fully aware I am a hypocrite because I'm giving the one instrumental track my 11

**throwaway7650** (11): such a pretty track, the way it builds in the 5+ minutes is just amazing and it stood out so much on my initial listen of this album. the intro noises reminds me of a soft video game instrumental, like pikmin or something (actually this entire song could totally be background music of a long cutscene). then all the various elements come in: the acoustic guitar, the bass, whatever sound(s) that synthesizer is responsible for, etc. it's all so satisfying as they all join together in harmony. that section at 3:30 *really* reminds me of some of the solgaleo/lunala themes from the gen 7 games. then the drums kick in right before the 4-minute (stream hot issue!) mark.. whew. this song is a whole *experience* and I love it

## **Vote for VG Instrumentals next cycle!!**

**1998tweety** (10): ascending

**2dina3dworld** (10): after having to listen to the indie voice for like 30 songs having an almost purely instrumental song was heaven for the ears

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): So, I actually think on its own this song is really cool, pretty eccentric and spacey and yet still pretty straightforward with how the beat plays out. Kind of daring to have this kind of instrumental track in the tracklisting - so early in your album too! - but it’s a lovely track by its own with how the ever so slightly plucky guitars tickle you against this steady stream of synthesizers. I do think, however, there is a major problem with this song: it doesn’t really gel, with the rest of the record, but on the other hand, perhaps it’s not exactly supposed to gel with my pre-conceived notion of the record, and to give a little bit more of an introspective flair to the tracklisting. Either way, it’s a fantastic song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): ahhdasdasjkdkjas

**camerinian** (10): I know y'all are gonna underrate this for being an instrumental and honestly that's a damn shame

**CrimsonROSET** (10): a purely instrumental track! I’m sure popheads is gonna love it!

**frogaranaman** (10): incredible, makes me want to drive to the beach with some friends and have some sparkling white wine together

**GapeCod** (10): Shoutout to the #rates regulars giving this track their 11s, must be one of my favorite genders.

**Hulnia** (10): This is gonna get robbed because it’s an instrumental, but it’s definitely top 3 on this album.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is so cool, I don't agree with every choice made (I wish the part around 3:20 was longer for example) but all the different textures make for something really unique and interesting to listen to

**plastichaxan** (10): justice for instrumental tracks!!! i promise it’s not shade that this is my top two, i love many songs this rate but this is just incredible; the buildup, every sound in it is just :chefskiss:

**runaway3212** (10): This for all those people that said god I love Chromatica II but I wish it was 5 minutes long

**seanderlust** (10): i fear this will be done dirty because it's a five minute instrumental but my GOD it's beautiful

**Stryxen** (10): i do love an instrumental moment

**xavieryes** (10): this song is beautiful and fantastic, an 11 contender, I really hope it doesn't get tanked for being an instrumental

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.1): it really does feel like a sunset

**modulum83** (9): i'm an instrumental track truther

**welcome2thejam** (9): I know it will be robbed as an instrumental interlude, but God what a mood this exudes

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Knee-jerk reaction was just “what am I listening to?” but I’m glad I gave it a second chance because it’s actually a very nice soundscape

**intl\_orange** (8.5): Pretty like a sunset

**ctatkeson** (8.3): Interesting song, definitely a change of pace.  Really enjoyed certain parts of it

**akanewasright** (8): The ending is *chefskiss*

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): I consider this and Part 2 one big song really. This track just builds, and builds, and builds, and build, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds, and builds. Yet, it's really a satisfying listen and the most experimental song on the album.

**thedoctordances1940** (8): The classic Phoenix long instrumental song and yeah, it's good.

**Uberpigeon** (8): I like this as a build-up its a good track!

**vayyiqra** (8): bleepbloop

**waluigiest** (8): it almost feels out of place on this album, but it’s so cool

**bbfan132** (7.5): definitely feels like a long interlude but it’s a pretty one!

**broppy** (7): poppy's note: i kinda want to disown him now wtf

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Not gonna lie the intro sounds slightly like a washing machine jingle when it finishes it’s cycle. Other than I really like the build-up it has. I could feel the anticipation. Way too long though.

**skargardin** (7): The drums saved this from a lower score I fear

**bridgemoney** (6): Both parts of this don't really do much for me.

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): It's a pretty good interlude

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I guess instrumentals don’t have to totally suck

## **People with low attention spans**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I'm sorry I'm a basic b*tch and I need vocals.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): there's a part 2? 😩

**SmileAndTears** (5): where are the vokels?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): this sounds like an iphone ringstone stretched out to 5 and a half minutes long. takes nearly 4 minutes to sound even remotely interesting which is way too long of a wait for an instrumental.

**celladonn** (4): Look it's nice but I really feel like this 6 minute instrumental kills the momentum of the album a bit

**ebooks #5454** (4): is this just noises... its 5 minutes .... i feel like i'm on a mission ... i dont know what you would want to use this song for

**LilacDaffodils** (4): Honestly it made me a bit anxious the way it kept building for so long. I am not a huge instrumental person though.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (4): the first three songs were catchy bangers and this is a snooze in comparison

**Brendon-Urine** (3): i guess it's nice but an instrumental seems out of place on an album like this?

**dicahprihoe** (3): not really a fan of songs like this, same goes with part two

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): I never really was fond of this song when it first came out, but my mum really liked it so I heard it a lot still while I was around her, and it eventually grew on me. Listening back now, I love all the little details going on here, this song is just so, dare i say it, *camp*.

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): My token “oh it’s THIS song” moment in the rate. I was obsessed with this song when I was younger, but I think in the context of the other songs included here, I can’t say I love this one as much still. I can’t deny how iconic it is and I’m glad it’s getting a revival on Tiktok.

## **I can be anything you like**

**1998tweety** (10): king

**agentofscranton** (10): one of my best friends sang this at a talent show and he was SO bad you guys he was terrible and I had to lie like a liar to his face when he complained about being robbed as if his voice didn't crack on every note

**Awkward\_King** (10): god if i could 11 this

**camerinian** (10): I’m so glad TikTok picked this back up as a trend. This is high-key a camp classic and a karaoke staple.

**celladonn** (10): We need more pop this theatrical

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): Iconic song, let's rate a Mika album!

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is lowkey theater kid but it's fun so I don't care

**GapeCod** (10): Belb stanning this song but hating the main rate is hilarious.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Why does this sub just ignore Mika? He’s literally everything we’re always begging for, he has great music, stage presence, looks, and he’s gay + hot as hell. We need to rate this album.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): MIKURY

**kappyko** (10): ok mika is NOT indie im sorry!!! but this is a smahss but wgere are yougn ethe GIANT

**skargardin** (10): Grace Kelly antis do not interact

**vayyiqra** (10): When this song made it big, I didn't care for Mika since I wasn't yet fully pop-pilled. I was a fool. This is a classic.

**waluigiest** (10): I was OBSESSED with Mika in high school. I checked out all of his albums on CD from the library and burned them to my itunes. Another potential 11 had this been in the main rate.

**LilacDaffodils** (9.5): Pure joyful catharsis. I feel like I can let go when I feel this song and melt into an pool of feeling.

**teenwitches** (9.5): the tiktok cover of this is horrendous but i won't let it ruin this song for me

**akanewasright** (9): This grew on me HARD

**BeauMeringue212** (9): Such a fun song, and Mika's voice is amazing

**thedoctordances1940** (9): i probably wouldn't like this if it weren't for nostalgia

**TiltControls** (9): iconic (also someone come up for an idea with this album please)

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (8.3): Great song but it brings up bad memories...

**Brendon-Urine** (8): this is where that god awful tik tok audio comes from, SO much better in this song than hearing it ad nauseum over some boring ass story

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This song and album honestly made 2007 for me. The fond memories of my step dad and I singing this in the car with the windows down where the days fam. They were the days.

**seanderlust** (8): the flair on "freddy" is such a nice touch

**ctatkeson** (7.5): Had for of a musical sound to it.

**intl\_orange** (7.5): it's as if The Beatles had been concentrated into an adorable buttercream frosted cupcake with rainbow sprinkles that is transported to you by a unicorn

**throwaway7650** (7.5): oh this guy was on yours truly... it'z camp I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): so this is who duetted with Ariana on Popular Song

## **I can be hurtful**

**modulum83** (6.7): it's a bop but it smells like the bad parts of 2010 tumblr

**bbfan132** (6): hm… not my favorite, kind of bores me

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This is always a track I forget exists on WAP, but as soon as I listen to it I remember why I have it saved. The verses are kind of lackluster though if I'm being honest, but the whole track just has such a sweet undertone to it, it's hard not to love it.

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): This genuinely sounds AI-generated Phoenix song LMAO. I will say the production sounds super adorable but I think the lyrics are a bit too bare for me to really love this. (*Misheard Lyric:* Die and succeed // *Actual Lyric:* Oh wait, those are the actual lyrics I did not expect that sdjfhkjsd)

---

## **Hey, hey, you, you, I could be your girlfriend**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I feel like there's a few songs on this album with this specific feel and this is the best version lol.

**frogaranaman** (10): god throwback to when I was pretending to be straight

**plastichaxan** (10): i don't approve of heterosexuality but this bops

**xavieryes** (10): Avril wishes she could be this good

**runaway3212** (9.5): So nearly perfect but a bit too short to really pack a punch for me

**2dina3dworld** (9): imagine having love

**camerinian** (9): I could listen to that synth oscillate for my whole life

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9): My love of this song has been increased by the WAP mashup I heard to this lmao. But it's a sweet indie rock and synthy number, reminds me of the band Spoon. Very winsome and sweet!

**vayyiqra** (9): : (

**IIIHenryIII** (8.4): don't call your girlfriend "girlfriend", it sounds gross. Just go with the basic, "darling", "honey", "babe", or if you're trying to exhibit your "dominance" and toxic masculinity, "b*tch"

**ctatkeson** (8.2): Nice poppy, surreal sounds

**bbfan132** (8): kind of blending in with the other songs but when all of the songs are good, it’s ok

**jman457** (8): Spike Jonze has been real quiet since this dropped

**kappyko** (8): omg they made a song about what you will never have

**throwaway7650** (8): solid track, really digging the production. underrated this initially

**akanewasright** (7.5): I love the guitar line here

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): gay

**GARjuna** (7.5): really gives the vibe of a summer breakup

**CrimsonROSET** (7): wellwellwellwellwellwellwellwellwellwellwellwell

**GapeCod** (7): [Hosts, take notes :waiting2:] (https://generated.inspirobot.me/a/1DerDlYnP0.jpg)

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I work retail and I didn’t realize how many straight women still casually refer to their female friends as their “girlfriend”

**modulum83** (7): what if this song was called Boyfriend and it was just for the fellas

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Okay

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): One of the better tracks of this second half, with a nice pre-verse melody and being able to nail this sort of dreamy-ish, kind of carefree atmosphere, but to be honest again, the song kind of suffers from the vocal performance being all over the place and the song’s energy just in general not being taken anywhere. It’s not a bad track at all but it’s just not really something I would be dying to listen to again.

## **Single**

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): i like the guitar riff but the rest of the song falls flat for me

**BeauMeringue212** (6.2): Nice melody but the song kinda fizzles

**daythreeinmiami** (6): This song does slightly blend in with the album and it reminds me too much of ‘1901’ and my brain is wrinkled.

**ebooks #5454** (6): it sounds like countdown but worse

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): One of the more lowkey tracks, almost sounds like a lullaby at times and really is the most somber considering the lyrics. I never was a fan of it when I first listened to the album, but appreciate it a bit more nowadays.

**Stryxen** (6): can’t relate i don’t even have friends

**Uberpigeon** (6): wapfriend outsold

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I think the main flaw with this album is that it becomes a one-trick pony after a while, and this song suffers from that fact the most

**musical\_pyn** (5): maybe the most poppy of the songs on this album, doesn't do much for me though and just kinda of ends without doing anything

**welcome2thejam** (5): Sounds like a generic version of themselves. Mind you, that still sounds good, but it also doesn't standout amongst stronger material

**RandomHypnotica** (10): another elimination that REALLY stings, and it's another of my favourite Passion Pit songs in general. The build in the pre-chorus is actually phenomenal and is a total rush, and the breakdown after does not dissapoint. Lyrically it hits exactly where it needs to, the synths and bleeps and bloops are catchy and addictive, it's just great fun. For a large majority of the rate, this was the 2nd lowest track on Manners and I was just totally stumped, so I’m glad to see it at least get a little bit higher.

**cremeebrulee** (9.9): The first song from Manners that I’m sad to see go. The production here is immaculate, the lyrics freeing, and when it builds up to that the instrumental portion in 1:25 … I ascend. I genuinely am shocked this did so poorly, it feels like a project highlight, and honestly outsold some of the singles on this album.

---

## **Grooves in your brain**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): free pc check

**frogaranaman** (10): YOU NEVER HAVE TO CHOOSEEEE

**GapeCod** (10): If I had a nickel for every time folding was brought up in this rate, I'd have two nickels. Which isn't a lot, but it's weird that it happened twice.

**kappyko** (10): me when i fold my hands or whatever

**omgitskebab** (10): angsty and pop and explosive i love it ughhhh

**seanderlust** (10): when the synth eighth notes kick in >>>

**Stryxen** (10): this feels like going through a portal to a world where everything is so y2k indie vibes :skull: :butterfly:

**xavieryes** (10): this production is simply incredible

**camerinian** (9.5): this was the deep cut bop I was waiting for, oh my god that groove is impeccable

**plastichaxan** (9.5): crazy how no other song this album comes close to it

**ctatkeson** (9.4): Overflowing with creativity! Boundless energy!  What a drop!!  Sounds like the sound of a jet engine was even used.  How does he put all these sounds together?!

**1998tweety** (9): bawp

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): Oh man this song’s electronic influences really carry this song, don’t they? I really love just how this one is able to, again, kind of balance out its more laid-back, whimsical atmosphere with its more dancier aspects. The tempo on this is a little quicker but I really enjoyed how the progression of this song plays out.

**bbfan132** (8.5): love how maximalist the production is

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): Wall of noise, but in a good way

**jman457** (8.4): Loved the breakdown half way through

**throwaway7650** (8): this also has solid production throughout like the track before it but the vocals are becoming a problem again unfortunately

**welcome2thejam** (8): Hell yeah baby feel it rain

**modulum83** (7.3): the song was mid until the wacky glitch breakdown then it became worth it

**akanewasright** (7.1): the instrumental after the chorus is SO good… the rest I don’t love

**ebooks #5454** (7): LEAVE ME ALONEEEE YES!!

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): This song just turns into a jam midway through, it's fantastic with it's bass synth groove and I love those little high pitched xylophone type instrument that appears at the end of some lyrics.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): the least best song on the album

**Uberpigeon** (7): hand folds?

**2dina3dworld** (6): smooth hands for someone with a smooth brain

**daythreeinmiami** (6): The one has some influences that you would hear in PC music in the 2010’s. Passion Pit were ahead of the times.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i liked the little breakdown after the first chorus

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): go off I guess

## **Leave ~~me~~ this song alone**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I like the instrumental on this one but not really a fan of the vocal melody.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.1): I bet this goes hard at a concert. In my room, not so much. Good instrumental touches, but the catchiness I'd usually want from the synthpop genre is not here at all for me.

**runaway3212** (4): a lot of noise and barely any of it good

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): horrible vocals, some terribly layered production and a weird drop? yeah this is not a good song

**fadedblue09** (2): That instrumental breakdown is highkey unbearable

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): And so, the last bonus track is out, and for a track that wasn't actually available to a majority of participants in the rate, this did surprisingly well! I wanted to include it, because it's always been available in the deluxe for me, and I grew up listening to it with the album. It works better as a closer, in that it still manages to have solid hooks and energy, just in a way that calms you down from earlier tracks. It's just an all around solid bop ~~that should've been swapped out for You Are Not Stubborn on the tracklist~~.

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): This is akin to Broken Jaw for me; they’re both bonus tracks I hadn’t heard prior to this rate. Kids is fun and definitely a better closer to the album than You’re Not Stubborn was, but I think it doesn’t have the same charm as the other tracks on Tourist History. I will admit it’s pretty funny to hear Alex shout about his kids, like ??? aren’t you still a teenager or something lmao???

## **Soccer moms**

**IIIHenryIII** (10): outsold OneRepublic

**CrimsonROSET** (9): talk talk talk baby better walk walk walk baby

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (9): Never heard this one before since it's not on spotify but it slaps

**kappyko** (9): WHY DO YOU TALK SO LOUD i wish i had a good mp3 of this

**musical\_pyn** (9): one of the best choruses on the album, and the ending is spectacular

**TiltControls** (9): oooh this is fun! wish it were on the main album

**bbfan132** (8.5): a bop, shouldn’t be just a bonus track!!

**throwaway7650** (8.5): a bop but I can see why this was delegated to the deluxe tracks

**ctatkeson** (8.3): I like this one.  Interesting sounds!

**2dina3dworld** (8): the rest of the album comes off as a twenty something just vibing and then there’s this track about a custody battle or whatever. Very off-putting

**Brendon-Urine** (8): too good to be just a bonus track >:(

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This is a good way to close the album. The chorus is catchy and the bridge to the end is dramatic. It’s exactly what I want in an album closer.

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (7.6): Thank god the album's done now! Bonus points!

**1998tweety** (7.5): the end was nice

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): , Help, this is actually kinda good?! Is this off of Spotify in my country cuz Big Spotify wants to hide TDCC's best song?!?! The Truth if Out There! Where were they the rest of this album?????? Dynamic chorus, lead singer doesn't sound too bad. We did it, "kids"!

**runaway3212** (7.5): I hate kids (the little people) that's why I dedicated my part time job to working with them

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): i like this

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Perhaps it’s because of the Youtube version of this song, but this song maybe doesn’t sound as full or as complete of a package as the rest of Tourist History, but it definitely does sound like it belongs, lol. Soft start after the instrumental intro, really cool bridge and lovely guitar work, abrupt ending: sounds like a tried and true formula that’s probably good enough for the record. Just maybe not as fond of the vocals, even compared to the rest of the album.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Good but rather short

**jman457** (6.9): A bit Bland but catchy

## **/r/childfree**

**fadedblue09** (6.5): It's... a bonus track alright. Lowkey annoying but the solo slaps

**plastichaxan** (6): another stance of kids ruining stuff i see

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): This song bounces some more than others here, but still really just recycles the same sounds.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I feel like I've already heard the better version of this song multiple times on this album.

**modulum83** (4): karen took the fucking kids

## **I think MGMT has a song called Kids too??? I'm not sure actually, can someone confirm**

**Stryxen** (10): mgmt found murdered, literally dead, they died, people died at the indie pop rock rate reveal

**frogaranaman** (10): this isn't MGMT

**ebooks #5454** (9): this is giving MGMT Kids a light jog for its money

**Hulnia** (9): Not them stealing MGMT’s title, their impact. 😩

**Uberpigeon** (8): mgmt outsold

**GapeCod** (7): All along the western front people line up to recite the lyrics to the wrong MGMT song.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): when can I give Kids by MGMT a big fat 10 already

**RandomHypnotica** (10): A song I actually hadn’t heard before the rate, but WOW was I missing out! I’d listened to Crown on the Ground before, but as this had the higher stream count, we decided to put it in the rate instead and I was not disappointed! It’s a track that was truly ahead of its time, and you can easily see the influence it had on parts of the hyperpop scene, with the overblown production, booming drums and the overall abrasive feeling of the track.

**cremeebrulee** (9.3): In addition to Pandora, I feel like the other music platform dominating at the time was 8tracks (note: never mind, I have been informed this was only a North American platform). Either way, that playlist site is how I discovered Sleigh Bells, when someone put Crown on the Ground on a playlist for a character I was a big fan of. Their sound was so different from anything I heard at the time, so I checked out more of SB's stuff, including Rill Rill. This song is noisy but never intrusive, and the "have a heart" hook is just sooo catchy. I’m glad that many of you enjoyed it as well and hopefully, it inspires someone to submit a Treats rate ASAP!!

## **Has a heart, has a heart, has a heart**

**bbfan132** (10): yes. excellent sampling use

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): this whole album is incredible

**frogaranaman** (10): when I heard this live I think my brain melted and reformed

**IIIHenryIII** (10): love on first listen

**intl\_orange** (10): and by ten I mean ten million, or, about how many plays I've given Sleigh Bells' first two albums on Spotify

**jman457** (10): I religiously played this song for years

**musical\_pyn** (10): if I could give this my 11 I would

**plastichaxan** (10): (11): Sleigh Bells more like Slay Bells stream Treats (and Texis)

**Stryxen** (10): i was expecting to be like who the hell is this but then it slayed

**Uberpigeon** (10): i used to send this to all my friends because i thought it was SO amazing when i was like 15 and they all reacted like :I so it makes me happy to see people enjoying this song now! i shouldnt have let teenagers gaslight me into thinking it was bad.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): wiat this is..... cute

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (9): There are like four songs on Treats I would have given a ten to. I never understood why everyone else likes this one

**waluigiest** (9): I’d never heard it but it’s neat!!

**welcome2thejam** (9): God, their sound on that first EP and Treats was out of this world. Still has ripples being felt in the music scene today. (Also, they released an album this year that's the first I've heard from them since the song Comeback Kid, and it might end up on my year-end AOTY list, so check it out)

**modulum83** (8.5): cunty as hellllll

**throwaway7650** (8): am I a flop for recognizing the sample :soobcry:

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I don’t really know what this song is about but I like it

**ctatkeson** (7.9): Hmm first listen.  Sounds pretty good.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): she’s cute, but what’s cute next to gorgeous

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): I really like the vibe of this one. Feels like something you'd be listening to walking on the street in NYC or something, which is funny since it's called Sleigh Bells.

## **/u/plastichaxan's hit list**

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): not the music video description saying "currently featured in the iPhone 5C ad campaign"

**GARjuna** (6): not rly their best track but it isn't bad

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This feels louder than it probably is.

**thedoctordances1940** (4): it's just irritating

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this sounds more like a demo for a song than an official release

**vayyiqra** (3): I thought I would like this band but I kind of hate this song. Even though it's not a heavy song at all, it still sounds like it's trying to be loud and in-your-face for no reason, with the guitar being way too high in the mix and the drums way too boomy. It's weird. Maybe this is a grower but I strongly dislike something about this.

**fadedblue09** (2): not for me sorry

**2dina3dworld** (1): if I could give this a zero I would

**daythreeinmiami** (1): I really DO NOT like this. I feel like I need to be really high to get into this.

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): This and FIYH leaving today (and so close together) make me feel the same way :( They’re genuinely two of my favorite Manners deep cuts. I love the change of sound in this one, it makes it feel so much moodier and pensive, and fits perfectly with the lyrics of feeling lost in a relationship.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): OK I SWEAR I'M NOT GONNA SAY THIS FOR EVERY PASSION PIT SONG.... but WOW does this hurt! One of the most emotionally resonating and devastating tracks on Manners, this one has always been a favourite of mine, the haunting strings, the delicate piano, and Michael using his lower register all combine to create a beautifully haunting and despairing song. Again, for a long time, this was an early day 1 elimination, so I’m happy to see it at least make it to mid day 2, but it still deserved more honestly.

---

## **🏊🏊🏊**

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): See when this album’s songwriting and catchiness is on point, it really does actually shine through in moments exactly like this. This is probably the hardest song to fault, for how sincere it sounds even through its hopelessness in the lyrics. I just like how the instrumentation comes together on this song too, from the way the percussion kind of bounces ever so slightly and the violins that come through near the outro of the song.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Ooooohhh that violin has the song starting off strong for me. Yeah. This is a good one. I am feeling this. I’m so annoyed though. I just don’t get how the first two songs were so, bad, but then become amazing? Cause this song is amazing.

**frogaranaman** (10): THE RIVER IS OVERRUNNNNNN

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): great intro, great imagery, great metaphor, great beat, great instrumentals, great vocals, great outro, great song, great band, great everything

**throwaway7650** (9.5): oh wow, beautiful intro and tolerable vocals. I love the instrumentation/production throughout, I appreciate the lyrics too

**bridgemoney** (9): The slower, more moodier song on the album but still a bop.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): more like “lost in the sauce”

**kappyko** (9): why did god punish the fish of earth with a flood

**omgitskebab** (9): evokes so many feelings

**runaway3212** (9): yeah this is a smash

**ctatkeson** (8.7): Feels like I’m drowning.  Definitely a sadder/more surreal song.  Love the descending synth over the chorus.  Adds a feeling of despair.

**bbfan132** (8.5): super relaxing

**ebooks #5454** (8.5): a fan of the violins in the bgm

**CrimsonROSET** (8): who cares about lyrics just vibes

**2dina3dworld** (7): …advocating for unsafe swimming practices? That’s a flop, right there

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): I'm appreciating this more because Michael's voice has toned down a bit more. Sounds like a good indietronica take with some added reverb.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): I love the intro with the orchestral bits transitioning to the piano melody and drum samples. Listening the lyrics and apparently this song was about a hopeless relationship. I never really realized how somber a lot of the lyrics on this album really were till now.

**BeauMeringue212** (6.8): .Like the singer's lower register here

## **Drowning**

**jman457** (6.6): started off good, and then it got boring :(

**modulum83** (6): i'm sorry but like if this was sung by a white man with an acoustic guitar it would be So annoying

**Stryxen** (6): swimming by kkb outsold vote 2018 indie pop rate

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I would like it more if it didn’t sound like he was struggling to reach some of those notes… *I thought I feeEEELT your touch*

**TheQueenofVultures** (4): Some reviewer once said Passion Pit is the musical equivalent of a sweaty hug that goes on too long and that's kinda this song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): I'm just kind of bored.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this puts me to sleep

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): In a rate full of the most commercial-core songs imaginable, this song manages the impressive feat of being THE most commercial-core. Between the hand clap percussion, the repetitive chorus, the whistling and the weird creepy baby laughs, there's a LOT going on in this song, but it's undeniably catchy. Whether you makes you bop your head, or drives you insane is another story.

**cremeebrulee** (8): I used to skip this track on my Torches listen prior to this rate because I just thought every other FTP song outshined it. It felt a little childish, but I think I gained a bit more appreciation for it after … making a [rave.dj](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XDmKpmZLlm4) mashup of it and Megan Thee Stallion’s Don’t Stop. Yeah, I wish I could say I had another reason I like this song now, but it’s really only because of this 💀

---

## **Don't stop, pop that cat, mhm mhm**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): maybe we do stan abusive relationships?

**frogaranaman** (10): why the fuck was the music video just them doing donuts

**GARjuna** (10): wow I love this album??

**IIIHenryIII** (10): do you even have good taste in music if you don't like this song?

**kappyko** (10): the one-two combo of ciwyw and dont stop exudes a glamorous luxurious music video involving swimming pools and cash thrown everywhere

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): *whistles*

**runaway3212** (10): Im like not sure if this is actually good or if my brain just released the dopamine from the coffee i had an hour ago

**xavieryes** (10): Originally the only song on the album I didn't like, but then it grew on me insanely and eventually joined the other tracks from Torches among my most listened. The MV is also iconic.

**1998tweety** (9.5): bop

**TiltControls** (9.5): It's grown off me a little since I've first heard it, but still a bop

**ctatkeson** (9.4): Another long time favorite of mine.  Gives me lots of energy.

**modulum83** (9.2): makes me feel like i'm a 8 year old that found the open adderall bottle on the counter

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Shaking my ass to this but I wish it went somewhere

**xxipil0ts** (9): Give me Smallpools' What's that a picture of? energy

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Maybe call it Stockholm Syndrome but while I found this song’s main melody extremely grating at first, I’ve again grown to accept it as just, being the way the song is supposed to be - I mean, there is the whole idea of innocence and childhood involved here, so I guess it makes sense. But once I accepted this, it’s kind of undeniable that this is just so darn catchy that I can (almost) ignore most of its flaws. Yeah the verses are kinda mediocre to bad, the production still gives me mixed feelings in how light and airy it is, but I still find myself just jamming to the chorus so hard that nothing else quite bothers me.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): The bridge though

**seanderlust** (8.5): let's be real, if these lyrics were from a melanie martinez song we would all drag them

**2dina3dworld** (8): this sounds like a song for commercials but like a good one like the Countdown song

**bbfan132** (8): i feel like i’ve heard this but idk where i heard it…

**vayyiqra** (8): A litmus test for if a song is good is when it has whistling sounds and is still enjoyable.

**waluigiest** (8): I do like this song, but I always forget it is different from Helena Beat and Call It What You Want

**Stryxen** (7.5): this song is just so car advert vibes

**jman457** (7.4): Damn did they use every song on this album in like every commercial in 2012-2013.

**plastichaxan** (7): me, during the first 3 songs: “why do people dislike the vocals so much they’re fine”... me during this one: “ah, that’s why”

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): to quote As Told By Kenya: it’s ANNOYING but it’s a BOP

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): not sure why they thought it was necessary to add the evil slowed down baby laughter at the end

**thedoctordances1940** (7): it's kinda bopping but also some annoying vocals

**welcome2thejam** (7): The laughing section gives me massive "(nervous laughter) what the fuck" energy and is also the best part of the entire song

**fadedblue09** (6.5): I think this was used in an Axe commercial or something. Kinda Imagine Dragons lite (non-derogatory)

## **Please stop**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is catchy but kind of repetitive.

**camerinian** (6): even at age 14, this one felt a bit too Ford Commercial for me

**daythreeinmiami** (6): This is probably my least favourite song on the album mostly because it sounds too much like a car commercial song. And funnily enough this song was actually used in a car commercial in my country.

**ebooks #5454** (6): one two buckle my shoe the remix

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): The sound of this track is nice and I love the acoustic guitar mixed in here. If you listen and read along with the lyrics, it's actually a really sweet song about relating childhood things and how much he loves his girlfriend.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): When I found out this annoying-ass song was actually a Foster the People song not gonna lie I lost a little respect for them that day

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.4): My Foster the People experience so far is liking a song at the start and then a weird vocal tic gets under my skin. The majority of this song is really good, but those "yeh yehs" again that haunt me are sooo bad to me, unlistenable.

**SmileAndTears** (5): Please do stop

**GapeCod** (4): I may have overplayed this? I used to love it quite a bit, but by the time the rate has begun I was already sick of it.

**musical\_pyn** (0): I just question almost every single creative decision made in this song, but ESPECIALLY the insane baby noises that randomly pop up and completely take me out of the song

**throwaway7650** (0): the horrible whistling at the beginning... and the "yeah yeah" right before the chorus is AWFUL. the chorus itself is melodically catchy but the annoying vocals are back after a brief break with CIWYW. and were those... BABY VOICES right after the chorus? and whatever the hell those noises are before and during the final chorus is my 13th reason

**cremeebrulee** (10): This is literally my most played TDCC song because it’s just THAT catchy. I have no idea what the fuck this song is even about, all I know is that those “AH OH AH AH OHs” have deeply infested my brain because this sounds just as fresh to me as it did in 2010. I’m not shocked that this has to go Day 2, since we’re reaching the part of the rate where we have to start cutting some amazing tracks.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): When I think of TDCC, this is one of the first songs that immediately comes to mind. Fast paced and high energy, crazy catchy guitar line, and hook after hook after hook. This song is just a total blast, and I'm surprised that it ended up placing fairly middle of the road, but I think what I’m learning this rate is everyone has a different opinion on which tracks are the best on Tourist History

##[**AH OH AH AH OH**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MzbnwASIFKU)

**akanewasright** (10): When I think of 2DCC I think of “AH-OH-AH-AH-OH”

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably one of my favorite hooks in the rate. Makes me feel like I can drive with no speed limits.

**frogaranaman** (10): the guitar work on this album is fucking phenomenal

**GapeCod** (10): 1-800-273-TALK

**Stryxen** (10): me during the 2020 ult reveal on discord for a moment before getting server muted

**waluigiest** (10): I LOVE THIS SONG it has amazing energy and reminds me of all of the best parts of The Postal Service

**bigbigbee** (9.5): There’s crack in those opening 5 seconds sir

**plastichaxan** (9.5): this kinda blended with something good can work for me but i’m not complaining

**skargardin** (9): I think I remember this being on one of the fifa soundtracks...? skull

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): the little robot voices are such a minor addition but add so much to this song

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): *ah oh ah ah oh*, I hate that

**jman457** (8.5): a fun time

**throwaway7650** (8.5): the guitar in the intro is great but the "ah-oh"s before it are not

**seanderlust** (8.3): this is fun! an instant earworm of a chorus

**bbfan132** (8): still dancing to this rn

**CrimsonROSET** (8): can you

**musical\_pyn** (8): intro is incredible, but the rest of the song doesn't quite get there again

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Love the guitar tone here, especially with the tremolo picking

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): Once you get past the super annoying ah-oh-ahah-oh, this song is pretty much again, sticking to the formula of the wailing guitar beginning -> fade out into verse -> tempo bump-up -> guitars come back in the chorus -> etc etc. All with the trademark catchy chorus, bumping percussion, phenomenal guitar-work, kind of idiosyncratic bridge but one that still shines like a highlight. But I wrote in my notes how this record is mainly full of really cool songs but ultimately feel like worse versions of What You Want, which I mean, yeah.

**ctatkeson** (7.5): Like this one but not really feeling that much.

**Uberpigeon** (7.3): I will admit i do like the aa o a a o

**ebooks #5454** (7): the first 15 seconds is how creme and i talk to each other

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): That bass synth lead on the verses is pretty sick, and the driving chorus is great too here with the jangly guitars. Only negative is that weird ah oh ah oh thing they had going in the beginning that almost felt like it didn't belong at all.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): ah oh ah ah oh

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): flex

## **crickets**

**runaway3212** (6): could never be me

**modulum83** (5.5): crosses the annoying threshold

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I'm sad. The instrumental is KILLER. But all of the singing from the lead to the background vocals are so drab to me. A small-voiced singer I stan, in comparison, is Neil Tennant of Pet Shop Boys. His verses on It's a Sin or West End Girls ether this song. Not me starting stan wars amongst UK Men in Bands lmao but I'm just saying, it's possible for me to like singers with smaller voices! Stream Lazy Line Painter Jane by Belle and Sebastian or something!!! This score is an average of 10 for instrumentals, 0 for vocals.

**daythreeinmiami** (5): This song kinda reminds me of a song by an Australian band Amy Meredith. It sounds like their song ‘Lying’. I like ‘Lying’ better. That sound thingy that they do though is creative though so props for creativity.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This album is like half bops and half annoying repetitive songs like this.

**imsodumb321** (0): This is my least favorite on the record because I feel it just falls flat once the chorus hits which is pretty disappointing and then the rest is all muddled to me

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): I would say along with TDCC, The xx was the other group that had my Pandora stations by a chokehold. I wonder how Intro would’ve fared here instead, because it’s always been THEE song that I associate with them, but I think putting in a non-instrumental song by them was a good call. This was definitely a grower; I think Romy and Oliver exchanging their soft vocals over the plucky guitar sounds fantastic. But I also think there’s much better in the bonus that can go above this.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): I’ve never been a fan of the xx, their music tends to be very minimalistic, and I’ve always just found it to be quite mostly boring, and this track definitely feels too minimalist for me.

**Hulnia** (10): Why the fuck are these guys unlikely to be rated? [2]

**seanderlust** (10): After a long night of hooking, trade didn't like the session so he had gutted the xx and set them on fire. But you know they didn't die. they had crystallized. And now they're a glamazon, bitch, ready for the runway.

**throwaway7650** (10): it kind of sounds like a classic that gets endlessly covered on singing competitions, idk how to explain the vibe but I love it

**waluigiest** (10): their first two albums are perfect projects. They had a grip on me

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh this is what the summertime sadness remix was going for

**welcome2thejam** (9): Minimalism in music has a bit of an uphill battle for my taste, but the xx make it look easy. This whole album is a masterclass in creating atmosphere in all that space

**GARjuna** (8.9): v well constructed

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): this isn’t the best xx song but we need to hype the xx more

**ctatkeson** (8.5): First time listen.  Really loved the male/female vocals weaving together and harmonizing.

**modulum83** (8.3): it still stuns me that this song was made in 2009

**bbfan132** (8): nice song :)

**camerinian** (8): when the FUCK are we rating In Colour, I swear it’s been proposed for years now

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8): I think the xx are pretty cool. They do what they do well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is what happens to Skarner’s enemies when he auto attacks them after hitting them with his E

**TiltControls** (7.5): romy album when (...hey this worked last time I tried it!)

**jman457** (7.3): Not that catchy compared to their other songs

**2dina3dworld** (7): Is it a Mandela effect if I thought the xx were a Neighbourhood - esque band with a lot of sax?

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I kind of preferred when Jamie xx had his own way with the production side of things but this is a fine enough song.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): The xx always went from this really minimalistic sound that utilized space in their music, it's grand. Always love Romy and Oliver doing vocals playing off one another too. It isn't my favorite track of their's but this is good.

**skargardin** (7): this has never been one of my favourite the xx songs but not bad by any means

## **The zz**

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s an ok song… I feel like it was missing a little extra oomph

**IIIHenryIII** (6): weird, in a good way? I think?

**vayyiqra** (5): I remember my ex saying she didn't like the xx at all and didn't get why they were so hyped, and she had very good music taste, and it turns out she was right. I don't get this either. Nevertheless, still a great rate overall!

**daythreeinmiami** (4): I’ve tried so hard to get into the xx. I have. I love male/female groups but I just haven’t been ever to get into these guys. It’s just not my sound.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): My lowest scoring track in the rate (still above a 7 tho lmao), this song just never really did it for me. It's admittely catchy towards the end, but it takes too long to get there and it's just kinda forgettable in a rate full of obnoxiously catchy songs, whereas this track feels like it lingers too long setting the mood only to not do much with that.

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): I will admit, it’s pretty funny how they wrote the [French version of like a basic American’s obsession with Paris](https://www.washingtonpost.com/express/wp/2009/05/26/phoenix_wolfgang_amadeus_phoenix/). But other than that, this song fall flat for me— the “Rome Rome Rome” verse especially gets a bit irksome. It’s also the longest “real” song on the album and you can definitely feel that.

## **Happy Italian Heritage Month**

**2dina3dworld** (10): the Roman Empire is still gone oofies

**frogaranaman** (10): I never got to visit Rome because COVID yanked me out of those plans before I could even get the bnb selection sent out to my friend group

**IIIHenryIII** (10): better than the movie

**seanderlust** (10): rome (x1000)

**waluigiest** (10): what a cool song!!!

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**bbfan132** (9): the second half was really nice, liked this!

**bigbigbee** (9): Rome is having a bad wild boar problem right now!

**CrimsonROSET** (9): at some point i began to hear ‘vroom vroom vroom vroom’ and i swear i was going insane

**GapeCod** (9): The absolute pinnacle of French engineering.

**jman457** (9): Take your medications or you’ll need a Roman Holiday!!

**musical\_pyn** (9): romeromeromeromeromeromeromerome

**runaway3212** (9): This song feels both too long and too short

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): not them predicting Call My By Your Name with the Italy setting and the opening lyric :peloton:

**SmileAndTears** (8.5): This one is very interesting

**ctatkeson** (8.1): First time hearing it, generally positive impression

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Yeah it’s the whole middle part for me. The bridge, the third verse in what I think is after the bridge? I dunno it’s just so nice and gentle. And then they just slam dunk that bad boy in the final chorus? Stellar.

**fadedblue09** (8): Kinda weak chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): The opening lines of this song had me RUNNING to Genius.com to see if this song was gay… it’s not :(

**Stryxen** (8): if i call this prog rock i’ll get hate comments but i won’t be wrong

**throwaway7650** (8): the song's production is a vibe but the it drags a bit by the end

**Uberpigeon** (7.8): rome it rome it rome unrome it

**camerinian** (7.5): I just love that sun-kissed gorgeous tone here. It's a great fit for this band

**akanewasright** (7.3): This is alright

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): If you listen, right after the first chorus, there is one of my favorite moments of this album with that lovely little guitar lick. It appears similarly in Love Like a Sunset too. This is a nice song overall, one of the more dynamic tracks on the album, and I think it really felt more like a closing track.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): rome rome rome rome rome rome room room room room vroom vroom vroom

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): This song is good in some respects, but not something I'd listen to constantly on my own. A good pace and bassline, the repeated "Rome" is a bit annoying to me though.

**modulum83** (6.8): this album has a lot of gay yearning energy but like this song especially

**BeauMeringue212** (6): Like the heavy distorted synthy sound

**plastichaxan** (6): this had no right to improve so much halfway through i’ve changed my score so much

## [**...**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rYduGCniLu0)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sounds like car commerical music

**\_\_Avaritia** (3): I don’t really know what to think about this one, it heavily overstays its welcome and has such a rough beginning and somewhere in the middle as well when it needs to pick up the groove again. Even if I liked a few passages here and there when it becomes more upbeat and the wobbly lead synth kicks in, the tune on the verses is just not there, and the instrumental is just not compelling in the slightest to really save it. It’s an idiosyncratic track for certain, and I think it’s a little bit too idiosyncratic for me.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Ngl this one might be more boring than the instrumental track.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): Maybe one of the most underappreciated tracks from Torches in my opinion, incredibly relatable themes about depression/illness and finding a way to move forward, backed by some incredibly satisfying production (the church bells are absolutely next level) it's just a stunning track all around.

**cremeebrulee** (8.7): This mfer was really in love, in love damn … Waste has some of the sweetest songwriting in the whole rate and it just perfectly encapsulates the feeling caring for someone so much, you would spend your days doing nothing by their side, if that’s what it takes to bring them to a better place mentally. As heartwarming as the track is, there’s definitely better on the album that should place higher, so I think this is a fine position for it.

---

## **Every day that you want to waste, you can**

**2dina3dworld** (10): this song isn’t a waste *ba dum tsssh*

**CrimsonROSET** (10): that fucking chorus. That’s it, that’s the comment.

**frogaranaman** (10): a grief anthem so true

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I don't trust anyone who gives this jam a score lower than 10

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Mark Foster makes me believe in romance at age 11

**Uberpigeon** (10): i relate to this not because i want to be with someone but because i love wasting time

**camerinian** (9.5): I honestly really adore this one as a strange sort of tired love song. I like songs of devotion to a person while they’re struggling, and maybe it’s the feeling of days being wasted recently that’s resonating with me, but I didn’t expect this to hold up as remarkably well as it has.

**celladonn** (9): Sweet lyrics on this one

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Another pretty decent song all-around, super hard to fault it, even if it’s a little more downtempo than I would really like, and I think the overall melody at the chorus is sometimes hit and sometimes miss for me. But I think the production on the verses and the chorus juxtapose really nicely with one another and it’s catchy enough for me to not really think too much about the fact that it’s missing maybe a little extra something.

**daythreeinmiami** (8.5): It’s the chorus and bridge for me. It just gets so dramatic and interesting ugh love it. This album just really does not age for me. It still hits as hard over 10 years later.

**runaway3212** (8.5): surprisingly sweet

**BeauMeringue212** (8.2): Not as strong as their other songs sonically for me, but I love the lyrics. They're sensitive without being preachy

**jman457** (8.2): Honestly a sad bop

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): i really can’t waste those days though Mark… i need to accomplish things to stay alive

**bbfan132** (8): nice album track, probably could grow on me with time

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): You know, it's been so long since I heard this song (I really only listened to my favorites from the album), but it's so much better than I remembered. The music is fantastic with a nice bass line to it, but the star is the lyrics. It's actually about a girlfriend having some sort of mental problem or illness, I think like depression of some sort, and how he tries his best to help her through it, knowing she will have bad days somewhat. It's so sweet when you really listen to it, and it makes the song. I'm gonna have this on a playlist for sure now.

**modulum83** (8): when mark said "you know it's funny how freedom can make us feel contained" i felt that

**throwaway7650** (8): wait I did too much on this song on initial listen (I basically called it soulless) but it's actually catchy + the vocals are tolerable for this album. edit: bumping this score by 0.5 points upon further inspection of the lyrics

**waluigiest** (8): it’s cute and all but love that it gives me personally permission to be lazy

**xxipil0ts** (8): [Shawn Mendes' Voice] It's Giving Me Deltarune

**gwenflip** (7.5): something about the opener reminds me of the White Lotus theme

## **Waste of time**

**Lilacly\_Adily** (7): a lesser copy of Helena’s beats

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Not bad… but I will probably forget it tomorrow

**seanderlust** (6.7): i don't like the sound of the gang vocals on the bridge but otherwise this is decent

**musical\_pyn** (6): I really like the sentiment of the song, it's too bad I don't really like the instrumental

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): It's not a complete waste of a song but...it's halfway there.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): While the other songs are trying for something and irritating me, this one is just boring to me. This lead singer's vocal tics hurt my soul, that "mmm" line? Nooo

**Stryxen** (5): i wasted my, mOney.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): Seeing this in Day 2 was a real surprise to me, it managed to stay solidly in Day 3 for a majority of the rate, then just fell into Day 2 after a few bad scores and never recovered. This gives me exactly the energy I want and expect from Phoenix, ends the album on a high note, and is easily the best of the closers in this rate. Some people feel like it’s just 1901 part 7, but I think it’s got more emotional undertones to it.

**cremeebrulee** (8.3): I do like that the closing track of the album finally picks up in energy, but it never reaches the high from the first two tracks to me. However, I dig the almost eerie sound of this and the fast-paced vocals on the outro. (*Misheard Lyric:* Sally used to come for me (“who tf is Sally????”) // *Actual Lyric:* Dahlias, they come from me)

---

## **Peacemakers**

**frogaranaman** (10): of course these French motherfuckers wrote a song about that one Les Misérables scene

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): This was the first Phoenix song I heard actually, I downloaded it from some indie mixtape from some cool blog, shout out to The Hype Machine

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): just such an amazing closer for such an amazing album

**waluigiest** (9): the album is so tight and this is a great closer

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): i’m not sure how well this works as an outro but goddamn is the song just fun to nod your head along to

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): Some very cool guitar work here, some cool details that enhance this song. Out of all the bands, Phoenix plays with dramatic tension in a song well while still making appealing and catchy pop rock.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): it was my favorite on first listen, but now I don't think it's as good as the best songs on the album

**ctatkeson** (8.4): This one is pretty catchy too

**2dina3dworld** (8): this song is a sex bop I know you know

**bbfan132** (8): nice closer! 1901 part 4 but i love that song so they could make endless rehashes of that song and it’d be ok

**kappyko** (8): omg they made a song about what redacted will never have

**throwaway7650** (8): good closer, really like the guitar and overall instrumentation

**Uberpigeon** (8): i like the harpsichord sounding bit at the end

**seanderlust** (7.8): i love the instrumental bit after the second chorus. i think overall, phoenix on this album (at least) does a phenomenal job with the instrumentation

**BeauMeringue212** (7.7): The build up to the chorus is so good

**jman457** (7.7): A nice way to end the album, but wish it was a tad stronger

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): Instrumental break/bridge/outro are fire but the rest of it is just kinda there, but at least the final moments of the album are strong.

**modulum83** (7.5): album's getting old at this point but the lyrics are really sweet

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is a bop but I think it could have been a bigger finish for the album.

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I respect the piano reference shout out to Mozart (rip) and the album title but look it sound a little off putting but overall not too bad of an album closer.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Not much to say on this one, but I do love the bombastic ending the track has.

**musical\_pyn** (7): oh, so this is where the "wolfgang amadeus" comes in

**Stryxen** (7): me when i’m german and my arm is made of frozen water

**welcome2thejam** (7): Deciding to take this song literally, where a fighting couple has signed a peace treaty to make them contractually obligated to fuck

## **War Criminals**

**runaway3212** (6): This isn't bad but it feels somewhat basic compared to other songs on this album

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This is a very meh song

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): A very forgettable finish to a kind of forgettable second-half of this record. It has a decent chorus melody and of course it’s competently made but it lacks the oomph that I’m looking for and just feels like a really awkward track to finish off this album. Don’t really know what else to say.

**ebooks #5454** (2): its like they got to the end of the album and gave up

**RandomHypnotica** (10): First off, let’s talk about that average! 7.777, in 7th place, we couldn’t do this if we tried to rig it! Secondly, the song is a major bop! I remember when it first came out, my dad actually really liked it, and I was in a phase where I had to hate everything my parents did, so I absolutely despised this song, but I was dumb and young cause this genuinely has such a great, unique sound, and it was honestly ahead of it’s time

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): I didn’t hear this when it first came out, but someone did play it on plug.dj once and I thought it was really lovely! It’s another song that I am content is getting a Tiktok revival, it definitely deserves.

---

## **Running up that dream**

**2dina3dworld** (10): a legendary song. Truly one of those inescapable songs that really imprint on you

**CrimsonROSET** (10): we love a bonus rate opener

**frogaranaman** (10): that mashup of this song with "Yes Indeed" by Lil Baby and Drake is genuinely one of my favorite things of all time and is constantly stuck in my head, full stop

**raggedy-princess** (10): would be my 11 >:(

**skargardin** (10): actually one of my favourite songs of all time I think!

**thedoctordances1940** (10): bop

**modulum83** (9.5): it's a law of the universe that whenever you hear this come on in a cafe you lose your absolute shit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This charted in the United States 8 years after its initial release because of a car commercial. Capitalism has its moments.

**GapeCod** (9): We Are The People is better.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): So chill

**Uberpigeon** (9): girl.... it was camp

**ctatkeson** (8.8): I’ve heard this a bunch.  A nice song!

**bbfan132** (8.5): charli xcx cover when

**teenwitches** (8.5): you don't know how cool i felt telling people in 2016 that this song was "so 2009"

**jman457** (8.4): the Lady Gaga of the early 2010’s Indie Pop.

**bridgemoney** (8): It's like a less psychedelic MGMT but still really good.

**daythreeinmiami** (8): This song really does not sound like it has aged a day to me and honestly it makes me super uncomfortable that this song is 13 years old…which is how old I was when it came out oh god I hate aging.  und like it has aged a day to me and honestly it makes me super uncomfortable that this song is 13 years old…which is how old I was when it came out oh god I hate aging.

**ebooks #5454** (8): this is cool

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I was gonna give this a lower score but then I saw the single art and I bumped it up a bit

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): This track has a ton of good vibes on it, and that falsetto chorus (chefs kiss!).

**TiltControls** (8): I feel like I've seen this in movies or commercials or SOMETHING. but for the life of me cannot remember what.

**waluigiest** (8): I never think about this song. I didn’t recognize the title. But it’s such a classic.

**seanderlust** (7.7): it's pleasant, if a bit too inoffensive

**BeauMeringue212** (7): Always preferred We Are The People

**throwaway7650** (7): the start of the chorus just barely reminds me of big & chunky ("it's all in the waaay")... but the vocals are meh

**welcome2thejam** (7): Dreamy

## **🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️🧍‍♂️**

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): It's an ok song

**omgitskebab** (6): vibes. dont love it as much as i used

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Which car brand was this used to advertise again… wait just looked it up it was Honda

**Stryxen** (5): literally no thots at all

**celladonn** (3): I've always irrationally disliked this. Something about the vocals just grates on me, and Luke Steele just strikes me as a bit of a prat

**camerinian** (1): I don't know if this is a hot take or not, but I can't fucking stand this song. I hate how flat the vocal delivery is, how uninspired and dull the instrumental palette is, the awful wispy hook which goes nowhere and doesn't resolve anything. There's just this terrible air of pretentiousness about this song which most of this rate manages to avoid. Also I fucking despise this band's stupid, borderline racist aesthetic. I'd call it schlocky bad taste if anything in the music backed up that deluded sense of ambition, but it just makes them look like wankers.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): this plays on the loudspeakers every single day at my work please dont make me listen to this anymore

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): I'm always surprised when I remember this song was a single and got a music video and everything! To me it feels like the closest track on Manners to  their early stuff on the Chunk of Change EP, while also still having an obviously higher production budget and just being more well rounded all-together. In an album packed with religious overtones and themes, this track manages to encapsulate and convey them the best.

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): It’s definitely one of those “brain-off” tracks for me because it’s lyrically dense enough to be distracting. I just bop to that cute instrumental hook and pretend this isn’t an emotional heavy song.

---

## **Church-goers**

**Uberpigeon** (11): i CHOOSE to believe this is a song about gay feelings!

**2dina3dworld** (10): are those the opening chords to the Reason

**fadedblue09** (10): The arrangement feels watery in the best way possible.

**frogaranaman** (10): I CRIED OUT "GOD", YOU DARED ME IN THE DARKKKKKK

**kappyko** (10): red velvet OVER

**ctatkeson** (9.4): A sadder song.  Seems to slow down time listening to it.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): oh this was cute!

**modulum83** (9): michael angelo coming to take my balladphobia out behind the shed and shoot it with a pistol

**TiltControls** (9): tbh I don't really know what's being said for most of these songs' lyrics, but i really don't care

**welcome2thejam** (9): Who needs the sun when you got the perpetual brightness of this chorus

**IIIHenryIII** (8.9): that guitar in the intro and in the outro… chef's kiss

**camerinian** (8.5): this is really sweet. I get the feeling this would be a favourite track if I'd actually heard this album at age 14.

**teenwitches** (8.5): the horns are so good on this one

**Stryxen** (8.2): i have no idea what any of this means but i love it

**ebooks #5454** (8): the reoccuring theme with this album: excellent, delicious bgm, but why do they falsetto over it?? ruins ze taste

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): I like the bassoon that comes in at the end (I’m in my Lil Yachty era I don’t know what instrument that is)

**omgitskebab** (8): bit slow but so much yearning and romance

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): that guitar line sounds so nice to build this around, this feels like the most chill track on the album so far

**bbfan132** (7.5): probably the least interesting song to me so far but it’s still good

**throwaway7650** (7.5): I've lost track of how many songs it's been where the production carries with the vocals as the only factor dragging down the score

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I like the trumpet. It adds a nice little flare in the end.

**SmileAndTears** (7): There's a saxophone somewhere in the mix so bonus points for that i guess?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It sounds like Pokemon Diamond and Pearl

## **Sinners**

**1998tweety** (6.5): red velvet washed

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.4): This is nice, I like the horn additions.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Some parts of this feel a little overstuffed but it's got that classic Passion Pit appeal to it.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): This has a nice little groove to it. I really like the horns that appear here too.

**runaway3212** (6): boring

**jman457** (5.7): Catchy but forgettable

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): I swear to god this song gave me Hoobastank flashbacks when it started. Either way, not a terrible song but I really could feel like this song could be done without. Yeah the chorus isn’t too bad and the horns at the end of the track are an overall positive addition, but something about the lead melody to this just, again, makes it feel a little bit too whimsical for its own good, like as if projecting this image of happiness without any real depth to it.

**TragicKingdom1** (0): the most annoying song on a generally annoying album

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): I always confuse this in my mind with Rome if I'm being totally honest, it's very pleasant and peaceful, but it feels a little bit generic. What confuses me even more is how this got so high up, very nearly making Day 3. If I had to guess, I think being earlier on the tracklist before too much fatigue sets in really helped people’s impressions of it, but this feels like a generous placement for sure.

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): Even when WAP starts to sounds a bit more subdued, that doesn’t make the songs here any less catchy, with this being a prime example. Like I’ve had the phrase “fences in a rowwww” stuck in my head for literal weeks now. It just goes to show how good Phoenix is at crafting such earworm hooks. I think Day 2 is a fair placement for this. It’s calming and lovely, but there’s definitely better on the album.

---

## **Landscapers**

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (11): Stands out, to me.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Now this is the song that I was introduced to Phoenix with. I didn’t stop listening to it all throughout the summer of 2009 so now when this song plays I just think of that summer. To be young and 15 again.

**frogaranaman** (10): so great, makes me want to break into an abandoned building and drink a 12 pack of PBR for some reason

**throwaway7650** (10): really good production throughout, the chorus in particular hits

**vayyiqra** (10): Here Phoenix keep up the album's trend of beautiful and catchy songs with obscure lyrics.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.3): that's a bop

**bbfan132** (9): :floating: but make it not sad

**fadedblue09** (9): feels like I'm riding through a tunnel

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): this really hits after a long day

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): This lowkey has the vibes of a late night summer drive when the warm breeze rolls through your hair. Just me maybe. But one thing that shows on this and 1901 is that Phoenix really knows how to build up to a chorus. Also those almost twinkling guitars on the build up to the chorus. Yeah the first three songs on this record are just tremendous.

**teenwitches** (9): the lyrics make absolutely no sense but the groove is undeniable

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): an absolute bop

**BeauMeringue212** (8): I used to listen to the DefStarr remix instead but this version is actually better. Sounds weirdly accoustic and electronic at the same time idk

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I choose to interpret this bop as a critique of private property.

**camerinian** (8): God the grooves on this album are just unbelievable. Give the drummer a raise

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me buildinfg a minecraft house

**ebooks #5454** (8): fences i n          a          r o w

**Roxieloxie** (8): me when i am an award winning play that was turned into a movie starring viola davis and denzel washington even though the broadway version with james earl jones lowkey ate more

**runaway3212** (8): never have I gotten so hyped over fences in my life before

**welcome2thejam** (8): Biggest robbery in this rate is actually Phoenix not giving this outro the time nor attention it truly deserves

**ctatkeson** (7.7): First time hearing it, good song, but not really to my taste

**seanderlust** (7.5): i wish i felt more for this but i, like taylor swift at the end of the second bad blood verse, just don't. (related: hope you did the rerate)

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): i'm on the fence about this one!

**plastichaxan** (7): this sounds like any other indie white man song of the 10s for me but this was probably the blueprint so i’ll give it that

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s chill

## **Gatekeepers**

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): “hiding from their lies and discords” me when i claim i’m giving a song a good score only to tank it later

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): For as much as I admire this track for being kind of laid-back, and for how much this reminds me a bit of what Manners would consist of, Fences just doesn’t really have the same bite that I’m looking for amongst these tracks in the rate, or at least the bite that I think it wants. It has a decent chorus and a promising if not criminally short outro but I really don’t think the verses really carry a good enough tune to make it so memorable.

**modulum83** (6.5): when the fences are in a row!

**jman457** (6.2): A bit slow, like right when it was gonna get good it ends

**Awkward\_King** (6): man's just saying fences in a high pitched voice

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): This is aight, a bit mellower. Kinda has the same gripes I have with a lot of the songs in the whole rate, falls a little flat.

**dicahprihoe** (6): I probably would’ve liked this song more when I was in my indie kid tumblr phase at 14

**Stryxen** (6): my crafting table when i put 4 planks and 2 sticks in it

**musical\_pyn** (5): I feel like the vocals really take away from the song here rather than add to it

**Brendon-Urine** (4): this just sounds so offputting coming after two massively catchly songs, did not enjoy

**waluigiest** (4): one of the only songs on this album that isn’t burned into my brain, probably because it’s not very exciting and the writing isn’t anything special

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): This would be a 10 if it wasn’t absolutely played to death over here, you couldn’t walk anywhere without hearing it on the radio, on tv or anywhere. But years separated from then, it’s really nice to come back and appreciate just how great the song is.

**cremeebrulee** (6): Don’t care for this at all, I just think it’s a bit boring.

## **Anddd your wide-eyed gaze**

**2dina3dworld** (10): A KISS A CRY

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): You are not human if you don’t sing along to A MOMENT A LOVE A DREAM A LAUGH A KISS A CRY OUR RIGHTS OUR WRONGS, I’m sorry, I don’t make the rules

**agentofscranton** (10): this is what plays when you walk through the pearly gates to heaven

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Diggin' the classic Fedora/Cardigan combo in the music video.

**frogaranaman** (10): but what if I had a sour disposition

**gwenflip** (10): find a song that radiates more bittersweet nostalgia than this song

**Stryxen** (10): my parents used to play this cd in the car all the time lemme cry

**teenwitches** (10): my own personal cultural reset was hearing this in 500 days of summer. i have not been the same person since.

**TiltControls** (10): an 11 if it were in the main rate tbh

**waluigiest** (10): this song makes me sentimental for a time that never existed

**thedoctordances1940** (9): so true

**bbfan132** (8.5): wish i liked this more but i still enjoy it lol

**throwaway7650** (8.5): great production, I'm yassing

**ctatkeson** (8.4): A moment a laugh a dream… Very catchy, but not totally to my taste.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): outsold sweet escape

**modulum83** (8): coldplay made some points

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): I suppose it’s pretty catchy

**welcome2thejam** (8): Builds so well to that chorus drop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): I have a soft spot for this song, it's sweet!

**daythreeinmiami** (6): This song was freaking HUGE in Australia in the summer of 09/10. You couldn’t escape it. Personally, I enjoy ‘Fader’ better and I thought that was a better tune but I dunno I guess we thought this was a good song to end the 00’s on as I think it also won the Triple J Hottest 100, which is basically our country’s biggest music event.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): Surprisingly don't think I've ever heard this full song. It's a nice indie rock tune, kinda sounds like Foals.

## **Sour disposition**

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Not bad, but not good either

**jman457** (5.7): Sounds like a boring Coldplay cover

**Saison\_Marguerite** (5): this is certainly a song that exists

**TragicKingdom1** (5): the instrumental sounds like a default ringtone called "Journey" or something

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Seeing this drop SO low at the start of the rate was truly confusing, because I always had this as one of the album highlights, and I was super surprised to see other people just seemed to hate it. Thankfully some other scores managed to bring it back up, unfortunately just shy of being Day 3. It's got the signature trademarks of catchy guitar riffs, simple, repetitive hooks and just solid production. Also I have watched the MV over 10 times during this rate and still have absolutely no fucking idea what is happening.

**cremeebrulee** (7.8): I feel like I *should* like this track more, but it’s not fully there for me. I think I just don’t like the elongated delivery in the chorus and it ends a bit suddenly for me, given the extended vocal-less intro. But I will say the guitar work on this song is particularly great. A lot of the songs in the rate are bright so they give off summer vibes, but this one feels perfect for a rainier day.

---

## **Run Away With Me**

**fadedblue09** (10): Those roaring guitar riffs, and relatable lyrics. Easy 11 contender

**frogaranaman** (10): this song just thrusts me back to being on top of a parking garage in the summer and having some shitty cheap beer we could grab without getting carded

**runaway3212** (10): Okay I need to be critical but this album is so good

**Stryxen** (10): the bridge (maybe??)  is the most screamable moment in the history of music ever

**throwaway7650** (10): wow I LOVE the synth (?) motif (probably a guitar tbh)

**CrimsonROSET** (9): wait is this song about suicide

**GapeCod** (9): I feel like this song is to blame for the emergence of American Authors (the Best Day Of My Life one-hit wonder... yikes), because all of their songs want to sound like this, but they just can't do it!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): that's a banger

**skargardin** (9): we love a music video that elevates the song

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): Another song where the star of the show is the guitar riffs that come in blaring in to introduce us to the record. I like this song’s mixture of being bright and banging, even if it feels a bit formulaic in the pop rock blueprint (like it reminds me of Crush 40 for some reason, can’t explain why). But otherwise a pretty lovely song.

**ebooks #5454** (8.5): i gave myself vertigo headbanging to the chorus

**musical\_pyn** (8): that guitar riff is so good

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): God that guitar is so delightfully J-rock-y I just have to simp

**modulum83** (7.8): the most straightforward rock song on the album, and it suffers a bit for it tbh

**jman457** (7.6): cute but not spectacular

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): this sounds like a two door cinema club song

**bbfan132** (7.5): i like most of it although it ends abruptly - it definitely brings me back to 2010 lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): I remember completely hating this album on first listen but there's some bops here.

**ctatkeson** (6.9): Start of the chorus really falls flat for me and don’t dig the guitar riff, but there are some interesting parts of the song.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.7): Dang, this is a good instrumental too! Great bassline. Can I get the supercut of TDCC where it's just the first 20 seconds of each song?! The main dude's singing is a tad better than before. These really sounds like a severely photocopied early-U2 or Talking Heads, without bringing enough of a fresh perspective for me.

## **All You Had To Do Was Stay**

**Uberpigeon** (6.5): I left the light on for you sarah won't you come home

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I don’t know how I feel about this one. I like the chorus but and the verse but I don’t think I like the pre-chorus. That ‘pew-pew’ sound is a choice. For some reason I feel like this song doesn’t blend well together. Like I love the chorus and bridge but the rest is eh?

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): This bounces as soon as the guitar riff starts, although the guitar really remains the most interesting part of the track for me. Everything else sounds good, the singing is fine, but it just sounds like something I've heard a bunch of other indie rock acts do before.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): The Phoenix slaughter continues, with Lasso being the last song to not make Day 3, and Rock Band/Guitar Hero fans worldwide have lost. This definitely makes sense as the 3rd placing Phoenix song, it's very reminiscent of Lisztomania/1901, but with the tiniest bit less punch. I don't really care though how similar it may be, it still absolutely goes off.

**cremeebrulee** (8.1): I was kind of shocked to find out that this was the last single off WAP because I always just saw it as an alternate version of Fences— it has the same ordinary sounding lyrics, but with a slightly more frantic instrumental. So it’s not surprising that they placed pretty close together by the end, even though this was Day 3 for much of the rate.

---

## **Cowfolk**

**frogaranaman** (10): yeehaw motherfucker that's what I’m talking about

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): I know this song the best since I used to listen to an alt rock radio in high school and this song got repeated constantly. Makes me nostalgic

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this used to be one of my favorite songs in guitar hero as a kid so im legally required to give this a 10 for nostalgia’s sake

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Yeehaw!

**waluigiest** (10): It’s just so pleasant

**welcome2thejam** (10): Yee-haw. Love the chorus. I'd probably lose all control of my body if I ever heard it live.

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): where would YOU go with a lasso?

**teenwitches** (9.5): forever really is a long long time when you've lost your way :(

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): yet another phoenix bop

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): That hook really ropes you in.

**daythreeinmiami** (9): Oh I miss 2009 listening to this on a YouTube clip, thinking I was so cool and unique finding this obscure French band. The kick makes me punch the air in happiness.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): This is fun!

**bbfan132** (8.5): kind of feels like 1901 pt. 2 but it’s still very good!

**2dina3dworld** (8): yipee ki yay

**Awkward\_King** (8): bop

**camerinian** (8): it's almost a bit too much like 1901, but the way the chorus ramps up really does a lot to save it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): cliches i’m tired for for 500: ‘forever is a long time’

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): The drums shine so much in this track to me. If you never have, look up when they play this and watch their touring drummer Thomas Hedlund. Dude goes out of his mind when he performs, it's incredible to watch. The rest of the track is fantastic.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): the intro sounds like a whole different song, one that'd be better by the way

**Stryxen** (8): yeehaw! it's not yeehaw music at all but idc

**throwaway7650** (8): the 2nd half of the chorus is the best part of lasso, good lyrics too

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.9): A good song with some energy. Also, since I've been negative about this point with other songs, I am a fan of this singer's voice.

**jman457** (7.6): catchy lil tune

**ctatkeson** (7.5): Seemed too similar stylisticly to 1901, but still a good song

**modulum83** (7.5): the guitars on this one are cute

## **Cityslickers**

**SmileAndTears** (7.5): This sounds a little bit like Renegade no? No? Oh ok

**runaway3212** (7): If I had a lasso I would think "wow cool" then put it into my closet and forget about it

**TragicKingdom1** (7): fuck ted lasso and i said that shit

**akanewasright** (6.8): Me when I’m a cowboy… idk what the hell to say about this, it’s okay I guess

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): You… you don’t tie someone up *to* a lasso, you... you tie them *with*... nevermind

**\_\_Avaritia** (5): Kind of reminds me a little bit of Fences in just how not really strong the tune is here or how the vocals kind of just doesn’t really make me too engaged with the song. I do like the beginning of this track and the chorus is okay but it never really progresses into something all that memorable. Abrupt ending too, hmm. This kind of begins the point where the album just doesn’t click with me at all.
