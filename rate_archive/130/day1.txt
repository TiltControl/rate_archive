**cremeebrulee** (9.3): I don’t think I could have ever predicted this as a first out 😭 This track is genuinely top half of the album for me. Out of all of the more “whimsical” sounding songs on Torches, I personally think this accomplishes that sound the best. The production feels full, but not crowded, although I can understand why some of you would feel that way (re: all the hyperpop comparisons). Still, I would’ve preferred some of the lesser developed songs from the rate to have left sooner than this. I don’t think it’s deserving of last place at all.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): And so Foster The People find themselves earning last place. I honestly wasn't expecting this to be dead last, I knew it would be at least a little divisive, but overall at least make it a bit higher in Day 1. The biggest factors were its glitchy, hyperpop-esque production and the *terrible* enunciation. I've listened to this song for years and yet I never knew he was singing "yet again I'm hustling" until starting this rate. It definitely feels wrong to see it go first however.

---

## **Everyday I'm hustlin'**


**\_\_Avaritia** (10): UNDERRATED TRACK - like wow,the production sounds a bit darker than the rest of the record, and yet it sounds… kind of fuller? Like not to say the rest of the record should sound like this but a track like this is just so immersive and captivating with the tinkling synths and the thumping percussion, again. I dunno man, there’s just something about the way the piano chords hit me on this record as well that are just, kind of subtly grand and yet so in your face and direct that you can’t help but get sucked in. And the lyrics? Cheap Thrills could never.

**frogaranaman** (10): I think this song may have made me a nihilist

**jman457** (9): sublime production

**BeauMeringue212** (8): A little repetitive but still a good hook

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The amount of catchiness on this album...it almost feels illegal.

**runaway3212** (8): Nickel more like nickeight

**Stryxen** (8): this is disco idc

**modulum83** (7.3): omg foster the people quirky moments??

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): And speaking of glitchy production, this almost carries over from Houdini. The drums mixed with it sound really good, and we got another earworm chorus too.

## **[Grimes](https://twitter.com/grimezsz/status/1420822651442921472?lang=en)**

**camerinian** (6.5): the instrumental hooks are so much better than the vocal hook and I have no idea how that happens

**omgitskebab** (6.5): solid song, kinda blends into the background though

**SmileAndTears** (6.5): something something Grimes

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): one point for every cent a nickle is worth

**TheQueenofVultures** (5): The "ahhh" part kinda sounds like pitched up minions, I'm sorry

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): That chorus is not it

**seanderlust** (4.5): so wait is genius right that foster wrote this song after some homeless people were mean to him? i-

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): yeah this is not good, mainly uninteresting and then some poor vocals take it down another stop

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.2): Vocals are especially annoying here. As much as I love indietronica, even the glitchy parts irritate me here.

**musical\_pyn** (4): something about the singer's voice here irks me in a way that his presence on the rest of the album doesn't

**fadedblue09** (3.5): there's too much going on wtf is this

**ebooks #5454** (3): theatre kid scatting music

**Ghost-Quartet** (3): as a gamer I should like this because it has chip tunes elements but it’s just a mess? It confused me when it started and by the end I was just baffled, I don’t know why they did this.

**imsodumb321** (3): I feel like this has a lot of unrealized potential which makes it frustrating to listen to

## **Wait, what is he saying?**

**bigbigbee** (10): I was in a performance group in college, and every semester I tried to use this song, and every semester I failed. Hate you guys too <3 I love this song. I love how it’s robotic, electrical, almost twinkly. Foster the People are good at creating a buildup, and I think this song is the perfected version of that. Side note: I have literally NEVER known what they are saying, until I looked it up just now. Who needs lyrics when you have vibes?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): that is now how you pronounce that word

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I still can't believe he's saying *I'm hustling*

**akanewasright** (8): if he’s not saying “hell yeah I’m awesome” then I’ve decided he actually is

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Shout out to my ex-friend who thought the lyrics were ‘oooh yeah I’m awesome’.

**dicahprihoe** (7): you’re a lobster a lobster a lobster

**waluigiest** (7): what the hell is he saying

**welcome2thejam** (7): Worse personal mishearing of lyrics in this rate: thinking the chorus of this was "everyday is awesome, awesome, awesome" or thinking 1901's outro was "ballin ballin ballin ballin"

**Uberpigeon** (6.7): is he saying omarosa

## **Hyperpop fans**

**bbfan132** (8.5): the intro reminds me of closure by taylor swift… i love hyperpop

**plastichaxan** (8): i hear beep boops i give good rating

**throwaway7650** (8): the intro is hyperpop (the bridge too actually)... also what is it with misheard lyrics in this rate? I keep hearing "hustling" as "roselyn" so they just repeat "yet again I'm roselyn" - so that's your name? ok

**xxipil0ts** (8): Re-listening this track now as someone who likes PC music, I think I might put this in rotation

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this is hyperpop right ? foster the people in trans women of experimental ?

**Brendon-Urine** (0): Just kind of a mess to my ears. The constant drums and beep boops don't mesh. They actually sound cool on their own towards the end but with vocals it becomes way too cluttered

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): is anybody surprised? separating Love Like A Sunset into two parts meant that the shorter, weaker part 2 that relies on the build of the first half to feel as climactic as it does is left to dry, and instead comes across as half-baked. It's a delicate, mellow but sweet track that fits the name, but compared to every other fully realised track here, it just doesn't cut it.

**cremeebrulee** (4): Like others said, this is just not worth all the incredible buildup from Part 1. Maybe I would have scored it higher if it was long enough to go somewhere or if they ever explained what a love like a sunset is … but who am I kidding, as if any of the songs on this album make sense lol. Honestly, this should’ve been the first song out idc idc.

---

## **Tina taught me to enjoy interludes**

**SmileAndTears** (11): hmmmm yessssssssssss releaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaase

**1998tweety** (10): ascending the sequel

**2dina3dworld** (10): and after pt 1, pt 2 hits it out of the park! Hell yeah!

**frogaranaman** (10): why does this album make me want to get happy drunk so much

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Honestly? Actually worth the almost six minute payoff, this is really cute and the perfect closer to an unusual song… I’m glad they made it its own track though so I don’t have to wade through Pt. 1 every time though lol

**jman457** (10): Interludephobia will kill this song but honestly it builds of Part I so well

**seanderlust** (10): these two together....gorgeous

**xavieryes** (10): "Acres a visible illusion" holy shit even Phoenix knows Acre doesn't exist

**modulum83** (9.7): this song is like aftercare - equally, if not more important than the main event

**teenwitches** (9.5): the soft guitar outro on this is my favorite

**throwaway7650** (9): pt. 1 outsold but this is still really nice, albeit short. watch ITSAY (spring day shitpost from the bg rate if you remember)

**TiltControls** (9): in pure mathematical terms 2 > 1 therefore for the score Pt. 2 > Pt. 1

**Stryxen** (8.9): part 1 outsells

**bigbigbee** (8.5): More songs should make me want to go listen to The Who’s Baba Riley.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this would’ve been a 10 as a joint slay with part 1

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): it's just really pretty

**ctatkeson** (8.1): Nice little chunk of music

**bbfan132** (8): gorgeous, kind of wish the two were combined into one cohesive song

**fadedblue09** (8): Love the flawless transition from the previous track

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): After the lengthy build, this is akin to a rainbow coming out after a heavy thunderstorm with how serene it feels.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): well, it's an improvement after part 1

**musical\_pyn** (8): kind of a let down after pt. 1, but still great

**vayyiqra** (8): This comment is for both parts: I love multipart songs with a long buildup. Popheads is not known for liking instrumentals but maybe they'll like this.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Kind of a weird outro to this track - I like the instrumental a lot, but it’s really a bit too short to really make me go back to it, but perhaps it serves decently as an outro to this pretty lengthy instrumental. Decent cut here that probably has the best vocals question mark?

**CrimsonROSET** (7): that was pretty, but so short. I know it’s because it’s following up the last one but I do believe they had strength to be on their own.

**ebooks #5454** (7): oh there's some fun in this one ... oh this feels like one of those songs that would play at the end of brother bear or franklin or another friendly animal show

**Hulnia** (7): Interludes are usually impossible to rate, but this one is too great to score low.

**skargardin** (7): I would've loved more of this actually, I feel like the Pt. 1 buildup didn't completely pay off

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): The voices are back!

## **Part 2/10**

**GapeCod** (7): Part 1 should have eaten its twin in the womb.

**waluigiest** (7): lyrics 10, everything else 5. It feels like a letdown after part 1

**runaway3212** (5): This is for the people who said god I love 911 but I wish it was barely two minutes and dissapointing

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): better than part 1 but thats not exactly saying much

**Uberpigeon** (5): all that waiting for this wet fish of a song

**welcome2thejam** (4): Actually kinda a letdown after the epicness of part 1

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): Wow, this is anticlimactic

**Awkward\_King** (2): wtf is this flop why'd they make a sequel

**BeauMeringue212** (2): The track before kinda builds up nicely to it but this just goes nowhere.

**daythreeinmiami** (2): My ears are a little hurty with this constant pad in the background. I don’t like this. I can barely hear him sing. I think I only heard the last sentence which was the title of the song.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): When we first decided on an idea for a bonus rate, I knew I wanted to include Friendly Fires. I only discovered them a couple of years ago, but they go hand in hand with the rest of the albums in this rate for me. So I checked out what their most popular song was, and it was essentially a choice between this or Paris - Aeroplane Remix. I decided to go with the non-remix, but I may have made a mistake. I still love it, it gives me a huge adrenaline rush, but clearly that didn’t translate to you all. Even if you didn’t enjoy this track, I still highly recommend listening to Pala (their album after this), or Inflorescent if you want more of an electronic/dance vibe.

**cremeebrulee** (6.7): I’m not too surprised that this is out first bonus rate exit. I hadn’t heard a single Friendly Fires song before this, so there’s no nostalgia factor for me and in a lineup of really strong songs, there was nothing really memorable here personally. I was intrigued *enough* by their production to check out the rest of their discography, so I will say if you enjoyed this it only gets better from here.

**bbfan132** (10): absolutely gorgeous, love this

**frogaranaman** (10): have y'all ever jumped into the pool to this song before? cathartic

**teenwitches** (9.5): so many songs from this era have this weightless feeling and this is one of the best to use that sound

**agentofscranton** (9): i can't swim :(

**modulum83** (8.7): the indie pop rock classic of choice for drunk faded frat boy parties

**CrimsonROSET** (8): jump in a poooooooool, then jump out

**seanderlust** (8): this feels very talking heads

**throwaway7650** (8): the chorus production is kind of insane

**vayyiqra** (8): Is it just my headphones or does this song sound rather thin? Is it meant to sound like that?

**welcome2thejam** (8): I would like to award you the highest honor I can bestow: Sounds it could've been a top tier song in any mid to late 2000s sports video game soundtrack

**ctatkeson** (7.6): A little too indie for me.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): A lot of this is middling but that ending makes me want to go feral

**omgitskebab** (7.5): listened to this *too* much a few years ago.

**jman457** (7.4): ive actually never heard this before, pretty good

**Stryxen** (7): me before swimming in the flood idk

## **Tanked**

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): due to NZ regulations, you cannot jump into a pool unless it’s either suitably fenced or part of an aquatic complex

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): the outro saved it

**camerinian** (6): this doesn't really resolve in a coherent way like most of this list does, but I think it's got good ideas and that percussion is dying for a better mix

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): Ok track, percussion is neat.

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): What is this genre… jungle rock?

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Ok but were those mob noises in the end

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): It's at this point where I feel the strain of listening to so many songs sung by men in a row is starting to set in.

**daythreeinmiami** (1): The over saturation of the vocals in the background feels like an insult to my ears. Oh my lorde no offence but that is this production? This is kinda causing my ears to hurt…

**GapeCod** (1): This is a massive embarassment tbh. Frankly I've only properly listened to Inflorescent, but that album is incredible and miles above whatever this mess is. At least they've exhibited growth since this song, lmao.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.3): Before starting the rate, Miss You was one of two skips on Torches for me, but I've really come to appreciate it. The contrast between the harshness of the verse and the romantic cooing mark does in the chorus, it's a very entrancing and hypnotizing song (probably because it accurately simulates the experience of being in a dodgy fortune teller tent at a carnival). I’m not surprised to find it here, just disappointed.

**cremeebrulee** (7.4): Idk about this placement 😭 I’ll admit, the clown sounds in the post-chorus made me drop my score significantly. But it’s one of the few songs here with some sort of narrative arc and I thought that might carry this a bit further. The chorus here is one of my favorite; it’s both lyrically and sonically gorgeous. The flip from “I really miss you” to “You might just miss me someday” into that extended outro (sans carnival music this time) is an album highlight. I wouldn’t have mind if this left later on Day 1, but I think third out is a bit low for this.

---

## **Smile at the chance just to see you again**

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): ANOTHER UNDERRATED TRACK - I love how everything in this track coalesces, once again with the one-two thumping drum rhythm synchronizing with one of the synths contrasted against the main melody arpeggio. It also sounds a little darker but also kind of … more tragic? It just bangs man, I don’t really know what to say if you don’t just get something moving when the post-chorus instrumental kicks in. It just sucks you in emotionally and never quite lets go for the duration of the track - all the way until its instrumental outro that really ties everything together in a nice red knot.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): category is: songs carried by the chorus but holy shit what a chorus

**frogaranaman** (10): this is absolutely going to get robbed and someone is gonna say something along the lines of "good production but it's a bit aimless"

**jman457** (10): Love the chaotic energy this track, instant fav

**runaway3212** (10): If this song was a person it would be like the german teacher that passed me even though I stood a whole 3.5/10 for the subject

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): penis music-esque

**xavieryes** (10): One of my favorites in the album, could've been my 11 easily

**bbfan132** (9): kind of feels like a folk pop song with a ton of chaotic electric production added, i like it

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Mark is the music genius we don't deserve

**ctatkeson** (8.3): Hmm floaty, some things I really like

**GapeCod** (8): Louis main 1D boy.

**Roxieloxie** (8): SHIT MAYBE I MISS YOU

**welcome2thejam** (8): The post-chorus instrumental activates my fight-or-flight response

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): If I remember correctly I’m pretty sure they thought this was the ‘black sheep’ song of the album. I on the other hand think it’s a standout. The way that post chorus slams hypes me up. I also just really love Mark Foster’s vocals and how they are produced in this song.

**Stryxen** (7.5): Mr. You’s ex wife introducing herself

**throwaway7650** (7.5): production ☑️ (love the outro) but he sounds so whiny here

**modulum83** (7.3): this song is haunted

**seanderlust** (7.3): the instrumentals at the end are fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): Lol this is kind of weird but good.

## **Shit, maybe I don't miss you**

**gwenflip** (6.5): This song isn’t bad but it feels like filler and it blends in to the rest of the album for me

**BeauMeringue212** (6): Probably the most forgettable song on the album for me. The weird instrumental chorus is fun though

**musical\_pyn** (6): instrumental saves this from being just not good

**Uberpigeon** (6): you might miss me some day <3... *blaring clown music*

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): what even is this

**imsodumb321** (5): the chorus is annoying to me

**2dina3dworld** (4): the only good thing about this was the “miss you, miss you” and only that.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (4): This one stylistically seemed like it doesn't fit the album as much to me, it almost feels like a big beat song at points, like I could see it fitting into a Fatboy Slim album or something. I've never been a fan of this song honestly.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This song makes me feel tense

**waluigiest** (4): I think the melodies and the writing are a major step below the rest of the album

**Brendon-Urine** (3): Another miss, the drums are too loud and drown out anything else in the song. Also the synth/keyboard reminds me of that one GTA radio song that gets meme'd a lot

**ebooks #5454** (2): the buildup to the clown interlude feels like when you're playing a horror video game and you know you're gonna die but you only hear like whimsical carnival music and then you get murked

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1.8): The way he's singing actually makes me viscerally upset, sorry to be so negative but I wanted to do this rate to see if my heart would change on this era of indie. Sadly it's moments like this that don't do it for me. The instrumentals are nice though.

**fadedblue09** (0): Sorry the vocals are unnerving, and the outro is like summoning a robotic demon or something

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): I didn't connect with this track when I first listened to Manners, but a few years ago on yet another relisten, i really started to, and found myself loving the chorus, it's such an emotional rush when Michael starts singing "TALL IS THE GRASS IN THE MEADOW", and the drums intensify, and it’s just wonderful. The verses are kind of weak though, and overall this track ends up as one of the least memorable from the album, and it’s not a surprise to see it as the first cut from Manners.

**cremeebrulee** (6): This sure is a song huh … I actually don’t mind seeing this one go. I think the pre-chorus (“And another one comes down”) is super pretty, but I hate the actual chorus itself. I think those lyrics with the children’s choir are especially corny so I’m glad this is our first Passion Pit cut.

---

## **Short kings**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): you know what maybe i will!

**frogaranaman** (10): AND ANOOTHER ONEEE COMES DOWNNN

**ctatkeson** (9.6): Makes me so happy.  Seems to tap into some kind of innocence deep inside me.  I want to look out at the moon, or over green fields.  Distant childlike feelings come back to me.

**runaway3212** (9.5): Okay fine I love this even if I think it's terrible

**bbfan132** (9): really enjoyed this, michael’s falsetto works well here

**fadedblue09** (9): Refreshing and straightforward

**omgitskebab** (9): ethereal. i am ascending.

**welcome2thejam** (9): Very fond memories of sunny days walking across the campus to this. Love how the chorus just climbs and climbs and climbs

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (8.6): Um… Is this song really good or am I just really in the mood for this cute-sounding stuff after finishing episode six of Squid Game???

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): I just don't have anything to say other than I like it

**seanderlust** (8.5): indie bands and tree metaphors name another more iconic duo

**kappyko** (8): michael angelakos put that childrens choir to WORK

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): ok but what if my love is a short king??? what then?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): The children are back!

**modulum83** (6.8): it's giving filler

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.2): It's okay, the kids vocals are not my favorite thing.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6): Kind of a forgettable track, and I also don’t really love how the chorus onwards kind of reminds me of something out of Christian music. Overall again it’s hard to really hate this kind of track - this record has quite a few of these songs that are just… competently made, and at least aren’t completely toothless - but really it’s just all down to the songwriting that kind of isn’t on its A game for this kind of track.

**ebooks #5454** (6): NO MORE FALSETTO PLEASE IM TIRED

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s… okay

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): Pretty alright song, really like the outro a lot.

**throwaway7650** (5): lord not another children's choir... make it stop (edit: so I relistened twice and I can't hear it for some reason but it I was told it does indeed exists so the score remains the same) (edit 2: I hear it again)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): really generic

**RandomHypnotica** (7.3): hope you like repetition! I always really enjoyed this track, the lyrics kind of help me zone out and get into the groove of the song. But on critical analysis... yeah there's like 5 unique lines here and the song is 3 and half minutes long, this is a fine place for it to land. Also FUCK the space between the question mark.

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): I really had no problem with this song until Niki (u/GapeCod) pointed out that it was like way  more repetitive than the average TDCC song and it never builds up to anything else. It was very much a “HIMYM-glass-shattering” moment for me because I have not been able to enjoy this since. It’s a good first TDCC cut but I think it could have left sooner than this.

---

## **Maximalists**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): well answer the question

**frogaranaman** (10): that guitar solo is fucking stunning

**gwenflip** (10): this song used to be my ringtone no shame

**IIIHenryIII** (9.7): wait, the guitar riff sounds like *someone like you* by Adele 🤨 am I tripping???

**bigbigbee** (9): Extremely weird that this reminds me of highschool freshman fall, considering that the first time I heard it was roughly 4 weeks ago, and this song wasn’t out when I was a freshman

**fadedblue09** (9): Chorus is kinda lacking but the instrumentation is immaculate

**waluigiest** (9): this song is very funny to me like I could just put it on loop for an hour and separate my mind from my body

**runaway3212** (8.5): host play I Want It All by Sharpay after this challenge

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): A pretty nice change of pace in the tracklisting, even if the beginning of the song reminds me of OneRepublic’s Secrets or something, lol. There are some nice parts about this - especially the breakdown that happens at the penultimate section of the song, again the way the guitars come in are so energetic that it kicks the song into groove very nicely. But then the lyrics and singing kind of drag it down a little bit. Still a cool track.

**bbfan132** (8): this was v nice, i liked it

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Alex's vocals are so pleasant and soft. Don't like the weird laser sounds though

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Starts strong but gets too repetitive towards the end

**modulum83** (8): fun trivia! on this track, "do you want it" is said a total of 36 times and "all because you want to be" is said 24 times.

**throwaway7650** (8): omg I love the pew pew noises. it is rather repetitive however... one of those "all"s in the titular phrase was quite pitchy as well

**omgitskebab** (7.5): i do be wanting it all

**TiltControls** (7.5): I probably won't be the only one, but the space before the question mark annoys me. Song's alright though

## **Marie Kondo**

**ctatkeson** (6.3): Too repetitive.

**GapeCod** (6): We'll all take our [chances...](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/847144570621919241/896689631142244382/Screen_Recording_20211010-122326_YouTube.mp4)

**teenwitches** (6): needs to be way less repetitive

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): This definitely has more of a dreamy element to it with the production and I do like the verses, but the repetitive chorus doesn't work much for me here, although I do think they were going for something doing that specifically.

**Uberpigeon** (5): i dont want this song at all

**jman457** (4.3): Annoying chorus, but catchy production

**daythreeinmiami** (4): Oh the ‘pew-pew’ sound is back. But it suits this song to a point because they go wild with it in the verse. This is really repetitive.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.7): Everything about the delivery in this song is so limp and lifeless. Stop Making (no) Sense, Two Door Cinema Club!!!

**ebooks #5454** (1): creme said this is a charli xcx song but i disagree, charli could do "do you want it all?" but two door cinema club could never do "unlock it"

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Well I know that I don't want this.

## **We got a wide variety of answers here**

**plastichaxan** (10): yes.

**Stryxen** (10): YES ! Also why is there a space before the question mark ?

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): not rly

**seanderlust** (9): i sure do!!!! i sure do!!!!!!!

**skargardin** (8): I don't know, do I?

**Hulnia** (7): Nah, I’ll take a bit of it all though.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): if you want my answer, refer to track three of the High School Musical 3 soundtrack

**welcome2thejam** (5): For the last time, no

## **Nerds bringing up this song's time signature**

**musical\_pyn** (9): we stan a song in 7/4

**vayyiqra** (7): Giving this a 7 partly to be quirky because it's in 7/4

**camerinian** (6.5): The time signature is a really cool and unique idea, but I just don’t really think the rest of the song has the novelty to back it up

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): sometimes songs in time signatures other than 4/4 are worse. epic guitar solo at the end tho

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Unfortunately the odd time signature, which I do appreciate, also has the added effect of making the song seem that much more repetitive...

**cremeebrulee** (6.3): The way this song had my classmates by the throat a decade ago— some really popular girls in my school sang this at the talent show and it sort of swept everyone else up into a craze. At the time, I did love the quirky, homemade sound of this but I don’t think I share that sentiment anymore. It did feel like a necessary inclusion, but I’m not attached enough to be sad about this leaving Day 1.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): I’ve always been a bit of a Matt and Kim purely out of spite. Back when I first joined last.fm in 2015, and people actually used it for recommendations, they kept recommending Matt and Kim to me because of how much I listened to Passion Pit. I tried listening to all sorts of songs and didn’t like a single one of them, and yet it STILL KEPT RECOMMENDING THEM TO ME!! Anyway, Daylight is cute, but it’s obnoxiously upbeat tone was either love it or hate it.

---

## **Daydreamers**

**Brendon-Urine** (10): god tier

**frogaranaman** (10): I saw Matt and Kim live and after Kim whipped her tits out for the crowd she tore her ACL then they played this song

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Matt and Kim is one of the best live shows I've ever gone to!

**jman457** (9.4): This song launched like 50 copycats in the indiepop sphere for like the next decade

**akanewasright** (9): I simply love the piano line

**GapeCod** (9): [No.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/822600411406925855/891388558387085372/unknown.png)

**waluigiest** (9): the first time I heard Matt and Kim I could not BELIEVE how fresh that sound was to me

**ctatkeson** (8.9): My favorite from Matt and Kim

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Is this man impersonating a British accent?

**brendjac** (8): matt and kim is the most fun concert i’ve ever been to and this song was a RIOT even though it’s just ok recorded

**IIIHenryIII** (8): it definitely sounds like daylight; such a feel good song

**omgitskebab** (8): so fun! i loved matt & kim, until i read a critic review that said their lyrics r shit and since then ive not been abl to listen to them again the ame way

**throwaway7650** (8): wait the DIY aesthetic of the MV is cute

**Uberpigeon** (8): its nice its different its unusual

**vayyiqra** (8): Just a PSA: Hours ago I wrote "I can see why this band toured with Passion Pit. This sounds a lot like them but more upbeat". Now upon a second listen I have no idea why I thought this sounds like Passion Pit, even instrumentally since clearly the dude's voice sounds nothing like Michael's. Seriously, this is a WTF moment because this sounds like a completely different song to me the second time around. And this, kiddos, is why you should always listen to the songs at least a couple of times when doing rates.

**modulum83** (7.3): lizard brain says yes reasoning brain says what the fuck

**ebooks #5454** (7): fun

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): This song has always been timeless. There's a rawness to it I always liked and I like the piano driven nature of it.

## **Night owls**

**CrimsonROSET** (6): at some point in the beatsense this had 0 thumbs up and that was kinda deserved

**TiltControls** (6): where underground indie legend imagine dragons

**welcome2thejam** (6): Of all the bands I was super into as a teenager, I think Matt & Kim might be the one that I grew out of the most.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.9): I think this song has shrunk on me. Very early 2010s tumblr, something Jess Day from New Girl would jam to :(

**bbfan132** (5.5): the vocals are… interesting

**jackisboredtoday** (5.1): youtube recommended me "reading mean comments from the Daylight video" after this and I might just be writing one more for them now

**camerinian** (5): Maybe it’s me, maybe it’s the insurance commercials over the past decade

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I have a love hate relationship with this song. I feel like I’m about to get told about a phone carrier’s new EPIC phone plan for the new iPhone 4 but I can’t help but shimmy a little with the happy piano. I’m conflicted. And annoyed.

**seanderlust** (4.5): sorry, i find this one kind of annoying. also this song is inextricably tied with the late 2000s ~quirky girl~ aesthetic in my mind which does not help it :sob:

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Sounds obnoxious but not in a fun way

**Stryxen** (1): girl wtf

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): is this a joke song. this sounds like something a comedy group would make

**cremeebrulee** (7.9): I love the original song and I think this is an alright cover. It fits pretty well as an album closer. I don’t much else to say about it other than being glad that it didn’t beat too many other Passion Pit songs.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Despite being a cover, this track manages to feel like a really natural and pleasant end to Manners (ignoring that it's only on the deluxe, after two acoustic renditions of songs already on the album), and between Michael's voice and the sparkly production, it leaves this beautiful and romantic feeling behind, and is a really pleasant, *dreamy* cover of the original ~~unlike the other cranberries cover we rated this year~~.

---

## **Dreamers**

**frogaranaman** (10): MY LIFE IS CHANGINGGGG EVERYDAYY

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): I feel bad that this cover is my highest rated song on the album but...

**TiltControls** (9.5): another underrated standout on the album

**modulum83** (9.2): this is a very faithful cover of one of my favorite songs of all time i gotta do what i gotta do

**CrimsonROSET** (9): c’mon cranberries

**plastichaxan** (9): we love songs about dreams

**thedoctordances1940** (9): banger

**waluigiest** (9): I didn’t know this was a cover oop

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): I love how vivid, colourful, so authentically hopeful this track sounds - really reminds me of Madeon’s Icarus for some weird reason in how bright it is overall. Maybe I’m not as big of a fan of how the middle of the song goes with the ayyy-ay part but nevertheless I do think this would have been a cooler closer to Manners.

**camerinian** (8.5): here I was ready to make a virgin Fleetwood Mac vs Chad Cranberries shitpost comment based on the title alone, and then they outplay me with it actually being a fucking Cranberries cover Yeah ok well played this slaps

**teenwitches** (8.5): heavy emphasis on the dreamy aspect, but dolores o'riordan outsold

**throwaway7650** (8.5): very cute closing track! passable vocals and I like the sparkly production. anyway stream dreams/impossible princess by kylie minogue!

**ctatkeson** (8.3): While I appreciate the cover,  I have heard the original too many times and am a little tired of it.

**jman457** (8.3): “oh wow this sounds like that Cranberries song”, oh wait

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): I know its a cover but this actually feels like such a natural way to end this album when I listen to it like that??? it works way better than it should

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Really like this cover, very coming of age film vibes

**IIIHenryIII** (8): R.I.P Dolores

**imsodumb321** (8): It's...it's alright, but it's a bonus track, so my standards are lower. And it's nice when I'm in the right mood.

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (8): nowhere as good as original of course but still great

**LilacDaffodils** (8): I prefer the original by the Cranberries but I love this song so I was pleasantly surprised to see it come up in any form.

**seanderlust** (8): love when they just go apeshit with the synths with the gang vocals singing "aaaaAA! aaAA aaaaAAA!"

**SmileAndTears** (8): the only good song on this album methinks

**Uberpigeon** (8): passion pit the real rate chad ending their album with a happy song

**vayyiqra** (8): Not a cover song I was expecting, but it's not bad.

**2dina3dworld** (7): this is cute but the vocals are kinda irritating and take away from the really pretty instrumental

**bbfan132** (7): it’s pretty good but not my favorite lol

**daythreeinmiami** (7): This was a pretty good way to end the album. It’s a nice interesting mixture which I think really sums up this album. Apart from the first few songs this album ended up being really decent. Thank you Lorde.

**musical\_pyn** (7): I really like the original song, I don't think this is quite as good though

**omgitskebab** (7): its alright

**Stryxen** (7): it’s good for a cover but the original is UNTOUCHABLE

**runaway3212** (6.7): Not super special but fun nonetheless, kinda like this album

## **Nightmares**

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Kinda a weak song to end the album on

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): The original song is ICONIC but this cover doesn't do it justice at all. But still a somewhat good score due to the foundation of the Cranberries song being great

**GapeCod** (6): To have any man but to love only one, to wake with the moon and sleep with the sun, to be a sinner, a saint, a lover and friend, to know a beginning but never an end, to fly in the ocean, swim in the skies, believer in truth, defendant of lies, to know the purest love, the deepest pain, to be lost and found again and again and again, to know the power of wealth and poverty, to taste every moment and try everything, to be hailed as a hero, branded a fool, believe in the sacred and break every rule, to give in to pleasure with no boundaries, living in chaos and harmony, to feel the touch of a man, a woman's caress, to know the limits of torture and tenderness.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): It's funny, this sounds a lot like a Bleachers track with some extra electronic influences in it, yet this came first technically.

**kappyko** (6): girl what the fuck

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): As a general rule I don't really like male covers of songs originally sung by women, sorry.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): man dont do the cranberries like this

**ebooks #5454** (4): omg this has the same energy as Dreams by The Cranberries but that was way better

**welcome2thejam** (2): I generally like his voice but it is straight ruining this cover.

**Verboten\_Prince** (1): NO. NO. NO!!! HOW DARE YOU DEFACE THIS ABSOLUTE CLASSIC WITH YOUR WHINY WAIFISH VOICE AND UGLY SYNTHS!!

**intl\_orange** (0): only because it's a cover of an already great song so I don't count it

**nootnoot781** (0): this isn’t a dreams cover is it? OH FUCK IT IS EWWWWWWW

**RandomHypnotica** (10): We've finally hit the first track that really hurts me. I'll be honest, I've never found the vocals to be particularly annoying or bad until this rate, and I can definitely see why people would be turned off by them. But to me, it fits the frenetic energy of this track perfectly, and it feels like the perfect introduction to Manners.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): Hypno don’t read this, but I probably would’ve gotten into this album years sooner if this was not the opening song lmao. I will say getting used to Michael’s vocals on other tracks first has made this a lot more palatable to me (and this was originally a much lower score). I think this song has some of the prettiest production on Manners and I looove the part where he goes “So I try and I scream and I beg and I sigh / Just to prove I'm alive” but there are moments where he sounds so strained… so I really do think this is an okay placement for it.

---

## **Let there be light**

**fadedblue09** (10): Probably the best opener in the rate? Feels like I'm being warped to a parallel universe

**frogaranaman** (10): SO IIIII TRYYYYYYYY

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Usually with Indie Rock songs the lyrics just sound like mush to me until I look them up or listen to the song ten times but I instantly clicked with these… scream it out boys

**IIIHenryIII** (10): quoting AJayII, MaKe a SoNg, goddamnit

**kappyko** (10): oh i get it because its the first thing god did when creating the universe and this is the first song on the album very clever michael angelakos

**Uberpigeon** (10): MAAAKE LIGHHHHTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!

**ctatkeson** (9.3): An explosion of light, colors, sound.  Fantastic builds, killer chorus.  Both so happy and so sad at the same time.

**modulum83** (9.3): mAaAaaaAaAaAAke LIIiIiIiIiIIgHHt

**Stryxen** (9): ascending floating through space

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): that beginning guitar...WHAT an intro

**akanewasright** (8.5): His voice isn’t my favorite here but this fucks

**omgitskebab** (8.5): so fittingt that the beginning of the album sounds like fucking magic

**TiltControls** (8.5): me finally relenting after being stuck in a dark cave for an hour and wasting one of my pokemon's move slots on flash

**bbfan132** (8): the vocals threw me off at first but production-wise, it’s gorgeous

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is the worst opener in the rate but I still like it!

**jman457** (8): Good intro, wish it were a tad shorter

**musical\_pyn** (8): okay I really like his voice?? Like I feel like I should hate it but it fits the vibe of the song (which is good) so well

**runaway3212** (8): this song is good but it would've been better if he didn't sing

**waluigiest** (8): I like the writing and love the huge chorus. It makes me forgive the absolutely grating Sims 3-style synth loop that shows up a few places

**welcome2thejam** (8): Vocals could be better here and there, but when those synths smash into you at 99mph who really cares?

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (7.9): Probably would rate lower, but after that Two Door Cinema Club album, I'll take anything that's not boring.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): these vocals… sure are vocals! The chorus is good tho

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Some great synth leads, awesome drumming, and this song just soars as an opener. I have no idea how Michael can sing as high as he does here, but it's great.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): really good song vocals slightly annoying (at least not quite as bad as they can get on this album)

**GARjuna** (6.6): it's fine I guess.

## **Darkness**

**1998tweety** (6.5): wtf are these voquelles

**2dina3dworld** (6.5): he’s really using that voice,,, isn’t he?

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Not a bad start to this record but certainly not the best either - I think off the bat Michael’s vocals just feel way too high, almost to the point of strain, and makes the song way too whimsical for its own good. I’m okay with it overall, shines okay in the chorus when it comes together, but it feels a little too bright for my taste.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): The instrumentation is nice. It's be redundant to say this constantly in each comment, so I'll just say I strongly dislike this guys' voice, so this is an unpleasant listen for me. Between FTP and TDCC, I think these instrumentals here are the most dynamic with a good blend of synths and guitars, so it's a real shame. The voice is just a real turn-off for me, and vocals are the number one thing I go for in music.

**SmileAndTears** (5): Bestie why does the singer sound like THAT

**ebooks #5454** (4): the bgm was good but also what...what was that...

**plastichaxan** (4): hmm this is a scary first song cause if his vocals are like this i'm on my way to not liking one of these albums

**seanderlust** (4): the instrumentals are fine but his falsetto sounds so strained here, it makes kind of an unpleasant listening experience

**Awkward\_King** (3): whiny bitch voice ass wait i like the rest of this album

**camerinian** (3): this low key sounds like the cheap karaoke version of itself

**throwaway7650** (3): as the opening track, I'm glad this wasn't the first passion pit I ever heard (bless the hosts for playing the reeling in beatsense) because wtf are those vocals. if he consistently sings this way... I'm in for a rough ride

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): How amazing… Can’t believe SpongeBob decided to start his very own indie project! Hope he finds lots of success in his new career!

**daythreeinmiami** (0): I really, really, REALLY don’t know if I like his voice in this. At all. Is he off tune!? Is this real? Oh my god. This is really, really bad I’m so sorry what a shocker of an album opener. I have so many, many negative feelings towards this song. This has been an eternity. I am suffering.

**cremeebrulee** (10): To think this may have not been included in the bonus rate because I hadn’t heard it until a month ago. And now I’ve listened to it so many times that I might be on the … [Chuu global leader board for this](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/828772422034391080/898618031121514566/cat.png) lmao. It’s nothing groundbreaking, just a really fun, summery song and I’m sad to see it go so early :(

**RandomHypnotica** (10): When we were coming up with the bonus rate, I put this in there, largely expecting it to be taken out because it “wasn’t relevant”, but fortunately for me creme decided to listen to it and absolutely loved it, so we kept it. Unfortunately for me, not many other people seemed to love it. Most famously known from GTA 5, it’s an absolute blast of summer fun, and it just makes me feel bright and alive, which is something not many songs can do!

---

## **Drink from the fountain of youth and never age a day**

**2dina3dworld** (10): I’d bop to this at a party

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Why does this rate have SO MANY BOPS. I still listen to this song at least once a day. Side note I just wanna shout out GTAV for introducing me to this song. Now every time I go to LA I play this song and pretend I’m really rich when in reality I spent all my savings for a 10 day overseas trip instead of buying a house oh well live for the thrills.

**frogaranaman** (10): Miami Horror's music could punch me in the face and I'd say thank you

**GapeCod** (10): You could have secured /u/vayyiqra's ballot by including I Look To You instead.

**jman457** (10): Ive also never heard of this band before but holy shit this is so good

**rotating3Dtext** (10): let’s rate miami horror please please please

**seanderlust** (10): this was probably my favorite discovery of the bonus rate. which only had like two discoveries i guess...idk i really liked it and given that it's right up my alley i'm surprised i missed it when it came out

**throwaway7650** (9.5): I'm eating up the production in the bonus rate

**camerinian** (9): I only ever heard this song like three times on C4 (the Kiwi Zillennials know what I’m talking about), but that chorus line is seared into my brain. I’m so glad to hear this again and for it to still be a wall-to-wall bop.

**vayyiqra** (9): I knew this band name from somewhere and it's because they did a song with Kimbra which is on the same album as this. This is a really good song, so I will check out more by them.

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is nice!! i’d definitely listen to it in the car

**ctatkeson** (8.2): Another new one for me.  Tiny bit of grunge that I like.

**omgitskebab** (8): enjoyed thoroughly

**thedoctordances1940** (8): more fifa vibes

**jackisboredtoday** (7.9): I've never heard of this before this rate but it kinda slaps, I might have to make note of it

**modulum83** (7.8): incredibly generic and faceless, but great

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): summer vibes

**CrimsonROSET** (7): oh i just tuned this out at some point but it’s cute!

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): This always felt more like a disco/dance type track, but has a damn good groove to it. But on this record, Holidays is the better song to me, although this is a good track.

## **Sometimes ballots past the extension date are ... worse**

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): this should soundtrack a teen wolf scene

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): A very serviceable indie pop song.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I love the bass but hate the synth

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): This sounds like influencer music (derogatory)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ...what was I just saying about robberies? This one... this one hurts. This was honestly 2nd place for my 11. And I love pretty much every song here. But Countdown just REALLY resonates with me, lyrically, it just connected with that vibe of "we're growing up too fast, and times flying by, we're losing the best days of our life, but having so much fun.", it’s such a bittersweet feeling of growing up, getting older and having more freedoms, but also more responsibilities with it.Musically it strikes an emotional chord in a way not many of the other Phoenix songs do. It's also a bit of a tradition at Phoenix concerts for them to play an acoustic rendition of this song just before the end of the concert, while Thomas comes down to the crowd and does some delicate crowd surfing and singing, and having been lucky enough to see them live (the only one of the IPR acts I have unfortunately), it's a moment I'll always cherish. And it was absolutely robbed. What hurts the most is that this wasn't even doing *that* bad until the last few ballots. It was early Day 2, but I expected it to be much worse so I was taking it as a win. Then it tanked, and my heart broke with it.

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): I hear a song about getting older, I just have to automatically have to like it sorry. If I’m being honest, this song was done sooo dirty. I know a lot of people called it like 1901 Part 36, but this one is so much more bittersweet? The “Do you remember when 21 years was old?” line is such a gut punch, especially since yeah when I was listening to this music at 14, it did feel so far off. This really has no business being a Day 1 cut, let alone the first non-interlude Phoenix cut. (*Misheard Lyric:* Six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six, six // *Actual Lyric:* We're sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick, sick)

**teenwitches** (10): i die a little bit more inside every time i hear "do you remember when 21 years was old?"

**CrimsonROSET** (9.5): growing up fucking sucks.

**Stryxen** (9.5): DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN TWENTY ONE YEARS WAS OLD :catcry:

**GapeCod** (9): RIP Sean Lock.

**thedoctordances1940** (9): yess easily one of the most underrated tracks on the album, somehow this is the least streamed on spotify

**waluigiest** (9): it’s unassuming but this song has some tasty bits

**modulum83** (8.5): DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN 21 YEARS WAS OOOOOOOOOLD

**seanderlust** (8.5): i love the "Sick, sick, sick" etc. and how it sounds like a clock ticking. talented brilliant amazing

**bbfan132** (8): i like the drums!

**musical\_pyn** (8): I have no idea why I like this song, there's just something about it that is so good to listen to

**skargardin** (8): I feel like this absolutely serve at a festival, that can be said for the entire album tbh but still

**throwaway7650** (8): the "you"s and "true"s in this song sound like "chuu" I'm sorry

**ctatkeson** (7.8): liked the change of pace around 2:55

**plastichaxan** (7.5): “we’re sick for the big sun” omg so true do dark alt pop

**celladonn** (7): Sonically one of the weakest on the album, but "do you remember when 21 was old" does get to me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): A nice mellow song that feels sweeping in moments. A solid song.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (7): this song and 1901 just remind me of Lasso too much.

**Uberpigeon** (7): "Do you remember when 21 years was old?" still IS, oldheads!! who let you out the retirement home

**vayyiqra** (7): 1) If post-rock had more vocals it'd be this 2) On Popheads 21 is old, and I'm over 10 years older than that, so what does that make me? Undead?

## **Y'all are sick, sick, sick for these scores**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): I like this but I kind of have trouble identifying what the chorus is.

**ebooks #5454** (6): 5 seconds in: i already kind of hate it ... it sounds like lasso but worse

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): Lyrically I connect with this, especially now that I’m on the far side of 21, but it doesn’t do anything for me musically,

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Get it? I’m giving it a sixsixsixsixsixsixsixsixsixsixsixsix

**BeauMeringue212** (5): Just doesn't stand out enough, kinda forgettable

**daythreeinmiami** (5): The production is a little messy for me in this one but I like it when it goes gentle in the part where he says ‘we’re sick’. I also love the whammy guitar in the back but this is so loud. And how that key change came in wasn’t it for me.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): This always felt off as a song for me, almost like they were playing the type of music I'd heard in the verse of the song, but stretched out for the entire song with little change in said music. It's okay overall.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): not very memorable outside of the sick sick sick sick part

**\_\_Avaritia** (4): I just felt like I listened to a significantly worse version of 1901, it’s significantly missing some of the bite, the energy that this record’s better songs possess. Definitely another in the one ear and out the other kind of track, with this instrumental that is just a bit too aloof for my liking

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): susie dent outsold

## **Beyoncé comments**

**frogaranaman** (10): so true this is like that one Beyoncé song but completely not

**TiltControls** (9.5): My baby is a ten We dressing to the nine He pick me up, we eight Make me feel so lucky, seven He kiss me in his six We be making love in five Still the one I do this four I'm trying to make us three From that two He still the one

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): queen b outsold though

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.6): Beyoncé outsold

**jman457** (7.2): Beyonce outsold, but this is alright Ig :/

**akanewasright** (7): beyonce remains unbothered

**kappyko** (7): beyonce reference

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Having a song with this title is only gonna give me unreasonable expectations

**runaway3212** (6): Beyoncé outsold and tbh I really wish it didn't last that long

**cremeebrulee** (8.9): I think a lot of people think Torches loses steam after Houdini, so losing the three tracks that come after it on the standard edition checks out. I’m a little shocked this track lasted longer than the other two FTP cuts so far just because it’s over 5 minutes long and it feels like a weird way to end the album subject-wise. I quite like this song though. I think the intro with the piano slowly coming in sounds heavenly and the chorus is quite fun. I did dock some points because I don’t think anything here warrants (hahaha) the runtime.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): This track is very much a grower, the slow burning intro, the unusual lyrical content, and it's length make it kind of intimidating on first listen, but soon enough I found myself chanting "got to get away" with Mark (still don't know why there's a warrant on me though...)

---

## **Bounty hunters**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): run away with me dot mp4

**frogaranaman** (10): the fuck does Mark Foster have a warrant on his head for? shoplifting?

**jman457** (10): Perfect closer to the standard edition, gives Main character energy

**modulum83** (10): what the police have for me after i get caught breaking mark foster's restraining order against me

**waluigiest** (10): They take a relatively simple set of lyrics and turn it into an epic. I love this song.

**xavieryes** (10): A fantastic way to close an incredible album.

**bbfan132** (9.5): really liked this outro!!!!

**camerinian** (9.5): I always loved this as a closer, the freeing feeling with the summery vibes and the bouncy keys.

**GARjuna** (9): I think listening to this album in like senior year of hs would be super cool

**Hulnia** (9): The first half is kinda boring, but the second half is so insanely good. 😩

**IIIHenryIII** (9): and that's, folks, how you wrap up an album

**kappyko** (9): why did i think this was a dud before

**ctatkeson** (8.6): Anti chorus, chorus is kind of played down/ washed out surreal feel.  I like it.

**runaway3212** (8.5): omg i can't believe I got arrested for being too sexy

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): prison, honey

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Torches closes with a pretty interesting closer - I think it’s fine but I really wish that it would get started earlier than the first chorus and that Mark’s singing on this one was better - it’s probably the worst on this one, unfortunately, or maybe that’s due to a kind of ill-fitting melody across the track, I dunno. I do like the drums that kick in as well as the kind of steadily marching outro instrumental, and of course it’s catchy as always. Not the best closer they could have gone for but not the worst either. It’s a good enough ender.

**broppy** (8): poppy's note: he gave this a higher score after i told him it was my 0

**Stryxen** (8): this kinda feels like being on a bus but you didn’t hear that from me

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (7.9): This is probably an 8+ song, but I was a little distracted because I saw a video titled "Abandoned Pittie Finally Relaxes When Her Dad Sings Her Favorite Song" and watched it so I immediately forgot what I was going to rate the song.

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): This song has got a really slow start but once she gets going she’s going. The post chorus is so cheery like how can that not get you in a good mood? This song just has flavour. That bridge has some vocals in there that I don’t totally love but I still enjoy it. I just think the vocals in some areas are a little overpowering.

**throwaway7650** (7.5): this was SO good... then he started singing. but I like the piano!

## **Evading Arrest**

**fadedblue09** (7): ok but the drunk karaoke vocals in the bridge were not needed at all

**omgitskebab** (7): very much music of its time

**teenwitches** (7): a little too stomp-and-holler for me

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): this is ok

**ebooks #5454** (6): its like an ap literature essay but as a song

**welcome2thejam** (6): Are they finally getting arrested for making me outrun their gun?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I like the chorus but the rest of it I can leave.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): I really like the almost spacey intro to this song. It's not as grand as a lot of the other tracks on this record, and feels almost overly long at points. It's okay, not my favorite.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): this song doesnt warrant (pun intended) being 5 and a half minutes long

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I guess they can’t all be bangers

**plastichaxan** (0): i’m sorry i can’t stand this

**cremeebrulee** (7.7): I don’t love this song but I feel like I do have to defend it because its a little overhated. I think it’s one of my favorite moments lyrically on Manners. I know its a bit :peloton: when singers sing about how they know the object of their affection better than that person does, but I think Michael’s hesitation with “But I think I do” is adorable. I would have been more generous with my score for this song but the bridge vocals are Make Light-levels of bad for me, so I’m okay with parting ways with this.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): On my first run through of leaving comments for this rate, I accidentally forgot to leave on here, and I think that says it all. It’s a pleasant track, but not one I ever spend time or energy thinking about, and as a closer I think it’s not so strong. But it’s still Manners, so of course I like it, I just don’t love it.

---

## **Spongebob fans**

**imsodumb321** (11): This gets an 11 for the bridge [just let your body goooOOOOOO]

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): No idea what the heck these lyrics mean but they sound good on my ears.

**frogaranaman** (10): NOBODY. KNOWS YOU. THE WAY. YOU. KNOW. YOU.

**TiltControls** (10): Another amazing song that doesn't get enough love.

**ctatkeson** (9.5): Oh man, the build at the end of this song… It just keeps climbing.  Takes me to another dimension.  The peace pipe flute thing is a really nice touch.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): wait this is hated? This was cute

**kappyko** (9): ewwww the sea weed????

**IIIHenryIII** (8.7): the whole time I was reading this as "sewed song", and before listening to it for the first time, I was like, "wow, that's an awesome concept, I don't think anyone has ever thought about joining a bunch of pieces of different sounds to make a song", way to be disappointed ☠️

**jman457** (8.6): Really great song to end the album

**bbfan132** (8.5): very good outro

**modulum83** (8.5): so fucking adorable

**musical\_pyn** (8): really captures the tone of the album very well, great closer

**omgitskebab** (8): pure romance. again, the chorus bumps up its rating

**welcome2thejam** (8): I know this won't rate well, but it's a sweet song aaand now I'm reading the verse where they metaphorically drown

**ebooks #5454** (7): craving seaweed now mhmm yum

**runaway3212** (7): Walks the very thin line between annoying and good

**thedoctordances1940** (7): bop

**Uberpigeon** (7): countering akane

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): That shuffle beat on the verses is great.

## **Marijuana users**

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): This record ends about as okay as it started - not that remarkable but still a decent track all around, especially at the chorus which is particularly catchy, and it’s a pretty danceable track all in all, but I don’t really know how else to attribute the fact that this one doesn’t really click with me as much as he other tracks other than, yeah the song-writing is just kind of whatever, especially when the production is quite homogenous and with this same kind of flight and fancy for the most part.

**throwaway7650** (6): well the vocals are consistent on this album [derogatory]

**daythreeinmiami** (5.5): Look I’m going to pull out a Joel from Roomie Official here but it’s a *little bit pitchy* in the verse. The bridge goes a little bit too long for me and then it just goes into the same chorus with no real spice after all that so that was kinda disappointing. The chorus is alright but other than that it’s kinda meh.

**xavieryes** (4): breaks my heart to give a low score to a song called "Seaweed Song" but I just don't like it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): can you tell im running out of enthusiasm listening to this album

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): Oof I really hate the vocals here, it really bothers me in my soul sorry :(

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): The end of the album… god bless

**cremeebrulee** (8.8): This is definitely another Pandora radio staple, but funnily enough, I got introduced to this song (and a lot of other indie pop songs) through Gossip Girl. It might seem weird that a glamorous show like that would soundtrack their scenes with stuff from this rate, but I think it makes perfect sense. This track, for example, is sonically interesting enough to rope you into the scene, but subtle enough to not overshadow it. I do enjoy this track on its own, but its exit here does seem apt.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): Another song where their most popular (at least in the time period appropriate for this rate) is not their best work (Silvia and Black & Blue outsold), but Animal is still a fun enough time. It’s fairly par for the course for an indie pop song, and its placement here makes sense, but their album is well worth the listen if you’ve enjoyed this rate!

## **Animal activists**

**frogaranaman** (10): I love it when Miike Snow

**TiltControls** (10): BOP!!!

**waluigiest** (10): the way I would have given this my 11 omfg

**ctatkeson** (9): I love Mike Snow! Black and Blue is my favorite.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): I honestly would have used this album instead of Two Door Cinema Club. I love this track though, it's such a simple track with the music and the synths, and great sing along verses. Burial, Black and Blue, Cult Logic, and Silvia are all awesome tracks from this record.

**omgitskebab** (9): i shit shapes

**skargardin** (9): THIS IS SUCH A THROWBACK HELP

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): Y’all ever listen to a song and then immediately connect it to some other work or piece of media that has no relation with it? Anyways this song makes me think of this anime I recently watched called OddTaxi. Watch it, it’s great. Someone should make an AMV with this song… oh yeah the song slaps too

**jman457** (8.7): Another classic

**CrimsonROSET** (8): damn mike you get TWO is

**welcome2thejam** (8): A win for shapeshifting furries (i.e. the Animorphs) everywhere

**bbfan132** (7.5): wish there was a bit more to this but it’s good

## **The anti furry agenda**

**seanderlust** (7): it's not bad, but also if this came up on my pandora station in like 2011 i would probably not pay it much attention tbh. i just like....it's good musically, but i have no feelings about it.

**throwaway7650** (7): interesting song but don't like his voice much either

**gwenflip** (6.5): I wanna like this song but I don’t love it

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): lacking a bit instrumentally but otherwise fine

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): the fact that this is from the same producers who made Toxic... the range

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): miike will make it

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the instrumental bridge is contagious, but the song falls flat as a whole

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4.3): I think this song is super bland

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): I think this might be the worst vocal performance in this whole rate.

## **Genghis Khan came out in 2016 you fucks**

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (8.5): It's not Genghis Khan, but it's still great.

**celladonn** (7.5): I mean when it comes to this band Genghis Khan outsold immensely

**modulum83** (7): this really should have been gay anthem Genghis Khan

**daythreeinmiami** (4): Eh it’s not really my thing. We team Genghis Khan out here. Oh the piano kinda sounds like Genghis Khan….I guess I am getting a little bit Genghis Khan hahahahah I’m so funny.

**Brendon-Urine** (3): somehow never heard this, kinda assumed he was a one hit wonder with Genghis Khan... which I like a lot more

**RandomHypnotica** (10): wow, that ONE line really tanked this song huh? it's certainly a very... dated... line, to put it nicely. If I'd heard it the first time I listened to the song I think I'd have a much more negative opinion. However, having heard this back when I only vibed to music and didn't pay even the slightest attention to, or think about lyrics, I just knew this was a banger, that build at the end is absolutely cathartic, and instrumentally this song is one of the highlights of the album. However, it’s placement in the album probably didn’t help matters, as by this point in an album that has a very... cohesive… sound, fatigue has well and truly set in. btw, the real indie kids remember when this was called “Eat That Up|It’s Good For You” on Spotify.

**cremeebrulee** (7): I really tried tanking this song more for the line (like sure they were teenagers when they wrote it but God, it’s so fucking bad) but I really couldn’t go lower than this. TDDC is REAL lucky that the rest of the song more than makes up for it. There’s no shortages of repetitive choruses on this record but this one works especially well by showing how cyclical the narrator’s failed relationships are. It’s a bit depressing lyrically, but it bops (a running theme in this rate it seems). I don’t blame any of you all for 0-ing this and with so many better songs on Tourist History left, this can make its departure now.

---

## **Misogynists**

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Cool organ instrumentation on this one, it makes this track stick out a little better. Yes it still has the main trademarks of the tracks - metallic drums, kind of bright atmosphere, sticky as hell chorus (IT’S TOO LATE) that preceded it but its execution is a little too flawless to fault it anywhere. That breakdown that happens after the second chorus is *chef’s kiss*, it’s definitely a highlight.

**bridgemoney** (10): That instrumental break is fire.

**frogaranaman** (10): this song captures the high school indie experience well - drinking alone in your room and dealing with well intentioned yet mildly sexist quips from your friends

**GapeCod** (10): The best song in the rate to replace a word in its name with WAP.

**kappyko** (10): i hate the lyrics idgaf though a classic a classic

**modulum83** (10): this song is literally so intensely happy it makes me cry

**Stryxen** (10): manifest manipulate mansplain

**waluigiest** (10): one of the lyrical highlights of this album, and the way it grows at the end is great

**xavieryes** (10): i'm eating this up indeed, it really is good for me

**teenwitches** (9.5): the outro on this is fantastic

**bbfan132** (9): absolute bop, great song

**CrimsonROSET** (9): :audience:

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I think they meant... "listen"? When the song hit the 1:54 mark I ascended to heaven, and then I got to space after the 2:44 mark

**runaway3212** (9): The first line sucks but the rest is a straight up masterpiece

**throwaway7650** (9): my mom feeding me random shit yass

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Would be higher if the lyrics weren't so niceguy, but omg the bridge is so anthemic

**ebooks #5454** (8): i too need a quiet place to think and make descisions

**musical\_pyn** (8): is the opening synth the same as the one at the beginning of according to you by orianthi or am I crazy

**plastichaxan** (8): me with this album (except that one line in this song which made me take points off of it)

**SmileAndTears** (8): OwO what's this? synths?

**TheQueenofVultures** (8): This songs gonna get dragged for the opening line, but its a fun bop after that

**welcome2thejam** (8): Ignore that first verse, it's good for you

**ctatkeson** (7.7): Don’t love the chorus but still think it’s a good song

**jman457** (7.7): fun time

**GARjuna** (7.6): I'm into it

**daythreeinmiami** (7.5): This one is pretty chill. I like the pre-chorus and that synth in the back ground. I love that bridge and how it comes together for the ending chorus. But the long sustained note right at the end I feel could have been slightly shorter lol. I’m so nitpicky oh my god. I should be a Pitchfork reviewer.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Like the call and response vocals in the pre-chorus, and its interesting that this song somehow can be both lowkey yet upbeat at the same time. But the ending of this track just soars in the best way.

**jackisboredtoday** (7): bold to tell me to eat anything good

**thedoctordances1940** (7): really good song, especially the end, but the backing vocals suck, at least with headphones on

**Uberpigeon** (7): yucky blucky indierate

## [**:men:**](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/855120145185112064.png?size=240)

**broppy** (6): poppy's note: he lowered the score after i told him about the makeup line fdjsksdfj

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): “You know you’d look better if you wore less makeup—” *presses skip*

**akanewasright** (5): not that opening lyric… would be a 0 if not for the (unofficial) music video

**Awkward\_King** (5): ignoring the misogyny this kinda bops

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Meh

**2dina3dworld** (4): theres something cursed about this song

**camerinian** (4): there’s a smugness to these lyrics that these guys have been really good at mostly avoiding. Shame, cos the crescendo at the end fucking rips

**intl\_orange** (4): I'd rather eat junk food anyway

**darjeelingdarkroast** (0): What is this, poppy and happier Interpol? Why must post-punk (loose definition here) must often be so samey, I hate seeing a genre I love fall flat. And yes the makeup line is not good. It's a song that does nothing for me.

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (0): I'm so bored. When does this album end omg it's not that bad but it's just so boring. And don't tell someone they'd look better without makeup.

**seanderlust** (0): some TDCC songs can feel very samey, so you can't imagine my disappointment when we get to this track and i'm like "oh this sounds different!" and the first line is basically "you should wear less makeup lol"

Everyone sat through Let Your Love grow Tall??? 1901??? ROME??? and said brain closed but suddenly we get to this horny banger and everyone is suddenly a scholar with a degree in lyricism.

**cremeebrulee** (10): This score is entirely inflated by the fact that I had a little main character moment to this song 😭 It’s senior year of college, classes are over, and I’m just staying up all night with my best friend at the time for no other reason but because I wanted to spend as much time with her as possible before we part ways. It’s almost sunrise and at this point, my body is like FORCING me to sleep but I just didn’t want to! I was playing music off my phone at the time and the last thing I remember before knocking out was this song coming on shuffle. Literally I could not have picked a better song at that moment because as I was drifting off to sleep, all I could think was yeah this is THE life and it’s really just … mine. Okay, sappiness aside, I hate this is out so low and it deserved Day 2 at least.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): another fairly repetitive song from TDCC, coming straight after DYWIA as well, it falls into a similar place for me. The instrumental is extremely catchy as always, and the simple lyrics help me get lost and just bop, and it certainly feels less repetitive, but I can’t say I’m too sad to see it here.

---

## **This is the life, who'd argue?**

**2dina3dworld** (11): shout out to my mum, who agreed with me that this is a good song

**frogaranaman** (10): so true makes me wanna harass someone into doing something that betters themselves and their life

**GapeCod** (10): This being creme's favorite along with The Reeling makes total sense because the two songs are two sides of the same coin tbh.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): the lyrics and the melody are not that good, but who cares? It sounds great

**throwaway7650** (10): arguably the best song here, love the synth motif [2] (edit; nvmind it's just a guitar and I learned that idk how identify a synth properly)

**xavieryes** (10): this song is the life indeed

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): nice tune but Amy Macdonald outsold

**Stryxen** (9): honestly this is only not a 10 because i don’t want my album average to be above 10 lol and i couldn’t think of anything particularly special about this song other than it just being amazing fantastic

**musical\_pyn** (8): Guitar at the end is soooo good

**Roxieloxie** (8): zack and cody:

**seanderlust** (7.7): i don't know how to rate this album tbh. a lot of these songs feel the same and they're vibey and fun but....idk. like hearing a song you kind of like on repeat ten times, you know?

**bbfan132** (7.5): kind of repetitive but still good

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Cool but underdeveloped lyrically

**intl\_orange** (7.5): There's a Porridge Radio song I also like, "Barks Like a Dog," with a hook that sounds like this one's

**modulum83** (7.5): something vaguely culty about how often this album repeats positivity phrases over the catchiest guitar work you've ever heard in your life

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): a cute bop

**ctatkeson** (7.4): Somewhat repetitive but more interesting musically than the preceding tracks.

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Again a little bit of a slower pace, which isn’t too bad, but comparatively this song feels a little tepid compared to the rest of the tracklist since it’s basically emulating the same formula of the rest of the record. Kind of mixed feelings on the chorus, it pops in the song for sure but it’s a little repetitive obviously. The melody is just decent and I’m not sure what to think again about the abrupt ending. Still not a bad track.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): https://i.imgur.com/dv6oZsc.png

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): Hmmm...this beat is at least very intriguing, a little off-kilter. That's very cool.

**ebooks #5454** (7): this is what "do you want it all?" wanted to do

## **I guess these people would**

**runaway3212** (7): a tad overrated

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It’s fine but also very repetitive

**jman457** (6.6): Liked the beginning but it seems it has weird mixing issues

**daythreeinmiami** (6.5): Okay this is like SUPER NITPICKY but there is this noise in the high end that is REALY bothersome to me in the intro and I it really hurts my ears. It also comes back in the chorus? But other than that I really liked the song. But half point taken off for my ears.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): I love the lead in from the end of the verses to the chorus, and I really love the guitar tone playing off the vocals in the chorus as well. They also have a real cool ending with an almost bouncing bass beat to it and some slick guitar licks. Good stuff.

**waluigiest** (6): but is it the life?

**welcome2thejam** (6): Probably this album's biggest example of the guitars' sound carrying a meh song to a solid score

**Uberpigeon** (5): this is the life more like this is the five!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): This one is kind of annoying tbh.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): Probably the only time in my life a YouTube ad has successfully convinced me to purchase the product it’s selling, I distinctly remember seeing the music video for this as an ad in 2011, and at first it was a little grating honestly, but over time I really ended up liking the snippet, so decided to listen to the full song, and ended up buying it on iTunes! I don’t feel like this song has aged particularly well, but it’s still a blast to listen to.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): Personally, this is the same case as Friendly Fires where this song doesn’t do much for me but the rest of their discography is pretty solid. It’s a bit later than the time period of this rate, but Glitterbug is FULL of bops and hopefully we can rate something from it in the IPR2 bonus ;)

---

## **Twihards**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): … outsold kyoto maybe

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Every 10 I have given has been deserved and this song is just purely no exception. It gives you butter flies with the amount of energy it has. I just wanna get up and dance around the room like crazy while singing this at the top of my lungs. The end chorus just gets that blood PUMPING. THE WAY THAT SNARE HITS AS HE SAYS BEAST OOOOOO THAT’S THE SPOT.

**frogaranaman** (10): weird Twilight headcannon but I can vibe with it

**Stryxen** (10): this album raised me you do not understand i wish i could 11 this

**thedoctordances1940** (10): absolute banger

**camerinian** (9.5): I just love how all of The Wombats’ music sounds like it’s being performed at gunpoint.

**brendjac** (9): not as good as greek tragedy but still a bop

**celladonn** (9): Their album prior to this was the one I was really into but this is a fun song

**throwaway7650** (8.5): great production yassing [2]

**bridgemoney** (8): The Wombats take corniness to a whole other level and I love it.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): boppppp besties

**modulum83** (7.5): best song title of the rate

**ctatkeson** (7.4): Didn’t know this one either.  Not really to my taste.

**Awkward\_King** (7): lost 6 points for being english

**bbfan132** (7): it’s pretty good

**GapeCod** (7): I loved them on Only Connect.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): This one has a dance rock feel to it, overall it's fun.

## **Sean ihy for stealing my header comment but yes I guess this is just another song about Tokyo**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): It's just a little too English for me, sorry.

**seanderlust** (6): I guess this is just another song about tokyo

**Uberpigeon** (6): theres something corny about it

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Wow it’s like they took all the edgy song cliches and tropes (vampires, wolves, demons, beasts, the city of Tokyo, etc.) and stuffed them all into one song

**welcome2thejam** (6): I'm a sucker for fun backup vocals in IPR music

**jman457** (5.5): A bit bland

**IIIHenryIII** (5): the melody is an atrocity

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): ehhhh just an annoying and clangy song to me. It's so in-your-face but signifying nothing

**RandomHypnotica** (9): I can't remember where I heard this, and I can't find the source again, but I remember hearing that the reason this *isn't* called To Kingdom Come, despite being in the lyrics, is as a way to tell who was listening to the leaked/pirated album vs who wasn't, as they swapped the track names at the last minute. Anyway it's a cute bop and I wish it had just made Day 2.

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): It’s just an okay track for me. I think there’s far more memorable moments on Manners and it being in the middle of the tracklist doesn’t help either. Definitely fine with this being a Day 1 cut.

---

## **Bath & Body Works Annual Candle Sale**

**frogaranaman** (10): WHAT HAVE I DONE, WHAT HAVE I LOST

**ctatkeson** (9.7): Man I can’t get enough of the intro.  And the chorus… So good.  So beautiful, sad, surreal, happy, all in one song

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): When this starts it kinda sounds like “Pumped Up Kicks” and it’s not but it’s nice I guess… the shimmery section on the bridge really takes it to the next level.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): Eye am blown away

**omgitskebab** (9): that chorus gets me everytime

**teenwitches** (9): the religious imagery here is excellent

**Uberpigeon** (9): 🕯️👄🕯️

**jman457** (8.3): Solid and catchy tune

**2dina3dworld** (8): I like the drums but they feel like they’ve been put on the wrong song

**bbfan132** (8): chorus is a bit out of place but i still liked the song

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Oh this is cute. His voice really suits this song. I understand why this album is here now cause they really had me in the first half not gonna lie. But this album has really done a 180 on me at the moment. His singing is super strong and just really suits. This album has some really strong highlights.

**GapeCod** (8): The Russian word for candles is the same as for suppositories, so I can't erase *that* image from my mind when reading this song's name.

**modulum83** (8): i need a hug

**musical\_pyn** (8): Maybe the best chorus in this rate

**waluigiest** (8): I was ready to not like it but the rushed chorus over a disjointed little beat… art

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Cool lyrics, wish they were more audible though...

**Stryxen** (7.5): the intro started and sounded like pumped up kicks i screamed for my life girl i was on the verge of tears how many people were scared? me too i was really really scared. Anyway this shows pumped up kicks could have been a good song

## **Target dollar section candles**

**IdiotBox01** (7): one of those songs where the verses are way better than the chorus

**throwaway7650** (7): oh so they are capable of singing in a lower register

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): There's just a little too much going on here I think.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): Weirdly, I don't really know what to say about this song. It's pretty decent.

**runaway3212** (6): okay but imagine if somebody actually had candles for eyes how scary would that be

**TiltControls** (6): it's cute, but nothing special

**BeauMeringue212** (5): .Really just doesn't go anywhere

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): This song washes over me and I feel nothing. It started out with a good, compelling beat, but now it sounds like such a standard indie rock song I've heard a billion times without a strong personality of POV to keep me engaged.

## **I have literally never seen this much Na Na Na discourse before**

**bridgemoney** (9): NA NA NA NA NA NA HEY HEY HEY

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i hate nanananas in song, you’re on thin fucking ice

**ebooks #5454** (8): i wanna be as free willed as the guy singing "na na na" in the bgm

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): I like the nah-nah section of this song, as well as the sort of wondrous bridge when it kicks in, and it’s overall a pretty nice, entertaining track, but it’s missing a bit of the flair from the previous 3 tracks. I do like that it’s relatively straightforward but still manages to capture a certain joy in it well. But not really memorable.

**intl\_orange** (7): Most original chorus award goes to "nah nah nah nah nah nah hey hey heyyy," which is two nahs fewer but one hey greater than that Steam song and those heys really hit

**welcome2thejam** (7): The chorus leaves Na Na Hey Hey Kiss Him Goodbye in the dirt

**camerinian** (5): Don't really know what they were going for with the cadence on that chorus being so far separate from the verses. The na-na-nas do not help

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): *song builds up* oh wow this is promising, hope the chorus sounds good! *the chorus:* nananananana eh eh eh nananananana eh eh eh

I had never heard any of the Torches deluxe tracks before so I was super excited that FTP put this on streaming a few weeks before the rate post went up. But I'm also pissed because what the FUCK?? This is a much better closing track than Warrant??? Both have similar runtimes, but Broken Jaw just utilizes that time so much better. That instrumental bridge is probably the second best on the whole album and the final shouts of “I don’t know, I don’t knooooow” are such a cathartic way to wrap Torches up. I wish this could have snuck it way up to Day 2, but I think the lack of familiarity with it killed its chances of doing any better than this spot.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): Technically speaking, this is the most recently released track in the rate, having only *just* made it as it was released as a single to promote Torches X, the 10th anniversary rerelease of the album. This was originally available on deluxe versions of the album in some regions and digital stores (as well as [Chin Music for the Unsuspecting Hero](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lssIvyh6q4M), which was added to streaming only a few weeks after this rate started UGH), but it truly serves well as a final track as well. Mark's passionate outburst at the end is cathartic in all the right ways, and this track ties the perfect bow on Torches, and seeing it barely leave Day 1 is a shame.

## **Fans of /u/frogaranaman**

**frogaranaman** (11): literally one of the best songs ever made if not the best song ever made. has gotten me through good times, has gotten me through bad times. has done it all. I cannot think of a better song to soundtrack my life with than this one and I will be genuinely so devastated when this song doesn’t snatch the #1 position 

 anyways, **YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW, YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW, YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW, YOU SAID I DON'T KNOW, YOU DON'T KNOWWWWW**

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this doesn’t quite work as an album closer but it slaps so i dont care

**IIIHenryIII** (10): those screams are so cathartic

**jman457** (10): Why wasnt this on the standard version??

**runaway3212** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): a much better closer than warrant, the break down in the middle section is SO fucking good

**waluigiest** (10): This is really cool to me - I love how the whole song feels suspended. The chorus is this writhing melody over a slow beat. Then after the chorus you hear this filtered beat that sounds like the Houdini beat. It expands and explodes until the shouting outro and it’s just so grand. Absolutely an 11 contender, despite having come out literally 10 years later.

**xavieryes** (10): Bonus track but just as fantastic as the main ones.

**modulum83** (9.7): yeah cause this is fucking jaw-dropping

**daythreeinmiami** (9): So I always had the CD version of this album which didn’t include this song so I didn’t hear it until 2012 and to be honest I didn’t totally love it. But as I’m older I have learned to love it. I guess like with cheese, it gets better with age. This whole album was just slapfantastic. That bridge/outro ughgughghgghghgh. Yes. Listen to that passion.

**seanderlust** (8.7): HEAALL MY BROOKEN JAAAAWW YEAAAAAH :Scream:

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**bbfan132** (8.5): gets great by the end

**ctatkeson** (8.5): Another song with a compelling, funky, surreal tune and an interesting chorus.  Nice build too at the end.

**teenwitches** (8.5): the mid-song breakdown really makes this one

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8): it’s funny how this is an unintentional segue into two door’s album/aesthetic

**musical\_pyn** (8): feels like a different vibe than the rest of the album? Really like it though

**kappyko** (7.5): oh that was a fun song [continues] oh wow is this mother fucing orgiessuve rcij>>>??? [continues] eh

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Ah to hear Foster the People like this again 10 years later… while I do like most aspects of this track such as the kind of sharp beeping lead synth to this, I do kind of feel slightly mixed on this? I absolutely love the breakdown that occurs midway through the song, that alone constitutes for most of this song’s score, but other than that it kind of feels a little directionless compared to most of Torches. I still think the vocals are good enough and the chorus is kinda bumping, but it’s really just okay compared to the rest of Torches and I’m okay with this as a bonus track mostly.

**Awkward\_King** (7): this isnt related to anything i just cant stop thinking abt my friend who told me their dad died earlier today and my response was "im watching night at the museum 3"

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): Letting my theatre kid out for a second but this is the “It WAsn’t Meant To Happen” to “Houdini’s” “Losing My Mind”

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Never heard this one actually, but while it starts okay, the middle of the song suddenly turns into this awesome synth line and percussion groove which was infectious. It then soars into a climax right after this, and I do wonder why they didn't include this on the original release. I like it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): The beginning is somewhat lackluster but the second half is alright

## **People I should break the jaws of**

**ebooks #5454** (6.5): this song is like a high school locker

**omgitskebab** (6.5): nice. excited for torches x

**fadedblue09** (6): The way he sings in the end will surely break his jaw

**Stryxen** (6): oh no! ☹️ our jaw! ☹️ it’s broken! ☹️

**throwaway7650** (5): is the title describing what the lead vocalist was singing with

**Brendon-Urine** (4): I was liking this until the outro. MAN I do not like his voice. Huge MGMT vibes on the production

**welcome2thejam** (4): Loses me pretty hard by the two-thirds point

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): The synthline to just sounds like a worse version of Houdini.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): Foster the People go a little more electronic is not appealing to me. The yeah yeahs are not very good to me either. It's a pretty blah song, dislike the chorus having voices so far in the back, plus the irritating yeah yeahs.

**intl\_orange** (1): Am I enabling cultural appropriation by playing this song?
