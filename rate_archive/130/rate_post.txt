Hello popheads, and welcome to the long anticipated [Indie Pop Rock Rate](https://i.imgur.com/i08iCFV.png)! 

Let me take you on a trip back to the early 2010’s. Pandora was the most popular internet music streaming service and had [4 and a half times as many active users as Spotify](https://www.emarketer.com/Article/Spotify-Really-Threat-Pandora/1011790), Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was [living her best life as a college student](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qj2Xald7NYQ), and famous pop star and Battleship actress Rihanna [collaborated with MAC Cosmetics to release a small makeup line](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/rihanna-collaborates-mac-cosmetics-422660/), that surely wouldn't distract her from her music career whatsoever. Life was good, the summers were bright, warm and punctuated by the car speakers playing Indie Pop Rock.

I'm /u/RandomHypnotica, one of the lovely hosts for this rate, and I’m joined by the one and only u/cremeebrulee! When I first submitted this rate all the way back in July 2018, I had no idea how many times I would be submitting it, how many rates would come and go since, and [how many devoted fans this rate would get](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Va49DIiWccc), but we’ve made it here and I’m *so* excited. These 4 albums were incredibly influential on my taste in music, [they introduced me to the world of indie music](https://i.imgur.com/tjeHuZd.png), which in turn led me to r/indieheads, and then in 2017 when I was looking for a place to discuss Melodrama I ended up here. Now I’m a hopeless popheads addict, an established rater, and a full-grown adult (a rarity on this sub). It’s been a long journey, but I'm so excited to share these albums with you (and afraid of how much you’ll hurt them, you absolute monsters).

Without further ado, here are the albums we’ll be rating:

---

**[Phoenix - Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix](https://ktswblog.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/10/wolfgangamadeusphoenix.jpg)**

> As the oldest band in this rate, Phoenix have had a long and interesting career. First formed in the 1990s the band consisted of vocalist Thomas Mars, bassist Deck d'Arcy and guitarists Chris Mazzalai and Laurent Brancowitz, the latter of which was in a short-lived rock band *Darlin'*, with Thomas Bangalter and Guy-Manuel de Homem-Christo, who went on to form this [little-known act](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab6761610000e5ebca77d763703a93930c363a39). The band released several albums over the course of the late '90s and early '00s and achieved a modest level of success, mainly in Europe, but their largest hit came when they released the lead single off their upcoming 4th studio album in February of 2009, "*1901*". The song was released as a free download on the band's website. The single received immediate critical and commercial success, and Phoenix quickly went to work on a promo blitz, performing on [every](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rVNHZlR0kLg) [TV](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RulP4OXxFbM) and [Radio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fghkVm5yeZE) show you could think of. The album went on to be a huge commercial and critical success with 1901 topping the Billboard Alternative Charts, and the album winning Best Alternative Music Album at the 2009 Grammys.

>*Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix* is a sleek, polished burst of guitar-driven pop. Songs are laced front to back with hooks and earworm melodies, the production is refined but not overbearing, and the lyricism is subtle in all the right ways, enough to get you out into the sun and dancing. The album is a staple of the Indie Pop Rock sound and even if you think you haven't heard any of this album before, you'll probably recognize a few of the songs from the dozens of uses they've found soundtracking TV, movies, and commercials. Phoenix are in fact my second most listened to artist of all time, they are forever intertwined with the best parts of summer, and will always find their way back into my rotation at that time of year. I adore this album in every way, and you're bound to find something you love on this album.

**[Foster The People - Torches](https://images.genius.com/083f7f9997faf4bc9b02a03b1b1e37cf.939x939x1.jpg)**
>If you’ve only heard of one group coming into this rate, chances are it’s Foster the People and it’s probably through their massive crossover hit, “*Pumped Up Kicks*”. Funnily enough, the song was written in a couple of hours by band frontman Mark Foster at his day job as a jingle writer, which he took on after several years of failing as a solo artist. The song went viral online after it was put up as a free download in early 2010, receiving attention from the public and music blogs alike. The song’s popularity only continued to snowball when it landed on advertising campaigns for Nylon magazine and television shows like Entourage. It’s hard to explain how ubiquitous this song was— it became [Spotify’s most played song of 2011](https://mashable.com/archive/spotify-names-top-10-songs-streamed-in-2011), spent 8 weeks at #3 on the Billboard Hot 100, was nominated for a Grammy, and landed Foster & his bandmates a multi-record deal at Columbia, which is how FTP got started on their debut album, *Torches*. 

>Torches is proof that whatever Mark Foster did on Pumped Up Kicks wasn’t a fluke— the project is tight, catchy, and quirky in the best way possible. Its follow up singles “*Helena Beat*”, “*Don’t Stop*”, and “*Houdini*” all went top 40 on US Alternative radio and the album landed FTP a second Grammy nomination, for Best Alternative Music Album in 2012. But don’t let the genre labels fool you; Torches is just as synth-pop and dance-pop as some of this sub’s favorite albums. It’s full of whimsical instrumentation that are equally matched by [Foster’s songwriting](https://imgur.com/a/AOCOpTS). Even with lyrics tackling darker subject matter like gun violence and drug addiction, the album never feels any less bright and optimistic as it does during its happiest moments. It’s the perfect soundtrack to any new beginning— I often joke that this album basically raised me in high school; it was genuinely the only thing I would listen to on my knockoff Zune player at the time. To me, this album hasn’t aged a day but even if you’re coming into this rate without the nostalgia, I’m positive it’ll capture your heart the way it did mine ten years ago. (And how aptly timed is this rate that there’s [a re-release of Torches](https://twitter.com/fosterthepeople/status/1422046094855266309) coming out this fall for its decade anniversary? We love to see it.)

**[Two Door Cinema Club - Tourist History](https://www.thestudentplaylist.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/two_door_cinema_club_tourist_history.jpg)**

>It’s clear that the coastal Irish town of Bangor was something of a good luck charm to three teenagers, Alex Trimble, Sam Halliday, and Kevin Baird. The trio met in school and initially formed a band under the moniker “Life Without Rory”, which spectacularly failed when they competed and eventually placed last in an Irish reality television show for up-and-coming bands. It was only after a rebranding, where they had renamed themselves after a mispronunciation of a local theatre (“the Tudor Cinema”) did they start to prosper. Coming off an EP release in 2008 and some live performances that earned them a small following, the band released their debut album *Tourist History* in 2010, titled after their hometown and its history of being a seaside resort. It’s with their second homage to Bangor that they found success— with songs from this album landing in television shows, video games, and even a blog post by Kanye. 

>I think it would be fair to call the singles off Tourist History the 2010 equivalents of Caroline Polachek’s “So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings” in the sense that no matter what indie-tangential Pandora station you were on, the algorithm eventually found a way to play “*Something Good Can Work*” or “*What You Know*” for you. For good reason too, these songs serve as a really great and approachable entry point into the album. But don’t get it twisted, there’s no singles bias here— Tourist History is consistent all the way through, with high highs up until its very last tracks. While TDCC leans more indie rock than its peers in this rate, I think it’s accessible enough for any pop fan here to appreciate. The guitar work is irresistible and memorable, the lyrics relatable and dangerously catchy, and the songs are almost built perfectly for looping. It’s genuinely one of my favorite records from the last decade and I can’t wait to see people (re)visit it in the next few weeks.

**[Passion Pit - Manners](https://images.genius.com/13aa630f267cf9aa4005912b011ecac9.1000x897x1.jpg)**

> In 2007, college student Michael Angelakos decided to write some songs for his girlfriend, as a belated Valentine's Day gift. These songs were written and recorded entirely alone in his dorm room, with nothing more than his laptop. Michael decided to start handing out copies of the songs to other students on campus and the songs quickly garnered attention. In 2008, Michael formed the band Passion Pit and signed with Frenchkiss Records, and the songs were released as the Chunk of Change EP. Along with the college songs, one of the new songs on the EP was *Sleepyhead*. The song was the standout release from the EP and was featured in various media and advertising campaigns, and even earned a spot on Pitchfork’s Top 40 Music Videos of 2008 list. Following this exposure, the band recorded and released their debut album *Manners* in May 2009. The album included a remastered version of *Sleepyhead*, and new singles *The Reeling*, *Little Secrets*, and *To Kingdom Come*.

> The album was well received, and songs from the album found use in all sorts of media, including Gossip Girl, Skins (UK), FIFA and even [LittleBigPlanet](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3sk35a8U6A&t=1s). That last one was actually how I first discovered Passion Pit, and oh boy did I discover them. They are my most listened to artist by far, I hosted a song survivor over on the Passion Pit subreddit and ended up being a mod over there, and honestly, part of the reason I came up with this rate in the first place was to promote them further. I don't think it's an exaggeration to say I'm the most die-hard Passion Pit stan in this sub. I love this album with all of my being, the extremely intricate and layered production, the infectious, driving synth lines and the incredibly intimate, depressing and beautiful lyricism, this is definitely the most personal and emotionally confronting album in the rate, and I hope you all enjoy it as much as I did.

Rating these songs is optional and you **cannot** use your 0 or 11 on them.

#The Rules

* Listen to every song listed below and assign each of them a score from **1 to 10**. Decimals are allowed, but refrain from going past one decimal place - 7.5 is fine, 7.75 is not!
* You may give **ONE song a 0 and ONE song an 11**. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track! You do not *have* to give these scores, however, if you do, they can only be used on songs in the main rate, NOT the bonus rate.  
* **Rate all forty-four (44) songs!** If you skip any, your ballot won’t be counted (We will let you know if you do so you can remedy that).
* We ***highly recommend*** that you add a comment to your song ratings! It makes this a lot more fun for the reveal, plus if your comment is good enough you might even be lucky and end up featured on a banner in the reveal thread! 
* To leave a comment, add a space after the score and then type to your heart’s desire, like this:

 >    Little Secrets: 10 if you don't put a secret in your comment for this song have you even commented on this song at all

* You may also add comments for whole albums! You can do this by adding a colon to the album title in the rate form, like so: 

 > Album: Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix: I'm talking WAP WAP WAP, that's some Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix

* **Please use the pre-prepared link to submit your scores!** Note that if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout it may not work - as such, we have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, and you should use a computer to send in your scores if possible! If it still does not work, a pastebin with the submission form is at the bottom of this post and may be copy/pasted into a DM if need be!
* If you desire to change any scores after you’ve already submitted, simply message either of the hosts (u/RandomHypnotica, u/cremeebrulee) and we'll be glad to help!
* We will be keeping an eye out for sabotage, and there will be a minimum average enforced for the albums. If you truly do have very strong opinions on a song or album, leave a comment explaining why and things will go over much more smoothly.
