**cremeebrulee** (10): Please do not perceive this comment BUT I just fucking love this song so much, like from the moment I heard it as a teenager, all I wanted was to feel *this* in love with someone. Like I can’t emphasis how obsessed I’ve been with this song, because years later, I put this as an opener for an anniversary playlist for my first serious relationship. I should’ve known things weren’t gonna work out when he told me he didn’t care for the song at all LMAO. After we broke up, I couldn’t bring myself to listen to anything else on that mix… except this song, if only for the lines “I’ve fallen in love / and it’s better this time than ever before”. It’s such a simple, but hopeful line that reminds me like duh, of course you’re going to feel that way again someday, and with someone that’ll make you forget about the people that have hurt you. Okay enough oversharing for now, I’m glad this made Day 3 (even as a first out) and got an 11 (it was almost mine) since it more than [deserves](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/842981447034994730.png?size=240).

**RandomHypnotica** (10): another 11 contender of mine goes, but I am SO happy to see it just make Day 3. This song is just pure magic, I'm always a sucker for songs about pining romance, but this one in particular just feels so heavenly and gorgeous, and it makes ME feel like I'm in love. It’s sweet, sugary and lovey dovey, in all the right ways.

---

## **Simps**

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (11): Man I have so many good things to say about this song. It's such an earworm for me, I love how he delivers the lyrics and the overall simple theme of the song and how he adores the person he's with, along with the irresistible ooo la la chorus. Most of the track is the groove provided by the bass and drums throughout, but it compliments the song so well, and the ending where he's singing how he fell in love, with the noises in the end of the track making it seem almost like he's floating about how much in love he's in. It's so, so great, and my favorite on the album.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): None of you can see it but I'm doing that simp emoji thing with my eyes while listening to this. Runner up for my 11 btw.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Honestly this song also deserves 11. I swear you all better not do this song dirty. I still listen to this song at least once a day still and back in 2011 I used to listen to this song and pretend I was the main character in an indie movie. Where has the time gone oh my Lorde.

**ebooks #5454** (10): ive listened to this album so many times ooh la la but its better this time than ever before

**fadedblue09** (10): hmmm this is good actually

**frogaranaman** (10): devastating. I'm gonna go sit in my bed and wallow for a bit now

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This song has such a great build to it, a lot of these songs are consistent or front loaded but this one is just a steady slope of energy that keeps climbing until it’s over. Every time you start to get used to it it throws in some new, delightful little quirk. It makes me wanna melt like butter, ugh it’s tapping into the romantic parts of me

**kappyko** (10): Gay rights!

**modulum83** (10): big "hey everyone i just got a GIRLFRIEND" energy

**Stryxen** (10): i am a cancer

**teenwitches** (10): saving the title drop for the bridge is pure perfection

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I believed this was the peak of romance

**welcome2thejam** (10): You mean to tell me the Pumped Up Kicks guys did this? That the same dudes who wrote this earnest indie pop rock love song were also putting on their worst Joker laugh just two songs earlier?

**xavieryes** (10): A straightforwardly sweet and nice song that provides some contrast to the darker tracks on the album, while being just as fantastic as them.

**bbfan132** (9): total bop! i feel like i’d hear this in a restaurant at lunch time lol

**CrimsonROSET** (9): can’t relate but good for you

**gwenflip** (9): this is one of their most underrated songs imo

**IIIHenryIII** (9): who can relate? Not me

**seanderlust** (9): this title is me drunkenly talking to my cat

**SmileAndTears** (9): DISCOOOO😍😍😍😍🥰🥰🥰🤩🤩😍???!?!?!?!?!?

**BeauMeringue212** (8.2): Love the opening harmonica and funky piano post chorus.

**1998tweety** (8): me @gannade

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): Once you get past the kind of weird psychedelic opening, this is a pretty nice ballad-esque song that has, once again, a catchy as hell sing-along chorus that really sells it for me. Overall it’s just kind of pretty, probably missing some extra oomph that the first 4 or so tracks of this record had and lyrically slightly shallow but, it’s a nice vibe all in all. Hard to really say much about it though.

**jman457** (8): Love the intro and the piano

**omgitskebab** (8): pure pop

**runaway3212** (8): Phoebe Bridgers in that one really sad song be like

**waluigiest** (8): um the piano after the chorus?? It has no reason to be that juicy.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7.5): Piano wins! No awful vocal tics! What a happy time for me. No major complaints about this song with some fun piano. Instrumentals remind me of band I like a lot, Spoon.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A very cute little track

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I actually really didn’t like this one when I listened to the album years ago. This rate has made me appreciate it a lot more.

## **I never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch needs**

**throwaway7650** (7.5): vocals aren't absolutely horrid here but FTP please release the instrumental version of the album so I can actually enjoy it

**camerinian** (6): Honestly coming straight after Waste, which was a much more complex and honestly devotional track, this feels quite airless. Pretty, though.

**plastichaxan** (5.8): my original comment for this was "then make a song i really like" but then the next 3 songs came on so in a way, they did do that for me

**musical\_pyn** (5): genius describes this as a "love ballad" and I wish I was listening to that version of the song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): a pretty unremarkable song especially compared to the past 3 songs on the tracklist

**Uberpigeon** (4): i dont have room in my life for any "ooh la la"ing around

**RandomHypnotica** (9.9): Easily the most "acoustic" song on Manners, Moth's Wings gives me this very specific feeling of exploring a forest like a child, almost like something in Bridge to Terabithia. I'm not sure if that has to do with the father line, or just the feeling of the song, but I love it either way, and I'm happy to see it here.

**cremeebrulee** (7.1): A little shocked this made this far, but hey I won’t argue against another Passion Pit song making Day 3. I’m not that impressed with this production-wise, so it’s not one of my higher Manners scores, but the lyrics are really picturesque. Also Michael, I know I’m just like my father, you don’t have to remind me.

## **Can someone put Moth by Chairlift in a rate for my cohost's sake**

**Stryxen** (7.5): can we rate moth by chairlift please

**GapeCod** (7): This isn't the Charilift album... ~~pick me, hypno~~

## **Drawn to this song like a moth to a flame**

**celladonn** (10): This was an itunes single of the week in Australia, which is odd as I don't think it was actually a single. It is very good though.

**frogaranaman** (10): YOU'RE DRIFTING LIKE A FIREE

**IdiotBox01** (10): it pains me not to be able to give this an eleven

**teenwitches** (10): the grip this song had on movie/tv trailers is still unmatched

**xavieryes** (10): beautiful

**ctatkeson** (9.6): Beautiful theme.  Really really love the theme.  Seems to straddle the sad/happy vibe well.

**seanderlust** (9.5): wait this metaphor is gorgeous

**bbfan132** (9): really really pretty, michael’s voice sounds beautiful here

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I like moths and I also love the word wing, so this was destined to be a good song just based on the title. BTW, they have amazing song titles

**modulum83** (9): indie coming of age movie love-at-first-sight montage type beat

**throwaway7650** (9): the vocals improving? pleased to give a higher score then!

**Uberpigeon** (9): we are ASCENDING

**waluigiest** (9): so sufjanesque of them

**welcome2thejam** (9): The first 45 seconds are heaven.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): This has some interesting timbre on the instrumentation, a pretty metallic instrument (that I feel like I should be able to name but can’t) and those relatively heavy, low piano chords kind of makes this song a bit more dramatic and… fuller, that makes me appreciate it a lot more. I think this record’s vocals will probably take a while to get used to for sure, but I do like how hopeful and, again, kind of dramatic this song is. Interesting bridge to this where it kind of basks in its own glow of lush instrumentation.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): I liked this when it started but then got over it halfway through but then by the end I lide it again

**CrimsonROSET** (8): a grower not a snower

**jman457** (7.6): Sounds like a good a Merriweather Post Pavilion rip off

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is pretty but doesn't have a super strong hook.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): I love the piano melody here in the chorus and how it plays off the vocals. It really is one of the prettier sounding songs on the record.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Maybe if he sung like this more I’d actually like this album

## **Caterpillars**

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): This sounds a bit like a Flaming Lips or Of Montreal song. It's okay, just have heard more compelling versions of this sound.

**daythreeinmiami** (6): Okay this is better on this Passion Pit album. I can tolerate it on my palate. It’s okay. My mind isn’t exactly blown but its aight. I feel like it never climaxed. I like a climax…

**BeauMeringue212** (5.5): . Not that bad but very forgettable.

**musical\_pyn** (5): just kinda boring, nothing really makes this one stand out

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): sounds like a song that would play in the trailer of a coming of age movie

**runaway3212** (4): Sorry this is annoying to me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): This one falls under the “absolute bops i forgot existed for a minute” category, it’s just such a fun concept, the lead singer (Katie is her name btw) delivers an iconic performance that sells it all, and it just *works*. It’s interesting how controversial this is though (also why tf is the album version 5 minutes long it crawls)

**cremeebrulee** (8): I genuinely forgot about this until I saw Hypno put it in the bonus rate lineup LMAO It’s an absolute bop and as someone with a pretty uncommon name, she fucking spilled!!! Still, it’s a tad too long (and ‘Shut Up and Let Me Go’ is the superior Ting Tings song), so I’m totally cool with this being our first bonus cut of the day.

## **Oh na na, what's my name?**

**2dina3dworld** (10): what even is my name at this point

**Awkward\_King** (10): has this always been five minutes long ajksdjaks

**Brendon-Urine** (10): unironically a total banger. i believe in ting tings supremacy

**CrimsonROSET** (10): throwback to when i thought rihanna sang this because i confused it with ‘what’s my name’

**darjeelingdarkroast** (10): a fun banger

**frogaranaman** (10): this is so me when it’s not my name

**GARjuna** (10): THEY CALL ME JANE!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): You’re telling me this came out in 2007? I thought this was a classic one hit wonder from the ‘80s! Good for them, they did that.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): one of my favorite songs ever

**skargardin** (10): The nostalgia factor is STRONG this bonus rate omg!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): shout out to the just dance 2 soundtrack. gotta be one of my favorite genders

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): If you can't jam to this then I can't jam with you

**throwaway7650** (10): unfortunately, I can relate (whoo?)

**vayyiqra** (10): Another song I did not appreciate at the time - I thought it was kind of annoying and too repetitive. It turns out that repetition is its strength, and this is a ridiculously catchy song. Oh, and it turns out the Ting Tings' singer is named Katie.

**waluigiest** (10): they call me hoe…. they call me stacy

**jman457** (9.4): A Major Bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): I was going to give this song a way lower score, and then the chorus kicked in and then I remembered I’m a complete moron.

**BeauMeringue212** (9): I love how the drums drive this song forward at the start, indie pop anthem tbh

**LilacDaffodils** (9): a good song to shout

**plastichaxan** (9): this is a true classic i remember listening to it on a nickelodeon commercial it just had too much impact

**seanderlust** (9): shoutout to the person on genius who commented "womens names" on the chorus.

**Stryxen** (9): anthem i just adore this song its so fun

**thedoctordances1940** (9): I do not remember this song being so long but it still holds up amazingly

**TiltControls** (9): iconic [2]

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (8.6): I sing this to my dog ("that's not your name") and replace the names with all of his nicknames :)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I have never understood the concept of this song but it is a bop.

**ctatkeson** (8): Hmm another first listen.  I like it.  Kind of a fun song.

**dicahprihoe** (8): after all these years I still don’t know her name

**fadedblue09** (8): oh wow I always thought this was a Veronicas song

**GapeCod** (8): Gaga when someone calls her Alice.

**intl\_orange** (8): they call me in-die

**omgitskebab** (8): iconic

**Roxieloxie** (8): me that one summer coca cola did the 'share a coke with ___' and i couldn’t find one with my name on it

**celladonn** (7): Annoying bop

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): Man I haven't heard this band in forever. This song has the catchiest chorus ever that also is a bit annoying too. But the song has an almost an endearing nature to it. I appreciate how simplistic the music on the song itself is, with how well it works, and then the guitars right at the end are great.

## **They call me flop**

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): ...does she ever actually tell us her name

**bbfan132** (6): i first heard this at a water park with my cousins and one of them is named stacy - when we heard “they call me stacy,” we got so excited lmao

**ebooks #5454** (6): not bad but the biggest unconsensual earworm of me and creme's youth

**modulum83** (6): british people be like oi bruv this is my bahnd we're called tha Ting Tings

**welcome2thejam** (5): The Ting Tings have long been my example of a one-and-done festival band: where you do research on a music festival lineup, discover someone with a few good songs and think you really like em, have a good enough time at their set, but by next year they're practically forgotten and never heard from again (til of course, they show up on a lineup a few years later). That said, you do need said good songs to actually hook you in, and this is a true earworm.

**daythreeinmiami** (3): Why was this song so big? I’ve never understood it. I always found him singing in the back ground jarring and there are just some other production elements my ears just don’t agree with. There is so much happening in the end I’m overwhelmed.

**gwenflip** (2): i fucking hate this song

## **My guy, just submit your own rate with Young the Giant in it**

**IdiotBox01** (1): justice for Young the Giant

**cremeebrulee** (9): This song is a SMASH, idgaf idgaf. Sure, if it had won this rate, it would have just *felt* wrong.  But I also don’t think it’s fair to discredit how influential this song was in making the ”indie” sound more mainstream and commercially successful. I don’t think it’s shocking that it did so well (in the real world, not on this rate lmao) because every part of this track works, the eerie sounding verses, the chiller sounding chorus, and that annoyingly catchy whistle. It is really funny that people thought its IRL success would translate here, because this never had a real shot at winning. I think this spot is a good compromise— high enough to appreciate its legacy but not higher than some other standouts in this rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): and so, the evil(?) is finally defeated, but not without managing to beat an 8 average. Without a doubt the most controversial and well known song at this rate, it really feels out of place on Torches as a whole. The production is clearly much cheaper than everything else, thematically darker, and it just has a totally different feel. BUT it set FTP up to create Torches and everything after, and for that I am grateful. Just don't make me listen to the song again, I’ve heard enough for a lifetime

---

## **All the other songs better outrun these scores**

**1998tweety** (11): I'm Canadian so I can't relate

**broppy** (11): poppy's note: i knew this was coming he's listened to this song for years now

**daythreeinmiami** (11): No it’s not a typo. Read it and weep my fellow popheads, I gave it an 11. And I’ll tell you why, it’s all in the production. It’s that background synth pad that comes in during the opening and chorus, the creepy vocals and of course that bassline. Yes, I understand the subject matter, but music is music and I will always defend my favourite song of 2011, nay, the 2010’s.

**dicahprihoe** (11): I learned how to whistle because of this song

**TragicKingdom1** (11): really glad i had this song in middle school 😔💔

**2dina3dworld** (10): My friend went through an edgy phase as a 13 year old, and she was a teachers favourite because she had pipes. Anyway, those pipes led to her performing at a school assembly and she decided to sing “Pumped Up Kicks”. And no one found it objectionable, weirdly enough.

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Yeah… this is probably a bit of a cop-out score, and I once considered this to be the weakest track of the whole record, but the more I think about it, this song is just the whole package. I love how breezy and laid-back the production is, with the guitar just kind of thumping along in the background without much prominence, and although Mark’s hushed vocals were a bit of a turn-off at first I think I’ve grown to accept it for just being kind of distant, lackadaisical, in its portrayal of the of course kind of infamous subject matter that juxtaposes against the sort of carefree instrumental. It took me 10 years to realize this was a 10, but better late than never!

**BeauMeringue212** (10): I'm sorry but it's too iconic not to give a 10. The bassline alone is just so distinctive to anybody who was around in 2010

**camerinian** (10): There is no way for me to detach nostalgia from this. This is perhaps the single most important song in my development as a listener for the sheer fact that it was for me, like many I assume, a gateway to a whole swath of new, exciting, left-field sounds and topics, which is maybe a bit dumb to say about one of the biggest hits of the 2010s, but it’s true. Pumped Up Kicks was the indie song to start a lifetime of listening to indie songs, and what an intro. I don’t return to it as much because obviously I was 14 and burnt myself out on it when I had not much else like it to listen to, but it is so brilliantly crafted and hooky and it draws you in so effortlessly.

**celladonn** (10): I'm a little surprised by how well this still holds up

**frogaranaman** (10): the indie pop rock song that got me into indie pop rock as a genre and my first iTunes single purchase, cannot understate its iconic status

**GapeCod** (10): If this wins at least /u/Ghost-Quartet will be happy with one September rate.

**GARjuna** (10): this song still fucks.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): When I was a kid who hated pop music I especially hated this song (did you know it’s about a school shooting???) but as an adult lyrics from it were used in the title of a gay werewolf fanfiction I read so I revisited it and actually it slaps!

**gwenflip** (10): Is this song incredibly dark? Yeah sure but is it also incredibly a banger? 100%

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I wish I could whistle like Mark Foster

**jman457** (10): if there was any song that deserves to be called “a cultural reset” its this one

**teenwitches** (10): the product of a generation of kids growing up with the constant threat of school shooters and searching for a way to cope with our mortality. plus it has a cool whistle section.

**Uberpigeon** (10): boring rate winner but the hype is not unearned its really good

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't know what to say about this song. It's pretty much a perfect song. It was a tossup between it and Sleepyhead for my 11. I always liked this song back in the day and knew what the lyrics were about, so it was very weird and kind of sick that it became a meme in the late 2010s. It's aged well, I guess, about as well as a song as dark as this can. That's all I can say. A fucked-up song, but also a great one.

**waluigiest** (10): a little fucked that this got virally popular but I cannot deny that it is true excellence

**xavieryes** (10): I still used iTunes back in 2011/2012 and I know for sure that I have listened to this song at least 1000 times. Despite the incredibly dark subject matter, it's a truly fantastic song and will forever be a classic.

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): shoutout to all the losers at my uni who showed up to the foster concert just for this song: yall stupid

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the strangle hold this song had in me during my 2nd year of high school might be the reason i didnt have that many friends!

**intl\_orange** (9): Songs about school shootings shouldn't be allowed to be such bops

**kappyko** (9): hey lil mama would you like to be my sunshine

**modulum83** (9): this reminds me of a certain movie i watched back in 2019, perhaps you might have heard of it...it's a little film called the Joker?

**runaway3212** (9): It's so good but also literally wtf are the lyrics

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): As much as I think it’s a great song, it’s always bothered me how you can barely make out the verses

**ctatkeson** (8.7): Long time favorite of mine! Probably heard it too many times by now though.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.5): Is the beat and effects giving anyone else Great Value Gorillaz? I thought became numb to this song (and to the discourse surrounding its topic) when it was overplayed so much that it was background noise, but listening to it closely for the rate, it’s low-key addictive. The contrast between upbeat and sinister really did do something

**bbfan132** (8): loved this when i was 11, kind of grew off me but it’s still good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I had a temptation to sabotage this one. I'm not gonna do that because it's a really good song. I will say this should NOT have been the big hit off this album.

**bridgemoney** (8): At least school shooters have good music taste.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): As a song, the vibe of the entire song in spite of the lyrics is amazing, and is the best part of the entire song, along with the eeriness of the sing along chorus when you realize what you're singing. It's not my favorite on the album, but it's damn good. It's amazing how big this ended up getting.

**LilacDaffodils** (8): A classic

**thedoctordances1940** (8): It has some parts that are a bit rough, but like it's still a classic

**TiltControls** (8): at least 5 other tracks on the album deserved to get as big as this one

cremeebrulee: ## **The NRA**

**akanewasright** (6.3): Yeah this is a demo and you can tell. I despised this song when it was big and I’m barely softening on it now

**musical\_pyn** (6): There's literally nothing about this that should be popular, and yet here we are

**Stryxen** (5): this isn’t 5 in a meh way this is a 5 in i have very strong mixed feelings and i can’t 10 and 0 it simulatenously

**Awkward\_King** (4.5): i thought i liked this. i dont

**IdiotBox01** (2): waste of a good drum beat

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): If not for that one wretched TDCC song, this would be an obvious zero. Though the dark and unexpected lyrics are interesting in theory, this song is a total non-starter to me due to how it sounds. The sound is so empty and grating.

**throwaway7650** (1): so this is the song the GP yasses over... the hook is catchy I guess? the baby voice in the verses is #not it to say the least and oh god not the whistling after the bridge. I'm over the chorus by the last one tbh

**hikkaru** (0): i kinda feel like everything about this song is annoying and it's just exacerbated by the fact that it was a massive hit, the hook is repeated way too much and the vocal effects in the verses are weird and the whistling is obnoxious

**Hulnia** (0): Look, I used to like this, but it’s SO fucking grating. It’s only gimmick is the sad lyrics over the happy instrumental, and it just doesn’t do ANYTHING for me anymore.

**omgitskebab** (0): i cannot express my hatred for this song enough.and to be honest, isnt it just mark's song?? sorry mark. sounds boring and sad, its boring and terrible, not pop, doesnt even sound like FTP, and what angers me most is how THIS is their most popular song lol. everyones like "haha cant believe we were all singing along to this sad song at parties" at parties???? this song that sounds so depressing was what u guys were listening to at parties??? the vocal effects rlly bother me too. it also just doesnt sound like a ftp song. doesnt seem that upbeat to me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): DAE PUMPED UP KICKS IS A HAPPY SOUNDING SONG ABOUT A SCHOOL SHOOTER??

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): I can't be the only one shocked to see this place so highly right? Don't get me wrong, it's just as immaculate and catchy as anything else on this album, and the perfect taste of what's to come, but it's also not a track that comes to mind unless I'm already listening to TDCC. It’s also the least controversial song in the rate (leaving directly after the most controversial, that’s some nice symmetry) which probably explains the placement.

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): It’s a decent opening track, but I don’t think it ever reaches the highs of the bangers from later on in the album. I’m definitely okay with this departing before the top 10.

---

## **Where's My Juul??**

**Brendon-Urine** (11): dare I say... THE indie pop rock song? I'm absolutely addicted to it and have been for years. The "tell me your favorite things" transition into the horns is transcendent

**hikkaru** (11): bop

**2dina3dworld** (10): the opposite of Smokefree Rockquest

**CrimsonROSET** (10): fire hazard.

**frogaranaman** (10): why does this rate want me to get a nicotine addiction

**musical\_pyn** (10): this song just starts at a ten and doesn't stop, does it? And those horns at the end!!!

**runaway3212** (10): smoking is bad but this song is good

**Stryxen** (10): no because literally it (the album) starts in the theatre a noight aurf encouynters

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): one of the best guitar riffs in an album thats already filled to the brim with amazing guitar riffs

**throwaway7650** (9.5): sets the tone right away with the upbeat production, the lead vocals are probably my favorite of the artists so far

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**Awkward\_King** (9): gay men in the theatre

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): No idea wtf these lyrics mean but this is another great, high energy opener!

**GapeCod** (9): https://generated.inspirobot.me/a/YKemEgBber.jpg

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): hm they’re maybe tearing it up a little bit

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I was awestruck listening to this song for the first time.. I have never heard a Western band make a song like this… though maybe that means I just need to expand my own music tastes haha

**modulum83** (8.9): this kind of has anime opening energy tbh am i going insane

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): A peppy start that will set the tonal and structural blueprint for the rest of Tourist History, Cigarettes is a lovely track that features one of the more eclectic and cool percussion rhythms here - very metallic and staccato-esque, very lovely. I think the post-chorus instrumentation is very cool, just in general the guitar on this record has an excellent timbre that kind of reverberates in a fantastic way. This song is a good example of this pop rock formula working very well for TDCC, although it will tire out a little as the album chugs along. Also that outro was a little bit too abrupt for my liking.

**bbfan132** (8.5): fun opener!! the outro is great

**ebooks #5454** (8.5): this bops!

**omgitskebab** (8.5): love the way this sounds ahhhh

**BeauMeringue212** (8): Lyrics are a bit meh, but I love the guitar in this. The whole album has a very distinct sound and this song introduces it nicely

**GARjuna** (8): I'm really into this guitar

**IIIHenryIII** (8): smoking bad

**jman457** (8): A good way to start the album, love the horns

**plastichaxan** (8): now i know this title is so indie like omg aesthetic cigarettes in the theatre but don't smoke in theatres

**thedoctordances1940** (8): bop

**waluigiest** (8): “look past the blinding light” the billboard 100 did not listen to this song

**welcome2thejam** (8): The drop in the intro, the way the post-chorus instrumental soars... poetic cinema

**camerinian** (7.5): I just love the skittish energy this band has in the best tacks on this album. This is a great intro to that

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): A very brightly sounding upbeat opener with some great guitar leads. Good way to start the album and set a tone!

## **Stop Smoking (We Love You)**

**seanderlust** (7.4): i feel like a lot of TDCC songs feel a little too fast-tempo; i almost wonder if the songs would work better at just 5-10 BPM slower

**ctatkeson** (6.6): Not really digging the main guitar riff, melody seems a little vanilla.

**daythreeinmiami** (6.5): I only know one song from Two Door Cinema Club so this is all new to me except ‘What You Know’. So far I’m digging this. This makes me nostalgic for my old Tumblr for some reason. The end got slightly messy though.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.5): I love how this opens but the vocals completely ruin it for me. It's like if the main lead singer of Belle & Sebastian (love this band) was singing really really intensely trying to sing in a post-punk band, but with huge limitations. A singers' voice is a huge thing for me and it's a miss.

**IdiotBox01** (5): this album owes SO much to Bloc Party

**RandomHypnotica** (8.8): The first place I heard this song was actually the SSX 2012 soundtrack (shoutout to Tilt for being the only commenter to mention it), which also happens to feature Houdini and a Something Good Can Work remix, so this song was always going to be in the bonus rate as soon as we knew about it. It’s not my favourite of the bunch honestly, but it’s still got the most important thing this genre needs. V I B E S. I don’t know what they’re singing about and I never bothered to look it up, I just sway my head and hope it’s nothing bad.

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): It’s just synth-pop perfection, so I’m glad to see this make Day 3! I think one defining characteristic of a good indie pop song is that on an initial listen, you can already imagine like a dozen summertime memories to it (or maybe I’m just dying to listen to this on a road trip with friends). Song aside, indie pop as a whole is kind of overwhelmingly white and male, so it’s nice to see one of the immortalized classics of the genre be the brainchild of an Asian woman!

**2dina3dworld** (10): finally a kiwi song I can give a ten to!

**daythreeinmiami** (10): That organ synth just HITS DIFFERENT okay. It makes me want to shove my head out the window and sing this at the top of my lungs. Ugh 2010 was 11 years ago. Where has the time gone? yeAH EEAH YEAH EEAHH

**frogaranaman** (10): good fuck this just shoots you back instantly

**GARjuna** (10): once again a tragedy I can't give my 11 to a bonus rate song

**gwenflip** (10): This would get my 11 if I could, this is my YA coming of age hipster bitch ANTHEM

**modulum83** (10): as a Naked and Famous stan i have to give this a 10 and tell you all to listen to Passive Me, Aggressive You

**Stryxen** (10): omg it’s this song i love this song

**teenwitches** (10): nothing comes close to the feeling of playing this at full blast in your car with the windows down

**TiltControls** (10): ssx reboot fun part 3

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Literally one of my favorite songs of all time. It sounds so ethereal yet powerful, and so perfectly captures that feeling of confusing youthfulness.

**xavieryes** (10): tbh I have a grudge against this band because every time I searched for naked pictures of Foster the People members results for them would appear instead. song's really good tho

**IIIHenryIII** (9.7): infectious bop

**seanderlust** (9.5): this song is so good that i'm willing to ignore when i saw them live at a music fest and they looked bored the entire time and iirc made a passive aggressive comment about my city (which like...isn't even a small city?) but whatever it's a bop

**bbfan132** (9): very good, brings me back to this time period

**camerinian** (9): I was a Kiwi indie kid in 2010 where this was a straight up number one hit. What I’m saying is I’m lowkey a bit sick of this one, but The Naked and Famous are a fantastic band regardless. Go listen to All Of This please.

**throwaway7650** (9): a 9 for the production alone

**vayyiqra** (9): Need to listen to this band more. Why does so much good indie-pop come from New Zealand?

**jman457** (8.9): The Main character energy is strong on this one

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Outsold 5 Seconds of Summer.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): OH THIS SONG

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): The wall of synths and the high pitched vocals of this song are pretty iconic, I knew the chorus of the song without even knowing the artist or song title.

**welcome2thejam** (6): This is a must-have on any self-respecting Indie Pop Rock Road Trip playlist

## **The bittersweet between these scores**

**ctatkeson** (7.3): Too many times :(. Unfortunately this song seemed to age poorly for me.

**waluigiest** (7): I’m sorry but Youngblood by 5SOS kind of outsold

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I feel like I’ve heard almost this exact song done better by a half-dozen other bands during commercials throughout the 2010s

**darjeelingdarkroast** (1): This song has always been a big no for me. Very shrill singing.

**cremeebrulee** (10): It hurts to see my Manners 11 contender go out now, so close to the top 10. I have never felt so READ by a song before and I’m sure anyone who has also struggled with their mental health could feel that way as well. It’s crazy because, even with the the dangerously relatable chorus and the despair-inducing “oh noooooo’s”, this song never feels anything less than sonically gorgeous. It’s overwhelming but I can’t help but love it so much, it’s grown to be one of my favorite rate discoveries ever.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Ok, it's been a while since I said it so.... OH MY GOD THIS IS SO ROBBED THIS HURTS SO MUCH!!!... The Reeling being so close to Top 10 but missing out is just absolutely painful. It's got immaculate production quality, precious and delicate lyrics, the production is grand and refined in all the right ways, the children’s choir is subtle but totally adds to the vibe, and yet I can dance away the pain! It's everything I love about Passion Pit in one song, and I'm glad it at least made it to Day 3 and got an 11, but I just desperately wish it could be that tiny bit higher.

---

## **You’re the only bitch in the house that I ever respected**

**akanewasright** (11): This was the reason I was excited to do this rate, to give this song my 11. It’s just THAT good


## **http://www.betterhelp.com**

**bridgemoney** (10): How can a song about hating yourself sound this good?

**camerinian** (10): one of the biggest OH IT'S THAT SONG moments I've had in a while, and I'm so glad to have recovered this one from the memory bank. Existential crisis bop of the highest order

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ‘oh nooo’ me when this goes out #7

**frogaranaman** (10): LOOK AT ME, OH LOOK AT ME

**GapeCod** (10): Ever wonder what it's like not to be suicidal 24/7?

**kappyko** (10): sissy that walk!!!

**Roxieloxie** (10): I DO NOT KNOW WHAT THIS MAN IS SAYING BUT IM SAD RN AND IF I LOOK IT I UP I WILL LOOP IT INSTEAD OF FINISHING SO IM JUST GONNA SAY IT FUCKS! OH NOOoooOooOooOoOoo OH NOooooOOooOoOooooOO

**skargardin** (10): LOOK AT ME OH LOOK AT ME IS THIS THE WAY I'LL ALWAYS BE

**teenwitches** (10): the children's choir sound is so good for no reason

**throwaway7650** (10): bless the hosts for playing this in beatsense [2] fantastic production overall and for some reason I don't really mind the vocals here?

**vayyiqra** (10): Only Passion Pit would do a nu-disco-ish song about being a self-loathing mess (like most Passion Pit songs are tbh) with a children's choir and have it turn out good.

**waluigiest** (10): massive depression bop

**welcome2thejam** (10): If it can get my awkward ass to move, it's gotta be good. Also I love how a decent number of songs in this rate are catchy hooks and bright soundscapes combining with depressing as hell themes

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Wow this song is such a firework - at least a banger and a half here, and if the intro to the song with how the cymbals crash against the synth loop here doesn’t sell it, I find it hard to imagine what will. And the rest of the song glides along pretty nicely as well, twinkling brightly in a few spots while still maintaining this relatively dancey mood well. Perhaps it should really be going harder but, it’s still a great track nonetheless.

**seanderlust** (9.5): MARINA and passion pit handshaking on "making an "oh no" that's fun to sing along to"

**ctatkeson** (9.3): I can feel the madness inch by inch… Look at me oh look at me is this the way I’ll always be.  powerful song.  Again, wonderful/surreal/magical harmonies/melody but this time with a heaver dose of sadness.

**bbfan132** (9): :kirbydance: i’m enjoying this!!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): An absolute self-hatred ANTHEM!

**daythreeinmiami** (9): The intro to this is so good. I love the vibe of it. OH AND HIS VOCALS AREN’T BAD! It suits the vibe of this song. This is good! It makes me feel like I can take on the city streets at night and shake my booty and forget my problems.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): The introduction in this track with the beat is tremendous, and this almost ends up being a mixture of a disco and an indietronica track in the best way. Always loved the  vocals in this track too, and reading the lyrics I never knew this was a song about a guy with a mental disorder that is causing him struggles.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): oh yeah!

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): me in star dew valley trying to catch the damn puffer fishs

**plastichaxan** (8): lemme imagine this being sung by someone else so i can give a good score here cause this would be a 10 by someone else

**modulum83** (7.8): a little twee for me but the synths are nice!

**runaway3212** (7.5): I want to hate this but I can't

**BeauMeringue212** (7.3): . Love the bass and synth on this

**jman457** (7.3): A fun time, but nothing special

**1998tweety** (7): serve a bit

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): *marina voice* oh no! oh no! oh nooo!

## **Mentally stable people**

**xavieryes** (7): the beginning is fantastic, but gets kind meh as it goes on

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): this was going ok until the piano in the bridge

**Stryxen** (6.5): lemme pretend i don’t understand these lyrics i can’t handle this rn

**fadedblue09** (6): has some of my favorite lyrics but the vocals are too whiny

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this reminds me of some other song but i cant place my finger as to what

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5.8): This is a bland synth song. I can hear the pulsing beat and urgency in the voice, with some glitchy music additions. But it feels like pastiche to me and it's hard to connect.

**SmileAndTears** (4): the overproduction of it all

**cremeebrulee** (9.7): It’s just a classic! I’m gonna bring this comparison up again because I don’t think anyone actually read my Tourist History writeup BUT this is literally just the 2010 version of ‘So Hot You’re Hurting My Feelings’— because no matter what Pandora radio station you were on, the algorithm eventually found a way to lead you back to this song. It makes sense because I think if you had to show someone one TDCC song to gauge their interest, you couldn’t go wrong with this one. It’s fun and fast-paced and a great way to start off our top 10.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): I never actually really listened to this track much when I was younger, because I actually heard The Twelves Remix first, and this version always felt inferior to me (and it kinda still does). But the fast-paced lyrics, the chanting and the the light guitar make it such a perfectly breezy summery track, and it makes perfect sense to see it here in the Top 10

---

## **Optimists**

**gwenflip** (11): Inject this song into my veins

**runaway3212** (11): I love a good positive banger

**2dina3dworld** (10): something good can work! Like this song!

**akanewasright** (10): I’m kinda whatever on a lot of this album but this is just joy in a song ~~if the lyrics disprove this I don’t care I don’t hear any of them~~

**BeauMeringue212** (10): The melody is sooo good, the rapid tongue twister chorus is everything and the lyrics are very cute.

**frogaranaman** (10): why is this the only song with its music video uploaded to Apple Music

**GapeCod** (10): That's why Sweetenermore 2 never will.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): This really just grabs you from the opening lines

**IdiotBox01** (10): all of these albums are nostalgic but this song is especially HEAVY

**IIIHenryIII** (10): at first I was like, I kinda like it, but I'm not sure? Skip to two days later, and suddenly it's one of the best songs ever made. Damn, all these years I could've been bopping to this

**skargardin** (10): now this has really crept up on me, so insanely catchy

**Stryxen** (10): the crowd cheering is me and the girls in beatsense when pumped up kicks goes day 1

**throwaway7650** (10): really fun song (lyrics + cadence/melodically)!

**TiltControls** (10): more ssx reboot fun (...also maybe the first time I heard TDCC)

**modulum83** (9.7): having a crisis but i'm listening to idyllic indie pop rock from the late 2000s so it's fine

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): Definitely a highlight, and hard to really fault this song for being nothing but a good time. I still don’t know what the fuck Alex says on the chorus, but who cares lol, I think it might be his best vocal work on the record to be honest. It’s a really quirky melody but one that works extremely well. The melodies on this are just solid from front to back, and is just maybe a hair not as banging as it should be, but it’s still cool nonetheless.

**ebooks #5454** (9.5): i don't know if i have a comment i just love it

**fadedblue09** (9.5): This is inches away from being an After Laughter track

**teenwitches** (9.5): what a fun tongue twister of a song

**Brendon-Urine** (9): this was on a huge playlist I listened to every single day playing minecraft for an entire summer in middle school, the memories it brings are visceral

**CrimsonROSET** (9): not the bumper cars

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): This was one of my favorites easily of this album. The quick fire singing on the song work well, and I adore that bright jangly guitar riff that feels like the happiest thing ever. This really feels like the song the record was trying to go for the entire first half, it's incredibly catchy and an instant earworm.

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9): I always remember this mashup that was released by a band I loved that they were touring with https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0lzYr-DGJ0

**waluigiest** (9): idk what it’s about but this song is a pop indie classic!!!

**omgitskebab** (8.5): such fun

**bbfan132** (8): short but very fun

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Well it's good and it works!

**camerinian** (8): Do the rapid-fire lyrics work with the rest of the vibe? I have no idea, but the vibe is so strong that it kinda doesn’t matter. God those keys are pretty

**daythreeinmiami** (8): The verse is super catchy and the chorus is super sweet! I really like the way he sings the verse and the crowd shouting the lyrics was also really cute. This song has been a highlight for me on this album.

**jman457** (7.7): good bop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): big statement if true

## **Cynics**

**Uberpigeon** (7): its a bit hetty

**welcome2thejam** (7): Extra point for the backup vocals in the second verse

**ctatkeson** (6.7): Not really my taste, again somewhat repetitive.

**intl\_orange** (6.5): The last half-point is for the crowd-of-people audio

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): This dude has a true talent for saying a lot of things at once

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2.1): I've never heard less enthusiastic wooo-oooos, this song is so flat to me. It's very bland and doesn't move me at all.

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): A grower for sure— at first, I didn’t get why this was the second most popular song on Manners. And then of course, I got “higher and higher and higher” stuck in my head for a week. It’s the best utilization of the children’s chorus on the album by far, and is just a bright, joyous bop.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.1): The most 11’s we’ve seen leave so far, and a definite fan favourite of Manners, Little Secrets is one of the most accessible tracks on the album, and it's no surprise to find it making Top Ten. It's not personally my favourite, but of course I still have hundreds of listens to it, and find myself dancing whenever it comes on, because it drives worms into my brain (non-derogatory).

---

## **I guess only one person read our rate post in full**

**Uberpigeon** (8): my little secret is that when I was young i stole my mums card to buy seven whole british pounds worth of wii shop points and i bought this stupid fish aquarium game. I was so paranoid about being caught that i never played the game and hid it on the last page of the home menu

## **Let's take this higher and higher and HIGHER**

**intl\_orange** (11): I could go higher and higher and higher

**teenwitches** (11): higher and higher and higher and higher

**frogaranaman** (10): HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER

**omgitskebab** (10): i love this song. ive definitely snorted substances that feel like this song does (higher and higher and higher(

**welcome2thejam** (10): Only a few things better in this world than being in a large crowd all shouting "HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER"

**TiltControls** (9.5): HIGHER AND HIGHER AND HIGHER

**Stryxen** (9): ascending higher and higher and higher

## **MLM rights!**

**Awkward\_King** (11): daisybop ignore the sad lyrics

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): If this doesn't win it's only because r/popheads hates children.

**kappyko** (11): i'm getting rid of my teehee gay joke to say i do feel like it makes some sense to me that elementary school me was so attached to passion pit before even getting musical taste outside of video game music or figuring out i was gay (i know michael's bi, still!) just because passion pit's music definitely embraces a sort of ideal sensitivity and femininity. knowing that it's not about drugs, i def think this song is either about a mlm relationship or emotional whiplash. between this and "i would do anything for you," both make me feel in love, this one is the superior one

**waluigiest** (11): This song is an absolute joy! The synths are syrupy and the lyrics are ornate and relatable. I have nothing but love for this song.

**2dina3dworld** (10): okay the voice isn’t as annoying on this song and I actually like the children’s choir? Wow I never thought I’d say that but those children really are popping off

**akanewasright** (10): boppity bop bop bop

**bbfan132** (10): the bitpop elements in the production <3 <3 <3 his vocals work perfectly here

**bigbigbee** (10): They’re magic producers for making a children’s chorus sound not annoying

**brendjac** (10): if you gave this anything other than a ten, you hate fun and joy

**bridgemoney** (10): It was at this point I fell in love with the falsetto.

**camerinian** (10): One of the rare child choir sections that absolutely works and brings the track together

**CrimsonROSET** (10): oh this is what this album is about

**ebooks #5454** (10): they put crack in those elementary choir kids in the chorus

**GapeCod** (10): What I call the pins in my dms with creme.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): This hooked me like 10 years ago when I first heard it, and it hooks me just as much now. The synths on this track are just perfect with the groove it makes, and the chorus is as catchy of a hook as you can get. This might be the best use of a children's chorus group in a song ever outside of maybe Another Brick in the Wall.

**jman457** (10): pure nostalgic seritonine

**modulum83** (10): when i first heard those chiptune synths i knew from the beginning this was going to be a perfect song

**Roxieloxie** (10): THIS IS SO GOOD I DO NOT KNOW WHAT HE IS SAYING BUT THIS SHIT IS SO GOOD

**runaway3212** (10): Perfection in song form

**seanderlust** (10): i think this is probably the best known passion pit song and for good reason - the electronic synths in the bg are clearly having fun

**vayyiqra** (10): What a bop! Definitely a "dance the pain away" kind of song.

**ctatkeson** (9.8): Brilliant synth theme, outstanding build up to the chorus.  Many interesting musical elements working together seamlessly

**celladonn** (9.5): Bop

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): the children choir is so random, but I think I love it

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I think it’s cool that they got actual /r/popheadssurvivor users to sing on the chorus

**musical\_pyn** (9): chorus is really great! Love how it contrasts with the instrumental

**thedoctordances1940** (9): A song with fine vocals :oprah: and otherwise it's just a massive bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (8): While I guess in a sense I’m still not totally in love with how whimsical this record sounds so far, this is kind of where that atmosphere kind of works - I like how the jovial aura that this track emits, and it bumps for basically its whole runtime with its chirpy synth passages. I also kind of like the pre-chorus of this one a fair bit. Although this song does end a bit abruptly, hmm.

**Hulnia** (7): Since the rules REALLY want us to tell a secret, mine is that I can’t stop procrastinating. 😳

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.9): the vocals are a bit better here, probably due to it being less present in the mix, and it's catchy.

**SmileAndTears** (6): This could be a Carly Rae Jepsen song.

## **Should've kept these scores a secret**

**BeauMeringue212** (5): . This is petty but I hate songs with children's vocals in it lol

**daythreeinmiami** (5): Okay. I really, really like the production of the song. I love it. It’s so good. But holy moly my golly gosh just slap my knee silly his singing I can’t get down with. I’m so confused.

**plastichaxan** (4): this deserves the criticism ftp’s vocals is getting

**throwaway7650** (4): why did this require the children's choir singing "higher"

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): So he’s really gonna sing like this for the rest of the album huh? 😬 And he’s really gonna keep up this bombastic glitchy production too huh? 😬😬 Also I hate little kid chants in songs so this song is really going 0 for 3 for me lol

**xavieryes** (0): i can't bring myself to like this at all, it's just too annoying

**cremeebrulee** (10): The clutch this song has on those “pov: youre the main character in a coming of age film” playlists or the “I wish I grew up in the early 2010s :/“ tiktoks like who else is doing it like them… I totally understand why though; even on a first listen, this song just *feels* nostalgic. I can’t think of another song that feels this alive & youthful and embarassingly, I do get a little emotional listening to it sometimes dkskdksdk As much as I love this, I would’ve had mixed feelings on it beating some of the other songs here so I’m pretty satisfied with it getting into top 3!

**RandomHypnotica** (9): A song that found its way onto every indie kid’s playlists sooner or later, this was truly an inescapable sensation. So many weird little sections and parts to this song, but they all come together to form this weird yet incredible song.

Yes it’s stupid, the rap part is cringy, the twinkling synth lines are twee, and the vocal performances are borderline atrocious. I don’t care. Everything that gets this song so close to sucking only helps encapsulate its perfect youthful attitude. Tongue Tied is such an incredible package of young short-term thinking, wanting nothing but the incredible feeling of human connection and how losing that would be the most deflating thing in the world. The desperation by the end of the track is palpable, and the full-throated vocal performances alongside the massive synths and percussion make this sensation feel like the pursuit of that feeling is the most universally relatable motif in the world. Am I looking too deeply into this? Maybe, but only because I feel so much every time I listen to this. It’s as potent as when I first heard it, and I consider myself blessed I got to see this song played as one of my first ever festival memories.

**celladonn** (10): Mega bop

**frogaranaman** (10): the way this song has a deathgrip on the "indie songs that make you feel like you're in a movie scene" playlists

**gwenflip** (10): I’m so happy I was in high school for this song pt. 1

**LilacDaffodils** (10): This song reminds me of my tumblr days but through rose colored glasses. This embodies all the feeling of freedom from the constraints of your room since you don't have any friends and your parents won't let you go to parties to "make out" anyway.

**Roxieloxie** (10): TAKE ME TO YOUR BEST FRIENDS HOUSE MARMALADE WE'RE MAKING OUT OOoOoOoooooOOOH

**seanderlust** (10): i have no idea what they're talking about but boy am i having fun!!!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): when i was 10 or 11 or so i saw the music video for this song on tv and it always stuck in my brain for years even though i couldn’t remember the name of the song or what it sounded like and i tried for years trying to find it again until one day i saw a post on tumblr mentioning how much of a banger this song was so i looked it up and lo and behold it was the song that the music video i was obsessed with for years came from. so i have a special attachment to this song based on that story alone

**teenwitches** (10): if i had a car in high school, i would have gotten a dozen speeding traffic tickets for vibing too hard to this song

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Deserves 11 but alas

**TiltControls** (10): another 11 contender (if we were even allowed to do that)

**Uberpigeon** (10): i dedicate this ten to the glow in the dark dangly skeleton earrings from claires that me and creme both own

**welcome2thejam** (10): If there was one song to soundtrack and capture the feeling of every fun (but still fairly vanilla) party you went to as a teenager, it's probably this one (slightly more risque parties get that one remix of Heads Will Roll)

**xavieryes** (10): iconic

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): Peak main character indie teen nostalgia. Love how he belts toward the end too

**\_\_Avaritia** (9): The point I deducted from this song is from the period of time I put this as my alarm ringtone (a huge mistake on my end, not gonna lie). Fuck me if this song doesn’t slap though.

**bridgemoney** (9): I want that early 2010s era of indie bands getting mainstream pop hits to come back so bad.

**daythreeinmiami** (9): YOU CAN ONLY SCREAM THIS SONG AT THE TOP OF YOUR LUNGS THERE IS NO ALTERNATIVE SHOUT IT AND ENJOY IT BE THAT BAD BITCH.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): that's a bop

**throwaway7650** (9): the vocals are kind of a mess but what a classic

**vayyiqra** (9): Was this another formative song for indie hipsters? I remember I had an ex who loved this song, but I never got into it. It's a good song though.

**ctatkeson** (8.6): Another one that I hear around a lot and enjoy.

**bbfan132** (8.5): fun!!

**omgitskebab** (8.5): iconic, pure good vibes in a song. arguably one of their best songs

**Stryxen** (8.5): banger literally how can you hate this

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): bop

**modulum83** (8): rapping girl elevates the song

**plastichaxan** (8): me holding everything back to not say this was on glee (and this comment is clearly failing to do that)... the brain rot that show left on some of us

**waluigiest** (8): okay but the part where they count into the bridge is constantly stuck in my head for some reason

**dicahprihoe** (6): it‘s not a house party if this song doesn’t play at least once

## **My sister ebooks & her alts**

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This would be a 9 but the Birdo feature in the bridge sounds *that* bad

**jman457** (6.4): Its catchy but a bit annoying, Grouplove has better songs

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): This song is wonderful and annoying at the same time

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6): This is a nice song, but that damn chorus has been ruined by how many times I've heard it in commercials.

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): catchy, but I still find this catchy in the wrong way outside of the chant at the start of the hook

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I don't like how it feels like they're shouting at me.

**GapeCod** (5): :audience:

**CrimsonROSET** (4): dcom ending number (derogatory)

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): no thanks <3

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): Easily the second most commercial-core song in the rate, Call It What You Want is infectious with the fast-paced pre-choruses, the little piano melodies in the background, and it’s charm is irresistible. When i first heard it, i was absolutely obsessed with singing those hurried little pre-choruses, there’s such an attitude behind the delivery of this whole track that Mark pulls off really well, and I’m glad to see it make Top 10

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): With it being one of the most energetic songs off Torches, it’s no surprise CIWYW made it this high up our rankings. I love Mark’s delivery on the chorus, it just makes it so much fun to shout along with him.

---

## **Horny jail**

**Awkward\_King** (10): PUSSY

**modulum83** (9.2): i'd let mark foster call me what he wants

## **Normal comments**

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): The fact that these two incredible songs are back to back, wow! I love the sound of this one, it’s like halfway between garage band and roller rink, but I also think it’s got some of the best lyrics in the rate. They’re sassy, clever, melodic, empowering, this is giving me everything I need.

**musical\_pyn** (11): the slightly off kilter vibe of this track is soooo good, and the chorus is just anthemic, and the vocal processing end after the bridge is such a great final detail

**xxipil0ts** (11): Their best single to date!

**akanewasright** (10): I feel like this could be a house song. Like just add a beat, jaunt up the piano, you’ve got a club anthem on your hands

**bridgemoney** (10): Those damn keyboards.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): its the smasha

**GapeCod** (10): FIFA 12 turning me into an IPR incel... It's more likely than you'd think.

**GARjuna** (10): v fun

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I used to find the music video so creepy with all those random shots

**kappyko** (10): it's time for the twerkulator it's time for the twerkulator it's time for the twerkulator

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): I forgot how good this song is

**seanderlust** (10): me calling every song ever made hyperpop, citypop, disco and camp

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This is so fun to listen to. It sounds so unhinged and chaotic and yet it all works together perfectly? I’m gonna call it a bop

**xavieryes** (10): While Pumped Up Kicks was what got me into Foster the People, Call It What You Want is what established me as a fan. I remember when that freaky video came out, I was so obsessed with it, and when I added this onto my iTunes I listened it over 300 times in a row in a single day, and I listened to it on repeat several times afterwards.

**ctatkeson** (9.2): Love the funkiness, great hook!

**emayzee** (9.2): didn't know this song before this rate but lemme put a goddamn MARK

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): Lowkey one of the best tracks on the album. The verses fly by and I love Foster's delivery in them, as well as how it leads right back into the chorus. I mean how can you not like how he sings "You say, Now what's your style and who do you listen to? Who cares?". The whole track is just an earworm in the best way.

**thedoctordances1940** (9): it's bopping

**vayyiqra** (9): "Sampled In Lipslap by Kero Kero Bonito" What?? I can't find any source about this. Does anyone know if this is true? Either way, both songs are major bops.

**waluigiest** (9): love song by Sara Bareilles outsold

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): While PUK grew on me, CIWYW kind of grew in the opposite direction. All things considered in the context of Torches, CIWYW kind of sounds a little… bland? With just the piano chords practically blaring in your face in this spacey atmosphere that already the rest of the songs will deliver on, there’s not really much going in the way of production and the vocals are just okay (like with the rest of the record). Still, I ADORED this song when I first heard it, and even now I think the timbre of the piano sounds interesting enough and the melody itself is good enough for me to like it still, although I’m not as enamoured by it as I was before. Also kinda hippie-ish lyrics to this one, huh.

**bbfan132** (8.5): liked this quite a bit!

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): Love the piano in this, also brings back FIFA memories lol

**bigbigbee** (8.5): Yo why does like every song of their sound like an album opener

**fadedblue09** (8): another song i heard from a trailer

**welcome2thejam** (8): Catchy as hell pre-chorus

**jman457** (7.7): Fun pop tune

**omgitskebab** (7.5): love it

**daythreeinmiami** (7): I remember I got the video clip for this for free on iTunes but I can’t remember why. Either way I enjoyed it. I love the bridge instrumental of this song a lot too.

**ebooks #5454** (7): i feel like he's yelling at me and i'm scared

**Stryxen** (7): got me feeling like i’m in a fancam

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.1): This has a nice piano moment and a good beat, better harmonies than before. Those "eh ehs" I dislike, they're so weak.

## **I call it _**

**frogaranaman** (10): I'm gonna call it an indie pop rock banger that's what

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I call it a great song.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i call it really fucking good

**Uberpigeon** (8): i call it an eight

**celladonn** (6): I call it mid

**plastichaxan** (6): i kinda want to call it mid

**intl\_orange** (4): I call it "meh"

## **Swiftie section**

**2dina3dworld** (10): TDCC predicted reputation

**throwaway7650** (9.5): easily the best song so far, more tolerable vocals + catchy melodies + the chorus is an earworm etc. they outsold taylor I fear

**runaway3212** (7.5): stale topic

**gwenflip** (7): Not gonna lie it’s not my favorite CIWYW

**jackisboredtoday** (7): fine but i hate to admit t@ylor had the better song with this title

**SmileAndTears** (7): something something taylor swift idk i never listened to reputation

**Brendon-Urine** (5.5): Tied for my favorite song titled "Call It What You Want". Also - one of two songs I know with that title.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): Storytime: Picture a little Hypno in 2009. I was struggling to keep friends at school at the time, and I was going to be moving to a high school that nobody else was going to in a year, so there was a lot going on. I felt so insecure about myself (still do) and despite enjoying schoolwork, I hated going to school because I was so lonely. At home, there was one thing that always made me feel better, than no matter what, I could come back to it and it was comfort food. LittleBigPlanet. Everything about that game spoke to me, I would spend hours replaying the campaign, making my own (very terrible) levels, and playing bomb survival levels and random "story" levels that were dropped at part 2/28. The game felt so warm, comforting, and safe, and, as corny as it sounds, it was truly an escape for me. Fast forward to 2010 when I've started high school, and as suspected, I'm having some trouble making friends. I wake up one Saturday morning and see a headline on IGN. "LittleBigPlanet 2 Announced". I immediately rush to go and watch the [trailer.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n3sk35a8U6A) The combination of the warm, thankful messages shown on screen about appreciating the fans, the joy of my favourite game getting a sequel, and this song just made me break down and cry. I was fully sobbing, an ugly mess. 

But the thing that stood out to me most was the song. It was unlike anything else I'd ever heard. There was so much going on, this weird high pitched voice was so entrancing, the production was so rapid fire and full and layered, and the whole thing just sounded absolutely magical. I ended up finding the full song and needed to listen to it more, and with that, I had discovered what would become my favourite artist. This song is an absolute treasure to me, and for the first month or so of the rate, it seemed like this had an unbeatable lead, and I was overjoyed. But then some of the lowest scores came in, and it dropped out. I thought it would still be able to catch up. Yet more low scores kept coming in, and eventually it became clear it was never happening. I'm shattered that this didn't end up making at least the Top 5, but I'm so glad that I was able to at least introduce and share the track with people who might otherwise never have heard it. And the song will always hold a special place in my heart, and many others, and I’m glad we at least got to rate it.

**cremeebrulee** (10): And here we part ways with Passion Pit, who are leaving before Top 5 (sorry to everyone who included this or Little Secrets in your predictions, I’m just as hurt as you guys are!) Hypno and I both previously hosted rates where the winner hadn’t changed at all during ballot collection, so as soon we saw Sleepyhead become our first winner (and staying that way for quite a while), we were elated. Manners was my least explored album in the rate, but even I knew what a freaking CLASSIC this song is. Every second of this track brings you something new to keep you on your toes— those crashing synths, the gorgeous use of the sample, the opening “AND YOU SAIDDD” to the closing, cathartic release of Michael screaming “GO AHEADDD”. It’s poignant and powerful, and I get why someone wouldn’t like this, but I can’t help but wish it made it further in the end. Here’s to hoping that we get IPR2 in the future soon because I promise you, Gossamer is coming to enact its revenge!!

## **Dreamers**

**bridgemoney** (11): One of the greatest indie-pop songs ever created. It's literally impossible for me to listen to that synth loop part and not feel at least 20% happier, even though the lyrics have such a somber quality to them. I keep imagining someone being taken away to a colorful fantasy world in a children's movie, getting pulled back to reality by the power of Michael Angelakos' heavenly falsetto. Hope this at least breaks the top 5.

**ctatkeson** (11): So many epic things coming together in this song.  Consistently one of my top songs.  Bursting with creativity, color, melodically and harmonically perfect.  Passion Pit finds away to weave three or four magical themes together into one creation!

**omgitskebab** (11): just try and tell me this song isn't... MAGIC. its an aural explosion took this as its bueprint we'd all be better off

**seanderlust** (11): that was fighting for tired gay rights...people were killed....

**TiltControls** (11): funny thing about Passion Pit was that I first learned of them through LBP commercials and this song. It's so good though and I'm glad I discovered the rest of their music from there!

**vayyiqra** (11): This song is just beautiful. It will get stuck in your head and never leave. OVERSHARE TIME: I also wish I didn't, but I relate to the lyrics so much, having had depression my whole life. I read that Michael wrote this song for his girlfriend for Valentine's Day as a kind of apology about how much he would oversleep during his depressive episodes. I can confirm it makes you extremely tired and sleep a lot, which makes it very hard to do normie things like work and keep friendships and relationships which is very cool and lots of fun. (Source: https://www.stereogum.com/2014536/passion-pit-chunk-of-change-turns-10/reviews/the-anniversary/) A big reason I like Passion Pit is how Michael can write about such specific and relatable moods so poetically. Anyway, even if you don't relate to the lyrics or care about them, it's still such a pretty song.

**akanewasright** (10): GOD THIS SONG IS SO GOOD AAAAA

**Awkward\_King** (10): the smasha

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This vocal performance really should be grating but somehow it's not. Some kind of magic is going on.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this is what a stroke sounds like

**daythreeinmiami** (10): Okay so I have a really weird story about this song. In 2015 I went and ate at a new burger place that had opened up and for some reason they were playing this song on repeat. It was my first introduction to it. I felt so sorry for the staff as they really looked dead inside. There was no reason at all for this song to be playing on a continual loop but it grew on me by the 4th listen.

**frogaranaman** (10): BEGONIA SKIESSS LIKE A SLEEPYHEADDDDD SLEEPYHEADDDDDDDDD

**GapeCod** (10): [Michael's therapist's name] if you read this im free on Thursday night and would like to hang out. Please respond to this and then hang out with me on Thursday night when I’m free.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): Now you know I love it when a track gets weird and this is kinda weird. There’s just so much going on? The garbled vocals, the tinkling bells, those synths that are skittering all over the track like spiders, it’s like they plucked a dream out of your head and played it on the track.

**Hulnia** (10): A true standout track on here (and in the rate), I’ll never get this out of my head. 😩

**IIIHenryIII** (10): excuse me! You can't just come in here and try to claim the 11 that doesn't belong to you. It's Houdini's possession

**musical\_pyn** (10): if the outro was longer I would easily give this my 11

**runaway3212** (10): this is hyperpop

**Stryxen** (10): this song invented many genres, ended many careers, prevented many natural disasters

**teenwitches** (10): this one grows and grows til it explodes into ecstasy

**welcome2thejam** (10): My ears just legit perked up on the intro. I think anyone who was into this kind of music back then lights up when the Sleepyhead beat kicks in.

**bbfan132** (9.5): definitely recognize this, it’s great

**jman457** (9.1): classic

**1998tweety** (9): bops tbh

**Brendon-Urine** (9): the only song I have memories with on this album, and it still hits 12 years later.

**camerinian** (9): I need to be in a specific mood I enjoy this, but my god what a brilliant mood piece

**celladonn** (9): That sample is so good

**GARjuna** (9): this fucks

cremeebrulee: ## **I can't tell if these comments are positive or negative, so I'm labelling this the sleep paralysis section**

**waluigiest** (9): I sleep

**modulum83** (8.7): i totally would have written these lyrics down on a piece of paper and given it to my crush while passing it off as my own poetry

**Exciting\_Patient4872** (8.5): This sounds awful but I am really enjoying it.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): ive been doing/listening to rave.dj mashups for a while now this just sounds like it was pitched up for one of them

**BeauMeringue212** (8): .This is such a weird song but that's why I kinda love it lol. Also part of it reminds me of A Spaceman Came Travelling by Chris De Burgh?!

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.5): I don’t know how to feel with the chopped vocals looping around the song, and the chorus to this is kind of… kind of mediocre, to be honest? But overall I can’t deny that this song is kind of a banger all in all. The instrumentation to this simultaneously bouncy but also kind of… a little sinister? Hard to put a finger on it, but this extra dimension to the joyfulness of the track at least gives it some depth.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): The samples in this track make it the most unique on the album. It's almost hard to call it a specific genre, it's electronic, pop, some gitch, really a bunch of things here. It's definitely creative as hell.

## **Insomniacs**

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): Was vibing with this but I can’t pretend the vocals aren’t admittedly nasal and grating compared what I’m used to from Gossamer. The stripped down version is WAY better just for the vocals even though the production on the original is good

**ebooks #5454** (6): this does not make me sleepy whatsoever, in fact its keeping me up

**fadedblue09** (5): Apologies to the song's fans but this is not for me. The rubbing synth noises hurt a lot. Fake Mona Lisa teas

**SmileAndTears** (5): huh

**2dina3dworld** (4): this sounds like someone asked an indie pop rock band to write hyperpop without them ever having heard hyperpop before

**thedoctordances1940** (4): this would actually be such a good song if the vocals weren't absolutely awful

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): I'm sorry. Maybe it's due to familiarity but I've not liked this song since release, and really sitting down and listening to it makes me like it less. I find it annoying with the pitched up vocals and the melody. The tendencies of Passion Pit I hate are front and center on this song.

**throwaway7650** (2): wtf is that vocal effect at the beginning... and this is the most popular song on the album? what is wrong with the GP's taste for them/FTP?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): oh man i really do not like this at all

**Verboten\_Prince** (0): This song has to be a joke… this has to be the result of some dare or lost bet or something that went too far… I cannot fathom in the slightest how a song this ugly came to exist… and even less how it came to be the song that put Passion Pit on the map… what????

**frogaranaman** (10.000): my biggest high school regret was not asking my dad for money for the first time in my life so I could see Passion Pit with my friends

**imsodumb321** (9.917): Right, so Passion Pit changed my life, they are the reason why I am still alive, I am a music producer because of them, they were my first concert, I would die for Michael Angelakos, etc. Manners is a flawless album [don't fight me on this].

**kappyko** (9.333): passion pit made me gay

**teenwitches** (9.208): a sparkling, glittering gem of a record. this was the first "indie" album i listened to as an adolescent and it still reminds me of being a carefree almost-teenager. this album is just pure happiness and light and hope and optimism.

**CrimsonROSET** (9.000): Who needs lyrics? I sure fucking don’t! What is going on? That’s for them to know, and you to figure out as they tell you. The cover art is extremely good at setting the tone for the album: an explosion of color, of concepts. Grab what you can, make what you will of it, and allow yourself to just have! Some! Fun! Enjoy the ride they take you on, you won’t regret it.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.925): Prior to this rate, I had only heard *Carried Away*, *Where I Come From*, and *Take A Walk*. Let's just say that I vehemently regret never checking their discography after listening to those 3 awesome songs

**vayyiqra** (8.833): Passion Pit's first album is a little rough around the edges, but still quite impressive for a debut. To be honest I've always been a much bigger fan of Gossamer and think it's better overall, but this album has its stans as well and I can see why. Sleepyhead is a masterpiece and Passion Pit always has such pretty melodies it's hard not to like them, despite the rougher production and Michael's falsetto singing being an acquired taste. I need to listen to this album more often and dive more into its lyrics, since Michael often writes songs about his personal struggles which makes the music a lot more relatable and emotional. Anyway, this is a very good album. As an aside, if you liked it, stream Gossamer! It's excellent.

**GapeCod** (8.833): This man's vocal cords are more valuable than my life.

**omgitskebab** (8.792): amazing album. passion pit is one of my fave artists of all time. lov u michael

**bridgemoney** (8.750): My favorite album in the rate (even though I love all these albums). I only started listening to Passion Pit this year, but now they're one of may favorite artists ever. This sub needs to rate Gossamer in the future.

**TiltControls** (8.708): Really love this album. Probably my favourite of the 4! Also as much as I love Houdini, it just can't compare to the magic that is Sleepyhead

**TheQueenofVultures** (8.333): Manifesting Indie Pop Rock Rate 2 so we can rate Gossamer

**modulum83** (8.300): This was the only album I wasn't at least passingly familiar with before the rate, but it really surprised me. There's an influence from rave music and psychedelia on this one that's palpable, and it results in songs that are overwhelming but intricate, so ethereal in their atmosphere that they evoke being at a music festival on acid and bathing in a sea of colors. While the songs aren't always as boppy as TDCC and FTP, they have their own little secrets that unfold over time.

**skargardin** (8.250): I hadn't heard of Passion Pit prior to this rate (well, aside from Sleepyhead), so many bangers on this album.

**welcome2thejam** (8.083): If there's one takeaway from this rate for me, it's that Manners absolutely ruled and should go way higher on my favorite albums list. Almost every track ranges from very good to incredible; the only one I ranked low was the Dreams cover, and it isn't even technically their song, so I think it's a pass. Happy to see this album still have such an effect on me after a decade.

**celladonn** (7.958): This album walks a fine line between great and irritating, it's definitely an album I have to be in the right mood for as it is A Lot. Anyway it's very good but Gossamer outsold

**jman457** (7.950): This honestly has a weak middle but my god the beginning and end are so good

**\_\_Avaritia** (7.667): Having never heard much of Passion Pit I went into this record with not much expectations, and was pleasantly surprised by some of the cuts like The Reeling just being excellent electronic-infused indie pop. I see what the band was going for with how whimsical, and how light and airy the production is, but dousing it with a healthy dose of synthpop and dance really gives a nice package deal all around. I do think it trails off slightly by the end but there’s not really a bad song on here, and that’s about as good a compliment as I can pay to an album like this.

**camerinian** (7.625): I really did enjoy experiencing this for the first time and several times later. It's rough around the edges and definitely a bit messy, but I'd rather a rollercoaster with massive highs than a steady 7/10. There is a huge heart to this album, and it's really admirable for that. Take a Walk could've been an 11 though, even if The Reeling came close

**xxipil0ts** (7.408): This is entirely different from the sound that I knew from them. I have never listened to this album so this rate made me (finally) listen to it. This was so good.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.250): This is the kind of album where I alternate between loving and hating the lead singers voice. We're also really stretching the definition of "pop rock" by including Passion Pit lol.

**Hulnia** (7.167): As much as I enjoyed some of the songs, it was somewhat forgettable to be honest. At least Sleepyhead is a masterpiece. 😩

**fadedblue09** (7.083): Like Torches, this album is not for me but I did like a handful of songs and I can at least tell they're trying to do something. The vocals are sometimes too screechy and some arrangements are just uninteresting, but enjoyable to some extent.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6.917): The most electronic out of the four records here, there is a ton of bright, glossy production here with some really somber lyrics at times. There's a lot of contrast here, but it makes for a very interesting listen, with some clear highlights.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.792): There are some really good songs here but half the songs are massively brought down by some headache inducing vocals

**plastichaxan** (6.775): i want to apologize to hypno, creme, niki and all the other besties who enjoy this album cause i could not, it has some great tracks but overall it was my least favorite by quite far and i hope you can find it in your hearts to forgive me since we are besties

**Brendon-Urine** (6.708): I appreciate that his vocals are interesting, lotta music branded as "indie pop rock" seems to have basic ass vocals. They border on annoying at points but are usually good. Very fun album!

**1998tweety** (6.667): after hearing all these albums...i will 100% take an incohesive album that at least has different sounding songs anyway over these albums that all sound so similar. inject Ava Max - Heaven & Hell into my veins

**SmileAndTears** (6.083): sorry I don't like the singer's voice at all :/

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.708): this is the only album i wasnt familiar with before this rate and i have very mixed opinions on it. most of the instrumentals slap hard but i cannot stand the singer’s voice, its so grating to me. maybe if a better vocalist was on these songs it would get a higher average from me.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4.417): You ever had an experience where you listen to an album for the first time and you love everything about it so much you can’t remember what life was like before you heard it? Yeah... that’s the exact opposite experience I had with this album. I honestly think that in theory, I’d like a lot of the electropop-synth-rock mixes on this record! But his voice… his goddamn voice… It was so wild witnessing that high-pitched squeal single-handedly bring out and worsen all of the flaws of each individual track. But in the end, I’d like to thank popheads for this unique experience, and I’m being serious. This sub has introduced me to many amazing artists that I would have never found otherwise, and that I grew to love. Never before has it introduced me to an artist that I cannot stand whatsoever. Thanks very much <3

**RandomHypnotica** (10):  And so, the one and only, the iconic AOC misses the Top 5. Many thought this was going to be a winner contender, but it never actually reached that spot... I guess the conservatives were right after all!

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): I hate this song so much I will actually be moving to Queens next election cycle to run against her

---

## **The AOCyola**

**bbfan132** (11): *insert clip of aoc dancing to this*

**jman457** (8.7): That AOC video is iconic, but honestly they have better songs

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sis I have no idea what the fuck this song is even about (I know what “Lisztomania” is, I just don’t know what that has to do with any of the lyrics) but I guess it’s still an AOC-approved bop?

**brendjac** (11): one of my ten favorite songs of all time, i cried when i saw her perform it live

**plastichaxan** (11): this is so much fun in every way possible, this song was the one that convinced me to support the rate in the first place and also just such a strong start to everything

**welcome2thejam** (11): First fifteen seconds are utter perfection. This song just makes me want to grab someone I love so we can do dumb dances to amuse each other

**akanewasright** (10): Okay this bangs and it’s allowed to win I think

**Awkward\_King** (10): list to mania

**celladonn** (10): probably the best song ever written with the word jugulate in the lyrics

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly if there’s something i learned doing rates is that you CAN bop to problematic concepts

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This song is just an all-round bop. No more, no less. It’s just a bop. I do remember this being on the advertisement for Gossip Girl? Which is really super random..

**emayzee** (10): early 2010s indie pop at its very best

**fadedblue09** (10): A very good morning kinda vibe

**frogaranaman** (10): this song instantly transports me back to being a freshman in high school trying to be cool with my indie music taste and listening to this song. granted, I was fucking right and it did make me cool, but that’s besides the point

**GapeCod** (10): 21th century PopCrave comment section.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): "think less but see it grow", she knew what she was doing. This song really grows on you

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): Mozart in Jungle’s classical cover made me love this already

**modulum83** (10): i had a friend that put this on his sex playlist

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Liszt was the original main pop boy

**seanderlust** (10): mania over the girl who recorded Juice so true

**skargardin** (10): Absolute classic!! I loved redisovering this earlier this year, god what a song

**Stryxen** (10): just a bit of a bop isn’t it

**teenwitches** (10): what can i say? a forever bop

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Just an incredible song, such a massive bop

**throwaway7650** (10): quirky opening track [non-derogatory]! really catchy chorus, the bridge is the best part of the song though. love the sudden intensity

**TiltControls** (10): Starting out the rate strong!

**xavieryes** (10): It's been so long since I've heard this song, and holy shit it aged just perfectly. It's just so fucking GOOD.

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): i wish liszt would come out of his grave and play this song alongside AOC

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): A fun jaunty bop! It still has some garage rock bite, which is very refreshing.

**kappyko** (9.5): Nowadays we call Lisztomania being a "Stan" haha am i right fellow pop heads Teehee

**Roxieloxie** (9.4): go off you american!!

**ctatkeson** (9.3): Long time favorite of mine

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I have no freakin' idea what "Lisztomania" means but this is a bop.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): This is the best opener that actually foreshadows how the entire album is going to sound. Just bright with some great drums, and a wonderfully big chorus. I always sing along when I hear this, despite having no clue what exactly the song is about. Oh, and that bridge though.

**vayyiqra** (9): This song was a generation-defining song for some but I had never heard it until a year or two ago. In fact I had heard of the term Lisztomania way before hearing this song, and it's not exactly an everyday word. I think it was a bigger hit in Europe? Either way it's pretty good.

**waluigiest** (9): I’ve always loved the chorus how she sings it once acapella, then bring the beat in and do it again

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): i spent years hearing this on the radio with my mom & so i just assumed she liked it and played it when she was around till like… 4 years ago when she told me she had actually hated it the entire time… it grew on me by then though so :shrug:

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): There’s something about AOC in the way the vocals come off - it weirdly fits but at the same time, the way that it hits my eardrums makes me really not exactly like the timbre and the way it kind of meanders at times. This will be a pain point for the rest of the record, but for this song I think the tune is strong enough in its catchiness and breeziness (an atmosphere that this record will go for and will succeed on, in one of these rare instances) that it doesn’t exactly matter. Pretty cool bridge on this song as well.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): So upbeat and fun, great album opener

**LilacDaffodils** (8): This song always makes me feel like i'm in an indie movie in the best way.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): my favourite thing about Liszt is how how horny he made women was thought to be an infectious disease. We love plague rat Liszt!

**camerinian** (7): I think the incomprehensibility of these lyrics really does impede on my enjoyment of what is otherwise a massive thrash-around indie tune

**GARjuna** (7): this sounds like it would be a tiktok hit now

**musical\_pyn** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of the overall sound of the song, but there are some parts I really like

**runaway3212** (7): This isn't really a ballad but giving this a low score feels like balladphobia anyway

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): cute but not as good as the hype around it would make me believe

**IdiotBox01** (5): her voice is so vanilla bland generic etc.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This become a radio hit was such a curse upon society.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): Oh Brie, how close you were to being a (bonus) rate winner… Metric is an absolutely fantastic band, and I would’ve loved to have one of their other songs in this bonus, but how could we resist the opportunity to have Brie Larson in a rate? Metric’s version of Black Sheep is still great, but honestly those “oh yeah”’s at the start of the song add an incredible amount of charm and charisma to the track, and Brie just has this attitude here that works perfectly with the song. I’m glad to see popheads gave it the love it deserved.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): It’s the fucking SMASHA!! I’m gonna be honest, I think Emily Haines does this song slightly better (and that version is a 10), but the opening “OH YEAHHHH’s” are just too iconic to not have included it in the bonus. Brie absolutely kills this performance, so I’m glad it got the respect it deserves. I know some people would’ve preferred a real Metric song here instead but I believe a Fantasies rate has to happen eventually on the sub, right? Right???

---

## **Can someone put Fantasies or Synthetica by Metric in a rate for my sake**

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (10): I don't care what all you Scott Pilgrim fans say, this is vastly inferior to the Emil Haines version but it's still a ten

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Great song but I do wish we could have gotten an actual metric song for the bonus rate (Gimme Sympathy, Youth Without Youth, Breathing Underwater, etc.)

**vayyiqra** (10): I have complicated feelings about this song. Metric are from the same city as me, I grew up listening to them - they were the first real concert I ever went to, way back in the winter of early 2006. I've wanted to properly rate Metric for years and doubt we ever will, so I kind of feel like I'm giving this a 10 because of that. I used to get kind of irked that this is their best-known song when they have so many other great songs, and I like Brie but prefer Emily's version. However, I'm also a big fan of Scott Pilgrim (how could I not be, as a millennial hipster from Canada) so I'm glad at least the movie was a success and made this song popular. Still, if you like this, please listen to *Fantasies*! It's an amazing album.

**TiltControls** (8.5): metric rate soon please!!! also brie sounds great here

**intl\_orange** (7.5): I like the original version too

**\_\_Avaritia** (7): Let me tell you something and I will get fucking destroyed in the reveal for this but fuck it - the Metric version is a 10 (stream Fantasies for clear skin) and Brie’s vocals are enough to dock 3 points from it. It’s fine and the instrumental absolutely slaps, my real issue is that Brie just kind of just doesn’t sing it well, it’s almost sleazy and while I get that it’s kind of supposed to be infused with grudge/revenge it almost feels lazy in sending that message across. METRIC SUPREMACY!!

## **Hello again, friend of a friend**

**2dina3dworld** (10): this makes me want to smash a guitar over someone’s head

**akanewasright** (10): *oh yeah?* *Oh yeah???* ***OH YEAH!!!!!***

**Awkward\_King** (10): this deserves the world

**bbfan132** (10): another classic!!!

**camerinian** (10): just when I thought this rate couldn't pander to my nostalgia enough, you had to go and include the soundtrack of my favourite movie as a teen that's still like top 5 now. Just thank your lucky stars I'm not dumping every Scott Pilgrim quote I know from memory in this section

**frogaranaman** (10): this song is lowkey gay rights

**GARjuna** (10): wish I could give this my 11. Used to listen to this SO much when I was depressed in college washing dishes

**gwenflip** (10): I remember being so irrationally angry when I learned that her version wasn’t on streaming anywhere and then even more angry when people tried to tell me the awful “Evil Exes” cover on Spotify was her

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I am in lesbians with this song, again

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Scott Pilgrim as a movie did SO much damage to the world but fuck its still such a good movie & this song is maybe the best thing in it

**plastichaxan** (10): okay i’m sorry i can’t lie i was too happy when this got released on spotify

**seanderlust** (10): you know what? i'm about to say it. all of scott pilgrim and ramona flowers' exes were too good for them.

**skargardin** (10): I guess this is the part where I admit to never having seen Scott Pilgrim vs. The World

**Stryxen** (10): everybody moved

**teenwitches** (10): real songs from fictional artists rate when

**Uberpigeon** (10): this punches the highlights out my hair

**welcome2thejam** (10): I went through a big Scott Pilgrim phase in college (I know your red flag alert is going off HARD but please stay with me), and the soundtrack played such a big role in that. This goes double for The Clash At Demonhead scene – arguably the best in the movie – where at the center is Black Sheep, easily my favorite song in this rate. And while I rarely side against Emily Haines, I think Brie's version adds a lot of weight and attitude that really puts it over the top.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the visuals on the video are a 11

**ebooks #5454** (9): sweet brie needs a big smooch for this cover god bless dayum

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is actually amazing. Why haven’t I seen this movie yet??

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.9): This slaps!

**modulum83** (8.9): i think if i were straight i would definitely have been one of those obnoxious scott pilgrim vs the world people

**throwaway7650** (8.5): solid, not a 10 but good!

**jman457** (8.3): Brie Larson future EGOT winner

**ctatkeson** (8): A new one for me.  I like it!

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Oh shit it’s the girl from *Barbie and the Magic Of The Pegasus*

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**waluigiest** (8): I feel like this movie is a sacred text I’ve somehow avoided..

**daythreeinmiami** (7): Yeah there is no denying this is the better version….sorry…..I blame the movie.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7): This is a good song, I've never actually watch Scott Pilgrim so I don't really know how iconic this is I guess, but I am surprised it is included because it feels like more of an alternative rock song.

**omgitskebab** (7): havent heard this before but its good

## **Our common goal was waiting for this song to end**

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Maybe stick to acting, girl.

**GapeCod** (1): I have bad associations with Scott Pilgrim (and coincidentally Brie Larson), because the two people I've known that were obsessed with the film gave me lots of trauma and insecurities in high school and first year of uni :grinny:. This song isn't good enough to counteract that either.

**cremeebrulee** (10): [I mean…](https://c.tenor.com/dMygK5llMOcAAAAC/davonne-rogers-pretends-to-be-shocked.gif) This inclusion was kind of an oversight on our part, because we hadn’t realized this song was rated (twice) previously. But tbh, even if we did find out before, there’s still no way we could not include it. If I’ve mentioned any other song in this bonus rate being iconic, scratch that, because this is THEE iconic indie pop song. I swear, I feel just as blown away by this song now as I did on my first listen all those years ago. Those dramatic opening synths and that transcendent saxophone solo... ugh it’s seriously one of the best songs of all time and I’m glad it finally got its chance to win a rate!

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): and so, the most predictable winner won. But we had to include it, it’s so next level iconic, and arguable THE defining track of the indie pop movement this rate is all about. A much deserved winner.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This song is my literal crack. Inject it into my fucking veins. How can that one repetitive sound get me so HYPED? And for TEN YEARS?

**ebooks #5454** (10): so many great memories with this, big fan of the crow on the cover

**frogaranaman** (10): it's just one of those songs that if you say you don't like it I'm going to assume you're a bald faced liar

**GapeCod** (10): Can this please replace Midnight Sky in Winners 3?

**GARjuna** (10): THIS FUCKING SONG

**gwenflip** (10): I’m so happy I was in high school for this song pt. 2

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): This song is just absolutely perfect. The unforgettable synth lead, the low key verses, the huge soaring chorus, and how the instrumental builds on the next time you hear the chorus, the whole vibe of the song. It's no wonder it blew up like it did, it's irresistible.

**Hulnia** (10): Why the fuck are these guys unlikely to be rated?

**jman457** (10): This is auditory crack

**modulum83** (10): bitches love the 80s i'm bitches

**skargardin** (10): also one of my favourite songs of all time honestly, I need to listen to this WAY more often!

**teenwitches** (10): i want to give this an 11 so bad, popheads please let me rate hurry up we're dreaming i am begging

**throwaway7650** (10): another classic, saxophone solo etc. hope this wins!

**TiltControls** (10): gonna predict that this'll be the winner, but there's a ton of strong competition so you never know!

**Uberpigeon** (10): this is one of the best songs ever fucking made like motzart whatever his name is can suck my ass THIS is fucking music!!!!!

**vayyiqra** (10): Like many of us I think, I found this song because it showed up in my YouTube recommendations. I played it so much I remember I was with my girlfriend once and it came on autoplay and she skipped it and we talked about how it's such a great song but we were just sick of it. That was almost five years ago, I think (what the hell happened seriously what is life) and I still agree, I don't listen to it much anymore but it is a truly amazing song. I might give it my 11 if it weren't a bonus track. Every element of it is great: the sad vocals, the drums, the sample (I still can't believe it's not a synth), the ending saxophone solo. It's just beautiful.

**xavieryes** (10): a classic masterpiece that would've seriously competed for my 11 if it were in the main rate

**BeauMeringue212** (9.5): A whole bop, and that sax solo 🎷🎷

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): the fifa flashbacks oh god

**IIIHenryIII** (9.2): what a great song to blow your speakers to

**1998tweety** (9): bop

**Stryxen** (9): my biggest memory of this song is playing it at a party at my first night at uni and thinking i was so main character vibes but that memory makes me cringe now but i can’t make the music not bop

**waluigiest** (9): classic but I don’t know a single word

**ctatkeson** (8.7): Another popular one that I enjoy!

**akanewasright** (8.5): yeah this is winning bonus huh

**welcome2thejam** (8): Love trying to vocalize the sound of that synth while listening and coming up with different gibberish every time

## **Morning people**

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): I feel like I respect this song more than I like it. But I suuuper respect it for its committment to just retrowave or whatever.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): THE overplayed song to end all overplayed songs

**2dina3dworld** (4): it’s those annoying synths again!!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): and so, we have my last would be 11 contender in Undercover Martyn. Everything about this song is exactly what I love about Two Door Cinema Club. Tight guitar riffs, catchy rhythms and hooks, and just this absolute driving force that makes me feel invincible. Also the weird lyrical theme of trying to beat anxiety to being a spy is kinda camp. Side note: the [single cover](https://images.genius.com/9c39cc55f5c8aaac235e2fc320b02e90.770x770x1.jpg) for this is absolutely horrifying and awful and i felt the need to share it with you all

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Apparently "Martyn" is a name. I thought they were just spelling "martian" in a fancy way. Those crazy Irish!

**bridgemoney** (10): My personal fave from the album and the start of an amazing three song stretch.

**camerinian** (10): This is so uplifting and the energy is infectious. Maximalist in all the best ways

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the budget was NOT in this video

**ebooks #5454** (10): i think all music should threaten us

**emayzee** (10): idk a better riff and i don't think i ever want to

**frogaranaman** (10): thinking about the titty slapping meme on Tiktok when I hear this intro

**GapeCod** (10): I'm quite comfortable in my basement, thank you very much.

**modulum83** (10): better than crack

**omgitskebab** (10): best song on the album

**runaway3212** (10): I don't know why this song sounds so menacing but it does

**Stryxen** (10): the clap clap 👏👏 is the sound of my flat indie pop rock ass cheeks clapping to this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): 👏👏

**teenwitches** (10): the clap-clap is the best part of this song

**celladonn** (9.5): I remember this being an itunes single of the week, fun track!

**throwaway7650** (9.5): that beeping noise in the bridge is so fun. bleep bloop (do dark alt pop and stan I disagree! the track and the album!)

**bbfan132** (9): this totally bops

**BeauMeringue212** (9): this has a very teenage feel to it, such a catchy chorus too

**waluigiest** (9): They bring an incredible energy to this song

**welcome2thejam** (9): "To the basement, people... many surprises await you" Hell no, not falling for this Cask of Amontillado shit again

**ctatkeson** (8.8): this one I can understand :).  Feels like everything is working well together here.  Definitely feeling it.

**jman457** (8.2): Really good lyrics and production on here

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Oh I remember this song. I remember thinking it sounded like ‘What You Know’. Still a good catchy bop.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Did… did he kill a girl and hide her body in the basement?

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): the pre-chorus is pretty cool

**darjeelingdarkroast** (7): Have I finally found a non-Phoenix song that's deservingly catchy? I've been starving!!! The chorus is a highlight here, it's very driving and undeniably catchy.

**Uberpigeon** (7): 'to the basement people to the basement' me when i play dead by daylight

## **To the bottom, people, to the bottom**

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.5): Overall an unremarkable song that doesn’t really offer much other than the leading melody’s timbre and really good bridge. Agtain, can’t help but feel like again, this just feels like a worse version of everything that we’ve heard before. I also wrote ‘wonder why every start of the verse is so quiet’ and honestly, what is the point lol. Also I finished this record and I still don’t remember this song AT ALL. Weird.

**musical\_pyn** (6): instrumental break not enough to save this one unfortunately

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (5): This is okay, but it feels like most of the other tracks here. Good driving beat, nice guitar work, forgettable vocals. A good bunch of these songs feel interchangeable, and it hurts the record which just how one track minded it is.

**cremeebrulee** (11): There’s quite a few reasons why I was so excited to co-host this rate, but this song probably tops that list. I could’ve 11’d a number of songs on this album alone, but at the end of the day it just had to be the opening track. I got into Torches right when I started high school— luckily enough, my dinky MP3 player had enough storage to fit it in its entirety and my commute was long enough to listen to it front-to-back each way. I feel like the reason I cherish this song (and by extension the whole album) so much because it soundtracked what was a really uneasy and lonely time in my life. Just the opening bars of this song take me back to putting this on the train ride back home from freshman year, wondering when life starts to get better than what it was. Yeah, I know that I’m being corny, but get this: 14 year olds are overdramatic as fuck! And sometimes we just need to project our optimism for the future on a track about practicing resilience through the bad times!! I’m pretty sure this track was penned about Mark Foster’s prior drug addiction, but even without that context this song has a way of forcing you to reflect on your own shortcomings. The chorus (“I’m alright / I took a sip of something poison, but I’ll hold on tight”) is really one of my favorite songwriting moments on the album just because it used to bring me so much comfort on my worst days. 

But beyond the inspirational lyrics, holy FUCK does this song just bang all the way through. The opening drums, that journey of an instrumental bridge, all the build-up to an outro of just the most triumphant and well-earned “WoooOOOᵒᵒᵒOOOooo’s” I’ve ever heard. It’s truly one of my favorite songs of all time so I can’t express how excited I was to see this be our winner (for like 2 ballots before it switched up again, haha). Now, 5th overall is by no means a bad placement for this; it was against some tough competition, so I’m still super happy that this song did as well as it did.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): One of the most eclectic songs on Torches, but also one of the best. It's no surprise this made Top 5, it's addictive, fun, attention-grabbing and has some of the best lyricism on the album. I really miss the time when me and creme’s 11’s were the Top 2 songs in the rate, maybe all the hosts who say the results never get better after 20 ballots are right...

---

## **Yeah yeah and it's okay :)**

**\_\_Avaritia** (11): I am not exaggerating when I say that this song’s opening drumbeat is CONSTANTLY living in my head rent-free, and has been ever since the first time I heard it. I’m not lying. This song is just so infectiously catchy and so many aspects of even the rest of its flourishes - from the sort of artificial bounciness of the synths (a good thing) that culminates in those last glorious three notes of the looping leading melody to the slight switch-up that happens at the bridge and the way the percussion kind of thumps a long - are just magnificent. There’s just something so fucking urgent about this song that just sells it for me too, in the way that Mark tries to relate his battles against his own self-destructive habits through the lyrics - but above all, it’s a whole ass banger through and through, truly what I consider to be near the pinnacle of indie pop rock. It’s Helena Beat!!

**Lilacly\_Adily** (11): A pure bop

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): I went from not really liking this album to giving it my 11

**xavieryes** (11): Helena Beat is one of my favorite songs of all time. The dark lyrics, the heartbeat sample, the lyrical dissonance, everything about the production, it's all just perfect. The best track in one of my favorite albums of all time.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Actually impossible to sit still while listening to this bop.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): hidden legend in this song: those hand claps

**ebooks #5454** (10): hearing the OuOUOouoOOuooOuoouOu shit live hits different

**frogaranaman** (10): who beat Helena? I just wanna talk

**GapeCod** (10): Mr. Simple for the straights. No, I'm not tired of this comparison yet.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): one of the best album intros ~~ever made~~ I've ever heard

**modulum83** (10): soundtrack to when i go demon mode

**seanderlust** (10): they do have a knack for darker lyrics set to a danceable beat. i love the idea of taking these self-destructive tendencies and not glorifying them or condemning them, just naming them and dancing anyways.

**teenwitches** (10): a sad song about drug addiction disguised as an indie dance pop banger

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): An incredible album opener

**TiltControls** (10): bop

**vayyiqra** (10): FTP seem to have a trend of songs with deceptively upbeat instrumentals and dark lyrics. I read the arguments on Genius about what this song is about, and some think it's about heroin addiction. I thought perhaps it's alcoholism. It's also relatable if you've ever had depression before (which you had better believe I sure have).

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): This is… very good. Foster the People seems to be great at writing catchy hooks

**welcome2thejam** (10): The lyrics say depression and self-destructive tendencies, but the sound says party at my house and you're all invited!

**gwenflip** (9.5): I got this song as a free download back when iTunes had the weekly singles and that’s when I became an obnoxious hipster

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): in an odd way this song reminds me of cool kids by echosmith but a lot better

**ctatkeson** (9.4): Kind of funky, catchy hook.  Really big fan of this.  Adding it to my songs! Edit:  I've had this one going on repeat now for a couple days.  Great song.  My favorite song that I've discovered from this event!

**bbfan132** (9): for some reason, i forgot that this existed… it bops though

**BeauMeringue212** (9): Probably the danciest song on this rate for me. Love the distortion

**GARjuna** (9): love this song

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): More of an indie rock vibe with this one with a great singalong chorus (which is running theme on the album) and plenty of danceability to it.. I always like the crunchy more muddled guitar mixing with the bright synths, the contrast is great.

**waluigiest** (9): this song just amps me up!

**jman457** (8.6): Immidiatly takes me back to middle school/early high school

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop

**akanewasright** (8.4): mischief

**2dina3dworld** (8): is this EDM

**daythreeinmiami** (8): Foster the People is a band that I heard once and instantly fell in love. I will defend this band and this album proudly cause I know y’all are going to do this album dirty in this rate.

**Ghost-Quartet** (7.5): This is a good opener but I don’t know if I’d listen to it on its own

**throwaway7650** (7.5): wait the intro (to this song) is kind of a slay and that one synth reminds me of some pokemon OST but I can't remember which one. the instrumental "bridge" (I think) is pretty cool too! the vocals suck however

## **Should've beat some of your asses honestly**

**Hulnia** (7): This would be perfect with a better singer honestly.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): the chorus here is so good but something about the music and Mark’s voice in the verses doesn’t gel for me

**xxipil0ts** (6.7): Not keen on this as an opening track for an album. As a standalone song, it's a little bit of a bop

**omgitskebab** (6): a good lead into the album

**musical\_pyn** (5): chorus is really great, but the rest of the song is just...okay

**runaway3212** (5): overhyped mess

**Awkward\_King** (3): he sounds like he'd be annoying to work in a group project with

**darjeelingdarkroast** (2): I liked how it started initially, but the vocals are so weak to me and irritating. And the harmonies are even more annoying to me. The instrumentals are nice but vocals are huge turn-off. The final woo's at the end are especially bad for me.

**Stryxen** (0): Helena beats nothing helena will lose this rate idk i just really dislike the vocals on a lot of this album and this is the worst offender when this song has nothing else i particularly like about it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): And so, despite the endorsement of the one and only AOC, Lisztomania ends up in 4th. Despite being close to the top almost the entire time, and being in 1st place for a single ballot, there were always just enough low scores to keep it out of reach. Lisztomania is undeniably danceable and anthemic, it's just an absolute driving force of fun. It's festival-core at its purest, and it absolutely deserves it's spot in the Top 5.

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): Prior to this rate, I’ve always found this a little overrated (mostly because I thought 1901 was the wayyy better single). But it’s grown on me immensely since— my favorite moment is definitely the 1-2-3 punch of the bridge, the instrumental, and the last chorus. It definitely builds up to a really energetic ending, but I wish it had that energy from the start. Everyone thought this was an obvious winner contender, so the fact that it was first for only one (1) ballot is pretty damn funny. (*Misheard Lyric:* Duel it, duel it, duel it // *Actual Lyric:* Do let, do let, do let)

---

## **The AOCyola**

**bbfan132** (11): *insert clip of aoc dancing to this*

**jman457** (8.7): That AOC video is iconic, but honestly they have better songs

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sis I have no idea what the fuck this song is even about (I know what “Lisztomania” is, I just don’t know what that has to do with any of the lyrics) but I guess it’s still an AOC-approved bop?

## **Stan account owners**

**brendjac** (11): one of my ten favorite songs of all time, i cried when i saw them perform it live

**plastichaxan** (11): this is so much fun in every way possible, this song was the one that convinced me to support the rate in the first place and also just such a strong start to everything

**welcome2thejam** (11): First fifteen seconds are utter perfection. This song just makes me want to grab someone I love so we can do dumb dances to amuse each other

**akanewasright** (10): Okay this bangs and it’s allowed to win I think

**Awkward\_King** (10): list to mania

**celladonn** (10): probably the best song ever written with the word jugulate in the lyrics

**CrimsonROSET** (10): honestly if there’s something i learned doing rates is that you CAN bop to problematic concepts

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This song is just an all-round bop. No more, no less. It’s just a bop. I do remember this being on the advertisement for Gossip Girl? Which is really super random..

**emayzee** (10): early 2010s indie pop at its very best

**fadedblue09** (10): A very good morning kinda vibe

**frogaranaman** (10): this song instantly transports me back to being a freshman in high school trying to be cool with my indie music taste and listening to this song. granted, I was fucking right and it did make me cool, but that’s besides the point

**GapeCod** (10): 19th century PopCrave comment section.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): "think less but see it grow", they knew what they were doing. This song really grows on you

**Lilacly\_Adily** (10): Mozart in Jungle’s classical cover made me love this already

**modulum83** (10): i had a friend that put this on his sex playlist

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Liszt was the original main pop boy

**seanderlust** (10): mania over the girl who recorded Juice so true

**skargardin** (10): Absolute classic!! I loved redisovering this earlier this year, god what a song

**Stryxen** (10): just a bit of a bop isn’t it

**teenwitches** (10): what can i say? a forever bop

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Just an incredible song, such a massive bop

**throwaway7650** (10): quirky opening track [non-derogatory]! really catchy chorus, the bridge is the best part of the song though. love the sudden intensity

**TiltControls** (10): Starting out the rate strong!

**xavieryes** (10): It's been so long since I've heard this song, and holy shit it aged just perfectly. It's just so fucking GOOD.

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): i wish liszt would come out of his grave and play this song alongside phoenix

**darjeelingdarkroast** (9.5): A fun jaunty bop! It still has some garage rock bite, which is very refreshing.

**kappyko** (9.5): Nowadays we call Lisztomania being a "Stan" haha am i right fellow pop heads Teehee

**Roxieloxie** (9.4): go off you french!!

**ctatkeson** (9.3): Long time favorite of mine

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I have no freakin' idea what "Lisztomania" means but this is a bop.

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (9): This is the best opener that actually foreshadows how the entire album is going to sound. Just bright with some great drums, and a wonderfully big chorus. I always sing along when I hear this, despite having no clue what exactly the song is about. Oh, and that bridge though.

**vayyiqra** (9): This song was a generation-defining song for some but I had never heard it until a year or two ago. In fact I had heard of the term Lisztomania way before hearing this song, and it's not exactly an everyday word. I think it was a bigger hit in Europe? Either way it's pretty good.

**waluigiest** (9): I’ve always loved the chorus how they sing it once acapella, then bring the beat in and do it again

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): i spent years hearing this on the radio with my mom & so i just assumed she liked it and played it when she was around till like… 4 years ago when she told me she had actually hated it the entire time… it grew on me by then though so :shrug:

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.5): There’s something about Phoenix in the way the vocals come off - it weirdly fits but at the same time, the way that it hits my eardrums makes me really not exactly like the timbre and the way it kind of meanders at times. This will be a pain point for the rest of the record, but for this song I think the tune is strong enough in its catchiness and breeziness (an atmosphere that this record will go for and will succeed on, in one of these rare instances) that it doesn’t exactly matter. Pretty cool bridge on this song as well.

**BeauMeringue212** (8.5): So upbeat and fun, great album opener

**LilacDaffodils** (8): This song always makes me feel like i'm in an indie movie in the best way.

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): my favourite thing about Liszt is how how horny he made women was thought to be an infectious disease. We love plague rat Liszt!

**camerinian** (7): I think the incomprehensibility of these lyrics really does impede on my enjoyment of what is otherwise a massive thrash-around indie tune

**GARjuna** (7): this sounds like it would be a tiktok hit now

## **Disgust, disgust, disg-**

**musical\_pyn** (7): I'm not the biggest fan of the overall sound of the song, but there are some parts I really like

**runaway3212** (7): This isn't really a ballad but giving this a low score feels like balladphobia anyway

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): cute but not as good as the hype around it would make me believe

**IdiotBox01** (5): his voice is so vanilla bland generic etc.

**Ghost-Quartet** (4): This become a radio hit was such a curse upon society.

**cremeebrulee** (10): It’s the fucking SMASHA!! I know most people prefer Lisztomania to this, but I’ve always loved 1901 so, so much more. Those opening synths + guitars alone will put me in a good mood. Between the exuberant instrumental, the nonsensical lyrics, that godly outro, this is just THEE blueprint for the indie pop rock sound of that time. It’s just so fun and summery and I probably would have 11ed this if FTP weren’t here. While this song never had a real shot at winning (Lisztomania definitely cannabalized some of the 11s it would’ve gotten), it was also never TOO far behind, which probably explains its well-deserved third finish. (*Misheard Lyric:* Falling, falling, falling // *Actual Lyric:* Fold it, fold it, fold it)

**RandomHypnotica** (10): In a twist almost nobody saw coming, Phoenix entirely misses out on the Top 2! Less surprising however, is just how close 1901 and Lisztomania were, with only 0.2 points separating them. Interestingly enough, for a vast majority of the rate, Lisztomania was handily beating 1901, up until the very last ballot in fact. Both songs feel like the epitome of the summer of 2009, and have this immediately gratifying warmth to them, and it's easy to see why they blew up the way they did. I have loved this song since I first heard it, continue to love it, and will always love it for introducing me to Phoenix.

---

## **1+9+0+1**

**camerinian** (11): I have adored this song since my first time hearing it on Pandora, and yet it is literally only for this rate that I decided to actually go on Genius and look up what the lyrics meant. To my amazement, it seem to basically encapsulate the feeling of levity and removal from overthought, which is the entire fucking reason I loved this song to begin with. The harsh distorted synths really throw you in the deep end of sensory overload, and moving into the bright guitar licks and that absolutely perfect, tight percussion and the yelpy vocal delivery. That vocal melody is just the right balance of ramshackle and structured, and the structure of it hits jubilantly at every single masterfully-squeezed pressure point around the chorus. It’s a cornerstone of 2010s indie for a very good reason, and it’s an absolute fucking blast live if you ever get the chance.

**celladonn** (11): BOP!!!

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): THIS SONG RULES. I don't know what else to say! It's actually catchy, well-produced and full of verve and energy. I stan!!!

**ebooks #5454** (11): this song brings me nothing but pure happiness mental illness i dont know her first time i heard this song it was the depressed birdy version which was also beautiful would die for this song always bring me a bucket of joy fold it fold it fold it fOLD IT

**Hulnia** (11): A Top 25 song of all time for me, it sums up everything good with the genre at the time, as does this album as a whole.

**bbfan132** (10): i remember hearing this on some playlist years ago and i’ve liked it a lot since then, just a really fun song to listen to

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY HEY

**Brendon-Urine** (10): ok but the PRODUCTION here? w o w

**bridgemoney** (10): The absolute gold standard for car commercial music.

**daythreeinmiami** (10): PAST AND PRESENT 1855 19OH1

**frogaranaman** (10): I don't know why but I always confuse this song's music video with the music video for Vampire Weekend - Cousins. I just think both music videos work really well for each other and can be mildly interchangeable for some reason

**GapeCod** (10): "Think it's not what you say, what you say is way too complicated" is the self-awareness the judges want to see!

**gwenflip** (10): the auditory embodiment of walking into a shiny three story Forever 21

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (10): I mean come on, what other answer is there? FOLD IT FOLD IT FOLD IT

**jman457** (10): Indie Pop Rock at its finest

**runaway3212** (10): the year 1901 is overrated but this song slaps

**skargardin** (10): FOLD IT FOLD IT FOLD IT

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): god this is such a good fucking song

**teenwitches** (10): heyeyeyeyeyey

**thedoctordances1940** (10): This feels like being on the FIFA soundtrack

**vayyiqra** (10): If I had to show a time traveller from the far future what late 2000s indie pop/rock sounded like, I might pick this.

**xavieryes** (10): another nostalgic classic banger

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.5): It makes sense that this and Lisztomania really kick Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix to a real roaring start - it has all the marks of a great indie rock song, with its fuzzy yet banging guitars in the verses, the way the chorus kicks the song into a refreshing gear, just the general tune of this one is super. Good reason that this song (and Lisztomania, to a lesser extent) are their most popular tracks - deservedly so, and the vocals don’t really detract too much from the experience either. It’s nineteen OH ONE!

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): it sounds like a The Killers song

**kappyko** (9.5): i had this song youtube to mp3 downloaded on my iphone 4S

**TiltControls** (9.5): the way I discovered 3/4 of these bands through video games. Anyways this was in tap tap revenge (if anyone remembers that) for a bit. It was fun!

**ctatkeson** (9.1): Another one I have enjoyed for a while

**2dina3dworld** (9): not my favourite year of the 20th century tbh

**CrimsonROSET** (9): nineteen OH one

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9): I’ve heard the song in way too many ads but it’s still a fantastic song

**seanderlust** (9): shoutout to when i got this song as a free download for some reason and I didn't listen to it for a long time because my like 19-year-old self was like "uhhh that's a number not a title? smh"

**waluigiest** (9): HEYEYEYEYEY

**welcome2thejam** (9): A perfect song for a nighttime drive, especially in your all-new 2010 Cadillac SRX

**modulum83** (8.9): i don't know what any of the lyrics here mean but that's french people for you ig

**BeauMeringue212** (8.8): Classic indie pop, this slaps

**akanewasright** (8.5): Yass we love the year Queen Victoria died

**plastichaxan** (8): i can only think about someone at the beatsense party saying “what you said is way too complicated” sums up indie lyrics

**throwaway7650** (8): don't like the vocal delivery of the word "away" at the start of the verses. also I can't unhear him repeating baldin', baldin', baldin' in the chorus


## **1~~901~~**

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is the kind of song where if it comes up on the radio I don’t hate it but if it comes up on a playlist I’ll skip it.

**Stryxen** (7): 1901 more like 7

**musical\_pyn** (6): I feel like I should like this much more than I actually do

**Uberpigeon** (6): stop going hey

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): uhh I like the build-up part?

**IdiotBox01** (4): i hope this doesn't win

**frogaranaman** (10.000): this album yanked me straight back into my indie days oh god oh fuck

**teenwitches** (9.100): this was the first album i bought with my own money. i grabbed a physical copy from a target while i was on a road trip with my parents and made them listen to it in the car the entire 6 hour way home. today, a full 12 years later, this album still feels as fresh as the day i ripped the plastic off the cd case. the production is punchy and upbeat without ever becoming saccharine or dated. this album is one of my desert island records and i honestly don't think i'll ever get tired of it.

**thedoctordances1940** (9.100): Don't get me wrong I love this album but somehow this is the highest average I've given to an album since I started doing rates on PH and that just doesn't feel right, but when it's legitimately just bop after bop I can't justify going any lower.

**GapeCod** (9.100): Cardi and Meg boosted this rate's popularity more than anyone else.

**Hulnia** (8.800): Okay, so while this album may not be perfect, it’s everything I’m looking for in an album like this. It’s SO fun, and definitely sums up the era perfectly for me.

**TiltControls** (8.800): yeah you fuckin with this Wolfgang Amadeus Pheonix. Anyways I think WAP's the most consistent album of the 4 in the rate, though in 11 potential songs I'd put my choice (Listzomania) below the other 3's. Still that's comparing giants to each other. Fantastic album overall!

**vayyiqra** (8.600): One thing all of the albums in this rate seem to share is that the literal meaning of their lyrics isn't that important. Instead it's about vibes and feelings. All of them invoke a lot of nostalgia for the time they were made (I wasn't into these bands back then, but a lot of the indie scene sounded like them) and they're all pleasant and soothing listens. For that reason I didn't write many long comments but this album does have a few killer tracks I wish I'd known about back in the day. Anyway, insert AOC dancing meme video here.

**CrimsonROSET** (8.600): I broke down album by album on the discord in what they excelled at, and this one is the melodies. The instrumentals on this album are superb, they just toss everything at the walls and it just works! It’s really good, and honestly, if you just look at my average you’d not be able to tell it’s my least favorite of the four, but that’s not to put it to shame. It’s a really good album.

**jman457** (8.540): Peak Indie Pop Rock but is it the Best from this era??

**IIIHenryIII** (8.520): "I kinda dig their sound. It's really, really good. However, I can't stand the voice of the lead singer. He ruined almost all the songs for me", that was my original comment on the album. The lead singer's voice is still not my favorite, but I'm getting used to it.

**camerinian** (8.400): this is such a consistently strong listen all the way through, and just varied enough without losing sight of its vision or aesthetic. I think if the language barrier awkwardness weren't a factor for some lyrics, this would have been a favourite for younger me

**bridgemoney** (8.400): I like the latter half a lot, but the first two songs overshadow the whole album for me.

**skargardin** (8.300): I will definitely revisit this album after the rate, I'm glad that I finally had an excuse to dive into it!

**modulum83** (8.140): WAP can be pretty sweet and juicy, but when it's in your face all the time and showing off, you start to really tire out, and unlike its other counterparts, there's just not enough to swallow upon completion to really be satisfying.

**kappyko** (8.100): i've always found WAP the odd one out in this rate bc they're a bit of a diff generation from the other acts and have vastly more indie cred - have yall seen how high they ranked on pazz and jop tihs year? look up GAPDY! that said, this album has jams but i like the crossover-oriented sound of the others a lot more.  also: they're the only group in this rate that haven't worked with madeon in some respect

**Lilacly\_Adily** (8.040): A hard act to follow

**plastichaxan** (8.000): this was a pleasant surprise, it’s probably my favorite album of the four and i can see the impact it had (and still has) on indie music

**celladonn** (7.900): Very good album, an indie pop rock classic for a reason

**fadedblue09** (7.900): Very solid, enjoyable synthy pop-rock album, especially for someone who normally doesn't enjoy this genre. The formula kind of wears thin in the second half, but I guess that's a me problem (since I easily lose patience with synths).

**1998tweety** (7.700): i gave almost every song on this album the same score but thats cause it all sounds the same

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7.700): This record just is the definition of a feel good album. Tons of tracks are just these happy bops, with great instrumentation, and big choruses. It's what got me into Phoenix in the first place, and probably was one of the gateways that got me huge into indie pop as an entire genre.

**SmileAndTears** (7.700): I don't know if I *love* this album but I'm pretty confident saying it's the best out off all the albums in this rate

**imsodumb321** (7.600): I love Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix! It's definitely in my top 10 favorite albums of all time, even if I feel like the middle drags a little bit. Lisztomania and 1901 will forever be classics.

**welcome2thejam** (7.500): Initially was a lot more down on the post-Lasso songs, but I've come around a bit to em. In the end though, the reason for me to come back to this album is all in that incredible four song starting stretch plus Lasso.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.300): These boys have a very specific sound to the point where a few of these songs kind of blend into each other...but they're very good at that sound.

**xxipil0ts** (7.290): There really is not much variety in this album. In fact, it felt like this album felt like one whole song. Still, it was a fun listen! I don't think that the whole one-note takes the fun out of it but, rather, makes the album cohesive with its theme and motif.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.700): a decent indie pop/rock album but it mostly goes in one ear and out another for me. 1901 and lasso blow every other song out of the water so hard its not even funny.

**\_\_Avaritia** (6.400): The more I think about this record the less I really want to talk about it. Wolfgang starts with a pretty promising first half but really falls apart by the second, and for such a slim track listing and little room for error, this record kind of feels like a disappointment at the end of the day. I attribute my inability to connect with this record to just the way the instrumentals are just so airy and lacking of flavour for the most part, as well as lead singer Thomas’ vocal inflexions just being quite unsatisfying to listen to in the same way quite a few indie pop singers are. Once you’ve listened to the first 4 or so tracks I don’t really think there’s much to await you from beyond.

**Brendon-Urine** (6.200): I guess I'm a little dissappointed, coming in only knowing Lisztomania + 1901? I expected non stop fun pop rock songs but the instrumental along with some mediocre songs brought it down for me. 1901 is still an absolute gem

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.100): The singer reuses the same vocal techniques and cliches for every single song on this album so I’d say it’s very hit or miss for them… As for me, I think the band’s alright, but his voice can certainly get grating on certain tracks

**cremeebrulee** (10): It’s crazy how everyone thought Houdini would run away with the victory, but somehow this song never “technically” took first place. For a long time, this song had the most 11s but it just wouldn’t budge from 5th/6th. It was only while taking extensions did this leap to second and was just *always* 3-4 points behind the top spot. It’s a little tragic, since I understand all the love for this song. It’s vibrant and inspiring; I think a really underrated part is the “Focus on your ability” outro because it just hammers in what the whole song, and album is about. Even though we’re saying goodbye to Foster the People here, I’m hoping any first time listeners got something out of one of my favorite projects of the last decade and any oldheads also enjoyed this nostalgia trip with us!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): And so, despite having the biggest fan campaign, a huge number of 11's, and generally being seen as the favourite, Houdini ended up coming 2nd, and was only barely winning after 3 ballots in a tied first place. From the moment those drums start, and you hear the synthline coming in, you know you're in for a ride, and I could shout “SOMETIMES I WANNA DISSAPEAR” from the top of my lungs every day for the rest of my life, because, well, it’s SO TRUE!!  This song is Indie Pop Rock perfected, and is absolutely deserving of all the love and 11’s it got.

**Roxieloxie** (11): First of all, I love niki so much. second of all, if i had a nickel for everytime there was a song about wanting to disappear that, in a very short span of time i amassed over 100 scrobbles for, in a rate hosted by creme that i ended up 11ing, i would have two nickels, which isnt alot but its very strange that it happened twice!

**skargardin** (11): me at any given point of the week when I want to disappear

**camerinian** (10): SOMETIMES I WANNA DISAPPEAR hits so fucking hard oh my god

**frogaranaman** (10): "SOMETIMES I WANNA DISAPPEAR" I scream as I am perceived by no one sitting alone in my room

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I love that the chorus for this is purely instrumental, I get so hype waiting for them to go “disa-PEAR” and then that synth kicks in. Hook of the rate.

**teenwitches** (10): sometimes i wanna disappear too :(

## **Some pretty magical people**

**bigbigbee** (11): When I first bought Torches, I was young and didn’t understand things like “sonic diversity on albums”. So I was a little disappointed at first that none of the songs sounded like Pumped Up Kicks…until I got to this song. It was like a lightbulb went off in my head. I IMMEDIATELY understood the appeal of buying albums to try to find hidden gems: things you wouldn’t ever hear on the radio. (Of course, this song went on to become a single – but it wasn’t when I first heard it.) This song has had staying power for me, too – I’m still not tired of it, even 10 years later. Anyway, thank you Foster the People for changing my concept of how to listen to music!

**CrimsonROSET** (11): BREAKING NEWS: The boring 11 choice is the right one! Raters rejoice!

**GapeCod** (11): I LOVE ROXIE SO MUCH IT'S UNREAL

**IIIHenryIII** (11): masterpiece; Houdini himself could never

**nootnoot781** (11): oh this fucks

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WVZO5WMAEN8

**1998tweety** (10): my poor poor hole

**2dina3dworld** (10): this isn’t Kate Bush

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): Yeah I mean, it’s fucking Houdini dude, what else can I say lol. There’s something special about this song in the way that it progresses too - like that instrumental breakdown post-chorus is just so great, especially contrasted with the piano chords that kind of glide gently across the song, and again we have great percussion and synth breakdowns, like what’s not to like? This might also be one of Mark’s better vocal performances as well, especially at the last third of the track when he starts to sound a bit more urgent and determined. Man I swear there’s something about the drum patterns in this album that has me feeling different.

**akanewasright** (10): u/RoxieLoxie is this payback enough yet?

**BeauMeringue212** (10): Ok this song just explodes, builds up and explodes again. The 2nd chorus is such a moment with those horns

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now THIS should have been the big hit off the album!

**dicahprihoe** (10): the intro alone just itches that part in my brain

**Hulnia** (10): Okay, this is SOME real shit right here, the vocals actually work here, and even if it might not be, it feels like such a breath of fresh air from everything else here.

**seanderlust** (10): d*cking me down is a prisoner's right???

**throwaway7650** (10): the production on this track is amazing, this is a 10 for that alone

**TiltControls** (10): it pains me that I can't also 11 this cause it's such a great song. also ssx reboot fun

**xavieryes** (10): CAN'T GET WHAT THEY WANT TO STEAL

**kappyko** (9.5): i still cannot believe harry houdini died bc a random ass kid punched him for a bit

**bbfan132** (9): i need to listen to this song more often, i’m liking it a lot!

**modulum83** (9): sensory overload as a pop song

**musical\_pyn** (9): I didn't really like this song on first listen, but it keeps growing and growing on me--and that bridge is incredible

**runaway3212** (9): Overrated tbh

**Stryxen** (9): when he says “an eye for an eye” i always thought he was saying "an iphone 9" so lemme give a 9

**welcome2thejam** (9): "Focus on your ability, gotta focus on your ability" Me before I utilize my Swinging Lightning Great Sword Strike, which delivers 24 hp of damage, with an additional 8 damage against axe and bow users

**gwenflip** (8.8): I want to mash this up with Electric Feel by MGMT

**jman457** (8.7): Fits all the trends of this timeline for better or worse. Love the vocal performance

**Brendon-Urine** (8.5): definitely the highlight from this album for me! the "focus on your abilities" part goes off

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): i think the music video made me give this song more points than i would otherwise

**GARjuna** (8): a BOP! a SERVE!

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): Didn't I say they were extremely great choruses on this album? This is definitely one of them, especially the final chorus with the ending. I love the glitchy nature of the production here, it's extremely catchy.

**Uberpigeon** (7.7): ok i the vocals a bit annoying sorry to all of the stan of this song

**omgitskebab** (7.5): think this is one of the first songs i heard (after pumped up kicks) and i was like oh cool!! i too sometimes wanna disappear

**daythreeinmiami** (7): The way they switch it up and slam it hard in the final choruses yes take me on a journey daddies.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I like the “oooooooooooooo” part

## **I want these scores to disappear**

**ebooks #5454** (6.5): cowboy music

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): I just don't love it, it seems like so much for nothing

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6): It's not bad, I like the pep. Plus some glitchy instrumentals. Just nothing too moving for me.

**fadedblue09** (4): I'm convinced I'm listening to a different song when everyone says this is a frontrunner

**frogaranaman** (10.091): I just think it's 2010s indie pop rock perfection is all

**CrimsonROSET** (9.909): Well, look at the material. You can be the judge of it. I could just leave it at that, but I think such a high average needs a bit more to be said. This album is my shit. It’s what I love on pop music: a twinge of a lyric you care about, a voice that maaaaybe hits the wrong notes a few too many times, but the main thing is that it has a hook. And holy shit, this album is full of hooks. Melodies that won’t get out of your head, small bits of chorus that won’t go out of your mind. I think I could sing the chorus to all of these songs if prompted, and the important part is that I’ll have a fucking blast doing it. I’ll dance my ass off until I get a noise complaint. And you can’t fucking stop me.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.682): Disclaimer: I could literally give every song a 10, but just like when rating 1989 on the 5th Anniversary Rate, I had to lower the scores of some of them in an attempt to be fairer with the other artists/albums. This is one of my favorite albums ever. It brings back so many good memories of my teens. I wish Jacob was still a member of the band, but nothing good lasts forever, I guess...

**TheQueenofVultures** (9.136): My first favorite album and I think it has held up incredibly well, but that maybe the nostalgia speaking for me

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9.091): A 4 song onslaught of classics

**\_\_Avaritia** (9.045): Even though Foster the People’s debut set a bit of a high watermark that they would never come close to replicating, Torches is still a fascinating, water-tight, complete package of bangers that really feature nary a weak spot. Its singles are still some of the best pop music that I’ve heard in my lifetime and its deep cuts are pretty dang cool, and that’s at the very worst. Mark’s production in making this album sound simultaneously bouncy, almost in a retro nostalgic kind of way, and yet irresistibly catchy and dancey, paired with very strong songwriting is what this album thrives on. Really the more I listen to Torches the more enamoured I am of each track that it houses, and the more I think this is pretty much one of the best if not the best indie pop rock records, probably ever.

**modulum83** (8.973): Foster The People were ahead of the fucking game in 2011. This is a dance-pop album with some of the most creative and wild production I've heard for its time, anticipating the mixture of synthpop and electronica aesthetics that acts like KKB and Grimes would later refine. All the songs are just fucking wild and packed with sounds, and ridiculously infectious.

**kappyko** (8.909): i got into an arguemnt on indieheads over the merits of this album

**jman457** (8.873): This album surprised me, like all killer no filler. While I dont see it being an all time fav album, its a very solid album.

**teenwitches** (8.591): this was practically the only album i listened to for all of summer 2011. mark foster is so good at crafting a hook, a ton of people didn't realize they were bopping along to a song about a spree killer. to use an sat word, the juxtaposition of upbeat grooves with dark/sad lyrics makes relistening to this album extremely rewarding.

**vayyiqra** (8.545): Fittingly for a band whose most famous song is a catchy ditty about mass murder, FTP's debut is full of upbeat but deceptively sad and dark songs. I was never that interested in the band until now, but the songwriting on this album hooked me. Mark Foster seems like a good guy who's had a very rough life, and I'm glad he seems to be doing well these days.

**skargardin** (8.545): I had a lot of fun redicovering some of the songs on this album, Houdini was an aboslute blast to rediscover.

**bridgemoney** (8.455): I listened to this first out of all the others and credit it for introducing me to indie pop in general. You can definitely hear Passion Pit's influence in these songs, although there's not as many deeper emotional messages behind the lyrics. I still don't know why Pumped Up Kicks became the big hit and not Helena Beat, Call It What You Want, or Houdini.

**TiltControls** (8.364): a few really great songs with some a bit less so (but still fun!) Though Pumped Up Kicks is in the middle of the album for me quality-wise I definitely appreciate that it helped put their name out there

**GapeCod** (8.273): https://generated.inspirobot.me/a/yzPWAdjmeX.jpg

**camerinian** (8.182): it was really nice to come back to this album after a very long time and a lot of development on my part. I'm really glad that so much of it has held up too. I was worried my more expansive listening might have made this a bit mundane, but the compositions really are there and if anything stand out even brighter for their craft.

**xxipil0ts** (8.018): The singles really sold this album more than some of the B-sides. Still, re-listening made me realize how PC music-ish some of the non-singles are.

**bigbigbee** (7.727): An extremely formative album in my life for the reasons I go into in my individual comments. The fact that this album didn’t have by far and away the highest average in the rate for me speaks to the other albums’ quality.

**welcome2thejam** (7.545): Of the four, this is probably the album I listen to most regularly nowadays, and it still surprised me how much better it was than I thought. Very, very solid overall with some big high points.

**celladonn** (7.500): A few massive bops on here, but also a few songs that don't do a whole lot for me

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (7.455): A hell of a debut album with a lot of great lyrics themes, fantastic instrumentation, and a ton of catchy songs with great big choruses. Foster the People got famous from Pumped Up Kicks for sure, but the rest of this album kept them a lot of fans and deservingly so.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.364): I had only heard Pumped Up Kicks from these guys before this rate and I was MISSING OUT. Thank you r/popheads!

**dicahprihoe** (7.091): This album was the soundtrack during my early teen years omg

**plastichaxan** (7.073): this has amazing moments, especially production-wise, but i feel like a lot of the writing holds it back more than the vocals which is what people seem to dislike the most, though i admit they weren’t always great

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.000): Jesus, does this song have some absolute bangers. It’s just a shame that they couldn’t keep up the energy for every track… But I’m still grateful to get to hear more of the band that made one of my favorite songs ever (Sit Next to Me!)

**thedoctordances1940** (6.955): It starts out really well but the longer it goes on the more it starts to lose me

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.909): my burning hatred for pumped up kicks very nearly put me off this album entirely, but thankfully almost every other song on this album is 10 times better than pumped up kick could ever wish to be and is filled with bangers after bangers

**Hulnia** (6.636): A pretty nice album with a few standout tracks, but it’s really inconsistent, and ultimately, kinda annoying, especially the vocals.

**imsodumb321** (6.545): Torches was an album I really enjoyed for the most part! There were a couple of songs I didn't enjoy too much, but I have a lot of good memories listening to it, so it's definitely a positive.

**omgitskebab** (6.364): last.fm tells me this is my most listened to FTP album

**fadedblue09** (5.727): I get that they're the most commercially relevant act here, but oooh boy this album was CHAOTIC. It's like every song tries to do something different….and not in a good way. Ultimately feels like a collection of various styles of pop-rock derivations and not owning any of them.

**Brendon-Urine** (5.455): Was not a fan. Houdini is awesome, Pumped Up Kicks is what it is, the rest I could honestly do without. The production ranged from bad to ok, and I can't get into his voice at all.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ...did any of us see this coming? When ballots first rolled in, TDCC had a hilariously lower average than every other artist, and we were expecting them to be the unfortunate slaughter victims. However, after recieving a string of high scoring ballots, they managed to bounce back and take the crown. It was ALWAYS an extremely close race however, and the Top 5 was constantly jumping around, but What You Know always managed to hold on. It's the most streamed track on Tourist History for a reason, it exemplifies what makes Tourist History a fantastic album, and it's got such widespread appeal. That cow bell and guitar riff opening immediately draws you in, and the song never lets go. A well deserved winner ~~that will absolutely be robbed in Winners 3.~~

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): I won’t lie, when this first became a winner, I was a bit shocked. What You Know is a great song, but our previous two winners (Sleepyhead and Helena Beat) were a classic and one of my favorite songs of all time respectively, so they just set a really high bar. I wasn’t sure how I felt about my third favorite Tourist History song beating the both of them. But it became clear that WYK wasn’t going anywhere but first and I think I’ve made my peace with this winner. After all, it’s the full package as a song: an immediately recognizable opening guitar riff, a chorus that’s impossible to not sing along to, and of course, the iconic music video. This only really matters to me, but I also love how this song has bookend’ed my two hosting gigs so far, with me using this song to [promo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/872172420910444585/899146377991430194/Screen_Shot_2021-10-17_at_12.06.24_AM.png) a potential FTP/TDCC rate in the future to now getting a chance to co-host that exact rate and having this song win. It’s poetic and how can I not love that? I hope everyone who was worried about a TDCC slaughter is excited to see this take first place and hopefully, you all show up and give this the same amount of love in Winners 3!!!

## **You! don't! want! to! be! alone!**

**agentofscranton** (11): my go to answer for my favourite song if i wanna make a good impression on the average looking nerd who's probably str8 but he said that ryan reynolds was hot once so maybe he's bi or pan but like probably not that i have a crush on this month

**BeauMeringue212** (11): This is indie pop perfection. The world was crying out for cowbells and TDCC listened. Also some of their better lyrics on the album. Not too complex but a bit more mature than some of their other lyrics (see below)

**emayzee** (11): i can't believe this song is actually making me nostalgic for being a depressed 15 year old that spent their days on tumblr. they're so sick for that

**fadedblue09** (11): A classic, the blend of synths and indie-rock guitar is perfect. Makes me emotional and nostalgic for some reason.

**modulum83** (11): TDCC sound like they're fighting for their lives trying to blast you with as much breathless wonder and euphoria as possible and it pays off incredibly. This is the centerpiece of Tourist History, the perfect song to introduce someone to indie music through. Every listen of this song feels like hearing it for the first time and having your mind blown that music is capable of making you feel like this - that it can make you feel THIS good!

**rotating3Dtext** (11): when I heard this at the club, I ascended

**Stryxen** (11): the first time i heard this song was at my friends’ battle of the bands competition at a pub in our town and one of the other bands played this and i thought it was an original so i looked it up online and got obsessed with two door cinema club and for just a little too long i thought i had seen two door cinema club live and they were so indie underground playing to a venue of like 200 people

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): i initially debated for a bit whether to give this or 1901 my 11 but in the end this song won out because i can still remember where i was when i heard this song for the first time and how i immediately knew i had heard one of my favorite songs less than a minute in. anyone who dislikes this has probably never had fun in their life.

**thedoctordances1940** (11): Such a catchy guitar riff, such a massive bop

**\_\_Avaritia** (10): The piece de resistance of Tourist History, What You Want is basically what every other song on this album kind of desperately wants to be but is the watermark it can’t hit. If you’ve seen the rest of my reviews of this album’s songs, you know that every TDCC trademark is here - the awesome, blaring guitar work, the kind of klutzy but snappy percussion, the soft verse 1 start, the awesome bridge and sticky as honey chorus. Just that wail at the end of each guitar loop, the chorus melody, just everything about it screams MUSIC and indie pop rock at its most essential and finest.

**Awkward\_King** (10): this deserves to win ignore that im not 11'ing it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It's the most streamed song on the album for a reason, people.

**brendjac** (10): indie pop perfection, my gateway drug into indie as a teen

**Brendon-Urine** (10): i go absolutely feral for this song

**bridgemoney** (10): You don't want to be aloooooooone.

**camerinian** (10): I’m just floored every single time by this song and how many all time great hooks are in it. Even the rhythm guitar riff is iconic, let alone the main synth line, the chorus vocal line, the verses. It’s just that perfect love-struck headrush that this genre does so well, and this is maybe the perfect synthesis of it? It’s just so watertight

**CrimsonROSET** (10): well what DO you know

**dicahprihoe** (10): this feels like undercover martyn but part 2

**frogaranaman** (10): THIS. RIGHT HERE. IS MY. PRETTY. BOY. SWAGGER (AYYY)

**GapeCod** (10): The way l1zzka defined my early 2010s by introducing me to this song and also Lorde, as well as inspiring my previous reddit username... Her power tbh. Stream аквадискотека (or don't).

**nootnoot781** (10): 3rd best thing to come out of northern ireland after derry girls and nadine coyle’s pronunciation of flour

**omgitskebab** (10): partly given such a high score... for the vibes n nostlagia

**Roxieloxie** (10): i cant stop thinking about that video in the post for this rate

**runaway3212** (10): This song is so memorable and great

**teenwitches** (10): perfect use of cowbell

**throwaway7650** (10): amazing chorus and that one synth is back again. love it

**waluigiest** (10): This song is peak Pandora-core for me. Truly this song had a grip on me 8-10 years ago.

**welcome2thejam** (10): An all-time infectious riff.

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): they surely know how to make good use of the electric guitar; their riffs are sick!

**Lilacly\_Adily** (9.5): the best song the record

**jackisboredtoday** (9.3): thinking about how I assumed I had never heard this band till hypno sent me a mashup with this for a shitpost in my own rate & it all came flooding back

**seanderlust** (9.2): while this does sound very similar to the rest of the tracks here, i think this is the one where everything clicks just right

**daythreeinmiami** (9): Lol the only song I know on this album. I had this song in heavy rotation in 2011 but I never listened really to the rest of the album. That guitar is so familiar

**plastichaxan** (9): we love a "oh, it's that song, i've heard it before" moment

**ctatkeson** (8.7): Another very strong song.  Everything seems to be working well together here.  Great guitar line and chorus

**akanewasright** (8.6): This MV… iconic

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is bringing me back, i’ve never heard this but still

**GARjuna** (8): was this used in an amv??? why does it sound so familiar?????

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (8): This is the second song on this record that really feels like it stands out. While the guitars continue to be fantastic, the bass groove is actually tremendous in the verses and plays off the guitar well. The chorus especially is a great earworm, while not feeling too similar to the other songs on the record.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Catchy, punchy, boppy, what else could you want in a song?

## **What you know about rolling in the deep?**

**jman457** (7.1): Wish there was a bit more for their biggest hit

**darjeelingdarkroast** (6.8): I'll have to sadly keep giving somewhat low scores for the vocals, but the bassline here is undeniable. Cheers to the bassist! Shout out to bassists! Stream "Can You Get to That" or  "Portrait of Tracy" or something!!!

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Oh I’ve heard this song before!

**frogaranaman** (10.000): so true

**Stryxen** (10.000): you just had to be there for this album, this (and the wombats) raised me tee be aitch

**kappyko** (9.818): i dont even think i expected to give this as high a score as i gave it rofl this is cum music

**GapeCod** (9.091): The cat on the cover is the most iconic part of this rate.

**CrimsonROSET** (9.000): The atmosphere on this album has been set-up from the first track, and it follows it through. It’s rainy, it’s quick, it’s not polished but it has a lot of emotions that it throws at you very quickly. It doesn’t fully expect you to keep up with it, but hey, sucks to suck they got a place to go and they’ll get there with you following along or not. Don’t slip on the sidewalk dumbass, we got somewhere to be. The pace ain’t giving out, the instruments all remain the same- they change how they act as they go, but you can always trace it back. Just don’t get lost on those drum solos.

**IIIHenryIII** (8.973): Damn, I loved this album. I am going to check out their other stuff. If they're as good as this, I'll probably be turning into a fan. They also get extra points for the cute album cover.

**fadedblue09** (8.727): Not familiar with this band at all, but this album is just... banger after banger. I think it suits my taste because it's very pop-punk adjacent, and guitars are more emphasized than synths. In a parallel universe, FOB's post-Infinity on High output would've been like this but oh well.

**bridgemoney** (8.545): The production on this is fantastic. I prefer the latter half over the first half, but it's still pretty strong all around.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.455): yeah it may just be the same song 10 times. but damn is it a good song to hear 10 times.

**omgitskebab** (8.409): i love this album. i think every track is amazing. while im still a tdcc fan this is he best albym. it holds up

**teenwitches** (8.364): tumblr indie pop at its most fun. for a brief time, this was playing on every hipster blog next to reblogged pictures of photoshopped galaxies and black and white portraits of white guys smoking cigarettes. out of all the albums in the rate, this is probably the most dated, but in a really good and nostalgic way.

**skargardin** (8.364): I think I enjoy listening to these songs individually than listening to this album front-to-back to be honest. There are some absolute bangers on here for sure.

**modulum83** (8.309): The platonic ideal of indie pop - in 32 minutes, Two Door Cinema Club take the basic template of "breathless alt-dance song with groovy guitars" and do everything humanly possible with it. Another way of putting it: this album contains ten of the best riffs ever written.

**\_\_Avaritia** (8.227): Tourist History is an immensely easy-to-like album, where even if the lead singer Alex’s performances are mostly nothing exactly to write home about and nor is anything here super ground-breaking, the melding instrumentation work on the guitars and percussion are excellent enough that it’s difficult to dislike the bright, but not sickeningly happy, and dance-able tracks that they compose of. It’s a little formulaic and predictable in song structure, yes, but the formula works so well and the album doesn’t overstay its welcome in the slightest that it’s easy to ignore it and just get lost in the music. NOW I know why my friends all liked this album when it came out, lol.

**plastichaxan** (8.136): my favorite of the albums for sure, everytime i thought i had found something i didn’t enjoy they took it and improved it, this has nice vocals, lyrics and production which is my main issue with some of these other albums or songs in them

**TiltControls** (8.136): maybe the weakest of the 4, but even then it still deserves its 8+ average from me. Also might be due to this one being the one of the 4 I've listened to the least before the rate, but even then I think there are less highs on the album compared to the others.

**Hulnia** (8.000): Well... this album surprised me.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.773): The best album here imo, definitely the one I knew the best coming in. I wasn't into this sound THAT much at any point but this album makes me wish I were

**thedoctordances1940** (7.727): Throughout the album the vocals could definitely be better, but it's still really fun

**vayyiqra** (7.636): This is my least favourite album in the rate, but that doesn't make it bad by any means. I feel the least connection to this band, and they were the only band I had never heard before doing this rate, so with that in mind my score is fairly good. Perhaps it will grow on me with time. I do like the dance-punk feel a lot of the songs have. As an aside, it's not surprising it was recorded in the same studio that Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix and even mixed by the same producer - they sound *very* similar.

**dicahprihoe** (7.545): Another soundtrack during my early teen years. I really thought I was the main character :sob:

**camerinian** (7.409): overall I think this album might be a bit of a victim of its own formula. It is a great formula, but it does wear out a bit in places and become a bit transparent. That said, the moment where it clicks are just transcendent. What You Know and Undercover Martyn could have been 11 contenders if I wasn't already married to my first choice, because they were huge growers throughout this process

**celladonn** (7.364): This album is good but oddly unmemorable to me. I enjoy it a lot while it's on but it doesn't really stick with me or make me want to come back to it.

**1998tweety** (7.227): they all sound the same nnn

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.182): I have honestly been looking for a Western version of a J-rock album, cause it’s not just a language barrier, there’s a whole different sound and set of chord progressions that sets it apart from Western rock. I think I finally found what I was searching for. Ultimately this album isn’t mind-blowing, but I’d say I had a fun time listening to it!

**jman457** (7.082): Honestly i like their later work better. This just is just a tier below the other albums here

**SmileAndTears** (7.000): I have nothing to say really... this is okay. A perfectly decent album

**welcome2thejam** (6.909): The sound of the guitars on this album and just how the instruments sound in general are chef's kiss and carry a lot of my goodwill for this record.

**Uberpigeon** (6.709): ok i need to explain myself before i tank this poor album. tdcc was constantly reccomended to me on spotify like they were DESPERATE trying to get me to listen to this goddamn band. and i tried... i tried! but theres just something about them that i do NOT vibe with... i just dont like them! i dont know why! anyway i went into this rate with an open mind but it turns out that all these years later...... i still dont like them that much edit: turns out i didnt even tank it that much

**Hey\_Middy\_Here** (6.273): A very bright, upbeat indie rock record with a ton of great guitar work and some nice pop elements it, but also a record which suffers from utilizing the same elements and sounds far too much to its detriment

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.909): I hope the cat on the album cover received fair compensation for its contributions.

**imsodumb321** (4.909): Ok. I don't know why, but Two Door Cinema Club has always rubbed me the wrong way. Not sure if it's some leftover superiority complex from 7th grade or what, but I just never understood the hype.. all their songs start out on this high note, and then they just get boring to me.

RandomHypnotica: Thank you so much to everyone who participated and came to the reveal! This rate was so much fun to host, and I'm so glad to have u/cremeebrulee co-hosting, she made everything so much easier, higher quality and funnier than I ever could've done on my own, and I can't wait to see you all again one day when we blackmail the ratcom into letting us host IPR2!!!

TiltControls: After 3 long years of waiting it's finally here ~~to break all my dreams as rates do, rip passion pit you deserved better~~ anyways creme and hypno great job hosting!! From the picks for the bonus rate to the amazing shitposts you both did AMAZING

Now [leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates!

Not too much for today, so I'll fluff it out by adding some context placements to put things in perspective!

##**Songs**

* As the only song with 9+ average (somehow - at least 8 other songs deserved that accolade too!), **What You Know** becomes the **221st** highest rated song of all time (putting it below Wham!'s Last Christmas and above Mariah's Shake It Off and **also** making it tied with Juice's 2019 Ult rate score)

* Not often that we talk about Bonus Rates, but **Midnight City** did well enough and becomes the **8th** highest rated bonus song of all time. This places it ahead of MNEK's Tongue (9th) and right behind Fiona Apple's stellar 1997 VMA's Acceptance Speech (7th)

##**Artists**

As none of these artists had been rated you can just check their album averages for comparisons, but if you're curious towards their overall placements

 * **TDCC**: 63rd/274 [placing them between The Beatles (62nd) and Grimes (64th)]

 * **Phoenix**: 70th/274 [between Mac Miller (69th) and Tegan & Sara (71st)]

 * **Foster the People**: 74th/274 [between Missy Elliott (73rd) and Paramore (75th)]

 * **Passion Pit**: 97th/274 [between Carly Rae Jepsen (96th) and K/DA (98th)]

GapeCod: Looking at how Midnight City has a higher average than What You Know, how many bonus rate songs have ever outscored the main rate winner?
[/r/popheads/comments/qa3ynr/indie_pop_rock_reveal_day_3_lets_get_these_scores/hh1gzbd/]

=====

TiltControls: WAIT THIS CAME UP A FEW DAYS AGO SO I ALREADY HAVE THE ANSWER

1. Little Mix - Shout Out to My Ex > Niall Horan - On the Loose (1D solo rate)
2. Taylor Swift - Safe & Sound > Taylor Swift - Enchanted (2010s Country classics)
3. Mark Ronson & Amy Winehouse - Valerie > Calvin Harris, Frank Ocean & Migos - Slide (Disco Funk Revival)
(For Disco/Funk the #2 bonus Daft Punk's 'One More Time' also beat 'Slide'!)
