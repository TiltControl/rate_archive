Hello hello hello and welcome to the **[2020 Breakup Pop/Rock Rate!!!](https://imgur.com/FYoyMu4)** I'm your overexposed host for this month, and this lovely May you'll all be keeping me sane through yet another lockdown (canada tingz!) as we experience three fantastic and personal albums from three very talented ladies that released last year! All of these are focused on a publicized breakup that said artists went through and wrote an album about, with the three of them all finding inspiration from pop-rock across their tracklists. They all received fairly warm reception in the subreddit and placed among our top 25 albums of 2020, but were not relevant enough to make an Ultimate rate, however they're certainly more than worthy of being rated so let's get to it!

#HALSEY - [MANIC](https://is1-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music124/v4/a7/92/ed/a792ed08-a1ff-29c4-f85f-ceace0afc2c3/19UMGIM75011.rgb.jpg/1200x1200bf-60.jpg)

> *"But you're not half the man you think that you are, and you can't fill the hole inside of you with money, girls, and cars"*

The trajectory of Halsey's singles over the past few years is quite interesting - in 2017, we saw the collaboration with then-boyfriend G-Eazy "Him & I", an ode to their lovely and perfectly fine relationship where they portray themselves as star-crossed lovers. Clearly... that didn't work out so well, with Halsey later following up with the scathing "Without Me" in 2018 that referenced their breakup. Supposedly meant as a bridge between her two album eras, the single saw immense success, reaching #1 and becoming one of the biggest songs of the decade. It was a few months later that Halsey then released "Nightmare", an aggressive pop-punk inspired track that instantly became a fan favourite, but fared far worse on the Billboard charts where it quickly fell off. What then happened is still a bit of an enigma, with Halsey herself saying she was "no longer angry" and did not wish for "Nightmare" to be the thematic basis for her upcoming third album while retroactively making "Without Me" the lead single. Others blame its poor chart performance for what *Manic* eventually became, but alas, in January of 2020 we received a more low-key and personal album from Halsey, devoid of the punk influence seen in her prior single. Nonetheless, it still contains some rock influences such as in the absolute banger "3AM" as well as some sweet, sweet breakup bliss, most notably in the hit single "You should be sad", a country-pop bop that, alongside the rest of the album's genre-hopping style, showed Halsey's versatility in what would become a lot of people's favourite album of hers. And since a lot of the album's discourse revolves around the exclusion of "Nightmare", I've decided to include it in the main rate anyways (as well as Be Kind with Marshmello, included on the deluxe streaming edition of the album)! 

1. Ashley
2. clementine

4. You should be sad
5. Forever ... (is a long time)
6. Dominic's Interlude
7. I HATE EVERYBODY

#MILEY CYRUS - [PLASTIC HEARTS](https://images.genius.com/d520a1ed72d11ce79ad9d50cbef9ffe9.1000x1000x1.png)

> *"Put you on a pedestal, you're cravin' the spotlight, desperate for attention, nose is bloody, it's daylight"*

Miley has been known, and perhaps is a bit infamous, for constantly switching up her genre, style, and influences, and then going back later down the line and disowning those periods of her life and career, but perhaps the most authentic Miley we've seen yet came in the form of *Plastic Hearts*, where she leans into her rock sensibilities more than ever and shines like she never has before. Packaged with collaborations from legends like Billy Idol and Joan Jett, as well as having a couple covers of absolute classics included in the tracklist, for a lot of people Miley finally struck gold after many years of what seemed like inauthenticity. The album makes many a reference to her long-lasting relationship with Liam Hemsworth, which had been heavily publicized for many years through the rocky splits and eventual (short-lived) marriage. Over the past decade, Miley had released many a song about this relationship that chronicled the rollercoaster it truly was - the iconic #1 hit "Wrecking Ball", the sweet "Malibu", and the surprise drop from their final breakup "Slide Away" as a few examples. Among the album are hard-hitting pop-rock bangers like the opener "WTF Do I Know", more currently-trendy synthpop-influenced tracks like "Midnight Sky" (a song that reached the top 5 of the Popheads SOTY 2020 list!), as well as a few personal ballads that showcase Miley's voice. In a cute viral moment, Miley's re-imagining of the Blondie classic "Heart of Glass" had a lot of people fawning over her undeniable presence as a performer and its success saw both it as well as her cover of "Zombie" by The Cranberries included on the album's official tracklist - as such, we'll be rating both of them in the main rate so if there's any diehard Debbie Harry stans out there, now's your chance to let the world know how much you hate Miley's version!

1. WTF Do I Know
2. Plastic Hearts
3. Angels Like You
4. Prisoner (feat. Dua Lipa)
5. Gimme What I Want
6. Night Crawling (feat. Billy Idol)
7. Midnight Sky
8. High
9. Hate Me
10. Bad Karma (feat. Joan Jett)
11. Never Be Me
12. Golden G String
13. Heart Of Glass (Live from the iHeart Festival)
14. Zombie (Live from the NIVA Save Our Stages Festival)

#HAYLEY WILLIAMS - [PETALS FOR ARMOR](https://is5-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music114/v4/17/6d/c4/176dc4f3-7688-1149-4f43-8e7db37eed60/075679827814.jpg/1200x1200bf-60.jpg)

> *"If my child needed protection from a fucker like that man, I'd sooner gut him, 'cause nothing cuts like a mother"*

Hayley Williams, frontwoman of iconic pop-punk-turned-pop-perfection band Paramore, has always been vocally against the idea of a solo career - in fact, way back in the 2000s when she was in conversations to be signed to a label as a teenager, they wanted her to be a solo pop girl but she refused and demanded to be able to perform with her friends as a full-fledged band. Though Hayley did do a couple collaborations on her own as a feature - such as on iconic hits like B.o.B's "Airplanes" and Zedd's "Stay The Night" - she remained adamant about staying true to Paramore as a band even through a whole lot of band drama and the exiting and re-entering of various members. That is, until her divorce from Chad Gilbert of band New Found Glory in 2017 after the release of Paramore's *After Laughter*. *Petals for Armor* chronicles Hayley's feelings about the split and has been described by her as something that allowed her to get raw with her songwriting and be able to finally exhale, and it shows in the various tracks that range from scathing, such as in the lead single "Simmer", to playful and nonchalant such as in the fan-favourite "Dead Horse", to downtempo and introspective in other album cuts, all of which find influence from rock and indie music but also with splashes of pop and delicious synths a la *After Laughter*. After much of Paramore's discography covered the adoration Hayley once felt for her ex-husband, including some of their most iconic songs like "The Only Exception" and "Still Into You", *Petals for Armor* provides current-day insight into those lost feelings as well as Hayley's current state - the album is split into and was released in three parts, which provide a timeline of sorts from the breakup into a state of peace as the album comes to a close. Though quite different from Paramore's output as a band, the album still saw quite a bit of love from Popheads and had several tracks reach the Top 100 SOTY list - and for those that didn't care for the stylistic difference, fear not as there has been much teasing of a new Paramore record coming soon!

1. Simmer
2. Leave It Alone
3. Cinnamon
4. Creepin'
5. Sudden Desire
6. Dead Horse
7. My Friend
8. Over Yet
9. Roses/Lotus/Violet/Iris
10. Why We Ever
11. Pure Love
12. Taken
13. Sugar On The Rim
14. Watch Me While I Bloom
15. Crystal Clear

* **Comments are encouraged! (but not required)** and can be added to any song by simply typing after inserting your score, like so:

        Dead Horse: 10 Oh my gosh it's Megan Thee Stallion! Megan! Megan!!! ahh
 * You may also leave comments for albums by adding a colon (:) after the album title in the ballot and typing to your heart's content.

* **DO NOT SABOTAGE!!!** Ridiculously low scores for any of the albums cause headaches for me as a host and make the whole experience less fun for everyone involved. If I feel your ballot contains sabotage I reserve the right to contact you to change it/write comments, or if worst comes to worst flat out reject it. **If you feel very negatively about an entire album/artist please try to write some comments about them so other people can understand why you dislike them!**

* **Your scores are not confidential** and will be revealed with your username attached to them when the results are released. Your taste will be revealed for all to see for better or for worse!

* If you want to change scores or add comments at any point, feel free to send me a message here on reddit or find me in the Popheads Discord!
