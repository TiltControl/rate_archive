My favourite ballad on the album, and although I think the placement of it is a bit odd in the tracklist, it's a very pleasant listen which is not something I can necessarily say about all the other ballads on Plastic Hearts. It squeezes its way into day 3 just barely, but also manages to be the first song in the rate to attain an 8.0+ average so good for it!

---

#this song is the angel in question

**jasannn** (11): I still find it a little jarring to put a ballad this early in the album but this is one of the best on the album.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (11): this feels like a perfect album closer/penultimate track honestly; her vocals are stunningly emotional

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This had no business being as sad as it is, especially in between the title track and Prisoner. Love it though, production is on point.

**akanewasright** (10): Her best song? Maybe. This very much reminds me of like... the ballads that rockers would put out to show that they were people. I don’t remember specifics besides “every rose has its thorns”, but it was a “thing”, and this song pays homage very well, while also just... idk, being a generally pretty and touching song i

**celladonn** (10): Of all the breakup songs in this rate, this is the only one I find relatable. What does that say about me

**CritneySpearz** (10): one of her best ballads (along with Bottom of the Ocean)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): There's this certain vulnerability and self-awareness that made me appreciate Miley a lot more as acknowledges her flaws in this song.

**fallenriot** (10): miley’s ballads are so heartbreaking, and i love the self-awareness

**ignitethephoenix** (10): love this so much, love the introspection on her lifestyle and relationship

**IIIHenryIII** (10): This almost got my 11. I would be totally fine if somebody shattered my heart and then wrote this for me.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): that chorus sends me ugh

**jaztinax** (10): an emotionally mature masterpiece

**juanolsen** (10): this hands down the best song on the album, the emotion in her voice and the way it's written it's simply beautiful

**poppinmmolly** (10): If I could have more than one 11 this would be another one

**savemeaseat143** (10): this song is spectacular, I just can’t get over the fantastic hook.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is one to belt in the car

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a gorgeous song

**throwaway7650** (10): first ballad on this album is also the best one. easy 10

**UselessTacooo** (9.8): there is so much emotion packed into this song. Even the instrumental prior to the final chorus feels so sad. There is no denying that this is a career highlight

**outsideeyess** (9.6): i need this to be a harry styles duet fo

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): a great ballad that I relate to.

**Leixander** (9): i just wish the chorus was a bit different, her vocals there kinda throw me off

**plastichaxan** (9): maybe ballads can be valid

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): don't put expectations on people, it never helps either party

**NotWith10000Men** (8.2): the first time I listened to this album I wasn't expecting it to be self-reflective and self-critical so this song fucked me up. The line about her mom saying he doesn't look happy especially

**1998tweety** (8): this is really nice but the line "Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave" is so clunky I had to take some points off for it especially cause it repeats so many times.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): a song I haven't revisited much since the album came out, I enjoyed this more than I expected!

**runaway3212** (8): emotional but also fun

**relibee2** (7.2): this gets a lot better around the 2 minute mark

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7): It’s interesting the first song is so much “it’s you not me” and this song is so much “it was entirely me” to the point it contrasts her ex husband with an angel and her the opposite. :( I think it’s a valid range of emotions but definitely makes me sad.

**frogaranaman** (7): good ballad but the pacing of this tracklist is so weird

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I want this to have a trap beat. No I won't be answering any questions.

#balladphobes

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): weird placement in the tracklist, feels more like a closer

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s pleasant but i feel like she’s straining way too much vocally

**pat-rickstar** (6.5): It's cute but doesn’t do much for me personally

**seanderlust** (6.4): you know what, i'm gonna say it. devils don't fly by natalia kills did this concept better. #controversialbutbrave

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): why was this the one i kept hearing on tiktok upon album release its not even one of Miley’s better ballads?

**CarlieScion** (6): balladphobia is me. I am balladphobia

**timothy444** (6): Terrific lyrics but let down by everything else from the production to the vocals

**ReallyCreative** (5.8): it's okay but it's not memorable

**Roxieloxie** (4): i dont think im gonna like this album much

**Stryxen** (4): never loved miley for her slower songs

**Awkward\_King** (3): is the melody of this similar to million reasons? i mean its definitely the same vibe but like the melody sounds the same even to me?? i think that might be why im really not keen on it, but i do like how it builds at least

**vayyiqra** (3): Not to be balladophobic but this is dreary as hell and boring

As a follow up to Nightmare? Meh! I recall being a bit disappointed with this when it came out because I so desperately wished that Halsey would have continued in that direction instead of styling the album around Without Me... but after giving it some time to grow I really like it now, the production is great and the melodies are infectious. I wish it didn't get caught between years on the charts, but maybe it is what she deserves for not being Nightmare-esque.

---

#Here lies Halsey's reputation

**astrologicalangel** (11): ugh, so good

**LuisEnRod** (11): life-changing

**timothy444** (11): This is one of my favourite song from her newest album. This is made of pure art. Love it and is worth of my 11.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Would’ve been my eleven. Love this song and the video.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): scalp-bending masterpiece

**bluetriangles04** (10): It’s basically Halsey offering a much more sad and melancholic side of the story from Without Me, and I love it.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/835747057716428830/856317516518129684/unknown.png

**endcreditouilles** (10): I'll never ever get tired of this song, it's a belt in the shower favorite for me. OH. CAUSE. I KEEP DIGGIN MYSELF DOWN DEEPER I WON'T STOP TIL I GET WHERE YOU ARE

**ignitethephoenix** (10): definitely one of my favorites on here, love the chorus so much

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): love this song and the video. i was disappointed initially when this came out because i LOVED nightmare but it grew on me alot and has great replayability

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): Not Manic having song titles like Graveyard and Killing Boys then serving soft rock… this song is gorgeous though!!

**akanewasright** (9): I was damn near willing to just let him talk to me crazy because that shit was out of this world, like “yes, daddy, yes, okay.” Like, I was literally willing to ruin my career. Um, if this ever came out, who it was, you would be like "Bitch, do you know what Google says?" Yes, I do, yes, I do. But I also know what that dick said. That dick spoke life into me. Invigoration, blessings, soul, turmoil. But, Heaven, Jesus, Allah, sorry please God, understand, this is just my truth

**CarlieScion** (9): her label really said to make without me 2.0

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This song really took a long time to grow on me. But something about this song really captivated me to keep listening to this to the point that I love it. Truly a gem in Halsey's single.

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): Where Magic cards end up after being played.

**jaztinax** (9): this song is super catchy. i love pop halsey bc even though the melody can be very simple and repetitive like a catchy pop song should be, she still has very strong lyrics to keep it captivating

**Ok\_Ant5217** (9): that MV is insanely good

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Am I basic for liking this more than most of the album?  Perhaps

**runaway3212** (8.5): This song misses energy but I like it

**savemeaseat143** (8.4): it’s a good song but it’s always felt a bit off to me

**UselessTacooo** (8.3): this song takes a bit of a drop in the album. In no way is it a bad song but I feel like hearing it all over the radio for so long made me lose interest in it. That aside, it’s an objectively good song so I feel the need to give it a few bonus points.

**starla\_** (8.1): halsey does breakup songs really well and this is no exception, so catchy and relatable

**celladonn** (8): when this came out I thought it was really boring and I still think it's boring but boring in a good way now

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (8): I like this song much more then I remember but I think I just got overexposed to it when I do respect how much she hustled for this era.

**fallenriot** (8): this was a really smart fall single, i’m glad it gave her some radioplay

**J\_Toe** (8): okay took a bit to build but once it reaches the minute mark it takes off. r/popheads has talked about this track a lot, and I get it now.

**juanolsen** (8): i like it but it's kinda generic

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): honestly I think this song is a lot better than most people admit, especially in the context of the album. Love the warm, summery vibe

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): when this was first released I was so disappointed it wasn’t a continuation of the Nightmare sound, but it grew on me and actually its a good single

**kirby31200** (7.5): Generic bops are good to have sometimes

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's good, there's not much more to say about it

**throwaway7650** (7.5): idk what to say about the song so... nice single cover!

**frogaranaman** (7): do you think someone has ever done it in a graveyard to this song

**ImADudeDuh** (7): i hated this song a lot when it first came out but it grew on me a bit

#don't let that sink in

**jasannn** (7): Why would an instrumental drop work here?

**mudkip1** (7): heard this on the radio a lot

**seanderlust** (6.5): stop saying "let that sink in" after saying something uninteresting challenge

**Awkward\_King** (6): is... is the audio for this the cup song...

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I don't get why she insisted on using these boring sounds in almost every track.

**NotWith10000Men** (6): let that damn sink in. it's getting cold out there. This one is so overplayed and reminds me of my one shitty semester of grad school rip but the clapping beat of the chorus is good

**ReallyCreative** (6): hmm

**wavingwolves** (5.9): like this song a lot more in the context of the album but it's still very much not great(yes i just copied my comment from another song idgaf i make my own rules)

**bbfan132** (5.5): feels like a random radio hit tacked onto the album at times, the production is pretty lackluster

**1998tweety** (5): sorry but this song has always kind of annoyed me, it bops a bit but feels so undercooked and was quite underwhelming to hear after Without Me

One of the boppier tracks on the album, Over Yet finds itself in Day 3 and we love that. This is definitely one of my faves on the album, the synths are just so fun and the fact that it wouldn't be out of place on After Laughter just makes it all the better. Really happy it made it this far!

---

#BREAK A SWEAT!

**ReallyCreative** (11): megabop

**Awkward\_King** (10): i have really vivid memories of playing wii sport to this song in like early lockdown. beating that fucker matt at tennis.

**cremeebrulee** (10): when was this bop here ???? hello???? how did i miss this?????

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this sounds like a haim track

**fallenriot** (10): what i asked myself as i listened to dopesmoker for the charity rate

**Leixander** (10): IF THERE'S RESISTANCE

**ManofOranges** (10): Bop.

**mudkip1** (10): this song is fantastic the album needs more of this

**seanderlust** (10): interesting combo of genre influence here! i love the chorus

**Stryxen** (10): IT’S THE RIGHT TIME, TO COME ALIVE BABY, IF YOU WANNA TRY

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this was the synthpop bop ya'll were hoping for when hayley first announced she was releasing solo music

**waluigiest** (10): WOW they really make you wait for the chorus and then it’s so lush and wonderful

**wavingwolves** (10): communist anthem

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): Over Yet has that inspiring 90’s synth blaring underneath, built up with lyrics about something that I’m sure everyone has gone through, especially with the pandemic.

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): this summer i'm gonna be in the club twerking to this

**throwaway7650** (9.5): the chorus is one of the best moments of this album

**IIIHenryIII** (9.1): This one is better than Dead Horse but I kinda wanna give it the same score (?) Maybe I just don't know how to rate songs (?). Let me fix that.

**savemeaseat143** (9.1): love the production on this one

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): It's Ohm's law I'm gonna meet you tonight.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): why is this kinda a bop???

**jaztinax** (9): i LOVE the way the chorus hits ughhh

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): the chorus of this makes me think old workout dvds for some reason? I just imagine some d-list celeb doing aerobics and a sweatband over a perm

**pat-rickstar** (9): I feel like I'm really basic and just prefer all the boppy songs on this album to the slower ones

**runaway3212** (9): I love this

**shesdoingyoga** (9): I love disco

**UselessTacooo** (9): I’m happy that there is a lot more going on in the production, but that cut ending runs me the wrong way every time I hear it. It’s simmer’s slow baby sister

**vayyiqra** (9): Pop Lady write synth bop about depression = Vayy bait

**relibee2** (8.7): I actually used to skip the song cuz I hated the chorus but it’s grown on me a lot

**starla\_** (8.5): this sounds like it should have been on After Laughter

**akanewasright** (8): one of the album’s biggest bops. It’s a wee bit... much for me? But I like it quite a bit

**bbfan132** (8): catchy bop!!

**CarlieScion** (8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): love the 80’s vibes on this one

**juanolsen** (8): i like the intention but it could've been better, still good tho

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): a little repetitive but that sound the chorus comes in with is heaven

**thedoctordances1940** (8): super bop

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): This feels like an After Laughter B-Side honestly

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes kinda cute

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): quite happy and cheery

**NotWith10000Men** (7): good example of being cohesive with the songs that came before but still standing out with the chorus

**timothy444** (6.5): good

#well it's over

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7): A little too repetitive for me

**musical\_pyn** (7): I love this chorus but really don't like the cadence of the verses

**frogaranaman** (6): chorus bangs but the verses.. meh

**AHSWeeknd** (5): The synth throws off the whole vibe of the album

Another day 3 song for Miley, this one is often praised for its production and I totally get that! I fear it's not one of my absolute faves on the album because I find the melodies a tad weak but the prod definitely is in the right direction and truthfully I wish the album had a bit more like it.

---

#Gimme more [2]

**outsideeyess** (11): the production is chef's kiss

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That vocal delivery is insane, Miley seriously knows how to sell a song. Beat, lyrics, production, it’s all so good. Plus this gets stuck in my head too often.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): the best song at the album, debatable I guess

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Miley and Nine Inch Nails is just a winning combo idk what else to say

**J\_Toe** (10): this is so cool. Love the Nine Inch Nails sound to the track

**jaztinax** (10): honestly my fav from this album. i love every element of this song and i would give a limb to see this live

**mudkip1** (10): YAAAAAAAAAAS

**relibee2** (10): thank you miley this is what I want

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The NIN Closer vibes I’m getting here make me think this would be an Ashley O song in her edgy era

**seanderlust** (10): love the line split on "give it to my/self-inflicted torture". this feels like a good late night drive song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): biggest grower on the album for me, tbh i think this had single potential

**throwaway7650** (10): 11 contender for me. we want an extended version!

**timothy444** (10): Didn't expect this song to turn 100% funky but here we are. What a banger!

**UselessTacooo** (9.1): The muffled guitar is so interesting and adds a lot to the song. Without it this song as a whole would not be nearly as good. This chorus is also one of the best she has ever had.

**1998tweety** (9): Massive serve, I lowkey prefer Rose's cover though nnn

**akanewasright** (9): There’s a music video for this by the drag queen Rosé that lives rent free in my mind. It’s *ridiculously* fun and made me like the song so much more.

**bluetriangles04** (9): My main complaint with this track is that it ends way too early!

**fallenriot** (9): would be a ten if it was longer </3

**IIIHenryIII** (9): So gimme what I want or I'll give it to myself, oh, she’s really horny!

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Love a good masturbation anthem

**jasannn** (8.5): Almost hyperpop

**wavingwolves** (8.4): this has such a good and strong chorus ~~and most songs on this album can't relate to that~~

**CrimsonROSET** (8): come on sexual pleasure!

**juanolsen** (8): i didn't quite like this one at first but I warmed up to it, i find it really interesting and kinda experimental in the context of the album

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): and now she doesn't bother with a third chorus -_-

**waluigiest** (8): the atmosphere that this song builds is so grand

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): *insert suggestive comment about "giving it to her" here*

**bbfan132** (7): miley sounds 10000000x better when singing poppier tracks with heavier vocal editing (especially with the brash production)

**frogaranaman** (7): I like the synths a ton

**NotWith10000Men** (7): after several listens to this album, I finally figured out what the hype was about and saved it

**vayyiqra** (7): Okay this is kind of a slapper

#This is not what I want

**Stryxen** (7): catchy but the lyrics are weak

**runaway3212** (6.5): I don't really feel this one

**Awkward\_King** (6): this song is not about sexual pleasure it is actually about simply wanting someone to buy plants for you no further fucking questions

**CarlieScion** (6): Stiffi - Respekt outsould

**ReallyCreative** (5.9): give ME what i want and make the whole song sound like the last part Miley sheesh

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): Some of the production is pretty nice but this is definitely one of the more forgettable tracks here.

This is potentially my favourite on the album, everything about it just comes together perfectly - the melodies, the synth part, Miley and Billy working together - a true banger. Although it falls just short of the top 10, this would probably have been my 11 if Nightmare wasn't included bc it's just such a BOP

---

#*synth solo*

**endcreditouilles** (11): This is so well done, both Miley and Billy are serving perfect 80's nostalgia. Miley is 100% in her element here.

**IIIHenryIII** (11): What can I say? These synths are fire! Owwwwwww!

**nootnoot781** (11): i love this song so much. i can’t really explain why; it just sounds so fucking cool. that instrumental break ended by miley’s scowl? perfection

**1998tweety** (10): MASSIVE BOP. Amazing chorus, love the throwback vibes.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): THATS BILLY FUCKING IDOL. I will never get over the fact that Billy Idol and Miley Cyrus have a song together. AHS: 1984 is also shook.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): just as great as the previous track, fits with them both

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I honestly don’t  know who billy Idol but I do lien their voice together here.

**fallenriot** (10): i love the chorus so much

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This song is so good and Billy somehow fits in perfectly

**ImADudeDuh** (10): is this about the X Man or Jake Jill-n-Hall?

**J\_Toe** (10): Love how well Miley and Billy work together on this track. Love the power pop/ new wave sound, and over all punk vibe. Fits the album so well.

**LuisEnRod** (10): https://youtu.be/vBk0P27QGmc

**ReallyCreative** (10): aren't night crawlers a kind of worm? anyway BOP

**relibee2** (10): honestly this would’ve gotten my 11 for plastic hearts if we were allowed to give one 11 per album (or if killing boys didn’t exist)

**rickikardashian** (10): the night when it's sneaking out and it has to crawl, idk i never heard the song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): bitch it’s the serve!!!!! glamorous dive bar energy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): ugh why didn't this have an october single release its PERFECT for halloween

**timothy444** (10): This is what r/music would listen to if they didn't know it was by Miley Cyrus

**waluigiest** (10): I love the xmen

**Brendon-Urine** (9): billy idol’s voice sounds off at points but otherwise this rocks hard

**jaztinax** (9): this sounds like it comes straight off of the billy idol vault

**mudkip1** (9): I think this is grungy and grimy which works pretty well for them together

**throwaway7650** (9): solid collab, this grew on me for sure

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i hope misandry doesnt kill this

**UselessTacooo** (8.8): I absolutely love this song. Billy Idol drags it down for me but there is no denying that the song as a whole is great.

**celladonn** (8.5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oWkZaB6RrIQ

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): is this disco

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): god billy idol sounds so fucking cool

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): It's an absolute bop and Billy Idol sounds so good, not a combo I would've ever thought of, but it really works.

**seanderlust** (8.2): LOVE billy idol's feature here. that said, the lyrics leave something to be desired.

**jasannn** (8): She really utilized all her features well in this album.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): their voices go REALLY well together

**starla\_** (8): i love the 80s

#Billy idol antis

**savemeaseat143** (7.8): not bad but doesn’t stand out to me

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): I feel like I would like this a lot more without Billy Idol?

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): when this is the one and only song that ever gets Billy Idol in a rate ever..

**akanewasright** (7): Whenever I think of this song, I think of kappy being shocked that they autotuned Billy Idol

**bbfan132** (5.5): the verses are decent but the chorus throws the song off for me - it feels like a silly imitation of 80s rock

**frogaranaman** (5): it’s a bit long

**runaway3212** (5): this starts out strong, but I don't really love it, it feels like it's missing something

**wavingwolves** (5): overall disapponting as a track

**CarlieScion** (4): nothing about this song works

**Stryxen** (3): meh i don’t like either of their voices on this

**Awkward\_King** (1): WHY DOES BILLY SOUND LIKE HE WOULD RATHER BE ANYWHERE BUT RECORDING THIS SONG

Another bop to follow up WTF Do I Know, although not quite as hard hitting. I still absolutely adore the chorus of this song though, it showcases Miley's delivery wondefully and is a melody that will forever be stuck in my head. #10 is an apt placement for it in my opinion, as it's really great but is just missing that something to carry it to the highest echelon in the rate.

---

#California dreaming

**ignitethephoenix** (11): one of my favorites here! I feel like this could have been a hit with the right promo. Lovely the melody and the bongos  used here

**WeakProduct** (11): This song is just unreal to me. It’s buildup to it’s kickass chorus, the fantastic lyrics, and Miley’s killer vocals. It’s rock and roll BABY

**1998tweety** (10): BIG BOP, deserved to SMASH

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This always deserves to be blasted at the loudest possible volume. A highlight, the production is insane.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when she wanted to support Elon Musk on SNL with this song, ugh a girlboss

**ManofOranges** (10): Bop, plain and simple

**runaway3212** (10): I just love how simple and complex this is at the same time

**shesdoingyoga** (10): A very strong 11 contender, this better be top 5

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song has had insane replayability for me, it's just enjoyable and fun and a great mix of country and rock

**throwaway7650** (10): excellent title track. the guitar solo is everything

**TiltControls** (10): the best title track in the rate

**UselessTacooo** (10): the vocal layering in the pre-chorus is to die for. Also I will stand by the fact that this chorus is the best one of her career. No, I do not take criticism.

**akanewasright** (9.5): I really, really like this song. It’s one of the songs that reminds me of the parts of my dad’s classic rock that I liked. I have one nitpick though: in the transition between the second verse and pre-chorus, I wish that Miley did a vocal slide up from “want me to be” up to “love me now”. It would just add a little more flair to the song

**juanolsen** (9.3): i love the country vibe of the song, the lyrics are great and the guitar solo near the end is godly

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): an almost-perfect title track

**endcreditouilles** (9): this song came on in a starbucks once while my mom and I were waiting on coffee and she said she loved it and asked me who it was by. I told her it was from Miley Cyrus' new album and she went "oh nevermind". Well

**IIIHenryIII** (9): The drums really sold me this song.

**outsideeyess** (8.5): the bongos are unnecessary

**savemeaseat143** (8.4): good post-chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (8): like what if it was a cover of heart of glass but the word 'glass' has been dubbed as 'PLASTIC' with a google translate voice? i'd still give it a 9 at least

**jaztinax** (8): honestly never realized how this could fit right into meet miley cyrus/breakout but it really does, doesn’t it?

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): lmfao I adore the TikToks on the lyric video

**zagreux** (7.9): That ending is absolutely fucking gorgeous

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): love Miley's vocals but that's about it

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): more like BOP rock

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): okay tell me I'm not crazy and the beginning of this song reminds you of east northumberland high??

#You drew stars around my heart but now it's bleeeeeeding

**CarlieScion** (7): Miley truly sounds like she’s been smoking for 50 years here

**fallenriot** (7): a grower for me but still not my fave

**J\_Toe** (7): i liked it when it was fresh, but now it's just okay. he bongo-core after WTF Do I Know is certainly a change of pace

**thedoctordances1940** (7): The chorus is really great, the rest is pretty eh.

**timothy444** (7): Mid-range bop

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): miley do u need to drink some water ?

**jasannn** (6.5): good song but its one of the few songs I don't have saved

**Stryxen** (6.5): the chorus is excellent but the rest just passes through me

**wavingwolves** (6.2): what's that laugh around 1:31 and why does it sound creepy

**frogaranaman** (6): title track

**LuisEnRod** (6): never been a fan of this song

**bbfan132** (5.5): too repetitive and the vocals don’t sound great but it’s catchy enough i guess

**bluetriangles04** (5): Imo a weak track to be the title of the body of work.

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (3): I really hate the percussion

BOP, this track is such an amazing opener for the third and final disc and I'm SO HAPPY it made it to the top 10!!! Belb if ur reading this u made points

---

#Pure bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): my favorite song from the album, made me flutter like a bee

**Awkward\_King** (11): I GIVE A LITTLE. YOU GIVE A LITTLE. WE GET A LITTLE. SENTIMENTAL.

**wavingwolves** (11): i could write an essay length comment about how much this song means to me but i still just say this is THE PUSSY PART of the whole rate because it's true

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Vocal delivery!

**akanewasright** (10): This is just a sweet, lovely bop

**cremeebrulee** (10): i love how much of self drag this song is

**endcreditouilles** (10): i give a little // you give a little // we get a little // ~~CINNAMON~~ sentimental

**frogaranaman** (10): pure fun!!!!

**Leixander** (10): take the vocoder part out and this is another 11 candidate

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): that outro though, *chef's kiss*

**mudkip1** (10): is that PARAMORE I hear?!?!?!?! The chorus is an instant 10

**Ok\_Ant5217** (10): I give a little, you give a little, we give a little cinnamono~

**pat-rickstar** (10): Banger. The hook is absolutely brilliant

**plastichaxan** (10): the first song of every part being a 10 as it should be

**rickikardashian** (10): is this disco

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): so true Hayley

**savemeaseat143** (10): she spoke facts

**Stryxen** (10): i love how the optimistic but harsh honesty of the 3rd act contrasts the hopeless ending of the 2nd act and it all begins with the little “hmph 😏”

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): now THIS is a bomb chorus

**UselessTacooo** (10): I absolutely adore this song. There isn’t a single bad moment in it.

**waluigiest** (10): wait.... I’m done hating! Today is LOVE. I love today.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): I kept confusing this with cinnamon, because when Hayley sings "sentimental" it sounds like "cinnamon"

**kirby31200** (9.5): A bit like a lost After Laughter track, which is a strong compliment

**jaztinax** (9): another song i missed wtf was going on with me the first few times i listened to this album. the bass line, YES. the chorus, EVERYTHING. wow this is good

**musical\_pyn** (9): I absolutley love the chorus

**runaway3212** (9): mega bop

**throwaway7650** (9): sonically this song sounds super fun even if the lyrics aren't

**bbfan132** (8.5): the chorus gives the song a wonderful boost of energy

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (8.5): The chorus really reminds me of After Laughter

**fallenriot** (8.5): certainly a bop, the verses do take it down from a ten for me though

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): love how groovy this one is

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Love the chorus here

**1998tweety** (8): why is the 2nd half of this album so much better

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i know jack shit about relationships, but TRUST! talk to each other! open up! don't be scared of the person you love!

**seanderlust** (8): kinda sounds like a jack antonoff production (compliment).

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): This sounds like an After Laughter track.

**relibee2** (7.5): I use to think Hayley said cinnamon instead of sentimental lol

**timothy444** (7.5): One of the more catchier songs.

BOP!!!! I was so happy to see this nab a spot in the top 10, and in fact it was actually doing better than #8 for literally the entire rating period, lmfao. I'm content with this spot tho, for a deep cut this far into the least popular album in the rate it really made its mark! I was not expecting this at all when first listening to PFA which made its moment even sweeter, and this is probably my favourite on the entire project.

---

#GAY RIGHTS

**fallenriot** (11): god this song goes so hard, it’s a banger AND the lyrics are so amazing and intriguing meshed with the poppier production

**frogaranaman** (11): this is exactly what I expected this song to sound like and I mean that in the best way possible

**static\_int\_husp** (11): Hayley's Artpop could mean anything

**waluigiest** (11): My #1 song of 2020. To me it is just the perfect example of explosive, pure joy. The entire album has been chronicling Hayley’s pain and trauma and loneliness and at the apex of Act 3 it climaxes into this club banger with lyrics about finding pockets of optimism, despite our difficult histories and ongoing struggles. Plus, this video exists 🏳️‍🌈 https://youtu.be/mLHRy89rrl4

**akanewasright** (10): This fucks

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): a club banger for my little closeted heart and soul

**Awkward\_King** (10): i want 2 dance 2 this at a party and be able to tell ppl its the chick from paramore

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Holy shit, this is easily the best track on the album. I feel like Hayley found her own niche in this song that feels so different from Paramore and very unique to her. If there is a Hayley song that must win the rate, it should be this one.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this sounds so different from anything else on the album but I absolutely love it

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this song title is gay coded

**jaztinax** (10): if we could give each album an 11 this would be mine for hayley. absolutely criminal that it’s one of the least streamed tracks of this album

**Leixander** (10): an actual bop? in my hayley williams album? it is more likely than you think.

**pat-rickstar** (10): Various dancing gifs

**plastichaxan** (10): i forgot how good this was wow

**RandomHypnotica** (10): is this disco?

**runaway3212** (10): sugar tastes so good

**seanderlust** (10): I really like this! strange but very good.

**skargardin** (10): bop alert

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): A WHOLE BOP i was shocked when i first heard this i couldn't believe hayley would make a song like this. pop perfection

**timothy444** (10): best song on the album

**UselessTacooo** (10): click clack click click click clack clock clack

**vayyiqra** (10): B O P

**wavingwolves** (10): SUGAR ON THE WHAT???? GIRL NO

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): is this disco

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): This is hyperpop

**throwaway7650** (9.5): super interesting analogy with the song title, bop btw

**1998tweety** (9): omg i love Vogue

**CrimsonROSET** (9): ooooh a sweet martini? sign me up (maybe less blood)

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): a certified bop

**relibee2** (9): is the sugar on the rim the best sugar or is it best in the bowl? Discuss

**Stryxen** (9): gay rights im afraid

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (8.8): I really like the click sound through this and the change in style. I wish she did more with her voice though or change it up more.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I was not expecting such an upbeat and house sounding track? I wish the album had more of these cuts

**bbfan132** (8): i like the pulsating beat, the production feels thin at times but it works

**IIIHenryIII** (8): This one is a grower.

**mudkip1** (8): this is camp

**musical\_pyn** (8): this grew on me so much

**rickikardashian** (7.8): sugar!? on the rim??!!!! it's more likely thank you think

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): never thought we’d get a voguing song from Hayley but I’m into it

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): it's quite a mix of a song but I like it. I would not be surprised if this picked up quite a few 0s though.

**J\_Toe** (7): one of the few experimental tracks I enojyed

**ManofOranges** (7): Can I get the tron? Can I get that remy? Can I get that coke? Can I get that heny? Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rock-rocks? Can I get sugar all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?

#Too sweet

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): this is so campy lmao, doesn't really suit her

**CarlieScion** (6): ehhhhh

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): it's okay I guess? Goes on way too long and it's only a 4 min song lmao

**AHSWeeknd** (5): an unexpected bop but it feels so out of place.

**NapsAndNetflix** (1): I've always hated that type of production that they have on her voice when she says "sugar on the rim" idk how to describe it other than like a 2000's movie has a drag queen singing in a nightclub but it's just that paired with like a lame melody and uninteresting lyrics

This was our introduction to Petals for Armor and it's very different from what Hayley had done with Paramore, which was a bit of a shock but after getting used to it this song is so good. The first line, "rage is a quiet thing", sets the scene for the album PERFRECTLY,

---

#Ladies, I'm boiling

**bbfan132** (11): excellent delivery, great lyrics, just everything you want in one song

**starla\_** (11): this is...so good!! Gets stuck in my head often, but I don't mind

**throwaway7650** (11): the intro, the lyrics, the instruments, the album title reference... hayley really did that in releasing this as her first solo single. a worthy 11

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A great opener tbh.

**Awkward\_King** (10): while i think other songs would've had better impact as the 'lead' from this album and for hayley's solo work, got this song is moody as fuck and packs such a punch. the intro is so brooding and it builds up to such a smooth song. hearing hayley say **fuck**er made me scream and that line is so perfectly written and sung. also KEVIN

**CarlieScion** (10): simmah simmah simmah simmah down

**cremeebrulee** (10): idk what yall were expecting from a solo hayley project but when this dropped i was scalped

**CrimsonROSET** (10): me when someone asks me what's the thing right below a boil

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I love angry resentful music

**juanolsen** (10): this song really hits home as someone who usually builds up a lot of anger due to never standing up for myself

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): GIVE IN

**mudkip1** (10): this is fucking great!!?!?!?!?!?!??

**pat-rickstar** (10): Fantastic opener

**Roxieloxie** (10): bop

**seanderlust** (10): i'm obsessed with the metaphor of petals for armor meaning staying soft and gentle in a hard world. hayley did not miss with that one

**SFbby** (10): Praying this makes it to the top 10 at least cause everything else from this album is gonna get slaughtered

**Stryxen** (10): “rage is quiet thing” is the perfect opener to this era

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): This song is powerful

**UselessTacooo** (10): Misandrist kween.

**vayyiqra** (10): This is a very unique and interesting song !

**waluigiest** (10): “rage is a quiet thing” when I tell you I was on the floor the first time I heard this song…

**wavingwolves** (10): this is the ultimate fuck men anthem isn't it

**zagreux** (10): I live for that "fucker" and the electric guitar on this song.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): everytime the chorus starts, for a split second i think she's just shouting "CUNT"

**bluetriangles04** (9.5): Rage is such an indescribable emotion since there are so many hues to it. Anger, sadness, emptiness and much more. Hayley does it justice here.

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): mmmmahhhhh ^GIVEIN

**akanewasright** (9): This goes on a touch too long for my liking, but it’s so damn well done

**celladonn** (9): Her saying "fucker" was a cultural reset

**LuisEnRod** (9): absolute banger of an opening but the Caroline Polachek remix is far better

**Ok\_Ant5217** (9): bit of a shame no fuckers are getting gutted in the vid, groovy song regardless... also what the hell is that interlude

**ReallyCreative** (9): I don't know who Kevin is but boy you better run!!

**TiltControls** (9): I kind of prefer the one with Caroline tbh. But great song!

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Oh God, what's the intro to this song? It sounds so good and fleeting.

**jaztinax** (8.5): it was almost a 9 purely for the last 2-3 lines of the second verse

**1998tweety** (8): at least she started the album off with a good song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a great lead single

**fallenriot** (8): sick lead single, haunting bridge

**frogaranaman** (8): is Hayley Williams saying nussy in this song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): remember when everyone was hoping hayley would do a synthpop solo and this came out and ya'll were like wtffff. anyway, the lyrics in this are scathing and the way she says fucker is perfection

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Pretty good opener, as good as it gets on the very weak first disc.

#Fuckers

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): love how it’s called Simmer and the sound is “simmering” but it’s just too stripped back for me

**astrologicalangel** (7): I enjoyed the energy, but the ending kind of killed it for me

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this song really shrunk on me

**savemeaseat143** (7): I don’t really like listening to it but I admire how it sounds like female rage

**shesdoingyoga** (7): I prefer the Caroline Polachek Remix

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): I like the chorus but the rest of the song just isn't doing it for me

**runaway3212** (6): I don't love CD 1 that much

**NapsAndNetflix** (4): I think I was just expecting more since this was the only song from the album I had even heard of before but like I don't know if I'm just underwhelmed from expectations or underwhelmed because it's boring

WHEW what an opener for the album! If anything, this song is so good that it sets the bar way too high for the rest of the tracks to come. This is precisely what I wanted Miley to go for with Plastic Hearts and even if I find the album a bit too ballad-heavy, there are definitely still fantastic bangers like this to keep me coming back. This spent a fair amount of time in the top 5 but fell just short of it as the rate neared its end, which is unfortunate but alas.

---

#I don't know anything

**CritneySpearz** (11): this literally helped me get over my first heartbreak that I’m still going through tysm Miley u saved my sanity (mostly)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): An insane way to start the album, getting right up into the straightforward nature of the album.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): an ALBUM OPENER right here. Fuck yea.

**CarlieScion** (10): the Brats Rock Angelz OST of it all

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): Love the guitars in the intro and I LOVE the sound choices during the “and I, and I don’t event miss you”.

**endcreditouilles** (10): her low voice in this is a SERVE. Absolute banger of an opener.

**fallenriot** (10): such a fun opener, really sets the tone for the rest

**ignitethephoenix** (10): slapper

**J\_Toe** (10): honestly iconic. I didn't listen to the leaks and didn't anticipate this blink182 direction, but I very much appreciate it!

**juanolsen** (10): now this is how you open an album, the way she addresses everything going on in her life is really clever and the bass and guitar are great

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): absolute banger, perfect choice to open the album

**mudkip1** (10): this is such a good opener god Miley can do no wrong

**Roxieloxie** (10): i told my self this was a hannah montanah 3 bside and i started liking it more

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): a BANGER!!! I live for the Bratz Rock Angelz energy of this combined with Miley’s genuinely gritty performance. I always play this at least twice before moving on to the rest of Plastic Hearts.

**shesdoingyoga** (10): I ask myself this every moment of every day

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): wew what an opener

**starla\_** (9.1): relatable queen

**ImADudeDuh** (9): clearly not how to get a top 10 hit 😔😔😔

**jaztinax** (9): “maybe getting married just to call it a distraction” is such a hard-hitting line like damn

**kirby31200** (9): A great high-energy opener

**LuisEnRod** (9): if the whole album had followed this sound I would’ve been absolutely sold on it

**ManofOranges** (9): Good opener and my favorite one of the rate I think.

**runaway3212** (9): I know some people find this a bit cringe and I get why, but god the 'Am I wrong that I moved on' part is so great

**seanderlust** (9): socrates be like

**throwaway7650** (9): really great intro to this album. fun lyrics too

**timothy444** (9): A rockin' way to start off an epic pop rock album that tells us, the listener, that we are going to listen to some nostalgic 80s-esque bangers

**UselessTacooo** (9): there’s barely a low point on this album and this song shows just how good it will be. Is it necessarily the best opener? Definitely not but it’s so much fun and that guitar solo is everything

**waluigiest** (9): A fantastic introduction - that opening bassline is SO SEXY

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): Solid first track.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): "Probably not gon' wanna play me on your station" smh justice for rock music

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): took Miley long enough, but finally she's going rock

**ReallyCreative** (8): me at work

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Her voice just suits this style so fucking well

#alessia cara - know it all

The fan fave, the boppiest, the main promoted single post-album release, Dead Horse finds itself reaching the top 5 and being Hayley's highest song... but unfortunately, it just wasn't enough. Honestly I expected Hayley to do worse in this rate, like... Kylie/D'Angelo tier, so seeing her not flop TOO hard is music to my ears, and I really can't say that the four songs above this are undeserving at all. See you in All Stars 5!

---

#YA YA YA YA, YA YA YA YA

**akanewasright** (11): This is like... the basic 11 off this album, but when it’s right, it’s right. It slaps hard as all hell, and these lyrics are just so goddamn cutting. The “dream of you holding me.... underwater... *is that a dream or a memory*” line early on is actually a jaw dropper. For how breezy and fun the song is musically, every line of it, especially in the verses is just so *personal*.

**Roxieloxie** (11): i just think its neat

**Saison\_Marguerite** (11): The romantic-to-sinister fakeout of the opening lines is my favourite bit of songwriting in the rate.

**seanderlust** (11): so the new found glory dude cheated on hayley? phew...biggest L i've ever heard of. anyways, i'm giving this my 11 because everything about this works - from the voice note at the beginning, the tropical upbeat background, the backstory for the song, all of it. I am obsessed.

**Stryxen** (11): the way she’s just like god my songs suck and i'm like (11) omg so true

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): the second best song from the album

**Awkward\_King** (10): I JUST REMEMBERED THE WHOLE REASON I INITIALLY REALLY WANTED TO HOST WHATEVER RATE THIS WAS IN AND TRIED SHOEHORNING IT IN LOADS OF DIFFERENT COMBOS WAS BECAUSE I WANTED TO PLAY A NEWS REPORT ABOUT BRITISH SUPERMARKETS SELLING HORSEMEAT AS THE SHITPOST why did my brain do that

**bluetriangles04** (10): Raw, honest, truthful lyrics span across PFA. Choosing this as a promotional track along with Simmer was bold and both songs see Hayley in her best form lyrics wise, also it’s just a bop.

**CarlieScion** (10): a bop talking about depression? What is this, After Laughter?

**cremeebrulee** (10): chad gilbert IS OVER!!!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (10): maybe this being the fan fave made some points, this was almost my 11

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I really like how the album talks about the collapse of her marriage or the aftermath but she also does talk about how she was also the other woman once. Which doesn’t change that cheating is wrong but it is a good degree of self awareness. Also I ducking love stuff that talks about “yes I should let this go but ONE MORE thing”

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I wish I could have known about the view from halfway down.

**fallenriot** (10): DRAG THAT BITCH

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was one of the only songs I heard before hand but I really like it

**jaztinax** (10): favorite since the start. hayley SNAPPED with the lyrics. queen behavior

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): Best song on the album, GET HIS ASS HAYLEY

**LuisEnRod** (10): justice for dead whores

**ManofOranges** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW48eqloIKo

**Ok\_Ant5217** (10): this is SOME intro to PFA II... I see why this is a fan fav

**plastichaxan** (10): this chorus is just too good

**relibee2** (10): this song is still amazing like really the yayayaya part is iconic

**rickikardashian** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EW48eqloIKo

**runaway3212** (10): bop!

**skargardin** (10): depression anthem yas

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the intro is relatable af, the line "i got what i deserved, i was the other woman first" oooof. love a darker lyrics with upbeat tune

**throwaway7650** (10): the intro is way too relatable... literally struggling with doing shit (aside from doing this rate) as I do this rate. YA YA YA YA YA YA YA YA

**waluigiest** (10): one of the peaks of the album. It has this colorful songwriting that’s both ornate and narrative, and it fits over a fun After Laughter-esque indie pop beat. Excellence.

**wavingwolves** (10): "sorry i was in a depression, i'm trying to come out of it now" yass girl! work that depression out!

**zagreux** (10): The callback to *The Only Exception* is genius

**savemeaseat143** (9.8): the catchiest song on this album, the piano riff goes off

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Would be a 10 but I don’t like the little spoken intro, it feels like she didn’t trust the song to stand on its own so added that to the beginning to make sure people got what she was trying to say even though it makes sense without it

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This definitely felt like the Paramore I know but this is still very Hayley if that make sense. I can see why she was hesitant to release this since this is kind of similar to Paramore's style, but I am glad she included this in the album.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): This should’ve been a ten, but I hate those ya-ya’s.

**NotWith10000Men** (9): LOVE this chorus. fun, happy sound plus sad lyrics is one of my fave dichotomies. Just wish the drums were more prominent

**UselessTacooo** (9): YAYAYAYAYAYAYAYAYA. That’s the comment.

**vayyiqra** (9): I like the depression song because it Bops and I have depression

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): It's definitely an absolute bop, I just don't adore it even though I kinda want to.

**endcreditouilles** (8.3): not a huge fan of the "ya ya yas", otherwise this song would have a much higher score

**AHSWeeknd** (8): a song named Dead Horse wouldn’t not deliver.

**frogaranaman** (8): where the circlejerk sub finds their jokes

**RandomHypnotica** (8): me trying to come up with banner worthy comments

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit which is a big step up from the rest of the album

**bbfan132** (7): didn’t really click for me but it’s grown on me, it’s fun to dance/sing along to

#Shitty neverending song

**devilonmytongue0** (7): honestly the prologue bit ruined it for me a bit

**J\_Toe** (7): first track since Simmer that is listenable. Would usually give it a 5, but I'm just glad it's not uncomfortable listening, and the Peter Gabriel drums was random but goo.

**kirby31200** (7): A shitty neverending song

**Leixander** (7): this will be the highest ranked song here and i'll still wonder why people like it so much

**ReallyCreative** (7): simultaneously great and grating, queen of duality

**timothy444** (7): cool song hayley but why did you have to kill Rainbow Dash in front of me?

**starla\_** (5.1): the album's low point IMO

**ImADudeDuh** (5): “skip it like a record” I would skip this record [2]

My 11 and what a deserved one it is. Halsey starting off her era with this absolute banger of a song with the absolute stunner of a music video and a clear sonic and visual aesthetic that led to her making an amazing punk-inspired album that was by far her best yet- oh... Well, yeah this didn't happen of course but at least this track came out of it. By far my favourite song she's done, I truly just can't get enough of it and thank god it wormed its way into the top 5 eventually because for the longest time this was in the lower half of the top 10. I wish it could have won, but with two zeroes under its belt it just wasn't meant to be.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): it shouldn’t be in the rate but its easily the best song here so like…? what should I do not 11 it? the cultural reset we could've had if people didn't let this song flop will haunt me

**ktajlili** (11): This is my favorite thing that Halsey has put out, and contains some of the sharpest songwriting.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (11): if I see anyone implying that this song is overrated you better be ready to catch these hands!!! this song is IT.

**RandomHypnotica** (11): why she refused to put this on any version of Manic drives me absolutely insane... it's a song only Halsey has the attitude and personality to pull off without coming across as too edgy or insincere, and is truly her best work (sorry John, it's not Without Me)

**TragicKingdom1** (11): seethe /u/ImADudeDuh

**1998tweety** (10): one of her best songs ever, the lead into the chorus is so damn good. we need a whole album of these.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): an eleven contender and deserves to be a rate winner. The video is also the only instance when Hannah Lux Davis’ beauty shots sell a video.

**akanewasright** (10): This song does not belong on the album. It’s focused outward instead of inward. It seeks to talk about big issues instead of Halsey’s personal problems or mentality. BUT Be Kind isn’t on the album really either, so I’ll rate this fairly. It’s superlative and I hope it makes it into the top 5

**astrologicalangel** (10): this would be an 11 but I think overplay is getting to me a little

**bluetriangles04** (10): Nightmare apologist here checking in...

**celladonn** (10): Smash. Give us the rock album Halsey

**cremeebrulee** (10): halsey claim this song challenge

**CritneySpearz** (10): imagine a re-release in 2021 featuring Willow, THE POWER that would have..

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): I feel like this song was way ahead of its time in some way because this would've been a bigger hit in 2021. I can see why Halsey didn't include this song since the entire album is more low-key and having this would feel weird. But dang, justice for Nightmare.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I DON'T OWE YOU A GODDAMN THING

**fallenriot** (10): why. wasn’t. this. on. the. album.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I don't get why she didn't give us more of this on the album. C'mon!

**juanolsen** (10): this is easily one of halsey's best songs, she really outdid herself here and i wish more of the album was like this

**ManofOranges** (10): I begrudgingly admit that I do like this song

**mudkip1** (10): probably her best! id be fine if this won

**NotWith10000Men** (10): "I'm tired and angry but somebody should be." halsey make an album that sounds like this challenge

**Ok\_Ant5217** (10): too good for the album and Halsey knows it, hope she tries this again

**pat-rickstar** (10): Just for how much the chorus goes off alone, this is a 10

**plastichaxan** (10): this so easily washes everything in the album i don't know what to tell you

**relibee2** (10): pls don’t curse me with nightmares halsey

**rickikardashian** (10): \*gives this a 10* “well, that’s enough feminism for today”

**runaway3212** (10): iconic

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): The lyrics are so on point, anger can be a tool for good, and I’m obsessed with this sound for Halsey!!! though I respect the way she made a largely down to earth and mellow album with Manic and it's her most mature and cohesive yet, I hope she comes back to this short lived era!

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is it

**skargardin** (10): for an album being about the "full emotional spectrum", it really was a choice not to include this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): wew what a song and still can't believe it wasn't on the album but that's been discussed a lot. another strong 11 contender and my second fave halsey song

**UselessTacooo** (10): “I. I KEEP A RECORD OF THE WRECKAGE IN MY LIFE!” Need I say more?

**wavingwolves** (10): when this wins OPRAH

**ignitethephoenix** (9.8): major bop should have been on the album. Although I do think the production in the chorus isn’t great but I can ignore that because it bops

**starla\_** (9.7): Y E S why didn't the whole album sound like this??????

**TiltControls** (9.5): can't wait for us to get Halsey to do this rate and she's the lowest scorer for this song!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this makes wanna buy a wig and burn it in front of my r/PAN viewers

**Awkward\_King** (9): WISH'D I COULD CUT SOME PARTS OFF WITH SOME SCISSORS

**jasannn** (9): ok go off

**jaztinax** (9): i need an album with songs like this one and “experiment on me”

**kirby31200** (9): I want to say this isn't that special but I've also had it on regular rotation for weeks

**Roxieloxie** (9): can i just give this a ten cause im h word on main for her in this video

**outsideeyess** (8.7): this should've been the album's direction

**Leixander** (8.5): hated this a lot back in first listen, the chorus found its way to my brain though somehow

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): should've been on manic!!!

**Raykel** (8.5): I don't care what Halsey says! This would've fit well in the album!

**waluigiest** (7): “record of the wreckage” such an earworm

#A nightmare, literally a nightmare

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the visuals in this are stunning, but the song is kinda meh sometimes

**throwaway7650** (8): this is a good song but I find the chorus production a little grating. would love for halsey to experiment more in this direction though

**savemeaseat143** (7.8): it’s not bad but I don’t understand why people go so hard for it

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I still don't know how I feel about this chorus, it's simultaneously absolutely fucking amazing and just far too much. I think I like it though.

**timothy444** (7): I sense an angsty vibe to this song, one that promises no one will cry at any point. What a nightmare!

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s grown on me with time, not totally into it but still

**Stryxen** (6.5): ngl this is underwhelming after hearing this was supposed to be amazing :(

**Brendon-Urine** (5): Ik I’m in the minority buuuuuuuut this song is meh. I like the chorus but the verses seem slapped together last second.

**frogaranaman** (5): never cared for this!

**musical\_pyn** (5): I'd rate this lower but there are some parts I do like (like the second verse), I just realllly don't like the chorus (especially the production)

**ReallyCreative** (5): this is what y'all hyped up? ok I guess

**seanderlust** (4.1): this song is a nightmare

**J\_Toe** (4): not fun to listen to, for me, personally (and this is my metric for listening to music)

**ImADudeDuh** (0): “halsey makes a punk rock feminist anthem” fuck yeah! \*listens to the song and its horrible production\* oh no

Halsey's ode to the ladies of country nabs her #3, although for a good period of the rate it was a true contender for the crown. It ended up receiving a couple 1s alongside some mid scores that threw it out of the running, but it put up a good fight and I'm happy to see that because this is such a stunning track, probably my favourite on Manic. The country-pop vibes fit the scathing burn towards G-Eazy so well and her delivery is stellar IMO. It's now up to 3AM to get the #1 for Halsey!

---

#Cowgirls

**Brendon-Urine** (11): her best song? Ya it’s true. The pure hate in the lyrics is something else, and I’m all over the light lil instrumental. BIG shoutout to Halsey, absolutely in her bag on this song.

**pat-rickstar** (11): This song shouldn’t work for me nearly as well as it does… this sound suits Halsey so well and the lyrics are so cutting. I love it

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): omg having to pick between this and midnight sky for my 11 was super hard but i figure midnight sky will probably be a shoe in so.... i'm going to root for an underdog and try to provide some competition lol. i love how this song is both upbeat and also melancholic. the production is fantastic, great vocals, catchy and has a great burn towards g-eazy - what more could you want.

**UselessTacooo** (11): I felt like this song was boring and then I suddenly started bawling? There is so much emotion built into those verses. The chorus takes a dip but I can’t help but adore the song for the rest of it

**1998tweety** (10): i was NOT expecting this to serve so hard. the chorus bops so damn much

**AHSWeeknd** (10): As an AHS stan I want to believe this is about Evan Peters.

**akanewasright** (10): “I’m so glad I never ever had a baby with you, Cuz you can’t love no one unless there’s something in it for you” is a good line, actually

**CrimsonROSET** (10): gaslight gatekeep girlboss

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I love how explicitly pissed she is at her ex on this and the baby line is both unique and also very personal and very clear to audience in what an insult it is. I also really like how she and Hayley basically both say they would never have kids with their exes in songs about what bad partners their exes were.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): I am.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this song and its music video are a perfect representation of my slutty hannah montana aesthetic.

**fallenriot** (10): idk if this is an unpopular opinion or not but this is one of my faves from the album and from her as a whole. it’s what made me check out the album in the first place and what made me a fan

**ignitethephoenix** (10): her best song! We do not Stan G Eazy

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Old Town Road who? As a country music fan, I approve of this. It sounds like something out of Shania's vault.

**jaztinax** (10): go off country pop queen. wait-- imagine miley on a remix 🤯🤯

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): I know some people have said the baby line is too much or cringy but it's so BRUTALLY honest and I think it works so well. GET HIS ASS GIRL!

**ManofOranges** (10): This was like the one song off of this album that I had heard prior to this rate that had actually impressed me on first listen. Probably my favorite off the album to this day, it's just a bop, and there's not much else to say. Except: I thought it was crocodile tears and not alligator tears??

**nootnoot781** (10): no thoughts, just the music video

**runaway3212** (10): I really love the energy in this as well as how angry she sounds. Good for her

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): G-Eazy should be sad but I am happy when I hear this bop! Halsey’s candid, unrelenting venting session seems so spontaneous in song form, but it’s super tightly written, and Greg Kurstin getting in his pop country bag sounds so effortless

**seanderlust** (10): the pre-chorus/chorus here hit so hard damn. good work halsey

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This is good

**throwaway7650** (10): I know some think this song is too personal but I don't mind it. love this genre from her, beautiful background vocals and harmonies

**TiltControls** (10): another 11 contender!

**timothy444** (10): I remember being put off listening to this just because it was promoted as a "country" song but that aside, it works well as a song that is sorta country and sorta ballad.

**starla\_** (9.8): graveyard followed by this is such a one-two punch, righteous anger banger

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): :pensivecowgirl:

**relibee2** (9.3): unlike the songs title, it gives me serotonin.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): Halsey dragging G-Eazy is music to my ears.

**frogaranaman** (9): literally what did she expect when dating G-Eazy I’m dead serious

**jasannn** (9): This country pop song was kinda random but it works.

**juanolsen** (9): g-eazy found dead in a ditch

**NotWith10000Men** (9): not only is this a country song, it kicks nashville's ass. "I'm so glad I never ever had a baby with you"? The five writers in nashville wish they could come up with something so personal for their ten zillion copy/paste white dudes

**rickikardashian** (9): she actually just let that baby line out in the world and left us to deal with is, she’s crazy for that

**thedoctordances1940** (9): It's times like these where I really love Halsey, her vocal delivery here is absolutely amazing and feels really unique.

**savemeaseat143** (8.9): great song but her indie accent and country production don’t meld well for me

**wavingwolves** (8.8): the I'M SO GLAD I NEVER EVER HAD A BABY WITH YOU line hits different now and GOOD FOR HER!!!!! fuck this guy

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): g-eazy is OVER!!!!!

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): the only artist in this rate who isn’t from Nashville has the best country song in the rate?? who’d’ve guessed

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): that ARTPOP reference i-

**Stryxen** (8): something in her accent puts me off slightly but the song is a whole banger and the chorus melody gets stuck in my head a lot

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): hoedown throwdown sounds really different to how i remember it

#I am sad

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's an interesting direction but it's not something I would return to

**plastichaxan** (6.8): this was almost good

**astrologicalangel** (6.5): this song is legitimately sad, but the video is hysterical to me for some reason

**Leixander** (6): still not sure what people see in this

**vayyiqra** (6): I feel like we've heard this a billion times in rate reveals and that made me kind of sick of it and I was never that big on it anyway. Sorry not that into yeehaw ! Cool video though.

**waluigiest** (6): this song is begging to be country. The skeleton is there and if she unplugged it, it would have been a SERVE

**bbfan132** (5.5): doesn’t do anything for me but it isn’t bad - i also don’t care for the some of the lyrics

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): i don't give a shit LOL

**Hulnia** (1): Overplay has really got to me on this one, especially the hook.

**mudkip1** (1): halsey you are not shania twain, you will never be shania twain

#Yeehaw

**ImADudeDuh** (9): i predict at least 7 comments will say “yeehaw”

Well, after a day 1 slaughter and an against-the-odds domination of the top 5, Halsey just falls short of the top spot. I will be choosing to put the blame on John Mayer, since as per a lot of the comments his tacked-on voicemail that leads into Without Me was the reason for a slightly lowered score and I'm sure there were many non-commenters that felt similarly. I was a bit surprised that this ended up surpassing You should be sad, seeing as it wasn't even a single and didn't get a music video of any sort, but it just goes to show that Halsey THRIVES in pop-rock and this is what we need her to explore in her next album!

---

#11am

**letsallpoo** (11): https://i.imgur.com/Kmnfgv7.gif

**NotWith10000Men** (11): girls rock. But was the voicemail necessary??? I hate having to reach out of the shower to skip after the actual song is over, and without me isn't her best song by a longshot anyway

**thedoctordances1940** (11): First time I heard this song I absolutely despised it. I've come around a looooot on pop punk over the last year and now I absolutely love this song, following Halsey at her worst, we thankfully get her at her best.

**akanewasright** (10): I love how Without Me is apparently their “best song” when this completely mops the floor with it

**avg-vag** (10): the rest of the album should have had more of this

**CarlieScion** (10): John Mayer making points

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): :flabster:

**frogaranaman** (10): what is it with songs about hookups and the title “3am”

**juanolsen** (10): NOW THIS IS THE POP-ROCK I WAS LOOKING FOR

**ManofOranges** (10): Now you're calling 3 am, my head is spinning

**nootnoot781** (10): correct this is her best song

**pat-rickstar** (10): Songs called 3am usually bang and this is no exception

**relibee2** (10): am

**Roxieloxie** (10): i am blaming popheads user tiltcontrols for playing that levitating remix because it was so good

**shesdoingyoga** (10): Songs titled 3 AM and being my favorite on an album I otherwise don’t really care for, name a more iconic duo

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a whole bop but ever since i read someone saying it sounds like the end credits of a 2000s hilary duff song i can't unhear it

**timothy444** (10): This was Pop Punk before Machine Gun Kelly invented the genre

**wavingwolves** (10): as the pitchfork acclaim rate host i can say halsey outsold haim with this one and i'm not sorry

**savemeaseat143** (9.9): I wish she made more songs like this. It would be a ten if I didn’t have to hear John mayer’s voice

**TiltControls** (9.9): one of the most annoying outros ever and drops it from 11 potential to a 9.9 out of pure spite

**1998tweety** (9.5): this deserved to be a single and smash. would be a 10 but i gotta take off half a point for the outro

**starla\_** (9.8): underrated banger

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I wish Halsey would do more songs like this

**ImADudeDuh** (9.5): surprised with how good this was

**kirby31200** (9.5): This hits a very nostalgic 2000s pop rock note, and songs that evoke the music of my childhood just feels magic. I heard this song for the first time today, and I feel like I've known it all my life. Also between this, Matchbox Twenty, and HAIM, songs titled 3am are destined to be jams

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): I am once again asking Halsey to release a full on pop-rock album (-0.5 for the outro though, I wouldn't mind so much if the message was a separate track but it's kind of jarring when listening to this song outside the context of the album)

**AHSWeeknd** (9): I listened to this at 12:41pm so...

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): , shows that Halsey is capable of making pop-rock bangers

**Awkward\_King** (9): goes hard frfr

**mudkip1** (9): kinda reminds me of 21 pilots for some reason but i like it!!

**RandomHypnotica** (9): ITS 3AM AND YOU ARE CALLING, GO FUCK YOURSELF DON'T SAY YOUR SORRY

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's actually a slam dunk, why doesn't more of the album sound like this???

**waluigiest** (9): please pick up the fecking phoooone

**UselessTacooo** (8.7): this is what I expected from I HATE EVERYBODY. She’s pretty, fun, angry and relatable allay the same time.

**jaztinax** (8.5): i just know 13 year old me would eat this up

**CrimsonROSET** (8): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lE23G_p2eKM

**J\_Toe** (8): didn't like the first few seconds, but this is one of the better tracks on the album

**Stryxen** (8): halsey please sing normally this could be the biggest banger ever

**vayyiqra** (8): It is the 90s. I am a child, my brother and I are watching music videos on TV by angsty alt-rock singers. [Aside: Songs that are about the topic of "what if we're lonely and dependent on technology" always seem to hit for me I should make a playlist of them.]

**bbfan132** (7): this was fun!!!! i like it more than i did at first

**IIIHenryIII** (7): la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

**skargardin** (7): sheets won't recognize this as anything other than 3:00 AM and it's driving me to the edge of insanity!!!

#Did not pick up the phone

**runaway3212** (5): Never quite got the hype for this one

**Hulnia** (1): Yet another boring song, and it really doesn’t work as a sequel the previous song like it’s meant to.

#Fuck you John Mayer

**cremeebrulee** (10): an 11 if john mayer wasnt fucking on this

**jackisboredtoday** (10): ignore John Mayer and this is the realest song in this rate

**rickikardashian** (10): shut the fuck up john mayer i hate you

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): It’s THE SMASHA!!! I do not perceive John Mayer though.

**fallenriot** (9): sick pop-rock song, would be a perfect 10 if not for that voicemail outro

**static\_int\_husp** (9): had to knock off a point for the overly long Jxhn Mxyer voicemail outro

**throwaway7650** (9): this song and its lyrics are good but the outro is not necessary

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): what IHE wants to be, also John Mayer sounds so passive aggressive here jeez

**musical\_pyn** (8): one of my favorite memories was putting my liked songs on shuffle and "Dear John" coming on right after this

Well, here you have it! The winner of the 2020 Break-Up Pop/Rock Rate. Unexpected? No! Exciting? No! Deserved? Just about! To be honest I was rooting against this song the entire time because it's very much the least exciting result that could come out of this rate but at the end of the day, it is a really good song that, in my opinion at least, deserves to get the crown.

---

#Disco yass

**1998tweety** (11): whew now this is the moment. When the era started with this song, the bar was set HIGH.

**J\_Toe** (11): Honestly Edge of Midnight is a 12/10 so I understand it being left off. Would have won way too easily, but I still would have loved to see it. I really really hope Midnight Sky wins though! The disco meets arena pop sound of this track is so amazing, and the music video is both super gay and super evocative of Miley's idols like Debbie Harry, Joan Jett, and of course Stevie Nicks!

**jaztinax** (11): i don’t care what numbers she pulled or didn’t pull in with this song, this will go down as THE greatest miley song

**kirby31200** (11): Probably too obvious of an 11 pick

**ManofOranges** (11): It's an obvious 11 choice, sure, but honestly there's really no other song in this rate that is as good as this one. The only song off of any of these three albums that could have a chance at getting my 11 other than this is Edge of Midnight because honestly I find it superior to this one, but it's not here so I'll simply have to settle for this still very good song.

**midnight\_thief** (11): her best song–makes me want to ride alone on a motorcycle at sunset

**mudkip1** (11): bop!

**rickikardashian** (11): gale is a war criminal

**shesdoingyoga** (11): Although compared to the rest of the album, this one doesn’t quite fit in sonically, it is still one of my favorites and it earns my 11 for the relative impact it had.  Literally everyone I know who follows music somewhat closely was talking about how much they love this song, and after the various issues and controversy with earlier parts of Miley’s career it was nice to see a song that everyone pretty much liked

**AHSWeeknd** (10): AN ANTHEM, and that sudden change of lyrics during the final chorus. Fully a discography highlight.

**CarlieScion** (10): this could very well win this methinks

**CritneySpearz** (10): a fuckin bop.  I thought this song would have Blinding Lights level of success when I first heard it lmao (still did well but I'm delusional)

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This is easily Miley's best lead single to date. This felt like a reinvention of Miley even though we already familiar with her persona.

**juanolsen** (10): one of the best songs of the past year, everything about it it's great from production to lyrics to vocal performance

**ktajlili** (10): Honestly, my favorite Miley song.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before

**NotWith10000Men** (10): the verses slap, the chorus slaps, the bridge SLAPS

**Ok\_Ant5217** (10): hot take: she does 80s more justice than Dua

**pat-rickstar** (10): Definitely the right choice for a lead single, it feels like the centrepiece of the album

**plastichaxan** (10): i get excited with every miley era so this naturally is a 10 to me

**runaway3212** (10): Such a great song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): the midnight sky is where I’m ascending when I hear this smash!!!

**seanderlust** (10): you know what this is a bi/pan banger and i appreciate miley for making that. plus the vibes are impeccable. easy 10

**skargardin** (10): i love disco

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my very strong 11 contender. out of all the songs in this rate i have listened to this one the most and consider it the perfect pop song for miley as it still has some grit. only reason i didn't vote is i thought it needed some competition but i'll be happy if it wins

**throwaway7650** (10): can't not give this a 10 even if it's a boring but deserving winner. stream edge of midnight too (would be my 11 if it was in the rate)

**timothy444** (10): One of the most underrated pop songs of 2020

**vayyiqra** (10): Yes this is just "In the Air Tonight" sped up; yes it is also the best song on the album

**ignitethephoenix** (9.9): maybe it’s the single bias of it but this song is still excellent to me even if it shrunk a bit when the album came out

**nootnoot781** (9.9): this absolutely does not deserve to win, but i can’t rate it any lower because then i would be lying :/

**zagreux** (9.9): This was the song that revived my interest in Miley. It might be a Stevie Nicks/Bruce Springsteen ripoff but it's a fantastic ripoff nonetheless.

**outsideeyess** (9.5): Edge of Midnight outsold

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): Anybody who doesn't give this a great score is lying to themselves.

**starla\_** (9.4): amazing, but tbh i prefer the Stevie Nicks mashup version

**celladonn** (9): Obviously great but Edge Of Midnight outsold

**CrimsonROSET** (9): is this that ashley o chick

**fallenriot** (9): this would be a ten but i overplayed it so much last year that i usually skip it now

**ReallyCreative** (9): This song kinda sticks out in this album a bit? It's a smash for sure

**savemeaseat143** (9): dope bass

**UselessTacooo** (9): Shes fun and deserves to be the hit that she was, but I feel like it’s very overrated. It’s very catchy and memorable but it is definitely not the best song on the album like many people say

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): it would’ve been a point higher if the Stevie duet version were being rated but alas…

**TiltControls** (8.5): hard going back to this when the edge of midnight version exists.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a good lead single to reintroduce herself.

**cremeebrulee** (8): won’t hate it if this wins, because this is probably the best song she’s put out in a while (slide away is boring, dont @ me). i just wish it got more traction, but i’m glad the sub gave it the praise it deserved

**frogaranaman** (8): I think it’s neat

**LuisEnRod** (8): wasn’t a fan originally but I grew on me a lot!

**waluigiest** (8): I love this song because it’s deliciously about nothing

**Stryxen** (7.9): haha mid night sky (but it’s actually good)

**relibee2** (7.7): a bit overrated but still good

#They tried

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): It sounds so luxurious and expensive yet it is such a weak song.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its a song (allegedly)

**bbfan132** (6): this feels like synthpop on autopilot, but that’s not a horrible thing

**Roxieloxie** (5.5): its better than the past 5 songs on this album but its still just ,,, meh

**akanewasright** (5.1): I’m of two minds about this song. On one hand, I do think it’s really a solid track, and one with really fun lyrics, actually. “See his hands round my waist” after the line in the first two choruses feels almost triumphant. Unfortunately, the track has grow off me a lot, partially because I think it’s missing something sonically. The mashup helped this a lot, actually, but even still there’s something a wee bit off. So yeah. I’m mixed on this one.

**Awkward\_King** (4): i really like the intro to this song but then it kinda doesnt go anywhere for me? the chorus feels really low energy but i dont know if my expectations are just too high, miley does sound pretty on it though

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): I loved this back when it came out as a single and thought to myself "wow, I finally **love** a Miley song, I can't wait to see what she does next" and then the album came out and this song just FLATLINED.. I remember struggling to get through the album, hoping that *at least Midnight Sky would redeem this slog, right*... and it did not. I don't understand what I actually used to like about this. Its mediocrity hurts too much, there are way better (remnants of) songs on this messy album that will go out before this.

**wavingwolves** (1): having a ''i'm not like the other girls'' moment

hikkaru: # Petals for Armor

---

**Overall Average**: 7.638 **// Average Controversy:** 1.793

---

 I would die for Hayley and Paramore has quite possibly the most consistent discography out of any artist/band I've ever listened to, so I'm incredibly thankful that we got a chance to rate this. I was honestly a tad worried that she'd flop even more but the album average is pretty good and, despite being the first out, she still got a song in the top 5 and didn't get entirely demolished at all. I really like this album and it was cool to see her toy with some different styles than what is the usual for Paramore. I'm sure the next record with the band will be stellar as usual so I'm beyond perched for that.

---
**Stryxen** (9.393): mediocre radiohead worship my ass this is hayley perfectly capturing her personally unique worldview and the way she copes and deals with emotions - one of the most interesting albums i listened to last year while remaining unapologetically pop and accessible

**waluigiest** (9.333): In my top 3 albums of 2020. This albums paints 3 beautiful landscapes of emotions: heartbreak, depression, rage, lust, optimism. It suffered from an awkward rollout but as an entire package, it works extremely well. I love this record. Stream Sugar on the Rim.

**fallenriot** (9.200): Despite the somewhat awkward rollout, this is one of my favorite albums of 2020.  A lot of the tracks are growers so I won’t be surprised if it gets a low average score, but in my own humble opinion this is a masterpiece from Ms. Williams.

**throwaway7650** (9.033): PFA was a major grower for me. I loved simmer when it released so I was already anticipating what hayley was going to release next. I liked PFA on release but didn't revisit it much, but as I returned to the album each time I liked certain songs more and more. now, I'm giving all but 2 songs on the album 8+ scores and my 11 to hayley (s11mmer). I sincerely hope she doesn't get done dirty in this rate and still has a decent amount of songs left day 3. stream FLOWERS for VASES / descansos too!

**wavingwolves** (9.007): pogger

**Leixander** (9.000): if you see this as a paramore-adjacent album, you're wrong. in this essay i will-

**Hulnia** (8.933): What an amazing solo debut, especially in terms of production.

**relibee2** (8.627): I actually think this was my favorite album of this rate which is kind of a surprise lol

**plastichaxan** (8.600): I have to admit a lot of this album was a grower, but I enjoy it so much more now, clearly my favorite of the 3 and with the most stand out tracks, I don't know how I didn't see it before

**kirby31200** (8.500): By far the most interesting sounding and written album of the rate

**skargardin** (8.400): The storytelling is phenomenal and it feels very intimate in a good way.

**starla\_** (8.347): Album average 8.3, I'd never listened to the album beyond Simmer and Rose/Lotus/Violet/Iris until now (even though I loved those songs from first listen!). I have never particularly liked Paramore, and Hayley Williams' public persona always grated on me. This album is like a breath of fresh air, it's light where a lot of Paramore's stuff feels very heavy, and I'm kicking myself for not listening sooner! My favourite of the three albums by far.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.267): this was one of my favourite albums last year, and I still really enjoy the album. It's very different to what we're used to hearing from Hayley, and as much as I love pmore it's good to hear her try delving into different sounds.

**Awkward\_King** (8.200): in scoring and relistining to this as an album i've realised its quite a neat track of our gradual descent into lockdown for me. i remember playing simmer obsessively on the bus at like 6am on the way to school when it was still pitch black outside when it was newly out, when we could still get busses. then i remember at the beginning of lockdown blasting over yet and dead horse around the house while i played wii sports and meandered round. and then i remember playing taken and pure love loads at the beginning of the summer when i went through a little depression patch and they honestly helped so much. in that way, i guess releasing it as three separate ep's was pretty fucking rad.

**seanderlust** (8.200): While the other two albums here were hit or miss, P4A is the one I feel is the most consistently good. I remember it being jarring on first listen since I was so used to Paramore stylings, but Hayley really found a way to dig (pun half-intended) into the depths of herself to surface something really vulnerable and remarkable. I personally love when Hayley uses her lower register and she does that a lot here. I thought it was interesting, given the heavy subject matter, she seems to take pretty upbeat instrumentals and lyrics at times. I guess you could say- For A Pessimist, She's Pretty Optimistic.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.167): I was worried I wouldn't like this album since this is so different from what Paramore makes. Wow, I was so wrong because I enjoyed this album a lot. Hayley did a great job making this album feel different from what Paramore usually makes. I also love he concept of the album as Hayley finds the beauty in feminity.

**bluetriangles04** (8.133): Hayley going solo spawned a handful of expectations that were either met easily, or held drowning underwater due to her reputation as a frontwoman previously. For me I found that her album was a beautiful showcase of how she had grown as a person, who she was as an artist outside of Paramore and the emotional turmoil that she had experienced post divorce. I definitely found PFAII more personally enjoyable than the first though as they were released, and with the full album the 3rd portion of it really shined in comparison to the first as well.

**vayyiqra** (8.133): This album is very good !

**zagreux** (8.100): I absolutely adore *Petals for Armour*'s concept of healing through your feminity. Two-thirds of this record is absolutely great and perfectly explores the process of regrowth. I know it can seem sonically boring at points but the lyrics are mostly on point ~~or maybe it's just because I relate to a lot of it idk~~. The third disc, though, is a significant drop in quality. IMO, the album should have been trimmed down to tracks 1-6 + tracks 8-10 + *Sugar on the Rim* and *Crystal Clear* to provide a more cohesive experience.

**musical\_pyn** (8.000): This album kept surprising me when I first listened to it. It's a nice departure from Hayley's stuff with Paramore with some extremely stand out tracks.

**TiltControls** (7.933): the only album I went into not hearing much beforehand, but I really enjoyed it! Nothing stood out as being bad and there were some great discoveries too!

**jaztinax** (7.893): hayley really used this project to say everything she had on her chest and more and i absolutely love it. it saddens me that i've seen negative opinions for it because i can feel hayley pouring her life into this. it does have some skips, ngl, but overall it seems like a cohesive album and a project worth being proud over. it really shows that this is the debut solo album of an artist who's already mastered her craft prior to this.

**AHSWeeknd** (7.867): I really enjoyed this album, it’s not as “indie” as I thought it’d be. We will keep streaming!

**pat-rickstar** (7.727): Basically the same as my comment for Manic, there's some excellent songs on here but I don't love the album as a whole

**ElizabethDDoS** (7.600): Well made, but somewhat uneventful. I don't fully get the "cult-lite" following this back-loaded album got after its release, but it's an enjoyable listen, all things considered.

**bigbigbee** (7.133): It’s weird. I think that this is the “best” album of the three but it had my lowest average because the other albums were just more my style. To its credit - it’s very artsy, very high class pop, consistent, well made, and with an interesting concept!

hikkaru: **ReallyCreative** (6.907): There's a great album in here somewhere, but there's so much clutter that it's hard to stay attentive

**IIIHenryIII** (6.873): I love Hayley, I really do, but this album is not what I expected from her. The song's lyrics are undeniably good. My only complaint is about the production. I hate the fact that most of these songs sound bland together. None of them are actively bad, some are just kinda forgettable because they are missing something, at least for me. It has grown on me since my first listen, though. Now “Flower For Vases / DESCANSOS”... that’s what I expected from her. That album is just perfect! I really hope we do a rate with this one, “evermore” by Taylor, and the upcoming Lana album (or another one which fits in the category), you know? Short time between recent album releases.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.813): this album wasn't as boring as i remembered it being, considering i actually made it all the way through this time (barely), but outside of like 4/15 songs it's nothing to write home about

**timothy444** (6.700): Despite the beautiful metaphors and similes about flowers spread out towards the album, Hayley's solo venture into indie rock is unfortunately really bland in comparison to her pop-punk roots. That's not to say that it's all a negative experience; the lyricism displays more maturity than her previous work, filled with a melancholy, slightly agitated, vibe.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.700): When this album was originally released I somehow managed to convinve myself that I loved the album and thought it was really good. It isn't. It's decent, I definitely don't dislike it, especially parts 2 and 3 have some really good songs, but part 1 really isn't very good and definitely pulls down the album as a whole. There also just isn't a track I absolutely adore on here and if I ever wanted to listen to only one track from this rate, this is the last place I'd look.

**ManofOranges** (6.667): Of the three ladies in this rate, Hayley is the one that I was least familiar with. I didn't listen to a lot of Paramore when I was younger, and I wasn't really sure what to expect, if this would even sound like I what Paramore songs I had heard, etc. etc. Long story short, I really didn't jibe with this. To Hayley's credit, I think she's created some kind of sound that is somewhat unique, but all that means is that this album to me is uniquely boring. It's got its few shining moments, but to me, overall, it's the weakest album here.

**ImADudeDuh** (6.333): I had to delay rating this album cause i was too tired one night and after listening to it, I made the right decision

**ktajlili** (6.067): Most disappointing 2020. I think it starts off strong, but it kind of falls apart in the middle for me. The happy songs sound so forced and inauthentic; the tracks don't really flow into each other well. "After Laughter" was so good because it explores the sadness and anger through an ironic sound, while this never really develops a sonic identity and I think tries to cover too much ground. I still appreciate this album for allowing Haley to explore her emotions and heal though.

**letsallpoo** (5.600): I cried, i screamed, i laughed, i fell down, i got up, i struggled, i fought, i lost, i felt like there was no poin in trying, i gave up, i contemplated ending the journey then & there, i somehow still hung on, i lived the last days like a plastic bag just floating through the tumultuous sea hoping to wash up on whatever peaceful island i could find, but oh my god... i am fucking finally done listening to Hayley Williams' album for the break up pop rock rate. Alexa... play *I Am Free* by Mariah Carey

**Brendon-Urine** (5.533): very cold on this album. Most songs are either some shade of boring or annoying, with only a couple standouts. I think she did a much better job on flowers for vases / descansos.

**prettybunbun** (5.333): Honestly this album makes me mad. Had some absolute bangers but for me the album is quite weak. Hayley shines at parts but for me it’s not a constant so I’m not a huge fan and was disappointed when it came out.

**NapsAndNetflix** (4.033): this is just her cosplaying as alanis morissette but not good

hikkaru: # Plastic Hearts

---

**Overall Average**: 7.707 **// Average Controversy:** 1.948

---

 I would say I prefer Manic and PFA to this but that's not to say that I dislike Plastic Hearts at all. I feel like the ballads in the latter half falter a little but when Miley hits she HITS, with the bangers (pun intended) being among my favourite songs from 2020. It finally feels like she has some authenticity in her work and it shines because of that - and this reflected in the rate results where she gets the highest album average as well as the win!

---
**AHSWeeknd** (10.071): Prior to Plastic Hearts I always wanted a pop girl to do a rock album, and finding out Miley was doing one was the best news ever. I never expected to like it so much, from Midnight Sky to that Super Bowl tiktok concert, I’ve loved this era. Miley nails this aesthetic, both the look and the sound. Beyond that, each song speaks volumes on the nature of being free after a major relationship, I can’t relate, I’ve personally never mourned a relationship. But I admire such gritty songwriting, each song presents different sorts of passionate emotion when it comes to moving on. Love this one! Vinyl release when bestie.

**throwaway7650** (9.393): this was an album I was very hyped for last year. I liked all of the singles (including the excellent edge of midnight remix ft. stevie nicks) and seeing it receive general acclaim from popheads and the broader music community at large was great to witness. are my scores for this album inflated? probably, but I genuinely enjoy all the tracks on this, including *all* of the ballads. I'm so excited to see what miley does next

**rickikardashian** (9.214): gale is a war criminal

**Hulnia** (9.071): This era was robbed so hard

**jaztinax** (8.993): as someone who fell in love with pop/rock miley and have a special place in my heart for that kind of music, this is truly all i could ask from miley cyrus in 2020. the grit she's always had in her voice has found its purpose and the collabs of her dreams have come true in this album, so i assume it's all miley herself could've asked for. if she wasn't already such a pop culture phenomenon and icon before this, i believe this album would've made a bigger mark. regardless, plastic hearts will go down as one of the--if not the--greatest piece of miley cyrus' discography.

**relibee2** (8.764): this album also should’ve been longer

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.750): Miley served an evolved version of the pop-rock niche she occupied in her Breakout days, bridging different decades into a throwback sound that was perfect for 2020’s nostalgia obsession. She owns her imperfections in a refreshingly candid way, and channels the devil-may-care confidence of classic rockers with her powerful rough-edged vocals. The material is solid, if a little repetitive and 2-dimensional by the end. There’s only so far that "I'm a scoundrel and will break your heart" goes as self-reflection, and there’s only so far that "born in the wrong era" carries an artistic identity. However, Miley infuses the songs with enough emotion and heart to make up for that, and keeps a good balance between baring her soul and putting on a show. Whether she reinvents herself again or keeps refining her rock sound, I look forward to Miley’s next step.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.643): Miley has some kind of trouble in making a consistent discography. But her brutal honesty that complements the pop-rock production made this album her most genuine effort yet.

**kirby31200** (8.536): This album is consistently good and fun all the way through, but not very inventive or particularly interesting. But this album gets extra points all the way around for being my mother's favorite album in years. She ran this on repeat for months and it was really quite nice to have my pop interests intersect with my mother's music taste

**NotWith10000Men** (8.507): turns out i was way higher on this album than i thought. two fantastic covers, great features, and nothing below a 7 will do that i guess

**fallenriot** (8.429): Miley’s career is so interesting to follow with the constant genre switch-ups and later disownment of each album, but I hope she stays in this vein at least for another album or two.  While I love her other albums too this feels like Miley at her most open and authentic, taking Dead Petz’s spot as my favorite album of hers.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.857): I've never really been into Miley before this era, so I was really surprised by how much I enjoyed this album! It is a *bit* top-heavy but there's enough bangers to make up for it

**J\_Toe** (7.857): the sounds of this album are so diverse and yet so cohesive, thanks to Miley's lyrical cohesion, artistic vision, and distinctive voice. The album is parts disco, punk, new wave, power pop, and arena rock, and it's so great to see Miley stand up as our generation's Stevie Nicks, Pat Benatar, Joan Jett, and Debbie Harry.

**zagreux** (7.836): Even though the best song on this album is a cover (Z11bie supremacy) most of the songs are good, which is more than what can be said of other Miley albums. The songwriting can be weak at points but her energy makes up for it. I hope she continues with this sound but makes it more rock instead of pop in a similar vein as 90s Hole/Courtney Love.

**pat-rickstar** (7.771): Probably the most consistently good album in the rate for me, there's not a lot of songs I dislike here

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7.714): I was nervous to Listen to this album because I do not like Miley as much as many in the sub and some other the other rock recommendations here have bored me to tears and I thought were terrible. But this was very nice :) made me glad I did the rate.

**plastichaxan** (7.650): I'm a Miley fan more than the other girlies this rate, I've liked everything she's done I like dead petz and all so I was excited for a new era, and I applaud her changing her sound every time, there are a few... choices here but all in all it's a pretty solid album

**waluigiest** (7.643): I listened to this album obsessively for a week and then stopped

**TiltControls** (7.643): a very solid album, albiet with a few weak points. Still, I really like this direction from Miley (now the question is if she feels the same when the next album releases)

**ktajlili** (7.571): TGL, I never liked Miley's music that much. After forcing an image that felt so try-hard and cringe, her attempts to be a wholesome country girl again felt so off. However, I have a lot more respect for Miley after this era. It feels like she's finally found herself, and I love how she is embracing 80s rock. She has so much vocal talent, and this style of singing really shows it off! And overall, the album is pretty good!! I do wish she had left out some of the country cuts and went full rock, but I still think this is a pretty enjoyable album.

**musical\_pyn** (7.500): I wasn't as hyed about Miley's rock-turn, but there are some stand out tracks here! Especially if pop-punk really does come back I think she can stay in this lane for a while.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.464): It's pretty consistently good, rarely better, rarely worse. All I hope is that Miley continues in this direction because it suits her so well.

**bigbigbee** (7.429): I have some issues with Miley’s career and so I regret that I ended up liking this album the most. The rock sound really suits her, and even the songs on this that I don’t love, I find extremely easy to listen to. It’s a clear nostalgia play (1969?) but I guess I’m a nostalgic person.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.393): The back half is such a letdown. The album starts so strong but doesn't live up to its hype. Still, I love this direction Miley is taking. I hope she sticks with this sound for a while.

**skargardin** (7.357): This is the direction Miley should take with her music I feel like, by far her strongest overall album ever I think.

**ManofOranges** (7.214): This album is actually one of the few albums that I actually listened to upon its release. Normally I would have to be coerced or just wait a really long time in order to listen to album straight out the gate but this one was different. I was pretty impressed by Midnight Sky and I had high hopes that Miley would actually put something out that would be of decent quality, so I gave it a listen on release. I remember when I listened to it back when it came out that I was impressed by a handful of songs, and pretty underwhelmed by the others. The songs to me weren't really in the middle, either they were good or they weren't. And that has by-and-large remained the same. I still like the same songs that I did when this album first came out, some I've even come to appreciate even more, but the songs that I didn't like I still don't. Overall, the album is pretty hit or miss, I guess.

**seanderlust** (7.043): Miley has never fully clicked with me to be honest. I feel like with this record, we are getting there but not quite. There are certainly high high points - Midnight Sky, Give Me What I Want, the Billy Idol feature - but there are also low points. I love that she's leaning into an '80s rock pastiche and her voice does sound very good with that backing. Miley, just throwing this out there- if you want to go full 70s Sex Pistols-style punk for your next record, I promise to make one of those annoying stan Twitter accounts telling everyone to stream it.

hikkaru: 
**timothy444** (6.929): Music in 2020 was obviously worse than other years because of the COVID pandemic but it also led some artists to pursue a different genre-bending direction to mixed success (Taylor Swift and Machine Gun Kelly come to mind). However, Miley's take of 80s pop rock goodness proves just how much talent she has in her vocals and lyrical mastery. Unfortunately, there is wasted potential with a couple of duds (especially with the covers) thrown in.

**prettybunbun** (6.929): Enjoyed this, was sad the role out was cut short and I just scream that Prisoner didn’t get more promo, it was a bop.

**Leixander** (6.929): she tries so hard to be genuine but rarely succeeds in doing that other than a few tracks here. i'd love to hear her create her own sound as i think it'd be very interesting to hear

**ReallyCreative** (6.836): This album is perfectly fine, but it feels like it comes up short of its potential. It's a fitting title because there's a plasticness to some of these tracks that just doesn't quite feel right, but it's tough to pin down. Still, ultimately a lot of fun songs on this one

**starla\_** (6.486): Album average 6.5, the shitty covers brought down the average score. I really like this album as a whole, and there's less filler than on Manic.

**bluetriangles04** (6.321): I'm unsure what I was really expecting diving in, with Prisoner and the Heart of Glass cover being the only tracks I had listened to beforehand. I feel as though while this album brought some enjoyable tracks, the consistency moved around too much for me overall in a lot of different directions.

**Stryxen** (6.171): has some very good moments but overall slightly underwhelming. her covers are so fun tho

**ElizabethDDoS** (5.500): The youngest legacy act of all time.

**Awkward\_King** (5.357): the funny thing is i wouldn't even say i dislike this album? like i think about half the songs are nice enough and i would put on, most of it just doesnt grab me in any way and i kind of think miley went halfway with it and it all could've been done further?? or perhaps i just have a different vision to what miley wanted to make with this album?? which is also fine, just clearly its not quite my taste haha

**vayyiqra** (5.214): Oh no ! This album is not very good !

**wavingwolves** (4.679): not very pog as hikk would say

hikkaru: # Manic

---

**Overall Average**: 7.365 **// Average Controversy:** 1.968

---

 Well, Halsey took a bit of a beating this rate... but that was obviously exacerbated by the fact that she had the most tracks out of everyone. She still managed to get 3 of the top 5 which is pretty impressive but unfortunately no one song was able to pull through. This is definitely my favourite album from her even despite the disappointment of it not going the Nightmare route, and I look forward to what H4 will bring forth (hopefully soon!)

---
**relibee2** (8.710): this album should’ve been longer

**TiltControls** (8.620): I was never much of a fan of Halsey's previous work before Manic. I'm pretty sure the last rate I did with her (HFK) I tore her apart. But this album is fantastic! I feel like I got her music more after this album and was much more receptive to her earlier work.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8.600): As much as I love Halsey's ambitious concepts in Badlands and hopeless fountain kingdom, it's nice to see Halsey adopt a more low-key concept in this album that feels more close to her as a person. I can't believe I identify with a lot of songs here, which made me enjoy this album a lot more than I expected.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8.600): I regret sleeping on this back when it came out. Brilliant album.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.550): That cover could’ve been better. Halsey always has good cover art but this one ain’t it.

**timothy444** (8.350): MANIC is an album that manages to invoke some profound emotions in listeners, and certainly from the point of view of her real life persona Ashley, we get to understand just where she's coming from. It's messy and angsty but Halsey does it in such a way that it feels personal, like we're ripping out pages from her diary.

**fallenriot** (8.300): I was not a Halsey fan before this album, but I’m so glad I decided to listen to it when it came out.  While I’ve listened to and loved her whole discography at this point, this is definitely her strongest work and shows how much strength and versatility she has as an artist.

**skargardin** (8.250): I listened to this a lot when it released and all but dropped it a month later for reasons unknown even to me. A lot of the album has grown off me but there are some absolute standout moments.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.100): Reading through the tracklist is weird bc I can't think of half the melodies until the song starts and then I'm like 'oh hell yeah I love this one' but why can't I remember it?? I guess that's kind of an insult to the album but it was in my top five of 2020 so i guess it doesn't bother me

**seanderlust** (7.710): as someone who really liked Badlands but hasn't had the chance to dive into any of her later work, I was really happy to do a deep dive on Manic for this rate! overall, I quite like this record. Like Badlands, the instrumentals are impeccable, and also like Badlands, the lyrics wobble from insightful and cutting to cringey. Overall, I definitely see myself re-visiting this one.

**prettybunbun** (7.700): Loved this album, would have been perfect with Nightmare on it. Deffo want Halsey to do more pop rock, and I think I put this in my top 5 AOTY, feels like a great listening experience.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.575): I feel as though this will probably be the lowest album, at least in my own rating, but I think there are some great tracks on here, and I think it's a strong effort from Halsey! The interludes and bonus tracks don't really do much for me, which unfortunately does drag the rating down a bit, but some of Halsey's best work is on here, and I'm very much looking forward to hearing what she does next.

**throwaway7650** (7.500): coming into the rate halsey's album was the one I was most scared to rate because I thought I would have a hard time listening to it. I bopped to new americana in like 2015 but I remember not being terribly enthused by manic's singles and didn't listen to it before doing this rate. after relistening to the singles, I thought I would struggle through the album due to not enjoying halsey's vocals on them very much and knowing that her lyrical style is hit-or-miss. although I did have issues with manic lyrically (it being the reason I gave one of the songs a 0; hint: target), I was able to surprisingly tolerate her vocals for the most part. I also liked manic more than I thought I would and although this isn't an album I would really listen to on my own, I think this is a good album to get to know halsey as a person and artist. congrats halsey on the successful pregnancy btw! sending love to her

**ManofOranges** (7.400): I've never been that big of a fan of Halsey. Her music just never really clicked with me ever, mainly because I've never found it to be that good. This album has proven to me that maybe I should actually give Halsey a chance. There's a decent amount of songs on here that I find really enjoyable, and that amount is a lot higher than I was initially expecting. There's also a fair amount of duds on here too to be fair, but I wouldn't really say there are any songs on here except for maybe one or two that I would call downright bad to me. Overall, it was a pleasant surprise to me.

**musical\_pyn** (7.400): I remember not liking this when I first listened, but on revisit I actually like it! A little bloated, but a lot of the tracks in here are either really catchy or really touching.

**waluigiest** (7.400): I’ve never been a big Halsey fan but a lot of this album works. And even on the songs that kind of flop, there are good elements.

**Leixander** (7.400): least favorite halsey album, still not bad

**wavingwolves** (7.390): pog

**bluetriangles04** (7.200): overall a body of work that while I feel is far from Halsey's best, is a good showcase of the growth she has made as an artist by dabbling into other genres and playing with new techniques, something that wasn't really seen in her debut album for example. Still is personally last place for me in comparison to her other albums.

**vayyiqra** (7.200): This album has grown on me a lot with time ! It may be her best yet !

**letsallpoo** (7.150): is it too late to demand that boy with luv also be included

**pat-rickstar** (7.135): I feel similarly about this album and PFA, both have a few standouts that I love, but also a lot of filler and songs I just don't care about. I don't think the length helps either as songs just start to blend together after a while

**starla\_** (7.115): Album average 7.1, i had never listened to this album all the way through and it wasn't as good as I expected given how much I love (most) of the singles. I thought this would be my clear favourite of the three but I think it's actually my least favourite??

**kirby31200** (7.050): It's fine. When the lyrics are interesting, they are often accompanied by average instrumentals.
[/r/popheads/comments/o925mv/2020_breakup_poprock_rate_reveal_day_3_it_aint/h3918s8/]

=====

hikkaru: 
**Brendon-Urine** (6.850): I think the first half is much better than the second half and is a lot more distinct, but still overall not a bad album. Always cool to see an artist as big as Halsey have interludes and go for some album flow, even if it doesn’t come out perfect

**Stryxen** (6.730): this is my favourite halsey album

**ktajlili** (6.700): I think there are several tracks that show promise, but I found the album to be underdeveloped. Most of the tracks have a cool vibe to them, but rarely are they developed into fully fleshed out songs, with the exception of "You Should Be Sad" and "3AM." I also find it interesting that several of the album's "features" are on track interludes. I think Halsey emotes well and has strong feelings, but a lot of the album kind of circles around the same themes of self-destruction and failed relationships without adding much depth. There is a lot to admire here, but this is simple for my taste.

**zagreux** (6.500): I've never really cared much for Halsey either as a person or an artist and had written her off as a pretentious Lorde ripoff. I liked some of the singles from *Manic* though and was excited to be proven wrong. Spoiler alert: I wasn't. This album reeks of mediocrity and is overrun with faux-deep lyrics and poor production choices. There are some good moments here, but even the best of them can’t help Halsey get out of her own way. The lyrics can be insufferable at points and the randomly scattered voice memos don't help. Songs like *You Should Be Sad*, *3 AM*, *Nightmare*, and *Graveyard*, however, are steps in the right direction. At the risk of the basement I run out of collapsing, I think I'll have to go with Pitchfork on this one.

**IIIHenryIII** (6.440): I really, really, really hate the visuals of this album. I convinced myself that is the main reason I don't like it more than I wanted to. I also hate some of the sound choices on most of the tracks, especially on clementine and Graveyard. I wish she didn't use those "artsy" sounds. It just makes me cringe and slightly disgusted. To put it simply, I don’t like the vibe I get from this album.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.350): It's just oh so wildly inconsistent. At her best there's nobody like her, at her worst, well let's just say I'd rather not hear a lot of that stuff ever again.

**plastichaxan** (6.150): I was scared I’d really dislike this cause my first listen from when it released, I had it rated a 6 and didn’t come back to it, and well, the average is the same, but now some tracks stood out more at least, Nightmare still washes the whole album which says a lot about it, but I’m glad I discovered it wasn’t all meh

**J\_Toe** (6.000): the album is certainly longer than I anticipated 😫

**Awkward\_King** (5.700): this is going to sound passive aggressive considering how low my score is but i really didnt expect to like this album at all, but it actually has a fair few songs i really enjoyed!! however it has just as many songs i... really dont care for, it makes sense that halsey is one of those hit or miss artists for me but im happy i did the rate because ive found a few songs i really enjoy!! and will promptly forget the others because they arent for me and thats ok

**ReallyCreative** (5.610): This album was just not for me. There are some great songs on this record, but unfortunately those songs are the ones that feel most like they don't belong. Also Nightmare is very overrated why did y'all hype it up so much

**Hulnia** (2.600): Probably in my bottom 3 albums of 2020, with all the boring songs and the terrible hooks. :)

TiltControls: Another day, another amazing rate hosted by Hikk!!! I still don't know if I've fully recovered from the Night Crawling/Nightmare fakeout (and I definitely still haven't recovered from Halsey not winning)

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) like always!


##**Songs**

Well who would've guessed? ~~everybody probably~~. Anyways though it just misses the 9 point mark, **Midnight Sky** still ends up at a solid \#291 on the all time song leaderboard! Not enough for any of the other boards, but 10+ 11's is nothing to sneeze at.

Also **Without Me** joins the songs rated multiple times club, and picks up nearly a full point from its last outing (which I think was the BB Decade End Rate)

##**Artists**

**Miley** secures her 2nd win after Party in the USA from back in the day. She also boosts her average slightly from around 7.0 to just above 7.2.

**Halsey** comes so close to that rate win, but is unfortunately brought down by one (1) John Mayer. Still despite a rough showing day 1, she did quite well for day 3 (well until the end). Thanks to the rate she also finally raises her artist average above a 7.

**Hayley** (though not really a new artist) gets her own solo spot. With PFA and also the odd feature here and there from previous rates she lands at spot #102/261 with just over a 7.6 average.

Other random stats

* Halsey moves to #16 on the most songs rated list (with 61, she was previously stuck just off the leaderboard at #26)

* On the same list Miley goes from #23 to #19 (with 58 songs rated)

* Halsey moves up to /#2 for most 0's, passing Katy Perry (though she's still quite a ways off from one T. Swift)

* Halsey keeps her 2nd place spot for most songeniality wins with More, bringing her up to 4 total (More, Alone, Closer (x2)) putting her just 1 behind the current leader (again, T. Swift)

##**Rates**


Not much to say leaderboard-wise, though there was a surprisingly high % of songs with an 11 and % of songs with a 0 stat for an album rate. Looks like everyone had their own favourites (and least favourites)


##**Other**

**HEADS UP FOR ANYONE USING THE RATE TOOL**

With VGV there was a component in the tool that broke cause I filled the number of rows it allowed. If you want to fix it please redownload a copy from the wiki!
