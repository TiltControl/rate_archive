One of the most controversial songs in the rate, clementine makes use of shouty vocals throughout the song that seem to be either a love it or hate it sort of thing. This track took a bit to grow on me personally but now I like it quite a bit, however a lot of others do not agree. It spent basically the entire rating period at #49, despite getting an 11. I can't say I'm too surprised, I fear.

---

#OoOoOoOrange

**1998tweety** (10): ok this song is kind of a mess but when it hits it HITS, like one day i was laying in bed listening to this after a hard day and whew it clicked 100 percent

**mudkip1** (10): i can't remember where or when i've heard this before.. something about this works for me i love it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is really pretty but i don't have anything insightful to say, so i'll just say her brother is hot

**Roxieloxie** (10): this came on at 2:30am while i was lingering a little too long while looking at myself in the mirror while i was already feeling a bit self destructive so :grinny:

**TiltControls** (10): I DONT NEED ANYONE - the may hosts when tk asks who our cohosts are

**UselessTacooo** (10): I love this song so much. It surprised me so much because at the beginning I was weary of it. "i don't need anyone, i just need everyone and then some" has no right being this relatable. I feel like this song might be snubbed and that will suck but I hope it gets the recognition it deserves.

**cremeebrulee** (9): she is PANDERING to me i love eternal sunshine too much as a movie to not score this well

**jaztinax** (8.5): there‚Äôs something cinematic/movie soundtrack-ish about this song but i can‚Äôt point out what. i love the way the chorus is written too

**AHSWeeknd** (8): I didn‚Äôt vibe with this at first but it grew on me.

**akanewasright** (8): This is essentially the best version of ‚Äúindie girl‚Äù Halsey

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): cuz it's great

**vayyiqra** (8): Nobody cares but the first time I heard this album was when I was playing it on my college radio show and I was very tired and it was late on a cold winter night (almost -20Àö) and even though it's kind of sad this song feels like a lullaby somehow and always makes me think of that memory. This is overly specific and means little to you all but whatever it's a nice feeling

**waluigiest** (8): the screaming distorted background vocals are so uncanny

**zagreux** (7.8): This song is quite nice once you get past her extremely grating voice

**savemeaseat143** (7.7): better as a concept than a song

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i *definitely* disliked this the first time i heard it in beatsense but like... i like the melody of this i think??? like this annoys me but in a nice way

**endcreditouilles** (7.5): this would be so much higher of a score without the shouting in the chorus, idk why it's grating to me

**Leixander** (7.5): the chorus really drops the ball on this otherwise amazing song

**relibee2** (7.5): I don‚Äôt like oranges

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): drags on a little too long, which is the opposite problem of most of this album

**wavingwolves** (7.1): i like this song a lot more in the context of the album but it's still very much not great

**Brendon-Urine** (7): can‚Äôt decide if the background shouty vocals are really cool or really annoying

**CrimsonROSET** (7): I just remember this MV being interpretative dance in front of an aquarium

**jasannn** (7): I can't get over how "I dont need anyone" sounds like "spelling is fun!"

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): Has some beautiful lyrics but the instrumental sounds clunky and doesn‚Äôt quite land. I do think that uncomfortable, off-kilter tension is part of conveying the feeling of Clementine‚Äôs unstable headspace, so it‚Äôs not necessarily an artistic failure. I like how the Eternal Sunshine sample at the end of the last track sets this one up.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's cute

**timothy444** (7): Halsey attempting to try a Lana Del Rey style song sorta works but she's done better ballads.

**bbfan132** (6.5): nice enough but not super interesting

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): I just noticed her little hmphh before the first chorus, v cute. I like this song but the lullaby melody doesn't do enough for me and I'm not a fan of the back up vocals

**\_SoulGlitch** (6): fish

**J\_Toe** (6): I actually really like Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and can see how the movie inspired Halsey

#Annoying Orange

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): i feel like this song is very love it or hate it, and while I get how someone could totally love it it doesn‚Äôt quite click for me

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (6): I like this song lyrically but sonically it bores me. This as a single made me stressed for the album Ngl.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): I like the way she sang "I don't anyone" but that's pretty much it.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): talk about misleading advertising, this song isn't about oranges at all!

**throwaway7650** (6): cannot get into her throwing a tantrum (?) in the chorus

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): the video is cute but I hate the vocals on here at points, even if it‚Äôs on purpose

**starla\_** (5.3): this is ok, a little bananies and avocadies for me

**fallenriot** (5): this one is probably the worst offender when it comes to cursive singing, which she otherwise improved on a lot this album

**frogaranaman** (5): is that a toy piano

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I'm bored.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): probably my least favourite song on the album. i don't mind the verse's but i hate the chorus so 5 is fitting.

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): oranges outsold

**kirby31200** (4): This is not good.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (4): needs a new BG vocalist

**runaway3212** (4): I don't like this song

**rickikardashian** (3.5): i feel like if i asked any random NYU freshman to write a song to describe them, this is what they would make

**brenda\_official** (3): the yelling is annoying shhhh

**Stryxen** (3): if this was somewhere else in the album i could imagine it hitting different and me liking it but it‚Äôs boring and just sounds weird

**ImADudeDuh** (1): wow this was insanely annoying and yes its because of the backing vocals

**Hulnia** (0): Genuinely my least favourite song ever made. It drags on for so long, and it sounds like the lyrics were written by a 12 year old.

**pat-rickstar** (0): The vocals in the chorus are so grating to me,  and the lyrics and instrumental don't do enough to redeem this

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Sorry I can;t deal with the high pitched baby-like voice doubling in the chorus

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): that shouting in the chorus got old real fast huh

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this song has given me a pathological aversion to all citrus fruits

I never really expected this to do any better than it did, which is such a shame because the production here is so great through and through. I would personally have it quite a bit higher than where it placed here. Throwback to when she released this and this interlude only as a pre-release promo single to get those ARMY streams. Do the kpop boy group rate (but give BTS better scores than y'all did here pls Boy With Luv and Run are smashes)

---

#ARMY

**akanewasright** (10): This song is lovely and peaceful, and I just *know* that it‚Äôs going to be robbed ~~because xenophobia~~

**CarlieScion** (10): gorgeous, beautiful, stunning, etc etc etc

**grey** (10): wow a kpoppie giving a song with a kpop artist a high score groundbreaking and shocking

**timothy444** (10): How the hell did a BTS member manage to create an ultra serious song about the inner workings of the music industry, let alone on an fricken' interlude. Damn, genius move.

**wavingwolves** (10): do the kpop boygroup rate!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): Halsey makes some Quality Fucking Interludes. SUGA absolutely kills it here.

**throwaway7650** (9.5): the best interlude solely due to the fact that suga's voice not coming in weirdly. the lyrics, especially suga's verses, are great

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): this is WAY better than it has any right to be for an interlude

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): This sounds really lovely and relaxing. Maybe a weird comparison, but I‚Äôm getting T√©l√©popmusik - Angel Milk out of the combo of dreamy atmospheric instrumental + rapping

**jasannn** (8.5): Sounds more like a BTS track than a Halsey but I guess that's kinda the point.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): The way Suga wrote his verse almost feels like poetry.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): percht for the people who hate kpop no matter what to get mad at this

**musical\_pyn** (8): why are the interludes on this album so good???

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): better than Boy with Luv in every way, especially lyrics

**TiltControls** (8): do the BG rate!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): why does this sound like I‚Äôm in a jungle

**starla\_** (7.1): the second best interlude on this album

**1998tweety** (7): Suga def carries this track

**AHSWeeknd** (7): an interlude so soon after Alanis‚Äô Legendary Interlude was a choice.

**Awkward\_King** (7): do kpop bg DO KPOP BG RATE

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): Do Belb's and Gucci's rate due July 3rd.

**LuisEnRod** (7): when I listened to this album the least I expected was Suga to spit some bars, I would like it more if it was more upbeat

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): I like the rap and I like the beat, I like Halsey here. They don‚Äôt all fit together to me so this is less than the sum of its parts but it is fine

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's fine

#ABOLISH SALES

**savemeaseat143** (6.5): doesn‚Äôt do anything for me

**bbfan132** (6): nice production and halsey‚Äôs parts were pretty good‚Ä¶ suga felt like a non-presence here

**CrimsonROSET** (6): do the bg rate or something idk

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (6): I honestly find the idea of the three interludes more interesting the interludes themselves

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's cute but nothing special

**fallenriot** (5): tbh i completely forgot this song existed because i deleted it from my library after my first few listens, i think their vocals just do not mesh well together at all. his lyrics are pretty cool though

**frogaranaman** (5): they kinda work together

**juanolsen** (5): this is my least favorite out of the three interludes

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): probably my least favourite interlude on the album, I feel like Suga's rapping is a bit too fast/intense to work with the music, which is very relaxed and slow, it's a bit jarring?

**NotWith10000Men** (5): I like his lyrics, but his rapping doesn't fit the song for me, especially the first verse

**UselessTacooo** (5): there‚Äôs no denying that SUGA has talent, but it just entirely disrupts the flow in the worst way possible

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): I don't think I've ever heard a slow k-pop bg song I liked. I also don't like this.

**mudkip1** (4): i feel like i just listened to three subpar interludes one after another

**rickikardashian** (4): my poor meow meow...my baby my little baby who hurt so much but treats people with nothing but kindness forgive me for not being able to do more..i tried my best i really did..

**Stryxen** (4): meh

**runaway3212** (3): this sucks all the energy that we just got from killing boys

**aldwin\_is\_here** (2): not my type of songs

**IIIHenryIII** (1): The other interludes were too good to be true.

**plastichaxan** (1): sorry but this is something i actually dislike, i don't find anything i mildly enjoy about this or that makes me say "hmm, i can see why people like this"

Target bonus track number one, here we have something that sounds a bit unfinished and is, more than anything, unmemorable. I can't say I hate it (I mean I'm giving it a 6) but it's very easy to see why it's out early.

---

#Target Moms

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I just think that women <3 extended version when??

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I can‚Äôt explain why I like this so much. It‚Äôs twinkly.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): "i keep a pistol when i sleep inside my mouth" jesus fucking christ Ashley

**relibee2** (9.2): I was gonna give this like 2 points less but this actually kinda bangs

**AHSWeeknd** (9): would‚Äôve made an excellent ballad on the standard edition of the album.

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I love this.

**skargardin** (9): mf bop

**UselessTacooo** (9): The drum sounds in the background give this song so much enjoyability. I live for the little lullaby sounds.

**Awkward\_King** (8): im a defender of short songs but this one bangs why this gotta be so short ashley

**vayyiqra** (8): Nobody cares but the production on the drums here is GREAT (I play drums and notice this stuff so it's okay if you don't)

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): having a interlude as a bonus track is kind of a weird choice but ok

**runaway3212** (7.5): This is sweet

**Stryxen** (7.5): i‚Äôm surprised how good this is why can‚Äôt it be longa :/

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): a short and sweer song

**CarlieScion** (7): halseys soundcloud rapper era

**CrimsonROSET** (7): people will cry! normalize crying dammit!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Love to hear Halsey talking about her female love interests in her songs.

**fallenriot** (7): not bad but i can see why it was a reject

**shesdoingyoga** (7): Halsey I‚Äôm begging you please stop making songs short that would still work over 3 minutes

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): enjoyable song but i don't think it would add anything to the album so works well as a deluxe

#Sobbing

**juanolsen** (6.8): it's clear why this was a bonus track

**akanewasright** (6): A really sweet, pretty, incomplete song

**bbfan132** (6): it‚Äôs not bad but it feels like an interlude

**cremeebrulee** (6): feels half finished

**frogaranaman** (6): the instrumental is pretty

**ImADudeDuh** (6): i feel bad cause so much of this album was middling but idk thats the score i feel

**kirby31200** (6): "I keep a pistol when I sleep inside my mouth so I can shoot down all the bad things" what

**NotWith10000Men** (6): cute but definitely could have been expanded into a whole song

**throwaway7650** (6): this sounds like a nursery rhyme and not in a good way

**jasannn** (5): more like an interlude

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): bit of a mess, it's a shame but as with a lot of bonus tracks on albums it's pretty clear why this didn't make the original tracklist

**ManofOranges** (5): Wipe your tears for another day

**Ok\_Ant5217** (5): these beats aren't her forte

**wavingwolves** (5): this is fine but it definitely feels unfinished

**1998tweety** (3): yeah i can see why this was left off the standard version

**Brendon-Urine** (3): just sorta boring.

**Hulnia** (2): Why is this here, this doesn‚Äôt fit the ‚Äúconcept‚Äù of the album at all? Another boring one too, although this time it‚Äôs mainly from production as opposed to lyrics.

**timothy444** (2): I don't really know why but I don't like the way Halsey sounds in this. Just way too boring and mediocre to listen to.

ReallyCreative: I know she has the most songs but there are enough mediocre songs from each album that there's no need for 3 Halsey songs in a row this early. Step on up to the plate Zombie, and several PfA songs that I would be doxxed if I mentioned in the same breath as Zombie (but are just as bad)

It seems nobody has friends I guess? I really appreciate what this track is going for and the breakdown part in the bridge is so fun, and though it's not the most memorable track on the album I would place it a bit higher, personally. Alas, the friendless popheads said otherwise...

---

#Popular kids

**Leixander** (10): you know why

**throwaway7650** (9.5): the bridge is such a nice switch-up, the best part of the song

**endcreditouilles** (9.3): This feels like an extension of Simmer in the best way. Love the funky breakdown.

**wavingwolves** (8.9): remember having friends ‚ö∞Ô∏è

**juanolsen** (8.6): friendship goals

**UselessTacooo** (8.6): I genuinely don‚Äôt know how to explain why I like/dislike this song, but it‚Äôs overall pretty fun

**relibee2** (8.5): ok this is actually a lot better than i remembered it‚Äôs not as boring as I thought it was

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i swear i've seen 'have friends who'll help you hide the body' one too many times on twitter to not have a full body reaction to reading the lyrics

**jaztinax** (8): wait how have i missed this completely?? the instruments somewhere after second verse or chorus go hard

**musical\_pyn** (8): the bridge/breakdown definitely elevates this song

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): seeing a Murr (from Impractical Jokers) cosplayer twerking leaves me scared and confused and NOT in the right way

**runaway3212** (8): I love friends!

**Stryxen** (7.9): and this is the only song on this album that i don‚Äôt LOVE but i like it a whole lot

**1998tweety** (7): this is nice, its giving me singer in a bar right before a fight breaks out in a mafia movie

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it would‚Äôve been better as a ballad

**bbfan132** (7): feels a bit uninteresting but it‚Äôs still good

**ElizabethDDoS** (7): She does this thing with the excessively louder chorus again, but it works better here.

**fallenriot** (7): it‚Äôs a cute moment for her and the album

**shesdoingyoga** (7): There are moments that I really like and moments that really bore me so it averages out to being fine

**waluigiest** (7): the chorus is kind of corny but the verses are magical. The beautiful descriptions of wrinkles and stretch marks, the dynamic instrumental track. It has some lovely moments.

**seanderlust** (6.3): hayley williams made a song saying "hey bestie" and you know what? it's not bad

#I don't need friends, they disappoint me

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): I forgot that this song existed ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): a let-down ode to friendship

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's cute but I'm just expecting more from Hayley lyrically at this point

**thedoctordances1940** (6): I don't have any friends so this just isn't relatable

**starla\_** (5.6): whenever i'm down, i call on you my friend

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): outside of the groovy bridge, it sounds too much like the first three songs on the album without the good things about those songs.

**frogaranaman** (5): drags quite honestly

**IIIHenryIII** (5): Forgettable.

**ImADudeDuh** (5): idc

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): nothing special

**zagreux** (5): I have no friends so I can't relate RP :/

**mudkip1** (2): I‚Äôm at the point in the album where I just desperately want to hear what her creative direction is. this album is fucking boring so far and feels so one-note. It doesn‚Äôt come close to even touching most of the material she made with Paramore. It‚Äôs baffling to me

**timothy444** (0): I got bored listening to this

**WeakProduct** (0): This album overall is a pretty big miss for me with a few exceptions, but among several duds, this one is the bottom of the barre for me

**ManofOranges** (10): Me when I'm mad

**relibee2** (10): bitter perfection

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): me when im actually mad

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): This song reminds me a lot of ROYL off of Ungodly Hour by Chloe x Halle. People will say it doesn‚Äôt fit but I think it‚Äôs An amazing song. I hope this one isn‚Äôt ignored by everyone.

**Roxieloxie** (9): damn drag him sis

**juanolsen** (8.7): i don't understand why this wasn't on the main album

**fallenriot** (8): definitely a bonus track but i love how petty it is

**ignitethephoenix** (8): why is this better then most of the other songs on the album

**runaway3212** (8): sure, jan

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i like this song but my boyfriend's opinion is "if you actually weren't mad you wouldn't have written the song" and he says it everytime he hears it

**timothy444** (8): Loving this passive agressiveness here lol

**IIIHenryIII** (7.8): Can we still call that passive aggression?

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): you know the break up was bad when you wish severe back pain on ur ex

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): not crazy about the repetitiveness of "these days," she's a good enough lyricist to come up with something else that rhymes. But it slaps and she still tears him apart

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I‚Äôm not mad at this but You Should Be Sad outsold

**AHSWeeknd** (7): me when I‚Äôm mad

**akanewasright** (7): I like this song more than I should

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): i‚Äôm not mad, i‚Äôm not mad, halsey continues to insist as she slowly shrinks and transforms into a corn cob

**wavingwolves** (6.1): I'm not angry anymore Well, sometimes I am I don't think badly of you Well, sometimes I do It depends on the day The extent of all my worthless rage I'm not angry anymore I'm not bitter anymore I'm syrupy sweet I'll rot your teeth down to their core If I'm really happy It depends on the day If I wake up in a giddy haze Well I'm not angry I'm not totally angry I'm not all that angry anymore

**1998tweety** (6): i can see why this was left off the standard version [2] at least its better though

**bbfan132** (6): it‚Äôs decent but one-note

#I AM FUCKING FUMING!!!!

**CrimsonROSET** (6): girl what did you listen to your own album

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): not really vibing with this

**frogaranaman** (5): I am mad

**ImADudeDuh** (5): yeah this is target deluxe

**Ok\_Ant5217** (5): well this is a stark contrast to what we got in the standard album and not in a good way

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): unfortunately I think the bonus tracks are going to drag down the rating of an otherwise solid album, they're both pretty forgettable and don't add anything to the album

**waluigiest** (4): she really went off with the timpani in these bonus tracks lmao

**Hulnia** (1): Halsey doesn‚Äôt have the charisma for a condescending song like this, and there‚Äôs nothing else of note here.

**ReallyCreative** (0): of all the songs on this record, this one very easily feels the most uninspired. I just cannot bring myself to want to listen to this again.

For a lot of people it seems this is somewhat of a filler track, which I can totally understand especially in comparison to the rest of Disc 3 which, in my opinion, is really stellar and the best out of the three sections of the album. It's sandwiched between two of my favourites on the album, and despite being a cute lil bop doesn't really hit at all, and really I'm fine with it being second boot for Hayley.

---

#Taken

**Awkward\_King** (10): this may have been my 11 before i knew other people were pushing for pure love (which i also love). this just has such nice fucking groove to it, and its such a sweet song, makes me want someone :grinny:

**Leixander** (10): you belong with me (hayley's version)

**waluigiest** (10): this subtle romantic jam session is unlike anything else on the album but it‚Äôs so special to me

**akanewasright** (9): This melody has never quite left my head since I heard this album when it dropped. And considering how little

**bluetriangles04** (9): A cute little bop!

**kirby31200** (9): It's just a fantastic vibe

**starla\_** (8.5): a cute bop

**Stryxen** (8.5): well did anybody ask?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a track for someone else, not for me

**bbfan132** (8): it‚Äôs simple but fun!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): me at any party

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7.9): It gets repetitive but I do really like it even if I feel like talking about your new relationship on an album about a terrible marriage is a jinx but I am superstitious.

**wavingwolves** (7.8): i want to have what she's having please and thank you

**juanolsen** (7.5): honestly the weakest song on the album

**throwaway7650** (7.5): chorus is catchy I guess but the song kind of goes nowhere I fear

**mudkip1** (7): this is elevator music

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): it's filler but good filler

**runaway3212** (7): if that's your mans why is he spoiling rate results in my DMs?

#Single

**1998tweety** (6.5): not bad but kinda filler-y

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): definitely one of the weaker songs, could've used more of the groovy vibes in the chorus during the rest of the song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): i do enjoy the simplicity and catchiness of the chorus but the production could be more interesting

**timothy444** (6.5): indie

**AHSWeeknd** (6): why did this follow Pure Love, it‚Äôs so low brow in comparison.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (6): Hmm....this song kinda feels so unnecessary to the album's structure. Just filler throughout the entire song.

**fallenriot** (6): probably the most forgettable song here, but nothing egregiously bad by any standards

**frogaranaman** (6): cool

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I like the groove but it's kinda boring

**skargardin** (6): A bad film series

**thedoctordances1940** (6): just not that interesting really, but it's alright

**UselessTacooo** (6): Shes a lyrical cringe fest

**zagreux** (6): Maybe it's just me but this song feels so dull and uninspired :/

**ImADudeDuh** (5): Liam neeson‚Äôs fictional daughter be like

**ReallyCreative** (4.7): it's not unpleasant but it's definitely filler

**seanderlust** (4.2): http://imgur.com/gtXFnP4

**IIIHenryIII** (4): I'm bored (again).

**LuisEnRod** (4): üé∂ castaways üé∂

**ktajlili** (0): I hate this track. I get so much emotional whiplash by the fact that this is on the same album as "Simmer"

I really like the delivery of the chorus but it's not for everyone. This would be a bit higher if it were up to me but even some of Petals for Armor's die-hards aren't huge on this track. Disc 1 ends up being the final section of the album to lose a song though, which is interesting for me since I'd rank them in the opposite order that they lost a song!

---

#Minecraft stans

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): Honestly my biggest issue with this album is when would you listen to it. I feel like it‚Äôs an album to listen to when you‚Äôre sad and what to be sadder but I personally don‚Äôt do that. I really like the song about memory‚Äôs that keep bothering you.

**fallenriot** (10): this song is the definition of a grower and holy shit has it grown on me. i‚Äôm a sucker for repeated bridges and the one on here‚Ä¶ legendary methinks

**relibee2** (10): apparently people don‚Äôt like this song? Idk why I really like it weird mellow bop

**TiltControls** (10): WHY YOU CREEPIN' ROUND HERE!

**throwaway7650** (9): I somehow love the unsettling vibes this song gives off

**Stryxen** (8.5): WHY YOU CREEPING ROUND HERE ü§®

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is good but Eric Church still ended ha

**kirby31200** (8): creeper aw man

**musical\_pyn** (8): I love the atmosphere of this track

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): I wasn't ready for the way the chorus hit me, please have mercy

**pat-rickstar** (8): I like the vocal effects on the chorus, it works well I think

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this is so fun! the "why you creepin round here" has a tinge of creepiness and is just perfect.

**vayyiqra** (8): This song is weird but it kind of bops and I like that it's about energy vampires, a major pet peeve of mine

**waluigiest** (8): the ‚Äúwhy you creeping round here‚Äù is always so loud

**akanewasright** (7.7): The lyrics are not as strong as most of the other songs, but it‚Äôs still a bop

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): the lonely island outsold

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): would've preferred it this was about literal vampires but still pretty good

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): I don't know if this is supposed to be some clever metaphor, or straight forward, so i'm gonna just assume this is a forbidden vampire love song

**AHSWeeknd** (7): did we ever find out why the person was creepin?

**bbfan132** (7): a drop in quality but it‚Äôs still fun to listen to

**NotWith10000Men** (7): the "so why you creepin round here" was the first moment in this album where I sat up and really started listening

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): that deep voice on ‚ÄúWhy you creepin‚Äô round here‚Ä¶‚Äù its weird but i like it

**jaztinax** (6.9): it‚Äôs kinda weird but idk i still vibe with it

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): the minecraft influence! wow!

#Aw man....

**timothy444** (6.5): creepy

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): props for being experimental though

**frogaranaman** (6): creeper? awwww yeaaaaaaaa. so we back in the mines,

**runaway3212** (6): Eh

**UselessTacooo** (6): WhY yOu CrEePiN rOuNd HeRe? Anyways it sounds practically the same as everything else on the album and the vocal modulation on the chorus does not fit at all.

**wavingwolves** (5.6): this stains a otherwise perfect album and for that i hate it üíî the chorus is just too obnoxious

**CrimsonROSET** (5.5): is this hyperpop

**1998tweety** (5): again, her songs could be amazing but theres always at least 1 element off about them, this time the weird voice modulation

**CarlieScion** (5): its incredible to me that a sub-3 minute song can feel so damn long

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This ain't it.

**J\_Toe** (4): there's something unmusical about these tracks that make it hard to listen to.

**NapsAndNetflix** (4): eric church did it better

**ReallyCreative** (3): Hayley we need to have a conversation about these annoying vocals because there's a way to pull this off and it's NOT this

**Brendon-Urine** (2.5): again‚Ä¶ the effects on her voice. The ‚Äúwhy you creepin ‚Äòround here‚Äù line gets more annoying every time.

An Ed Sheeran-penned track, Still Learning kinda sticks out for me and seemingly others near the end of the tracklist between the more emotional songs like More and 929, for all the wrong reasons. I don't actually think it's bad at all, it bops a little bit but more than anything it's just a bit underwhelming and so I'm not surprised to see it get the chop this early.

---

#Learning

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Deeply felt this (except for the second verse).

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): This song has been hitting lately. I may not live with a security team or pass green around my family tree, but I relate hard to having to learn to love myself!! I think this delivers self-awareness about past mistakes and reflections about being famous in a way that manages to not be self-pitying or out of touch.

**timothy444** (10): An emotional and relatable song that touches on learning to love "one self" while struggling with self identity.

**relibee2** (9): I already like myself but this bangs

**starla\_** (9): this sounds like a demi lovato song but in a good way

**savemeaseat143** (8.7): I like the beat!

**jaztinax** (8.5): i haven‚Äôt seen too many people talk about this but i really love this vibe for halsey

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): relatable bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is good

**ManofOranges** (8): Me in school

**ReallyCreative** (8): it's cute, I don't have a lot of other thoughts, but it's cute

**throwaway7650** (8): this is nice, I like halsey's take on a self-love anthem. I appreciate how it's not purely inspirational/positive and more introspective

**UselessTacooo** (8): this is classic Halsey and I cant not like it. I really enjoy this, even though it‚Äôs not my favourite on the record.

**Stryxen** (7.6): butigohomeandigotnoselfesteem makes me chuckle anyway stream learning in public by allie x (a 10)

**NotWith10000Men** (7.1): this one kinda blends into the rest of the album for me

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Halsey‚Äôs a great writer but this seems so easy.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Yep, I can definitely recognize Ed Sheeran's fingerprints in this song. This is okay I guess?

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): I feel like the placement of this track in the album is a bit off

**runaway3212** (7): omg me 2!!!

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): this just drags on a lot personally for me it‚Äôs not bad though

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is kind of boring but it isnt bad

#Smooth brain

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): production is nice but it doesn‚Äôt leave much else of an impression

**fallenriot** (6.5): probably the most basic/uninteresting song on the album, but still has a nice message and some cool lines

**kirby31200** (6.5): You can tell Ed Sheeran wrote this. Question Existing outsold

**akanewasright** (6): I like the idea of this song, but I don‚Äôt really love the execution much at all.

**CarlieScion** (6): the edsheeran-print!

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Well, just keep on...

**ImADudeDuh** (6): meanwhile im still learning sign language

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): I will immediately forget what this song sounds like once it's finished

**thedoctordances1940** (6): This feels like an attempt to recreate Without Me, but it's just nowhere near as catchy and lacks what makes Without Me so good.

**waluigiest** (6): the concept is there and I feel the emotion but it‚Äôs shapeless and a lot of the lyrics are really bland

**frogaranaman** (5): learning how to feel about this song

**nootnoot781** (5): this song is so good and then the chorus happens

**bbfan132** (4.5): not horrible but super super boring

**wavingwolves** (2.3): sounds like a lauv song (derogatory)

**Awkward\_King** (1): i have formally finished school so this song is no longer relatable to me unfortunately. also i dont like it.

**Hulnia** (1): You guessed it, I find this boring. I‚Äôve heard this exact concept millions of times, and it just doesn‚Äôt work here.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): ok let me get my actual defense on this out there because I don't think this will be a very popular opinion. I am not very familiar with Halsey's discography. I am not very familiar with Halsey's personal life. Therefor, I am not going to say I think Halsey is being emotionally manipulative in this song because, well, I don't know her. What I will say is that I've seen, in my personal life, people use their mental health many times to excuse things they've done to my friends and myself. And this is what I see in these lyrics. No matter your mental state, you should still take responsability for your actions/things you say, and recognize that those are explanations, not excuses. And maybe this isn't at all what this song is about, but this is what I think of/what it reminds me of.

Like Clementine, 929 utilizes some less than conventional vocal delivery with its off-beat stream of consciousness style, which isn't for everyone. I think it's a really neat way to close off the album and some of the lyrics here really hit. Again though, it garners a decently high controversy score because of this delivery style and gets booted early, despite also getting an 11.

---

#Liars

**TiltControls** (11): i also wasn't actually born at 9:29! so relatable!

**CarlieScion** (10): I can‚Äôt talk about how much I love this without crying.

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): What a way to close this album with some brutal honesty that feels kinda happy somehow. Ashely definitely matured a lot since then. I am so proud of her.

**fallenriot** (10): such a perfect closer

**musical\_pyn** (10): this probably would get my 11 from this album

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i love the birth certificate intro/outro

**Stryxen** (10): i could give a really critical analysis of why i‚Äôm giving this a 10 but i don‚Äôt want to

**waluigiest** (10): It‚Äôs this stream of consciousness song that‚Äôs somehow both youthful and mature. Excellent

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): it's okay girl my dad never calls either

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): something about the little anecdote about the pink haired kid in detroit just hits me

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): I don‚Äôt know for sure but I think this is about G-Eazy and I‚Äôm living for the way she‚Äôs calling him out. The way she delivers the verses reminds me of Fiona Apple on Fetch the Bolt Cutters.

**juanolsen** (9.4): great way to end the album and the.comceot around it is really interesting.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): ‚ÄúDon't meet your heroes, they're all fucking weirdos, and God knows that they were right‚Äù fucking tea!! now Halsey, do some background checks on these shitty rock star men before sampling them in your songs‚Ä¶

**akanewasright** (9): There are parts of this that remind me that this is the woman who sang that blink-182 song at the mall, but the lyrics are just so sweet... it‚Äôs really the perfect ending

**grey** (9): i thought my premium spotify ran out and this intro was one of their ads

**ImADudeDuh** (9): a real interesting song

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): honestly the perfect closer for this album

**wavingwolves** (9): tbh "and i'm picking my hair out in clumps in the shower" has NO RIGHTS in hitting as much as it did when i listened to this at 2am

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): girl how do you remember all that shit

**AHSWeeknd** (8): man talk about sadness

**ignitethephoenix** (8): this feels like slam poetry

**runaway3212** (8): this is really cute

**zagreux** (8): [Halsey - 929](https://youtu.be/Tw0zYd0eIlk?t=156)

**savemeaseat143** (7.9): the verses sound like those TikTok freestyles

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7.8): I really like how emotive she is on this and I find the feature lyrics so interesting given that she‚Äôs not really on bad terms with most of her exes.

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): if i had a nickel for every song i‚Äôve compared to kendrick lamar‚Äôs DUCKWORTH in a rate comment i would have 2 nickels‚Äî anyway, i do like these sort of confessional closing tracks in general, but i don‚Äôt think it stacks up too well with other songs here.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): a great ending track from the normal edition

**kirby31200** (7): I can't believe she lied to us

**1998tweety** (6.5): cute closer

#Feature on the B-Side

**throwaway7650** (6.5): "stream of consciousness" gives me nightmares from AP english

**outsideeyess** (6.1): i would've liked it more if this whole song was her narrating how she plans to prove her time of birth

**J\_Toe** (6): this constant stream of conscious breathless continuing lyrical style is exactly what I expected off of Halsey from what little exposure I had to her prior to this rate.

**vayyiqra** (6): I remember a blue-haired girl in Detroit she is my ex and I still miss her sometimes ! Sad !

**bbfan132** (5.5): these lyrics‚Ä¶ hm, not my favorite closer

**starla\_** (5.1): better freestyle than iggy azalea's

**Brendon-Urine** (5): the lyrics are kinda cool, just like winding thoughts but everything else is kinda boring

**frogaranaman** (5): the rhythm in the verses really throws me off

**jasannn** (5): more of a stream of consciouness than a song.

**rickikardashian** (5): this is a gabbie hanna song

**Ok\_Ant5217** (4): a rather boring reflective voicenote of memories finishes us off

**timothy444** (4): Very very meh

**IIIHenryIII** (3): Ok, but who is she calling out on this one?

**LuisEnRod** (3): I hate spoken intros :(

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): fun fact, i found out i was born at rougly 7:30 in the evening because my mum remembers not being able to watch coronation street because she was giving birth to me. she remembers that and yet she routinely forgets my birthday

**ReallyCreative** (2): some of these lines are just bad, there had to have been a better way to close this album, maybe Finally // beautiful stranger?

**brenda\_official** (0): there is such a thing as oversharing

**thedoctordances1940** (0): Why that intro? Why this song? Why are we still here? Just to suffer?

This track is quite nice with some really good lyrics, but for me personally it's harmed a bit by its position in the tracklist being in-between two much more hard-hitting songs that I gave 10s to. As a whole though I have nothing against it, but I'm not shocked that it's a day 1 cut for Hayley.

---

#Can't leave it alone...

**fallenriot** (10): hayley‚Äôs lyrics and wordplay are always top-tier, and this song is absolutely soul-crushing

**Leixander** (10): radiohead found suing as we speak

**waluigiest** (10): ‚ÄúNow that I finally‚ÄÖwanna live / The ones I love are dying‚Äù is devastating. this song hits.

**wavingwolves** (9.1): i feel in my bones this will be a day 1 song but it's so beautiful and it meant so much to me in a 2020, a year in which i had to see people dying and a pandemic starting to happen when i was having the best mental health moment in years

**AHSWeeknd** (9): the subtlety here is excellent.

**akanewasright** (9): The lyrics on this album are pretty much universally 10s

**bbfan132** (9): i feel like i‚Äôm floating on water in the dark while listening to this

**CrimsonROSET** (9): it's 5am mam i dont want to think about my mortality and losing people why did i choose to do the rate right now i'm about to cry

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (9): I simply must highly rate music about suicide. In all seriousness I like the themes and track but not sure how I feel about it because hanging references are a lot for me. So there‚Äôs a tension in hearing the music that‚Äôs my issues with the topics. That‚Äôs said I think it‚Äôs a good conversation on mortality and I regularly listen to a rock ballad about someone‚Äôs dad talking to their son about mortality so I feel comfortable in scoring it high.

**starla\_** (9): she sounds so beautiful here. Maybe Hayley should cover Heart of Glass instead.

**seanderlust** (8.5): "If you know love/You best prepare to grieve/Let it enter your open heart, then/Prepare to let it leave" :(

**throwaway7650** (8.5): kind of reminds me of mario desert songs. lovely lyrics

**cremeebrulee** (8): the atmosphere here is so mwah

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): really enjoy the moody vibe of this one

**Stryxen** (8): i love how sensual the first act feels and this is definitely the most intimate song here it feels like a direct look into hayley‚Äôs emotional state just laid out in a song

**relibee2** (7.8): I actually really like the chorus so it elevates the song for me to this score

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): i think this kind of comes too early in the tracklisting, its much more of a moody and kinda slowburn track, and i think would do better once you're more settled into the album, but i think still does a good job here and i love the harmonies of vocal layered over each other and the "it tastes so bitter on my tongue, the truth's a killer but i can't leave it alone" is such a smart line and melodically so lovely

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): I‚Äôve never really knew how I felt about this song. It feels like it‚Äôs missing something production wise. Although the chorus is really nice and saves the track for me

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): too sad for me to enjoy it completely

**frogaranaman** (7): direct Radiohead to Hayley Williams pipeline in this song

**IIIHenryIII** (7): The lyrics are so sad but the song doesn't sound sad at all.

**jackisboredtoday** (7): this is nice but it just lacks that kick that would make my come back to it more

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): perfect for a cafe even though the lyrics are dark... also that interlude doesn't bode well

#It tastes so bitter

**runaway3212** (7): super catchy and fun but a bit empty

**NotWith10000Men** (6.9): "now that I finally want to live, the ones I love are dying." damn. I like the verses, esp the first one, but something is off when everything kicks in in the chorus

**1998tweety** (6.5): this is chill but kind of a nonevent

**timothy444** (6.5): nice

**CarlieScion** (6): a bit too mellow

**ReallyCreative** (5.8): there are a couple of interesting moments in this one, but ultimately it falls flat

**ImADudeDuh** (5): she should‚Äôve left this song alone

**shesdoingyoga** (5): I typically enjoy the sort of music that people like to label as boring, like Lana and Phoebe, but this is just doing nothing for me.  Like it objectively isn‚Äôt bad but I‚Äôm just bored

**TiltControls** (5): could use a bit more spice

**thedoctordances1940** (4): Radiohead but it isn't good

**Brendon-Urine** (3): this song needs a warning for Radiohead fans, honestly this just sounds like them boiled down. Not about it.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): ugh honestly i just find this song so boring and a drag to get through. the lyrics/theme of it is interesting so it gets a few points there.

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): I get what she's going for here but this just has the same energy as a song I would have played in jazz band in high school and we all would have hated because it was boring and nothing happened and I can't get past that like I just know I would have been standing there repeating this same bass line over and over bored out of my mind

The first Miley cut of the rate, and for me it's a tad overdue to be quite honest. The back half of Plastic Hearts doesn't hit too hard for me (I prefer the bops that make up the first half) and it really shows by the last couple songs where the ballads start to wear thin. This is the closing track of the album itself (not including the covers) and by this point I just want to move on. Not at all disappointed that this is leaving.

---

#They wore the golden g string

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a full circle moment with WTF Do I Know. The album starts with unapologetic self acceptance and ends with reflective self acceptance, it‚Äôs amazing.

**Brendon-Urine** (10): such a beautiful song! I‚Äôve been obsessed since the album came out

**Hulnia** (10): I don‚Äôt know what to say, I just love everything about this.

**letsallpoo** (10): this is a good song fuck everyone

**runaway3212** (10): a really solid closer

**fallenriot** (9.5): one of the best album closers ever? quite possibly

**UselessTacooo** (9.3): I've never understood why people didn‚Äôt like this song. It‚Äôs always been one of my favourites. My only gripe is basically the opposite of what I liked about Hate Me. It feels like the instrumental is too pushed back and should have been a bit louder in some parts

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.1): The second verse is so on point, I appreciate how Miley recognizes that she doesn‚Äôt have it all figured out and that our choices don‚Äôt happen in a vacuum because ~we live in a society~ without slut shaming her past self, and while conveying hope that the system can be changed

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i don't think this song was popular but i thought it was a nice reflective piece and ties in as a strong closer. as pitchfork said, it's the least amount of foot in mouth that miley has done when talking about her past. the last line being "i think i'll stay" feels open ended and will lead nicely into her next album

**throwaway7650** (9): this song is overhated af and for what... I get that it's the last ballad after being hit with multiple in the last several tracks, but this isn't a bad song at all. maybe the people who are tanking this are Silver F Slurs

**bluetriangles04** (8.5): ...I was not expecting a song titled Golden G String to be a ballad.

**rickikardashian** (8.5): a grown up Hannah Montana would have rocked the fuck out of a golden g string

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): This one really works for me because of how the lyrics are reflecting on her life and career in a way that I wasn‚Äôt really expecting from her

**CrimsonROSET** (8): maybe the true golden g string were the friends we made along the way

**jasannn** (8): we love introspection

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): amazing closer for the album

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this is a nice closing track but I just don‚Äôt come back to it much compared to the rest of the album

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): a strong closer track for the standard edition

**NotWith10000Men** (7): "I was trying to own my power." this verse is so good. Not at all what I was expecting from a miley song with this title

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): okay now I sort of see why Angels Like You wasn't the closer... sort of

#Certified wood g string

**skargardin** (7): The lyrics are kinda clunky but thankfully her voice makes up for it

**thedoctordances1940** (7): It's a nice closer but nothing particularly special

**juanolsen** (6.5): the weakest songs in the album

**bbfan132** (6): it was fine but kind of forgettable

**CarlieScion** (6): so close to a primal heart shoutout

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): it kept feeling like this song was building to something but then it just ended?

**ReallyCreative** (6): love the lyrics but the sound just isn't for me

**Stryxen** (6): not quite forgettable but kinda hard to care about

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): Golden B-side song.

**1998tweety** (5): Miley and Dua both randomly ending their albums with a somewhat politic song, also the worst songs on those albums.

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (5): Lyrically I love it, but it‚Äôs way too slow and too much of a ballad for me. Like lyrically I love it but I can not sit through this slow song.

**frogaranaman** (5): wait is this a sex reference

**timothy444** (5): Excluding the live tracks, this is quite a weak way to finish off an amazing album.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): I feel like Miley had to add a song called this to remind us that she‚Äôs not hannah montana still

**ManofOranges** (4): Definitely my least favorite closer of the rate. I'm just bored by it.

**vayyiqra** (4): Bad song but the lyrics are kind of based at least

**cremeebrulee** (3): i sleep [2]

**akanewasright** (2.9): It‚Äôs fine I guess

**waluigiest** (0): I genuinely think she had a cool idea for a song title, and then wrote and contorted the most uninspiring mess to fit the title.

The production on this track is some of my favourite on the album and a lot of the comments agree with that which is nice to see. This winds up being a bit controversial with both two 11s and two 0s, but also a whole lot of mid scores, earning it a day 1 boot - which is a bit disappointing for me, personally.

---

#Always and forever,

**celladonn** (11): I don't expect this to do well but I must live my truth. I adore this track so much

**akanewasright** (10): This is kind of an interlude but it works so fucking well with the other two songs in this succession

**CarlieScion** (10): cursing my tongue for being mean!!!! Why can halsey read into my soul!!!!! Also the piano????????????? So haunting!!!!!! So terrifying!!!!!!! So powerful!!!!!!

**fallenriot** (10): the lyrics on this one are so incredible, i love the whole trio and how they all flow together

**seanderlust** (10): the switch up here bumped this up a solid 2 points. when it modulates to minor and she starts tearing into herself >>

**timothy444** (10): Holy moly, when the piano instrumental break hits you know that the song is going to hit HARD

**UselessTacooo** (9.6): Wow. I‚Äôm not going to lie, I was going into this album thinking it was going to be terrible but it‚Äôs actually really good. Maybe my current environment is adding to the feeling of this song (it‚Äôs pouring and thundering at the moment) but that piano is hitting so hard. Honestly the outro is Halsey‚Äôs hyperpop/art pop moment and I‚Äôm all for it

**endcreditouilles** (9.5): why does the piano part give me major Twilight vibes... Also the ending absolutely fucks!!!!

**NotWith10000Men** (9.5): the grammar nerd in me hates "substituting honest with sarcastic." I wish they could have fit honesty/sarcasm instead. But that's such a tiny nitpick and I love the overall structure

**kirby31200** (9): The best song on this album is the ballad that will likely not even see day 2. The piano + outro is the best part of this album

**runaway3212** (9): Is this hyperpop?

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9): The beginning is a cute 8 but I absolutely love the outro. Flashbacks to Panic‚Äôs Build God, Then We‚Äôll Talk??

**savemeaseat143** (9): it‚Äôs weird but I‚Äôm into it

**throwaway7650** (9): the piano solo hard carries this song

**TiltControls** (9): yes it is

**waluigiest** (9): the writing is creative and I do love the cute piano interlude

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is pretty, love the instrumental part

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this is cute but the second half dropped it down a bit

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): that piano interlude kinda sexy ngl but not feeling the lyrics here, they‚Äôre pretty clunky again

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): I'd never really thought much of this song before but it's definitely a hidden gem! Love the complete 180 shift in tone towards the end

**rickikardashian** (7.5): halsey‚Äôs tumblr roots really show in this song because i can just picture the monochromatic moodboard gif sets with lyrics from this song in arial bold italic that would have been made

**relibee2** (7.4): I think darker turn the song takes near the end and the screaming makes me like it a lot more

**ignitethephoenix** (7.2): No...(shit of course it is)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): pretty sad

**CrimsonROSET** (7): you can argue forever is the longest time!

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7): I found the plastic plant lyrics really good

**jaztinax** (7): i wanna the acknowledge the piano bit and the outro only bc it‚Äôs so beautiful and emotional ugh

#Too long

**plastichaxan** (7): and a long time is what this song under 3 minutes feels like‚Ä¶ but those final seconds really saved this whole album lol

**wavingwolves** (6.7): i too feel unlovable

**jasannn** (6.5): The first half of this is boring but I love the second half.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): The first part isn't all that great but I do like the second half when it shifts into the minor key.

**AHSWeeknd** (6): the war cadets line throws me off. I like the production though.

**bbfan132** (6): it sounds nice but it didn‚Äôt do much for me

**J\_Toe** (6): that "weightless, breathless, restitute" bit sounds like the pre-chorus of Happy Little Pill by Troye Sivan.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (6): cool key change but other than that it's just a preinterlude

**shesdoingyoga** (6): This feels like several different ideas she tried cramming into one song that ends up worse than each of the individual ideas.  There are parts of this that I like on their own but together it doesn‚Äôt work for me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): enjoyable but glad it's on the short side

**ReallyCreative** (5): Halsey is not for subtlety and unfortunately I think a little bit more finesse and agility is needed lyrically and musically to pull a song like this off. She gets points for the attempt though.

**Stryxen** (5): okay luigis mansion

**zagreux** (4.9): Too pretentious for a song that has the depth of an oil slick

**ManofOranges** (4): Yes, it is.

**mudkip1** (4): shes so edgy

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): tf is this so ominous for are u ok girlie

**Hulnia** (1): Forever... is how long this song feels

**IIIHenryIII** (1): I'm bored to death.

**frogaranaman** (0): I thought this was over and then there was another two minutes left of the song

The intro track to the album, Ashley sees Halsey introduce herself as, well, her after two albums of dystopian concept worlds and characters. Manic was described as her most personal album, so opening it with a self-titled track is about as ~personal~ as you can get. I like the production a lot on this, but it ultimately finds itself getting cut in day 1.

---

#Who's the girl next door living in the haunted mansion?

**buzzyrecky** (11): The lyrics really resonate with me and its a very underappreciated song. Out of all the '10's in my book, this one deserves the most love.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Why‚Äôs she screaming. Also imagine having a Kate Winslet feature, iconic.

**relibee2** (10): honestly kinda a perfect song

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love how soft and intimate the chorus is while the chorus is an outburst of emotion. Cashmere Cat‚Äôs production always does it for me, and this is a great invitation into Ashley‚Äôs headspace as she prepares to be more personal than ever.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): a big grower for me and perfectly encapsulates the essence of the album. the spoken outro is relevant af.

**wavingwolves** (10): the best song on this album actually

**UselessTacooo** (9.6): Beautiful song. The production is really good and the vocal modulation adds a lot. That‚Äôs not something I commonly say about autotune.

**akanewasright** (9): Really solid album opener.

**Brendon-Urine** (9): idk if it‚Äôs a specific effect but something about her voice when she goes up on ‚Äúburst into flames‚Äù is beautiful

**fallenriot** (9): this is such a strong opener and introduction to the more personal nature of the album

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I still don't get the title.

**timothy444** (9): A chilling rockin' opening track.

**savemeaseat143** (8.7): reminds me of hfk, an album I liked even though it was Not widely well received

**endcreditouilles** (8.5): someDAYYYY once told me the world is gonna roll me

**jasannn** (8.3): great opener. I love the roughness of the production

**CrimsonROSET** (8): girl if you disintegrate there won't be any pieces left!

**NotWith10000Men** (8): I like the emphasis on 'days' in the first half. Great intro.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): lyrics hit HARD

**seanderlust** (8): lyrically one of my favorites. the instrumental is fine, but the lyrics really make this shine as an opener

**shesdoingyoga** (8): I kind of wish there was more going on with the song, her vocals deserve a better instrumental

**vayyiqra** (8): chill lo-fi beats to angst to

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): Halsey said I hate America i hate being an American and y‚Äôknow what? fair

**1998tweety** (7): this is an ok opener even though she's screechy at some points

**bbfan132** (7): nice intro! wasn‚Äôt expecting much but i liked the production

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I only know Halsey sorry

**runaway3212** (7): This song should've really hinted to me that's Halsey's real name was Ashley

**RandomHypnotica** (6.6): oh my god, it's an anagram of Halsey, that's so smart!

#My name isn't Ashley

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): it's a pretty song but a bit forgettable to me. It's a shame as I feel like it's a bit of a weak way to open the album

**throwaway7650** (6.5): this song is about as interesting as finding out that Halsey is an anagram of Ashley... the movie monologue doesn't help with that either

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): not my favorite

**kirby31200** (6): who's ashley

**rickikardashian** (6): ashleigh*

**Stryxen** (6): i love the instrumental but her voice is doing nothing for me

**waluigiest** (6): why did I think the outro was Birds of Prey lmfao

**starla\_** (5.5): nice minimalistic vibe, but a little boring

**cremeebrulee** (5): its rly clunky lyrically so it‚Äôs a lot to take in as an opener and not in a good way

**frogaranaman** (5): why does it just pause for a second in the middle of the song

**ImADudeDuh** (5): did something go wrong with the melody of this song? It feels so awkward

**ReallyCreative** (5): I love a good sample but every other part of this intro is not pleasant to listen to

**thedoctordances1940** (2.5): Partially completely and utterly boring, partially absolutely awful and unlistenable.

**Hulnia** (1): This is just a bad concept for a song, it feels like it‚Äôs just there to set something up that it just doesn‚Äôt. It‚Äôs also the first of a collection of bad songs.

**Awkward\_King** (0): yoooo whos this ashley chick i thought this album was by halsey

To be honest I thought people liked this song more and I was in the minority being just fine with it but I guess I was wrong! This is Miley's second cut and despite having the legendary Joan Jett as a feature, it doesn't end up doing too well in this rate. I guess the moans are offputting for some people - for me, this stretch of the album really needed a full on BOP and this just doesn't do it for me I fear. I think I prefer it over a couple of the ballads from this section, though.

---

#*moans*

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I don‚Äôt know why people don‚Äôt like this. It‚Äôs Joan Jett, Miley Cyrus, and Mark Ronson. The moaning with the consistent drum beat, ITS EXCELLENCE.

**cremeebrulee** (10): put the ‚Äúwhy is she marrying a sound effect‚Äù meme here for miley‚Äôs uh huh uh

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Bonk! Go to horny jail! Ok, I‚Äôll just say it: it sounds like somebody's just farted at the end.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Joan Jett MWAH!

**J\_Toe** (10): so when Miley teased this during the 2019 MET Gala it sounded more country than rock. I was instantly hooked, but secretly wished it would be a rock track, as country isn't my favourite genre. I was so ecstatic when I first heard the track, and heard the Joan Jett feature, who works so perfectly on the track.

**letsallpoo** (10): "I've always picked a giver 'cause I've always been the taker" means this song is canonically about bottoming

**NotWith10000Men** (10): joan jett sounds like a fucking badass and the moans crack me tf up

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this is so sexy and fun i was obsessed on first listen

**waluigiest** (10): THIS IS CLASSIC!!! She is so genre savvy

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I thought this was SO annoying the first time I heard it but it just stuck fast in my brain. Joan sounds amazing on this.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): love this song. It I have overplayed it slightly so it has shrunk but it‚Äôs so fun still

**juanolsen** (9.4): I LOVE ROCK N' ROLL

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.3): stan Joan Jett

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): love the vocalizations, sets it apart from the other songs.

**1998tweety** (9): this is ahead of its time and will unfairly be robbed

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (9): I really like how many women she has in this album. Also Miley making double life metaphors will always be funny to me.

**fallenriot** (9): legendary behavior

**throwaway7650** (9): sassy by nature #gaslight_gatekeep_girlboss

**jasannn** (8.5): I remembered everyone commenting about the moans on this song when the album dropped. Then I was so underwhelmed when all I heard "uh uh uh uh," but I still love that chorus.

**relibee2** (8.3): I hate love too

**starla\_** (8.3): i really love the 80s

**Brendon-Urine** (8): the moaning is a bit too much but everything else is real good!

**TiltControls** (8): oh uh aw

**wavingwolves** (8): joan jett if you‚Äôre reading this i am free on thursday night. if you would like to hang out i am free on thursday night when i am free to hang out. i am free to hang out on thursday night so if you're free let me know. please respond to this and then hang out with me on thursday night when i'm free.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7.5): those moans get really annoying but that's a killer chorus

**seanderlust** (7.5): given the joan jett feature and the angel olson guitar i really wish i liked this more, but i really don't see myself returning to it after this rate

**akanewasright** (7): -q loud sex noises

**runaway3212** (7): this is bad but it's also amazing

**bbfan132** (6.5): she should stick to her lower register more often, she sounds good at points here! joan‚Äôs a nice addition too

#more like BAD karma

**shesdoingyoga** (7): Before the album came out I expected this to be better based on the leaks and I was a bit disappointed

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): nice but after literal years of teasing and leaking this isn‚Äôt even the standout of the album

**UselessTacooo** (6.8): remember how I said here was barely a low point? This is the low point. It‚Äôs okay, but the constant moans in the background get on my nerves quickly

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): This is my least favourite of the features on the album. The chorus is really good, but the verses...

**astrologicalangel** (6): I wish the whole thing sounded like the bridge

**endcreditouilles** (6): this would be a much higher score without all the "uh UH uh UH UH", it ruins it for me.

**frogaranaman** (6): were those moans-

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): the uh-uhs are just a bit off putting to me

**zagreux** (6): I haven't criticized the songwriting on this album so far because Miley doesn't brand herself as a songwriter but the lyrics here are absolutely atrocious. Itsy bitsy spider? really?

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): i know i already have a reputation for being ageist but id prefer this song if it was just miley. i wouldnt ageist if old people would simply make better music

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): not as good as the other tracks

**CrimsonROSET** (5): you get the BEEEEEEEEEEEST of both worlds

**ManofOranges** (5): Not a fan of this one! Sorry to Joan!

**RandomHypnotica** (5): *sexual moans*

**ReallyCreative** (5): uhAH ahhh

**buzzyrecky** (4): (one of the few songs this rate i cant vibe with at all, sorry!)

**CarlieScion** (4): the moaning? Just made me wanna listen to uhoh by Julia michaels

**pat-rickstar** (4): The moans are just obnoxious, the chorus is decent though

**vayyiqra** (4): A song with Joan Jett should not be as bloodless as this is

**Stryxen** (3.5): i only got interested near the end and it lasted for like 2 seconds

**Roxieloxie** (3): why are they moaning in the back

**static\_int\_husp** (3): The only song in the last year with moans in the mix that isn't offputting is Bodyodyodyodyodyodyody by Megan Thee Stallion

**timothy444** (3): I hate how the "uhhhhhs" that are spread out in the comments remind me of P.hub and honestly it's kinda uncomfortable.

**grey** (0): my average for this album almost being a 9 until this song

**LuisEnRod** (0): :/

**mudkip1** (0): sorry to these two legends but it‚Äôs really grating:( I used to ironically like the moaning but now it just annoys me

A wlw anthem, Halsey taps into some pop-rock once more here with the legendary Alanis Morrissette by her side and for me it really works. Your pussy IS a wonderland, she's right and she should say it. It's not for everyone however, and that combined with interludephobia means it falls a bit short of making day 2.

---

#YOUR PUSSY IS A WONDERLAND

**AHSWeeknd** (10): tbh this is an eleven contender for me. I know this‚Äôll be a first out but it‚Äôs just so good. It goes all the way off. Plus Alanis Morissette is an icon.

**akanewasright** (10): this controversy score is going to be high, isn‚Äôt it?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): a perfect interlude about lesbian relationships

**CarlieScion** (10): my pussy DO be a wonderland tho (aka the John Mayer remix nobody needed)

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I really like women singing together about women.

**ElizabethDDoS** (10): Gay rights.

**fallenriot** (10): iconic feature and iconic song

**NotWith10000Men** (10): this is the song that finally convinced me to listen to jagged little pill (it's so fucking good) so thank you halsey

**Roxieloxie** (10): oh she was HORNY on this one damn

**seanderlust** (10): ICONIC. happy fucking pride month

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.8): I didn‚Äôt like this at first, internalized biphobia?? Now I really appreciate all the layers that this song has, the intimate details contrasted with the bluntness of "your pussy is a wonderland". Alanis adds a powerful presence, I love this solidarity between different generations of alternative-pop icons. My one complaint is that sampling Brand New was a CHOICE, I hate giving fractions of pennies to Jesse L*cey every time I stream this. On my way to make a mashup replacing that sample with the percussion from Garbage‚Äôs #1 Crush‚Ä¶ it could be something!!

**static\_int\_husp** (9.5): the bi-est song on this album

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): The way Halsey named this interlude after Alanis and it's about pussy eating. What a bi legend

**throwaway7650** (8.5): what's up with alanis' voice at the beginning

**savemeaseat143** (8.2): second verse >>

**jaztinax** (8): give me all the wlw content yes yes yes

**LuisEnRod** (8): your pussy is a wonderland

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): a lesbian anthem! Alanis seems to be yodelling though??? and I like it???

**runaway3212** (8): This has really grown on me

**starla\_** (8): this is low key great

**waluigiest** (8): gay rights!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): John Mayer is shaking at the queer version of his song

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): she really made a whole ass song about eating pussy huh. I guess I stan?

**kirby31200** (7.5): So cool of this rate to include such a powerful and influential bi woman. Oh Halsey's here too I guess

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I actually like this one.

**vayyiqra** (7): Wait this is kind of good and it makes so much sense that this exists

#Lesbophobes

**jasannn** (7): How is this an interlude when it doesn't transition well and the scream in the beginning scares me each time?

**juanolsen** (7): it's not as interesting as other songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): YOUR PUSSY IS A WONDERLAND

**UselessTacooo** (7): respectfully what is this song. The lyrics feel messy and so do the vocals

**wavingwolves** (6.1): my pussy is a wonderland [2]

**cremeebrulee** (6): maybe its my internalized biphobia that's stopping me from liking this

**endcreditouilles** (6): "your pussy is a wonderland" John Mayer found dead in a ditch

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): they really said I don't care if you've got a WAP huh

**ReallyCreative** (6): while I also love women, I'm not a huge fan of how this sounds

**Stryxen** (6): Its enjoyable

**1998tweety** (5.5): this is ok. "your pussy is a wonderland" lowkey took me out

**bbfan132** (5.5): halsey‚Äôs part is fine but alanis‚Äôs vocals are produced horribly and it brings the song down for me :/

**Awkward\_King** (5): might fuck abt and listen to jagged little pill mid rate when im already literally doing this past the due date

**frogaranaman** (5): ‚Äúyour pussy is a wonderland‚Äù? okay Disney gays üôÑ

**ImADudeDuh** (5): my pussy is more like a kmart parking lot tbh :/

**shesdoingyoga** (5): I feel bad not liking this, but I don‚Äôt like the difference between the quality of the vocals and it feels like the pussy line was only put in to distract people from the rest of the song.  I also don‚Äôt generally like when an interlude is longer than any actual song from the album so I‚Äôm being bitter and taking extra points for that

**timothy444** (5): Very meh

**zagreux** (5): Alanis' parts and nice Halsey's just ...exist?

**avg-vag** (4): this is so good but also terrible

**thedoctordances1940** (4): This song/interlude really struggles with some of its transitions, at time there's nothing in the percussion that suggests a transition when there clearly should be one. Oh and also fuck that opening dying cat sound at the beginning. Not too bad otherwise though I guess.

RIP to the third and final interlude, I think it does the best out of the three because it's relatively """uncontroversial""" with its content (doesn't have korean or pussy :sob:) but alas, interludephobia strikes it nonetheless. This was ahead of the other interludes by a decent margin at some points but in the end it falls right after Alanis.

---

#We love interludes

**akanewasright** (10): This is actually an album highlight. I know nothing about Dominic Fike but I *adore* him here

**Awkward\_King** (10): i just thought it was the best song i ever heard

**CarlieScion** (10): this really is the best thing Dominic like has ever done

**celladonn** (10): I wish more of Dominic's music sounded like this

**endcreditouilles** (10): I'm not even sure if Halsey is in this but it's my favorite interlude of all time

**frogaranaman** (10): why is one of the best songs on the album an interlude by another artist

**ManofOranges** (10): Kind of a bop for an interlude. I'm a bit mad that this isn't even a minute and a half in length.

**rickikardashian** (10): i wanna kiss dominic fike on the mouth

**timothy444** (10): An  interlude that doesn't suck? What sort of world is this?

**waluigiest** (10): this sounds amazing. Yay Dominic!

**wavingwolves** (10): INTERLUDEPHOBIA SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED HERE!!!!!!!!

**savemeaseat143** (9.5): too short???? Where‚Äôs the rest?

**devilonmytongue0** (9): honestly the interlude was my favourite part of the album so far

**IIIHenryIII** (9): I needed a full song! This sounds so good! Fuck it! I'll just keep considering this the intro to I HATE EVERYBODY.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is actually real nice

**NotWith10000Men** (9): his voice is really pleasing and the instruments are cool. Love the vocal effects at the beginning

**Roxieloxie** (8.8): if anything miss halsey needs a tina taught me in order to survive against miley

**Leixander** (8.5): best album track being an interlude with dominic fike... i have to laugh

**UselessTacooo** (8.4): have I heard this same exact production in a million pop songs before? Absolutely. Do I really care? No, I love it. It‚Äôs a short and simple interlude but I feel as if it adds a lot to to be album as a whole.

**jaztinax** (8): such a strong beatles vibe mixed with 2012-2014 alternative pop, i dig it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): When Mom says we have Panic! At the Disco at home, stream Photo ID Remix

**thedoctordances1940** (8): I think I really like this, but I'm still not entirely sure.

**fallenriot** (7.5): i wish halsey at least gave some background vocals, but i love the beach boys vibe

**jasannn** (7.5): I love these transitions. I'll also say its pretty smart to keep your features relegated to the interlude on your personal album.

**kirby31200** (7.5): Men? in my Break Up Pop rate?

**Hulnia** (7): The fact this is by far my favourite song here really says a lot. üò≠ Alas, not even Halsey could ruin this one...

#interludephobia

**throwaway7650** (7.5): what's up with dominic's voice at the beginning

**bbfan132** (7): it‚Äôs pretty good, i wish i could hear a full version though and not just an interlude!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): this was cute but like, eh?

**juanolsen** (7): i don't find it really interesting

**zagreux** (6.7): It ended right when I started liking it :/

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): Really good for a 1 minute interlude... but still an interlude

**1998tweety** (6): this feels a bit out of place on the album but its not awful

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): not my favorite

**ignitethephoenix** (6): was Halsey even on this??

**J\_Toe** (6): certainly a change of pace

**runaway3212** (6): Not terrible

**Stryxen** (6): this sounds like a pitch perfect original

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): I like Dominic sometimes but the vocals here are just‚Ä¶. not for me

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): i dont understand these guest interludes

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Interludephobia strikes again.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5): gives me Pretty Odd. vibes? kind of?

**Ok\_Ant5217** (5): this guy managed to sound like a generic boy band

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): never rlly had much of an opinion on this one

**vayyiqra** (5): Not to be interludephobic but why are the vocals on this so weird

**starla\_** (4.5): not much to say about this, really, it exists

**ReallyCreative** (4): this is HARD to listen to at some points, I think the way these vocals are mixed/produced/SOMETHING needed another opinion

**seanderlust** (4): call your girlfriend for straight people who watch hypebeast youtubers

**mudkip1** (3): stream Remi Wolf - Photo ID (feat. Dominic Fike) instead, it's a lot better

Here's Miley's first cover to get the chop, and I do prefer the Heart of Glass cover so this is fine. Some people have very strong feelings on this which nets it a pretty high controversy score. I think the covers are fine personally, but I don't have too much personal attachment to either original song so any stylistic differences or how she delivers it in comparison to the originals don't really bother me. It's our last cut for day 1 however, which I'm sure some people are quite happy about.

---

#ZOOOMBIE

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Miley‚Äôs voice adds a different sort of emotion behind the lyrics, it‚Äôs a sort of passion that differs from the lyrics but awakens a passion through the tone of the song.

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I considered giving this my 11 bc I really like the song itself.  But I‚Äôm kinda confused why a cover not in the album is included in the first place. Good song though

**NotWith10000Men** (10): I would live for a 100% punch-you-in-the-face rock album from miley

**pat-rickstar** (10): Imagine thinking these covers are bad when they're some of the highlights of the album

**runaway3212** (10): iconique

**skargardin** (10): a much better use of her vocals than heart of glass

**zagreux** (10): If Miley prefers covers to original material then I'll score her covers higher than her original material. Also, this is a great cover so it's not like I'm giving it a high score out of spite or something lol.

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): Her voice on this one does things to me

**1998tweety** (9): IN YOUR HEAAAAAAAAAD

**buzzyrecky** (9): love this song so it gets a pass. excellent cover

**fallenriot** (9): i like this one better than heart of glass actually!

**ManofOranges** (9): This is a cover I can thankfully stomach.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (9): see comment for HoG

**thedoctordances1940** (9): Another great cover

**throwaway7650** (9): another good (!) cover

**kirby31200** (8.5): I have never liked the original until now, and this song made me finally like it.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): people talked about the Heart of Glass cover a lot when it came out but I don't remember hearing much about this cover, I definitely prefer this one!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): how you do a cover - other singers pls take note

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): my favorite cover from her like, ever

**CrimsonROSET** (8): c'mon cover queen

**relibee2** (8): that GUITAR SOLO

**rickikardashian** (8): we should have payolad Slide Away into this rate

**UselessTacooo** (8): The worse of the two covers. It definitely isn‚Äôt bad by any stretch, but I have heard many covers of this song better than this one

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I like this more than heart of glass but like it‚Äôs still a weaker addition on this album

**Stryxen** (7.5): if one of these covers had to place higher i‚Äôd rather it be this one

#Cranberries stans

**bbfan132** (6.5): it‚Äôs fine but it kind of bored me ngl

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6.5): I feel neutral about this. The song choice technically "fits" Miley‚Äôs vocals better than Heart of Glass, but that make it not as interesting, and I don‚Äôt want Miley‚Äôs legacy to be a competent covers artist churning out above-average karaoke versions

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): not as bad as i feared but still a downgrade from the original

**ImADudeDuh** (6): wow this album really takes a nosedive at the end huh

**Brendon-Urine** (5): her voice doesn‚Äôt fit imo

**CarlieScion** (5): I don‚Äôt even like the original

**frogaranaman** (5): live performance [2]

**IIIHenryIII** (5): The tone of her voice doesn't fit this song at all. Maybe I'm just nitpicking because I'm a big fan of the original.

**seanderlust** (5): idk man i just feel like this song is hard to do right. the original by the cranberries was so entrenched in their experiences in ireland that covers can feel out-of-place. also, when you do a cover your version will inevitably be compared to the original and while the musicians do pretty faithful covers, i think miley's voice loses some of the sweeping qualities of dolores' which makes the original so captivating.

**TiltControls** (5): loses some of the interestingness of the original

**timothy444** (5): A very passable cover of a song that has been covered way too much by other artists

**Leixander** (4): blegh

**plastichaxan** (4): this takes off all the strength the original has‚Ä¶ sad

**ReallyCreative** (4): wasn't huge on the original and Miley tries her best but I just don't enjoy this

**vayyiqra** (4): Another mediocre cover but it's not as patently offensive as her take on "Heart of Glass" is. It isn't that good either though, I fear.

**Awkward\_King** (1): miley tf is this

**wavingwolves** (1): this makes me feel like i'm watching some drunk lady that just got broken up with go off in some random bar's karaoke night while men around me try to get handsy like touch is not a sense i have

**akanewasright** (0): Yeah I hate this lmao

**RandomHypnotica** (0): This is just a trainwreck, it's a cover that not only fails to differentiate itself enough from the original, but does every individual element worse.

**starla\_** (0): i hate this even more than the heart of glass cover. Couldn't even get through it. RIP Dolores O'Riordan
