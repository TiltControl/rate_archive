The first cut of day 2, I honestly think it deserved to be day 1 alongside Golden G String but that's just my onion. I'm not too big on it at all and it's here that I really tune out of the album, so it's not my favourite by any means.

---

#ME!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The amount of honesty in the lyrics with this beat. I’m fully deceased, this is so sad in the best way possible.

**jasannn** (10): This is one of those songs you would sing at karaoke while crying after a breakup.

**jaztinax** (10): i’m glad i don’t relate to this song otherwise i would be sobbing to this every day

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): could Never Be Me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i really love how reflective and honest miley is in this song. i'm a sucker for songs that change the lyrics on the final chorus too

**throwaway7650** (10): this song is so sincere to me, the 2nd best ballad after ALY

**juanolsen** (9): this kinda reminds me of "angels like you" but it's still unique and the twist at the last chorus is great

**NotWith10000Men** (9): the "hard as I try / I play with fire" part is so ethereal

**relibee2** (9): angels like you but with a somewhat happy ending

**1998tweety** (8.5): sobbing emoji

**celladonn** (8.5): That (hard as I try) just gets to me

**UselessTacooo** (8.1): It’s not stellar, but it’s acceptable and I feel like it was a necessity to round out the album

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (8): i think all three albums have parallels about being aware of flaws and certain ones that you can’t change. While Hayley’s and Miley’s are the only two albums about dealing with the collapses of multi year relationships and marriages, it is interesting inverse that Hayley has a song where she talks about being cheated on and also being the other woman while Miley talks about being the adulterar. I really like pairing these albums together and I really like women people talk about how they feel aggrieved by their ex and what wrongs they did to either them or other people.

**runaway3212** (8): I really like how she sounds both secure in knowing who she is, yet insecure in knowing if that's enough for the other person

**skargardin** (8): I want an album full of pop ballads from miley tbh

**seanderlust** (7.2): i like the sense of brutal honesty here. like she's saying i'm not gonna be that stable reliable person so if that's what you're looking for let me save us both some time. say what you want about miley, but through her self-effacing humor she does really show she knows who she is.

**bbfan132** (7): i really like her raspy vocals when it sounds like she’s holding back, it works nicely here

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): brutally honest whew

**ReallyCreative** (7): if you're looking for stable, that'll never be me should be tattooed on my body I fear

**wavingwolves** (6.9): this song has no rights making me feel like such an emotionally undeveloped bitch

#I would NEVER

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (7): Hmm..I should like this but something about this is not clicking.

**fallenriot** (7): another one where i appreciate the lyrics more than the rest of the song

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): if you play with fire, expect to get Burn by Ellie Goulding

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): generic af

**ImADudeDuh** (6): what a generic title for a pretty generic song!

**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): This has the same fuckboy but make it girlboss energy as Bad Karma and Angels Like You, but executed boringly

**CarlieScion** (5.5): a boring ballad

**timothy444** (5): Average

**cremeebrulee** (4): i sleep

**frogaranaman** (4): me when asked if I’ll listen to this song again

**IIIHenryIII** (4): The beginning always makes me think she's dealing with masturbation guilt, which is just funny because I can’t imagine “horny Miley” having any trouble with this.

**Stryxen** (4): the chorus is so unsatisfying

**akanewasright** (3): This song was made to get a very specific kind of person in their feelings. That kind of person could never be me, but the verses are nice at least

**Awkward\_King** (1): me looking at ppl who give high averages because they're nice raters and aren't bitter about the guy who kissed them and then told them they didnt want anything to do with them but then acted like you were going out when you around both your friends and was all cuddly?? wtf was that about dude

This is where the album starts to falter for me, after the smash that is Midnight Sky and where there's just a few too many ballads and not enough bangers or bops. They're not bad at all but simply not my favourite, and I would have never placed this in day 2 lmao. But oh well! The people have spoken and so it shall be.

---

#Hi high hi high

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): Me too though

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The beat during the chorus is too good, it perfectly echoes the lyrics. This was made for backyard sessions, love it.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): in this one, i think the rough delivery works extremely well.

**fallenriot** (10): i think part of the reason i love this one so much is because it sounds like it could be on kesha’s rainbow, i’d die for a kesha cover

**mudkip1** (10): this is one of my faves off the album ugh something about it is magic

**Stryxen** (10): :’)

**relibee2** (9.5): yall shit on this and hate me relentlessly like why they’re both excellent they’re both so underrated

**savemeaseat143** (9.2): I love the country influences on this song and it reminds me of old mid-budget movies set in the countryside.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): it describing the score it got from me (on a scale 1 to 9)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i love the haunting vibe to this song, and the line "you, like a neon light, shining through the door that i can't keep closed" - so oddly specific yet relatable

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): I definitely enjoy how strong her vocals are on this song. A common issue I have with Miley songs is that they bury her voice a bit too much but this one is perfect. I have always found the back had of this album to be worse than the front, but there’s not denying that it’s still very good

**throwaway7650** (8): really great vocal performance by miley here, very emotional

**waluigiest** (8): okay but with a little reworking, an extended “High / Hate Me” cut would be an easy 11

**starla\_** (7.8): the best ballad on this album

**juanolsen** (7.7): i like it but is pales in comparison to the rest of the album

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): the acoustic guitar and the whoas make for a nice slow down moment

**1998tweety** (7): shes cute

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): I know what it feels like to be addicted at something so much that it affects your personal life.

**CarlieScion** (7): kinda cute ngl

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Very intimate generic pop song but still works for me.

#Low

**TiltControls** (7): more like mid

**timothy444** (7): Not one of my favourites

**Ok\_Ant5217** (6.5): hey it's country Miley

**akanewasright** (6): The more I come back to this the more I see that it’s a little generic. But I do think it’s a sweet little moment on the album

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): a bit forgettable to me tbh

**ReallyCreative** (6): it's pleasant but it just doesn't do much for me

**bbfan132** (5): the melody is pleasant but the belting destroys it, it’s painful to hear at times

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (5): I like what this song is about much more then the actual song

**frogaranaman** (5): the pacing of this album throws me for a loop every single time

**runaway3212** (5): This was a bit to slow

**thedoctordances1940** (5): I kinda like this, I kinda don't

**bluetriangles04** (4): Not for me...

**vayyiqra** (4): Oh no she's trying to be yeehaw

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): dope's slightly more wannabe alternative but ultimately very green younger sister

**Roxieloxie** (3): i am really not enjoying the ballads on this album

**wavingwolves** (2): this just finished and i couldn't tell what it sounded like

As a lot of the comments point out, this is quite an edgy title for a song that doesn't actually sound that edgy. I like it quite a bit but it's not something I really listen to at all outside of the context of the album, which I guess I can say for a lot of these shorter Manic tracks to be quite honest. Its charm does get it into day 2, but just barely.

---

#OMG MEEEEEEE!!! ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME ME!!!!!!!!

**CarlieScion** (10): so true queen

**CritneySpearz** (10): I'm in this song and I don’t like it!!!!  This song read my gay ass to filth I’m actually shook

**static\_int\_husp** (10): same

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): As someone who loves everyone but gets hotheaded really quick, I really relate to this. *applies clown make-up*

**fallenriot** (8.5): she came for my neck with this one

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): me at work lately

**Leixander** (8): so true

**juanolsen** (7.7): same sis

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): big mood

**zagreux** (7.4): So true

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): me in a nutshell

**ignitethephoenix** (7): mood but did it need to be written into song form?

#I LOVE EVERYBODY

**waluigiest** (10): I was put off by the edgy title but it’s actually rad

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5):  "Feelin' somethin' like a scaly thing wrapped too tightly 'round my own master" omg I love Snake Eater!!!

**savemeaseat143** (9.3): I don’t think the lyrics are superb but I adore the melody and the fact that it’s a prequel to 3am.

**wavingwolves** (9.1): this represents the bisexual experience so well actually

**akanewasright** (9): Some of these lyrics are just a touch... cloying? Cutesy? But I generally love the production and how it works with the past two tracks

**IIIHenryIII** (9): The transition from Dominic's Interlude to this song is one of the best things I've ever heard by her.

**UselessTacooo** (9): Not what I expected from this song seeing as it’s the most bubblegum production on the album so far. The title made me think Nightmare pt. 2. The chorus is amazing. Like so amazing.

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): its unfair of me to make a memory out of a feeling is a fucking GUTPUNCH of a line and is great

**shesdoingyoga** (8.5): Lyrically this might be one of my favorites from this album

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): When I block everyone on my support system during a suicidal episode.

**jasannn** (8): I'm so glad I grew out of "I hate people" phase.

**timothy444** (8): Loved the transition from Dominic's Interlude to this but other that that, it just reminds me of a nu-Panic! song and I'm not honestly sure that's a good thing.

**rickikardashian** (7.8): the run from forever/dominic’s interlude/IHE is very satisfying for me

**AHSWeeknd** (7): these lyrics are introspective on a great level.

**astrologicalangel** (7): what a title

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7): I really like the lyrics

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok, good job not being terrible, song titled I HATE EVERYBODY in all caps

**NotWith10000Men** (7): "unfair of me to make a memory out of a feeling." "infatuation's observation with a cause." there's some interesting lines in this one

**Stryxen** (7): girl what chill out

**throwaway7650** (7): edgy song title but nice chorus

**1998tweety** (6.5): this does not sounds like what i expected from the title but theres something kind of charming about that

#But maybe I, maybe I don't

**kirby31200** (6.5): The instrumental lets the lyrics down

**seanderlust** (6.3): this song is hit or miss. like the chorus lyrically good but then you get lines like "infatuation is just observation with cause". like girl what? that isn't the good insight you think it is

**bbfan132** (6): nice enough song

**J\_Toe** (6): so I had an idea of Halsey's sound based off Without Me, Bad at Love, and that rainbow song, but I guess I was not on the mark, as this album is more subdued, and tonally different to what I was expecting (especially given the title).

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): why make this title all caps and sound angry when this is the album’s most boring slow song

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i can't be racist i hate everyone xoxo

**mudkip1** (5): this song's fine i guess but if you're gonna add this moody shit to the album then you can add nightmare.

**plastichaxan** (5): the carrying over from the interlude was a good idea but that's about it

**vayyiqra** (5): Edgy title ! Not that edgy a song though

**frogaranaman** (4): this sounds like a song you would hear in a musical from a character who is clearly in the wrong but thinks they are right

**Ok\_Ant5217** (4): wrong aesthetic for these lyrics

**thedoctordances1940** (3.5): The songs alright I guess, but automatic minus points for making a song called I HATE EVERYBODY. It's Halsey at her absolute worst, trying to come off as edgy while also attempting to stay reasonabily endearing through the instrumental and it's just bad.

**brenda\_official** (3): sometimes i also feel like a scaly thing

**ReallyCreative** (3): not a fan of this one, at all

**Hulnia** (1): This is the most boring song here, and trust me there’s some competition.

**runaway3212** (0): This song is both lyrically and instrumentally stupid

I really like the vibes set by the opening of this song with the sample and how the first verse starts, but for me it loses a bit of steam as the track goes along and so it's not really a standout track from Manic. It is a deserving day 2 song though so I'm glad it made it here at least.

#Misandrists

**relibee2** (11): I would love to kill my brothers if that means I won’t constantly wake up in the morning or go in the kitchen during class breaks and see that they ate all the food from the night before (or in general)

**runaway3212** (11): I really wish more of the album was like this. It's so energetic and so fun, tongue in cheek but serious at the same time. I really love it, by far her best songwriting on this album

**AHSWeeknd** (10): It goes so well with Alanis’ Interlude. I just wish it was longer.

**CarlieScion** (10): we Stan misandry

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I love revenge song and I think sampling movies is so cool!  Also I really like the line “tell me pick my battles...but I want to pick em all”

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): I have no notes for this song, it's perfect and I love it, so instead I just want to say that I saw Jennifer's Body for the first time this year and honestly was a bit disappointed, it should have been WAY gayer

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): great song, amazing use of jennifer's body

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.7): Chloe x Halle, Taylor feat. Haim, and Halsey proving that songs about revenge don’t have to sound edgy to be impactful! I appreciate how much this bangs more after listening to it in Dolby Atmos

**savemeaseat143** (9.7): the chorus calls me out

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): yes i'm a Jennifer's Body stan...

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): We stan a misandry anthem!

**UselessTacooo** (9): The instrumental on this song is killer and so are the vocals. This one took a few listens to enjoy, but I’m so happy I have it another chance before submitting my ballot.

**CritneySpearz** (8.5): misandry won periodt

**NotWith10000Men** (8.2): the drums in this are so cool. And the uma thurman part has 100% been changed from the last time I heard this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): this is great.

**cremeebrulee** (8): [ladies we gotta start standing up and begin killing men for no reason](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EfF18CZU4AE5ikq?format=jpg&name=medium)

**fallenriot** (8): i wish it was longer

**Leixander** (8): mis-an-dry

**TiltControls** (8): wasn't a fan of this at first, but after it grew on me I'm really liking it!

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): i can imagine such a killer dance rework of this beat, and the song as it is has been a standout since the first listen

**jasannn** (7.5): iconic intro that the rest of the song doesnt live up to but its still pretty good

**rickikardashian** (7.5): so true

**shesdoingyoga** (7.5): I’m mad this wasn’t longer, this has 10 potential

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): I feel like this had potential to be better but it’s kind of flat

**wavingwolves** (7.3): it's always about jennifer's body but what about jennifer's feelings? smh

**starla\_** (7.2): ~edgy~

**CrimsonROSET** (7): gaslight gatekeep girlboss but make it murder

**kirby31200** (7): Nate Ruess wrote this?

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): logical follow up to a messy straight breakup and a lesbian anthem

**ReallyCreative** (7): a lot of promise with this one but I don't think it ever reached its potential

**Stryxen** (7): i kept forgetting what it sounded like but it clicked when i listened a few times

**1998tweety** (6.5): this bops harder than i remembered. one song im glad is short though cause i dont think it would've done well with more length.

**bbfan132** (6.5): i thought this would be bad but it sounded pretty good! not super memorable but still

#you're KILLING PEOPLE???

**ImADudeDuh** (6.5): the song peaked with the Jennifer’s Body sample sorry about it

**throwaway7650** (6.5): edgy title [2] + a movie monologue doesn't improve a song [2]

**Awkward\_King** (6): :men:

**thedoctordances1940** (6): it's alright ig

**timothy444** (6): Not catchy enough for it to be any higher

**vayyiqra** (6): This is a good (if short) song, though the lyrics are a little edgy for my taste.

**zagreux** (6): The voice note ruined it for me

**seanderlust** (5.7): given the jennifer's body sample, i really wish i liked this more. it just kind of falls flat for me

**frogaranaman** (5): they deserve it tbh

**plastichaxan** (4.5): a song inspired by the masterpiece jennifer's body...and it's this??? ok

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Pretty forgettable.

**Hulnia** (1): Probably the most boring song here, I had to listen to it multiple times to even remember what it sounded like. 😭

No bc I love this track with my whole heart and it's so sad that it's out now. At least it made day 2 but I would have had this top 10, easily. The way it transforms so smoothly from something weird and off-kilter to a whole ass bop gets me pumped every time I listen and the bass is so good. I get why it's a bit controversial but that doesn't mean it doesn't disappoint me!

---

#I'm not lonely baby, I am free

**cremeebrulee** (11): me when i find a studio apartment with a washer/dryer on-site

**bigbigbee** (10): The groans in this are so fantastic. Wish I had a prettier word to describe them!

**fallenriot** (10): ok experimental indie queen!

**shesdoingyoga** (10): This was my favorite on first listen and has held up since

**Stryxen** (10): this is the song that got me hooked on pfa

**waluigiest** (10): the chorus is always in my head it’s so groovy

**wavingwolves** (9.7): we love a FUCK IT I'M SINGLE AND HAPPY anthem

**akanewasright** (9): I really love how the song starts to go hard like 2 minutes in

**IIIHenryIII** (9): ah-ah-ah-ah ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh ah-ah-ah.

**plastichaxan** (9): this is just genius idk how to describe that

**rickikardashian** (9): is this what the cinnamon challenge was about

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): the first bop of the album. i LOVE the video for this, it really elevated the song for me

**vayyiqra** (9): This is a very weird song. Its melody is weird and its structure is weird. Nevertheless, it is Good

**zagreux** (9): As a person who is very much a homebody, I love this song a lot.

**bbfan132** (8.5): that intro sounds like it came straight out of strange mercy and i’m ok with that

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8.5): hey look a new phobia, explains the aaaåâœeööÖØŒ

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a good dance-a-plenty song to listen

**Awkward\_King** (8): idk how better to describe the melody of this song other than that it sounds wrong?? it sounds like someone is playing a song in reverse?? but it works?? and i really like it

**CrimsonROSET** (8): remember when the cinnamon challenge was a thing? god how did multiple people not die because of it

**jaztinax** (8): honestly lowkey a bop but i’ve grown to like the “ooooohh ah ah ah ah” in the chorus less each time i listen to this

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): a bop

**throwaway7650** (8): really casual/carefree song and lyrics that strangely work

**jasannn** (7.5): I love the bass in the chorus

**runaway3212** (7.5): I like cinnamon

**timothy444** (6.5): pleasant

#Why is it spicy???

**savemeaseat143** (7.8): intense. I don’t think I see what everyone else sees in it.

**astrologicalangel** (7.5): this is very strange and disjointed, but I am vibing

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): bops but like why did the chorus have to be so lazy

**relibee2** (7.1): this is like fine I guess.

**1998tweety** (7): it's the way this song progressively gets amazing and legitimately could be a 10 but then she has to do that weird moaning thing and tank it

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it’s so all over the place but it’s still good.

**frogaranaman** (7): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cyk7utV_D2I

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): nice little groove, but my enjoyment of this really rides on the “ooh-ahh”s and honestly those aren’t my favorite here

**NotWith10000Men** (6.3): same as simmer basically. Chorus is cool with all the oooohs but I don't care for the rest

**UselessTacooo** (6): I swear I’ve made this same production on garage band before. The drums are way to loud and it setsthe whole mood of it off.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.5): This is just pretty annoying

**celladonn** (4): Sorry Hayley this isn't it

**ReallyCreative** (4): she sounds like a rejected emergency warning broadcast horn

**J\_Toe** (2): I've never said this about a song before, but that sucked

**ImADudeDuh** (1): https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/thebluescluesencyclopedia/images/2/29/Blues-Clues-Cinnamon-character-art-And-You.png/revision/latest?cb=20200523161034 you know you that bitch when you cause all this conversation

**mudkip1** (1): I don’t get what people see in this at all

**Brendon-Urine** (0): nothing comes together on this song imo - the drums sound SO out of place, and the different vocal effects and background vocals sound… bad. Real bad.

This is a track with a pretty interesting sentiment I guess, and although it's not my favourite I like the chorus a decent amount. Above Cinnamon though? Prison honey...

---

#Love me

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This always throughs me off, Miley’s tone seriously sells this on an another level like it’s sad at but the vocal delivery is positive.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of my favorite deep cuts here. It breaks my heart a bit

**relibee2** (10): I wish this song was longer with like the hate me part repeated a few more times with the instrumentals slowly building up and then the chorus again and then the actual outro I feel like the song would be liked a lot more that way

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my second favourite song from the album and it does not get enough love!! it made me so emotional the first few times listening to it, especially that final verse. ugh.

**UselessTacooo** (10): Beautiful. I never got over this song and don’t think I ever will.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this is her after Anthony Fantano reviewed SHE IS COMING

**jaztinax** (9): this is a grown up hannah montana song and you can’t convince me otherwise

**savemeaseat143** (9): “I hope that it’s enough to make you cry” oof

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Not to have like every other comment from me be “I wish this was longer” but I wish this was just a little bit longer, even though it works as is

**wavingwolves** (9): this feels like a bside from here we go again by demi but edgier (non derogatory)

**NotWith10000Men** (8.8): I love how the last line of the chorus builds and builds

**throwaway7650** (8.5): wild that this was written after miley almost got in a plane crash

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8.4): "I hope all of my friends get drunk and high" makes the entire song honestly, funeral goals!!

**akanewasright** (8): I love Hannah Montana‘s cover of Smoking Section by St. Vincent!

**Awkward\_King** (8): same girl

**CarlieScion** (8): bops

**musical\_pyn** (8): I really wish there was one more chorus at the end

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): is it bad that I thought this wasn't about the media at first 💀

**waluigiest** (8): okay but with a little reworking, an extended “High / Hate Me” cut would be an easy 11

#Ellie Goulding stans

**1998tweety** (7.5): this is alright, the very end of the chorus is great though.

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): the chorus gets kinda tiring after a few listens, but her singing sounds amazing overall

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Yeah these are some Miley lyrics

**CrimsonROSET** (7): like i get the feeling but no i don't want my funeral to be a party?? i hope people will be sad i died is that selfish???

**frogaranaman** (7): why the fuck could I not stop thinking of that Ellie Goulding song when listening to this

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): I also think about how people would feel if I died a lot, but if I wrote a song about it that would probably be a lot more depressing lol

**Stryxen** (7): i don’t hate it!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): good but I ain't vibing with this

**cremeebrulee** (6): hate me hate me still tryna replace me chase me chase me tell me how you hate me erase me erase me wish you never dated me lies tell me lies baby tell me how you hate me

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I don't skip it when listening to the album, but it is a very forgettable track. Fillery.

**fallenriot** (5.5): the lyrics are really interesting but something about the rest of it doesn’t completely do it for me

**starla\_** (5.3): probably the most forgettable song on the album

**bbfan132** (5): really boring

**pat-rickstar** (5): Pretty meh on this, can never remember what it sounds like after it's finished

**timothy444** (5): Honestly sounds like filler

**runaway3212** (4): Yeah this isnt good

**seanderlust** (0): it feels like they were going for old-school country sounds and completely missed and created something grating and that doesn't want to commit to serious, sentimental, or cutting.

This is an absolutely heartbreaking track with some deeply personal lyrics and stunning production to match, it's a bit much to listen to but it's really great nonetheless. It's so wonderful that Halsey will soon be able to be a wonderful mother to her child even after all this.

---

#Gimme More

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (11): As someone who had a big brother who died inside my mother's womb, this song really hits hard. I can't imagine how painful it was that Halsey suffered several miscarriages. I wonder how my life would be different if I had a big brother helping me navigate this world just like how Halsey sang this song about her unborn baby. I like to imagine that he is actually growing up in the clouds and I my unborn kuya (big brother) is proud of me.

**1998tweety** (10): It still sends me that ARMY originally thought that this song would feature all of BTS and then it ended up being about Halsey's miscarriage

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This is so sad why am I crying in the club.

**akanewasright** (10): I genuinely think this is the best song Halsey has ever done. I am a gay man who isn’t looking into becoming a parent at all, but this song makes me cry every time I hear it. It doesn’t linger, it ends with a note of hope (and a real life happy ending), and it’s sonically pretty interesting.

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I really appreciate how more women are Being open about fertility issues and miscarriages whether it’s Halsey or Natti Natasha. I really love the intro

**fallenriot** (10): absolutely heart-wrenching, i’m so happy she’s doing better now

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): I'm not crying you're crying

**RandomHypnotica** (10): oh my god this song... so heartbreaking but so gorgeous. It's a lot easier to listen to knowing she's pregnant now, listening to this when it released would've destroyed me

**Roxieloxie** (10): im not a super maternalistic person but any song about being a parent especially in that pre paternal stage will fuck me up dsfksdf, Listening to this now knowing that she's about to have her kid really soon is very lovely

**runaway3212** (10): this really hits

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): Listening to this after Halsey’s pregnancy announcement makes me overwhelmed with happiness for her! <3

**savemeaseat143** (10): makes me want to cry, especially now that she’s expecting.

**timothy444** (10): Amazingly deep and emotional that hits on another level

**relibee2** (9.5): can this be longer I want more of this

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): I really like this but it hurts too much to listen to

**UselessTacooo** (9.4): this. song. is. so. amazing. It’s so simple but I love every second of it. Halsey said this the most personal song on the album and I can tell. The way she sings “MOOOOOOOOOOOOOOORE” hits so hard and I don’t really know why.

**NotWith10000Men** (9.2): I think I cried like the first five times I heard this song. I'm so so happy for her now

**ElizabethDDoS** (9): She's going to be a wonderful mother.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (9): best track mostly because of the subject matter and how well it aged

**throwaway7650** (9): really beautiful song once the lyrics hit. hoping for a safe delivery!

**seanderlust** (8.5): this is super sweet! the contrast of the twinkling music box and the deeper synths makes for a really interesting soundscape

**celladonn** (8): I'm so happy for her, she's going to be such a good mother

**CrimsonROSET** (8): good on her

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): beautiful song but i can't listen to it often because it's so heavy but omg i'm so happy halsey was happy to finally conceive and wish her all the best. it took my parents 8 years to have me bc of my mum's struggles w infertility so this song just hits hard.

**wavingwolves** (8): i don't even know what to say besides i'm really happy for her now

**cremeebrulee** (7.5): wait has halsey had her baby yet? either way this song hits different now

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): see F//bs review

**IIIHenryIII** (7): The most “Halsey” track on the album.

**thedoctordances1940** (7): I do like it, it just feels like there could be more here.

**vayyiqra** (7): The story behind this song is so sad :hanawinsCries:

**waluigiest** (7): lyrics great. melodies not great

**kirby31200** (6): Slides off the brain

**musical\_pyn** (6): hook is a little underwhelming

**starla\_** (5.8): a lot of these songs are a little...boring

**bbfan132** (5): the lyrics are sweet but this is way too dull for me sonically

**ImADudeDuh** (5): oh, now i know why people don’t like Chosen Family

**Stryxen** (5): it happened i forgot it it was over

**Hulnia** (3): Pretty cute and heartfelt song, still a boring one though. :)

**ReallyCreative** (3): I love the message of this song but... I just don't think it was executed smoothly. It is not pleasant on the ears. Somehow despite the subject material, it's one of the weakest songs on this album lyrically. I do not enjoy giving this song this score but it just did not do a thing for me.

The closer for disc 2 of PFA, Why We Ever finds itself right about in the middle of the rate results. It's the album's final moment of hurt before disc 3 comes with its acceptance and growth bops, and it does its role very well imo. I love the bass on it so much (as with a lot of the album), but I'm not too shocked it is finding itself out here. 

---

#I just wanna talk about it

**musical\_pyn** (11): The first half of this song is a 10, and the ending elevates this to my favorite track on the album and this rate

**Raykel** (11): Love it when the piano comes in. The lyrics about wanting to talk to someone but are too embarrassed about the thing that has made you 2 not talk in the first place is very real. You feel so stuck in that position and the sadness that comes with it is captured really well with the piano coming in.

**fallenriot** (10): the outro made me bawl the first time i heard it

**frogaranaman** (10): the guitar in the chorus!!!!!

**Leixander** (10): was going to be my original 11, love everything on this.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i didn't expect to love this as much as i did, but i love the beat switch, and it just sounds so warm and beautiful

**Stryxen** (10): (but really an 11) this breaks my heart every single time i get to the last half, the vulnerable peak of the album and every song prior just culminates into this quiet simmer of desperation

**waluigiest** (10): the “open your mouth say something warm” intro is calling back to Sudden Desire, both lyrically and melodically. It’s a connection between the end of Act 1 and the end of Act 2. It just ties the whole story together, and chronicles the rising and falling of relationships in such a tender way. This album is art.

**wavingwolves** (10): the switch up on this is HEAVENLY

**bbfan132** (9): this is the shit i really like! the rhythm <3

**bluetriangles04** (9): I am a side 2 stan, as you can tell… This song is just so beautiful and telling of the relationships Hayley experienced prior/during the album and the emotional reckoning that came after.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): TALK ABOUT IT! talking about it is always the best answer!

**skargardin** (9): Thinking about all the lost friendships over the years woeis

**zagreux** (9): The *I spent the weekend at home again, drawing circles on the floor / Tried to keep myself from hurting, I don't know why anymore* part makes me cry every time :sob:

**jasannn** (8.5): I love these slow jams (e.g. All That). It's so smooth. The outro does drag on a little but I guess its necessary in the case of the album.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8.5): I can't seem to remember this track from the last time I listened to the album but love it anyway

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): I think this album would be a lot better if Hayley leaned more into this specific indie pop/soft rock sound

**runaway3212** (8.5): Cd 1 wish it had this

**starla\_** (8.5): lovely

**juanolsen** (8.4): this one is hitting different lately

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a great song to chill at

**ImADudeDuh** (8): call me a twitter local cause the vibes are immaculate

**1998tweety** (7.5): chill nice background music

**throwaway7650** (7.5): the piano is the highlight of this like that one halsey song

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): wasn’t feeling this till the piano took over, but it really starts hitting when that happens halfway in

#more like why we never

**mudkip1** (8): this was good til it dragged on for the last minute  and a half

**UselessTacooo** (8): I got bored. Sorry not sorry?

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): Funkyyy bass. The end isn't great though

**AHSWeeknd** (7): it gets repetitive in the second half but it’s good in the first half.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6.5): me five minutes after listening to this song: I can't seem to remember

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Mixed feelings (?) I feel awful for not liking this as I should.

**jaztinax** (6): there’s this sound in the chorus that always caused an immediate reaction in me to check my phone bc it sounded like a timer went off so that confused me. harmonies on point tho

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I'm not usually a fan of slow jams but I like the first half of this one. Not sure what's going on with what feels like a different song on the end

**timothy444** (6): I almost got bored listening to this but then the piano bit hit… still though, that doesn't excuse the song for essentially being another ballad.

**J\_Toe** (4): I personally found it dull

**sweetnsoursauce11** (4): hate to be the stereotypical popheads ballad-phobia but this is on the boring side. starts good tho

**Brendon-Urine** (3.5): a snoozer.

**NapsAndNetflix** (3): This album is really made for you to be like sitting in a bay window on a rainy day sad over a heartbreak, in which I can respect, but simply giving me sad adult contemporary energy isn't enough to make it interesting in any way

The controversial second single from Plastic Hearts, Prisoner sees Miley collaborating with Dua in a song that I actually really like - the melodies are so good and I don't mind the bass-focused production. However, I definitely do understand why people wanted this to be something more, and thus why it's a Day 2 cut despite being a single and collaboration with a subreddit darling.

---

#DULA PEEP

**AHSWeeknd** (11): I’ve blasted this song way too many times but it’s what it deserves. Miley and Dua make an amazing duo, their ability to sell passionate vocals is next level. This is probably a day one out but it’s insanely good.

**Hulnia** (11): While it doesn’t really fit the album at all, it’s such a perfect song. The only complaint I have is that it should be longer. 😩

**Awkward\_King** (10): and then i freaked it

**frogaranaman** (10): absolute banger

**jaztinax** (10): is it possible to give this a 10.5... i remember being underwhelmed the first two times i heard this but after i got over that i became soooo obsessed. brb playing this 10 times in a row

**nootnoot781** (10): no thoughts, just the music video 2

**outsideeyess** (10): purely for miley's verse, her voice has never sounded so good and so angsty godDAMN

**plastichaxan** (10): i don't know why y'all hate this it's a bop and i'll speak my truth

**throwaway7650** (10): I get how people find this underwhelming and I agree that it doesn't really have a climax but miley and dua complement each other so well. but it being a bit longer (3+ minutes) would still be nice

**timothy444** (10): Would've been an 11 if Shawn Mendes was on this track instead.

**TragicKingdom1** (9.5): i can feel my wrist limpening when i listen to this

**endcreditouilles** (9.4): I love everything about this song but it's just missing something. Miley absolutely kills it on her verse, I could use more of that for sure.

**Ok\_Ant5217** (9): desperately needed a third verse but it's an 80s throwback so respect

**vayyiqra** (9): At last some retro new wave on this album that's good ! If the whole album were like this, I would think it's a very good album !

**UselessTacooo** (8.6): When I first heard this song I was incredibly disappointed but I think I have seen the light. While the chorus still disappoints me a bit I can’t help but love the rest of it.

**1998tweety** (8.5): this would be a 10 with a better chorus. Dua being on 2 songs that sample Physical within a year is really weird too.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is a bop but it just feels out of place on the album and it’s just weaker compared to other things on here

**jasannn** (8.5): Duayola at it again.

**kirby31200** (8.5): This is the perfect bridge between Future Nostalgia and this album

**pat-rickstar** (8.5): Bop but the verses do outshine the chorus

**rickikardashian** (8.5): this is actually a political song about the United States private prison system

**IIIHenryIII** (8): What's up with Dua and all these awesome basslines in her songs?

**J\_Toe** (8): the most radio song on the album. While I prefer the more unusual tracks, this is still fun. Though Dua's continued invocation of Olivia Newton Jones is hilarious.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): a bit basic but a bop is a bop 🤷🏻‍♀️

**mudkip1** (8): I used to think this was bad but then I grew on it like a lot

**shesdoingyoga** (8): It’s been said many times but the verses are good and the chorus falls a little flat in comparison, but overall I still enjoy it

**Stryxen** (8): super catchy but it feels like they’re doing two different songs at some points

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i know this song wasn't super popular on popheads but its still a fun song

**thedoctordances1940** (8): Took me a bit to get into as it was originally released but I think that was more because I was just really bitter at Miley at the time, but once I got past that, it's a good song. Dua's vocal performance is a bit weak at times, but more than anything that's because there's a very strong contrast to Miley's raspy voice which just works so much better.

**savemeaseat143** (7.7): Sounds like a combination of every song on this album and every song on FN.

**CarlieScion** (7.5): I overplayed this and now its simply good instead of great

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): i could not recognize when they swapped at points

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): between this and Physical, Dua really had Olivia Newton-John on the brain in 2020 huh?

#I can't...

**NotWith10000Men** (7.1): it's a nice bop but needs just a little bit more umph

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): y'all would've ignored this if it was shawn mendes on here instead of dua (also am i the only one that thinks the verses sound like a more rock version of the verses from S&M?)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): fits well but not the best

**waluigiest** (7): I feel like they really tried to push this, and it also had a lot of potential, but it’s just too average

**wavingwolves** (7): this is a better song than midnight sky even though it sounds like a parody

**starla\_** (6.8): I actually don't love this song as much as I thought I would on first listen. It's kinda...basic. Still good though

**bbfan132** (6.5): if this was dua on her own, it would be higher… (i promise i don’t dislike miley, i just feel like her voice sounds so rough on this record so far)

**ReallyCreative** (6): much like the Earth, it's shocking how flat this is

**fallenriot** (5): just kinda boring tbh, the sample couldn’t save it

**akanewasright** (4): I’m of two minds about this song. I don’t hate it for sure - in fact, I sort of like it a little. It’s kind of an ambition of mine to perform this with someone and make it even more homoerotic than this version lol. But... whenever I listen to the album, after Angels Like You, I get hype to hear Gimme What I Want, and then I hear this and deflate a little.

**astrologicalangel** (4): it's fine I guess

**musical\_pyn** (4): This is such a disappointing song

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the way this is one of the worst songs on the album but because it featured Dua Lipa, the gays ate it up

**Brendon-Urine** (2): this song baffles me, Dua Lipa’s physical is right there??? Both have similar sounds/the same interpolation and one is WAY better…

**runaway3212** (2): flop

**TiltControls** (2): I've been locked out of a good album listening to this

**zagreux** (2): This song feels too short and Dua doesn't bring any energy to it. I prefer the Shawn version.

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): This screams "Future Nostalgia reject" and I don't like Future Nostalgia that much. I feel like I've heard this song a million times, a million times, why can't you just, can't you just come up with something more original omfg...

**cremeebrulee** (0): please this collaboration is so boring i can’t believe it was put on 2 different albums. i get that it interpolates “physical” but miley and dua sound so bored on it that it feels so uninspired. i tried listening to this a couple of times to see if i could like it, but i fear it still doesn’t do anything for me. the weeknd and the US incarceration system outsold

**letsallpoo** (0): manifesting extremely negative and wicked energy toward dua lipa. i have spent 12 hours secretly thinking terrible thoughts about dua lipa in the hopes it will cause her grievous harm. my "dua lipa hate manifestation journal" is now 54 pages in length

At long last, the Heart of Glass cover falls. This was included because not only is it on the standard tracklist but also it had a viral moment around when the album was being released so it felt apt as a representation of what Miley was up to at this time. I think she does a pretty good job here tbqh, I don't have any sort of connection to the original (though it's obviously a good song) so I'm not bothered by her rockier take on it. I think she has undeniable stage presence even if you're not a fan of this style or her vocals, and that's why this cover did as well as it did in both the rate and across social media.

---

#It was divine

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Of course icon, legend and star Debbie Harry’s original has its own essence but this cover works so well with the beat.

**Awkward\_King** (10): WHANTHAIYDDLAAAVANDIHTWAZAGUAASSS

**CarlieScion** (10): idc idc this is so good

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is for /u/ElizabethDDOS

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): Amazing vocal delivery by Miley.

**endcreditouilles** (10): this is just such a fun cover, Miley is giving 110% on energy and personality

**NotWith10000Men** (10): her voice was fucking made for this song

**rickikardashian** (10): whoever uploaded this performance to twitter did more for this era than Miley's team

**runaway3212** (10): love this so much

**throwaway7650** (10): love this going viral for miley. she truly has the voice of a rocker and I'm so excited for future covers

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I love the original and I still like this! Is it Debbie Harry? No! Is it still a good version? Yeah!

**thedoctordances1940** (9.5): I've seen a lot of people say they don't like these covers at the end, but I really do. The original by Blondie is already great and this absolutely lives up to it. While she doesn't do anything inventive with it, it's still a great cover that highlights what makes Miley's voice so special in the current popsphere.

**bluetriangles04** (9): A beautiful rendition of the original.

**CrimsonROSET** (9): this is like midnight sky but better?

**jasannn** (9): ugh that instrumental bridge to the NANANANANANA. amazing

**Ok\_Ant5217** (9): one of the best female performers right now no doubt

**seanderlust** (9): my favorite of the two covers here. her voice sounds right in the song, and of course the song itself is a classic.

**TiltControls** (9): it's a fun cover!

**UselessTacooo** (9): Miley’s voice was made for this song and she always seems like she loves performing it, so I have always like it

**relibee2** (8.5): I don’t normally give covers a try but this one is actually really good.

**fallenriot** (8): another victim of me overplaying, but god does miley kill these covers

**juanolsen** (8): great cover and reimagination of the original

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): I'm not usually a big fan of covers but both of these songs really suit Miley

**Saison\_Marguerite** (8): To some this might “rock” more than the original Blondie version, to other it completely missed the point of the song and took the style out of it. I think there’s space for both because they’re so different.

**waluigiest** (8): While it doesn’t have the magic that the original has, it’s still fun and a huge banger. Defined the late summer/early fall 2020 imo

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): pretty well-crafted cover

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7): I find the “mucho mistrust” so awkward

**Stryxen** (7): yes it bops but this can’t fucking win :sob:

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i don't love this but you can hear how much fun she's having

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): Miley sounds good here but I don't think she does enough to make the cover sound unique from the orginal

**akanewasright** (6.5): This is... different from the original version, but I don’t hate it

#I was losing my mind

**savemeaseat143** (7): I like the Blondie version better

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): her r/music moment…. she’s fine here but its nothing special when the original is similarly good

**ignitethephoenix** (6): sorry this cover is not it. Like making this song with hard rock vocals doesnt work for me.

**Leixander** (6): kimbryelling doesn't really suit miley to be honest

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is better than half the album [2] and its still not even that good

**astrologicalangel** (5): I like the backing track, but Miley's voice sounds strained. It sounds like she's hurting her voice to get an extra 'rock' sound she doesn't need

**frogaranaman** (5): live performance

**timothy444** (5): She does not do it justice to the original…

**1998tweety** (4): something about this feels a bit off, shes oversinging a lot.

**bbfan132** (4): the constant belting ruined it for me, sorry

**IIIHenryIII** (3): Too much screaming.

**wavingwolves** (3): we should rate parallel lines

**ImADudeDuh** (1): i have decided i hate this cover. Really ruins the emotion of the original. Miley screams over a song and people must stan

**letsallpoo** (1): the miley cyrus karaoke era was difficult to stomach

**RandomHypnotica** (1): This cover is just NOT GOOD! I don't get it! It's missing all the subtlety and smoothness that made the original work so well.

**starla\_** (1): i'm sorry i hate this cover. Debbie Harry has such a light angelic voice and Miley does not.

**ElizabethDDoS** (0): This is an insurmountable insult to Debbie Harry.

**ManofOranges** (0): I absolutely HATE this omg. Like normally I'm not to just outright hate a song but Miley's delivery is just sacrilege to me like I feel like it goes against everything Debbie Harry was going for when she sang this song originally. To think that there are people that enjoy this cover truly boggles my mind. To quote the iconic comment on Heart of Glass from the disco rate, more like "fart of ass"

**skargardin** (0): idk what she did with her vocals here honestly

**vayyiqra** (0): "[I]f there's any diehard Debbie Harry stans out there, now's your chance to let the world know how much you hate Miley's version!" yeah that's me, I hate this. It's not that it's awful in of itself, it's that she sings it terribly, and it's in that uncanny valley of being both too much like the original but just different enough that it feels wrong. I know this cover got a lot of acclaim, but I really find this unbearable. (Also I'm not *that* big a Blondie stan but would guess I am much closer to that than most of Popheads is.)

Here's the biggest song in the rate, the song that hit #1, became one of the most successful songs not only of the last decade but also EVER, and seemingly influenced the change of course in how Manic was shaped as a whole. It's always been a bit controversial I think, with quite a few people really hating it, some liking it a lot, while others just find it mid. I really do like it, I think it's ridiculously catchy and the trap production works well here. Does it deserve to be such a massive hit, especially over some of her other tracks? I don't think so, but I'm not upset at it.

---

#If they laugh then fuck 'em all

**vayyiqra** (11): Should I write a comment on this? The guidelines for this rate say they aren't required this time. Good, because I have nothing to say. This is a basic take, but it's a good song. That's all there is to it. Simple.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Honestly a great song.

**CarlieScion** (10): iconic, a cultural reset, a moment most pleasing to me

**ManofOranges** (10): I actually do very much enjoy this song, and I always have. I think it's a little stupid as well, but when has that ever stopped me from liking a song before? Never.

**runaway3212** (10): this song singlehandedly changed how i viewed halsey

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I’ve played this song more than any other song in the rate, so it should probably be my 11. Though I think Dead Horse did the same theme a bit better, I stand by Without Me being a solid 10. I love the underwater sounding production, it’s slick and polished in the right way, while delivering genuine seething emotion from Halsey, and it has a pretty melody that is full of hooks. It was the perfect winter hit IMO. The Juice Wrld remix slaps too!! His verse added more flavour than the Justin Timberlake interpolation that I’m honestly neutral about.

**timothy444** (10): Hated this when it was overplayed to death but now I can appreciate this bop.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): bring back trap pop NOW!!

**Roxieloxie** (9.7): bop

**jaztinax** (9.5): this might be overplayed but the melody is ON POINT. john mayer wasn’t wrong about this one

**shesdoingyoga** (9.5): This absolutely deserved the success it got

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): Her best song!

**bluetriangles04** (9): If I had to rate this song a few years ago, I would have scored it lower because of its status as an overplayed radio single due to its blowup; listening to it now it’s a lot more enjoyable for me.

**cremeebrulee** (9): this one is for /u/wavingwolves

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): I like how the previous song 3am ended with John Mayer's voicenote to Halsey about Without Me's success and the boom, this song plays. I feel like Mayer's part was added to justify Without Me's placement on the album, which really works tbh.

**Stryxen** (9): I really like her voice on this and it suits the minimalistic instrumental but it could just do a bit more.

**waluigiest** (9): I feel a warm nostalgia for this song because it was getting big right when I started following popheads :’)

**1998tweety** (8.5): this is cute. not my fav song on the album but it has its moments.

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Yeah I think this is the right score for this, I'm starting to get why it was a massive hit, but at the same time it still doesn't quite seem interesting enough for that. It is however definitely a really fantastic vocal melody and Halsey's raw voice works sounds great here.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): pretty sad and it introduced me to her

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I know overplay might have killed this for a lot of people, but I really haven’t heard it THAT much and still really enjoy it.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): Eminem outsold.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the way this is her biggest song behind Closer

**juanolsen** (8): i like it but it's clear that this wasn't meant to be part of the album

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): fuck G-Eazy all my homies hate G-Eazy

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): power of a trap beat

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i feel like this is such a weird song to be her biggest but anyway. enjoyable song, never loved it but i won't skip it if it comes on.

**UselessTacooo** (8): we all know this song. It didn’t need to be on this album in any way, shape or form. I like the song but if feel like it breaks the flow in some way. I will never stop yelling the “TELL ME HOW’S IT FEEEELLL!” part whenever it comes on

#G-Eazy stans

**savemeaseat143** (7.5): I was never super into it and having to hear it on the radio all the time didn’t do any favours

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7): You cannot convince me this song would be on the album of it wasn’t a huge single.  I also find it’s placement in the track list odd.  But also lyrically it’s never made sense to me since her ex had collabed with Britney before then so I really didn’t get the idea she boosted his career even if I would say she’s more successful.

**fallenriot** (7): this song annoyed the shit out of me for some reason when i heard it on the radio, but it grew on me a lot in the context of the album (which is weird because i don’t think it was actually supposed to be a part of it lmao)

**NotWith10000Men** (7): it has a good beat and it's fun to sing along to but my god I've heard this every day for a hundred years

**throwaway7650** (7): I can see how this became a hit but it's quite... bland

**rickikardashian** (6.8): i find it weird how a song this huge was so unremarkable

**kirby31200** (6.5): This is your best song? Honey...

**seanderlust** (6.4): how's john mayer gonna say this is halsey's best song when literally the song before this one is better

**bbfan132** (6): well, sorry to that one dude but this is definitely not her best song

**mudkip1** (6): i heard this 8-10 times a day on the radio back when this was popular. its good but im tired of it now

**TiltControls** (6): its a fine song, but the rest of the album is so much better

**starla\_** (5.1): i wish this weren't on the album, it really doesn't fit IMO

**CrimsonROSET** (5): if anyone tries saying 'oh they're only tanking this because of todd' again i'm going to kill a man

**devilonmytongue0** (4): this was the only one i realllllly did not like lols

**frogaranaman** (4): when she sings the “li-i-i-ive without me” it sounds like her mouth gets closed and gritted like halfway thru

**Hulnia** (4): There was definitely potential here, but the production ruins it all for me.

**Awkward\_King** (2): it's just occuring to me i've... i've never heard this song before??? and its kinda doing absolutely nothing for me??? (ok update, i just listened to the juice wrld version and significantly prefer that)

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): I pretty vocally disliked Halsey until the Manic era (apart from iconic smash hit Closer), so when this was released I couldn't stand her still. I will admit I'm probably biased in that I probably could have went in with a more open mind when this came out, but I have always hated this song. Paired with the fact it was really everywhere for a bit, the overplay made it more unbearable for me.

**sssaaage** (0): honestly this is probably one of my most hated songs that i can think of currently, literally everything about it is so grating.. like i dont even care that its inoffensive its actually so bad

**wavingwolves** (0): i could do without you in this album yeah

Boygenius stans rise up! I honestly did not expect this to do as well as it did, I thought it might have been lower down tbh but I'm pleasantly surprised because this is pleasant enough. Not my fave on the album, but I'll take any Hayley track doing better than expected because I thought she would flop far more!

---

#Vote for the Boygenius rate

**bluetriangles04** (11): The bridge specifically reminds me of Paramore-esque ballads such as We Are Broken, just music that I really enjoy in a more indie poppified state.

**juanolsen** (11): the production on this song is simply beautiful,  also Hayley really outdid herself with the lyrics in this one although  she has always been a great lyricist and last but not least shootout to boygenius

**zagreux** (11): I love this song so much. I've had a long and hard journey with self-love and self-acceptance and Roses/Lotus/Violet/Iris perfectly encapsulates that. It hesitantly tells a story of regrowth and doesn't avoid the dark corners while doing so. There might not be any sweeping, feel-good, generalized statements here but it's a soothing, comforting empowerment anthem to me nonetheless ~~also my 4th most scrobbled song on lastfm yes~~

**AHSWeeknd** (10): That BEAT. Honestly snapped.

**akanewasright** (10): This is simply lovely. The lyrics are some of the best in the rate imo

**avg-vag** (10): this was my absolute most played song of 2020

**Awkward\_King** (10): i love the whole song but i wish i could just play hayley singing "roses roses roses roses roses" on loop, its heavenly

**celladonn** (10): The highlight of the album. Musically and lyrically gorgeous

**fallenriot** (10): this one has some of my favorite lines from her entire career, “i will not become a thorn in my own side???” thats fucking killer

**mudkip1** (10): YAAAAAAAAAAS BOYGENIUS FUCK IT UP

**rickikardashian** (10): [roses roses roses roses roses (roses roses roses roses roses)](https://i.imgflip.com/56fmty.png)

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): ladies ladies ladies ladies ladies

**Stryxen** (10): i don’t trust a man who doesn’t like this album cos nobody asks for their opinion on this lmao

**wavingwolves** (9.8): and with this hayley cemented herself as the fourth member of boygenius we love her!! btw stream salt in the wound please and thank you

**runaway3212** (9.5): Almost as beautiful as the flowers it's describing

**seanderlust** (9.5): *tiffany pollard voice* BOYGENIUS?! BOYGENIUS?!

**starla\_** (9.5): this is beautiful!!

**throwaway7650** (9.5): boygenius supremacy! stream *boygenius*

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): I adore everything here but the chorus, but even that isn’t that bad. I could get behind this song if the chorus had a bit more to it but other than that I enjoy this song.

**ReallyCreative** (9.1): tag yourselves, I'm a pansy

**1998tweety** (9): wait this is actually really good

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): such a beautiful song

**timothy444** (9): feminism

**waluigiest** (9): they fit an impressive amount of iconic literary references to flowers in this song without it feeling bloated

**bbfan132** (8.5): this is so relaxing to listen to, i could put this on repeat for hours

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a great track about femininity and womanhood.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i was gonna make a 'he loves me, he loves me not' comment then she referenced it in the song so now i'm stuck uhhhhhh i like flowers

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (8): I love the songwriting here. This is one of the songs that highlighted the album's theme and message of embracing feminity the strongest.

**Leixander** (8): radiohead found suing as we speak [2]

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): pretty pretty pretty song 😊

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): tbh the title should have been Roses/Violet/Lotus/Iris but cool track anyway

**thedoctordances1940** (8): pretty pretty

**relibee2** (7.6): the violin that comes in later in the song makes it a lot better

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (7): I love flowers so much, but also at some point this seemed more like a monologue to me.  I do think it fits the album perfectly and I like that it namechecks a later track.

**frogaranaman** (7): the chorus of this song is so weird but cool

#allergic to flowers

**jackisboredtoday** (7): i want to stan this bc Hayley + boygenius should be everything but this song needs a bit more kick

**CarlieScion** (6.2): I know the lyrics are #deep but I just can’t get into it

**NotWith10000Men** (6): I'm not a fan of the main vocals being so repetitive in the chorus but I love the background vocals doing it

**jaztinax** (5.5): ma’am pick one flower and stick with it

**ManofOranges** (5): Roses are red, violets are blue... I can't come up with a punchline for this

**pat-rickstar** (5): Kind of boring

**RandomHypnotica** (5): this song really just... lingers

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This is not good enough to be this long. I'm sorry Hayley, but this is just boring.

**letsallpoo** (3): hayley williams you will never be let into boygenius

**NapsAndNetflix** (2): the chorus is kind of obnoxious and the verses dont save it enough for me to like this. Possibly if it was shorter it would be enjoyable but she really is out here repeating the word roses for five and a half minutes? Typically we stan long song lengths but perhaps the evergrowing effects of streaming on the music industry made points

This was a grower for me, I didn't really like it a lot until the rate started, but now it's upper tier on PFA for me. The chorus is so good, one of the album's best, but I can see why some people are offput by the vocals at the beginning of the song.

---

#I bloom just for you

**Leixander** (11): the intro is nothing short of perfection and the changes in her voice as the song goes on never fails to give me chills

**Awkward\_King** (10): me when im blooming but it is no it isn't a secret

**juanolsen** (10): the lyrics here are great

**ManofOranges** (10): Unsure if I really like this song or if I'm just desperate for some songs that I really truly like on this album.

**waluigiest** (10): this should have been the album closer. Perfect summation of the themes of the album while highlighting her upward trajectory. And the flower motif again??? It works!

**wavingwolves** (9.2): hayley i could watch you clip your boyfriend's toenails on a instagram live and still feel thankful just tell me when and how and i will watch you do anything

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this is a pretty good song about blooming out of something

**jaztinax** (9): another underrated song by miss hayley. she truly is blooming!!

**LuisEnRod** (9): the bridge reminds me of SimCity 4

**runaway3212** (9): banger

**Stryxen** (9): omg yas roses lotus violet iris callback i see you

**throwaway7650** (9): the "you got a lot of shit to learn" makes the song

**timothy444** (9): so… I just realised tat this stage of the album that the songs in this album use flowers as metaphors and suddenly the album makes more sense. Anyways, I do like how she's more optimistic here :)

**UselessTacooo** (9): bestie drags on longer than it needs to but other than that I have no complaints.

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (8.9): I think I want another verse in this to really like it, but I do like the themes in it. Ngl from the title I thought it would be the closing track. Sonically that doesn’t quite work bc It makes me restless but lyrically it wraps up a lot of things.

**savemeaseat143** (8.6): a bop about growth

**bbfan132** (8): dancing in my bed to this at 3 am

**ImADudeDuh** (8): this song title is gay coded [2]

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): flowers, flowers everywhere on this album

**rickikardashian** (8): Troye Sivan in 2018:

**Brendon-Urine** (7.5): girl why is she singing about sodomy

**CrimsonROSET** (7.5): i like the start of this track much more than the second part... idk, it was much more ambitious.

**fallenriot** (7.5): not my favorite but never a skip

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7.5): remembering the videos for the first few songs I think I won't

**AHSWeeknd** (7): a little all over the place but good overall.

**CarlieScion** (7): troye Sivan who

#stop talking about flowers i beg

**jasannn** (7): a downgrade after the past 4 songs.

**1998tweety** (6.5): bored

**celladonn** (6.5): HATE the first part but it's decent after that

**IIIHenryIII** (6.5): Please, Hayley, don't ever bloom again! I’m just kidding! It's not bad, but it’s missing”it”. It's not the lyrics, it's the production.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.5): The vocals on the intro are baaaaaaaaaaad, but the rest is a decent bop

**frogaranaman** (6): that one Troye Sivan bottoming anthem but for straight women

**NotWith10000Men** (6): is this album over yet

**ReallyCreative** (6): one of the biggest flaws with this album is the way far too many choruses are constructed, being FAR too repetitive for their own good. This is a great song diminished by a lackluster chorus and it's not alone on this record

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): another song that's not bad but a little boring

A very pleasant closer to the album and that was the general sentiment I saw for this track, which lands it a cute 7.777 average and top 20 spot! This isn't necessarily a standout track on the album imo but it's nice enough.

---

#Skin is clear, crops are watered

**avg-vag** (11): my heart stopped when i first heard this, then i listened 80 more times in a row

**AHSWeeknd** (10): a nice closer.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): it ended the album in a very deep yet understandable way.

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): My earlier superstitions aside I do think it sweet to end the album with talking about not being afraid to be in love again.

**fallenriot** (10): this is such a serene and beautiful closer, both to the album and that chapter of her life

**LuisEnRod** (10): yes this is the one that makes me cry

**relibee2** (10): this is the last song for the rate i have to listen to and I think it’s a fitting closer to this rate

**savemeaseat143** (10): I think this song deserves better. It’s so beautiful

**Stryxen** (10): a whole 11 here but alas, i AM giving in to the fear of my 11 coming early day 2

**bigbigbee** (9.5): This song is just so lovely. It definitely stands out, and it’s a fantastic closer.

**jaztinax** (9.5): such a solid closer to the album tbh. she sounds angelic and this song calms me down

**Ok\_Ant5217** (9.5): my skin is now clear

**ktajlili** (9): I love Pool, and I love how she closes the album with a sense of healing.

**starla\_** (9): a beautiful close to the album

**kirby31200** (8.5): I am a total sucker for songs that act as callbacks to previous songs, and this is definitely calling back to Pools, my very favorite Paramore song. It sends the album off on a very sweet, hopeful, ambiguous note and its very nice that way.

**throwaway7650** (8.5): very solid album closer, absolutely love the lyrics

**bbfan132** (8): good closer to the album!

**CrimsonROSET** (8): wishing you the best of luck babe xoxo

**Leixander** (8): as a closer, i think watch me while i bloom works better. this is a great song too however

**NotWith10000Men** (8): i like the melody a lot

**skargardin** (8): cute closer, wraps up the album really well i think

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i think this is a strong closer for the album. it sounds hopeful which i think is the vibe hayley was going for towards the end

**UselessTacooo** (8): I don’t think it’s a great closer but aside from that its a really pretty song overall

**zagreux** (8): I love how delicate and fluid her voice is here.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): that outro 🥺

**thedoctordances1940** (7.5): It's a fitting end for the album, it's alright but nothing special.

**1998tweety** (7): nice closer

**ImADudeDuh** (7): this song title is gay coded [3]

**mudkip1** (7): k at least the latter half ended up being decent

**seanderlust** (7): lovely way to end the record

#Clear as mud

**waluigiest** (7): the second verse about the pool is excellent. Otherwise it’s just okay and misses marks that made the last third of this album so important in its resolution

**ReallyCreative** (6.5): it's cute but it's not particularly gripping

**wavingwolves** (6.4): 🧍🏻

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Not bad at all, it's just not for me.

**runaway3212** (6): a bit of an underwhelming ender

**timothy444** (6): average ending lol

**frogaranaman** (5): isn’t that that one sweetener brand or something

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): i dont hate it but its a really weak closer for what is an awesome album imo

I was on the fence about including this at all, but decided to just go for it anyways since it's such a cute bop imo. Cute is exactly how you could explain its performance in the rate, with it hovering around the lower range of the top 20 for the entire time. Seems about apt for it so I'm fine with it going now, as much as I do really like it. Marshmello doesn't make many points, but he did make one here!

---

#Marshmello stans

**CrimsonROSET** (11): the fact this wasnt properly promoted when it's her best song AND one of the best songs of 2020? robbery.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): its incredible that Halsey and fucking Marshmello brought out the best in each other and their collab is both artist’s best song.

**1998tweety** (10): absolute 10, pop pefection. this deserved to be as big as Closer.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wouldn’t usually like this sort of stuff but Halsey’s voice sells it.

**frogaranaman** (10): huge bop

**runaway3212** (10): just the best song ever

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): I love how Halsey delivers the lyrics with empathy while not letting this person off the hook for projecting issues from a past relationship on to her, and the production isn’t overwhelming like other Marshmello songs.

**SFbby** (10): Pink-haired Halsey >>>> Every other look she's ever had

**skargardin** (10): biennially Marshmello actually snaps

**thedoctordances1940** (10): Wow, Marshmello with a proper chorus instead of the same shitty reused drop can actually lead to some great results. Like the production on this song is absolutely gorgeous, it really does sound fantastic and add a pretty good Halsey vocal line and you've got a smash.

**throwaway7650** (10): this is a bop idc, wasn't expecting to like this

**TiltControls** (10): Somehow missed this song, but this is a full bop

**timothy444** (10): It's funny how one of Marshmello's best songs sound nothing like a Marshmello song lol

**UselessTacooo** (9.8): The first time I saw marshmello was on this I got scared as I haven’t heard a song by him that I enjoyed at all, but I was pleasantly surprised. There was so much to the song and it fits perfectly with Manic as an album

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this should have been bigger

**pat-rickstar** (9.5): This better not be robbed just because it's Marshmello, this is really great

**starla\_** (9.4): i usually hate marshmello but this slaps

**CarlieScion** (9): this is not closer (jpn version) and for that it loses a point

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (9): This is definitely one of the better Marshmellow collabs. The lyrics are really good and the production really matches the vibe.

**letsallpoo** (9): when halsey works with interchangable and faceless (literally or otherwise) edm artists she makes magic

**ReallyCreative** (9): these two really work well together

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Cute

**vayyiqra** (9): Can't wait for all the "EDM bad; bottom text" comments even though this is 1. not really EDM it's synthpop 2. it's great

**akanewasright** (8.5): Overhated methinks

**fallenriot** (8.5): i was pleasantly surprised when i first heard this one, marshmello’s production is usually super boring but this song is really nice

**savemeaseat143** (8.5): the chorus is spectacular

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): perfect collaboration

**Brendon-Urine** (8): I tend to agree with people who say that Marshmello ruins songs and makes everything hella generic but Halsey actually does a great job of sticking out and making this song hers.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Every rate has its Eurovision song.

**Leixander** (8): marshmello might've made some points

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): a cute summer bop

**jasannn** (7.5): she has a good edm voice.

**kirby31200** (7.5): Is Marshmello kind of getting better?

**bluetriangles04** (7): I was more okay with this than I was expecting.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): probably the only Marshmello song I've ever remotely enjoyed

**Ok\_Ant5217** (7): anime Halsey :O

**Stryxen** (7): fun fact this is the first song i scrobbled on my last.fm account

#Be rude

**wavingwolves** (6.8): i like the music video for this a lot more than the song itself but it's still cute

**bbfan132** (6.5): it’s better than i remembered it being, even though it doesn’t fully deliver for me

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): it's fine?

**relibee2** (6.5): if I had to stream a marshmello song I would stream wolves or ritual but this is... cute, I guess.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.2): it’s good for a marshmello song... that isn’t saying much, it just ultimately feels very generic

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (5): I find the song very generic and boring

**waluigiest** (5): I never seek them out but I feel like every Marshmello song I’ve heard is so uninspiring

**IIIHenryIII** (4): This song has no personality. I really can't remember what I've just heard. I blame Marshmallow.

**Awkward\_King** (2): im not tanking this because im scared it will be the inoffensive song everyone scores decently high that surprises and wins. the production sounds unnaturally empty and i hate how like la de da and childish the lyrics sound (but also i think i just dont like songs abt people being supportive to one another thats a thought process i should probably seek formal help about). i think marshmello songs but just not be for me? is it because im a vegetatian and marshmellows have gelatine? or is it because im a boomer at 17 and cant get behind this specific trend? discuss. anyway i dont like this song and am scoring it accordingly, the side affect of it hopefully now not winning is just that, a side affect, and a nice one at that

**Hulnia** (1): This one’s mostly Marshmello’s fault to be honest.

**zagreux** (1): Why did she interrupt that cool vocal melody with a verse ugh

I was kinda surprised that this did as well as it did but not disappointed! It's not my absolute favourite on the album but it's still quite good, and that chorus undeniably hits. I think a lot of people can relate to being horny asf so I guess that's why it made it to the top 20.

#HORNY MFERS

**plastichaxan** (11): when she screamed “A SUDDEN DESIIIIIREEEE” she spilled

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the emotional delivery in the chorus, wow.

**CarlieScion** (10): so sexy !!!!!

**DilemmaOfAHedgehog** (10): I think she knows when to have sudden crescendos really with the tight and tense quiet she’s doing for many of these songs

**endcreditouilles** (10): when this hits it HITS. Her vocals in this are just *chefs kiss.

**fallenriot** (10): this was my immediate favorite from the first ep and an album highlight for sure

**relibee2** (10): what happened outside his house tho

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): my favourite on the album and my fourth contender for my 11. it does feel like a modern version of a Brand New Eyes Song which is probably why i like it so much

**UselessTacooo** (10): “we keep our distance now” bestie is a fortune teller. Also SUUUUDEENNNNN DISIIIIIEEERRRRRRRRE

**IIIHenryIII** (9.5): Now this chorus sounds like Hayley from Paramore. One of my favorites for sure.

**kirby31200** (9.5): These vocals HIT

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): horny af. love it

**seanderlust** (9): hayley williams is horny on main

**shesdoingyoga** (9): Yes vocals

**skargardin** (9): You can really feel the intimacy and conflict in the tone of the voice

**Stryxen** (9): this is the song that i most understand the argument that this album is a bit derivative but i really don’t see that as a bad thing - because it slaps. THE BELTING!!!!

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8.5): imagine Selena Gomez but she can belt

**savemeaseat143** (8.5): her vocals in this song !!!

**CrimsonROSET** (7): c'mon bitch kill him

**jaztinax** (7): she really screamed I AM HORNY AFFFFF in the chorus

#prudes

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Strange Desire (2014) by Bleachers >>>>>>>

**1998tweety** (6): this could be really good if the 2 different halves of the song were melded together better

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): me remembering I have a box of wine in the fridge

**thedoctordances1940** (5.5): The production is quite obnoxious and the streaming really isn't good, but I still don't hate it at least.

**ElizabethDDoS** (3): To give the rest of this album randomized scores. The loud chorus is questionable.

**J\_Toe** (3): I'm actually sad I'm not enjoying this album. What the hell? Simmer was so cool. Why am I struggling to listen to the rest of it?

**mudkip1** (3): this whole first section is terrible aside from simmer

This is such a gorgeous, feel-good track about being in love and, as some comments have pointed out, is such a great contrast from the rest of Halsey's discography that has a lot more negative emotions weaved throughout the vast majority of it. To be quite honest I never understood the You and I comparisons much at all but oh well. I would have had this in day 3 personally, but at least it managed to make it this far.

---

#:soblove:

**savemeaseat143** (11): every time I listen to this song I believe in love a bit more. I remember falling in love with this song immediately the first time I heard it. It was late 2019, and when I heard watched the mv I felt like I had been brought back to the songs that graced the radio during my childhood in the late 2000s. The nostalgia and dreamy slice-of-life romance have made in a mainstay in my streaming rotations.

**skargardin** (11): maybe a goofy 11 choice but I love how warm and fuzzy this song is honestly

**1998tweety** (10): i love you and i. i want a whole country-inspired album by halsey.

**akanewasright** (10): This is legitimately one of like three happy Halsey songs. And I might have made the other two up

**CarlieScion** (10): this song is so cute and I want halsey to make more happy songs

**CritneySpearz** (10): This is so weird, on paper it doesn't seem like her voice would suit this type of song well but it's actually v cute!

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy** (10): This kinda low-key gives me You & I vibes and it's just so beautiful that I can't express it with words so here's my 10 score.

**endcreditouilles** (10): I love her voice on this one. I'm a sucker for warm nostalgic chords.

**juanolsen** (10): my favorite song on the album, it really is beautiful

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): love listening to this and pretending I'm not lonely!!!!!!!! 🙃

**mudkip1** (10): this one gets shoehorned into the indie playlists i listen to at work, its cute

**NapsAndNetflix** (10): You & I is one of gaga's best

**NotWith10000Men** (10): okay I was being slightly facetious with you should be sad because THIS is the country song on this album. Just listen to all those instruments and the melody/structure/rhyme scheme of the chorus.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): this song is a great example of how much Halsey's vocals have improved and will probably be included in my wedding when that eventually happens

**timothy444** (10): Underrated af

**wavingwolves** (9.6): this song called me a worthless lonely bitch and said why thank why thank you

**starla\_** (9.4): this is lovely

**fallenriot** (9): who want me

**jaztinax** (9): if her references weren’t yoü and i by lady gaga and two ghosts by harry styles, she’s lying. beautiful song though, i can tell how much emotion and passion she put into this

**Roxieloxie** (8.7): yeehaw, again

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): we love a lil acoustic moment

**CrimsonROSET** (8.5): a lot of these are iffy on me because she goes back and forth so much on the lyrics i can't see a consistant narrative in the album but i guess this is fine?

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): Just a really pretty song

**throwaway7650** (8.5): nice acoustic track, super sweet lyrics

**seanderlust** (8.2): you taste like whiskey when you kiss me oh, i'd give anything again to b- oh wrong song.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): This isn’t something I’d instantly vibe with but it’s honestly great.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): hips like Jagger? Halsey is clearly inspired by the great mind of Adam Levine

**ImADudeDuh** (8): It's been a long time since I came around, Been a long time but I'm back in town, This time I'm not leaving without you

**jasannn** (8): Sounds like a Taylor Track

**Ok\_Ant5217** (8): getting BIG Cool vibes (by Jonas Brothers) from this, with a touch of Yoü and I.

**ReallyCreative** (8): pleasantly surprised by how sweet and nice this is

**rickikardashian** (8): halsey make more songs with “stranger” in the title i like them

**UselessTacooo** (7.8): it’s nice. There isn’t a whole lot to it but those vocals in the chorus do add to it.

**Stryxen** (7.5): very cute and this suits her voice so much, the instrumentals are kinda uninspired

**relibee2** (7.4): I just realized this sounds kinda like cowboy like me. Anyways Halsey why are you fighting someone dancing in the living room?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): pretty good

**bbfan132** (7): pleasant and relaxing track!

**bluetriangles04** (7): Halsey serving coffee shop indie vibes yas

#Finally // this track is out

**runaway3212** (7): forgettable

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): the verses here are really good but this chorus such a letdown

**kirby31200** (6.5): I just listened to this and already forgot how it goes

**IIIHenryIII** (6): I like the instruments, but her voice doesn't fit this music style. Sorry! Not a fan of pop acts going acoustic. It's just cringey and sounds artificial AF.

**frogaranaman** (5): this is a country “Yoü & I” but kinda boring

**zagreux** (4.3): The pre-chorus slaps but the chorus is  s u c h  a letdown

**astrologicalangel** (4): I'm sorry but this is just a worse version of U and I

**plastichaxan** (4): zzzz

**vayyiqra** (4): Oh no we're back to yeehaw

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): me wh- me when th- me when the stranger is hot (idk i didnt li)
