Women in Music: 1971
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9cewmr/women_in_music_1971/

# Place: The woods. Time: Midnight.

You’re on a camping trip with your friends. Summer is coming to an end, so you wanted the opportunity to get everyone together for one last outdoor adventure. You pack up and head into the forest to look for the best place to make camp. You find it. It’s a nice, open area with many trees and a river nearby. This seems to be the perfect place to land. It’s a slightly chilly evening and you spend your time around the fire, drinking and telling ghost stories. Eventually, you all decide to go to bed.

Except you. You feel a strange energy coming from nearby. You walk into the dense grouping of trees toward this energy that pulls you.

The further you walk, the darker it seems to get. And colder. And you’re getting hungrier. But you suddenly hear the sound of guitars. And laughter. You look in front of you to see a large pyre with four woman seated around it.

“Welcome, young one,” says one of them.

“Who are you?” you reply.

“Oh, you insolent Pophead. In a world of Dua’s and Zara’s and Bebe’s, you seem to be lost. Listen to our songs and our stories. Take a seat. Let us show you the glory of song.” 

The pyre changes and is suddenly engulfed in a blue fire. The first of the women steps forward.

“This is the gathering of four legendary songwriters, women who have defined what it means to write music and to put everything into song. We get together at the beginning of every September to relive our past and to write together, to create new music for one another, and to discuss the state of music as it is today. We sensed your energy nearby and have called you here to listen to our songs.”

You take out your earbuds. “I’m sorry, I missed all of that – Carly put a new snippet on Instagram. Who are you?”

“I am Joni.”

# Joni Mitchell - *Blue*

 Joni takes you through an emotional landscape of incredible lyrics and moving musical moments. Her voice is unlike any voice you’ve heard before. It’s emotive, and the blue fire only adds to the emotion of the moment. You wonder if this is considered the best album by a woman ever…maybe it should be.

1.	All I Want
2.	My Old Man
3.	Little Green
4.	Carey
5.	Blue
6.	California
7.	This Flight Tonight
8.	River
9.	A Case Of You
10.	The Last Time I Saw Richard

The next woman steps forward as the pyre fades from a blue to a glittery pearlescent. You can already hear the rasp in her voice.

“I’m not sure how I got here, but I’m happy to join these women. I am the only one still not among the living and I give my energy to these women when they eventually must leave me again for a year. I love their music and am happy to help them continue to create.”

She turns to another of the women behind her.

“By the way, Carole…Aretha says, ‘Hello.’”

A tear falls from Carole’s eye as she looks down.

“I am Janis.”

# Janis Joplin - *Pearl*

Janis’s raspy voice and rock-tinged tunes send your soul flying and you can’t help but move to the beat. Her songs are fun, catchy, and a nice reprieve from Joni’s honesty. You can’t help but think that the fire is dancing as you listen to Janis’s singing.

1.	Move Over
2.	Cry Baby
3.	A Woman Left Lonely
4.	Half Moon
5.	Buried Alive In the Blues
6.	My Baby
7.	Me and Bobby McGee
8.	Mercedes Benz
9.	Trust Me
10.	Get It While You Can


The pyre shifts from its pearlescent hue to a rather tame flame. The scent of a hearth overwhelms you and mixes with the aroma of the forest. A grey cat jumps into your lap. You feel comforted.

“It takes a lot of emotional energy to write a song. And I plan to use this time with my sisters to write about our friend Aretha. She was a magical soul and a great friend of mine. I will always miss her.”

“Joni said your name was Carole…are you…Carol Channing?” you say.

“Really? Carol Channing? You don’t know any of us but you know Carol Channing? No…I am Carole King.”

# Carole King - *Tapestry*

Carole sings you her songs, a collection of classic tunes and singer-songwriter gems. You even recognize some of them. Her album, *Tapestry*, was a defining moment in her career as a songwriter as she finally stepped behind the microphone herself. *Tapestry* is an exploration of love, the definition of home, and the meaning of life. 

1.	I Feel the Earth Move
2.	So Far Away
3.	It’s Too Late
4.	Home Again
5.	Beautiful
6.	Way over Yonder
7.	You’ve Got a Friend
8.	Where You Lead
9.	Will You Love Me Tomorrow?
10.	Smackwater jack
11.	Tapestry
12.	(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman

The final woman steps forward as the pyre rises once again. As it rises, it shoots up oranges and greens and many other colors into the sky. The fanfare is marvelous.

“Sorry to keep you waiting, I was looking for my guitar.”

“Dolly!” you exclaim, happy to finally recognize someone.

“Yes, honey? Aw, shucks. I’m happy to be known. Hopefully you’ve been enjoying my other sisters’ songs. Let’s have some fun, shall we?”

# Dolly Parton - *Coat of Many Colors*

Dolly takes her stance and sings you some of her classic songs, songs that reflect on her upbringing. You appreciate the country tinge as a leaf falls on the ground next to you. Her songs are short, but they travel some emotional ground, and you lose yourself in her sweet Southern voice.

1.	Coat of Many Colors
2.	Traveling Man
3.	My Blue Tears
4.	If I Lose My Mind
5.	The Mystery Of The Mystery
6.	She Never Met A Man (She Didn’t Like)
7.	Early Morning Breeze
8.	The Way I See You
9.	Here I Am
10.	A Better Place To Live

“Thank you for joining us, Pophead. Now leave us to our work. Tell the world our names. Share our stories.”

You wake up in your tent. A new Charli leak is already on your phone. But you choose to replay the songs you heard from the night before instead.

# Rules

-	I'm pretty sure it’s a tradition to just steal this from other rate posts, so here’s the rate rules that all you vets are used to and all you newbies should be ready to learn!


-	Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10. Decimals are fine (please make sure they are decimal, not comma), but please don't give scores that have two or more decimal spots: giving a 6.2 is okay, but a 6.21 isn't. Please do not give scores less than one (.1-.9) or above 10 (10.1-10.9). 0 and 11 are exceptions to this, of course, as discussed below. /u/letsallpoo has created this program, this is the way it is. If you don't put a score in, you break the program, and you ruin everything for everyone.


-	Feel free to talk about/gossip about your scores! You never know, someone may have a different perspective than you and may change your mind about a song. Get as much out of the music as possible.


-	You may give **ONE song a 0** and **ONE song an 11** in the **ENTIRE RATE**. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks; excessive sabotage ruins rate results. It's not required to use these! Please don't give out 0's and 11's just because! (Especially because there are literally no 0's in this rate...)

-	Speaking of sabotage, if I think your scores look suspicious, I reserve the right to message you about them. Try to keep your scores fair – all of these albums are excellent.

-	You can change your scores at any time! Feel free to PM me again after submitting your scores. 

-	To make things a lot more efficient and to reduce errors on my part, scores need to be sent in a very specific way. The easiest way to make sure your scores follow the necessary format is to use the pre-prepared link that I have put all over this post, such as [right here](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=whatareblackhole&subject=1971%20Rate%20Submission&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Blue%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Joni%20Mitchell%0A%0AAll%20I%20Want%3A%0A%0AMy%20Old%20Man%3A%0A%0ALittle%20Green%3A%20%0A%0ACarey%3A%0A%0ABlue%3A%0A%0ACalifornia%3A%0A%0AThis%20Flight%20Tonight%3A%0A%0ARiver%3A%0A%0AA%20Case%20Of%20You%3A%0A%0AThe%20Last%20Time%20I%20Saw%20Richard%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Pearl%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Janis%20Joplin%0A%0AMove%20Over%3A%0A%0ACry%20Baby%3A%0A%0AA%20Woman%20Left%20Lonely%3A%0A%0AHalf%20Moon%3A%0A%0ABuried%20Alive%20In%20the%20Blues%3A%0A%0AMy%20Baby%3A%0A%0AMe%20and%20Bobby%20McGee%3A%0A%0AMercedes%20Benz%3A%0A%0ATrust%20Me%3A%0A%0AGet%20It%20While%20You%20Can%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Tapestry%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Carole%20King%0A%0AI%20Feel%20the%20Earth%20Move%3A%0A%0ASo%20Far%20Away%3A%0A%0AIt%27s%20Too%20Late%3A%0A%0AHome%20Again%3A%0A%0ABeautiful%3A%0A%0AWay%20over%20Yonder%3A%0A%0AYou%27ve%20Got%20a%20Friend%3A%0A%0AWhere%20You%20Lead%3A%0A%0AWill%20You%20Love%20Me%20Tomorrow%3F%3A%0A%0ASmackwater%20Jack%3A%0A%0ATapestry%3A%0A%0A%28You%20Make%20Me%20Feel%20Like%29%20A%20Natural%20Woman%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Coat%20of%20Many%20Colors%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Dolly%20Parton%0A%0ACoat%20of%20Many%20Colors%3A%0A%0ATraveling%20Man%3A%0A%0AMy%20Blue%20Tears%3A%0A%0AIf%20I%20Lose%20My%20Mind%3A%0A%0AThe%20Mystery%20Of%20The%20Mystery%3A%0A%0AShe%20Never%20Met%20A%20Man%20%28She%20Didn%27t%20Like%29%3A%0A%0AEarly%20Morning%20Breeze%3A%0A%0AThe%20Way%20I%20See%20You%3A%0A%0AHere%20I%20Am%3A%20%0A%0AA%20Better%20Place%20To%20Live%3A%0A%0AEND). PLEASE USE THAT. You can copy and paste it to a notepad or Word or OpenOffice file or Google Docs or something and fill in your scores there, but PLEASE use that format to send in your scores.


-	If you don't follow the format, I'll still accept your ballot, but I reserve the right to publicly shame you and your inability to follow basic instructions. So just go ahead and [follow the format]( https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=whatareblackhole&subject=1971%20Rate%20Submission&message=Username%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Blue%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Joni%20Mitchell%0A%0AAll%20I%20Want%3A%0A%0AMy%20Old%20Man%3A%0A%0ALittle%20Green%3A%20%0A%0ACarey%3A%0A%0ABlue%3A%0A%0ACalifornia%3A%0A%0AThis%20Flight%20Tonight%3A%0A%0ARiver%3A%0A%0AA%20Case%20Of%20You%3A%0A%0AThe%20Last%20Time%20I%20Saw%20Richard%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Pearl%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Janis%20Joplin%0A%0AMove%20Over%3A%0A%0ACry%20Baby%3A%0A%0AA%20Woman%20Left%20Lonely%3A%0A%0AHalf%20Moon%3A%0A%0ABuried%20Alive%20In%20the%20Blues%3A%0A%0AMy%20Baby%3A%0A%0AMe%20and%20Bobby%20McGee%3A%0A%0AMercedes%20Benz%3A%0A%0ATrust%20Me%3A%0A%0AGet%20It%20While%20You%20Can%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Tapestry%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Carole%20King%0A%0AI%20Feel%20the%20Earth%20Move%3A%0A%0ASo%20Far%20Away%3A%0A%0AIt%27s%20Too%20Late%3A%0A%0AHome%20Again%3A%0A%0ABeautiful%3A%0A%0AWay%20over%20Yonder%3A%0A%0AYou%27ve%20Got%20a%20Friend%3A%0A%0AWhere%20You%20Lead%3A%0A%0AWill%20You%20Love%20Me%20Tomorrow%3F%3A%0A%0ASmackwater%20Jack%3A%0A%0ATapestry%3A%0A%0A%28You%20Make%20Me%20Feel%20Like%29%20A%20Natural%20Woman%3A%0A%0AAlbum%3A%20Coat%20of%20Many%20Colors%0A%0AARTIST%3A%20Dolly%20Parton%0A%0ACoat%20of%20Many%20Colors%3A%0A%0ATraveling%20Man%3A%0A%0AMy%20Blue%20Tears%3A%0A%0AIf%20I%20Lose%20My%20Mind%3A%0A%0AThe%20Mystery%20Of%20The%20Mystery%3A%0A%0AShe%20Never%20Met%20A%20Man%20%28She%20Didn%27t%20Like%29%3A%0A%0AEarly%20Morning%20Breeze%3A%0A%0AThe%20Way%20I%20See%20You%3A%0A%0AHere%20I%20Am%3A%20%0A%0AA%20Better%20Place%20To%20Live%3A%0A%0AEND) please!


-	If you want to attach a comment to a specific song (which is encouraged!) write it right after your score. Make sure nothing is separating your score and your comment except for a space!


-	If you want to attach a comment to an album, add a colon after the ALBUM name and put your comment there!


-	I can't believe I even have to say this, but don't change the submission ballot - it just messes everything up.


# This is the ONE AND ONLY correct format for SONG comments:
