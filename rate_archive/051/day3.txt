*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* It's strange how the title track of this album is the one people don't really pay attention to that much, minus the part where Joni decides to list every hedonistic life choice possible before Madonna does it forty years later. To be honest, I find that attitude understandable: it's a pretty short song to connect the halves of its parent album with, and to some people it can seem a little underwhelming. After my last few listens of this album, though, I definitely appreciate it more. Blue is a very fitting title for this track, as well as for this album in general. Unlike Taylor's fiery red passion (no shade intended, I love them both) the scenario Joni describes here details a romance that, despite being doomed like so many others, settles itself in rather than makes itself apparent. You know it's not going to end well, and Joni does, too. The situation hangs about in the air and starts to melt slowly and tentatively, like icy blue. Maybe it's not an easy song to go back to, but it's certainly just as memorable.

---
**Arybeck67** (11): Cue my unending tears. This was the first Joni Mitchell song I ever listened to and it just broke me. Been hooked on her stuff ever since. This song is perfection.

**vayyiqra** (11): Since this was the only track in the rate to get a 10 from me, it seemed appropriate to upgrade it to an 11. This is exactly what I imagined this album would be like: sad, vulnerable, open, and piano-heavy.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): Nothing’s broke me like this has.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): The lyrics, the haunting piano line, the beautifully calibrated vocal delivery with those moments of faint dissonance and strain in exactly the right places… ugh. One of the most perfect songs ever written, as far as I’m concerned. Choosing whether to give this, A Case of You, or The Last Time I Saw Richard my 11 was HARD.

**Benthetall1** (9): Ooohh, this one. She genuinely sounds in pain on this track. I think this hurts the score slightly, simply because it almost feels voyeuristically personal to hear her gasp through the song. Yet, it’s such a portrait of despair. Unsettling.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): definitely a mood

**tapdancingpig** (9): And I thought modern bridges went hard.

**awryj** (8): outsang marina

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): I love the rhyming scheme. I think the piano tracks are the strongest ones on here.

**MrSwearword** (8): By this point, I'm convinced Joni Mitchell has a unique talent of selling bad lyrics with great singing.

**J\_Toe** (7): “California” and “Carey” are songs with a great number of lyrics, because they are telling the stories of Joni’s travels. In contrast, Blue has far fewer lyrics. It instead painting an impression of Joni’s emotional state at the time of writing the album. I love the visceral description of ink on a pen and needle beneath the skin.

**minibjork** (6): how have i never noticed the "Acid, boose, and ass" line in this

One of my favorite Carole songs, although it feels like it’s missing something. I always find myself singing this song randomly just because of how moving the melody and lyrics are. I really love this song right after “I Feel…” because of the contrast between the two. Overall, I really love this song.

---
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Carole puts so much energy into her songs. Only she could make this sad topic seem upbeat and catchy.

**MrSwearword** (10): I'm not heartless. This deserves high marks.

**ulikejazz** (10): devastatingly beautiful

**Benthetall1** (9): I’m not always a ballad person but something in King’s delivery here really sells the song for me. Like so much of Tapestry, this song is warm, lush, and appealing. King’s voice is a bit rough, but she used that to her advantage, giving it an emotional edge and yearning energy.

**poppinmmolly** (9): "it would be so fine to see your face at my door" is my Twitter bio

**minibjork** (8.5): haha remember playing this song over the phone to some creepy neighborhood boys of mine ha good times :')

**patronsaintofaspies** (8.5): In all actuality, as the second song off Tapestry, So Far Away is a better indication of what Carole's record will be like than the track before it. It has is a melody you're likely to have heard before, and I can't be the only one whose face lit up when I recognised the flute at its end. If I Feel the Earth's composition obscured the song's actual message, So Far Away's brings further attention to it - it's hard to miss all the hard-hitting lyrics here, especially 'it would be so nice to see your face at my door'. Hearing that line made me realise that while rocking with Janis was fun, I was back to strictly singer-songwriter territory.

**J\_Toe** (8): An immediate change of pace for the album, with a slower, more introspective in comparison to Feel the Earth. I like it, but not as much as the opening track. Still, the lyrics “doesn’t anybody stay in one place anymore” is incredible.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (6.8): Frankly, I found this song to be kind of mundane.

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* Consensus among fans and critics say that this is one of Joni's most underrated songs. It was even included in her brilliantly titled compilation of commercial failures, 'Misses', due to the acclaim it's garnered over the years. And I...appreciate it, sure, but it doesn't connect to me as much as the rest of Blue's tracklist. Maybe it treads too deep into folk for me, or maybe I don't find as much thematic detail in it compared to River. But I do think it's a great song that shouldn't have been ignored upon its initial release. The holy wine line features some of the best lyrical imagery on this album, and the twist at the end is something that's not easy to forget. Maybe I'll grow to love this as much as other people do in due time.

---
**MrSwearword** (10): even with the Canada Canada moment or whatever, this is at least Joni being poetic but not in a totally cringeworthy way.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): I listen to LYRICISTS. i very rarely listen to people who... cannot write.

**skargardin** (10): One of the few Joni songs I knew prior to this rate. A classic for sure.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): One of her most iconic songs for a reason.

**Arybeck67** (9.9): “OH CANADAAAA!!!

**Benthetall1** (8.5): OK, fine. The “bitter and sweet” metaphor is fairly obvious material here. I think she’s allowed a little earnestness every once and a while, especially for a song as elegant as this.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Not the most perfect metaphor ever conceived...but certainly on one of the most beautifully executed.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Hello children, are you thinking of doing a “Love is a drug” song? Good. Don’t. Cover this instead. What’s this? You won’t be as good as Joni? Of course you won’t. But the writing is way more charming that whatever addiction glamorizing shit you’re about to put out.

**J\_Toe** (6): Beautiful lyrics but not my favourite song to listen to. Still, these final two songs of the album finally reveal the truth behind Joni’s pain by outlining who exactly caused this heartbreak and sparked Joni’s desire to begin a journey of self-discovery.

*From /u/J_Toe:* This song sets in motion Joni’s unique sound of folk rock, combining the sounds of the Appalachian dulcimer with a steel stringed guitar. The very sound of the album captures the central narrative of her songs: an escape from the anxieties of modern America and search for herself in the ‘untouched’ locales of sunny Europe. But, just as in this hybrid genre, Joni finds that the global and local spheres of her world are inseparable.

---
**awryj** (11): literal heaven

**Benthetall1** (10): This song has some complex emotional ambiguity in the lyrics- I love it. It’s just gorgeous, melancholic and yet also so joyously longing. One of the more upbeat songs on this album, and yet a great and fitting opener.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (9): Joni, you do make me feel free.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): All I Want isn't a very flashy opener for this album. Unlike most other songs that people try to begin a record with, there aren't very many things here that grab a modern music fan's attention the first time they listen to it, aside from a very appealing set of strings. There's no gorgeous production or shocking statement to be made in the song, although it's relatively upbeat compared to some of the other songs on Blue. But it introduces you to Joni in a carefully crafted way. There are gripping lines here that pique your interest, even if they're a small step away from the lyrical pictures that Joni's going to paint later on. Meanwhile, guitar playing gives this track a warm, folky feel. It's delightful to listen to, and it also foreshadows the depth of emotion Joni reveals in the songs to come. Once I got used to how acoustic this was, I started to understand what a brilliant opening song it is.

**skargardin** (9): She really took me there with this opener, I’m stoked to hear the rest!

**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.9): A perfect but somewhat disarming album opener - it seems like a cheerful acoustic-rock bop and the lyrics are, in the first few verses, exuberant and optimistic, affirming her excitement and lust for life. It’s a disarming, though, because it SEEMS like just a cheerful acoustic-rock bop with cute lyrics - but if you dig just a little deeper there are strong hints of things to come in the rest of the album - the deep deeps and the pain.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Love the middle-eastern instrumentals on this. But she sometimes put accents on the wrong syllables

**MrSwearword** (8): a pretty good opener but that "I wanna shampoo you" moment is not cute.

**tapdancingpig** (7.5): Just lovely.

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* If the previous two songs failed to capture your attention for some weird reason, Carey is the one that makes you start to actually listen to Blue again. It returns to the upbeat folk sounds of All I Want, and it also resumes a premise of Joni directly addressing someone. Along with a beat that's great to clap along to, Joni brings you to a stage in her life where she's directly experiencing a relationship, to the point where you feel like you're not just reading pages of her diary but actually witnessing it. If there are any doubts left to her skill, by now, they should be quelled.

---
**J\_Toe** (11): Favourite song on the album! I believe this song is about the “Redneck on a Grecian Isle” she mentioned in “California”. The song captures the album’s theme of searching for the ‘real’ by retreating from global influences. However, this cannot be done. Her best friend in this tiny Grecian Isle is a Redneck, an American. And the Grecian Isles aren’t as isolated from the global as Joni had initially perceived. Still, the song is really fun, and I recommend it in every r/popheads thread asking for a song that isn’t about love. Also, watch the backstory to the song here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fPIYyX-P1Iw

**Leixander** (11): this is just... beautiful

**awryj** (10): ok this is just amazing, i feel like traveling

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Yasss queen of making a song about Zack and Cody's mom

**Arybeck67** (9.7): DADDDY

**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.3): I love the backing vocals in this one! They really take it to another level imo. This song is one of the few on Blue that makes me feel like dancing. Despite the slice-of-life lyrics, it’s not in any way lacking in emotional power or depth. Its biggest flaw is just its placement in the album - sandwiched between Little Green and Blue, on the one hand it’s a welcome respite (a chance to breathe between gut-punches) but on the other it feels a tiny bit out of place.

**Benthetall1** (8.5): A much-needed change of pace from Little Green. She strategically places her more optimistic songs throughout the album to provide relief from the gloomier pieces. This is fun, although not one of my favorites on this album. Nonetheless, sweet and breezy soft folk rock that was her signature.

**MrSwearword** (7): her singing is great but these lyrics are so pretentious and fluffy as fuck.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (6): I don’t really ‘Carey’ for this one

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): When she sang “outta sight” I suddenly remembered this album came out in the ‘70s.

SO, if I wasn’t going through such a tumultuous romantic period, this probably would have gotten my 11 instead of “River.” “You’ve Got a Friend” reminds me of my mother and gets me teary-eyed every time. I absolutely adore this song because of its sentimentality. I’m happy to call this my favorite Carole song. (And Gaga also sings it terrifically.)

---
**MrSwearword** (10): I think this is another classic that's worth any and every bit of praise it got.

**patronsaintofaspies** (10): Nope, this isn't the Toy Story song that got stuck in your head as a kid. It's not the James Taylor cover, either. This is Carole's original version of You've Got A Friend, and it's near-perfection. The concept of this song makes it one of the purest ones ever written; it's about agape love, which people usually define as unconditional love for the entire human race. That's hard to muster, but Carole creates a timeless song here that lives up to its intention; this song could easily be applied to any sort of love or affection, whether romantic, platonic, familial, or anything else. This is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard, and the lyrics don't back down on the track's sincerity. It was hard not to give this my 11, because it's a song I absolutely love, but even if I didn't end up tossing over an extra point in it, I still wish that I heard more songs like this. It's truly one of a kind.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): So one of my recurring complaints with this album is the lyrics. I don’t need Pulitzer Prize level poetry on every song or anything, but the text in songs like Home Again and So Far Away has just been SO uninspiring to me. However, for some reason here the use of relatively uncomplicated language and simple and familiar rhymes works perfectly.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Like this doesn’t make you cry.

**Arybeck67** (9.5): ahh this is the original and it’s awesome

**Leixander** (9.5): https://media1.tenor.com/images/d2b1da4225dd343e3746192da32c046e/tenor.gif?itemid=9152256

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): am I crying

**Benthetall1** (9): I find it is difficult to sing this song without making it abashedly over-sentimental. I like the restraint she gives this song. She lets the song breathe, keeping the instrumentation simple (necessary in this case), and the embellishments relatively simple. It could be a little long?

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): Damn this song makes me wish I had someone that cared about me this much :(

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Toy Story is overrated. Not bad, but overrated.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): long, but GOOD!

**vayyiqra** (7): I feel bad because I like this song, but I felt James Taylor did it better.

**TragicKingdom1** (5): honestly this song bores me, it does not warrant being 5 minutes long. i think it's a little cliche on top of that and not nearly sentimental enough. carole shows talent so i won't give a zero despite being the worst song in the rate

**awryj** (4): it would be good if it didnt drag on so much

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* Oh, are we treading back into rock territory? This wouldn't fit on Pearl, but either way, it's delightfully cheesy. What is this even about? Why on earth is there a love triangle between Dolly and her mother? What could possibly compel here to write something like this? How does she absolutely go off at the end? After a lot of listening, I'm still not sure, but, honestly, I think that makes this track all the more entertaining. Only somebody like Dolly could have the guts to pull this off.

---
**Benthetall1** (10): I wasn’t expecting this at all. First of all, the bluesy construction of the song is excellent. The story is absolutely hilarious, too. Tens, tens across the board, and a complete surprise for someone who hasn’t ever heard this before!

*From /u/Benthetall1:* What an opener! Snarling, ferocious, unyielding (and a BOP, of course)! Also one of the two songs on this record she actually wrote. A great introduction to a Leviathan of an album.

---
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): That guitar solo just blew it into the stratosphere

**J\_Toe** (10): by far my favourite song on the album, and an amazing opening song for Pearl. I will sheepishly admit that while I regularly listen to plenty of songs from Blue and Tapestry, this is the only song from Pearl that I regularly listen to.

**jamesfog** (9.5): This slaps

**MrSwearword** (9): mainly because the production works its way up into being an opener that makes sense.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Right at the start of Pearl, the shredding guitar of Move Over makes you realise that this is the only rock album in this rate, and that you'd better damn appreciate that. Move Over sounds threatening, with wails from Janis and hard-hitting instrumentation, but this isn't an empty song designed for nothing else than to to get the crowds pumping, although it does carry out that task well. Pay attention to the lyrics, and you get a feminist anthem full of energy and anger. Janis goes on a tangent at the end, and it's absolutely legendary. Overall, this is a very good opener.

**tapdancingpig** (9): This song is everything I like about traditional Rock & Roll.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.6): I literally couldn’t sit down while listening to this song… I had to get up and dance. What a great, high-energy album opener.

**Arybeck67** (7.3): I find this track to be good, but like not fab

**awryj** (7): whooooaAAaaoaoOAOAoaoooooouuh

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* The second song on Pearl is more of a straight up blues ballad than Move Over. In fact, with a few tweaks and a little less guitar, you could say it's on the edge of being considered soul. This is definitely proof that Janis' ragged voice isn't just for rock and roll; you might be put off by it at first, but that very raspiness that starts off sounding strange ends up being the reason why she sounds so distraught and vulnerable as she sings an already powerful composition. The monologue at the end continues the trend of songs finishing off great on Pearl, too.

---
**Benthetall1** (10): Alright so fun fact, I used to like the Garnett Mimms original more. But the more I listen to this the more I realize she basically “Respect”-ed this song into music legend. The opening instrumental leaves you in tension until she detonates it with that first “BABY!”, and that moment alone is worth a 10.

**jamesfog** (10): Blassic

**MrSwearword** (10): because only Janis Joplin could sing this and should've remained the only human on Earth to sing some powerful shit like this.

**perfumevee** (10): I love this song so much! It was a strong contender for my 11.

**Arybeck67** (9.5): Ahhhh Janis’ vocals on this track is just sublime. SCREECH girl!!!

**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.3): SING IT GURL. The contrast between the world-weary, kind of contemplative energy in the verses and the sheer force and power of the chorus is brilliantly executed. I also particularly love the way she says “all you EVER gotta do is be a good man one time to one woman”.

**J\_Toe** (9): This is the kind of sound I think of when I picture Janis Joplin

**Leixander** (9): why are almost all songs named crybaby are good, i am starting the crybabyheads and no that's not a subreddit about that personality that once argued with christina aguilera

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I love 6/8 and 3/4 time signatures more than I should, so this song got at least a half point bonus for that.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): She fools with the mike a little too much on this one but it’s still a BOP

**rotating3Dtext** (8): this is going in my collection of songs called cry baby

**awryj** (7.5): kinda iconic but her spoken parts kinda remind me of a drunk couple arguing in front of a liquor store at 11 pm so eh

**ImADudeDuh** (7): what the fuck is she doing in the last 20 seconds https://genius.com/13953449 also please fucking look at this genius annotation that fucking dragged janis

**vayyiqra** (7): As iconic and catchy as that opening is, the rest of it really goes nowhere. It's a hook without a song. But still, what a hook.

**poppinmmolly** (6): too long, actually most of these songs are too long

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): Please stop yelling.

*From /u/Benthetall1:* Yeah how could I not give this a 10? She takes Kristofferson’s excellent story and makes it her own, just as she did with Cry Baby. The main difference is this performance is all about the subtlety rather than the intensity. Sublime. Perfect, even. Also have to really compliment the musicians here, they really help fulfill both her and the song’s full potential.

---
**MrSwearword** (11): EASILY Janis' GOAT and one of the best songs in recorded music.

**patronsaintofaspies** (11): Hoo, boy. This wasn't looking like my 11 at first, but after listening to the other albums in the rate, I realised that as good as the other songs in it were, nothing impacted me as much as this one. Actually, I'd go as far to say this is my favourite song of 1971, which is fucking insane. I like it more than Life on Mars! How on earth? Well, this is definitely the cleanest sounding song on this album, for starters; not in terms of lyrics, of course, but the production here obviously made it a prime candidate for what'd be Janis' last big hit. Funnily enough, there's a fairly solid theory that even if this is a cover, the original writer probably wrote it about Janis herself (the first version recorded was sung by a dude and used female pronouns for Bobby, though Janis switched that. That bothers me, because Janis was bisexual, but, hey, this was 1971. I actually want somebody to record a nonbinary version that uses they pronouns now...). It's a bittersweet song that serves as her last triumph, but, damn, is it good. I'm expecting this to clash against Coat of Many Colors, and with all respect to Dolly, I'm going to end up for this one to climb on top of the podium.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We decided to stan forever

**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): Probably the best chorus on the album. Amazing vocal performance, great lyrics, digging the hammond organ, and those two last minutes take me THERE. A+

**tapdancingpig** (10): This song is pure nostalgia.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): iconic in every way. perfect atmosphere and probably janis' most memorable vocal performance. i LOVE the escalation in tension throughout the song and the instrumental breakdown at the end works extremely well.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): I like the way it speeds up at the end. The scatting was weird and brought it down from a ten though

**awryj** (6): me and mah bobbeh mgay

**vayyiqra** (5): I'm seriously confused this was being called a frontrunner for the winner. It's a popular song, but to me it's just an okay front half with the whole coda being a pointless mess. I am underwhelmed.

**patronsaintofaspies**: Maybe one of the saddest albums ever when you consider it's her last one, a feat only toppled by Blackstar in terms of mainstream rock music. It's hard, reading about Janis' life; you get the impression that she was a fun, easygoing woman from her music, and she was, but drugs and troubled social relationships put an end to that. Like all artists who die young, Janis is a series of 'what ifs' that haunt us, but our regrets over a death that happened almost fifty years ago shouldn't make us ignore what a brilliant record this is. Is it perfect? Nah. If you squint a little you can see that it's obviously not a finished album, and Lord knows how good of an album it would be if Janis finished her fork on it. But I have a feeling she'd just want us to enjoy her music, and I definitely did.

**J\_Toe**: I wasn’t alive in 1971. So, as is the case with all of these artists, I had to ‘discover’ them at some point in my life. I only really looked into Janis Joplin after The Voice AU winner Karise Eden was described as sounding as though she had ‘swallowed Janis Joplin”, lol. (Thanks Keith Urban)

**TragicKingdom1**: I was truly blown away by this album. It kept a high tension the whole time, which I love, especially on a short project like this. The production is really punchy and groovy, but not in a way that overpowers anything else. But the REAL star of the show here is Janis, whose vocals are incredibly distinct and charismatic, and really add to the authentic, rootsy vibe of the album. Overall, this is one of my favorite albums that we've ever rated on the sub, and probably my favorite that I hadn't already heard prior to the rate in question. [Grade: A+]

**Benthetall1**: Incredibly consistent. She died far too young with so much more to show. This is a vivid testament to her musicianship, talent, and sheer force of personality. It is also a bittersweet goodbye letter. We can only wonder what could have followed this.

**MrSwearword**: A really good album with minor errors that don't overshadow that fact.

**tapdancingpig**: There’s some great music here, but I’m not going to pretend that Ms. Joplin’s growls don’t get on my classically trained nerves.

**Discord\_and\_Dine**: I must admit I was a little underwhelmed with this. The good songs are fucking good but some of the album tracks are kinda...meh. Don't kill me please

**stardustanddinos**: I had never listened to a blues album before this, and man, it was such a delightful experience. It was amazing to see how this style of music has gone on to influence so much of modern RnB artists and more. Janis’ voice is of a free-spirit, less about technique but more about the spirit behind the lyrics. The album is not sombre but somewhat celebratory, sassy even. I don’t know enough about blues to make specific comments, but I really enjoyed the album.

**vayyiqra**: I've always known about and respected Janis as a legend and whatever, but I never got the appeal of her. This album was not my style and got monotonous with her over-the-top shouty vocals. This might seem deeply cynical, but there's always been a tendency among music fans to idolize artists who die young. This is also true of artists I like, so I'm not just saying it to be edgy. She did have talent and deserved better. But as for this album, I can't see myself listening to it again.

**Ghost-Quartet**: I probably rated her unfairly because I really don’t like the blues, my dad would listen to it every Sunday morning on K-Jazz (a jazz show NPR does) and so that radio would just blare just the bass from blues music up to my room and let me tell you, when you hear just the bass literally every song sounds the same. I’m convinced that NPR trolled me specifically by playing only the one song over and over again for years, so now I just have a horrible knee-jerk reaction to the blues.

somedizzywhore-1804: I didn't have time to write a comment for any album but Blue unfortunately, but I was just saying in the plug that everybody should've had to watch [her performance of Ball and Chain at Monterey Pop in 1967](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X1zFnyEe3nE) at least until the 2:10 mark before doing this rate in order to fully appreciate what an artist and a genius she was.  This album isn't a perfect one, and I have to admit that on the balance I wouldn't be inclined to re-listen to _most_ of the songs, but she was SUCH a fucking talent, and the good songs on Pearl are SO great it's mindblowing.

This is a BOP! Carole really did it with this one. When I first listened to Tapestry, I was so surprised by this song and I still bop to it regularly. This is pop songwriting at its finest – move over, Julia Michaels!

---
**tapdancingpig** (11): Whoever made the decision to release double A-side of this and I Feel The Earth Move is a fucking genius. This song is probably my favorite of the two, if only because I randomly hum the iconic piano line at least once a day (bum... BUM-bum bumbadumbambudabum). Either way, this hits HARD, both with its lyrics and catchiness.

**Benthetall1** (10): This song. I wanted to give this my 11 so much, and almost did. I think this is one of the best songs ever written. It’s one of the more layered songs on the album, elevating it over the rest because of its details. There’s just so much going ON, and it’s all wonderful. The gospel-esque backing vocals, the bluesy guitar licks, the jazzy piano, the saxophone, the sharp percussion. Apparently all Carole King songs with rhythm sections go OFF.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I love how solos take up almost half the song but no one notices or cares because they’re amazing

**ImADudeDuh** (10): gurl, i hear sumn, and it SLAPS!

**Leixander** (10): i remember this riff being used in pikachu on acid or smth

**MrSwearword** (10): a classic worth the hype/acclaim/stannage/etc.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): I find this to be the catchiest song in the rate.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (9): The only thing I can ding this for is that the lyrics are a bit simplistic, but even then, they really work in the context of the song. I loooove the harmonies and the groove here.

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): A bit of a weird song, and I'm still not sure I actually get it. I expected it to be another ballad upon hearing the first verse, but it turned into something very fitting for a crossover station, and the combination of Carole's voice and this track's production reminded me of songs like You're So Vain. After the artistry of the first two songs, maybe it was a little jarring to hear this at first, but I think that by now I've gotten used to it. The early use of synth-like instrumentation is definitely good.

**TragicKingdom1** (7): this song starts out strong but honestly drags by the end

The interpolation of “Jingle Bells” into such a moving ballad is genius. This song, to me, transcends its seasonal feel although it tells the story within a holiday frame. I adore this song for its brutal honesty and its passion to run away. This is the first Joni song I heard and its hooked me on her ever since.

---
**minibjork** (11): thank god joni made the perfect christmas song for my sentimental ass

**Arybeck67** (10): Queen of running away from problems cause you’re emotionally unstable, this song is a BIG MOOD

**Benthetall1** (10): What is there to even say about this? It’s transcendent, a beautifully written, perfectly accompanied masterpiece. Of all the songs here, this one is the biggest contender among Joni songs for my 11.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Christmas is incomplete without this song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I love this use of a river as a metaphor, where it's frozen and seen as a road to leave behind, instead of meaning rebirth or cleasning like any other time its used.

**perfumevee** (10): Every time I hear this song I smile because it reminds me of how salty my mom gets when she hears this on the radio as a Christmas song. "Just because she mentions Christmas DOES NOT make it a Christmas song!" A classic all the same, though

**skargardin** (10): now THIS is a ballad, holy shit

**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): This song is always such a heartwrencher. The aching desire to escape - from your sadness, from your life, from your past - is something I tend to feel very strongly and Joni conveys it so beautifully.

**tapdancingpig** (10): Look, I generally love Christmas (it helps that I’m a Christian), but I realize how much that time really sucks for a lot of people, and this song made me feel for y’all.

**ulikejazz** (10): merry christmas bitch

**rotating3Dtext** (9.5): i want to skate on a river

**jamesfog** (9): Why this sounds like Jingle Bells

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): This depressing anti-holiday song is, ironically enough, covered in tons of Christmas compilations. Perhaps that's not as much of a misreading as it sounds like, though. Winter has a dark, gloomy side to it, and River feels like a downcast reflection on a particularly bad year as it wraps up. Joni somehow turns the melody of Jingle Bells into something you're not likely to go carolling to, throwing a pity party im the middle of sleet and snow.

**J\_Toe** (8): A sad and raw song, but a powerful song, still. We should listen to this song every Christmas.

**MrSwearword** (8): I'll be very generous and say it sells remorse or some sorry feeling very well.

**poppinmmolly** (8): the best song on the album

**awryj** (7.5): I remember I did an analysis of the grammatical structure of this song when we talked about the verb "wish" and how it changes the internal structure of the sentence in high school... and now I realize it's a sex jam lol

**vayyiqra** (7): This one really threw me off since I was not expecting an interpolation of ... Christmas music?? Which I am a hater of even though Popheads loves it?? But it grew on me. I'm reminded of the back half of Hounds of Love somehow.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I seriously can't believe I didn't get this album the first few times I listened to it! I'm not sure when I finally realised how good of a songwriter Joni is on this album, but thank God I did. I can write a lot of things about each song, from their lyrics to Joni's delivery to how effective their composition is, and what's impressive about that is that I won't just seem like I'm rambling. Every part of this album is carefully constructed, yet every part seems so genuine. I have a few very minor complaints about it here and there, but I wouldn't want to change anything. It's Joni's and Joni's alone. This is the pinnacle of artistry a singer-songwriter could ever hope to achieve, and it's for good reason.

**J\_Toe**: So, I first ‘discovered’ this album when I was 17. My Dad recommended it to me after I watched Vera Blue (then Celia Pavey) perform Woodstock on The voice AU. I was immediately CAPTIVATED. It was everything I was looking for in my pre-pop phase of wanting DEEP emotional jams. In fact, to this day I still regard Blue in my top 3 favourite albums of all time. I even wrote essays on it in my final year of High School English for a unit called Navigating the Global. It earned me top marks

**minibjork**: 10/10 reminds me of my rookiemag days

**TragicKingdom1**: I was very hopeful for this album and it met my expectations but didn't really surpass them. I had only heard "Big Yellow Taxi" beforehand and the charm of that song is really only evident on a few other songs. The rest of the album isn't bad whatsoever though, and Joni has a very distinctive folksy touch as a songwriter. I can't point to any song on this album as remotely bad and I liked the listening experience a lot but I won't be revisiting anytime soon. [Grade: A-]

**Benthetall1**: I’ve loved Joni Mitchell pretty much my entire life, so it’s hard not to feel somewhat biased here. Nonetheless, I really think this is one of the greatest albums of all time. Regardless of the actual average I gave it, this is my favorite one overall. The stunning work of a songwriter and poet going through considerable emotional turmoil. This album has been cathartic for me when I’ve needed it, and even on casual listen it remains gorgeous and compelling.

**MrSwearword**: This better not really be acclaimed for its deep, meaningful songwriting because I rebuke that demon made of lies.

**Discord\_and\_Dine**: "Little Green" and "River" are my two favorites on here. I've never been that big of a Joni fan (then again this is her first album I've listened to in full) but I found "Blue" to be poetic and sweet. Her delivery bugs me a little and some of the songs can seem a little sentimental but still there's definitely some magic here.

**stardustanddinos**: I found it difficult to get into this album, since I’m used to bombastic production and the traditional pop hooks. But then there is such an elegant yet innovative simplicity to the album here. It took me a few listens and reading about Joni’s personal life to understand it, and boy does it begin to shine through after that. There’s such resigned sadness yet hearty optimism, smiles behind pain. It’s not a tragic story, but it’s the experiences of a life, melancholy or not. The guitar is unlike anything I’ve ever heard, and her voice is just insanely expressive. This might be one of the best albums about heartbreak and love I’ve ever heard.

**Number3rdInTheVoting**: What a ride. I love how this album goes from extremely happy to extremely sad, it really had me smiling and crying until the end. Also her songwriting is brilliant (duh), Joni just transports you to other places so vividly it’s crazy. She’s so powerful ugh.

**somedizzywhore-1804**: “Masterpiece” is not an understatement when applied to this album: it showcases Joni as a master of her craft, perfectly encapsulating the highs and lows of a strange, turbulent period in her life. It’s not exactly a concept album but it coheres beautifully nonetheless. At first I thought there were a few issues with song sequencing and the subject matter seeming to jump around, but from my listens in this rate I see what a great narrative the songs form: she’s on the road, traveling, trying to run away from the pain of heartbreak, giving her child up for adoption, losing friends to drugs; at the end she comes home, but quickly finds herself conflicted about the decision and wanting to run away again. For me the message of this album is “wherever you go, you can’t escape yourself”.

**vayyiqra**: I suspected going into this rate that Joni was going to get my 11 since as a Canadian, her singles are a state-mandated part of our national curriculum. I was a bit surprised by this album since I had built up this image of it in my head as this emotionally wrenching, beautiful, ultimate depression album. It has moments like that, but most of it is not. Some of it is really fun and cute! I still liked it the best out of the four and I'm hoping she wins, not just because of national pride but because she is a great songwriter with a beautiful voice.

A classic. What is there to say about this song that hasn’t already been said? Carole is the queen of the pop song. Period.

---
**jamesfog** (11): A fucking classic

**Benthetall1** (10): Be still my heart. This is a perfect song, end stop. It’ll never be Aretha’s version of course, but there’s a serene brilliance to King’s version. It defines the concept of “quiet power”. It’s not the definitive version, but it stands in its own right, and you can’t deny she truly feels the song in her interpretation.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Carole always outshines the original artists on her renditions of her own songs. Sorry Aretha. RIP.

**MrSwearword** (10): an Aretha Franklin cover, let alone a regular cover, is risky territory. However, this version is not only perfectly formed for Carole, this is a cover that doesn't fuck with the original in unnecessary ways.

**napsandnetflix** (10): we love a rate winner

**ImADudeDuh** (9): this just makes me want to listen to the original again

**Leixander** (9): SOMETHING ABOUT YOU MAKES ME FEEL LIKE A NATURAL WOMAAAAAAAAAAAAAN

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): We all miss Aretha, don't we? It feels unbelievable that a month's passed after she did...truth to be told, the soul treatment her recording gave this song probably made it just a little bit better, there's something you just have to love about Carole's original. Her voice may not be as powerful or fearsome as Aretha's, but the softness and subtlety she presents makes for a surprisingly good album closer. You might mistake the song's melody for sounding like defeat rather than vulnerability and intimacy, but it's hard to find songs sweet as this one.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Yes, Aretha’s version is more iconic (and probably better) but what Carole lacks in technical ability, she makes up for pure emotive power.

**awryj** (8.8): finally a great song

**perfumevee** (8.5): I must say I am generally tired of this song by anyone except maybe Aretha Franklin and Carole.

**cloudbustingmp3** (6.2): godretha outsold

**vayyiqra** (6): I would rate this higher because it's objectively a great song, but I have this memory of one time at a show in high school when a hipster guy I know did an ironic cover of it, and it still makes me chuckle. Also, something about the phrase "natural woman" makes me think of TERFs. Weird associations, I know. But anyway, this song has been ruined for me.

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* Country and folk songs always have additional charm to them if they're telling a story, and that charm gets even stronger if that story's pulled out from the singer's life. Given that, it's no wonder this song was added to the National Recording Registry. Despite Dolly's sweet delivery, this is no soft song; the poverty she mentions in this song is a state she really lived in as a child, although, unfortunately, her original coat is long gone. Yet, despite the background details of Dolly's life, there's also a powerful sense of hope and innocence here, from the Biblical references to how Dolly simply sings everything simple, plain and clear. There are so many reasons why I could talk about why this is Dolly's most well-known somg and why it deserves all the acclaim it has anymore, but right now, all I can call it is a true American classic.

---
**ImADudeDuh** (11): Im gonna find these people who made fun of dolly and kick their asses even if they are like 80 now

**perfumevee** (11): I always feel the tears well up a little when I listen to this song. I can hear her mother's love through her words and voice.

**Benthetall1** (10): Parton is an incredibly engaging storyteller. I think this is a well-written, witty tale about pride and poverty. Parton sings it very sweetly, and it’s not hard to see how this is her personal favorite song.

**MrSwearword** (10): if you didn't know anything about Dolly before this album, you certainly do after this immersive opener.

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is a really sweet song

**skargardin** (10): YAS Dolly I love this

**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): Such a timeless, lovely song.

**jamesfog** (9.5): Cuuute

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): A little too saccharine for me but still it's very sweet

**tapdancingpig** (9): Awww now I’m happy.

**1998tweety** (8.4): Dolly's ability to tell a story so well is definitely her strong point.

**awryj** (8.2): this is the cutest thing ever

**J\_Toe** (8): such a beautiful story. So original and so vivid.

**patronsaintofaspies**: I'm going to be honest. This kinda feels like a 'Best of 1971' album, not a 'Best of All Time' album. I do think it's a short and sweet listen, and it's certainly one of the best albums could pass a small amount of time with, but there's something lacking in this record that the other had. I think its shortness is its undoing-Dolly doesn't even have thirty minutes to astound us here, and while she does, it's not enough to create an atmosphere like Blue or Tapestry or even Pearl. That being said, Dolly is certainly a very talented songwriter, and this record shows her skill. It's one of the first old country albums I've listened to, and it's certainly a great one.

**J\_Toe**: I found out about this album before any of the others because it is my uncle’s favourite album, lol

**TragicKingdom1**: This was a really cute album. I wasn't blown away but it definitely was a great listening experience, and I can't point to a low point. Dolly has a ton of personality and a great knack for storytelling in her songs. It was amazing how I had never heard any of these songs before but they all felt like classics. This album is extremely consistent and I can't imagine anyone having strong negative feelings towards it because of how short and sweet it is. [Grade: A-]

**perfumevee**: I love all these albums, but Dolly is my queen!

**Benthetall1**: In my opinion, this album feels the least cohesive of the four. And, to be honest, it was the only one I hadn’t heard before this rate, and I think it continues to be my least favorite of the four. That being said, it’s still an excellent country classic. Parton’s charisma and personality really do shine through in all of her songs. It’s also feels like an eyeblink of an album, clocking in at less than half an hour. I don’t have a ton of familiarity with country, but I am developing a soft spot for Dolly. And if you’ve never visited Dolly Parton Las Vegas (Pigeon Forge, TN) shit’s WILD.

**MrSwearword**: Who gives a shit what I or anyone has to say about this album? Dolly Parton has her own fucking theme park. Our faves could never.

**Discord\_and\_Dine**: Jolene still reigns supreme over all of Dolly's other compositions but I found this album to be very nice indeed. "Early Morning Breeze" and "Traveling Man" were my favorites. Some of the album tracks are kinda forgettable but they can't all be winners can they?

**stardustanddinos**: I did not think much of this album in the beginning. But in the simplicity and the experiences of a life are where the most profound things happen. Dolly’s voice is mellow and emotional, pouring themes of adversity, love and family into all these songs. What a delightful listen.

**vayyiqra**: Oof. I knew going in that I would have trouble with this one. Aside from the pop perfection that is Jolene, I have never understood the appeal of Dolly Parton or why she is an icon, gay or otherwise. Maybe I'm too cynical but this album seemed very mediocre to me and didn't fit the folk-pop sound of this rate. I have no idea why we rated this other than that it's from the same year as the other three. However, I also have some self-awareness and admit I am a country anti and heavily biased against the genre. I tried to keep an open mind, but Dolly still got my lowest rating. Yeehaw, I guess.

An amazing opener from Carole. As I was receiving submissions, I was excited to see how much love this song was getting. “I Feel the Earth Move” really sets the tone for the standard of pop music that Carole is about to flex throughout the rest of the record.

---
**cloudbustingmp3** (11): i feel my wig move off of my head

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (11): Every second of this song pulses with energy and repressed feelings. I don’t think I’ve ever gotten so much emotion in such a compact package

**Ghost-Quartet** (11): Wasn’t sure what to give my 11 to so I just kind of went to this. I’m not even sure that it’s my favorite in the rate, but I find it the easiest to listen to. I jam to this song hard, it gives me great vibes. I wish it were longer, but that’s always a compliment for a song. There’s just so much power in this recording, Carole and her band really feel like they’re moving the Earth!

**Benthetall1** (10): Wow Carole King didn’t need to raise the bar with the very first song but she sure did. This song is a perfect slice of sunny California soft rock. Try to get this song out of your head. Just try.

**J\_Toe** (10): Amazing song. I wish it was featured in Tim Burton’s Dark Shadows (lol, don’t @ me, that movie had potential, it just needed a different scriptwriter, but that’s a rant for another day). these four albums all have amazing opening tracks, and this song is no exception. My favourite Carole King song.

**MrSwearword** (10): THIS OPENS THE ALBUM? HOLY SHIT, Carole ain't fucking around.

**tapdancingpig** (10): This is easily one of the most iconic pop songs of time. Plus, I stan random modulations between verses and choruses, and this features one of those.

**TragicKingdom1** (10): an immaculate bop

**ImADudeDuh** (9): kinda a bop, but feels like a white girl covering a soul classic just a little too much

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): So, here I was, sleep-deprived, wondering what to about this song in my comment, when my school bell sounded and I went into a panic over the possibility of us experiencing a real earthquake. As it turned out, it was actually just a drill. Grr. Still, considering this track's title, that was pretty funny. Anyway, it's a bit strange to open Tapestry with a fierce anthem like this when the rest of the album is full of ballads. Carole sounds *so* awesome here that I usually have a hard time believing that this is a 'love is chaos!' song and not a empowerment anthem. Maybe that misunderstanding is my only real problem with it. I Feel the Earth Move is amazing, and it continues this rate's tendency to introduce me to high-quality openers.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): this took me by surprise

**Arybeck67** (8.9): such a bop

**somedizzywhore-1804** (7.9): I love this song but I just wanted more from this particular recording/performance. Maybe it’s the mix or the mastering, but it feels like it never… quite… gets to where it deserves to go.

deleted: # Tapestry

---

**Overall average**: 8.335

**patronsaintofaspies**: I'm more divided about the second half of the rate than the first, and I'm not sure what to think about Tapestry in particular. It's definitely one hell of a well-written album, and the simplicity of Carole's delivery and production only adds to the record's charm. However, as much as this approach helps, it also detracts. Some of the songs blended with each other after time, and, unfortunately, while Carole's voice isn't terrible, it's only passable, which prevents some of the tracks here from achieving their true potential. Still, for all the flaws it may have, I definitely enjoy Tapestry. It's an amazing album by an amazing musician.

**J\_Toe**: Again, I had this album recommended to me by my Dad after watching Vera Blue (then Celia Pavey) perform Will You Still Love Me on The Voice AU. I had already been listening to Blue for a few weeks at this point, and Tapestry was exactly what I was looking for as the next album to dig my teeth into.

**TragicKingdom1**: Don't kill me but I was a little bit let down by this album. I know easy listening/singer-songwriter music doesn't typically appeal to me but I thought Carole's songwriting ability alone would be able to overcome that! Unfortunately, the songs really blended together in a non-immersive way and there were definitely points where I was bored. It's just a little too low energy for my taste. Obviously it's still an essential pop listen with a few undisputed highlights (especially I Feel The Earth Move) but it might not be the album that gets you into 70s pop. [Grade: B]

**perfumevee**: I think I forgot how amazing this album is!

**Benthetall1**: This is THE Carole King album, and what a treasure it is. I’d say while it’s always a bit mellow and breezy (kind of an all-purpose listening album, tbh), the songwriting is effervescent, showing off why King was both a successful songwriter in the early 60s and an engaging performer in her own right. Each of these albums shines in a specific way. For Tapestry, King’s professional gravitas and comfortable maturity in her lyrics distinguish her from the rest. It’s the perfect album for a slow, easy Sunday morning.

**MrSwearword**: I love it when I get bits and pieces of why an acclaimed album ended up as such.

**tapdancingpig**: I head never listened through this in its entirety, so I was shocked that I at least recognized the choruses of half of these songs. But honestly, it’s what she deserves. This album is a classic for a reason. It has some of the best lyrics, melodies, and production of all time.

**vayyiqra**: This was my second-favourite album of the four, yet I wouldn't rate it above a strong 6 to light 7. It's not bad, it's just (to borrow a phrase I love from a review of Pure Heroine) aggressively okay. I know a few of the songs on it, but from cover versions that are frankly better. Carole King? More like Carole ... duke or some other mid-tier noble. :pensive:

**Ghost-Quartet**: My favorite album in the rate, my scores reflect that. I don’t think the others are bad, they just aren’t to my tastes.
