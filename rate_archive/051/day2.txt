# Hi there! Welcome back to the Women in Music: 1971 rate reveal!

I’m your host, /u/whatareblackhole, and I’m so excited to blast back to 1971 with you all today for Day 2 of the reveal!

Today, I will be revealing songs **30-16** in our [Plug.dj room](https://plug.dj/popheads)! Instead of hints today, I’m going to help you get some of the [2008 Super Mega Deluxe Ultimate Rate]( https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/9ceqs8/2008_super_mega_deluxe_ultimate_rate/) done by playing two songs from each of the albums presented! Get those submission forms ready!
 
For this rate we had...

-	...**35 people submit scores.** Thank you for participating! I know for at least **1** of those people, this was their first rate – welcome to all you first time submitters! 
-	...**an average score of 8.1516.** Deserving for such an excellent group of songs!
-	...**an average controversy score of 1.3565.** You should expect controversy with four icons in the room.
- 	...multiple people submitting assays for some of the songs! I had some host comments written, but they pale in comparison to what many others have written about these songs. I’ve made sure to separate their comments from the others, so be on the lookout for those!

*From /u/J_Toe:* The piano on this track is different to the dulcimer driven tracks we have heard all throughout this album. Still, the song works. The truth behind the album has been completely unlocked. Joni has spent this whole album skirting around the topic of her heartbreak, so it is important that the album closes with an honest acknowledgement of where life is at this point.

---
**somedizzywhore-1804** (11): I love it when Joni writes songs that don’t fit easily into any particular genre. They usually end up astounding and this one is no exception. The piano intro is one of my favourite instrumental sections of the album. The lyrics are pure genius. The emotion, vulnerability and sweetness in her voice are breathtaking. A brilliant, heartbreaking closer to a brilliant, heartbreaking album.

**Arybeck67** (10): A fantastic closer to this album of melancholy and loneliness. I hope none of us end up like Richard, drunk, and completely without joy.

**Number3rdInTheVoting** (10): This was such a beautiful closer I have no words.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Instead of being a poet, musician or painter, in this closing track, Joni takes the position of...a writer. One thing you learn if you're writing creative fiction or non-fiction is to show, not tell. It's a oft-repeated piece of advice you get tired of hearing, but Joni shows why it's a powerful one. The story in this song benefits from being told through the guise of conversation. You only hear one lousy talk between Joni and this guy who she assigned Richard as a pseudonym to, but it's enough to make you get a hint about both of their possibilities, and it's about to make you think about who you side with. As for Joni, she changes her mind when we reach the song's conclusion, which is maddening and frustrating in its candidness. And right after, with a few ominous piano notes, the album ends in a perfect conclusion.

**tapdancingpig** (9): I love narrative songs so much.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): A beautiful song that really gets me optimistic about everything but I saw the title and thought "The Last Time I Saw Dick"

**Benthetall1** (8): The last song on this album is not one of its more memorable ones, yet still a mournful tune with some excellent piano instrumental. Her poetic story weaving is often quite excellent, if a bit obtuse.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): Not a bad song to end an album on, but I would have preferred “River”.

**MrSwearword** (1): JESUS CHRIST, THIS IS INSUFFERABLE AND A HORRIBLE CLOSER. GURL, BYE.

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* This Flight Tonight is kind of a hard song to judge, owing in part to its ethereal, breezy atmosphere, which fits it nicely considering its title. It seems to be a track that's drawn out of a specific memory, and it leaves you wondering if the flight Joni's talking about is something more than just a metaphor. A fairly unexpected playback effect also lends to this interpretation. It's one of the few non-acoustic sections in this album, and it feels like it's straight up drawn from Joni's mind. It's more of a bridge than a highlight, but it's still a damn good one.

---
**Arybeck67** (9.7): It’s a bop bop bop

**tapdancingpig** (9): The “Goodbye baby goodbye” part made me smile way more than it probably should have.

**Benthetall1** (8.5): This is a fun song with fast, witty wordplay. Another one where it only feels like I need to rate this lower because of the formidable company I’m trying to compare it to.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): My favorite title on the record, but not my favorite song...still great, though.

**J\_Toe** (8): “got the head phones up high / can’t numb you out / can’t drum you out of my mind”. Again, Joni’s persona is using global products in order to distance herself from the life she is leaving behind in America. But it is futile.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (7.8): There are parts of this song I love, especially the soaring melody on the “starlight, starbright” refrain, but ultimately it’s my least favourite on the album. I can’t quite put my finger on why. The song-inside-a-song interlude is really clever, but I kind of hate it for some reason? The words don’t particularly speak to me either.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): god, i really love the lyrical imagery of this song but that fucking jumpscare

**MrSwearword** (5): too boring for derision

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* Unfortunately, this may be a little overshadowed by coming before Me and Bobby McGee. While it's not as good as Cry Baby, it's another song that aligns with Janis' voice despite being a ballad that's somewhat more blues than fast-paced rock. The end of the chorus in particular shows that the raspiness in it has merit, rather than being an annoying flaw. There's some very nice background music here, too.

---
**TragicKingdom1** (11): the "MY BABYYYYY" yell is euphoric, and the whole song feels like a soul revival as described by maren morris in her instant classic "my church." this was the song i kept wanting to revisit after finishing the rate and thus it is my 11 unless i decide to switch to Bobby McGee at some point!

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I love the fact she refers to herself in first person. Great guitar solo as well.

**Leixander** (9): :kimbryell:

**Benthetall1** (8): I would say this is my least favorite song on the album, just because I find it comparatively pretty simplistic. All the components of essential Janis are here, and I think this album’s consistency is really incredible overall. Also, very nice guitar solo bridge. Still, it feels like bombast over substance, or the closest Pearl gets to it at least.

**MrSwearword** (8): pretty cute

**somedizzywhore-1804** (7.5): I’m finding it really hard to give any of these songs below a 7.5 because even when I don’t actually like the song that much, I can’t get over the fact that she’s just SO GOOD.

**Arybeck67** (7.3): “MY DADDY’s NAME” ahh none of these songs aged well oof 🤦‍♀️

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* You're wrong, Dolly. Climate change is gonna kill us all. I don't know why there were so many songs like this back in the day, but I do like this better than the previous two songs, and I think it's a good closer to Coat of Many Colors. Okay, maybe this is a little too heartfelt and generic, but this is Dolly speaking, I feel like she cares about this at least a little bit. And how could you not like it when Dolly sings those 'la la la la's?

**awryj** (8): stop being so messy poopheads smh

**Benthetall1** (8): A bright, hopeful way to end the album. Maybe a little overly sentimental for my taste but I didn’t really penalize some of the others for it so I won’t be too hard.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): It’s a good song. Classic Dolly. Not much left to say.

**MrSwearword** (7): because it ends like an after school special which makes perfect sense for a Dolly album.

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): I don’t know why but this kind of country has always given me a weird “surfer” vibe, not sure what it is. Cowabungah dudes.

Ugh, I hate that Gilmore Girls ruined this. I like this song just fine, but it’s never been my favorite. It has a very catchy melody and is kind of hokey in all the wrong ways. After You’ve Got a Friend, it doesn’t have as much resonance.

---
**poppinmmolly** (10): I love this song so much it was almost my 11 I just think it's so sweet

**ulikejazz** (9.6): My ultimate junior-high-after-school-bop. I sacrificed my computer for this by giving it like fifteen viruses while downloading the song from Limewire lol.

**jamesfog** (9.5): I love Gilmore Girls

**J\_Toe** (9): “I always wanted a real home, baby/ with flowers on the window sill”. Well, as the album artwork demonstrates, she got an apartment with a cat on the window sill instead (I’m sorry, I just had to)

**Benthetall1** (8): A nice little guitar and keyboard jam. I appreciate the break from the ballads, keeps things fresh. This is a good song, if not one of the giants in the big picture.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): It’s a nice song...good for an album track

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): This is genuinely a cute song! It might be too fluffy for some people, compared to the brutally honest lyrics on the rest of the album, but despite that being a valid reason to dislike it, I can't help but enjoy how adorable it is. It sounds like a perfect track to play at the coffee table during breakfast. Sure, it'd fit as the cheesy song your mom requests on adult radio, but is that really a bad thing? Not the best song on Tapestry by far, but delightfully simple.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Lovely

**vayyiqra** (7): I was excited to give this a high score as Gilmore Girls stan (I'm a straight man and I have probably cried to GG before, fite me) but this isn't as good as the version from the show. :/ Disappointment.

**MrSwearword** (5): wait a damn minute, didn't she literally just sing about being there for a friend literally ONE TRACK AGO...at least this is cute.

Okay, I think this song kind of got paid dust because I think this is kind of a great torch song. She’s singing so earnestly of where she wants to be and how she’ll get there. And the instrumental break is heavenly, especially as it closes the first half of the record.

---
**Benthetall1** (10): Carole King has soul. This is an incredible performance, it just sizzles. King knows how to sing with force and confidence even though her voice doesn’t give her the widest range. She knows how to compose songs that she can sing just as well as anyone she wrote for.

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’m not religious but like, sometimes I hear songs and I can’t wait for Heaven.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): so evocative...

**tapdancingpig** (8.5): I love 6/8 more than I probably should, which made me like this more by default, but Way Over Yonder earned my love with its key change and oddly nostalgic sounding lyrics.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (8.1): Loooove me a slow soulful blues jam.  This song could be seen as a bit boring, but Carole's voice is particularly lovely, and the little flourishes like the drum roll and sudden cut-off at 1:08 or the high-octave backing vocal line at 1:26 and the SAX SOLO add the necessary texture to maintain my interest and enjoyment.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): A little slow for me but I like the wordplay

**MrSwearword** (8): deserves a few high marks

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Oh, hey, wasn't this a cartoon? Way over Yonder has the same problems as Beautiful. What am I supposed to get from this song? Wanderlust? Longing? Is Carole daydreaming? Frustratingly, I can't seem to pin down what this song is trying to do. It's completely out of character and it's a bit dull. That said, it still gets a score for solid lyricism, even if her lackluster performance makes me unsure about what it all means. Carole doesn't utilise her strengths enough in this track.

**jamesfog** (5): This is too bland to be this long

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* This was definitely one of the songs in this rate that grew on me the most. At first, I thought it was another forgettable short song on Dolly's album, but then I paid attention to Dolly's voice on the verses and the great guitar work, and I realized that I actually liked it. The atmosphere Dolly indicates in its title definitely isn't just a ruse, because the entire song carries out, culminating in a track I'm able to seriously appreciate. My only problem with it is that Dolly's delivery sounds kinda shrill on the chorus. I'd like somebody else to record this and see how it goes.

---
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I honestly feel like I’m walking in the meadow with Dolly what a poet what an icon

**Benthetall1** (8.5): I love how the song is stripped down to really focus on the bassline, it’s more of a lead instrument in this track than the acoustic guitar. Neat.

**awryj** (8): lowkey an earworm

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Flower imagery guarantees a good score from me.

**MrSwearword** (8): kind of different but welcome especially most of the on par dreck in between title track and "she's a whore". Though I swear some of those drum patterns got hella sampled in most pop songs throughout the years.

**tapdancingpig** (8): Sweet and lovely

*From /u/Benthetall1:* And we’re upbeat again! Great groove here, with some excellent production. Sure, the flourishes are very early 70s, but it just WORKS. Joplin was always in her element when she could rock out.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (8): It’s a good album track...

**MrSwearword** (8): weirdly upbeat but Joplin's vocals slay

**patronsaintofaspies** (7.5): There's something a little less organic about this song. It was one of the original compositions from this album not written by Janis (fun fact, one of the songwriters credited now works in politics) and while it's a very fun one, featuring astrological and numerological symbology that makes you think that Janis is Sinbad the Sailor, it's not as impactful as several other tracks on Pearl.

**MrSwearword** (8): cute closer

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): Not as glamorous as the beginning or even the middle of this album, but do we need a showstopper to close the door on Janis' career? Who knows if this was actually going to end the album before she died, but given the title, it feels really fitting as an end note. Janis puts on a teasing, charming performance here with just a hint of melancholy, and then, suddenly, while you start to connect to the song, it ends; the final reminder given is that we should be glad we got Janis' career while we could. Rating the two female members of the 27 Club back to back has been an emotionally exhausting experience, but I'd be damned if it wasn't a worhwhile one.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (7.3): Musically, this one just reminded me too much of Cry Baby at points. Points for the guitar solo.

*From /u/patronsaintofaspies:* Remember when I complained about Dolly's voice being too shrill on Early Morning Breeze? Well, guess what! Her voice definitely isn't fit for this song! I actually don't dislike this track, because there's some very nice guitar work, and I think it actually sounds genuinely warm. The thing is, I wish Dolly did this differently. The song sounds like something that's meant to perk your spirits up, but it doesn't quite get there. Maybe a little too bit sugary for my tastes, but it's still decent.

---
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): No explanation for this grade is needed

**Ghost-Quartet** (10): It gets a ten for those opening line alone! She immediately grabs you and then she keeps you.

**Benthetall1** (9): A not-quite-gospel country song. One of her best performances vocals-wise on the record. Emotional, musically tight, and overall an excellent package.

**rotating3Dtext** (9): makes me feel like i'm watching a sunset

**TragicKingdom1** (9): really beautiful melody, best on the album as a result

**MrSwearword** (6): jesus christ how much of this mediocrity do I have left

Another bop! Carole is the queen of positivity and she really tells it like it is on this number. I got up this morning with a smile on my face to show the world all the love in my heart…did you, r/popheads???

---
**Ghost-Quartet** (10): I’ll try Carole, I’ll try.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (9): I love the subtle electric organs here. This one feels like a march of sorts to me.

**tapdancingpig** (9): This is how you pull off a modulation, children.

**Benthetall1** (8.5): This song feels a little more dated than some of the other compositions here. Since King came to fruition as a songwriter in the girl group days her songwriting carries a certain sensibility that even in 1971 must have felt a little retro. I enjoy it nonetheless, of course.

**J\_Toe** (8): “You got to get up every morning with a smile on your face” is such a relatable lyric.

**jamesfog** (7.5): Good message, but Xtina outsang

**MrSwearword** (7): lackluster but above par

**patronsaintofaspies** (7): Like Pearl, I feel like the album begins to dip a little here for me; not surprising, given that it's the longest one. So, why do I think Tapestry drops a bit in quality around Beautiful? Well, thanks to Carole's songwriting skills, Beautiful is still something I wouldn't object listening to; it's a noble premise, it clearly wasn't intended to be a shallow lecture, and it feels relevant instead of distant. Still, for all Carole tries to make this work, it's still hard to see this as a standout song; there are interesting observations she makes within the song, but this song ultimately fails to capture the entirety of my attention.

**awryj** (3): this sounds like a generic song they'd put on the radio in a tv show when a character has a deep conversation with someone while driving in a car

The penultimate song on the record, the title track, the song that makes you look at the album as a whole…I love this song for its imagery and what it makes the listener think about. Carole has woven a tapestry of sound with stories of her life and her work on this album.

---
**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): I have no clue what the guy turning into a frog has to do with death coming for Carole but I don’t care...with such high quality as this no explanation is needed.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): Ah, back to that imagery I missed from earlier on. More than anything else, Tapestry's title track shows that Carole's no Tolkien. She's fond of allegory. The lyrics are fairly unique for a pop ballad, sounding more like a song from a children's television adaption of a fable or folktale than anything else, and the use of colour strikes the listener the first time they hear this one. Sadly, it's not quite remembered as the big hits that accompanied it. I can't imagine why. Alright, the metaphors might actually be a little shaky when you look at them closely (I can't decide whether I like the toad one or not), but Carole weaves (heh) an absolutely gorgeous story here that deserves to be acknowledged as one of the highlights of this album.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): hey! she said the name of that other album!

**ImADudeDuh** (8): ugh queen of promoing dolly

**J\_Toe** (8): so story-like

**Benthetall1** (7): “A coat of many colors” eh? Dolly’s going to sue. This is probably my least favorite song on the album. It’s not bad (I’m giving it a “terrible” 7/10) but it’s a ballad that feels far longer than it actually is, and in the grand scheme of things is perfectly fine and comparatively unmemorable.

**MrSwearword** (6): barely above par but this almost bored me

**somedizzywhore-1804** (5.1): Okay… I hate to give any song in this rate a bad score. And I’m super conflicted because I want to love this song. But between the lyrics and the chords and the vocal delivery, it just came across as really hokey to me.

A classic song of Carole’s written repertoire. This song is recognizable to most, and this version of the song is wonderfully emotive and the perfect amount of Carole.

---
**Benthetall1** (10): This is a legendary song by the Shirelles. King reclaims it, slows it down, and gives a heartfelt interpretation with James Taylor and Joni Mitchell helping her out. One of the best moments of the entire album, for its simplicity and impact.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Carole’s own version of this adds this wistful tinge that makes it so much better. Plus who doesn’t like Joni Mitchell and James Taylor on backing vocals

**tapdancingpig** (10): I love this song so much, and I will always think of this version as the definitive version. Yeah, the original one is a bop and a half, but the emotion in this version is fucking gorgeous.

**skargardin** (9.5): Is that Joni on the backing vocals? Shook!

**J\_Toe** (9): The first Carole King song I ever heard, and still one of my favourites. It’s so tender and powerful, like the tracks on Joni Mitchell’s Blue.

**rotating3Dtext** (8.8): i like the harmonies

**Arybeck67** (8.3): one night stand land of uncertainty

**MrSwearword** (8): a pretty good song but not stellar

**patronsaintofaspies** (8): As opposed to the assurance Carole expresses on the previous song, this piano-backed track feels like a lost classic about the kind of insecurity that either makes a relationship or breaks it. The melody might also be a little too kitschy for your taste, but though the song might veer into territory too plain and sweet, it still acts a decent branch to the ends of the album. It's a typical 70s hit, but at least it's still a good one.

*From /u/J_Toe:* This song was a mystery for thirty years. In the nineties it came to light that Joni had in her past given birth to a child that she had to give up for adoption. Society stigmatized single mothers in the late sixties and early seventies. And as captured by the lyric “child with a child pretending” Joni felt as though she didn’t have the resources needed to raise a child on her own. It’s such a sad and complex predicament. Also, the child’s name was Kelly, hence the title Little Green; little cos she’s little, and green because of the colour Kelly Green.

---
**Arybeck67** (10): The backstory of this song is just so damn sad. Joni wrote this about giving her daughter Kelly up for adoption, hence the “green” when she was basically destitute in Canada. In the early days of preforming this song, sometimes she used to say “Kelly green” instead of just green. Just so heartbreaking.

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): Giving a child up for adoption is one of the hardest things someone can do....

**somedizzywhore-1804** (10): Everything works together in this song - the hypnotic guitar backing, the text, the tenderness and sadness in Joni’s voice… The way she manages to encapsulate such a complex story in just three and a half minutes blows my mind. And the way she ever-so-quietly draws out the last vowel in the final “sometimes there’ll be sorrow”… goddamn.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9.5): Unfortunately, we don't have very many snapshots of Joni's personal life to make us understand every lyric on Blue, aside from a few names here and there, but Little Green has perhaps one of her most well-known backstories for a song. As I hope most people doing this rate are aware of, the lyrics here aren't fictional. They're not even much of an exaggeration. Joni did have a daughter she gave up for adaption in the 1960s, though, fortunately, they reunited a couple of decades after this song was released. Knowing the story behind this song definitely enhances my appreciation of it even further; Joni illustrates a striking portrayal of raising a child in their early years, which makes it all the more sadder when I gets to the part where she 'sign(s) the papers in the family name'. Her final conclusion that she's 'sorry but not ashamed' of her daughter is a powerful statement to end the song with, despite how full of regret and melancholy it's sung with. It's telling that on an album full of failed love affairs, this song is the one that makes the most out of drawing from Joni's personal life.

**Benthetall1** (9): This song breaks my heart. It’s one of her oldest songs, written soon after she gave up her daughter in the mid 60s. Here, it’s less the lyric than HOW Joni sings it. Only she could convey her own loss so effectively.

**tapdancingpig** (9): Oh God. This got way sadder after I found out that it was about giving up a baby.

**MrSwearword** (5): "he's a non-conformer" OK what the fuck was that? At least her singing is pleasing this time but the lyrics really do suck.

*From /u/Benthetall1:* One of my personal favorite Joni songs ever. This album introduced me to the concept of the dulcimer, and the interplay between that and the guitar here is stunning. Also the storytelling in her lyrics just cannot be overpraised, tbh.

---
**awryj** (10): so this is basically the opposite of the Grimes song (and a better song at that)

**Discord\_and\_Dine** (10): The lyrics are so poetic and sweet. It’s kinda ironic cause she’s from Canada haha

**ImADudeDuh** (10): She hates war? She's hung up on a man? She uses california in a good light? we STAN

**J\_Toe** (10): My second favourite song of the album and really drives home the narrative of escaping America in search for an ‘authentic’ isolated European utopia, which is itself an extension of Joni’s desire to search for an ‘authentic’ side to herself in the wake of a tough break up. She hops across three locations, Paris, Greece, and Spain. None of these locales are cut off from the global. The friends she makes at a party in Spain are reading Rolling Stone and Vogue. The Redneck on the Grecian Isle takes her camera, a symbol of her perspective being entrenched in global products. Most importantly, her excuse for never staying in the one place is that she wants a tan. It is an obvious lie. Just as a tan only goes skin deep, Joni’s persona isn’t diving deep enough into the truth of her travel. As we find out in the song’s close, she is traveling to get over her recent heart break. Interestingly, the song ends on a bridge. This unconventional structure is unresolved, as a reflection of Joni’s understanding of her identity in this chapter of her life.

**somedizzywhore-1804** (9.2): I’ve never been to California and this song still manages to make me homesick for it.

**patronsaintofaspies** (9): It's not obvious at first sight, but this is a track full of contrast. It begins with Joni rather cynically referencing a then-recent quote from John Lennon, which stands among some of the first signs she shows of rejecting the counterculture some might associate her with. Still, despite being accompanied by similarly candid mentions of Rolling Stone and Vogue, California doesn't end up feeling sour or ironic.  As a song, it emulates its title by seeming fit for a warm, summer's day, which makes me get the impression that even if Joni isn't particularly excited or optimistic about the things going around her, she doesn't find it worthwhile to dwell on being unhappy. The subtle contrast ends up forming a full picture instead of making different aspects clash against each other, which should come as no surprise, given that Joni's a painter as well as a musician.

**Arybeck67** (8.9): Ayyyy my state’s anthem

**skargardin** (8): She really kicked that score up a notch with the final lines!

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): I felt like a dog in a car seeing a dog outside of a car every time she said “California” I was like “that’s where I’m from!”

**MrSwearword** (0): this has less pitch than a man with no arms trying to throw a baseball and this is one of the worst written songs ever. NO; get it away from me.
