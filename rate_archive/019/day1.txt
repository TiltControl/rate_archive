**VeganSquash**: "sets up the album well, better then TLC did. I like how it follows a concept with the commandments."

**Jelboo**: "what the fuck. They sound like ET. I know what they were trying but who starts an album with two awful minutes of incredibly bad Don Corleone impressions?!"

**borpo**: "The music is good, but the voiceover is kind of wack"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "me when im trying to write"

**joshually**: "wtf even. I honestly don't know whether to give this a 0 or an 11"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "lmao what is this??? I'll just give this a 10 for the memes."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "is this supposed to give like a Spanish vibe? Is this cultural appropriation? Also, this is really corny I’m dying of laughter right now. Please stop this."

**nerfherder01**: "this is pure cringe"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Was this written by an 8th grader who just watched Scarface for the first time right after a break-up?"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Sets the tone of the album but idk who's supposed to be speaking"

**mokitsu**: "this sounds like when daenerys is talking in dothraki. i have no ideia what he's saying"

**MrSwearword**: "this is just weird as hell."

**Zamomattel**: "Kind of weird, but alright as intros go"

**twat_brained**: "The beginning sounds more like Sam Smith's "Writing on the Wall" than DC. Also, what the hell is that accent? Is this some kind of concept album? Idk what to make of this intro."

**gannade**: "i was prepared to be so shook but this voice acting lmao"

**Lowest Scores:** (0 x1) gannade (1 x2) VeganSquash, letsallpoo (2 x3) nerfherder01, BlasiFeelsSwift, johnazoidberg- 

---
**VeganSquash**: "this song has been done so many times that it needs to be retired. Also, who is Andrea Tillman (person this is dedicated to)? Tried googling her but only a book came up."

**Jelboo**: "I listen to music that has christian/religious overtones regularly, and regularly don't mind at all. Some of my biggest faves were very religious. But their music surpassed that, it is of no issue to me. This sounds sweet and all but now that the message is so front and center, I don't really appreciate it."

**borpo**: "The ending saves it, it’s almost like a parody of a girl group at the beginning."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I want this to be sung at my funeral by a priest in rainbow vestments. But, seriously, listening to this song and realizing how fondly Destiny's Child is remembered today is touching."

**joshually**: "seriously, much like Latavia, Letoya and Kelendria (and later, Tenetria and Danisha), I too, was LO-WOA-WOA-WOA-OST until I was found… by BEYONCE. Praise her and her miraculous heavenly goodness. But in all seriousness, can we talk about the harmonies in this banger? I am sweating from my armpits just listening to its pure vocal powers. Well! Thank you Lawdyonce!"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this feels really really out of place"

**nerfherder01**: "IS THIS LA FWAY :D"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Albums do not, never have, and never will need intro and outro tracks. At least this one's music, though"

**TragicKingdom1**: "vocals"

**mokitsu**: "the harmonies.....i feel the holy ghost"

**MrSwearword**: "nice, competent rendition of Amazing Grace."

**jess_22**: "not a fan of this rendition tbh"

**Zamomattel**: "HARMONIESSS BITCH"

**twat_brained**: "**THEY DID #THAT.** If Beyoncé didn't keep oversinging and hogging all the attention, though, this would be a 10 from me. Still a fantastic tribute, though!"

**gannade**: "please this is not how you reinvent a classic at all. looks like this is the song that inspired xtina's idea of a good vocal"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "nothing special hear but it sounds nice"

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Giving this a 10 for da memes lol"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "lmao best thing ever"

**nerfherder01**: "super unnecessary"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Yes, that is the title of your album. Great job"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Why am I giving this a score"

**MrSwearword**: "just filler…like…OK fine…the album title is CrazySexyCool but get this filler the fuck up outta here."

**jess_22**: "i would seriously listen to this on repeat without guilt"

**Zamomattel**: "THIS IS BASICALLY AN EVEN LESS NEEDED VERSION OF THE INTRO"

**twat_brained**: "Umm… okay? Was this necessary? I mean, it sounds cool and all but it’s pure filler."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "funny story the first time i listened to this album my autism acted up and i legit didn't get that chili was prank calling puff daddy and i thought that they were having some weird anal sex lmao"

**whatyourheartdesires**: "omg"

**nerfherder01**: "ok that’s fuunneh but breaks the flow of the album tbh"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Non-musical album interludes, prank phone calls, old corny street jokes - this is a Donald Trump soundbite away from being everything I hate listening to"

**TragicKingdom1**: "this interlude actually adds to the vibe of the album imo"

**MrSwearword**: "OK it’s phone sex which happened in the 90s…"

**jess_22**: "um... well that was... interesting"

**Zamomattel**: "SO FUCKING WEIRD KIND OF LIVE THOUGH"

**twat_brained**: "When I first listened to this, it gave me IMMENSE secondhand embarrassment. I’m not about to listen to it again because A), it’s blatant filler and B), it does not belong on this album. If this is not first out in the rate this sub is cancelled."

**DoctorWhoWhenHowWhy**: "Yas TLC and Busta Rhymes promoting Witness decades ahead of the release. #BuyWitnessoniTunes"

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "why are there so many interludes?"

**nerfherder01**: "waste of a feature"

**johnazoidberg-**: "Not even Busta Bust can make these interludes enjoyable. How did this track happen? "Hey Busta, we want you on the album" "Oh, you want me to do a verse on one of your songs?" "No, we want you to spend 3 minutes non-rhythmically talking about what you like in a woman. The more it sounds like a very long intro to something people would actually want to listen to, the better" I was legitimately excited when I saw "feat Busta Rhymes" and then this happened and I feel betrayed and I need a hug."

**TragicKingdom1**: "Busta is a perfect fit for this album, glad they got him even before he was that popular"

**mokitsu**: "katy is shook"

**MrSwearword**: "this sounds like someone who masturbates furiously…like I’m #TeamDryRub too but goddamn."

**twat_brained**: "What the hell is Busta on in this interlude? It doesn’t make much sense to me, and all this really has going for it is the beat, which even then isn’t all that great. This album doesn’t need filler, so why am I hearing it? SMH, I expected better from you, girls."

**VeganSquash**: "another boring ass song. On a side note, I thought this was a self-empowerment album??? Why they be like "I need you!!!" and shit, like what?"

**patronsaintofaspies**: "I really love this one!"

**joshually**: "it’s crazy how you can clearly hear when it’s DESTINY’s CHILD singing the choruses vs. just Beyonce x 4 (say my name). The chorus of this song is SO rich, and that’s how it should be with four different vocalists."

**BlasiFeelsSwift**: "this has not aged well, neither has Beyoncé"

**nerfherder01**: "the album begins to sound too samey and uninspired"

**TragicKingdom1**: "Say My Name lite, basically"

**MrSwearword**: "uptempo fluff"

**jess_22**: "this should have been a single, the harmonies are on point"

**Zamomattel**: "More placid than I think it's trying to be"

**4Roux**: "The chorus isn’t as catchy as the ones that came before but the delivery of the lines is what makes this song stand out for me, like when her voice slips into a higher note when she sings „crying constantly“…"

**twat_brained**: "This is kinda just a "Bills, Bills, Bills" recycle, but… it *kinda* works. Also, I dig the name drop. But yeah, I'd expect this to be out on day 2."

**VeganSquash**: "En Vogue asking the important questions and getting the receipts via dictionary."

**patronsaintofaspies**: "this gay and ace erasure smh"

**joshually**: "They’re asking the right questions, y’all. This early 90’s house beat is CLASSIC. There’s the sax, the rollicking piano keys, diva vocals… I feel like I’m living through the Clinton administration just listening to this!"

**nerfherder01**: "– the part where they read the dictionary definition of love is super annoying:{"

**TragicKingdom1**: "A little dancier than the rest of the album."

**mokitsu**: "i thought it was that "baby don't hurt me" song so i'm disappointed"

**MrSwearword**: "disappointing closer to a rather good album"

**jess_22**: "my ears hurt"

**Zamomattel**: "Ended Haddaway"

**4Roux**: "The constant „What is it?“ is so goofy, I love it. It's a song for happy-drunk dancing."

**twat_brained**: "Okay, now we got some disco stuff going on! Sounds pretty good. And the sound works for En Vogue, too. This is easily within my top 5 on the album. It drags on a bit, though, so it loses out from me in that regard."
