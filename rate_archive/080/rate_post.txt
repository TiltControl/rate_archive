21st Century Hip Hop #1s Rate!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/dciakq/21st_century_hip_hop_1s_rate/

Finally, the moment this subreddit has been waiting for: a chance to rate XXXTENTACION! 

Hello and welcome to the **21st Century Hip Hop #1s** rate. The title is pretty self-explanatory: it comprises of sixty #1s on the Billboard Hot 100 from 2000-onwards that fall under the hip hop genre. How did we decide on the sixty, you may ask? Well, it's such a broad term that my cohost (/u/MashLuke) and I considered the following factors:

* The song's adherence to hip hop as genre
* The artist's adherence to hip hop as culture (i.e. how much does /r/hiphopheads care about them)
* General overall iconicness (have they stood the test of time or are they forgotten?)
* Inclusion in previous rates (priority given to songs not previously rated & songs not rated within the past year or so)

Keeping those in mind, this is the list we ended up with (brackets denote any previous rates the songs have been in):

# The Rules

* Listen to every song listed (excluding the bonus rate, which is optional) and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). You can use up to one decimal place, although I recommend only using integers and multiples of 0.5, because you're not special for giving a song a 7.3.
* You may give one song a zero (0) and one song an eleven (11). These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. You are NOT required to leave a comment for these songs.
* You must use the prepared link to send in your scores.
* Feel free to PM me or my cohost (/u/MashLuke) on Reddit or Discord if you'd like to change any of your scores.
* I reserve the right to reject any ballots that I suspect of sabotage, and to expose your scores in a variety of humiliating ways. 
* There is a secret bonus rate that can only be accessed ahead of time by sending in scores to this rate! It will be available to everyone during Day 1 of the reveal.
* You can also add comments to any song! The following format is the only acceptable format for song comments:

> Dilemma: 11 picking this as my 11 wasn't a DILEMMA at all hahaha!!!

Any of the following formats are INCORRECT and must be CORRECTED or your ballot will be REJECTED:

> Fancy: 1 - I want those twinks Obliterated

> Grillz: I work at Lowe's and lost half my pinky toe while moving around outdoor grills, so I have to give this a 1.

> Lollipop: I have PTSD from swallowing a Tootsie Pop whole as a child 1

> Lean Back: (1) I'm pressed that Remy Ma has a #1 and Nicki doesn't

> Humble: 1: I can't relate to this song because I can't help but be annoyingly prideful of my 1000 twitter followers on a faceless stan account
