I can’t imagine what falling in love with someone who’s married AND has a child must be like, especially when that person loves you back. I don’t particularly like when a song talks about cheating but this one feels different. First of all, I love the samples in here and the little bells that play the main melody near the end, it makes it pretty intimate and sweet. Second thing, Nelly’s decision to stop their forbidden relationship makes this song better than all the tracks that make cheating look like an erotic game @ Ariana Grande

---

**1998tweety** (10): A mega tune.

**agentofscranton** (10): jasmine and aladdin wish they had as iconic a duet

**bespectacIed** (10): Iconic in all levels !!! Beyoncé's reality check, when Kelly scored a worldwide SMASH before her. I love everything about this: the legendary typical hood love song and video, Nelly's useless band aid, Kelly's red highlights, Patti Labelle's cameo, the bougee Nokia 9210, and of course THE FUCKING EXCEL SPREADSHEET TEXT MESSAGE. Gonna say it again, iconic.

**fishingfor8** (10): NO MATTER WHAT I DOOOOO ALL I THINK ABOUT IS YOUUUUUU

**gannade** (10): no one more iconic than ms kelly rowland

**letsallpoo** (10): ended fadyonce

**radiofan15** (10): Beyoncé's maid is serving Excel realness in this one.

**rsmitty99** (10): Microsoft should create an excel plugin that will allow you to text from a spreadsheet.

**skargardin** (10): Man these early 00's bangers are really coming thru

**TCHALLA1966** (10): Nelly x Kelly I was obsessed!! Queen of texting on Microsoft Excel.

**effervescentemu** (9.5): From queen Kelly master of technology texting on an excel spreadsheet to Nelly absolutely standing by his cheek bandaid no matter the cost - iconic.

**slur in username** (9.2): Still laugh at the video when Kelly Rowland gets mad that she received no reply after texting on Microsoft Excel

**ImADudeDuh** (9): iconic chorus but that's about it but fuck, is it an iconic chorus

**rhyneston3** (9): Kelly really ExCels in this video

**rickikardashian** (9): tbt to kelly trying to text using excel

**runaway3212** (9): Shameless, yet never overstaying its welcome

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It’s good just a tad too long

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): excelent.

**twat\_brained** (8.2): there's only one thing i have to say about this

**steelstepladder** (8): You guys know there is a sequel to this song? It sucks but it exists

**waluigiest** (8): I wish the best for Kelly Rowland <3

**camerinian** (7.5): For as much as this song needs to be performed as a duet, it's quite embarrassing how much better Kelly Rowland's performance is than Nelly's.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): Really makes one wonder what the pop landscape of the rest of the 2000s would’ve been like had Kelly Rowland maintained the momentum she got from Dilemma (it would’ve been awesome).

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): iconic video moment but other than that I don't love this song

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Oh my god I've heard this song so many times but I had no idea what it was called until just now

**anothertown** (7): invented microsoft excel

**MrSwearword** (7): it's fine but not measuring up to the primo shit here

**rotating3Dtext** (7): why so long

**sbb618** (7): Good on the surface, but kinda forgettable. Also it's way longer than it should be?

**vayyiqra** (7): Very smooth but the verses aren't working for me

**silentev** (6.5): I like hearing Nelly kind of sing with his rapping, but this song gets repetitive.

**frogaranaman** (6): the dilemma of this rate is if popheads is going to put aside their racism for once or if they will make the top song by a white woman featuring a white woman

**915BEAST** (5): i’d rather forget this one

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): Is it bad that I legitimately thought that Beyonce was the one singing the hook until this rate informed me otherwise. Also this is one of many songs in this rate where the feature is more memorable than the main artist.

**mms82** (3.5): boring

**CreepyMannequin** (3): I literally cannot focus on the song with that annoying sound effect in my background

probably the most divisive person in the kitchen but i love her unfiltered personality

**1998tweety** (10): queen

**frogaranaman** (10): I would die for every single one of the members of the Bon Appétit staff

**hikkaru** (10): queen

**ImAChefDuh** (10): Almost as good as /u/poppinnmolly! She gives very "gets prom queen beacause everyone actually likes her and not cause she's super popular" energy.

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): she seems like she buys and makes the shopping list and shes not sure if she wants to be on camera or not but otherwise shes nice. she also looks like she may not season her food

**agentofscranton** (6): kinda boring honestly but she's fine

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): Sweet, nice and crowd-pleasing but ultimately basic, like the endless permutations of potato side dishes and pasta that she does. Speaking as a professional chef of over thirteen years, she also needs to improve on her knife skills. I’ve seen a few close calls in which her fingertips would’ve been gonzo.

I think this song is so pure. Comparing someone’s love to a sunflower, for being both beautiful and destructive, is simply delightful. According to Billboard, this is the 11th best-selling song of the decade in America and Post Malone called it a “positive and uplifting song that you can’t be sad listening to.” Indeed, I can't imagine being sad if this is playing. Considering Spider-Verse is about a teen trying to deal with both regular and uncommon teenage problems, a track that encapsulates someone’s first experience with real love, was the best choice for the soundtrack. Both undeniably impacted each other’s popularity.

---

**agentofscranton** (11): maybe one of my favourite songs of the 2010s, there was a period in the spring of this year where all I’d listen to on my walks to and from my uni lectures was this

**frogaranaman** (10): main pop girls 😍

**gannade** (10): this isnt really hip hop but it IS a bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The song certifiably clears acne and your mind

**ImADudeDuh** (10): CUTE! also stream Spider-Verse for clear skin

**poppinmmolly** (10): good song!

**Roxieloxie** (10): postest malonest heard me talking talking shit about him and said "bet" If you know me you know Into the Spiderverse is my absolute favorite movie ever and i would die for miles morales and i really like swae lee's part on this song. which is enough to cancel out my hate for posty. Also when are we rating the Spiderverse soundtrack cause its straight fire

**rsmitty99** (10): Rivals the movie it's from for being one of the best pieces of media from 2018. Catchy as fuck

**sbb618** (10): I did an end-of-year ranking last December, and Sunflower wound up about a third of the way up the list. Nine months later, I haven't stopped listening to it. It's just so infectiously joyous, which fits in perfectly with how it's used in the film.

**silentev** (10): As much crap as I gave Post Malone in my other reviews, this song is so GD catchy and it isn’t just Swae Lee that enhances it, I even like PM’s verse and voice here like its less produced as it usually is.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Just an incredibly ubeat, energetic song. It's kinda short but I could listen to it on repeat for hours.

**waluigiest** (10): a timeless song for a fantastic movie. The first time I saw the movie I didn’t know this song was new, given how seamless and thematic it was. I realize that doesn’t make sense but I felt nostalgia the first time I heard it.

**fishingfor8** (9.5): this isn't rap but it's still a bop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): I'm predicting this song to win Song of the Year at the Grammys.

**twat\_brained** (9.1): this one's rather sweet and i love that it's associated with the greatest animated feature of the 2010s.

**915BEAST** (9): swae lee proving why he is the better half of Rae Sremmurd

**bespectacIed** (9): I'm a hater for culture vulture, main pop boy, hot dog water king Post Malone, but he and Swae made so many points in this song. So damn catchy and wholesome, who could not bop to this

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): this is such a breezy, light fun little tune. Its barely rap but I love hearing it. Swae Lee is everything

**radiofan15** (8.6): if this song is hip-hop then Ariana Grande is truly the most successful black artist right now...

**rickikardashian** (8.5): Listening to this song just gave me an excuse to rewatch Into the Spiderverse again

**runaway3212** (8.5): The song that is both Post Malone's and Swae Lee's best work

**1998tweety** (8): This took a while to grow on me. I still don't get why people gag over it as if it's one of the best songs ever made, but I do like it a lot more now than I initially did.

**steelstepladder** (8): This is a Swae Lee song, NOT a Post Malone Song

**camerinian** (7.5): I normally have no need for airy empty vibe music like this but the fact that I can still put this on and actually enjoy it after all this time and so much play seemingly every time the hip hop station is on during my Uber ride probably counts for something

**hikkaru** (7.5): I'm not one to get caught up on one small lyric but "she wanna ride me like a cruise" takes me RIGHT out of this wholesome, cute song for an animated children's movie

**CarlieScion** (7): this isnt even rap imo

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): An easy-going, summery valentine that showcases Swae Lee’s innate gift for hooks.

**rhyneston3** (7): It’s not really hip hop so minus a few for that

**slimboyfriend** (7): I REALLY wanted to hate this song because it's post malone, but it's too nice

**vayyiqra** (7): Shoutout to that one user on the Popheads server who loves this song. They are a legend.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6): Am I the only one who doesn’t understand what’s so good about this song? Everyone on this sub hypes this song up like its the best hiphop song in years even though a) it’s barely a hiphop song to begin with and b) it sounds like a normal trap-influenced pop song to me. Do I have to watch Into the Spiderverse to understand this song? Idk, it sounds basic to me.

**ditacarlita** (5): on a list with in da club this is just yikes

**slur in username** (5): Post Malone is a lot better since he’s begun doing his pop schtick but I’m just not feeling it with this song

**anothertown** (4): i guess i "get" this.. post sounds good

**MrSwearword** (1): UGH NO

I’ll give my reasonings for giving this an 11. I just can’t think of a song that has been more impactful than this one. The way a spontaneous silly track became the biggest song in America ever, with a beat bought for a few dollars, pushed by a clever use of social media and commercial techniques, is just insane. Everything around it has been crazy. From Billy Ray Cyrus jumping on it, to the song winning a country music award despite Billboard not considering it country music. Not to mention Lil Nas’ coming out. I can’t get over the fact I witnessed a record held by Mariah Carey for years be broken by a teenager, who happened to have a great idea at the right time, and that everybody loved. And man, this song is fun as hell. The real epitome of a hit.

**tk note:** My 11 as well! I find the discourse surrounding it to be super fascinating, but above all else it just never gets old for me. Yes, it's a silly meme song, but it's not lacking anything because of that.

---

**Roxieloxie** (11): I was gonna give this to lizzo but Mr.X needs it more. Listen, i will defend this song until i die. I will forever support the story of little nas x & YoungKio become succesful off of this song. I remember the first time i heard at work and i was just like "is this a country trap song???? i support it" Seeing him thrive and work his ass off for this song is my favorite black excellence story ever. 2019 is truly the year we reclaimed country music. like i said earlier, black kids literally define the culture and this is a great example of that

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (11): Yes I’m giving my 11 to Old Town Road. No I’m going to say sorry or apologize in any way. Everything about this song is amazing : The Nine Inch Nails sample. The instantly memorable and catchy refrain. The lyrics parodying every single country music cliche out there. The fact that the fucking Achy Breaky Heart man had one of the best features in recent years. The way Lil Nas X and Billy harmonize at the end. The fact that the song not only hit number 1 but became the LONGEST RUNNING NUMBER ONE SONG OF ALL TIME and becoming a huge fuck you to billboard for taking it off their charts in the first place. Everything about this song is iconic and I’m really hoping someone makes a film about Lil Nas X and this song someday because this song really is legendary.

**915BEAST** (10): just waiting for Rodeo to be released as a single so he finally can’t be considered a 1-hit wonder

**bespectacIed** (10): Yeah I have a soft spot (or a hard spot, wink wink ew gross) for Lil Nas. He hella cute, gay, wholesome, and a funny troll before and after being popular, so it's so hard to not root for him. As for Old Town Road, it's 1073281 thinkpieces worth of awesome and I am glad for its success. He and Billy made a classic imo, I can't imagine it not being played years from now due to its novelty.

**camerinian** (10): I'm sure in 5 years this is gonna look like a really stupid novelty fluke hit like Gangnam Style or the Harlem Shake, but I honestly can't help but kind of be in awe at everything about this song, and it's strange, one of a kind mix of incredible songcraft, genius marketing and also unbelievable luck that got it where it is

**frogaranaman** (10): hoes mad (x21)

**gannade** (10): billy ray cyrus is a better rapper than lil nas

**ignitethephoenix** (10): we love an iconic record breaking song by a gay icon who is actually gay

**ImADudeDuh** (10): ended Taylor

**itsabop (hals)** (10): Fuck Billboard!

**mms82** (10): this song probably will be my 11 if this rate happens in 10 years ,but I don't know how well this song will hold up. Has over 500 plays since it came out according to Last.Fm by me and has been my favorite song since early March. Honestly pulls some of the best trends of country and rap and packages them both in a fantastic pop package. One of the best songs of all time

**radiofan15** (10): I'm a Lamb but even Mariah knows that Lil Nas X made gaystory that 17th week!

**rickikardashian** (10): The entire history of this song is so unreal I can't believe it isn't a fever dream. Country-rap mix made by a young broke rapper, that blew up because of an app where kids and teens do short videos lipsyncing and small comedy skits. Gets taken off the country charts because of it not being country enough, giving it even more exposure making it a #1 hit. A remix is done with Billy Ray Cyrus so it's acceptable for the country charts, and said remix makes the song such a huge hit it becomes the longest #1 by a long shot, gets certified diamond in less than a year and blocked some of the biggest artists from this decade from the top spot. While all this happened, another 3 remixed were released, that featured Young Thug, the yodeling kid and one of the guys from BTS. I don't know who fucked up our simulation but it's giving us the best content we've had in a while

**runaway3212** (10): Stream Panini

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The original version of Old Town Road was a fun bop as it is, but Billy Ray Cyrus came in on the remix and decided to just cement this song in history. This has no right to be as good as it is, but it works, and is now somehow one of the most iconic things of the year 2019.

**steelstepladder** (10): A true triumph of human perseverance. Song of the decade

**twat\_brained** (10): Are we really gonna pretend like this song isn't the definitive horse's kick in the teeth the Hot 100 needed? X may be one of the 2010s' more absurd novelty acts, but he's one I'll welcome with open arms, especially when he's giving Billy Ray Cyrus a career revival.

**rsmitty99** (9.5): I don't think this song has done much for hip hop. But it did a ton for probably everything else.

**anothertown** (9): a diamond certified song which is difficult to get, not everyone has that,

**sbb618** (9): If it was the two-minute original, which did hit #1 on its own for a week, I'd drop this down a point or two because that's a pretty boring two minutes when you go back to it. But Billy Ray Cyrus' show-stealing verse elevates this to a whole other level, a genre-bending smash that you just can't stop thinking about.

**waluigiest** (9): Nothing about this song’s arc makes sense, but I love and support it

**fishingfor8** (8): hypocritical of me to only give this an 8 but I do what I gotta do. C7osure deserved better

**skargardin** (8): Great song that Billie Ray honestly smoked all over

**agentofscranton** (7.5): it's fine

**slur in username** (7.4): The Billy Ray Cyrus remix is the only good version of the song.

TragicKingdom1: **poppinmmolly** (7): points docked for meme but it is still pretty good

**rhyneston3** (7): I love country hip hop legend Trent Reznor

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): I'm gonna be honest: at no point did I truly care for this song but I'm glad it broke the record because memes.

**ditacarlita** (6): i'm very confused how this became the longest number one, its not even that good

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): But this score is with the caveat that it might be tainted due to decency bias or overplay. I just think it’s too soon to give a balanced rating of a song that was so phenomenally huge in pop culture. My score would probably change (for the better) in a couple years from now, long after the song has left the charts and radio airplay.

**napsandnetflix** (5): some days it's a 1 and some days it's a 10

**silentev** (5): I avoided this song like the plague, but I have to give Lil Nas X where credit where its due for capturing the world’s attention where we are the most susceptible: memes. This is a fun meme-y song, but it isn’t much more than that and his other songs have a lot more substance.

**1998tweety** (4): I hate to look like a clown but I gotta be honest here...this grew on me a lot. Earlier this year I made it clear in a long jukebox review what I did not like about this song (basically it doesn't have much substance to it and feels like a wasted opportunity, at what could've been an amazing genre crossover), but since then the song has grown on me not only cause it actually is kind of catchy, but also cause not everything has to be that serious. I still don't think it's great, but it's way better than my unnecessary and over-sensationalized review made it out to be. LNX is also a wholesome gay king so I give him points for that.

**awhile2** (4): look i like this song but i like so many songs on this list so much that im rating on a skewed scale to allow more variance in the 7+ range. this would normally be like a 7

**vayyiqra** (4): This was a great meme six months ago or whenever but can it die now because despite how strong the hook is the novelty has really worn off since then.

**MrSwearword** (0): it's easily one of the worst songs of the past 40 years. Stan Twitter nonsense at its most nonsensical whether it's a country song, a rap song, or just dumb meme shit that should have flopped from here to hell

Chamillionaire didn’t have any other hits besides this song but the popularity this has to this day makes up for his short career, not to mention he won a Grammy Award for it. It’s interesting how a song about police brutality and racial profiling in the US became a meme and how many people now ignore its actual meaning, but it’s also thanks to the internet if this song is well-known. Plus the beat is fucked, and their flows here are excellent.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Classic. Periodt.

**bespectacIed** (10): I'll always give this classic a 10 no matter how many times we rate it, just for its contribution to society

**camerinian** (10): 1312

**letsallpoo** (10): this is a strange weird al cover

**MrSwearword** (10): fantastic music, I've gushed about it before in the OHW rate

**radiofan15** (10): How many of the comments would be about White & Nerdy? P.S. Atlantic Records YOU SUCK!

**rickikardashian** (10): So, I'm not shocked at a rapper doing a song with a message that reduced to the very core is "fuck these dumb cops that pull me over", I am in fact shocked, that a song with that message went to #1. The beat and hook were so good they made white American not notice they were turning up to a song with a whole verse about racial profiling

**Roxieloxie** (10): a bop that also says fuck cops, i have to stan

**slur in username** (10): Both rappers have amazing flow and that beat is so good.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I'm sorry but this still really goes.

**sbb618** (9.5): Downgraded that half point because, after a while, I had forgotten that the verses aren't actually that good. It's a testament to the rest of the song of that it scores this highly.

**hikkaru** (9): iconic bop it's just a tad too long

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Bop

**poppinmmolly** (9): they see me ROLLIN

**rhyneston3** (9): I would let Chamillionaire t-bone me

**itsabop (hals)** (8.5): White & nerdy

**DrunkHurricane** (8): look at me I'm white and nerdy

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): #ACAB

**rsmitty99** (8): Good song. I feel bad I enjoy Weird Al's White and Nerdy more.

**runaway3212** (8): This chorus is iconic and for good reasons

**steelstepladder** (8): It gave us the best Weird Al parody so it deserves at least an eight

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (8): Does anyone else remember that Luigi death stare video that had this song in it. Because I thought that was the funniest shit when I was 13 years old.

**waluigiest** (8): ive said it before but I can’t believe this song is about police brutality and it got overshadowed by the chorus getting memed

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): still only associate this song with white and nerdy

**rotating3Dtext** (7.5): why so long tho

**skargardin** (7): highkey has been beaten to death by memes and the chorus is kinda annoying but overall a bop

**vayyiqra** (7): Little did we know this song was really a woke protest song about racial profiling and police brutality in America today

**twat\_brained** (6.2): You can complain about the cops catching you riding dirty but if that outro is anything to go by, they were right to do so.

**1nf1n1te** (6): the 1,000s of remixes made this great but the original is very ok

**915BEAST** (6): weird al was better

**silentev** (4): Beyond being a one-hit-wonder and spawning perhaps the best Weird-Al cover ever, this is actually a really basic song with just a catchy chorus and beat.

Big Boi is right, I do like me some 808s. This song is a playful ode to girls, it has some very entertaining lines and the mood is always light-hearted. It’s an irresistible fun track that alternates bass elements with soulful horn sections. I don’t know what else I can say about this one other than it’s good. Maybe let’s praise Outkast for being advocates of body positivity in their music since 2003.

**tk note:** the bass here is infectious and Big Boi has a ton of charisma, to the point where the verses are arguably more memorable than the also great chorus

---

**camerinian** (10): Oh god the groove in this thing is so fucking hot

**frogaranaman** (10): just a reminder that a #1 song has the word “manwhore” in it

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Utterly irresistible.

**mms82** (10): This song just works. The rap parts flow so well (can you feel that B-A-S-S bass), the beat is amazing, and the chorus is so smooth and catchy. Easily my favorite Outkast song and might be my favorite song of the early aughts and was a hard contender for my 11.

**radiofan15** (10): The Love Below outsold Speakerboxxx but this is great too!

**Roxieloxie** (10): The chorus BANGS

**runaway3212** (10): Fantasticly made, pure genius

**sbb618** (10): In some way, it feels fitting that Outkast got one #1 together, and one each separately.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): I only remember it for that catchy af horns in the chorus, but I was straight up laughing at the bars in this song as I was relistening

**rickikardashian** (9.2): I like how there's a verse just praising big women. woke king acknowledging that good pussy is good pussy, no matter the size of the carrier

**hagagaag** (9): No Andre 3000.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): I feel like the chorus was used a ton in the 2000’s but I don’t remember the verses at all.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (9): Remember when Big Boi came out in the SuperBowl Halftime show and performed this and it was the only good part of that performance.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Very close to being a hat trick of 10s for Outkast, but just like the Holy Ghost in the holy trinity, this doesn't feel as important.

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like the production on this, a mellow bop

**ditacarlita** (8): sexual

**fishingfor8** (8): 808s and bass

**ImADudeDuh** (8): its no Hey Ya, but it's still a bop.

**rhyneston3** (8): My least favourite of the three OutKast songs… Still gets an 8 though

**steelstepladder** (8): Pretty great but I wish it had some thicker production during the verses

**vayyiqra** (8): Wow it's been a while since I've heard this one. I still feel that I borrowed that copy of Speakerboxxx / The Love Below

**waluigiest** (8): this song introduced me to sexuality as a child

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I need to give OutKast a fairer shot, they seem to have a clear vision with their hip-hop and they certainly know what they're about. They were superstars for a reason so I should certainly find out for myself.

**silentev** (7): The last half gets a bit repetitive as it slowly fades out.

**CarlieScion** (4): this is very boring

**CreepyMannequin** (4): Verses bop but the chorus is atrocious

**MrSwearword** (1): this is so fucking overrated and gassed up, it's ridiculous. This prevented Kelis from even hitting the Top Two on the Hot 100, so this shit can die

Once again, a song produced by the Neptunes! This minimal structure of the instrumental was so ahead of its time. Its production consists of tongue clicks, keyboards, a spray can sound, a drum machine beat and white noise. The vocal portions with the long “snoop” have been part of different memes and kept this song’s popularity alive but this was an impressive track nonetheless. And the chorus is incredibly catchy and instantly recognizable.

---

**anothertown** (11): absolute peak neptunes

**frogaranaman** (10): my life is ruined because every time I hear this opening I just think of that fuckengsldfj vine where the like twelve year old is dressed in a super zipped up hoodie and is just turning around in locations around his house doing the whitest whip possible

**itsabop (hals)** (10): Snoooooooooooooop

**mms82** (10): one of the best productions and beats of all time

**MrSwearword** (10): So wonderful all these years later

**radiofan15** (10): This ten is dedicated to those salty Arianators who hate on King Pharrell and his masterful and experimental production

**rsmitty99** (10): Memes live on to this day. That's longevity

**sbb618** (10): mastapeece

**skargardin** (10): i mean, a straight up ANTHEM

**vayyiqra** (10): I have no idea what this song is about and I suspect it doesn't matter. It's just a brilliant use of minimalism (including the video) in a time period where production was often about being as loud and overwhelming as possible. On top of that, it's so memeable which is a quality I always appreciate in a song.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): The Neptunes really soundtracked our early lives without us knowing. Who knew excessive tongue popping makes for a well-produced song???

**camerinian** (9): Pharell is a fucking genius and Snoop is an untouchable God

**ImADudeDuh** (9): lowkey not as good as I remember

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): 2000s-era Pharrell was unstoppable; those tongue pops???

**Roxieloxie** (9): the impact

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): The legend jumped out.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Kind of one note but it's good so I don't mind.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): i can't think of any other song that makes use of that click cluck tongue noise.. iconic

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): SNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOP

**slur in username** (8.2): Pharrell was always more of a producer but it’s still a weird transition from this guy that appeared in hip hop videos to the giant hat-wearing person that sang Happy.

**915BEAST** (8): pharell always gets a good mark from me

**rhyneston3** (8): Great song but I can’t hear it without thinking about how Pharrell should have kept this song for Despicable Me instead of writing Happy

**runaway3212** (8): Very good

**silentev** (8): Give it up to Snoop and Pharrell for giving us some new fun sounds to work with and for a song that when listened to on the radio had the most edits for explicit language/references in recent years.

**williamdowley123** (8): hereditary girl be like

**rickikardashian** (7.5): This is a fun song but like, after 3 minutes it drags and doesn't bring anything exciting, so you pass the last minute and a half waiting for the song to end

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (7.5): snoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵒᵖ

**twat\_brained** (7.2): https://vine.co/v/izuI0TOWZJA

**steelstepladder** (7): snooooooooooooooooooooooop

**TCHALLA1966** (7): only because of that robotic sound during the chorus, takes me out the song

**waluigiest** (7): someone heard this, felt shamefully tingly, and invented ASMR

**fishingfor8** (5): Dropping my take like it's hot. (Plz kill me)

If you haven’t seen the Vox video about Sicko Mode, I kindly suggest watching it. This song is not a typical trap song. Its instrumental changes 3 times, it has 5 different samples, 2 intros and 2 bridges. It’s not until minute 3:20 that we hear the song’s chorus, and before it, the catchiest parts of the song are given by the bridge, which features vocals by Swae Lee, that works as the song’s chorus in the first half of the song. We see Drake and Travis Scott delivering ballsy lines about their lifestyle with a lot of attitude over this sinister beat and man, it’s a banger. From the moment you hear the lead synth at the beginning, you can feel it’s about to go down.

**tk note:** the song that made me a Travis Scott fan. Honestly what makes me appreciate this the most is that it makes basically every other song feel safe in comparison, especially when you consider how massive of a hit this was even on pop radio. 

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ok this is actually quite good I can not deny that.

**camerinian** (10): This is gonna be the song whatever the millennial equivalent of boomers are gonna be spamming in the comment sections of the future to say music was so much better in their day, and as awful as they'll be, it's not like they're gonna be wrong.

**frogaranaman** (10): yes I go to a party school, yes I’m white when this song comes on

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of my favourite songs as of recent memory. It’s innovative and catchy. I love the beat switches, Drake’s part is fun and Travis Scott’s aesthetic still shines through.

**radiofan15** (10): Ignorant POOPHEAD be like "is this 21st century's Bohemian Rhapsody?"

**rhyneston3** (10): So strange how it’s 3 entirely separate songs stitched together and it still works so well

**rickikardashian** (10): Huge shout-out to white teenage boys that made this song s hit, we appreciate you (unless you're one of those that refuses not to say the n-word)

**sbb618** (10): The AUDACITY to take one of the best beats of the year and drop it after a minute (also referencing Liz Cambage, responsible use of Xanax, and Jamba Juice twice)

**slur in username** (10): Never been a fan of trap music. Don’t like the dreary, monotonous beats, don’t like the pointless lyrics, don’t like the rap style and flow. This song shows its potential, how great trap music can be when done right.

**steelstepladder** (10): A five part prog-trap opera of brilliance

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lHPDP-q3EIY

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I definitely think this is going to be one of those songs that never really go away. One of the best performances from both Travis and Drake. Iconic.

**twat\_brained** (10): you had a papoose but you CHEATED ON YOUR BABY MAMA AND NOW STORMI WON'T GROW UP WITH YOU IN YOUR LIFE MEN AIN'T FUCKING SHIT

**waluigiest** (10): SO WET. Really don’t know how this found so much mainstream appeal but I’m shook

**\_wailordfan** (9): unfortunately just a hair long to make this song perfect.

**bespectacIed** (9): The girls' generation - i got a boy of hip-hop

**ImADudeDuh** (9): kinda iconic tbh

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): It’s kind of amazing that this hit #1, even taking Drake out of the equation. The beat switch-up and outro are so memorable and distinctive.

**runaway3212** (9): A really good song, combined the best of Drake and Travis Scott

**915BEAST** (8): nothing amazing but I like it

**anothertown** (8): i really go up for songs with multiple movements. that's history!

**vayyiqra** (8): Remember Mo Bamba vs. Sicko Mode? Why was that a thing? This song is obviously way better. That bridge that sounds like the theme to a John Carpenter movie is so creepy and good.

**rsmitty99** (7): I avoided listening to this song in full til now. It's fine I guess

**silentev** (7): It is so surprising that this long of a song became a hit in recent years with the rise of streaming, but I guess there’s a lot going on in the song to keep listeners’ attention, but almost too much.

**ditacarlita** (5): im so clearly no american because i cant stand this

**Roxieloxie** (4): listen i heard this song for the first time during the superbowl and i didnt get the appeal im sorry

**MrSwearword** (1): NO

The Neptunes are responsible for the sound that characterised the early 2000’s and this beat is so steamy it makes you sweat just by hearing it. I also like Nelly’s voice because while he’s rapping, it also feels like he’s singing during his verses. It’s a sexy song, possibly the epitome of sexy, and while his raps are dirty, the beat tones them down and let the listener focus more on the funky instrumental. Man if you don’t feel like grinding to this, I don’t know what does.

---

**letsallpoo** (11): WHEN WILL NELLY GET THE RESPECT HE DESERVES!!!!!!!!!!!!

**1998tweety** (10): An absolute classic. Periodt

**\_wailordfan** (10): a HORNY song for a HORNY boy

**CarlieScion** (10): big nostalgia bop. girl i think my butt gettin big ICONIC

**frogaranaman** (10): it’s getting cold in herre so cold so put on all your clothes I am getting so cold I will put my clothes on

**itsabop (hals)** (10): What can I say? Iconic club banger

**MrSwearword** (10): One of the best Neptunes productions ever

**poppinmmolly** (10): iconic!

**rickikardashian** (10): Taylor Swift said this is her favorite song so I guess I'm obligated to show this nothing but love and respect

**rsmitty99** (10): Did anyone think they were cool when they said "It's getting hot in herre. So take off all your gear"? I was very popular in elementary school…

**skargardin** (10): Absolute bop, coming for it's rudemption hopefully

**TCHALLA1966** (10): I remember when this came out and I was in America I would honestly wait for it to come on the radio and would blast it learning all the words, such happy memories.

**bespectacIed** (9.8): Iconique. Song of the summer forever.

**ditacarlita** (9.5): my eleven year old self so was glad this was on the "so fresh" compilation album damn

**mms82** (9.5): classic for a reason

**anothertown** (9): I love that this song doesn't build at all but it never feels like it overstays its welcome. testament to a great party track.

**awhile2** (9): for some reason my dad who dislikes 98% of modern hip-hop fucks with this song heavy and its slightly concerning

**camerinian** (9): How did clubs even exist before this song? How did they know what to do when it was getting hot in there? How did they survive with songs that weren't this level of chemically engineered sexy? I guess we'll never know. All I know is I wanna fuck right now

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Legendary bop

**runaway3212** (9): Great if a bit corny

**waluigiest** (9): I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: this sounds like sexy boss battle music.

**effervescentemu** (8.8): The sweaty ass music video scandalised me as a child but there's no refuting that this here is a B.O.P

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): Another rapper that is due more credit than he has received, Nelly deserves kudos for putting St. Louis on the map, which opened the door for other regional styles of rap to break into the mainstream. With his sing-songy flow and penchant for barnstorming party anthems, tracks like Hot In Herre will remain in the cultural consciousness for as long as there are wedding and Bar/Bat Mitzvah DJs who need go-to songs that gets your aunties’ asses on the floor.

**Roxieloxie** (8.1): me about my dorm

**rhyneston3** (8): Soooo overplayed, still goes off though

**sbb618** (8): Succeeds in spite of the sometimes clunky beat and some cringy touches, mostly because the hook is so iconic.

**silentev** (8): Did Nelly ever succeed in getting us to wear bandages on our faces?

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (8): When Nelly said it’s getting hot in here he was actually referring to global warming and how we will all be dead by 2050 unless we start actively working on making a difference and listen to the scientists that have been warning us for decades now.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Also a classic but in a much lesser way than some other songs in here.

**twat\_brained** (8): I think my butt gettin' big! I'm trying to squat every day or every other day. Imagine if I weighted those squats; it'd be over for you hoes.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): imagine aggresively stanning this

**steelstepladder** (7): A solid banger that never gets any better and never gets any worse

**vayyiqra** (6): I have always felt this song has a great instrumental and awful lyrics, so I don't quite know how to rate it.

**fishingfor8** (5): whenever I would think about giving this a better score I'd go listen to Ride Wit Me and realize that I am living in the wrong timeline and that this does not deserve a #1 and that ride wit me does, Thank you very much.

**radiofan15** (4.5): this Nelly song got worse since the last time I ranked it.

**915BEAST** (4): no, just no

This was my song of the summer last year. I know this sub is not big on reggaeton music but I love J Balvin and Bad Bunny so I was pretty excited when this collaboration was announced, and when it was out, I was blown away. It’s so danceable and the fusion of salsa and trap works so well. It was also a cool way to pay homage to Cardi’s Latin heritage and just by reading the song title you could feel this would have been a smash. I don’t speak Spanish but I know the Spanish lyrics to this song as well, it’s so good.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Oh yes we do stan the a latino smash hit. I'm SO sorry that I called this song a 5 when it came out.

**1998tweety** (10): All 3 of them ate here wow. Cardi of course has the most iconic lines though. She's no Nicki but she does have her own share of iconic songs and lines.

**\_wailordfan** (10): I hate to say it, but this is one of the strongest 11 contenders in this rate. The pop hook and absolute perfect summer vibe of this song makes it another amazing song of the decade contender.

**anothertown** (10): when cardi starts singing i feel joy

**frogaranaman** (10): damn, Cardi bodied her feature on this song 😍

**MrSwearword** (10): Cardi dominates and the others are good too

**radiofan15** (10): Those who don't know Spanish can't appreciate the beauty of 21st Century's Bob Dylan, Bad Bunny, and why his verse is one of the greatest things ever!

**rickikardashian** (10): Truly the song if that summer. it was completely inescapable and I didn't complain ever because it just was that dope. From the moment the album released and I heard this song I just knew it was destined to be a huge hit

**rsmitty99** (10): I remember listening to her album for the first time at the gym. I dropped my dumbbell when that beat dropped. Sat down. And listened in awe.

**sailormunelune** (10): the sample is utilized so well in this song

**sbb618** (10): A strong, strong contender for my 11 in any other rate. This song just feels like a huge party. It's a testament to just how well-produced this song is that most of its audience can't understand half the lyrics, and they still listen to it all the way through.

**camerinian** (9.5): I won't even pretend to care about Bad Bunny or J Balvin, cos Cardi is in her absolute prime and the fucking sample flip is genius like very little production is. This beat seriously cums so hard.

**runaway3212** (9.5): Amazing song

**ignitethephoenix** (9.2): I love the sample use in this song.

**bespectacIed** (9): Cardi may not be a good MC but she's sure as hell entertaining and charismatic. J's verses were hot and Bad Bunny is hot, period

**rhyneston3** (9): 2018 was really Cardi’s year huh

**slimboyfriend** (9): Cardi proving that more people should get ghostwriters

**steelstepladder** (9): Cardi could not be touched in 2018... other than Girls Like You

**waluigiest** (9): This works from every angle! Her flow is good and the lyricism is clever. The beat is fun. I’m less into the features but she knocks this out of the park.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): it's taken me THIS long to realize J Balvin is shouting out Lady Gaga. BRUH

**itsabop (hals)** (8.5): Oh yesssss, I Like It

**silentev** (8.5): I like Cardi B, I like this song, I like to try and list things like she does, I like how this song gives me fake confidence whenever I hear it playing, and I like how it showcases how fun she can be with her music.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): That sample really does make the song, and I’m glad that this track broke Main Pop Girl Bad Bunny into the mainstream public.

**Roxieloxie** (8): this production slaps

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Whole lotta fun.

**915BEAST** (7): better than Bodak Yellow at least

**fishingfor8** (6): it's fine.

**skargardin** (6): Ridiculously forgettable in hindsight but it was fun while it lasted

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6): Would’ve been better without Bad Bunny

**slur in username** (5.2): Cardi B is fine but my god is Bad Bunny extremely annoying

**mms82** (4): too much going on to be great

**vayyiqra** (2): I do not like this and I do not like Latin pop and I do not like Cardi B and this song is making me feel very stressed and I want her and her toneless raspy voice to go away or at least please someone give her a throat lozenge before her voice irritates me so much I have a Cardi-ac event ba-dum tish

According to Wikipedia this was the most downloaded song of the 2000s. The chorus where T-Pain describes what these shawties were wearing at the club is everything. It’s like these girls got so impressively low, he feels the need to tell what he saw to other people because it was unbelievable. Like, they were *that* good. And Flo Rida just can’t stop rapping about it because those “birthday cakes stole the show”. No wonder this song was part of the Step Up 2 soundtrack because this has THE club-oriented beat.

**tk note:** middle school dance CLASSIC but kinda cringe for that same reason! we do stan how this song's average went up almost 2 full points from the last time we rated it (Year-End #1s, 6.55 average) though

---

**1998tweety** (10): Tbh this should win the rate, such an iconic and GOOD song.

**anothertown** (10): this lyricism is what creative writing teachers are trying to convey when they talk about imagery. the scene setting. the iconic language that stays with you for a lifetime.

**eigensheep** (10): I really should not like this song so much, but I do. Sue me.

**frogaranaman** (10): shawty got dem apple bottom jeans boots with the jeans the whole jeans was looking at jeans she hit the jeans next thing you jeans shawty got jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans jeans

**hikkaru** (10): very dated in the most charming of ways

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Flo Rida has more number 1 hits than your fave, stay pressed

**MrSwearword** (10): nice little nostalgia bomb

**poppinmmolly** (10): iconic song that just SOUNDS like 10th grade for me

**radiofan15** (10): The power that that has, the intelligence that that has, the clearance that that has, the access that that has, the influence that that has, the profile that that has, the international implications that that has...

**rickikardashian** (10): I don't even have a joke to make about this song, it's just a straight up banger. The majority of the music industry wishes they had a song as iconic as this

**rotating3Dtext** (10): the legend, the meme

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCmvXCgZr74

**TCHALLA1966** (10): Flo rida and t-pain did that! To this day I see this song quotes truly a impact.

**waluigiest** (10): name a more important chorus

**zaminizjammin** (10): The last 5 tracks are perfection, what a beautiful time for the charts

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): low low low low low low low low low loooowoowowowowow

**915BEAST** (9): solid jam that comes on at every party

**bespectacIed** (9): Let's pay our respects to apple bottom jeans, baggy sweatpants, and one of the biggest singles of all time.

**CarlieScion** (9): club classic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): “shawty got low, low, low, low, low, low, low” everyone slowly drops to the floor without trying to kill their knees

**rhyneston3** (9): Man Flo Rida was unstoppable for that late 2000’s era. Such a banger, extra points for everyone trying to get low to this while drunk and inevitably falling into each other

**twat\_brained** (9): The fact that this song has probably been played at least a collective billion times, many of which had to have been children's functions, with the lyric "I had to fold her like a pornography poster" will never fail to make me cackle until my lungs get sore. I love Flo Rida for that reason alone.

**camerinian** (8.5): It's a shame this is still a Flo Rida song, cos this is an all-time hook. T-Pain carried all of 2000s hip hop on his back, and he deserves some God damn credit for that

**sbb618** (8.5): Saying this as someone who likes Flo Rida: There's a reason no one remembers the Flo Rida part on this song

**\_wailordfan** (8): Flo Rida? Lemme Rida.

**ditacarlita** (8): this song really stood the test of time

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): A permanent fixture of wedding DJ playlists that’ll get your aunties twerking every single time.

**silentev** (8): Its so hard to rate this song outside of a meme perspective but no matter where I am when I hear this song its hard not to have a fun time and everyone I know starts singing in unison.

**vayyiqra** (8): SHE HIT DA FLO As lyrically stupid as this song is, in my tender youth my painfully white suburban self was not ready for this and I gained a new appreciation for big booty hos from this song which has stayed with me to this day. The instrumental is really memorable and cool and still bops today. Don't even @ me with the word "dated".

**runaway3212** (7.5): A very solid song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Does a song have to be good to be iconic? I don't know.

**slur in username** (6.6): This song was massive. Was the most downloaded single in the 2000s. Everyone at school kept singing the chorus and got extremely tiresome fast.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): okay but can we actually make boots with the fur a fashion trend again in the 2020s??

**rsmitty99** (6): It took me an embarassing amount of years to realize Flo.Rida was just Florida with a different pronunciation. Haha! Oh this song is overplayed trash

**steelstepladder** (6): The definition of a song that has totally earned its place in culture and deserved to be as big as it was, yet I would never listen to on my own

Do I even have to say how iconic this song is? Anything around “8 Mile” made history. Well, I don’t know if it did in this sub, but for the bros of the world, yes it did. In the first few seconds you’re instantly sucked into the main character’s grimy and cruel world. I can’t describe how much I love the piano at the beginning, and when the guitar riff goes on? Shivers. If you didn’t know, athletes like Michael Phelps have said Eminem’s music makes them go harder when they train, and a research confirmed that songs like “Lose Yourself” are the best workout songs. So, mom’s spaghetti is funny yeah, but this song really is a modern classic.

**tk note:** can we appreciate how wild it is that Eminem managed to get a song into the top 10 of a rate on this subreddit?

---

**slur in username** (11): Hard to go past the most famous song of the 2000s. Awesome intro and guitar riff and a great pump up anthem.

**915BEAST** (10): moms spaghetti, I rest my case

**ditacarlita** (10): i love the guitar

**frogaranaman** (10): if you hate this then I hate you, not ONE second in this song is a bad second

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of the greatest hip hop songs of all time

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Oscar winning bop

**letsallpoo** (10): the white man made some points

**radiofan15** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SW-BU6keEUw

**rsmitty99** (10): This is in every one of my work out playlists. I don't think there's a better song out there that will motivate me to run one more kilometer, lift one more rep, push one - I'm just kidding. I don't work out.

**runaway3212** (10): Eminem at his best

**sailormunelune** (10): mom's spaghetti

**sbb618** (10): What more do I have to say?

**silentev** (10): Solidified Eminem’s lyrical prose and talent as a rapper and artist.

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Old Eminem still is still a classic that fits on any workout playlist

**steelstepladder** (10): I know we all collectively shit on Eminem's dad jokes now but come on guys this song is incredible

**twat\_brained** (9.7): great as this song is Eminem is too vile for me to take this seriously Jokes aside, he really snapped here

**rickikardashian** (9.5): one of the most successful rap songs of all times, and it's current legacy is \*\*M🅾️M'S SP🅰️GHETTI**

**bespectacIed** (9): Me, a faqq0t, knows every word of this song. It's a brilliant character song for Em.

**CarlieScion** (9): unironically great

**eigensheep** (9): One of the few Eminem songs I like, probably because it's one of the few Eminem songs that isn't edgelord shit

**itsabop (hals)** (9): Used to hear this song a lot when I was younger. My mom was a huge Eminem stan (lol) and I think this is a big bop even now.

**poppinmmolly** (9): spaghetti comes once in a lifetime

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Eminem's peak. +1 for memeability.

**waluigiest** (9): I am not an Eminem sympathizer. But this song, through a mix of nostalgia blinders and actually compelling lyrics, really works for me.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A misogynistic homophobe, but he occasionally makes a point with a good song.

**camerinian** (8.5): Ooh, Spagett!

**CreepyMannequin** (8.5): I know this has kinda been memed to death and Eminem is a clown but man it is actually a great song

**effervescentemu** (8.5): Eminem is generally a grating mess of a man but this song slaps and will be used in workout playlists even after humanity is wiped out.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.5): insert mom’s spaghetti meme here

**awhile2** (8): you arent a real white boy if you cant rap the whole first verse by memory

**gannade** (8): a classic but i cant give this a 10 in good faith

**rhyneston3** (8): Did M&M’s or Eminem come first

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): An effective, crowd-pleasing anthem about believing in yourself that, between the lines and around the edges, reveals the innate corniness that would soon come to plague Eminem for the rest of his career.

**hikkaru** (7): this song is decent enough (we have to stan mom's spaghetti) but it's kinda tarnished by the people that are like "eminem is the only hip hop i like and lose yourself is the best rap song and today's garbage mumble rappers will never compare to him and also i don't have a racist bone in my body so don't even try it sweaty!" and also eminem himself being gross

**slimboyfriend** (7): All those car commercials really ruined this song for me :/

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (7): mom’s spaghetti

**williamdowley123** (7): you better lose yourself in the spaghetti

**\_wailordfan** (6): a white in this rate? No THANKS

**vayyiqra** (6): I love the intro and it's very catchy but I've never quite gotten the appeal of this song

**anothertown** (4): tfw the song is 5 minutes long and it peaks in the first minute

**MrSwearword** (3): overplayed, overrated, prevented Missy Elliott from ever topping the Hot 100, etc.

As a non-American, I can say that in many people’s minds, New York is a magical place. I’ve heard many friends of mine say that before they die, their only wish is to visit it. Many people still think of the city as the symbol of the American dream and this song perfectly embodies that. Alicia Keys’ chorus was designed to be sung along and Jay Z’s references to places and people of his hometown sort of make you wish you were born there. While it may be a “concrete jungle” for some, for many it’s the “concrete jungle” by definition, in the best way possible.

**tk note:** This was almost cut from the rate because it was just in 2009 Year-End earlier this year, but I had a feeling it could have a redemption arc and I was right! I think it's a tad overrated but it shoots for a high goal and reaches it which should always be commended.

---

**fishingfor8** (11): this song is and forever will be, the reason why I want to move to New York city. Ex who moved there has nothing to do with it.

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic.

**\_wailordfan** (10): ANOTHER 11 contender the variety HURTS

**bespectacIed** (10): amazing, iconic song but let me cackle for the fact that it BLOCKED BAD ROMANCE LMAOOOOOOO. What a moment in gay history

**cremeebrulee** (10): I'm biased because I'm a New Yorker but this song never fails to make me feel so proud of being from here and Brooklyn specifically. Honestly listening to it now makes me a little homesick :/

**frogaranaman** (10): what if we kissed at the concrete jungle wet dream tomato 😳

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Another classic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): CONCRETE JUNGLE WET DREAM TOMATOOOOOOOOOOOO

**radiofan15** (10): ugh, their empire state of MIND it amazes me...

**rickikardashian** (10): since I couldn't hear the original version on Spotify, I decided to listen to the Glee version of it. Good thing they're both 10s so nothing changed:)

**rsmitty99** (10): This song actually makes me wanna live in NYC. Alicia Keys is a goddess

**TCHALLA1966** (10): Everything about this song is great a true anthem

**twat\_brained** (10): Please don't trip a referee, Jay. That's incredibly unprofessional and could get you banned from Barclays Center. Also, that "good girls gone bad" lyric… is that a nod to Umbrella? I hope it is. Keep making the Yankees hat famous and keep collabing with Alicia, you two go well together.

**vayyiqra** (10): Something about this song makes me cringe a bit today but it's really a great song and I really need to listen to Alicia Keys more since I knew about her as a kid but missed the boat.

**waluigiest** (10): concrete jungle wet dream tomato [3]

**slur in username** (9.3): This song felt like an instant classic when released.

**CarlieScion** (9): remember when glee covered this and made artie rap this bc he rapped everything

**Roxieloxie** (9): Bacon pancakes outsold

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (9): Does anyone actually know what Alicia Keys is saying at that one part or does everyone just agree that she’s saying concrete jungle wet dream tomato

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Jay Z put your shit back on streaming

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): I’ll take populist Jay-Z over the NFL deal-signing Jay that brags about owning Basquiats any day.

**rotating3Dtext** (8): CONCRETE JUNGLE ICE CREAM TOMATO

**steelstepladder** (8): Every decade needs one song about how great New York is, and this is a great one.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Good but overrated.

**williamdowley123** (8): makin pancakes makin bacon pancakes get some bacon and i put it in a pancake

**ditacarlita** (7.5): it's good but so overused

**rhyneston3** (7): I think I would like this song more if I was American and understood the New York references

**runaway3212** (7): I like the song, but it's not as great as some people claim it to be.

**silentev** (7): This is clearly a love letter which is really great coming from Jay but for some reason Alicia Keys’ voice sounds off like its over produced, which is a shame because she has a natural talent that doesn’t need that.

**slimboyfriend** (7): This song is about as overrated as NYC. So yeah it's decent

**anothertown** (6): shawn carters only appearance on this rate, and thats just fine.

**MrSwearword** (6): continues to age badly

**jackisboredtoday** (5.6): growing up on the west coast means NY-specific anthems aren’t really my thing (plus this isnt Jay’s best work anyway)

**eigensheep** (5): Loses major points because I grew up in Chicago and can't stand smug New Yorkers

**915BEAST** (4): way overplayed and nothing is particularly good about it

**camerinian** (4): oh god. I do have to give this some credit because Jay’s verses are more than just an NYC circlejerk and actually have some details about the people and culture, and Alicia’s performance is nice, but HOLY FUCK I NEVER WANT TO HEAR THIS SONG AGAIN. This song seriously outstays its welcome, and every time it comes on, I forget that it’s nearly five fucking minutes long and I really cannot find it in me to invest that long in to it when the song basically starts at the same place it finishes, and Jay-Z bars all kind of seem to run together. Never mind the fact, while Alicia is good, that hook really does not hold up to overplay and being sung in packs by drunk white girls.

After beating Drake to death for the past few days, y’all decided he actually made a good song for once. Honestly, I wasn’t the biggest fan of this at first but I gave this a 10 as well because it is great. This track last year felt like a breath of fresh air thanks to the Lauryn Hill sample and the female-empowerment message and it was definitely one of the highlights of “Scorpion”. I also want to give Drake some credit for releasing 2 bounce singles when every other rapper was making trap music because it was a smart move, and he also respectfully paid homage to New Orleans and Big Freedia while helping popularize the genre.

---

**\_wailordfan** (11): Another 11 contender, the pop rap mix here makes it one of the best songs of the decade

**camerinian** (11): It honestly kinda hurts me giving my 11 to Drake, but this is one of the most incredibly joyous and quotable songs to hit #1 in recent memory. That there's a chart topper that starts with Big Freedia doing her thing is mind-blowing in and of itself, but the fact that the entire track is a bounce pastiche with a brilliant sample and Drake actually putting some effort into his lyrics to make a liberating, exhilarating track is such a perfect storm of brilliant elements that I don't know how anything else could top this. Stunning.

**radiofan15** (11): Miss Freida came to mothafuckin' representin' in here tonight in what is arguably Drake's best song ever, or at least deserving of the Top 3 alongside Take Care and Passionfruit... as much as I love Kanye none of his songs in here have made me feel in the same way than

**rickikardashian** (11): Could you believe that the anthem that told women "fuck men, be the bad bitch you want to be" came from Drake, out of anyone. And can you also fucking believe that in a rate with some of the most iconic rap songs of all times, I'm truly out here giving a Drake song my 11. I don't know what this says about me, but I feel like it ain't positive. Fuck it tho, this song goes hard and it brings me up absolutely every time I listen to it.

**runaway3212** (11): Sometimes Drake makes really good song and this is my favourite of his

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (11): Top 3 Drake songs for me. GOAT sample, absolute banger from start to finish, empowering anthem, and one of the very few songs that I can't resist dancing to at the club. Very glad it was a hit.

**1998tweety** (10): we LOVE a feminist king. Lauryn Hill's power, I wanted to say that this song is carried by that sample but Drake's verses are pretty good too.

**915BEAST** (10): the only good song of Scorpion

**agentofscranton** (10): drake will never make a better song in his career and he should stop trying

**CarlieScion** (10): drakes best song dont @ me

**fishingfor8** (10): THATS A REAL ONE IN YOUR REFLECTION WITHOUT A FOLLOW, WITHOUT A MENTION I tell myself as I deactivate Instagram for the 10th time

**frogaranaman** (10): I will assume anyone that does not give this song a good score is a loser that does not party

**hikkaru** (10): this deserves what In My Feelings has... his best hit like ever tbh

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Biggest bop Drake has ever made.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I WANNA KNOW WHO MOTHERFUCKING REPRESENTING IN HERE TONIGHT

**rsmitty99** (10): that Lauryn Hill sample is soooo good. Probably my favorite Drake song. It feels like a Kanye produced single from the mid-2000s. Well done Aubrey

**silentev** (10): Out of all of Drake’s hits from Scorpion this is my favorite and it has everything to do with the beat and mostly positive lyrics encouraging me to tell men to f off.

**skargardin** (10): One of his best for sure

**TCHALLA1966** (10): This song was everything for me last year it’s such a bop damn

**twat\_brained** (10): When I think of late 2010s Drake, this is how I'd like to remember him. I can hardly think of as great a rap song that defines 2018 like this one.

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): Love the sample and how upbeat it is also a little biased because it helped me go through a break up lol

**sbb618** (9.5): Why couldn't this have been the song of the summer? Why?? It's so much more fun than In My Feelings

**bespectacIed** (9): My score is ONLY for that godly Lauryn Hill sample

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): An ebullient, feel-good party jam that proves that Drake can be convincing on a song...so long as said song is not about him, his life, his beefs, etcetera.

**rhyneston3** (9): My fav of the Drake songs in this rate

**steelstepladder** (9): Best Drake song in YEARS

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): Lauryn Hill is the most hip hop part of this song

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (8): Ok yeah this song slaps

**slur in username** (7.1): The samples and beat is kind of a mess but it’s energetic and fun to listen to.

**MrSwearword** (7): I begrudgingly give this above a bad score because he could've fucked up the sample source of "Ex Factor" by Lauryn Hill but he doesn't, so seven generous points there

**vayyiqra** (7): I see we are in the "just okay Drake song" part of the decade.

**ditacarlita** (6): drake has way better

**anothertown** (5): stream ex factor by lauryn hill

**poppinmmolly** (5): why do people like Drake he only has like 4 good sonsg

**waluigiest** (5): I feel like this is phoned in a bit

If Lil Nas X hadn’t been part of this rate, I would have given Abel my 11. TK and I discussed whether this song should have been part of the rate and we thought it was hip-hop inspired enough to make it. If you disagree, whatever, you have already rated it and pushed it to the top 10, so that’s on you. I own this album and when this song came out, I couldn’t stop listening to it. It was the best route he could take after “Beauty Behind the Madness” and murdering himself on his music video was such a badass move. The whole song feels like a sinister soundtrack to the death of his old persona.

**tk note:** honestly don't know why this song in particular was ragged on for being Not Hip Hop (tm) when he raps the verses! There's a blurry line between singing and rapping in general but many other artists (who communities like hiphopheads care about much less) do the same. 

---

**CarlieScion** (11): this sounds so slick, but in a good way

**hikkaru** (11): easy 11 for me, truthfully I'm not entirely sure if it should be in this rate but I will not complain. Abel snapped and Daft Punk did what they had to do with the amazing production

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Who would have thought Daft Punk and The Weeknd would have gone together so well like 5 years ago? Not me. But honestly this is one of those most inventive and interesting lead singles from recent memory. No one was really sure how The Weeknd would move sonically after a very pop sounding album but I think this was the perfect direction for him to move into.

**jackisboredtoday** (11): not really hip hop but I stan The Weeknd and this is still a near-perfect song so it gets my eleven anyway

**vayyiqra** (11): Even though I don't like the album Starboy itself that much (it's fine, just overlong), this is a dark, moody masterpiece, and a real highlight of 2010s pop. It's also the only song in this rate that makes me feel any real emotion. I swear that synth line will haunt me until my dying day.

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh this is so good, Kim Petrat tried ripping this off but even then she flopped. Daft Punk remain winning kings.

**agentofscranton** (10): literally the coolest song in existence

**awhile2** (10): this isnt even rap and somehow it made it when TI got left out

**bespectacIed** (10): how tf is this in the rate, there is literally 0 trace of hiphop or rap in this song??? That being said this is an EXCELLENT song, abel x daft punk was a match made in heaven

**frogaranaman** (10): using this song to recommend people listen to Daft Punk’s hip hop production leaks before they say this “doesn’t sound like them”

**ImADudeDuh** (10): its a bop but no tk, it's barely a hip hop song. Like a G6 was fucking robbed

**MrSwearword** (10): no clue what that or the video is about but I don't care, it's great

**radiofan15** (10): This song is art... there's no other way to describe it.

**runaway3212** (10): A song that perfects the art of slowly building a song.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): Another close contender for my 11. Everything in this song is great but the biggest draw to me is the Weeknd’s voice. He could sing the phonebook and I would still listen to it. I also love the Daft Punk backing vocals adding to the futuristic sound of the track.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): King of the Fall.

**twat\_brained** (10): for the longest time I thought he was singing "switch off my style, like to get me laid, I switch off my cuff, I kill any pain"

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): I remember when this dropped and I was just so excited for this new era of the Weeknd because it sounded so different for his earlier stuff. I liked his later Starboy singles more now but I think this was a great one to start with

**camerinian** (9): "Daft Punk are my favourite hip-hop producers" and other things you'll never hear outside of this wretched hellhole of a sub

**rickikardashian** (9): Hi, I invite you all to sign my petition to make sure The Weeknd and Daft Punk work together again, thanks

**Roxieloxie** (9): okay but what new edition song was he listening to in the car

**sbb618** (9): Look, Daft Punk, I know you like doing this production work for other artists, and it's great. But you haven't released an album in SIX AND A HALF YEARS. Get back to it. Please? Pretty please?

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): How can you not love Daft Punk’s glossy and smooth production?

**silentev** (8.5): I have always loved the sound of The Weeknd’s voice and the beat that’s been provided here by Daft Punk is just so elegant and niche and different sounding that it works perfectly.

**rhyneston3** (8): Probably my least favourite Weeknd single wait actually that prechorus is dope nevermind

**skargardin** (8): Why does it feel like the Starboy-era is way older than it is? I could've sworn this came out at least five years ago?

**steelstepladder** (8): Adored this song when it came out but I haven't really listened to it since

**waluigiest** (8): my friend and I used to think it was “I’m in love with a star boy” and if that were the case this would be a 10

**slur in username** (6.6): Why is this song here. The Weeknd is not a rapper and this is an electro song made by Daft Punk

**915BEAST** (6): not as good as other the weekend songs but listenable

**\_wailordfan** (6): Tbh this song is as worthy of being here as Truth Hurts is

**slimboyfriend** (6): Ha. Ha ha ha ha ha ha.

**anothertown** (3): annoying

**mms82** (1): I never got why the sub loves this song so much. It's boring and sounds like a poorly remixed Khalid song

“Ms. Jackson” was in the top 5 for the whole rate until the last minute. I think what makes this song exceptionally good is that you can feel they mean what they are saying because it’s based on their real-life experience. Mostly, they focus on André 3000’s failed relationship with Erykah Badu, but the song generically addresses what happens when a couple divorces or breaks up. It’s a situation many people can relate to and I particularly like this line André uses while confronting his mother-in-law: “You can plan a pretty picnic, but you can't predict the weather, Ms. Jackson.” Simply beautiful.

**tk note:** Extremely interesting production with the organ. Not something that I can really listen to on repeat but one of the most critically acclaimed hip hop songs of all time for a reason.

---

**silentev** (11): The layering of music and lyrics and other sounds is mystifying and beautiful and perfect and that’s why it gets my eleven.

**steelstepladder** (11): OutKast are the greatest musical duo of all time

**bespectacIed** (10): Is there an artist more balancedly critically acclaimed and commercially successful than Outkast? Ms. Jackson is a rap and pop culture classic

**camerinian** (10): 🎶 I'm sorry Chris Jackson, ooh, my friend from high school. I know you got sung this song a lot. I apologise, it really got old very quickly and also tainted a masterpiece of music. This is a very true story by the way

**frogaranaman** (10): that San Holo remix of this goes dummy hard and I will be forever searching for proper download links of that series of remixes

**hagagaag** (10): Andre 3000.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Panic! is shaking a bit but both are 10's

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): A truly iconic song that just about put Atlanta on the map as the new cultural capital of hip hop in the new Millennium.

**MrSwearword** (10): just for the fact this is about his tryst with Erykah Badu

**radiofan15** (10): Damn this is actually better than the DJ Khaled and SZA song!

**rsmitty99** (10): Man do I miss this hip hop. The song actually has unique rhythms and flow. Not the Same. Exact. Beat. And. Flow.

**sbb618** (10): The holy trinity: A catchy-as-hell hook, the smoothest backing track possible, and some lyrics that cut deeper than you expected (Forever never seems that long until you're grown)

**slur in username** (10): Outkast being good as usual

**TCHALLA1966** (10): but kicking this off with such a iconic bop I must stan. Truly a great song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Classic.

**vayyiqra** (10): I love this song. It's a timeless classic. Outkast were such a talented band. I can barely follow them when they rap this fast, but I love the beat with the synth and the tinny-sounding piano.

**waluigiest** (10): I really love this. The soundscape is lush and there’s an honest romance in there. Panic at the Disco absolutely could never.

**1998tweety** (9): This is pretty good

**fishingfor8** (9): classic

**ignitethephoenix** (9): That hook is a classic.

**rhyneston3** (9): This was about Erykah Badu??

**rickikardashian** (9): the original miss jackson this song is directed to bought all the official merchandise of the song and even got a plaque that said "Ms. Jackson". honestly big mood

**skargardin** (9): Ms. Jackson if you're nasty OW! :janet:

**static\_int\_husp** (9): A good way to start the rate. Outkast has some great, creative flows that still feel unique today.

**runaway3212** (8.5): Love it, unique but never annoying

**915BEAST** (8): solid banger to start of with

**anothertown** (8): invented four eels

**awhile2** (8): ok im sorry outkast are my favorite hip-hop act of all time but this has to be there most overrated song by far. also i cant hear the hook without thinking of that stupid "four eels" tumblr post

**Roxieloxie** (8): a bop

**williamdowley123** (8): i am several fish and not a guy

**twat\_brained** (7.7): why wouldn't André just apologize to Lauryn instead of his mother?

**mms82** (7): Good song, classic lines, but didn't age into something I listen to regularly or enjoy that much 20 years later

**poppinmmolly** (7): im sorry miss jackson oooo i am four eels never meant to make your daughter cry I am several fish and not a guy

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): Brendon Urie is shaking

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): abracadabra

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6): The chorus is catchy and I can absolutely understand why so many people like it but that part of the beat that sounds like something being played in reverse gets on my nerves and ruins my enjoyment of the song overall.

**CarlieScion** (4): i cant wait to quit my job so that i wont have songs ruined for me anymore. it gains some points back bc of the foreva-part

This song was praised by critics for fusing crunk music, a subgenre of hip-hop, with R&B giving origin to what Usher called “crunk&B”. It changed R&B and made it more club-oriented, influencing the sound of future hits like “Goodies” by Ciara and “Run It!” by Chris Brown, which are part of this rate, and other songs like “All Hands on Deck” by Tinashe. This track is instantly recognizable. Usher sounds both panicked and overwhelmed by this girl’s sexiness and Lil Jon’s gritty beat elevates the sexual tension. It’s all happening so fast and all he can say to this girl is a blunt: yeah! That’s all they need. Consent is important, that’s Usher’s lesson to you.

---

**1nf1n1te** (11): it's probably the greatest radio-focused song of the 21st century

**itsabop (hals)** (11): Absolute 🔥 in every way

**1998tweety** (10): Easy 10, Usher is forever an icon. Add LudaKing and the song is even better.

**\_wailordfan** (10): another 11 contender

**camerinian** (10): There is not a single moment here that doesn't bang really fucking hard. Even though all three performers have totally different energies, they all come together so perfectly into the one energy: BIG DICK

**CarlieScion** (10): biggest bop

**frogaranaman** (10): yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah! yeah!

**gannade** (10): yes i am white on the inside

**hikkaru** (10): 10 for the beat alone. iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (10): We fucking stan these 3 motherfucking icons.

**JustinJSrisuk** (10): Hooks on hooks on hooks on hooks - this song is absolute perfection.

**letsallpoo** (10): he's allowed to give me herpes

**radiofan15** (10): You know songs like that... they are STORIES that people can IDENTIFY with... I mean anybody, children will be singing this song at graduations... at weddings... at funerals...

**rhyneston3** (10): Usher can still get it

**rickikardashian** (10): The real life equivalent of what my ears go through when I hear this song must be getting hit by a bus while high on every drug possible. It's straight up painful because there's everything going on, but it works so perfectly it makes no sense. Out of all the loud, messy crunk songs released in the early to mid 2000s, none of them pulled it off as well as Yeah does

**Roxieloxie** (10): The vivid memories from my elementary school dance this just brought me, whew. This song has no reason to still go as hard but oh boy dose it

**runaway3212** (10): The biggest bop to ever bop

**sbb618** (10): This is the price for getting Lil Jon to produce your megahit: You have to let him come in and yell all over the track. A small price to pay.

**skargardin** (10): Absolute classic

**steelstepladder** (10): song of the decade

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): ICONIC bop. I’ll be listening to song on my deathbed and still be jamming to it.

**TCHALLA1966** (10): THEY DID THAT AHHHHHHH

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Iconic!

**twat\_brained** (9.6): Reading the lyrics, this is fantastic on numerous levels! He mentions how the girl he's freaking with was his ex's closest friend which sets the tone for Confessions brilliantly, and it helps that everyone gets lost in the song and just screams "YEAH!". One of the top 10 2000s songs.

**anothertown** (9): glee did an all female a cappella cover of this, and it was decent, and that's why i have trauma.

**bespectacIed** (9): THEE biggest hip-hop song of the 2000s and perhaps of all time still bangs to this day

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Still goes off in the club

**mms82** (9): still a bop

**rsmitty99** (9): Usher's 1989 era

**static\_int\_husp** (9): dumb but well put together and fun

**waluigiest** (9): such an important cultural moment

**slur in username** (8.9): This song was such a big hit that these three artists decided to make another single together just a few months later. Unfortunately they went with a slower R&B jam this time round.

**vayyiqra** (8): I hate that I like this song

**williamdowley123** (7): usher has the power to make your booty clap using only his voice

**silentev** (4): And I’m like no!

**915BEAST** (2): no, this song is utter garbage

**MrSwearword** (1): hated it then, hate it now, it makes me think of the popular kids in high school and that's never a good thing.

Probably Kanye’s signature song and biggest hit. I know so many that have it in their workout playlist and it really gets the best of you. Kanye took Nietzsche’s dictum “what does not kill me makes me stronger” and made his motto and with this song he wants it to be ours too. He sounds like he’s always to the point of losing his breath calling out people and addressing his past. It’s such an energetic song and the shutter shades in the music video? Iconic.

**tk note:** noted hip hop artists daft punk were the true winners of this rate

---

**awhile2** (11): bro if u didnt have the shutter shade glasses when this song came out idk what u were doing

**frogaranaman** (11): got damn this will never fail to go hard as fuck

**skargardin** (11): One of Kanye's best songs point blank periodt, absolute classic and the Daft Punk sample really is immaculate i CAN'T believe how good it is. Truly a snatcher each and every time.

**1998tweety** (10): Kingye strikes again. If this doesn't make top 5 I'll be peeved. Daft Punk ate here too.

**agentofscranton** (10): i use ‘you should be honoured by my lateness, that i should even turn up to this ape shit’ on a fairly regular basis so thanks for that kanye

**bespectacIed** (10): If it wasn't for Hey Ya, this would've been my no brainer 11. Just one of the most successfully done uses of samples in the history of hip-hop. A song that encapsulates what makes Ye a genius producer, hilarious and smart lyricist, brilliant artist. More than a decade later, he said it right in this song: they don't make 'em like this anymore. Not even Ye himself.

**eigensheep** (10): Graduation is the first rap album I really got into. Shoutout to my high school art teacher who let kids bring in music, and to the kid who brought this album in and had to awkwardly skip past the dirty parts.

**hikkaru** (10): this and Starboy to make a Daft Punk top 2 please

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is probably one of the first Kanye songs I knew existed and it always holds a special place in my heart. It’s a classic and although it’s Kanye’s biggest hit, I think it’s still great and using Daft Punk as the sample production is ahead of its time

**MrSwearword** (10): Kanye was invincible around this time and it's so nice to relive this fabulous song

**radiofan15** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yFGpEG8psXg

**rhyneston3** (10): Man Kanye really knows how to use samples to his advantage

**runaway3212** (10): Daft Punk combined with rappers is a golden combination that can't go wrong

**sbb618** (10): Just look at how different this is from anything within like at least three years on either side. Kanye didn't get caught up in the swamp of mid-2000s hip-hop, and we are forever grateful.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Need this ye back.

**twat\_brained** (10): Kanye in the late 2000s was on something ELSE. Wouldn't "black Kate Moss" just be Naomi Campbell though? can't be the only one who thinks this

**waluigiest** (10): a lot of beauty here.

**zaminizjammin** (10): Kanye has had many peaks, but this was definitely one of them

**ImADudeDuh** (9.9): You know why i had to remove .1 points.

**rickikardashian** (9.5): I’ll conveniently forget that Kanye said dyke when rating this song, but not when a conversation on why he’s a problematic comes on

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (9.5): Would be a 10 if Kanye didn’t use the d slur. What is it with rappers and ruining otherwise good songs with homophobic and transphobic slurs.

**915BEAST** (9): more points for the daft punk sample

**camerinian** (9): If this is the closest we're gonna get to rating Daft Punk on this sub, I'll take it. The sample flip into the hook is so fucking brilliant

**itsabop (hals)** (9): Probably my highest rating for a Kanye song

**JustinJSrisuk** (9): 2003 2007 Kanye, where did you go? We miss you.

**poppinmmolly** (9): CANNOT GIVE KANYE MY 11

**rotating3Dtext** (9): the use of the sample is so good

**silentev** (9): Kanye really picked the right Daft Punk song to sample; he's really in his prime here and it makes me miss this version of Kanye so so much.

**steelstepladder** (9): Weird to think this was Kanye's commercial peak but a bop is a bop

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): back when Kanye was actually good

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): when are good, popular rappers gonna make tracks with these sorts of dance beats again

**Roxieloxie** (7.4): fuck kayne but this kinda bops

**anothertown** (7): i too would do anything for a blonde dyke

**slur in username** (6.3): It’s dumb how some artists can get praise and others get criticism for releasing the same kind of cliché song such as this one.

**vayyiqra** (6): I've never really liked this song and don't think it's a very good use of this sample, but since it's one of my favourite Daft Punk songs ever I can't hate it too much, and upon relistening the synth is really good, so I'm bumping up my rating a bit. (Except I forgot about that awful "blonde dyke" line. What the hell is that.)

I think the sub has always liked Kendrick Lamar, except when he was featured in that Maroon 5 song. Kendrick was already an appreciated artist but with DAMN. he strengthened his name and passed from being great to being one of the greatest. I love how he indirectly calls himself the Saviour by sitting at Jesus’ seat in Da Vinci's “Last Supper” and how it turns the message of the song into a preach. If Kendrick tells you to sit down, you’re sitting the fuck down… bitch. It’s really a great song.

---

**915BEAST** (11): i’d give it to DNA or King Kunta but this is still deserving

**slimboyfriend** (11): I'm thinking either this song or Hey Ya is gonna win, and I'm complicit in both scenarios

**waluigiest** (11): masterful. It’s understated and gives him a chance to flex his lyricism and flow and it just works so well. It’s honestly so evocative. Bonus for how fluid its incorporation into Beychella was

**1998tweety** (10): a MEGA bop. Not a fan of Kendrick's usual delivery (sue me), but this is good. We love a beat that was used on Money and Sally Walker.

**\_wailordfan** (10): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYqpcGrZlIo

**bespectacIed** (10): Ahhhh remember those glorious days when literally everyone, even non-hiphop fans, celebrated when this was released and went number 1? Kendrick is just the easiest artist to root for, it's as natural as breathing. This song might not one of the best in his impressive discography, it is still a 10/10 song, with its infectious beat, amazing video, and burning hot verses. Kendrick doesn't have to be humble for this one, he knows he delivered.

**camerinian** (10): YEAH YEAH

**CarlieScion** (10): iconic

**frogaranaman** (10): I remember syrup sandwiches and syrup sandwiches, finesse a –– with syrup sandwiches, now I’m sandwiches, parmesan where syrup sandwiches-es, now I’m downin’ ‘wiches

**hikkaru** (10): the piano leaves me bald every time

**ignitethephoenix** (10): People were mad that Kendrick went commercial but honestly who cares? He proved that he was talented with TPAB and this is a good hip hop song even though it’s commercial. It’s iconic and the music video is amazing too.

**MrSwearword** (10): wonderfully crafted music. The controversy around the photoshop lyric only made it more popular (and was stupid as shit too)

**radiofan15** (10): Dragon Kung Fu Kenny spitting fire AS usual...

**rhyneston3** (10): Was this actually Kendrick’s first number one?? Wild

**rickikardashian** (10): Remember when this song was praised for supporting natural women, and then was criticized for objectifying women, all because of the same line? Yeah, I think that's a pretty great example of how people on Twitter work

**Roxieloxie** (10): that friday Damn came out i vividly remember all of us having a free day in P.E. so we spent all of first period listening to the album and it was an experience man

**rsmitty99** (10): I have a feeling this will win. I was torn between this and Hey Ya! with my 11.

**sbb618** (10): It may not have been quite what we expected for a follow-up to To Pimp a Butterfly, but it's great on its own nevertheless.

**silentev** (10): Every time somebody tells me to stay humble I tell them to stay Kendrick Lamar and to sit down; bless this simple but perfect beat and excellent lyricism.

**slur in username** (10): Best music video of 2017

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): I used to be a very anti-rap person, but this song was one of the first if not the first that made me change my mind on that. Undeniably a great song, regardless of musical tastes.

**runaway3212** (9.5): Kendrick Lamar is amazing, this is not even his best song and it's sooo good

**ImADudeDuh** (9): A moment in pop culture yas

**steelstepladder** (9): not Kendrick's best but the best artist of the decade

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Very hype when it came out but it hasn't aged all that well. At this point probably the second or third most skipable track in DAMN.

**1nf1n1te** (8.5): probably my least favorite Kendrick radio song so of course it was the most successful

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): Am I the only one who’d like to hear the hook being sung by someone else?

**twat\_brained** (8): bit of a meme but K-Dot is fantastic here, and is certainly worthy of my attention

**vayyiqra** (6): I REMEMBER SYRUP SANDWICHES and thinking "wow that sounds disgusting". Anyway I have no idea how to rate this song because it's weird but it's an okay meme so it's getting a 6 I guess.

**fishingfor8** (5): it's literally the worst Kendrick single ever

For many, this is the real Kanye West and where he was at his best. The lyrical flow, the tongue-in-cheek lyrics make this song really fun to sing along to, n-word aside, and obviously the great use of Ray Charles’ singing gives it an irresistible retro vibe. It’s humorous, it makes you want to call out all your exes and I want to believe some people broke up because of this song.

---

**MrSwearword** (11): Exceptional music. Enough said.

**1998tweety** (10): a MEGA bop, easy 10. Kingye strikes again!

**1nf1n1te** (10): my old ringtone in high school

**agentofscranton** (10): the peak of kanye's career tbh

**ditacarlita** (10): this must be one of the funnest and radio friendly songs to rap along to

**frogaranaman** (10): big fan of piss as well Kanye

**hikkaru** (10): I wish there were more Kanye #1s bc the couple that are here are a breath of fresh air compared to the surrounding songs that aged poorly

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Another classic. The production is amazing and the rhythm and flow is great too. A top tier Kanye song!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Iconic

**poppinmmolly** (10): MUST NOT GIVE KANYE MY 11. MUST NOT.

**radiofan15** (10): FUN FACT... Jamie Foxx only sings the opening verse of the song, the rest of the background vocals is actually a Ray Charles interpolation.

**rhyneston3** (10): SEE HIM ON TV ANY GIVEN SUNDAY WIN THE SUPERBOWL AND DRIVE OFF IN A HYUNDAI

**rickikardashian** (10): the first time I heard this song was on Glee, and looking back at it, I truly don't think this song should have been sang by Mr. Schuester…. it just doesn't work

**rsmitty99** (10): "But she ain't messin with no broke! broke!" Probably the most popular clean version line in any rap song. Iconic.

**sbb618** (10): All-time great sample plus all-time great verses...how could this not become a hit? (Also America was weirdly nuts around Ray Charles from about 2004-2006)

**silentev** (10): Can we go back to this Kanye please because this lyrical flow was perfection and with Jamie Foxx I couldn’t and still can’t get enough of this song.

**skargardin** (10): iconic

**steelstepladder** (10): Kanye is going to suffer a bit because of his recent actions (arguably deservedly so) but this is arguably the best song in the rate.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Listening to normal Kanye makes me sad now lol. Banger tho.

**twat\_brained** (10): WE WANT PRENUP!!! Well, at least, I want this Kanye back. And I want more Jamie that isn't songs like Blame It.

**camerinian** (9.5): It's really hard to rate a song so ingrained for me like this, especially a Kanye track what with all his baggage, but Ye has so many iconic lines here, the hook is timeless, and the sampling, aka the one thing that he's always been good at and still is, is one of the most genius flips he's ever made.

**slur in username** (9.1): There are a surprising number of similarities between this song and his future life with Kim Kardashian.

**915BEAST** (9): Kanye pre-Trump, the good ol’ days

**CarlieScion** (9): glee did it better

**Roxieloxie** (9): alright listen fuck kayne but.... i aint saying she a gold digger...

**runaway3212** (9): Kanye might be bad now, but he was once very good.

**waluigiest** (9): a fun song at parties because 1) people go WAY too hard to these lyrics and 2) it exposes yts who are really unafraid to say the n-word :-o

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (8.5): Kanye may be an insufferable asshole but damn it if he doesn’t make great songs. Funky and catchy as hell.

**\_wailordfan** (8): an 8 just because of the amount of white people I know that think this song is a reason to use the N word irl

**cremeebrulee** (7): Would've given it something higher before but personally I'm tired of hearing this song now

**vayyiqra** (7): I can't decide if I like this song because Kanye's pronounciation of every word with a nasal vowel rather than an /n/ or /m/ irritates me, but it's definitely better than the ridiculous "clean" version that says "BROKE BROKE"

**JustinJSrisuk** (5.5): By the time that Gold Digger came out, Jamie Foxx’ Ray Charles impression had long worn out its welcome, and it really sinks this super-quotable Kanye song.

**bespectacIed** (5): I still don't know if this shames or acknowledges gold diggers either way this to me is a rough spot in a classic hiphop album

We have a winner! I just, don’t think there’s a catchiest song than this one, and the whole point of it is that the chorus is so good people don’t pay attention to the lyrics. All the fun little bits it has prevent you from listening to the words, making you vaguely hear them, and the number of people that still happily dance to this shows how genius this track is. Fun fact: due to the song’s popularity, Polaroid had to warn customers not to do shake their pictures because it actually damages them. Just an example of the impact this has had.

**tk note:** Our winner, and a super obvious one in hindsight! This is undoubtedly one of the most beloved songs of the 21st century by one of the most beloved artists, to the point where it was even able to win a rate on /r/indieheads. I'll be genuinely shocked if there's ever a negative backlash to this like other classic songs because it has SUCH a wide appeal.

---

**bespectacIed** (11): Yeah what a no brainer 11. Deserved its immense chart and commercial success, and the reverence/overhype of critics and fans. It has beaten death as humanity's greatest equalizer, it's physically impossible for anyone no matter what race, class, gender, and taste in music, to hate this song. If this was good enough for r/indieheads to win in their greatest songs of the 2000s rate, it's good enough for this rate

**eigensheep** (11): One of the greatest songs of the 21st century, period.

**hagagaag** (11): Andre 3000.

**JustinJSrisuk** (11): I swear to god I’m permabanning every single person in the rate that gives this masterpiece anything under a 7/10.

**rsmitty99** (11): Ok I feel like people are gonna say this isn't a hip hop song. And it isn't. But this is the BEST song on this list. Every millennial and their mother knows this song. That "1, 2, 3, uh!" will bring the house down at both a middle school dance and bingo night at a retirement home. I will be shaking it like a polaroid picture til I die. Polaroid corporation be damned.

**sbb618** (11): It says a lot that in a rate with some of the greatest hits of the last 20 years, I never even thought about giving my 11 to anything else. Hey Ya! is really that good. It transcends the insane hype around it.

**static\_int\_husp** (11): best "Dance track that feels happy until you realise the deep pain in the lyrics"

**TCHALLA1966** (11): wow. Just wow.

**915BEAST** (10): the song that single handedly stoped Polaroid from going out of business

**\_wailordfan** (10): first 11 contender here

**agentofscranton** (10): if i see another post on reddit about this song actually being depressing

**ditacarlita** (10): anyone that rates this song less than ten needs to be sent to a therapist

**frogaranaman** (10): slaps my r/music subscription this bad boy can fit so much “I don’t like rap but Hey Ya! slaps” in it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): So many classics in this part of the rate! Another favourite of mine! One of the greatest songs of the 2000’s.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Legendaric

**itsabop (hals)** (10): Shake it like a Polaroid picture!

**MrSwearword** (10): Of the few songs that constantly get praise, this is actually worth it

**poppinmmolly** (10): a bop!!!

**radiofan15** (10): https://imgur.com/HzlukjN

**rhyneston3** (10): Fellas? Fellas?? FELLAS?????

**rickikardashian** (10): the obsession indie singers have with covering this song acoustically is honestly worrying. not every happy sounding song that has a darker undertone needs to be made slow and stripped down. put down the guitar and just enjoy this bop Jacob

**Roxieloxie** (10): alright

**slur in username** (10): Amazing song with multiple iconic lines. One of the few music videos that I somehow both like and dislike. Seeing Andre 3000 as various band members is wonderful but the constant screaming ruins the vid.

**steelstepladder** (10): Still slaps at parties today

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): How the fuck can you not love this song. Seriously I don’t think I’ve ever met anyone who dislikes this song or thinks it’s even mediocre. If you don’t like Hey Ya I’m convinced you don’t have a soul. Very nearly got my 11.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): I mean come on.

**vayyiqra** (10): ALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHTALRIGHT this song is iconic, genius, perfection :clap: :clap: :clap:

**zaminizjammin** (10): Andre is a sneaky one for making one of the biggest bops of all time lyrically melancholy

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): This song will win

**twat\_brained** (9.1): we NEED more songs which sound cheery but are actually desperately existential and filled with dread over unsatisfied relationships.

**camerinian** (9): (WatchMojo bitch voice) Outkast's number one hit Hey Ya! is well-loved for its upbeat party vibe and irresistible hook. But if you look at the lyrics, you'll realise just how sad this song actually is. Lead singer Andre 3000 is

**CarlieScion** (9): the original depressing song concealed as a happy song

**runaway3212** (9): Energetic and better every listen

**silentev** (9): Except you aren’t supposed to shake polaroid pictures.

**waluigiest** (9): this song is severely overplayed almost two decades after it was released; I feel like every party I go to plays it as a quirky throwback even though it can’t be that quirky if everyone is constantly thinking about it. That being said, it’s postmodern hip hop excellence so I’m not even mad. I use it to practice conducting sometimes because of the 2/4 measures lol

**fishingfor8** (8.5): somehow this song is still overplayed 15+ years later.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.1): my mom’s favorite rap song

**anothertown** (8): this really was the best song i'd ever heard when i was 11 but my brain can no longer process the sum of its parts anymore 15 years later, it's so overplayed. iconic though

**hikkaru** (7): so this very poppy song can be included in the rate but not Like a G6? we all know which of the two songs have a bigger cultural impact and are more remembered and more iconic and better overall and by an artist(s) that are actually remembered in the history of music and have multiple other hits than just the song I mentioned here... (in all seriousness I've always found this song to be a tad overrated, it's too repetitive imo)

**1998tweety** (6): This is a good song but why is it here lmao

**gannade** (5): its really overrated and if i listen to it for more than 30 seconds i get annoyed. overall its okay tho

Awhile2: top 10 is pretty damn good. after that it gets a lot less consistent. crank that, kiss kiss, and lollipop are both way too low

TragicKingdom1: Thank you all for doing the rate and thank you /u/MashLuke for putting in work as my cohost!

I guess there's no better way to conclude a TK rate than with updating the 11 wins: https://pastebin.com/V13QEFjq

rickikardashian: When I was submitting, I had to look myself in the mirror and repeat to myself that I had to give Nice For What my 11 for being the song I liked the most even tho my other 2 options (Hey Ya, Golddigger) would probably win the rate and I would get another winning 11..........

I didn't work, I'm mad, fuck Drake lives
