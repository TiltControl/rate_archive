So here we are. I don’t think anybody is surprised by this going out first, it’s the song that got the most zeros in the rate. XXXTentacion was a controversial rapper and person and this subreddit has always been pretty vocal about not supporting him. Personally, I think this song was far from being the worst in the rate as its melody and production are creative, but I can’t say I don’t understand why people don’t like it. Guess everyone wanted to personally drag him like they dragged him into the ground!

**TK note:** somehow this is not the lowest scoring song in rate history! On My Own, Birthday Cake (Remix), and Somethin' Bout a Truck are all lower.

---

**mms82** (10): I know XXXTENTACION is a bad person but all the money of this song now goes to his abused GF and their son to slightly assuage your guilt for listening to this fantastic song. this song is amazing. it's peak soundcloud, and the whole ? album is a masterpiece start to finish with this song as the best of it. honestly probably the best "emo" song of all time

**radiofan15** (10): R.I.P. Jahseh... Lena Dunham and his trasy ex-bf deserved what happened to you!

**1998tweety** (9): X is trash but this actually kind of goes off. Sorry not sorry.

**twat\_brained** (7.3): I'm sad I know how much you deserved to die when you were alive yet your defenders still shield themselves from the truth and try to paint over your history of abuse with all the people you helped and inspired. Yes, I still stan Billie Eilish but PLEASE TELL HER TO STOP GLORIFYING THIS GODDAMNED CORPSE FFS. Oh right, the song. Eh, it's okay I guess. Fuck everybody that made it #1 though.

**cremeebrulee** (7): Acknowledging he's a POS and that this song is also a vibe at the same time

**rickikardashian** (6.8): A while ago on tiktok they made a trend with an audio that was the intro of this song, and the "OOGA CHAKA OOGA OOGA OOGA CHAKA" from Hooked On A Feeling, and each time this song started I was expecting that sound (ngl, probably would give it a higher score if it was that)

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): Lowest rating in popheads rates history?

**fishingfor8** (5): this would be good if... ya know... so because of that I'm officially declaring myself indifferent to this song.

**sbb618** (5): What the hell is with the message of this song

**ditacarlita** (4): wtf is this

**frogaranaman** (4): lmao

**rhyneston3** (4): Trash person, recyclable song

**steelstepladder** (4): Definitely going to be the lowest rated song in the rate but if I'm being completely honest there are worse songs here. XXX the person gets a zero but X has worse songs than this.

**vayyiqra** (4): [NOT GOOD]

**bespectacIed** (2): Justified circlehate on X aside, this isn't even a decent song??? It's so fucking boring and morose, why did this become so popular in X's discography? He could be the patron side of kindness and I still wouldn't want to hear this song again

**waluigiest** (2): this is actually my first time hearing this song, and for that reason I feel victorious

**915BEAST** (1): it’s x, nuff said

**camerinian** (1): ^ what they said

**CarlieScion** (1): if i had a second 0 this would be it

**eigensheep** (1): Threatening your partner with suicide if they leave is textbook abuser shit

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Lmao this song is manipulative af and just sounds like shit, Alexa play Glad He's Gone.

**letsallpoo** (1): gurl

**MrSwearword** (1): ugh this sucks

**Roxieloxie** (1): absofuckingloutely not

**rsmitty99** (1): I don't know her

**silentev** (1): What is this and what is he mumbling and how did this ever become a number one hit because all I hear is an emo crybaby rapping over a gunshot beat?

**\_wailordfan** (0): OOOOOO WEEEEEEEE let's go sub 1.0 average. Seriously, there's no need to even give this piece of poo any credibility in death.

**CreepyMannequin** (0): https://i.imgur.com/7BuGhlp.jpg

**hikkaru** (0): easiest 0 ever. good riddance

**ignitethephoenix** (0): Other than the fact that Xxxtentacles was a shitty person, this song is not that good at all. He sounds whiny with a mix of getting too whispery at points (he’s barely singing) and the message of saying “I’ll kill myself if you leave” is very cringey and immature (I guess he was a teenager though but it’s still not message that you should sing in music and also most teenagers definitely know better).

**itsabop (hals)** (0): Nope

**jackisboredtoday** (0): I refuse to give him a stream… I refuse

**JustinJSrisuk** (0): Just no.

**poppinmmolly** (0): boooooo

**rotating3Dtext** (0): it doesn’t really matter, no?

**skargardin** (0): I wasn't going to listen to this out of disgust and principle but I decided to give it one listen because, well, every song should be listened to and all that. I seriously wish I hadn't.

**slimboyfriend** (0): Yes he was a bad person AND this is the least interesting song in this rate

**slur in username** (0): This song was released by XXXTentacion which means you know it’s going to be shit.

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Not only is the an absolutly trash song, it's also performed by one of the worst people in 2010s hip hop culture. Soooooo, bye.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (0): do i really have to explain why im giving this song a 0. like not only was x a terrible person but this song fucking sucks to boot. not to mention the fact that my brother is a huge fucking x fan and plays this song all the time and as loud as he possibly can at any given moment so i constantly have to hear this annoying song too. so yeah needless to say i’d give this song a negative score if i could.

This song is low but interestingly enough I was one of the only zeroes for it, so let me explain myself. I researched how such a song came together, and it turns out that every individual element of this song is bad. Quite bad. I like to think of Khaled as your friend’s little brother: that unbearable guy who would always hang with your friend group for no reason whatsoever. A ubiquitous and annoying entity and that you just can’t get rid of. Well, we got rid of him today.

**tk note:** I think this song is kinda cute actually but it's quite generic so the hate makes sense to me. The absolute gag that being generic was apparently a bigger crime than being Chris Brown though!

---

**mms82** (10): such an unbelievably catchy song

**1998tweety** (9): I guess it's a bop? The verses are meh but at least the chorus slaps.

**slur in username** (8.6): DJ Khaled was a basically a Facebook mum in 2017, parading off his son with endless photos.

**awhile2** (8): really underrated song tbh. all three verses are full of iconic lines. definetly one of the funnest songs to rap along to in the car with the windows down during the summer in recent years

**bespectacIed** (8): This might not be the greatest of songs, and it's easy to hate it because of DJ Khaled, but it's a feel-good song. I have fond memories of summer 2017 due to it

**CarlieScion** (8): is it sad that i actually really like this

**rhyneston3** (8): DJ KHALED another one (woo)

**hikkaru** (7.5): really corny but also really catchy

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Justin Bieber’s chorus basically carried this song. Every other element of this song is mediocre at best.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): As much as I hate like, half the people on this song, they all make it work

**letsallpoo** (7): this is a good song

**rsmitty99** (7): Catchy as fuck. Can't stand DJ Khaled. And quavo annoys me with his

**sbb618** (7): DJ Khaled is obviously just throwing whoever he could pull together at the wall and hoping a hit sticks. Unfortunately for us, it worked. Two years on, I can't remember a single line from the numerous verses of this song.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): It's very funny to think that DJ Khaled tried to recreate this track and its success,  but failed so miserably that I can't tell you the name of the other song he did with the same lineup

**fishingfor8** (6): yes I like this more than humble leave me alone

**jackisboredtoday** (6): pleasant, mediocre…. this is definitely a song that exists. there’s not much to say

**rotating3Dtext** (6): can’t believe this went to number 1 tbh

**Roxieloxie** (6): why was everyone on this song

**runaway3212** (6): I want to hate this song, but it's not that bad, just incredibly generic

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): This was a whole lot of fun for about two whole weeks in spring 17' but it definitely has not withstood the test of time. In fact, it failed it like weeks after it came out lol. Anyway, I don't hate it as much as most people seem to and I still think Bieber's hook is pretty catchy.

**ditacarlita** (5): the level of autotune is this a test

**gannade** (5): i really like chances verse and thats about it

**steelstepladder** (5): a perfectly mediocre song. A true five out of ten.

**anothertown** (4): this song sounds like this https://i.imgur.com/v4RKavk.jpg

**camerinian** (4): It's better than No Brainer in basically every way for what it's worth.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4): The youtube thumbnail of this song looks like Minecraft

**vayyiqra** (4): boring

**silentev** (2.5): I don’t want another one DJ Khaled please stop, especially if its Bieber singing ooaahs weirdly and two rappers who have been autotuned so badly that my cat ran away.

**915BEAST** (2): quavo what are you doing

**JustinJSrisuk** (1.5): We really should’ve seen that The Big Day was coming from Chance due to this awful Khaled paint-by-numbers track. No one with taste would’ve been caught dead appearing on something so empty and artistically devoid.

**frogaranaman** (1): I’m honestly mad at how much this just sounds like if Shape Of You was a rap song with a better bass

**ImADudeDuh** (1): Chance sweetie im so sorry you had to be on this shit song, but also you gave a shit verse so it's kinda your fault.

**MrSwearword** (1): no, there's several accomplices in this melophobic hate crime

**radiofan15** (1): Justin is half-asleep, Lil Wayne is delivering his D- game, Quavo is doing "something", Chance is being as corny as usual and Dj Khaled... he's breathing smoke and eating some chips right there in the corner counting down his money and thinking on how does vaginas taste like...

**skargardin** (1): This song is completely lifeless, devoid of any purpose and incredibly bloated to boot

**waluigiest** (1): no sauce

**twat\_brained** (0): this is little more than mindless noise pollution. And why the hell are there so many Bonnie and Clyde shoutouts? They were fucking murderers, don't glorify that. In fact, don't let me ever hear this again, I can't stand it.

Why host a rate with one abuser when you can have two? Honestly, this song has charisma, it’s fun… it’s nice, really. It’s consciously frivolous and silly and I think is what makes it good. If you don’t like it though, try thinking of another C.B. when T-Pain shouts “It's T.P. and C.B.” Imagine T-Pain is shouting out Charles Boyle and hitting MC Donald’s with him, that’d be fun. Although you can drag this for T-Pain’s poor choice in fast food, Burger King is better.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ok y'all better not act like this isn't a bop.

**MrSwearword** (10): a good Chris Brown song, dare I say his best.

**TCHALLA1966** (10): T-Pain did that!

**zaminizjammin** (10): That T-Pain verse alone deserves a 10

**rsmitty99** (9.9): I know I'm gonna get shit for this. But this song is a fucking banger. But I did take a 0.1 off because I have trouble separating art from the artist (not even sure if I should).

**radiofan15** (9.5): This is a BOP but is also a Chris Brown song... HELP!

**bespectacIed** (8): A bop. Fuck present Chris Brown.

**camerinian** (8): I genuinely fucking hate that this slaps so hard. I also genuinely fucking hate that this isn't just a T-Pain solo track because he is doing basically all the heavy lifting here.

**ditacarlita** (8): when CB performed this and wall to wall and brought out rih at the vmas i fucking stanned that shit

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This song is actually decent but because it has you know who on it it’s going to go out in the bottom 5 songs even though it should be in the top half.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): not as good as run it.

**twat\_brained** (6.4): great beat and killer hook. the final verse just wrecked so much of its momentum though

**rhyneston3** (6): It’s aight

**\_wailordfan** (5): Chris is a -4

**rickikardashian** (5): Real talk, how many times are we going to rate Chris Brown? I feel like we have had more rates with him in them than with Madonna, Britney or any big pop girl. I'm just so confused as to forreal how he got so big, considering his voice is straight up so fucking annoying, and I'm not just saying it because he's a garbage human being, almost all the songs of him would be like twice as good if absolutely anyone else sang it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): This really ain't it.

**vayyiqra** (5): Why even bother trying to rate a song by Chris Brown fairly; but also, despite being a piece of human shit, Chris Brown has some okay songs; but this is not one of them. I only like T-Pain's part and the radio station gimmick, and that's probably only because I work at a college radio station.

**fishingfor8** (4): totally indifferent to this song. I couldn't care less about it.

**steelstepladder** (4): Chris Brown never justified his existence even before the scandal

**runaway3212** (3.5): Just not good at all

**jackisboredtoday** (3): not good even by Chris Brown standards, i was always perplexed that this was so big

**mms82** (3): okay I don't think I've ever streamed this song but how does an intro like that stay in a song these days and people still listen to it

**Roxieloxie** (3): "what dem boys gon do for me"

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (3): The T Pain part is the only reason I’m not giving this a 1

**JustinJSrisuk** (2.5): Okay, so there is one Chris Brown song that somewhat enjoy which is Forever - this isn’t forever though, it’s a sour “kiss”-off to his “haters”, which becomes pretty unfortunate when you consider that post-2009, the majority of people Brown considers to be his haters are, in fact, simply those who call him out on his toxic behavior.

**silentev** (2): Fake radio into/outros are really annoying I swear, and not even T-Pain can make me like this over-autotuned CB song.

**waluigiest** (2): annoying

**915BEAST** (1): I should have saved my 0

**frogaranaman** (1): nowhere near the level of iconic as KISS KISS FALL IN LOVE HEY HEY HEY I SEE YOU COME I WATCH YOU GO YOU NEVER SEEM TO LEAVE ME THOUGH SO IS THIS LOVE OR HATE WE’LL SEE YOU’RE MAKING ME CRAZY INSIDE MY DREAMS YOU’RE ALL I SEE WELL ALL I SEE IS YOU AND ME

**static\_int\_husp** (1): not only is this a Cris Brown song, it's also really bad.

**cremeebrulee** (0): Giving this the zero because I actually rated the other Chris Brown song so hopefully it cancels out

**eigensheep** (0): Abuser + bad autotune + random sound effects = noooooope

I didn’t know this song before hosting this rate and while I’m not a prude at all, these lyrics mentally turned me into the most basic white mum. This track is definitely explicit. It’s a bit too much for me, I don’t think I could listen to this fully clothed, while walking down the street. I’d rather wander around my city listening to The Weeknd talking about cocaine like normal people do. I had to take a shower after listening to this.

**tk note:** i appreciate the silliness, but Back That Azz Up is the much more iconic hit by Juvenile!

---

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): My ears need birth control now, thanks.

**sbb618** (8): "According to Billboard, the song is about sex.[1]" Real perceptive, Wikipedia.

**anothertown** (7): outsold third eye blind

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): I kinda like it.

**1998tweety** (6.5): We need to ban some people from singing, please just hire a better vocalist.

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): was this a meme song back in the day? Because it sounds like it would be (that broken dick line?!)

**frogaranaman** (6): slowfies

**steelstepladder** (6): Back that Azz up but worse

**vayyiqra** (6): MY NECK, MY BACK both really hurt I should go back to physiotherapy

**waluigiest** (6): this vibes but also makes me viscerally uncomfortable

**ditacarlita** (5): um no

**ImADudeDuh** (5): idk its ok

**rhyneston3** (5): His flow is quite grating on the chorus… it almost sounds like he’s a bit off beat?

**rsmitty99** (5): Kinda boring

**runaway3212** (5): A rather mediocre song

**mms82** (4): I kinda like the chorus of the mantra like "slow motion for me" which is weirdly catchy but ooh the rest of this song is so bad

**MrSwearword** (4): unpleasant but there's far worse I've heard

**slur in username** (3.6): Find this song extremely dull and uninteresting and too repetitive. The words “slow motion” is repeated 49 times during this song.

**rickikardashian** (3.5): The song gets repetitive, annoying and tired. The lyrics are ugly, and I could forgive that if they were clever and/or funny, but they just aren't

**radiofan15** (3.2): It surely lives up to its title.

**silentev** (3): Why does it sound like Juvenile is whining?

**camerinian** (2.5): Show of hands, how many people were familiar with song before the rate? I genuinely don't know, but if it was a lot, I'm just saying I wouldn't be surprised.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (2): This was a number one hit????

**twat\_brained** (1.1): BRUH I WAS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS THINKING IT WAS TREY SONGZ' SLOW MOTION I FEEL SO BAMBOOZLED THIS SONG ISN'T EVEN GOOD IT JUST REMINDS ME OF ALL THE SEX I NEVER HAVE FUCK THESE GUYS

**agentofscranton** (0): this honest to god feels like a parody of hip-hop, and that line about saying the women who he beat up were lying is fucking gross

I read somewhere that Mims was pouring his heart out on his music but he just couldn’t get a hit. He dedicatedly would write for hours about serious matters but after some years he was still unnoticed, so one day he told himself: “fuck it, all radios hits are dumb, imma make money with a dumb one as well.” And the rest is history. At least, American history, because nobody knows this song outside of the US.

---

**1998tweety** (9): An iconic song but it doesn't have much besides that hook.

**awhile2** (9): if this wasnt your ringtone at one point idk what ur doing

**mms82** (9): how did this song age so well? idk but its still sooo catchy

**radiofan15** (9): What is this song? The production and the samples are a FUCKING MESS and I love every single of it, but his flow can choke in his own bile tho.

**rhyneston3** (9): Eleven year old me thought I was hot shit cause I could rap the chorus semi-successfully

**twat\_brained** (8.9): i actually remember this from my sisters having it on their laptop; they probably copped it from LimeWire. the guy fucking samples ain't nothin but a g thang then jesus walks and then pLAYS THE SONG'S HOOK ON A THEREMIN HE'S ALL OVER THE PLACE WHY DID WE SHUN THIS GUY I LOVE HIM. can we officially call him the Bobby Shmurda of the 2000s?

**bespectacIed** (8): I am forgiving the bland, repetitive lyrics cuz it's too iconique

**waluigiest** (8): sometimes the people need to know…

**anothertown** (7): ahead of its time

**sbb618** (7): "I'm hot cuz I'm fly/You ain't cuz you not": DEVASTATING

**vayyiqra** (7): This song is really obnoxious but also catchy and I hate that its instrumental is really good (peep the musical quote from gangsta rap classic "Nuthin' But a 'G' Thang")

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): Was this a meme song before meme songs existed? The lines in this song are gold.

**runaway3212** (5.5): At least it's not terrible

**CarlieScion** (5): more like This Is Why This Song Is Bad am i right

**rsmitty99** (5): Meh

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): Fun but meh.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.4): he said he didnt have to rap and he barely did on this song

**rickikardashian** (4): the production sounds like it doesn't know what it wants to do. they just added effects and sounds randomly in different parts of the song

**skargardin** (4): Literally have no idea who this is and the song is grating to boot

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.5): MiMS stands for “music is my savior”, but sadly this limp #1 didn’t do much to save MiMS’ career.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (3): Mims isn’t even that attractive this song lied to me

**ImADudeDuh** (2): yikes lmao

**silentev** (2): So I think MiMS is trying to tell me something and its that he’s hot but I can’t really tell, maybe he needs to tell me over and over and over again one more time.

**steelstepladder** (2): the naughts were the absolute worst decade for one hit wonders

**camerinian** (1): Are you proud of yourself America

**eigensheep** (1): Probably the first song to hit number one exclusively off of ringtone sales

When Eminem released this song and his album Recovery, it was lowkey a pretty big moment. Him talking about his controversial past and getting personal about his family was an unexpected move for him. The problem most serious songs have is that if you don’t convey the message in a powerful or catchy way, it ends up sounding limp and bland. I personally like the song but it certainly doesn’t stand out, even for lyricism. It’s kind of a bubble-gum rap song, with inspirational quotes here and there but it ultimately doesn't inspire much.

---

**rhyneston3** (10): My favourite Eminem song, it sounds like it

**slur in username** (10): This was the first time I grasped how big Eminem’s fanbase is. Was too young to remember his initial success but then he made his “comeback” with Recovery and it was mega-successful

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Not a fan of Em*nem but this song kinda goes.

**frogaranaman** (8): hold on, my 37.5% white is coming out right now,

**rickikardashian** (8): This feels a lot like those generic "I'm with you, you're not alone, we can do it" songs that teen pop artists release to pander to their insecure young fanbase, but instead of being \*Disney Star #8*, it's Eminem

**silentev** (8): I like when Eminem is having fun with his lyrics, but I love when he is being serious as it has more impact and feeling.

**skargardin** (8): Bop that will most likely get robbed a lil

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I prefer sarcastic and cocky Eminem rather than serious Eminem.

**915BEAST** (7): ah yes, that period in which em wasn’t bad but we were all waiting for shady to come back

**waluigiest** (7): OMG when this came out I was in middle school and this felt like a huge, rebirth I era as it was happening. There are a lot of questionable lines (the Christmas line???) but this has got some redeeming qualities. Unironically, the bridge is really nice :-)

**ditacarlita** (6.5): a try hard lose yourself

**rsmitty99** (6): I had this at an 8, then I heard the bridge.

**vayyiqra** (6): I grew up listening to Eminem, but by the time this song came out he'd fallen off for me. This song has a nice instrumental and chorus but something about it feels like "generic inspirational anthem #345325 only with Eminem rapping angrily over it". It's nothing special.

**camerinian** (5.5): another technically fine Eminem song that fails to inspire any sort of emotion, positive or otherwise. Just another day

**radiofan15** (5.2): I'm sorry Em stans but this is bland crap... Eminem has done this kind of inspirational stuff way better both before AND after this one.

**runaway3212** (5): A severly watered down version of 'Lose yourself' and not nearly as good

**slimboyfriend** (5): Did I hear a fart reference in there?

**steelstepladder** (5): ehh... Em at his most boring

**agentofscranton** (4): god every douchebag in high school used to quote this song on the daily eurgh

**cremeebrulee** (4): Ehhh not my fave Em song, it always sounded a bit cheesy to me. The bridge saves it a little though

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4): I’m afraid

**Roxieloxie** (3): why are you making me listen to eeniemeenie, tk

**JustinJSrisuk** (2.5): As bad as Relapse was, there’s nothing I fine more interminable than preachy Em.

**hikkaru** (2): listen i normally give songs i'm bored by like a 5 but somehow this is so boring it's in trash tier and gets a 2

**ImADudeDuh** (2): when this was one of the most viewed youtube videos.... sis

**twat\_brained** (2): if you're so unafraid how come this beat feels so restrained?

**MrSwearword** (1): oh jesus, gross

**1998tweety** (0): Homophobic misogynistic trash, but this song is decent. I have an irrational hatred for this song cause my middle school bullies were obsessed with Eminem, especially this song. Also hearing Em singing that chorus about wanting to come together and take a stand, while constantly spitting out homophobia (in other songs) is such a slap in the face. Fuck off.

**letsallpoo** (0): this aged like eminem

**williamdowley123** (0): i hate this song so much omg

I like this song. I think Charlie’s vocals convey sadness and the chorus with the repeated “ooh ooh” feels like a genuine cry for help. Wiz Khalifa does his thing, pretty enjoyable despite not adding much. This song was a proper soundtrack for that Fast and Furious film. A song designed to sell, for a saga designed to sell. If this wasn’t dedicated to Paul Walker people wouldn’t have loved it so much, but it's catchy regardless.

**tk note:** melodramatic to the point where i see an ironic meme revival for this in the future

---

**1998tweety** (10): BOP Charlie Puth is an absolute kind, the rap verses are decent too.

**CarlieScion** (10): lowkey makes me cry

**ditacarlita** (10): this song never ceases to make me really emotional

**frogaranaman** (10): me looking at this song title: jesus please no, this is a 2 | the second the first note hits: 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺 10 🥺🥺🥺🥺🥺

**poppinmmolly** (10): any song that makes me cry gets a 10. One time this was playing on the radio while I saw a funeral procession pull up to a church and it made me SAD.

**radiofan15** (10): R.I.P. Paul Walker... Ava Max deserved what happened to you!

**slur in username** (10): Was surprised at how much widespread news and success came after the tragic death of Paul Walker. Out of all the celebrity deaths this decade, Paul Walker’s felt the biggest.

**sbb618** (9.5): This song got ROBBED at the Oscars

**cremeebrulee** (9): Ok this songs hits a little too close to home for me so I don't know if I should give it a really high score cause it makes me cry or somewhere lower cause it makes me cry

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Ugh, so sad.

**Roxieloxie** (9): 2015 was a good year for pop music

**rsmitty99** (8.5): Still don't Like Wiz. But this song makes me tear up a bit

**rickikardashian** (8): Objectively speaking, the song is alright, but to me it got tied to so many of my friends moving out of the country I just get kinda emotional listening to it

**static\_int\_husp** (8): Decent, but also way to overplayed

**twat\_brained** (7.6): of all the songs to dethrone Uptown Funk. Of ALL FUCKING SONGS… why this one? I don't even hate it that much I'm just really underwhelmed that this replaced it

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Never really cared for F&F or this song. But Charlie’s part is definitely memorable.

**itsabop (hals)** (6.5): Some extra points for that piano melody, but god this song was so irritating when it was #1

**silentev** (6.5): Songs written for movies are usually cheesy and while this is, it does get some credit for having some heart considering the circumstances (Paul Walker) but it still feels a little dull.

**rhyneston3** (6): Unrelated but does anyone remember when Wiz, Andre 3000, TI and Lil Wayne all collaborated on a Kesha song? That was hype

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): All I'm saying is that if Paul Walker was alive this song would have peaked at #47. Not only that but Charlie Puth wouldn't even have been relevant enough to make out with Meghan Trainor on national television. But we can't have nice things.

**vayyiqra** (6): I kind of like the instrumental, especially the production on the drums, but lyrically this has more syrup than my whole home country of Canada in the winter / who is even Charlie Puth and why does he sound like The Weeknd here.

**915BEAST** (5): not hip-hop

**hikkaru** (5): RIP and all that but these adult contemporary radio friendly hip hop hits are not interesting at all

**MrSwearword** (4): I should nuke this worse but I mean, there's worse and at least it's a tasteful sendoff to Paul Walker...at least I think it's tasteful...I hope

**runaway3212** (4): Charlie Puth before he was anything close to good. Wiz sounds the more tired than ever. Really bad.

**\_wailordfan** (3): A straight anthem

**bespectacIed** (3): RIP paul walker but I really can't stand this cheesy ballad with a rap feature

**slimboyfriend** (3): Personally, I'd be so angry if I died and THIS was the song that was dedicated to me

**steelstepladder** (3): I still have no idea why this song was as big as it was

**waluigiest** (3): No spice or inspiration to be found

**agentofscranton** (2.5): soggy bread in song form teebs

**JustinJSrisuk** (2.5): A dull, hollow slog of a memorial song that has neither the gravitas of a funeral dirge nor the actual heartfelt sorrow of a genuine remembrance of a lost loved one, See You Again is an insipid little nothing of a song that, if it were written in memory of me, would seriously disappoint my soul in the bowels of Hell as it sounds like a fill-in-the-blank eulogy that was written by committee. Sure, One Sweet Day is cloying and clichéd but at the very least Mariah and Boyz II Men sold the melodrama of that song with their ebullient grief - the same certainly cannot be said about Charlie Puth’s lethargic delivery and Wiz Khalifa’s vacant verses.

**camerinian** (2): Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth go together like peanut butter and smegma

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (2): If I died and someone wrote this song to honor me I’d come back to life to slap them for making something so horrible.

**mms82** (0): ugh this song has always been so bad and corny. normally really like Wiz Khalifa and like all of Charlie Puth's stuff Attention onwards but oofa does this song just fail and doesn't get helped by the fact that it's beyond overplayed

Here we have a young Chris Breezy fully immersed in his teenage years, doing teenage things like having a number one hit song. According to this song, he was allegedly already so good at love-making at age 16 that girls couldn't believe he was so young, but I'm pretty sure most girls would have been turned off as soon as he brought up his age. Nonetheless, this song is sort of cool.

**tk note:** slaps! no pun intended

---

**ditacarlita** (10): fuck me in the asshole this song is good, i dont care if it's CB

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I mean, it's a bop, idgaf. Me giving this song a 10 will have no reprecussions to myself or chris brown in the real world, so i'll just give it a 10

**sailormunelune** (10): absolute classic idc

**fishingfor8** (9): can I please not rate this? Let me explain, I'm judging the songs purely off of their quality blah blah blah... basically this would've been my 11 if it wasn't Chris Brown. It's a really good song it's just a shame CB sings on. It.

**bespectacIed** (8.5): Prepubescent chris brown had the tea, I hate to admit. His only good contribution to mankind

**rsmitty99** (8.5): CHRIS BROWN IS AN AWFUL MAN! CHRIS BROWN IS AN AWFUL MAN! CHRIS BROWN IS AN AWFUL MAN! this song slaps CHRIS BROWN IS AN AWFUL MAN! CHRIS BROWN IS AN AWFUL MAN! CHRIS BROWN IS AN AWFUL MAN!

**slur in username** (8.1): I still find it hard to believe that it took 4 years for Chris Brown to be involved in an assault charge. Especially considering he’s been in disputes for just about every year since that awful incident.

**1998tweety** (8): Chris Brown more like Chris BOP. He's trash but lemme appreciate this.

**cremeebrulee** (8): Ugh...... I acknowledge that Chrs Brwn is a piece of shit but this song goes off :/

**ignitethephoenix** (8): This will be out very quickly but it’s a bop even though it’s a Chris brown song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): It's always fuck Chris Brown szn but I am sorry to announce that song kinda bangs.

**vayyiqra** (8): Wait what the fuck did this song just interpolate the 1982 new wave hit "I Know What Boys Like" by the Waitresses? I like this song and luckily was able to judge it impartially because I didn't know Chris Brown was on it until near the end

**radiofan15** (7.5): It's not really THAT bad... Chris sounds annoying but the rapper really saves it.

**sbb618** (7.5): It's kinda surreal to know that this is what Michael Jackson would be singing if he was 30 years younger

**hagagaag** (7): screw Chris Brown, but I'm gonna separate the art from the artist for the rate

**itsabop (hals)** (7): Welp

**twat\_brained** (7): i was gonna give this a better score but then i heard that "i can't be 16" lyric, and if I'm honest, Juelz' verse is actually super lame. This is nowhere near as good as I remember it being.

**frogaranaman** (6): I hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate hate HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE HATE how much this still hits

**rhyneston3** (6): This rate reminded me to delete all my CB songs off my Apple Music so I’m giving him pity points

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): even discounting that this is chrs brwn this is mediocre at best

**CreepyMannequin** (5): Chris Brown is a 0 but this song is a 11 so I split the difference

**skargardin** (4): this kinda bops but it's also Chris Brown so out of principle i cant go too high

**silentev** (3): I can’t believe I was forced to listen to this for the first time since middle school. Like okay CB can sing but why does this beat sound exactly like Yeah!?

**static\_int\_husp** (3): Chris Brown

**runaway3212** (2.5): Chris Brown is the Maroon 5 of rap, but even worse and this song is his absolute low

**agentofscranton** (2): the waitresses deserve better than to have their 10 of a song associated with this nonce

**anothertown** (2): we really thought chris brown had an AMAZing voice in 2006 LOL

**camerinian** (2): Shout out to Juelz Santana for somehow managing to be a worse performer that Chris Fucking Brown at age fucking 16

**rickikardashian** (2): great to know that Chris Brown's voice has been insufferable since his beginning. Also, the lines about his age have some ugly implications that I kind of don't want to think about

**rotating3Dtext** (2): omg he sounds like a hip hop young justin bieber, turn it off

**Roxieloxie** (2): you're really making me listen to chris brown tk, i had to put my spotify on a private session so this wouldnt scrobble.

**JustinJSrisuk** (1.5): “Separate the art from the artist!” is an argument that one often hears on online spaces from Chris Brown adherents and partisans known as “Team Breezy” - well guess what, even minus the history of reprehensible behavior and toxic attitude Chris Brown does not have that many redeeming qualities as an artist. Then, as is the case now, his weak vocals necessitate the heavy use of Auto-Tune, not as a tool for musical experimentation but as a crutch for his lack of singing ability. Even taking his catalog from before the assault(s) into consideration, there isn’t anything he brings to the table as an artist that an Usher or Ne-Yo don’t do better.

**MrSwearword** (1): not because of Chris Brown the person, but because long before that, this song was just bad. Yo and Kiss Kiss were his two good songs before he devolved into the shithole he is now.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (1): Fuck Chris Brown and fuck this song

**steelstepladder** (0): This is a worse song than SAD! in every aspect.

**waluigiest** (0): not good!

This song is the peak of stereotypical, tongue-in-cheek hip-hop culture. It has basically the same appeal as The Lonely Island: ironically silly, but not necessarily good. Pretty much just 3 minutes of talking about grills, with outstanding and clever metaphors such as: “you see more karats than a salad”. Although I have to say, having teeth looking like jelly beans is a fun analogy.

**tk note:** one of the most underrated songs in the rate! I love when hip hop doesn't take itself too seriously and the puns are genuinely super fun and entertaining

---

**1998tweety** (8): This ain't bad but wow all these songs sound the same huh.

**bespectacIed** (8): Do I only give this a high score because of the super brief Destiny's Child - Soldier sample? Yes

**rsmitty99** (8): Man Nelly really had the Midas touch back in the 2000s, didn't he?

**waluigiest** (8): i loved this as a kid - I always thought the “you wanna see my what??” was so funny

**poppinmmolly** (7.5): you wanna see my what??

**rickikardashian** (7.5): +0.5 for the Soldier reference

**twat\_brained** (7.4): The hip-hop of the dirty South will always be better than the sadboi mumble rap of today. I may not hear everything said here but it's far more intelligible. not big on the Hillary dig though, especially given recent times.

**camerinian** (7): Every time I look at my Doc for the scores, I keep thinking we're rating Gorillaz somewhere. My own expectations aside, I think I really like these songs that are just totally straightforward and about one thing. It's like fast food rap. It's better than it deserves

**ignitethephoenix** (7): The production is sick here but the fact this song has no relevance today says a lot.

**Roxieloxie** (7): " i might cause a cold front if i take a deep breath

**silentev** (7): The premise for this song is so ridiculous but I think that’s what also makes it so fun.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (7): This beat slaps! Rest of the song is nothing special but the beat definitely carries it.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): This production is so damn messy.

**radiofan15** (6.5): So Nelly was really a thing back then... how and why?

**CarlieScion** (6): this sounds so. early 2000s

**runaway3212** (6): Not bad, not great

**anothertown** (5): paul wall kind of had bars...

**rhyneston3** (5): A lot of these early 2000’s hip hop tracks have weirdly mixed vocals on the chorus

**steelstepladder** (4): Probably the worst of the Nelly hits

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (4): In a good way, this is the worst song I've ever heard.

**vayyiqra** (4): There are things to like here but mostly I hate this

**hikkaru** (3): the moist sounding noises brought this down a few points

**MrSwearword** (3): ugh, the song that made teeth jewelry popular for like three years. Just no. Three bonus points because Nelly had fun.

**eigensheep** (1): "Got a bill in my mouth like I'm Hillary Rodham" might be the worst line on any of these songs

**mms82** (1): how does the artist behind Hot in Herre and Just a Dream have songs this bad

**ImADudeDuh** (0): i hate this fucking song

This song is not Post Malone’s best. It personally was one of my songs of the summer ’18 (tm) and I have quite some memories linked to it but I knew this would have not made it far. Especially considering many music outlets named it one of the worst songs of last year, and the sub depends on the opinions of wise sages Pitchfork and Todd in the Shadows, it was bound to go out early.

**tk rate:** FUCKING ROBBED!!!! Posty main pop girl periodt!!!!!!

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ok so this is a good Post song. Love it. TD$ is the king of features too.

**frogaranaman** (10): deep breath DAMNMYAPGOINGPSYHOLILMAMABADLIKEMICHAELCANTREALLYTRUSTNOBODYWITHALLTHISJEWELRYONYOUMYROOFLOOKLIKEANOSHOW

**rickikardashian** (10): Straight vibez

**rhyneston3** (9): I love the dreamy ethereal vibes this song gives off

**hikkaru** (8): it's a little bit too dreary for my liking but posty always brings the ridiculously catchy hooks [2]

**sbb618** (7.5): This is the song that fueled my initial dislike of Post Malone. It's grown on me since.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Never really liked this Post song much. I’ve always found it kinda boring.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): A lullaby entitled “Psycho” that...works, surpassingly.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): Probably one of my least favorite Post Malone singles, but fun nonetheless.

**radiofan15** (6.9): Posty can be either amazingly chill or generic yet chill...

**915BEAST** (6): way to overplayed

**silentev** (6): This is barely better than the other Malone song; the echoey-slide sound behind the beat is nice but I really just do not like the overuse of autotune.

**skargardin** (6): I honestly forgot this song existed. When I saw Psycho on this list I was like "who the fuck is this" but then it hit me. Guess it really is that forgettable oop

**steelstepladder** (6): Solid enough I guess

**vayyiqra** (6): Oh great, another mid and sort of boring mumble-rap song. I am very glad I missed this trend while I was stanning obscure art-hipster white girls for the latter half of this decade.

**waluigiest** (6): fully didn’t know this song and was expecting Ava Max for a few seconds

**ditacarlita** (5): this sucks

**slimboyfriend** (5): "chain so stanky"

**runaway3212** (4.5): Post Malone at his most bored and tired

**camerinian** (4): This has got to be the most aggressively meh song to go number one in years. Like, ya know, who gives a shit? It's not a banger, but it's too much of a flex song to be a good vibe song, but the flexing is boring as shit, and the flow of the song is such a monotone throughout, it goes nowhere.

**twat\_brained** (4): stream Sweet but Psycho

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (2.5): Stream Psycho Killer by Talking Heads

**bespectacIed** (2): i think i hate post malone

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this is like a textbook version of a bad post malone song

**jackisboredtoday** (1): Post’s worst hit… and that’s rally saying something given how hit or miss he can be imo. It has no energy or way to stand out and yet somehow I still can’t stand hearing it

**MrSwearword** (1): Psychos make good music, which you don't

I think it’s so funny when singers change “fuck” into “love”, because it gives the song such a different spin. Akon is such a romantic and passionate man that the first thing that pops into his mind when he sees a woman grinding on a pole is: “I wanna love you.” And somehow, she already knows that, what a chemistry. At least the uncensored version, while dirty, is more coherent. Also a candidate for my hot sex playlist.

**tk note:** this is too sparse to be sexy, i disagree with its inclusion on a sex playlist

---

**1998tweety** (10): Bop, we stan Akon a king who worked with Wonder Girls. Thank God for a song with an actual hook.

**radiofan15** (10): I forgot how much of a classic this was... Akon sounds amazingly vivid here, and Snoop delivers not exactly the brightest bars but his flow and presence are really welcome.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): enrique iglesias tonight (i’m fuck-/lov-ing you) teas

**runaway3212** (8.5): Way better than I remembered

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): If y'all wondering what Akon is up to these days please search him up on your favorite streaming platform and I promise you'll be surprised.

**poppinmmolly** (8): I was obsessed with this song in 8th grade

**rhyneston3** (8): I didn’t know this had a clean version… Also if Smack That had hit number 1 it would have gotten my 11

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Akon? More like Icon.

**sailormunelune** (7): making the explicit version of this was... a choice

**skargardin** (7): Come back Akon we miss you

**vayyiqra** (7): I kind of love the very specific microgenre of "sad rap songs about first being horny for, then falling in love with a stripper" and I have no idea why

**rotating3Dtext** (6.8): I LOST IT at snoop dogg describing the girl having sex with him

**sbb618** (6.5): That first title drop was...unexpected

**bespectacIed** (6): Aside from that shocker lyric, this wasn't that good of a song, snoop's verses boring as hell

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): There’s something off-putting about Akon’s whiny delivery, like some last call lothario trying to get you into the back of his leased M3 at 3:00 AM.

**letsallpoo** (6): what the fuck am i listening to

**waluigiest** (6): we collectively know that “love you” and “fuck you” are not synonyms right????

**slur in username** (5.3): This is an incredibly stupid song but I don’t mind it.

**twat\_brained** (5.3): i would sing the chorus to this when i was 8 and i had no idea the explicit version existed until i searched it on youtube looooooool

**eigensheep** (5): One of the few songs where the censored version is significantly better

**ignitethephoenix** (5): idk if I’m suppose to listen to the clean version or not but I’m listening to the explicit version and it’s giving me Enrique Inglesias “Tonight im fucking you vibes”

**CarlieScion** (4): snakes manifested in my home bc of this song

**fishingfor8** (4): well I dont akon

**rsmitty99** (4): God I could never STAND Akon

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4): I’m sorry but I can’t stand Akon’s voice.

**camerinian** (2): What the fuck was this song always so slimy

**steelstepladder** (2): Aw shit I forgot about how bad this one was

**MrSwearword** (1): I WANNA FUCK YOU...up with a brick for reminding me this shit exists

**silentev** (0): I wanna stop listening to this song; Snoop doesn’t even sound like he’s on the same song with his verses.

I don’t mind innuendos and sexual wordplays but this song felt a bit monotone and doesn’t have a lot of replay value to me. It does have some funny lines though like when Lil Wayne says his girl wears her hair back like his, so I see the appeal. It also reminded that I took a lollipop from a jar before leaving the restaurant I had dinner in yesterday so thanks Weezy.

**tk note:** if this rate was hosted on /r/hiphopheads then this would be way higher because it's arguably super influential and holds up super well? like this could easily be a hit today by like Young Thug or Lil Baby

**1998tweety** (8.5): King, Mika outsold though

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Licking on a lollipop rn for the first time in years. I've been missing out.

**rhyneston3** (8): This is really Lil Wayne’s only number 1 as lead artist?? Smh we did him dirty

**runaway3212** (8): Just great

**sbb618** (7.5): I never got why this was the Lil Wayne song that blew up. And why is it five minutes long?

**vayyiqra** (7): Even though I don't listen to hip-hop (I already mentioned how painfully white I am) sometimes random hip-hop songs get stuck in my head and this is one of them. It has this combo of a really serious and kind of dark-sounding instrumental with absolutely ridiculous lyrics that I find funny and kind of endearing. Also, what was it with late 2000s rappers and using words with the syllable "urr" a lot?

**waluigiest** (7): I’m not sure if I like this somewhat uncomfortable song, but I definitely like “make her wanna lick the (w)rapper”

**rsmitty99** (6.5): Five seconds in: "No homo" sigh

**camerinian** (6): It's got a way better beat and probably better lines than most of the club tracks on here, but shit if there was ever a song that did not need to be five minutes long

**frogaranaman** (6): since this is on the Carter III I will use this space to say Mona Lisa on the Carter V should have gone #1

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I have never really liked this song a ton it’s just meh to me outside the chorus.

**silentev** (6): Is there a reason why Lil Wayne has to rely on autotune that much? It stands out so much that it detracts from the listening experience every time.

**slimboyfriend** (6): Very vanilla for a Wayne song :/

**steelstepladder** (6): Of the three candy based number one hits this is probably the best. That bar is LOW though

**bespectacIed** (5): rip static major

**agentofscranton** (4): can’t even be the best song in this rate centered around lollipops as a metaphor for dicks - also that fuckin’ no homo at the beginning, fuckin’ give me strength

**anothertown** (4): https://youtu.be/RPX44xvUmFA

**ditacarlita** (4): absolute crap

**eigensheep** (4): Would've done better if the first line of the song wasn't "no homo"

**MrSwearword** (4): Lil Wayne has done far, far worse

**rickikardashian** (4): Laffy Taffy could have been rated instead of this ngl

**twat\_brained** (4): I think we can all collectively shoulder the blame on Weezy for influencing the rap trend of just sounding damn near incoherent on their songs with also just generally unlistenable vocals. Since Static is no longer with us I'll leave him off the hook.

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.5): Too skeevy for me, and I normally love skeevy.

**ImADudeDuh** (1): man I hate this song and I hate lil wayne's voice

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (1): I can’t stand Lil Wayne’s rapping style

This sub ain’t straight and it shows. I think this is the last good song Eminem released because I certainly didn’t like any release of his past 2014. Rihanna complements Eminem’s voice pretty well and although I do agree that the chorus makes the song, as many have said, I don’t think I would listen to this without Eminem’s verses. I think the song works because both are part of it, but according to the score, many disagree.

**tk note:** my zero! so fucking corny, writing a song around "i'm friends with the monster that's under my bed" feels like something a YouTuber turned pop girl should do, NOT two S-tier pop stars. I'm not even an Eminem fan but I'm offended by how much of a sell out this is.

---

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I'm giving this a ten because KING Jon Bellion won a grammy for this song.

**skargardin** (10): Straight up amazing pop song, miss Bebe made some strong points with this hook

**1998tweety** (9): Bebuddha Rexhallah ate here. Em's verses are kind of trash here not gonna lie, thankfully Rih saved the chorus (although Bebe would've been better honestly).

**\_wailordfan** (9): Icon https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q26EhYwQvMg

**frogaranaman** (9): Rihanna yelling “well that’s not fair” is me to my professor telling me I can’t get excused for hw that I missed for being deathly sick for a week and a half

**sbb618** (9): The hook is still great, but Eminem's verses are lacking this time around.

**silentev** (9): Eminem and Rihanna really were onto something with the way their voices blend together and should just make an entire album together like why didn’t we get that?

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): The better Em/Rih collab tbh

**ditacarlita** (8.5): the superior eminem and rihanna single

**mms82** (8): A K-Mart version of LTWYL. Worse in every way, but Love the Way You Lie is so good that this song still merits a good score even just being a way worse version

**rickikardashian** (8): The only thing I think about when I hear this song is that \[vine for that kid moving his hips to a remix of this song](https://youtu.be/gPe7BkHvVS0). Anyway, shout-out to Bebe Rexha

**slur in username** (7.8): Bebe Rexha really got screwed over here. Wrote the song for her own album and ends up on someone else’s album whilst getting replaced on the chorus.

**runaway3212** (7.5): I don't know for sure if I like this song or just the idea of the song, but whatever

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Not quite as iconic as LTWYL. Still a decent listen though. Shoutout to my boy Jon Bellion for writing the hook too :)

**twat\_brained** (7.4): this is far stronger than LTWYL but I get verbal whiplash from Eminem's flow switching

**rsmitty99** (7): Poor Man's Love The Way you Lie

**steelstepladder** (7): Kinda weird to see this song as big as it was

**TCHALLA1966** (7): Jon Bellion wrote on this song so we stan that but otherwise meh

**915BEAST** (6): em really didn’t have it on this one, + 1 for the “lose yourself” reference

**CarlieScion** (6): chorus big good, mediocre eminem

**Roxieloxie** (6): why did rihanna do so many songs with mnm, and why have i never heard his verses on said songs

**vayyiqra** (6): I've never heard this song in my life, I'm pretty sure. Maybe that's because I didn't care about Rihanna or Eminem past 2007, or maybe it was because I was just coming out of a severe depressive episode at this time in my life. Either way, it has a good instrumental and Rihanna's part is alright. I know this is a Popheads cliché but Eminem's rapping doesn't add anything to it. That isn't even me being "men singing bad" or "rap features bad" like Popheads always does; I just think he's wasted on this. This is a weird song and I'm not sure what it's trying to say. It could grow on me, but it feels a little edgy and fake woke for now.

**camerinian** (5): Ugh I haven't listened to this song in a long time, and just now I'm finding stuff I really like, but I also hate the shit I didn't like in 2013 even more now. Eminem is basically saying the same one thought in slightly different ways for the first two verses, and holy shit that second verse is fucking annoying, but the last verse is actually quite sweet and satisfying, and would be a great closer if the shit before it wasn't a total nothing. The hook is actually really strong and well delivered too, but it's immediately undercut by that fucking WA-OO bit that doesn't fit the tone at all. Basically what I'm saying is I blame Bebe Rexha for everything.

**hikkaru** (5): always thought this was a Rihanna song as opposed to Eminem, and that says a lot. the only reason this has an okay score is Rih's chorus [2]

**rhyneston3** (5): The way less hot version of its superior sibling love the way you lie

**anothertown** (4): https://youtu.be/Q26EhYwQvMg

**waluigiest** (4): how many times do we have to tell you two to stop collaborating

**JustinJSrisuk** (3.5): Not even Rih-Rih can save this awful, cheap-sounding dreck.

**bespectacIed** (3): what an awful, corny set of verses from Em. Without Bebe's Rih's verse this song would be unbearable

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (3): eminem shouldn’t be allowed to make music anymore

**hagagaag** (2): Eminem stop please

**eigensheep** (1): T.I. isn't in the rate, but both Eminem/Rihanna songs about abusive relationships are. Come on now.

**MrSwearword** (1): garbage

**radiofan15** (0): Miss Fenty Beauty and Mr. Mathers have made four collaboration so far, and only one (Love the Way You Lie) is good in any way, the next two are forgettable and this one, the last one so far, is dreadful in every possible way, with the millennial whoop (courtesy of a Eminem who stole this song from Bebe Rexha and have Rihanna record over her vocals while keeping her chorus) ruining any kind of impact this song's subject matter might have, and Em himself spouting an analysis of his own fame with the depth of a Sesame Street episode ("Call me crazy, but I have this vision // one day that I'll walk among you a regular civilian, until then, drums get killed and I'm comin' straight at MC's") with a Rihanna hook that sounds as lifeless as the production of the song. Eminem might have lazier songs, but none of them are as big of a failure as this one.

As a second-language English speaker I was confused by the word *tailfeather* at first. I then discovered it means butt, which was sort of on the nose, but I had to google it anyway, which says a lot. I didn’t know this song prior this rate but I thought it was pretty fun. Its main problem perhaps is that it’s pretty much your average club song of the early 2000’s but it's not memorable compared to other club songs of the era. Those sirens are cool though.

---

**CarlieScion** (10): this bops

**ExtraEater** (10): the siren really takes this to a whole new level

**rsmitty99** (10): "I like the cocky bowlegged ones. Black, white and Dominicans, Hispanics and Asians" Nelly was pushing for diversity before it was cool.

**rickikardashian** (9.2): "Is your mama half reindeer" is the fucking weirdest way I've heard someone say a girl has a huge butt

**itsabop (hals)** (9): Haven't heard in years

**1998tweety** (8): Bop

**agentofscranton** (8): chicken little outsold

**bespectacIed** (8): bop

**frogaranaman** (8): why is the title of this song like a fucking old timey englishman? lmao. ah yes, shake thine tailfeather, mistress, I am oh so envelouped by the majesty of thine assets that I must bequither and hath one’s behind rhomboused onto my pelvis region

**rhyneston3** (8): Oh this is fun! Just a good party song

**skargardin** (8): This bangs

**TCHALLA1966** (8): well this was the ultimate throwback

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): Another song that’s longer than it should be even if it bops

**anothertown** (7): ok go off chicken little!

**eigensheep** (7): Higher than it deserves. The hook is really carrying everything else here.

**Roxieloxie** (7): another choice but it kinda slaps

**sbb618** (7): Why was the music of the 2000s so focused on the club

**slimboyfriend** (7): Fine, but ripped off the Cheetah Girls song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): This is so aggressively 2000s it's scaring me.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): One of the lesser, more forgettable of Nelly’s party jams, it really boggles the mind that this went to #1 on the Billboard Hot 100 while the far-superior Ride Wit Me only reached #3.

**steelstepladder** (6.5): Not the best song about booty shaking on here but still strong

**jackisboredtoday** (6): Murphy Lee really just came and went & was never heard from again

**MrSwearword** (6): I mean it's not good but the production isn't quite as dated as I remember. Still, Nelly has better songs to his name.

**silentev** (6): This is one catchy glorified catcall.

**waluigiest** (6): Nelly really owned us back then, huh? This is messy but kind of fun

**cremeebrulee** (5): Pretty forgettable compared to some other songs here

**runaway3212** (5): This songs really gets worse the longer it goes on

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): Honestly all these gangsta rap songs sound the same to me.

**awhile2** (4): ok how did this make the rate but laffy taffy didnt. cheetah girls did it better

**camerinian** (4): That beat is massively banging to a huge degree, but I think these dudes have one brain between the three of them so

**vayyiqra** (4): I like a thicc booty as much as any rapper but this is boring

**fishingfor8** (3): haha wtf no wonder people forgot this.

**ImADudeDuh** (3): the cheetah girls MASSIVELY outpeaked on the Chicken Little soundtrack

**twat\_brained** (3): I heard Nelly's voice and was confused then I saw he and Diddy are credited as featured artists. Also I think everybody who's heard this song knows Murphy would've been an even bigger nobody if they weren't. I swear I never heard this in the early 2000s yet I vividly remember the other early 2000s songs in this rate even as a kid. I think this goes to show how utterly forgettable this was

**mms82** (1.5): tough to find songs that sound worse than this, can't really say anything about positive. Best left in the early aughts

**radiofan15** (1): And we dare to complain when Drake and X top the charts!

50 Cent can be romantic-ish, can you believe it? I thought this song was cute to a certain extent, and also sort of sad because of its music video. I feel like this song might have done better on hhh because they can relate to the subject matter better, considering the levels of heterosexuality.

---

**waluigiest** (10): a nostalgic rap about unconditional love this truly hits me

**fishingfor8** (9): one of the few 50 cent songs I love, buuuut 50 is a POS so it's not a ten.

**runaway3212** (8.5): Good rapping and good lyrics just make a good song

**ditacarlita** (8): okay fiddy's debut album is so hot

**skargardin** (8): this was pretty good but i don't think I've heard it before? Lowkey shookt

**rickikardashian** (7.9): imagine playing 21 questions expecting the dude to ask you "are u a virgin ahaha😜" and instead he asks you if you would still love him if he was sentenced 25 years to jail. I feel like that's a red flag

**twat\_brained** (7.9): rest in peace, Nate Dogg. It's a shame you didn't have lead billing on this but at least we can remember you through this #1, which is actually rather a good effort from these two.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): That said, the remarkable narrative of 50 Cent’s life lends quite a bit of weight to the song 21 Questions, a track from the soundtrack to Get Rich or Die Tryin’, 50’s hagiographic starring vehicle. Framed as a series of questions asked by a man to his lover about what she would do if he were to face incarceration, it’s a surprisingly effective look into the daily realities of a “ride or die” relationship, one on which one member might be forcibly taken out of the picture for years at a time.

**1998tweety** (7): The beat is kind of annoying

**ImADudeDuh** (7): a fun game

**MrSwearword** (7): didn't remember this until playing, but this is less a hop hop song and more a background for a TV special of the Maxim Hot 100 on either E! or VH1

**rhyneston3** (7): How do I get sent to the jail in the video

**sbb618** (7): The reverse of some earlier ones, in that the production is really good, but the lyrics are lacking. Also RIP Nate Dogg, one of my top three favorite Doggs

**Roxieloxie** (6.7): this is a choice

**hikkaru** (6.5): less iconic than the #1 right before this

**itsabop (hals)** (6.5): Not as big a bop as In Da Club

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): “i love you like a fat kid loves cake”

**awhile2** (6): rip to nate dogg i had to regulate

**camerinian** (6): Oh god I miss Nate Dogg so much. What a legend on the hooks. The problem is that 50 Cent

**frogaranaman** (6): question 1 - are you a virgin

**ignitethephoenix** (6): kinda boring although remember that 21 question game? That’s a good game and this song reminded me of that

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): A lot of questionable lines on this one lol.

**slur in username** (5.8): The song itself sounds fine but I’ve never liked hearing people ask stupid, irrelevant hypothetical questions. Reminds me of Locked Away by R City and Adam Levine from a few years ago.

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Every 50 Cent song sounds like a parody of a 50 Cent song

**silentev** (5): This song isn’t as romantic as you think.

**CarlieScion** (4): somebody tell 50 cent to emote

**steelstepladder** (4): I love Nate Dogg but this is Fifty at his biggest case of missed potential

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4): Am I the only one who hears how out of time the guitar is with the rest of the beat or am going crazy. Also fuck 50 cent again.

**vayyiqra** (2): I would pay at least $3.50 to never have to hear 50 Cent's mumbly voice and awful lyrics again

**radiofan15** (1): Mediocrity at its finest... this was a Number 1 hit? I HAVE TO LAUGH

Some people justified their score by saying that Drake has better songs in his discography, and I agree. While its silly and stupidly relatable lyrics makes the song a fun listen to pass the time, this track does feel a manufactured piece of work designed to be cut into pieces to be part of everyone’s captions. *That* famous line single-handedly made it the hit it was, it’s undeniable. However, whenever this song is playing, I just can’t help myself but scream its lyrics because we all need some carefree tunes in our life, and this is one of those.

**tk note:** this is one of those songs that feels so obviously like a smash hit that it was forgotten pretty much instantly after its run on the charts. in comparison, Nice For What and In My Feelings just have much more unique aspects that will help them stand the test of time in comparison to this.

---

**static\_int\_husp** (10): The best Drake single in 2019.

**rickikardashian** (9): "I only love my bed and my mama, I'm sorry" and "Imagine if I never met the broskis" are for frat dudes what "Darling I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream" was for sorority girls

**sbb618** (9): The fact that a song with literally two repeated chords was #1 for eleven weeks says a lot about just how popular Drake is. Or maybe it's that people love yelling out "She say do you love me, I tell her only partly". Let's say 50/50.

**1998tweety** (8.5): A cute lil bop. Got some iconic lines and the beat is nice.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): It’s okay but amongst these other songs is not groundbreaking or that fun.

**silentev** (8.5): I relate to Drake because I also only love my bed and my momma, and this song.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): One of the most iconic lines of the decade, and for how overplayed it was, it hasn't even gotten that annoying.

**CarlieScion** (8): b i g bop

**frogaranaman** (8): damn bitch being poor 😍

**rhyneston3** (8): Drake has better songs, but he also has much much worse songs

**waluigiest** (8): she say do you love me I tell her im monky

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): IMAGINE IF I NEVER MET THE BROSKIES

**slur in username** (7.7): This song originally featured Trippie Redd but got removed because he leaked a snippet of it. He fucked up big time and it’s for the best, this song would be a lot better without Trippie on it.

**radiofan15** (7.5): Drake has done BETTER than this... it's not bad but it's definitely overplayed!

**915BEAST** (7): not as obnoxious as In My feelings

**cremeebrulee** (7): Other than the bed and momma line, this song is pretty dry

**Roxieloxie** (7): fuck drake but I love this music video for this song

**\_wailordfan** (6.5): Also not the best Drake song here

**runaway3212** (6): Drake can be good, Drake can be bad, but most of the time Drake is very middle of the road.

**vayyiqra** (6): Ozone, or trioxygen, is an inorganic molecule with the chemical formula O3. It is a pale blue gas with a distinctively pungent smell. It is an allotrope of oxygen that is much less stable than the diatomic allotrope O2, breaking down in the lower atmosphere to O2 (dioxygen). Ozone is formed from dioxygen by the action of ultraviolet light (UV) and electrical discharges within the Earth's atmosphere. It is present in very low concentrations throughout the latter, with its highest concentration high in the ozone layer of the stratosphere, which absorbs most of the Sun's ultraviolet (UV) radiation. Ozone's odour is reminiscent of chlorine, and detectable by many people at concentrations of as little as 0.1 ppm in air. Ozone's O3 structure was determined in 1865. The  molecule was later proven to have a bent structure and to be diamagnetic. In standard conditions, ozone is a pale blue gas that condenses at progressively cryogenic temperatures to a dark blue liquid and finally a violet-black solid. Ozone's instability with regard to more common dioxygen is such that both concentrated gas and liquid ozone may decompose explosively at elevated temperatures or fast warming to the boiling point.[5] It is therefore used commercially only in low concentrations. Ozone is a powerful oxidant (far more so than dioxygen) and has many industrial and consumer applications related to oxidation. This same high oxidizing potential, however, causes ozone to damage mucous and respiratory tissues in animals, and also tissues in plants, above concentrations of about 0.1 ppm. While this makes ozone a potent respiratory hazard and pollutant near ground level, a higher concentration in the ozone layer (from two to eight ppm) is beneficial, preventing damaging UV light from reaching the Earth's surface.

**twat\_brained** (5.6): …is this even a song? This just sounds like ad-libs upon ad-libs and nonsequiturs save for Drizzy's verse in the middle. Not really much else going on here. And Drake sounds so over it here. An embarrassing year-end #1

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5.5): Crazy how this song was unavoidable for the first half of 2018 and yet I don’t think I’ve heard it once this year.

**skargardin** (5): In hindsight this is a disposable Drake song

**jackisboredtoday** (4): even as someone who likes a lot of drake songs… this is so monotone & sounds like crap

**bespectacIed** (3): god I hate this so much, I couldn't think of a more cringey song to become a worldwide hit

**camerinian** (3): The fact that this, an autopilot brag rap with one decent line by an artist who is easily at a net negative when it comes to quality tracks, was the biggest song of 2018 says more about the cultural wasteland of that year than anything else ever could

**JustinJSrisuk** (3): ZZZzzzzzzZZZzzzzzz

**poppinmmolly** (3): why do people like this song it's bad

**steelstepladder** (3): If only there was a Justin Bieber and Ed Sheeran song to describe how I feel about this song

**CreepyMannequin** (2): “I feel good sometimes I don’t” - biggest rapper of the 2010s

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i sleep.

**MrSwearword** (1): ...better include smiting you for the terrible music you've made, Drake

This song is sort of the epitome of the common trope of 2000s music: just 3+ simple minutes of metaphors about shaking butts. Every artist at that time made a strip club anthem at some point and this is Ludacris and Pharrell’s. While the beat is cool, there are some lines in here that are sort of try-hard sexy, which makes them not that sexy. I can say that as a former swimmer, using strokes to talk about sexual positions baffled me a little bit. I think there’s better ways to ask someone to hook up with bringing up dick swimming.

---

**anothertown** (10): just be thankful that pharrell gave you something to bump to!!

**MrSwearword** (10): Ludacris and Pharrell are the Tekken Tag Tournament pair you never knew you needed <3

**1998tweety** (8): Ludaking periodt

**frogaranaman** (8): listens to the intro and bitches say that Sweetener isn’t good 🙄

**ignitethephoenix** (8): a bop but “swimming on the penis?” Really? lil Wayne did it better with “drown in the pussy and swim to the butt”

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): When Pharrell does his thing, man he does his thing.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): I remember getting back into this song after seeing it in The Big Short & it really does mark its era so well

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): Classic strip club anthem; also, Luda screaming “PENIS” is something I didn’t know that I needed in my life.

**runaway3212** (7.5): I feel really bad for liking this

**silentev** (7.5): I will never ever forgive Ludacris for rhyming penis with genius, even over that great Pharrell beat.

**slur in username** (7.4): Ludacris’s pick up lines are so stupid but hilarious.

**rhyneston3** (7): I do not remember Pharrell being in this song

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6.5): Ok but why does the beginning of this song sound like a horror movie soundtrack. Also “Let me give you swimming lessons on the penis” might be one of the worst lyrics I ever heard.

**twat\_brained** (6.5): "lemme give you some swimming lessons on the PENIS" okay who the hell leads imagination just go right on the nose. well, not the nose but… well you get it.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): why does the intro sound like that dramatic sound effect that 2013 vines always used

**Roxieloxie** (6): this is a train wreck

**vayyiqra** (6): oh look it's horny 2000s rap song #487334

**waluigiest** (6): the beginning of this is fuckin baroque. The rest has some major questionable moments

**sbb618** (5.5): Unpopular opinion: I don't really like The Neptunes. I think that most of their beats are just way too busy, they're super clunky and jumbled, and in the end they take away from the song a lot more than they add to it. Sure, that fits the style of music rappers were putting out, but is that a good thing? Plus, "Lemme give you some swimming lessons on the PE-NIS" may be the worst line of all time.

**bespectacIed** (5): Great production as yoosh for the neptunes but the lyrics are meh. Shake it like a polaroid >> shake your money maker

**skargardin** (5): Never heard of this but Pharrell really made this a dud, sad to say.

**steelstepladder** (5): Not one of Luda's stronger songs. What's Your Fantasy couldn't have hit number one?

**radiofan15** (4.2): God the intro is a SERVE and a HALF but what comes after is... not it.

**camerinian** (4): Holy shit could you imagine a song built around that intro???? That would be fucking wild, but no, regular ol ass anthem, yawn

**TCHALLA1966** (4): This went #1? Hmmmm

A latino rapper saying the n-word? +10 controversy points. A latino rapper saying the n-word right next to a homophobic slur? Double points. Us making people rate this song in a mostly gay space? Triple points. This is really a product of its time. I have to say, the delivery is not bad and the beat is cool but again, this track doesn’t seem to offer much other than generic memories of a time where men would just pull up their pants and do the rockaway. #leanbackthursday

**tk note:** Remy Ma was in this rate and Nicki Minaj wasn't. It feels right.

---

**twat\_brained** (10): ah yes, i remember this slapping when i was 7

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Great beat, greater bars. Gave Remy, who is the best part of the song, a number 1, which is difficult to get, not a certain qorl from Trinidad has that to her credit

**radiofan15** (9.5): Onika Petty-Maraj is pressed that the Marlboro Lights-sounding lady has a number one hit and she doesn't!

**rhyneston3** (9): Wow Remy really ate her verse

**1998tweety** (8.5): FREE REMY. She ate here.

**anothertown** (8): go off remy!

**frogaranaman** (8): me when I’m in the classroom and cannot focus and want something to do with my chair

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): The production is pretty sick but I’m just not feeling it fully

**ImADudeDuh** (7): mexicans saying the n word.........

**MrSwearword** (7): does well in a pinch and Remy Ma has talent but do we care about this song much? NO

**rsmitty99** (7): He said Faggot. Automatic -3. Otherwise good song

**runaway3212** (7): Weirdly great

**vayyiqra** (7): I kind of like the vaguely Middle Eastern sample and Remy Ma's verse

**sbb618** (6.5): Remy Ma is fine, I guess, but shut up about your pants already

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6.5): Beat absolutely fucks but I really don't care about anyone in this song.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): Remy’s verse is great, the rest is ok i guess

**slur in username** (6.1): Does this count as a dance move? You literally just lean your back.

**camerinian** (6): What the fuck is it with producers in this era making really fucking sick intros and then totally dropping it out for some minimalist tapping bullshit???? I'm so glad we're out of the cocktease era. Track's fine tho

**agentofscranton** (5.5): shether should've been number one

**steelstepladder** (5): A good song brought down by boring production

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): This sure is a song

**JustinJSrisuk** (4): Just think, if this song didn’t hit number one then perhaps DJ Khaled would’ve been relegated to the dustbin of history.

**waluigiest** (3): tbh it feels like nothing is said

**rickikardashian** (1): I know times are different but if you're using "faggot" in your rap song, the song is shit in my book. anyway, lol @ remy ma having a #1 before Nicki

**silentev** (1): I want to lean back until I can fall over and give myself a concussion from how annoying this song is.

Desiigner’s activism was remarkable. Making a song about an endangered species to make people aware of its poor life conditions? Outstanding. And pandas stopped being at risk in 2016, the same year this song was released, it’s not a coincidence. Jokes aside, this is one of the most memorable mumble rap/trap songs and he was only 18 when it topped the chart. I like the song but apparently some people here seem to enjoy only songs spoken with a standard white American accent unfortunately.

---

**frogaranaman** (10): mannnn fuck GOOD Music why they have to do Desiigner dirty like that, because they can’t understand a word he can say? the fuck? damn I honestly wish more rappers would take that route, for example Kanye so we wouldn’t have to deal with all the shit he spews out,

**mms82** (10): so unbelievably hype. Wish Desiigner had another hit

**waluigiest** (10): this is so fucking hype. I feel like I’ll get made fun of if I play it at parties in 2019 but WOW goes off. I always think of the “most iconic bridges” meme

**runaway3212** (9.5): Amazing, never bores even though it is basically the same thing over and over.

**slur in username** (9.1): A lot of people were comparing Desiigner with Future when he blew up, mostly for mumbling the words. Those people are right, expect for the fact that this is easily better than anything Future has ever been in.

**bespectacIed** (9): Sad how Desiigner fell off hard, this was ridiculously huge hit, and it's such a bop

**Roxieloxie** (8.9): is this a quality song, no, dose anyone know any of the words past ' i got broads in atlanuh" , no, however i cant let the white acoustic covers of this song wins so i have to inform you, this song slaps

**1998tweety** (8.5): Was never a huge fan of this but it's much better than a lot of the songs in this rate.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Father Stretch My Hole and Pt. 2 deserved this song's success...

**sbb618** (8): And we take a hard left turn into trap.

**twat\_brained** (7.9): Wait what the hell is he saying at the end of the second verse? Also what the hell happened to Desiigner? How did we end up losing him to talentless hacks like Lil Pump, Lil Xan and 6ix9ine? Rap is going down the fucking tube

**camerinian** (7.5): ok shit those ad libs still go way, way harder than they have any right to

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): This song is catchy but idk if it’s worthy of being a number 1 hit.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Desiigner. Relevant. What a time.

**ditacarlita** (7): this is wildly catchy

**hikkaru** (7): you can really hear the turning point in the general sound of these #1s here

**vayyiqra** (7): panda panda panda I like this as a meme, but nothing more nvm I unironically like this song, although the random "rrrrrrrrrrah!" adlibs are kind of weird. I thought we all had an unspoken agreement to leave those back in 2008?

**915BEAST** (6): I don’t hate this song but I don’t love it

**ImADudeDuh** (6): /u/gannade

**steelstepladder** (6): I always had this feeling that Desiigner deserved better. Maybe not as a lead artist or anything but why hasn't he done more guest hooks?

**JustinJSrisuk** (5.5): Has anyone heard from Desiigner recently? Is he doing okay? Hope he saved his money.

**rhyneston3** (5): I hated this song when it first came out. It has grown on me though (like a rash)

**slimboyfriend** (5): It's better as a Kanye song

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): You know how Mr. Brightside has the same verse repeated twice but no one really cares because of how hard it slaps? This song is not Mr. Brightside.

**anothertown** (4): "...................penda..............." - my intrusive thoughts

**poppinmmolly** (3): why did people like this?? it doesn't do anything.

**rsmitty99** (3): Jesus Christ

**static\_int\_husp** (3): Father Strech My Hands is the way better version of this song

**silentev** (1.5): I have never heard this song and to be told I am hearing the hottest song with the hottest beats really turned me off and after four minutes yeah I that was not the hottest beat nor was it the hottest song. Why does he keep saying Panda?!

Again, like many other songs in this rate, this was driven to the top by memes, both for its chorus and Lil Uzi’s verse. It was around the time I was trying to get more into hip-hop music, and I remember I would be forcing myself to like this but there were, and there still are, some parts of this that makes it… questionable. Despite the several ad-libs, the beat feels empty at parts, and in its 5 minutes of length, it’s interesting how they weren’t able to fit all the Migos here. It took me some time to learn that there were 3 of them. At least Uzi’s YAH’s make me cackle.

---

**awhile2** (10): uzi's verse on here is the most pivotal moment in hip-hop this decade

**radiofan15** (10): This song called me a f*ggot and i'm grateful for it.

**mms82** (9.5): still the Migos best song

**Roxieloxie** (9): this song brought us some good memes,, i stan

**slimboyfriend** (9): Thank god migos entered my life

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): A moment in history tbh.

**sbb618** (8.5): In the immortal words of Mr. Kirshnik Ball, "doilooliawuleffoffbadmbooji?"

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I think song is a good showcase of what they are musically however I don’t think it’s one of their best (I prefer Walk It Talk It and Stir Fry those songs deserved to be number 1s from them)

**runaway3212** (8): Great, though never better than that

**steelstepladder** (8): I respect it as the moment trap really took over

**waluigiest** (8): huge debate with my friends is whether it’s cooking up dope in the “crock pot pot” (the pot that goes in the crock pot) or “crock pot (pot!)” (where it’s repeated for emphasis)

**1998tweety** (7): I never got the appeal of this, also this is my first time actually hearing this in full lmao.

**915BEAST** (7): Stir fry was better

**camerinian** (6): If this song was just the hook and the start of Uzi's verse on a loop, it would genuinely be a much better song

**ditacarlita** (6): wtf is this and how did it get number one

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): Forgettable verses redeemed only by earwormy ad-libbed interjections.

**twat\_brained** (6): "national smash day?" lol. appropriating drag race? not into it. using a lesbian slur? not fucking it. Uzi's verse is okay but I don't think this really seems as good as Migos fans want it to be. It reminds me why I don't really like where rap is headed if these lyrics are at its forefront

**vayyiqra** (6): Carl Marks said being boujee is bad and it's a good thing absolutely nobody died from trying to put his ideas into practice, certainly not tens of millions

**fishingfor8** (5): rain drop drop top I dont get the migos

**frogaranaman** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9MZJoW0v6A

**hikkaru** (5): too long, too dreary

**ImADudeDuh** (5): its ok and thats it

**rhyneston3** (5): Was never a really big fan of this one, and 2/3 of Migos seem like terrible people (Takeoff is fine)

**rsmitty99** (5): I don't know, y'all. The continuous hype man shout after every fucking line

**silentev** (5): I mean the lyrics are fun, but I don’t think it’s wise to cook dope in a crock-pot, regardless of how boujee you are.

**slur in username** (4.1): YAH YAH YAH YAH YAH

**CreepyMannequin** (4): Lil Uzi Vert’s verse is one of the worst of all time but at least the production bops

**rickikardashian** (2): The song could have finished after "Raindrop, drop top…". This just has no business being this damn long

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (2): Why the fuck is this song almost 6 minutes long

**MrSwearword** (1): trash and awful

**skargardin** (1): Everything I despise about trap condensated into one song

ditacarlita: Overall I'm pleased with day one. The only song I think should be higher is Run It! but i was expecting low votes and I understand. Being Australian, a lot of these songs I had never heard and will happily never hear again.

TragicKingdom1: we didn't have room for every song that could be called "hip hop" so we made some cuts. that song flopped hard in the 2009 year-end rate earlier this year so we cut it
