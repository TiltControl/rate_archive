Also, two notes about the secret bonus rate:

1. There was confusion as to whether you could give a 0/11 which I didn't notice until last night so I changed all 11s to 10s and 0s to 1s in the interest of fairness.
2. Highest in the room will be revealed separately tomorrow because a lot of people only rated that song and none of the cast members.

The Scorpion era was driven by memes. Instagram was what made this particular song so huge. Some music outlets have called this a misunderstanding of New Orleans bounce but it was a massively popular summer bop in spite of any cultural implications. The car challenge was so popular that it concerned global authorities. In the Philippines, you could fined for doing it on public roads. Plus, asking your exes how they are doing through a song instead of calling them is an iconic Drake move.

---

**frogaranaman** (10): suddenly I’m white and wearing boat shoes

**radiofan15** (10): This song deserved better on the Songs of the Summer rate!

**vayyiqra** (10): I don't sabotage in rates, but I feel like I'm giving this such a high rating out of affirmative action. Popheads hates it and I think it deserves an A for effort. It's a unique and creative song, even though in terms of enjoyment it's really more like a 6-7 to me, with a catchy hook but that vocal sample of the woman yelling is incredibly annoying, and it's structurally just a very bizarre and messy song. But that's kind of why I like it? Idk. I'm still not streaming Scorpion though.

**1998tweety** (9.5): j-hope is a king stan him, City Girls are queen stan them, Drake ate a bit here too.

**silentev** (9): I can really see why so many people endangered their lives dancing outside of their cars to this song and because my name is similar to one mentioned and this was constantly sung at me, but I own it its fine.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): BANGERRRR

**bespectacIed** (8): I wanna hate it because of how annoyingly popular this was, but the City Girls sample just elevates this song. I am convinced Yung Miami's and God's voice are the same

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Cute but it’s not Drake’s best. It can be annoying if you aren’t in the right mood

**runaway3212** (8): A pretty good Drake song

**\_wailordfan** (7.5): overplay really hurt this one

**sbb618** (7.5): The catchy chorus and Atlanta sample help mask the fact that this isn't actually that good of a song

**slur in username** (7.3): Drake got humiliated by Pusha T, his son got exposed and there were rumours about him grooming underage women and he still winds up on top. This guy just can’t lose

**ImADudeDuh** (7): imagine giving this song an eleven, i HAVE to laugh

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): I can’t deny that I un-ironically enjoy the part of the chorus that goes “Kiki-do you love me...”

**rhyneston3** (7): At least we’re not rating the whole of scorpion

**rickikardashian** (7): the fact that the worst out of the 3 singles was the most successful one shows that humanity simply does not work. Also I have a theory that Drake paid famous people to do the In My Feelings challenge, because although I saw it happen, I just don't understand how that "challenge" blew up the way it did

**Roxieloxie** (7): dose drake love kiki though?

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): I’d probably like this more if i wasn’t so tired of Drake by the time it got huge

**camerinian** (6): "My favourite part of this song is the verses" and other things no person has ever said

**CarlieScion** (6): the worst big song from scorpion

**waluigiest** (6): this is a worse God’s Plan imo. Stream Lana Del Rey - In My Feelings instead

**anothertown** (5): (millie bobby brown voice) i am a..what do they call it? a flat-- i think they call it a flat earther. anyway.

**skargardin** (5): Still the same score as in the SOTS rate

**twat\_brained** (5): okay let's be real who the hell is out here trying to kill Drake? And whoever they are is there any chance in hell they could circumvent Drake's security team? He needs to drop this notion

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4.5): The In My Feelings challenge wasn't even that interesting

**sailormunelune** (4): I honestly cannot stand how whiny he sounds in the chorus

**steelstepladder** (3): It was ok then and ok now

**915BEAST** (2): Nothing is good about this

**static\_int\_husp** (2): One of my least favorite Drake songs ever. The chorus is whiny and the breakdown is just all over the place. I gave this a 0 in the Songs of the Summer rate earlier this year, but Drake is fortunate that two abusers are in this rate as well.

**MrSwearword** (1): NO DRAKE, KIKI RESPECTS HERSELF AND FUCKING HATES YOU

Here we have Wiz Khalifa's ode to his hometown Pittsburgh, which is represented by the colours black and yellow. Black and Yellow are rep'd on any item he owns: cars, clothes and jewels. I think it’s quite a nice song, not outstanding but something you can bop to in your car to feel cool. This is probably what old people think rap is like, whether that’s a good or a bad thing, you decide. Most sports fans would say bad.

---

**twat\_brained** (10): I was about to give this the same score as Thrift Shop but if Wiz can snap like this and I deem this on the same level as TS it would be remiss. Yeah. Uh-huh. I know what it is. A fucking smash single worthy of nothing less than a 10.

**bespectacIed** (9.5): Most instantly catchy song in the rate. Sad that wiz fell off

**ignitethephoenix** (9): fuck Pittsburgh teams but this song slaps

**radiofan15** (8.9): The official Gerald and Phoebe anthem...

**slur in username** (8.7): Historical moment in February 2011 when the bee society voted in a new national anthem after strong backlash towards Imma Be, the previous national anthem.

**mms82** (8.5): black and yellow G-Mix was better ngl

**sbb618** (8.5): This is a weird criticism, but I don't think it's believable when Wiz Khalifa brags about how many diamonds his watch has. I buy it from a ton of other artists, I just don't buy it from Wiz.

**eigensheep** (8): I really didn't expect this to hold up, but it does

**frogaranaman** (8): I’m a Packers fan so -2 for that

**gannade** (8): kind of a bop but FUCK THE STEELERS

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8): Wiz Khalifa. Hit. What a concept.

**vayyiqra** (8): Idk why, but this song gets stuck in my head a lot, and I have no idea what it's about but it sounds ominous and I really love the instrumental; but also what the fuck does black and yellow refer to; but also I don't want to know.

**runaway3212** (7.5): A really nice song

**1998tweety** (7): I don't see the appeal but at least it bops a little. The casual homophobia brings it down a little too.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Everything involving a bee after this song was made owes it a lot

**rhyneston3** (7): According to all known laws of aviation, there is no way a bee should be able to fly. Its wings are too small to get its fat little body off the ground. The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care what humans think is impossible. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Yellow, black. Ooh, black and yellow!

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (7): My friend and I made a Bee Movie amv to this song as a joke once and that's all you need to know.

**waluigiest** (7): this is so lasting tell me why I still think about it when I see a bumblebee or something

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): "No keys - push to start" is the weirdest flex in rap

**915BEAST** (6): why, that’s my only question

**camerinian** (6): This is quite the bop but tbh the remix with Snoop Dogg and T-Pain is so much better in every way, and you really realise that when listening to the verses that aren't the first one. Man's limited

**MrSwearword** (5): too boring for derision

**silentev** (4): I listened to this song so many times when this first came out and even now I still have no idea what it is or what this song is about? Bees?

**skargardin** (4): I'm sorry but this song annoys the hell out of me

**JustinJSrisuk** (3): Oh great, a song about three things I hate: Dodge Challengers, Football and Pittsburgh.

**steelstepladder** (3): Uh huh you know what it is, Mediocre Mediocre Mediocre Mediocre

**rsmitty99** (0): First off. I'm a Browns fan so fuck the Steelers. Second. I've always thought Wiz's voice was sooooo borrrrrrring.

Rockstar is one of Post Malone’s most successful songs and marked his first number one hit in the US. The song doesn’t bring anything new to the table as rappers have been comparing themselves to rock stars since forever, but I think the lo-fi vibe, while it could have been jarring, makes the song stand out to me. It’s like the beat was designed to be the soundtrack of weed sessions while hallucinating about being famous. It’s an anthem for the trap boys of the world, but this is a pop music forum, so...

**tk note:** this was a major grower for me, it's just soooo catchy and hype despite not being high energy by any means

---

**frogaranaman** (10): this is my favorite installment of “how many cars does 21 Savage have” series. in this episode: six

**mms82** (10): honestly still Post's best song. Strong contender for my 11

**radiofan15** (10): We love British icon 21 Savage and his character development with his 12-car garage.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Honestly pretty crazy that some people don't like this song. Definition of a banger.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): King of writing catchy hooks

**\_wailordfan** (9): There are two other post songs in this rate that are better

**sbb618** (8.5): It took a little bit for Post Malone to grow on me, and I think he finally has. But when Rockstar, Psycho, and Better Now were everywhere and you don't really like Post Malone, it's tough.

**915BEAST** (8): Posty and Savage at their best

**hikkaru** (8): it's a little bit too dreary for my liking but posty always brings the ridiculously catchy hooks

**twat\_brained** (7.6): I didn't love hearing this on the radio in late 2017 but now I can appreciate it more. I always thought of this being Post and Savage thinking on how fleeting and hedonistic their 15 minutes of fame will be, and for them to enjoy it while they can because it could be gone before they know it.

**runaway3212** (7.5): Post Malone is such a weird artist, but I enjoy most of his work

**rhyneston3** (7): This song only further cemented my confusion around Post Malone being hip hop or not.

**Roxieloxie** (7): i cant believe yall really let post " i experience reverse racism" malone become a thing

**steelstepladder** (7): I've always liked Posty

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): this is such a guilty pleasure for me. i wanted to hate this song so much but it won me over in the end

**cremeebrulee** (6.5): Posty has better songs that this

**gannade** (6.5): i like 21 savages verse

**itsabop (hals)** (6): Was over it a long time ago

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): Though I normally like somber partying songs, this is such a slog.

**skargardin** (6): I'd much rather take pop Post over his previous work. I was never too big on this song

**silentev** (5): Can Post Malone sing without autotune or…what? And why does every word have to end in a certain way so that it sort of rhymes or something because it’s so jarring.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU3nBp-DMUw

**vayyiqra** (5): It's only 3:30 PM and I almost fell asleep to this which is a bad sign.

**slimboyfriend** (4): idc if it's not cool anymore, i still hate post malone and this song is boring

**static\_int\_husp** (4): Post almost put me to sleep on this track, and then 21 comes in and absolutely knocks me into a slumber.

**waluigiest** (4): this is lowkey but in a low energy, unengaging kind of way

**1998tweety** (3): I have an irrational hatred for this song. For the longest time it was blocking Havana from the #1 spot that it deserved because 1. Havana is a better song 2. Camila was working SO hard promoting it like crazy and 3. Rockstar didn't even have a MV for half of the blocking. Finally, Havana scored it's deserved #1, and my hatred for this lowered a bit. I still don't like it and have no idea how it blew up (don't get me wrong Post has some good songs, but this ain't one of them). Not to mention that 21 savage is easily one fo the ugliest mofos I've seen, Thugger outsells on any days. Periodt!

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i do not enjoy this song

**bespectacIed** (2): Post Malone more like Post Malo

**camerinian** (1.5): It really kinda makes me mad how close this is to being good, but everyone involved went "Eh, fuck it" and clocked out of the studio an hour before their session was up. Post's delivery is monotone and bored when it should be sharp and warbly and irritating when it should be powerful, 21 Savage only puts any effort in when his verse is nearly over, and the fucking beat sounds like they exported the demo version that was missing a whole bunch of instrumental tracks and dynamic change ups that actually makes it any sort of interesting. I'm glad Post is basically just making pop music now, cos this suuuuuucked

**MrSwearword** (1): NOPE

I don’t know what Ja Rule did to Ashanti to get a restraining order from her but there’s moments in this song where you can feel a genuine affection through the lyrics. I really like how he ends each verse with “but who cares, you care”, it’s a genuinely effective line. Ashanti’s part is super catchy and intimate to the point where like other pop/rap tracks, the chorus seems to steal the show, and that seems to be most people’s complaint. Anyway, stream “Decline” by Raye because it interpolates this song and it’s a bop.

---

**MrSwearword** (10): Remember Ashanti? She had cute songs and played the part of the hook girl so well.

**TCHALLA1966** (10): AHHH I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT THIS SONG BABY!

**effervescentemu** (9.1): Ja Rule and Ashanti were the Ernie and Bert of 2001

**skargardin** (9): I haven't heard this in at least ten years... it bangs

**twat\_brained** (9): LOOOOOOVE Ashanti's voice here, I need to give her another chance. Foolish is a serve and a half, I kinda miss her

**waluigiest** (9): I’m probably gonna be overly positive towards the first quarter of this rate, but it makes me really nostalgic about riding in the car with my dad when I was growing up. I think about this chorus a lot. I think this is just so emblematic of hip hop at the time and I love it so much.

**1998tweety** (8): I don't like how his voice sounds, Ashanti ate though.

**bespectacIed** (8): Ja Rule's deep ass voice to me is the most recognizable sound of the early 2000s rap, his voice just transports you immediately to this era. His (misogynistic) verses snapped here, also Ashanti is an icon

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): Although he is now best-known as the hapless Cookie Monster-voiced spokesman for the ill-fated Fyre Festival, Ja Rule deserves a bit more credit in my opinion. Yes, his entire persona and image is basically that of a watered-down Tupac clone, but during the early-2000s Rule and his frequent collaborator Ashanti perfected the “thugs need love, too” formula; and on Always On Time, he succeeds at making a song about a pimp-prostitute relationship seem kind of...healthy-ish(?).

**mms82** (8): never heard this song before this and its absurd and so bad on the first listen but Ashanti's chorus stuck in my head all week after listening through this playlist for the first time and I actually kinda like this song now? super catchy

**rhyneston3** (8): Ja Rule is way better looking than I thought he would be

**radiofan15** (7.9): And to think the Fyre Festival attendees trusted the guy who did this song.

**slur in username** (7.2): Amazing how quickly Ja Rule fell off the map. Was a pretty big deal in the early 2000s but was a joke by the end of the decade.

**fishingfor8** (7): haha oh god I hate Ja Rule

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Not a fan of Ja Rule’s voice and I don’t see the overall appeal for this to hit #1

**runaway3212** (7): A weird song, hate to love it and really catchy

**sbb618** (7): This score is pretty much just for Ashanti

**slimboyfriend** (7): I LOVE this beat with Ashanti, but Ja Rule's vocals grate on everything else

**vayyiqra** (7): I love Ashanti's voice. This is a very smooth R&B track which was typical of this period. I don't like Ja Rule though so he drags it down a bit.

**rickikardashian** (6.9): is this song supposed to showcase ja rule as a heartrob? because what I got from this is that under no circumstances you should hook up with this dude

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): omg J-Lo’s vocals here are so good

**silentev** (6.5): Why did so many early 00s songs have fake radio setups in the intro/outro?

**camerinian** (6): Ja Rule always sounded really weird to me in these sorts of songs. He's just really not the lover type??? Shame cos Ashanti and the beat are stunning

**CarlieScion** (6): RAYE did it better

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Ja Rule sounds so early 2000's tbh.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): fyre.

**anothertown** (5): personally i miss ashanti

**frogaranaman** (5): this sounds like something a comedian would put in their movie during that one scene that involves a flashback to the early 2000s where they get their first blowjob or something like that

**steelstepladder** (4): Ja Rule made disasters way before Fyre Fest

**agentofscranton** (3.5): wow so romantic /s

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (2): this sounds dated as fuck and the lyrics are um…….not very good.

“Stand up!” is a command that Ludacris gives to start the party, and that's basically all the song is. The music video features large versions of small items, like a chicken leg and a beer bottle, many ridiculous scenarios, and many cameos like Kanye West, who is the producer of the song. It’s not the most iconic piece of music but it’s still a fun one to dance to, and the exchange between Ludacris and Shawnna takes it to another level.

---

**anothertown** (10): ok THIS is that shit. i had no idea this song went that hard, ludacris was so good at keeping the energy of a song up without a feature on a verse

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I like ludacris

**MrSwearword** (10): A KICKASS TRACK BY LUDACRIS, STAN IT

**rhyneston3** (10): What the actual fuck is this music video??? Automatic 10

**rsmitty99** (10): This was my dad's favorite song. He'd be mad if I gave Luda anything less

**steelstepladder** (10): I miss Ludacris so bad

**1998tweety** (9): LudaKING, doesn't know how to make a bad song

**ExtraEater** (9): drank

**camerinian** (8.5): OK real talk yeah this song is really, really dumb, and probably a bit gross, but holy shit Luda is fucking selling it and making it sound like it's a rager of a fucking time. The dude has some fucking grit and he's using every ounce of it, bad I'm honestly so here for it. This slaps so hard

**silentev** (8.5): The way Ludacris enunciates and accentuates words has always been my favorite.

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): Remember when Luda was an actual artist instead of the sidekick in cheesy action blockbusters? Thinking about how there are a good chunk of people now of legal age who have only known a world in which Ludacris, Ice Cube, Common and Ice-T are actors is a great way to feel ancient.

**skargardin** (8): bop!

**vayyiqra** (8): I feel like I'm too white for most of the songs in this rate but this is a bop

**ditacarlita** (7): was this from a movie? this certainly was NOT it in australia

**fishingfor8** (7): ehhh

**frogaranaman** (7): my left ear really enjoyed this song

**rickikardashian** (7): WHY DO SO MANY POPULAR RAP SONGS FROM THE EARLY 2000s HAVE SOME RAPEY SOUNDING LINES JESUS CHRIST

**Roxieloxie** (7): why is luda yelling in this song

**twat\_brained** (6.8): "midget hanging from my neck" that's not even good blasphemy smh 🙄i love Luda's enthusiasm and flow but it doesn't totally redeem this song

**radiofan15** (6.6): As a rapper... Ludacris is a nice addition to the Fast & Furious cast...

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): not the best of Luda’s bangers (the chorus is kinda meh), but a good example of how infectiously fun his personality & flow can be

**runaway3212** (6.5): This song did not age great, but it's not bad at all

**awhile2** (6): luda is underrated but always thought this was one of his worst singles. music video slaps tho

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6): If this song was just 4 straight minutes of When I move you move (just like that) this would’ve been a 10.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5): Already forgot what this sounded like.

**waluigiest** (5): this is intense but in an uncomfortable way, not a fun or hype way

**bespectacIed** (3): Weak ass hook with a rough, unmistakeable early kanye production

This song does have issues. Iggy per se has been a controversial personality and the main subject when it came to cultural appropriation in hip hop back in 2014. Her accent was criticised by many and T.I., who used to be her mentor, has publicly stated that she is one of his blunders. The lyrics leave something to be desired but the chorus makes the song pretty playful and enjoyable. Despite everything, when a female rapper was at the top of the American chart for 7 straight weeks, it was absolutely remarkable.

**tk note:** it always amazes me how this is objectively problematic on multiple levels yet isn't totally reviled by the subreddit because it's by a white woman. i'm not innocent though bc it still slaps

---

**1998tweety** (11): Charli stans y'all better show up here. RapQueenIggy ATE here. This is such a tune ugh, the chorus is super catchy (I'll admit Charli slayed it), but no matter what y'all say Iggy was the star here. Her lines are the most memorable in the entire song and I still see them quoted to this day. We love the longest-running #1 rap song by a female artist (no Truth Hurts isn't rap just because Lizzo is black).

**\_wailordfan** (10): white women? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TWjRhMcZ2A4

**bespectacIed** (10): This is a topnotch pop song, and in a year that was really great for pop music, this reigns supreme. Blaccent and the irony of the line "First things first, I'm the realest" aside, both Igs and charli really ate this song. I admit I still know every word of iggy's hilarious, nonsensical verses

**gannade** (10): a 10 for miss iggy iggz and a 0 for charli and then i give it a 10 because thats miss iggys power

**radiofan15** (10): who dat who dat? I I G G Y...

**rickikardashian** (10): Attack me, this song bangs and it doesn't deserve the drag that it will get

**rsmitty99** (10): Iggy was on top of the world for like 5 months. But damn that was a good five months

**sbb618** (10): Knowing what we know now about Iggy Azalea, it kinda makes me angry how good this song is

**ditacarlita** (9.5): loses half a point cause iggy's rapping has been better and i was so pissed when the leave it demo got turned into fancy but it's still great

**itsabop (hals)** (9.5): Charli's only US #1 hit, we have to stan

**hikkaru** (9): this is trash and i'm well aware of that fact

**poppinmmolly** (9): the r slur is yikes but i kinda love this song

**rhyneston3** (9): The second greatest “first things first” in hip hop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Listen, I know that shitting on Iggy Azalea is America's favorite pastime at this point, but this song is a fucking banger! And no, it's not just the iconic hook, Iggy's verses are just as memorable and fun. Maybe I'm just nostalgic about the time this song was big (senior year of high school, depression hadn't ruled my life yet and I was excited about what's to come) but to me this will always be a banger no matter what.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the ultimate white girl bop and also Charli’s peak

**frogaranaman** (8): every kid who knew this song word-for-word that was aged 8-14 was gay and didn’t know it yet

**skargardin** (8): Can't wait for this to flop somewhere in the top 20 again

**slimboyfriend** (8): Idk I like Charli's parts and I think Iggy is funny more than anything

**twat\_brained** (8): don't love the r slur but Charli saves this song. Sidenote, I fully expect this to miss day 3

**silentev** (7.5): This beat is stupidly infectious despite the questionable rhymes that still have me laughing years later like what murder business are you in Iggy? Charli saves the day here, seriously.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Erm, imagine still using ret*rded in your song in 2014

**CarlieScion** (6): catchy, overplayed and also not that good

**runaway3212** (6): 'Let me in! I be the I-G-G-Y' saved this song for me

**anothertown** (5): cant you taste this scone????

**steelstepladder** (5): Thank God for Charli on this song or else it would be way worse

**waluigiest** (5): stream Truth Hurts

**camerinian** (3): Charli sweetie I'm so sorry

**JustinJSrisuk** (3): The song that catapulted Iggy Azalea and Charli XCX to fame, but only the latter of which contributed anything memorable about the song. Charli’s explosive chorus tries mightily hard but simply can’t save the track from Iggy’s basic bars and listless delivery. I wonder if Fancy would be massively improved if all the verses were sung by Charli herself in the whisper flow that she’s done on songs by Brooke Candy and Tommy Genesis.

**vayyiqra** (3): You already knowwww ... that the chorus is the only good part / (-1) for "I'm the realest" from a woman who we all know is the complete opposite of that. I audibly groaned when this came on; that's not a good sign. Thanks for reminding me to study for my physics quiz though! (Also: +1 for the lyrics being better than I remember, but -1 for the lyrics being even cringier than I remember; "my flow retarded" ughhhh unless she was referring to fluid dynamics and the velocity of a liquid being slowed by mechanical factors there, there was no reason to say that line.)

**slur in username** (2.6): Hated the song in 2014 and still hate it today. Charli XCX’s chorus is okay but everything else is terrible.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (2): If this fucking sub somehow gets this song in the top ten based solely on the fact that Charli XCX is in it I’m going to scream. This song sucks and Charli’s hook isn’t even that good why can’t you gays acknowledge this.

**915BEAST** (1): I’m aussie, I hate that this is our biggest hit in recent years

**MrSwearword** (1): fucking awful to this day

**Roxieloxie** (0): listen i will never forgive white people for this song, literally fuck izzy australia

This song got a pretty high controversy average. I think any song that relies on a gimmick or on a dance move is either hated or loved. I personally enjoy songs like this or Macarena in the context of a party but when I have to rate one, it’s never a positive review. I do reckon that this is supposed to be silly so it's ironically great but seriously bad. It’s the music version of Schrödinger's cat, where the song is both things and nobody knows exactly what.

**tk note:** i was floored that nostalgia was strong enough to propel this nearly into the top half of the rate

---

**cremeebrulee** (11): The power this song has....... I'm pretty sure this is still one of my most listened to songs in 2019

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic

**\_wailordfan** (10): OTR honestly wishes it was this trendy

**awhile2** (10): my innocence was lost in 4th grade when i learned what it means to superman a hoe

**bespectacIed** (10): It just fills me with so much joy, listening to this song again. Every "yoooou" is an injection of dopamine. With the dumb lyrics, meme potential, and that snare/trap beat, this could still easily top the charts TODAY.

**CarlieScion** (10): i c o n i c

**frogaranaman** (10): SOULJA BOY MADE CRANK DAT AT 16 SOULJA BOYMADE RANK DAT AT 16 SOULJA BOY MADE CRANK DAT AT 16

**runaway3212** (10): This song just works, really really well

**steelstepladder** (10): THE MOST INFLUENTIAL ARTIST OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND I SAY THAT COMPLETELY UNIRONICALLY

**TCHALLA1966** (10): probably deserves a lower score but honestly it still slaps

**zaminizjammin** (10): YUUUUU

**Roxieloxie** (9.8): fuck souljia boy cause we dont stan homophobia but again, we cant deny the memory of the elementary school dance

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): invented viral songs, dances and memes. Soulja boy was ahead of his time.

**itsabop (hals)** (9): YOU

**sbb618** (9): I unironically miss Soulja Boy. Things were simpler then. Also, "Kiss Me Thru the Phone" still slaps.

**static\_int\_husp** (9): Act like this doesn't still go off. You can'y, cuz it does

**waluigiest** (9): what a cultural MOMENT this was so wildly influential in the development of a digital rap/music culture

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I'm so glad that this song is a meme that keeps on giving. Every generation of middle schoolers deserves to crank that :'))))

**twat\_brained** (8.3): The 21st letter of the alphabet.

**rhyneston3** (8): White guys listened to this once in 2007 and said they were into rap… It’s me I’m white guys

**rsmitty99** (8): YOOOOUUUUUUUUUUUU

**radiofan15** (7.5): “Soulja boy is fresh as hell and is actually the true meaning of what hip hop is sposed to be. He came from the hood, made his own beats, made up a new saying, new sound and a new dance with one song. He had all of America rapping this summer. If that ain’t Hip Hop then what is? A bunch of wannabe keep it real rappers that ain’t even relevant, recycling samples trying to act like it’s 96 again and all they do is hate on new shit? Niggas always talk about the golden age but for a 13 year old kid, this is the golden age!!! That song was so dope cause everything he said had a hidden meaning… that’s Nas level shit… he just put it over some steel drums which is also some Nas shit if you had the 2nd album cassette with the bonus track “Silent Murder” on it. In closing… new niggas get ya money$$$$$$$$$$ Keep this shit fresh and original…. ain’t no fuckin’ rules to this shit and that’s what real hip hop is to me.” - Kanye West

**rickikardashian** (6.9): hilarious meme and absolute banger for the first chorus and verse, then it's just unnecessary

**anothertown** (6): king of clark kent, king of puffy paint, king of trop pop

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (5.5): because this is at the same time the best and the worst song ever so 11+0=11/2=5.5.

**slur in username** (5.2): This guy releases so much stuff it’s ridiculous. 61 mixtapes since the release of this song and another 20 albums/Eps etc. on top of that

**ditacarlita** (5): this is really repetative and goes nowhere

**eigensheep** (5): It's not good exactly, but it's still a lot better than we all thought in 2007

**JustinJSrisuk** (5): Is Soulja Boy a talentless hack? An ahead of his time genius and technological trendsetter? A provocateur par-excellence that was in on the joke the entire time? Until we can parse the legacy of this enigma, I can only give this a solid, middle of the road 5 out of 10.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): I wish we were rating Kiss Me Thru the Phone

**jackisboredtoday** (4.8): I have fun with it but I can’t help but enjoy it as more of a meme than a song I’d listen to

**agentofscranton** (4.5): in year 6 we had a school-wide talent show and in our school there were only two year 6 classes, and their two teachers were like best friends and every talent show they made their classes compete in the talent show - both classes doing a big routine choreographed by their teachers. that year our class did a routine to 4 Minutes by Madonna and the other class did theirs to Crank That. i thought we had it in the bag but somehow - in the most unjust loss that side of hilary clinton - the crank that class won, and as a result i’ve hated this song ever since (not that this song was good to begin with mind)

**silentev** (4.5): Watch me give this a higher score than other songs unironically because while being slightly annoying this deserves credit for sounding different than the mainstream and teaching millions a brand-new dance that would be remembered for ages.

**fishingfor8** (3): be glad this is too stupid to hate soulja boy, be glad.

**camerinian** (2): I am so fucking livid that this loser has become influential and somehow stayed relevant, what the fuck

**MrSwearword** (1): NOPE

**1nf1n1te** (0): I've walked out of bars and parties for a cigarette break when this has come on

**915BEAST** (0): how on earth does this count, stupid lyrics, stupid dance and stupid people

**vayyiqra** (0): I hate this fucking song and I never noticed it mentions the very underappreciated sci-fi classic RoboCop and now I hate it even more

Are you in for more food wordplay? Ciara’s voice makes the song so seductive and tricky, which fits the lyrical theme of just playing around. The way words flow on the instrumental is so captivating and arousing. She could have sung this on her own and it would have been fine because the feature add nothing and she owns the scene. The quirky beat is just the cherry on top, for me at least.

**tk note:** the Lil Jon production is very of its time but this is an absolute slut bop in the best way, Petey Pablo is the underrated glue of the song

---

**rhyneston3** (11): I tried to give my first ever boyfriend a lap dance to this and tripped over his feet and dislocated my shoulder so this automatically gets my 11 thanks Ciara

**awhile2** (10): goodies is one of the most underrated albums oat js

**bespectacIed** (10): A BOPPPP. That iconic whistle activates the hoe chip in my brain. What a serve of a debut song from Ciara

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I have this synth line engrained in my brain since it came out

**itsabop (hals)** (10): I miss Ciara, what a queen

**MrSwearword** (10): Yaaaaaaaaaaaas Ciara, werk

**1998tweety** (9): That beat in the background is a little annoying, but besides that the song is great.

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): in this house we respect Ciara and her long, illustrious career of quality like this

**JustinJSrisuk** (8.5): That legendary synth-line, tho; also, stan Ciara.

**anothertown** (8): this 7th grade hoe anthem

**slimboyfriend** (8): Good job, Ciara

**vayyiqra** (8): I support Ciara's bodily autonomy and her decision to either keep her goodies in the jar or let them out as she chooses

**waluigiest** (8): the male features are not it but the beat and the chorus are THAT

**twat\_brained** (7.6): so are the "goodies in the jar" Ciara's sex toy collection or something?

**sailormunelune** (7): Definitely one of her weaker singles

**camerinian** (6.5): Look carefully at the "I REALLY wish I were rating 1,2, Step instead right now" button.

**ditacarlita** (6): it's questionable how some of these songs peaked at number one

**eigensheep** (6): Ciara's other big hits would all be higher

**silentev** (6): I love Ciara’s voice and abilities but my goodness the uninspired lyrics and trap beat was not my favorite here when compared to the namesake album.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): A 6, like Ciara's career.

**hikkaru** (5.5): whistle noise is quite annoying

**rickikardashian** (5.5): Why is Ciara singing like that? Why does the screech in back never end? Why is this song so fucking annoying but also kinda nice? Who told Ciara the falsetto part was good? How did this spend 8 weeks on #1?

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): I feel bad for how many songs I’m giving mediocre scores to but honestly these songs do nothing for me. Anyway Ciara’s voice sounds nice but nothing else about the song sticks with me and I've already forgotten what it sounds like immediately after listening to it.

**ignitethephoenix** (4): This song is not it, sorry Ciara. She sounds like she has trouble breathing while trying to sing here.

**runaway3212** (4): Annoying

**fishingfor8** (2): literally anyone is better than Ciara as an interesting person

**hagagaag** (2): I had never heard this song until now and wow it is aggressively 2000s sounding

**radiofan15** (1): I see Ciara and I immediately give the lowest score possible...

**steelstepladder** (1): WOW this song is so much worse than I remember

**CarlieScion** (0): that background theremin/whistling makes me wanna die

This song could have not been sung by anybody else. Eminem’s mature lyrics about his past relationship and Rihanna singing the chorus making them about Chris Brown, despite not writing them, sold the track pretty well. I think this is the first song that comes to mind when you think of rap/pop songs. Especially from 2009 and on, this song started a series of copycats that are telling of its impact. Some people don’t like serious Eminem though so that’s why this is sitting here.

**tk note:** Okay so here's my infamous story regarding this song. When I was like 10 my cat was on her deathbed and my family was saying goodbye when my mom suggested that we sing to her. I couldn't think of any other sad songs to sing so I sang this

---

**mms82** (11): Tough choice but this song takes my 11. Sung it at a karaoke bar with a friend the other day and realized again how god awful the lyrics can get but its easily Eminem best song, and I would even argue Rihanna's too. Her voice is amazing and haunting and makes this song work. Eminem tells a story through his raps to a beat that just flows so well with Rihanna's vocals. This song just works so well and has held up so well over the years.

**poppinmmolly** (11): TK knows why this is my 11 and he BETTER!!! tell the story

**1998tweety** (10): A contender for my 11. Ugh despite hating Em this song is so good. Rih kills the chorus and I even memorized Em's rap cause I liked them that much. Helps that he didn't slip any slurs into this one!

**bespectacIed** (10): Rih, Where is the album, We need the damn album

**radiofan15** (10): The only good Rihanna/Eminem song... i'm sorry but I don't make the rules...

**skargardin** (10): Huge banger! One of Rihanna's best hooks I might say

**sbb618** (9.5): This really was the golden age of rap songs with a huge sung chorus, huh? I'm not complaining. The only reason this isn't a 10 is because of that terrible windowpane line.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9): Rihanna giving Eminem a career, what else is new?

**rickikardashian** (8.8): Rihanna has only the chorus while Eminem has a bunch of long ass verses, and still feels more like a Rihanna song than an Eminem one

**slur in username** (8.6): Good song but a little overdramatic (much like Eminem)

**camerinian** (8.5): Wow, an Eminem song that actually conducts a mood that isn't just bored, unsatisfied bragging???? Cool

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Rihanna makes this song 10x better although her being in this song is uncomfy since it wasn’t that long after CB abused her.

**rsmitty99** (8.5): This song was MASSIVE! Idk. I haven't LOVED an Eminem song since the mid 2000s

**\_wailordfan** (8): Ugh I don't want this to work because I really don't want Em to win but the hook is just so amazing

**CarlieScion** (8): guess that's why they call it window pane

**cremeebrulee** (8): Points off for that "window pane" line bc it still haunts me to this day

**frogaranaman** (8): have to dock points for window pane, but a fun bop at the club

**rhyneston3** (8): My mind was blown when I was nine and heard the window pane/pain lyric for the first time

**silentev** (8): Serious Eminem is back for another hit and this time he brought Rihanna and it is so beautiful what did we do to deserve this?

**static\_int\_husp** (8): "I guess that's why they call it window pane" still has to be one of the corniest lines in rap

**915BEAST** (7): same as not afraid

**ditacarlita** (7): i'm so sick of this bloody song

**runaway3212** (7): It's good, but that's really because of Rihanna.

**slimboyfriend** (7): It teeters on the edge of glamorizing abuse and protraying the complexity of the abuse cycle. But that window pane line is unforgivable.

**steelstepladder** (7): That window pane line is forever the moment when Em became dad joke Em... other than that it's good

**vayyiqra** (7): Going to copy and paste my comment from "Not Afraid" but slightly altered: I grew up listening to Eminem, but by the time this song came out he'd fallen off for me. This song has a nice instrumental and chorus but something about it feels like "generic pop ballad #345325 only with Eminem rapping angrily over it". (+1) though for the memorable hook by Rihanna.

**hikkaru** (6): always thought this was a Rihanna song as opposed to Eminem, and that says a lot. the only reason this has an okay score is Rih's chorus

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): The Rihanna hook gets 6 points, which takes it up from the 0 due to the “that must be why they call it window pain/pane” line.

**twat\_brained** (6): I didn't even like this one in 2010 despite Rih being on it. Eminem just feels aggressive here and I'm actually scared of him. And the windowpane lyric… why do people still cape for him? Especially after the disaster that was Kamikaze?

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): I legitimately didn’t know that the Eminem portion of this song existed until a few years ago. I wish I still didn’t.

**ImADudeDuh** (4): erm kinda awkward and makes me uncomfortable

**waluigiest** (4): imo this is not the kind of song where I want a both sides approach. I took this from 5 down to 4 when I remembered the window pane line

**williamdowley123** (2): why is eminem so loud like shut up

**eigensheep** (1): Windowpane.

**MrSwearword** (1): blurgh, this sucks

This song manages to feel huge and unimpactful at the same time. Its critically acclaimed video, which was described as "the most talked-about music video of recent memory”, made it debut at the top of the Hot 100, and maybe because of that, to me, the video feels more iconic than the track. There’s no replay value here, nor a catchy hook that grasps the listener. It’s clear it was made as a piece of art and not as a piece of music because while I do think it deserved to be praised, I wouldn’t stay listening to this all day, in the same way I wouldn’t look at an art piece in a museum for more than 2 minutes. I guess some people would though.

**tk note:** I don't think THAT much is lost because of the video because I still find the adlibs and constant switches to be super entertaining.

---

**zaminizjammin** (11): DONALD IS THE ONE I STAN

**1998tweety** (10): I'm keeping this at a 10 even though it's a shrinker just cause I love how he incorporated that African-ish beat and then made the sudden switch. Ugh his mind.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I remember how everyone was saying how the video was much better the song (which I think it still is) but the song holds up really well still over a year later for me. The message is still important and it still has an impactful sound.

**rsmitty99** (10): Whew chile dat music video

**silentev** (10): Donald Glover I mean Childish Gambino is here to tell us something very important but it’s important that we have a good time too. It’s so hard not to give my one eleven to this because I love every unique thing about it.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Defining song of 2018. One of the biggest moments of the decade in pop culture and it absolutely deserved all the acclaim it got. Won't be mad at all if this wins.

**915BEAST** (9): best music video in recent memory

**rhyneston3** (9): The video bumps it up a lot

**sbb618** (9): Even removed from the video, this song is still incredibly catchy and pointedly topical.

**skargardin** (9): Some of the impact is lost without the killer visuals but it is a great song

**camerinian** (8.5): WHERE ARE THE FUCKING GUNSHOTS

**runaway3212** (8.5): The video is amazing, the song itself is still pretty good

**sailormunelune** (8.5): The video really elevates this song in terms of insight and impact, but the song itself is still solid

**ImADudeDuh** (8): iconic but lowkey a fad at the same time?

**waluigiest** (8): A super poignant song and moment. It’s reflected well in the contrasting orchestrations, and the video’s impact cannot be understated. It’s not a song I find myself going back to.

**radiofan15** (7.6): I can't believe i'm gonna say this but this needs more GUNSHOTS!

**\_wailordfan** (7): unfortunately definitely overhyped

**frogaranaman** (7): coming up from thirst liking 300 posts deep into Frank’s Instagram I’m actually a racist,

**rickikardashian** (7): I'm surprised as to how Gambino was able to make a video amazing enough to convince the people that this average song was as amazing

**Roxieloxie** (7): I did a project on this song for my 2018 internship and while editing i had to listen to this song so much it ruined it for me. but fuck cops

**steelstepladder** (7): I respect it more than like it but it's still good

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): if we were rating music videos this would contend for my eleven, but sadly we aren’t

**agentofscranton** (6): imo nothing special as a song, but if we were rating the video it'd be an easy 11

**bespectacIed** (6): It's so funny to me how quickly this shot up to the zenith of pop culture then quickly got forgotten. DAE still listen to it??? This is America is not the Alright she thought she was

**hikkaru** (6): as a song it's a bit underwhelming, the music video really makes it

**mms82** (6): if this rate was on the style of Music Videos it would be an easy 11. for songs though it's not fantastic

**MrSwearword** (6): not the video version and that makes the difference

**vayyiqra** (6): [generic "video shocking but song mid" take] also I am a Community stan and I still do not like any of Glover's music except "Redbone".

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): The video is good, the song s not. Stop pretending

**slur in username** (5.1): The song itself is rather boring but is elevated with the music video.

**twat\_brained** (5): this works better as a critical art piece than as a song. As in, when Todd in the Shadows called Bad Romance a video that happens to have some music in it, that's what Donald's released here. Obviously, being black in the United States seems like you've got a target on your back; a loaded topic to tackle, but it doesn't come across like that here. And the Kodak Black shoutout? I decried Cardi for it, I don't want to come across it twice.

**JustinJSrisuk** (4): The song by itself is a 6/10 but the iconic video adds another 2 points.

**anothertown** (3): donald glover fucking sucks

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (1): If the video didn’t exist no one would be listening to or even acknowledge this nothingness of a song

**gannade** (0): this ENTIRE song, from the beat to the lyrics to the flow is completely plagiarized. and childish gambino wants to pretend hes some woke smart guy when all he did was copy the entire song from a lesser known artist? using the tragedies of black americans for personal profit when he cant even credit a lesser known black artist? trash.

I don’t know about you, but I still hear this one in clubs sometimes. To quote 50 Cent, he stated: "I attempted to be as sexual as possible, from a male perspective, without being vulgar or obscene.” I think he indeed was able to make a song that is simply sensual, without getting too explicit, and Olivia’s seductive voice spices things up to the right point. My only problem with this is that there’s not a single piece of candy shown in the music video. Lil Wayne did that right at least.

**tk note:** I genuinely have no idea how this is so high, I feel like all the criticisms of songs that are much lower apply here as well...

---

**\_wailordfan** (10): A bop that unifies all walks of life

**frogaranaman** (10): thinking about that vine where the dachshund is sitting on the bed on its back and the guy is rapping the intro to this song and the dachshund just looks at the camera like it’s in the office

**MrSwearword** (10): Olivia's sole triumph...as a feature but I mean, this song just works so well, plus the video is wondiferously tacky as fuck

**rhyneston3** (10): Strong contender for my 11, that beat goes off

**skargardin** (10): They just don't do it like this anymore.

**agentofscranton** (9.5): the way they say whoa honestly sounds as if something weird happens in the middle of them getting down and dirty - like a goblin came crawling out her vag or something

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): 50 Cent's defining song.

**1998tweety** (9): Finally a good song from him, the production on this is great.

**mms82** (9): I hate that I like this song so much but it stayed so catchy over all these years

**rickikardashian** (9): I have no clue if this is liked or not, all I gotta say is that hearing this song while drunk in a bar is a heavenly experience

**rsmitty99** (9): Whatever happened to Olivia? Not a fan of 50, but this song slaps

**runaway3212** (8.5): Amazing

**bespectacIed** (8): classic

**CarlieScion** (8): possibly the only good 50 cent song and its not even because of him

**Roxieloxie** (8): the production on all these songs slap

**ditacarlita** (7.5): it's good but it's not Madonna Hard Candy good

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): It’s catchy but compared to In Da Club, this song is a more boring version of that.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the candy stuff is so unsexy

**sbb618** (7): 50 Cent has absolutely no passion and it's kinda hilarious

**waluigiest** (7): the orchestration is so dramatic!! I can’t decide if this is objectifying trash or good reciprocated nonsense

**JustinJSrisuk** (6): 50 always sounded so disinterested and disengaged on his tracks.

**slimboyfriend** (6): You might think I'm kidding but I was in fifth grade when this song came out and I remember it being really big in my elementary school

**twat\_brained** (6): I miss Olivia, she sounded pretty good on this. Is she still putting out anything? Also if I was ever rapping along to any of the verses as a 7 year old my parents failed me

**vayyiqra** (6): Why was "vaguely Middle Eastern strings" such a popular kind of sample in the 2000s? Anyway I hate 50 Cent but this is one of his least awful songs.

**silentev** (5.5): Sexualized lyrics are fine and okay and can be fun but maybe subtlety would’ve been better here. The beat is fun though.

**eigensheep** (5): Rappers liked their lollipop metaphors in the 2000s I guess

**steelstepladder** (3): Scott Storch at his Scott Worst

**radiofan15** (2.5): I've read first grade books less repetitive and with more substance than this...

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (1): green day would’ve had a number one hit if it weren’t for this and for that i despise this song. not that this is a very good song to begin with. fuck 50 cent for the third and final time.

**camerinian** (0): I just really fucking hate 50 Cent. I can't believe how fucking lazy and bland every single one of his fucking lines is while he has the enthusiasm of a fucking mumble rapper but somehow not the diction of one to at least give us the relief of not being able to understand his fucking shit lyrics devoid of any sort of creativity or even attempts at metaphor. Also the beat is fucking skin crawling instead of sexy and the entire conceit of candy may as well not exist outside of the hook, which God bless whoever this Olivia person is, I hope she got some decent royalties for having to have her name stuck on this worthless piece of mould for her whole career. I wish 50 Cent were still bankrupt. Fuck Bitcoin

This song is pretty straightforward. I love the groovy mood this has though, it’s such a flirtatious beat. The track never gets vulgar, even when it talks about sex, and the conversation is always frisky. Plus, all the references to other rap/hip-hop songs, just make it fun, because that’s what the situation he’s describing is like. I know some are not fans of autotune but I just think it works so well here, especially when put right next to the harmonies of the chorus, and T-Pain produced his own song too. A talented man.

---

**effervescentemu** (10): From the ages of 12-14 I was a T-Pain stan (I know) and I have to honour that part of myself with my rating.

**rhyneston3** (10): Where is he that the clubs close at 3 I wanna move there

**rsmitty99** (10): Didn't T-Pain say that line in the chorus is "And Then" and not "ooo-wee"? I feel like he's just wrong.

**steelstepladder** (10): Tpain is largely underrated as a cultural juggernaut

**zaminizjammin** (10): T-Pain is a legend

**1998tweety** (9): Bops a bit

**waluigiest** (9): the afrofuturism popped out

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): We, as a society, do not respect T-Pain enough

**anothertown** (8): ah t-pain's hooks.. they don't make them like that anymore

**camerinian** (8): I want T-Pain to be my sugar daddy

**MrSwearword** (8): It's fine for what it is

**rickikardashian** (8): I somehow didn't expect the "baby girl what's your name" hook to be originally from a T-Pain song

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): pain

**eigensheep** (7): Every musical trend on this song didn't make it past 2009, and yet this song somehow aged alright. I can't explain it.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): Monster SNAPPPPPED

**runaway3212** (7): Pretty good

**vayyiqra** (7): So this is the kind of crappy rap song featuring T-Pain that was parodied in the classic meme song "I'm On a Boat". I kind of like the instrumental even though the lyrics are trash.

**slur in username** (6.8): Hate T-Pain but this song’s alright

**twat\_brained** (6.4): Joc sounds like such a wasted feature here; why are we giving songs with great hooks all this attention when the verses are just so forgettable?

**fishingfor8** (6): Bartender>>>>

**frogaranaman** (6): U was at da club, bottoms up when I first met u

**silentev** (6): You know T-Pain can really sing behind that autotune and it’s a shame he doesn’t just sing without it because it could add something to this song maybe.

**JustinJSrisuk** (5.5): T-Pain has much better material than this.

**radiofan15** (4.2): What is this trend of songs' names being written as if an imbecile have named them? I swear there was this Janet Jackson album in which nearly all of the songs' names were written like that and it was annoying as fuck...

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4): The Tiny Desk version of this song is a 10

**skargardin** (3): This aint it

This came out in a time where artists like Lorde would sing about their disapproval for the expensive things rappers usually talked about. A song about buying cheap clothes was unheard of and made Macklemore & Ryan Lewis stars in 2013. Its humorous lyrics made it big, but its infectious beat made it inescapable, as it could be played both at parties and on the radio. That saxophone riff alone was so impactful that for an entire year it felt like every song had a sax portion. It’s such a good song to be honest, let’s dance to being poor.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh Macklemore and Ryan Lewis were such an iconic duo, the beat and chorus on this are immaculate.

**frogaranaman** (10): whoever says they didn’t like this song when it came out is a revisionist

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I don’t care if this song is white af, it’s fun and reinvigorated thrift shopping which is great because we need to buy less new clothing and buy gently used clothing if we want to be more sustainable and not kill or planet through consumerism.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): The way Macklemore finally exposed the evils of capitalism and elitism of the fashion world and made it hit number 1.................... whew

**MrSwearword** (10): Macklemore has talent, deal accordingly

**radiofan15** (10): We were too harsh with Macklemore...

**rhyneston3** (10): I forgot how good of a song this is

**rickikardashian** (10): Y'all hoes can say whatever you want about Macklemore, but Thrift Shop is one of the best songs released on the decade and whoever disagrees never had the beautiful experience to listen to this song on a middle school party and seeing absolute everyone lose their shit

**rsmitty99** (9.5): God this song is fun. I don't think this song nor Macklemore have aged well, which is why I took a half point off. But damn does this bring me back to college

**sbb618** (9.5): More songs need saxophone

**hikkaru** (9): honestly do not think I've listened to this song in 5 years but it's a bop

**slur in username** (8.9): A joke song but this was a big deal because Macklemore got a #1 song from an independent label. This would become a bit more common in the following years when streaming becomes the main consumption of music.

**twat\_brained** (8.6): honestly this song fully deserved to be the 2013 Year-End #1 y'all can stay mad lmao it was either this or Blurred Lines and IMO this aged better than it should have

**cremeebrulee** (8.5): I remember really digging this song when it first came out but pretended to hate it because that was apparently the thing to do when I was in HS. But honestly it slaps

**itsabop (hals)** (8.5): I like this more than I probably should

**runaway3212** (8.5): A great song if a bit corny

**915BEAST** (8): it’s fun and doesn’t deserve the hate

**CarlieScion** (8): communist anthem!

**silentev** (7.5): Another song with a premise that is so ridiculous that it just…works. Put it over a catchy beat and horn and you got yourself a hit!

**camerinian** (7): This has aged pretty badly, but ngl 90% of my wardrobe comes from thrift shops so this still very much resonates with me after all this time

**JustinJSrisuk** (7): Eco-conscious legend.

**steelstepladder** (7): All you have to do is look at Lil Dicky to see how much worst this could have been

**vayyiqra** (7): It's kind of a funny novelty song, and the sax hook is catchy, and Macklemore is very overhated. Yes, "Same Love" is very corny, but he meant well with it, and his undercut was cool even if it did sort of make him look like a neofascist (don't @ me). I kind of like the trope of self-aware hip-hip songs that parody how over-the-top and materialistic hip-hop culture is. (Though I understand hip-hop is like that because it comes from people who grew up in poverty so that's kind of problematic.)

**waluigiest** (7): I’m a saxophone player and when I was in high school, the sax motif was so cool to me. Now I’m really bothered by the plastic-y production/filter they put over it it’s just so grating. I was going to give this a lower score because some of it’s annoying, but Karl Marx made some points

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (6): It's so much fun but I can't give it a better score because I don't think of it as a real song.

**Roxieloxie** (5): oh fuck i forgot about this song. this song deserves a 0 for making upper middle class white kids think thrifting was tReNdY when my low income ass was being bullied for high waisted thrifted jeans

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5): The only reasonable explanation as to why a song about going to a thrift store and buying clothes that smell like R Kelly’s piss stained sheets became the biggest hit of 2013 was that we live in a simulation and there was a glitch in it that made the public want to listen to a novelty song about thrift shopping.

**skargardin** (3): The R.Kelly line is the only saving grace here

**williamdowley123** (2): smells like my baseball cleats ewwwww

**\_wailordfan** (1): I feel like this is mildly self-explainable, it's a comedy song, and while it is a catchy flow, the idea of treating it as a portion of the 'rap/hip-hop album of the year' just hurts me.

**bespectacIed** (1): The "what up, i got a big cock" lyric was the nail in the coffin; the "smells like R Kelly sheets ... pissssss" lyric was the six feet of soil; the heist winning best rap album over good kid, maad city was the gravemarker.

**anothertown** (0): pissssssssssssssssssssssssss

This song has never bored me. It’s such an aggressive song with a lot of personality that if it doesn’t make you jump, I don’t know what’s wrong with you. I usually like rap songs that are fast so this fits my likings, and Cardi’s flow is very bouncy and pumps me up. It’s not a masterpiece when it comes to lyrics but they get the job done and this song is one of the most memorable ones we are rating. It made her the biggest female rapper in the world, it broke records, made her gain a Grammy, and whether you like or not, it made history.

---

**gannade** (11): this songs success is a victory and the song itself sounds like victory. you would think popheads, a largely gay community that also heavily borrows from black culture, would be rooting for a unprivileged WOC that clawed herself up in a male dominated field. but nah, cardi doesnt talk or act a certain way so now a bunch of privileged white nerds have an issue with her. my 11 for this is political but theres something much more inspiring about the song than race, gender, or social status. its how cardi took every criticism and insecurity thrown at her (her stripper past, her teeth, her "loudness") and turned it into a #1 song, we love to see it!

**1998tweety** (10): My friend gannade stans this song so I do too. Is it Cardi's best song? No. But it definitely has it's own charm to it.

**MrSwearword** (10): it seems weird to do this but I mean Cardi has and maintains enthusiasm in her flow

**radiofan15** (10): This song stole my hard-earned money and call me a trannie and i'm grateful for it...

**rhyneston3** (10): Watch Hustlers!!

**rsmitty99** (10): Okurrrrr

**runaway3212** (10): Lyrically amazing and Cardi's personality makes this into a great song

**skargardin** (10): In comparison to other rap artists, Cardi works incredibly well with a trap beat and her personality fucking shines on this song. It's just a huge anthem

**\_wailordfan** (9.5): Cardi really did snap here

**CarlieScion** (9): danceable and fun

**rickikardashian** (9): Seeing Cardi go from the woman in the "a hoe never gets cold" vine to Grammy winning rapper with two 1# hits has been a ride I never would have been prepared to take

**sbb618** (9): It's a surreal experience to be amidst a crowd of like 200 white people all shouting this song.

**ditacarlita** (8.5): lil BITCH

**poppinmmolly** (8.5): u/piccprincess sang this at karaoke when we met and it was hilarious (obviously she did not sing the n word so she isn't cancelled!!)

**silentev** (8.5): I remember hearing this for the first time in my car just staring at my radio like ‘who is this’ and still to this day I say yass bitch while singing along ‘I’m rich I’m rich I’m rich’.

**bespectacIed** (8): Although I'm a closet barb and therefore obligated to slander bardi, this is catchy and iconic

**ImADudeDuh** (8): it grew on me tbh, percht to see it destroyed in the indieheads rate

**mms82** (8): what a moment but the song definitely loses something every listen

**slimboyfriend** (8): She's talented, pls be nice to her

**steelstepladder** (8): Great introduction to the dominant force that is Cardi B

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (8): I feel bad for liking this song because Cardi B is a person of ambiguous problematicness but this does slap and was well deserving of being the first female hip hop number 1 since Lauryn Hill

**waluigiest** (8): this song is about everything and also nothing and she killed it!!

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I feel like a bad bitch listening to this song but it’s not a song I come back to

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): I was very surprised when this song blew up the way it did, but I eventually got the hype. I'm glad it gave us Cardi too, she's fun.

**camerinian** (7): I wish the production we're a bit more dynamic, cos Cardi's bars are on point all the way through.

**twat\_brained** (7): Decent beat, and Cardi has a good flow on the verses, but like… the song title literally alludes to a convicted rapist. And the hook literally cops his rap style. I expect a high average controversy score in this rate, and I'm certain this song will exceed it. Not to mention Cardi rubs me a really unfavorable way, as do most artists in this rate. I'm willing to leave this in 2017. Not necessarily Cardi, but certainly this.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): Honestly not one of my favorite Cardi songs, even though it’s what broke her into the mainstream. I feel like her harder-edged delivery on tracks like Bartier Cardi is more effective.

**anothertown** (5): i think of desus nice everytime

**vayyiqra** (5): I do not like Cardi B and I do not like this song, but it's memorable but I don't like that is.

**915BEAST** (4): loses points for the line “I just checked my accounts turns out I’m rich, I’m rich, I’m rich” just put some effort into a song where you stole your flow

**frogaranaman** (0): someone once joked about how this song sounds like Phineas and Ferb were trying to write a catchy rap song like Gitchy Gitchy Goo and I don’t know why but it makes perfect sense to me

**TCHALLA1966** (0): I’ve come to really dislike this song tbh

I’m not going to lie, I thought this song had a good chance at winning, but considering I’m not big on it myself, I should have guessed there were other people that didn’t love it as well. I just don’t think I’m part of the demographics this song is targeting. It’s a typical feel-good, female-empowerment anthem that does not affect me at all. I see the appeal though, as Lizzo’s charisma shines on this, and the beat reminds of a Kyle’s song, with its glittery piano loop. Plus, I don’t think anybody expected this song to top the chart 2 years after its release. That’s not something that happens often, and it makes me wonder how many songs could have been hits if they had been part of a soundtrack.

**tk note:** LMAO at how much Lizzo has been hyped up over the past year by y'all only to be paid dust

---

**twat\_brained** (11): I just took a DNA test, turns out I'm 100% giving this my 11 because this song is recent, accessible and performed by the least controversial artist in this rate. Postmates orders aside, I may actually quit this sub if this doesn't win

**bespectacIed** (10): I've seen a tweet once that this song is like a Forever 21 statement t-shirts aisle, and I couldn't get it out of my head. I still love this song though. It gave a #1 and a big break to a truly talented woman who doesn't check all the checkboxes of what a popstar should be. Also I refuse to get in the Lizzo circlehate that's starting now 😪

**ditacarlita** (10): this song has so much fucking character and really sticks out on this list a+++ would buy again

**eigensheep** (10): I still can't believe Lizzo doesn't have more hits. She almost got my 11, but Outkast is too good.

**hikkaru** (10): justice for juice #juicestice

**poppinmmolly** (10): not getting my 11 because recency bias

**Roxieloxie** (10): it was between this and OTR for my 11 but I am confident the 20 something year old white women of popheads stan lizzo enough that this will be fine. tbt lizzo reminds me of LNX in a way of their hustle for success that angered old white people who didnt think they deserved a spot in the industry. stan them both.

**rsmitty99** (10): My grandmother asked me the other day "who's that 100% bitch people keep talking about?" I screamed to the heavens.

**silentev** (10): Three years later and while some people are late to the Lizzo game I am still not sick of singing this loudly to myself, in the car or to my cat and am so excited that Lizzo finally got the success she deserves with a catchy beat and positive, fun song.

**915BEAST** (9): the new album is amazing

**\_wailordfan** (9): Not really pure enough to be worthy of a 10 here but it is a phenomenal song.

**camerinian** (9): This song is really amazing in how it captures the essence of Lizzo better than any of her other songs, the only problem is that it sets too high a bar for itself? Like the first verse and chorus are chock full of quotable lines, while the other two verses aren't as much, even though they're still great. Still, being too good for itself isn't the worst criticism in the world lmao. Why am I even still talking? This is really good shut up

**rhyneston3** (9): Lizzo’s had a rough month so I’m bumping this up to a 9.

**rickikardashian** (9): something something black beetles something something lawsuit

**runaway3212** (9): Very good song, hope Juice will be her next #1

**waluigiest** (9): fucking fantastic - just saw her in concert and I’m so glad she’s breaking out. She’s fantastic in every capacity really. I took off one point because in a fair universe, Juice would be having this rate right now.

**agentofscranton** (8.5): juice and good as hell should've gotten the success truth hurts did smh

**zaminizjammin** (8.5): water me is still lizzo's best song fight me

**slur in username** (8.3): A breath of fresh air. Don’t really care for the majority of the newcomers – find many of them dull and uninteresting. Lizzo on the other hand is charismatic, has the x-factor and is a star in the making.

**CarlieScion** (8): a bop that i liked more a year ago

**ImADudeDuh** (8): White people appropriated this

**sbb618** (8): The Minnesota Vikings line is the best part

**slimboyfriend** (8): Not to be too indieheads, but Lizzo was an amazing local rapper before she got famous and I wish she'd showcase that more in the music she makes now :(((

**steelstepladder** (8): Fire, but Lizzo has done better

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): I like it, but I can’t fully get past the Black Beatles comparison

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Look I love Lizzo but the song is only good in small doses or when you are drunk. The lyrics are fun and memorable and it’s catchy but I find her voice is very grating throughout the entire song. It’s not her best (unlike some other songs by other artists here) so I have to dock some points here.

**sailormunelune** (7): stream Juice

**skargardin** (7): I feel like this might get insanely overrated in this rate due to its recent success

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7): I like Lizzo but she's very quickly becoming unbearable and I'm looking forward to her 15 minutes being over.

**JustinJSrisuk** (6.5): Listen, I love me some Lizzo. I’ve loved her since her rousing performance of Good As Hell on the Samantha Bee show in the wake of the 2016 election and all the way back to her viral flute videos. But memeability and quotability factor aside, I don’t think that Truth Hurts is the best vehicle for showcasing Lizzo’s talents. But I am certainly glad that the good sis is getting PAID.

**anothertown** (6): #JusticeforJuice

**fishingfor8** (6): This isn't a rap song just because billboard says its rap doesn't mean you can put it in the rate stop trying to give lizzo a rate win. Also juice deserved the #1

**frogaranaman** (6): coming up from fucking my bear hookup I’m actually fatphobic,

**1998tweety** (4.5): Why didn't the correct Lizzo song blow up? At least Good As Hell is getting it's fame rn even if that trashy racist Ari hoped on it. Truth Hurts is meh. Yeah it has some nice funny lines but besides that the beat doesn't offer anything special and Lizzo's vocals obviously don't shine here. Giving it a slightly higher score cause it's better than a lot of the garbage here.

**gannade** (4): not really a rap song but okay

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (4): I liked this song the first 3 times I heard it. Not sure if I can say the same after the 200th time.

**vayyiqra** (3): Sorry Lizzo, honey; "Tempo" is a bop but what the fuck is this. This trash is where that meme came from? Rating: [NOT GOOD]

**radiofan15** (1.5): I'm rooting for her but this unoriginal, overplayed, overhyped corporate bland song is not it...

**MrSwearword** (1): Netflix, TikTok and basic bitches on Instagram deserve eternal damnation for what they've wrought onto us. Had this not gone to number one, I'd still hate it for how it got popular in the first place and quite fucking frankly, Lizzo should be reading all of you for filth for not making her current material successful. Stream JUICE and shut the hell up.

The whole track is a dedication to class soul music, with dozens of artists referenced in the lyrics, as well as a Luther Vandross sample forming the beat. It’s both sensual and droll, with lines like the Michael Jackson ones and the interlude where Kanye passes the mic to Twista, but it works. Kanye delivers a good verse but I adore when Twista follows the sample’s melody and his words rhyme with those of Luther, making them sound like one thing. And Jamie Foxx’s chorus puts all the song’s segments together. It has an uncommon song structure but it flows pretty well. This is a full banger honestly.

**tk note:** Probably my favorite Kanye song and almost my 11 in this rate. It doesn't take itself seriously but it's super creative and fun

---

**1998tweety** (10): Kingye, this is quite good. The vocalist ate the most though.

**anothertown** (10): the longer version on the college dropout is superior, but both are perfect and have all the elements I love - the chopped up drums, Aisha Tyler, "dam baby I can't do it that fast but I know somebody who can"

**bespectacIed** (10): The humor of early 2000s hiphop is UNMATCHED. I am legit crying at the disrespect of the line "She got a light-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson / Got a dark-skinned friend, look like Michael Jackson". What a funny af and beautiful song, a perfect marriage of hiphop and RnB, thanks for the GORGEOUS vandross sample and twista's fire verse

**fishingfor8** (10): this is the song that makes me sad I'm not in a relationship

**gannade** (10): she got a dark skinned friend look like michael jackson, got a light skinned friend look like michael jackson

**radiofan15** (10): Can we have this Kanye back please?

**steelstepladder** (10): Smoooooooooth as hell

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (9.5): A whole lot going on here and I mean that in the best way possible.

**camerinian** (9): This is weirdly beautiful???? Is that weird to say?

**rsmitty99** (9): "Got a light skin friend look like Michael Jackson. Got a dark skin friend look like Michael Jackson" Dead

**runaway3212** (9): Just great nothing more to be said

**sbb618** (8.5): There's a reason Kanye was so in-demand even before The College Dropout. Twista drops fire, too.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): Twista makes this song more intersting tbh. Also, Overnight Celebrity is the superior Kanye / Twista collab.

**awhile2** (8): overnight celebrity shouldve been the bigger hit tbh

**ImADudeDuh** (8): oh wait, this kinda slaps

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): 2003 Kanye, where did you go? We miss you.

**rickikardashian** (8): That Michael Jackson line is Kanye's peak and there's no argument against it

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I’m surprised this went number 1 it doesn’t stand out that much to me.

**silentev** (7.5): The female voice asking to go faster is still cringe years later.

**slur in username** (7.1): Back when Kanye was an up and coming rapper and was a breath of fresh air compared with the countless 50 Cent clones and annoying “crunk” rappers.

**frogaranaman** (7): LMFAOOOOO I FORGOT KANYE’S MICHAEL JACKSON LINES

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (7): Maybe Twista snapped on those verses.

**vayyiqra** (7): The title of this song was accurate. I cannot tell if the lyrics are meant to be ironic or not, and that's perhaps a good thing

**waluigiest** (7): this is kind of chaotic, but the Michael Jackson line makes me laugh out loud every time. they really said that huh

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): imma bring the cool whip

**ditacarlita** (6): weak amongst this list

**rhyneston3** (6): Twista’s flow in the second verse is great but other than that it’s kinda… boring?

**MrSwearword** (5): not Overnight Celebrity so I don't have to care about a Twista song

**twat\_brained** (3): that michael jackson lyric alone ruins this song

Dr. Dre was in the studio with 50 Cent and he showed him a number of beats that he thought could have been hits. 50 Cent eventually rapped on this one and the rest is history. The beat had been previously given to other rappers but nobody knew how to jump on it. Despite some lyrics that are products of their time, this song is a guaranteed party-starter. The production is detailed and features parse orchestral samples and a snaking chorus. It’s a party anthem and I’ll end by quoting the rapper’s words: “every day it's relevant all over 'cause every day is someone's birthday.”

---

**ditacarlita** (11): name a better song to work out to... ill wait

**CreepyMannequin** (10): In high school English we had to do a paper on persuasive techniques in advertising and I chose to do the video for this song, explaining that it served as an advertisement for 50. I only got a 90 but it was a 100 in my heart.

**frogaranaman** (10): “you can find me in the club” summarizes my study abroad experience

**itsabop (hals)** (10): BIG bop!! Haven't heard this in years

**skargardin** (10): I cant with all these classics... wig truly snatched

**TCHALLA1966** (10): what a debut

**zaminizjammin** (10): Still bump this at any public function, club or otherwise!

**gannade** (9.5): a classique

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): Another classic that pops off at socials

**mms82** (9.5): still gets everyone hype in a way I don't think many other songs from this era do

**bespectacIed** (9): 50 Cent's greatest legacy is this song being "sampled" by Somi in Birthday 16 years later. Iconic song tho

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Ariana is shaking at this ennunciation

**rhyneston3** (9): Wow this goes off way harder than I remember

**silentev** (9): Years later and this beat is still infectious.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Obviously iconic and a lot of fun but doesn't really hit like some of these other songs.

**915BEAST** (8): I don’t know why I like this, but I do

**sbb618** (8): Makes too much use of the "orchestra hit" setting on the keyboard, but really catchy in spite of the production, which feels overbearing

**radiofan15** (7.6): Happy Death Day realness in this one.

**slur in username** (7.6): One of the few instances where the censored chorus is much better than the uncensored version.

**1998tweety** (7): I feel like it needs to be catchier but it's ok

**anothertown** (7): this is the quintessential "i'm a cool white mom" song

**rsmitty99** (7): Hot take! 50 cent is very meh

**steelstepladder** (7): It brought the world go shawty it's ya birthday. That's all it needs.

**waluigiest** (7): legendary track and hook. The actual verses are not my favorite.

**fishingfor8** (6): I just listened all the way through this album cause I've been trying to listen to an album a day and thank God Kanye won against 50 Cent cause I do not want to live in a 50 cent world. Also point deducted for homophobic lyric

**static\_int\_husp** (6): lost a point because of, you know, that word

**JustinJSrisuk** (5.5): It’s surprising to consider just how big 50 Cent was during the apex of his career. While he’s now best known as child support-dodging Glacéau investor, he was huge during his heyday in the mid-2000s; looking back now in 2019, it seems like his story was what made him compelling - because if you listen to his mush-mouthed delivery on In Da Club it certainly wasn’t his rapping ability or his innate charisma.

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (5.5): Fuck 50 cent but also I can’t deny that this kinda slaps. Probably would’ve been a 6 or even a 7 had it not been for 50 cent’s homophobic ass throwing out the f-slur.

**CarlieScion** (5): this is so monotone that it negates the greatness of the "go shawty"-part

**MrSwearword** (5): I don't care for it but I don't actively hate it

**rotating3Dtext** (5): did he say…? yeah he did

**runaway3212** (5): Sometimes 50 cent's rapstyle works for me, yet in this song it annoys me.

**williamdowley123** (5): i would say that 50 cent has changed since he wrote that lyric but i dont think he has

**twat\_brained** (4): i'm that what-ass what? once again, fuck 50 Cent. I hate him and I probably always will. the beat goes off but i can't tell you much i can do without this sorry excuse of a Grammy winner.

**vayyiqra** (4): Another great example of "great instrumental, awful lyrics". It does have a lot of meme potential though

**camerinian** (3): I mean good on this song for being a proto-TikTok hit. Shame that means everything after the 30 second mark is totally unnecessary, but ya know, it can have that going for it

**rickikardashian** (2): damn, y'all just let a song saying "faggot" as an insult hit #1. would give it a 0 but the hook is fun

I love this song. The instrumental makes me want to start a revolution, it’s so engaging I just can’t imagine staying still and steady while this is playing. This to me is THE party anthem. It’s like Macklemore is leading a carnival protest and is trying to get more and more people by his side. The choruses with the “ooh, ooh’s” and “na na na’s” make the song accessible even to non-English speakers, it’s just inescapable. You have to join in. I seriously believe this song is going to have a longer legacy than Thrift Shop, or maybe I just want it to. There are not many songs that are this energetic and lively.

---

**1998tweety** (10): Ugh Macklemore and Ryan Lewis were such an iconic duo, the beat and chorus on this are immaculate. [2]

**agentofscranton** (10): they really hit gold with their first two singles huh. shame about the rest of their careers

**camerinian** (10): It's crazy how hard this track still goes, and even if Macklemore himself hasn't really lasted, that production genuinely seems timeless.

**frogaranaman** (10): it’s frustrating how hard this song goes in the club

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I always liked this song more than Thrift Shop and I think I still do! It’s a bop!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Ok but this unironically is such a good song

**MrSwearword** (10): mainly production, but again Macklemore has talent

**radiofan15** (10): Love Kendrick but fuck the Kenny stans who sabotages both this and Thrift Shop...

**rickikardashian** (10): Hey Macklemore, if you see this…. I miss you. Please come back, I want you to be the successful funny white rapper of the moment instead of Lil Dicky

**sbb618** (10): Few hit songs in the last decade are this...high-energy, is probably the word I'm looking for. You hear this song, the verse kicks in, and you just go NUTS for four minutes. It's a hard feeling to capture, but Macklemore and Ryan Lewis pulled it off.

**slur in username** (10): Macklemore is infinitely better with Ryan Lewis by his side producing the tracks

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Still unironically like a lot of Macklemore's stuff

**twat\_brained** (10): This is just such an insane pump up song and it makes me really disappointed Macklemore and Ryan Lewis went their separate ways.

**hikkaru** (9): honestly do not think I've listened to this song in 5 years but it's a bop [2]

**rsmitty99** (9): I honestly put money on Macklemore and Ryan Lewis being a 1 hit wonder after thrift shop. Lost $10

**runaway3212** (9): Simple and incredible

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): I still lose it when this comes on, the piano riff is just so bouncy & the hook is so buoyant

**fishingfor8** (8.5): this song has the most streams of all songs from the first 4 years of this decade so dont tell me this isn't a classic.

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (8.5): Unironically a banger!

**rhyneston3** (8): I want to give this a 10 but I can’t give it the same score as Humble and still expect to get into heaven

**steelstepladder** (8): Those horns go hard

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (8): Why did Thrift Shop become the big Macklemore and Ryan Lewis song when this song is clearly superior in every single way.

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): Can we trade G-Eazy and Machine Gun Kelly for 2012 Macklemore? Thanks.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): u know my white suburban minnesota high school LOST it when this came on at my junior prom

**915BEAST** (7): decent not as good as others

**vayyiqra** (7): I don't remember ever hearing this song, but it's alright, though it's a little too bombastic for its own good. I like the trumpet sample - it's really familiar.

**waluigiest** (7): like most Macklemore songs, the highlights are the moments without Macklemore. Honestly I can’t believe this hit #1 e

**silentev** (6.5): Not as much of a fan of this one but I still can appreciate the beat and the sound.

**ditacarlita** (6): soooooo annoying

**\_wailordfan** (4): Better pop hook and not as cringey as Thrift Shop, but that shark week lyric is just painful

**Roxieloxie** (3): im sorry this song reminds me of my middle school crush i physically cant, he once tried to argue me against that the officer that shot mike brown was not guilty and that just ruined him for me

**anothertown** (2): @macklemore: Me and my homegirl @mileycyrus last night at the turn up function

**bespectacIed** (1): Reparations for the heist winning best rap album over gk, mc

This brings me back to several car rides where this was playing on the radio. I think this song is just adorable and charming. It’s also interesting how B.o.B. was able to collaborate at the time with people like Bruno Mars and Taylor Swift and now they are way bigger than he ever was. Maybe his legacy will be relegated to 2010/2011 but “Nothin’ On You” and “Airplanes” will always have a soft spot in my heart.

**tk note:** easily the best pre-Unorthodox Jukebox song by Bruno

---

**1998tweety** (10): Iconic mega bop, King Bruno Mars killed it. BoB might be a flat earther but he served here too.

**\_wailordfan** (10): I hate how good Bruno's voice works on rap features

**agentofscranton** (10): oh wow i completely forgot about this song’s existence until now and a flood of 2010 nostalgia just flooded my system oh my god

**camerinian** (10): God damn it, BoB. Why couldn't you have just made garbage at your peak so I could properly launch into your bullshit you've pedaled the last few years? Instead I have to acknowledge a really sweet, wholesome song with an incredible hook, amazing production and a really great set of bars. Eat shit Bob.

**mms82** (10): beautiful song

**radiofan15** (10): Flat Eather made some points here...

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (10): I had a crush on Bruno Mars when I was younger so I feel compelled to give this song a 10.

**twat\_brained** (10): What's flatter the Earth or B.o.B's melody? Thank fuck Bruno made this good

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): Gave this a high score cause I associate it with my middle school crushes and it's just an A+ feel good song

**bespectacIed** (9): Always been a massive bop and it thankfully introduced us to Bruno but this is too RnB, it broke the vibe of the entire rate when it played

**fishingfor8** (9): this song is really charming despite it pretty much being a pop song

**frogaranaman** (9): will never fail to mention that I saw BoB in concert, and like during the post-flat earth era. I kinda hated the experience but this song popped off live

**gannade** (9): bruno really peaked here huh

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Remember when b.o.b wasn’t a flat earthier and had hits, and Bruno Mars was still wasn’t a thing until this song? Wild times.

**MrSwearword** (9): Bruno outshines B.o.B by a fuckin' mile and a half

**rhyneston3** (9): This was Bruno’s first big hit right? Wild that it was a feature

**rickikardashian** (9): Pay your taxes dammit, no one wants to get with someone that will end up in jail because they couldn't figure out the amount they need to pay

**runaway3212** (9): The height of B.o.B's career

**sbb618** (9): For like a year, Bruno Mars was just "that producer with the cool voice who shows up on the chorus of songs by other artists", kinda like the male Skylar Grey. Then he dropped an album with five massive multi-platinum singles, and you know the rest. But it's interesting to imagine the alternate path.

**ImADudeDuh** (8): A very cute song that I don't think has been tainted by B.o.B.'s conspiracy theorist ways

**JustinJSrisuk** (8): “you’re the whole package, plus you pay your taxes” huh, I would’ve thought that notorious flat-earther B.o.B. would also be one of those sovereign citizen “taxation is theft” types.

**letsallpoo** (8): this aged surprisingly well

**Roxieloxie** (8): oh a throwback throwback

**skargardin** (8): Bruno pulls his weight here

**steelstepladder** (8): Almost good enough to make me forget about BOB's flat earth theories and antisemitism

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): these were maybe my 2 favorite artists in the world in 2011… I’m glad this came out before I knew who either of them were bc its fine but if it came out when I was obsessed with them both I would’ve been disappointed

**hikkaru** (7.5): flat earther king

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (7.5): Fun song but I can't take B.o.B. seriously anymore lol.

**slur in username** (7.2): Still don’t understand why this song went #1 and not Airplanes when Airplanes seemed like a much bigger, more well-known song

**eigensheep** (7): Remember kids, tax evasion isn't sexy

**silentev** (7): Thank you BOB for singing about the importance of your proposed mate paying their taxes.

**vayyiqra** (7): for being a pretty song with nice synths and Bruno Mar's part being nice, and (+1) for repping the Nintendo 64 (a GOOD console), but also B.o.B. is just less good and more wacko Big Boi from OutKast (who, now I think of it, have a song called "B.O.B." Weird. Maybe that's why I thought that.). Also, someone tell this man that the formula for the volume of a sphere is V = (4/3)πr3.

**915BEAST** (5): b.o.b didn’t make a single solid song

**waluigiest** (5): I truly can’t believe this topped the hot 100 it’s just so milquetoast

**CreepyMannequin** (1): if XXXterminated wasn’t in this rate, this would be my 0. Just abysmal.

I think Rae Sremmurd were the firsts to fully embrace the “rappers are today’s rock stars” theme and turn it into a song. As Swae Lee says: “there is nothing to explain”. Girls of all kinds scream their names, Rae Sremmurd sell out arenas and they perform for thousands of people just like the Beatles used to. They are rich, cool, and confident. While I know the Mannequin Challenge made it popular, it’s quite a nice track and Swae Lee knows how to write a hook. It’s 5 minutes of confidence.

**tk note:** to me this was the definitive turning point in hip hop's explosion to the top of the mainstream. All of the previous huge rap hits from the decade had some sort of meme factor inherent to the song, but nothing about the Mannequin Challenge has anything to do with the music of Black Beatles, but pop audiences listened anyways.

---

**\_wailordfan** (10): another 11 contender, I grew on this song way too late

**CarlieScion** (10): i love lizzo

**CreepyMannequin** (10): The BDE involved in claiming to be related to Paul McCartney despite no evidence to verify that is off the charts.

**fishingfor8** (10): god bless swae Lee

**frogaranaman** (10): I was frozen the entire time I was listening to this song

**jackisboredtoday** (10): ignore the challenge and this is still just an amazing song, the hook is gorgeous

**mms82** (10): honestly the only song that deserved to knock off Closer. Best pre-Tik Tok meme song easily

**radiofan15** (10): Swae "The Voice of our Generation" and the other two guys really did something here...

**thenshecamelikeaaah** (10): Reminds me of the last good internet challenge. Definitely a defining song of the decade and a very fun one at that.

**Roxieloxie** (9): oh shit i forgot about this song. Black kids really fucking define the culture huh, yall would be nowhere without us

**runaway3212** (9): I really liked the mannequin challenge, I hope it comes back one day

**skargardin** (9): Rae Sremmurd honestly deserve better

**twat\_brained** (9): I will forever love Closer but I'm not even that mad this song ended its reign; it holds up rather decent even today.

**camerinian** (8.5): Fuck this song just sounds great, doesn't it? Swae's hook and the beat are just an impossibly brilliant combination, and Jxmmi is

**915BEAST** (8): NOSTALGIA FROM THE MANNEQUIN CHALLENGE (and its a solid banger too)

**ditacarlita** (8): ok this is good but black barbies by nicki is way better

**ImADudeDuh** (8): Truth Hurts SNAPPED

**rhyneston3** (8): Why men great til they gotta be great?

**steelstepladder** (8): The moment I came around on Rae Sremmurd

**waluigiest** (8): mainstream media doesn’t want you to know that this is just Truth Hurts

**1998tweety** (7.5): I don't know why people say Swae Lee has a good singing voice because he absolutely does NOT.

**hikkaru** (7.5): why men great till they gotta be great?

**JustinJSrisuk** (7.5): I’m shocked at how well this holds up. Rae Sremmurd really do have a way with hooks.

**bespectacIed** (7): bom bom bi dom bi dum bum bay

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like this song but it just goes on too long. The chorus is great but the verses are sometimes bleh and drag

**williamdowley123** (7): whole school mannequin challenge (6000 pupils!!) (gone wrong!!!)

**rickikardashian** (6.6): Didn't know you could rap off-key

**TakeOnMeByA-Ha** (6.5): The Beatles are overrated

**slur in username** (5.2): Don’t care for the song but an improvement compared to their horrendous repetitive singles from the first album.

**vayyiqra** (5): What the fuck is this crap? Pass.

**letsallpoo** (4): the way people celebrated when this dethroned closer smh

**MrSwearword** (3): more boring than anything but it's still bad

**silentev** (1): Is this supposed to be off key on purpose because if he going to be making references to beatles or the Beatles or John Lennon then he should meet Yoko Ono.
