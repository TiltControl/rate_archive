The One Direction Solo Rate: 1DHIVE RISE UP!
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/bw0p25/the_one_direction_solo_rate_1dhive_rise_up/

#Welcome To The One Direction Solo Rate
 
Zayn. Harry. Niall. Liam. Louis. Long ago, the five members of One Direction sang live together in musical harmony. Then, everything changed when Zayn left the band in a Facebook post. Only a solo contract, the goal of each member (WHETHER THEY WOULD PUBLICLY ADMIT TO IT OR NOT #MEDIATRAINEDMEGASTARS), could ensure their voices could continue blessing the world, but when the world needed their songs most, they vanished. A hundred years passed and ~~Liam still hasn’t released his debut album~~ u/CarlieScion and I discovered the new Solo King of 1D, an [INSERT RATE RESULTS HERE], and although his [INSERT SOME KIND OF SKILLS THE WINNER HAS] skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe... [WHICHEVER FORMER MEMBER OF 1D WINS THIS RATE] can save the world.  

Gossip Girls Ki and Kina here, your one and only sources into the scandalous One Direction Solo Rate. It’s finally here. We know you’ve been waiting your whole adult lives for this moment, so we won’t spend too much more time ~~shitposting~~ introducing you to this rate.

We’ll be rating three studio albums (Wow! Three whole studio albums! Could be five but whatever!): Zayn’s ‘Mind of Mine’ (MySpace titling is not recognised in this rate), Harry Styles’ ‘Harry Styles’, and Niall Horan’s ‘[Flicker](https://www.spin.com/2017/09/niall-horan-new-album-flicker/)’. In addition, we’ll be rating the assorted single offerings of the two remaining former members of One Direction, Liam Payne and Louis Tomlinson, because they are fucking liars and neither have released a solo album. You know. Like assholes. 

The bonus rate, which we hope you’ll all do anyway but won’t be required to do, is comprised of songs written about members of 1D.

Don’t give your 11s to Sign of the Times!!! xo, your first and best source for 1D shitposting, GoWest          
Give your 11s to Sign of the Times!!! puss puss, Halsey’s wife, Kina

Ready? Go!

Zayn did *not* mess around. Less than a year after leaving One Direction, he started trialling producers for a solo effort, giving us the legendary ‘[@Louis_Tomlinson remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ?](https://twitter.com/zaynmalik/status/595985940461580288?lang=en)’. Ultimately, Mind of Mine was released in March 2016, on the anniversary of his departure from 1D, debuted at #1 on the Billboard 200, and spawned Zayn’s first US #1, his debut single ‘Pillowtalk’.

Harry Styles used to be a baker. The youngest member of One Direction, he got labeled as a heartthrob and womanizer by the tabloid media. Once One Direction broke up went on hiatus, he became known for his fashion style and love for the brand Gucci. His debut album, Harry Styles, was released in early 2017 and is influenced by classic British rock and folk music. The album contains ‘Sign of the Times’ which peaked at #4 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Niall Horan was the last of the One Direction members to release his debut album (not counting the Members Who Shall Not Be Named). When he’s not [cooking unseasoned chicken](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DsoB9thWoAEfsCR.jpg) and being [romantically](https://www.j-14.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/11/iall-horan-katy-perry-relationship.jpg?fit=200%2C1) [linked to](https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/hailee-steinfeld-niall-horan-1534767661.jpg?crop=0.891xw:1.00xh;0.0466xw,0&resize=480:*) [a million different](https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2015/11/24/22/2EC88BC100000578-0-image-a-39_1448405065435.jpg) [pop singers](https://i2-prod.mirror.co.uk/incoming/article9446712.ece/ALTERNATES/s615/MAIN-Niall-Horan-main.jpg), he enjoys golfing. His debut album, Flicker, features 3!!! hit singles and also Maren Morris. Like Harry’s album, it’s rather folk-ish.

###[Liam Payne's solo career of 10 songs](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460491197790683146/574728732397273104/ae496e13bf2bd4f958447bf31b9169fa74ec7a88.jpeg)
 
Liam... Liam... we could have had it all. His debut solo single, ‘Strip That Down’ (handily abbreviated STD, cause that acronym doesn’t stand for anything else!) was released in May 2017, penned by Ed Sheeran, and peaked at #10 on the Billboard Hot 100. Successive follow ups, featuring a variety of collaborators, had less successful commercial performance, to say the least, but we don’t have the time to talk about why. In August 2018, he released his first EP, ‘First Time’, and announced that his album was on hold. But it’s coming. Like. It’s coming. Liaminators.... it’s coming.

Fun fact: Liam was the first member of the remaining four to sign a solo contract and the last to release a solo single.

###[Louis Tomlinson's solo career of 5 songs](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/460491197790683146/574728560149921819/LouisTomlinson-720x720.jpg)
 
Louis’ solo career arrived on the back of a personal tragedy. His debut solo single, ‘Just Hold On’, a collaboration with Steve Aoki, was released shortly after it was announced that his mother, the incomparably lovely Johannah Deakin, had died from cancer. It peaked at #52 on the Billboard Hot 100, but smashed at #1 on the Dance charts. Subsequent follow ups include the Bebe Rexha collaboration ‘Back To You’ and the similarly heartbreaking ‘Two of Us’, about his mother’s death and arriving just before the death of his 18 year old sister Fizzy was announced.

His album, like Liam’s, has been promised ‘soon’ since his solo career began.

###Bonus rate
 
Nothing’s more delicious than some hot goss, so we’d like to offer you a bonus rate steeped in it: each song in the bonus rate was written about a member of 1D (or MEMBERS, @ZAYN), and we think you’ll find them enlightening. 

You don’t have to do any or all of the songs in this bonus rate, but we would love it if you did! There are only six. Cheryl needs to keep Bear Payne clad in Gucci trackies, so, you know, give her a click at least.

###Rules
 
Whether rates are the Story of Your Life or some other 1D reference that makes a similarly vague amount of sense, we’re here to help you.

Here’s how this works: you listen to each song in this rate, assigning each a score between 1 and 10. You may use decimal points, but only to one decimal point. (So, 6.9 is okay, but 4.20 isn’t. Pretend that the 0 is a 1 or something.) 

You must rate every song in the main rate (the songs by the boys themselves); the songs in the bonus rate are optional, you can rate as many (6) or as few (0) as you wish, the programme will adjust no matter how many people rate the bonus songs.

You are allowed ONE (1!!!) 11 and 0, which are supposed to be your favourite and least favourite songs, respectively, and cannot be any of the bonus songs. You must leave a comment (yes, a comment, a few words) justifying these two choices, but you do not have to comment on any of the other songs (though it’s more fun if you do).

We will be on the lookout for sabotage, and it should be known that your scores are not considered confidential. In fact, go ham, feel free to campaign for your favourite boys (Niall), your 11s (Fucker), and your favourite looks on a 1D member (Zayn’s single strand of hair at the 2014 AMAs). 

Use the prepared link, we’ve linked it several places! If you do not use the correct formatting, we may have to reject your ballot, as the machine won’t run it,

What is the correct ballot? Well! Glad you asked! We have an example for you!

**The Only Valid Format:** 

> Pillowtalk: 6.9 Zayn’s MiNd

**Incorrect:** 

> Slow Hands: 10: Niall what is sweat dripping down dirty laundry we’re literally begging you

> Strip That Down: I’m giving this a 0 because I hate fun!

> Back To You: Is Louis a Rexhar or a Bad Bitch 5

> Kiwi: 7.6-Invented ASDAs

> Wonderland: 10 (Suffer, Harry)

That’s it! Feel free to message u/CarlieScion and u/GoWestYoungKanye with any queries or hot goss! Thanks for your time, we hope to see your ballots soon!
