The 1D Solo Rate Day 1: I'm 22 years old... I love a girl named Perrie Edwards.
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ci69jc/the_1d_solo_rate_day_1_im_22_years_old_i_love_a/

Welcome, Zaddies and Harries and Louies and Niallers and Liaminators, to day one of the reveal of the 1D Solo Rate. We're your hosts, GoWest and /u/CarlieScion, and we hope you're ready for a bloodbath.

Today we'll be revealing songs 51-35, and 6-5 of the bonus rate, **starting at 3PM EST**. Join us in the popheads [plug.dj](https://plug.dj/popheads/?refuid=6335203), we're begging you.

Some quick rate stats to keep in mind:

* 63 people participated! That's more people than bought Liam's debut EP! Incredible!

* The top 3 were consistent in the last few days of the rate, but switched places with each other numerous times and Kina and I almost lost our minds.

* The main rate contained no albums female artists!

* The bonus rate did contain some singles by them though. #Feminism.

* The average score was 7.038. So yall liked these songs, but you didn't love them. I'll be reporting you haters to Modest! Management.

* The average controversy score is 2.015, so any song with a controversy score above this should be considered controversial.

***

Songs will be crossed off as the reveal progresses.

---

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): yeah, the refusal to say ‘fuck’ is really weird. yeah, this is a hardcore ballad. but i still love it, because it’s an incredible showcase of his vocal talents and at the end of the day, i’m a weak bitch for a wobbly cry voice.

**CarlieScion** (5): First out of the rate, we have this badly produced ballad. The lyrics themselves are nothing too bad (or too good), but why. did. they. not. let. him. say. fuck. This song gives me nothing, but luckily it doesn’t go on for too long. Liam’s voice is on point as always.

---

**followingfreeways** (9): if more of liams music sounded like this i would probably love him more,

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): why couldn't they let him say fuck???

**lilacsweetener** (8): should've been a single, his best song aside from Get Low, as usual another pop star that actually has substance if they let themselves open up a bit

**eklxtreme** (7): this couldve been a bpp

**surelychoo** (7): bruh if you don't want to saying fucking just use another word. what's the point of censoring if you know the meaning behind it

**tinaoe** (7): his voice is pretty af lbr

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): this should've come out before bedroom floor tbh... it wouldn't be a hit but it would show him making a less disposable track and displaying range

**martymcflurry** (6.5): Let Liam Say Fuck

**1998tweety** (6): Liam I want massive bops, don't give me ballads (although this isn't awful).

**NotWith10000Men** (6): i like his voice better than zayn's, he can carry a simple song better

**pjatteryd** (6): Why isn’t all his music like this??

**vhqv1997** (6): Just say fuck Liam nobody is gonna even be surprised by it

**ignitethephoenix** (5): it’s boring sorry

**ggodisawomann** (4.5): also meh

**J\_Toe** (4): two things: 1. piano ballads shouldn't be mandatory for music projects. 2. Just looked at the EP artwork properly. Why are there 2 Liams?

**ImADudeDuh** (3): This EP is so bland, literally every other song of his is so much better

**realboxwood** (2): This lost points for implying the word fucking without actually saying it, it stands out so much in a bad way

**waluigiest** (2): Adele if Adele was a bad songwriter and had bland melodies and arrangements

**Leixander** (1): i guess every release needs a ballad and this is the one

**radiofan15** (1): Is he trying to chanel Adele here with a song that might have worked better as one of his over-produced Bland&B songs?

**rickikardashian** (1): …..just say fucking

**selegend** (1): what the hell is this vocal production

**Novuspyra** (0): That aborted F bomb can choke.

**skargardin** (0): Am I supposed to take this ballad seriously? Ridiculously bad lyrics, the whole thing is just a boot

**yourhostandpatron** (0): Bahahaha. This uses the exact same formula as Bad Day and 7 Years do, right down to the piano, the annoying white guy vocals, and the terrible lyrics trying to be emotive when they ain’t really all that, and, oh, my god, the end result is almost unbearingly painful. At least Strip That Down was an entertaining atrocity. Depend On It, by contrast, is completely devoid of almost any humanity to it despite trying to convince us of just the opposite. You can hear why the relationship Liam’s singing about is going to shit just from the music alone. The most embarrassing moment is Liam going ‘ffff-’ (Fflewddur Fflam!), which is just suffocating proof that he hasn’t learned anything from the negative reaction to Strip That Down. I mean, good heavens, my dear Mr. Payne, what could you be tryin to say? Fencing? Flogging? Farming? Did Liam’s girlfriend own a dairy farm? Depend On It is just sad, and that’s a different sad than what Liam intended. What a pitiable tragedy.

**CarlieScion** (10): Am I really going to have to be one of the only bitches to defend this? Well, shit. This song is right up my alley. I don’t care about the cringey ‘brr brr’, I don’t care that this is 100% mellow sex-playlist fodder for the Spotify generation. It sounds sexy. Liam’s voice sounds good. This song is not as offensive or bad as you guys make it out to be, jees.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): this is so fucking bad. literally unbelievable. and since it purports itself to be serious, i can’t even hate-bop to it like strip that down. do you know how much work it is pretending to like liam’s music? none of us can do it anymore. can i PLEASE have the chance to redo his entire career, oh my god.

#The Minority With Taste


**hikkaru** (10): bop

**eklxtreme** (9.5): catchy af

**ggodisawomann** (7.5): so corny but it still bangs!!! I hate the iPhone iPhone rings tho

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I have...very mixed feelings about Bedroom Floor, if I’m being honest! It’s a way better song than either Strip That Down or Get Low, which is probably because of the gospel influences sneakily present in it, but it’s nothing I haven’t heard before, and, I must say, I am incredibly tired of Liam talking about sex and trying to be edgy. It’s the same formula Zayn tired to go for and he does it even more questionably than said man. But, all things considered, this is a decent use of that formula, so I suppose I’ll have to let it be.

**J\_Toe** (7): was okay with this song till I heard the "phone rings brr brr " bit, lol

**Verdantshade** (7): this one's actually a good pop song but that iphone lyric lol


#You All Suck

**tinaoe** (6): his falsetto's pretty as always

**vhqv1997** (6): Charlie you should have kept this song for yourself you would have made it so much better

**waluigiest** (6): yeah okay you fuck Liam I get it

**Leixander** (5.5): bonus points for brrp brrp because that's hilarious af

**lilacsweetener** (5): It sounds weirdly dated and kind of corny but the momentum in the chorus stops me from hating it.

**surelychoo** (5): best line: "and every now and then my iPhone, iPhone rings brr brr" jaflsdkhfalsf also the drama of Bella Thorne being in the mv when Charlie Puth wrote this lmao

**radiofan15** (4.5): The chorus shows a lot of promise and it's deceptively catchy, but it's in such a dire need of SOMEONE ELSE PERFORMING IT (think of someone like Timberlake or Mars), someone with a less annoying falsetto… unfortunately, even that can't distract me of how awful are those verses and how hilarious is the iPhone ringtone emulation.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.4): such a lightweight track that i can't remember it even when i'm still listening to it

**1998tweety** (4): Sorry Liam, I would definitely love to have my clothes on your bedroom floor, but this song is not that great. There are many questionable lines on this song, and his falsetto on the chorus does not sound good.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): with a different chorus it would have been like a six

**NotWith10000Men** (4): big no

**skargardin** (4): No...

**grandmafriend** (3): meh

**realboxwood** (3): I couldn’t have told you how this song goes even while I was actively listening to it

**saucymac** (3): brrt brrt

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3): Man, Liam's falsetto gets grating quickly on this song. Honestly the best part is the "brr brr" for the phone call.

**Raykel** (2): Oh his vocals are terrible in the chorus

**believedcrazy** (0): hate the video hate the song

**ignitethephoenix** (0): This song has good production but it was generic and repetitive and annoying.

**letsallpoo** (0): why does the line go "every now my iphone ring". that doesnt make sense liam. why do you do this to me. also i think the fact that bella thorne is the lead in the mv should be discussed more

**pjatteryd** (0): I hate it, especially the iPhone namedropping! I can't find one thing about this song that I like. Horrible!!!

**xmxlxo** (0): Strip That Down's corny lyrics but more repetitive and without the assist of an It Wasn't Me sample

**CarlieScion** (8): We continue with the Liam slaughter! This song is so damn catchy and the production is on point. It’s a collab that makes sense in my head, but it also 10% sounds like a filler track on Views. Actually it’s like Drake meets Wild Thoughts. I like both of those things, so I digg this - but y’all don’t apparently.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5.1): so. this ep. if you imagine me as a supermodel esque blonde with a constant headache due to one direction and especially liam, you’re correct. this ep is a nightmare for me. like, this song is cute, but it’s nothing. even liam’s adlibs (if you listen to a liam song for the first time, listen for the adlibs, they’re important) can’t save it. french montana is nothing.

---

#Picking Up On The First Ring

**1998tweety** (9): The beginning of this reminded me of I Like It, I'm assuming that's intentional. Would it be slightly messy to say that this song makes me feel like a bit of a mobster? Cause that's kind of the vibe I'm getting. Montana surprisingly doesn't ruin this, probably cause his verse is so quick that he doesn't get the chance to do so.

**eklxtreme** (8): kind of a bop but it's so short

**ggodisawomann** (8): why do I like French Montana

**martymcflurry** (7.3): This sounds like I Like It meets Hotline Bling.

**believedcrazy** (7): its good

**hhiggy** (7): i like the production but french montana's verse was awful

**rickikardashian** (7): This is honestly the type of music that Latin artist have been doing lately, and I really think that if he just switched languages he'd end up just being J Balvin or Maluma 2

**skargardin** (7): Has French ever elevated a song?

**waluigiest** (7): some of it’s wet but some is really not

#Sending Liam Payne Straight To Voicemail

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Liam has finally decided to collaborate with a person who actually makes RnB and hip hop aside from Quavo, which is good, although we aren’t exactly getting the best of the best with French Montana. It’s a real shame the end result is only more or less slightly above average. I don’t know if it’s the fact that either one or both of the two guys here fail to succeed in being good performers (well, that would not surprise me by any means) or if the song is just boring, but I never want to think about it again. That being said, there are still some promising elements here that at least let you have a glimmer of hope for this EP. Too bad! That glimmer is going away soon.

**followingfreeways** (6): i forget what this song sounds like the second it ends

**realboxwood** (6): I do like the piano chords on this, Luigi’s Mansion teas

**surelychoo** (6): meh Hotline Bling knockoff

**NotWith10000Men** (5): pretty generic verses

**saucymac** (5): Is Liam as much of a player as he thinks he is tho?

**lilacsweetener** (4): you can only try ripping off despacito once liam

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): This song is kind of a mess musically and I've never gotten the sense that French Montana has ever been a pop artist's first choice for a rap feature.

**ufohyde** (3): WHO THE HELL is paying money for these French Montana features??? Just donate it to charity instead cause this ain't it.

**radiofan15** (2.5): What is aqthis song trying to do? This ain't trashy or chill enough to be something more than a bad taste joke.

**Leixander** (2): okay liam you are not a virgin we know you have a baby and you had the audacity to name him bear and scar him for life

**pjatteryd** (2): iTs LiKe YoU pUt A sPeLl On Me

**tinaoe** (2): did not know this song exists

**CarlieScion** (10): I really included my favorite artist ever in this bonus rate just to watch her crash and burn, huh? Ashley Frangipane is indeed Halsey. She made this song way way back, back when she was only another One Direction fan with a tumblr blog and a guitar. Before she wrote this, she wrote The Haylor Song (which has been scrubbed from the internet - if I had found a link to the song that’s not on a sketchy chinese website, it would have been rated instead of this). It was a really weird and slut-shamey song, a parody of I Knew You Were Trouble. This, on the other hand, focuses more on her personal yearning for this boy she has never even met and who will probably never know she exists (hah, look how that turned out!). It’s a brilliant song when you focus on the fact that it’s just Halsey + a guitar, without any expensive recording equipment or producers. According to y’all, however, it doesn’t deserve any praise.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): oh girl. (sorry kina, i just can’t do this lmaoooooo. but gasoline is a rate winner to me!)

#Kina Will Spare You

**eklxtreme** (10): her voice is beautiful stripped down

**Leixander** (10): https://i.ibb.co/LzGWRZN/halsey.png

**radiofan15** (10): Talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it... I wanna hear more of this Ashley girl, she can be out next main pop girl!

**Verdantshade** (10): lol bless halsey I relate sm

**tinaoe** (9): 2013 tumblr me loved it

**1998tweety** (7): Rihanna shook

**vhqv1997** (7): This sounds a lot like a demo, so I can't give it a truly good score, but I like where it was going for, and I do think it could have been great if it was more refined and improved

#Good Luck!

**numberonejobrosstan** (6.4): girl….

**surelychoo** (6): omg I didn't know Halsey was a harrie.......

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): omg what is this

**martymcflurry** (5): “Though your girls got an album that’s better than mine” Very that though. This gets points purely for being hysterical

**realboxwood** (5): This is so funny

**rickikardashian** (5): thinking this was written by a fan halsey about harry it’s just making me way too uncomfortable

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (5): Took me a hot second to realize this was Halsey

**pjatteryd** (4): It feels sad, and not in a good way lol

**waluigiest** (4): excuse me WHAT

**ggodisawomann** (3): no I'm sorry

**grandmafriend** (1.5): Halsey .. girl ..

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (1): never heard of it before. Never wanna hear it again. It's just so cringy Tumblr teenage girl.

**TragicKingdom1** (1): this somehow sounds more like something you'd hear someone performing at a mall than the infamous blink-182 video

**ufohyde** (1): A nightmare...a literal nightmare. Stream Nightmare by Halsey.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): this is so forgettable i really don’t know what i can even say about it.

**CarlieScion** (2): This is one of the only songs in the rate that I actually despise. It’s repetitive, the vocal production is bad, the melody is nothing, the song is nothing. It’s filler in the worst interpretation of the word. It’s devoid of literally anything that makes me care or remember the song more than 5 seconds after I listened to it.

#Telling The Truth

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh damn this is p cool

**eklxtreme** (8): a vibe, albeit a repetitive one

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is pretty chill, but the chorus is kind of annoying and ruins the vibe. There are some awesome things going on in the background with the production that safe the track, it gives me a bit of a casino vibe if that makes sense.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I’m betting ten to one on Popheads booting this out early thanks to being labelled as boring due to being an even slower song compared to the tracks off the first half of Mine of Mind, but, damn, if Zayn’s voice doesn’t suit the chorus’s flow incredibly well! Maybe Truth isn’t something that’s guaranteed to capture your attention right away (I still think that there’s way better stuff behind it), but it’s more pleasing to the ear than I thought initially.

**believedcrazy** (7): good but forgettable

**surelychoo** (7): I still don't see the truth even 3 1/2 years later

#Just Straight Up Lying

**martymcflurry** (6.1): I'm falling asleep...these are all blending together

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): same as in border I can never remember what this one sounds like. But I like it while listening to it, I guess?

**realboxwood** (6): I like the glittering synths and the warm, quiet guitar chords. That’s all I got, sorry.

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (6): Why is it so hard to remember how Zayn songs go I'm grasping at straws now

**waluigiest** (6): not bad and production is cool, but pretty uninspiring

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): the verse is so good but then the chorus is so generic!!

**ignitethephoenix** (5): This is just boring and drags on too much even if it has a good vibe.

**roxieloxie** (5): I feel alseep the first time i heard this

**radiofan15** (4.9): His producers really snapped here TBH!

**Leixander** (4): say the truth uwu uwu uwu uwu uwu

**vhqv1997** (4): This is such a passive-agressive way to say you hate your ex-co-workers Zayn

**pjatteryd** (3): I don't like it, boring

**tinaoe** (3): forgettable lbr

**numberonejobrosstan** (0): this was my 1st time listening to this song since the album came out & i just find it to be very boring and it goes nowhere

**Verdantshade** (0): lol I probably heard this song at least 20 times when mind of mine was released and I still can't recognise the song. there's so many more offensive songs on this rate but this is so forgettable that it's getting my 0

**CarlieScion** (6): We’re back on the Liam slaughter! 5 songs in and he has already lost 40% of his discography. This doesn’t really sound like a Liam song to me - it seems more up Zayn’s alley for some reason. The production is just really weird, none of the instrumentals match up. I feel like this could have been a much tighter and better song if someone had just told the producer to like. Stop. Before they reached this point.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): this is straight out of 2008. little known fact, home with you is an interpolation of another liam song, the absolutely incredible (and i’m not joking, please listen to it) [tell your friends](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLaMFakqam8), and it’s absolutely fucking garbage. i hate it to my core. spill the tea? shut the fuck up. it gets points solely for being about cheryl, because i love gossip.

---

#Home (The 1D Song)

**waluigiest** (9): surprisingly nice! I cringed at the tea line a bit but it’s neat and the chorus works

**surelychoo** (8): one of Liam's better ones, but I don't understand why his songs are always ruined by some outdated effect or cringy lyric (the adlib comments, "joshin'", "too many cooks in the kitchen")

**ufohyde** (8): I love the way Liam insist on saying phrases he has no business saying like "spill the tea" and "skrt skrt"

**eklxtreme** (7): strip that doun

**NotWith10000Men** (7): cute little song. I like the hoOoOome part

**vhqv1997** (7): The bridge with those instrumentals is the only good part of this song

#Home (This Song)

**rickikardashian** (6.7): I'm not sure if I hate or love the fact that he just so casually used the phrase "spill the tea". Gay legend

**ignitethephoenix** (6): I didn’t need to hear Liam say spill the tea today.

**J\_Toe** (6): I don't know, something sounds off about this song. Like, there's too much? And the electronic steel drums don't help.

**kappyko** (6): spill that tea king

**skargardin** (5): meh

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): I kind of like the production on this but the hook is so bad lol Liam why

**yourhostandpatron** (5): For fuck’s sake, Liam, why do you sound so bored here? Is that an unintentional reflection of this song’s quality? This chorus is already dull, so that’s no surprise; why are you mumbling it over, then? Really, Liam’s attempts to sound more personal and stray away from the farcical hedonism of his previous music is at least a step in the right direction, although that’s something he miserably fails in most of the time, but why has he seemingly lost all interest in fulfilling this goal? Is he admitting to himself that he wants to make stupid, water-downed party songs? What’s going on here?

**radiofan15** (4.6): What's up with Liam and bland tracks with subdued chorus that goes absolutely nowhere performed with the charm of a broken spork?

**ggodisawomann** (4): meh

**ImADudeDuh** (4): The production is pretty good, but pretty much everything else is bad but most importantly DID LIAM JUST SAY SPILL THE TEA ASKJVNSKDJVNDKFJSV

**pjatteryd** (3): I think its too busy

**Leixander** (2): but i heard it all before

**realboxwood** (2): The use of slang like “spill the tea” vs “you must be joshing me” makes Liam sound like an uncool dad desperately trying to relate to the kids, which I mean, well,

**1998tweety** (0): Spill the tea? There are so many weird (and borderline cringey lines on this track). The chorus comes out of nowhere too and honestly does not sound good.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): louis knows dope production. @ liam. fucking. please.

**CarlieScion** (6): Pour one out for Louis, because he just lost his first song of the day. Louis has a really small discography, which means that he has (or have to be) really selective about the music he releases. Because of that, I don’t really understand WHY in god’s name he released this. It sounds like filler, the lyrics are whiny and to be honest, it doesn’t showcase his vocals in the best light. Points added for the really smooth production, though.

---

#Celebrity Worship

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (9): I love this one more than I would like to admit

**lilacsweetener** (9): I'm mostly rating this high for the insane production. Listen on headphones even the opening music sort of slithers into your ear. Pure ear candy the way Louis's voice blends with the music and effects. The lyrics don't really work...is he like us or is his life totally different? I see what he means but also it falls apart the second you think about the fact that he's a world famous millionaire. Which is the tragedy of it all I guess. He can never be "just like us" anymore.

**waluigiest** (9): this is DAMP

**eklxtreme** (8): catchy but kinda awkward drop

**xmxlxo** (7.9): "It's the guy from the one band" is at least better than "You know I used to be in 1D"

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is ok, it doesn't bop as hard as it should and I don't really like a lot of the lyrics.

**believedcrazy** (7): its a bit boring sorry

**followingfreeways** (7): cringy but catchy...

**ignitethephoenix** (7): A little too on the nose for me to feel fully sympathetic.

**tinaoe** (7): meh

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I like or love all of Louis’s songs in this rate, but Just Like You is the closest I get to not being excited to hear more of his music. It has a rather pleasant quality to it that I enjoy a lot, and Louis sounds so sweet here that I find it hard to accuse him of being condescending. Maybe I’m not as cynical as other critics of capitalism, but perhaps rich celebrities trying to reach out to us is the first sign of a slightly less chaotic end to the system...with that being said, this song doesn’t pack as much of a punch as Louis’s other singles, and maybe I’m going a bit too far into the other side, but as sincere as I think Louis is being here, I don’t think I’m wrong to find the music video to Just Like You to be a little bit...weird? Is it just me, or is the idea of connecting a song like this to actual hate crimes just a little bit odd? But, ah, whatever. I can’t be mad at Louis.

#Is Louis Even A Human Being

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): not a huge fan of the production but i honestly like the lyrics

**surelychoo** (6): lovely song and voice but the lyrics, oh god the cringe

**Verdantshade** (6): love the lyrics but it's such a forgettable song

**radiofan15** (5.3): I'm sure Louis Tomlinson has his share of fans but I can't imagine them feeling relieved that this is the kind of material he releases as a solo artist… unless there delusional.

**ggodisawomann** (5): Louis's solo shit is mostly meh

**jackisboredtoday** (4.1): for a song that wants to be relatable he spends a lot of the song explaining things only he can relate to, followed by stuff that's so vague i can't latch onto it at all

**pjatteryd** (4): Celebrities: they’re just like us!

**vhqv1997** (4): I'm sorry but pop stars on the same level as Louis will never be able to be classified as "just like normal people". Yes, you can make the argument that you're not free from problems and stress and depression and everything, but purposefully making a song to humanize yourself and gain some empathy points is so narcissistic to the point of harmful. Am I too harsh here? Yes, I admit, but there has been a terrible culture of celebrities appealing to their fans by pretending to be relatable, while in reality being extremely conceited. Louis could have had good intentions while writing this song, and I will never know how much of this song is true nor his intention behind writing it. But even if I leave all of that aside, telling people that you're just like them is such a bad idea to go about it. How about you just write something that IS relatable in a specific way, rather than telling others that you are?

**Leixander** (3): okay but i am not a millionaire, make it happem

**realboxwood** (3): "Nobody cares when you're boring." Correct!

**ImADudeDuh** (2): this song feels like louis is just saying one long "who can relate? WOO!"

#Damn Ricki Tell Us How You Really Feel 

**rickikardashian** (0): I just can't stand this song. After releasing one of my favorite songs from the year, I had high expectations from whatever Louis would pull out, and it was this. It's just so obnoxious and empty. It comes off as just another singer going like "Hey, I'm not just another self-absorbed superstar, I'm actually like you, I'm relatable, we are like friends, and you can support our friendship listening to my music", and I'm sure this wasn't the real intention of the song, but it truly comes off as a song written by a room of corporates managing the career of an unnamed up and coming teen idol. This is just "Ordinary Superstar" by Rina Sawayama, but unironically, it straight up uses the same line in the chorus. His singing in the chorus is also weirdly obnoxious and it sounds as if it was talking down to the listener, as if it was trying to convince a child of something. The production is actually really nice, and if it had absolutely any other lyrics it would probably just we like a 6 and instead of this essay I would just write "it's generic but it bops", but the fact that the only thing that I seem to remember from this song are the bad parts, and that it annoyed me so much that I made myself listen to it more times to see if I would end up liking it and not giving it a 0, makes me want to give it even more.

**CarlieScion** (4): This song could have been so much better if it just wasn’t so long and slooooooow. It’s underproduced and Zayn’s vocals are whiny. There’s nothing to focus on for nearly four!!!! Minutes. The chorus could have been so good - it sounds almost magical at points, but combined with the equally minimalist verses, me no bueno.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): i think he sounds awful on this, i think this song is awful, the sparse instrumentation is awful, everything about it is awful. at least i was spared hearing this live on a tour.

#Oh Kappy :(

**kappyko** (11): I love organ&b baby  

#People Kappy Will Not Ban

**Verdantshade** (10): fantastic vocals, frank ocean vibes. unfortunately nothing else zayn has released has matched this

**lilacsweetener** (9): Hauntingly beautiful.

**Raykel** (9): Only flaw is that sometimes the snare is distracting but this is gorgeous

**surelychoo** (9): (in this case the uppercase-lowercase seizure writing format is appropriate) croon me to sleep Zayn

**vhqv1997** (9): I like this, it takes a while to get going, but it's chill and soothing, reminds me of Frank Ocean

**waluigiest** (9): I love his voice so much god I’m so gay sometimes. The chorus…….. king of melisma

**poppinmmolly** (8): haunting!

**realboxwood** (8): Carried by a somber organ and wistful strings, for once Zayn manages to sound vulnerable instead of just self-satisfied.

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Holy cow, guys, how annoying was it to type out all these random capital letters? Did you just copy and paste the song titles from Wikipedia? I sure hope you did for your own sanity. About the song itself: It’s You is, to me, an encouraging sign that most of Mind of Mine is not as much of a drag as some people would have you think. I’m sure that to some people here, songs as slow as this would last forever, but even if It’s You could stand to be just a little more interesting, it’s sweeth, soothing and pleasant to the ears; it’s lacking in some areas, sure, but it’s nowhere near devoid of enjoyability.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Decent ballad

**pjatteryd** (7): It feels dreamy

#Did The Sub's Founder Deserve This You Ingrates

**1998tweety** (6.5): This is ok. There are bits I like and bits I don't. It feels forgettable but it's not bad. The instrumental is nice at bits but Zayn's vocals counteract it.

**eklxtreme** (6): iT's NoT iT

**followingfreeways** (6): i always skip this one..just not good..not a good job zaynie.

**ggodisawomann** (6): a lil underwhelming but still good

**martymcflurry** (5.5): his voice is gorgeous but this is boring.

**believedcrazy** (5): its fine

**radiofan15** (4.6): Maybe if someone more energetic and interested would have sing this one I would have enjoyed it way way more… as it is, it's the perfect cure for insomnia, but at least the instrumental is nice.

**skargardin** (4): ridiculously boring

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): This one just sounds like a store-brand Frank Ocean song at best (likely because Zayn got Malay to produce alot of this album), and every one of the ten-second "it's yoooooooou"s go on just long enough to get grating.

**NotWith10000Men** (3.5): his voice isn't unique enough to carry such a minimal song

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (3): it's just so slow

**hikkaru** (3): this is so boring wtf

**grandmafriend** (2): I fell asleep halfway through

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (1): Honestly this was one of the few songs I disliked a lot out of the album, it just was really clunky and Zayn didn't fit in at all here huh

**InfernalSolstice** (0): zayn's voice and music irritates me a lot but the complete lack of energy on this combined with those two factors makes it the pinnacle of why i dislike him

**Leixander** (0): i just don't like his voice i guess

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): imagine being me. [redacted] for liam. waiting for his first solo single for months, then years. addicted to playing the juicy j snapchat beat on a loop. he looks kinda naked in the teasers. then you learn it’s called ‘strip that down’. quavo, a noted homophobe and then the rapper of the month, is featured on it. you are on a plane to the us and when you land in newark (YEAH I WAS IN FUCKING NEWARK AIRPORT) you find out that there was a clue about the lyrics in the city in europe you just left six or so hours before, and you don’t get a retweet from liam for finding it. you find out that the lyric, ‘used to be in 1d / now i’m out free’ is real. you get food poisoning because it’s fucking newark. and then it’s release day. the song kinda leaks five minutes before. you brace yourself. and it’s the worst thing you’ve ever heard. you post it to popheads. you learn ed sheeran wrote it. you die inside. fast forward a year later, and now you can have a little bit of humour about this song, and it charted okay, but it’s still pretty fucking bad. but it’s fun, and liam [redacted] me, so it’s a five.

**CarlieScion** (4): Possibly the most trend-chasing song in this entire rate, Strip That Down suffers from generally bad lyrics, a Quavo feature and a melody that makes me want to leave whatever place is playing this song. This is one of the most controversial songs in this rate, many thanks to u/leixander for that ironic 11.

#The Bravest People On This Sub

**Leixander** (11): you know i used to be 1D (that's not me), the lyrical genius this has

**1998tweety** (10): This is a huge bop and y'all trash it for no reason. One of my favourite verses from Quavo. Liam exudes so much sexiness and cockiness on this track.

**followingfreeways** (10): you all just hate fun dont you

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song fucks, don't @ me

**kappyko** (10): bop idc

**letsallpoo** (10): i dont fucking care anymore

**selegend** (10): so hilariously bad it’s good

**ignitethephoenix** (9): If you ignore the corny lines, it’s a bop and it gets too much hate on here.

**poppinmmolly** (9): this is a bop y'all are just mean

**believedcrazy** (8): issa bop

**hikkaru** (8): i ironically stan this song it's so bad yet i BOP to it every time

**martymcflurry** (8): You know what it’s a fun bop

**pjatteryd** (8): This song is awful but at the same time it’s the best song ever released.

**realboxwood** (8): This is the fresh McDonalds french fry of songs, trashy in a good way

**saucymac** (8): lmao this song is so bad its good

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): hearing this dated hot mess of a song made me realize i'm nostalgic for Mustardwave

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): fine for background music. But I used to be in 1D is still a stupid line

**bluetriangles04** (7): hashtag AssCracksOut4Liam

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its not as bad as everyone made it out to be, but still cringy a bit.

**J\_Toe** (7): ugh this song plays ALL THE TIME at my gym. Also, specifically because I'm submitting this late, I can confirm that Liam has now followed the instructions set by this title :P

**skargardin** (7): I remember giving this a ridiculously low score in the jukebox and I have to admit that I may have been wrong, this is a bop

**waluigiest** (7): I don’t want to like this but I kind of do

#Slighty Less Brave

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): hm. didn't know this was liam. interesting?

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (6.5): How did every other person have a really personal or big single and then Liam comes in and gives us this

**numberonejobrosstan** (6): why is quavo… here. also “used to be in 1d” is the most headass line i’ve ever heard... still kinda a bop tho

**lilacsweetener** (5): So, so catchy, works well in a club setting and the video is very pretty/diverse, but oh man...those lyrics...no....no....noooooooo....

**xmxlxo** (5): Who asked for an It Wasn't Me sample in 2017?

**rickikardashian** (4.9): Not gonna lie, first time I heard "I used to be in 1D, now I'm out free" I felt betrayed and attacked. 1D is life, 1D is family

**grandmafriend** (4): couldve been more but minus one for the 1d line alone lol

**tinaoe** (4): please liam

**ufohyde** (4): The fact 15 people wrote this and NONE of them bothered to fix it 💀

**yourhostandpatron** (3): This is one of the most comical songs I’ve ever heard. It’s not as mind-bogglingly awful as some of the other stuff I’ve had to listen to, but it’s such a devastating blot on the rest of Liam’s career that it’s almost impossible for me not to experience an urge to laugh whenever I have to stream it. For those of you who don’t get me: have you ever realized the initials to this song are STD? Have you ever tried to repeat that terrible pre-chorus to yourself over and over? Have the words ‘You know I used to be in 1D/Now I’m free’ ever embedded themselves into your mind for all time? Have you considered that there’s no actual reason for those lyrics to be in there at all except for the sake of being edgy? Like, hoo boy, say what you want about the various mistakes Zayn’s made over the course of trying to go solo, but, hoo, boy, this is even worse. The Quavo feature just makes it even more funny. Elite liked this song, by the way.

**vhqv1997** (2): Shape Of You but worse. The fact this had FIFTEEN writers is insane.

#The 0s

**hhiggy** (0): this song is going to get a lot of zeroes but let's be honest it deserves it

**radiofan15** (0): OMG where do I start? The Mustard-lite beat is more basic and outdated than a Chris Brown deep cut, the lyrics are lamer than a episode of Under The Dome (I can't believe Ed Sheeran co-wrote this), those deep vocals in the chorus are atrociously laughable, Quavo puts some needed energy in his quick verse but it's not enough to overcome this frat-boy trashy dump… and any minimal salvageable thing that could be said about this song (it's kinda catchy in a rat kinda way) is ruined by the now memetic "I used to be in 1D (now I'm free", which is quite ironic because he's the most outspoken member advocating for a reunion.

**Raykel** (0): Name one good thing about this song quickly

**surelychoo** (0): I hate fun

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (0): This song is so fucking bad in so many ways. You can pretty much immediately tell Ed Sheeran wrote this, because it sounds like all of his worst, most insufferable tracks. Liam's nondescript voice maybe saves it a little, as the only thing I think could have made this song any more punchable was having to listen to Ed the whole time. The storebrand DJ Mustard beat sounds 3 years out of date, not that it would have sounded good if this song came out in 2013. This is also peak Quavo oversaturation, with one of his many uninteresting throwaway verses coming and going with no impact. I haven't even touched on the "1D now I'm free" line, but I'm sure most of the other comments on this song will tear it to shreds so I'll just end it here.

MrSwearword: > ThereIsNoSantaClaus (0): This song is so fucking bad in so many ways. You can pretty much immediately tell Ed Sheeran wrote this, because it sounds like all of his worst, most insufferable tracks. Liam's nondescript voice maybe saves it a little, as the only thing I think could have made this song any more punchable was having to listen to Ed the whole time.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): the kazoo shit is so weird and when people just say ‘woman’ i think of all the misogynistic husbands on sitcoms that are like ‘woman get in here!’

**CarlieScion** (0): Another controversial song out! Woman is my 0 simply because I cannot stand to listen to it. The annoying spoken intro, the generally bad production, the fucking kazoo and the bad, whiny and condesending lyrics. I don’t think Harry has ever sounded worse - both vocally and as a person. I hate everything about it and I want back all the time I’ve spent listening to or thinking about this song.

**mkat89** (11): my favorite song from my favorite 1D-boy-gone-solo

**numberonejobrosstan** (10): i’ve been obsessed w this song since DAY. ONE.

**pjatteryd** (10): Amazing!! A solid song

**realboxwood** (10): Truly so much going on in this song! The humming under the outro! The “ay!" before the second verse! “This thing upon me howls like a beast, you flower, you feast”! The duck sound! I could go on, it was truly a close close call between this and my actual 11.

**surelychoo** (10): I LOVE THE DUCK NOISE. BEST SONG OF THE ALBUM FIGHT ME.

**Verdantshade** (10): sHoUlD wE jUst sEarCh rOManTic coMedIes oN NetFliX aND theN sEe wHat wE FiNd QUACK this song is gay af though and the guitar solo is killer

**lilacsweetener** (9): I don't listen to this much anymore but it's still a fave. Didn't expect a Prince song on Harry's first record, that's for sure.

**poppinmmolly** (9): I love this song but WHAT is that sound effect? It sounds like someone is hitting a goose every beat.

**radiofan15** (8.8): All of the DUCK jokes among the stans when this song came out kinda dismissed the fact that this song is really good, spacey and another surefire hit had it been released in the 70s.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Definitely one of the most throwback-heavy songs on the album, it almost sounds like a mid-70s Wings track to me. I could definitely see Paul McCartney singing this, and I'd consider that a compliment.

**waluigiest** (8): it feels like humid summertime l

**yourhostandpatron** (8): An odd choice of a dark horse for Harry Styles; Woman isn’t as lively as some of the other songs off this debut album, and it represents a more subdued yet still surprisingly intense version of classic rock music from decades ago that can quite possibly be more interesting songs to some than so-called bangers like Carolina or Kiwi. As for myself? All that needs to be said is that even if I don’t think this is a spectacular song, it definitely deserves to be a solid offer for Harry and his fans. It’s not my thing, exactly, but it is very good.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): it's chill, would be cool to experience live

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): his voice is so good in the "i'm selfish I know" part

**believedcrazy** (7): ever since the duck quacks were pointed out i like it less

**followingfreeways** (7): im sorry i cant get over the stupid duck noises it was a bad choice harry a bad choice (i know its him and that makes it even worse) (his voice sounds like sex in this song tho)

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I don’t like the weird honk/bark/weird noises throughout the song, and lyrically it’s a bit basic and cringey. We get it you want to be with a girl you can’t have and you’re jealous. Find a new slant!

**hhiggy** (5): god this song is so slow and long for absolutely no reason

**jackisboredtoday** (5): Searching romantic comedies on netflix with someone sounds really nice but really it just means you spend like an hour trying to pick something & not making decisions

**kappyko** (5): buh buh buh buh bennie and the jets. the woman chorus is weirdly mixed it makes me uncomfortable

**Leixander** (5): boring tbh

**vhqv1997** (5): Kesha outsold

**1998tweety** (4): The intro to this is offensive and deserves to lose a point just for that. The chorus is pretty annoying too. To add onto that, there isn't much else going on with this track, so it leaves my only impression as a negative one.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): just a bit weird for my taste

**ggodisawomann** (4): I don't see the hype for this but it isn't bad

**ImADudeDuh** (2): oh wow this is bad and boring

**CarlieScion** (6): And with this, every member has lost at least one song on Day 1! Men are all equally trash, wbk. This song is okay, I guess? The production is fine, but very similar to the other songs on Flicker - most of which are much better. The chorus is good and I love the female vocals from the uncredited backup singer.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (3): definitely my least favourite on this album. it’s just.... dull. it’s really filler, and since otherwise, this album is pretty tight (even the songs that i don’t like much, i get their place on the album), it stands out in a bad way.

**numberonejobrosstan** (10): i just think this song is really sweet ok???

**surelychoo** (8): thank u for retroactively correcting the egregious grammar mistake of You and I

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the guitar is chill

**martymcflurry** (7.5): I think this song suffers a bit from being the third slow song in a row, but it’s still sweet and pretty.

**followingfreeways** (7): im incredibly indifferent to this song..it's there...


#Yet Another Song With "You" In It

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Sadly not as good of a song as I’d expect it to be. This is supposed to be the breaking point where Niall realizes it’s time to leave his girl and where he begins to break it all off, but the songwriting here isn’t as exciting for me here as it is for other various stops in Flicker’s plot. It has grown a me just a little bit (I originally gave it a 5) and I hate to say this, but overall You And Me is a disappointment. I’m just glad this isn’t the song that closes off the album, because On My Own is genuinely a lot better!

**radiofan15** (6.2): This is better than expected but I've heard this song over a billion times at this point...

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): this album is kinda one note. at least the chorus of this one is better than the 3 before

**ImADudeDuh** (5): eh

**skargardin** (5): Also pretty forgettable, unfortunately

**Verdantshade** (5): a bit of a forgettable ending to the album tbh, it definitely feels weaker than the rest of flicker

**J\_Toe** (4): wowzers this album is backloaded with filler

**Leixander** (4): we got it niall you're very nice, now please move on

**pjatteryd** (4): Meh.

**realboxwood** (3): "We'll be together in end but can't now" is a pretty popular song theme, but one that requires a deft lyrical hand to pull off. Niall does not seem to have that hand, and here he just ends up coming off like he’s stringing this girl along.

**waluigiest** (3): heterosexual

**ggodisawomann** (1): no I'm sorry

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.8): see, okay, here we go. every 1d member except probably louis has a song about sex. ‘get low’ is definitely liam’s, not ‘strip that down’. and you know what? i understand liam’s feelings on sex way better than i do zayn’s. there’s emotion in his voice. some of the lyrics are cringey, and we do not stan zedd anymore cause he’s a rat bastard, but this is a good song. objectively. some of you can’t imagine liam as a sexy being, and i get it, but that’s your problem. and liam’s branding team, but whatever. this is a way better sex song than pillowtalk. I SAID IT. (also i will not say write the essay i want to on female sexuality because i know there is at least one beloved child doing this rate, but i will comment it with spoiler tags below.)

**CarlieScion** (5): This song sounds so generic that I almost can’t even muster up some words about it. It sounds dated and the lyrics don’t really give me anything. It’s not bad, it’s not good, it’s not anything. It sounds like a generic Zedd collab, which is exactly what it is. I much prefer Bedroom Floor as Liam’s ‘sex song’.

---

#Flo Rida ft T-Pain

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song fucks, don't @ me. yeah. I like Get Low. fight me.

**hikkaru** (10): my basic Zedd-stanning ass really is going to give this a 10 huh... it's trop pop edm perfection and that's the tea

**lilacsweetener** (10): The production is bellissimo. So crisp and sharp? I quite like how elaborate the lyrics are and Liam makes it all sound very easy when I imagine the breathe control needed for these verses would be pretty insane.

**radiofan15** (10): I might be one of the few fans of this song judging by its commercial performance and the Jukebox score, but I can resist it… Liam does a surprisingly solid work with the vocals and is able to sell it, the instrumental is hypnotizing, Zedd's production (or whoever ghost-produced it) is fantastic as usual for him, and the fact that we get such a wordy EDM track without a bland drop ruining everything is quite refreshing. It's very likely this is a Day 1 song but I don't care, it truly deserved better and I'll defend it till the end of time.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): People can say this dated (which it kinda is) but that doesn't make it a bad song!

**poppinmmolly** (9): I can't believe I forgot this bop existed

**skargardin** (9): Also a bop

**eklxtreme** (8.5): need more Liam songs in this style

**believedcrazy** (8): i really like this not gonna lie

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Zedd’s production saves the song

**martymcflurry** (8): this is also a fun bop.

**numberonejobrosstan** (8): i like dis one

**tinaoe** (8): it's fun okay

**1998tweety** (7.5): A cute lil bop. It's not Zedd's best song, but it could be a nice dance track. I wish it was a little less chill though and went a bit harder.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.4): The lyrics kinda suck but Liam's vocals sell it & its a rare post-Stay Zedd track that doesn't sound like its ripping off Stay

**ufohyde** (7): The chorus is lazy but it's a cute summer bop

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Of course Zedd is in this rate. It is impossible to escape this man. Well, at the very least, I can’t seem to find a ticking noise somewhere in here. Also, haha, it’s called Get Low! You can just imagine Liam winking right now! 69! Hohoho! Okay, maybe I need to stop roasting this song so much. It’s not bad. I get how this could’ve been a pretty good minor hit otherwise, but Liam saying ‘get low’ over and over again when he’s not as great of a performer as he ought to be makes things get a little exhausting, and more or less, even if I don’t have anything against this song, it’s not for me. Nor is Liam’s music in general, to be honest, but hey, whatever.

#Liam Payne & Zedd 

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): not my genre but I suppose it's okay

**J\_Toe** (6): what is this atrocious album (single?) artwork?

**kappyko** (6): this is fine

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): Serviceable club track, and it least it has a more interesting beat than most Zedd songs. Liam's vocal performance is pretty forgettable and mostly blends into the background, although that's a criticism of most club EDM tracks like this.

**realboxwood** (5): Less annoying than other Zedd songs, but that’s not saying much

**surelychoo** (5): way better than Strip That Down but still meh. Liam can do so much better than this

**waluigiest** (5): this sounds unfinished

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): it's so repetitive

**grandmafriend** (3): lame

**Leixander** (3): this title makes me miss the times I played Need For Speed

**CarlieScion** (5): Finally, this track leaves us - a respectable placement for the worst song in Niall’s discography. The whole song is pretty mellow and Niall’s vocals sound bad. The chorus is especially bad - it sounds like he sang ‘fire away’ after having a week long cold. Niall has much, much better songs, some of which deal with the same exact situation as this song.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): honestly just stream fake smile by ariana grande to hear it from the girl’s perspective. this is the way, way, way lesser version of mirrors, and he sounds like that dude from falling in love in a coffee shop? aka every white male indie folk singer. you’re better than this, niall.

#400000000000 On The Scoville Scale

**sleepkittycat** (11): I'd say it's fire but it's acoustic so I'm at a loss for words

**grandmafriend** (9.3): dont yall get the genius of this song??

**ufohyde** (9): Okay Niall Mayer Horan, come through!

**Verdantshade** (9): the guitar solo and the outro really makes the song

**1998tweety** (8.5): It's chill, I like it.

**martymcflurry** (8.5): I think musically this isn’t my favorite, but I love the lyrics. One of the things I love about the whole album is the recurring theme of wanting the other person to talk to him, and basically him reassuring that it’s okay and he just wants to listed and be supportive, but never demanding. I think it’s a perspective not often heard from male pop artists. Feminist king!

**eklxtreme** (7): a nice comedown

**pjatteryd** (7): It’s stuck in my mind

**radiofan15** (7): I see we reached THAT portion of the album... at least this one is nice and passable.

**surelychoo** (7): "pull the trigger piglet" basically

**vhqv1997** (7): The one time his vocal delivery is just emotional enough is also the one time the song is so boring it doesn't matter either way

**tinaoe** (6): put so long on here instead

**yourhostandpatron** (6): This is a pretty cute song, but I’m sorry; I dunno if Niall was the best artist you could pick to sing Fire Away, even if he was the one that actually wrote it. That might seem like a bit of a drag, but as much I’d contest the idea that the lad’s music has no personality to it, his voice isn’t well developed enough to make a chorus as soft as Fire Away’s all that interesting. This is a shame, because he was able to pull that angle off with Flicker, but maybe too many songs of the sort just doesn’t make the cut.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): slow and boring again.

**waluigiest** (5): some nice chill drumming I guess

**realboxwood** (4.5): I do like the concept of this song, at least, but Niall’s voice sounds even thinner than usual through the vast majority of it.

**Leixander** (4): tears of boredom mayhaps

**selegend** (4): this album is so boring gawd

**ImADudeDuh** (3): his voice does not sound good on here

**ggodisawomann** (2): Niall why pls

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.2): it’s a catchy earworm, and utterly forgettable at the same time. i hate his career choices so much. i need to fistfight certain people on his team in a parking lot.

**CarlieScion** (7): And with this, the Liam slaughter ends (for today). He is left with a whopping 3 songs left, meaning he has lost 70% of all the songs he has ever released. For what it’s worth, I definitely think this song deserved Day 2. The chorus bops, Liam sounds like he’s actually invested in the situation and the production is pretty good! Not good enough for r/popheads, though.

#The Best Song On The First Time EP

**believedcrazy** (10): i love this song so much

**surelychoo** (10): I'm so so so so happy with this song it redeems the rest of his discography

**followingfreeways** (9.5): a BOP!!!!

**eklxtreme** (8.5): title is misleading cus it slaps actually

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): This is Liam’s best song. It’s not pop perfection or anything, but it actually has a good beat, which is a relief if you contrast that with Liam’s other attempts at making those things. Those seem to be rare these days for him; it’s almost as if practicing songwriting with a pop rock boy band makes the members that went in that direction by themselves produce better solo music, while the other two can’t even seem to exert the effort and eagerness you’re supposed to have when trying a new genre. Oops.

**martymcflurry** (8.3): This still feels trend chase-y but it’s catchy

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): it's my favorite from the EP but I still think he could do better

**1998tweety** (7.5): Kind of generic, but it's a cute little bop and at this point I'll take it over the ballads.

**radiofan15** (7.5): I'm quite shock on how surprisingly decent is this track… sure, the drop is overplayed but here it really works, and there's enough charm on Liam's performance that I'm surprised that be tried to go for the urban route in most of his solo stuff.

**selegend** (7): this bops tbh

**skargardin** (7): bop

**vhqv1997** (7): This song truly did let me down slow with that shitty bridge

**waluigiest** (7): kind of dated but not bad

**ignitethephoenix** (6): if you are going to do an EDM pop song make it go off and don’t make it boring

**lilacsweetener** (6): sounds like a 1D reject...

**pjatteryd** (6): It feels like one direction, and I adore one direction

**Verdantshade** (6): this sounded like it could have been a moderate hit

#Remember When The First Time EP Didn't Even Chart

**hikkaru** (5): generic and annoying... great combo

**kappyko** (5): apparently i listened to this

**numberonejobrosstan** (5): basic

**realboxwood** (4.5): You know at least Strip That Down was fun in it’s blatant trend-hopping

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): i love this song. i really do. when zayn goes up into that falsetto-ish tone, his music is much more interesting for it.

**CarlieScion** (7): Another mellow track that just sorta muddles along. The chorus is pretty good though, and I’m always a sucker for Zayn telling me to take it off. The production is smooth, although it is once again way too minimalist for my liking.

---

#Norway-Sweden Border

**kappyko** (10): maybe i like this album because im *****

**Verdantshade** (10): I used to get confused because two songs on the album have a chorus about 'taking it off'. this one's definitely the superior one though. the verses aren't great but the chorus is really really good

**surelychoo** (9): that z is triggering me

**1998tweety** (8.5): I like this, it has a nice chill vibe to it and instead of ruining that vibe, Zayn adds to it.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): The production on this track is great, I can take or leave Zayn (like most of my other highlights on this album tbh) but that beat is smooth. Again, I'd love to hear someone like The Weeknd on this.

**Leixander** (7): this has great moments but his voice in some parts are "vomworthy" by Meghan Trainor PR terms

#Texas-Oklahoma Border

**numberonejobrosstan** (6.6): fine but this is the most triggering title omg

**eklxtreme** (6.5): don't rly like his voice on this

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): i'm realizing right now that all my zayn scores are a little too similar but so are the songs on this album so i guess thats fitting

**rickikardashian** (6.2): weird to think that before the pop scene became an ongoing political debate there could be a song called “Borders” that wasn’t about immigrants

**vhqv1997** (6): Impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible

**waluigiest** (6): a song full of choices. Some of them worked.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): I have listened to this song at least twenty times and I still can't remember what it sounds like

**pjatteryd** (5): Did he put a Z at the end because his name is Zayn?

**yourhostandpatron** (5): There are far better songs I’ve heard that incorporate the word ‘border’ into their title, some of which include Borderline by Madonna and even whatever that Years and Years song happened to be. I essentially see Borders as the gateway towards Mind of Mine actually becoming boring as most people think it is; I don’t mind the album, much, but Borders is perhaps a symbol of everything wrong with it, with its mumbling replacing any semblance of a worthy chorus and Zayn’s performance lacking the luster it should have. Not a fan.

**radiofan15** (4.4): What the fuck is he trying to do by singing the verses like that?

**realboxwood** (4): This whole album is truly a testament to Frank Ocean’s creativity and skill as a songwriter

**NotWith10000Men** (1): it took a lot of strength to not change the song in the first 15 seconds. it got better but damn.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): i remember when it came out that jay had died. it was such an unexpected gut punch -- even though i have often wanted to physically fight louis, i also sympathise immensely with his tragic losses. i listened to just hold on a bunch of times in the weeks after its release, and ultimately, i find it’s just a very comforting song? it’s a little generic, maybe (though i’d put that on the production), but when you watch his live performances of it, it comes to life.

**CarlieScion** (6): Louis loses his last song for the day! Just Hold On was the first track Louis released as a solo artist and the fact that he released it just after his mom died makes it hit so much harder. However, this isn’t the type of music I listen to in my daily life and I feel like the song isn’t fast-paced or even good enough to be played in a club environment. Sorry, Louis.

#Benihana Dinner Date

**eklxtreme** (11): this is like sorry by jb but better in every way and it's louis

**believedcrazy** (9): this song is amazing

**grandmafriend** (8.5): heart wrenching

**Leixander** (8.5): mr. chipmunk really snapped on this one, a nightcore classic

**followingfreeways** (8): i have a very personal connection to this song, and if it was stylistically different im sure it would be a straight 10

**lilacsweetener** (8): the lyrics are devastating yet hopeful

**vhqv1997** (8): I understand the context of this song is about his late mother? So well, it's certainly a choce... I kinda expect a more... traditional sort of tribute.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): The first instinct that popped up in my mind when I listened to this song was to compare it to Avicii’s music; it’s an EDM track that draws some influences from folk, and I was about to call it a softer version of the former until I realized that I know nothing about EDM and that I would have probably made a stupid dumb comparison. But with all that being said, this is pretty great; it’s not my type of music, but this is as eager as I’ll ever be to hear an EDM song with a male vocalist at the forefront. Louis’s mind...

**numberonejobrosstan** (7.9): it’s fun

**J\_Toe** (7): oh i've heard this song. it's okay.

**surelychoo** (7): Louis' voice is so unique, and Aoki balanced the clarity of its tone perfectly with some not-that-annoying-for-once EDM. rest in peace Jay ):

**Verdantshade** (7): this was the first song I ever bought on itunes lol. it's obviously a very touching song but I generally can't stand edm

**waluigiest** (7): on the edge of fun

**1998tweety** (6.5): The first time I heard this I hated it. It's certainly not as bad as I initially remembered but I still don't find it amazing.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): a lot of this would be better in a different context but the melody on the "ohhhhh"s and the forgettable drop kinda kill it

**ggodisawomann** (6): this bops

**martymcflurry** (6): I feel bad about this but I feel like the EDM production clashes weirdly with the lyrics and the meaning of the whole song.

**pjatteryd** (6): I would argue that this is a Aoki song, Louis is just kind of there

**selegend** (6): this sucks ass but after hearing that niall album i’m at least awake now

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): I understand the personal connection of the lyrics and themes of this song, but I feel like the generic festival EDM backing takes a bit away from it. Maybe with some more subdued production I could have gotten more out of it, but it feels too formulaic to EDM cliches.

#Onion Volcano

**NotWith10000Men** (2): sounds so generic and lame

**realboxwood** (2): This song only exists in inspirational montages for talent shows and car commercials, I’m surprised I was allowed to listen to it without also having to watch a disadvantaged child cry tears of joy or a Honda Civic tear down a city street.

**radiofan15** (1): I know the retroactive context of this song might gave it some points among certain sub-sectors of the participants, but I hope the rest of them can realize that this is a bland and by-the-numbers EDM Eurotrashy semi-inspirational cookie-cutter mess of an average hype/party song. I've already heard this one dozens of times before.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.2): i love rear view a lot, the production really makes it, it feels like it should be on a reimagined drive soundtrack or something like that. and i like the ‘sounds like you need a friend’ line a lot because at the time i first heard it, i really did. ha!

**CarlieScion** (7): Yet another Zayn track goes out! This song is honestly one of the better cuts on Mind of Mine, but for some reason I can’t give my all to the song. Zayn sounds kinda rough on this and I have no idea why - he usually has the best vocal performance of all the 1D boys.

---

#Parallel Parking Perfectly

**Verdantshade** (10): the production on this is fucking fantastic. I can't believe zayn went in a poppier direction after mind of mine - this is the kind of solo music I expected him to make and it's amazing

**vhqv1997** (10): I love the bassline and the chorus. I had no idea Zayn is following in the footsteps of early Frank Ocean I would have stanned him so hard

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Unless I get the motivation to listen to Icarus Falls, which will never happen, Rear View is and forever will be the best song I ever hear from Zayn Malik. There are many, many times on Mind of Mine where Zayn appears too edgy to salvage, but he gets close to achieving his artistic ambition more often on the album then you’d think, and in Rear View he most definitely succeeds; add together the intimacy of Zayn’s voice, the beautiful emotional fragility present in the song’s themes, and the rare accomplishment of the track sounding like an actual heart-to heart talk between two lovers or friends, and you get an absolutely superb deep cut that’s essentially a good rebuttal to anybody who thinks Zayn’s music has no merit. That’s not to say that he shouldn’t try to make songs as good as this more often, though!

**eklxtreme** (8): the harmonies are crazy good

**waluigiest** (8): the bridge gives me chills

**1998tweety** (7.5): The production to this started off very promising but then it didn't go where I wanted it too. I wanted a big explosion but it was just kind of mild. Still bopped though.

**Leixander** (7.5): yes zayn sing for once instead of doing the whiny voice

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i really like the beat. this is the first song on this album that sounds unique to me

**roxieloxie** (7): shout out to 9th grade year in which I used this song in a mixtape for a book project about of mice and men

**ImADudeDuh** (6): its ok

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): unquestionably my favourite song on this entire album. there’s something so interesting about his stream of consciousness narrative and just... everything he sings in this hooks me. the abrupt ending and song’s structure as a whole might be a little strange, but i maintain and will forever remind you all that that ‘i was over you / or were you under me’ is the precursor to new rules’ ‘if you’re under him / you ain’t getting over him’.

**CarlieScion** (6): Zayn closes out Day 1 with this rather whiny track. The synth is good, but his performance is questionable at best and the track just feels really thrown-together and random. It sounds like filler and I have no idea why this is on the standard edition, especially when LIKE I WOULD is on the deluxe???

#People Who Know Lucozade is British/Apparently Japanese Gatorade

**vhqv1997** (10): I love lyrics like these, streams of consciousness flowing from one verse into another. It's so tiring that 95% of songs now all have the same structure.

**kappyko** (9.5): im losing my mind

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (9): I just love his voice in this one, okay

**roxieloxie** (9): this song gets a nine for how vividly it transported me back to 9th grade honors lit

**waluigiest** (9): there’s something really touching about this. The club beat mixed with the pained, stream of conscious lyrics. It works in a strange way.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Wtf the production on this is so so good. Ok actually this started very well but then it dragged on a bit too long. Still a bop and the production is still amazing, but unfortunately it got a little repetitive and lost its touch.

**xmxlxo** (8.3): Apparently this is Japanese gatorade and I don't understand that [Kiki's note: .....it's Japanese and not British????? Scotland is shaking.]

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.5): One of the others I enjoyed

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I like the production but Zayn’s vocal’s performance is mediocre here

**lilacsweetener** (7): maybe he snapped

**surelychoo** (7): the most substantial lyrics of the album imo, even if some of the melody is sacrificed in the process

**Verdantshade** (7): this is a good one and probably deserves an 8 but I never really got into the song. definitely a direction zayn should have continued to go in

#People Who Don't

**radiofan15** (6.5): Gosh it was REALLY close but he had to go low-key with the chorus… what a waste of a potential BOP.

**realboxwood** (6.5): This at least gives off the impression of having bars. Bars that think they’re much more profound than they actually are, but bars nonetheless.

**rickikardashian** (6.5): Zayn described that this song was like a “stream of consciousness” for him, and i can tell because i have no fucking clue what the hell he’s talking about. He mentions and bunch o shit and i can’t get the hang of any of them. At least the productions bangs

**NotWith10000Men** (6): the weird beat in the background is cool

**pjatteryd** (6): I like the lyrics but the sound is boooring

**yourhostandpatron** (6): I feel sorry for giving this a six, because I read the One Direction pop compass post (we need to get those posts back into business, people), and I know that one of the hosts picked this as a highlight, but I don’t think Zayn pulls off the Frank Ocean impressions here all that well. I can see signs of a really interesting crooner in Lucozade, even if I have no idea what the hell Lucozade is (sounds like a cough medicine to me), but I regard it as ultimately failed experimentation from an artist too premature to take this track to its full heights. Sorry, Zayn; hopefully you’ll do better next time!

**followingfreeways** (5): yawn

**ImADudeDuh** (5): i'll be honest, i have no idea what is going on

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): The synthy beat was kind of cool at first but the song just drones on and on, it doesn't have a hook so it reminds me of one of those really overlong Drake songs where he just raps in a monotone over an unending beat. This is a worse version of those.

**Leixander** (4): enjoyable generic production but he is basically gargling random stuff here
