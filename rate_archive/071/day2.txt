**CarlieScion** (10): Liam has the honor of being first out two days in a row - impressive. I really like Jonas Blue‚Äôs production - it always sounds really sleek and ‚Äòfinished‚Äô. Lennon Stella‚Äôs voice is also really good (and she stans Robyn so you should really stan her too!). All in all, a really good collab and a smooth track.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): this song is another fat lot of nothing. it‚Äôs cute, but everything is just... weak. like, not bad, so i‚Äôm not going to rate them like shit, because nuance, but they‚Äôre not memorable and not exactly the first songs i play when i want to have a good time.

---

#Instant Cameras

**Verdantshade** (9): lennon stella's voice is sugar sweet and I'll definitely be following her career. I'm not sure if this song is actually really good or it's just so much better than the rest of the shit liam has put out but I really enjoy it anyway

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (8.9): Polaroid is such a bop

**1998tweety** (8.5): There are lots of bits of this that bop hard but it feels like it's missing something to ascend it to mega bop level.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): it gets catchy

**surelychoo** (8): probably his best collaboration. pleasant all the way through

**grandmafriend** (7.9): it grew on me

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): jonas blue makes bops ONLY, one of the best EDM producers in the game rn

**ggodisawomann** (7): this is good

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its ok, but i could travel back in time to 2016, turn on my tv to MTV, and I feel like within 5 minutes, I'll hear 72 commercials for reality shows that take place on a beach that use songs that sounds exactly like this.

**martymcflurry** (7): all of these collabs are like...not bad songs, but I just don‚Äôt see Liam‚Äôs voice as an artist anywhere.

**waluigiest** (7): it‚Äôs not bad but it‚Äôs filler

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): it's okay. i like the polarOID part

#Your 6 Could Mean Anything

**realboxwood** (6): This certainly is just generic radio and playlist filler

**selegend** (6): oh this bops

**skargardin** (6): I‚Äôm so over Jonas Blue but this isn‚Äôt all that bad i suppose

**yourhostandpatron** (6): No, deadass, I tried to like this one, but it all just fell apart. Not because Polaroid is a bad song (it‚Äôs decent) but because it fits the formula for an indie pop would-be hit down to the very tee. Guest features none of us recognize? Check. Strangely specific object, brand, or location as the song‚Äôs title? Check. Annoying vocals from the lead singer? Check! It‚Äôs baffling that Liam would choose to go into this direction considering the rest of his career‚Äôs been bland RnB pop, but I wouldn‚Äôt have objected to this if it was actually good. Sorry, but Out Of The Woods outpeaked!

#Digital Cameras

**pjatteryd** (5): It feels like one of those summer hits that you forget after one week

**radiofan15** (4.2): I have tasted glasses of water with more substance and flavor than this this.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): this one wore out pretty quickly

**believedcrazy** (4): its boring

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): Jonas Blue is one of the most boring, generic EDM producers and I have yet to hear one of his songs make any impact on me. This is no different.

**CarlieScion** (5): Are we ready for some more Zayn slaughter? We begin today's dose of Zayn with this whiny and slow ballad. The lyrics are melodramatic and his vocal performance isn‚Äôt strong enough for a ballad of this grandor.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (2): yall know, KiKi HaTeS bALLaDs

---

#People Who Like Ballads

**believedcrazy** (10): this is the best of the album

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song gets me in my feels always

**waluigiest** (10): showstopping. the intro verse melody/piano are so beautiful. And the way the song grows and swells is masterful.

**lilacsweetener** (9): this one grew on me over time, love the passion in his performance

**poppinmmolly** (9): love this

**1998tweety** (8): This is kind of basic and standard, but sometimes that's good right? There are still points where Zayn tries to do too much with his vocals but besides that, it's a pretty solid track.

**eklxtreme** (8): very romantic owo

**J\_Toe** (8): glad I gave this rate a go for songs like this. I like it very much.

**surelychoo** (8): coming for Sam Smith's throat

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): His voice sounds great here but it‚Äôs just a tiny bit bland

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): I can hear the Beatles influence in this song, and the instrumentation is nice, but I just don't think Zayn's voice is suited for this style as much as say, Harry's is, and it suffers from it. I do like some of the melodies though, it's one of the better songs on here.

**tinaoe** (7): we like a ballad

**Verdantshade** (7): it's cute. classic sound. I'd die for an ot5 version of this though

**vhqv1997** (7): Why does this sound so much like a Beatles deep cut?

**rickikardashian** (6.9): im a sucker for passionate ballads, especially if they come after 5 songs that sound like they were recorded in the middle of an emotionless xanax trip

**martymcflurry** (6.8): Another ballad...is this named after the line in Just a Little Bit of Your Heart by Ariana, written by Harry? Investigate...

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): i was preparing to really dislike this one but the retro ballad style works better on zayn than i realized. this feels almost like a decent bruno mars deep cut

**radiofan15** (6.7): This was "this" close to feel like a blander version of 7 Years but, once again, production saved it‚Ä¶ what would Zayn do without talented producers behind him?

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): the foooool for you part sounds neat

**pjatteryd** (6): Reminds me of that Troye song

**yourhostandpatron** (5.5): I was originally going to just copy and paste the Wikipedia description of what being a ‚Äòfool‚Äô in a medieval sense meant for all my other fellow history nerds, but upon listening to this again I became so annoyed that I decided to lower my score and rant it all out. There‚Äôs no doubting that Zayn‚Äôs voice can be very, very attractive, and, yes, I just winked, but there‚Äôs also no doubting that it can be borderline annoying at times (if you know which particular falsetto in one particular movie soundtrack hit I happen to be talking about!) and Wrong and Fool For You are back to back examples of how dumb he sounds what that happens. Seriously, what‚Äôs up with the chorus? Zayn sounds like he‚Äôs croaking it! This could‚Äôve been good otherwise, but the mediocrity it descends into makes it dull.

#Is This A Reddit TOS Violation

**selegend** (4): what the fuck are these vocals? i‚Äôll kill you

#People With Taste

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): because the chorus is fucking atrocious but I really like the rest

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this sounds like a frat boy trying to cover a song from the 50's doo wop era

**Leixander** (2): this is so awkward

**realboxwood** (1): Piano ballads are in general a really hard sell for me, so this song was fighting a losing battle from the jump. And then Zayn continues to Zayn all over it, and there's that weird vocal effect in the chorus that makes it sound like he's singing into a plastic bottle, and it just doesn‚Äôt work at all.

**sleepkittycat** (0): I couldn't have sounded more strained in the chorus if I tried

**CarlieScion** (6): Hello Kehlani! Nice to see a woman for once in this rate. The production here makes everything sound weirdly hollow. Once again, the chorus is good and this song would have been better if it was attached to verses that aren‚Äôt minimalist and hollow.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): i just don‚Äôt know how to rate this! it‚Äôs definitely a sexy song, like pillowtalk, but it‚Äôs much more interesting. the vocal layering in particular is something. but some of the lines are just. impossible to listen to. and he comes across so sleazy. like, don‚Äôt think this is real? shut up zayn. she‚Äôs valid.

#Grey Sweatpants

**hhiggy** (10): it's in his top two best songs and it's not number two. WHY DIDN'T HE CONTINUE TO MAKE MORE MUSIC LIKE THIS

**tinaoe** (10): it's a bop lads

**pjatteryd** (9): I love it!! I think their voices fit together very well

**waluigiest** (9): Zayn fucks

**followingfreeways** (8): when zayn and kehlani say "no good" in the second verse ... bitch i

**Leixander** (8): my complaint is still his voice, but at least kehlani is here to lend him some help in that department

**skargardin** (8): Kehlani always slays her features whew

**1998tweety** (7.5): This is ok, Kehlani adds a nice contrast to the song but it's still quite boring and doesn't go anywhere. Compare it to something like Done For Me or What I Need, and Kehlani feels very wasted here.

**believedcrazy** (7): its ok

**martymcflurry** (7): I love their voices together

**numberonejobrosstan** (7): their voices sound really really good together

**radiofan15** (6.7): God bless Kehlani for injecting some much needed stamina to this snooze fest that the Instagram model sans-Instagram dared to call an album.

**rickikardashian** (6.7): Okay but Kehlani ate Zayn alive in this track. She came and claimed it as her own

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): I‚Äôve never been on the Kehlani hate train as much as everybody else, though that could just be because I‚Äôm a queer person of color semi-familiar with wlw culture and how much it adores Kehlani, but with all due respect, this ain‚Äôt it. I can see where they were going for with that hook, and theoretically Zayn and Kehlani sound like they‚Äôd make a great combination, but their voices aren‚Äôt in top shape here, and what makes it worse is the production, which makes their singing...somewhat grating. You could say that the two of them got the execution of this song all wRoNg. Please shoot me.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): this isn't particularly good or bad so i wanna take this space & tell everyone to listen to SweetSexySavage

**lilacsweetener** (6): the weeknd lite

**NotWith10000Men** (6): this album sounds really 2016 to me and this song is no exception

**roxieloxie** (6): "Zayns album isnt so bad" I say as I skip this song

**selegend** (6): bop but noisy

**surelychoo** (6): So many of Zayn's songs seem to be a one-line chorus repeated over and over and over. Kehlani tried to spice it up with some flair at the end, but there should have been MORE, otherwise it just gets boring

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6): I like Kehlani's voice, and between this and the Suicide Squad soundtrack she helped out a couple messy albums in 2016, but Zayn's overblown R&B sound was really getting to me by this point in the album so she couldn't fully save it.

**Verdantshade** (6): it's alright. I really hate the 'I'll get her wetter than ever' line though, it really makes him sound like a sleazy knockoff weeknd

#Cargo Shorts

**eklxtreme** (5.5): they couldve made a much more memorable song together

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): this was my favorite song on album for like a year. Now I just can't really listen to it anymore

#I Just Wanted To Highlight The Phrase ‚ÄúZayn‚Äôs La Croix Voice‚Äù

**realboxwood** (3.5): Kehlani sounds great, but I don‚Äôt know if anyone could have chemistry with Zayn‚Äôs La Croix voice. It‚Äôs certainly not helped by the mixing of the chorus, which makes it sound like she's recording her part from outside.

**CarlieScion** (6): Drunk is nothing special, but okay ‚Äòmellow‚Äô Spotify playlist-filler. The chorus and some of the adlibs scores this song extra point, but this is the point where the album starts to melt together in my mind. It‚Äôs just more of the same, again and again.

**followingfreeways** (9): this song makes me feels incredibly nostalgic and also like summer

**waluigiest** (9): good hot slow jam

**eklxtreme** (8.5): perfect late night song

**ImADudeDuh** (8): /u/NapsAndNetflix

**1998tweety** (7): This is kind of forgettable again. Zayn needs to bring the bops cause his ballads are just ok.

**J\_Toe** (7): really glad I participated in this rate. I had listened to Harry and Niall's post 1-D work, and didn't especially love it. Like, it's really well made, just not for me. I never bothered with Zayn doe to his (for want of a better term) arrogant/pretentious artist image (maybe I've been influenced by the wrong people's views?). Any way, I like Malay's production throughout this album, and how similar it is to Album of the Decade Channel ORANGE.

**Verdantshade** (7): cute summer jam I guess

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): Eh, this ruins the flow of Mind of Mine a bit for me (though, considering that the best song on the entire album comes right after, I don‚Äôt suppose I‚Äôm all that angry at it). Funnily enough, Drunk still fits the palette of slow rhythm-inspired pop music that I admired in It‚Äôs You, so I should theoretically enjoy this,  the latter song‚Äôs lusher and lustier counterpart, but I‚Äôve never been fond of substance metaphors in music or literature for some reason, so I like this considerably less than I ought to. Sorry, Zayn, but this ain‚Äôt me!

#Walking Straight Into The Door Of A Closed McDonald‚Äôs At 5 AM

**ggodisawomann** (5): okay

**pjatteryd** (5): I think he drinks too much.

**surelychoo** (5): definition of filler

**radiofan15** (4.5): If I listen repeatedly to this album, would the songs stop sounding the same?

**NotWith10000Men** (3.5): it's like he's trying to do RnB but really badly

**realboxwood** (3): In the middle of this song the music drops out so all the attention can be focused on Zayn singing, ‚ÄúRight now I‚Äôm emotional,‚Äù which he does without the slightest hint of emotion in his voice.

**Leixander** (2): i don't want to listen to this ever again

#Leaving Your Band In A Facebook Post

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (10): I just realized if the rate had included icarus falls zayn would have received way more points from me.

**believedcrazy** (10): what a good song

**pjatteryd** (10): I don't know if it's 1D nostalgia or if this song is actually good, but I love it anyways

**tinaoe** (10): thx zayn for the heartbreak

**vhqv1997** (10): I think a lot of people believe this song to be about the entire band, but to me this song is more about Zayn's anxiety about living in the spotlight, and because of that I can definitely relate to it. It's an issue not talked about enough and the way he divulged his thoughts about something that we take for granted is refreshing and also pretty emotional. This is what I like to see from famous people talking about their issues, unlike that song from the official rate.

**followingfreeways** (9): im really crying out here :(

**1998tweety** (8.5): A good song from a good album.

**eklxtreme** (8): interesting.png

**waluigiest** (8): I kind of love my soft boy bad popstar Zayn

**xmxlxo** (8): I didn't expect a collective 1D diss from Zayn but I think it's funny

**numberonejobrosstan** (6.5): i can‚Äôt believe he did this skjfksjksfj

#Your Post 1D Career

**surelychoo** (6): I have anxiety too and I can't even imagine how much more difficult it would be under such a huge spotlight. I don't know if leaving 1D has helped his mental health or worsened it, because it seems like he can't even be out in public now ):. But I do hope that he's been getting the right treatment in private and that he's happier now.

**Verdantshade** (6): the song's alright but ffs zayn.. I understand mental illness/anxiety must have made life in 1d awful and that he needed to get out of the band but he only has himself to blame for the circumstances of his departure and burning bridges. I really hope he gets his life back on track

**radiofan15** (5.5): God Zayn please get over it... it's over already! try to be relevant by yourself... stop clinging to them, it's kinda pathetic at this point

**Leixander** (3): :thinking:

**static\_int\_husp** (3): Would be a 0 if it was in the main rate. Also thank you for not making us rate the giant abomination that is Icarus Falls

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (3): This doesn't work very well for me huh

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.3): i saw a lot of the misconception that familar was the product of liam trendhopping again when this came out, but i‚Äôm here to tell you it is damn not! j balvin and liam were pretty close (but now... we just don‚Äôt know) which lead to this collab. i love j balvin even though he‚Äôs a fucking dick and i love liam even though he‚Äôs a fucking dick, so i love this. it‚Äôs just a carefree bilingual summer bop. and liam showed a hell of a lot more respect to the spanish language than justin bieber. i‚Äôve seen him sing this live, and he loves this song, and you can tell.

**CarlieScion** (7): Yes, this means that Liam is down to only 1 song left. Will he even live to see the end of the day? Find out later, I guess. Familiar sounds really trend-chasing, but it‚Äôs also good so I can forgive it for that. I don‚Äôt really like J Balvin‚Äôs voice, so points off for that.

---

#Bad Bunny

**1998tweety** (10): I don't know why this wasn't MASSIVE. It's such a huge bop and I kind of thought it would be the next Despacito (or at least have a fragment of its success).

**believedcrazy** (10): bop

**ggodisawomann** (10): okay Familiar bangs too HELP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Literally a latin icon. We stan.

**napsandnetflix** (10): this deserved to be the song of summer 2018

**eklxtreme** (9): huge bop that deserved to be a smash

**hhiggy** (9): i wasn't expecting this to be good wtf

**selegend** (9): bop tbh

**tinaoe** (9): legit bopped to this

**TragicKingdom1** (8.5): better than despacito

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Liam is coming for every kind of music people of colour make. Next he will do Chinese funeral music. No race is safe when Mr. Payne is in the house. (And, yes, I‚Äôm joking for the most part. Look at the score I gave this song. Please don‚Äôt come for me.) I don‚Äôt expect Popheads to be especially happy when they see J Balvin‚Äôs name on something but to be fair, despite the lack of using ‚Äòfamiliar‚Äô as a noun that describes a witch‚Äôs animal partner within this song‚Äôs lyrics, which I am extremely angry about, what‚Äôs good about this single is that it actually slaps, which is a compliment I cannot direct to Liam‚Äôs music the majority of the time. Adios.

**xmxlxo** (8.4): Liam's best song is a J. Balvin album reject

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): A model or some kind of bottle is a line that really annoys me for some reason

**NotWith10000Men** (8): big yes. love the chorus. dancey song done right

**numberonejobrosstan** (8): never listened to this song before now but it... kinda slaps?

**surelychoo** (8): the first of Liam's songs that didn't feel meme-y and was good in its own right. his vocals are finally done justice, and although it's still about subject matter that Liam likes to sing about, they're not generic madlibs-esque lyrics. see Liam! you don't have to sacrifice one for the other! you can have both!

**waluigiest** (8): kinda hot idk

**rickikardashian** (7.8): honestly when this first came up I found it really obnoxious, especially the hook, but honestly this is better than STD and it bops. I also want J Balvin to destroy me so this is also helping his score

**martymcflurry** (7.5): I would fully bop to this in Zumba but this kind of sounds like Liam trying to make Despacito 2.0. Also reminds of the Krabby Patty video. But I would fully bop

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (6.5): A decent piece of Latin pop, but I definitely would have liked this more as a J Balvin solo track. Liam feels out of place on here in a way that other artists like Beyonc√© or even Justin Bieber haven't on songs like this.

**lilacsweetener** (6): Cashing in on Despacito but with decent results.

**skargardin** (6): Kinda bops

#Maluma 

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (5.5): Eh not for me

**radiofan15** (5.3): There's a good Latin song here but that chorus is so anti-climatic that nearly put me to sleep‚Ä¶ not even Daddy Balvin could save this trainwreck. The only positive I can say is that Liam's vocals reminded me of a young Ricky Martin so maybe that should be a clue about what his musical direction should be.

**followingfreeways** (5): this annoys me for reasons i cant explain

**realboxwood** (5): The latin influence adds some interest, but it can only do so much

**pjatteryd** (4): I like J Balvin, dislike Liam

**grandmafriend** (3): meh again

**Leixander** (2): in our FAMILIA?????

**CarlieScion** (6): It took me so long to realize that the name of this song is an acronym (TiO = Take it Off), it‚Äôs actually embarrassing. This track is rather ‚Äòsexy‚Äô if you‚Äôd like. It actually feels like I‚Äôm watching Zayn have sex in song format. Luckily, the song isn‚Äôt long enough to leave much of an impact on me.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4.5): it‚Äôs the sleaze factor again, i just can‚Äôt take zayn seriously, his approach to sex is just so immature. understandable, since he was made an object of sexual desire at like sixteen, but still.

---

#Papi

**followingfreeways** (10): this was when my 15 year old self realized zayn isnt holding back with his solo music Lmao. now 20 year old self thinks this is a slut anthem

**ggodisawomann** (10): amazing song. I love the "ah ah ah ah"

**lilacsweetener** (10): another stone cold banger imagine if zayn could DANCE imagine the CHOREOGRAPHY potential here, points for not holding back lyrically either most pop songs don't really go there with visceral intensity and even playing around with stereotypical gender roles (he's being pushed against the wall and likes it hard, okay zayn!)

**roxieloxie** (9.8): yOuR a FrEaK lIkE mE

**1998tweety** (9): This bops. Catchy and has a nice beat and vibe to it. Good closer to the standard edition of the album.

**believedcrazy** (9): this is such a good song

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): This is going to be one of Zayn‚Äôs highest-rated songs because it‚Äôs good and very upbeat compared to the second half of this album, but it‚Äôs also going to do pretty decently because Popheads is really fucking horny. There‚Äôs no real reason why Zayn had to turn Take It Off‚Äôs title into an annoying acronym AND still apply that annoying capitalization effect on it, but if you were about to sleep, the song definitely injects energy back into the album again; perhaps it‚Äôs not as fantastic as some other sexy time jams other people more adept at RnB have given us, but Zayn is still a pretty good person to pick for the job. The lyrics here too are also far more poetic than Zayn‚Äôs typing patterns would suggest, which is a relief.

**pjatteryd** (8): This is a better version of strip it off

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): we get it you have sex zayn. Still good though

**J\_Toe** (7): like the sound but don't like the implication that removing make up is the way to truly understand someone. Like, it's not like make up is deceit or anything.

**surelychoo** (7): can't hold a candle to Kesha's Take It Off

**Verdantshade** (7): this is pillowtalk but actually good and actually sexy

#People Who Took Elementary School Spanish

**xmxlxo** (9.6): Took off some points because I always read this song title as the Spanish word for uncle

**eklxtreme** (7.5): is zayn dedicating this to his uncle flushed

**ImADudeDuh** (6): This song is called TIO cause it stands for Take It Off, but "tio" in spanish means "uncle," so in conclusion, this song really made me worried for zayn for a second.

**skargardin** (5): this abbreviation im‚Ä¶.

**radiofan15** (4.6): In Spanish, Tio is uncle‚Ä¶ think of the implications of having a song about taking your clothes with a title like that. #AlabamaAnthem #IncestIsSharing.

**realboxwood** (4.5): Before listening I assumed TiO was meant to be the spanish word for uncle. I am aware that Zayn is not Hispanic, but I assumed this was all a part of his genius process of making ‚Äúreal music‚Äù. So anyways, I was clearly wrong

#Your Actual Tio

**Leixander** (6): surprisingly not bad

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (6): Bumped up from five to six because I liked the acronym hehe

**NotWith10000Men** (4): i've never really liked sex songs tbh

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4): I think I might have given this a higher score if it came earlier in the album. By this point I'm just very tired of Zayn wailing about sex over these dark synthy beats that I'm praying for the end.

**waluigiest** (4): this is so simple but not even sexy

**CarlieScion** (10): Why is this song so low??? To me, this was an obvious top 10-15 placement, but y‚Äôall apparently hate emotional ballads (looking at you, Kiki). This song just sounds magical and his voice just sounds so warm and comforting.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5.2): this is just too slow and middle of the road for me. and i don‚Äôt like the chorus (‚Äòour paper houses reach the stars‚Äô??? juvenile) and his vocals on it.

---

#Papercraft Masters

**ElizabethDDoS** (11): I'm giving this an 11 simply because I like it the most of my 10s and I can't really pinpoint what exactly sells this song to me. It's surprisingly mellow and bittersweet, and although I can't say much else about it, it just fills a hole in my heart I didn't know existed.

**followingfreeways** (10): this is so fucking sad also i LOVE the very last verse that he adds on randomly before the last chorus of the song. i think this song also showcases his voice really beautifully.

**tinaoe** (9): who hurt you niall

**vhqv1997** (9): I love the lyrics and instrumentation of this song so much, but I'm sorry Niall, you just didn't deliver it with the emotion needed. I feel like the entire song has only one note and even a robot could have delivered more of a gut punch, which is a shame because otherwise this would have definitely been a song I always replay when I'm sad

**pjatteryd** (8): Beautiful

**surelychoo** (8): it's like Long Way Down pt 2 ):

**Verdantshade** (8): the chorus has incredibly pretty lyrics but overall the song isn't too memorable

**martymcflurry** (7.7): That part where he goes ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt wanna lose your touch, I don‚Äôt wanna hurt this much‚Äù is beautiful and really elevates it

**eklxtreme** (7.5): sweet lil ballad

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): This is the closest Niall gets to folk-tinged heartland rock on this album, which is either going to enrage some or make them dance in joy. I‚Äôd usually be in the category that involves the latter, but...I‚Äôm just not a huge fan of Paper Houses, for some reason. I mean, Niall definitely put a lot into this song, and I do enjoy it, but his holistic performance doesn‚Äôt make Paper Houses sound as convincing as it should be; I wouldn‚Äôt use tired words like ‚Äòcalculated‚Äô, but the song definitely could‚Äôve been executed better!

**1998tweety** (7): This feels like it drags on a bit too much at some points, especially with the way Niall sings some lines.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): lyrics good. melody unremarkable

**NotWith10000Men** (7): idk why I like this one but I do. i like the paaaaa-per HOUses part.

#Deforestation Is A Real Problem, Go Paperless!

**radiofan15** (6.2): Niall honey, that's not your register... don't try it again for the sake of everyone's ears!

**ggodisawomann** (4): eugh Niall why

**realboxwood** (4): Oh, this is the type of mediocre indie rock that 11 year old me and grocery stores live on. It does have a tiny bit of folk flair on it at least, but like, just a smidge.

**waluigiest** (3): I wouldn‚Äôt be as mad at how boring this is if the songwriting were at least interesting

**1998tweety** (9.5): I think this was Niall's first solo track, it didn't blow me away at the time but it has its charms. I still find it to be one of the stronger tracks on the album.

**pjatteryd** (9): Played this on repeat too many times

**Leixander** (8.5): classique guitar boy ballad but it is still great

**poppinmmolly** (8): my dad's fave

**waluigiest** (8): this is pretty sweet I guess

**jackisboredtoday** (7.6): The most 1D-esque of the solo 1D hits, but soft ballads like these worked for 1D and they work for Niall on his own too

**believedcrazy** (7): its ok

**martymcflurry** (7): He released this song almost a full year before the album came out, and I have a feeling he ended up changing things later because it kind of doesn‚Äôt fit in with the album. But I think it‚Äôs still a pretty little song.

**numberonejobrosstan** (7): almost exactly what i expected from a niall lead single

**realboxwood** (6): Niall gives one of his best performance here, but that one note guitar riff wears out quick.

**skargardin** (6): Kacey outskinnied

**surelychoo** (6): this song is just a bit bland and too singer-songwriter-y, so when it came out I wasn't looking that forward to his album. luckily he's a genius and came for us fake fans' throats, even making me appreciate this song more in the context of the album

**Verdantshade** (6): something about this song is just so forgettable? I don't know how to explain it but there's something profoundly uninteresting about it

#People Who Summoned The Ginger Demon

**vhqv1997** (10): Wait why are we rating an Ed Sheeran song?

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Remember when this was a bit of a meme due to it being the only Niall single released so soon after One Direction split up? Its lone status was funny for a while, but I‚Äôm not sure it deserves that reputation; with fantastic lyrics that paint a powerful scene stuck in an idyllic past, and folk instrumentals that introduce us to the softer side of flicker, This Town captures all the magic that‚Äôs been long gone from singer-songwriter singles ever since they got more and more milked out to airplay. Full of sincerity and heartbreak in a world that can‚Äôt always afford to be subtle, the song is more or less an Ed Sheeran song that calls back to the time when the latter‚Äôs music seemed like a more private, quality-filled affair. It seems like a bad choice to make a slow song your second on the tracklist, but This Town is great.

**lilacsweetener** (6): revisited this recently and was surprised how I'd completely forgotten the lyrics, it's not that old. It's Ed Sheeran lite, doesn't have much personality but it's pleasant enough. Niall's voice being as versatile as it is helps keep it alive.

#People Who Said The Word Cute

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): This song is super cute and I‚Äôll fight people who think otherwise.

**ElizabethDDoS** (8): Cute, but sounds way too similar to Dear Theodosia from Hamilton OST and it caught me off guard.

**grandmafriend** (7.5): solid n cute

**hikkaru** (7.5): cute

**followingfreeways** (7): sooo cute but bland. a really safe first single i think

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): it's cute but that's it

**selegend** (4): it‚Äôs cute but like not my type of vibe

#Someone Who Did Both

**tinaoe** (7): discount ed sheeran but cute

#City Slickers

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (3.5): This sounds like it came from a CW show and not in a good way, it's painfully boring. This sounds like Phillip Phillips could have written it.

**NotWith10000Men** (3): ugh those opening guitar strums made me instinctively reach to change the radio station. i can't rate the song on its merits because i just don't want to listen to it

**ggodisawomann** (1): if this song was never released, I would be a happier person

**saucymac** (1): This song is so mind numbingly boring I had a visceral reaction where I ranted about moving to mars, but then I listened to flicker and decided this song deserved the 1 instead of 0

**gannade** (0): the mayonnaise

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.1): a little kikina lore for you: my cohost, the stunning kiwina, put ‚Äòfrom the dining table‚Äô on a playlist she made me, so i have a lot of loving feelings about it. and yes. that‚Äôs me, rating a ballad high! i don‚Äôt care! it was delivered to me with love! that‚Äôs that!

#Sims 4 Dining Room Build HD Video

**extrasmallbillie** (11): WHO would hurt Harry Styles like this? I just wanna talk...

**realboxwood** (11): This is an open wound of a song, one that showcases Harry‚Äôs true potential as a singer-songwriter. The instrumentals are minimal not out of laziness, but because being bare and quiet and vulnerable is the right choice. The vocal arrangement is incredibly close and intimate, the lyrics are conversational but revealing. I could devote paragraphs to the bridge alone, with it‚Äôs layered harmonies and rising strings, but I truly don't have the character space. Just know that I love it.

**followingfreeways** (10): can you hear me crying

**roxieloxie** (10): this song would be good if not for the "played with myself"

**Verdantshade** (10): this song makes me want to open a bottle of wine at 10am and cry into a shirt until I pass out. the lyrics are absolutely brutal

**1998tweety** (9): This is a great album closer. Ends the album on a good note that's reflective of the album.

**believedcrazy** (9): love it

**waluigiest** (9): big bon iver vibes, good songwriting, oh man

**radiofan15** (8.7): Book-ending the album with minimalist guitar ballads is kind of a brave choice so I'm gonna give it a pass‚Ä¶ of course I would have preferred more strings (that small segment of the song really spoiled me) but it's still a cute little so I'm not complaining that much.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): I thought this sounds like something that would be played in a This Is Us episode.

**kappyko** (8.5): gorgeous ending

**eklxtreme** (8): love how gentle this is, great closer without being a boring ballad

**skargardin** (8): Cute little closer

**surelychoo** (8): the cello!!!!! the swelling strings!!!!!! the lyrics!!!!! amazing closer

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (8): Harry came to conquer and conquer he did, loved this album

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): Nice, kind of lo fi folk outro. I can't believe I didn't notice the "Played with myself" line before now

**tinaoe** (8): i like an Experiment

**poppinmmolly** (7): I haaaaaaaate the "play with myself, where were you?" line I don't like how he says it. It would have been fine if he said it differently.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Harry decides to end his self-titled debut album with another acoustic ballad, although there‚Äôs no instrumentation as memorable here as in Sweet Creature. He also paints a more intimate picture of himself and his surroundings than anywhere else on the entire album, which does give From the Dining some sort of deviant artistic charm. Unfortunately, nothing about it really sticks otherwise, and while these bare bones are good, they‚Äôre not enough to make a skeleton.

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): least favorite song on the album and the only one i didn't save to my library on the first listen. just needs a little more something

**ImADudeDuh** (6): the strings are pretty, but thats it

**martymcflurry** (6): I'm sorry but I always find this song so boring. My thing with Harry's album is it all sounds good and I like it all, but I feel like there's no personality behind it. I get the 70's throwback and musically I like it all but I'm left missing something - like, who is Harry Styles in dis wurld?

#Banging Your Knee On A Table Corner

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): played with myself where we're you is actually my most hated line of the album

**ggodisawomann** (4): meh

**pjatteryd** (3): I hate the masturbating part so much

**lilacsweetener** (2): like two ghosts it just drains me, in a bad way. I don't enjoy listening to this at all. Points for the rise and fall of hope in the bridge.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): this is one of my favourite zayn songs, the other being lucozade (which we‚Äôll get to, believe me!!) i‚Äôve talked about it before in my 1d pop compass, but there‚Äôs something utterly haunting about befour. it feels like a puzzle to solve, that says so much about zayn and who he is (i‚Äôm convinced the ‚Äòpardon if i don‚Äôt speak‚Äô is a dig at someone in 1d / team 1d....let‚Äôs talk about that), and oh my god, when that falsetto comes in. this is zayn at his best, when his detachment makes sense. this is when his lyrics are pure poetry, nonsensical and evocative all at once. this really is such a brilliant song.

**CarlieScion** (7): Zayn is now down to a whopping 3 tracks left in the rate! That means he‚Äôs lost ten whole tracks - we really hate non-white men, huh? Anyways this track bops and deserved to be a single, in spite of its bad pun title.

---

#He Used To Be In 1D, Now He‚Äôs Out Free

**1998tweety** (10): Wow I was not expecting this. The production is immaculate and the vibe is strong too. It sounds like a Justin Timberlake song, and JT is God so I have to give this a good score. Zayn's vocals are nice on this too. Honestly this sounds like the kind of song this sub who eat up, but I know it'll be robbed cause of the anti Zayn circlejerk.

**ggodisawomann** (10): love

**lilacsweetener** (10): I wish this had remained the debut single as planned, it's a slow burner and would've established much more lyrical personality for Zayn than Pillowtalk which is fairly generic/nonsensical.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): this is the style that zayn does best (aside from sex music)

**skargardin** (9): bop

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (9): I think this is the one song on the album I enjoyed a lot.

**followingfreeways** (8): the TEA it burns me but this song is good even though it's bad for my one direction lovin' heart :(

**surelychoo** (8): point docked for the shade

**Verdantshade** (8): yikes that shade. good song though

**yourhostandpatron** (8): First of all, I am exceedingly angry that this isn‚Äôt the fourth song on Mind of Mine‚Äôs tracklist. I mean, seriously, Zayn?! Okay, now that I‚Äôve got that over with, looking up this song made me discover that there‚Äôs a chance that this song is actually about One Direction. The lyrics are a bit vague, but, hey, maybe the edgy spelling isn‚Äôt all that pointless, then! Good on you, Zayn. I do like this a lot even if it‚Äôs a bit scandalous: there are attempts at melodic variation here that challenge the idea that Mind of Mine is just one boring slag, and the song is in a special place due to its lack of a romantic motif. So far, so good...

**martymcflurry** (7.5): Catchy! Kind of reminds of 20/20 era JT. Buy Four by One Direction on iTunes.

**realboxwood** (7.5): I actually like this song but on the line ‚ÄúI‚Äôve done this before‚Äù Zayn hits a harmony that sounds just like Frank Ocean, and it reminds me that I could be listening to Frank Ocean instead.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7.5): Pretty nice synthy R&B track with really good production. I have a feeling I'd have liked this even better with Justin Timberlake or The Weeknd on it, but with Zayn it's still solid.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): remember when everyone lost it over that instrumental snippet from this in his Fader profile?

**rickikardashian** (6.8): he could have just called this song "fuck 1d lives"

**radiofan15** (6.2): I guess production can really carry anyone.

**kappyko** (6): Not funky but sure is cool

**believedcrazy** (5): this is fun to sing to but thats it

#Fuck Chorus Lives

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): the verses are great, the chorus is kinda meh

**waluigiest** (7): the title pun is legendary, but as a song it‚Äôs kind of meh and the chorus is not too great

**hikkaru** (5): that synth in the chorus sounds so unpleasing oh my god

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this was good but then the chorus hit and whew it went to shit

**NotWith10000Men** (4.5): really hate the weird synthy siren thing in the background during the chorus

**CarlieScion** (7): Since We‚Äôre Alone is basically a One Direction song (this would have fit perfectly in on Made In The AM), however it‚Äôs a mid-tier One Direction song. It definitely doesn‚Äôt need to be a whole four minutes long.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (6): i find niall‚Äôs use of descriptive writing on this album really interesting. if anything, 1d‚Äôs solo songwriting (or lack thereof, LIAM) has been really key to understanding them as a band. while i find this song pretty juvenile and very 1d-tinged, i still find the sentiment sweet and i can‚Äôt help but like it just a little bit. but it‚Äôs much too much like paper houses.

**eklxtreme** (10): essentially what one direction would sound like in 2017, very sweet

**ggodisawomann** (10): this song is FANTASTIC, gets me in the feels

**martymcflurry** (10): This song feels like a warm hug. I want to live inside of it.

**ImADudeDuh** (9): Niall is so much better than the rest of 1D periodt

**Verdantshade** (9): this song is SUCH a mood it's like what a feeling lite. shame the lyrics are kinda basic

**yourhostandpatron** (9): One of my favourites from Flicker; Since We‚Äôre Alone was one of the songs that immediately captured my attention on my first listen of this album, and I‚Äôm contributing to Niall‚Äôs expression of passion and energy, along with this song sharing many traits with On The Loose, including that rush of excitement you get just from listening to it. It‚Äôs a perfect choice to lead people into the middle of the album!

**1998tweety** (8): This feels a little filler-y but nonetheless I like it.

**believedcrazy** (8): its good

**ufohyde** (8): This beat is so cripsy, I love it.

**radiofan15** (7.2): Vapid but pleasant... like a vape pen I guess.

**CarlieScion** (10): Niall‚Äôs title track departs us! This came very close to being my 11, but in the end the power of Harry won out. This is such a hopeful song with a beautiful melody and top tier lyrics. The ‚Äòplease don‚Äôt leave‚Äô is uttered so quietly that it almost feels like a small prayer. In general, just a magical song.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4.3): i used to get excited about this song when it came on shuffle because the intro is like a bastardisation of hozier‚Äôs sound, but i just can‚Äôt do it. i can‚Äôt do it niall. this is.... this is a ballad, niall. i love you, but i can‚Äôt do it. no matter how much you explicitly reference magic. (i will say it drives me insane not knowing who this album is about.)

#Unreadable Graphic Design 

**followingfreeways** (10): this is really just one of the most beautiful songs ever written ever and i wanna cry about it every day

**Verdantshade** (10): I can imagine elena tonra writing and singing this which is probably the biggest compliment I can give the song. niall should be so proud of himself for writing this

**believedcrazy** (9): this has made me cry so many times

**martymcflurry** (9): Ok maybe this is cheating but if you have ever seen Niall live, during this song he asks the crowd to put their phones away and he gets really into it and emotional and the crowd is quiet and totally captivated and it‚Äôs like. A magical concert experience I definitely cried a little. Listening to it normally doesn‚Äôt have the same effect but it‚Äôs still really beautiful.

**surelychoo** (9): god. Is this really the same guy who wrote all the hookup songs on MITAM? who hurt you niall? who broke your heart??

**tinaoe** (9): longing for an ex i never had

**yourhostandpatron** (9): As much as I love This Town, I‚Äôd say that Flicker is definitely the best ballad off the album it‚Äôs named after. Seriously, this captures just how enchantingly sad and well-constructed the narrative of Flicker really is! Niall‚Äôs singing is at its peak mastery here, even though it‚Äôs not too technically impressive; the way he says ‚Äòplease don‚Äôt leave‚Äô is sure to break the heart of several fangirls, including myself. Really, learning about the idea behind Flicker as an album just made me appreciate how integral its title track is more.

**1998tweety** (8): This is cute. I like the bops the most, but Niall does a great job on ballads as well.

**vhqv1997** (8): Same problem as Paper Houses. Niall's delivery holds the song back from its full potential

**ggodisawomann** (7): title track OKAY

**lilacsweetener** (7): devastating

**skargardin** (7): Cute autumn-y tune

#Niall Please Stop Boring Us

**eklxtreme** (6.5): sucks when the title tracks are boring

**NotWith10000Men** (6): a very pretty song, just doesn't really hold my attention except when he goes down on the 'my heart' part

**radiofan15** (5.2): SKIP

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (5): I know it's the title track but it's so forgettable

**Leixander** (5): okay niall where are my bops?? i am leaving,,,

**pjatteryd** (5): It‚Äôs cute but not that exiting

**realboxwood** (5): This song, much like the album named after it, is fine. The singing is competent (but not especially emotional or passionate), the lyrics are competent (but not incredibly cutting or compelling), the sound is competent (but not particularly inspired or memorable). It doesn‚Äôt have any egregious flaws, which might be a flaw within itself. If you can‚Äôt be good, at least be bad in an interesting way.

**waluigiest** (3): stfu

**saucymac** (0): We as humans deserve better than this

**CarlieScion** (10): We have a tie! But what does this splendid track tie with? Find out in like 6 minutes. sHe is one of my favorite Zayn tracks, the chorus is so good and the verses actually match the chorus-quality for once! I do indeed want somebody to love and hold me, you‚Äôre right, Zayn. Who, btw, is down to just 2 songs now.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.7): he really stumbles when his vocal quality doesn‚Äôt match what he‚Äôs singing about, but i can‚Äôt help but love this song so much. (and i think about the ‚Äòdoes another line of blow ‚Äòfore they show her the table‚Äô or whatever it was line getting cut every time i hear it.)

#Being In Vogue With The Girl You‚Äôre Cheating On 

**followingfreeways** (10): zayn can end his career now, there's no way he will EVER top this song.

**hikkaru** (10): BOP OMG i really did think this album was gonna be trash from the first three songs

**lilacsweetener** (10): Stone cold banger, reminds me of Timbaland and Troye Sivan toward the end.

**roxieloxie** (10): This song is honestly so iconic, it has no reason to go this hard and yet

**selegend** (10): bop!

**xmxlxo** (9.3): Took off some points for the phoned-in bridge

**hhiggy** (9): oh this is pure excellence

**Verdantshade** (9): how was this not a single? it's the catchiest song on the album

**grandmafriend** (8.9): a bop i completely forgot about

**jackisboredtoday** (8.7): The moment when Zayn sings "She's cryin out cause she loves me" on this song is the peak of his career and I expect that statement to remain true

**1998tweety** (8.5): Ok wow Zayn hit us with a 1-2. This is a great follow up to to Befour, keeps with the same vibe and production. I did find the bridge and outro were a bit meh though. But besides that it's a stellar pop song.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): lowkey bop

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (8.5): A strong like, those guitars playing on the guitars just really get to me

**ImADudeDuh** (8): tepid bop

**kappyko** (8): saved by the bridge

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): Are you going through Mind of Mine as an entire album? Do you wanna hear something sweet and sensual to your ears again, like Pillowtalk? Well, don‚Äôt worry; She brings you more sexy times from Zayn Malik! There‚Äôs a legitimate criticism to be made that despite the array of decent music Zayn writes, he doesn‚Äôt execute tracks like She excitingly enough to make a lasting impression on most skeptics, but if you‚Äôre like me and you don‚Äôt mind him too much, you‚Äôll probably like the seductive whispers of She. Cheers to that!

**martymcflurry** (7.2): If aim were still around ~bRiGhT LiGhTs, sHe's FaDiNg~ would be a great away message

**surelychoo** (7): ah yes, the damaged-manic-pixie-dream-girl-that-needs-you-to-fix-her song that every male artist has to have

**tinaoe** (7): bops ngl

#Sharing Clothes With The Girl You‚Äôre Cheating On And Calling It Gender Fluidity On The Cover Of Vogue

**radiofan15** (6.6): The way this title is written it seems that Zayn is hiding either an homosexual or a religious reference in the title‚Ä¶ anyway, another cute song I don't wanna hear ever again.

**believedcrazy** (6): i just dont like it as much

**Leixander** (6): not harming my ears like the others, bless

**NotWith10000Men** (6): nothing great but I'd listen to it again. the last 30 seconds is the best part

**ggodisawomann** (5): oay

**waluigiest** (5): ranges from nondescript to messy

**pjatteryd** (4): I think it's pretty boring.

**CarlieScion** (9): Tied with sHe, we have Meet Me in the Hallway! This is a rather psychedelic track with a banging chorus. The guitar is honestly orgasmic and Harry sounds so anxious and frantic in this. The instrumental bridge is also really great. It just isn‚Äôt quite ‚Äòthere‚Äô enough for me to give it a 10.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): sometimes i‚Äôm like ‚Äòself-titled wasn‚Äôt *that* derivative of folk rock‚Äô but then i remember, yeah, it is.

#Popheads Meetup

**vhqv1997** (11): I love this dreamy, psychedelic atmosphere. The guitar-picking sounds great too, very interesting that tugs at your heartstrings.

**lilacsweetener** (10): such a vibe, seeing this live being bellowed by 20,000 fans was a surreal experience

**realboxwood** (10): So close to being my 11. Stark and ethereal and anxious, this song shows off one of HS1‚Äôs greatest strengths; it‚Äôs ability to succinctly capture a feeling, to build an atmosphere and a space within a few lines of a song and hold you there for the next 3 or so minutes.

**roxieloxie** (10): I hated this song until i didnt

**Verdantshade** (10): this is psychedelic folk with a fucking haunting guitar solo and i am LIVING for it

**tinaoe** (8.7): his voice in the chorus man

**eklxtreme** (8.5): great melody

**radiofan15** (8.3): The ghostly vocals and the minimal arrangements really does wonders to highlight how much of a caring artist is Harry in his output‚Ä¶ oh and also to show how surprisingly solid this is as an opener.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): I like how this song has both a spacey out there, almost psychedelic sound to it while also being a nice folk track. It definitely sets the mood for the album well.

**waluigiest** (8): it has a comforting sort of retro sound

**1998tweety** (7): I'm not a huge fan of any of the elements on this song but it's a decent opener.

**believedcrazy** (7): could fall asleep to

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I feel like he is being a indie try hard too much in this song although it‚Äôs decent

**NotWith10000Men** (7): i listened to this album last and it is so refreshing to hear a guitar.

**rickikardashian** (7): i might have listened to this song a million times to the point that i convinced myself that it‚Äôs better than it is but i'm happy living in my own biased fantasy where Harry is the best musician of this age and era, so fuck you

**surelychoo** (7): this song hit me at a low point in my life, and I would listen to "gotta get better" over and over again

#Any Other Reddit Meetup

**ElizabethDDoS** (6): For a cup of coffee by the stairs.

**pjatteryd** (6): Lindsay Lohan said this song is about her

**yourhostandpatron** (6): All the Harry stans are going to jump out on me when they see that I gave this a bad score, so let me explain: I know what Harry was trying to go for too! This is a nice throwback to the more lowkey, experimental side of classic rock that doesn‚Äôt get enough attention from fans of old music nowadays, and I admire him for trying to do something unique to start an album that could otherwise be summed up as a serviceable homage towards his favourite genre. However, Meet Me in the Hallway suffers from production that‚Äôs ultimately just a bit...nauseating, and the poor mixing here isn‚Äôt excused by Harry‚Äôs voice, which, for me, personallly doesn‚Äôt have enough mysticism in it to make it work. I apologize.

**ggodisawomann** (5): get ready for all my scores for this album to be painfully average

**J\_Toe** (5): I can tell this album is well made, but it's just not the kind of music I like :(

**kappyko** (4): verses are sweet beatles references but the chorus is too whiny in comparison, sinks it a lot

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): i had a breakdown over missing taylor the other day (i listened to red deluxe on repeat for ten hours which should explain it) and this is a really sublime song, tbh. we didn‚Äôt choose style because it would be an obvious bonus rate winner (honestly... yeah) but to me this one is a pretty obvious one too. the way taylor sings ‚Äòdidn‚Äôt you flash your green eyes at me?‚Äô makes me go fucking insane every time.

**CarlieScion** (9): Why did we include this, instead of Style? Mainly because we wanted the bonus rate to not be a landslide and because Style already won the All-over Miss Songeniality poll u/letsallpoo did during the Winners Rate. Anyway, this is a really good Taylor-cut, even though it was left on the deluxe edition. It sounds magical and scary, and it‚Äôs such a bop.

#Jake Gyllenhaal 

**1998tweety** (10): a Massive bop, Taylor is a queen periodt.

**extrasmallbillie** (10): this song deserves so much better and deserved to be on the standard version of 1989. Also, RIP Dianna Agron's Alice in Wonderland tattoo.

**followingfreeways** (10): do u hear me crying

**J\_Toe** (10): oh cool Taylor! btw, who is One Eye Open? Hmm?

**jackisboredtoday** (10): one of the best songs of the whole 1989 era, that chorus hits like a hammer... why this was left as a bonus track I'll never understand

**martymcflurry** (10): I go absolutely feral at the ‚Äúdidnt they tell us don‚Äôt rush into things‚Äù part

**skargardin** (10): This is one of my favorite tracks on 1989, deserved a high budget mv etc. etc.

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (10): Am I allowed to revoke my 11 and give it to a bonus song please

**Verdantshade** (10): this is literally one of the weakest songs on 1989 but I'll give it a 10 anyway because it's not bad blood

**believedcrazy** (8): its alright

**tinaoe** (8): not my fave sorry taylor

**vhqv1997** (8): There's a reason this was a bonus song (hint: it's not as good as the tracks on the album)

**waluigiest** (8): she really used to have good music huh

**radiofan15** (7.5): Didn't they dated for like 4 months? [Kiki Note: Oh honey.]

**surelychoo** (7): she really dragged the dead horse out and beat it for two whole album cycles huh

#Style Bonus Rat Winner

**rickikardashian** (10): I'm just pretending this is Style and giving it an 11

**ignitethephoenix** (7): Style is better but I guess we don‚Äôt want an obvious bonus rate winner

**pjatteryd** (5): I prefer the masterpiece STYLE!

#John Mayer

**realboxwood** (3): I remember listening to this song when I was younger and thinking, "no one has a Chesire Cat smile", but Harry actually kind of does. AND I just realized while typing this that he's actually from Chesire. Fine Taylor, you may borrow my wig, but I need it back by tomorrow so be careful with it. Anyways this song sucks

**yourhostandpatron** (7.5): I love Blackbird! Yeah, my apologies, but this is a straight-up copy of a Beatles classic, although, to be fair, I‚Äôm not exactly complaining about that. Whether or whether not Sweet Creature‚Äôs backing rift is shamelessly copied from Paul McCartney or not, it still gives the song a lovely melody, and this is pretty much one of the only acoustic songs from a white guy playing a guitar (oh, wait, Harry isn‚Äôt actually playing the guitar here. He did in the last track, though) that I‚Äôll be able to tolerate this late into the game. Kudos!

It‚Äôs an anthem for the lonely people (without serious romantic relationships, it‚Äôs NOT an introvert anthem @ people who are wrong in the comment section) and I honestly just love it.

#United Ireland

**pjatteryd** (11): On my own is my favorite Niall song, never fails to make me feel better. It is such a fun song, and Niall deserves my eleven.

**followingfreeways** (10): "ill wake up at midday and marry my bed" is the most relatable line ever written

**saucymac** (10): gave this a 10 because it's the first song that hasn't been painful

**yourhostandpatron** (9.5): Can I just take a moment right here to admit that I‚Äôm a complete and total sucker for the folk influences on this album? I‚Äôm saying this in this comment because On My Own is the perfect example of that; it‚Äôs the closest to a hardy folk ballad on the meaning of life we‚Äôll get in the late 2010s (nobody bring up 7 Years or I will strangle them) and while this isn‚Äôt necessarily an accurate recreation of what type of music songs like On My Own ultimately have their origins in, Niall‚Äôs Irish roots here really shine through. A fantastic song, TBH!

**believedcrazy** (9): an absolute banger

**ImADudeDuh** (9): ok we stan an irish ballad, ugh king of loving his heritage!

**martymcflurry** (9): Did you know Niall is Irish? A hungover Sunday mood

**surelychoo** (8): I used to think this song was sad but that was a mistake in judgement. He's single and he's okay with it! It's ok to not be looking for anything serious! It's okay to go out and have fun by yourself! Hell yeah! There aren't enough songs that celebrate being alone like this, and it's really refreshing to hear this positive song among the sea of love songs and pining songs. (how the hell is this just a deluxe track)

**rickikardashian** (7.8): I related to waking up late and wanting to marry a bed

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): VARIETY thank God. i like the slow verses and faster chorus

**kappyko** (7): christian rock but the kind i like

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): This one has a nice U2-esque stadium quality to it. I could definitely see 1D putting this out.

**ggodisawomann** (6.5): she aight or whateva

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): this one sounds a bit more mumford-y than Niall's other tracks... also marrying your bed. Relatable icon

#They‚Äôre Right

**roxieloxie** (10): Act my age found dead in a ditch

**tinaoe** (8): act my age's better cousin

**Verdantshade** (6): this is so niall lol. feels like a solo version of act my age, just a fun song

#Brexiteers

**ignitethephoenix** (5): A little too straight bro country for me. You can do better Niall.

**selegend** (5): what in the dreamworks credits song

**waluigiest** (3): heterosexual

**realboxwood** (2): Anthem for people who think they‚Äôre interesting or unique because they‚Äôre introverts

**Leixander** (1): eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeh

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): perhaps my old rate cohost (/u/strawberryswing1, face throwing a kiss emoji) will kill me for saying this, but this is like, niall doing coldplay? i love it.

**CarlieScion** (7): Closing out the day, we have this cute little Niall track. The chorus is really good, although it is pretty repetitive. I kinda feel like Niall has done this type of song better, several times, on this very album (see: most of the album).

---

#I Am The Sand Guardian, Guardian Of The Sand

**tinaoe** (11): i won't take any argument it's the biggest car banger which is how i judge my songs

**believedcrazy** (10): this is nialls best song

**lilacsweetener** (10): why wasn't this a single????????

**skargardin** (10): The tragedy that this was a deluxe edition track..

**yourhostandpatron** (10): I always love it when a deluxe actually ends with a song that encaptures what an album is supposed to stand for even better than the original closing track, and The Tide is pretty much the perfect example of what I‚Äôm talking about, both musically and lyrically. I really think this is a fantastic summary of the image of love Niall portrays in Flicker that‚Äôs mixed up in a great folk rock anthem, and overall this is pretty much a flawless close to the record.

**1998tweety** (8.5): Cody Simpson is shook (but also go stream him, his new stuff is good).

**surelychoo** (8): Out of the Woods who? (how the hell is this just a deluxe track)

**eklxtreme** (7.5): would be cool to watch live

**radiofan15** (7.2): Why is this the album closer? Like it makes the album felt incomplete...

**pjatteryd** (7): Sometimes it feels like I‚Äôm the only one who talks about this song

**Verdantshade** (7): I don't really have much to say about this song because it's lyrically bland and the lyrics aren't as impactful as something like mr brightside where it warrants this much repeating but it's a much better closer than you and me and it feels appropriately epic

**NotWith10000Men** (6): at least it's marginally upbeat. fine for an album closer

**waluigiest** (6): better than a lot of the album

#SeaWorld

**realboxwood** (5): I‚Äôve already listened to this exact song like 5 times

**ggodisawomann** (2): no I'm sorryyy

deleted: thanks for coming to day two! it all ends tomorrow at **2pm est**! (different time, same place.)

some more ratios:

* zayn: **11**/13 songs eliminated (84.6%)

* harry: **4**/10 songs eliminated (40%)

* niall: **8**/13 songs eliminated (61.5%)

* liam: **9**/10 songs eliminated (90%)

* louis: **2**/5 songs eliminated (40%)

some more numbers and facts:

* louis lost no songs today, so he and harry enter day 3 having lost the same percentage of their "albums"!

* each member has at least one (liam) song that has made it to day 3

* harry and louis are also the only artists to have more than half of their entered songs remaining

songs left:

* zayn: 2

* niall: 5

* harry: 6

* liam: 1

* louis: 3

so harry enters day 3 with the most songs, followed by niall, then louis, zayn, and finally liam!

see you tomorrow!

surelychoo: I think Niall's album suffered from being horribly ordered. All the slow songs in one section so that they start to blend together, all the memorable singles in the beginning, some of the best tracks only on the deluxe? I mean I guess "I don't want it to end" is why they put The Tide as the last track, but it doesn't *feel* like a closer. Paper Houses and Flicker could have been a lot higher if they were in a spot that made them more distinctive imo
