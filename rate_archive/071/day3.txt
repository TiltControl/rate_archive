The 1D Solo Rate Day 3: @Louis_Tomlinson remember when you had a life and stopped making bitchy comments about mine ?
https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ciya6t/the_1d_solo_rate_day_3_louis_tomlinson_remember/

(Shout out to the title tweet prediction winner: /u/Roxieloxie)

Welcome back, Harries and Louies and Liaminators and other people with questionable taste, to the final day of the 1D Solo Rate reveal. We're your hosts, GoWest and /u/CarlieScion, and we hope you're ready to never speak to ~~your bandmates~~ us ever again.

Today we'll be revealing songs 17-1, and 2-1 of the bonus rate, **starting at 2PM EST**. Join us in the popheads [plug.dj](https://plug.dj/popheads/?refuid=6335203), Liam would love to break his concert attendance record (shoutout /u/thereisnosantaclaus).

A quick [Day 2](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/cikoo9/the_1d_solo_rate_day_2_i_can_promise_i_am_not/) recap for you:

* Zayn has now lost 11 of his 13 songs, or 84.6%.

* Harry lost 4 of his 10 songs, or 40%.

* Niall lost 8 of his 13 songs, or 61.5%.

* Liam lost 9 of his 10 songs, or 90%.

* Louis didn't lose any songs, so his total is still 2 of his 5 songs, or 40%.

* From the bonus rate, we lost Zayn's thinly veiled 1D diss track 'Good Years' and Taylor Swift-Styles' 'Wonderland'.

Today, it's going to be a bloodbath, so settle in and follow along as we reveal the ultimate 1D soloist.

And remember:

* The average controversy score is 2.015, also known as 1D's last year together, so any song with a controversy score above this should be considered controversial.

**CarlieScion** (10): The only number 1 hit of the rate is the first to depart us on Day 3. This is a rather controversial track, but I personally love it. It’s sleazy, yes, but the right kind of sleaze. It’s sexy, it’s a jam, it’s well produced. What’s not to love?

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5.8): i remember when pillowtalk came out vividly, because i was a *huge* zayn stan at the time, and i switched my itunes store to new zealand or something to listen early lol! (and a huge gigi hadid stan, but that’s neither here nor there, people.) i loved it. i loved how brazen it was, i loved the poetry of it, i loved zayn having the freedom to write and perform the music he loved. a few years removed, a lot of the shine has worn off. in particular, i find his vocal really languid and unemotional. there are moments i adore, the ‘my enemy, my ally’ line especially, and the implications of the paradise / warzone dichotomy, but overall, they’re just not enough to save pillowtalk from being one of the least felt sex songs, possibly ever.

---

#Paradise

**gannade** (11): Its a bop!

**ignitethephoenix** (11): Definitely a good song choice to start his solo career with. I love the chorus so much and the interesting production. Also I’m glad Zayn sounds like he gives a shit on this song because it wouldn’t work otherwise.

**waluigiest** (11): This came out towards the end of my freshman year of college. My roommate had moved out and I had a big room all to myself. I was battling illness, in hard classes, and pretty depressed. That led to me just laying there and listening to the same 6 songs over and over, and this was one of them. Something about it is just so calming. It’s a horny on main anthem that is still beautiful to me. It also spawned the minor “paradise/warzone” meme. Thank u Zayn.

**1998tweety** (10): The first time I heard this song I did not know now how to feel about it. I could not understand what he was saying half of the time and a lot of the lyrics were super weird (I had no idea what pillowtalk even meant). Nonetheless, I remember this being an absolute event, everyone was talking about this song and it was everywhere. I know a lot of people will say that it's a song not deserving of being #1, but it was so huge when it dropped. Nowadays, you don't have that effect, even though week #1084234 of OTR technically is pulling in more points. Y'all are gonna rob this so I need to pull through with a 10. What a bop.

**believedcrazy** (10): perfect solo song

**poppinmmolly** (10): honestly, still his best. He peaked when he released this.

**rickikardashian** (10): I love this song so much, but I had not searched the lyrics until I did this rate, and damn, his pronunciation truly sucks, there wasn't a word that I got right. He really had me singing "into better days, better days" for 3 years like a dumbass

**vhqv1997** (10): I have no idea that many people don't like this song, but it's so strange to me. What is there about this song that makes it more difficult to swallow than other pop songs that had been put out and are being put out? It's a bop, plain and simple, with good vocals and nice instrumentals. I like it. So it's a 10.

**eklxtreme** (9.5): pretty iconic debut single and it's still a great representation of what zayn is great at

**ggodisawomann** (9.5): the epitome of pop radio but I've always been here for it

**radiofan15** (9.5): As Todd Nathanson once said, this is such an un-sexy sexual song… but at the same time is such an earworm and somehow Zayn's vocals seals the deal for me.

**followingfreeways** (9): this song slaps but also i always think of that one post that was like "with pillowtalk playing in every club there's no way louis hasn't heard it at least once"

**hhiggy** (9): bradford bad boi really did that

**letsallpoo** (9): this is actually a good song and not a bad song

**xmxlxo** (8.7): Zayn finally got to sing about sex and he did it

**ImADudeDuh** (8): peridot, peridot, peridot, peridot, war zone, war zone, war zone, war zone

**numberonejobrosstan** (8): this was a good ass lead single

**lilacsweetener** (7): I go back and forth on this song, I think the way he sings it is what pushes it from mediocre to attention grabbing. It's a star-making vocal performance IMO. I see people's issues with it but I just can't hate this one.

**martymcflurry** (7): this a bop but like we get it zayn. you're not in a BOYBAND anymore you’re an ADULT now and you FUCK

**NotWith10000Men** (7): this song was so overplayed on radio but it still kinda slaps

**pjatteryd** (7): Good for him

**surelychoo** (7): I was underwhelmed by this, considering he left to make 'real music' but this wasn't even that drastically different. Sure, he drops an f-bomb or two and talks about sex, but I was kind of expecting him to get more personal instead of generic romance throughout the entire album.

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Funnily enough, out of all the annoying shit that came out in 2016 (and, no, I’m not just talking about pop music here) Pillowtalk was one of the only hit songs from that year that wanted to constantly get stuck in my head during that saddening little time span. I didn’t like Pillowtalk  back then, though. I actively despised it. The guy sounded so incredibly whiny on Pillowtalk with his stupid little voice, and fourteen year-old me added it on to the pile of things I absolutely hated, along with myself. (Haha! Edgy!) I still maintained it was a bad song until a few months ago, when I listened to it for a bonus rate and I...admitted to myself that it was actually kind of a decent song? I mean, I’m still not a fan of how unintentionally repressed Pillowtalk sounds for a single that’s supposed to be shockingly dirty, but there’s musical ambition in it that I failed to respect until now, and currently my thoughts on it are more ambiguous than negative. It was a good first try for Zayn, and it was probably the right song to release, but I know he could’ve done better - and he did on this album!

**realboxwood** (6.9): Honestly just go listen to the Tyler, the Creator remix

**Leixander** (6): this is a nice song other than the "battole day" hook

#Warzone

**rotating3Dtext** (5.8): kind of… disgusting

**jackisboredtoday** (4.4): put me to sleep

**kappyko** (4): Frighteningly mediocre but not as fucking offensive as it was in 2015 or so

**hikkaru** (3): I feel like this song does not have a melody

**tinaoe** (3): i'm ace and i feel attacked

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (2): Okay, I do actually like the Tyler, the Creator remix of this song, which gives it kind of a Neptunes-y soulful bounce, but I really just do not like the original song at all. The production is loud and obnoxious, leaving me baffled how this song is supposed to be sexy or intimate when combined with Zayn screaming at the top of his lungs. Please just put on some SZA or something if you wanna fuck.

**Verdantshade** (2): this is probably one of the most boring #1 songs I've ever heard and it makes me cringe at how hard zayn tries to establish himself as a 'mature artist'. I'd probably have liked it more if it wasn't the lead single

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.1): i didn’t expect to like this so much, but i did! i do! it’s just good! it’s an earworm! obligatory, is louis a rexhar or a bad bitch? sound off below.

**CarlieScion** (5): Another controversial one! I personally have no idea why you would start your solo career with several collabs - especially one where the other artist has the opening lines? I don’t really like Bebe’s voice and the track almost sounds too crisp and smooth to me. Sorry, guess I’m a pervert, Bebe.

---

#Rexhars and Bad Bitches

**surelychoo** (11): Even if it may not be my favourite song in this rate, nothing can replace the excitement that I went through when this song came out, or the journey that I went through when I played this song on repeat for literal months. Bebe and Louis' voices work so well together. an absolute masterpiece. so good that EXO copied the melody (jk i know it's prob a coincidence)

**yourhostandpatron** (11): Bebe manages to find her way into another rate...how insidious of her, considering her performance in the last one! Thankfully, though, this is actually a goddamn bop and a half. It has the invasively memorable hooks a lot of modern pop music is sadly missing out on, and I’m very impressed by the jobs Louis and Bebe both do here with Digital Farm Animals. I’m hoping this’ll take the crown from Sign of the Times; that’s not likely, but maybe we can stay consistent with our hatred of dad rock this time around! (I like Sign of the Times, FYI. Harry stans, please don’t murder me.)

**1998tweety** (10): This song is so so good, Bebe kills it! That's probably the main issue with this song if you have one; Bebe kind of steals the show from Louis despite this being his debut single. Their voices go super well together, and the beat is great too. I do wish the chorus went a bit harder though.

**followingfreeways** (10): this fucking slapppppssssss it deserves better!!!

**ggodisawomann** (10): tbh I'm sorry everyone hates this song

**poppinmmolly** (10): this is suuuch a bop

**tinaoe** (10): im edm trash okay

**radiofan15** (9.2): Weird flex to have your proper debut single to start with the vocals of someone else and then hiding yours mid-verse in an harmony, but even the cynical in me can't deny this is a catchy earworm that truly deserved better.

**eklxtreme** (9): their voices kinda pair well together

**numberonejobrosstan** (9): this song is for the rexhars and bad bitches only

**hhiggy** (8.5): this is for only the bad bitches. this is for the REXHARS, the BAD BITCHES, and the true rex- the true Bebe Rexha fans, so get the fuck off my chat, good a thousand people gone only 8000 get the fuck off my chat, perverts. don’t play with me! yeah girls, that’s how y- that’s how- y-yeah, don’t let guys step on you! uh uh…absolutely not. you wanna see a real new yorker this is a real new yorker. that’s exactly right, losers. don’t write “fuck me,” i’ll- i- i’ll block your ass. i’ll take you off of fucking instagram…perverts.

**realboxwood** (8.5): This is actually a bop? The production is nice and spacey and Bebe gives a surprisingly great performance that carries the track, although Louis holds his own much better than usual.

**believedcrazy** (8): i love bebe

**pjatteryd** (8): Their voices fit together, it’s fun

**Verdantshade** (8): I really don't like bebe's voice and I wish literally any other vocalist was on this or even just louis solo because he barely sings on the song but overall it's a great pop song

**martymcflurry** (7.8): This song is a rexhar and a bad bitch. Buy and Stream Drag Me Down.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): ok, you can have one good song louis...

**lilacsweetener** (7): "I thought I would own the way I felt" is still a fave lyric. Dig the production and the two work well together even though they're an odd pair. It's a strange song but it's memorable which is important.

**Raykel** (7): It kinda has the same melody as the very start of Hymn for the Weekend's chorus by Coldplay, it has an earworm

**waluigiest** (7): pop music trope but less fun

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): imagine being overshadowed by a collaborator most well-known for being overshadowed by florida georgia line

**hikkaru** (6): a very meh song for two very meh artists

**NotWith10000Men** (5.5): i don't dislike it

**J\_Toe** (5): still don't like Bebe

**kappyko** (5): killing me softly with his song(s)

**vhqv1997** (5): I can't believe it but Selena Gomez has a better Back To You song

#Perverts Get Off My Live Chat

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (4.5): Never been a fan of Bebe's voice, and there's nothing really interesting musically going on here to salvage it.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (4): I loved it. Than I hated it. And listening to it again I just don't want to listen to it again

**static\_int\_husp** (0): Two supbar singing performances that don't go well together. The instrumental is also kinda wierd, half trap, half straighforward pop, that again doesn't mesh well. Just a mess of a song that I'm not sure how one could salvage.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): this was the single that made me go, ‘holy shit, i hope niall gets a #1 out of this’. this is sultry, and smokey, and the vocal effect on this has this vintage feeling without being obnoxious, and the sparse, human instrumentation (claps! stomps!) are perfectly suited to it. the ‘sweat dripping’ line still doesn’t make much sense to me, but even with it, this is a thousand times sexier than pillowtalk. it really indicates the difference in approach to sexuality in art zayn and niall take. that’s not a dig.... it kind of is, but i just vastly prefer niall’s approach.

**CarlieScion** (9): Is it time to slaughter some singles? I unironically digg this bop, even the ‘sweat/laundry’-line. It’s fun, and sexy in a juvenile kinda way. I even like the choppy effects on the vocals, even though I understand why some people find it hard to stomach.

---

#Having A "Thing" For Hands

**1998tweety** (10): Idk why this gets so much hate, outside of a few weird lyrics, it's a great tune. The chorus bops so hard and I love the production on it (I get some people don't though).

**followingfreeways** (10): if you give this less than a 10, ur lying to urself. this is the song of the summer for generations to come. he snapped

**ggodisawomann** (10): I LOVE THIS SONGGGG this was so good to hear on the radio always

**ignitethephoenix** (10): The dirty laundry line doesn’t ruin the song it’s still a bop!

**martymcflurry** (10): Whoever makes fun of the dirty laundry line is a virgin. It’s sexy it’s like we were horny and sweaty so we just took off our clothes. A sexy sultry summer BOP

**grandmafriend** (9.8): not a full ten cause of all the effects on his voice

**xmxlxo** (9.7): Minus some points for sweat dripping down our dirty laundry

**J\_Toe** (9): I would give it a 10 if it weren't for a) the mention of sweat and b) is the beat off? Like, not properly synced?

**Verdantshade** (9): if not for the dirty laundry lyric it'd be a 10

**waluigiest** (9): this kind of bops. Kind of sexy

**radiofan15** (8.9): Catchy and addictive, a fantastic pop tune that immediately lost several decimals points thanks to certain ''dirty laundry'' line.

**tinaoe** (8.9): the deduction is for the laundry

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the vocal mixing annoys me but it's such a bop still

**hikkaru** (8.5): the chorus is incredibly catchy

**numberonejobrosstan** (8.5): king of pop radio

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): It’s easy to say that the most infamous lyric on this song is the ‘dirty laundry’ part. I will never pass up the chance to remind people that Niall sang ‘dirty laundry’ at Manchester instead of This Town or a more appropriate One Direction song. But regardless, this is one of the slumber hits of 2017 that I really like. I’m a bit wary that it’ll be Niall’s only solo song that’ll even be remotely remembered, but folk and strong beats are combined here to make a very catchy slow-burner of a single; Niall isn’t as sexy as some people would expect him to be here, true, but the intimacy is well-captured.

**kappyko** (8): one of the best iheart radio songs ever

**lilacsweetener** (8): It's a bop despite the odd lyrics and that bizarre production. While everyone expected a sweeping epic rock anthem from Harry, let me tell you NO ONE expected Niall to come through with a slutty cowboy jam. But he sounds right at home here.

**surelychoo** (8): a whiplash from This Town but like, in a good way. love the static-y guitar and effects.

**pjatteryd** (7): Did they fuck in his laundry basket

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7): I know a lot of people hate the dirty laundry lyric but this was my childhood so I'm always gonna remember it fondly

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): This is the most mid-50's dad song I've ever heard performed by a guy in his early 20s. It's very cheesy, but there's also something likable about it too. I like the stomping beat and the bluesy guitar in particular.

**Leixander** (6.5): i like the dirty laundry line, it makes no sense but it sounds good, sue me

**realboxwood** (6.5): I like the effect of his voice and wish the rest of the album sounded more like this song, but listening to the lyrics has me half convinced that Niall has never actually had sex.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): the little guitar riff is nice but the rest of this song feels completely unmemorable to me

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): someone once told me that the song sounds completely chopped up and ever since I can't listen to it anymore... The live versions are dope though

**ImADudeDuh** (6): Why did the only song that made the year end list have to be this one, ugh why is flicker's success so frustrating?

**believedcrazy** (5): i dont like the broken up bits

**CarlieScion** (8): Liam is the first artist to lose all his songs - is anyone actually surprised? This song jumped around quite a bit during the month and at one point Liam would have gotten the chop before number 25 even. For You, from the Fifty Shades-franchise, doesn’t sound or feel like a Liam-track, which is probably what made y’all like it so much lol.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): it’s bombastic and orchestral and they both sound good on it. the chorus is pretty, and listen for their ad libs, they’re worth it. i am still angry they did not live duet in front of me when they played the same mini festival i attended.

---

#Bella And Edward

**1998tweety** (11): Ritabots rise UP. Honestly this song should be titled with Liam as the feature instead of Rita cause sings way way more. Their voices go so well together and the production and instrumentals are gorgeous.

**ImADudeDuh** (11): Thank god this is for the 50 Shades of Grey soundtrack, cause I want Liam to tie me up with a froot by the foot and make me chew my way out while he sits, fully clothed in the corner of his room and just watches.

**selegend** (11): Rita Ora really won this rate huh…

**skargardin** (11): I suppose that Liam is getting both my zero and eleven oop. Rita kinda carries this, her voice fits the track perfectly and Liam doesn’t sound embarrasingly bad like on Depend On It, maybe they snappedt

**followingfreeways** (10): 50 shades of grey and liam payne...my two biggest love-hate relationships

**ggodisawomann** (10): I LOVE THISSSS SONGNGNOGDSFJDS Rita is my queen

**hikkaru** (10): rita carries

**Leixander** (10): always here to support miss oral

**letsallpoo** (10): the two defining artists of our generation

**radiofan15** (10): It's not Love Me Like You Do or Earned It, but this such an earworm and such an undeserving song of such a shitty franchise. The backing synths, the explosive chorus and the surprisingly solid harmonies truly cement this as one of the strongest movie tie-ins IMO.

**eklxtreme** (9): rita steals the whole thing, but it's a really cute song

**ufohyde** (9): They did what they had to do, period.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): Why is this better than pretty much the rest of Liam’s entire discog

**martymcflurry** (8.5): They sound great together and have good chemistry

**lilacsweetener** (8): this is so pretty, the 50 shades stigma worked against what is a perfectly great pop duet

**pjatteryd** (8): The soundtracks to 50 shades has No right being good

**surelychoo** (7): Rita carries this song

**waluigiest** (7): for half a second it sounds like run away with me

**xmxlxo** (7): The inferior Fifty Shades 1D single

**yourhostandpatron** (7): Some of my friends are going to kill me for this, but I've never taken the opportunity to get into Rita Ora’s music, simply because I’m too lazy too, and while For You is...good (it’s no Love Me Like You Do, but it’s at least better written than I expected) I can’t just love it like so many other people probably do. Maybe I find that chorus of it to be a bit annoying, which is strange, given the fact that I adore euphoric choruses most of the time! Also, can we discuss the number of supposedly feminist musicians that contributed to the 50 Shades soundtrack? I mean, that’s not something I hold against them in serious terms, but, like, yikes? This is slightly troublesome.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): the original Fifty Shades Soundtrack outsold

**bluetriangles04** (6): Rita carries this

**J\_Toe** (6): still not sure who Rita Ora is

**NotWith10000Men** (5): i think it would be better as a slower song. at least without the fast beat in the background

**realboxwood** (5): This is just bland overproduced movie trailer music, and Liam and Rita do nothing to elevate it beyond that

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (5): I don't blame anyone for not giving their best material to the Fifty Shades movies, so I can't be too mad at this not being very good. Rita and Liam don't have a whole lot of chemistry, and this song is clearly only meant to score a montage for the movie. Thank GOD these movies are over if only just so there's no more soundtrack singles.

---

**Overall Average**: 6.171 **// Average Controversy:** 2.170

---

**hikkaru** (7.150): The verdict from me is that Liam's EP is trash but his loose singles are mostly good (or at least ironically so). He'll most definitely end up flopping real hard other than maybe For You (thanks Rita). Get Low is a bop though so hopefully it's not done dirty

**ImADudeDuh** (6.600): I would like to imagine Liam Payne taking me home after a night at the karaoke bar. We are both sober. Liam acts like he's drunk, even though I never saw him take a drink all night. When we get home, I tell him to go to bed, but he playfully refuses, still acting drunk. I try to get him in, but he won't go. So I then ask what will make him go to bed. He says "Seeing you in that damn bed, fully nude." I run to the bed, take all my clothes off, and then I lay in wait. Liam comes in the room with his entire 5" long, 1.5" wide, circumsized penis just out. We then have sex. Nice.

**yourhostandpatron** (5.900): Ha, ha, ha, I actually found out that I don’t despise Liam’s music as much as I thought I would during this entire rate (I don’t hate his stuff a lot now, I only hate it a little bit) and I still found a way to roast him in...pretty much every comment. Woah. I don’t know why I’m feeling so annoyed, but maybe all the mediocre shit from him I’ve had to hear is sending subliminal messages to my brain and making me more mean. I bet I’m going to become a famous author one day, and I bet these comments are going to bite me in the ass. Either way: Liam, if my old social media accounts are being leaked by people who got angry at my last novel, you seem like a decent person, but I hope you’ve made better music now!

**radiofan15** (4.960): It kinda hurts to see how much fans were hyping up his solo output as he was easily highlighted as one of the most talented vocalists and songwriters in the band... there's some occasional bright moments in his relatively limited output so far, but it's mostly surrounded by bland, by-the-numbers, forgettable, ramen-tasting, warm-water-is-too-spicy-for-me, Timberlake-lite artistic-less transwrecks of desperation and misdirection. I can't wait to see what he does next! [Score of his output so far: D; score of his EP: D-]

**Leixander** (4.250): a collection where liam discusses the same topic in similar variations

**Verdantshade** (4.000): I have nothing good to say about nearly all of liam's songs so instead of commenting separately on all of them I will summarise by saying his solo work is godawful and he needs to stop chasing trends and put effort into his music because he was perfectly capable of writing good songs in 1d

**CarlieScion** (8): And with this, Louis is down to his last and final song. Two of Us is a really strong ballad and in context, it’s just so sad. However, judging it as a whole song, I must admit that it showcases some of the weaker parts in Louis’ vocals (or at least the parts that annoy me the most). Not a 10, but close.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8): i’m not a sociopath? but i did come to find comfort in this song the morei listened to it, so the eight is deserved for musical reasons as well.

#Emo Isn't Dead

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (11): this song makes me cry every time I listen to it. And he sounds great on it

**believedcrazy** (11): this song gives me so much comfort for those ive lost this year

**bluetriangles04** (11): I actually cried

**eklxtreme** (10): louis deserves happiness

**skargardin** (10): this cut deep..

**surelychoo** (10): god..... the absolute cruelty of the universe to have Louis release this masterpiece, finally seeming to accept and move on from his mother's death, and then to have Fizzy pass away so suddenly and unexpectedly as he is promoting it.... I can't listen to this song unless I'm alone in my room because every time I listen to this song I end up sobbing. rest in peace Fizzy ):

**tinaoe** (10): thanks i cried

**1998tweety** (9): Such a sad and emotional song, you can hear the pain in Louis' voice.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Damn I just want to give him a hug

**rotating3Dtext** (9): :(

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (9): I'm going to cry now

**vhqv1997** (9): The better song about his late mother

**yourhostandpatron** (9): I originally went ‘oh, nice ballad’ and settled on giving Two of Us an 8, but I just learned that this is actually about Louis’s now deceased mother, and, holy shit, that makes it all the more heartbreaking! His sister dying only a few months ago only makes the song even sadder; even if Louis is infinitely more privileged than us, he’s had a pretty difficult life, and when he put all this emotion into a song I just feel proper worried about how he must be feeling right now. And I’m not even that familiar with him! I really love every song of his that he’s released so far, but after listening to this, I’m totally okay with the idea of him taking a break to chill out a bit and cope with his sudden losses. My poor son :(

**grandmafriend** (8.5): i just wanna hug Louis he and his family have been through too much

**Leixander** (8): sad aww

**poppinmmolly** (8): this is so sad. Louis doesn't deserve all this loss in his life.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): This is the kind of style I thought Just Hold On would have benefitted from, and it works a lot better. The lyrics on this song are absolutely heartbreaking too, which makes it a bit hard to rate.

**Verdantshade** (8): I'm not fully sure how I feel about this song as it's still relatively new in comparison to the rest of the songs on the rate but it's a very britpop ballad which is a plus in my book. listening to the song now is so heartbreaking considering all that's happened

**waluigiest** (8): i’m crying

**martymcflurry** (7.5): This is sweet and sad :( I just...don’t enjoy listening to it

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): Knowing the story might affect my opinion but Louis' performance of the lyrics here really makes this song work. I doubt I'd like it as much without context but with context this song can get to me

**followingfreeways** (7): :(

**lilacsweetener** (7): it's lovely and obviously twice as poignant now but for me it's not one I revisit often, if at all.

**numberonejobrosstan** (7): ):

#Heartless Bastards

**radiofan15** (6.7): Would it be heartless of me to say that even while knowing the context of the track (and feeling sorry for what he went through) I just didn't care that much for this song?

**NotWith10000Men** (6.5): "just to hear the answer phone"?

**Raykel** (6): I know the meaning behind this song but the production sounds so cheesy

**pjatteryd** (4): Booooring

**CarlieScion** (9): I just really love the chorus on this, it’s so explosive! People had some different takes on this, with some loving the song and others calling it a WMYB-rehash. It can be both, people! It’s a positive anthem and I want Niall to call me beautiful every single day of my life. Sue me.

#See Your Reflection In The Snow Covered Hills

**followingfreeways** (11): so im gonna copy and paste my comment from my live rate from the very first time i listened to this song.. " oh m god? og mygd?? o OH M GOD THIS CHORUS IS S IGOOD? WHAT THE FUCK IM LITERALLY FREAKING TH FUCK OUT THIS IS THE BEST SONG. THIS IS THE BEST SONG. WHT THE FKCK. THIS NEEDS TO BE A SINGLE OH TMGOD. IM FUCKING BALD. 100/10" and i still feel the same way!!!! heres my 11!!!! the best song ever!!!

**grandmafriend** (11): Mirrors was robbed - it shouldve been on the regular album and released as a single

**roxieloxie** (11): This song means so fucking much to me oh my god. Like oh my god Im in looooove with it. I dont even know how to describe how this song fuels me but it truly truly just fills me with so much energy.

**eklxtreme** (10): more one direction vibes, great fucking chorus

**martymcflurry** (10): Writing an entire song about basically boosting young women’s self esteem? AND making it slap?? Feminist king part 2.

**1998tweety** (9): The lyrics on this are cute. Why is this a bonus track when it's better than the second half of the album?

**ignitethephoenix** (9): Potential Anti-Vaxxer Justin Timberlake found dead in a ditch by Niall due to measles

**radiofan15** (8.4): This is cute but why does everyone treats it like the Second Coming of our Lord Rihanna Christ?

**believedcrazy** (8): its good

**pjatteryd** (8): I hope the Pret a Manger girl is doing fine

**skargardin** (8): He really came thru with the bonus tracks, whew

**surelychoo** (8): that prechorus going into the chorus unf (how the hell is this just a deluxe track)

**vhqv1997** (8): I was born with glass bones and paper skin. Every morning I break my legs, and every afternoon I break my arms. At night, I lie awake in agony until my heart attacks put me to sleep.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): Look, I’m still bitter over Locked Out Of Heaven losing the men’s rate, even if I actually had nothing to do with that! I initially dismissed Mirrors as one of the more forgettable songs on Flicker, but after reading up on what most other fans have to say about it, I’m pretty sure I’ve changed my mind. To be honest, I still think the melody could use a bit of work, but if this isn’t an enjoyable addition to this album then I don’t know what is.

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its good but i remember nothing about it besides "its good"

**NotWith10000Men** (6): it had me until all the voices kicked in on the chorus. makes it sound very generic

**waluigiest** (6): sure

**ggodisawomann** (5): she aight too

#Oh No Sir, Today Is My First Day Out Of Doors And Papa Forbade Mirrors In The House Lest We Fall Victim To Vanity 

**Verdantshade** (4): something about the chorus really irks me... like it sounds like something out of a bastille or imagine dragons song (not a good thing) and he spends the rest of the song singing about this girl but suddenly in the chorus it's about himself? or has he become the girl? idk

**realboxwood** (0): You’re beautiful, have you ever been told? Assumedly this song resulted from putting What Makes You Beautiful and Little Things into a blender and then shaving off the top layer of corporate boyband cynicism (but only the top). At least WMYB is a bop and Little Things has lyrics that are condescending and bad in an intricate way, thanks to being written by Ed Sheeran.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (8.8): i love maren, first of all, but second of all, this is a scream along as you’re in the car driving kind of song, and those are the best kinds of songs. maren and niall sound good together, and the song is just.... it’s like ear candy. i have country roots, which definitely influences my feelings, but i love it.

#Abortion Access

**letsallpoo** (11): my two birth mothers

**napsandnetflix** (11): this is the best song in the rate, therefore i will give it my 11

**poppinmmolly** (11): this is so sweet, so wholesome. I stan Maren, of COURSE this is my 11.

**1998tweety** (10): Maren is a queen and deserves all the success in the world. This duet works really well, you can tell they have great chemistry.

**pjatteryd** (10): Maren and Niall match soooo good

**surelychoo** (10): CUTEST SONG EVER

**Verdantshade** (9): I'm not really a fan of maren morris but this is hella cute

**numberonejobrosstan** (8.8): come thru country king!

**vhqv1997** (8): Maren Morris sounds so good here! But the guy she's featuring doesn't

**waluigiest** (8): pleasant

**yourhostandpatron** (8): A country song? On my folk pop album? It’s more likely than you think! Featuring one of Popheads’ favourite memes, Seeing Blind stands out as one of the most energetic songs on Flicker, and it also clashes a bit in contrast with the rest of Niall’s soft spoken music by default. You could argue that the difference detracts from Seeing Blind as a song, but while it is a bit odd in the grand scheme of things, I can’t imagine this album’s tracklist without it. Really, you could say the song is truly necessary because of its portrayal of a love with a heart that beats fast, bringing Flicker’s story into full action.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): the instrumental is boring but their vocals slay

**hikkaru** (7.5): :maren:

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): this one's cute! their voices go really well together

**radiofan15** (7.5): Maren is quite invisible on this one, isn't it?

**realboxwood** (7.5): This is nice and fun, and Niall and Maren have the most chemistry out of any collab on this list.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (7): I like Maren Morris better on this track than I like Niall but that's okay

**followingfreeways** (7): a really sweet song! not a huge fan of the sound but i do love it a lot. the harmonies are really beautiful

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): hello harmonizing!!! their voices blend together really nicely, which is good since this would have probably been more forgettable if either of them made it solo

#Alabama/Northern Ireland

**J\_Toe** (6): still don't know who maren morris is

**ImADudeDuh** (5): I don't think I've ever tried to like a song as hard as I have with this song

**ggodisawomann** (3): this only gets a 3 bc Maren is on it

MrSwearword: And in a 6:2:1:1 ratio, Harry Styles for some god awful reason dominates the Top 10. Niall is hanging tight with 2 songs while Zayn and Louis are clinging for dear life with 1 song each.

**CarlieScion** (10): This is a really cute ballad. It’s a folk-sounding Sam Smith-esque track - and I actually like most Sam Smith songs. There’s something magical about this track too, as it is with most of Niall’s album. It sounds pretty, it has beautiful lyrics and Niall calling me ‘love’ makes me swoon.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7): this is niall doing adele on 19, but it works for me. i always end up with the chorus stuck in my head after only a listen.

---

#Being Owed A Favour

**1998tweety** (10): Out of all the songs on this album, this one is definitely my favourite. Niall does a great job conveying emotion while singing. The chorus in particular is great.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Why am I crying in the club right now?

**selegend** (10): the chorus is so good tbh

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (9): his voice sounds so good here

**followingfreeways** (9): i will never forget when i heard this song for the first time and dropped my jaw for real when niall said fuck. i still live for it. this song is great

**Leixander** (9): love how he sings the chorus

**letsallpoo** (9): please impregnate me

**Verdantshade** (9): this is a really good ballad, it's really pretty and sad and also has niall actually swearing on a song. I think it does the same titled arctic monkeys song justice

**vhqv1997** (9): This sounds like an early Taylor Swift deep cut

**grandmafriend** (8.6): not appreciated enough

**xmxlxo** (8.5): Plus .5 for Niall catching me off guard by using a curse word

**jackisboredtoday** (8): the legitimately good late-career Fray single the Fray never had

**lilacsweetener** (8): I wish this single got more attention because the lyrics are fantastic. "Someone's moving outside" and the way he sings it gets me every time for some reason.

**martymcflurry** (8): It DOES feel fucked up we’re not in love, Niall

**pjatteryd** (8): It’s not

**surelychoo** (8): a whiplash from Slow Hands but like, also in a good way. at this point I had no idea what the album was gonna be like but I was completely along for the ride. Niall's singing has improved so so much since the X Factor; his voice absolutely makes this song.

**yourhostandpatron** (8): I heard lots and lots of ads for this on Spotify back in the day in spite of it being not much of a hit at all, which mystifies me. I mean, Filipinos love soft ballads like these, so I guess I’m not surprised that it showed up so often. I’m surprised Niall didn’t record a badly pronounced ‘Hello, Philippines!’ message to tack onto those ads, actually; Bebe Rexha did, after all! I do like this, but I think This Town packs more of an atmospheric punch to it. There’s a reason why I didn’t want to check this out immediately last year.

**eklxtreme** (7.5): sweet and kinda grows on you, but on the loose deserved to be the promo single

**believedcrazy** (7): but like only cause he swore

#Owing Someone A Favour

**radiofan15** (6.7): He sounds painful on the song... and by painful I mean The Fray painful, which means being in a lot of pain.

**realboxwood** (6): There are a few moments when Niall does something interesting with his voice and a few lines of compelling melody or riffs, but other than that, this song is just… fine.

**NotWith10000Men** (5): slow and boring. his voice isn't amazing or anything so there's just not much to say

**waluigiest** (4): cookie cutter with no spice

**ggodisawomann** (3): I fucking hate this song but it's not as bad as This Town

**CarlieScion** (10): Harry has FAR too many songs left, don’t you agree? Well, this is a song that I personally love - I’m really intrigued by Haylor as a relationship or PR stunt or whatever. This song sounds really mournful and sad and the lyrics reflect that. I know that there’s some people who dislike ballads (@kiki) but this is a good one and I’m sad that it isn’t higher in the rate.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): his lyrics are fine in this. (red did this sound way better, though.) to quote kina, when i showed her my first review, ‘tbf if the fridge light is the only source of light in the room u should probably save the enviorment, close the fridge door and just turn on the actual light’. this is why she’s the only person who could host this rate with me.

---

#Caspar

**rickikardashian** (11): Honestly this has been one of my easiest 11s ever. While most the album took a few listens to grow on me, Two Ghosts captivated me from the first listen. The descriptive way that the lyrics are written are clear enough to get a nice image of what is being such, but not vague enough to leave some stuff a mystery. "We're just two ghost standing in the place of you and me, trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat" is one of the prettiest lines I've ever heard, and I would love to be able to experience this song for the first time again, because there hasn't been that many songs that moved me so immediately and strongly as this song did

**believedcrazy** (10): this made me cry

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This song is basically the epitome of soft rock Harry really did that

**Verdantshade** (10): 'the fridge light washes this room white / moon dances over your good side' vs 'we're dancing in the kitchen under the refrigerator light' I'M CRYING

**followingfreeways** (9): roxie dont talk to me for giving this a low score, your lack of taste HURTS me. this song is beautiful

**ImADudeDuh** (9): oh shit, im sad

**NotWith10000Men** (9): "two ghosts standing in the place of you and me"

**surelychoo** (9): this song feels different from the rest of the album. maybe it's the fact that it was written three years ago, or maybe it was the fact that this song is the song that feels the most personal to harry, from its lyrics to the way he sings it.

**vhqv1997** (9): Is it just me or does this sound a lot like You And I by Lady Gaga? Could just be they have the same rock and roll influence

**1998tweety** (8.5): This is cute, I like the lyrics, they're quite good.

**eklxtreme** (8.5): the subtle harmonies whew

**Leixander** (8.5): nice guitar beat

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): Can everybody say ‘Haylor’ for me? HAYLOR! Thank you, thank you. Whether or whether not you believe Two Ghosts and a certain other song on this album are actually about a certain ex of Harry’s, you have to admit that it is, by far and away, one of the most original and heartfelt moments off this album (which is ironic, given the fact that it’s a wee bit more pop than rock). Harry’s softness here is incredible, and it plays off well with the slow, faded nature of Two Ghosts; ultimately, the song is a triumph. Oh, and apparently Harry actually plays the guitar here, so that’s a plus, too.

**kappyko** (8): WHY WASNT SIGN OF THE TIMES LIKE THIS

**waluigiest** (8): sweet stuff two ghosts ...... :(

**radiofan15** (7.7): Cute but sorta unsubstantial ballad. Of course this would have been another smash hit in the 70s.

**ignitethephoenix** (7): insert Taylor Swift comment here

**martymcflurry** (7): I like You and I by Ms Gaga better

**pjatteryd** (7): He has a really strong fridge light, apparently

**realboxwood** (7): Lyrically this is one of Harry’s finest moments, even if the instrumentals leave something to be desired (it’s either the uninspired drum line or the rise and fall of the melody, probably both). The Spotify Singles version is absolutely a 10 though.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): Without those nice little guitar licks, this would sound like an Ed Sheeran song. Harry's vocals and the guitar elevate it a little bit.

#Pennywise

**jackisboredtoday** (5.9): weird how taylor's most clearly "about Harry" song is one of her best but Harry's most clearly "about Taylor" song is one of his weakest

**lilacsweetener** (2): the lyrics are pretty but this song just drains me every time, it's depressing in a bad way

#Thank You Roxie, I Am Right

**roxieloxie** (0): i use this song as a measure of how depressed i am, if i can make it through it ,,,oh boy. Gowest may be right when it comes to hating ballads

#The Big Apple

**ufohyde** (11): This reminds me of the original Spyro The Dragon theme song. It's so nostalgic and perfect.

**Verdantshade** (11): ok so I don't think the studio version is perfect but I was floored when harry debuted it on SNL - I think the studio version lacks some of the oomph it has live and it suffers the problem of not having a proper bridge/ending. on the other hand it's melodically, lyrically and instrumentally my favourite song harry has done. it has a timeless feel to it and it never fails to get me emotional

**ignitethephoenix** (10): This is a lovely song

**roxieloxie** (10): I dont know what this song is doing but i love it

**realboxwood** (9.5): I love Harry's voice and the he emotion he brings to each performance, it makes the okay songs good and the good ones great.

**believedcrazy** (9): its such an old man song but i love it

**followingfreeways** (9): makes me Hella emotional for no reason

**martymcflurry** (9): my other favorite on the album - it’s haunting and beautiful.

**yourhostandpatron** (9): One of the most breathtaking songs on Harry Styles, Ever Since New York is one of those rare songs that effortlessly manages to transport yourself into another place and another  time, all from the point of view from the artist performing it; the soft, folkish touch Harry delicately applies to this song is what makes it work so well, essentially making this track into a better version of whatever Mumford and Sons is trying to do. In some ways, this song emulates the best times for 70s soft rock very well.

**1998tweety** (8.5): This gets a little stagnant at points, but besides that it's good. It does have a nice vibe to it though which I like.

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): see other dudes from 1D? you don't need a shit ton of funky beats to make a good song

**radiofan15** (8.3): Who would have thought that the British half of Haylor would be the one with the superior New York song?

**Leixander** (8): tell me something i don't know is suing as we speak

**tinaoe** (8): the drum line is grand

**vhqv1997** (8): Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you. Welcome to New York, welcome to New York.

**waluigiest** (8): simple but beautiful lyrics on top of interesting percussion oh yeah

**eklxtreme** (7.5): smooth

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): even hearing this the first time it felt so familiar, as if it were something i'd already grown to enjoy over a period of time

**lilacsweetener** (7): this works better live than on record IMO, for me it's a bit meandering even though it's nice and very heartbreaking (likely about his stepdad's cancer diagnosis)

**surelychoo** (7): rest in peace Robin ):

**pjatteryd** (6): I like it but not as much as the other ones lol

**CarlieScion** (9): This track is SUCH a bop. The story behind it is slightly gross, if we take Harry at face value (which you should NEVER do because all men do is lie). Is it about a woman? Is it about cocaine? Who knows, but it sure as hell is a good song.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (7.7): when harry is trying to sound like the beatles i actually enjoy it very much.

**hhiggy** (11): SHE'S A GOOD GIRL

**rosesmp3** (11): this is a banger and a half

**NotWith10000Men** (10): very summery/beachy/end of a movie-ish

**pjatteryd** (10): I wonder what she did to get this song

**roxieloxie** (10): who the fuck names their child townes

**Verdantshade** (10): this is beatles as fuck. not really sure how i feel about the 'she's a good girl' lyric but it bops

**radiofan15** (9.2): Another HIT song from a yesteryear era from modern-day Harry (ooh yeah).

**eklxtreme** (9): love the oldies jam feel

**kappyko** (9): oh now this is a song i would like in the top 4 and maybe top 3

**poppinmmolly** (9): my dad told me that this reminded him of a Beatles song (which is a high compliment, since my dad is a Beatles stan)

**realboxwood** (9): Such a top tier bop, rich and sleazy and great for speeding down the highway on a summer afternoon. Shame it has such a weak chorus.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (9): The hook on this song bops HARD. It's one of the best blends of throwback and modern styles on the album, it has a sick bassline, and those 'la-la-la's in the prechorus absolutely slap.

**waluigiest** (9): fun and good writing

**1998tweety** (8): This is nice. It sounds super different but Harry sells it well.

**believedcrazy** (8): its a bop

**surelychoo** (7): this song is about cocaine

**yourhostandpatron** (7): I’m sorry; I really did enjoy Carolina very much until a few weeks ago, but I hadn’t revisited it for awhile, and when I had to listen to it again for this rate I was forced to acknowledge just how bad the mixing here is. I know Harry’s trying to emulate the atmosphere of a 70s record here, but I don’t think he really gets it, and for that matter, neither do I; why don’t most albums I listen to from that decade immediately make me dizzy like Carolina does, then? This is still a bop, but is barely gets a pass.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.8): until that chorus hits this sounds like something i'd hear in the background of a commercial but not necessarily in a bad way

**Leixander** (6.5): lalallalalalalalal

#Harry Styles Not Telling You He Wrote A Song About You And Effectively Throwing You To The Wolves

**CarlieScion** (11): My 11 sadly goes out before the top 5. I’m also the only 11, wtf guys. It’s a bop, its glamorous, it’s everything I want in a pop rock song. It was a great tour opener when I saw Harry live - the opening magical and shimmery notes going into that scream? That scream that nearly made me yell when I first heard it on Midnight Memories? I love it. It’s a perfect track. And y’all paid it dust! It should have been in the top 3 over some other, more questionable Harry-songs.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (5): sometimes i’m like??? i love this? then i’m like?? i hate this???? what the fuck is this song???

#People With The Taste Of Middle Aged Fathers

**eklxtreme** (10): love the catchy instrumentation and the alt vibe

**numberonejobrosstan** (10): a perfect song

**poppinmmolly** (10): I've said this before, but this should have been the album opener. It's grand. It's extravagant. It has themes and lyrics alluding to other songs on the album. It's a PERFECT opener and Harry missed an opportunity.

**Verdantshade** (10): I thought this was definitely the weakest song on the album initially and the intro is just unnecessary but oh my god this is wild live. the cowbell is a bit loud though

**xmxlxo** (9.6): This song has foreplay for one minute and a climax for the other four

**radiofan15** (9.5): With that intro I might have expected this one after Sign of the Times, but oh well, wasted opportunities… anyway, this is a bop and that cowbell is everything.

**believedcrazy** (9): i love the build up omg

**Leixander** (9): heavenly intro that has a michael jackson cameo

**NotWith10000Men** (9): love me some rock. the HEY HEY part is really good

**pjatteryd** (9): A Bop™

**1998tweety** (8.5): The intro to this is gorgeous..and then we get a random shift. I'm not against it, but it felt just a little too sudden. With that said though, the second bit is pretty good. I really really wanted to hear a guitar close out the track though, felt like I was just edged and didn't get to climax.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): This song gave me whiplash with the quick style change but I like the change. I love the ooo’s in the song.

**realboxwood** (8.5): My problematic fave! It has some questionable lines but also some of the best on the album, specifically the first couplets of each verse. And besides, it's a banger!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): I love when Harry gets his glam on, and those "woo-hoo"s absolutely send me here. The song's a little bit too long though.

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): This is the only song I didn’t immediately associate with some feeling of love or disgust (okay, disgust is too far, my lowest score on this album is a 6) when I look back at the tracklist for Harry Styles, mainly because I’d forgotten anything about how it sounded. Ladies, gentlemen, and nonbinary friends: I was wrong. Please ignore everything I say from now on about music. Maybe I’m excusing the loudness war-era mixing over here, but every time I listen to Only Angel now, it goes off hard. Harry, please forgive me.

**martymcflurry** (8): lyrically I don't love it but. It's a bop.

**selegend** (8): slaps

**surelychoo** (8): an EXPERIENCE

**waluigiest** (7): intro truly threw me for a loooop and then it goes to his standard yell pop rock

#A Collection Of Negative Opinions

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): honestly i was enjoying the intro more than the song that followed

**lilacsweetener** (6): sometimes the rock edge of harry feels like a kid playing dress ups and I think this is an example of that, like he's trying too hard to be Mick Jagger here

**ggodisawomann** (5.5): it's okay

**ImADudeDuh** (5): what the fuck is he saying on the bridge

**hikkaru** (4): this is so dadrock it hurts

**kappyko** (3.5): this one's a little wanky. the .5 is the cowbell

**CarlieScion** (10): Bet you thought this wouldn’t get this far! Miss You is everything I want Louis to further dabble in for his debut album - catchy choruses, pop punk influences and lyrics you want to shout along to. It’s a solid pop song with both EDM and pop punk influences. I love it.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (4): pop punk was never really for me. but i appreciate the meaning of this nonetheless.

---

#Viva Pop Punk

**hikkaru** (11): I really actually don't like Louis's voice at all - Back To You suffers greatly because I think he's just... not good at singing. But Miss You makes me realize that the heavily-accented talk-singing sort of thing that he does actually works REALLY well with the bratty pop-punk vibe that the song goes for. The anthemic chorus is so amazing and sucks me directly into the story of the song, contrasted so well with the last few lines as the chorus comes to an end. I did NOT expect to come into this rate giving Louis my 11 and trashing critical-darling Harry but... here we are and I really hope this can even come close to beating out some of the more popular and well-known songs in the rate.

**1998tweety** (10): What a HUGE bop. This should've been his lead cause it has so much edge and personality to it and it's catchy.

**lilacsweetener** (10): another top lyric: "We're singing til last call/But it's all out of tune" - so perfectly on theme. Louis sounds right at home in this pop punk sound and brings the right amount of wry humour and awkward heartbreak to the performance. I feel like he really tapped into his own essence with this song and will be sad if there's nothing similar on his album.

**numberonejobrosstan** (10): this is a bop idgaffff

**skargardin** (10): Underrated as FUCK I hope this miraculously sneaks its way into the top ten

**tinaoe** (10): maybe i'm just louis trash

**Verdantshade** (10): we stan pop punk louis. this is SO SO good and fully deserved to be every bit as iconic as sk8er boi

**eklxtreme** (9.5): it has a nice 2000s pop vibe, and it almost sounds like dancing crazy so that's a plus

**believedcrazy** (9): i really like the diversity between the chorus and verses

**pjatteryd** (9): Louis best song, yet. It sounds like the average one direction song

**yourhostandpatron** (9): More pop punk, please! Don’t let the genre die! I’d already been very surprised with how much I was enjoying Louis’s music when Kina gave me the playlist to this rate in advanced, but Miss You happened to be the song where I started to sit down and begin considering the fact that my boy may have had the best solo career out of all the other One Direction members, after all. I mean, the personality here? The blustering swagger? Everything about Miss You is pretty damn awesome, which is more than what I can say for (ahem, I’m sorry) Liam’s failed attempts at the same kind of attitude Louis is going for here. Perhaps the less gentrification there is, the better? :thinking:

**grandmafriend** (8.6): actually my fave of Louis

**martymcflurry** (8.5): now THIS is a bop. I want a pop punk revival so badly. More of this!!

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): Here's hoping when he eventually gets around to releasing a full project its in this vein, since the crunchy guitars work and the hook here soars in a way that demands an out-of-tune singalong like he references. This deserved more attention

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (8): I'm here for Louis swearing

**ignitethephoenix** (8): Sounds like a deep 1D cut rather than a individual song from Louis.

**realboxwood** (8): I was a pop punk kid, and a pop punk kid is a pop punk kid until they die

**surelychoo** (8): I love Louis' voice so much have I mentioned that? also love the violin floating around in there

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): i really like his voice in this

**NotWith10000Men** (7.5): oh my God i haven't heard a real guitar in so long

**J\_Toe** (7): best Louis song I've heard so far.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (7): I wasn't expecting to like this from the pop-rock style of the first verse, but holy shit that chorus!!

**waluigiest** (7): a lot of this is good but he really fumbles it with the chorus imo

**radiofan15** (6.5): There's a huge disconnect between the punky verses and the more subdued and poppier chorus but I can't say I hated this song at all just because the sum of its parts wasn't as good as the final result.

**Leixander** (6): cute (the guitar section i heard like a million times though)

#Pop Punk Is Dead

**ImADudeDuh** (5): this is such a 10 yet such a fucking 0 at the same time...

**Raykel** (5): Sounds like those pop rock that'd become hits back in the late 00s/early 10s but like not as good

**Overall Average**: 7.167 **// Average Controversy:** 2.047

**yourhostandpatron** (8.800): Oh, fuck it. As a complete and total neophyte to the vast, confusing world of One Direction, I’ll be brave enough to say that despite the fact that I came in totally unfamiliar with Louis’s solo career sans Back To You, I came out feeling extremely ravenous for seeing more of what the lad will have to offer when he gets his solo career going into motion. I fear that may not happen soon enough, but, wow, Louis can write bops. Like, hello, why did nobody tell me about Miss You before?! And, holy shit, he can be absolutely devastating with his music too. Specifically, Two of Us is just...I’m alright with him going a bit slow for now (see my comment for the latter song), but until then, I will be patiently waiting for Louis to release his debut album and slay me. The world is not prepared.

**hikkaru** (7.800): Somehow Louis of all people has my highest average and I did not expect that one bit going into this

**Verdantshade** (7.800): louis was easily my favourite until the hiatus but his music has been very much hit or miss for me and he's faded from the public eye quite a bit (which is understandable considering everything him and his family have been through) whereas harry has a defined aesthetic that I can identify with. I still really love louis though and have high hopes for lt1 - one thing I noticed is his music overall sounds the most similar to 1d's and it really solidifies him as a fantastic pop songwriter

**Leixander** (6.100): might be a hot take but i like his voice the most out of this five

**radiofan15** (5.740): I understand the circumstances of him delaying his solo career for too long, and the fact that a 5-songs sample might not be the best way to judge someone's artistry (specially when they're just beginning) but I couldn't care less of what he does next musically speaking of this is the best he could release in 3 years. [Score of his output so far: C-]

**ImADudeDuh** (4.200): I would like to imagine myself having a restraining order against louis and he isn't allowed to get near me.

**CarlieScion** (7): So, y’all thought this would win, did? However, there are quite a few people who vehemently disliked this, so this rock-inspired ballad gets chopped at #4. Don’t worry though, Harry still has a horse left in the race.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (1): i am not giving a 0, but if i did, it would be this. this is absolute wank. i understand that it’s ambiguously maybe about harry’s step-father’s illness, and i do respect that, but it’s the most self-aggrandising and simultaneously unemotional approach to grief?? i resent being told to stop crying. ugh it’s just so soulless and the length is absolutely unnecessary.

#Green Book

**InfernalSolstice** (11): i never liked one direction when they were big because i thought they were "just for girls", however sign of the times was so fucking amazing that it made me get into all of one direction solo and group music and for that i'm so grateful

**jackisboredtoday** (11): This stopped me in my tracks the first time I heard it and its as good now as it was then. The vocals convey all sorts of emotion and the instrumental around it sounds like the world burning down as you mourn. I love it

**NotWith10000Men** (11): so beautiful. so sad. his voice is really strong. i love the dreamy quality of the prechorus

**numberonejobrosstan** (11): i know y’all said don’t give this song the 11 but like- it’s a masterpiece of a song it still makes me feel something 2 years after its release and after i played it to DEATH when it came out that says something

**radiofan15** (11): One of the strangest debut singles ever donde by any "pop" star, a 6-minutes long throwback-rock ode to a mother saying her last words to her child as she dies after childbirth. A really strange and unique song indeed; and yet, one of the most beautiful to became a mainstream hit. Im rooting for Harry and everything but I wouldn't be mad if this is his peak because WHAT A FANTASTIC AND UNIQUE SONG HE PEAKED WITH.

**Raykel** (11): Best member of the 1D boyband. Most underrated song of the year 2017. Ballad of the century. Truly a sign of the times.

**saucymac** (11): Harry is a a true icon for bringing dad rock back

**static\_int\_husp** (11): This is THE. SONG. I have cried to this song multiple times. It's just such a sad and moving song, and then last few minutes are so intense. It's a far cry from One Direction, but honestly, that perfectly fine by me.

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (11): Just everything in the song. I loved the production, the vocals, and the way it felt so lifting and had the best swell of any of these songs.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (11): Truly a masterpiece. Definitely some heavy 70s influences, but Harry never gets buried in them. It's an epic journey of a track, with rising and falling intensity as the softer verses build to the beautifully layered prechorus and finally that incredible, soaring hook. Harry sings his ass off on this one and he better get some respect for it.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): an absolute behemoth of a song, it wasn't popular enough to really be remembered probably but it just feels like a classic yknow

**1998tweety** (10): Obligatory 10. I'm not gonna bother saying anything cause I'm sure there will be several essays. A great song with great vocals great pacing great lyrics and an amazing payoff.

**believedcrazy** (10): genius

**followingfreeways** (10): so quintessential harry, i love this song and love him so much

**hhiggy** (10): can you say...legendaric

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Gorgeous song although it’s a bit of drag if you aren’t in the right mood

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when he flies in the music video, it reminds me of that video of a lawnmower flying in the air.

**J\_Toe** (10): of course this song's gonna do well. Just gotta say, I found some fan remixes of this song with In My Blood (Shawn Mendes), with No tears left to cry (Ariana), and with In my Blood and No tears, and they were pretty cool :).

**lilacsweetener** (10): instant classic, the song pretty much every 1d fan knew harry would make one day

**pjatteryd** (10): My father likes this song

**rickikardashian** (10): If anyone here gives it a low score because it’s a slow song, I’m throwing hands. This song is song slaps and you can 100% pop your pussy to it I’ve done it

**Verdantshade** (10): this was such a fucking good lead single. it's not as replayable as the rest of the album but wow it's so good live

**Leixander** (9.2): we got to we got to get awaaaaaaay

**eklxtreme** (9): honestly timeless

**surelychoo** (9): I love this song and its grandiose feel, but I can't listen to it much anymore because listening to harry reach the high notes always hurts my throat

**yourhostandpatron** (9): Pardon me, but I remember this being such a fantastic moment for pop in 2017, for better or for worse. Harry had the solo career all of us were waiting for, and he didn’t disappoint: this was a nearly six-minute long rock and roll epic in the later years of this decaying decade that reached the Top 4 and didn’t actually flop too hard afterwards, and while some people criticized Harry for being derivative of older rock acts, you can’t deny that seeing such a thing happen this late in the history of the human race was a bit of a statement. I thought this tried to be a bit too much of a power ballad at first (and Harry’s explanation of the lyrics is still as pretentious as hell, if we’re being honest) but lately I’ve found it to be a very earnest and rewarding effort that’s actually incredible to listen to. You may or may not like this, but you can’t deny that it’s a damn good effort.

**ggodisawomann** (8): a good song but a lil boring at times. too long.

**martymcflurry** (8): "just stop your crying" don't fucking tell me what to, Harry Styles.

**tinaoe** (8): the live version is superior

**waluigiest** (8): his voice is wonderful and the writing doesn’t disappoint

**realboxwood** (7.7): I assume when this song came out, it was immediately retroactively added to every “Hits From the 70s” compilation CD that any white dad anywhere owns. The first four minutes soon become stagnant. The political commentary is as vague as Father John Misty’s Pure Comedy is specific. But when it breaks into that bridge and then outro, it quickly becomes transcendent.

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): I can say it's a good song and never want to listen to it again at the same time, right?

#Black Panther

**vhqv1997** (6): This song goes absolutely nowhere. The start and the bridge are individually very promising, but the rest of the song just feels very tacked on and dragged out. When the chorus is this stagnant, you have to find a way to edit it around better, because a 6-minute song should be absolutely gripping by switching up the details constantly, while the middle part of this is just filled with empty spaces that don't add anything.

**hikkaru** (4): honestly? i sleep. this is so long and slow

**poppinmmolly** (4): I'm so sorry. This is so boring, and the only reason it charted as high as it did was because of the artist attached to it and that is a hill I will die on. It would be better if it wasn't 5.5 minutes long too.

**roxieloxie** (3): this song peaks and then it just falls

**ElizabethDDoS** (1): Overdrawn and goes pretty much nowhere. I genuinely don't understand what people like SO MUCH about this song. (Note to future self: I hope you're not regretting giving this a 1. Note to past self: I hope you did the good thing by changing this from a 0 to a 1.)

**kappyko** (1): go listen to coldplay. his falsetto is annoying and there's just so little fucking HERE. are we expected to still accept a lesser version of oasis/beatles/coldplay balladry so long after their heyday? retro fetish hell. doesnt help that the two influences cited on genius are artists i have tried so hard to get into. i feel nothing listening to this, nothing but resignation and tiredness and like there's no reason for this to be 6 minutes. this is the song the guy from yesterday wouldve written. the piano at teh end is pretty

**selegend** (0): this shit boring sorry

#People Who Left A Comment

**1998tweety** (10): Please please please don't rob this just cause it's an Ed Sheeran song. This bops so hard and I don't see how some people see it as slut-shaming but w/e.

**ggodisawomann** (10): amazingggg

**ignitethephoenix** (10): One of Ed’s best

**ImADudeDuh** (10): king

**jackisboredtoday** (10): one of the two Ed Sheeran songs I unabashedly love... sorry Ellie

**rickikardashian** (10): the cabbage patch kid didn't have to go off like this, damn

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Legit one of the few Ed songs I genuinely enjoy

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (10): Augh this is so good it hurts

**Verdantshade** (10): this definitely makes ed come across as petty af but it's a great ed sheeran song - good rapping, a catchy guitar riff and one of his most memorable choruses. I learnt all the words to this the day he first performed it on SNL lol

**extrasmallbillie** (9): I know this sub hates him, but I've always loved Ed. This might be his best song. He really snapped here, huh?

**grandmafriend** (9): sorry Niall baby but this is a bop

**poppinmmolly** (9): my favorite single from him. Not song. Single.

**radiofan15** (9): Ellie Goulding deserves!

**realboxwood** (9): Oh look it’s one of the only Ed Sheeran songs I like

**surelychoo** (9): this is the Ed that I like! not the smarmy ones that always seem to become the major hits. I think it's hilarious how Niall entangled himself in this Ed and Ellie mess but still managed to come out unscathed lfjaslkdhgasl truly teflon

**tinaoe** (9): niall loves it so

**vhqv1997** (9): More of this please Ed, I'm begging you

**martymcflurry** (8.5): Can you blame a girl for choosing Niall over Ed? It’s like choosing filet mignon over a McDouble.

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8.5): There's only 2 Ed songs I actually like (Sing is the other), and this is one of them. It's very bitchy and petty, but it has a nice bounce to it and I love those background vocals.

**pjatteryd** (8): On my mind is really good, so I have to give this points

**selegend** (8): bop tbh

**eklxtreme** (7.5): sure it's more upbeat but it's more generic

**lilacsweetener** (7): good song but he denied it was ever about Ellie or Niall, and Ellie denied ever dating Ed....

**waluigiest** (7): …no-spice Niall took ur gorl?

**CarlieScion** (10): Even though this wasn’t my 11, I was rooting for it so hard! It’s such a bop and it just makes me want to dance. Zayn put up an honorable fight, especially considering that most people went into this rate disliking or not having listened to his album. Alas, we have to leave him here, at third place.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (9.3): i love the line ‘it’s cold-hearted’ and the, i don’t know, wild production?? on this song. remember when zayn posted a random pic of gigi and captioned it ‘saw your face and got inspired’ even though he made like i would before they met, cause that was wild.

---

**\_turbovicki\_** (11): This should have been his lead single, not Pillowtalk

**ggodisawomann** (11): I literally fucking love this song. I have never heard anything bless my ears unexpectedly like this song did.

**1998tweety** (10): I have no idea why this is on the deluxe version cause it's easily the best song on the album. The chorus on this is so so good and bops so so hard.

**followingfreeways** (10): a fucking BANGER!!!!!!!!!

**hikkaru** (10): BANGER

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Jesus christ this song deserved so much better. It's such a motherfucking bop.

**numberonejobrosstan** (10): this is 1 of 2 songs off this album that i still regularly listen to

**xmxlxo** (9.8): Superior to 1D's I Would

**martymcflurry** (9.5): Finally some good fucking food

**waluigiest** (9): once it gets going it is wet as fuck

**hhiggy** (8.9): basically remade i would by one direction

**NotWith10000Men** (8.5): super solid album closer. the only part of this album that I've liked is the beat in some of the songs and this is definitely one of them

**yourhostandpatron** (8.5): I was a bit mystified as to why this was included as a bonus track, seeing as I’ve never bothered to listen to it in full, but then I realized that it was the third single and that not making it take part in the rate would be a bit silly. And, speaking of which, I wouldn’t be surprised if it was a fan favourite, too; not only is this is an upbeat, pop adjacent song (which is sure to get the attention of everyone else rating this from that fact alone), but it’s actually done well, making it Take it Off’s slightly less sensual brother. A thumbs-up from me.

**radiofan15** (8.2): Imagine if the rest of the album was as energetic and livid as this song… but of course he had to ruin it by being sPeCiAl aNd UnIqUe AnD aRtIsTic.

**believedcrazy** (8): bop

**ignitethephoenix** (8): kinda bops

**surelychoo** (8): Would he treat you like I would, would he touch you, would he need you, would he love you like I would?

**eklxtreme** (7.5): didn't age too well

**The\_Amazing\_JAJ** (7.5): Well, it ended strongly I guess!

**realboxwood** (7): I can’t believe it took until the last Zayn song to get to an actual banger, good riddance

**roxieloxie** (7): this song is the second best bonus track

**vhqv1997** (7): I hate to say this but I can't believe Sam Smith did this concept better

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (6): a bit to fuck boy-y for my taste

**Leixander** (6): love the bassline but that's it

**pjatteryd** (6): This is a worse version of I Would

**Verdantshade** (6): why wasn't this on the standard edition of the album? it'd have been a nice break from the insomnia-curing mood that persists throughout mind of mine. I don't really like the song but it's undeniably a bop

**Overall Average**: 6.862 **// Average Controversy:** 1.906

**1998tweety** (8.346): I'm convinced y'all didn't actually listen to this album cause it's actually quite good. Prob just heard Pillowtalk and based the whole thing off of it.

**waluigiest** (7.846): kind of a Zayn stan and not ashamed of that

**selegend** (7.769): of course the person of color is the one with the best album ahh (icarus falls never happened)

**yourhostandpatron** (7.154): See, there are still a lot of things I don’t like about Zayn. I’m pretty sure that not even his most dedicated stans are fond of the UNNECESSARY CAPITALIZATION or the eDgY mYsPaCe tiTiLiNg, and the guy tends to make...questionable artistic decisions at times, on top of being unfortunately hindered by his anxiety. Despite all this, though, I can’t help but feel like we hate Mind of Mine way too much, because now that I’ve finally listened to it in full, I totally believe that it’s a pretty good debut effort. Yes, some of the songs flow a little too well into each other, but taking the time to listen to them independently made me realize that some of said songs were actually very good. Zayn has his flaws, but unlike certain other ex-members of One Direction, those flaws don’t always apply to all of his music, and much like how Harry’s love of rock shows on his own debut, Zayn clearly has a penchant for rhythm and blues that’s not gentrifyingly shallow. He needs to step up a bit, but I do enjoy his music, and I hope his flaws improve over time!

**Verdantshade** (6.846): it's 2019 and I'm still pissed off with zayn for being the biggest snake I had the misfortune to fall in love with and I still haven't listened to icarus falls because it's too long and most of the singles were mediocre. that being said, mind of mine showed he had the ability to create great music and it's a huge shame he will probably never fulfill his potential

**hikkaru** (6.615): Very much a mixed bag - some bops, some snoozers. This rate was my first time listening to Mind of Mine other than Pillowtalk and I'm glad that the rest of the album is mostly better than that

**ImADudeDuh** (6.385): I would like to imagine myself and zayn going to the zoo together and when we go to the bathroom by the bird section, he puts his hand on my ass, wanting to start some public sex. I do have to deny him and remind him that the paparazzi is outside waiting for us. He understands, but is noticably sad and disappointed that he was not able to impregnate me, a man.

**radiofan15** (5.977): TBH I didn't cared that much about 1D until Zayn left the band… all of that juicy meltdown was to sweet and fun to ignore; ergo, I was sort-of rooting for him as a solo artist… unfortunately, and despite some deserved highlights on his debut album mEmE oF mInE, the album is so unengagingly performed and blander than biting white bread soaked in toilet water, with the production being the obvious star here. [Score for the album: C-]

**GoWestYoungKanye** (10): IT’S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS (also, it’s a 10 because i can make a ‘i love my cohost, kiwina’ joke). kina and i would also like to say it was hilarious when this was winning with no 11s.

**CarlieScion** (7): Kiwi is our runner-up! If this had scored .6 more points, it would have been the first winner in all of popheads history to win without receiving a single 11. However, at the very last submission it lost out to the power of cute Irish boys and their guitars. This is a fun track, one of Harry’s favorites, and I get why. It’s explosive and silly, just like him. If this rate was done a couple months earlier I would’ve given this a 10, probably - but I’ve overplayed it to the point where it isn’t as fun to listen to anymore. Sorry, Harold, better luck next time.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Please do more rock bops Harry!

**ImADudeDuh** (10): when im from new zealand

**jackisboredtoday** (10): Harry made me start eating fruit again

**lilacsweetener** (10): where only angel wasn't entirely convincing this sure as hell is, and his electrifying performances solidify that he believes every last word of this song, even if it makes no damn sense

**pjatteryd** (10): My fave track this album

**radiofan15** (10): I don't care about the lack of connection between the title, the subject matter and the video, I only care about the song itself… and the song itself is giving me life and is everything! #StreamCautionByMariah

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (10): I love how raw and almost garage-rock this song is. I wouldn't have thought Harry could pull of this kind of track going in, but he definitely proved me wrong because it's amazing and I want more of them. God, that guitar solo and all the feedback in the final minute, PLEASE have my baby Mr. Styles ugh

**Verdantshade** (10): lmao this is everything I love about harry - quirky lyrics (the cactus and hard candy lines) and an even quirkier music video. nothing about this song makes sense but he played it twice when I saw him and that's what really matters

**waluigiest** (10): this sounds like the music that played in like Madden 06 for the GameCube and that was my last attempt at heterosexuality so this is a symbolic song

**realboxwood** (9.5): It’s camp

**rickikardashian** (9.5): Since this is most likely the only chance I'll get to talk about this, as the fandom decided that Kiwi is Medicine's less hot sister I'm here to say that Medicine deserved to be released and it's easily Harry's best song and had it been on this rate I would have done everything to get it to win. Thank you

**believedcrazy** (9): love it

**ggodisawomann** (9): this song is deeply entertaining, I really like how weird it is

**martymcflurry** (9): this song makes no fucking sense but it makes me HYPE

**NotWith10000Men** (9): harry has the best rocker voice by far of these dudes

**surelychoo** (9): this song is pure insanity and I love it

**xmxlxo** (9): This song feels so stupid I love it

**eklxtreme** (8.5): hard af

**numberonejobrosstan** (7.5): this goes hardt

**tinaoe** (7.5): slaps live tho

**hikkaru** (7): this is so dadrock it hurts [2] but it kinda bops a bit

**J\_Toe** (7): I like how this sounds more like Brit-pop than the rock-pop we see more of on r/popheads.

**Leixander** (7): aving yo baybe, is nanaya bizness

**yourhostandpatron** (6.5): As far as I can tell some people seem to love this down to their bones (also, the Lorde jokes are immense) but even if this can be pretty fun to bang your head to at times, I...don’t really get the hype for it, not gonna lie. The production issues with Harry’s music in general are striking in a song as loud as Kiwi, and Harry’s screams of ‘I’M HAVING YOUR BABY’ are too close to cheese instead of camp for me. Basically, what I’m trying to say here is that Kiwi is the glam rock without the gayness, and I ain’t happy for it!

#It's None Of Your Business (Kappy Won)

**kappyko** (3.5): harry does the fratellis greatest hits. the intellect line is bad

---

**Overall Average**: 7.656 **// Average Controversy:** 2.068

---

**Verdantshade** (10.100): harry is the only one of the ot5 I've seen live because I'm broke and I lived in the middle of nowhere when 1d were active :( I ended up seeing harry alone and sleeping in a bus station after the concert (it was his first solo london date) but it was still one of the best nights of my life. his debut is also my favourite of the solo albums, and harry really grew into his own on mitam with if I could fly, walking in the wind and olivia

**radiofan15** (9.100): Even before I started paying more attention to 1D (AKA after Zayn left and all the surrounding drama made me reevaluate them) I knew Harry would be the Justin Timberlake of the band… I mean, he had the charisma, the recognizable look, the Britney (AKA Taylor), the somewhat more recognizable vocals, etc. As a big shock to almost everyone, his solo debut was more of a 70s rock pastiche rather than the poppier stuff some of his fans might have expected, but hearing the results you can't deny Harry put all of his heart into this 10 songs and, even if they're a little bit derivative, they still work wonderfully together as a whole [Score for the album: A]

**waluigiest** (8.000): this album worked for me!

**yourhostandpatron** (7.700): Harry Styles is such an enigma to me. I really do get the hype for him, a cute and (arguably) openly bisexual former boy band member who advocates for fans in minorities and tries to keep a dying genre alive, and even if his music has some major flaws hidden and what he intends to do, I’m all for his place in modern pop music. The thing is, his stans tend to get a bit...annoying at times (and I’m sure all of his stans reading this comment are going to agree with me!) and as refreshing of a call back to older times as he is right now, he just doesn’t do anything quite as revolutionary as I would have expected. Harry plays things a little too safe, and his excuse of being in a pop group with manufactured roots from earlier before in his career no longer applies to his work as a solo act. I want to see Harry expound on his style (he, he, he) on the future, because as charming as I find him, that’s what he’ll have to do to keep my interest up. I eagerly welcome the lad to my good books, but Harry has to find out what exactly attracts so many people to his music, and he has to find a way to build up on that strength while actually surprising listeners outside his usual fanbase. If he doesn’t do that, I may still be entertained with him, but my disappointment will only grow.

**Leixander** (7.250): has the best work in this rate but the bar is already low

**ImADudeDuh** (7.200): I would like to imagine I walk to the mall in San Francisco, I am by myself and looking for some new clothes. I look at one store, and go in. I find an outfit I really like. It's fashionable as hell. I check the price tag, but it is way out of my budget. I start to walk dejectedly away from it, but I'm stopped by a man. It's Harry Styles. He tells me "I'd like to buy you that outfit." I ask him why. He replies to me saying "I'd love to imagine it on you, and then on my floor..." I gasp, and accept his offer. After i get the clothes I look at him and say "Thanks, but you're not my type." I walk out of the store and walk out of San Francisco, feeling like i just swindled Harry Styles. When I am out of earshot, Harry whispers to himself "Just as planned... Glad you're happy now."

**hikkaru** (4.000): I have such a visceral reaction to dadrock and dadrock impersonations that I just can't like anything from this album. The whole thing is so BORING and when it tries to be more upbeat and exciting it's just not the type of music I like listening to. I get that Harry is far more critically acclaimed and "artsy" than the other artists/albums in this rate and maybe I'm just a basic bitch but every other artist has songs that are far better than anything on this exhausting album. My average is the bare minimum without the ballot being rejected just because I really don't like it at all.

**GoWestYoungKanye** (11): choosing an eleven for this rate was hard, but not impossible, like i thought it might be in the beginning. in the end, i settled on ‘on the loose’ for a number of reasons, but the biggest one is my love of magical realism and folk songs (yes! i love traditional folk songs! i don’t care!). niall is, regardless of anything i’ve indicated before, my favourite member of 1d, and i adore him beyond words. and i adore his irishness. i’ve spent a lot of time thinking about the mechanics of 1d, and his irishness plays a huge part in the group dynamic (and my unrelenting love of him, his personality is the rest.... he is a hilarious enigma......). ‘on the loose’ sounds like a spin on a traditional irish folk song, especially the warning that feels like it has a bit of a laugh to it (like he’s singing it to the girl it’s about, and she knows what she’s doing). the magical realism comes from the witchiness of some of the lyrics (particularly ‘her eyes could burn down the room’.) it’s just a magical song, and says so much about how niall views women as the muse and i love the woman he created (or described) in this song so much. so it’s my eleven, undoubtedly. also the ending bit, where there’s those lone two strings before he starts singing again... sublime

**CarlieScion** (9): And we have our winner! Niall is our golden boy, but not by much - just .5 separates this track and Kiwi. This was the winner for much of the rate, but closer to the end it flipped around so much. Kiwi, LIKE I WOULD, Sign of the Times and Miss You were all winning at one point. This was #2 untill the very last ballot, when we gave u/kappyko a small extension of a few hours. His ballot ticked in and suddenly this was the winner again! It now goes down in Popheads history as the winner with the second lowest average of all time. If Kiwi had won, as it looked like it would by the end, it would have been the first winner to win without having a single 11. History made, either way.

---

#FOR IRELAND  

**ElectricBoogaloo41** (11): The pre-chorus of this song is my favorite part, and I like how well it leads into the chorus! His voice also really suits the song, especially during the end of each chorus.

**martymcflurry** (11): A STONE COLD BOP, FILE UNDER “DESERVED BETTER”

**Novuspyra** (11): It was either this or On My Own and this has a better chance at winning.

**1998tweety** (10): Wow what a massive bop. A great opener to the album, there are so many small touches I love on this track.

**eklxtreme** (10): niall is an ambitious icon for this one

**followingfreeways** (10): i will never forget when he first sang this live and all we had was the live version of it falksdjf and i was just walking around playing a crusty ass live version of this song, it was worth it tho because this song Grooves

**ggodisawomann** (10): AMAZING

**grandmafriend** (10): BOP

**ignitethephoenix** (10): Okay Niall is already serving smooth bops at the beginning of the album.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): a song that deserved so much better.

**lilacsweetener** (10): stone cold banger, the transition into the bridge is effortless too

**surelychoo** (10): Niall knew that What A Feeling was the best song in existence and continued in that vein. fuck me up niall

**Verdantshade** (10): this is such a bop

**believedcrazy** (9): look its a bop

**tinaoe** (9): bops

**yourhostandpatron** (9): On the Loose is the first instance of mixing folk and disco that I’ve ever seen in mainstream music, and as things stand, it’s also probably going to be the last one. Thankfully, it manages to justify this strange combination by being an absolutely fantastic soon; growing from his boy band days, Niall continues to swoon as he sets up the tone for Flicker’s narrative by blessing us with a song that’s excellent in all that it aims to do, injecting listeners with a sense of dread whilst enticing them to dance around a bit to the solid beat that On The Loose provides them with. A very good album opener, and a great sign of things to come in both theme and music.

**radiofan15** (8.5): Funky and slightly upbeat intro track with a slight country touch... It's unsubstantial but it really sets the mood I guess, and it's quite fun to listen to...

**jackisboredtoday** (8.2): The one really dynamic Niall track, it doesn't necessarily grab attention but it glides along so nicely & I'm surprised it got so little traction when they made it a single

**pjatteryd** (8): It’s so fun!!

**ThereIsNoSantaClaus** (8): This song has a really nice, catchy groove and melody to it. I went into this album expecting Sheerany folk pop, and this caught me off guard.

**Leixander** (7.5): bopper

**J\_Toe** (7): glad I did the rate to hear this. It doesn't mention sweat on laundry, and is pretty cool in a boy-pop kind of way.

**NotWith10000Men** (7): inoffensive dancy pop song. chorus is very fun

#Oof

**realboxwood** (6.5): This is mean but the first time I heard this song and got to the “I fell for it twice” line in the bridge I laughed out loud, sorry Niall that this unrealistically evil woman clowned you so hard

**waluigiest** (5): this is so generic it’s like a maroon 5 album cut

**Ayuna-Sayuri** (2): I don't really like anything about this

**Overall Average**: 7.359 **// Average Controversy:** 1.951

---

**yourhostandpatron** (8.269): I don’t know if Niall’s released the best solo output out of all his ex-bandmates, but between him, Zayn, and Harry, his album’s definitely surprised me the most. Folk is a genre that I adore the sound of, even if I’ve never gotten the chance to explore it in-depth like some sort of pretentious music nerve, and while it rarely has a place in modern-day pop music aside from the odd hit single that incorporates it with EDM, with Flicker, Niall keeps his chosen style of music alive in ways purists might either scoff at or guiltily admire, much like what Harry does with his own record. There’s also a tragically intimate storyline in this album full of love and regret that’s pleasingly convincing to me (u/Roxieloxie’s write-up on said themes made me appreciate them more, to be honest!) and all in all Flicker is currently the only ex-1D album I can see myself returning to very frequently. Until Louis releases, it’ll remain that way; despite that, however, I can’t wait to hear what Niall’s going to offer for us next. I’m rooting for him to stay true to his influences, but at the same time, songs like On The Loose make me eager to see how he expands them.

**rickikardashian** (7.977): Weirdly more than half of this album got itself in the 7-7.8 range, which is p nice if. This is a nice background album, in the sense that it's the type of album that doesn't need your whole attention or for you to analyze all the lyrics and production. You just put it on and slowly enjoy Niall and his folk ass songs

**Verdantshade** (7.769): flicker is a really good album but the white guy with a guitar is so oversaturated in the pop market that I rarely ever feel like listening to any of the songs on it. his recent stuff from smallfoot and his work with julia michaels has me scared he's moving further into bland folk pop music and considering he's written some pretty out of the box stuff like never enough, I hope he's able to grow further as an artist (this would apply to zayn and liam too but I've lost all hope for them at this point)

**radiofan15** (7.515): Similar to Harry's album, Niall's intention with his debut album seems to be trying several variations of the same subgenre and see what sticks... in his case said genre being folk pop, although some rock and country influences sometimes slips through the cracks. It's not as effective as Harry's, but at least he fares better than most of the other 1D kids by actually putting effort in his craft. [Score: B]

**ImADudeDuh** (7.462): I would like to imagine Niall and I are going to Starbucks, there are 2 other people in line. We wait patiently for our drink and sneak in a couple quick kisses while having some conversation in line. We get to the front of the line, and we notice our barista is gay as well. He notices we are gay, and seems noticably happier since he is serving 2 other gays who are able to freely display their love in a public setting, without fear of being judged or attacked. We get our drinks and sit in the cafe and make jokes to each other and keep laughing. It's a nice time. We are happy.

**letsallpoo** (7.231): Here she goes !

**hikkaru** (6.692): Like Harry, Niall definitely pivoted into a direction that isn't really for me and bores me more than anything. Still, there's a couple decent songs here that saves him from a lower score so that's good

**Leixander** (5.731): very same-y album that has a few standouts and a few horrifyingly bad songs, hint: he chose the singles well

**waluigiest** (5.385): convince me this album is good challenge 2019

And now for what we've all been waiting for, an update:

Zayn. Harry. Niall. Liam. Louis. Long ago, the five members of One Direction sang live together in musical harmony. Then, everything changed when Zayn left the band in a Facebook post. Only a renewed contract as a group or solo contracts could ensure their voices could continue blessing the world, but when the world needed their songs most, they vanished. A hundred years passed and ~~Liam still hasn’t released his debut album~~ u/CarlieScion and I discovered the new Solo King of 1D, an Irishman named Niall, and although his golf skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe... Niall can save the world.

deleted: * ...discovered the new Solo King of 1D, a Billboard Top Ten Hit haver named Liam, and although his not releasing an album skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe... Liam can save the world.

* ...discovered the new Solo King of 1D, a fucking liar named Zayn, and although his being bored skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe... Zayn can save the world.

* ...discovered the new Solo King of 1D, a glamorous Gucci model named Harry, and although his goat holding skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe... Harry can save the world.

* ...discovered the new Solo King of 1D, an old man named Louis, and although his having a name with French pronunciation skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he's ready to save anyone. But I believe... Louis can save the world.
