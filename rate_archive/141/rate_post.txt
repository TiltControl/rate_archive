[hello everyone](https://www.tiktok.com/@lilnasx/video/7037989816516070703)

Welcome to the 2021 Ultimate Rate: Billie Eilish vs. Doja Cat vs. Lil Nas X vs. Olivia Rodrigo! Us three hosts, /u/frogaranaman /u/RandomHypnotica and /u/runaway3212, are ridiculously excited to be hosting such an anticipated rate of the annual smackdown that pits some of the biggest albums of the previous year against each other.

The last year for pop music was one that could simply be described as: unexpected. We saw the return of sales giants [only for the sub](https://redd.it/qy4o1s) [to call them a flop](https://redd.it/qlhbbs), we saw Dua Lipa top the year-end with a #2 hit [featuring someone who unfortunately knows what a top is](https://pitchfork.com/news/dababy-apologized-for-homophobic-remarks-during-meeting-with-hiv-organizations-attendees-say/), we saw Elton John come back strong with [his first top ten hit in a quarter century](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DtVBCG6ThDk), we saw [a ten-minute song about a decade-old relationship top the charts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8R_3mXZBsuU), and we saw the return of many beloved artists, too many to list. But who could have expected that some of the largest acts for pop music would be [a coochie destroyer](https://www.papermag.com/billie-eilish-tiktok-username-change-2648943811.html), [a chatroom star](https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-52805974), [a](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FAqJwi-XoAE0QvJ.jpg) [fucking](https://twitter.com/lilnasx/status/1444118046881107974) [homosexual](https://twitter.com/LilNasX/status/1375857638869585922), and [a Disney heartbreak queen](https://genius.com/Joshua-bassett-crisis-lyrics)?

So join us as we see who's the best of the best in this eclectic bunch and decide which of the newest generation of superstars is truly delivering the best work.

_Note: When the rate was announced, /u/Tr1skad3kaphobia was also planned to be hosting with us but unfortunately due to personal reasons they will not be on board. However, they still contributed to so much in this rate set up so it would be remiss not to mention them in this intro. We miss them but are happy they're putting themselves first!_

#Billie Eilish – _Happier Than Ever_

Billie Eilish first rose to fame when she released her debut single "Ocean Eyes" in 2014. The song became an overnight hit and launched the singer into the spotlight. Over the next few years the singer started working on her music. She released droplets here and there over those years, but it wasn't until 2017 that she released her debut EP _dont smile at me_. The project was praised by critics and fans alike and Billie gained many more fans because of it. Billie then went on tour and started working on her debut album. The album took 2 years to complete, but then in 2019, after many teases and singles, she finally released her highly anticipated debut project _WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO_. The album received critical acclaim and high praise by many people and also spawned the smash hit "bad guy." The track wasn't like anything that was on the radio at the time and people were drawn to its uniqueness and were obsessed. Billie even managed to knock "Old Town Road," a song by Lil Nas X who is a competitor in this rate, off of it's record breaking streak of the most week at number one, which is an impressive feat since not even the beloved Taylor Swift could achieve that accomplishment.

After this enormous success, it seemed like there was nobody for Billie to go but up. Throughout 2020 and 2021, she released various droplets, which at the time seemed more like non-album singles (and they were sort of intended to be that too). But after the announcement of her new blonde hair, we also got the announcement of her sophomore album, _Happier Than Ever_. [The album cover](https://imgur.com/dI7Ln92) is absolutely stunning, picturing Billie comforting herself with a single tear almost dried up in her eyes. It's in pretty stark contrast to the album cover of _WHEN WE ALL FALL ASLEEP, WHERE DO WE GO_, which is almost horror-like. Like the album covers, the sound of _Happier Than Ever_ is less horror and more tranquil. However looks (or sounds) can be deceiving, because on _Happier Than Ever_ the horror doesn't come from sounds, it comes from others. Much of the album is about the abuse Billie has suffered from a previous relationship. The album also discusses the horrors of fame (a stalker down the street) and the horrors of just existing (watching porn to distract yourself).

While it might be a bit less accessible than her debut, _Happier Than Ever_ is an incredibly worthwhile pop album that explores both interesting sounds and interesting lyrics as Billie was not afraid to leave her comfort zone in certain places. I couldn't be more excited about rating and discussing this album with everyone.

#Doja Cat – _Planet Her_

Amala Dlamini, otherwise known by her stage name Doja Cat, first drew attention from the internet when her critically acclaimed, highly praised, some may even say the best song of all time "Moo" went viral. People didn't appreciate the masterpiece that is "Moo" and even called Doja a meme, but that didn't stop the rapper. Doja took the meme status that she was given and used it to her advantage. Her profile continued to build (most notably on Tiktok) and this quickly turned into a successful career with album-cut-turned-Tiktok-hit-turned-chart-topper "Say So," leading to her next album being one to watch out for.

We knew this album was coming once lead single "Kiss Me More (feat. SZA)" dropped and was met with instant success. It got the streams, radio play, meme treatment, rave reviews and everything else needed for the song to be a bonafide long-term smash. After months of waiting post-lead single, Doja Cat's _Planet Her_ got released to the world. While met with mixed reviews from critics, fans loved the album and Doja's star profile only kept rising. Album opener "Woman" and oddball anthem "Get Into It (Yuh)" got the Tiktok-hit treatment, collaborations "I Don't Do Drugs" and "You Right" became fan-favorites, and the long-awaited "Ain't Shit" got met with critical and fan praise. Doja Cat found herself with a smash album on her hands, and while some of the album may not be liked by the sub, its iconic moments are too good to pass up and are easily some of the best pop songs released in 2021.

#Lil Nas X – _MONTERO_

Lil Nas X seemed to come out of nowhere. In fact, he did. In 2019, the singer blew up with the country rap track "Old Town Road '', being the original TikTok hit. The song was inescapable. It was everywhere. People couldn't stop listening to the song. The track slowly started to rise on the charts until it eventually hit number one. And it stayed number one for so long that it managed to break the record of most week at number one, with 17 weeks, until it was taken down by felow rate competitor Billie Eilish with the track "bad guy." However as many of you'll know, one mega successful song does not a successful artist make. Although some other singles did decently well on the charts. Lil Nas X's real breakthrough to a multiple mega hit artist was "Call Me By Your Name."

The wait for "CMBYN" was incredibly long. LNX kept teasing the chorus on Tiktok but not releasing the actual song, and at some point people started wondering if the song could ever meet the hype. Then the video dropped. This video is without a doubt the gayest thing ever, it's so unapologetically gay which caused a lot of noise on the internet and this together with the hype made the song an instant hit. Of course, there was also controversy from conservatives, but like with "WAP," this controversy only seemed to make the song more popular.

Now remember two seconds ago when I said "CMBYN" had the gayest video ever? Well, I lied; it's actually "INDUSTRY BABY," the third single from this album. There aren't words that can describe how gay this song is, but more importantly it's also really good. The one-two punch of "CMBYN" and "INDUSTRY BABY" (as well as "SUN GOES DOWN," which is also great but wasn't as commercially successful) made LNX from a meme hit wonder into one of the most established artists from gen Z.

_MONTERO_ explores themes of homesexuality and not being able to be yourself, but it does so in a very upbeat tone, as LNX looks back on these situations from the perspective of a out and proud gay who has gotten way bigger than the homophobes who helt him down. That makes it a very interesting listening experience. Sonically, it's a combination of R&B and pop sounds and _MONTERO_ shows LNX is great at both singing and rapping. It's fun, it's bouncy and it is more than deserved that it's in this year's ultimate.

#Olivia Rodrigo – _SOUR_

Who would've thought that a former Disney girl would be, arguably, the biggest singer in the world in 2021? Olivia Rodrigo has been in the industry as an actress for years, but her true passion has always been music. Olivia first got noticed when she starred in the Disney Channel show _Bizarrdvark_, playing the role of Paige. After a four year run, the show ended, but soon after Olivia was cast in the Disney+ series _High School Musical: The Musical: The Series_. Olivia started to gain more and more attention from the show. She also wrote two songs for the series, "Out Of The Old" and "All I Want." The latter of the two managed to earn her a place on the Billboard U.S. Hot 100 even if it just barely cracked into the bottom ten.

Olivia's official debut single and her breakthrough into mega stardom was "drivers license." The song (a breakup ballad) was an instant hit, it got a [SNL sketch dedicated to it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPjvCFa8LuE) and it wasn't long before everybody knew about it. With the song came an extra dose of drama, since it was about her ex-relationship with _HSM:TM:TS_ co-star Joshua Bassett. Sides were and are picked and her success would grow with every drama video made about. Her singles afterward would continue to talk about her ex-relationships and more importantly continue to smash. The third single, "good 4 u," would become an even bigger hit than "drivers license" and the most successful song on the /r/popheads year-end chart. This unexpected mega stardom made the demand for an album grow and grow. The label decided (thank god) to scrap the originally planned EP and turn it into a full album.

_SOUR_, as the debut album would be called (a name which subtly includes her own name O R), was everything a new artist could hope for. It was critically liked (though not loved) and commercially successful. It instantly cemented Olivia as a household name and a name to watch. The album includes songs about her relationships, but it also focuses on the lesser parts of growing up while being famous. In "brutal," Olivia sings "who am I if not exploited?" a reflection on her life that goes deeper than the usual pop debut album. The biggest (and according to /r/popheads, second best) pop album of this year, it's a victory but also only just the start.

#Rules

shut up we all know these are copy / pasted from whatever rate we last hosted okay

- Listen to every song listed and give it a score between one (1) and ten (10). Decimal points are allowed, but only to one place (ex. 7.1 is acceptable, but not 7.15). We do not give a shit what you give the songs as long as it is between those two numbers.
- You have to rate every single song in the main rate. If you skip any and do not give us a score when I ask you for one, your ballot will not be counted. This is because the program used to determine the results will break if scores are not successfully put in and we will cry if the program breaks because it will be a pain in the ass to do this manually.
- You may give **one song a zero (0)** and **one song an eleven (11)**. These should be reserved for your favourite track and least favourite track. **If you do use either your zero (0) or your eleven (11), it is strongly encouraged to leave a comment on the track.** It can be as short or as long as you want, but please leave one; it will help the sub understand if you should be canceled or not when the rate is being revealed.
  - This 0 and 11 cannot be used on the bonus rate. Those scores should only be on a 1-10 scale.
- Please use the prepared link to submit your scores! That is the only form of ballot we will accept. We spent a lot of time and effort on it, so please use it.
  - Note: if you're trying to access on a mobile device or on the new reddit layout, it may not work; we have made it so the link will take you to old.reddit.com, so you should use a computer to send in your scores (if possible)!
- If you desire to change any of the scores after you have already submitted them, simply message this account and we will be glad to help! There are three of us checking this account so it will get accounted for and updated eventually.
- If we believe your scores include any form of sabotage, we reserve the right to ask you to change them or your ballot will be denied. Sabotage will be defined as extremely low overall average(s) that show a clear bias against the rate as a whole. If you truly hate the songs given low scores, we strongly encourage you to write comments on them. This indicates to us that you are not trying to rig the results, meaning everything will go smoothly. :)
- Your scores should not be considered confidential! Don't be scared to share them. Go nuts. Campaign for whatever song you gave an eleven to. Or not. It really is not that deep.

###Commenting Guideline

It is also highly encouraged that you add a comment to your song ratings! Do this by adding a space after the score and then typing to your heart's desire, like this:

> Happier Than Ever: 10 good 4 u but could literally never be me bestie

Any format other than this is NOT good and you will deeply hurt me if you do not follow the example given here. This includes:

> Kiss Me More: 10: what the fuck are they saying

> DOLLA SIGN SLIME: I bet Megan's porn category is an 11.

> good 4 u: I will give this song a 4 because of the song title. Haha. Comedy gold.

> INDUSTRY BABY=10 /u/Roxieloxie fuck you enjoy Jack Harlow
