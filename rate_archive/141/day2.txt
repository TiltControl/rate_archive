A-Devoted-Enthusiast: Man…could the balladophobia be that strong to eliminate the song that catapulted Olivia’s career? It really is brutal out here.

Worried about Billie Eilish and Lil Nas X’s ballads today. I better not see “Your Power” or “SUN GOES DOWN” getting eliminated anytime soon.

A-Devoted-Enthusiast: I hope not. For me, it’s the best uptempo on the album alongside “deja vu” (I also love “brutal” and “good 4 u”, don’t get me wrong). It’s also the rock subgenre I’d be most intrigued to see Olivia exploring further, especially after the overexposure of the 2000s pop rock/emo/Travis Barker throwbacks.

And here, finally at day 2, we have our first Lil Nas X song! Two gay legends collaborate to make something that can only be classified as a song. Elton John's comeback to popular music is still confusing to me, but I definitely think this can be classified as one of the better songs of his recent output. It is at the very least functional and Elton's piano adds. As to why this is lowest of all the Lil Nas X tracks, it's probably people finding it a bit boring and simplistic, which is hard to argue with, but I still think it's overall a super pretty song that deserves day 2, even if it's as the first song.

#oldheads

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): Why does this song make me feel like I’m slowly floating up?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Only just occurred to me while doing this rate that the Elton feature is him playing the piano and not some super quiet backing vocals.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): honestly, i don’t know why i like this song so much, It seems so obvious that the “i like this, i dont like that” line was meant to be a tiktok meme that it makes me cringe but idk i just like the rest of this song

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): head bopper

**xavieryes** (10): took a while to grow on me (especially since "I like this, I don't like that, do this here, don't you do that" is weirdly simplistic), but after it grew on me I began to love it just like everything else on the album. Elton John's piano is also excellent.

**FroyoFox\_125** (9.5): This song is nearing excellence for me personally babes

**emmaelf** (9): what an iconic lgbt pairing. incredible.

**jsonphile** (9): Two gay icons on one track

**ManofOranges** (9): Actually kind of beautiful

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (9): i can't believe a lnx song got me all introspective, but here we are

**PrimaryCrusaders** (8.8): I cannot hear much Elton influence in this song tbh

**DirtyRat583** (8.6): i dont get the hate for this song, the beat is so impactful i love it

**ebooks #5454** (8.5): does anyone know the fucking uber eats ad with LNX and Elton John? its sooo rudee LMFAOO

**imbaby122** (8.5): lil nas flop! elton old! just kidding lil nas x i appreciate the artistic direction you have taken on this album. just kidding elton you’re old but i respect your effort to keep up with this generation’s talent 🥳

**RandomHypnotica** (8.5): the taylorprint of not giving the feature vocals

**akanewasright** (8): this is a surefire early elimination for the album, but let’s not pretend this wouldn’t be fun to scream along to at a Lil Nas X show

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): Elton John's piano made it sound better and without it, it would be generic

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I like this

**DefaultPophead** (8): I didn't even remember this song when I listened to the album for the first time, but it's a cute bop!

**fairytalehigh** (8): hearing LNX call out his detractors is so gratifying

**vayyiqra** (8): Lil Nas X isn't a meme, he is a meme master

**welcome2thejam** (8): Love that piano line, if that's Elton's only contribution, then it's a super successful one

**1998tweety** (7.5): I was scared waiting for Elton to come in with his....not so great vocals, but then he just played the piano I think and it was fine.

**BasedButta** (7.5): i like this. definition of an okay song

**pig-serpent** (7.5): Okay song and the piano on it is great, but that chord progession hurts my soul.

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Elton really out here

**AzettImpa** (7): why did elton john not sing!!

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (7): I like this (pretty piano and the verse) I don’t like that (the hook)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): it’s nice but a bit of a filler

**jasannn** (7): oh, this is like a taylor female feature

**jman457** (7): not me being cockteased for a tiny dancer moment

**nooodisaster** (7): I fuck with it but highkey it's serving petty.

**runaway3212** (7): a tad boring but still fine

**shipperondeck** (7): the feat. is huge bait lmao. part of me wishes elton sang but also lnx carries this really well on his own and you can't deny how beautiful elton's piano sounds here.

**static\_int\_husp** (7): truly the most "feature by technicality" songs on the album

**wasian-invasion** (7): I like the message but the chorus makes me crack up

**modulum83** (6.5): lil nas x is really giving taylor swift a run for her money in songs about the Haters™

**babadork** (6.2): I want this song to have more Elton John. The piano in the background is lovely, but it is not enough. Give the man a verse or something.

**thedoctordances1940** (6.1): this exists ig

**bigbigbee** (6): It’s not common for me to like the verses of a song WAY more than the chorus, but this song achieves that. The verses are interesting and catchy; the chorus is oversimple and the melody isn’t enjoyable for me

**CrimsonROSET** (6): ft. elton john (ALLEGEDLY)

**jackisboredtoday** (6): i understand how it happened but this song being on Elton’s album from last year too is so funny with how nothing in this song applies to anyone who isn’t Lil Nas X

**just\_thonking** (6): Not a huge fan of the melody of this one

**Lach#6922** (6): SEHYUWUHNAMEESEHYUWUHNAMEEYEHYEH

**Lipe18090** (6): meh

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (6): I was promised Elton John. Where ELTON JOHN?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is the only song on the album that never really grew on me that much. for a song featuring elton john, i was expecting something much more grand and exciting. instead its mostly just…there

**TiltControls** (6): It's alright, but can feel a little boring despite being such a short song. Elton did great on piano though

**Uberpigeon** (6): this reminds me of a childrens song for some reason

**waluigiest** (6): imagine the power if Elton John was singing on this song

#babyheads

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): scoring this lower bc elton john is on it even tho he isn't on it (dont think abt it too much)

**Alumineous** (5): I know Elton’s on piano, but obligatory “this is like a female feature on a Taylor Swift song!”

**frogaranaman** (5): not Elton getting delegated to just playing the piano

**MrMoodle** (5): Calling it a “feature” when he just plays the piano is fake lol what are you gonna do feature everyone involved in the instrumental for every track?? That being said this track would be even cornier if Elton John was singing on it so I guess that’s a good thing

**fadedblue09** (4): What's with this sudden trend of pop stars collaborating with Elton John.

**MassiveThief** (4): such an annoying chorus

**shhhneak** (4): Elton so autotuned he sounds indistinguishable from Lil Nas.

**UselessTacooo** (4): I enjoy the production but the lyrics are so basic that I just get tired.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Ever since someone here said the “I don’t like this, I don’t like that” was Tiktok bait I can’t take this song seriously. Also “Ain’t the next big thing, you the next thing to go” is so cringe, like he really thought he dropped a truth bomb with that line…

**you2009** (4): two gay people on one song and it somehow doesn't hit how devastating. also too long for my tastes

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): also bland???

**IIIHenryIII** (2): what's up with this Elton John epidemic

My favourite taste of ice cream is definitely strawberry, what about y'all?

Continuing the Lil Nas X streak (and the Doja streak!) we have another non-single from _MONTERO_. It's cute but for a collab between two of the freshest pop stars we have right now, it feels a bit unexciting. That's not to say it's not good, especially Doja's verse is great (and better than all her verses that went out day 1). What's more is that the lyrical content isn't that new for both of them. Overall, maybe a bit robbed, but this placement fits the song well.

---

#is the daily scoop

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (11): their text to me - "just cuz it's Doja and Nas in a song"

**AHSWeeknd** (10): they gotta collab more

**akanewasright** (10): Okay but imagine the marching band kids playing this at football games… they’d be delightfully insufferable

**cremeebrulee** (10): CAN'T CALL ME STUPID WITH THIS BIG OL FUCKING FOREHEAD MOTHERFUCKER!!!!!

**dropthehammer11** (10): absolutely fucking love this song it hits every note i need it to

**racloves** (10): if you can listen to this song and not groove along you are stronger than me

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is unironically better than 90% of the doja songs in this rate

**runaway3212** (10): this being the best doja song is this rate idc

**DirtyRat583** (9.7): anything doja touches that was not also touched by a straight man turns to gold. the homosexual midas touch

**you2009** (9.7): ...^_^

**Alumineous** (9): Your local fuckboy’s Grindr profile.

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this song truly could have been fleshed out more but idc it slaps and doja ate

**ktajlili** (9): This song is really fun! I hope Doja Cat and Lil Nas X collab together again.

**MrMoodle** (9): “can’t call me stupid with this big ol’ fuckin’ forehead motherfucker” best lyric in the entire rate hands down lmao

**TragicKingdom1** (9): don't get the hate for this tbh it bops! also its the best doja song here

**seanderlust** (8.7): the pilates line and the forehead line are two of my favorite lyrics on this album. this track feels like LNX and doja having fun

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): poopty scoop

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Catchy af and the pick of a simple string arrangement, featuring the pop artist most in sync with Nas' brand and iconic lines from both of them: a smash in short

**FroyoFox\_125** (8.5): Doja can never go wrong with her features

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.5): fun track with a good Doja feature

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8.5): this is most likely going to go out on day 1 which is really quite a shame considering this is better than literally any song on planet her

**Awkward\_King** (8): doja's verse here being better than 90% of her album id be embarassed id be ashamed id quit

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the original contents of this comment are locked behind my patreon

**frogaranaman** (8): doing it in a Bentley would be uncomfortable

**ImADudeDuh** (8): me when i work at baskin robins

**nootnoot781** (8): working on your body? is it for me 😍

**ormysonormysonormys** (8): I love Pilates

**vayyiqra** (8): hey it's Doja Cat from the album Planet Her who Lil Nas X cites as an influence cool

**wasian-invasion** (8): did boys in your high school also love scooping each other's nipples or was that just mine

**jasannn** (7.8): This feels like peloton music in a good way.

**jman457** (7.6): the interlude with this song is nice

**1998tweety** (7.5): a bit underwhelming for a lnx doja collab but its still boppy

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): poopy-di scoop scoop-diddy-whoop whoop-di-scoop-di-poop poop-di-scoopty scoopty-whoop whoopity-scoop whoop-poop poop-diddy whoop-scoop poop poop scoop-diddy-whoop whoop-diddy-scoop whoop-diddy-scoop poop

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (7.5): Doja carries

**ebooks #5454** (7.5): y'know, pilates is really fucking difficult to do

**imbaby122** (7.5): i still dont know what pilates is and at this point i’m too scared to ask… scoop!

**jsonphile** (7.5): these two are two of the best new artists of the 2020s, so a collab from them should be fantastic, but this just isn’t that interesting. But the two are charismatic enough to carry even an underwhelming song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): one of the weaker tracks but Doja Cat made it better

**AzettImpa** (7): doja's verse!!!!!! chorus could've been better tho

**getin2it** (7): , The Doja verse is *chef's kiss*

**jaztinax** (7): a little generic but super catchy

**Lipe18090** (7): could be waaaay better

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): fun but I feel like doja doesn't really fit on this

**modulum83** (7): college girls REALLY love this one

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Doja saves this one methinks

**welcome2thejam** (7): Oh shit, 2021 Ultimate crossover episode

**shipperondeck** (6.8): it sounds perfect for a collab between these two but i don't think he and doja mesh as well as i thought they would for some reason?? it's still good. bridge is my fav part for sure

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): a fun beat but the hooks here are nowhere near as indelible as the singles

**celladonn** (6.5): This is fun but also the chorus is a little grating

**iniekcja\_** (6.5): I distinctly remember expecting this to be better

**nooodisaster** (6.5): Doja saves the song for 30 seconds, and the pilates line is funny.

#has ever been scooped. possibly anti scooping as a whole

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (6): I’m actually not a big fan of the chorus here, but other than that, the song’s fine.

**DefaultPophead** (6): The thought of people having sex to this makes me want to join a coven of nuns who punish horny people.

**Iris3271** (6): Got annoying

**Lach#6922** (6): listening to this just makes me wanna listen to Spoil My Night by Post Malone but the Doja verse is quite good so I'll give it an ok rating

**pig-serpent** (6): Why is this Doja's best verse in this rate?

**plastichaxan** (6): how did a collab with these two end up so mid

**Uberpigeon** (6): what are pilates i thought it was when u get those little food or am i thinking of tapas

**babadork** (5.9): I was originally going to say that there were only two good lines in this song, but I keep thinking about it and I don’t know that I believe that “dick” is now slang for “gun.”

**IIIHenryIII** (5): sounds like a Migos reject

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (5): it's a fun revenge glow up song

**TiltControls** (5): I wished I liked this more than I do. It should work for me but I feel nothing listening to this track

**waluigiest** (5): this song takes up no space in my brain when I’m not actively listening

**flavasavavandal** (4.5): this rate is making me wonder if Doja Cat have chemistry with a single man?

**musical\_pyn** (4): points for the forehead line, minus for pretty much the rest of the song

**static\_int\_husp** (4): even on the album that's not hers in this rate, Doja dissapoints

**thedoctordances1940** (3.2): yeah this is just genuinely pretty bad, the hook is so fucking annoying, doja adds almost nothing and the beat is boring af and the more I listen to it the worse it gets

**bookthieving** (3): really channeling the doja energy with the fun verses and awful hook

**N454545** (3): sorry but this missed

**UselessTacooo** (2.5): It actually has potential but Scoo Scoo Skurr makes me want to cry. I actually had this as my 0, but I heard Doja’s “let him apologize and eat it in a bentley” and immediately gave it more points.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): Not Doja’s low scores extending outside of her own album.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): so bland and WOW IT JUST KEEPS DRAGGING ON

**rtm416** (1): The chorus really kills this song for me, I'm sorry! I've tried, but I skip it every time if I'm not trying to listen to it.

**2dina3dworld** (0): that hook,,,, nooooo. That Doja feature,,, worse than almost anything on Planet Her.

**BasedButta** (0): oh shit thats doja cat. maybe the underwhelming feats curse is on her after all, not on her guests. anyway sorry this is real bad

**fadedblue09** (0): sorry this is awful

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (0): The song is actually a six, but that god-awful Pilates line is never going to be forgiven by me. It nearly tanks my enthusiasm for the album every time.

A-Devoted-Enthusiast: Random thought: I really hope “Kiss Me More” doesn’t end up as the highest rated song from Doja. Especially when “Need To Know”, “Woman”, and “Ain’t Shit” are right there as much more unique and overall better songs.

While I do like the tune, it’s kind of bland and safe to her standards, and it’s a pet peeve of mine that SZA’s verse kind of contradicts the rest of the song in tone.

Wow, we're really catching Lil Nas X up with the other artists, huh? This was one of the songs I really would not have minded if it was day 1. Reflections on fame can be good but most of the time they feel somewhat self congratulatory without being actually all that reflective. Add to that the horrible "Lil Nas X" moment copied straight from '7 Years' and you get a song that's not exciting and a bit hard to listen to. It's not all bad though, the second verse is pretty cute so at least there's that. 

---

#actually I do want it!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Beat went off

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): The hardest song on the album.

**seanderlust** (10): this song plays at the end of this meme https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/facebook/001/265/953/9bb.jpg

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): i feel like this is gonna be a day 1 exit and thats BULLSHIT because it FUCKING BANGS !!!!

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): god this one bangs so fucking HARDDDDD. this being barely over 2 minutes is fucking criminal

**UselessTacooo** (9.5): I recently learned people don’t like this and to those people I say: why?

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9): The distorted part is such a vibe it once distracted me into losing a Hades run 30 minutes in.

**emmaelf** (9): the voiceovers going over the quick change in his live over the last couple years was really effective with the tone of the song. i don't know i'd seek it out but in the context of the album, it works really well.

**akanewasright** (8.9): “I smoked myself to sleep, I'm sad, I think I'm feelin' lonely” HELL YEAH, ME TOO!!! TWERK ANTHEM!!!!

**jsonphile** (8.5): wait, just 8 songs ago you said “that’s what I want.” Now you “don’t want it”?? Make up your mind Lil Nas X

**plastichaxan** (8.5): should’ve kinda been a single wow what a moment

**shipperondeck** (8.1): i forgot about this song omg!! too short but i love the anthemic feel. this track fuses the banger qualities of the first half with the emotiveness of the second. also the timing of the spoken words during the interlude is very satisfying lol

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Banger chorus.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i always fuck with songs about fame

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): this is v good - love the production

**fairytalehigh** (7.6): the second half of this album is so introspective/downcast and i think this one kinda gets lost in the mix.

**just\_thonking** (7.5): Well I do

**modulum83** (7.5): if only there wasn't that corny fuckin voice clip in the middle this could have been way higher cause the beat goes off

**nooodisaster** (7.5): This beat deserved more than 2 minutes.

**you2009** (7.5): hook started grating on me after a few listens but still one of the better songs on the album

**jackisboredtoday** (7.2): we do love a good interpolation

**MrMoodle** (7): “tell the devil i can’t have him inside” i mean we’ve got video footage showing the opposite 😳

**TiltControls** (7): not always the biggest fan of 'speaking sections' cause they usually break up the flow of the song but this one does it well

**vayyiqra** (7): The more this album goes on I swear the darker it gets lyrically and I never noticed it before.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.8): [y'all want her?](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/396894234164199428/729158334732697680/unknown.png)

**thedoctordances1940** (6.8): kinda good kinda bad idk

#actually yeah maybe I don't want it

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): meh

**DefaultPophead** (6): I am a firm believer that even if you try your best, you probably won't get what you want!

**frogaranaman** (6): why'd he gotta flex so hard in the middle of that

**imbaby122** (6): any song with crowd cheering gets -2 points from me i cant stand it (concrete, who’s gonna save you now?, etc etc)

**waluigiest** (6): it feels unfinished at parts

**wasian-invasion** (6): eww newscasters the only msm I listen to is men who have sex with men

**jasannn** (5.5): I don’t need this

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): Was that a clip of Megan announcing him winning an award? And now she’s on his album?

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): I wasn’t really vibing with it but the shortness of it makes it worse

**jman457** (4.8): A bit cliche, which sucks for Lil Nas X

**IIIHenryIII** (4.5): me neither

**1998tweety** (4): meh, add the clips of his charting and I take another point off

**Awkward\_King** (3): i find interpolation of award show/ceremonies so cringy and this is like the epitome of that uiejdsakd

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (3): The only song from this album that I don’t really like. There’s just too much happening for my delicate little eardrums to process.

**pig-serpent** (3): A forgettable song with a boring chord progression and an interlude about how famous he is.  Hard to justify liking this.

**runaway3212** (3): I wish I liked this song but I find it dreadfully boring

**shhhneak** (2): Kinda corny.

Abel had so many collaborations in 2021 and some of them were good! The Weeknd making Swedish House Mafia relevant again was my personal highlight of 2021. This collab seemed like a no brainer. Both artists made music that was at first more R&B focused with pop influences here and there, but have now switched to pop with sometimes a bit of R&B touch. No brainer or not though, this song is really boring. Nothing that works about these two artists' styles comes together on this song. It's beyond bland. This got to day 2 on name recognition alone, and if this was a collab with somebody less popular this would've been bottom 10.

---

#can't help it, the song bops

**FroyoFox\_125** (11): This song will always sound amazing to me. Their vocal chemistry is just...perfection. The way Doja's soft tone compliments the beat, and Abel just nails his verse with his dom daddy energy is cause for stannage

**AHSWeeknd** (10): dr vomit needs to leave but Doja and Abel went off

**iniekcja\_** (10): omg she's such a libra

**Iris3271** (10): The chorus has now been stuck in my head for days

**UselessTacooo** (10): ITS JUST NERVES ITS JUST DICK YASSSSSSS

**vayyiqra** (10): I love the instrumental of this and the sound of the synths and then on top of that, The Weeknd's voice is just perfect, so I have to love this.

**you2009** (9.9): the weeknd coming in on this made me sex negative and I will be docking a decimal for it

**modulum83** (9.7): actually unreal how ethereal and beautiful this is

**emayzee** (9.3): not as good as in your eyes remix but regardless these two are a great musical match

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): but because the extended version exists at all

**jaztinax** (9): that raspy voiceeeeee how does she DO IT

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): they're both just so 🥺🥺

**nooodisaster** (9): My guilty pleasure, the song hits hard.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.6): an instrumental as luxurious as this deserves better lyrics than "it's just nerves, it's just dick"

**1998tweety** (8.5): another song that grew on me and now bops

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): for a Weeknd + Doja collab I was so excited for when it was announced, and then when I heard it, i was underwhelmed. Like the both sound good but there’s something missing from it and also it just had to be produced by Dr L*ke . It’s still nice thought but it could have been so much more

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): pretty solid

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.5): i understand why this was a single but ngl there was better choices. amazing video tho

**shipperondeck** (8.1): highlight of the back half. this song reallyyyy grew on me, maybe bc i became a big fan of abel only in the past half year or so. his feature's nice. overall the song hits the spacey dreamy vibe nicely

**fairytalehigh** (8): i like this song but i feel like i hear it ALL the time

**ManofOranges** (8): A little underwhelming to me but good nonetheless

**pig-serpent** (8): Beat is weak but this song has hooks for days. Even with Abel on autopilot he still found an amzing melody that gets stuck in my head all the time.

**racloves** (8): I overplayed this too much too

**TiltControls** (8): when you're not left

**dropthehammer11** (7.7): anyone coulda predicted this would be a hit. weeknd is always welcome

**MrMoodle** (7.5): Smooth if not a little lacking in personality

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): I wish the weeknd feature made this less forgettable than it is

**Lipe18090** (7.4): good

**jasannn** (7.2): it’s too much of a vibe for its own good

**Alumineous** (7): Song is a grower. It’s so confusing that Doja sings about both sides of cheating in the album. Multidimensional, that’s for sure. But if a boyfriend breaks up with me for Doja, I wouldn’t even be mad because, like, just look at her.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): correct!

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): The Weeknd is not as good at features as he is at solo music.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): It sounds smooth but also not my favorite single

**astrologicalangel** (6): why is this the only song that doesn't include the feat. in the title on Spotify?

**AzettImpa** (6): awkward how this flopped

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): It’s a chill bop. I guess. Whatever

#they're wrong actually!

**IIIHenryIII** (6): how do you get The Weeknd to feature on such a lackluster track???

**ricki** (6): zzzz

**jackisboredtoday** (5.8): even as a massive abel stan this is very mediocre

**jman457** (5.7): The weeknd helps but not much

**seanderlust** (5.5): "you know, i'm getting the vibe that you might want me" - the weeknd while a girl is actively on top of him

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): That hook is such an earworm but uh-oh the song is boring

**cremeebrulee** (5.3): you are nothing without the luxurious instrumental.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): This collab should’ve been much better.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): what a waste of a Weeknd feature

**hikkaru** (5): so boring for a single

**waluigiest** (5): it could be great but it sounds unfinished. It’s pretty soulless.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4.5): the weeknd doesnt really fit on this beat at all, he sounds so out of place here

**fadedblue09** (4): Abel please leave

**letsallpoo** (4): the weeknd is the physical manifestation of megamind_no_bitches.jpg

**runaway3212** (4): my theory is that this song is about dr luke and a different producer

**thedoctordances1940** (3.9): so fucking boring and then suddenly there's a weeknd feature which just does not work for me

**BasedButta** (3): how does she get such huge feats and their songs end up being so meh? this one is pretty much background noise sorry

**nootnoot781** (3): zzz

**OliviaGodrigo** (3): The lyrics are trash

**akanewasright** (2): why the fuck did Abel choose to feature on this song? Did he hear “And it's just nerves, it's just dick” and say yes automatically?

**DefaultPophead** (1): Dr. Luke songs and "Payday" get an automatic one or zero.

**ebooks #5454** (1): instagram reels has pilled me to hate this song

**Treecoh** (1): dr lukes production sucks here

**ImADudeDuh** (0): this was so fucking boring while having doja cat AND the weeknd on it? AND DR LUKE produced it??? Pick a struggle.

**imbaby122** (0): dr luke aside this song is actually annoying.

Yeah, this is a rerate. And it's not exactly worthy of a rerate. But we had no options for Billie.. literally had to reach back to 2016 for the other bonus song. Let us live!!!

---

**cremeebrulee** (1): was once not enough

---

#Euphoria fans

**AHSWeeknd** (10): My ears want more of this

**vayyiqra** (9): Such a bizarre collab and even weirder is that it works somehow. I can't grasp that these two artists made the kind of ~~ethereal pop music I love; it doesn't compute. And yet here it is. Popheads is going to hate it for being too ambient though I bet. (I mean there aren't even drums on it)

**plastichaxan** (8.5): latinas representing yass

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): Euphoria at least gave us this

**DefaultPophead** (8): I'm not over y'all scoring this so low in the other rate.

**imbaby122** (8): hispanification. latinafication if u ask rosalía tho.

**jasannn** (8): is this hyperpop?

**jaztinax** (8): the auto tune at the end is the bestttt

**runaway3212** (8): fuck it this grew on me

**TChalla1966** (8): forgot this was a thing

**seanderlust** (7.8): i rated this very highly last time because it was very pretty and i expected to return to it. and then i didn't. so i'm gonna take a point or so off because while it's pretty in a kind of wounded way, it is less returnable for me than i figured it would be

**shipperondeck** (7.6): ROSALÍA slayed this feature!!! billie was good too. i don't watch euphoria so idk how well it fits into the show or whatever but the song itself is great

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): yeah this sounds like a song from euphoria

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I remember being hyped for this and then being let down that it was kind of boring

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): it's not the best song ever but it deserves no, absolutely zero, hate

#Euphoria HATERS

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): As much as I love Billie, I think this would’ve been a lot better if it were a song more in Rosalia’s wheelhouse instead of sounding like they put her on a Billie song

**jman457** (6.3): feels a bit disjointed

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (6): Kinda slow, but definitely far from bad.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): No, my high school experience is NOT like this show whatsoever, like seriously. First of all, I’m Asian,

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): It’s fine.

**dropthehammer11** (5.5): kinda flat honestly, and im a fan of both artists

**akanewasright** (5): they hyped this song up for 2 years and for WHAT???

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): not into it and it's boring

**celladonn** (5): This collab should have been great but it's just kind of nothing

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (5): Is that the whole song lolll?

**frogaranaman** (5): Billie teaming up with ROSALÍA for an annunciation joint slay YASSSS

**nlh1013** (5): pretty but not a huge fan of songs I can’t understand all the words to

**TiltControls** (5): wish there was something more here

**wasian-invasion** (5): such a weird concept for a song lol

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): billie shines on great production and this is not good production

**IIIHenryIII** (4): boring af

**DirtyRat583** (3.8): billie stop making vaguely hazy music

**iniekcja\_** (3): wish I could forget

**MassiveThief** (3): this collab deserved better

**modulum83** (3): this is like if you asked an AI to generate a billie eilish song by describing her music to it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): this really goes nowhere

Our first average above 7, and we saved it for the most robbed song so far! This song is so beautiful and pretty while also having great lyrics. In the end, despite all of that, it simply was no match for balladphobia. Too many people found it boring and felt like it left no impact. All of them were wrong, of course, but it impacted the song too much to get a higher position. In a more just world this would've been early day 3, but sadly we don't live there. 

---

#lets the void consume them

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Nailed it here, seriously great

**Alumineous** (10): Again, the lyrics. I’m taking this song way too seriously because I sometimes want to go home when I’m at home. Running away, mentally or physically, is such a familiar feeling. That’s depression for you.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): damn

**jman457** (10): This track progresses beautiful

**ormysonormysonormys** (10): the album is so well- constructed and this has so much catharsis in the track listing, also the longest song which I love

**runaway3212** (10): This album is actually such a smash

**sufjancaesar** (10): Hella underrated for some reason?? His falsetto is so excellent here, and the song is v emotional

**modulum83** (9.5): BONUS DREAM POP POINTS ADDED: +2

**akanewasright** (9): I don’t know what to say about this song aside from “it makes me feel things”. But “oh blue, I write for you” legitimately makes me tear up a lot of the time

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): Just powerful in every way. The way the song evolves (even if it takes a little too long imo) is great.

**fairytalehigh** (9): i always forget this song is on the album and then when i hear it again i'm blown away by how nice it is.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (9): Awesome power ballad. It’ll be in rotation for a long time, I bet.

**TiltControls** (9): LNX really slayed the more serious slower songs on this album. Really wouldn't of expected it from the 'Old Town Road' guy a few years ago, but time and time again he's showed how much talent he's got

**UselessTacooo** (9): Beautiful song that with a few changes oils have been an 11 contender. Instead, I just think it’s missing something

**fadedblue09** (8.5): A nice moment of vulnerability

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this album is actually more depressing than happy. Also I think this is the most underrated song on the album

**jaztinax** (8.5): am i the only one who thinks of “bottom of the ocean” by miley cyrus when listening to this??

**just\_thonking** (8.5): This feels more vulnerable than any song on SOUR

**nooodisaster** (8.5): I ruined this song bc I can't help but picture "Blue" as the dog from "Blue's Clues"

**Awkward\_King** (8): this is so pretty why do i not remember this at all

**DefaultPophead** (8): I can't rest, I can't fight | All I need is you and I, without you, without you

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): see? he CAN write songs that are longer than 3 minutes

**vayyiqra** (8): Someone please give this man a hug he needs and deserves it

**waluigiest** (8): okay love simon

**shipperondeck** (7.9): out of the slower songs on the album, this is one of my faves. start of verse 2 is honestly gut wrenching.

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): Alexa play The Void by Metric

**jasannn** (7.5): this would make a really good EDM remix tbh

**RandomHypnotica** (7.5): i did not expect lil nas to write a song about hodor but here we are

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): it's fine

**CrimsonROSET** (7): :(

**imbaby122** (7): this is the longest song on the album and i don’t know that it fills it’s time completely. i think it could’ve been shorter. but emotional asf 😿

**Lipe18090** (7): ok

**slimboyfriend** (7): This might sound crazy, but imagine…. Lil Nas X  + dream pop crossover

**wasian-invasion** (7): on first listen I couldn’t really pay attention but now I kinda vibe

**welcome2thejam** (7): Got better on subsequent listens

#actually goes to therapy or something ig

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): there are some genuinely good parts here and somewhere in it is a really good song but it just needs to pack way more of a punch

**1998tweety** (6.5): snooze a bit

**MrMoodle** (6.5): Literally who on planet fucking earth asked for multtiple Lil Nas X sad boy ballads please man I’m sorry lmao just make bops it’s not even that bad but c’mon you’re better than this

**AzettImpa** (6): worst song on the album but still good

**IIIHenryIII** (6): if I'm being honest, I didn't expect to hear this kind of sound from him. He has my attention.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A meh song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This is obviously very heartfelt but musically it’s just not doing a lot for me.

**CarlieScion** (5): tiktok has ruined my attention span

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i think i'd like this more if it was sung by someone w stronger vocals

**bookthieving** (4): lnx has some nice ballads but his vocals are consistently the weakest part of them

**nlh1013** (4): it sounds like he is saying hodor

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (4): sorry

**2dina3dworld** (3): Lil Nas X really out here sending letters to an Australian kids show character

**joeeswift** (3): this one kinda drags

**pig-serpent** (3): Void is right this song makes me feel nothing.

**you2009** (1.5): singing doesn't help this already boring song

From one robbery due to balladphobia into another robbery due to balladphobia. This song was a highlight for me during early listens of _Happier Than Ever_, but the more I listened to the album, the more the song grew off me. It's still great, but I'm not as impressed with it as I used to be. The best part is still the outro, which alone made it that this song should've placed higher, but it takes a long time to get to the beautiful outro, meaning the song drags a bit sonically. Lyrically, however, this is still one of the best songs on the album. There's such a beauty in the metaphor of Halley's comet, something that's eventful and pretty but also rare. It describes a dedication to love that’s so intense in so much detail it’s a spiritual sequel to "i love you" from her debut album, but it doubles down on both the intensity of the love and on the desperation that comes with it. A really robbed song.

---

#calling myself out and saying yes, in fact, it is a real comet

**frogaranaman** (7): is this a real comet

#loves space

**akanewasright** (10): I was in love with someone in a different time zone from me, she came for me PERSONALLY with this one

**Awkward\_King** (10): but i must admit you've been in quite a few

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This was my least favorite song on the album when it came out and now it’s a 10. That’s a grower.

**ebooks #5454** (10): i did not realize this was a breakup album i thought this was an album about being happy

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): Every now and then, Billie writes a song so beautiful it makes you want to weep. This is one of those.

**ricki** (10): i can't stand her

**runaway3212** (10): the outro I fucking love so much

**shhhneak** (10): If this is in your top 3 on the album you have taste.

**Stryxen** (10): staring at the ceiling

**sufjancaesar** (10): If the whole song was like 2:42 onwards, this would be my 11

**cremeebrulee** (9.6): "i feel more and more like I was made for you" fuck off omg? 😭😭

**AHSWeeknd** (9): her stans and the remaining tumblr girls live for this but I don’t.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): i love how old-timey it sounds and yeah, that is all needed to be said other than "I gave it a perfect score since I like it"

**Lipe18090** (9): beautiful, amazing outro

**majid** (9): i LOVED that outro, it caught me off guard

**musical\_pyn** (9): I really, really love the imagery here, and billie's voice sounds especially good. Also the ending is a great way to transition to the second half of the album

**wasian-invasion** (9): is so pretty

**shipperondeck** (8.8): ok i usually do not like piano ballads and i found this shit pretty boring. BUT THEN. later in the year i ended up completely relating to this song </3 so yes im biased

**mysario** (8.6): according to my FitBit, my average sleep time is less than 6 hours every night so I like kinda relate

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): aw this is a cute one

**celladonn** (8.5): Very pretty

**modulum83** (8.5): the outro is one of my favorite things on the entire album

**seanderlust** (8.5): this reminds me a lot of the first part of halsey's forever (is a long time). i don't think i ended up giving that an 11 but it was damn close. I don't like this quite as much but I do quite like it

**UselessTacooo** (8.5): SITTING IN MY BROTHERS ROOM!! (GONE WRONG)(POLICE CALLED)

**1998tweety** (8): shes cute

**CrimsonROSET** (8): jointslay i havent slept in a week either!

**emmaelf** (8): i love chill piano

**fairytalehigh** (8): "midnight for me is 3 AM for you" i'm east coast, can't relate

**jasannn** (8): This may or may not have been my favorite track on first listen becuase it reminded of Planeterium from the La La Land Soundtrack

**RandomHypnotica** (7.9): tbh, the outro outsells the rest of the song lmao

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): I don't particularly like this song, but I am absolutely drawn to it. I want to simultaneously score it higher and lower, so this score feels in the middle and the only right choice.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I prefer the second half cause it reminds me of La La land

**jaztinax** (7.5): ngl i could barely get through this song when it first came out but it has been slowly growing on me. it is really pretty, but billie’s slow, quiet songs always are slow burns for me

**just\_thonking** (7.5): Her voice is really the selling point of this song

**nooodisaster** (7.5): Sad and cute, gays can relate.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7.5): delicate and tasteful with a pretty ending

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Um AcTuaLlY IT’s PrONouNCeD “HAL-EES”

**TiltControls** (7.5): This is sweet

**jman457** (7.2): Its fine but a bit weak considering whats here; a wish the outro was its whole song because she put her debussy in it

**emayzee** (7.1): kinda boring but i like the vocal effects at the end

**waluigiest** (7): It’s so heavy handed. But sometimes it’s right.

**you2009** (6.8): loved the piano outro and how the vocals are mixed a bit far back

**racloves** (6.5): it’s a beautiful song but I don’t find myself coming back to it often

**flavasavavandal** (6): it’s a really pretty song, too bad it doesn’t do anything beyond that

**imbaby122** (6): one thing about me is that a pretty outro is the way to my heart <3 even if i thought the rest of the song was a bore whoops

**oscarbrierley1** (6): wish it had a more dramatic climax don't feel like it really fits her voice

**vayyiqra** (6): The lyrics hit when you have insomnia like me

#HATES space. possibly anti-NASA

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s pretty but I also kinda feel nothing from it

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): Good melodies, but that ending kinda ruins the song.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): just hit her already, Halley

**plastichaxan** (5): i was so bored but those last seconds are amazing why does she keep doing this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i like the idea of the song but it doesn't do anything for me

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): hopefully she won't make another song this boring for 75 years at least

**pig-serpent** (4): The extra song tacked on at the end is better than the real song.

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (3): this middle section of the album is so boring

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): zzzzzzz

**welcome2thejam** (3): Felt a bit like 75 years tbh

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3): snooze

**BasedButta** (2): just very dreary

**DirtyRat583** (0): no thoughts (derogatory) its bland and basic and it makes me wish for anything to happen

A cool title for a meh song. The slow rock side of this album is not my favourite and I am not alone in that. It's not that the style doesn't fit his voice (his vocal performance here is actually pretty nice), it's more that the rest of the song is sonically not that interesting and goes nowhere. Lyrically, the concept is interesting, but the song doesn't do a lot with it. All in all, this song deserved day 2, but probably also could've gone day 1.

#r/indieheads subscriberss

**BasedButta** (11): what you want from meeeeee - mr lil nas x what i want from you is more melodic songs with electric guitars you are very good at them

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A vibe, if I was a witch I’d be living

**Alumineous** (10): These serious songs are my favorite.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): ooooooh this is like what the fifty shades soundtrack would have been in a world those books are good

**jsonphile** (10): if I had a nickel for every album on this rate that had a second to last song that goes way harder than I expected to when I first listened to it I’d have two nickels which isn’t a lot but it’s weird it happened twice

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): OH MY GODDDDD

**UselessTacooo** (10): Easily the best song on this album. Something about it just hits in a way nothing else does. I don’t know why so many people hate on this one, but it honestly deserves to win and when it’s a day 1 cut I will be devastated.

**waluigiest** (10): this is my favorite song on the album and I’ve never seen anyone talk about it! It’s stylistically unlike anything else on the album, yet fits into the aesthetic perfectly. The huge, almost industrial chorus is show-stopping.

**jaztinax** (9): is this grunge????

**N454545** (9): "WHAT YOU WANT FROM MEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE YEAHHH" -Me annoying the neighbors at 1am

**plastichaxan** (9): hello????

**RandomHypnotica** (8.7): is this a radiohead song

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): best sadder song on the album? Possibly? Still kind of kitschy though?

**MrMoodle** (8.5): kinda goth girl energy i like it

**jman457** (8.4): this guitar is sexy

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): okay lil nas x is really rocking now

**celladonn** (8): This was definitely the standout non-single for me on first listen to the album. It's grown off me a little, but it's still really good.

**hikkaru** (8): love the drama of this...

**Uberpigeon** (8): indie promo omg thank u

**you2009** (8): actually really enjoy his singing on this one

**shipperondeck** (7.9): man this song is so dreary but i don't mean that in a bad way. the song provides extremely detailed imagery for me for some reason (emotional breakdown in an abandoned shack in the forest at night, if you're wondering).

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7.5): good

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): This takes a while to get going but it does hit by the end.

**FroyoFox\_125** (7.5): My least favorite track but still pretty good

**TiltControls** (7.5): Love the atmosphere on the track

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): theyre burning all the witches even if you’re that bitch that killed satan

**Lipe18090** (7): good

**modulum83** (7): like what this represents way more than what it actually is

**nooodisaster** (7): Lowkey bottom anthem

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): The label asked “How many different genres of music do you want on the album?”, and Lil Nas replied “Yes”

**TheQueenofVultures** (7): I'm trying to get adderall too

**welcome2thejam** (7): Up for this sound switch-up, if only that guitar ripped better on the second solo

**akanewasright** (6.8): I’m gonna be honest, I never know how I’m gonna feel about this one when it comes on. I think I lean more positive right now

**jackisboredtoday** (6.6): I enjoy this now but I can already tell how much I’ll be embarrassed admitting that in the future because this is SO melodramatic and filled with portentous movie-trailer production

**fairytalehigh** (6.5): i appreciate the boldness in experimenting and i love the lyrics but this song really isn't it for me, sorry

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): I feel like this has an awkward pace and is just sung in an awkward way.

**imbaby122** (6.5): i don’t think lil nas is strong enough vocally to carry this song. and it’s a little noisy. but it bangs.

**1998tweety** (6): alright

**DefaultPophead** (6): Salem is my go to city when watching British quiz shows and they ask about US capital cities.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I like the title of this song waaay more than the contents

#called r/indieheads sexist during the exchange rate

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this doesn't sound healthy at all

**jasannn** (5): I appreciate how dramatic it is but it doesnt have the payoff

**pig-serpent** (5): I thought the dark mood of this song was really cool at first but actually it's kind of boring and the only thing is has going for it is not sounding like the rest of the album.

**vayyiqra** (5): I don't like the guitar on this (though I know it's meant to be jarring and ugly) but after the drums come in it's better. This song sounds like having a breakdown so I don't enjoy it much but it does achieve what it's trying to do well.

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): I think the album could have ended without these last two songs

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (4): I feel like this could’ve been executed a little better, but as it is, it’s okay.

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): He doesn’t sound very good when he’s trying to sing

**poemforsmallthings** (4): ?

**runaway3212** (4): I just don’t love the final tracks of this album that much they drag the entire project

**ImADudeDuh** (3): no hes not good at this slower rock style

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): did this need to be here

**Awkward\_King** (2): i want to like this creepy, climactic, metaphorical penultimate track more but i rly kinda dont enjoy this at all

First off, looking at the music video's from _Planet Her_, I find it hard to believe Doja has never done drugs. This song is about as interesting as one of those 'hey kid, don't do drugs!' episode that I heard y'all have in the US (I'm Dutch so can't relate). It's not a terrible listen but it's also definitely not something I would put on myself. Normally for a _Planet Her_ track that wouldn't be too bad, but when you have a collab with Ariana Grande, it becomes a lot worse. This like "You Right:" should've been so much more exciting than it was in the end. Also like "You Right," I highly suspect this would've been lower without the name recognition that comes with Ariana. Oh well, at least "motive" is still good.

---

#is a fan of D.A.R.E.

**1998tweety** (10): deserves to smash, their best collab. The chorus...I'm levitating

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Ariana mistook “Ariana black” for “Ariana crack” and got a feature on this song.

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): Can't understand what Ariana is saying, but yes ma'am, I totally agree!

**ManofOranges** (10): I feel like this song is really corny in some ways. I mean, it makes the typical love-drug analogy, which has been done a million times before. But there's something striking about it to me. I'm currently in a spot in my life where I'm struggling between moving on from someone and yet still trying to hold onto them at the same time, so I guess hearing Doja and Ariana sing 'It's time for me to let you go' and shit like that really just hits home. Ariana also just sounds really fantastic in this song.

**MassiveThief** (10): her best song if im bein honest

**nooodisaster** (10): Outsold all D.A.R.E. ad-campaigns ever. Actually my favorite song on the album and I'm probably gonna be alone on this one. But Ari and Doja are a great duo, the production is top tier (and no D- L---), and the lyrics are a subversion of love = drugs.

**UselessTacooo** (10): This gets way too much hate from the public. Doja sounds incredible and Ari verse is nice too.

**sparklesandlight** (9.8): Ariana!!!!!!!!!!!!

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): ITS HARD FOR ME TO LET YOU GOOOOOO

**fadedblue09** (9.5): Really catchy and Ariana's low register really worked here

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): this song is so fun it makes me want to do drugs

**you2009** (9.5): I love d.a.r.e

**Lipe18090** (9.4): best ariana song of 2021 lol also best song in the album, been adicted to it since it released

**RandomHypnotica** (9.4): your stage name is literally slang for weed

**oscarbrierley1** (9.3): ariana's verse goes hard idc

**ebooks #5454** (9): ok these bitches have definitely done drugs before cOME ONNN

**pig-serpent** (9): There's a great bounciness to the beat, and the sultriness Doja brings by singing with the lower part of her register sounds much better than the baby voice/bad Nicki impression she's doing elsewhere on Planet Her.

**TChalla1966** (9): totally forgot Ariana was on this album but cute surprise

**vayyiqra** (9): Ariana and Doja is kind of a dream team and their voices harmonize very well.

**wasian-invasion** (9): you say you do not drugs yet you are named *doja* cat? curious

**welcome2thejam** (9): Future D.A.R.E. winners Doja Cat and Ariana Grande

**akanewasright** (8.8): https://c.tenor.com/g7nzxqrG9GIAAAAC/girl-sure-jan.gif

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): this is honestly pretty nice I wish I could hear Ariana’s harmonizing a bit more but they both sound great together

**shhhneak** (8.5): If Doja, Ariana, Meg and The Weeknd all appeared on the same song I fear it would be a Higgs Boson level event. The ouroboros of songs.

**TiltControls** (8.5): unrelated, but this reminds me of a "don't do drugs in residence" poster I used to have in my 1st year that my roommate crossed out the 'nt' on. We kept that poster on our fridge for the 5 years we lived together after that until his cat tore it up one day. rip

**babadork** (8.3): That this sounds more like an Ariana Granda track than a Doja Cat one is a great example of how versatile she is.

**BasedButta** (8): this had such a good sound to it but it ended up being underwhelming. kinda lost the gas idk

**jsonphile** (8): DARE programs gonna start using this as their theme song

**just\_thonking** (8): Well I do

**MrMoodle** (8): Ari works perfectly on this track, her part sounds great. But she kinda shits all over Doja on her own song. Her vocals slide over the beat so smoothly that on repeated listening you just wanna skip to the really good part. Would’ve worked better with her as the main artist and Doja the feature. Obviously it’s Doja’s song and she had absolutely no obligation to give it up lol but it probably would’ve been for the track’s betterment.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): Ariana sounds sexier on this than she does on most of her actual songs.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): i love this but it does feel like filler, especially for a doja/ari song

**TragicKingdom1** (8): genuinely surprised this hasnt been viral or a single

**ReallyCreative** (7.8): it's cute but I'm still waiting for a collaboration between these two to blow me away

**jaztinax** (7.5): this grew on me over time but for a song that has an ariana feature on it, it’s a liiittle forgettable

**modulum83** (7.5): very good chorus

**mysario** (7.1): you'd expect two powerhouses to have a huge Smash but instead we merely got a Cartoon Network Punch Time Explosion

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): Kinda strange, but I’m dancing in my seat, so I think that means I like it?

**AzettImpa** (7): motive was better

**CarlieScion** (7): bitch me too? tf

**IIIHenryIII** (7): good 4 u

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): girl me neither you’re not special

**racloves** (6.5): I think my expectations for a collab between Doja & Ari were too high, I like it but it’s not my fav personally

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): this is bland so maybe it should try something drugggier to spice things up

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): hearing Ariana Grande rap over here is the same as hearing Selena Gomez weird-singing in Coldplay's recent album, its fine but I wouldn't care for it.

**apatel27** (6): It'd be nice if there was anything interesting about her RnB but it is what it is

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): I liked this song when it came out but now that I think about it it's kinda basic and mid

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i’m sure you don’t doja cat

**DefaultPophead** (6): This song is a bit boring, but I enjoyed it enough.

**devilonmytongue0** (6): can’t relate to this

**emmaelf** (6): eh i don't really like ariana and this didn't sell me

**joeeswift** (6): still shocked an Ariana and Doja Cat collab wasn’t one of the songs on the album to go viral, but that just shows it was mediocre compared to everything else

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A bit catchy but not enough for me to like it

**Awkward\_King** (5): like they both sound good and the song is pleasant to listen to but why does it exist

**frogaranaman** (5): imagine publicly admitting you're a loser to this mid of a song

**musical\_pyn** (5): other than the harmonies, there isn't a lot going on here honestly

**imbaby122** (4.5): i can’t imagine that real estate agent being great at eating ari out from the back… she seems satisfied tho good for her

**jman457** (4.5): It just seems so generic

**shipperondeck** (4.5): this is where the album drops off significantly overall imo. i think this is kinda predictable and boring, and ariana's feature doesn't help it much

**seanderlust** (4.1): it's fine and vibey and all, but feels pretty unremarkable. I think there are songs from both artists here that I would rather listen to that achieve the same vibe

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): This is catchy I guess but it’s really underwhelming for what this collab could have been.

**flavasavavandal** (4): a lie

**plastichaxan** (4): i was so bored

**tickframe** (4): i guess i expected something way too grand from this collab

**waluigiest** (4): something about the “thunder lightning” is so offensively bad to me

**thedoctordances1940** (3.3): genuinely a terrible beat

**Alumineous** (3): This song came in the left ear. And immediately left the right one. Doja doesn’t sound in her element, like I feel like Ariana suppresses Doja’s artistry. But Doja trying to keep up with Ariana at 70 percent of her vocal potential is VERY impressive, so props to her.

**ImADudeDuh** (2): i should’ve known this was gonna be garbage by the fact that it was a doja cat/ariana grande collab and wasn’t shoved down my tiktok fyp

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (1): The bane of my existence. Why, why, WHY?? Especially when Motive was a bit of a banger

**runaway3212** (1): Ariana literally adds negative value to this song

**RandomHypnotica** (11): literally my favourite thing in 2021, it was just the gift that KEPT. ON. GIVING. So many hilariously over the top and desperate comments and attempts to be taken seriously. “I don’t think any actor should be pushed to that limit”. The horrible accent. Writing an 80 page biography and her side spin about being an investigative journalist at the white house. That insane interview with Jake Gyllenhall. AND OF COURSE THE SWARM OF FLIES!!! SHE’S STILL ALIVE STEFANI, HOW IS SHE CONTROLLING THESE FLY SWARMS AND SENDING THEM TO YOU? I still laugh uncontrollably at how absurd this situation is, and how overdramatic and sensationalist she got over a decent at best performance is wildly hilarious to me and it’s one of my favourite things in the past few years.

**runaway3212** (8): Her doing all this work but refusing to read the book the movie was based on it’s such a kiii

Megan Thee Stallion is one of the most exciting names in music right now, the energy she brings to every single song is so great and she knows how to perfectly combine exciting with catchy. Listening to a Megan song is like listening to the soundtrack of heaven. The reason she wasn't featured on _Planet Her_ was simply because it wasn't yass & slay enough for her. She saw this track and she thought "I could fix him" and she couldn't, but at least it has a slay verse now.

---

#real hot girl shit

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Megan is genius, but what else is new

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): wish megan had a longer verse but she did what she must.

**cremeebrulee** (8.4): rip the montero/planet her/good news idea, 2021's slate c </3

**Alumineous** (8): Hmm, I love Megan, but she kinda ruined it. But Lil Nas was great!

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (8): I’m gonna pretend I know what “Dolla Sign Slime” means

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this duo just makes sense how is this their first collab

**frogaranaman** (8): Megan's porn category name would be 'Something For Thee Hotties'

**ignitethephoenix** (8): he really said fuck the straights by calling it dollar sign slime, not having young thug, and the putting Megan on it instead

**iniekcja\_** (8): I truly love Megan but she really does always sound the same

**pig-serpent** (8): Nintendo DS Midi horn type beat

**racloves** (8): this was playing inside Sports Direct a couple weeks back and some dad was vibing to it

**ReallyCreative** (8): I can unfortunately see this one going very early but it's fun

**shipperondeck** (8): once again the horns!! HELL YEAH!!! also just a really fun song with one of my fav titles in this whole rate. meg's verse is SO good. and her laugh. bless.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): they both came to give us what we need

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): is this sample from Little Einsteins

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): of course Megan went off

**imbaby122** (7.5): “bitch i do not do labor”…. he’s just like me fr 💪

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7.5): still baffled that this song doesn't have Ty Dolla Sign on like brother in christ you chose that song name

**UselessTacooo** (7.3): serving goose honk

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): pretty fine and Megan Thee Stallion ate it up with her verse!

**skargardin** (7): megan's verse is kinda weak here tbh but otherwise, it slaps

**slimboyfriend** (7): I need LNX to bring every female rapper to his next album

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Megan saves this one methinks

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): outside of meg's verse, this just feels like a worse industry baby

**vayyiqra** (6): Idk it's too short but that horn line is fun and Megan is a good collaborator for Nas since they both have the same kind of irreverant energy

#anti-porn, even if it's Megan

**thedoctordances1940** (5.9): not the worst but the longer it goes on the more the beat just becomes irritating. Megan's feature is also quite sub-standard for her, her flow just sounds a bit stiff at times and just doesn't really add anything

**fadedblue09** (5.5): I blinked and it was finished

**flavasavavandal** (5.5): Megan’s verse is amazing but there is nothing else of value here

**Awkward\_King** (5): megan's verse sounds like it was recorded for a different song, i also rly like the horns on this but they arent enough to save it

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): This song is just okay but I do love the Runescape realness that the YouTube visuals are giving.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): too much Nas X not enough Megan

**jman457** (5): Considering the talent involved wish there was more

**nooodisaster** (5): Megan is great as always, but wtf is Dollar sign slime? Actually I don't want to know let me be old.

**sufjancaesar** (5): Megan’s verse is a masterclass in surrealism

**wasian-invasion** (5): idk it feels like kind of a letdown for a collab with so much potential

**IIIHenryIII** (4): Megan's part is too short :( she almost saved the song though

**runaway3212** (4): no album is perfect and this song doesn’t even try

**musical\_pyn** (3): megan is just so good and completely steals the show tbh (rest of the song is awful though oops)

A song that made it a lot further than I expected, but I'm really happy about that! After "Not My Responsibility," this track comes in and expands the feeling of that song even further. There is such a constant stress that comes with fame and this track really explores it well. It's not the best song about the paparazzi or the struggles of fame even just on this album, but the intensity of the vocal performance makes up for that. It really feels in every way shape and form like Billie is just done with it all and that makes the song impactful.

#hot ppl

**AHSWeeknd** (10): My old MacBook when I try to play Minecraft on it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): ate the paps up

**modulum83** (10): this is the kind of pop music i like the most which may explain why i don't get invited to parties

**ormysonormysonormys** (10): not my responsibility part 2, this time with singing!

**relibee2** (10): it's the way this honestly could've been a single

**UselessTacooo** (10): This song is way too underrated. If the general public liked it more I would give it my 11 but I will settle for a 10. The way it incorporates NMR is so good.

**akanewasright** (9): *twerks in feminism*

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): guys, gals and gays, there's a reason why Hayley Williams considered it to be the best song off this album

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): would've been a 10 but I had to subtract a point for the mild sexism in the bridge (WOMEN CAN GET PLASTIC SURGERY IF THEY WANT TO, BILLIE)

**FroyoFox\_125** (9): Should've been a single bitch

**iniekcja\_** (9): makes me remember the time I burned a hole in one of my favorite shirts, dark times, dark times indeed

**vayyiqra** (9): "Not My Responsiblity" part 2 but even better. I love the instrumental more.

**waluigiest** (9): in case you missed Not My Responsibility

**RandomHypnotica** (8.9): this isn't as good as not my responsibility but it reminds me a lot of ilomilo

**you2009** (8.9): I'm glad the ghostly synth from nmr carried over to this track it's so delicious

**jman457** (8.7): the flow from the last track into this track was amazing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): Hits different during a late night drive.

**jsonphile** (8.5): my laptop when I have 57 google chrome tabs open and I have Netflix on in the background and I’m playing a game

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Love the transition/transformation with NMR

**nooodisaster** (8.5): She comes for EVERYONE in this song, the bitch is nasty and has a bad attitude on life. We stan.

**ricki** (8.5): my laptop after i try to open an adobe program

**jaztinax** (8.1): this song doesn’t really do much but i like the production and it’s catchy, so it’s all i need

**ebooks #5454** (8): me wearing mad layers leaving the house so my mom doesn't dress-code me for the outfit imma change into when im out oops

**fadedblue09** (8): Love the lush beats

**fairytalehigh** (8): me when i get too hot

**N454545** (8): oh its the song

**ReallyCreative** (8): my pizza rolls in the microwave

**1998tweety** (7.5): the production on this song and the last few are quite nice, it's moody and atmospheric. its kinda all it does but I guess its enough

**TiltControls** (7.5): my old laptop when it was on for more than 0.52 seconds

**shipperondeck** (7.2): i love the segues in this album so much. besides that i like the song idk what else to say

**DefaultPophead** (7): I really like how it flows on from Not My Responsbility!

**IIIHenryIII** (7): overrated

**imbaby122** (7): i like the idea that plastic surgery makes you inanimate. like every time you go under the knife a little bit of your life force is taken away 🤔 i feel like we should make that a thing maybe then i wouldn’t want a fat transfer

**Lipe18090** (7): wow this one surprised me, i didn't remember it being good

**majid** (7): i really dislike the chorus but i love the bridge

**runaway3212** (7): cooking is like what I imagine hell is like

#cold ppl

**emmaelf** (6.5): it's just very billie eilish. like an ai machine learnt how to make a billie song.

**MrMoodle** (6.5): I like this but it wouldn’t hit nearly as hard without Not My Responsibility. Lyrics on the chorus are kinda lazy.

**babadork** (6.1): It’s a little unfocused, and I’m not a fan of how self-love songs can include criticizing other people’s bodies and their choices.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): drink water

**frogaranaman** (6): me this past summer, that bitch was hot as fuck

**musical\_pyn** (6): i like the beat and the bridge, but the rest of the song just doesn't click for me

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (6): Nothing really that special about this song to me.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (6): it was my fave first listen but oh how the mighty have fallen

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Just kinda fades into the background…

**wasian-invasion** (6): idk the rhyming of the chorus feels so simplistic

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.5): it's fine

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): why is there a random verse in this dissing plastic surgery

**ImADudeDuh** (4): wow this album gets bad in the middle

**OliviaGodrigo** (4): The hook is just awful. It sounds like they were just trying to make a decent transition from the interlude but it doesn’t land for me.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (3): I’m so bored, holy crap.

**DirtyRat583** (3): this is just a vague aura. the first thing to come to mind with this is the undertale hotland, like that vibe - not the vibe i like.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3): zzzzzz

**CarlieScion** (2): yes girl go give us nothing

**jaztinax** (7): interesting choice of a bonus track… why

**vayyiqra** (7): idk what this is but it's pretty

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): The glow up of going from this snoozer to Ocean Eyes….

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): billie shines on great production and this is not good production

**imbaby122** (4): this is boring who injected this song with horse tranquilizer

**MrMoodle** (4): I love Billie now but I can’t fully get behind anything pre-WWAFAWDWG, I never really understand why people lumped her in with the wispy sad girl trend but it totally makes sense now listening to shit like this

**DefaultPophead** (2): Her worst song in the rate by far...

Imagine your collab with an artist getting outsold by a collab from that same artist with your dad, I would be so embarrassed. While this song never beats the high bar of "Old Town Road," Miley sounds good on it. Arguably this was the most unexpected collab of this entire rate, but it works surprisingly well, as an individual song and as a closer. However, it didn't do better because it is a ballad and we know how y'all feel about those. Oh well, just making it top the half of the rate is still an achievement in itself.

---

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): What a way to end an album. Montero and Miley’s voices mix so well together, and the song itself is simply beautiful. Ooh! Also, you can hear a bit of this melody in the outro of SUN GOES DOWN.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): God I already know this is gonna get so robbed. It’s sad!

**devilonmytongue0** (10): hey miley (this reminds me of forgiveness and love lol)

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): This song is excellent, and Miley and Nas' voices go so well together. The chorus melody is infectious also!

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): This song is going to be played at a lot of people’s funerals.

**ricki** (10): he's slowly collaborating with the entire Cyrus household, Noah is next

**sufjancaesar** (10): Miley and LNX dropped a track with no overt country or rock influences, am I dreaming?

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): absolutely in love with the vibes on this one. miley’s voice compliments lil nas x’s so well. im not sure if this was intentional or not (considering its lnx, i wouldnt be surprised if it was), but ending his debut album with a song that features the daughter of the man who helped him launch his career is an oddly beautiful note to end this album on

**UselessTacooo** (10): Noah Cyrus next and he will have collaborated with the whole Cyrus family

**jaztinax** (9.5): dream duo!!

**BasedButta** (9): top 0.1% slow songs ever. congratulations man this is an achievement

**emmaelf** (9): a lovely, heartfelt duet. miley and lnx bring out the best in each other and it just makes me feel cosy listening to it.

**fairytalehigh** (9): really such a beautiful song and such a good way to end the album.

**jasannn** (9): it’s a gay Nothing New

**musical\_pyn** (9): ugh I love Miley on this

**N454545** (9): sad

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (9): idk i just love it. miley fits in so well. it's just a good song

**akanewasright** (8.5): This would be a 10 without Miley, or even if this was a Miley solo song. The two of them got very different assignments and it makes me love a song less because of it. But god DAMN I love this song in spite of that.

**emayzee** (8.5): he's collecting the cyrus family like infinity stones. i need a collab with metro station next

**imbaby122** (8.5): yeah this broke me i don’t have anything else to say 😿

**TiltControls** (8.5): fantastic output from both LNX and Miley here

**RandomHypnotica** (8.4): miley fits on this song better than on her own music

**2dina3dworld** (8.2): this was good until Miley Cyrus came in. -1.8 points for that

**mysario** (8.2): hoping for the Noah Cyrus collab on the next album

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): his voice with Miley Cyrus fits well, I hope they'll collaborate more.

**AzettImpa** (8): we need a new miley album.

**frogaranaman** (8): This is such a devastatingly good album closer.

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I kind of like Miley’s part more than LNX’s but they both did great

**MassiveThief** (8): beautiful closer!

**ormysonormysonormys** (8): sums up the album, Lil Nas trying to cement his legacy and telling us who he is in the process

**vayyiqra** (8): If you told me in 2019 that Lil Nas X would end his debut album with a sad acoustic ballad I'd ... maybe think that makes a lot of sense in fact.

**wasian-invasion** (8): cute closer

**seanderlust** (7.8): a concept track about sinking in the middle of the ocean?? kate bush is QUAKING.

**shipperondeck** (7.6): i really like this duo. feels like 2 friends by singing together by a dying campfire. i'm going to stop with the imagery now lmao but yeah, this one is simple but touching. a good closer.

**jman457** (7.5): A fun little ending

**AHSWeeknd** (7): should’ve put Miley on one of the rock influenced tracks

**bigbigbee** (7): I can feel Miley’s influence. This feels like it could fit right in on Plastic Hearts, and I really like her parts especially.

**ebooks #5454** (7): chowder x hannah montana collab

**nooodisaster** (7): Never hit as much as I wanted it to but it is a nice conclusion

**steelstepladder** (7): omg I love Without You - The Kid Laroi (Miley Cyrus remix)

**modulum83** (6.8): it's just too obvious man

**1998tweety** (6.5): ok

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6.5): I feel like this is a bit underwhelming as a closer but it's alright

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): fine song, but a little bit of a halt of momentum to end the record imo

**Stryxen** (6.2): miley sounds. odd

**Alumineous** (6): Miley was great. Might I say even saved the track.

**CrimsonROSET** (6): his voice goes a bit on the kid laroi side but i’m ok with that kinda but then miley comes in?

**DefaultPophead** (6): Would've been a ten if the feature was cut.

**fadedblue09** (6): A bit overdramatic but I love the intimacy. And Miley is surprisingly not bad

**iniekcja\_** (6): not a good song but a really good closer

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): miley really shone here

**Uberpigeon** (6): indie promo omg no thank u

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I mean it’s cute? But honestly kind of a letdown of a closer

**Lipe18090** (5.5): least favorite of the album

**pig-serpent** (5): I'm not too into this song but I respect that Lil Nas wails over the acoustic guitar when so many people are afraid to.

**ReallyCreative** (5): a very mediocre way to end this album, terribly boring outside of like, the last belt

**runaway3212** (5): Miley is a weird fit for this song, like I would say this fits much better as an individual ballad and her voice is too heavy

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): TOO SLOW. But I guess putting me to sleep makes sense considering the title

**you2009** (4.5): would've been higher, but not by that much, if there were no feature. outro is also too long

**jackisboredtoday** (4.3): The collab with Billy Ray is a classic, this Miley collab is bad, maybe a collab with Noah will split the difference with mediocrity

**IIIHenryIII** (4): am I? 'cuz I think I fell asleep

**waluigiest** (4): you’re not dreaming, but you did fall asleep.

**welcome2thejam** (4): Weak track to end on, tbh

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): miley u lucky this is your only appearance in this rate

**ImADudeDuh** (3): this album kinda tanked by the end

The highest of the Doja album tracks, "Naked" is a great song that deserved more. It's really reminiscent of early Doja songs just in how fun it is and how it doesn't take itself too seriously. It's is not a song trying to be sexy about getting naked, it's just trying to have a lot of fun and this makes listening to it also a lot of fun.

#birthday suit enthusiasts

**AHSWeeknd** (10): En Ess Eff Double You

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Deserved to be one of the fifty streaming hits off the album.

**fairytalehigh** (10): me whenever i hear this song

**oscarbrierley1** (10): my true 11 but lots of people don't like it so i won't waste it, its so fun and danceable

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): obsessed

**vayyiqra** (10): Another bop! This album is so fun.

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): im down

**buzzyrecky** (9.5): honestly an underrated bop

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): it's an underrated bop that deserves a lot of praise

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): She's so enticing and making the most out of the playful energy she just thrives in when she's using that type of baby voice. The sample is magic

**iniekcja\_** (9): does the jigsaw line imply vore tendencies? I guess we'll never know

**welcome2thejam** (9): Great beat on this, a real mover. Doja's been a blast to listen to on these opening two tracks

**you2009** (9): I'll admit the mental visual this gave me swayed my score a bit I'd say sorry for being a lesbian but the world never apologized for turning me into one

**shipperondeck** (8.8): feels like a continuation of woman, similar feel and i mean that in a good way. i'm a novice when it comes to these things but whatever that high humming sound playing in the background is during the verses and refrain, it's my fav thing about the whole song. outro feels kind of thrown on though

**darjeelingdarkroast** (8.5): I forgot that this song is really great! Good production with handclaps and bassline, omg!

**nooodisaster** (8.5): You know what, she has a point

**TiltControls** (8.5): Oh this is fun

**DirtyRat583** (8.2): all hail queen doja

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Honestly just a really fun song.

**dropthehammer11** (8): the way she tows the line between pop and rap is exquisite

**imbaby122** (8): there’s a party in my pants! so yummy! so yummy yummy!

**jsonphile** (8): me when I shower 👀

**pig-serpent** (8): A while ago Lana Del Rey complained about songs about being naked, and I thought that was a weird comment because I couldn't think of any sex songs that were primarily about the feeling of being naked.  That's why I consider this a LDR diss track.

**waluigiest** (8): Hot in Herre (Doja’s Version)

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): This was really fun, but I just want it to finish so I can listen to Woman again...

**Iris3271** (7.5): Would've been higher if not for muscleses

**modulum83** (7.2): this is exactly the same as the first song

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**Lipe18090** (7): this album is gonna be hard to rank cause i listened to some tracks only once.

**ormysonormysonormys** (7): underrated

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): OK, we get it. You’re horny.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): it walks a fine line between sensual and overtly (for doja's standards) sexual and never crosses into raunchy for a song with that title

**NFLfreak98** (6.9): I know this looks like a meme but this is really about right

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.9): if this was a little bit more polished i think it would’ve been a really good song

**akanewasright** (6.7): This production is really good… but I kinda can take or leave the hook :soobcry:

#PURITANS. possibly anti-birthday suits

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): this just drags so long also the way she says nsfw is the opposite of sexy

**RandomHypnotica** (6.4): i mean you can do it whenever, you just might get arrested

**jman457** (6.3): a fine song

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why aren’t the vocals are energized as the beat, girl they’re giving you everything!

**IIIHenryIII** (6): too much hornyness

**jasannn** (6): It’s a More Life cut

**shhhneak** (6): why does this sound like a song from a straight-to-VHS Jungle Book movie?

**Stryxen** (6): people died during the verses but people… survived the chorus

**Uberpigeon** (6): ava outsold

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A bit boring but also my fetish… I’m conflicted

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (5): Its fine yknow? Its fine

**frogaranaman** (5): girl I am in the bath rn what do you think I am

**rotating3Dtext** (5): it never ends

**runaway3212** (5): Doja can be incredibly sexy but she’s honestly not here

**slimboyfriend** (5): I was uninterested until she started rapping

**thedoctordances1940** (4.3): it's never a good sign when ava max has a song with the same name that's 10 times better

**Alumineous** (3): The bridge was dope, but everything else was okay.

**ebooks #5454** (3): lets stay clothed now

The roar that opens this is my favourite musical moment of 2021. As a bonus, it comes with a whole song attached to it! And that song is also pretty great. This song is such a cool moment. While Billie says 'fuck you' to _unnamedguy1_ in a lot of different ways on this album, the way she says it here feels so powerful. She really makes herself seem so much more powerful than this random dude, it feels like a genuine cathartic moment.

#same number

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Me when in the All Stars rate having to rate the same song again

**akanewasright** (10): “and your best friend *tooooooo*” is a 10 by itself

**Awkward\_King** (10): the growls coming off of getting older is definitely one of the most juxtaposing musical moments of last year but also one of my favourites, and then the way they are interpolated throughout the song is the cherry on top. sidenote the "and your best friend *tOoOoOo*" is such brilliant delivery

**cremeebrulee** (10): billie please respond to my texts

**iniekcja\_** (10): ok I have to admit I hardly remember this album but I might've underscored it when it came out wow

**jman457** (10): Just an immaculately produced song. Almost Avey Tare in its vibe

**joeeswift** (10): my dog HATES the beginning, she would give the song a 0

**RandomHypnotica** (10): https://i.imgur.com/NHBBnxc.png

**runaway3212** (10): the way she says “and your best friend too” people fucking died

**you2009** (9.7): the growling sound bites

**just\_thonking** (9): Well I did

**MrMoodle** (9): Someone in the Fantano comment section (yeah yeah I know go fuck yourself) pointed out that the stuttering beat at the end sounds like the grating tone of a phone incessantly vibrating on a table, which I thought was pretty clever.

**ormysonormysonormys** (9): the first two songs set a great tone for the album

**plastichaxan** (9): oh i was hooked from that very first second

**seanderlust** (9): get his ass billie. the fuzzy instrumentals REALLY add to the ambience. special shoutout to her coy "and your best friend, too"

**modulum83** (8.9): leave it to billie eilish to write a song about not changing her number. what's next, "I Didn't File My Taxes"?

**relibee2** (8.7): why do I kinda wanna change my number now?

**shipperondeck** (8.7): the dog snarl at the beginning scared the SHIT out of me when i first heard this lmao. besides that i love this song. it's secretive/elusive, and around 2mins those synths adds to the tension

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): Billie can I pet your dog

**imbaby122** (8.5): and ya best friend teuuuuuu 😆🤔🖕😉‼️

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.5): glitchy breakdown towards the end was cool

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): queen of jump scares and herky jerky outros

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): The instrumental to this makes me feel like I’m in a baseball stadium. But like a more fabulous baseball stadium.

**CreepyMannequin** (8): This message of this song is everything.

**fairytalehigh** (8): me to an old high school friend when she asked how to reach me

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): This beat slaps omfg

**pig-serpent** (8): I love the way the synths on this song pusle in and out.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): FINNEAS went crazy on this one.

**ReallyCreative** (8): she really sampled the 30-50 feral hogs that run into my yard within 3-5 mins while my small kids play omg

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (8): my personal favorite of the "sexy/sassy billie" side of this album

**waluigiest** (8): not to be blasphemous but the way she says “and your best friend too” is almost amy winehouse-esque

**BasedButta** (7.5): give me those fucked up electronic sounds the whole song and im set

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Fiona x Billie x TXT are the masters of incorporating dog noises into their music!

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): Fiona has dolphin noises, Billie has dog noises and Rihanna has no noises

**TiltControls** (7.5): Come on Wii shop channel

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): it is pretty fine

**dropthehammer11** (7): samsung ringtone circa 2009 beat but its good

**emmaelf** (7): love the lyrics and moments of the song live up to them but not a fan of that outro

**frogaranaman** (7): the outro synth on this song is one of those insane production moments that I wish I could hear for the first time again

**Iris3271** (7): Wasn't sure about the ending

**nooodisaster** (7): always listen to drew, boo

**shhhneak** (7): This has Wendy Williams energy no I won’t explain.

**Stryxen** (7): bark bark woof

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): the production SLAPS

**UselessTacooo** (7): DOGGY

**Lipe18090** (6.9): good but repetitive and weak chorus

**CrimsonROSET** (6.5): throwback to when i didn’t reply to texts for two weeks while on vacation and people straight up thought i died

**static\_int\_husp** (6.5): overall kinda boring but the glitchy stuf near the end is cool

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): I’d sooner believe that didn’t change my number made him shut his mouth if there were anything interesting here beyond the outro

#they did change it actually!

**1998tweety** (6): this would be a 9 due to the production but that awful awful snarling drags the whole song down. I promise you don't need to add a weird element to a song to make it quirky.

**ebooks #5454** (6): not the dogs barking in the beginning

**IIIHenryIII** (6): good 4 u

**MassiveThief** (6): the kinda song that's nice when listening to the full album but too boring to stand on its own

**vayyiqra** (6): Wow, that intro was jarring, and the outro kind of is too. I like that little electric organ loop though.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): A bit boring but it could be worse

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): the melody just doesn't flow

**QuaxlyDuck** (5): I think Billie accidentally stepped on a little crocodile at the beginning of the song

**welcome2thejam** (5): Cool cool cool, love getting jumpscared on purpose

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): god those noises at the end of the song sound so out of time and misplaced. knocked a lot of points off what was otherwise a good song

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (3): Some… strange production choices, and also kinda boring… if that makes sense.

**CarlieScion** (3): both annoying vocals and instrumental

Lil Nas X continues the tradition set by Pink Floyd's _The Wall_ and instead of building a literal wall around himself, he sees himself on an island. However, it has the same energy of isolating yourself from others. It's short but in the short time it really describes his desperation and the loneliness he feels, while still feeling he cannot go back home.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): songs about people finding out people can be multifaceted are always ??? for me

**DefaultPophead** (7): This is cute, but kinda generic. I'm not sure. It's just not a stand out.

**jasannn** (7): another song where his singing voice kinda distracts me thus bringing it down

**modulum83** (7): sadboy hours are officially in

This is my favourite reflection on fame on this album. It's a very harsh judgement on people in his past, but it feels really satisfying. He knows his own worth and he really isn't scared to be a little bit braggadocios about it. However, the song makes this sound earned which is a big accomplishment. His vocal performance here is also great.

---

#dead rn (at how good the song is)

**AHSWeeknd** (10): shocked to see a near 4 minute track on this album

**Alumineous** (10): Wow. Lyrics. The real ones will still like you even when you’re a flop. Unless you’re Lorde. Or Katy.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): hot

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me after waking up at 6am 3 days in a row for rate reveals

**seanderlust** (10): I think one of the things that really surprised me about this album was how introspective and confessional it was

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): god it really does pain me to not be able to give this an 11, easily one of my favorite songs of last year

**UselessTacooo** (10): The triumphant horns with the strong trap beat is an incredible combination that makes the album. 11 contender

**you2009** (10): HALLE BERRY....OR HALLELUJAH

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I think of the non singles this is one of my favorites. Love the storytelling and the bluntness about people trying to connect with him after he got famous even when they didn’t treat well or were never his friends. The mom lines are brutal , and I think that this song definitely proves that lil nas x can do more serious stuff

**nooodisaster** (9.5): Love how confessional this is with the brutal production. Reminding us he is a rapper & will air ALL the dirty laundry.

**cremeebrulee** (9.2): hopefully doja’s album by the time this goes out

**fairytalehigh** (9): margaret thatcher be like

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): don't see many people mention this track when talking about Montero but it's one of my faves!

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (9): Lil Nas had the absolute balls to make a diss track about his own parents the second track on his debut album, and it slaps.

**runaway3212** (9): lyrically this is whatever but sonically this sounds so nice

**vayyiqra** (9): I really like the synthy sound of this and how blunt and honest his lyrics are.

**waluigiest** (9): HALLELUJAH. HOW’D YOU DO IT?

**akanewasright** (8.6): Me throwing ass as Lil Nas is talking about his troubled relationship with his mom

**imbaby122** (8.5): i really love lil nas’ delivery in this song. one might say he understood the assignment.

**shipperondeck** (8.2): he gets really vulnerable so early in the album and i so respect that. despite the vulnerability there's strength behind his delivery and words which is quite inspiring and touching tbh

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): a decent track

**babadork** (8): I really like the first two verses, and I think his father sounds great in that final chorus.

**emmaelf** (8): the flow is so good. lnx you're the man.

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): This song is so catchy to me

**ImADudeDuh** (8): betty white on new years

**MrMoodle** (8): This kind of has Donkey Kong vibes, it doesn’t really sound the same but I feel like it could be adjusted slightly and slot perfectly into the Donkey Kong Country soundtrack, idk if I’m hallucinating that

**ReallyCreative** (8): Todrick Hall's career

**TiltControls** (8): rate ballot intake during the mid-month drought period

**modulum83** (7.8): that take a daytrip production so clean

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): The gospel singing at the end really elevates this one.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): fuck people who only care about fame, even if they’re family

**frogaranaman** (7): me when playing Halo or something idk laugh please

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): i love being moody

**welcome2thejam** (7): Could definitely tell how personal this is for him

#dead rn (at how much they dislike the song)

**iniekcja\_** (6.5): attempted sadness

**jman457** (6.5): its alright

**ktajlili** (6): This song kicks off the album's personal narrative. I am impressed that he was able to flesh out his personal journey so well. Although this isn't my favorite song, lines like "I wanted fame / and I wanted riches / wanted happiness / wanted forgiveness" really set the album apart from other pop releases.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (6): it gets two whole points for the hallelujah harmonies

**thedoctordances1940** (5.6): just so mid

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5.5): It feels weird to say this about a Lil Nas X song…but this goes on a little too long.

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): glad you made it, but this is so mournful and lifeless (that was the point, I think)

**pig-serpent** (5.5): This song feels like it's really close to being this huge Sci-Fi epic but it never quite reaches it nor does it hit the somberness it's more interested in exploring.

**DefaultPophead** (5): After CMBYN, this song feels like it's 6 minutes long. And not in a good way (I liked Impossible Soul)...

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): A very slow, droning dirge that looks even worse surrounded by the album’s best tracks

**Awkward\_King** (4): im kinda meh on this song as it is, but i think it also kills a lot of possible momentum from the surrounding string of opening tracks on the album

On the one hand, this song is really boppy. On the other hand, I don't think I was the only one disappointed when this dropped. While overall pretty good, it was not yet showing the insane high quality that we would later get with "CALL ME BY YOUR NAME" and "INDUSTRY BABY." It was a small hit, but I wasn't surprised that it didn't really take off at the time.

Looking back on it now, it seems to me that this track was merely the label testing the waters, seeing if there was still any interest in Lil Nas X once the hype of "Old Town Road" died down. After seeing that indeed this hype was there, he got a bigger budget and more freedom to make something truly special. It's a bit of a transition in that way. Looking at it now, that's still how I feel, clearly good but also clearly a transition towards bigger things.

#I'm sorry, have you SEEN Santa Claus?

**slimboyfriend** (6): wait why is he singing about bottoming in a Christmas song

---

#bottom on the low

**akanewasright** (10): I keep thinking I don’t love this song until I hear the beat hit and start screaming “even if I started flopping it’d be fashion”

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): A BOP if I’ve ever heard one. I’m kinda disappointed that it wasn’t on the album, but it doesn’t really fit, so it’s fine.

**bigbigbee** (10): “HEE HEE…” me to my friends constantly back when this song was released

**celladonn** (10): This didn't get the attention it should have, absolute banger

**mysario** (10): thank you unnamed holiday, gonna use this to grind on some poles for Flag Day

**plastichaxan** (10): BOP

**runaway3212** (10): I wish this song was a hit tbh

**xavieryes** (10): should top the charts in about a decade and a half

**jackisboredtoday** (9.4): this was such a grower for me, it just snuck up on me with every listen until I suddenly had it in my top 25 for 2020. LOVE that combined producer tag too

**ignitethephoenix** (9): festive bop

**jaztinax** (9): this has no christmas vibes but it’s still somehow the best christmas song of the 2020s

**jsonphile** (9): my only wish is that it was more of a actual holiday song, but without the music video it doesn’t really have anything Christmassy

**racloves** (9): wish I had hoes on hoes

**1998tweety** (8.5): bop, this was his first song i liked nnn

**shipperondeck** (8.2): ok so the mj line is hysterical. but we all agree that "i can't even close my eyes" (life after salem) sounds too much like "i could be your part time lover" though right

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): some of these lyrics are a bit cringy, "Hee hee I'm bad as Michael Jackson" is objectively very bad, but this is still a fun bop

**modulum83** (8): this is just lil nas x being extremely disrespectful for two and a half minutes and i love it lmao

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): being a stan of this song pre-cmbyn era was so hard you have no idea how angry i got seeing people’s reaction to this essentially boiling down to “yeah hes still a one hit wonder” well guess what fuckers! who was right all along!

**welcome2thejam** (8): Afraid I'm making an absolutely bewildering connection here, but the "I can't even close my eyes" bit in the chorus sounds a lot like the chorus's ending of The Steel Samurai theme from the Ace Attorney games

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): DUN DUN DUN

**seanderlust** (7): "I might bottom on the low but I top shit" PLSSS

**vayyiqra** (7): lol what is this

**jman457** (6.7): not as good as Mariah Carey sorry

**RandomHypnotica** (6.5): it's fine... but i'm glad we have montero now

#only top shit

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): boo-ring!

**frogaranaman** (6): Glad to have power bottom representation out in this world now.

**iniekcja\_** (6): no wonder I hate christmas

**TiltControls** (6): it's fine, but nothing special

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I thought this was kinda meh the first time I heard it tbh

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (5): it's really good but it's also braggadocio. they're not mutually exclusive, but is it good braggadocio? that's up for interpretation

**babadork** (4.5): I tried really hard to like this when it came out.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): can this dude even make a song longer than 4 minutes

**imbaby122** (4): whoever moved lil nas x away from this direction thank you 🙏 bc this is a bore

**wasian-invasion** (4): why was this the first thing he released after 7

**AzettImpa** (3): no. he really missed with this one, thank god it's not on the album

And now for the most controversial song in the entire rate. This song had a lot of haters and a lot of lovers. The haters say they find the song annoying, obnoxious and manufactured. The lovers say it's catchy, has funny lines and love her flow. The controversy is probably increased by how big of a hit this became. Meaning that it either grew on people or grew even more off people.

Personal opinion: I think this song is a lot of fun, I get why some people didn't like it though.

---

#NEEDS to know

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Dr shit can suck a fuck but this is beyond a bop

**Alumineous** (10): I've been hating on Doja a lot, so this is a nice break. I don't like the "I don't care that you have a wife" shit, but it's in the perspective of a fantasy so I guess it's okay.

**Awkward\_King** (10): fuck hypno this song is so good

**fadedblue09** (10): Found this generic at first but it grew on me a lot

**ignitethephoenix** (10): honestly I think this is the best song on the album, her flow is amazing (especially in that second verse, honestly the best thing she’s done). The hook is super solid too, it’s such a tragedy it’s a Dr L*ke track

**jsonphile** (10): I heard from a friend of a friend that this song was a 10/10

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): I heard from a friend of a friend, that that song was a ten out of ten

**MrMoodle** (10): Tbh I thought this was mid at first, but the video’s vibes are so fucking sick and match perfectly with the song. I feel like visuals shouldn’t come into play when rating a song but they’ve impacted my perception of this so much, even when listened to in isolation. I desperately want more artists doing the yassified cyberpunk alien aesthetic.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): “OK, we get it. You’re horny.” But better.

**racloves** (10): she ate! Licked the plate clean no crumbs left !

**ricki** (10): slay

**runaway3212** (10): Is this song good? Maybe not but i dont give a fuck it’s a 10

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): best MV of 2021 i said what i said

**UselessTacooo** (10): These are some of Doja’s best moments lyrically. Sometimes she just cannot be beat

**vayyiqra** (10): This is ambient somehow don't ask me to justify this it just is

**xavieryes** (10): just like that dick, this song is a 10/10

**you2009** (10): grown woman music it's not doja's fault she's in a rate with 3 young adult novel protagonists

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): it simply goes dumb as fuck and there's nothing i can do about it

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9.5): Great to karaoke to on my room with approximately 5% the success of Doja's persona. Anyway she's a big power bottom inspiration here

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): she served, yet again although Dr. Luke needs to disappear

**fairytalehigh** (9): this song has burrowed deep into my brain, YEA-EYEAH, NEED TO KNOW-WOW

**FroyoFox\_125** (9): What a banger!

**just\_thonking** (9): I'm on a need to know basis. Yeah, no one tells me shit, unless I need to hear it

**pig-serpent** (9): Favorite hook from the album, and some nice synth work.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): my local radio station censors out the "spank me slap me choke me" but leaves the "bite me"

**Lipe18090** (8.4): certified bop

**shipperondeck** (8.4): i forgot how funny the lyrics/delivery are in this one?? all the echoey singing/moaning lmao really helps with the spacey vibe on this one. but seriously i forgot how fun this song is

**CrimsonROSET** (8): i can’t be mad at ‘pussy like an alakazam’

**hikkaru** (8): the ominous production works really well and i have no choice but to appreciate POOF PUSSY LIKE AN ALAKAZAM I HEARD FROM A FRIEND OF A FRIEND THAT THAT DICK WAS A 10 OUT OF 10

**jaztinax** (8): a little overrated but still good

**jman457** (8): I can see why this why this was a huge hit

**qazz23** (8): nice spacey beat

**1998tweety** (7.5): hated this at first but it grew

**BasedButta** (7.5): dont think this is anything special but it stands out by being catchy

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7.5): sounds familiar but I can't tell why

**TiltControls** (7.5): Doja kills it here, but there's nothing special about the song otherwise

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this grew tbh...luke knows which songs to pretend he worked on!

**akanewasright** (7): I have to be in a pretty specific mood for this to hit, but like… if you’re at a party this goes the fuck off, I don’t make the rules

**plastichaxan** (7): that bridge… chef’s kiss

**modulum83** (6.7): the thing with doja cat is that she is best when she reels it back just a little bit. this is too much doja. this is like trying to get a little bit of dressing on your salad and accidentally pouring out the entire bottle

**Iris3271** (6.5): For every part I liked there was something I really didn't

#doesn't need to know

**IIIHenryIII** (6): what a lazy chorus

**welcome2thejam** (6): Know what turns me on? References to Charles Entertainment Cheese on my sex track

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): ok so i have kinda an awkward story with this one. so picture this: im taking a uber to work because i dont have my license and the dude who picks me up is this 50 something year old white guy. now i guess he changes the radio station in his car to whatever music channel he thinks his passenger will like best, so he looks at me, tiny 20 year old white girl, and assumes that i’m probably going to like the hip hop radio station the most. anyway so this song comes on on the drive to work and i can tell just by looking at this poor driver’s face that he absolutely hates this song and is regretting putting this channel on, and i’m too shy and nervous to have the heart to tell him that i dont even really like this song that much and he can change the channel if he wants. and so for 3 and a half agonizing minutes, i’m just sitting silently in this car watching an old guy contemplate his life’s decisions all because of need to know by doja cat. so whenever i hear this song i just think of that guy. id say i hope hes doing alright but tbh he looked like a republican so i hope he chokes actually

**nooodisaster** (5): The moment you realize an album called "Planet Her" is a cheaters album.

**nootnoot781** (5): okay but the production is horrid on this

**seanderlust** (5): gotta love when dr luke produces something and it is mediocre so i don't have to work too hard to boycott it

**Uberpigeon** (5): this sounds like a demo

**waluigiest** (5): something about it is unsettling

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): On an album full of catchy chorus hooks, this is definitely among the most boring of them. “Spank me, slap me, choke me, bite me” is such a lazy attempt at sounding kinky too, like Doja you’re more clever than that!

**ebooks #5454** (3): that dick may be a 10 outta 10 but this song ain't

**imbaby122** (3): IM SORRY IM SORRY i’m just not giving a dr. luke song a good score. i can see why this is a fan fav tho. i listened to this song once for the rate but i think i already knew the whole song from tiktok alone. doja’s verses stay on the brain.

**RandomHypnotica** (3): the bridge is the only saving grace here... everything else is painfully obnoxious

**Stryxen** (3): it just feels so … manufactured?? I can’t describe it but there’s so much nothing here that its boring. and annoying (the random erection verse makes up all 3 points)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): This song simultaneously has way too much going on and also no real personality. An absolute menace on pop radio too.

**frogaranaman** (0): this is the only song in the rate where I feel an active annoyance listening to it. sorry!

**jackisboredtoday** (0): One of my least favorite singles of the year, I hate that this took off so much, it was mid on first listen and just grew off me with subsequent listens

akanewasright: > modulum83 (6.7): the thing with doja cat is that she is best when she reels it back just a little bit. this is too much doja. this is like trying to get a little bit of dressing on your salad and accidentally pouring out the entire bottle

Interestingly, I completely disagree. I think Doja works best when she goes unhinged and the songs on planet her where she reels it in, I think she sacrificed what made her special.

Imagine growing up, Peter Pan would never. This track is so amazing as an opener. It's a quiet reflection on Billie's mental state and she really knows how to pack a punch in without being loud. There's a lot to love here, but I especially love the last verse and how it transitions into "I Didn't Change My Number." The line 'I'm happier than ever, at least that's my endavour' is one of the best on the entire album.

---

#aging well

**Awkward\_King** (11): i can't really explain why this song means as much to me as it does, i haven't been through a lot of what billie sings about, it is just extremely comforting. this is on my anxiety playlist and one of the songs i use most from it, i think the very unchanging piano in the background is a lovely constant, and the way it is written is perfect to me

**rtm416** (11): I made this my 11 after realizing on repeat listens I always look forward to this over the title track. Last second call.

**akanewasright** (10): me when I turn 20 and have a crisis and change my major a third time in a year

**Alumineous** (10): Things I enjoyed only keep me employed. When your passions become work, yeah I get that.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): “Things I once enjoyed, just keep me employed now.” I’m a puddle of feelings on the floor.

**jackisboredtoday** (10): A perfect song even though its very funny hearing the line “I think I’m aging well” at the age Billie is describing

**joeeswift** (10): kinda heartbreaking…

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this is ribs for gen z

**ricki** (10): i can't stand her

**skargardin** (10): I REALLY enjoy this as a soft, poignant intro to the album

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (10): best lyrics

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I'm just gonna pretend I don't relate to this one a lot

**TiltControls** (10): had this as my 11 for a brief moment but HTE was too good to pass up. Still, hoping this makes it far. I've never connected a ton to Billie's quieter stuff, but this just hits in all the right spots

**UselessTacooo** (10): a perfect way to open an incredible album

**vayyiqra** (10): Reading the lyrics really changed my feelings on this song - as one of the older Popheads regulars and struggling with boredom and emptiness as the last two years have been, this kind of hit me on a personal level in more than one way.

**waluigiest** (10): shortly after this album came out I put it on and listened to this song ~5 times in a row before I noticed it was on loop

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): A fantastic opener to an album. Gives you a great taste test for what's to come. The perfect combination of devastating and hopeful.

**jman457** (9.2): Ok this hits a bit too close to home how capitalism drains our passion away

**modulum83** (9.1): this song is unfathomably haunting and depressing and it's the first fucking thing you hear on this album

**AHSWeeknd** (9): A good opener

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): absolutely relatable and it scares me a lot

**celladonn** (9): Gorgeous and a bit chilling

**fadedblue09** (9): Haunting, moodsetting intro

**jaztinax** (9): there are so many lines from this song that just hit really hard

**just\_thonking** (9): This works so well as an opener because she is basically signposting, "I am going to be vulnerable on this album"

**N454545** (9): someone here said it sound it like a tiktok sad boy song and that ruined it a little but i dont care

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (9): What does it mean for me if getting older means I’M the one who’s usually deranged?

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): i knew from the second i heard the synth in the background that i was going to dig this album

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): I wish I wasn’t though

**MrMoodle** (8.5): I like the pause after “too bad they’re usually deranged”. Pretty bleak reality but the delivery is still sort of comical, feels like it could be followed by a record scratch.

**plastichaxan** (8.5): imagine how tired we are imagine how tired we are

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): Billie baby you're 20, make your own doctor's appointments and get back to me

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I’m turning 26 this month and this is what I think about it

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I can imagine that after a certain age growing older becomes less and less fun

**CrimsonROSET** (8): you know i did not need this call out to start out the rate with

**ebooks #5454** (8): creme said this is just Billie's 'Ribs'

**emmaelf** (8): that bass immediately kicked me into gear and i loved when it momentarily dropped out and kept my attention two mins in

**frogaranaman** (8): when Lorde couldn’t deliver on the promise of reflecting where we were at in life with *Solar Power*, Billie Eilish fulfilled it with this song specifically

**iniekcja\_** (8): me with my premature rheumatism

**nooodisaster** (8): A great intro to this project. Lyrically this is so clear and just gut-punch after gut-punch. Miss Eyelash pulls no punches. While I don't often go back to this track, it works perfectly as track 1, setting the scene for what Billie has gone through, her emotional state, literally name dropping the album name, and Finneas' production lulls us into the incoming rollercoaster.

**runaway3212** (8): this is a cute opener but I wish it did more

**you2009** (8): I don't care about lyrics but when they're good they're great. sparse production works really well too and I love the long notes she sings

**seanderlust** (7.6): understated but gorgeous. she sounds so vulnerable and honest here

**1998tweety** (7.5): nice opener

**imbaby122** (7.5): i’m unemployed and i still relate to this song. the workforce is gonna be such a reality check 😐

**Iris3271** (7.5): I really felt those lyrics

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): Love the chorus and lyrics but the production makes the song drag a bit

**jasannn** (7.2): I like this more as a poem than a song

**sparklesandlight** (7.2): I have tears same queen

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): Way too much build-up for it to never actually pick up, but lyrically, it’s quite good.

**bookthieving** (7): zoomers dni

**FroyoFox\_125** (7): Very chill opener

**ignitethephoenix** (7): I really enjoy the lyrics here but like as a whole package, it’s not as gripping as it could be

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I got older just listening to this

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): :(((

#aging badly

**shipperondeck** (6.5): works good as an opener but it's like almost too lowkey/simple for me idk. as a song by itself it does almost nothing for me

**CarlieScion** (6): the mumbling way she sings combined with how low the vocals are in the mix is why i think billie deserves the whisper-label more than selena

**dropthehammer11** (6): its a fine opener but nothing crazy imo

**pig-serpent** (6): It's a cute little song to open with.  It would be pretty underwhleming anywhere else on the album though, and most of the rest of the songs here do a lot more.

**QuaxlyDuck** (6): sounds like if Billie Eilish whisper sang in the style of those indie-singer songwriter songs from the late 00s (you know the kitsch ones that involve buttons and bows and sock puppets and things, reminiscing on innocence and youth)

**Stryxen** (6): it’s grown on me a bit

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): it's a nice opener

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): It’s half good, but also half boring…I don’t know :/

**CreepyMannequin** (5.5): Doesn’t stand out much to me.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz...

**static\_int\_husp** (4): My mom hates Billie Eilish and I think it's because she thinks all her music is boring shit like this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): this is reaching alanis morisette levels of not knowing what ironic means

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (2): i'm no where near interested enough in billie to think this monotone 4 minute song is interesting

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (2): i feel like i aged 4 years in 4 minutes that’s how bored i got listening to this

**Humble-Ad-1628** (1): kinda boring

We need more hymn hits!!

I actually expected this song to a lot worse, since the first half comes dangerously close to a ballad. However (luckily), this sub can recognize good music sometimes. The way the intro is sampled in the second half is also really incredible and the structure of the song is pretty unique in today's pop landscape. I really hope more songs in the future will be inspired by this, both by having a hymn incorporated in it and in how it samples itself in the latter half of the song.

---

#hymn fans

**hellabender** (11): really unique and creative premises. starts out with this beautiful and ethereal hymn that morphs into a sly condemnation of how the music industry treats women.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The transition from the church song to the beat is beyond

**akanewasright** (10): there’s something really emotionally interesting to me about songs where the singer warns someone to get the hell away from the business. Like… singing about wanting someone else to learn from your mistakes or whatever is just an easy trick to getting me to love your song

**Alumineous** (10): The first part was just so beautiful and ethereal and the switchup was just so perfectly executed. Might I say too short.

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (10): Madonna - Nothing Really Matters anyone?

**dropthehammer11** (10): hearing a major pop artist make a song like this is honestly amazing. beautifully haunting

**MrMoodle** (10): Tbh this does the “peaceful start to boppy latter half” better than HTE, the “down down, da da down down, da da down down” hook is pure bliss

**pig-serpent** (10): Heavenly harmonies into an infectious bass rhythm.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): put the orchestral disney plus version on streaming!!!

**shhhneak** (10): The intro is so beautiful. Billie needs to do an orchestral classic Christmas album.

**UselessTacooo** (10): The choir mixed with the big hoppy drums was such a good choice.

**waluigiest** (10): sublime simply sublime

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): This would be a 10 if it was just a little longer.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9.5): should be longer

**jman457** (9.3): The Beat switch on this is immaculate

**seanderlust** (9.3): the chorus at the beginning consistently gives me chills

**emayzee** (9.2): it took me until this rate to realize how good this song is

**shipperondeck** (9.1): the title of this is perfect and i love angelic sounding songs about this topic (e.g. hey big eyes by caroline polachek). i just wish it were a bit longer

**Awkward\_King** (9): one of my favourites of the kinda double sided songs on the album, the switchup from heavenly singing to the drop is insane

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (9): The choral effects in this song are cool.

**xavieryes** (9): I love songs that feel all over the place

**you2009** (8.7): looooove when vocals are used for production stylings also this was the song that was playing in the church in spiderman 3 when eddie brock was praying on peter parker's downfall before he even knew he was spiderman. would like if it were a bit longer

**ReallyCreative** (8.6): what reason did she have cutting this short

**fairytalehigh** (8.5): kinda reminds of me of fka twigs but not in an overly derivative way

**FroyoFox\_125** (8.5): Always thought the hymnal intro into the beat was cool

**Lipe18090** (8.5): the first part is 20/10 but the rest is just ok

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): One time I listened to this album after taking an edible and when the transition hit I was convinced I’d entered an alternate reality.

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): arent they a hockey team???

**cremeebrulee** (8.2): the way this song is prettier than most people

**1998tweety** (8): goldwig

**bigbigbee** (8): love the Catholic Church Music moment at the beginning of this

**DefaultPophead** (8): If Billie Bossa Nova made me feel like the sexy love interest of the side character in a spy romance trilogy's second book, and Oxytocin made me feel like I am the main character of the whole series, then Goldwing makes me feel like the main villain's assistant of the final book that manages to vanish without a trace after the villain is killed (but not without pocketing all of their secrets and money, first).

**ktajlili** (8): UNDERRATED

**N454545** (8): i wish it was longer

**racloves** (8): got a new appreciation for this song after watching her D+ concert film

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Please Billie I am begging you please release a choral album it would be beautiful I promise

**modulum83** (7.8): this song is so fucking weird and i love it for that. what is a idm song that samples a choral hymn doing here.

**BasedButta** (7.5): good but it doesnt have enough time to get going! maybe because it has a short runtime or because it takes too much time doing nothing at the start idk

**fadedblue09** (7.5): Love the beats but doesn't really love much of an impression

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): i thought these were two songs (edit: three)

**nlh1013** (7.5): but I could do without the operatic beginning

**plastichaxan** (7.5): okay billie we need to address the starting a song being boring as fuck to switch it into a great one cause wtf is that about i want to enjoy the whole thing

**runaway3212** (7.5): how come we had a sea shanty hit in 2021 but not a fucking hymn I hate it here

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): pretty fine, not my cup of tea though

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): Billie was evil for only making this 2 and a half minutes long

**emmaelf** (7): i think by this point i'm getting a bit done with the first half and second half of billie's songs just being different songs. it is a great second half though.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): how can she take us to church after the previous track?

**imbaby122** (7): children’s choirs r booked and busy these days

**sufjancaesar** (7): Ok but the opening is fucking ethereal Billie we need more

**TiltControls** (7): I like that sound effect in the background, but I wish there was something more to the song

#hymn HATERS, maybe anti-church

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (6): I’m confused, but like… also kinda bopping?

**CrimsonROSET** (6): wait do you people resell souvenirs

**QuaxlyDuck** (6): Ms Eilish really likes her diptich songs

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): hate the first part but love the second so this score is fitting

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): Billie Eilish Has Become Christian

**vayyiqra** (6): Kind of dark-sounding which is cool but feels too short.

**welcome2thejam** (6): Found out during research that Billie posted what color she related with each song off this album, and guys, you will never guess what color she picked for Goldwing

**thedoctordances1940** (5.4): :midaf:

**CarlieScion** (5): u will never be fka twigs

**Iris3271** (5): Sunday mass meets Glee

**majid** (5): i'm bopping a little, there's nothing particularly interesting though

**musical\_pyn** (4): beginning is really beautiful but the rest is just not fun to listen to

**DevilsOfLoudun** (3): I know some love this song but honestly what even is this??? pretty choir at the beginning doesn't change the fact that it's complete nonsense as a song.

**MassiveThief** (3): I feel like this song was made solely for the beat transition, cuz nothing else is interesting

**nooodisaster** (3): First head sounds like something even Halsey would find too pretentious, second part sounds like a first-take improvise that shoulda stayed in drafts.

**DirtyRat583** (1.8): i almost stopped doing the rate because of this song. im all for beat switchups so long as both beats are good and the beginning is just not good, like REALLY not good. in fact its not a beat its literally just a chorus of billies - no thank u try again billie & finneas

This is a single that I think works much better in the context of the album. When I first heard it, I thought 'oh this is a little bit cute' and then I forgot about it for like 2 months. But when I heard it on the album, I was super impressed by it. A song looking forward to her future has more impact when you know how shitty her past was. The second half where it picks up speed is also really catchy. The second chorus has been stuck in my head for the past few days. It's really a testament to the album quality how much better it makes most if not all of the singles.

#jazz fans

**N454545** (11): It's fun to sing at 11 pm

**sufjancaesar** (11): My favourite sound for Billie - jazzy, lo-fi and soft in a way that celebrates her vocals; Love how it builds into the beat and the track feels nostalgic but also v unique? A full Billie album in this style would be fire, this is my favourite song she’s released

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I never listened to this when it was initially released but God it’s so good

**akanewasright** (10): I really do love the soul influences on the song. This is really such a lovely place for her vocally

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): releasing this near the beginning of the pandemic was a choice but it's really good so I'm not gonna complain, plus honestly who cares

**CrimsonROSET** (10): love that for you

**emayzee** (10): the part at 2:24 when the drums briefly pause during "then to drive you..." and immediately come back on "home" is a highlight of the album for me and a part i always look forward to

**jsonphile** (10): really under appreciated. One of the most interesting chord progressions you’ll hear in modern music, powerful lyrics, and amazing singing from Billie

**skargardin** (10): I kind of despised this when it came out, but I've come around to fully loving it

**static\_int\_husp** (10): "I'm in love with my future, can't wait to meet her" has basically been my mantra for the past year as I started my gender transition. It's kinda comforting to think about, and has gotten me through some tough times.

**vayyiqra** (10): Beautiful, one of her best songs.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): The first time I heard this on the radio I wasn’t even sure if it WAS Billie. It sounds so lush and warm and so unlike anything from her last album

**wasian-invasion** (10): this is my boyfriend's favorite song of 2020 so extra points

**shhhneak** (9.8): Diet HTE and we’re eating it up!!

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I need to manifest this attitude for myself

**RandomHypnotica** (9.5): my future can't be worse than my present... right?

**fairytalehigh** (9.2): stunning, one of billie's best and i'm glad she kept it for the album

**modulum83** (9.1): glad for billie but personally i am filing a restraining order with my future

**1998tweety** (9): unfortunately this was a bit of a non-event of a lead single

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): because it's an absolutely wonderful song that kicked off the era

**Alumineous** (9): Second half picked up, first half was really calming and gorgeous.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This song hits different in the early morning before work when you’re trying to calm yourself down and not hate life.

**ebooks #5454** (9): "i can't seem to focus" adhd type beat thats a big mood sis!!

**fadedblue09** (9): Very somber, the guitar works well against her voice here

**jman457** (9): My favorite of the lead singles

**nlh1013** (9): but aren’t I someone?

**pleasegivemeasword** (9): this has grown on me a lot

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (9): anyone who hates this song can ROT

**ricki** (8.5): oh to think kindly of the future that awaits you

**DefaultPophead** (8): Absolutely hated this when it first came out, but now I really appreciate it. Gorgeous and mature, but still retains that naivety that keeps it youthful.

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): I still really do enjoy this song even if it's not really single material

**ImADudeDuh** (8): it always sends me when this was seen as her happy song and it sounds like the most depressing song ever

**MrMoodle** (8): Kinda gimmicky, I read the WIkipedia page and it said it was inspired by Michael Buble’s Just Haven’t Met You Yet and I definitely picked up on that lmao. That being said the vibes are pretty immaculate and the MV captures it perfectly.

**pig-serpent** (8): I love where this song goes and I wish there was more of it, either in this song or throughout the rest of the album.

**qazz23** (8): that's a nice beat change

**runaway3212** (8): The early parts of this song I dont really care for but like once it gets upbeat it’s so great

**waluigiest** (8): the texture of this song is lovely!

**you2009** (7.7): will use this comment to say I love her singing so much which elevates a lot of these songs for me. I don't think they could be sung by just anyone she really embodies them no matter how generic they may lean

**jaztinax** (7.5): this was high on my list when it came out but it kinda wore out its effect over time. i really like this sound from billie though

**joeeswift** (7.5): I still see this as a 2020 droplet, not really a standout on an album so strong

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7.5): nondescript initially but it eventually picks up

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): I feel like this song is disconnected from the album, but at least it’s good!

**shipperondeck** (7.2): i love the main concept of this song, mainly bc right now i'm really resonating with it. musically it's alright for me, the switch halfway makes it interesting, but for this one i mainly appreciate it for the lyrics

**Awkward\_King** (7): this song has grown off me a little, it was probably my favourite of the singles beforehand but now i kinda spend the song waiting for the second half, which i still love a lot

**QuaxlyDuck** (7): trend alert: the second half of each track is catchier than the first half

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): i really don't think it needed to be on this album, could've been a standalone single

**CarlieScion** (6.5): first half good, the second half is too mumbly again even tho I like the instrumental

#haters of _La La Land_ (2016, dir. Damien Chazelle)

**celladonn** (6): I just find it a little boring

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): I feel like I could say this same comment for multiple songs on this album - as much as I appreciate the lyrics and the subject matter, it's just a bit boring?

**nooodisaster** (6): when people say billie's music is sleepy maybe they're onto something lol. lyrically i love the sentiment but i would not choose to listen to this.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (6): Droning, Super Slow Ballad Billie is my least favorite Billie.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this is such a weird choice for a lead single…sounds so much more like a deep cut

**xavieryes** (6): it's not even a bad song but it's just plain skippable (the second half helps a lot though)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6): that first half drags on for far too long, but the second half is good

**babadork** (5.4): The Julie London influence really shows in this song, but I think Billie misses the mark. What makes Julie London so special is that she sounds like she’s singing directly to you. Billie mostly sounds like she’s singing this song to herself.

**CreepyMannequin** (5): Doesn’t stand out but her voice is very beautiful on this track!

**emmaelf** (5): first half sounds like it should be in la la land, second half barely makes up for that

**IIIHenryIII** (5): boring as fuck.

**imbaby122** (5): very happy for you billie but your future sounds a little boring. a little blah even.

**majid** (5): this doesn't quite keep my attention but there are some parts that slay

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): not a fan but it's not bad

**xedophobic** (4.5): it does nothing for me im sorry miss eilish

**DevilsOfLoudun** (4): another snoozefest song

**TiltControls** (4): I just wish this had something more to it

**Uberpigeon** (3): im not in love with my future

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (2): I literally tune out before the beat kicks in, so I hardly notice it when it does. Doesn’t help the song too much anyways.

Now for the most robbed song of the entire rate.

I truly cannot believe this is out already. It's soooooo beautiful. It's a reflection that goes really in depth and also just makes so much impact to me. The opening lines have been much discussed but I especially like the final lines. There's such a pressure on victims of abuse to hate their abusers when in reality the situation is often much more complex. Her first saying 'convince myself I hate you' before saying 'I know I should, but I could never hate you' feels like such a real description of the situation. 'Real' is a good adjective to describe this song, it feels deeply personal and completely not manufactured. Should've easily made top 10.

---

#haters of men

**Alumineous** (11): Gorgeous. Literal chills at her voice. This is my favorite track on the album. I don't know if she's talking about a friend, or... her past self and she's moving on to a happier self. Beautiful way to close the album.

**CarlieScion** (11): the way billie sings 'nothings last, i know the deal' breaks me

**DefaultPophead** (11): Is this the best song in the rate? No. Is this my favourite song in the rate? No. Does it have something special that compels me to give it my highest score? Yes.

**Stryxen** (11): haahahahah wtf

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She really nails it here

**akanewasright** (10): Lemme just lightly edit what I wrote for my AOTY post - Anger is more often than not a mask for much more difficult to process emotions. Billie used it on the title track to avoid truly grieving the loss of a relationship and the loss of who she used to be. And from the opening lyrics of the song, it’s obvious that while she would rather do just about anything instead of feeling what she’s really feeling, she can’t do anything else without lying to herself. This song is the truth of the matter and she couldn’t have ended the album in any other way. And I’m glad she didn’t - this is one of the very best on the album and one of the best examples of Billie’s maturity as a lyricist.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is the PERFECT come down album closer. And once again, I’m a puddle of feelings on the floor.

**CritneySpearz** (10): this is so good, I think it was a good end to the album although I know most people would prefer HTE as a closer..

**flavasavavandal** (10): Is this the best closer that Billie has or will ever release? Probably

**just\_thonking** (10): "It's all I think about when I'm behind the wheel / I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel" hit me like a truck

**modulum83** (10): absolutely fucking brutal. hits me hard in ways that are inexplicable and indescribable

**musical\_pyn** (10): perfect album closer and one of billie's best songs in general

**nlh1013** (10): I’m a sad girl

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): Future Euphoria credits sequence type beat

**RandomHypnotica** (10): hello i am male and my fantasy is this song winning

**runaway3212** (10): this song does literally everything right, proving that a slow song doesn’t have to be boring

**shhhneak** (10): It’s giving Melodrama.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i get why ppl think happier than ever should have been the closer but i much prefer this

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I think this song is the perfect closer to the album. Healing isn't just catharsis like HTE, its also learning to be yourself again and that's a weird process. I'm happy to see that this song is starting to get some recognition since its release

**UselessTacooo** (10): One of the best ballads I’ve ever heard. People complain about this closing the album instead of the title track, but those people are wrong. It’s the absolute perfect way to wrap up the album, and Billies vocals are on point. I’m sure this will go out early but at least I tried to save it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Her voice is sooooo beautiful here! And the first verse… yes Billie preach!

**jasannn** (9.5): I like how the album ends off a note of maturity instead of anger.

**xedophobic** (9.5): i love this song as a closing track a lot

**IIIHenryIII** (9): it's a shame the chorus doesn't hold up to the verses

**TiltControls** (9): I forgot how much I liked this actually

**thedoctordances1940** (8.9): yes this is a better closer than hte idc

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): yeah Pornography is pretty mid, Disintegration is better

**jsonphile** (8.5): the way she says “hate you” is one of the best moments on the album

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (8.5): the first few lines came for me personally and i zoned out of the rest of the song for the first ten listens after the word "therapy" after the whole album and that first verse my brain gives up

**jman457** (8.4): A warm ending to the album

**fairytalehigh** (8.3): it took me about 3 playthroughs of this album to remember this song but it's actually very good.

**you2009** (8.3): perfect closer

**ignitethephoenix** (8.2): this isn’t a favorite of mine from her or anything but like it’s such an excellent song

**CrimsonROSET** (8): you got this bestie

**Uberpigeon** (8): this making day 3 is hypnos male fantasy

**waluigiest** (8): she made points

**wasian-invasion** (8): make her a mod of r/phcj already

**welcome2thejam** (8): Oh, there's another track on this album?

**MrMoodle** (7.8): Was definitely an interesting decision to have this be the final track. Thematically it makes the most sense, but it doesn’t seem to be a very popular decision and I’m SURE they knew that would be the case having HTE right before this. I respect them sticking to their guns though. Do your own thing, Billie.

**shipperondeck** (7.7): i used to not like this song as the closer but now i do. the lyrics are poignant, especially in the verses. anyway great album overall, i love HTE more than i ever did her debut

**cremeebrulee** (7.6): damn i just wanna give her a hug fr :(

**mysario** (7.6): yea sureee "Happier Than Ever" would be a perfect album closer but why would anyone want that when you can have something that sounds like the rest of the album?!

**hikkaru** (7.5): the title track works so well as a closer but the more i think about it i think ending with this song with this message is really poignant

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): from Genius.com: “The chorus of this song talks about Billie’s relationship with her ex-boyfriend and first love, Q.” Billie QAnon confirmed?

**jaztinax** (7.3): i can’t get over how much this sounds like this is a vault track from fearless. fearless (billie’s version) (from the vault)????

**1998tweety** (7): fine closer

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): it's a decent closing track

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): The “distract myself with pornography” line will never not catch me off-guard.

**frogaranaman** (7): I hate men

**FroyoFox\_125** (7): I kind of like this song??? It seems like a random closer, but it's nice

**Lipe18090** (7): a solid closing track to a very solid album

**ormysonormysonormys** (7): very good ending

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's pretty but it's a strange inclusion in all honesty, especially as a closer

**vayyiqra** (7): I recognize the lyrics of this are saying something important but I'm not big on how quiet it is. It works well as a closer though.

#male apologists, perhaps

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Okay song, but I can't help feel that it's somewhat misplaced

**ricki** (6.5): [2] to the comments complaining about this being the closer

**oscarbrierley1** (6): meh

**Roxieloxie** (6): yall are watching porn not on mute ??

**imbaby122** (5.5): she made points it’s just that i already said i’m anti-acoustic guitar ballad and i gotta stand by that.

**pig-serpent** (5): Happier than Ever needed something to follow it up and close out the album, but I don't think this is that something.

**plastichaxan** (5): why would she set this song up putting it after HTE which could’ve been the best closer ever…

**QuaxlyDuck** (4): weird album closer

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): didnt she write this song 5 times already on this album alone

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4): thank the lorde that this album is over

**nooodisaster** (1): i deadass pretend this song doesn't exist

DavideLNX: Tales of Dominica that low? It's the best song in the Montero album. Void also deserved higher, but I actually thought it would end up lower than it did.

(I'm biased toward Lil Nas X, but my opinions above remain true if compare them only among the songs in Montero.)
