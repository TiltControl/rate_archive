Here we have our first song out! This will be no surprise to most people, as it's one of the biggest offenders of what we in the field call 'planet her filler syndrome'. This song just is not that interesting. It repeats the same intonation so often and it really goes nowhere. Why this was included on the already padded out and long Planet Her we might never know. Luckily for us, it ends fairly quickly. A more than deserved last place.

**fairytalehigh** (8): a world like that

**vayyiqra** (8): A bit ironically, I always think this sounds more like an Ariana song than the song on here that literally has Ariana on it. (And no it's not just because of the title but that may be a factor idk)

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): pop trap bop lets go

**IIIHenryIII** (6): pretty forgettable

**nooodisaster** (6): it was supposed to give.. but it did not give, what needed to be GAVE, to the highest of giving... if that makes any sense

**ReallyCreative** (6): this word is honestly triggering, y'all have to understand I lost Kristen Wiig that dreadful day and I'm not over it

**fadedblue09** (5.5): unremarkable I fear

**modulum83** (5.5): yeah this sure is a doja cat song

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): I guess this does narrowly edge out the Gal Gadot song

#okay yeah this song just kinda sucks

**AHSWeeknd** (5): Was the vocoder necessary

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): Decent hook, but kinda uninteresting.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): I am incapable of remembering anything about this song

**seanderlust** (3.3): this one grates a bit

**celladonn** (3): My word there are a lot of forgettable songs on this album

**CrimsonROSET** (3): honestly my favorite thing about doja is how she’s not afraid to just be a nerd, but like like if this is your final form why is it worse than the rest of the album

**emmaelf** (3): right around this point in the album, the filler needed to be cut. but someone kept this for some reason.

**pig-serpent** (3): This song is the opiate of imagination.

**skargardin** (3): this is completely skippable for me I fear

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3): this is THE most filler song in the rate i'd argue. why wasn't one of the deluxe tracks included instead lmao

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (3): no. just no

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): imagining a better song

**plastichaxan** (1): sometimes a song’s worst crime is being boring

**akanewasright** (0): This is reminding me of one of my least favorite Hot Pink songs! Except worse, holy shit

**bookthieving** (0): doja's biggest strength is her personality and this track has none of it

**hikkaru** (0): good lord how is this both annoying and boring completely simultaneously

**ignitethephoenix** (0): idk what she was thinking with the verses here and the chorus is lazy. Definitely by far the worse song here

**shipperondeck** (0): dear god this song is boring. and i tend to like autotune as a stylistic flair but it just does not work here. i remember wincing the first time i heard this bc it was just so ridiculously bad compared to everything else in the album to me... and this album has other flops

More like flop & down, amirite?

Seriously though, this song makes sense as a bonus, since a similar song was already featured 4 times on the album and all of them do a better job of what this was trying to convey. What makes this at least better than "Imagine" is that it's less repetitive and it tries to be a bit more interesting despite not really succeeding.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): The very definition of weird but fun.

**ReallyCreative** (7): it's a little catchy but I get why it wasn't included on the standard version

**pig-serpent** (6): The glitchy beat on this song is cool and reminds me of the one X song I like.  Unfortunatly Doja's bad on this song.

**TChalla1966** (6): lyrical genius darling

**wasian-invasion** (6): got nothing on the masterpiece hula hoop by OMI

**apatel27** (4): Chorus sucks

**modulum83** (4): then you go up and down kinda like a frog or perhaps a toad

**skargardin** (4): the chorus sure is something

**vayyiqra** (4): Okay, I see why the bonus tracks on this are not well liked. This is idk, okay. Too short, kind of an annoying melody, same kind of trap-ish hihats she often uses. It's not very well-produced imo - there's too much bass. Not a very good song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (3.5): god this chorus is awful

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): Amazing verses mixed with garbage chorus’

**CrimsonROSET** (3): my original comment mentioned ness and while that’s good and nice i just woke a repressed memory of me wanting to learn how to do yoyo tricks and i bought a 5 bucks one in front of my school and the first time i tried a trick i dropped the yoyo and it broke in half

**shipperondeck** (3): RIGHT i almost forgot the deluxe tracks lmao. this one has almost nothing to it and the chorus is annoying. average deluxe track moment

**Verboten\_Prince** (3): This album needed a trim

**xavieryes** (3): the verses are fire (especially near the end), but the chorus almost ruins the song completely lol

**rtm416** (1): Kinda like a yo-yo describes the album

**buzzyrecky** (0): this is my favorite album of the rate so I'm giving this a 0 for being the one smelly track

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (0): Melanie Martinez and a dollar store Tierra Whack knockoff want their beat back... and the offkey singing too

**seanderlust** (0): this is the one track in this rate that is just purely annoying. this song did not need to be made at all - the metaphor only kind of makes sense, and the delivery makes me feel nothing but the urge to hit the skip button.

**thedoctordances1940** (0): down is the only way this score is going

**TiltControls** (0): "Up and Down like a yo-yo" has to be one of the most boring and least inspired metaphors ever, or at least the way it's performed here. Not even the stellar verses can save my overall dislike for the song

[insert unoriginal joke using why in some way here]. Now, in my humble opinion, this deserved better and I think it being a bonus track and the last _Planet Her_ track hurt it a lot, because this song, while not something super interesting, does a lot of things very right. For one, the melody here is actually fun. For two, Gunna. For three, I forgot what I wanted to say. Anyway, while I don’t think this shouldn't have been day one, I wish it was in the high forties instead of the low fifties.

#why why (is this so good)

**runaway3212** (10): Doja fucking bangs sometimes

**you2009** (9.5): very very very fun

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (9): Gunna and Doja should collaborate more often.

**AHSWeeknd** (8): tbh idk

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Good fun times. (Sorry, I’m running out of funny comments)

**dropthehammer11** (8): all hail wunna

**iniekcja\_** (8): i have no idea either

**1998tweety** (7): my parents whenever i do anything

**DefaultPophead** (7): I'm Gunna make a bad joke, someone stop me...

**fairytalehigh** (7): this being the final of 19 songs feels somehow anticlimactic, i can't elaborate.

**frogaranaman** (7): Gunna actually sounds pretty good here, damn.

**jman457** (7): Why is this album so long

**Lipe18090** (7): best song on deluxe

**nooodisaster** (7): I fuxs with this one

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6.9): I'm only giving you a decent score because you mentioned my country and other that that, you're Need To Know but less effective...

**RandomHypnotica** (6.7): the best of the bonus tracks but... that's not saying much

**jackisboredtoday** (6.5): song is ok but why why is the question i ask seeing this deluxe

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): its kinda generic i guess but it still sounds good

#why why (is Gunna on this)

**Alumineous** (6): There is this AIM or MSN Messenger sound effect in the background.

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this doesn’t really sound like a Doja song at all lyrically or melody wise. It’s just off. And I think I like Gunna’s part more than hers 💀

**vayyiqra** (6): Another demo-sounding track but I like the synths.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): …..well

**wasian-invasion** (6): she really went for the most grating autotune setting

**shipperondeck** (5.8): i love the synths in this sm. gunna is nice, doja is fine, the rest is ok ig, nothing new. score maybe bumped a bit for the philippines mention...

**thedoctordances1940** (5.8): omg it's gunna the most interesting rapper ever

**TiltControls** (5.5): WHERE ARE ALL THESE LOONS COMING FROM

**CrimsonROSET** (5): THE PHILLIPINES?

**fadedblue09** (5): another inessential track

**IIIHenryIII** (5): I could ask you the same thing

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): it's there

**TChalla1966** (5): well that’s one way to end your album

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (5): i'm a full album listener, and god was i tired by the time i hit this song

**imbaby122** (4.5): a little formulaic. no strong thoughts or feelings.

**modulum83** (4.5): "We Pushing 🅿️eace #prayforUkrain" --Gunna

**seanderlust** (4.5): i really wanted to like a doja-gunna collab but this ended up being fairly annoying

**slimboyfriend** (4.5): The background synth sounds like the preset on my yamaha keyboard and I’m irrationally upset by that

**apatel27** (4): It's just so awkward with the beat

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): we already had a young thug feature we did not need a gunna feature too

**MrMoodle** (4): i am literally unable to listen to gunna without thinking of biggie cheese hiphopcirclejerk destroyed my brain

**ormysonormysonormys** (4): why

**pig-serpent** (4): It's been 10 tracks since the last decent song :I

**UselessTacooo** (3.5): blegh

**akanewasright** (3): I don’t think I’m that big of a Gunna fan but his verse is one of the better parts of the song

**BasedButta** (3): her vocals are the only saving grace here

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Gunna switch the song now.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (3): This never made it out of demo territory and it shows. Did Doja have a cold or a stuffy nose while recording this?

**ricki** (3): yeah I'll just end the album at kiss me more

**skargardin** (3): it's one flop after the next with these bonus tracks honestly

**flavasavavandal** (2): Gunna just has the opposite of personality

**nlh1013** (2): she sounds very whiny in this

**waluigiest** (2): why is right

**Awkward\_King** (1): i have the same question girlie

**bookthieving** (1): the most annoying hook in this rate

**ebooks #5454** (1): enough of this album i can't take it anymore

**celladonn** (0): Why Why is this song so boring

**qazz23** (0): why why does this exist

**sufjancaesar** (0): Why, why, oh, why, oh, why does this earsore exist?

#no yeah you pretty much nailed it

**cremeebrulee** (2.8): y y? more like p p ~~idk i didn't listen to the gunna album~~

And there goes our first Olivia song! This is a somewhat surprising first song out, but it makes sense once you consider this song is easy to hate and hard to love. Olivia is being truthful about her tough experience, but at the same time it’s a ballad and lyrically it’s clunky. All that said I can see why for some people this song is really special as it describes how it feels to give everything while receiving nothing in return. However, balladphobia just struck hard and was the unstoppable force sabotaging this song.

---

#it is enough, thanks!

**AHSWeeknd** (10): wow, depressing

**Alumineous** (10): Chills. Her emotions just bleed through, like I can feel every word. Olivia, you’re gonna make me cry on empathy alone. Leave that bitch, Olivia. You don't need him.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): If you can listen to this song all the way through without breaking down in tears, I envy your life.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): once again, why does song describe my first relationship so well

**jasannn** (9): this was my sad yet comforting song for the some reason around the time I was graduating from college

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): EMOTIONAL FREAKING DAMAGE!!!

**1998tweety** (8.5): shes cute

**CrimsonROSET** (8): the lyrics in this are good but the melody is nothing and i always forget this is in the tracklist

**runaway3212** (8): intense beyond belief

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): olivia responding to critics who said she only talked about one topic on SOUR

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): Wait a minute, is the stylization in “good 4 u” there just so that you don’t think it’s weird that there are two songs with very similar titles back-to-back?

**emmaelf** (7): good lyrics but not as gripping as the tracks around it.

**FroyoFox\_125** (7): The guitar is charming, but this is a pretty stagnant ballad. I think it would've worked better as a more upbeat track. The vocals are nice though

**Lipe18090** (7): good vocals

**nooodisaster** (7): "just for you to say you're not the compliment type" gives this song like 2 points alone

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7): Olivia when I pause SOUR to go stream Fast Times by Sabrina Carpenter

**TiltControls** (7): most of the song is pretty dull, but there are some gorgeous moments that shine through here

**vayyiqra** (7): the weirdest thing about this rate is that it's making me like acoustic songs again

**modulum83** (6.7): damn, sufjan stevens really changed since the 2000s

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): vocal works good, but this is prob my least fav on the album

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): at this point i start feeling uncomfortable with this teenager pouring her heart out to me

**ormysonormysonormys** (6): I wish I could rate it 4 so it was enough 4 u, but it’s better than that ):

**pig-serpent** (6): Bog standard acoustic number, but Olivia's decent on this track.

#actually it is not enough pls fix it

**ignitethephoenix** (5.5): this song always goes in one ear and comes out the other and I always forget it

**shipperondeck** (5.4): oh my god. my filipina german sister will you stop killing your fucking momentum by putting your most lowkey songs right after your upbeat ones. this one has spectacular lyrics at least

**mysario** (5.1): despite the fact that there's like 8 sad slow songs of varying genres on this album, somehow this one feels the weakest

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): i don't fucking like it, sorry

**bigbigbee** (5): Little too much theater in the delivery here for me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I love how emotive her vocals are on this and the melodies are nice but we really, really need more of an instrumental.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): The lyrics are total cringe ngl. I know she's a teenager but even then.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): pop songs with acoustic guitars are always a hit or miss for me.

**imbaby122** (5): i think my mom likes this song and i like the switch up at the end even if it’s cliche so i’m not gonna go hard on it. not the worst as far as guitar ballads go.

**N454545** (5): i forgot this song existed

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): the highs on this album are highs but the lows are very meh

**relibee2** (5): it's just kinda there oop

**skargardin** (5): honestly i'm just insanely bored by this

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Yawn

**waluigiest** (5): this is not a good song but “I read all of your self help books so you’d think that I was smart” almost redeems it. I laugh every time I hear it.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.6): i forget that this song exists

**TheQueenofVultures** (4.5): I think the album falls apart after this point, she doesn't really have anything left to say about the relationship and I might just be too old for the teen angst stuff here. I think she has a lot of promise, but these songs feel like afterthoughts, especially given how strong the first half of the album is

**CarlieScion** (4): not like the other girls core

**fairytalehigh** (4): this is a good album but there are parts where you're like holy shit girl you're 17 and pretty chill the fuck out, this is the best example

**ReallyCreative** (4): there's just nothing going on here

**ricki** (4): olivia writing about insecurities can either be very earnest and relatable, or very whiny, she manages to be both here

**UselessTacooo** (4): lyrically it’s a great ballad, but it’s nothing I haven’t heard before. I care about originality more than most I think.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3.5): oh…theres still half an album left after good 4 u…

**DirtyRat583** (3.4): this is so boring? i think? this sounds

**akanewasright** (3): “I’d say you broke my heart but you broke much more than that” DID HE BREAK YOUR VAGINA???

**jman457** (2.5): I keep forgetting this song exists

**Awkward\_King** (2): why did she not title this enough 4 u good god that was such a missed opportunity

**cremeebrulee** (2): this not being stylized as "enough 4 u" ... especially after g4u ... make it make sense

**DefaultPophead** (2): How do you know you loved him more than the other girls? Ugh, this is such a Taylor song. He probably isn't thinking of you, and he won't care who you date next. Maybe just be yourself next time.

**ebooks #5454** (2): can't win em all olivia

**qazz23** (2): weakest of the ballads, nothing interesting about this

**Uberpigeon** (2): she out here reading jordan peterson for a twink

**you2009** (2): her attention span crazy if she reading multiple books all for a BOY

**fadedblue09** (1.5): Sounds like a whiny version of Colbie Caillat

**2dina3dworld** (1): idk why the start had me expecting the Chain but instead we got Olivia girlboss gaslighting gatekeeping

**apatel27** (0): Whiny songs are never interesting

**joeeswift** (0): very boring imo, drags the album down

**PrimaryCrusaders** (0): Maybe releasing SOUR as an EP (as originally intended) would've been a much better idea after all.

**xavieryes** (0): boring, and the constrast between the louder parts and the ballad instrumentals is uncanny

Olivia Rodrigo is a Swiftie.

For the entire beginning of her career, she wanted nothing more than to make this clear to everyone. Who could forget [this iconic tweet?](https://twitter.com/oliviarodrigo/status/1241574082652409856) But even more than in her actions, we can see it in her songs. While all of them are in some way inspired by Taylor (this is a lot of credit, but also I don't think this is a hyperbole), it’s most obvious in "1 step forward, 3 steps back" which interpolates "New Year's Day." Something else you might not have noticed about Olivia is that she is a teenager, this sometimes influences her songs in a positive way (like "brutal," which is heartfelt while being angry) but it can also make her songs feel simplistic and without much depth. That plus both Swifties (who dislike this for being worse than "New Year's Day") and anti-Swifties (who hate this for mentioning Taylor indirectly) made it impossible for this song to do well.

---

#Swifties

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She does ballads really well

**Alumineous** (10): Ugh, some men be like that. Girl, you deserve better.

**ebooks #5454** (10): this is the only song on the album that actually gives me severe emotional damage and conjuries sad bad stuff

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): When Olivia said “I don’t understand” I felt that in my soul.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): outsold new year’s day in every way possible

**FroyoFox\_125** (9.5): This song is great. I don't care what anyone else says because it's my favorite ballad on the album whores

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): A very beautiful song, the Taylor Swift sample fits really well.

**runaway3212** (9): This song is literally olivia begging to be noticed by taylor

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (8.5): No, because my and Ajayll literally had the same exact reaction to this song.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.2): at least she's just straight up using a sample this time

**TiltControls** (8): Wow we really can't escape Taylor in the ult rates

**1998tweety** (7.5): shes cute

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): this feels like a musical number

**modulum83** (7.5): cause you're hot and you're cold you're yes then you're no you're in and you're out you're up and you're down it's wrong and it's right it's black and it's white we fight we break up we kiss we make up

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): Taylor's really getting those sweet sweet royalties

**dropthehammer11** (7): can definitely her the taylor seeping through (which i get why)

**fairytalehigh** (7): this song just makes me want to listen to "new years day"

**ignitethephoenix** (7): this would be better if she didn’t sample Ms Swift

**jaztinax** (7): i appreciate the new year’s day interpolation

**jsonphile** (7): me when I fix a bug in my code and discover three new bugs

**martian\_pet** (7): shout out Ajayii

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): if i had to cut a song from the album it'd be this one. doesn't add anything nor cover topics not discussed in other songs

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Sounds pretty but this was the part of the album where I was like “waaaait are all these songs gonna be about this dude?”

**jasannn** (6.5): Is it bad that I still of the meme tik tok dance everything this plays.

**you2009** (6.5): love how the discordant piano almost sounds waltzy

**Lipe18090** (6.1): one of those songs that make this album repetitive

#anti-Swifties (or angry Swifties)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): the song you sampled is way better, sorry

**AzettImpa** (6): I get her point and I do like the song, but something's missing, better than new year's day though

**bookthieving** (6): [stale topic]

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): Taylor Swift has some great melodies but New Year's Day is not one of them. Honestly, out of all the songs to sample...

**just\_thonking** (6): 10 minus 1 minus 3 equals 6, omg easter egg

**pig-serpent** (6): ? I feel like this song is destined to end up in a bad indie movie and if I ever watch it the association is going to drop it down to a 2.

**vayyiqra** (6): really wanted to get through this album without making a Taylor comparison but the opening piano reminded me of "New Year's Day" so I lost there. Idk a nice song I guess.

**waluigiest** (6): a song full of cliches over a taylor swift instrumental…. Okay

**Awkward\_King** (5.5): wait this is nowhere near as bad as everyone else was saying

**jackisboredtoday** (5.5): if this is the first olivia song out can we use it as an excuse to avoid the antonoff rate?

**shhhneak** (5.3): Please don’t ever become a stranger who’s laugh I can recognize anywhere.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): Looking at my scoring, this is more like one step forward, five steps back.

**nooodisaster** (5): the most disposable song on the record :nauritstru:

**oscarbrierley1** (5): fully forget that this song exists until it plays on the album

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (5): not bad. not good in any outstanding way

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): yeah it's just new year's day but way worse

**fadedblue09** (4.5): Sounds like an Ingrid Michaelson reject

**ReallyCreative** (4.5): Demi Lovato's PR manager every morning

**frogaranaman** (4): adding up the numbers in this song for my score

**IIIHenryIII** (4): this is noty favorite crime. New Year's Day is a masterpiece, but this doesn't work at all.

**imbaby122** (4): can we take three steps back to brutal 😴💤😴🥱🥱🥱😴😴💤🥱😴💤😴🥱💤🥱😴

**relibee2** (4): this song just kinda bores me I'm sorry

**shipperondeck** (4): for the most part if you remove this song from the album, the theme/message doesn't change at all

**throwaway-7650** (4): 1 point given... eh I'll throw in 3 more. #TANK

**akanewasright** (3): remember how we thought taylor would have an AOTY nomination for Sour based on this and Deja Vu and then the Grammys realized it was a sample credit?

**cremeebrulee** (3): "we have new year's day at home" the new year's day at home:

**DefaultPophead** (3): I want to sleep, but one of the best songs on the album is next. Btw, is this the one with a Taylor sample? If her song is as lacklustre as this, let me know. I'll avoid it.

**jman457** (3): I think I've seen this film before…. And I didnt like the ending

**majid** (3): omfg i'm falling asleep

**nootnoot781** (3): she either makes a really camp song or the most boring song you’ve ever heard

**qazz23** (3): i'll give it the higher number

**ricki** (3): dear evan hansen ass song

**steelstepladder** (3): oh hey, it’s how I feel about this album

**Uberpigeon** (3): do i give it a 1 or a 3 to fit the name hmmmm decisions decisions!

**MrMoodle** (2.5): Olivia’s earnestness only works when it’s being played up for extreme melodrama, this is just trying to be cute so it you don’t feel the compulsion to belt out a shitty high note like traitor gets makes you, it’s just kinda whiny and boring and that’s it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (2): taylor swift interpolation🤢

**plastichaxan** (1.3): i’m so funny haha

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (1): Possibly the worst song in the rate. The chorus, I don't want to hear it again, it's awful

**ImADudeDuh** (1): https://i.imgur.com/jQqhPm7.png

**UselessTacooo** (1): wikihow how to make good song boring and bad

**xavieryes** (1): i don't know how to explain, this song is just awkward

As the only _High School Musical: The Musical: The Series_ fan on this subreddit I am deeply disappointed. I get that straight people are very scary especially when they’re happy but this is so cute and actually pretty well constructed songwriting wise. It's such a shame it was underappreciated in its time, but so was van Gogh so I will keep my head high cause I know in 500 years they'll be studying this song in songwriting classes everywhere.

No but seriously, I really like the interaction between the two parts and I think it's cool concept wise, though I get it's not for everyone

#HSM:TM:TS fans

**MrMoodle** (10): I thought I had moved past having guilty pleasures but wow this is a fucking guilty as fuck pleasure if I’ve ever had one

**RandomHypnotica** (10): ok this is just really cool and well done

**runaway3212** (10): I fucking love HSMTMTS so much

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): Okay, but how would they have recorded songs with the exact same structure and chord progression, then sent them to each other at the same time? I mean, I know it’s Disney, but come on…

**jaztinax** (9): this is so cute ugh

**throwaway-7650** (9): very sweet duet! will get robbed b/c of misandry

**InSearchOfGoodPun** (8): This is real paint by numbers songwriting but I like the formula

**seanderlust** (8): okay fine I guess I have to engage with HSMTMTS huh. this is pretty charming.

**TiltControls** (8): this is giving 2000's era commercial for coffee/laundry detergent/garden furniture

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): that's actually not bad

**Lipe18090** (7.2): didn't expect it to be good. it's fun to see these two singing together tho lol

**akanewasright** (7): I’d be kinder but this sounds like a song that I’d hear 50 choir girls try and sing on break from rehearsals. It’s cute though

**iniekcja\_** (7): not the long Taylor's version adjacent title

**dropthehammer11** (6.7): cute little tune

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): if we were gonna put Josh we should’ve made the bonus Lie Lie Lie vs Skin. It has to be funnier and better than the competent non-chemistry of this duet

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): not into it, sorry

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): Aw, bless their hearts.

**jsonphile** (6): this feels like a coffee commercial song and not just because the best part of waking up is Folgers in your cup

**slimboyfriend** (6): Idk if the mixing is off or their voices don’t go together but it sounds like Olivia just recorded this song by herself and they dubbed Joshua’s voice into different parts of the song to turn it into a duet

**welcome2thejam** (6): Okay, Count on Me by Bruno Mars

#straight up confused

**lost-ln-the-echo** (5.5): it's giving me 2014 twee youtube ukelele cover vibes

**AzettImpa** (5): just as forgettable as the show

**jman457** (5): Its giving annoying *qUiRkY* girl that just plays the ukulele for no reason

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): ravedj

**vayyiqra** (5): i am confused so this gets a 5

**modulum83** (4.5): omg i love jason mraz!!!

**shipperondeck** (4.5): this is so awkward listening to now. anyway it sure is a ukelele song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (4): this is way too straight for me

**babadork** (4): It doesn’t see fair in hindsight that they gave Joshua Bassett the worse song.

**DirtyRat583** (4): sounds like a glee song

**imbaby122** (4): idk it’s a cute little diddy 😸

**N454545** (4): disney cringe

**nlh1013** (4): almost sounds like a train song sometimes

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (4): this is the most "disney" song i've heard since i was thirteen. i didn't need this. did anyone need this?

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): I can’t stop laughing help this song isn’t even funny… but like just imagining all the drama surrounding the two is making be giggle aljsksakl

**jasannn** (3.5): #LETOLIVIALEAVEHSMTMTS

**AHSWeeknd** (3): Joshua Bassett kinda ruined this

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (3): hmmm :sob:

**shhhneak** (2.6): At least Joshua Bassett looks cute cause he sounds tone deaf.

**DefaultPophead** (2): They've got nothing on Troy and Gabriella. Then again, I would've like this Fearless-era Taylor days.

**fadedblue09** (2): normalize not doing bonus rates when the (good) material is just not there

**oscarbrierley1** (1): nah not this

**plastichaxan** (1): rave.dj vibes

**PrimaryCrusaders** (1): This is literally just royalty-free ukulele music.

**ReallyCreative** (1): A K-Mart brand Ingrid Michaelson song

**skargardin** (1): the song may be 1:47 but god listening to this felt like an eternity

And here we have our first Billie 'song' (I wonder when Lil Nas X will join the eliminated squad..) This song is hurt by a few factors; most importantly, it's an interlude and not by any means a short one. While the spoken word works for some people, for most people it's not interesting to listen to and misses the punch instrumentally that it has lyrically. Also the lack of visual accompaniment makes the song have less impact which definitely influenced people's scores.

---

#women ✨

**AHSWeeknd** (10): What Charli XCX does on twitter is Not My Responsibility

**akanewasright** (10): Billie is brilliant

**cremeebrulee** (10): SO TRUE BESTIE!!!!!!!

**jman457** (10): just from the production alone its amazing, but its an amazing stream of conscious

**musical\_pyn** (10): yeah idc this isn't even really a song, this is just so good

**ormysonormysonormys** (10): this is a 10 because of its place in the album as a whole, it just really hits for me and the lyrics are perfect

**RandomHypnotica** (10): god i love this more than a healthy person should

**skargardin** (10): I got chills the first time I heard this honestly

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): God I could never be famous, getting overanalyzed like that sounds god awful.

**Treecoh** (10): i love this interlude so much. the writing is stronger than i expected for an interlude

**waluigiest** (10): the first time I heard this was TRANSFORMATIVE. I think she needed to write a song like this. It’s raw and cuts through any “character” people thought she was playing, and it marks a turning point in the album.

**fairytalehigh** (8.8): is it weird that this gives me ASMR?

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): her feminist ASMR podcast gig

**hikkaru** (8): spillie

**Iris3271** (8): Women can never win

**jaztinax** (8): this monologue was such a shift in billie’s development

**modulum83** (8): great sounding interlude, but if only they had put an actual song over this heavenly beat. oh well, let's see what the next song is--

**MrMoodle** (8): The instrumental on this sounds like it could play in a high-end spa, it’s super moody and atmospheric, totally feel the vibe. The lyrics are a bit Dove commercial but her delivery is captivating enough for it to work, solid interlude.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8): The Eilish Manifesto

**pig-serpent** (8): This song is pretentious as hell and I kinda love it tbh.

**ricki** (8): are you tired of the ads? with Spotify prem-

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): theres no right for this interlude to be better than 90% of the album…

**vayyiqra** (8): She's right idk what else to say

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Was going to give this a four because I wanted to have at least one Billie score below Olivia's average, but I need to be genuine with my scoring. I really do like what she is saying and I think she is really eloquent. Also, for some reason it reminds me of Barbie Secret Agent's airplane headquarters noise mixed with a little ambient Kylie Minogue??? And I like that?

**you2009** (7.5): ok margaret atwood

**AzettImpa** (7): she's got a point etc etc

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): I know we're interludephobes here but this one kinda goes off

**ebooks #5454** (7): yass billie spoken word era like beyonce in lemonade (its a good prose, but i lowkey wish it was more rhyme-y)

**ignitethephoenix** (7): the reveal of this in concert was iconic and I love the sentiment of it, but it does drag a bit on here and I will never revisit it

**jsonphile** (7): as far as interludes go, it’s pretty good and certainly has a strong message

**nooodisaster** (7): she snapped.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): The most seductive “lol fuck off” I’ve ever heard

**shipperondeck** (7): one of the cooler spoken word interludes i've heard. i never skip this when i'm listening to the album in order

**UselessTacooo** (7): Billie has said these were the favourite words she’s ever written, and it makes sense. It would be a 10 but I’m interludephobic

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): How do you rate a monologue

**wasian-invasion** (7): I admire the song and am glad it exists but don’t really feel the need to relisten

**welcome2thejam** (7): Not sure how to rate this one. As a song, it doesn't work for me, but as an interlude for Overheated, it does its job well. Splitting the difference

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): idk i quite like it, sure it's not amazing or something but it definitely works and it's better than quite a few other songs here

#okay that's enough activism for today

**apatel27** (6.5): It's a good message but it's not a song, it's something that plays at the back of a contemporary art gallery

**seanderlust** (6.5): it's fairly good but it's an interlude so idk how to rate it. billie speaking truth over ps4 home screen music

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): a decent interlude

**CrimsonROSET** (6): work

**emayzee** (6): i don't know how to rate this

**flavasavavandal** (6): I get it, but why would I ever want to listen to this outside of the album

**jackisboredtoday** (6): idk this is an interlude and not really a song. It has interesting things to say but I never come back to it outside the album and it feels weird to grade it like a song so I’m just giving a neutral score

**just\_thonking** (6): I like the message but it becomes tedious on repeated listens of the album. That being said, the background production is nice.

**kappyko** (6): SO MAKE LOTS OF NOISE KISS LOTS OF BOYS OR KISS LOTS OF GIRLS IF THAT'S SOMETHIN YOU'RE INTO

**majid** (6): yass tell them

**pleasegivemeasword** (6): she's speaking facts but also she's just speaking

**racloves** (6): I love the lyrics/message but like sonically it’s not really a song I listen to a lot

**xavieryes** (6): I hate rating interludes, so I'm just gonna give a score I'd give to a mediocre song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (5): I can’t give this too high of a score because it’s not really a song but it still sounds really good!

**celladonn** (5): She's right and she should say it but this is a skip

**CritneySpearz** (5): she spilled omg (ok but this is an interlude and I have interludephobia, I’m sorry)

**darjeelingdarkroast** (5): I like the lyrics, but the song and delivery a bit too slow for me, wish there was more development throughout the song

**devilonmytongue0** (5): it is good but i lowkey find spoken stuff a bit cringe

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5): it's a nice speech but i don't wanna hear it every time i listen to the album

**dropthehammer11** (5): i respect what shes doing here entirely, and for spoken word it goes over alright, but its not something id wanna listen to regularly

**IIIHenryIII** (5): this has no replay value

**ktajlili** (5): this a powerful interlude, but I don't want to listen to it every time I listen to the album. I get bored.

**N454545** (5): nice but where is the song?

**slimboyfriend** (5): Pop stars doing spoken word interludes is Camp. but also this shouldn’t have been almost FOUR minutes

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): look i get the point of these but i'm 26 so this is nothing new to me

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (5): middle ground between 0 and 10 great message but it's an interlude not a song

**TipsyTom55** (5): the intrumental in the back simultaneously makes me feel like im about to die, like im at the end of a teen drama series where the narrator goes over what happened over the series as the show starts showing the characters doing their own things, and like im listening to an american horror story adaptation of the wii theme music

**1998tweety** (4): it's ok, I mean it's just her talking. it's fine within the album but as a standalone song it's meh.

**CarlieScion** (4): yes keep talking instead of whisper-singing, queen

**emmaelf** (4): end spoken word segments now, even with powerful lyrics

**Epicallytossed** (4): like the sentiment, feels out of place imo

**poemforsmallthings** (4): like... okay

**qazz23** (4): much too long for an interlude-style track

**runaway3212** (4): spoken word in music is not for me #notsorry

ph2021ultimate: #these raters to Billie: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9MogWz-LHXI

**2dina3dworld** (3): I appreciate the message, and it’s such an important one about not putting celebrities on a pedestal and not becoming parasitically obsessed with every aspect of a celebrity and their persona or sexualising them and seeing them purely as a product. BUT, as an individual piece of music it’s not good, very boring, and I guess that’s what I’m scoring over its ultimate message. Because while I appreciate the message, it’s so barebones and sluggish that it’s almost sleep inducing.

**babadork** (3): Preach, but I would guess that this would have more of an impact in a stadium than it does in my bedroom. This doesn’t contribute to the score I’m giving it, but my dog weirdly hates this song.

**bigbigbee** (3): I’m sure this hits different in concert but on a CD it feels like the album grinds to a screeching halt. Good message, but I would internally groan whenever this one came on during my album listens

**ImADudeDuh** (3): i’m sorry but it’s giving https://www.instagram.com/p/BUZNyIVDQ6z

**imbaby122** (3): loving the big boobie rep in media and the message is there i just will never get behind a spoken word interlude 💔 especially when billie manages to speak in the same accent she sings in, it’s a little goofy

**jasannn** (3): not to be interludephobic but the echoing production here really hurts my ears to

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (3): if the shitpost isn't this then idk https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hsPre9uV1Jk

**TiltControls** (3): I swear I've heard this production in Donkey Kong Country before

**fadedblue09** (2.5): I get the message, but it's kinda on the nose

**shhhneak** (2.5): Okay girl save it for the insta caption.

**xedophobic** (2.5): i love words

**Awkward\_King** (2): i think the message of this song is obviously great and appreciate how it stands as a quote unquote interlude on the album but i also would absolutely never listen to it on its own and also think billie could've achieved this same message and greater effect turning this idea into an actual song rather than a monologue

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (2): Why is this so long?

**BasedButta** (2): yes i do have opinions about your music now take this 2 -_-

**ManofOranges** (2): Me talking about my responsibilities

**MassiveThief** (2): always a skip for me, cool idea but this section of the album is super slow and this doesn't help

**oscarbrierley1** (2): like the message but wayyyy to long for an interlude

**DirtyRat583** (1): im all for the message but this "song" is not a song and it is unworthy of being on the same list as other songs here

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (0): I appreciate what she is saying but it just goes on for way way too long and grinds the album to a halt

**mysario** (0): Thank you The 1979 for this message

**nlh1013** (0): just talking so didn’t deserve a score really imo

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (0): i’m pretty sure when i first listened to this album i deadass fell asleep somewhere around this point

Our first average above 6! Meaning we finally at least kinda like the songs. The problem with "Everybody Dies" is just that it feels a bit shallow. There’s a lot of existential contemplation that can be done with the realization that everybody dies. 'If connections with other people give life meaning, does life even have meaning when everybody else is gone?' 'Have people who achieved very little lived for nothing or is life worth something just because it is life?' 'If death is inevitable should we put as much effort as we do in delaying it?'

Billie bravely decides to tackle none of these questions but instead focuses on the more personal 'Why should I stay if everybody goes eventually?' Staying more personal isn't bad per se, but it does make it so that you have to give a satisfying answer one way or the other. The resolution 'you are not alone' is unsatisfying because it provides no resolution to the question asked earlier. Billie decides to soundtrack this ultimately not satisfying contemplation with an ultimately unsatisfying sonic environment. This song has a lot of potential but rarely makes use of any of it so it’s not surprising it’s not that high.

**jaztinax** (7): my least favorite of this album, but for some reason i love listening to this when going to bed

**MassiveThief** (7): I love when her vocals get louder/more passionate to break up the quiteness. Wish more songs had that.

**poemforsmallthings** (7): this made me cry on my first listen

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): How good this song is depends on how depressed you are when you hear it.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.9): this has a kinda interesting torch singer thing going on with it that exists elsewhere on the album but feels clearest here. anyway rip to everybody but im different

**TiltControls** (6.5): blame elden ring for this ballot being delayed

#on meds

**akanewasright** (6): I really do appreciate what she was going for with this song, but I don’t think it lands as well as the other tracks on the album

**CrimsonROSET** (6): oh

**frogaranaman** (6): The Walking Dead

**ktajlili** (6): most forgettable song on the album tbh

**skargardin** (6): I don't necessarily hate it but it doesn't add much to the album

**seanderlust** (5.6): everybody dies feels a bit forgettable, especially given the run that it precedes

**fadedblue09** (5.5): Lyrics are too pseudo-deep and sonically uninteresting compared to the rest of the album

**modulum83** (5.5): can't remember anything about this

**IIIHenryIII** (5): yeah, they do, but this song might just speed up their end

**oscarbrierley1** (5): so forgettable

**pig-serpent** (5): This one doesn't really do a whole lot for me, but it sets up Your Power very nicely, so that's a plus.

**slimboyfriend** (5): not alone, not alone, not alone… not alone, not alone, not alone… not alone, not alone, not alone… not alone, not alone, not alone

**waluigiest** (5): what in the Halsey is happening here

**imbaby122** (4.5): i don’t remember this song 💔

**shipperondeck** (4): ok i know everybody dies but you dont have to remind me billie. i know im missing the whole point of the song.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): This song leaves no trace whatsoever on my brain

**nlh1013** (3): boring

**sweetnsoursauce11** (2): nah

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (1.5): this whole middle section of the album just pls delete i’m bored

**2dina3dworld** (1): this song is too morbid for me. I can’t enjoy it because I’m too unsettled to even fully listen to it. I hate songs that make me question my mortality and my future, purely because the anxiety brought on by that is too much to process.

**cremeebrulee** (1): i'm ngl i forgot this was on the album

**runaway3212** (1): this song leaves like no impact

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): sorry i hate these types of existential crisis songs i get so much anxiety just thinking about it

Now for a song I have a personal weak spot for. Is this yet another ballad? Yes. Does this do very little new in sound or lyrics for the album? Yes. But the line "I hope you're happy but don't be happier" is just a little bit too relatable to me. It to me strikes the perfect balance between petty and positive thoughts about your ex. And it's the only breakup ballad that really gets this ballad right in my opinion. However it suffers from problems other ballads have in that it is a bit simplistic and doesn't really feel like breaking new grounds on an album that’s all things considered very short.

#I'm sorry Tr1s we failed you

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (11): This song. This freaking song!!! The first time I heard I just felt like :poohascend:

#they are happy

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She’s a great writer, whew

**Alumineous** (10): Wow. We’re all selfish in that way and yet we all want the best for everyone. Again, Olivia delivers this song so well. She definitely sang.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this is a good ballad

**jaztinax** (10): i just love 6/8 songs ok

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): i'm still obsessed w the way she sings "she probably gives u butterflies"

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i need a rock version of this song

**1998tweety** (9): serve

**emmaelf** (9): i just love the pettiness - i could absolutely have written this song a few years ago after an awful breakup. *chef's kiss*

**jasannn** (9): This song is surprising hard to sing. I’ve almost ran out of breath while singing this in the car.

**runaway3212** (9): I think lyrically this song is terrible and this album has one too many ballads. However this is a 9

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): I feel like this isn't a popular opinion but this is easily my favourite of the non-singles, I just think it's very pretty and Olivia sounds great

**shipperondeck** (8.4): maybe basic in structure but it works really well

**xedophobic** (8.2): god i love this album she's just angsty and hates her ex but i like to generalize it to everyone just cause i feel like it (edgy)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): I'm giving this an eight because I could at least barely sing it and also because it's fine

**jsonphile** (8): “think of me fondly when your hands are on her” is the PG version of “and are you thinking of me when you fuck her?”

**MassiveThief** (8): this album makes me pretty balladphobic, but this is definitely an exception. love how it's dramatic with the string swells but not over the top.

**nooodisaster** (8): Lyrically fits the "Sour" theme perfectly, melodically such an earworm, and I truly dgaf when it was written.

**TiltControls** (8): I don't know if this song is great, but it does something to my ears

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): this is so passive aggressive lmao. Also I could see Ed Sheeran doing this song for some reason

**jman457** (7.7): One of the better ballads on this albums; the guitar is really good

**IIIHenryIII** (7.5): the end of the chorus, but don't be happier, ruins this song for me.

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): There’s a nice 1950s/1960s slow prom song vibe to this one that I never picked up on before.

**RandomHypnotica** (7.1): as long as he's not happier than ever

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): This song’s got a good chorus, but I don’t find the rest of it that interesting.

**Epicallytossed** (7): THE SYNTH AT THE START MADE ME THINK SHE WAS GOING SYNTHPOP AND THEN IT GOES BACK INTO A PIANO BALLAD THE SONG IS FINE BUT UGH WHY COULDN'T IT BE SYNTHPOP I WONDER HOW SHE'D APPROACH

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): Even an album as perfect as this has a weak stretch, and this is where it starts.

**sufjancaesar** (7): Cleared Ed Sheeran

**UselessTacooo** (7): one of the best ballads on the album. I love the instrumental on it, which I think is a hot take but I could care less

**FroyoFox\_125** (6.5): This song would've been much better as a non-ballad, just like the previous one

**jackisboredtoday** (6.1): sure you don’t want him to be happier but what if when he’s away from you he’s happier than ever

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): I hate to say it but Ed Sheeran did it better

**CrimsonROSET** (6): i for one don’t hope you’re happier i hope you’re suffering

**imbaby122** (6): i think the premise of the song is clever and i like that one little guitar riff but this sounds like 100 other songs. i’m surprised there was not lawsuit for this one lol

**modulum83** (6): kanye is currently listening to this in his room and crying

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): then ever

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Oh my GODDD GIRL GET OVER HIM!!

**ricki** (5.5): +2 because that second verse slays and im a whore for that distorted guitar. -0.5 for how she says "hap-pee-erh"

#they are not happy

**bookthieving** (5): maybe 6/8 ballads are just too cheesy for me

**ebooks #5454** (5): ed sheeran did it better

**fairytalehigh** (5): i can't decide if "i hope you're happy, but don't be happier" is brilliant or just insanely petty

**shhhneak** (5): She’s really doing all this for a Twink.

**vayyiqra** (5): idk I'm struggling to come up with comments but want to write one for every song (the rater urge)

**waluigiest** (5): sure

**DirtyRat583** (4): another song that sounds but at least this one is a bit denser

**Stryxen** (4): lyrics are nice but the production is just kinda limp and lifeless - it evokes 0 emotion and it’s void of personality

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (4): i got so tired of the sad breakup ballads by this point

**2dina3dworld** (3): I’m sorry,,, but Ed Sheeran genuinely did it better

**frogaranaman** (3): yea sorry I just think this sucks

**pig-serpent** (3): 6/8 is an amazing time signature, one of my favorites, and yet everyone wants to write the exact same 6/8 piano song and never touch the time signature for anything else.  We get it, Halleluljah is a great song, please stop trying to rewrite it.

**Uberpigeon** (3): when she said "she probably gives you b-" i thought it was going a very different direction for a short second

**welcome2thejam** (3): There's an admitted sense of teenage pettiness and melodrama here that keeps me from wanting to visit this again, but I do think its interesting to hear how those natural feelings play out in song form. Bleh song outside of that though

**you2009** (3): this is how I hate on people

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (2): This is a slog…

**DefaultPophead** (2): I want to give this a lower score, but anything lower than a two is reserved for Dr. Luke songs and the horror that is "Payday"

**fadedblue09** (2): Glad she acknowledges her selfishness but this still rubs me the wrong way. The first 3 seconds were the only good part of this

**xavieryes** (2): another awkward snooze

**cremeebrulee** (1.2): "we broke up a month ago" oh we're doing this again

**akanewasright** (1): God how is this concept so underbaked and overexplained?

**Awkward\_King** (1): i wish this song had a tolerable melody bc the line "i hope you're happy but don't be happier" hits so hard and is so relatable, but the song is ugly

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (1): I feel a theater kid music infection as it bursts out pus and blood into my ears when this song plays

**MrMoodle** (0): “she probably gives you butt-” thought this song was about to get more interesting for a second lol

**nootnoot781** (0): i am sick of all the boring ballads on this album and this one pisses me off the most

**ReallyCreative** (0): the way this song could have been a therapy session

**TheQueenofVultures** (0): This is just a worse version of Deja Vu, except she's not mean like she was in Deja Vu so it's just self-pitying

"Ride" is like if an algorithm made a _Planet Her_ song. However, I have for a really long time been advocating for more algorithm based music because it often slays. What can I say, the algorithm gets me. This song being a bonus track means it was never gonna do well but it at least managed to be above some of the truly bad stuff. It’s catchy and cute, but being a rate with gorgeous above gorgeous this feels like a fitting placement.

---

#te quiero ride

**AHSWeeknd** (10): This was made for a modern day Fast and Furious movie

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wait why wasn’t this on the album

**fadedblue09** (10): Now this deserved a placement on the standard edition

**fairytalehigh** (9): what can i say, this beat is sick

**ReallyCreative** (9): my favorite of the deluxe tracks, this is great

**you2009** (8.5): very fun

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): deserved a place in the original album version

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Why are the deluxe tracks so much fun, wut?

**nootnoot781** (8): the world will start to heal when doja releases an afrobeat/carribean inspired album. doja X wizkid, doja X stefflon don… i need it

**runaway3212** (8): Honestly this song is perfect

**TChalla1966** (8): it’s giving 00s bop

**1998tweety** (7.5): bops a bit

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): omg doja putting an average song on her album!!! yass she ate that the bar is on the floor

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): A pretty typical Doja song.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): should've been on the main album tbh

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): initially rated much worse because of the album length drag but i actually like it

**TiltControls** (7): It's fun, but I can see why it was relegated to the deluxe

**vayyiqra** (7): It's okay but has the same problems some of these bonus songs have with kind of bad production - this sounds like a demo to me. Why does the bass sound so bad? Is it my headphones? Otherwise, kind of a bop.

**imbaby122** (6.5): just silly mindless fun!

**wasian-invasion** (6.5): this sure is a bonus track

**jackisboredtoday** (6.3): this is a song that i forget exists as i’m literally listening to it

**jman457** (6.2): Lana Del Rey outsold

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is a cute little bonus track.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): how do popheads feel about ride by SoMo?

#como a mi bike

**ricki** (5.5): did doja write all the bonus tracks the day before release date

**DefaultPophead** (5): This is fine I guess but too bland.

**nooodisaster** (5): rode

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): that sure was a doja cat song

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Is it almost over

**waluigiest** (5): sure

**seanderlust** (4): the beat is fine but nothing to write home about, the ideas in the lyrics feel disconnected from one another

**ormysonormysonormys** (3): I’m sick of this inconsistent album

**pig-serpent** (3): Ride is such an exciting title, but Doja sounds like she's asleep in the back seat.

**shipperondeck** (3): some good lines in here but also really boring, i forget what it sounds like whenever im not listening to it

**akanewasright** (2): I was gonna give this a neutral five and move on BUT WHAT THE FUCK ARE THESE BACKING VOCALS

This run of "Imagine" and "Alone" being in between two of the best songs of _Planet Her_ really influenced both badly. Not that there was that much to begin with. This song's biggest crime is how it's just not that memorable. The part most people remember is the low 'alone' and, to Doja's credit, she does use that sound often which makes this song overall slightly more interesting. However the sound overall really makes it not stand out on an album that often uses this kind of sound. It ultimately feels like it was included as a "necessary" ballad, but one that fans neither asked nor cared for.

#introvert

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Do more ballads Doja

**iniekcja\_** (10): how do I put music on a tombstone

**TChalla1966** (10): excellence.

**UselessTacooo** (10): I love space ballads pt. 2

**you2009** (10): T__T

**shhhneak** (9.5): That’s what we’ve been waiting for! It’s what we wanted all along.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.2): i'm always scared to be alone

**AzettImpa** (9): should've been the last song!!

**fadedblue09** (9): That guitar elevates everything

**vayyiqra** (9): Never thought I'd say this about a Doja song but the acoustic guitar on this is one of the best parts.

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): this song is good, but it kinda gets lost in the second half of the album

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): There's something so captivating about the "fuck me at the door" part

**MrMoodle** (8): This is just as fillery as most of the non-singles here but tbh a smooth guitar line is enough to satisfy me so idc

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): Yes, I would do anything for horniness…but I won’t do THAT

**runaway3212** (8): I think doja is such a slayer tbh

**waluigiest** (8): her voice is nice here

**wasian-invasion** (8): dw doja you'll never be alone when you have your tinychat friends

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): this isn’t the classic power ballad by Heart

**TiltControls** (7.5): the background "Alone"s are taken that one spongebob episode where squidward gets stuck in the time void

**1998tweety** (7): ok

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): it is fine but I've heard this story before

**CrimsonROSET** (7): therapy!

**Lipe18090** (7): good production and vocals but kinda repetitive

**nooodisaster** (7): Mid

**skargardin** (7): this is pleasant

**jaztinax** (6.9): missed out the chance to have kehlani as a feature on this

**imbaby122** (6.5): I just really like the second verse flow 😸

**jackisboredtoday** (6.4): The beat is nice but this song is the definition of mid

**shipperondeck** (6.3): i actually like this one more than i think it deserves and i can't figure out why. the overall mood is well established even if it doesn't fit the album well.

**modulum83** (6): this isn't good but i like every time the low voice says 'alone'

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): this sounds like something i’d hear at a coffeeshop

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Meh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.8): vocals save this

#extrovert

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): I like Doja’s rapping verse here, but the rest kinda bores me.

**IIIHenryIII** (5): why one of the worst songs off the album had to be one of the longest

**ricki** (5): an early 00s r&b song but the singer is on the verge of falling asleep the whole time

**2dina3dworld** (4): this album did not need a ballad

**Alumineous** (4): Nice guitar.

**DefaultPophead** (4): Not sure why this feels so boring. Also, don't like the way she enunciates on this.

**ebooks #5454** (4): "both of us needed a whole therapist" me and my multiple personalities

**ImADudeDuh** (4): im giving so many of these songs middling scores but its because so many of them are BORING and MID

**jman457** (3.7): Its just boring

**akanewasright** (3): I like the second verse but… this is just kinda dull as shit

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): It felt like nothing happened during this entire song.

**pig-serpent** (2): Honestly why does the second half of this album exist?  People drop 20 minute albums all the time, 40 minutes of this crap is way too much.  The guitar line is an okay start but man absolutely nothing is done with it.  It honestly sounds like Doja just adlibbed a weak melody and called it a night.

**cremeebrulee** (1.6): this is so boring and it drags for so long and for what

**Awkward\_King** (1.5): if this was earlier on it would definitely get a higher score but girl why u putting the worst songs at the end of an already bad album,.,. spread em out a little

**TragicKingdom1** (0): this is such a snooze

**frogaranaman** (8): bts meal was good

**RandomHypnotica** (6): the BTS meal was the only one available in Australia, so the best thing for me was just reading all the jokes people made on twitter

**runaway3212** (2): Hottie sauce was the only one that served

---

**AHSWeeknd** (10): say what you want, but Megan Thee Stallion’s Popeyes sauce went off, it wasn’t good but it was cAmP

**ImADudeDuh** (10): we love mcdonalds

**mysario** (10): all the McDonald's meals were trash (although iconic) but Burger King had meals for Larissa Machado (Anitta), Cornell Haynes Jr (Nelly), and most importantly Chase Hudson (Lil Huddy), and they were GREAT. Specifically, the Chase Hudson meal came with a Spicy Ch'King Sandwich (think Chik-Fil-A but less homophobia), some Mozzarella Sticks, and a medium Chocolate Shake for only $6! I got that for a month during breaks at work until I stopped fitting in my pants then I got new pants and got them again. Eat THAT Wendy's 444

**Verboten-Prince** (9): Not gonna lie I kinda wanted those BTS shirts… they looked cool

**IIIHenryIII** (7): Lana's Pepsi when???

**pleasegivemeasword** (5): it doesn’t beat the time when the rick and morty fans were breaking into mcdonalds asking for that sauce tho. that was truly a disaster

**racloves** (5): it’s cool but wasn’t a thing in my country unfortunately so

**skargardin** (4): the travis meal was iconic, but otherwise, eh

**DirtyRat583** (2): rude of them to be NA only

**flavasavavandal** (1): don't remind me of travis scott again please

Now for an absolute slay of a beat and three mediocre verses. This beat is 2004 in all the best ways. This is the final bonus track from _Planet Her_ to be eliminated and I think what really helped it is just how unique it is. Not even compared to other _Planet Her_ songs but also just to other songs right now. The beat is nothing like what's popular right now. However, that is also where the praise stops, it simply does not do enough interesting things with the beat to become a truly standout track. It just falls flat, even Eve, the queen, the legend can’t really make this song better which is a true shame, because there was a lot of potential.

---

#yass grenade to Eve

**Nerdy\_boy\_chris** (10): TOP 3 ON THE ALBUM DON’T DISREPECT EVE

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I think Eve should be on more songs, she always makes it better

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): I have no clue why I like this as much as I do, but I do… so… take it or leave it.

**musical\_pyn** (9): it's a small thing but the way eve says doja cat right after her verse is one of the best parts of the album

**emayzee** (8.9): this is so 2001 in the best way

**mysario** (8.6): I'm embarrassed to admit I thought of Eve 6 before I thought of the rapper Eve even though both haven't been relevant since the early 2000s

**FroyoFox\_125** (8.5): This song has a classic feel to it, and Eve's cadence is so good!

**nlh1013** (8.5): sounds like a throwback and I love it

**DirtyRat583** (8.4): giving destinys child and i LOVE destinys child so

**jackisboredtoday** (8.4): this does such an impressive job of recreating the feel of the early 00s hits someone like Eve would have been on, I really do think this is a great idea executed really well even if the beat is just ripping off older producers

**fairytalehigh** (8.2): love the throwback production

**1998tweety** (8): BOP why wasnt this on the standard version?

**celladonn** (8): Finding out this beat was made in 2004 made a lot of sense, it feels very of that time and is a refreshing change of pace. Definitely suits Eve as well.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): Smooth and you can't go wrong with this classic direction for a R&B duo when said duo is Doja and Eve

**iniekcja\_** (8): I dissociated during Eve's verse, it was good, but I needed to replay it three times

**jaztinax** (8): come through 2000s vibes

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): This feels like a 90s R&B song in a good way.

**TiltControls** (8): Love Eve on here!

**vayyiqra** (8): Much better than the song before it. I'm surprised this doesn't sample some 90s R&B song - that guitar sounds familiar somehow.

**waluigiest** (8): eve is still making music???

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): this couldve dropped in 2002 and been a smash. like it a lot

**Iris3271** (7.5): I love the chorus

**MrMoodle** (7.5): Eve sounds sooo good over this beat, little repetitive after a while though, the instrumental really doesn’t evolve even slightly throughout the entire song lol

**oscarbrierley1** (7.5): the y2k vibes are giving nostalgia

**Saison\_Marguerite** (7.5): I really wish this was more remarkable because I’m so here for Eve

**UselessTacooo** (7.5): 2000’s MCs promo

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): did i just have nostalgia for wild thoughts? oh god

**jman457** (7.3): I like the early 2000’s vibe on this

**Alumineous** (7): I like the guitar beat in the back. Eve sounds good.

**ebooks #5454** (7): that one guitar chord rlly carrying this song

**fadedblue09** (7): Could've been better but otherwise decent

**frogaranaman** (7): the vibe here is cute

**runaway3212** (7): I think this sounds super nice

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Ooo I love the hip hop throwback vibe

**shipperondeck** (6.9): YESSSSSS WE LOVE EVE she's the best part of this for sure

**Awkward\_King** (6.5): eve taking a break from her very busy schedule of filming queens the drama on nbc and losing popheads rate to send doja a mediocre verse!! slay

**emmaelf** (6.5): i felt like i had been transported to 1999 with that opening and i was so down for it and then they just. kept. repeating. the riff. and then i was done with it.

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): I swear this is some long lost sample from Scorpion

**Lipe18090** (6.4): interesting but doesn't go nowhere

**pleasegivemeasword** (6.3): i wish i liked this more

**AHSWeeknd** (6): This beat ain’t it tbh

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): not into it, even with Eve

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): eve feature is good I guess

**ignitethephoenix** (6): this sounds like a Walmart version of Wild Thoughts

**IIIHenryIII** (6): is this an interpolation or sample of some hit from the 2000s? It sounds so familiar. Oh, Eve is here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): its fun but could'be been better

#stans of Adam

**2dina3dworld** (5.5): 00s MCs was just very convoluted ult promo, change my mind

**bigbigbee** (5.5): I think Doja is the best part of any collaboration she does….except for this song, where I just kind of want it to be Eve the whole time. I don’t think that Doja’s sort of “ethereal” delivery on this works for me - I really prefer Eve’s more crisp, conversational style

**imbaby122** (5.5): only know eve from her brief cameo on antm but she ate doja up here!!!

**ReallyCreative** (5.5): it's missing something

**ricki** (5.5): ok

**akanewasright** (5): I love Eve so much but everything else is so zzzzz

**CrimsonROSET** (5): do 00s mcs!

**modulum83** (5): the tiktokified santana - smooth instrumental isnt even that good but its the only thing sustaining me through these fucking bonus tracks

**pig-serpent** (5): Yeah this is fine I guess.  It's like a better version of Alone, or at least has a better guitar riff, but it's still not particularly interesting.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Eve is a welcome presence

**BasedButta** (4.5): this one kept getting worse and i dont like the feat part either

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): That guitar line wears out its welcome pretty quickly.

**hikkaru** (4): i feel like this sort of throwback sound with an eve feat had potential but this is very mid

**lost-ln-the-echo** (4): this beat is soooo repetitive it's kind of annoying tbh

**skargardin** (4): I hate to say it, but Eve's verse is really forgettable here. I would like to see them collab in the future though to create something more substantial bc I feel like there's potential there.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): i wish this song was more interesting, i really like the acoustic guitar beat

**nooodisaster** (3): I felt nothing

**Stryxen** (3): eve’s verse is alright but nothing special and the rest…

**DefaultPophead** (0): Dr. Luke songs and "Payday" get an automatic one or zero. And this was the worst one.

**RandomHypnotica** (0): this sounds like an obnoxiously bass-boosted 00's MC filler song

I'm running out of options for how to phrase "this Doja song is boring" can we please eliminate somebody else

---

#people with options

**CreepyMannequin** (11): I had never heard this song before this rate but WOW. This is such a great song - fun, sexy, a bop through and through. The “dropping your jaw when the drawers hit the floor” line is SO CATCHY. I hope this isn’t underrated. I’m already mystified this wasn’t a single from the album.

**apatel27** (10): popheads misandry be damned this slaps

**fairytalehigh** (10): the beat going off during JID's part really does it for me

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): *DJ Khaled voice* Another one!

**nootnoot781** (10): jid fucking SLIDES on that beat it’s so good!!

**Treecoh** (10): lowkey the best song on the album

**UselessTacooo** (10): JID absolutely eats Doja here. The track is really underrated

**you2009** (10): something something jid beating on doja's head like bongo drums cos why the song end right after this verse

**AzettImpa** (9): liked this waaaay more than I expected

**fadedblue09** (9): The instrumental here is hypnotic

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): i love this song but out of the whole album, i associate this the most with the sydney 2021 pandemic which gives me slight ptsd

**vayyiqra** (9): I never noticed the "vegetable" line but yeah I dislike it. Overall still a song I like a lot though.

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): not a big fan of her lower register here but this slaps and is fun

**1998tweety** (8): bop

**akanewasright** (8): I don’t have thoughts about this song [I just shake tits to it](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/768833554200264724/810589974806265916/SPOILER_boob.gif)

**Awkward\_King** (8): jid's verse carries this song insanely hard

**DefaultPophead** (8): Lowkey one of the songs with the most replayability in the album.

**IIIHenryIII** (8): and you thought it was a good idea to give us these many options too? Doja, the tracklist is too long

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): Has one album not produced by Tyga ever had so many songs that are exclusively about being horny?

**waluigiest** (8): “put it back on I’m bossy” oh work

**Iris3271** (7.5): I like JID's part a lot

**shipperondeck** (7.2): YAY FOR THE BASS FLUTE !!! or least a flute pitched down idk. i like how down bad JID is in his feature lmao, it also fits really well

**AHSWeeknd** (7): Not this following Been Like This

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): not into JID sorry

**dropthehammer11** (7): JIDs feature is rly smooth and went over better than i expected it to

**frogaranaman** (7): JID absolutely destroys it here, goddamn

**jaztinax** (7): i listened to this a lot when the album came out but now i honestly don’t know why

**jman457** (6.8): A lazy beat, but im always glad for J.I.D for getting more exposure

**MrMoodle** (6.5): Doja actually goes super hard on the hook and JID sounds great in his verse but they’re supported by this limp-ass instrumental it’s so frustrating

**Lipe18090** (6.3): meh

**RandomHypnotica** (6.3): ["lying on the bed like a vegetable"](https://i.imgur.com/gcPqyRO.png)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (6): JID verse is neat

**CrimsonROSET** (6): please dont fuck on a kitchen island how else are you going to knead your sourdough

#predeterminalists or something idk the word

**seanderlust** (5.5): :/ "lying in my bed like a vegetable"???

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): this is mid stream surround sound instead

**flavasavavandal** (5): clearly Doja didn’t have many options if JID is here instead of someone good

**ktajlili** (5): good thing i have the option to listen to another song ahahahaha

**modulum83** (5): super mario 64 type beat

**nooodisaster** (5): Classic example of a pop song with a killer chorus I'm instantly waiting to get back to.

**poemforsmallthings** (5): well

**ReallyCreative** (5): definitely considering the option to press skip!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (5): "laying in my bed like a vegetable"? 💀

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Kitchen, island, bedroom, closet, man, camera, TV

**wasian-invasion** (5): something something wish i had the option to skip this

**2dina3dworld** (4.5): LIKE A VEGETABLE??? We don’t support ableism in this house, get the fuck out

**imbaby122** (4.5): this had potential it just didn’t really go anywhere

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (4): I was expecting a little more from a JID collab, but it’s fine.

**TiltControls** (4): it's taken me multiple passes of the album and I still don't remember this track all that well. It's fine, but really nothing else to it

**pig-serpent** (3.5): Doja has a few okay bars on this but this beat is garbage.

**Alumineous** (3): Weak chorus. JID did something, didn't make it better or worse.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (3): Gonna use the option to listen to a different song.

**runaway3212** (3): there’s just nothing exciting about this song

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): i think im starting to understand why so many people dislike the deep cuts on this album now

**tickframe** (3): i do not like this one at all, something about that production is so grating to me

**welcome2thejam** (3): The excitement of seeing a J.I.D. feature followed by the stark reality of the track being bleh

**BasedButta** (1): grating beat

**bookthieving** (1): the flute sample is just so deeply un-sexy

well, I guess not

This song was actually doing a lot better for a while but it slowly but surely went lower and lower. This is another filler track BUT this one is actually really catchy even if it's not that interesting.

---

#fans of bacon

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Doja has the ability to seduce you via vocals. She also has the ability to scare you via TikTok.

**bluexplus** (10): im just a doja cat stan tbh

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): Another fucking banger

**UselessTacooo** (10): Space Ballads are something I need to hear more of.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): the best sad track here

**you2009** (9): she is SICK and TIRED

**akanewasright** (8.5): I consider this song a sort of equal opposite to my favorite Doja song, Streets. Obviously this song is very much using the same formula as that song (R&B song with a rapped second verse), but Been Like This is a lot more peaceful. While Streets is defined by tension and being stuck in the moment, Been Like This is free and retrospective. I burnt myself out on this one *hard*, but it’s an album highlight imo, and the visual of her floating above the VMAs stage really made me grow to like it

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): I really Like this. It has a bit of a rock undercurrent that works for her.

**fadedblue09** (8.5): another grower for me.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): The better version of You Right

**nooodisaster** (8.5): The emotion feels real, and everything just works together to make this a really well-realized emotional climax of the album.

**jaztinax** (8): this is the audio version of a late night hook-up in a pitch black room with a hint of red mood light with someone you’ve known for 2 weeks

**ormysonormysonormys** (8): thank fuck

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): Doja proves in this song that she can rise to heavier thematic material when she wants to.

**RandomHypnotica** (8): can't stop thinking about akane calling this the inverse of streets and how right he is

**vayyiqra** (8): idk I'm always just vibing at this point in the album and not thinking too much

**waluigiest** (8): this is a different sound for her and I think it works - I wish she had pushed it further

**wasian-invasion** (8): ok this one's a grower

**fairytalehigh** (7.8): i can't help but feel like this song is just trying to recreate "streets"

**seanderlust** (7.6): yeah it's a rehash of streets but I really like streets so i'm okay with it tbh

**dropthehammer11** (7.5): this beat sounds like it could fit on a bryson tiller album and that is dope

**imbaby122** (7.5): i display average pophead behavior bc i dont like doja on low-tempo tracks but this is actually really good. dojas performance is fantastic and there’s enough going on that i forget it’s <100 bpm.

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): this one grew with a couple listens

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): its a lot darker musically than most of her other songs, a welcome change after the past few songs

**ignitethephoenix** (7.3): this is a little too mellow for me but it’s nice

**shipperondeck** (7.1): my fav part of this song is the end when the sparkly synths come in. i wish they were much louder

**1998tweety** (7): shes alright

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this grew on me ALOT it is v enjoyable

**TiltControls** (7): Solid track. Really allows Doja's vocals to shine

**Lipe18090** (6.9): ok, some good vocals

**runaway3212** (6.5): This song isn’t bad but it’s a bit mediocre compared to some other tracks

**IIIHenryIII** (6): can't remember what it sounds like, and I just finished it

**jackisboredtoday** (6): this is a song that i forget exists as i’m literally listening to it [2]

**jasannn** (6): the lethargic chorus brings all the energy that the chorus brought down

**modulum83** (6): essential "slowed and reverbed songs to get railed to" youtube mix-core

#not fans of bacon, possibly vegetarian

**BasedButta** (3.5): is this one of the fillers i heard you all talk about?

**pig-serpent** (3.5): The beat has a few neat moments but overall it's a boring song, and the part where Doja wails doesn't sound good.

**Alumineous** (3): I like the effect in the intro! Yeah, that all I got.

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): god this stretch of the album is just absolutely forgettable songs at least options is kinda good

OMG we love a not-Doja song going out! This song's metaphor is frankly confusing, but it does sound cool. Like "I hope I was your favorite crime" is such a good line that the first three times you hear it you're like "cool!" but then the fourth time when you get into it it's like "what?" anyway proving once and for all that the rool of cool does not necessarily pass to music this song flopped here failing to make a lot of impact. It's pretty fun but where in "1 step forward, 3 steps back" the metaphor seemed too simplistic, here it's too confusing and underdeveloped.

As a side note, why is everyone's favorite crime tax evasion? That's like such a boring crime, my personal favorite crime is breaking into highly guarded military facilities and stealing classified documents.

[frog note: my favorite crime is arson]

**Alumineous** (10): These emotional songs be killing me. Olivia, this is your bread and butter. Sing your heart out.

**musical\_pyn** (10): easily my favorite on the album, the best and most concise songwriting and a great take on the breakup story of the album

**nooodisaster** (10): I claim this one. Short, but heart wrenching.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): BEST BALLAD ON THE ALBUM I SAID WHAT I SAID. that final chorus UGH goosebumps everytime

**TiltControls** (10): idk why I love this song so much but her vocals are just heavenly

**akanewasright** (9.8): This is my token “non DL ballad I actually like” on this album

**jaztinax** (9.5): i ashamedly slept on this the first few months but wow this is so powerful

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9.5): When I first heard this song I didn't like it. But it has GROWN one me.

**poemforsmallthings** (9.3): itsbittersweettothinkaboutthedamagethatweddocauseiwasgoingdownbutiwasdoingitwithyouyeaheverythingwebrokeandallthetroublethatwemadebutisaythatihateyouwithasmileonmyface

**1998tweety** (9): shes cute

**AzettImpa** (9): ummmm this song is amazing??? more people need to talk about it & should've been longer

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): idk why but this does things to me

**CrimsonROSET** (9): the thing about me is i LOVE songs about how other people are shitty but they still like it

**FroyoFox\_125** (9): This ballad is great

**ManofOranges** (9): Probably arson

**runaway3212** (9): This album has way too ballads, but

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (9): it's a seven in my notes but this song deserves all the hype

**xavieryes** (9): given how i'm not a big fan of most ballads in this album, i feel like i'm not supposed to like this, but for some reason this one really works

**MrMoodle** (8.5): This would’ve been a banger on the Twilight soundtrack or something

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): Somebody told me that they thought this song was about pedophilia, and now I can’t unhear it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This is by far the best of the straight up acoustic ballads on the album. That melody is niiiiice.

**fairytalehigh** (8): the metaphor here is so stale... olivia has no business being able to sell it so well anyway.

**nlh1013** (8): the bridge is great

**ricki** (7.8): you better sing

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): same same but bonus points for the vocalllls

**agentofscranton** (7): if the entire song sounded like the bridge + final chorus it would be an 11 contender

**imbaby122** (7): ALL THE THINGS I DID ‼️ JUST SO I COULD CALL YOU MINE ‼️ nothing else in the song hit that emotional peak. that single line ate up the entire song.

**just\_thonking** (7): I am docking half a point because it sounds identical to Enough For You

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7): came and went quickly

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): The only truly weak song on the album. The metaphor just doesn’t work at all.

**vayyiqra** (7): the harmonies are really nice on this

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): Okay it’s, like, subjectively good, but at this point in the album I am soooo exhausted of the endless love songs, like seriously there are only so many ways to say “I’m sad that you left me” before it gets super repetitive

**waluigiest** (7): okay I actually truly forgot this existed

**ignitethephoenix** (6.8): the bridge / ending truly saves this song

**Lipe18090** (6.6): and less this. the lyrics are ok tho

**Stryxen** (6.4): google docs (uk) keeps underlining favorite please add a u to the ballot thank you

#the police

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): meh, could be better

**iniekcja\_** (6): I really lost focus during this one

**jman457** (6): could be better

**qazz23** (6): i like the rapid-fire vocals on the bridge

**ReallyCreative** (6): when she actually decides to do something this song is pretty good!

**IIIHenryIII** (5.5): pop songs with acoustic guitars are always a hit or miss for me [2].

**frogaranaman** (5): I don't really like pointing this out because it's not as common as people think it is in the industry, but… yeah, this sounds like some of it was written to become a Tiktok sound.

**welcome2thejam** (5): Hmmm, haven't done it, but I suppose I'd say shoplifting.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (4.5): Do people hype this one up? It hardly does anything for me, but I hear that the potential of a great emotional number is there

**shipperondeck** (4.2): my lovely hapa sister this is the THIRD TIME you've killed your momentum with a lowkey song. ok the dissonance is not as bad from jealousy jealousy to this one but i also don't really care for this song in general so.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (4): Really kills the energy for me between jealousy jealousy and hope ur ok

**DirtyRat583** (3.9): the harmonies are at least something

**CarlieScion** (3): second degree break up

**DefaultPophead** (3): I really hate her songwriting. Good for you if you like it, I guess I can understand its merits, but my score has to reflect my true opinions. And I hate it. Every time I say I don't like her songs people just tell me I don't "get it" or I just don't like it because I "can't relate" or "don't know what it's like" but that doesn't matter. I think this album is criminally overrated, especially for its songwriting.

**ebooks #5454** (3): WHY IS SHE SCREAMING

**bookthieving** (2): reminds me of hey there delilah (please don't sue olivia)

**steelstepladder** (2): put a gun to my head and ask me how any of these ballads go, I will be dead

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): girl when does the song even BEGIN

**Awkward\_King** (0): i thought doja's bland songs were gonna acquire my 0 but it appears this is even blander

**you2009** (0): me when I first learned what a metaphor was

#reported to the IRS

**RandomHypnotica** (7.7): my favourite crime is tax evasion

**jsonphile** (7.5): mine is tax evasion what’s yours?

#this is so true bestie

We have now arrived at the worst choice for a single in all of this rate, a song that completely deserves day 1. Part of me wants to defend this because,  although it might be boring and uninspired, it's not the song straight from hell it was made out to be by some people. However, even ignoring the weird line about a job that may or may not be there, this song is just dull. It doesn't go anywhere and its lyrical contents might be even less impactful than its sonic ones. In theory, a twerk anthem saying goodbye to a toxic ex could work and it has worked, think of songs like "We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together" or "You should be sad." But "Lost Cause" does not nearly match the fun energy of the first or the angry energy of the latter. It just stays in the middle and this prevents it from becoming something interesting.

---

#makes fun of the jobless

**KingPony** (11): Giving it an 11 cuz oml the baseline. eat shit popheads this is a bop.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The twist of the rate is that this song wins

**Alumineous** (10): Drag his ass, Billie.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): oh so when doja calls someone out for not having a job it's funny but when Billie does it it's "privileged" and "insensitive" (mild /s)

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I can’t believe Twitter and r/popheads tried to tell me this was bad. Y’all LIED. You spread FALSEHOOD.

**joeeswift** (10): rip my day 1 solider </3

**tickframe** (10): my all-time favorite billie song, it's just SO good in every way

**you2009** (9.5): classism meaning she sounds very classy here gimme more of that classism I need that

**ebooks #5454** (9): damn billie getting a job isn't easy in this market (relieved to be employed or else this song would've given me major psychic damage)

**fairytalehigh** (9): she really sells it vocally here

**hikkaru** (9): this is gonna be robbed but it's so catchy idgaf

**N454545** (9): it really hits on the album ngl

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9): a kick to the jaw

**Awkward\_King** (8.5): who up queering they bait

**Iris3271** (8.5): We've all done charity work

**modulum83** (8.5): is this findom

**MrMoodle** (8.5): I dunno why we all collectively decided to take a massive shit on this when it released. I get why people didn’t like the video for not matching the chill vibe of the song, but the bassline 100% fucks and the song isn’t even that lowkey? Like it’s pretty unambiguously boppy imo. Anyway this is going Day 1 for sure right lol

**emayzee** (8.2): didn't deserve the dragging it got

**celladonn** (8): This has grown on me, it definitely works better in the context of the album

**CreepyMannequin** (8): I can definitely think of a few people I’d like to dedicate this one to.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): hot take, this is good actually! Get a job, do that challenge!

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): Something about this song is such a vibe

**jaztinax** (8): i feel like i was the only one who liked this song when this came out. still thinks it’s good although it doesn’t do much

**jman457** (8): Honestly sounds a lot better in the context of the album, the guitar in this is such an ear worm

**jsonphile** (8): it really grows on you. That is a pretty slick bass line

**just\_thonking** (8): This was definitely overhated when it came out. I was also underwhelmed on first listen, but at some point it clicked, and it works really well in the context of the album

**Lipe18090** (8): lacks a good bridge

**musical\_pyn** (8): this chorus might be my favorite on the album honestly

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): I often feel like a lost cause, and this song reminds me that at least I have a job.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (8): not my favorite but it doesn't deserve the hate it gets

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): C’mon guys that one line is not bad enough to ruin the whole song

**waluigiest** (8): the technical production really shines here.. Billie’s voice sounds incredible in the mix.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): I want to give this a 10 because it’s so overhated and caused so much dumb controversy, but I don’t think it’s one of the best songs on the album. So it will settle for a nice 7.8

**RandomHypnotica** (7.8): i didn't like this song until one of my friends covered it

**ricki** (7.8): remember when billie released this and poisoned our water supplies, burnt our crops and delivered a plague upon our houses?

**akanewasright** (7.5): What is there to say about this song that hasn’t already been said, besides anything about the song itself? No but fr I’m exhausted at the idea of talking about this after all that discourse over nothing

**MassiveThief** (7.5): grew on me a lot. this kinda bangs.

**shipperondeck** (7.5): one of my favorite moments on the album is near the beginning of this song: "cause i'm losing track of time (time)" and she does it with other lines too but this one is like perfect to me for some reason. anyway overall i do like this song and wish it wasn't (in a way) marred by absolutely pointless controversy

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): honestly the worst thing about this music video was the beige sacks everyone was wearing

**TheQueenofVultures** (7.5): A weird single choice but didn't deserve the backlash when it came out

**wasian-invasion** (7.5): ariana gay lizzo black marina fat shawn poor billie classist

**dropthehammer11** (7): i honestly thought this song was going to be a lot bigger. just felt like it had what it took to really catch on. i still enjoy it, groovy little track

**emmaelf** (7): i like the 'thought you had your shit together...' bit onwards. the verses feel like a let down.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): this is kinda nice actually

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the amount of discourse this song caused is astounding. Barely anything happens in it or the video. I can’t remember more annoying discourse

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): this song is not interesting enough to justify the weeks of discourse it caused

**nooodisaster** (7): Look past the controverisial lyrics released during a global pandemic, look past the god-awful mis-match of a music video, and see what this song truly is... mid.

**oscarbrierley1** (7): feels like its missing something, i feel like i'd probably love it if someone with a bigger voice sang it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): tiktok kids calling this video queerbaiting would have died on impact if they ever saw tatu

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): i'll always associate this song with the popheads discourse of "you've got no job" bc ya'll get offended over everything and didn't understand what she was talking about

**TragicKingdom1** (6.5): this video truly provided some of the most insane pop discourse ever

**babadork** (6.4): That second verse is vicious.

#is the jobless

**DefaultPophead** (6): This song makes me feel poor.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): melody is shit but the lyrics are fun

**frogaranaman** (6): didn't even need to check her Wikipedia page to know that her parent's names are blue there

**imbaby122** (6): i don’t hate this song as much as everyone seems to i just think she went too easy on this man! can we bully stinky men a little harder?!?!

**jasannn** (6): its a snore and a vibe at the same time. its a snibe.

**ManofOranges** (6): I remember Billie getting dragged to hell and back for this song and for what? Like... it's fine. Not great, but not awful either.

**UselessTacooo** (5.5): A terrible single choice, but as an album track it works amazingly. Why she chose this as a single appals me but it's too late now.

**thedoctordances1940** (5.2): bad single choice but it's nothing worse than mid

**aldwin\_is\_here** (5): listening to this song at first felt like it absolutely sucks but upon the album's release, it gets better, although it's still not my cup of tea if ya know what I mean

**ktajlili** (5): this is the worst song on the album. it's not bad but it's...average. Reminds me of Ain't Shit minus the humor.

**QuaxlyDuck** (5): not as bad as it was made out to be, but still mediocre

**ReallyCreative** (5): Aly and AJ washed this

**seanderlust** (5): billie has a right to be angry, but this feels somewhat forgettable and maybe a little too mean?

**skargardin** (5): thinking of how this possibly was the worst choice for a pre-release single

**static\_int\_husp** (5): feel like Billie think's she's being incredibly biting, but "you got no job" doesn't hit as hard as she thinks. It's a pandemic girlie! Everyone lost work!

**TiltControls** (5): me trying to convince the sub that an ed sheeran rate actually would be a fun a idea

**vayyiqra** (5): I don't feel anything about this either way

**jackisboredtoday** (4.3): The discourse around this song was insufferable and misplaced. Song does suck though

**2dina3dworld** (3.5): this song is a lost cause

**pig-serpent** (3.5): This song isn't making fun of people who lost their jobs in the pandemic or anything it's just boring.

**1998tweety** (3): "queerbaiting" video aside this song is not great. The lyrics are meh (saying someone doesn't have a job isn't the drag you think it is), and the vocals are impressive either. Billie usually sounds somewhat bored but with more upbeat production like this song you kind of have to match that energy.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3): too sparse production, the more organic production works better on other songs on this album

**Stryxen** (3): this song isn’t problematic it’s just bland

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (3): ah yes here we go with the like six boring songs in a row

**cremeebrulee** (2.3): ?????

Okay lol y'all did not vibe with _HSM:TM:TS_, that much has really become clear. This song in the narrative of the show is like… not even that good. It's really forced to give Olivia a 'moment' so I cannot say I am too mad, it’s cute for what it is, nothing more nothing less. However, somebody mentioned we should’ve rated the comeback song from _Bizaardvark_ and I'm gonna say we as 2021 ult hosts really dropped the ball there, that would’ve been such a fun song to rate, although it would make the competition unfair as it would clearly steamroll. Anyway something to like forward to in the [whatever year Olivia makes an album] ultimate rate.

**RandomHypnotica** (5.5): if this was on SOUR it would be the weakest track by far

**shipperondeck** (5.5): ok the vocal melody in the verses this is actually pretty good. i've never watched hsmtmts but the core song, minus the really cheesy production, could fit into sour

**slimboyfriend** (5.5): She gave HSMTMTS a Sour C-side

**akanewasright** (4): so was it obvious the *entire* second season of HSMTMTS that Olivia didn’t want to be there or did she just phone in the songs she wrote for the show?

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): I haven’t watched any of this show…and I don’t think I need to.

**IIIHenryIII** (4): boring

**DirtyRat583** (3.8): i weirdly dont feel anything with this, the score just felt right idk

**PrimaryCrusaders** (3): There's some terrible clipping going on in some parts (in the YouTube version at least), sweet jesus.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (3): maybe if i watched the show id understand this better

**modulum83** (2.5): god this was miserable

**LesApfels** (2): This blowing up online is possibly the most unrealistic thing to happen in HSMTMTS

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (1): I did not need to listen to two different HSTMTMTS songs

"Payday" is proof that a song can be fun, exciting and interesting yet y'all will see a cishet man and immediately decide it deserves a low score. This song, I think, is just really fun; it just encapsulates the feeling of getting paid so well even if I have no idea what they're saying. The controversial part of this song seemed to be Young Thug's verse and I get why it's at the very least different. With that said, I think it's just really adding to the chaotic and overall strange energy of this song. It did not deserve such a low placement.

This song is so much less interesting than "Payday," smh my head but oh well. It's definitely not a bad song though, it makes sense it's high day 1. Doja's singing voice is actually really beautiful, her soprano really gets a chance to shine here. The dreamy instrumental adds to the lullaby feel of it all. On top of that, it’s not that unusual for this album, meaning you can fall asleep without missing too much.

---

#big on sleep

**fadedblue09** (10): A very soothing cosmic number and Doja successfully breaking the cliche that female rappers suck at singing

**fairytalehigh** (10): love doja when she does this really dreamy sound, it's sooooo good

**TiltControls** (10): My fave on the album. Not anything special, but it just sounds beautiful. Can't wait til it goes day 1

**sparklesandlight** (9.7): !!!!

**ReallyCreative** (9.2): one of my favorites??

**skargardin** (9): she actually sounds so lovely here

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8.8): i love slow song doja

**dropthehammer11** (8.5): underrated song, its so smooth n nice on the ears

**you2009** (8.5): puts me to sleep but in a nice way....for sure :)

**jman457** (8.3): A highlight on here for sure

**akanewasright** (8): I don’t think this song is very exceptional, but one time I was on a plane and had a nice nap to this song and it’s gotten stuck in my head a few times since then

**flavasavavandal** (8): Such a vibe

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): Surprisingly sad and introspective, yet I feel warmed by Doja's reflections

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): A chill bop that we love

**iniekcja\_** (8): the chorus is so reminiscent of some other song but I can't figure out what exactly it is

**Lipe18090** (8): god was this always this good!? the fuck i'm rediscovering this whole album basically

**UselessTacooo** (8): while not necessarily a career highlight, she’s a cute little song I can’t get mad at

**vayyiqra** (8): "you don't fuck with randoms" gets stuck in my head a lot

**ignitethephoenix** (7.8): the chorus is super nice

**DefaultPophead** (7.5): Really lovely, but still kinda boring.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7.5): i love the ballad vibes, and that's enough to break it from the plain 7s that plague this album

**1998tweety** (7): "i look a little like Nashe"...maybe that popheads thread was right

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): fine, I guess, it's too sad

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): Chill bop. The production stays interesting enough to support the song.

**MassiveThief** (7): loved at first but got tired kinda quickly. still a nice listen.

**modulum83** (7): i kinda dig how lowkey and laid-back this song is it's refreshing after the sheer fucking goblin madness of the first 6 songs

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): It’s fine, but it’s definitely a filler track.

**RandomHypnotica** (7): it's called love to dream because it makes me sleepy

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): its giving nicki minaj trying to make a pop song in pink friday

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): This feels almost… *too* normal-sounding for Doja

**waluigiest** (7): Kali Uchis could have slayed this song

**wasian-invasion** (7): is pretty but skippable

**welcome2thejam** (7): Started with high potential for this to be a bore, but I like some instrumental flourishes and Doja wrangles it back well enough

**BasedButta** (6.5): pleasant

**jaztinax** (6.5): this blends in with ‘i don’t do drugs’ so it doesn’t stand out to me

**AHSWeeknd** (6): It’s alright but it’s not on par with the other songs

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6): This is pretty I just wish it had stronger production. Also probably one of Doja’s most underwhelming rap verses.

**IIIHenryIII** (6): this literally put me back to sleep

**ktajlili** (6): jump in bed w/o my bonnet eh

**ormysonormysonormys** (6): you see so much potential in the album but so many of these songs are just “good”

**pig-serpent** (6): Fine ballad.  Sounds nice and I'll never think about it again.

#never sleeps. possibly anti-unconsciousness

**cremeebrulee** (5.5): omg no way i look just like tinashe too

**CrimsonROSET** (5): i mean it’s smooth but like, it’s also giving nothing

**emmaelf** (5): i just don't think doja cat can pull off the slower music, gotta be honest

**imbaby122** (5): doja sounds very lovely!!! but this kinda went in one ear out the other

**nooodisaster** (5): The production is actually really great but we've heard these lines before 10x times so idk the ballad feels frivilous.

**runaway3212** (5): this one vibes but also her voice is annoying sometimes

**Alumineous** (4): I like Doja pushing her boundaries with her voice. Showing her versatility. But the song is nothing special.

**jasannn** (4): more like love to sleep

**musical\_pyn** (4): this just draaaaags on and on

**Stryxen** (4): i got my feet on the ground and i don’t go to sleep to dream

**Uberpigeon** (3.5): is this dream pop

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (2): zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz

**plastichaxan** (1): so do i but now i hope i don’t dream about this song

**shipperondeck** (1): the beat really boring and is literally putting me to sleep rn. but i still like it. a single point for shouting out miss nashe

"hope ur ok" manages to be the highest placing of the non-single ballads from _SOUR_ (aka 90% of the album cuts), although still with not quite a high enough average to escape Day 1 and a couple of zeroes. Part of that is probably because it's one of the few songs on the album to not talk about her ex, and instead is a wistful, dreamy track reminiscing about her childhood friends and wondering where they are now. Some people found the sentiment of the song forced and insincere, but most can agree that it at least ends the album on a nice tone musically, and, in my personal opinion, that outro is one of the highlights of _SOUR_.

---

#also fans of "You Need To Calm Down"

**AHSWeeknd** (10): A good closer

**Alumineous** (10): Instruments are surprisingly good. Ugh, the lyrics. Now she wants him to be happier than when he was with her. That’s character development and a great closer to the album!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This feels like the kind of song that’s gonna get undeserved hate for even trying to address a serious issue. This feels very sincere to me.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): the ‘kim people are dying’ song

**ImADudeDuh** (10): she said “gay rights! but fuck one specific gay”

**majid** (10): this is easily the best track on this album

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): she is very gorgeous to me

**ricki** (10): she was on her lorde bag that day

**static\_int\_husp** (10): This is the Good In Bed of this years ultimate. I song I honestly love that I expect will be paid dust by everyone else. Also the bridge on this song is the Lorde-iest she's been on her music so far

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): this is probably a weird song to have as my highest score on this album, but god, i really teared up listening to this one. i unfortunately lost contact with pretty much all my friends i had when i was a kid, mostly because of my own issues with keeping in touch with others unless they reach out to me first, and every time i sit down and think about them all i can do is hope that they’re alright and living their best lives without me. this really hit close to home for me, it basically speaks all the thoughts i have on all the people i used to be close with. really good note to end the album off on

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): That bridge has some of the best lyrics ever.

**UselessTacooo** (10): this song is beautiful and doesn’t deserve all the hate it gets. The bridge is one of the best moments in this whole rate

**xavieryes** (10): I was not expecting this quality spike right at the end of the album, this song is fantastic

**RandomHypnotica** (9.6): yes the outro is literally a lorde song that's what makes it good

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9.5): I feel like i'm being gaslit into thinking “I address the letters to the holes in my butterfly wings” is like a thing that makes sense. Otherwise this song is very touching and showcases her potential for depth.

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): ok this song grew on me a lot, actually, at first i thought it was super hokey and BWBB-level out of place, but her vocal performance is fantastic and actually sounds genuine. it's on my pick-me-up playlist

**1998tweety** (9): lgbt anthem

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): very inspiring song to end your album, I must admit!

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): Just… beautiful lyrics in every way.

**jsonphile** (9): I’m a sucker for songs reminiscing about childhood and old friends so this just kinda hits. Plus that bridge is the best Lorde bridge we got this year

**nooodisaster** (9): No idea how the fandom sees this, but I've always loved it. The strings carry momentum and emotion, and Olivia's storytelling is clear and feels honest. A cleansing moment to end an album of so many storms.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (9): I’m glad she chose to end the album on this note instead of Favorite Crime.

**ReallyCreative** (9): it's not the most compelling song on the album but thank god it's about someone besides that damned boy

**sweetnsoursauce11** (9): feel like this song is underrated (understandable it's not the best song on the album) but it's v sweet and a nice closer

**TiltControls** (9): this feels maybe a little too personal to do well, but I really love the idea of the song

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9): ngl a bit of a snooze at times but i still love it a lot

**seanderlust** (8.8): vaguely gay rights!!!!

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8.7): does anyone know what the hell she's actually talking about in the bridge

**FroyoFox\_125** (8.5): This song is so sad but so beautiful omg

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): this one actually makes me tear up a bit

**jman457** (8.3): It’s a phoebe bridges reject but still shows promising lyrics

**modulum83** (8.2): really, the lyrics kinda suck, but this shit sounds vaguely like the midwest emo goth post-rock bullshit i listen to on a daily basis and i like that

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): gay rights!

**ignitethephoenix** (8): did more for gay rights than Taylor ever did with YNTCD

**ormysonormysonormys** (8): sour but Olivia Rodrigo doesn’t talk about Joshua Bassett

**skargardin** (8): such a a sweet closer

**vayyiqra** (8): me too whoever is reading this <3

**waluigiest** (8): okay I didn’t care for this song initially but it’s actually wonderfully relatable. I don’t know how she felt this way towards her classmates at age 17, but still.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Lovely, though I wonder if I feel more positive on this as a track with a change of pace topic & tone from the rest of the album

**Lipe18090** (7.8): good closing to an okay album. the bridge makes the song

**shhhneak** (7.8): It’s a good thing I have a soft spot for ballads.

**akanewasright** (7.5): yeah this song is actually good. It’s not perfect, but it shows a lovely caring side of Olivia, and I really appreciate that

**AzettImpa** (7): really nice closing track, I appreciate that it's more peaceful than the rest, the album would've felt unresolved & pessimistic without it

**bigbigbee** (7): This is fine (sweet message!) until those harmonies in the bridge hit, and then it gets really good.

**dropthehammer11** (7): while this song doesnt get as many flowers as the others, i appreciate the songwriting a lot on this one. some of my favorite on the whole record

**fadedblue09** (7): Tolerable but "I am proud you were created" sounds weird. And thank god it’s not another breakup song

**imbaby122** (7): something something gay rights something something butterfly wings. honestly impressed that this song somehow feels nostalgic it really fits the vibe.

**racloves** (7): this is cute ok. A lil bit cringe but she was like 17 I’ll let her off

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): “Hey Conan, I’m a little stumped on how to end my album, can you show me how you did it? No, I promise I won’t copy you :)”

**hikkaru** (6.5): avatar piano avatar piano avatar piano

**jasannn** (6.5): something avatar music at the outro something

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): Damn must be sad having a toe for a head :/

**jaztinax** (6): it’s fine and it has a super cute message but it’s also a bore

**musical\_pyn** (6): where's the conan gray credit

**shipperondeck** (6): lyrics are awesome. musically it's alright. the way it cuts off at the end scares the shit out of me bc there was one night when i was listening to this song in the dark and i thought something came into my room and was gonna kill me. it sounds dumb but it was a bad time. yes i can laugh at it now lol

#https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlVBg7_08n0

**IIIHenryIII** (5): such an unremarkable final track.

**Awkward\_King** (4): this is nice (thematically not musically)

**MrMoodle** (4): Phew Olivia confirms to the 35 year old gays streaming this that they are Valid and Not Weird for emotionally identifying themselves in a teenager’s tabloid breakup drama

**you2009** (4): really touching lyrics unfortunately the actual music is just ok

**DirtyRat583** (3.7): its ok. album wise, i dont get it, its sad but its also devoid of a lot of instrumentation. you can be sad but at least be sad with variety.

**cremeebrulee** (3.5): it's a weird way to close out the album and it's not something i relisten to but the outro is pretty

ph2021ultimate: **bookthieving** (3): is the "i hope that you're happier" lyric supposed to be a callback? i wish she had changed that, it comes off as insincere

**frogaranaman** (3): yasss giving "You Need To Calm Down" for a brief moment

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (3): why? it's a great song but it makes absolutely no sense in a teenage heartbreak album so i reiterate, Why?

**Uberpigeon** (3): olivia if you wanted to be an ally you should have made a good ending song instead

**DefaultPophead** (2): She really thought this was deep, huh? I appreciate that a lot of people probably connect to this, but I hate it. I must sound like an awful cow, but I really don't get what makes her stand out from others besides her "inspirations" coming through and giving people that familiarity and nostalgia factor.

**nootnoot781** (2): omg gay rights!

**2dina3dworld** (1): this is really the Chosen Family/Boys Will Be Boys of this rate. Good message, shit music.

**flavasavavandal** (0): I was tempted not to give a 0 out this rate, despite the worst of Planet Her, but this just makes me feel icky. This does not belong at the end of an album where she really went all in on her ex and subtextually this just feels more like emotional manipulation than a toast to old friends who you’re hoping are doing well to make her seem less like a diva. So yeah I hate it, it might not be the most unlistenable song in the rate but actually thinking about it makes my blood boil

**runaway3212** (0): nothing that works about this album is on this song, it’s terrible and I wish she would’ve never added it to this otherwise slay of an album

And here we have our final (and perhaps most shocking) day 1 elimination! A ballad that surprised everyone by being a huge hit (spoiler this will happen at least one more time on _SOUR_). While in many ways a well constructed song; its metaphor makes sense, it does not rely on too much lyrical simplicity, it's pretty. It does fail a bit to stand out among other _SOUR_ ballads of which there are just a lot. What's more is that it’s really similar to "Heather," a closeness noted by many commenters. This is a problem for "traitor," because "Heather" is a better (and not-unimportantly gayer) song which gives it a major disadvantage that it simply could not overcome.

#support Tiktok 2

**1998tweety** (10): https://vm.tiktok.com/ZMRSm1ngV/ I saw this tiktok and now I cant ever un-associate this song with it 💀

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The vocal layering >>>>

**Alumineous** (10): I disregard Brutal and consider this the intro track. It sets the scene so well. Start off the album with a vulnerable and broken heart while it slowly heals in all the catharsis.

**emayzee** (10): i can't even pretend that this bridge doesn't give me chills

**emmaelf** (10): i've been in this situation before and this song so beautifully describes the absolute shitshow nobody should go through. it's stunning work from someone so young.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I love singing the chorus to whomever hurts me just for the drama.

**jasannn** (10): I love how you can feel the insecurity in the verses that develops into a confident realization in chorus and the bridge.

**MrMoodle** (10): Get your lighters out boys 😔

**nootnoot781** (10): take me back to watching love island and watching white people embarrass themselves whilst this song played in the background.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): The ballad that proves you don’t need to add excess lurid drama to make a good breakup song.

**shhhneak** (10): the Sour Prom version >>>

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): I remember when I first heard this song I replayed it so many times it couldn't have been good for me mentally.

**bigbigbee** (9.5): I think this is the prettiest song on the album. I dunno, I know it’s nothing that unique. I just really like it.

**jaztinax** (9.5): this was my favorite song from the album for a really long time until happier took over recently. the way this song is built up is great and i love how melody-driven it is, yet it is also story-driven and still manages to be catchy

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (9.1): it's a bit on the whiny side but i pretend i do not see it

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): I like this less after hearing it so many times on the radio, but it’s still a very solid song. It evolves nicely.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This doesn’t necessarily give me anything the better singles on this album don’t. But it still hits tbh.

**ebooks #5454** (9): this song sounds really wonderful and genuinely im v grateful i can relate to absolutely no part of its content

**FroyoFox\_125** (9): The best ballad on the album even though it's not my favorite...

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): this song is such an anomaly to me. everything about this song sounds like something i should hate, from the oversinging, to the overdramatic lyrics, to the generic production, and yet…i cant help but really love this song? i think the main reason i love it so much is olivia just sells the delivery on this so hard

**TheQueenofVultures** (9): you BETRAAAAAYED ME

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is becoming so overplayed on the radio lately but it’s still a very pretty song

**xavieryes** (9): a really good ballad

**shipperondeck** (8.9): uh... relistening to this song for the first time in months for this rate and it made me much sadder than i remember. anyway, despite my criticisms of brutal relating to traitor, this song is also really really good

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): YOU BETRAYYYYED ME

**fairytalehigh** (8.4): there is something so gratifying about howling "YOU BETRAAAAAAAAAAAAYED ME" in traffic when someone merges in front of you unexpectedly

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): yeah this song screams taylor influence alright

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): why does this literally describe my first breakup when i was 16.

**wasian-invasion** (8): the way she sings so slowy and dramatically it makes it hard to take her seriously

**seanderlust** (7.7): this feels so immature but in a way that feels familiar. I feel like my friends and I would have been like this when we were teenagers. it's a little eye-roll-inducing but more in a nostalgic way

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (7.5): Some of Conan Gray’s best work

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): I love the concept of feeling like someone is a traitor even though they didn’t cheat. The song however is just okay to me

**imbaby122** (7.5): minus one point for “the bed we made” girl i promise it is not that serious he probably wasn’t even allowed to sleepover you were like 16

**jsonphile** (7.5): me in first grade when I see my best friend share his Oreos with another kid

**just\_thonking** (7.5): Should've ripped off Maniac instead

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Upon release this was my least favorite off the album and now I’m like…. Why?? Wtf was up with me

**TiltControls** (7.5): I like the melody and I don't mind songs that involve melodrama (see the rest of the album), but this is a bit much for me

**cremeebrulee** (7.2): if olivia is handing out writing credits for anything now, can i get some cause this is very reminiscent of my diary in 2014

**rotating3Dtext** (7.2): this sounds like a mix between a Taylor song and Heather by Conan Gray

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): i like how palatable it gets

**hikkaru** (7): this song is fine, nice even, but it being a hit instead of brutal... NOBODY moved

**ImADudeDuh** (7): its an okay song but yes i’m gonna be put in the section of people saying this was a bad single choice

**nooodisaster** (7): Melodically so smooth. Lyrically yeah she's an 18 year old.

**pig-serpent** (7): It's catchy but I'm not a huge fan of the instrumental.

**runaway3212** (7): This is just dollar store Heather, however, Heather is a great song

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): very beautiful very heartbroken very overplayed

**waluigiest** (7): we told you this was melodrama

#Conan Gray stans

**kappyko** (6): this really is just heather lmao

**musical\_pyn** (6): hook is great but olivia does this sound so much better on other album tracks

**ReallyCreative** (6): she's just a little possessive huh

**UselessTacooo** (6): at least the choir vocals are nice

**2dina3dworld** (5.3): distant chants of “balladphobia” can be heard in the background

**akanewasright** (5): Olivia: “hey can i copy your homework?” 

Conan, holding Heather: “sure but make sure to change some answers” 

Olivia: [makes the song straight]

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5): it's giving middle school breakup

**vayyiqra** (5): yeah I don't like the lyrics to this but am trying not to be harsh there. I do like the boomy sound of the drums and also the backing vocals. I think this is a bad place in the tracklist for it though.

**jackisboredtoday** (4.4): All the melodrama of an overblown ballad with none of the lyrical detail that made her other hits work, and it isn’t even particularly intense emotionally, so this is just the biggest slog to sit through

**thedoctordances1940** (4.4): the production is generally so boring here

**flavasavavandal** (4): I want Olivia to get over this breakup as fast as possible so she stops writing songs like this

**realitykenz** (4): fine song but really, really hate the way she says wit chu in the bridge
[/r/popheads/comments/thcrbt/2021_ultimate_day_1_day_one_elims_are_not_what_i/i17pzqc/]

=====

ph2021ultimate: **fadedblue09** (3.5): Really mopey and annoying.

**poemforsmallthings** (3.5): listening to this song all the way through is so difficult because it feels endless

**bookthieving** (3): setting these pissed-off lyrics to a downtempo piano ballad feels like a mismatch

**DefaultPophead** (3): Love has never sounded so unappealing. I'm probably on the aromantic scale, or simply my disgust for other people is just so strong it's corrupted me, but I just don't see why people even fall in love or delude themselves into believing they are in love, if this is just how it's going to end up??? Even if I wasn't a romantic black whole, these lyrics are so bad it makes me embarrassed. I know this is probably fictional, but why does she pretend to understand how someone else feels or what their intentions are? I can't get into the story.

**frogaranaman** (3): jesus fucking christ here we go already

**majid** (3): sorry there's nothing interesting in this song

**Awkward\_King** (2.5): dude youd broken up fuck whoever you want

**you2009** (2.5): one of the many singer songwriter songs on this album with a lack of melodies to make up for my lack of interest in everything else

**Stryxen** (2): boring disjointed mess and a completely unsatisfying chorus, at least it doesn’t sound unpleasant

**welcome2thejam** (1): Absolute momentum killer, how you follow a fun track like Brutal with this slog?

**jman457** (0): The energy from the first track grinds to a halt, it just shows this album felt a little thrown together to capture on the drivers liscense hype

**modulum83** (0): i am reminded of the song DO YOU DOUBT ME TRAITOR by Lingua Ignota, which is still somehow less troubling and concerning for the artist's psyche than this song is for olivia rodrigo's relationships

**ricki** (0): olivia stand up this is embarrassing olivia stop it you're making a scene olivia no stay silent you're a mess right now someone get her a glass of water please olivia get up people are looking at us

**Treecoh** (0): this is so whiny

**Uberpigeon** (0): the way the music cuts out makes bile come up
