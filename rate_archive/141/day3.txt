On April 28th, 2021, Billie Eilish announced that her new album _Happier Than Ever_ would be dropping in a few months, and she would be dropping a new song the next day to go along with it. That song was "Your Power," and boy was it a statement. A lot of reactions to the track were mixed to say the least, with a lot of people being surprised that a song like was pushed as a single. But really, as would become clear with the whole album, Billie was making this album for herself, and when considered through that lens, pushing this song makes perfect sense. The song is brutally honest and painful, with lyrics that make your skin crawl and Billie's delivery feels particularly emotional here, with lines like 'how dare you?' lingering in my mind longer after I've listened to the song. Billie said that she wrote as an open letter to those who abuse their power, hoping to inspire some sort of change, and making it such a prominent single really amplifies that statement to the widest possible audience, and it’s nice to see that r/popheads appreciated that message enough to get this song to Day 3.

---

#uses their power to an appropriate extent

**OliviaGodrigo** (11): Every second of this song sends a chill down my spine. Her candid lyricism is incredibly haunting as it navigates the troubles of a young girl being manipulated by a man much beyond her years. Billie croons in the chorus, carefully stretching out each syllable, cautioning her ex to be careful with his power as a grown man unless he wants his crimes of emotional abuse and manipulation to catch up to him. It truly upset me when her fans were criticizing her choice to release this as the lead single of the album when Billie made it clear time and time again that she never enjoyed being pressured to release a hit. The release of this as a single clearly wasn’t to get a smash hit with a song as heavy as this, rather to establish her mature image and sound for the era in the most scathing way possible. In a way, this is a warning to every older person in a relationship to tread carefully when dating someone who’s much younger, or hell—don’t do it at all.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (11): This song is so important. Beyond her crappy ex-boyfriend, even beyond the other abuses of power that she and other people that she knows has suffered-- this song is so fucking important. The message "try not to abuse your power" is spoken both to the shadowy sexual predator, to herself, and to the listener. We need to protect people and hold ourselves accountable for the power that we all have.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): the best way to describe this is song is by using that picture of Mike Wazowski singing

**akanewasright** (10): I think about the way Roger Ebert viewed artistic criticism often, how he always tried to see, before making other judgements on whether he liked a film or not, whether it achieved its goal artistically. I think about that with music often, because sometimes music isn’t solely meant for aesthetic pleasure. This songs lyrics are meant to disturb you, and the song does everything it can to highlight those lyrics. And once again, there are very few songs on pop albums that have made me sicker to my stomach than the line about the kid who wakes up from an intimate encounter and has to go to class after. (And also I like this sonically a lot, I’m no Ebert lmao)

**Alumineous** (10): First, vocals. Her first note caught me off guard. Lyrically... I guess cheating and taking advantage of someone's love is a powerful thing. You only do it intentionally, not accidentally. Right, Doja?

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I agree with Todd, this song > happier than ever

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t know if I’ve ever heard a song I would describe as “constricted” before but…yeah the snake in the music video was a great visual for this.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): todd spilled you people will one day see the light

**fadedblue09** (10): A very refreshing switchup from the rest of the album, and very intimate as well. 11 contender right here.

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): This song is so great. The guitar is gorgeous and the melody is so pretty

**ManofOranges** (10): Probably the most beautiful song on this album. I don't dig a lot of the other songs on this project because I feel like they're just too slow and too underwhelming for me to appreciate fully, but this song has something in it that just latches onto me. It's just something extra biting, extra enthralling, and extra salient about this one.

**modulum83** (10): bon iver re:stacks but with extra trauma

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this song is so gorgeous

**skargardin** (10): such a pretty song

**Stryxen** (10): it just makes me ascend

**thedoctordances1940** (10): genuinely just a gorgeous song

**UselessTacooo** (10): One of the most beautiful songs released in 2021. It has a way worse reputation than it deserves.

**vayyiqra** (10): Wasn't expecting this acoustic song to be one of my favourites on the album but it's so beautifully written (and sad).

**waluigiest** (10): this is another turning point in the album, and I think it’s where things start ramping up to the title track. Beautifully done.

**welcome2thejam** (10): Uses her voice to perfection

**you2009** (10): most beautiful singing I've ever heard her do so emotive and lovely which is what convinced me to actually memorize these lyrics so I could sing along

**RandomHypnotica** (9.8): absolutely scathing

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): Both Harry Styles and Billie Eilish tried to make Bon Iver-sounding songs, and only one did a good job. Also, the lyrics on this are just phenomenal. One of the best written songs in this entire rate, maybe even the best in all its understated glory.

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): I’m so glad she singing about this topic

**jsonphile** (9.5): I felt so vindicated when Todd in the Shadows put this near the top of his list after everyone in popheads was saying it was boring

**bluexplus** (9): lol the mgk version is kinda good too ... idc

**Iris3271** (9): Hard to listen to in a good way

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): i like it and lyrically, i can feel it

**AzettImpa** (8): very cute but don't love the mix, could've been a 10 tbh

**IIIHenryIII** (8): powerful

**nooodisaster** (8): A song that stays with you, festering.

**pig-serpent** (8): I was really not sold on this song at first but the guitar comes in strong after the fade out and overall low point (mood, not quality) of the album that is Everybody Dies.  Sequencing really makes this song pop.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): The most honest, authentic song about dealing with a toxic man I’ve heard. Dua Lipa could never.

**wasian-invasion** (8): that opening guitar just gets to me everytime

**MrMoodle** (7.5): I’m so close to loving this but I don’t like how it sounds like her vocals were obviously recorded separately from the guitar, would’ve felt more earthy and organic if there wasn’t so much reverb on them

**ricki** (7.5): i wanted to leave a comment with incorrectly used aave and an excessive amount of sassy emojis but that felt tasteless, so just pretend i did do it but don't get offended by it

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): she ended him

**1998tweety** (7): alright

**dropthehammer11** (7): good ballad but why a single
[/r/popheads/comments/tiquew/2021_ultimate_day_3_dddaytrip_took_it_to_10/i1fqoi7/]

=====

ph2021ultimate: **fairytalehigh** (7): this song is difficult to listen to, honestly, like it's a lovely performance but knowing it's about her older ex... ick

**imbaby122** (7): men. why? for what? honestly? nah fr tho as much as this song is not my genre i gotta commend billie for taking such a powerful stand against abusers, it’s really brave especially because she has personal experience.

**ktajlili** (7): love her vocals but terrible single choice

**ReallyCreative** (7): the acoustic guitar was a desperately needed switch up but that's about it in terms of memorability

**TiltControls** (7): I like having the guitar here. Half-related, but for some reason when I hear the 'how dare you' line all I can think about is this one meme I saw like 8 years ago that just said 'first of all how dare you' but mispelled and I don't know who cursed me to have that random line stuck in my head for all eternity

**Uberpigeon** (7): i dont wanna feed more oxygen to... your power... your power... ladadadaa...

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I’m sorry I know this has nothing to do with the music and is slightly victim-blamey but seriously… Imagine having the knowledge and self-awareness to write a song like this… and then keep dating someone 10 years your senior when you’re only on the cusp of 20, it’s… it’s sad. Please, just stay safe, Billie. You may think you know the world but you don’t… no teenager does.

#maybe power _should_ be abused!

**bigbigbee** (6.5): this makes me want to listen to Garden Song. I know they’re not really similar, it just does

**oscarbrierley1** (6.5): i usually like her more acoustic songs but this one doesn't really click for me

**racloves** (6.5): obviously I completely agree with the message but since it’s a bit of a dark topic it’s not a song I find myself listening to

**shipperondeck** (6.4): this is a really good song but i can't think about it a lot.

**CarlieScion** (6): it has some pretty moments

**frogaranaman** (6): barrelcat

**lost-ln-the-echo** (6): great lyrics but I feel like this would be so much more effective if it was a bit punchier, like the title track

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5.8): i like the lyrics but don't like everything else

**jman457** (5.5): Honestly not my fav of the pre-release singles

**MassiveThief** (5.5): I love the guitar lines but everything else is just ok

**N454545** (4): I'm a 100% certified Billie stan but this is giving Jack Antonoff please stop

**DirtyRat583** (3.5): to the label exec that chose this to be the song to release with the album announcement: i hope ur beds always uncomfortable and your cereal always tastes bad

**nlh1013** (3.5): also boring

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (2): That guitar riff made me so hopeful for the song. Boy, was I disappointed.

**runaway3212** (1): im soooo bored

After teasing the song randomly on an Instagram live, Doja Cat had an instant hit on her hand with "Ain't Shit" (known as N.A.S. at the time). It was easily her most anticipated snippet for the era and had several viral Tiktok sounds attached to that IG live snippet ('I SAID: THAT'S NOT CHEATING IF I WASN'T WITH YOUR ASS, BITCH!'). After months of teasing, the song finally popped up on the _Planet Her_ tracklist and MAN did it deliver for nearly everyone who payed attention to the snippet.

However, in this rate it fell pretty flat. I would not know why; I think this song is incredibly fun and one of my favorites off the albumm. Doja has so much energy here and she seems both genuinely mad at this stupid fucking guy and like she really does not care that much, which is such a hard balance to achieve but she gets it pretty perfectly. A song that definitely deserved Day 3, and probably deserved way better than #19.

---

#YOU SHOULD HAVE PAID YOUR RENT

**akanewasright** (10): I’ve essentially loved this song since she leaked it on IG live, and while I don’t return to it as much as my other favorites, this is an undeniable smash

**fadedblue09** (10): ended men

**frogaranaman** (10): my favorite song where I cannot sing the chorus!

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): *DJ Khaled voice* Another one! **BLACK PEOPLE WON**

**imbaby122** (10): the anti-men sentiments in this song offset doja’s redpill era

**jaztinax** (10): POPPED OFF

**jsonphile** (10): Billie Eilish told me I have no job. Doja Cat told me to go get a job. Now that’s motivation

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): get his ass

**MrMoodle** (10): Sounds like it would play during a sunset near the beach in a futurstic alien city, this is what I wanted from this album

**musical\_pyn** (10): yasss I love bennie and the jets

**runaway3212** (10): Doja making slays like this really makes you wonder why she put songs like I dont do drugs on the same album

**TChalla1966** (10): if woman wasn’t on this album this would’ve gotten my 11 it’s everything and more something to sing with the girls

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Doja is always fun when she lets loose like this, best troll in the industry

**tickframe** (10): now come on now

**TiltControls** (10): the consistent beat reminds me a ton of Frank's Super Rich Kids (which is also a 10). Doja does a fantastic job with her delivery here. One of the best on the album

**you2009** (10): clearly the unemployed man had bad vibes so I'm giving classism a pass this once

**RandomHypnotica** (9.3): my favourite song to not sing along to!

**cremeebrulee** (9.1): god i fucking hate men

**mysario** (9.1): darn shame this beat ain't shit

**apatel27** (9): A worthy successor to No Scrubs

**fairytalehigh** (9): the chorus is a goddamn masterpiece

**ormysonormysonormys** (9): masterpiece

**ReallyCreative** (9): Doja gets a little unhinged in this one and honestly, work

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): spill

**UselessTacooo** (9): this was the centrepiece of my summer for absolutely no reason.

**wasian-invasion** (9): i love singing along to half of the lyrics :)

**1998tweety** (8.5): that 2nd verse whew, bop. I will selectively drag Billie for making fun of someone not having a job but will not do the same for Doja 😊😁

**babadork** (8.5): Love the 90s vibe, but I would not let anyone else get away with that laxative line without taking some points off.

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): It’s like Lost Cause but yassified

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): speak on it!!

**jman457** (8.5): I feel these lyrics in my bones

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): fun and playful but because of this song I almost said the forbidden N-word for an Asian like me..

**Alumineous** (8): This one made me laugh, which is something that the YUH song didn't do so good job! Message is clear. Don't. Piss. Doja. OFF. I hope Doja doesn't see my album average.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): The Guy With No Job stays losing in this rate.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): banger

**Stryxen** (7.8): mostly for the toad scream

**seanderlust** (7.6): I absolutely love the Elmo delivery of the second verse's end

**2dina3dworld** (7.5): I originally had this at about a 5 but that “go get a job” line made me chuckle and for that it’s now a 7.5

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): okay but "GO GET A FUCKING JOB!" is pretty funny

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7.5): This one can get a little too memey but Doja somehow stays on track with ease and convinces me to grow fonder of this

**AHSWeeknd** (7): I don’t get the hype for this 😭

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): Really vibey and fun. This is a much better slow song than the previous two tracks.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This is fun but that “laxative” line takes off a few points by itself.

**DefaultPophead** (7): Ain't Shit + Lost Cause = Men exist, unfortunately.

**ktajlili** (7): laxative

**nooodisaster** (7): She overhyped this song wayyyyyyyyyyyy too much for a song that's half a No Scrubs :///

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): A song that 95% of popheads should not be singing

**racloves** (7): no lies were told in these lyrics

**slimboyfriend** (7): Apart from the great Toad Scream, it’s pretty good but also a little unremarkable

**waluigiest** (7): I didn’t forget about white tiktok deciding this was their song when the album came out!!! I did not forget!!

**welcome2thejam** (7): Happy to see Doja get some personality back on this one

**Lipe18090** (6.7): repetitive

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): i can def see why people would latch on to this one, and i still think its a nice little tune, but the lumbering beat doesnt get my juices flowing fully

**modulum83** (6.5): i have come to the conclusion that olivia = gaslight, billie = gatekeep, and doja = girlboss

**shipperondeck** (6.5): for some reason after "laxative" (lmao) it feels like her audio cuts off really abruptly and now it annoys me any time, same with the fade-ins for every chorus. this song is funny and super entertaining, but it's never really hit for me music-wise. love the toad feature

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): I remember a lot of hype for this when it released and I don’t get why. Its fine but nowhere near my expectations

#GO GET A FUCKING JOB!!!

**emmaelf** (6): the title made me really hopeful but this song is just repetitive, which is a shame because there's a good song in there somewhere

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Hate when I hear a great sound on Tiktok but when I listen to the rest of the song it’s not actually that good…

**shhhneak** (4.4): Why is this lowkey giving Hamilton vibes (derogatory)

**CrimsonROSET** (4): it could be his personality!

**IIIHenryIII** (4): the title speaks for itself

**plastichaxan** (4): i mean she spilled but why couldn’t she spill AND make a good song

**ebooks #5454** (3): this is just super rich kids..?

**ignitethephoenix** (3): I love the lyrics of this but I can’t stand her voice on here (especially on the chorus) and it’s such an awkward tempo. It’s just kind of painful to listen to outside the first verse.

**pig-serpent** (3): Describes the 2nd half of this album, yeet

**xavieryes** (3): worst song on the album, and the only non-bonus bad one

**vayyiqra** (0): Might be a bit surprising that I've been giving such high scores to this album but am 0ing this. I find this song very grating and annoying, the worst part being the obnoxious singsongy way she says "get a fuckin' job!". Doja you can pay your own rent you are very wealthy and successful. Anyway I hate this song! The only one on this album I don't like.

The amount of times I heard this song in the background of some random reality show is too much. It's such a perfect song, it really knows what it wants to do and does it perfectly. It's chill, while not being too boring. Lyrically, I especially love the line 'I'm not sentimental but there's something 'bout the way you look tonight.' It's such a clever line and delivered in the perfect way.. ugh, this song is so good. It's equal parts seductive and secretive, and captures a racy romance incredibly well.

---

#fans of "Castaways" by The Backyardigans

**emayzee** (11): this song sounded like a classic even from my first listen. everything from her vocals to the guitar to the strings is so subtly beautiful, but combined it's a knockout

**nlh1013** (11): just obsessed with this it makes me want to sexily slink around my apartment

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She needs to do a whole slow-jazz inspired pop album, this is genius

**akanewasright** (10): the classiest sounding song I’ve heard involving filming a sex tape

**Alumineous** (10): Give your boo your full undivided attention, that's right.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This sounds luxurious in a cheap way. I love it.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i mean this is like the closest we’ll get to rating a brazilian artist in a main rate so i guess i’ll take it

**ignitethephoenix** (10): a slow grower, but this is definitely one of the best songs of the album. Billie aces the sensual tone of this I think this best encapsulates her transition to a more mature sound

**jaztinax** (10): this could easily be my 11. It’s so smooth, sensual, pretty and all the nice things

**ManofOranges** (10): Billie put her whole foot into this damn song

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): so in 2020 I found a fan edit of Everything I Wanted to a Bossa Nova beat. After hearing it I *wanted* Billie to do Bossa Nova, but I never imagined it would actually happen. I'm assuming (given how highly online Gen Z are) she saw it and liked it enough to do it herself.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this isn't what the stans meant when they said "come to brazil"

**runaway3212** (10): This song is so boppy and vibey she really did what she needed to do

**shhhneak** (10): Can’t emphasize how much I like this sound compared to her first album.

**UselessTacooo** (10): Billie hits the most when she keeps it simple, and this is proof. I considered giving this my 11 but ultimately passed it to another song

**fadedblue09** (9.5): A different sound style that suits her surprisingly well

**imbaby122** (9.5): hot. sexy. yeah.

**MrMoodle** (9.5): The “I’m not sentimental but-” hook is super entrancing. Maybe not the most innovative bossa nova track I’ve ever heard but I’m so glad we get to hear Billie’s vocals in these different contexts, she kills it.

**modulum83** (9.3): would definitely fuck to this one

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.2): I’m not sentimental, I’m not sentimental! I continue to insist as I slowly shrink and transform into a corn cob

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): one of my favorites off this album

**flavasavavandal** (9): an alright song

**FroyoFox\_125** (9): I really love the vibe of this song even thought it's probably nothing special to other people lmao

**ebooks #5454** (8.7): ooh italian vibess

**jman457** (8.6): There has been a lot of discussion if this is actual Bossa Bova, but idk bc it bops

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): Really cool and casually sensual. Makes me feel like the sexy love interest of the side character in the second book of a spy romance trilogy.

**static\_int\_husp** (8.5): billie is way better at the sultry style of singing than I imagined she would be

**you2009** (8.5): this not being bossa nova at all she is NOT coming to brazil

**shipperondeck** (8.1): first off i love the title of this song, my favorite alongside GOLDWING. keeps the classic secretive billie thing and, despite not being bossa nova, it's a good song

**1998tweety** (8): production is nice

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8): stan getz and joão and astrud gilberto eat your hearts out.... just kidding

**ricki** (8): https://c.tenor.com/rZ_CWQhsHo4AAAAM/selena-spanish.gif

**sweetnsoursauce11** (8): she did what she had to do

**waluigiest** (8): artists putting their names in titles is just so endearing to me

**wasian-invasion** (8): move over anitta the real brazilian pop girl is here

**xavieryes** (8): I remember when she was forced to exile in 1967 after playing songs criticizing the Brazilian dictatorship during the Record Music Festival in São Paulo. Her brother, Finneas, wasn't able to flee and was arrested a couple months later by the DOI-CODI accused of subversion and was tortured. During her exile in Paris she wrote this song while in severe depression because of what happened to her brother. The whole world was shocked by all of this and this song became a symbol for the redemocratization process and everyone remembers when she was able to play this live in 1973 in Copacabana right after returning from exile! It was epic! (Not OC I just copied this from some comment on a bossa nova remix of everything i wanted)

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.5): João Gilberto is quaking

**emmaelf** (7.5): love the chill bossa nova vibes and especially love the prechorus section

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): Mario Party minigame title

**AzettImpa** (7): they should've spent more time on it, love the title

**fairytalehigh** (7): this one's always kinda just been "there" for me

**IIIHenryIII** (7): too expensive for my taste

**lost-ln-the-echo** (7): a good song but a little underwhelming, I would've preferred this if Billie didn't whisper-sing the entire way through. I felt like it was building up a bit towards the chorus but nope!

**ormysonormysonormys** (7): sexy elevator music

**pig-serpent** (7): Bossa Nova is cool.  I should actually look into the genre's classics sometime.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): good but overhyped initially and i don't feel anything for it anymore

**TiltControls** (7): It's got a nice vibe to it

**vayyiqra** (7): Billie's weirdest song to me, but it's not bad. It makes sense that a song about pretending to be someone else would sound nothing like her other music.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): A bit cute

#fans of João Gilberto and "The Girl From Ipanema"

**babadork** (6.9): I am not sure that this is bossa nova and doesn’t just sound a lot like “The Girl From Ipanema.”

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): cute moment but not much more

**CreepyMannequin** (6.5): I always sends me that she named the title after the genre of the song, don’t know why.

**dropthehammer11** (6.5): i honestly never really heard the castaways thing

**nooodisaster** (6.5): its a vibe, very james bond spending his chase travel credits on a four seasons hotel.

**BasedButta** (6): as a brazilian that hates bossa nova i am PROUD to say that… this is okay!

**frogaranaman** (6): this wasn't even inspired by "Castaways"

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): sex

**Uberpigeon** (6): i was dissapointed with this song because i didnt know what a bossa nova was . i think i thought it was like....... a spanish flamenco song. so when this was not that.. i was like oh. i think i dont know what a bossa nova is

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (5): The beat sounds like it’s a preset on an electronic keyboard from the 80s, but other than that, the song’s… fine?

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the backyardigans - castaways ended this

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (5): This song is trying way too hard.

**darjeelingdarkroast** (3.5): falls flat for me, I guess this and the backyardigans got Americans talking about bossa nova i guess

The final Lil Nas X non-single to go, and I can definitely see why this became the highest rated out of all of them. It's a great time and it captures Lil Nas X's charms in music making well. It's not an "INDUSTRY BABY"-type of amazing song, but it does the pop rock style that's quite common on the album the best out of all songs that use it. Just an incredible bop.

#gay in the city

**apatel27** (11): It's just a neat track

**buzzyrecky** (11): im gay idc

**Own-Photograph-4642** (11): best track on the album

**akanewasright** (10): Me when im… lost in a citadel idk what this means I just like guitars and think Montero is hot

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): I’m not sure why Lil Nas X decided to do a rock song, but I’m all for it.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): God this really deserves a music video….

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (10): This is the guy who made Old Town Road?

**CrimsonROSET** (10): citadel is a dnd word i will not elaborate

**fadedblue09** (10): This feels oddly nostalgic

**fairytalehigh** (10): LNX gets a lot of shit for his non-rap songs but honestly, this is my favorite thing he's put out. very catchy and melancholic in the perfect way

**modulum83** (10): the secret to understanding this album is that it is sad as hell and the best parts of it are the darker, more intimate songs. case in point: this song encapsulates the feeling of a deep online relationship breaking apart and fading like no other song i have ever heard

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): The instrumental in this song is next level.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): me when im playing mass effect 1

**runaway3212** (10): Genuinely such an amazing song

**TiltControls** (10): This is the best song on the album and I'm not ready to see it leave day 2

**vayyiqra** (10): Weirdly I had the thought that this reminds me of "Such Great Heights" somehow. Idk, just getting a 2000s indie kind of energy from this song (positive). Also "citadel" is a really cool word yeah this comment doesn't make sense I haven't slept much but I really enjoy this song

**xavieryes** (10): Rick and Morty's impact

**BasedButta** (9.5): i feel a connection to this. if it went just a liiiiiittle bit harder this would be my 11 i think

**jsonphile** (9.5): maybe Lil Nas X needs to do more rock

**seanderlust** (9.5): this gives me elements of pop punk, elements of the postal service.

**emayzee** (9.2): lil nas in his early 2010s indie pop rock era is a moment most pleasing to me

**nooodisaster** (9): Love it.

**QuaxlyDuck** (9): for some reason i skipped this song until now. big mistake. Am I wrong for thinking the beginning is Radiohead-esque.

**skargardin** (9): If we were rating song titles, this would be the 11

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): lil nas x outsold every single pop punk revival track of 2021 with just this one song

**wasian-invasion** (9): best deep cut on the album

**welcome2thejam** (9): Me playing Mass Effect for the first time

**you2009** (9): I love that droning synth that sounds like a low brass note it really fits with the rest of the brass heavy sound on the album in its own way since this is a bit of a genre shift from the majority sound of these songs

**jackisboredtoday** (8.8): me when i got away from my parents in the big outlet mall as a kid

**1998tweety** (8.5): oh wow this bops

**DefaultPophead** (8.5): This is probably one of the best songs on the album tbh

**nlh1013** (8.5): I very much like this song

**jman457** (8.3): the production and lyrics on this are really good

**2dina3dworld** (8): those horns are very Plastic Beach

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): i like it a lot

**Alumineous** (8): Lyrics are a 10, not really feeling the instruments and melody.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8): A nice moment of unrequited crushing/ghosted after a month/you name it, backed with a really nice pop rock sound

**ignitethephoenix** (8): I feel like this is super underrated. Although it’s always been a fan fave I think so maybe not

**imbaby122** (8): it’s just good idk what to say 🙏

**musical\_pyn** (8): this is one of the songs on this album that makes me really excited for what lil nas x does next

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): Me to the music industry: More rock! MORE ROCK!! MUWAHAHAHAHA

**waluigiest** (8): Lost! In the Citadel

**celladonn** (7.5): There's a lot of great elements in this song but it just feels like something is missing. I think it would be better if the guitars and drums had a bit more heft.

**jasannn** (7.5): His flat/monotone singing voice here brings it down a little

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): I like the pop-punk instrumental but I wish it went a little harder

**frogaranaman** (7): coming for Olivia's wig a bit

**IIIHenryIII** (7): It feels like a grower

**N454545** (7): its a bop but it's too happy for me

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): is this folk rock? what??the? fuck??? it's good tho

#straight in the town

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): it slaps but in a calm way

**Lipe18090** (6.6): meh

**AHSWeeknd** (6): The pop-punk stans probably ate this up

**iniekcja\_** (5.5): wasn't this one of these tracks everyone was excited about?

**pig-serpent** (5): I like this one because it's a little faster but most of my issues with the album are present here and when a song under 3 minutes overstays its welcome uhhhhh there's a problem here.

**shipperondeck** (4.8): i put this on a character playlist last year so maybe i'm just hella tired of it but this kinda just bores me now, it sounds really cliche

Doja and Saweetie may be besties, but I guess r/popheads aren't. Honestly, this song feels like it's really being carried by the strength of some great chorus lines and Doja's verse, with Saweetie's verses feeling a little underbaked. It still managed to do quite well for itself, but I don't think it's either artist's best work.

Like I kind of have an active resentment for songs that are commodified as tone signals or mood setters for trailers and films, and I think I’m about to start actively hating this song because of that

Turning a meme into a song sounds like a terrible idea. I mean, just look at the faith of Tiagz, the producer known for turning popular Tiktok sounds into songs. After three songs, nobody even looked back on him and now he's practically forgotten.

What sets "Get Into It (Yuh)" apart are three factors: 1) it's good, 2) it actually tries to do something with the meme instead of just repeating it, and 3) in the video, she tries to rescue a cat and everybody loves cats. The high camp factor meant it was never gonna do too well, but it settled for itself nicely in day 3.

**bluexplus** (11): this song is tewww fun i love doja cat

**vayyiqra** (11): One of the catchiest songs I've ever heard, I love this. Even more impressive that she wrote it all herself. This song is just tons of fun! Get into it!

**wasian-invasion** (11): ive been caught singing this in my sleep so in honor of my subconscious this is my 11

**2dina3dworld** (10): flabster

**AHSWeeknd** (10): The process of listening to this song goes: She’s copying Nicki? -> Oh it’s a tribute -> Lemme replay! -> Did I leave the stove on??!!!

**akanewasright** (10): she put her whole pussy into this, to the point where there was none left for the rest of the album

**Awkward\_King** (10): this song is fucking electric

**AzettImpa** (10): maybe her best song yet

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Now it’s hard not to not think about Taco Bell when I hear this song. But also…I like Taco Bell.

**CarlieScion** (10): Ariana who

**CrimsonROSET** (10): akaneyola sometimes works ok!

**dropthehammer11** (10): got that big rocket launcha

**hikkaru** (10): where is this personality on the rest of the album omfg

**IIIHenryIII** (10): why's it so short???

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): no one knows what it means it's provocative!!! It gets the people going!!

**ManofOranges** (10): YUHHHH GET INTO IT

**MassiveThief** (10): still dont know what she's saying. still sing along everytime.

**nootnoot781** (10): i think this is the musical version of a lobotomy

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): This one is for all the bad bitches who go to church

**racloves** (10): this is so catchy it’s unreal

**RandomHypnotica** (10): the only words i understand in the chorus are "i just gotta bop get into it yuh" and honestly, so true

**skargardin** (10): her flow on this song >>

**TChalla1966** (10): oh did I get into it (yuh) summer bop

**you2009** (10): almost docked a point for the nicki shoutout but this isn't the time for me to be broadcasting women's wrongs

**fadedblue09** (9.5): I actually don't love this song that much but I don't wanna screw her chances of making the top 10 so….

**seanderlust** (9.3): okay i've decided this is actually really funny and deserves a fairly high score

**DirtyRat583** (9.2): doja may have forgotten how to speak intelligibly but she did not forget how to produce

**1998tweety** (9): BOP, maybe would like it more if it was longer but tbh that could kill it

**celladonn** (9): After considering at length whether this is great or annoying I have decided it is in fact great

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9): I like the way she says truck

**imbaby122** (9): ed sheeran seems like a cool dude but i think he was put on this earth solely so doja could say “call him ed sheeran he in love with my body”

**modulum83** (9): glad to see doja is a trekkie. wonder what she thinks of the new Picard season?

**plastichaxan** (9): too short

**Stryxen** (9): i’ve heard this in clubs too much you’d think i’d hate it but i somehow like it even more

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): If literally any other singer tried to sing like that it would be the most annoying thing ever but somehow Doja has the charisma and self-awareness to pull it off

**fairytalehigh** (8.9): this song has no right being as fun as it is

**jaztinax** (8.9): i didn’t know if i would end up liking this bc it has this bizarre quality to it, but it bops

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Works better than it has any right to considering how stan meme based it is; turning comedy into a banger is so her though

**iniekcja\_** (8.5): this was honestly a massive grower

**MrMoodle** (8.5): I feel like this wouldn’t have a chance of getting big even 6-7 years ago, I don’t wanna sound like a fucking Swiftie claiming Lover is an experimental album but the vocals on the chorus are genuinely pretty eccentric for something in the mainstream

**oscarbrierley1** (8.5): really needs a third verse to finish it off

**ignitethephoenix** (8.3): the audacity for her to reference Ariana and not even have her on this specific song

**shipperondeck** (8.1): a whole bop!! also so very doja to take a meme and turn it into this funny weird extremely entertaining song. also the mv for this one is one of my favs in the whole rate but maybe i'm biased as a star trek fan lmao

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): it's fun

**BasedButta** (8): oh shit *vibes*

**waluigiest** (8): ari out there quaking somewhere

**welcome2thejam** (8): Goddamn product placement works now I want a Chalupa

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): any song by a main pop girl that references Shape Of You by Ed Sheeran is going to get boosted for causing popheads pain

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): I want more whacko Doja on this album! Like wtf is she singing about?

**aldwin\_is\_here** (7): it's fun but not into Nicki Minaj related stuff, sorry

**ImADudeDuh** (7): not her ending the song by thanking nicki AF DJNAF

**letsallpoo** (7): i keep hearing this in that taco bell commercial and i always thought it was coi leray

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7): the only reason I'm familiar with this is because of advertising

**Uberpigeon** (7): this song grows off me with each listen

#YOU GUYS HATE FUN!!!!!!!!!!!!11!!!!!!!

**apatel27** (6.5): Sounds like a song full of adlibs and not in a fun fire in the booth kinda way

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (6): I feel like I shouldn’t like this song, but I can’t help myself.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6): This is simultaneously amazing and horrible

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (6): i'm in my overplayed phase rn, the song's good, but i am sick. and. TIRED

**jman457** (5.5): maybe a bit of interludephobia here, sorry Aria- I mean Doja

**nooodisaster** (5): ed Sheehan being in love with your body is not the flex you think it is

**ricki** (5): i hate it as much as i like it. I'll give it a 5 and let the lord place it wherever it has to

**sweetnsoursauce11** (5): i thought ppl were joking when this was released nd they loved it. sorry but i LOATHE the chorus bc of how she sounds. i do like the verses now tho and appreciate it's catchiness so i like it more than i used to.

**thedoctordances1940** (4.7): i'm sorry but I've never particularly liked this, the staggering delivery is just kinda annoying and it's just so short as well

**emmaelf** (4): i have to say nuh

**Lipe18090** (4): i don't like the way she sings in this one

**pig-serpent** (4): Was Doja sick when she recorded this?  Did she need some tea and honey?

**UselessTacooo** (4): In the past I would have 10’d this, but I've listened to it so many times that I dislike it now.

**runaway3212** (3): this is camp but also terrible

**TiltControls** (3): is that a loon at the start

**Alumineous** (2): Hmm, does shock value make this better than the previous tracks? Hear me out. I know Doja is a silly person who doesn't take herself seriously. Yeah, this track is interesting because it’s so ridiculous and on brand for her. But it’s ridiculous because it’s stupid. Does stupid and interesting cancel each other out? I don’t think so. I'm gonna admit that, in a rate full of serious songs that I fully connected with, this song really isn't my cup of tea. But that bridge was so dope.

**DefaultPophead** (2): Thank you Nicki? Yeah, unfortunately I can hear the influence...

**OliviaGodrigo** (1): This is unbearable

**CreepyMannequin** (0): Oof, HATED this one. I get experimentation but this was just annoying. Loved the shout0out to Massive Attack though.

After her earlier run in with philosophy on "Everybody Dies," Billie tries it again here to a much larger degree of success. ~~Maybe cause the song isn't actually all that much about philosophy.~~ Some guy thinks he is hot shit and she reminds him that he is in fact: not. It's such a simple premise, but sometimes a simple premise can make a really effective song as this one shows. It's just supper boppy, and the transition from "NDA" is \*chef's kiss*

---

#they think,

**2dina3dworld** (10): if I could choose an 11 from each album, then this would be my HTE 11. Bop and a half

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I wonder how many of the comments will mention Descartes

**akanewasright** (10): I really do love how this song basically nails it’s goal. Like… in context of the album and Billie’s life, you can tell that this song is *specifically* directed her abusive ex. But when this dropped as a single, we had no idea. So when she says all this about not having his name near hers, how “I don’t think I caught your name”, that’s not only a direct attack, it’s an attack that worked. This is laser focused at him, and it went over *everyone’s* heads

**Alumineous** (10): I like her attitude in this one.

**CarlieScion** (10): bop!

**fadedblue09** (10): Transition of the year I think

**ignitethephoenix** (10): philosophers be like

**MrMoodle** (10): Obsessed with that fatass growling bass thingy in the chorus. Kinda sounds like the Papers, Please theme song?

**plastichaxan** (10): sorry this was such a slay single idc who disagrees

**RandomHypnotica** (10): what other main pop girls are talking about Descartes???

**ReallyCreative** (10): Descartes has been real quiet since Billie dropped this

**Roxieloxie** (10): this is probably my favorite billie song

**skargardin** (10): the transition from NDA is just so chefskiss

**xavieryes** (10): great song and all but why didn't René Descartes get writer credits

**fairytalehigh** (9.5): rene flopcartes could never, western philosophy whomst? billie outsold

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9.5): this is the one song on this album that i have saved on my spotify lmao

**Awkward\_King** (9): this song just makes me want a massive pretzel

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): no thoughts head empty therefore I'm not

**CreepyMannequin** (9): Bop.

**DefaultPophead** (9): I have to give this a high score as a fellow René Descartes stan.

**emmaelf** (9): love the 90s/00s influences here

**ManofOranges** (9): Rene Descartes when he thought

**vayyiqra** (9): Forgot until now how much I liked this when it came out.

**you2009** (9): yes I did keyword search this song and "beyoncé" on twitter to make sure it wasn't just me who thought it was her whom billie sounded like when she said "what the hell are U talking about?" there's hundreds of us btw

**modulum83** (8.7): queen of philosophy

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): worst lead single to still be amazing ever

**hikkaru** (8.5): the transition omfg

**IIIHenryIII** (8.5): sorry, Taylor is already the man

**jsonphile** (8.5): Descartes be like

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): totally can relate to losers trying to profit off of my celebrity

**DirtyRat583** (8.3): the label exec gets spared for choosing this excellent song as a single, even if it was released 9 months before the album

**1998tweety** (8): bops a bit

**BasedButta** (8): spell in the form of soundwaves that makes you bob your head for exactly two minutes and fifty three seconds

**imbaby122** (8): A.I. generated billie song… i rlly like it tho lol she has a lot of personality on this track.

**just\_thonking** (8): Well I'm not

**Lipe18090** (8): transition is 10/10

**ricki** (8): she wanted a TikTok hit so bad

**runaway3212** (8): descartes is a little bitch

**shipperondeck** (8): new appreciation for this track as it segues from NDA... also the spoken parts are great. if anyone listens to vocaloid this reminds me of maretu's songs

**TiltControls** (8): I just think

**Uberpigeon** (8): this gets in my head constantly and for what

**UselessTacooo** (8): I’ve had this conversation with people before but I greatly believe this song would have been better if everything was sped up a bit. Try listening on YouTube with 1.25x playback speed. It’s weird but I think it’s better.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): My favorite thing about this song is that it uses the same sound effect that plays whenever your Animal Crossing villagers ask you a really dumb question

**waluigiest** (8): this was a bad single but fantastic in the context of the album

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7): This song doesn’t stand up super well to overplay but it’s still a bop!

**ImADudeDuh** (7): the way the best part of this song is the beginning when it switched from a different song

**nooodisaster** (7): when ur label tells u ur album needs a hit

**OliviaGodrigo** (7): That mall must’ve been going BROKE with how empty it was

**pig-serpent** (7): Terrible single that had me worried that this album would be B-sides of WWAFAWDWG, but on the album it carries the momentum of NDA into Happier than Ever very well and is an excellent part 2 of this little suite.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): If the song only stands out because the intro transition is good, it’s not a standout song.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): it's very fun and very overplayed, but i most often hear this song on shitty grocery story speakers and it always feels like a crime against humanity

**FroyoFox\_125** (6.5): I'm kinda sick of hearing this song :skull:

#therefore they are not

**aldwin\_is\_here** (6): you definitely don't deserve to be the highest charting track off this beautifully made album, fuckin' Bad Guy boring retread!

**ebooks #5454** (6): descartes type beat

**frogaranaman** (6): Descartes is shaking in his boots

**ormysonormysonormys** (6): it’s just bad guy

**oscarbrierley1** (6): tik tok has ruined this song for me and the spoken bits make me cringe

**QuaxlyDuck** (6): I think it's too stylistically similar to Bad Guy. Was afraid the album would be too similar to her debut, but luckily the rest is different enough

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6): this has grown on me alot

**xedophobic** (6): rene descartes is a disease

**AzettImpa** (5): sounds like a TikTok song iykwim

**CrimsonROSET** (5): like is it bad no but it’s for sure the worst song on the album

**jman457** (4.5): It just doesnt fit on this album at all

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (3): I had never heard those two songs transition into each other before… and that’s the most interesting thing about this song.

**welcome2thejam** (3): The one major blemish in the back half. Radio overplay as a slightly more uptempo Billie song hurts, but it only brings down what was already just a 5 IMO

**shhhneak** (0): This song annoys me in such a feral way like I want to hiss.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): this is just a rehash of everything billie already released with her first ep/album and yet manages to sound worse in just about every aspect

Dove Cameron wishes she could have a debut single as instantly successful as this.

Will I ever get how this became such an instant hit? Probably not. Will I forever YASSSSS over this song? Absolutely. It's such a heartfelt song, and I feel like what set Olivia apart in her early moments was just how much they felt like 'Olivia' songs. She really leaves her mark, despite being so clearly influenced by others. She takes these influences but also adds her own sound which makes it so great.

#can drive

**BloodDoorhinge4** (11): can't believe olivia invented bridges, move over cavemen

**nooodisaster** (11): Song of the year!!!!!!! Motherfuckers if this does not get #1 I will riot.

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now, classic.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): She really took America by storm with this

**Alumineous** (10): Y’all gonna hate this because it’s overplayed. Well, this is the first time I’m listening to the song and it’s a really good song. Look. Her voice is unseasoned and rough, which makes sense because she’s just getting started. BUT DAMN, her vocal delivery! I felt every single word and I’m a dark souled, heartless bitch. Sing your heart out, Olivia!

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): Whenever I haven’t heard this song for a while, I think it’s overrated. Then, I listen to it again, and I think it’s underrated. It’s a vicious cycle.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): hot take but this is actually the best of the singles

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Does the bridge still hit? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Lb-A756On8

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (10): This song is so overrated it’s underrated. Bridge of the year

**emmaelf** (10): i can see why this was such a huge hit. i love the everyday setting of it and the perspective of someone right on the brink of adulthood and independence. it's like a teen movie actually written by the teens. is some of it a bit immature in its writing? sure, but it's written by a teenager, what are people expecting? it's real. it's emotional. it's a genuinely fab song. and i feel like a real sheep.

**fairytalehigh** (10): my coworker went on a rant at one point in 2021 about this song "romanticizing toxic exes is NOT what we're going to do in 2021!" i was just like "girl she's 17"

**hikkaru** (10): what a moment this was

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I still don't understand why this became such a big hit, it doesn't sound like it.

**ImADudeDuh** (10): this was THE MOEMNT

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): got what the fuss is about, this is great

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): so I was absolutely not looking forward to getting my license and driving still terrifies me, but Olivia is really good at making you vicariously experience her little teen heartbreak

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i didn't get my license until i was 20, can't relate

**runaway3212** (10): Personally I never got how this was as big as it was. That said I love it so much

**seanderlust** (10): there's a great episode of the key notes podcast that goes into why so many people experience frission (goosebumps) at this song, and i think it really speaks to how smartly this was composed. the gut drop at the end of each verse? the smart use of o-rod's falsetto? perfection. this song deserves all its hype and more.

**skargardin** (10): I think we're finally ready to embrace this as the massive serve it is

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): was obssessed w this song from first listen, the bridge is 12/10. couldn't understand the weird discourse popheads had about its success bc i definitely was contributing to those streaming records.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (10): it's the song that made olivia the first disney-to-pop-princess of the 2020s aren't we proud

**throwaway-7650** (10): we love a song that was #OUT of the r/popheads top 100!

**vayyiqra** (10): yeah we've heard all the discourse about this song, I have nothing to add to it; it is just a great song and sometimes the masses are right.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): civil engineering didn’t exist before we heard the bridge of drivers license

**akanewasright** (9.9): I always dock 0.1 from this score because I do see every issue people have with it… but also this song is kind of incredible and even if the song doesn’t appeal to you, you know why it appeals to everyone else.

**ebooks #5454** (9.9): i miss the world the day this released

**celladonn** (9.5): That bridge still hits

**emayzee** (9.5): if this came out like six years earlier i would've been so fucking dramatic driving around alone listening to this song and thinking about my unrequited high school crush

**jasannn** (9.5): this is not a good karaoke song tbh, even when drunk.

**shhhneak** (9.5): I hate to admit it but this is a classic. The production still plucks on the heartstrings.

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): r/fuckcars

**Awkward\_King** (9): this song is overplayed yes but god its so fucking good

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this grew on me a lot over time, the slow build towards the end is so good.

**iniekcja\_** (9): me if I ever pass the exam

**just\_thonking** (9): YOU MADE ME HATE THIS SUBURB

**modulum83** (9): my crush left me for a blonde girl so what i'm saying is i feel an undying kinship with this song

**MrMoodle** (9): That BLONDE girl how DARE she, Olivia queen of bringing back 2005 internalised emo girl misogyny

**N454545** (9): iconic

**TiltControls** (9): It's been said before but I still don't get the massive success for this song. Still, it's got some good parts (especially that bridge)

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): Literally everyone when they get their drivers license even if some of them haven't even been through breakup.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): What a moment this was

**waluigiest** (9): something shifted

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): can’t believe my first reaction to seeing the fresh post  on popheads was to think this was overrated white girl nu-disco

**FroyoFox\_125** (8.5): Strong, iconic lead single that we all know and love

**jsonphile** (8.5): wow what a nice simple sweet song that I’m sure won’t cause hours of unnecessary discourse and grown adults wondering why they can’t relate to a song by a teenage girl about a teenage relationship

**plastichaxan** (8.5): 8 points for the bridge 0.5 for the rest

**pig-serpent** (8.3): The 8 I gave it in the Tiktok rate still feels right, but I like it just a little bit more everytime I hear it.

**shipperondeck** (8.1): lmao i used to dislike this song before i got my DL bc it reminded me that i still didn't have mine at 21. but now that that's done i can admit that i love this song

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): pretty sad, not gonna lie

**dropthehammer11** (8): first time i heard this song i was meh on it, didnt see the hype. overtime it has slowly but surely grown on me and now i get it. the eventual climax is a great pop moment

**imbaby122** (8): discourse aside i actually really like this song. i don’t think i’d ever admit that to anyone though lol.

**ManofOranges** (8): I still remember when this song came out and I didn't really give not even a single shit about it... To a degree I still don't. Drivers License is, I think, a middling song and one of the more boring ones on this album. But from a sheer drama and tragedy stand point, I do think it delivers.

**musical\_pyn** (8): one of my favorite moments of 2021 was driving home from my first post-vax party with friends and singing along to this song so I'll always have a soft spot for it even if the intital novelty has worn off

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): Everyone listened to this song at least 20 times last year, and everyone who didn’t is lying.

**Stryxen** (8): didn’t get your punctuation license though did you :/ do apostrophes mean NOTHING to you

**Uberpigeon** (8): the bridge is

**UselessTacooo** (8): I’m happy she got big, but could it have not been from one of her better songs?

**you2009** (8): bridge is killer even if the swearing sounds a bit forced. actually a fan of the lyricism in this one

ph2021ultimate: **CrimsonROSET** (7.5): i told you it’d be lower than when we scored it in tiktok!

**jaztinax** (7.5): i honestly don’t know why people raved so much about the bridge. it’s great, don’t get me wrong. but i saw MULTIPLE comments saying it was “like crack”??? maybe i just don’t get it

**jman457** (7.5): The bridge is amazing, but I hope it doesn't carry the song to far

**ReallyCreative** (7.5): baby we're gay people we don't have licenses

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): this is the third fucking time im giving this song a 7.5

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7): I loved it at first but it didn't age well for me.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (7): It wowed me a lot more right when it came out. Still a good track! Appreciate a bit of a catharsis moment

**racloves** (7): mainly cause I’m 20something and still don’t have my drivers licence

**ricki** (7): i understand why sabrina was mad as shit, imagine being 21 and being describe as *soo* much older, i would turn to ashes

**welcome2thejam** (7): Feeling on this remains the same the last two times I rated it: well written, I can see why it was so effective, but I'm just not in a place where it'll hit me hard (though for those it does work on it's probably an easy high score)

**bigbigbee** (6.5): I had a full-on dinner table argument with my sister saying that there was nothing that special and that its success was a lot due to gossip and weak charts in like January of 2021. My parents did #not get it. Anyways she really showed me bad omg

#cannot drive at all

**2dina3dworld** (6): this hit better when I could still drive

**BasedButta** (6): sorry, i get bored

**frogaranaman** (6): this is probably a common sentiment, but the bridge is easily the best part of this song

**MassiveThief** (6): the build up to the chorus is great, but the way all momentum is killed on "REEED light STOOOP sign" just ain't it. also the overplay doesn't help

**oscarbrierley1** (6): sooooo melodramatic, would probably like it more if she held back on the vocals in the first chorus

**xavieryes** (6): a year over its release, this song has lost its spark for me, but that bridge is still excellent

**CarlieScion** (5): I really did not understand why this blew up

**DefaultPophead** (5): I streamed this song the first day it came out and immediately upon replay, I was sick of it. Then a few weeks later it blew up and I was punished by the radio. She sounds great on it and I do feel her pain for a bit, but then that awful bridge comes on and I lose the story. Without the bridge I could give this like an eight. It's one of her only songs I feel is both authentic and well-written.

**Iris3271** (5): It's a decent song I just get bored

**qazz23** (5): takes a while to get going

**sufjancaesar** (5): This isn’t any less annoying than it was 1 year ago

**majid** (4.5): probably one of the most overrated songs this decade so far

**kappyko** (4): I Get It but i still hate the bridge

**steelstepladder** (2): I just don’t get it…

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (0): their text to me - "zero that license song by Olivia"

**LesApfels** (0): Never understood how this got popular

STOP! SHE'S ALMOST DEAD!

The second last Doja song to leave and this one is such a slayer. When I first heard the album I was like 'she's opening with this?' but it really grew on me so much. Like yeah, lyrically this is whatever, and sonically it's nothing special compared to the album. But it's so much catchier than pretty much anything else on _Planet Her_. The hook just gets stuck in my head and like it's just a lot of fun. Like much of Doja in this rate, this was robbed.

---

#do acronym rate

**oscarbrierley1** (11): the afrobeat is so good it was thee summer song of 2021

**TChalla1966** (11): What a opening! Ugh love every single minute of this song

**AHSWeeknd** (10): We need Doja to do more of this

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): omg, she served so hard that I got bitch-slapped by my drunk older homophobic cousin asking if I was ok when I tried fish-flop dancing to this song secretly inside of my bedroom and he saw me...

**Alumineous** (10): I like it. After a few listens, it still sounds fresh and unique. The Kendrick Lamar inspired flow was impressive and the lyrical content is great.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i just think that woman

**CarlieScion** (10): I see woman; I enjoy song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): little simz :handshake: doja cat | songs called 'woman' that are gonna make the top 10 but won’t be the top song of their albums even if they should

**fadedblue09** (10): A sultry banging opener, boasting one of Doja’s spiciest performances

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): What an opener!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): one of the best on album, her verses, the productions, the chorus, are all excellent.

**jaztinax** (10): was instantly obsessed when the album came out. i love it when she mixes her soft voice and her slightly louder raspy voice

**joeeswift** (10): the verses are really amazing, she’s a wordsmith y’all

**musical\_pyn** (10): everything I could want from a doja cat song, no notes

**nootnoot781** (10): listening to doja on this is the closest i will ever get to being a straight man. she’s so…

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): women <3

**seanderlust** (10): smooth beat on a sendup to the glory of womanhood, cowritten by jidenna. what's not to love.

**shipperondeck** (10): we! love! afrobeats! best song on the whole album, i'm glad it blew up eventually bc it totally deserves it. the snare hits kicking off the song... YUM

**Treecoh** (10): i both giggle and seethe with anger at doja and her label really releasing the 3 dr luke tracks as the first 3 singles when this has outstreamed both you right and need to know and will probably outstream kiss me more eventually

**UselessTacooo** (10): Afrobeats is a good look on Doja

**vayyiqra** (10): I love Afrobeat now

**you2009** (10): happy international working women's day I guess <3

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): Wonderful song, but it all goes down from here!

**DirtyRat583** (9.1): the right way to begin an album. loved this from first listen

**1998tweety** (9): BOP, love to see this smashing

**AzettImpa** (9): yes just yes

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): Humans giving this less than a 7 on a month like March and a year like 2021 should have their ballots investigated at hosts' discretion

**MassiveThief** (9): that beat got me FUCKED up

**MrMoodle** (9): I’m so happy this is a legit streaming hit now

**qazz23** (9): like the afrobeat sound on this

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (9): Doja goes off in the second verse.

**RandomHypnotica** (9): gaslight, gatekeep, girlboss

**runaway3212** (9): This reminds me of work with the repetition and like how good it is

**waluigiest** (9): all I can think about: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdBHPkqu/

**wasian-invasion** (9): let me be your rumor

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9): all i can think of when i hear this song is the popcorn karaoke tiktok version

**ReallyCreative** (8.8): Nao/Lianne La Havas and Little Simz have better tracks titled Woman but all are queens

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): this song tricked me into thinking the album would be good

**imbaby122** (8.5): very slay song but those drums in the intro stole the show. women 🤩🤩🤩

**jsonphile** (8.5): Doja you can be my woman 🥺

**plastichaxan** (8.5): this is me being nice

**ricki** (8.5): happy women's history month i guess…

**Stryxen** (8.5): wummah wummah wummah

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): ok terf

**akanewasright** (8): I’m always a bit confused why this became the fan favorite… and then the second verse hits and I get it more

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): I’M FEMININE WAH!

**dropthehammer11** (8): afrobeats in the mainstream is what i like to hear

**frogaranaman** (8): literally the flabster gif rn

**IIIHenryIII** (8): better than I expected

**jasannn** (8): I thought it was an odd opener on first listen but after hearing it a billion times on tik tok, I appreciate the fantastic instrumental and this has one of the best raps in the album.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8): just realised from looking at the lyrics that Doja is singing Daddy repeatedly in the background of the chorus and genuinely considered knocking a few points off. Bit overly simp-ish for me but still a bop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): let me be your roomba…roomba roomba roomba…i can be your roomba

**tickframe** (8): they don't do intro songs like this anymore

**jman457** (7.5): cute little song about women supporting other women

**thedoctordances1940** (7.3): yeah it's a pretty good opener but it definitely doesn't blow me away

**modulum83** (7.2): *bernie sanders voice* my fellow americans: let me be your womah

**devilonmytongue0** (7): all i can think about when i listen to this song now is the popcorn karaoke

**Iris3271** (7): Happy Women's History Month y'all

**Lipe18090** (7): wumawumawuma

**nooodisaster** (7): So I really liked this song when I first listened to it, nice vibe, good beat, fun rhymes. But the intro over time grated and now I want to skip when it comes up. But it does work as a good intro to the theme of the album.

**racloves** (7): is it boring to say this was overplayed so I don’t like it as much now. Still goes hard though

**sweetnsoursauce11** (7): this has grown on me alot but i still think naked is better

#streaming Marina – "Man's World"

**jackisboredtoday** (6.7): I mean its catchy but SO one note

**slimboyfriend** (6.5): As an opener, I think she could’ve done better

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (6): Not a huge fan of the verses, but that chorus is a bop.

**fairytalehigh** (6): this song actually really irritates me, it's the only doja song to do that.

**ImADudeDuh** (6): I remember when people used the afrobeats on this song to passive aggressively call people who didn’t like this album racist.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (6): fun, empowering bop

**TiltControls** (6): Doja wants to be this person's woman, but unforunately that can't be done anymore ever since Chaka Khan already decided to be every woman

**ebooks #5454** (5): happy international women's history month or something yea

**astrologicalangel** (3): I'm getting so sick of this song

**cremeebrulee** (0): this chorus is so lazy to me idc idc

**pig-serpent** (0): I hate the way she says Woo-muh and unfortunatly, it's stupidly catchy so it pops into my head all the time to continue annoying me.

Dear u/ph2021ultimate,

In 2022 you will host a rate on popular music platform /r/popheads. You will be gay, but you will have realized that that is okay (although you will sometimes have to deal with internalized homophobia (you will know what those words mean in 2022) but it's nothing you can't handle). In 2021, an artist called Lil Nas X will have sung very openly about being gay, sometimes those songs were really catchy and dance-able, but sometimes they were also quiet and reflective. They will help you and many other people around the world with being honest and truthful with themselves, and you will have no choice but to stan (you will also know what this means in 2022).

---

#found an instant ease

**ebooks #5454** (11): if you were dateless and closeted at prom put ur mFing hands up!!!

**modulum83** (11): To see a song so brutally articulate the ultra-specific experience of growing up gay in a homophobic environment, and how that suppression drains you as a person, and takes your development away, and just pummels you with hurt after hurt; and then to wrap it in a warm hug of a song, a promise that it will all work out in the end, and you're not alone - it feels almost unreal that it exists. Over the past few years, I've been at some of the lowest points of my life. And this song has saved me, and probably will keep saving me, over and over and over again.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): An good direction tbh

**akanewasright** (10): My first impression of this song was very much like… “it kind of reminds me of the pop rap ballads that I’d hear on the radio when I was young and first started listening to pop radio.” It doesn’t specifically sound like any one song or type of song but more in like… it *feels* like one of them, where the performer is more reflective than cool or swaggering, and the hook is something sweet and catchy. I’d hear this kind of thing all the time at night or in car rides, when I could sneak my way into listening to pop radio on my iPod nano. This sounds like this kind of song, but queer. He’s singing about things I’ve felt before but haven’t really heard sung about in this way (the song also reflects on some experiences I haven’t had, but that just makes it worth even more to others). The more I hear the song, the more I wonder what this would have done for me if I had heard it on the radio as an 11 or 12 year old, not quite aware of my sexuality, but on the verge of suppressing it hard. I think it’s one of two songs in the rate that actually makes me cry, but almost in a tears of joy way.

**Alumineous** (10): The lyrics. My god the lyrics. Someone in the world loves you, don’t forget that.

**Awkward\_King** (10): i remember liking this when it was pre-released so he had a second song to perform on snl, but like i feel like i didnt truly hear it until a couple weeks ago when it fully cliqued and now it is such a lovely calming song

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): I didn't really appreciate this song when it first came out but listening to it in the context of the album made me like it a lot more

**celladonn** (10): Feel like this doesn't get as much appreciation as it should, it's so lovely

**cremeebrulee** (10): this is actually so hard not to 11, this song has always felt like the prequel to c7osure, which is still one of my fave LNX songs. the chorus is just so heartbreaking, it just makes all of the success he's gotten lately even more deserved.

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): The sad bop I deserve man

**jackisboredtoday** (10): “and i’m happy by the way, that i made that jump that leap of faith. I’m happy that it all worked out for me” is one of the most affecting moments in pop music for the last few years for me. Very plainspoken but nakedly honest and honestly very very moving

**ManofOranges** (10): Something about this song rubs me the right way. Probably my favorite song on the album.

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): deserved as much love as the other singles

**ricki** (10): :(

**runaway3212** (10): “there’s so much more to life than die” who is fucking cutting onions here

**skargardin** (10): i cried

**Treecoh** (10): this is the saddest song in existence. "stanning nicki from morning until dawn, only place i felt like i belonged" you cannot name a sadder lyric

**Uberpigeon** (10): man.... I remember people were lukewarm on this one but idk i find it really touching. It feels like it came from a very genuine and tender emotional place and it makes me feel a little teary for young lnx which music doesn't often do! For an album that to me, veers into corny territory a bit too often, this is one is quite poignant i think!!

**UselessTacooo** (10): Who let me sleep on this?

**vayyiqra** (10): "i named the song “sun goes down” because i feel like at night is when those thoughts you try to avoid really start to hit and you can’t escape them" yeah that hit me a lot. I can't relate to everything he's talking about in this song but I can to some of it and it's maybe the most emotional track on the album.

**xavieryes** (10): "and nobody knows it when you're silent" is such a simple line but still such a punch in the gut

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): The first song on this album I connect to, and he just sounds so damn gorgeous here.

**emmaelf** (9.5): something about this is so beautiful and i never thought i'd say that about a lnx song.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9.5): Has the right ingredients to get me to cry with how vulnerable and honest plus the concept of talking to one's younger self is always my emotional weakness

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): ngl listening to this for the first time in a while it was actually a bit overwhelming, like I'm genuinely struggling to put it into words but this hit me HARD

**emayzee** (9.2): in 2019 i would've never expected the old town road singer to have me in tears but here we are

**1998tweety** (9): we stan nicki

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): A solid song by itself, but within the context of the album, shit gets 10x more real.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): I know this was more of a promotional single and wasn’t meant to be a big hit like Montero and Industry Baby…but it would have been nice to hear this on the radio a few times :)

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9): If you don’t like this you are a bad person

**flavasavavandal** (9): just hits emotionally

**frogaranaman** (9): this grew on me so much, such a great somber piece from LNX here

**ignitethephoenix** (9): only he could make a song this emotional that also talks about stanning Nicki Minaj. Barbz don’t deserve this

**ImADudeDuh** (9): NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO

**jaztinax** (9): i love the melody of this song. he makes stanning nicki sound so sweet and innocent

**N454545** (9): sad not bop

**ReallyCreative** (9): this is definitely one of his best tracks

**waluigiest** (9): super poignant. Completely forgot it was ever a single.

**wasian-invasion** (9): aww this makes me tear up

**TiltControls** (8.5): Took a bit to grow on me, but I really enjoy it now!

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): it deserves a better number on the Billboard Charts

**bookthieving** (8): i wasn't feeling this track for months but it finally hit for me on this final listen

**CrimsonROSET** (8): this is gonna get chosen family’d i hate it here

**DirtyRat583** (8): this is proof sad songs can have non-acoustic instruments. take note olivia

**jman457** (8): good lyrics just wish there was more going on production wise

**pig-serpent** (8): This didn't deserve to flop.

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): A better anti-suicide song than “Who can relate woo” that’s for sure

ph2021ultimate: **seanderlust** (7.8): "i'm gonna make my fans so proud of me" is so charming and warm

**thedoctordances1940** (7.7): i never really revisited this, like already as a single, but at the same time i've always quite liked it, it's just nice and vibey

**RandomHypnotica** (7.6): im not gonna say anything bad in fear of my life from barbz defending this song

**bigbigbee** (7.5): I ADORE the music video for this song, it’s so cute and sad. I think that Lil Nas is so…”larger than life” sometimes that it’s easy to forget that he’s so young, and I have a soft spot for teenage stories (American media moment!)

**fairytalehigh** (7.5): didn't this song piss off the barbz?

**shipperondeck** (7.5): i didn't get why this was the second single for the longest time, but i think it was a good idea because it hints at how raw and honest he's gonna be throughout the whole album. i really like how specific he is in his lyrics, and this song shows that well.

**IIIHenryIII** (7): sorry, dude

**imbaby122** (7): sonically not my fav but god this is so genuine and heartbreaking. even with all his marketing strategies and antics he feels like a real person and it makes me happy knowing he’s in a better place now.

**nooodisaster** (7): Prob the darkest song on the album? Fuck. I love confessional lyrics, and this song is basically nothing but those. Hard to listen to, and not really a song to vibe/bop/even enjoy tbh. But powerful.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): This song is a bit too low-key to be a standout.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): The stars come out And all that counts is here and now My universe will never be the same I'm glad you came

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): the lyrics are either really good or kinda not good at the same time but i love the overall vibe and the production

#did not find that instant ease

**fadedblue09** (6.5): Cute message, but doesn't really do much for me

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.5): this song gives me main character energy

**MassiveThief** (4): i remember disliking this when it came out and yeah still not very good

**MrMoodle** (4): That stanning Nicki line is SO forced and deeply clunky lol. Vocals in the chorus are way too high, his singing sounds so smooth when he’s in a lower register and they do that layering thing with his voice, but this chorus sounds Don’t Rock Me To Sleep tier

AND DOJA?????

This song is hard for me. When it first dropped I truly hated it, but during this rate it grew on me (for those who haven't picked up on it, this was kind of a trend during this rate). There's a lot to like: the SZA verse, the way she screams 'I FEEL LIKE FUCKING SOMETHING,' the 'ohh lalala.' But there's also quite a bit to dislike: the uncohesiveness of it, the first Doja verse, the Luke.

Honestly, idk if I wanted this to do better, but I also idk if I wanted this to do worse. What I know for sure is that I wanted Doja on the whole to do better. I'm not denying there's filler on _Planet Her_, but there's also definitely some gems and I feel like they were not nearly appreciated enough. Safe to say, Doja was thoroughly ROBBED this rate!

---

#is he... y'know... \*ding*

**fadedblue09** (11): Popheads hating on a perfectly executed pop song because it isn't by a white woman? Surprising

**mysario** (11): no explanation needed on why this is probably the best pop song of the year

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): there's a reason why this is her biggest hit that isn't Say So and that instrumental is soooo good!

**babadork** (10): This got bumped up to a 10 at the last minute. I love how light and flirty this is.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i mean what do you want from me

**DirtyRat583** (10): delicate girlboss song

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): What a bop and a half! SZA and Doja ate this shit up, and I still bop to it regularly :nail-care:

**IIIHenryIII** (10): kissing in public somehow became more tolerable for me after this, thanks Doja(?)

**iniekcja\_** (10): perfect pop song?

**jaztinax** (10): one of the best songs of 2021!!

**ManofOranges** (10): This song is just toooooo damn catchy

**ricki** (10): 😽💋💋

**runaway3212** (10): vibes upon vibes tbh

**shipperondeck** (10): this song is actually a bit nostalgic to me lol. it was mine and my sister's song of the summer, we listened to it so many times. maybe that's part of why i'm rating it so high but in general it is just a super fun song idk what else to say about it rn. only downside is that it feels tacked onto the end of the album but i can't penalize the song itself for that

**sufjancaesar** (10): This is just fucking pretty like idc

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): throwback to when this came out and the release thread of ppl saying it was a terrible lead single choice and 12 month later its arguably her biggest hit depending on location

**TChalla1966** (10): this song still that girl had SZA stop her own era and she’s hasn’t looked back since

**waluigiest** (10): when it’s right it’s right. It’s almost comical how much better this song is than the average song on the album.

**welcome2thejam** (10): So many obviously fantastic moments on here from Doja and SZA, but most obviously ALL ON MY TONGUE I WANT IT

**jsonphile** (9.5): perfect summer song. It’s light and breezy, sexy, fun, and just an absolute bop

**MrMoodle** (9.5): This is a near-flawless song but it’s also kind of ruined pop music, I’ve heard like 3 songs in the past week (one of them from Doja herself) and each time thought “oh the industry people want another Kiss Me More” and all of them are just fine but deeply uninspired

**wasian-invasion** (9.5): makes me feel like fucking something! Perfect blend of doja singing and rapping and sza's amazing verse

**you2009** (9.5): when sexy women talk I listen (even if I don't understand what they're saying)

**1998tweety** (9): bop even though seizure doesnt know how to speak, her part is good though

**Awkward\_King** (9): god this song has aged so well, when it came out i was like this fucking say so ass ripoff second attempt but god it fucks so hard, it helps that im fluent in szanese

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (9): whh;a t if w e kk;ijsss ed nghh,; and h hheld hwands 🥺🥺🥺

**emmaelf** (9): this is the doja cat i wanted the rest of the album to be. it's chill but uplifting and easy to bop to. just want i want from a pop song.

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): A rehash of her, at the time, latest hit can be understandable when the material is this good, and particularly when bringing SZA in made it a fantastic collab and great to see smashing on the charts

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): a huge bop!

**nlh1013** (9): you’d think I’d be tired of this song by now but I’m not

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9): best song on the album

**qazz23** (9): best track on the album, love the disco vibe

**UselessTacooo** (9): There are many songs on this album than KMM but it’s an objectively perfect lead single. She’s infectious and fun.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I do have a tolerance for some lazy enunciation (look at my flair) but SZA… the fact that I can never make out a word of what she says just makes it that much harder to enjoy her music. It still bops though!

**xavieryes** (9): one of the most basic songs on the album, but still really good and makes sense as a single. It really gets good after SZA kicks in.

**emayzee** (8.9): i would sacrifice the SZA feature if that meant we got a second doja verse

**seanderlust** (8.9): shoutout to the triangle player who made a bag off this track for playing one time in its entire four minute run time.

**jasannn** (8.8): limp wrist

**ignitethephoenix** (8.7): if this wasn’t overplayed to death I would probably like it more but I’m just tired of it. But holy is it ever catchy and just chock full of great lines.

**jman457** (8.7): Maybe a bit of single bias, but te guitar line gives me life

**TiltControls** (8.5): idk if I'd call it a top ten song of the year, but it's fun enough

**Lipe18090** (8.2): sza why so good. overall a very good album but it gets kinda repetitive by the end

**AzettImpa** (8): I just wish it was a little less "produced" if that makes sense

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): Iconic use of self-censorship in that SZA verse. Ding!

**dropthehammer11** (8): i honestly forget how good this song is, because whenever i wanna hear doja over this kind of sound, i look to say so. but this is a great track in its own right

**ebooks #5454** (8): bonus points for the sexy eye candy in the m/v

**modulum83** (8): I FEEL LIKE FUCKING SOMETHING

**ormysonormysonormys** (8): bop

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (8): they way she tacked it on to the end like she doesn't even want it here ddd

**vayyiqra** (8): When this came out I really want to love it because it looked cool with the sci-fi concept and I was hoping to love the video, but then over time I've been forced to realize that I don't like it that much. Still a solid pop song I guess.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): it's a cute bop but a little bit overrated

**shhhneak** (7.7): Hot take but this is just… fine. SZA carries.

**Iris3271** (7.5): Brings me back to summer

**TragicKingdom1** (7.5): this is overrated however i do find it impressive how like 4 different parts of it went viral on tiktok at various points

**RandomHypnotica** (7.4): i hate that this is literally say so 2.0 and it worked just as they wanted

**Alumineous** (7): I wasn’t necessarily looking for another Say So. Still, it’s a good song, sounds more comfortable than I Don’t Do Drugs. SZA and Doja complement each other well, even if the former didn’t really do much.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): This one kinda got killed by overplay, but it’s still an objectively good song.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7): okay it's good but like it's not that good

**fairytalehigh** (7): i find this wildly underwhelming, SZA is totally squandered and doja has done dance-pop way better many times already (including on this album)

**musical\_pyn** (7): it's fine, the chorus is definitely the best part

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): I’ve heard this song so much that I’m sick of it, or else it would have gotten an eight.

**cremeebrulee** (6.9): this is not a song it’s sza’s verse and 2000000 tiktoks in a trench coat

**racloves** (6.5): she’s cute

**pig-serpent** (2): I don't think this song is inherantly bad, but after hearing this song out of low quality van speakers for months on end my skin starts to crawl every time I heard the main guitar line to this song and quite honestly I never want to hear it again.

**Treecoh** (1): my score is equal to the number of words i understood from sza during her verse. i hate singers that cant enunciate

#Dr. Puke

**ReallyCreative** (11): fuck Dr. Luke

**AHSWeeknd** (10): dr disgusting deserves jail but this is IT

**Uberpigeon** (8): ugh its a dr puke but its so good............

**imbaby122** (2): when did this song even come out im losing my grasp on time. anyways -10 for tyson trax +2 for ALL ON MY TONGUE I WANT IT

**OliviaGodrigo** (2): I giggled looking at the wikipedia page for this song and seeing that all mentions of Dr. Luke were scrubbed from it

**DefaultPophead** (1): Dr. Luke songs and "Payday" get an automatic one or zero.

**nooodisaster** (0): Dr. Luke. I knew I was gonna give a Dr. Luke song a 0, and this song is sooo mid and laughable as a lead single. One day I won't have to rate a rapist's music on popheads.

**iniekcja\_** (8.389): I find it quite funny that this is the only album from this rate that even made it into my top 100 projects of 2021 list. As a whole it's really really fun, but sadly towards the end the songs start feeling a little bit too samey to me.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.333): The hype surrounding this album was insane, it really cemented Doja as a main pop girl

**fadedblue09** (8.306): Seeing this album get such a mixed response among popheads is just….baffling. Seriously, this is the perfect execution of a contemporary pop album: melding elements of pop, R&B and rap that display Doja’s personality and versatility very well. Is popheads’ hiphop/R&B-phobia coming out of the woodwork again?

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (8.278): their text to me - "ate tbh" (same text as _MONTERO_)

**oscarbrierley1** (8.017): this album is going to get robbed

**jsonphile** (8.000): Doja Cat is one of my favorite performers and I’m expecting her to be one of the biggest stars of the 2020s. This album is solid, as was Hot Pink, but I feel like her best is yet to come. The potential for this girl is insane, and she seems incredibly versatile, so I’m looking forward to big things from her, and I expect this album will be seen as a stepping stone to her magnum opus she’ll deliver in the next few years.

**vayyiqra** (7.944): An unpopular take, but this is my favourite album in this rate. I can see they're all good, so that's not saying anything about their quality, but this is the one I enjoy the most and have listened to the most by far. Idk, it's not deep, it's just a fun album, Doja is charismatic, I like to bop to it. The concept sounded cool to me because I love sci-fi and it doesn't really come through on the album, but then most concept albums are like that. I also like the Afro-futurism influence. I have to agree the deluxe bonus tracks are not that good and the album was fine without them, but I don't hate them either. Anyway, do your worst to this album I guess.

**babadork** (7.578): I was hyped up about this album enough that I listened to it the day it released, and I wasn’t disappointed. It is a good showcase for her ability to easily switch between genres. I usually only listen to a few songs from this album at a time, so I don’t think I ever realized how long it is. As much as I love some of the songs on this album, the filler brings down my average.

**wasian-invasion** (7.306): If this album was just like 8 or 9 songs it would be one of my top albums of the year but all the filler really drags it down

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7.000): This album exhausted me, easily my least favorite of all the albums I had to rate. When I first heard Woman, I wasn't sure if I was listening to the right album. But there are moments here and there that can make for a good listening experience, like the Been Like This/Options/Ain't Shit trio of songs and Kiss Me More is a great album closer if the rate didn't include the deluxe with the bonus tracks. Not bad overall but I won't return to this. 6/10

**bigbigbee** (6.944): I actually like this album. There are some songs that I don’t like as much, but I think that because I haven’t heard any other Doja album before this, I wasn’t really disappointed like a lot of her fans were. I think this is very solid and it has two or three genuinely great, fun songs!

**MrMoodle** (6.917): This is not the Doja Cat album I’ve been waiting for. At her best she’s one of the most engaging and entertaining personalities in all of mainstream music, but there’s just SO MUCH boring-ass filler on this album. Very little of it is offensively bad, it’s just disappointing knowing what she COULD be making isn’t what she IS making. Also it barely stays on theme, I was so hyped we were getting a collection of weird futuristic interplanetary jams, instead half the tracks are just like mildly atmospheric and then they expect me to buy that’s sufficiently spacey??? Like if you’re gonna have a theme then commit to the bit woman jfc. Most of the singles are really good though.

**sufjancaesar** (6.889): I prefer to focus on the positive, so I’m referring to about 30% of Planet Her when I say “I really liked this”

**ktajlili** (6.889): I enjoy this album but consider it background music, especially the weaker second half.

**RandomHypnotica** (6.850): Planet Her isn't a *bad* album, but in the context of this rate it just feels like the only album that doesn't have a standout moment. None of the tracks here live up to the highs of tia tamera, streets or boss bitch, and there just feels like a lot of songs which are ok at best.

**jman457** (6.706): This whole album feels like it was made to blow up on tik tok … and like not it a good way. He earlier work drew on such diverse musical inspirations for this to feel so unisnpired is just disappointed.

**just\_thonking** (6.667): I love how this rate is three deeply personal albums and then "I feel like fuckin' something!"

**TiltControls** (6.639): Not as bad as everyone seems to think, but probably still the weakest in the line up. With some cutting down though I think it'd be a really solid album

**IIIHenryIII** (6.556): Definitely not bad, but it could benefit from a shorter tracklist.

**welcome2thejam** (6.500): Back half can be a bit of a slog, but even with some of the edges sanded off, Doja can be an absolute force and a lot of fun

**modulum83** (6.461): 60 minutes of TikTok audios with the occasional best chorus you've ever heard. She needs to collab with Playboi Carti like, yesterday, though.

**skargardin** (6.389): The album does start to drag at the later half, but it's still pretty solid I think, sans the deluxe tracks and some standard cuts.

**nooodisaster** (6.194): She shoulda just called this album 'Naked' or 'Options' like where was the alien songs...

**CreepyMannequin** (6.167): Very surprised by this one! I skipped over its release because I wasn’t a fan of Hot Pink, but there’s a lot of great tracks on here. Some mid tracks could definitely be cut, but I think this is the one I’ll return to the most.

**MassiveThief** (6.083): lots of good songs, lots of filler. pretty expected i guess. the last half of the album is rough to get through, but the best songs do mostly make up for it.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.000): This album really takes filler to a new level. I think the main problem is that Doja put sooo much personality into her big songs than all of the other ones look even more boring by comparison. I wish I had more positive things to say :( I think Doja has the it-factor but sadly this album doesn’t do her talents justice

**DevilsOfLoudun** (5.944): This could have been a brilliant 11 track album but drags too much.

**slimboyfriend** (5.917): Great album to nap to

**frogaranaman** (5.778): probably the weakest album in this rate, but still has so many incredible highlights

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.744): number of times i almost wrote doja car instead of doja cat while writing comments for these songs: 6

**akanewasright** (5.722): Okay this album isn’t as bad as I was making it out to be initially, but… it is honestly really disappointing aside from a few tracks. Doja at her best is wild, scrappy, and one of the best pop performers of our generation… but there are only a few songs on the album that live up to the standard she’s set for herself in her old work. But yeah some of the disappointing tracks bop too ig

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (5.667): every song on this album is the same
[/r/popheads/comments/tiquew/2021_ultimate_day_3_dddaytrip_took_it_to_10/i1g2qgq/]

=====

ph2021ultimate: **BasedButta** (5.444): As a fan of pop music but very unfamiliar to english speaking pop, I came into this rate not knowing 95% of the songs, and out of those, Doja’s album was by far the one I was looking forward to the most. Well suffice to say that I’m extremely disappointed, so many weak songs, and I heard there was an extended version, sheesh… I tried to be very nice in my scores :/

**QuaxlyDuck** (5.389): As someone who tries to avoid streaming songs touched by Dr Puke I really didn't want to listen to this album, but I'll rate it and not comment in order to prevent my ballot being thrown out

**qazz23** (5.222): the singles are good but there's way too much filler

**Alumineous** (5.000): This is the first time I'm listening to this album. I abstained from listening last year due to Dr. Redacted. Thankfully, this album has no redeeming qualities to justify repeat listenings. Look, I don't hate Doja. She's insanely funny and she has amazing stage presence. Sonically, the music falls flat, but her rapping is great, if a bit derivative. I’ll give her credit for being a wizard at elevating these average songs in live performances through her energy, choreo, and visuals.

**OliviaGodrigo** (4.944): I just don’t see it for her outside of being the queen of social media

**thedoctordances1940** (4.928): yeah this is not a good album, highs are not particularly high, especially in comparison to past songs, lows can be pretty low but there's just so much mid filler here. boring beats, uninterested performances, dull features, there's really not much going for this album

**cremeebrulee** (4.900): i didn't have wifi the weekend this album came out and i think that was a higher power trying to protect me

**shhhneak** (4.778): I’m sorry but I’m not really a fan of Dojo’s cadence. That and Dr L*ke’s production, which really doesn’t elevate this album to its namesake whatsoever.

**pig-serpent** (4.667): I was a little surprised that Miss Cat was my main issue with a lot of these songs and that the production was mostly good throughout, even if there was a ton of filler on this album even before the extended tracks.

**hikkaru** (4.639): there's a few decent tracks and the SMASH that is get into it but for an artist with such a bountiful well of personality, planet her is mostly completely devoid of it. the production is a big part of that, for the most part it just sounds so run of the mill and it's really disappointing!

**ImADudeDuh** (4.194): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DwK_9zDWkAA2qwy.jpg

**ebooks #5454** (3.944): take a shot every time you hear a song from tiktok from here

What's good about this song is how much it relates to me personally, while also relating to a lot of other people personally. Olivia really gets the zeitgeist of Gen Z. Honestly, if this was the highest rated _SOUR_ song I would have yassed so hard, that would've been so funny. Sadly, it was not, but! Still did much better than I think anyone expected, impressively being the only non-single to make the top 10, and outperforming all of _Planet Her_ (which also says something about how _Planet Her_ did, but we move?). Just a really great song with a good message as well.

---

#it's taken ahold

**qazz23** (11): This should've been a single, it's just a really good pop-rock tune. Favorite part is when the piano gets a bit chaotic during the bridge

**shipperondeck** (11): this was my number 1 song last year on my spotify wrapped. it's so relatable (especially from my filipina-german sister like i am still so happy that "someone who looks like me" achieved this amount of love and success) and sonically it's just really great. all the elements are perfectly in place, creates the perfect mood, godlike bridge with the discordant piano. and as someone who loves thinking about song titles, this one is my favorite in the whole rate.

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Could’ve kept the title to one jealousy but you do you bestie

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): absolutely my favorite song from here ever, I relate to this so much because I'm too ugly to live, but too dumb to die.

**Awkward\_King** (10): a song about social media done in a relatable yet not cringey way she's just like me fr

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): I don’t listen to this song nearly as much as I should for how much I like it.

**bigbigbee** (10): Most fun song on the album and not discussed enough!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): The single never was…

**cremeebrulee** (10): person who knows this is a moderately popular fan fave: omg this track is so underrated guys

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this could win, like it won’t but if it did i wouldn’t be mad

**DefaultPophead** (10): People don't talk about how good this song. It's easily one of the best on the album! I don't think songs have to be relatable for me to have a connection to them, but I really do relate and feel connected to this one!

**devilonmytongue0** (10): again i wish i had more than one 11 to give

**frogaranaman** (10): something about this song's cathartic ass production keeps me coming back and it just gets better every listen

**imbaby122** (10): this song makes me the most excited about olivias future projects. omfg that total downward spiral towards the end. the lyrics, production, performance, it’s all there ‼️

**jman457** (10): A glimps of early Fiona Apple in this, Not saying she if gonna release a fetch the bult cutters anytime soon though

**jsonphile** (10): actually the best song on the album. The bridge with the piano breakdown? Best part of the album

**Lipe18090** (10): sour should be more this

**ManofOranges** (10): Now THIS song right HERE? Too good.

**musical\_pyn** (10): this is probably the best bridge on the album, and that piano adds so much in the production

**nootnoot781** (10): if this came out when i was 15 i would’ve been insufferable

**runaway3212** (10): Olivia is at her best when she’s self reflecting instead of tearing joshua to shreds tbh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): something something should've been a single.

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (10): this slut bop OMG

**troubled-paradise69** (10): the only song I liked on the whole album. watch it get eliminated first

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Extra points for finally writing a song NOT about Joshua

**waluigiest** (10): the bridge with that PIANO is the best part of this album

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): can’t wait for the upbeat pop-punk version!!!

**RandomHypnotica** (9.7): ok if jealousy started following you maybe get a restraining order???

**1998tweety** (9.5): we needed more songs like this

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): where’s Taylor’s writing credit for the Me-hee-hee

**MrMoodle** (9.5): Olivia unironically said me-he-he and i didn’t see one r/popheadscirclejerk post about it

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): it’s giving Fiona Apple - Ladies but also Taylor Swift - ME! with a dash of Trent Reznor & Atticus Ross

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9.5): yes I too feel these things. And I still feel them.

**akanewasright** (9): this should be a 10 but uh… let’s just say one time I had a crisis while running a bath and looping this song, and now I have that association in my brain

**fairytalehigh** (9): who can relate? WOO!

**IIIHenryIII** (9): why didn't ME! got it's due credit???

**jaztinax** (9): one of the best songs olivia has made

**ReallyCreative** (9): this is actually a really fresh direction that I wish she leaned into more on this album

**ricki** (9): https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ENvALvoWoAALaSv.jpg

**skargardin** (9): JEALOUSYYYYY- oh wait

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): I need a shoegaze remix of this STAT

**celladonn** (8.5): The instrumental here is so good

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): DAE think Ladyhawke is a great artist

**hikkaru** (8.5): the angsty vibes are immaculate

**just\_thonking** (8.5): Girl just stop comparing cum

**Uberpigeon** (8.5): the me-hee-hee honest to god makes me wince because i cant help but prepare myself for the ME! one to blast out

**you2009** (8.5): fiona apple if she read too much shaekespeare

**BasedButta** (8): interesting backing track, im a fan

**dropthehammer11** (8): this sounds like early fiona apple and that is fuckin sick

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): Relatable lyrics

**Iris3271** (8): Gotta love growing up with social media

**ormysonormysonormys** (8): super super catchy

**pig-serpent** (8): I never noticed this song until listening through for this rate and it's pretty sick.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (8): Olivia only spits straight facts in this song.

**Stryxen** (8): (ate)

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (8): fun

**vayyiqra** (8): lyrically this kind of goes off and the beat with the piano is hard

**wasian-invasion** (8): cum comparison

**welcome2thejam** (8): Fitter, happier, jealousy jealousy

**seanderlust** (7.3): very heavy lorde vibes here. the bridge is probably my favorite part here

**AzettImpa** (7): excited for the new mix!

**jasannn** (7): It’s funny when people called this a fiona apple track bc it gives me the same feeling as them. It’s technically good but I don’t really care for it.

**majid** (7): this is one's a bit fun

**plastichaxan** (7): this is kinda good but the mee-hee-hee haunts me

**modulum83** (6.8): SHE JUST LIKE ME. SHE JUST LIKE ME FR

#not the jealous type

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.5): is she singing the fucking me-hee-hee from me! in the chorus

**xavieryes** (6.5): some parts are good, some (especially the bridge) are very obnoxious

**emmaelf** (6): just a bit underwhelming, more of the same but a little less good.

**nooodisaster** (6): It's not bad, at this point I'm always just kinda over the faux-rock mid tempo stuff.

**QuaxlyDuck** (6): i had never listened to this. it is unusual, but at least breaks up the album's monotony

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this is overrated but the bridge is good

**TiltControls** (4): now why did she have to enunciate it "following me-hee-hee". just reading it out gives me bad shivers

**Alumineous** (2): We’re back on that cringey teenager bullshit. I just prefer the emotional, softer songs. And I just hate that vocal effect in the chorus. Makes it even more petty.

I remember when this dropped. Idk what everybody else's reaction was, but mine made my anticipation for this album go from 'I guess' to 'I'm soooo excited when tf is she dropping?'

The autotune is the obvious show stealer, but lyrically this song is almost much better than all the pre-album singles. Billie getting experimental with autotune is such a gag, it sounds so insanely good and it deals with the whole distortion of sound/distortion of the real story that come with an NDA and with trauma. I'm so obsessed with this song, it's perfection and deserved top 5.

---

#[REDACTED]

**Putrid-Potato-7456** (11): among us but like the best and that transition

**AHSWeeknd** (10): I WANT THIS SONG TO RUN OVER ME

**akanewasright** (10): I like a lot of things about this song, but [it’s a 10 because of this](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/857411402675650560/936696149702770698/Screen_Shot_2022-01-28_at_1.54.24_PM.png)

**DefaultPophead** (10): The song is one of the most intriguing in the rate for me, and I think it has the best video.

**fairytalehigh** (10): i already loved this song but the transition into "therefore i am" gives me "chromatica II" levels of serotonin, giving it a 10 just for that

**flavasavavandal** (10): “You could’ve saved this but you gave it such a low score”

**just\_thonking** (10): The title track is the climax, but I think this song is the centerpiece of the album. It perfectly executes the recipe that makes the album great (vulnerable lyrics with a laid back yet confident delivery over unique production) while also standing out from the rest of the album. Honestly, this was the first and only single from HTE that I immediately loved, and after listening to it, a bunch of the other singles clicked for me (Lost Cause, my future, Your Power)

**Lipe18090** (10): would be my 11 if HTE didn't exist

**majid** (10): i love this build up and the transition to therefore i am

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): NDA is a cheekier take of the same issues that were displayed in Your Power, but her disparate, autotuned vocals in the hook are just as haunting

**pig-serpent** (10): By itself it doesn't have an ending, but as the first part of the run towards the climax of the album it works amazingly.  The video is fantastic too.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): The virgin Billie merely hides in her house from Satan, while the CHAD Lil Nas X gives him a lap dance instead

**ricki** (10): humble brag with that "30 under 30" line

**runaway3212** (10): autotune is my weakness omfg

**seanderlust** (10): this one didn't click fully until i saw the music video. then i replayed it a ton. the post-chorus at the very end is a very cool choice

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): why were people making fun of this when it came out ITS SO GOOD

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (10): my sweet child, the song that changed me from 'yeah, of course, i've heard a few billie songs' to 'tattoo this woman's entire discography onto every millimeter of my body. i am wholly devoted to her and no one but her.'

**wasian-invasion** (10): I love the vaguely oriental bing bing bing bing bings

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): i fucking love this chorus so much, the intense refrain and static makes it sound so blurry and epic, it feels like a car crash in slow motion (complimentary)

**fadedblue09** (9.5): very addictive instrumental

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): this was a weird one at first but it grew on me over time

**Iris3271** (9.5): I loooooove the production

**you2009** (9.5): pink panther ass strings also hearing the transition into tIa for the first time was sickening

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): The beat here is just soooo good.

**celladonn** (9): That chorus just hits

**nooodisaster** (9): The verse where she namedrops all the song titles is kinda cute.

**waluigiest** (9): everything about this song is fantastic and cuts like a knife EXCEPT for the chorus

**thedoctordances1940** (8.8): omg those synths

**BasedButta** (8.5): very great use of synths - just wish it was more frequent

**DirtyRat583** (8.5): finally, a good song - and a super good one at that. i knew you had it in your eilussies

**imbaby122** (8.5): how was this single a last straw for billie fans it’s so slay ‼️‼️‼️

**tickframe** (8.5): the one two punch of nda and therefore i am really brightened my summer

**TiltControls** (8.5): I love the darker production of this

**shipperondeck** (8.2): this song really grabbed me on first listen and i still like it

**aldwin\_is\_here** (8): absolutely a bop that deserves to an earlier single

**emmaelf** (8): yes to a slightly heavier sound

**IIIHenryIII** (8): not dat amazing

**ImADudeDuh** (8): the way the best part of this song is the ending when it switches to a different song

**iniekcja\_** (8): bing bing bing boong boong

**jman457** (8): Feels like it was made to not alienate “old Billie” fans but the chorus is so good

**ReallyCreative** (8): a lot of promise with this one that I don't think was fully realized, killer transition into Therefore I Am though

**vayyiqra** (8): Unsettling, which is the point of course given the things the song is about. Industrial Billie works pretty well.

**dropthehammer11** (7.2): i like when she busts out the autotune

**CrimsonROSET** (7): you didn’t let anybody speak and then instead

**FroyoFox\_125** (7): This song is just okay to me

**ManofOranges** (7): Me when someone asks me what the hereditary material in most organisms is

**modulum83** (7): yeezus type beat

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.8): clumsy by fergie mixed with among us

**ebooks #5454** (6.5): bruh this sounds like the fucking among us song

**AzettImpa** (6): meh

**CarlieScion** (6): I like the instrumental more than most of the other songs

**MrMoodle** (6): Eh Oxytocin kinda outsold

**oscarbrierley1** (5): i love a self referential song but referencing songs on the same album doesn't hit that hard

#amogus sussy

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): amogus

**RandomHypnotica** (10): [:flasbster:](https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/840805970077548544.gif?size=96&quality=lossless)

**UselessTacooo** (10): We love sussy imposter production!

**Stryxen** (9): put me in the among us section

**N454545** (8): amongus

**xedophobic** (8): haha amogus music

**frogaranaman** (7): amogus sus

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): AMONGUS?

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): when the billie is sus

**1998tweety** (5): killed my hype in the era, the amogus sound is nice though

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (2): My friend told me that this sounds like the Among Us drip remix and now I can’t unhear it.

And so, Doja doesn't even have any luck in the bonus rate, just missing out on the win despite an otherwise impressive performance. This song proves that bullying works, with fans successfully campaigning to get it officially released after becoming a TikTok smash a few years after its original upload on SoundCloud (praying "Trash Man" will drop on Spotify any second now), and for good reason. The Paul Anka sample is used incredibly well, and the contrast of such an innocent song with lyrics where Doja talks about BDSM and Sex Swings is the type of Doja that we all know and love, and it works oh so well.

---

**jsonphile** (8.5): Doja does the impossible here and makes Paul Anka sexy??

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Did the sample so well

**akanewasright** (10): an actual good Doja song I couldn’t believe it

**babadork** (10): I am obsessed with the sample about how weirdly authentic this sounds. I’d consider giving it my 11 if I could.

**runaway3212** (10): When she wants to Doja has so much personality in songs

**throwaway-7650** (10): [11] bonus rate winner

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): very dirty and I love it!

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): love a horny bop

**TiltControls** (9): I wish we got more of this fun Doja on the album

**DirtyRat583** (8.9): feels like an amala-era track I LOVE IT SO MUCH the "this could go one of two ways" bit OH MY GOD AMAZING

**jackisboredtoday** (8.6): my favorite Doja song (except for Trash Man)

**jman457** (8.6): reminiscent of a more creative Doja Cat

**shipperondeck** (8.2): how have i never heard this song before. using put your head on my shoulder is so fucking funny when put alongside those lyrics. and THE LENGTH! a long ass song!! not afraid to chill in the song a bit more!!! we love that!!!!

**iniekcja\_** (8): this was so random

GOD! ITS BRUTAL OUT HERE.

It's just the most satisfying moment of this entire album. It's delivered so perfectly. Tbh I don't think this song is even that special when looking at sounds, it's fine but done better on "jealousy, jealousy" and "good 4 u." What really sets it apart is its great lyrics. It really feels like something that can only be written by an actual teenager, instead of a board room of 50 y/os pretending to be teenagers and that's what makes it so great.

---

#I wanna make it, like, _messy_

**2dina3dworld** (11): FUCK YEAHHHHHH

**ImADudeDuh** (11): queen of punk rock

**akanewasright** (10): [“Nessie? You nicknamed my daughter after the Loch Ness monster?”](https://media.tenor.co/videos/2862f62172ac858bdf7ae1142d7c4a1d/mp4)

**Awkward\_King** (10): i dont wanna fucking grow up

**babadork** (10): The next album should be about the horrors of being on a Disney show with Jake Paul.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): Finally…some representation for bad drivers in popular music.

**bookthieving** (10): seventeen antis dni

**CarlieScion** (10): :metal:

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (10): If this is manufactured relatability they did an amazing job because this song is literally me. I can’t parallel park. I can barely park within the lines normally. I’m not cool or smart either

**CreepyMannequin** (10): “I can’t even parallel park” she’s just like me fr fr

**CrimsonROSET** (10): this should have been the lead single if so we could get her performing it live more

**devilonmytongue0** (10): this would be the perfect song if it wasn’t for the parallel parking line

**fadedblue09** (10): Very Gen Z lyrics but she really sells it. A lot of this album is basically just the same song rehashed again and again, but this one has a refreshing energy that contrasts with the tired heartbroken girl schtick that populates the album

**hikkaru** (10): [i want it to be like, nessie](https://tenor.com/view/nessie-you-nicknamed-my-daughter-after-the-loch-ness-monster-bella-swan-kristen-stewart-breaking-dawn-gif-18267736)

**ignitethephoenix** (10): my favorite songs from the album by far, I think Olivia’s teenage angst works the best here and I wish this had the success G4U had

**jman457** (10): I was underestimating miss Olivia until she released this song, like wow.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): gonna sue Olivia for plagiarising my internal monologues

**MrMoodle** (10): This song rocked me, I went from skeptic to fan instantly. I think having this as the opener was so important - it doesn’t take itself seriously and seems self-aware about how angsty and teenage Olivia’s problems are, which in turn recontextualises the way you consume the rest of the album in a way that makes it far more enjoyable. A track like Drivers License doesn’t work when played fully straight, you need to know that while it comes from a sincere place, it’s also not meant to be taken completely seriously. And when you’ve processed that fact, it’s an absolute fucking belter. I was only able to enjoy that track after hearing this song and now I love it lol. Also the RIFF on this holy shit it hits

**nlh1013** (10): what an opener

**nootnoot781** (10): this is such an edgelord song but i don’t find it cringe. it’s camp. like twenty one pilots but actually good

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): awesome album opener

**plastichaxan** (10): she really decided to open the album with her best song and for what…

**qazz23** (10): more aggressive tracks like this please

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): I too fly into a rage because I cannot parallel park.

**racloves** (10): it really is brutal out here

**RandomHypnotica** (10): deserved a MUCH better mv omg

**ricki** (10): still a little upset that she didn't take ownership of the word "brutal" in the same way she did the phrase "good for [blank]"

**runaway3212** (10): I love a teen millionaire making the most relatable song of 2021, because god it really is brutal out here

**seanderlust** (10): "i'm not cool and i'm not smart and I can't even parallel park" is like...top 5 lyrical moments of 2021 for me. might even fight for the top spot with "your ass is stinky and you built like a mole"

**skargardin** (10): SO true

**Stryxen** (10): banger i guess the strokes wish they could do this

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): one of the best debut album openers period. also perfectly fitting song for the last couple of years

**throwaway-7650** (10): we love a song that beat drivers license in the r/popheads top 100!

**TiltControls** (10): It's just so much fun

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): No, because I relate to this song so much, it's not even funny. Not even just like the teen angst part of it, but the lyrics too. The first time I heard the lyrics I felt like I was hit by a truck.

**Uberpigeon** (10): GOD!!!

**UselessTacooo** (10): I still remember first hearing this song, expecting all ballads and being completely caught off guard. That might be the reason I like it so much tbh.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Please music industry gods, make every new artist sound like this the same way you made every new artist sound like Lorde and Billie Eilish the past decade

**waluigiest** (10): she’s still on her Disney contract. this stays bold!!!

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i too cannot parallel park and idk how i somehow got my driver’s license

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): more of this o-rod please

**jasannn** (9.5): parallel parking is always hit or miss for me tbh

**shipperondeck** (9.5): like most people i think, i wish this song were longer... also being followed immediately by traitor kills the vibe this song is supposed to give. besides that i love this song so dammit olivia give us more of this

**AHSWeeknd** (9): Teen angst or whatever

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): what an absolute banger, it would be a shame if the music video sucks, oh wai-

**celladonn** (9): New personality test: do you most associate this guitar riff with Olivia Rodrigo, Rogue Traders, or Elvis Costello

**ebooks #5454** (9): really loved it when it came out but lowkey the m/v and tiktok overdid it a bit

**emmaelf** (9): i'm a fair bit older than olivia when she wrote this but the real insecurities in this makes it so easy to relate to. plus it's a banger, which does help.

**fairytalehigh** (9): unlike you twinks i actually *can* parallel park

**IIIHenryIII** (9): perfect title

**imbaby122** (9): i really wish this song was longer im actually obsessed with olivia’s ability to be like charmingly whiny. i think if i complained like this my mom would like me more. instead im just annoying.

**jaztinax** (9): the teenage angst is so real

**jsonphile** (9): these gas prices sure are

**musical\_pyn** (9): needed a little bit more to get to the 10, but what a great opener

**N454545** (9): omg its literally me fr

**nooodisaster** (9): All these albums have great intros, and this is no exception. Also on re-listens I'm just sooo happy to listen her sing not about a break-up.

**pig-serpent** (9): Her label are cowards for not giving this a radio push.

**relibee2** (9): thinking about how my friend called it the worst song in the rate.... Bestie ily but how

**wasian-invasion** (9): me any time the slightest inconvencience happens: "god it's brutal out here"

**welcome2thejam** (9): Killer opening track

**xedophobic** (9): part of my songs to play 5 seconds before getting into a deep depression playlist

**mysario** (8.9): stream Pump It Up

**you2009** (8.8): great mood setter getting into the album. don't think I would've enjoyed it or the rest as much if it were replaced with one of the slower songs. not all that sonically interesting but she sounds great capturing the energy of the song with her voice. abrupt ending grew on me after a few listens

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.5): those were the words on main street when john fifty came to town

**bigbigbee** (8.5): my friend, playing Super Mario Odyssey on my Switch: “god, it’s Broodals out here”

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (8.5): Yaaaa Avril come out of the woodwork! I'm a little surprised but even with the positions-rehashed Disney-lite strings and the short length, the teen angstfest is convincing

**thedoctordances1940** (8.1): good song

=====

ph2021ultimate: **frogaranaman** (8): god the teen angst on this is killer

**iniekcja\_** (8): this is really successful despite me hating both pop-rock and rich and famous people complaining

**QuaxlyDuck** (8): so in Jan 2020 I made fun of r/popheads for only knowing 2 genres: disco and pop-rock. Then 2020 became a year of disco revival and 2021 the year of pop-rock revival. Ooops

**slimboyfriend** (8): Smashing the sad piano girl/angsty guitar girl binary

**vayyiqra** (8): unironically I thought for a second about calling this a riot grrrl song and I stand by that

**modulum83** (7.8): average day at euphoria high

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (7.5): only good song out of Olivia's songs

**1998tweety** (7): I know yall love it but I find this just ok, fine opener though.

**Lach#6922** (7): Static X - Push It

**shhhneak** (7): Adorably cringe which means it’s a great intro to the album as a whole.

#hates teenage angst

**FroyoFox\_125** (6): It was iconic at first, but now it's kind of just...meh

**apatel27** (5): Can definitely tell she's a disney girl from this milquetoast punk

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): im convinced at this point that anyone who thinks this song is a 10 has just never listened to a good pop punk song before in their lives

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (5): very fun intro that doesn't truly go anywhere (at least not anywhere great)

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (4): I’m still not a huge fan of this one, and I haven’t figured out why yet.

**majid** (4): i just really despise these angsty lyrics and i'm not a fan of pop punk in general

**DefaultPophead** (3): The only song that made my Spotify Wrapped that I skip. It was fantastic but gets old quick. Now, I can't listen to it.

**ReallyCreative** (3): this is a song I can see her regreting releasing in like 5 years, I know I regret her releasing it now!

**Alumineous** (0): I roll my eyeballs at the lyrics. And I don't like punk rock. The weird processing on her voice made the lyrics even worse.

**Iris3271** (0): I know this is an unpopular opinion I just find this very unpleasant to listen to

We love a good post-album single campaign!

Personally, what I want is not ever having to think about physical transport phenomena again, but we can't all get what we want. What I think is interesting about this song is that it's a huge hit in the Netherlands (where I (Jules) am from). Like, "MONTERO (CALL ME BY YOUR NAME)" and "INDUSTRY BABY" were doing alright here, but this is still smashing super hard on radio. I hear it every single time I go to the store. And what I fucking want is to hear it EVEN MORE! Because it's just that good.

#IT DON'T FEEL RIGHT WHEN IT'S LATE AT NIGHT AD IT'S JUST ME AND MY DREAAAAMS

**astrologicalangel** (11): that's what I want too 😔

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (11): why is this my 11? Idk listen to it.

**DirtyRat583** (11): i love this song so much. it evokes the feeling of flying away very quickly, over a beautiful beach by a cool little forest and it's a blue sky with no clouds. I'm basically describing the set of the solar power mv here, but that is the vibe I get when I listen to this song and picture flying away. the difference is that while solar power was mediocre (it wasn't bad, like I'll listen to it and tolerate it, but it is nowhere near her previous albums), this song is amazing and I love it so much. it's a very weird vibe and thought to get (not that that's entirely bad, the world is a terrible place and whatnot but flying away seems silly even though it would be SO MUCH fun to do) but I can't get it out of my head it's THE perfect song to fly away to

**rotating3Dtext** (11): I want more of this sound in the mainstream, that’s what I fucking want

**Roxieloxie** (11): I love this song so much

**SFbby** (11): Gay yearning at its finest

**akanewasright** (10): “CUZ IT DONT FEEL RIGHT WHEN ITS LATE AT NIGHT AND ITS JUST ME AND MY DREAMS” is a chorus that should be taught in songwriting classes, like… DAMN

**Awkward\_King** (10): this was probably my second 11 option bc its not only a song that means a lot to me but also goes fuckin hard

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): Just so much fun, with a stupidly catchy hook.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): runner up for my 11 this is so fucking good

**ebooks #5454** (10): tbt when this song came out and my lil bro wanted to watch the m/v with me and creme...big fucking mistake...so awkward that was...

**emmaelf** (10): an absolute bop. i had no idea lnx could create such a fun, singing-centric chorus but it's amazing. highlight of the album.

**flavasavavandal** (10): Better pop-rock than the other two pop-rock frontrunners in the rate

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): So much angst crafted into a song that's very top of 2021 material. I wish the choir coming in a little for Dead Right Now was actually here, give me catharsis! I guess that's the one thing I'd like

**frogaranaman** (10): my buddy Eric went through the same thing

**ImADudeDuh** (10): AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH im gay

**jman457** (10): The best song about Gay Yearning since Visions of Gideon

**jsonphile** (10): damn it Lil Nas X stop making your music so relatable

**modulum83** (10): no mom i was watching the Lil Nas X - THATS WHAT I WANT music video for a school project its for research

**nootnoot781** (10): memes aside, it’s fucking crazy to me that we have an out and proud gay pop star singing about being gay? obviously we’ve had elton john, george michael etc. but to have someone making charting hits whilst being unapologetically queer about it would blow my younger self’s mind. like i just thought out gay pop stars like troye sivan and hayley kiyoko had to remain flops but i was wrong 😊

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): I don’t wish to enjoy his music as much as I do. He’s said plenty of morally reprehensible stuff before his fame. He’s far from the best vocalist in mainstream music. Yet I can’t help but want to root for a queer black man who’s the rare point of relatability in mainstream music for queer people of color - and hell, he knows how to make a song work despite his many shortcomings because his charisma and ear for melodies are just so phenomenal. That’s not what truly makes this song amazing though. The outright display in homosexual yearning resonates in such a delectable way, with one of the best choruses of 2021. The anthemic chorus and cheeky rap delightfully throw back to late 00s/early 10s pop saccharine corniness.

**plastichaxan** (10): HIT

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): also a ten for the maury episode

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): the first line is the most relatable lyric I heard throughout all of 2021

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): I don’t understand how this wasn’t a bigger hit, it’s pop perfection.

**RandomHypnotica** (10): bitch me too tf?? lets hook up 😳

**ReallyCreative** (10): glad this song is taking off, very quietly the best song on the album

**runaway3212** (10): We love unrequited love

**skargardin** (10): THAT'S WHAT I FUCKING WANT!!

**static\_int\_husp** (10): I fucking hate capitalism because I associate this song with Taco Bell now and it's so much better than that

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): relatable even tho i'm in a long term relationship

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): the wedding scene in this music video literally changed my life

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Yes please :)

**throwaway-7650** (10): the rap in the 2nd verse is giving red velvet irene & yeri

**TiltControls** (10): So glad this is blowing up now. Everything about this song is so good.

**Uberpigeon** (10): he had sex

**UselessTacooo** (10): Brokeback Mountain looks different here

**1998tweety** (9.5): BOP

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): bitch me too the fuck

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): definition of an earworm

**xedophobic** (9.2): that's what i fuckin want too, mr x

**AHSWeeknd** (9): The guitar is IT

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this needs to go number one and I'm calling it, it'll reach the top five later this year!

**Alumineous** (9): I am slowly turning into a Lil Nas X fan. My god, coming from Planet Her, these songs are actually hitting.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): a song that all of popheads can relate to because I know almost everyone on this sub is lonely

**BasedButta** (9): this is such a jam this guy has a gift with guitars

**jasannn** (9): I feel young again. (I say as a 22 year old)

**just\_thonking** (9): For me, this has the same energy as Solo by Carly Rae Jepsen, in that it's a bit generic but also so comforting that I am willing to overlook its genericness

**babadork** (8.7): There’s a hint of an interpolation of “Hey Ya!” in this that I think is very clever.

**fairytalehigh** (8.7): "Need a boy who can cuddle with me all night" same sis

**FroyoFox\_125** (8.5): Solid single choice since it's so fucking catchy! Also we love a little pop rock moment

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): the pre chorus and chorus is really good but I don’t love this song as much as lot of other people. The verses are like of weak and drag down the song a bit. And LNX being a weaker singer makes the chorus lose impact a bit. And hearing this after industry baby is kind of a let down cause that song is so much more hype.

**AzettImpa** (8): btw what about the art of realization? did y'all leave it out on purpose :')

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8): This feels just a little generic but…in a fun way!

**DefaultPophead** (8): I'm glad this became a hit. I enjoy it every time I hear it on the radio.

**hikkaru** (8): i love how unabashed this is about speaking on mlm yearning :catcry:

**IIIHenryIII** (8): this is just a deyassified hey ya, but it's not bad? I think it's a grower

**imbaby122** (8): yassified outkast 🤩 i love you lil nas x that should be enough 🙏

**iniekcja\_** (8): ah another Zara staple

**Verboten\_Prince** (8): He cannot hit those high notes for shit. But as a fellow tenor who has trouble hitting high notes, the fact that this song still managed to become a hit in spite of all that gives me hope that I too could someday make it

**wasian-invasion** (8): kinda basic but it slaps and its gay

**welcome2thejam** (8): Great hook. Not the best voice but dude sells it and makes it work

**you2009** (7.7): lego movie music

**jaztinax** (7.5): it’s good but also kind of annoying?? you know??

**MassiveThief** (7.5): amazing chorus but the verses kind of annoy me. the way he sings the very first line also pisses me off, something about his voice is just off

**slimboyfriend** (7.5): Since kids in Florida can't hear the word "gay" in school, I'm glad that they can at least hear Lil Nas X ask for a boy to cuddle with on the radio

**vayyiqra** (7): I didn't care for this at first but :pensive: lyrics over a upbeat song is a combo that always hits, so I raised my score.

**waluigiest** (7): I feel like taking the key down a step would have made his voice feel so much more powerful. It really sounds like he’s struggling at times, and his low range is beautiful

**thedoctordances1940** (6.6): as basic as the chorus is, it is really good but the rest is just empty

**ktajlili** (6): Unpopular opinion, but this song is kind of generic to me.

**nooodisaster** (6): Literally the gay agenda

**ormysonormysonormys** (6): I think this is the weakest song but it still bops

**MrMoodle** (5): Verses are good but the chorus reaches Smile era levels of Target commercial fodder

**ricki** (5): :( i want it to hit but it just doesn't

**shipperondeck** (4.9): i still reallyyyyy don't like the chorus, it's giving yoplait commercial... mv is great though

When Olivia was just becoming really popular, I was still a bit catious. Yeah, I liked "drivers license," but I didn't get its instant success, and I was worried she might not be able to replicate it and would maybe flop with her follow ups, especially if they were more ballads. "deja vu" learned from _Happier Than Ever_ school of making the second half more catchy and better. It also learned from the "Cruel Summer" school of making a slay bridge. But it still felt like a new sound on the scene when it dropped and instantly made me realize how much more potential Olivia had that she hadn't shown on "drivers license."

---

#"Cruel Summer" is never going to be a single

**dropthehammer11** (11): some of my favorite synth work in any song period. absolutely blissful

**Humble-Ad-1628** (11): I just love the chords and the lyrics

**jasannn** (11): it’s so simple but the little details such as the “ha ha ha ha…” to the whispered “i love you” to the repeat of the first verse during the bridge really makes this song

**pig-serpent** (11): Pop stars keep releasing banger psych pop songs and yet this hasn't become a trend yet?  We got Deja Vu and Fallen Fruit in the same year and nobody is trying to rip it off?  We deserve better.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (11): *deafening industrial synth noise*

**tickframe** (11): yeah this is my eleven, this song is crack to my ears

**1998tweety** (10): massive bop

**AHSWeeknd** (10): Underrated tbh

**akanewasright** (10): this was the single that really started to win me over. Like… Drivers License could have been a fluke, but this (to me at least) showed that she not only did she have other facets to her, but she was *good* at making more upbeat/poppy tracks.

**Alumineous** (10): HahahahHahahaHA. I don't listen to Taylor Swift so I have no context for that. But girl, stop stalking your ex-man, it’s not cute lol. Or making up stuff in your head, it’s not healthy.

**Awkward\_King** (10): god this song breaks me

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): (Gabe Lewis voice) shut up about cruel summer! SHUT UP ABOUT CRUEL SUMMER!

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I don’t care if the outro rips off the Cruel Summer bridge! If that song couldn’t be a hit this is the next best thing!

**bluexplus** (10): pure bop

**CarlieScion** (10): ‘watching reruns of glee’  she just like me fr fr

**celladonn** (10): Very good, the Billy Joel line is so silly but gets stuck in my head constantly

**DefaultPophead** (10): Yes, this might be a Radiohead rip-off, but I love both songs. She sounds absolutely gorgeous here. I don't know why she added Billy Joel and Glee into the song if she doesn't listen or watch them, she could've picked something real, but I get that most of her songs are about made up stories. Just kinda sucks, but I like this song enough to not penalise it.

**emayzee** (10): my only complaint about this is that she has never actually watched glee but included that lyric anyway

**fairytalehigh** (10): as a millennial, i am ancient, which makes billy joel some sort of eldritch demigod spoken of in whisper and legend. STREAM SCENES FROM AN ITALIAN RESTAURANT

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): The vocals are sl good, the melodies memorable and the sound a comfortable home for her developing musical identity. I want to hear her in this dream pop space for days, and being honest the lyrics fit my deluded middle school daydreaming so well I have a nostalgia for it too. I can excuse the references to the evil of 21st century culture known as Glee, but I draw the line at her gatekeeping music!

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): Honestly her best single and probably her best song to date!

**hikkaru** (10): tbt to last summer when i was drinking with friends outside and this song was playing and i wanted to sing it so bad but i was also throwing up so i ended up yelling the lyrics in between spewing all over the grass

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Omg I love it it’s so talented, brilliant, incredible, amazing, show stopping, spectacular, never the same, totally unique, completely not ever been done before, unafraid to reference or not reference, put it in a blender, shit on it, vomit on it, eat it, give birth to it.

**imbaby122** (10): this is my entire family’s favorite o-rod song there’s nothing more satisfying than singing this in the car with my mom and my sisters i miss it so much❤️❤️❤️

**jman457** (10): My favorite of the lead singles, so of course it was the one that didn't become a hit

**ManofOranges** (10): Me when something seems familiar

**musical\_pyn** (10): maybe the best produced song on the album, there's so much going on here that's just soooo good

**OliviaGodrigo** (10): This was the song that really clicked with everyone like wow.. this girl has something to offer to mainstream music. OliviaGodrigo has been here from the start though. Only real Bizaardvarkinators would know.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (10): brilliant beat switch in the middle

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): this grew on me a lot

**RandomHypnotica** (10): copyright holders when they're listening to SOUR

**ReallyCreative** (10): she slayed your honor

**runaway3212** (10): Olivia really knows the power of details in storytelling and in songwriting, that is what makes this song so great, there’s so many details and all of them add to the larger story

**shipperondeck** (10): fav OR single, totally sold me on what she was doing. perfect for angrily driving by the beach!! although she acts like billy joel (uptown girl in particular lmao) is some kind of well-kept secret or something though which is kind of funny

**skargardin** (10): deserved to smash tbh

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): the hold this bridge had on me

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I This ranks amongst the meanest songs ever written

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (10): Ok, but the way that she repeated some of the lyrics from the song in the outro! Like actual déjà vu! You call it lazy writing, I call it genius!

**UselessTacooo** (10): The highlight of her career so far. Sure Drivers License has the power-ballad hit going for it, and G4U is an upbeat rock bop, but nothing comes near the blissful summerpop of deja vu.

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Sounds like a dream, a perfect blend of the moody pop and pop punk that this album encompasses

**waluigiest** (10): the bridge of this song is a deja vu of the first two thirds of the song, and that’s when I knew she was something special

**wasian-invasion** (10): did NOT expect this production from a HSMTMTS star

**welcome2thejam** (10): Drivers License was good and all, but this was the "Olivia Rodrigo you now have my attention" single. Second fave song in the rate

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (10): i was very tempted to take away a point because olivia never actually watched glee prior to writing this

**modulum83** (9.7): the best thing about the new generation of pop stars is that they are just as much music nerds as we are

**jsonphile** (9.5): kinda bummed this one didn’t get as big as the other singles, but on the other hand that means I never got tired of it

**TiltControls** (9.5): Took a little while to grow on me, but I really appreciate the atmosphere she sets up here

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): there's a reason why it's one of my favorite song from her, ever

**astrologicalangel** (9): omg Olivia invented Billie Joel

**BasedButta** (9): she knows the secret to my heart. MORE PERCUSSION INSTRUMENTS!

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9): my favourite song from Lover!!! /s

**poemforsmallthings** (9): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W761DtH1oRg&ab_channel=Dreamcatcherofficial

**slimboyfriend** (9): Olivia needs to fulfill the prophecy and make the psychedelic stoner pop album that Solar Power was supposed to be.

**vayyiqra** (9): feel like I've heard this before :thinking:

**cremeebrulee** (8.6): i love shoegaze

**nooodisaster** (8.5): Grew on me, and perfectly placed in the album. Also that bridge, she really is from the school of Swift.

=====

ph2021ultimate: **Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): This song wins the award for the song that grew on me the most over this past year. I used to not be a fan of it, but I’ve really grown to appreciate it. The way it evolves is genuinely masterful.

**AzettImpa** (8): it gets better as it progresses

**bookthieving** (8): normalize not knowing billy joel

**ignitethephoenix** (8): if Olivia did watch glee I bet she envisioned herself as Rachel and Sabrina as Quinn Fabray

**kappyko** (8): "Cruel Summer" and Lorde references aside, I think the most interesting referent for this that might not be an actual influence at all is Youth Lagoon's album *The Year of Hibernation*. The chiming bells, the lo-fi drums, the guitars, the build to a CLIMAX all weirdly enough feel indebted to 2010s bedroom pop, and specifically that album. I think my problem with this and "Drivers License" is that both kind of have weak endings despite their appeal hinging on them.

**ormysonormysonormys** (8): whenever I think the album needs to get a new perspective there’s another angle

**qazz23** (8): good drums and synths, second best of the singles

**babadork** (7.9): I love when a breakup song is specific, but no one except Glee cast members and their families are watching so many reruns that it’s a feature of two relationships.

**rotating3Dtext** (7.8): Lorde Melodrama??

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7.5): dreamcatcher did NOT create the greatest song named deja vu of all time only to place 12th in the smackdown rate and for this song to outplace it

**you2009** (7.5): the synth towards the end...!

**ebooks #5454** (7): cue me and my housemate screaming "I TAUGHT YOU BILLY JOEL" to each other all of our last term after listening to this when it debuted

**fadedblue09** (7): The airy first verse and the rock influences….intriguing combo but something's missing

**jaztinax** (7): the weakest single imo, but i love the storytelling in this

**MrMoodle** (7): OMG stream underrated indie gem Billie Joel???

**Uberpigeon** (7): i have deja vu from hearing this every day in my retail job

#something something Taylor Swift

**emmaelf** (6.5): just not as impactful as i think it could be, not sure exactly what's missing for me.

**frogaranaman** (6): shut the fuck up about "Cruel Summer", every summer is cruel because of the heat

**LesApfels** (6): I'm sorry Olivia but knowing Uptown Girl is not a personality trait

**QuaxlyDuck** (6): reminds me of Rostam's Half-Light

**xavieryes** (6): much like Drivers License, it's quite mediocre until it hits the bridge

**flavasavavandal** (5): one thing i gotta appreciate about this song is it was the moment that made me realise that Olivia Rodrigo actually enjoys listening to music

**majid** (5): the production is slightly interesting

**nootnoot781** (5): it is certainly the best lorde song to come out of 2021

**Stryxen** (4.5): put me in the cruel summer section

**thedoctordances1940** (4.2): it has some really cute parts instrumentally and melodically but the lyrics are genuinely abysmal and the "drop" if i can call it that is kinda annoying

**MassiveThief** (3): this has the makings of a song I'd really like but I honestly can't stand it. the way she sings "do you get deja vu when she's with yyOOOOUUUU" kills it for me.

**seanderlust** (1): okay, to explain why i don't like this one, i'm going to compare its lyrical sentiment to traitor. this is a breakup album by a teenager so there's gonna be some juvenile teenager-y feelings in it - that's pretty unavoidable. teenage breakup feelings never play fair, but traitor feels like it's unfair in a fair way - like, yeah it's not fair for olivia to make judgments on how fast her ex moved on but that's a pretty understandable reaction. this though? i did that with you so nobody else can because it's our thing? what, did you lick the billy joel CD, olivia? the idea that her ex shouldn't go on some of the same dates with his new fling because ~that was our thing~ feels unfair in an unrelatable way. maybe he's doing it with his new partner because those things are fun, olivia, and maybe you don't have a monopoly on strawberry ice cream and the show glee and uh...being an actress? this gets a 1 because it is the only song on this album that annoys me to the point that i want to take joshua bassett's side, out of pure spite.

**CrimsonROSET** (0): i dont like this! I’ll stand by it! While I like the concept a lot, I think the execution is a bit sloppy sonically with just so many ideas that don’t go anywhere, and while the lyrics are fine, there are some absolute clunkers, and she sounds so washed out in that last chorus- and I’d be fine with it if I wasn’t forced to listen to it so much because it was one of the biggest songs in the world for a while! And people keep saying it was better than drivers license and good 4 u, and I’m sure those are going to be accused of overstaying their welcome, but I ask you all to fight the real enemy.

**plastichaxan** (0): the way this made me act like one of those boomers criticizing her but it’s just not good thank god

Line up at the start. The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start.

OLIVIA OUT!

Remember when this was supposed to be a dead lock for second place? Well, during the entire run of this rate, it never even made the top 3. That said, it's still absolutely a slay song. Her biggest hit and her best performing song here too, it's obviously good. She really just changed the game with this one, it's so catchy and so great and also can we be happy about the guitar returning to us in 2021. Truly iconic.

#LIKE A DAMN SOCIOPATH!

**babadork** (11): That therapist line is “You Oughta Know” level.

**moooo566** (11): i love paramore

**NFLfreak98** (11): It’s like if someone made a pop punk song with a good singer

**QuaxlyDuck** (11): this makes me feel like a heartbroken 16 year old girl even though I'm a guy who didn't start dating until my 20s.

**sweetnsoursauce11** (11): what can i say about this song i haven't said before???? it deserved every ounce of its success

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (11): the 11 on the right side of history

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): That instrumental right before the bridge has no right to be as good as it is.

**BasedButta** (10): sorry for being such a basic bitch but this is my favorite song here, we have been sorely missing fast rock-inspired songs in the popsphere lately and this is just great, even if a bit by the books

**hikkaru** (10): the misery business credit is dumb but PARAMORE COMEBACK 2022 AHHH

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): Where all the lurid drama that got left out of Traitor went.

**racloves** (10): I love an angsty break up song

**ReallyCreative** (10): good 10 u

**skargardin** (10): it is the serve

**static\_int\_husp** (10): Olivia,,, welcome to the business of misery

**sufjancaesar** (10): There’s some sort of crack in this cause it’s addictive as hell

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): happy and healthy, I wouldn't believe it

**TiltControls** (10): everything about it is really just so much fun. Really loving the pop rock revival and so glad that this blew up alongside it

**waluigiest** (10): I think I listened to this 6 times in a row the night it dropped. It scratches a particular itch!

**welcome2thejam** (10): Insert Lucille Bluth "Good for her" meme here

**fairytalehigh** (9.7): cupcakke version outsold tbqh "GOOD FOR YOU YOU LOOK HAPPY AND HORNY NOT ME IF YOU EVER CARED TO ASK" "I've lost my mind, I've spent the night cumming on the floor of my bathroom"

**bigbigbee** (9.5): My name is Tristan Taylor and I think there should be MORE (songs that are heavily inspired by Misery Business) in media

**flavasavavandal** (9.5): petition to make Olivia put the Misery Business mashup on the album instead

**Iris3271** (9.5): I can't relate at all my exes are down terrible but she popped off!

**lost-ln-the-echo** (9.5): good 4 her

**slimboyfriend** (9.5): in February 2021 I told my boyfriend, an immediate Olivia Rodrigo stan, “I don’t think Olivia Rodrigo will ever commercially or critically top Driver’s License.” Well.

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): this feels so good to listen and the music video fits with the theme of the song

**AzettImpa** (9): loved it, would've been a 10 if it was more original

**CrimsonROSET** (9): boring winner boo tomato tomato

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): The snark towards her ex works exactly once and it's here

**jsonphile** (9): I did get tired of this song after some time, but yeah it slaps

**nooodisaster** (9): LIKE A DAMN SOCIOPATH!!!

**pig-serpent** (9): I love this song and it's one of my favorites in the rate but honestly there's so much pop punk out there that I think is better so it's hard to justify giving this higher.

**qazz23** (9): catchy but it does have similarities w/ misery business

**Tr1skaid3kaphobia** (9): An absolute headbanger. I feel so much rage when I listen to this song.

**imbaby122** (8.5): she gave levels and performance and personality she’s a theater kid playing a punk im obsessed

**shipperondeck** (8.5): i don't get the misery business comparisons. like jesus christ do people not know what genre is. anyway another great summer song i love this song. the rest of my family maybe not so much since i blasted it for months

**thedoctordances1940** (8.5): grown off me quite a bit over time but still a banger

**modulum83** (8.3): remember when this came out and we all thought it was the greatest song of all time

**RandomHypnotica** (8.1): i just wish this went a *fraction* harder than it does

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8): I like it a lot but this is not the best song on the album, the guitars are super weak and watered down

**frogaranaman** (8): the song that made me truly understand the Olivia hype. GOD, this song rips so hard and is such a good "fuck you stupid ass bitch" song

**iniekcja\_** (8): I can't even hate her for being younger than me with a vocal performance like this

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): i dont care if she ripped this off from paramore actually she did it better than them

**FroyoFox\_125** (7.5): This song is good, but I don't like it as much now that it's so overplayed :sob:

ph2021ultimate: **akanewasright** (7): So like. One time I convinced myself a friend of mine who lived really far away from me died. I basically no evidence other than my anxiety running amuck, but it fucked me up HARD. So I was doing my mental illness, and it got so bad that I didn’t want to listen to music, which essentially does not happen to me. Like I have music playing 24/7 to fit my mood, but in this case it just… didn’t sound good. There was nothing I could play to make myself feel better or worse, just… more restless and empty. But I was trying to do self care, so I got on the treadmill to work out, trying to get endorphins pumping and shit. I got annoyed with the silence and decided to listen to “good 4 u” to drown out some bad thoughts. So what I’m saying is “this song is good, but it reminds me of flinging my body like a zombie on my treadmill while wanting to disappear and preemptively mourning my friend” (who by the way is perfectly fine).

**ignitethephoenix** (7): sure it bops but I have found this overrated for awhile. Her voice is so strained especially in the chorus and I can’t stand it when singers out sing what they can comfortably to

**xavieryes** (7): fun chorus, the rest of the song is there i guess

**you2009** (7): I'm not even mad like I just wanna talk like no who said I was mad I just think it's so funny that

#lost their mind

**jman457** (6.6): Im a bit of an emo-anti, but it's fun I guess

**cremeebrulee** (6.4): brutal does the pop punk sound better and with less cringy lyrics tbh. like i get the anger behind this, but i find some of the lines hard to listen to, e.g. the therapist line just gives me secondhand embarrassment

**kappyko** (6): holy freaking crud did she just say THE F WORD

**Stryxen** (5.9): put me in the misery business section

**MrMoodle** (5): Yeah so brutal kind of came and took a fat shit all over this song, Olivia proved she could easily do better and now this just feels pretty limp imo. Not bad by any means but just, meh.

**Treecoh** (5): hailey williams is annoying af for getting royalties for this song but i will admit misery business is better.

**apatel27** (4): How people thought this would bring back a pop punk revival is beyond me

**buzzyrecky** (4): overrated and kinda annoying imo

**ebooks #5454** (4): i hosted a party last year and someone shut off my party playlist to play this instead and i was fucking mad bc ITS NOT THE VIBES

**MassiveThief** (3.5): liked it on first listen but got worse everytime I heard it to the point that it's auto skip. and god it feels like it's EVERYWHERE (because it is). oh but paramore getting money off of it is so incredibly dumb

**DefaultPophead** (3): For fun, I wanted to rate this a four, but it's not good enough for that. If I wanted to listen to Misery Business, I would, but I would rather not listen to that song or this one ever again. The sociopath and therapist lines are truly awful. People talk about them like she really did something great...

**fadedblue09** (1): Dont get why this is so loved. Very typical pop-rock pastiche. At least Brutal offers something refreshing

**AHSWeeknd** (0): people are always like “this song sucks because I work in retail!!” That. That is the reason.

**majid** (0): this is literally one of the most obnoxious and grating songs i have ever heard, from the angsty teen-esque writing style to the blandest chord progression you could use, and the watered down production does not help it. this resurgence of pop punk has not impressed me at all.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (9.909): call me pH 14 for this basic-ass opinion but this is the best release of 2022, no other album touches it

**AHSWeeknd** (9.000): SOlar poUeR

**RandomHypnotica** (8.700): Honestly, it's painfully clear that this started out as a really solid EP, and with Olivia's overnight success it was expanded to an LP, and as such there's some tracks on here that just aren't as developed or essential, but a majority of it is extremely well rounded and i'm excited to see where she goes from here

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.636): Took me over a year to listen to this but glad I did. She does sound a bit one note at times due to the subject matter but, then again, she's just a teenager. It will be fun to see how this stack up to the rest of her discography years down the line. Overall, good album. 8/10

**jasannn** (8.636): I really shouldn’t have connected to this album as much as I did. Im 22 years old and I haven’t really been in a relationship let alone had a messy breakup. But these lyrics and her compelling delivery got to me. On first glance, it seems like she’s writing about the same topic in each song but each song differs in the slightest way that reveal another side to her feelings and the relationship. This was easily my favorite album of 2021.

**babadork** (8.436): This album came out at the perfect time for me. Covid restrictions had me feeling like a teenager, so it was a good time for the music I listened to back then to have a resurgence. I was also listening to a lot of musical theater songs, and I think her acting abilities is what makes these songs work so well.

**Alumineous** (8.364): Besides from Brutal and Jealousy, this was an absolute treat. Flawless album. It's pretty simple lyrically. Her heart was broken by this jackass. Her voice affected me, like she amplified her lyrics with her raw, emotional voice.

**TiltControls** (8.364): Okay I think a lot of the criticisms about this album are super valid, but then I listen to it and Olivia's voice gives me a dose of seratonin and I imagine the random album cuts will be going day 1 anyways so I feel fine overrating this

**runaway3212** (8.364): I literally dont even care this was the AOTY 2021

**jaztinax** (8.318): if i were prompted to talk about SOUR 6 months ago, i’d spend all of my breath rraving about olivia, and while my feelings for the music itself haven’t changed that, there’s just so much that has happened since she released this album that have caused my feelings to sour (pun intended) a bit. still - this is a wonderful debut for someone who skyrocketed as fast as olivia did. it does feel like a young taylor swift deja vu experiencing this album, just taking in the heartbreak and bitterness of a talented, young girl with big dreams. i’m only slightly disappointed that the songs are all a bit too similar (with the exception of brutal and hope ur ok) in terms of themes and messages. of course it’s a breakup album, but it does sound like she’s repeating the same story over and over again. for a debut album that came as fast as it did though, she did absolutely amazing with these songs, and all the records she broke and all the attention she got was deserved. so i’m really looking forward to see what more she has in store.

**jsonphile** (8.318): I don’t know if this is the weakest album, but Olivia is probably my least favorite artist out of these four. But that’s more of a testament to how great the other three are, because Olivia has impressed me with her music. For a debut album from a 17 year old, it is really solid, and captures teenage heartbreak and angst pretty well. And I’m sure she’ll improve with future albums, so looking forward to good things from her. Anyway something something Joshua Bassett deserved better

**wasian-invasion** (8.273): idk how this girl made me actually wish I was back in high school and going through heartbreak but somehow she did. I was constantly surprised throughout last year with each new release and can't wait to see where she goes from here

**Verboten\_Prince** (8.182): If there’s one thing to take away from this album, is that Olivia’s follow-up album is going to SLAP. This whole thing isn’t perfect, but like so many other critics and fans have said, the makings of a true popstar are very visible within the lyricism, the melodies, and especially the emotive vocals. You can practically see the look on her face with every verse she sings. This album is definitely hindered by the repetitive break-up theme, but I still see it as a meaningful work, a necessary form of catharsis for Olivia. And more than anything, it makes me extra excited to see where she goes from here!

**nooodisaster** (8.136): The best album track by track I fear.

**sufjancaesar** (7.864): Sour’s rollout had the best marketing of the 4 albums…they nailed the angsty punk y2k thing from the album art to the music videos, even down to track titles. It’s all mad cohesive and I get why this hit for target audiences despite the thematic cringe. Her vocals are also excellent

**IIIHenryIII** (7.818): Love the fact that the bad songs are short. Guess I have to thank TikTok after all.

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (7.818): putting everything aside this is a pretty good debut

**just\_thonking** (7.773): The singles are so, so good, and the rest of the album certainly exists.

**vayyiqra** (7.545): The album I liked least when it came out, but figured it was simply because it's not for me; it's by a teenager for other teenagers, and I'm way older than that, so I thought I just didn't connect with it. That does still hold true of a lot of the lyrics, but I understand where they're coming from - I haven't forgotten what it was like being that age either. I do like the alt-rock sounds of this album more upon relistening since that's a genre I grew up liking, so there are a lot of 90s throwback kind of songs (and 00s songs lol you know the one). Not an album that I'm the target audience for, yes definitely, but I can see why it was so popular and a lot of her fans loved it.

**DevilsOfLoudun** (7.273): I know this sub was initially unsatisfied with all the ballads but honestly I enjoy the ballads more than the rock/punk influenced ones. Overall I think it's a very strong debut.

**iniekcja\_** (7.227): I think what stopped (and possibly still does) me from fully enjoying this album was how fabricated the whole thing felt?  All of the drama surrounding the release, instant rise on the charts, the themes never appeared authentic to me, and the raving reviews to a seemingly unimpressive album contributed to it massively too. Was I biased? Absolutely, especially considering the fact that I usually am not opposed to the "industry plant" concept at all. After almost a year, I definitely don't think it's a bad project, but I still struggle to understand the appeal it has to so many people

**bigbigbee** (7.227): I think that her lyricism is occasionally a LITTLE juvenile (not the subject matter - teenage emotions are interesting, relatable, and valid - just the way that they’re expressed sometimes feels like a first draft to me) but I think that this is an incredibly solid, promising first album and I’m really excited to see where she goes next.

**hikkaru** (7.227): this isn't a perfect album by any means, the overabundance of mid ballads bring it down a bit, but there's so much potential in here for someone that i'm sure will evolve to become a stellar artist. the bangers BANG and the best ballads are immensely impactful. so excited to see what she does next

**modulum83** (7.000): I don't really understand why this album is so beloved, but it acts as a great summary of the last decade in pop and where it got us, I think. All these zoomers are just picking apart their great taste in musical influences, but it's most clear here, with the obvious Lorde and Taylor echoes, along with a mash of nearly every sound that defined pop radio in the 2000s and 2010s. I may not like the lyrics, but if she keeps going, I think she can make something really good.

**oscarbrierley1** (7.000): this album makes me feel OLD very much a teenaged alum

**pig-serpent** (6.936): Oliva Rodrigo has a lot of talent but there's a reason most albums are 75% upbeat 25% ballad instead of 25% upbeat and 75% ballad.

**shhhneak** (6.927): This is an album that you just want to sabotage, y’know? But I can’t. I also appreciate the art direction for being the best and most consistent of this rate.

**sillyrabbit289** (6.909): 8

=====

ph2021ultimate: **akanewasright** (6.836): So when Olivia debuted, Drivers License was supposed to be the first single from an EP, and that was expanded to an 11 track album without a big announcement of I’m remembering right. And that… shows, honestly. This would be a better EP than an album. I’m not sure when the pop punk songs came into the picture, but an EP with them, drivers license, and one or two of the ~~filler~~ ballads that dominate the album makes a bit more sense as a whole than the album as a whole honestly. BUT I do like Olivia and am looking forward to her work going forward

**TheQueenofVultures** (6.682): What I find really charming about this album is that Joshua Basset dating a blonde girl might actually be the worst thing that has ever happened and I long for that simplicity

**MrMoodle** (6.591): This album is super front-loaded and definitely lulls. That being said, I appreciate this album for what it is. I never openly touted it but I think I had a bit of snobbish contempt towards pop culture throughout my teens, and as a result didn’t listen to much pop. But approaching my high school graduation, I started feeling remorseful that I never engaged with the culture of my time, I wasn’t gonna be able to look back and say, “yeah, this was the shit that defined my teen years, most of it’s fucking garbage but I love it anyway”. As a result I’ve been sort of hyperfixated on pop music and pop culture for a few years, but most of the time I feel like I’m more studying pop culture from a distance than actually being a part of it. I’m in my early 20s now so possibly a little beyond the demographic for this album (I know a bunch of ancient gays are gonna be reading this and thinking “ha, child” but it’s still true, this definitely feels like an album for <18s), but I think this is the first pop culture zeitgeist I’ve felt truly immersed in, and not just like I’m appreciating it on the outskirts. THIS is the shit I’ll weep for out of nostalgia in 20 years if I’ve haven’t been incinerated in nuclear hellfire by then lol. So, cheers for that Olivia.

**welcome2thejam** (6.545): Very up and down album. But Olivia's so promising that I'll accept the bumps for the really good stuff, and hopefully time and experience help raise her game to a more consistent level

**OliviaGodrigo** (6.545): If I had one wish in the world, it would be for Ms Rodrigo to forget every Taylor Swift song that has ever been made

**ebooks #5454** (6.536): not me listening to this album after sleeping at my partner's place for the first time and being very happy and in love and thinking "oh this album isn't too sad"

**jman457** (6.509): A wildly uneven album, but it feels daring and took chances in ways that makes me excited for her future career

**thedoctordances1940** (6.409): It has its moments and definitely shows promise but as a whole it's not a particularly good album, too many boring and just generally mid songs

**kappyko** (6.182): ok but when conan gray does the SAME SHIT....

**QuaxlyDuck** (6.182): gonna be honest, my love of this album boils down to only the 2 rock songs and drivers license

**cremeebrulee** (6.127): my god i'm glad i'm not a teenager anymore

**qazz23** (6.000): I like the more pop-punk stuff, wish there weren't so many ballads

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6.000): honestly i was kinda dreading listening to this album considering ive heard a lot of mixed opinions about it but it was better than i expected! it kinda drags near the end and i wish there was more sonic variety but there are worse disney actress debut albums out there.

**MassiveThief** (5.955): not bad but the subject matter gets old. [this meme](https://i.redd.it/ehmop580kv571.png) really says it all

**frogaranaman** (5.545): pretty good stuff for a debut

**fadedblue09** (5.091): Funny how the one album that pays homage to my favorite genres (acoustic singer-songwriter pop and pop-rock) is somehow my least favorite in the rate. Anyway, like others have said, I wish her songwriting range isn't just limited to heartbreak stuff because it got really tiring in the end. Then again, it’s just a debut, so who knows, she might pull her own HTE in a few years. Mixed feelings aside, it’s exciting to see a pop singer of Filipino descent as a Filipino myself

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (3.955): their text to me - "sldjflsdkjflasdjflsdjflkdsj" (idk it was a keyboard smash)

For the most part, _Happier Than Ever_ as an album is an honest, reflective, open and tender breakup record that truly explores Billie's state of mind over the past couple of years since her debut. But not "Oxytocin." "Oxytocin" is raunchy, horny, dirty and hot. She's teased this type of sound before with things like "bad guy" (in particular the last minute of that song), but this feels like her finally going full out, and it does NOT disappoint. The song was written with the explicit intention of being something that would be great at a concert, and that is evident the instant you hear that wobbly synth over the driving beat. Billie describes a lust so intense it makes God jealous, and exchanges her breathy, light vocals for a desperate shout as the song builds in intensity and continues to get more and more feral, before reaching its climax in the final breakdown.. It's mind-boggling that this was never pushed as a single, but I'm thrilled to see it make Top 5 and have so many other fans.

#lol cum

**cremeebrulee** (11): me doing my top 100 writeup, fully knowing i would have sex to this: omg guys it's not just about being horny there's actually a lot of nuance here 🙄🙄

**CrimsonROSET** (11): cuddly wuddly hormone

**fairytalehigh** (11): this song bangs harder than 99% of the men i've fucked

**flavasavavandal** (11): we love witchy gothic industrial house sex bangers

**iniekcja\_** (11): yes horny

**majid** (11): one of the only songs of hers that i listen to

**MrMoodle** (11): THIS ABSOLUTELY FUCKS - has the same ominous vibe of her debut album, but never falls into the teenybopper edgelord archetype unlike some of the tracks on that record (*cough* bury a friend *cough*), this is the exact maturation in Billie’s music I was praying for and now it’s here and it’s fucking euphoric

**musical\_pyn** (11): from the moment I heard this I was completely sold on the album as a whole, and I want to hear this live so badly

**plastichaxan** (11): there was no way this wasn’t my 11 it literally washes every song in this rate lmao

**RandomHypnotica** (11): this song spit on me and i thanked it

**runaway3212** (11): we love women in STEM

**UselessTacooo** (11): Modern day Copycat. Finneas absolutely nails the feeling with the production, and Billie’s vocals are perfect for the subject matter.

**2dina3dworld** (10): inject it straight into my veinnssss

**AHSWeeknd** (10): at first I was like “omg what a cool word” then I looked up what it meant…… \#feminism

**akanewasright** (10): I feel like there are interesting theological discussions to be had about the notion of God looking at people banging/being part of their sexual activity. Like… if the spirit of God runs through us all, they’re there with us as we fuck, aren’t they?

**Alumineous** (10): I need drugs for this song.

**Awkward\_King** (10): jesus i love cum jesus heyyyy jesus

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (10): this is the most sinister sounding h word song I have ever heard and it goes off

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): This is definitely more explicit than all the songs with an actual “explicit” tag on the album.

**CreepyMannequin** (10): This was an early favourite for my 11 before I changed my mind. Still a bop! I hope it goes far.

**ignitethephoenix** (10): this was my instant favorite on the album. Love the dark and sultry vibe of this and this would absolutely be a direction I would love Billie to keep going in (as I have always loved her more dark songs)

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I can't imagine Finneas and Billie recording this song together.

**jaztinax** (10): finneas should’ve taken notes on how to scream in a horny song because she made it sound super cool and he… did not. iykyk

**jman457** (10): Shake your ass with pleasure

**ormysonormysonormys** (10): just comes out of nowhere and hits you in the face

**pig-serpent** (10): Say it with me everyone: Why wasn't this a single?

**qazz23** (10): best track here, love the dark synth sound (11 candidate)

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): when i read the title i was afraid it was a drug reference. Luckily Billie gave me a science lesson in hormones that play a role in social bonding.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): This absolute madlass literally invited God to a threesome.

**racloves** (10): fucking love this song

**skargardin** (10): bop!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): honestly this would go off in a live setting easily one of her best

**TiltControls** (10): That production is so catchy. Really sells the song

**xedophobic** (10): i love the posterior pituitary

**poemforsmallthings** (9.7): pophead moment

**DefaultPophead** (9.5): If Billie Bossa Nova made me feel like the sexy love interest of the side character in a spy romance trilogy's second book, Oxytocin makes me feel like I am the main character of the whole series.

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): i love when she breaks out of her typical register with the YOU SHOULD REALLY GET AWAYYY its awesome

**jsonphile** (9.5): absolute bop

**shhhneak** (9.5): Not somebody on Genius saying this sounds like an ad in some gay porn video.

**jackisboredtoday** (9.3): I like that this sad breakup album has one moment where it pauses all of that for a horny, sweaty club banger like this

**seanderlust** (9.1): WHEW this flip around in the second verse

**you2009** (9.1): the oxytocin they gave me when I got out the icu just made me sleepy but so true billie :)

**aldwin\_is\_here** (9): because it's horny that I love horny things

**N454545** (9): I thought it was going to be about getting adducted to opioids because I can't read.

**nooodisaster** (9): SLIGHTLY overhyped, but MOSTLY a fucking banger. Festival setting this would be awesome. Finneas was sick for this beat.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (9): I can't help but envision dancing to this in a blue-green lighted room.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): CUM???

**TragicKingdom1** (9): i think this is slightly worse than the similar singles from her EP and debut but its definitely the sound she should be pursuing instead of the folk stuff

**vayyiqra** (9): I kind of have to like this because I studied neuroscience in college and also the beat bangs.

**waluigiest** (9): 🥵

**wasian-invasion** (9): I played this at a party and my friend called it halloween music :(

**1998tweety** (8.5): dark bop

**ebooks #5454** (8.5): -scared sobs in asexual-

**imbaby122** (8.5): how can u write a song this horny with ur brother? i’m close to my brother but i walked in on him and his gf once and didn’t talk to him for a week 😵‍💫

**lost-ln-the-echo** (8.5): wish it went a bit harder but this is  kind of a low-key banger

**MassiveThief** (8.5): definitely a stand out, perfectly captures the darkness that makes her music so cool

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I know it’s a banger and I know it’s about sex but that’s it

**ReallyCreative** (8.4): come on chemistry class

**AzettImpa** (8): I like the song but it's kinda weird that her brother produced it

**BasedButta** (8): fucked up electronic sounds my beloved

**emmaelf** (8): i like this but i'm not sure i can verbalise why, it makes me frantic chill

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): This song is so fun to listen to

**Stryxen** (8): perfume genius - eye in the wall but 2 points less good

**welcome2thejam** (8): Step back Billie, I'll have you know sensually singing about God is Sufjan's territory and don't you forget it

**modulum83** (7.8): if someone tried to use this as sex music with me i'd jump out the window in terror

"omg I love gay people!!! one of my best friends is gay! I'm literally so in touch with the gays and my gaydar is amazeballs. I also watch RuPaul's Drag Race I'm so great with the gays. will you be my gay best friend??"

#TELL ME YOU LOVE ME IN PRIVAAAATE

**aldwin\_is\_here** (11): after the fantastic song it's music video dropped, I shared it to my mom and when I was asked by her if I'm gay or bi or whatever, I was dead silent to her and scared but after a couple of days, I finally bravely came out to her and let's just say that removing that problem about being not accepted by your own mother for being bisexual is euphoric and mesmerizing, thanks Lil Nas X!

**celladonn** (11): Call me by your slayme

**darjeelingdarkroast** (11): moved the mountains, shifted the earth’s axis, gave us all universal basic income

**emmaelf** (11): masterpiece. and from the guy who made the horse rap song no less. bravo. i've never been a gay man and i've never taken cocaine but this song makes me feel like i have and i'm annoyed with my disrespectful gay lover.

**imbaby122** (11): last summer my little sister and i listened to this song on repeat while we bullied preteens on roblox and i think lil nas would appreciate that… this song holds an iconic place not only in pop culture but in a highlight of my life. best song ever it goes hard to this day.

**international-cry-52** (11): Gayest thing ever, I’m in love

**Iris3271** (11): One of my favorite songs of last year

**racloves** (11): I know the term “cultural reset” is WAY overused, especially by pop stans, but this really did have a massive cultural impact and deserves the 11 for that alone. But obviously the song sounds great too. I’ve listened to this so many times and it never gets old.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (11): (fyi, i am using the extended/music video version of this song for rating purposes, as i believe it is the most complete and realized version of this song, although i most likely would’ve 11’d the shorter version as well) have you ever listened to a song and immediately thought that this will be one of the most important songs of its generation before it even finished? that was my reaction with this song and its video. i can’t fully speak on the impact this song had, given that i am not black nor a gay man, but to see a pop song *this* unapologetically gay, from an artist who was wildly considered a “joke” and a one hit wonder up to this point, and for that song to become as massive around the world as it is…i mean its truly a once in a lifetime moment isn’t it? its just an absolute marvel, both of a song and a video, and absolutely deserves all of the praise it has and more

**AHSWeeknd** (10): FKA Twigs

**akanewasright** (10): Brilliant song, brilliant video, Lil Nas X CALL ME

**Alumineous** (10): First time hearing it! It’s really catchy! It’s a short song, but says nothing more, nothing less. After listening to this song, I now realize that Lil Nas and Doja are like cut from the same cloth. This rate is so horny.

**Awkward\_King** (10): bro its just a really fucking good song

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): It’s not just a song. It’s a cultural MOMENT. Lil Nas X is good at making those…

**CrimsonROSET** (10): gay

**devilonmytongue0** (10): was so hard not giving this an eleven

**fairytalehigh** (10): i would do ANYTHING to have heard the conversation that took place between LNX and his team when the armie hammer cannibal kink scandal broke

**frogaranaman** (10): I am so aggressively homosexual

**FroyoFox\_125** (10): The amazing gay bop I dserve

**hikkaru** (10): shoot a child in my mouth while you're riding i beg

**ignitethephoenix** (10): just icon behaviour , this song was the moment this year and deserves everything

**jasannn** (10): I hope to be in touch with my sexuality as this song is.

**jaztinax** (10): i mean… it’s iconic. shoot a child in your mouth while i’m riding? can it BE more iconic?

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): literally iconic

**modulum83** (10): i have a lot of words about this album as a whole but a not-insignificant part of my 10ing this is because this moment was just so magical to be a part of. even just hearing those opening guitar notes instantly takes me back to the last few months of my freshman year at college when i had this song on repeat everywhere i went. the music video, the outrage and the endless memes on lil nas x's twitter feed - it was an incredible time. and this is going to be one of the biggest songs of the decade that's going to play for years on the radio, and it has the line "shoot a child in your mouth i'm riding". perfection.

**MrMoodle** (10): Man this is just killer hook after killer hook. I really think Lil Nas X’s continued success wasn’t even remotely guaranteed, if this wasn’t a bop of the nth degree I don’t think he would’ve had a chance at staying relevant. He probably should’ve been a one hit wonder. But holy shit. This is just too easy to leave on loop, it never gets old.

**N454545** (10): iconic. would get the 11 if u included the video

**nootnoot781** (10): i want him to [redacted] me in private

**plastichaxan** (10): pretending this is the satan extended version cause satanism makes everything better

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): I love the Spanish sound to it

**RandomHypnotica** (10): i can't believe he invented homosexuality

**skargardin** (10): we love an actual cultural reset!

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): I wasn't sold at first, but I streamed to make conservatives mad and then I understood it

**TragicKingdom1** (10): not committing to the extended version as the main version is the only misstep of the era tbh

**UselessTacooo** (10): never thought gay smut would hit #1 but here we are

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): It was a cultural reset. The one-two punch of WAP and CMBYN almost made the entirety of conservative America self-destruct

**waluigiest** (10): his first excellent song. This blew my mind.

**xavieryes** (10): a cultural reset

**dropthehammer11** (9.5): that hook was absolutely fucking money ever since he teased it

**jsonphile** (9.5): wow funny horse boy is gay???

**ReallyCreative** (9.5): I wonder what STIs Satan has, does Hell have a free clinic?

**TiltControls** (9.5): A couple months later and the song has grown off me a little bit. But that MV is stellar

**seanderlust** (9.3): this man really got a song with the line "shoot a child in your mouth while i'm riding" to the #1 spot on the Billboard Hot 100...legend

**shipperondeck** (9.1): almost perfect but it's too short. i want so much more. original opinion i know

**1998tweety** (9): I mean come on now

**AzettImpa** (9): love but he sat on it for too long

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9): I like it a lot but I wish it was longer

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (9): The envy bit yes that was a tipping point for the male gays gaze

**IIIHenryIII** (9): was the movie an inspiration for the title?

**iniekcja\_** (9): something shifted the day this came out

**just\_thonking** (9): more like WGBT

**nooodisaster** (9): Song of the year!!!!!!! Motherfuckers if this does not get #1 I will riot.

**PrimaryCrusaders** (9): Would've given it a solid 10 if it was Satan's Extended Version

**DirtyRat583** (8.8): this score is mostly because ive grown tired of it but also its a whole 137 seconds. like what. there are longer interludes

**flavasavavandal** (8.5): needed a montage of the film it’s named after to this song ended in an edit of Lil Nas x snapping Oliver’s neck

**slimboyfriend** (8.5): I couldn’t get into this song when it first came out, and I think the problem was that I never got to go out to the club and get the experience of hearing the first few words and RUNNING to the dancefloor because this is a truly gay banger

**wasian-invasion** (8.5): im just saying id hit that satussy

**jman457** (8.4): Rosalia has been real quiet since this song dropped, but the music video is a better than the song

=====

ph2021ultimate: **Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): I just love the little guitar licks, and the big, “CALL ME BY YOUR NAME” at the end.

**Chidi\_Ariana\_Grande** (8): I bet anything that half the comments are some variation of “He put his whole Lil Nas Xussy into this”

**DefaultPophead** (8): I appreciate what this song did to people.

**fadedblue09** (8): Love the Latin guitar influences

**ImADudeDuh** (8): https://imgur.com/e26MjDj

**ktajlili** (8): I can understand why this was a hit. Lil Nas X comes in with high energy to deliver one of the catchiest, accessible hits of 2021. I loved it upon release, but it's worn on me a bit.

**ManofOranges** (8): It's earworm-y, I'll give it that

**vayyiqra** (8): Not being big on this when it came out, I still have to respect its cultural impact. It's good I guess. I'm not big on the Latin-pop kind of sound but then these same elements (dembow beats, acoustic guitar) can be found on Planet Her and I liked them there, so that's hypocritical. I raised my score for this song after realizing I was underrating it.

**welcome2thejam** (8): Sufjan fanfic gonna be wild for this one

**thedoctordances1940** (7.8): i really go a bit back and forth with this, sometimes i find it underwhelming, sometimes it really hits, feeling a bit kinder to it today i think

**CreepyMannequin** (7.5): This would be a perfect 10 if it had a bridge. It feels incomplete as is. Alas, streaming age….

**ebooks #5454** (7.5): fun, but not my cuppa tea

**Own-Photograph-4642** (7.5): solid intro

**Uberpigeon** (7.5): ok its good but i do not fully understand the hype!! its just kind of corny to me?? i think the video tricked everyone also i would NOT fuck the snake. why the fuck is the snake like that it could have been a sexy snake and it would make sense but the snake is so scary... i dont want the sucky sucky from a scary snake

**you2009** (7.5): loses points for being short

#anti Armie Hammer

**apatel27** (7): Carried by the MV

**cremeebrulee** (7): the MV was a moment ™️ but the song on its own is just alright

**pig-serpent** (7): This song feels exactly like WAP to me, in that it's a fine song but the best part is the cultural significance of it going to number one.  I get it a little more every time I hear it, but it still sounds unfinished to me.

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (7): This is a song where the cultural conversation surrounding it is much more significant than the song itself.

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (7): outstanding title track/opener but it never wowed me like other songs did

**sweetnsoursauce11** (6.8): ugh i feel bad for not liking this song more (esp in this sub lmao) but i'm not a fan of the vocals at all which really impacts my enjoyment. everything else is fun.

**MassiveThief** (6): that snippet lived in my head rent free until i heard the song, and like it's fine but also so samey. I love everything around the promotion of the song, but the song itself is just alright

**runaway3212** (6): honestly i never got the hype

**BasedButta** (5.5): love the clip but the song itself… not so much. I just need an instrumental with more meat to it - this one is dreary and imo drags the song down a lot. the TELL ME YOU LOVE ME IN PRIVATE part is awesome though.

**Stryxen** (5.5): i just find it annoying i'm afraid it’s a finely constructed song but his vocals are less than fine

And so, despite his promising start in this rate, Lil Nas X finds himself as the runner up. It was SO CLOSE (for most of the rate), but alas "Happier Than Ever" just kept getting a bigger lead, slowly but surely.

What can I say? This clearly was just one of the best pop songs of the past year. The production is literally godlike, Jack Harlow performs a career defining verse. And above all, this song somehow outgays "MONTERO (CALL ME BY YOUR NAME)" even without the music video. And good god, is the music video great. I'm not upset that this is second place, but also I wouldn't have been mad if this would've won. 

---

#I DON'T FUCK BITCHES, I'M QUEER

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (11): this song makes me understand why people are horny for jack harlow

**Epicallytossed** (11): Finished as my second favorite pop (or pop rap) song of the year only behind You Lose!

**frogaranaman** (11): we need the penis cut of the video!!

**ignitethephoenix** (11): this may be my favorite song to come out from last year. From the melody to the horns , even Jack Harlow straight AF verse, this song is just so hype and I just don’t get sick of it. Also the best thing Kanye has touched in years is this song

**just\_thonking** (11): Deserved all the hype/love that CMBYN got. It's a masterpiece and doesn't get old.

**lost-ln-the-echo** (11): I just love everything about this - lil nas sounds great, jack harlow's verse didn't quite hit at first but it's grown on me a lot, the beat, the horns!!!!! more pop-rap songs with horns please!!! Anyway, this is a huge banger

**pleasegivemeasword** (11): immaculate

**PrimaryCrusaders** (11): When you hear those horns, you just KNOW what you're gonna be in for.

**seanderlust** (11): this song sounds like a victory lap feels. triumphant as fuck, braggadocious in a way that feels earned. jack harlow can have an 11, as a treat.

**skargardin** (11): I need more absolutely maximalist bops like this from Lil Nas in the future omg what a moment

**thedoctordances1940** (11): While CMBYN did confirm that LNX could really still be a presence beyond Old Town Road (although that never really seemed like too much of a question), this confirmed that he could do it while making absolute fucking bangers! ...Well sometimes at least.

**TragicKingdom1** (11): the way this beat instantly become iconic

**Verboten\_Prince** (11): Don’t tell me you know the meaning of “hype” until you hear this song drunk at a gay bar!! That is hype!!! Also Jack Harlow, a man who I had zero interest in before and after hearing this song, dropped the bar of the year with “I send her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her asscheek 👏👏👏👏” It’s so fucking awful and tasteless but the sheer audacity of it turns it back around into something amazing

**welcome2thejam** (11): Gonna be a marching band staple for years. Everytime a sports game goes to commercial, this is gonna be one of the songs they play. Have a soft spot for jock jams, and Lil Nas X (plus Jack Harlow with the incredible assist) making one that's an absolute all-timer makes me so happy

**xavieryes** (11): I DON'T FUCK BITCHES, I'M QUEER, HA

**aldwin\_is\_here** (10): thank god you reached the top of the Billboard summits, me saying this song is deserving the top is underestimating how I really liked this song, the only reason why it's not an eleven is because it doesn't have me recounting an experience I'll remember.

**Alumineous** (10): This is the first time I’m hearing it, and I like it. I love the introspection. And Mr Harlow saying hand print on her asscheek, oh my lord.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): If you don’t think this is a bop, I’m seriously concerned.

**AzettImpa** (10): purrrrr jack harlow awakens something in me

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): “I didn’t peak in high school I’m still out here getting cuter” - lyric of the year.

**celladonn** (10): Bangerrrr, this song just doesn't get old

**CreepyMannequin** (10): What else can you say but BOP.

**cremeebrulee** (10): i'm sorry roxie but jack harlow deserves rights for this

**dropthehammer11** (10): i feel like this is going to be remembered down the line as a quintessential zoomer anthem

**fadedblue09** (10): A solid personal statement as an artist

**flavasavavandal** (10): we believe in Jack Harlow supremacy

**Friendly-Canary-3814** (10): Having two blockbuster moments in an album and these being excellent pop songs at that. Industry Baby is the crowning moment for me. The chemistry between Nas and Jack is great to watch onscreen and off screen alike

**hikkaru** (10): I'M JUST A LATE BLOOMER I DIDN'T PEAK IN HIGH SCHOOL I'M STILL OUT HERE GETTING CUTER

**ImADudeDuh** (10): I don’t think jack harlow will ever be as good as this

**imbaby122** (10): ANTHEM OF THE DECADE EVERYONE ELSE STOP TRYING UR NOT GONNA TOP THIS ‼️‼️‼️ lil nas x plz keep making hits so we can hear this in the halftime show…

**iniekcja\_** (10): big big shoutout to the Ariana grande school of enunciation

**jasannn** (10): how is this simultaneously for the gays and the straights?

**jaztinax** (10): best use of jack harlow that i’ve heard in my life

**jsonphile** (10): if you look up banger in the dictionary, this is what comes up. Seriously this slaps so hard, and Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow sound like they’re having so much fun I don’t know how anyone can’t enjoy this. Also I’m a straight guy but either of these guys could hit it

**kappyko** (10): ok but i better see the same energy when i submit No Hands to charity rate

**ktajlili** (10): It was great to see this hit number one! It's one of the most fun, high-energy pop-rap performances of 2021, and proves Lil Nas X as a capable, consistent hitmaker.

**Lipe18090** (10): babybae

**ManofOranges** (10): I'm ashamed of how much I actually like this song

**MrMoodle** (10): In response to that discussion post asking what song is “you” coded the other day, this song is me coded

**musical\_pyn** (10): jack harlow's verse is easily the best part of this and the rest of it is really good

**mysario** (10): the best thing Kanye has done since "I Love It"

**nootnoot781** (10): jack harlow i am anything you want me to be

**ormysonormysonormys** (10): in the context of the album it’s perfect because it follows Dead Right Now and shows the past before this victory lap in the present

**pig-serpent** (10): The first Lil Nas Song since the OTR remix that sounds like it's living up to its full potential.  The horns are fantastic, Lil Nas X and Jack Harlow are both spitting mad bars, better than I knew either of them were capable of, and "I didn't peak in high school I'm still out here getting cuter" is exactly the energy I need in my life at this moment.

**plastichaxan** (10): gay gay gay

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): this song is just so fun until I have to listen to Jack talk about leaving his hand print but then he goes away and it gets fun again

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): I DON’T FUCK BITCHES I’M QUEER

**RandomHypnotica** (10): this song is the sonic equivalent of a victory lap

**runaway3212** (10): Jack Harlow is the only hetersexual

**shipperondeck** (10): i liked cmbyn but this is the song that truly sold me to lnx. so LOUD in every best way possible. also i was in a marching band for years so maybe i'm biased abt the blaring trumpets i love them sm

**Stryxen** (10): bop :)

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): absolute banger, deserved all its success.

**TChalla1966** (10): I love the song but Jack Harlow verse is so meh

**TheQueenofVultures** (10): Once the horns start, you know you're in for it

**UselessTacooo** (10): gay!

**wasian-invasion** (10): im just saying id hit that harlussy

ph2021ultimate: **TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.9): alright fine. the jack harlow verse grew on me. im still not gonna give this a 10 though because i still think he’s out of place and a different guest rapper would’ve been better

**akanewasright** (9.5): I keep hearing the one line as “I ain’t lost since I’ve been gay yeah” and honestly I fucking wish that were me jdhdhd

**DirtyRat583** (9.5): d-d-daytrip took it to 9.5

**FroyoFox\_125** (9.5): Honestly, I've heard this song so many times, but I'm still not sick of it! Jack Harlow's verse still makes me laugh with the "handprint on her asscheek" part :skull:

**nlh1013** (9.5): a true banger

**sufjancaesar** (9.5): Fortnite core (complimentary)

**modulum83** (9.3): my track record so clean they couldnt wait to just bash me i must be getting to flashy yall shouldnt have let the world gas me its too late cause im here to stay and these girls know that im nasty i sent her back to her boyfriend with my handprint on her asscheek city talking we takin notes tell em all to keep makin posts wish he could but he cant get close og so proud of me that he choking up while he making toasts im the type that you cant control said i would then i made it so i dont clear up rumors wheres yall sense of humor im done making jokes cause they got old like baby boomers turned my haters to consumers i make vets feel like they juniors say your time is coming soon but just like oklahoma mine is coming sooner im just a late bloomer i didnt peak in high school im still out here getting cuter all these social networks and computers got these pussies walkin round like they aint losers

**apatel27** (9): 🎺🎺🎺

**Awkward\_King** (9): idc idc jack's verse is so good here im a roxieloxie anti idc

**BasedButta** (9): very great. even though i prefer his pop stuff more, this is a masterclass on rap

**CrimsonROSET** (9): see i like this a lot but i dont like how jack harlow is so set on making people not forget in this gay ass song that he’s straight

**DefaultPophead** (9): I'm sorry, I really like the Jack Harlow part. Forgive me.

**ebooks #5454** (9): ok i know his part is p good but why did everyone lose their shit over jack harlow he's really just some guy...

**ReallyCreative** (9): the way the girls on twitter lust over Jack Harlow is a case for the fucking FBI

**vayyiqra** (9): Ironically I thought "Dead Right Now" sounded more like a Kanye song that this one that Kanye literally produced, but I think that's because Lil Nas X falls into the same kind of genre being an eclectic pop-rap artist. The horn line to this is pretty great. Anyway idk why Jack Harlow is a thing must be some zoomer thing. I guess he's okay? idk

**waluigiest** (9): a musical victory lap!!

**jman457** (8.7): the Horns are so good

**Uberpigeon** (8.7): this should have been the first song

**Iris3271** (8.5): I have a love-hate relationship with Jack Harlow

**fairytalehigh** (8): it's a banger but it also sounds like any number of other rap bangers of the past 10 years, LNX can do better

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (8): the hold this song has on the radio lmao

**you2009** (8): not only is jack harlow on this point blank but he goes on for so long it's almost inhumane I can't in good conscious give this a 10 no matter what my heart tells me

**babadork** (7.8): I feel like Lil Nas X isn’t really known for his flow, but that first verse is great. Jack Harlow should not be bragging about being better looking than he was in high school. That should just be assumed.

#mad they didn't see Jack Harlow in the shower scene

**IIIHenryIII** (7): it's catchy

**MassiveThief** (7): as with almost every LNX song, I loved it when it first came out but don't listen to it much anymore

**nooodisaster** (7): the one time i will say this shoulda been shorter/tik tok length. if this was 2:30 i'd fuck with it wayyy more #pain

**ricki** (6.5): i hate jack Harlow's verse so much it's unreal

**shhhneak** (6.5): Still makes me laugh that Jack Harlow was, like, the 4th choice for this feature.

**1998tweety** (6): bops a bit, would be better without some of Jack's line (the weird line about cheating and objectification was a bit odd) but besides that it bops.

**TiltControls** (6): I am joining the anti-Jack Harlow brigade (at least for this song). LNX is a 10 here but I don't get the love for most of Jack's verse at all (the peaking line is the one saving grace)

**AHSWeeknd** (5): it’s overhyped ngl, Jack Harlow is great though (on solo tracks)

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4): took away one point solely because the music video thumbnail was just clickbait oop

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.043): i cant remember the last time i loved an album from a mainstream pop star as much as this one. almost every track on it is fantastic, and its clear how much effort lil nas put into this album’s lyrics and themes. if this is what lil nas x can accomplish on just his first album, i can’t wait to see how he’ll improve on his follow up

**akanewasright** (9.000): This album isn’t perfect and I’m probably being a little too kind to it, but… it honestly improves every time I listen to it. This is such a lovely debut album, with more substance than I expected, even after sun goes down was my favorite pre release single. In summation… Lil Nas please return my calls

**jsonphile** (8.964): I loved Old Town Road, both as a meme and as a song, but I didn’t really expect much more from Lil Nas X. Honestly I would have been happy if he just dropped remixes of OTR for eternity. But with this album Lil Nas X firmly plants himself as not just a funny horse guy but as one of the leading artists of a new generation. He’s surprisingly versatile on this album, using many different styles and genres, the songs are all bops, and he just puts so much passion into his music. Also he makes conservatives mad so that makes me happy

**Alumineous** (8.857): All right, Lil Nas. You made me a fan. I honestly enjoyed this album more than Doja’s and I was expecting to hate this album because, well, Lil Nas’s outward persona almost makes it impossible for me to believe he can make these songs. But he did. The first few singles made me believe this was gonna be a party record. I can’t believe I felt emotionally moved by this album almost to tears. We really do need more black gay narratives in music. I guess I won't throw Lil Nas under the bus now. I love this album.

**RandomHypnotica** (8.764): One of the most confident and exciting pop debuts in quite a long time, Montero feels incredibly complete and well-rounded, the themes of the album are well-explored and immediately clear, and Lil Nas X made sure he won't be remembered as a one hit wonder.

**AHSWeeknd** (8.643): he understood the assignment

**skargardin** (8.643): This is a really solid debut album, filled with bops.

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.571): When this album first dropped, I knew I had to listen immediately (which is what I didn't do for the others in the rate). This is proof that Lil Nas X isn't a one trick pony, with perhaps one of the best album stretches of the entire year with that's what I want all the way to dolla sign slime. A great album from start to finish and I'm glad to revisit it again. 9/10

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (8.571): their text to me - "ate tbh" (same text message as _Planet Her_)

**sufjancaesar** (8.536): It’s so sick seeing LNX explore his queerness openly. As a fellow black man, the community is unimaginably rife with queerphobia and LNX’s success is crazy important. Montero is packed with a ton of catchy hooks/jams, strong instrumentals and pure heart - it’s just nice to listen to lmao

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.286): we love the gays

**modulum83** (8.221): There's a lot of discourse about whether this album is "great." To me, the best comparison I can give is to something like Steven Universe or the Amazing World of Gumball - it's simple and cartoony, but it can still resonate meaningfully. Not everything has to be made for a super subtle and mature audience, and it can still be great art all the same.

**jaztinax** (8.036): genuinely so impressed how this album turned out. i don’t think anyone expected this from lil nas x after “old town road” - really, really hoping he keeps evolving and continues to make albums for years to come

**just\_thonking** (8.036): Not my favorite album in the rate, but the best debut album of any of the artists here

**TiltControls** (8.000): I can't believe funny cowboy meme man put out one of the best mainstream albums of the 2020s. Honestly though props to LNX for not only killing it on the music side, but also with fantastic promotion and aesthetics (especially the music videos. So many of them have been absolutely stellar)

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (7.929): gay rights

**vayyiqra** (7.857): Like Billie's album, I needed to listen to this more when it came out. Given I've gotten more into hiphop over the last year, I think now I like the pop-rap sound of it better, among the many other genres he draws from on it which makes it sound very fresh and creative. Also, I was surprised to see how raw and personal the lyrics are - he talks a lot about his mental health on this album and struggles I had no idea about. I really appreciate that side of this album as well. I've come to like Lil Nas X a lot more as a person and I hope this album does well in the rate.

**frogaranaman** (7.786): such an incredible artist statement of an album. it's hard to listen to this album and not know *exactly* what he is about

**MrMoodle** (7.714): This is weirdly the most commercial sounding album in this rate imo which is odd given his online persona is very much not that. Definitely feels dull at some spots but the production and melodies throughout are undeniably slick.

**jman457** (7.707): This surprised me, he really came into his own here

**wasian-invasion** (7.679): havent really come back to it since it came out but definitely was a more satisfying album than I was expecting. So refreshing to have a popstar be so unapologetically gay

**welcome2thejam** (7.571): Bit more bombast near the end would've given this album that last oomph it needed (Salem might've tried to be this, but just missed the mark). Overall though, a good listen that solidified Lil Nas X as a bonafide talent to watch

**iniekcja\_** (7.536): Listening to Lil Nas X is always so funny to me because I get flooded with memories of Stan Twitter. Before @nasmaraj there was @ShadyNMFacts and a similar account about Jhene Aiko that never really took off and it almost feels nostalgic to think back on all of the drama

**nooodisaster** (7.464): Yeah he did that

**hikkaru** (7.250): i LOVE the singles, i wish the bsides lived up to the hype but there's nothing truly bad here. we love that one of the biggest pop stars rn is a gay black man it's just so refreshing to root for him and see him succeed!

**Verboten\_Prince** (7.000): This man knows how to be a popstar. This album proves it, it has so much personality, positivity, introspection, and most importantly good music! People always talk about how “representation matters” but seriously… seeing an open and proud gay man become famous doing what he loves to do, it’s inspiring. Thanks Lil Nas X. And I’m saying thanks because I wouldn’t put it past him to be lurking around this rate lol

=====

ph2021ultimate: **babadork** (6.993): This album really exceeded my expectations when it came out. His lyrics and flow have improved a lot over the years. I think incorporating other genres really plays to his strengths.

**bigbigbee** (6.964): I think it’s really good. For this album, I often wish that Lil Nas X had gone slightly further with his production dynamics (?) - I think that a lot of his songs have great basics, but they leave me wanting MORE. Like, he’ll have.one beat that starts the song…and then throughout the whole song, nothing is added – it just stays at one level throughout the whole thing. That criticism aside, I think this album is very IMPORTANT for all the reasons I’m sure other people are talking about, and I think it’s a great start for such a promising pop star. It has a lot of sonic diversity, which is great (and made it easier to listen to, for me).

**ktajlili** (6.929): I was a bit worried when Rodeo and Holiday failed to live up to the hype he built during the OTR era. I followed Lil Nas X on Twitter and he seemed humble, cool, and, not to mention, hilarious. When you like someone, you hate to see them fail, and I liked him A LOT. But so far, I wasn't sure if he had the talent to maintain his success. (n) That's changed when he released CMBYN. Even after people forgot about him giving the devil a lap dance, the song remained on the radio. It was a genuinely good pop song, with a fun, confident chorus, and a great hook. His follow-up, INDUSTRY BABY,  which eventually hit number 1 as well, didn't disappoint either. And while I would not consider the album on par with its early singles, its still a solid body of work with cohesive storytelling and a strong commitment to LNX's personal narrative. Even though I have a hard time distinguishing the songs from one another at the end, MONTERO solidifies LNX as a versatile artist and shrewd hitmaker set for a steady career in the music industry.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (6.857): i just have a sneaky feeling most of the songs on here will be voted out first even tho it's actually HTE that deserves such treatment

**thedoctordances1940** (6.500): For the most part it's just fine, the best songs are the singles and not much else really stands out, but it's also rarely ever bad.

**shhhneak** (6.371): It’s cute but now I want something more than gay mematic chaos.

**slimboyfriend** (6.286): Surprisingly I liked this more than I thought I would going in! The first four songs are great, but unfortunately the rest of the album is pretty mixed and just drags on for the last two songs.

**qazz23** (6.143): it's okay, only liked a few tracks here

**fadedblue09** (6.107): A bit too frontloaded, and suffers from unremarkable production choices and the back half is rammed with filler. Nonetheless, his career trajectory is really inspiring and I’m surprised how vulnerable and personal his lyrics are. Other male pop stars, please take note!

**pig-serpent** (6.000): People rag on gimmicks, and this album proves why it's completely unjustified.  Previously his gimmicks have given his songs distinction from each other as well as clearly focused writing.  Lil Nas doesn't need a gimmick to have clarity as the good songs here prove, but without a gimmick many of his songs lack a thesis or sense of what they want to accomplish and as a result most of this album sounds like filler.

**CreepyMannequin** (5.964): Some great tracks (Industry Baby, Montero, etc.) but also a lot that don’t stand out.

**tickframe** (5.750): first time listening to this album and i did NOT like it :(

**IIIHenryIII** (5.714): It's not as bad as I thought it would be. I didn't have high expectations since I've never been a fan of his music. Old Town Road was really annoying and that Panini song is insufferable. The other two big hits from this album didn't do much either, but I can appreciate some aspects from each of them. That's it.

**Stryxen** (5.614): wow that was disappointing

**sillyrabbit289** (4.071): 6

AND WE HAVE OUR WINNER!!!

This isn't surprising at all, although for quite a while this was super close to "INDUSTRY BABY" (at one point being only 3 points ahead). I can't say I'm surprised it won in the end though, and I cannot be mad at it either. This album combines all the best elements of this album and throws it into one beautiful amazing cocktail. The screeching at the end feels so earned and the buildup is better than the one in "I Know The End," I said what I said. Just an overall pefectly earned winner.

#I DON'T TALK SHIT ABOUT YOU ON THE INTERNET

**1998tweety** (11): I mean come on now, my most played (and probably favorite) song of 2021. The short version doesn't do it justice

**agentofscranton** (11): winnie the pooh's soul leaving his body.gif

**AHSWeeknd** (11): People say “The second part 😍😍😍” but honestly, they wouldn’t like it as much if it was just the second part. The first part is what makes this song great.

**akanewasright** (11): Every second of this song’s runtime is earned and valuable. The beginning gets overlooked or skipped often because  you can’t headbang to it, but the lyrics are *so* cutting and wonderful… and then the ending is made up of two of the most jaw dropping minutes in popular music that I’ve ever heard.

**AzettImpa** (11): it's the soty of 2021. had a perfect trajectory from the LOVELY snippet in the documentary to the absolutely fucking mental shakeup in the album version. immaculate from start to finish

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (11): Flop this, flop that. Everybody shut up REAL quick when this dropped.

**bookthieving** (11): AND I DON'T TALK SHIT ABOUT YOU ON THE INTERNET!

**hikkaru** (11): as much as i love many other songs in this rate a lot, there's really just no other option. this song is a triumph like none other

**jackisboredtoday** (11): yeah I’m boring for picking this but I’m also right

**jaztinax** (11): you guys already know… it is the best song of 2021 for a reason

**jman457** (11): This was the song of the year for 2021, wow. It just an explosion of emotion in the best way

**joeeswift** (11): one of my GOAT songs, I’ll still be streaming in 60 years

**jsonphile** (11): absolutely fantastic. I still remember when I first listened to this album - it was Friday morning at work and I had read a few comments about this album, and people mentioned this song in particular. But nothing prepared me for that moment. That explosion of energy where Billie just lets out all the frustration and bitterness towards this dickhead, with scathing lyrics that Olivia Rodrigo could only dream about. One one hand, I want to hear this sound from her more, but on the other, I want this to be a rare event, something only reserved for the most powerful emotions that makes those moments even more impactful

**ktajlili** (11): will be shocked if this DOESN'T win tbh

**Lipe18090** (11): bitch please soty

**ManofOranges** (11): I fell out of love with Billie's music after she released her first album. There was a certain charm to the songs on her EP that just didn't quite show itself with the song's on When We All Fall Asleep Where Do We Go. I couldn't quite put my finger on what was missing, and to be honest, I still can't. Perhaps it's just the sound of the songs themselves, or maybe it's the lyrics, I'm not sure. But I can say for sure that there was always something that felt missing from Billie's newer songs that prevented me from really, truly loving any of the new stuff she had made. I felt that way going into this new album cycle when she released Therefore I am and then Lost Cause, and I was thoroughly whelmed, expecting this to very much be the same case as her previous album. And honestly... it has been. But this track... is something else. I think it's safe to say that I don't think Billie has ever put so much raw emotion into a song in a way such as this. It was completely unexpected when I first listened to this song, and perhaps it's that subversion of my expectations that makes me love this song so much. Maybe it's the utter catharsis that I get when listening to it. Maybe it's the kind of juxtaposition I get from listening to a song where Billie says she's 'happier than ever' and then ends it screaming 'just fucking leave me alone.' Maybe it's the slow build up all the way to the end. Maybe it's all of it put together. Whatever the case may be, I truly love this song. I see a lot of parallels between this song and 'I Know the End' by Phoebe Bridgers, which won its rate, and hopefully this song manages to do the same. It truly feels like something special in Billie's discography.

**martian\_pet** (11): song of the year 2021

**MassiveThief** (11): I wasn't originally as crazy about this song as everyone else but it just kept getting better and better. pls billie more of this

**nootnoot781** (11): literally fucking DUH. absolute career defining song and nothing short of a masterpiece.

**pheromenos** (11): good 4 her

**ricki** (11): couldn't we take this out so i would have to actually think about what to 11?

**shhhneak** (11): I mean, what more is there to say? I laughed, I cried, I sweat, I danced, I got shot, I ate, I screamed, I solved world hunger, I invoked world peace, I opened my legs, I checked the time, I became speechless, I became mentally stable, I raptured, I resurrected and I had many epiphanies.

**slimboyfriend** (11): she whispers no more

**static\_int\_husp** (11): I am genuinely a sucker for songs that start quiet and get all loud. Especially when they're this well written. It's why IKTE got my 11, this gets my 11, and Posing In Cars will likely get my 11 in the indie rate in a few months.

**TheQueenofVultures** (11): Feel like I've been coming back to this song and relating to it far more than I would like to recently. One of the best songs of 2021

**throwaway-7650** (11): so this is what it felt like giving IKTE an 11 in pitchfork

**TiltControls** (11): Billie's voice in the 2nd half is so good. I wish she did that style a little more

**tman8667** (11): The build of the first half is so soothing and the payoff in the second half is so well-executed, stellar song all the way around

**Uberpigeon** (11): the end is here

**waluigiest** (11): a perfect song. Just perfect! I don’t think I’ll ever be tired of it.

**xedophobic** (11): oxytocin is my favorite to listen to when i just want to play a song but the title track is too incredible not to bestow this score upon

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): JUST FUCKING LEAVE ME ALOOOOOOONE!!! BVVVVVV BVJHGVHGVHGV BHGVHG BHGVVVVVV

**babadork** (10): Once the guitars start to really come in on the second verse, I love this song.  The first chorus and verse is her best take on Julie London’s style.

**BasedButta** (10): HOLY SHIT! did I get baited by the acoustic ballad that I couldn’t stand at the start? yes. Would the song be better without it? i dont fucking know but i trust her. anyway this is incredible after that. Just amazing i dont think i have words rn mad props for not letting up with the instrumentals after they got going. gorgeous listening experience thank you

**celladonn** (10): JUST FUCKING LEAVE ME ALONE

**ebooks #5454** (10): instagram reels has pilled me to love this song and yknow what i do i genuinely do

**fadedblue09** (10): A track deserving of its acclaim IMO. Captures all of the album's themes and sounds and distills them effectively.

**fairytalehigh** (10): YOU MADE ME HATE THIS CITYYYYYYYYYYYYYY

**frogaranaman** (10): what can I say! it's good!

**ignitethephoenix** (10): truly one of her best songs, the “just fucking leave me alone” cleared my skin

**lost-ln-the-echo** (10): https://m.imgur.com/gallery/fdNZh

**mysario** (10): I need the radio to stop cutting down the first half of this song, it's like if "We Don't Talk About Bruno" started with Isabela's verse. Have fun with THAT outro!

**nooodisaster** (10): Song of the year!!!!!!! Motherfuckers if this does not get #1 I will riot.

**plastichaxan** (10): alright fuck it, i'll contribute to this winning i don't care, the buildup is incredible and the payoff too, it's like she learned how to do a nice switchup after some of these songs did not get it so yass

**pleasegivemeasword** (10): eleven contender

**poemforsmallthings** (10): are the last 2 minutes the best part of the song? absolutely BUT i wish everyone appreciated the rest of the song too i think it's quite lovely

**QuaxlyDuck** (10): I'm *so* glad the radio edit got released. I'm not really a fan of the first half (is it a ukelele?). But half two is one of the best music moments of 2021

**rabbi\_\_milligan** (10): YOU MAKE ME HATE. THIS. CITYYYYYYYY!

**seanderlust** (10): this might be my 11 not sure yet (edit: it wasn't but it was close). it is the obvious winner of this rate given that we *just* said it was our song of the year, but it's so cathartic. no other song in this rate makes me want to stop what i'm doing immediately to lip sync this in my kitchen

**skargardin** (10): JUST FUCKING LEAVE ME ALONE!!

**sweetnsoursauce11** (10): nothing to say about this song that hasn't be said. an absolute banger, extremely cathartic, her best song etc.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (10): if you listen to the edit version of this song that skips the intro…you deserve the electric chair

**the\_dc\_killjoy** (10): best mid-song switch of the decade

**TragicKingdom1** (10): a song so good it completely reversed the discourse surrounding this album on this sub

**UselessTacooo** (10): My reaction upon hearing this the first time was the same as everyone else: complete shock.

**wasian-invasion** (10): thank you soldier for your service by holding off good 4 u in the battle of popheads top songs of 2021

**welcome2thejam** (10): Everyone act surprised when this wins (and I mean, yeah I get it, I'm giving it a 10 for that second half too)

**you2009** (10): first half indeed sounds like looking into my locket which has a picture of my husband who is at war music. second half is the war

**thedoctordances1940** (9.9): the lyrics kinda stop this from being a 10 for me, as great as it is

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (9.5): this is not the best song on the album

**modulum83** (9.5): i don't think there's much else to be said about this song that hasn't been said already, but i'm happy for billie and i hope she's in a better place

**nlh1013** (9.5): would be a ten but for the ukulele

**bluexplus** (9): powerful!

**MrMoodle** (9): Pretty crazy this track has been out less than a year without massive success on the charts but can still nearly incite a Mr. Brightside-esque singalong on the back half. Weirdly I think its impact is slightly undercut by Male Fantasy, she closes out by saying “actually all that shit in the last song was fake lol psych here’s the real end”

**N454545** (9): YOU MADE ME HATE THIS CITYYYYYYYYYYY

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): The worst thing about this song is that I have to sit through 2 minutes of semi-boringness to get to the part that everyone cares about

**2dina3dworld** (8.5): the climax suffers because distortion doesn’t really lend itself well to big vocal finishes, especially when they’re meant to be sincere. Anyway, this also goes out to the fucker who acted as my best friend and confidant while lying about someone saying stuff about me that genuinely fucked me up. The climax feels like it could be about her specifically

**emmaelf** (8.5): look that second half slaps but it could do with chopping out part of the beginning i don't have the attention span for this.

**ReallyCreative** (8.5): it's slightly overrated but I won't talk shit about it on the internet

**sparklesandlight** (8.4): for creativity

**shipperondeck** (8.3): i don't connect to this song as strongly as it seems ppl here have, but i really like how love how long this song is and that she didn't split it into two (which wouldn't make sense but in the streaming age you never know, i say in the most boomer voice ever). anyway like most people, i hope we get more stuff like the back half of this song from billie. doesn't have to be a whole album but it'd be cool for her to explore this sound more. the very end of this song, like the last 15-20 seconds, is my favorite part

**apatel27** (8): Her voice holds the song back a bit.

**FroyoFox\_125** (8): Overrated but still great...in my humble opinion, of course

**majid** (8): stream night shift by lucy dacus

**musical\_pyn** (8): this song has shrunk on me a bit but GOD I love the lyrics in the second half and how they just go together so well

**oscarbrierley1** (8): would be an 11 contender if it didn't have the boring twee first half

**qazz23** (8): nice noise pop second half (second fav behind Oxytocin)

**tickframe** (8): oddly enough the first part is my favorite part of the song and i never tire of it, the "rock" part isnt clicking that much with me

**flavasavavandal** (7.5): One half is a 9, the other half is 7, put them together, take the average and you get a 7.5 because the distortion at the end of the second half is really rough

**iniekcja\_** (7.5): love the title mhm

**dropthehammer11** (7.3): good song, i dont LOVE it like most people but i can appreciate the structure of it and the eventual climax is a really dope moment

#NEVER TOLD ANYONE ANYTHING BAD

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (6.8): i begrudgingly admit the post-climax part of this song is nice

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (6): their text to me - "love the vibes"

**vayyiqra** (4): Feeling kind of bad because I know this song was cathartic for her but I'm not big on it after the rock part begins. It sounds like my headphones are blown out, and I hate when songs do that.

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4): giving this the average between a 1 for the first half (snooze) and a 7 for the second half (would give a much higher score if the audio wasn’t clipping like hell to the point where it’s irritating to listen to)

**CarlieScion** (2.5): not to be a hater but i really dont get why this is so loved on the sub. the first half is such a big nothing it kinda hurts

**AHSWeeknd** (9.938): The beige aesthetic did it for me

**Alumineous** (9.750): Never listened to Billie Eilish before except the Bond track and everything I wanted. This was a fantastic album, but I will admit that I have no intentions of listening to it again except for a few tracks. Her vocals, though! She can SANG, that's for sure. Never disrespecting her vocals again.

**RandomHypnotica** (9.606): Possibly my favourite album of 2021, Happier Than Ever feels like Billie showcasing her growth from her first release, and releasing an album full of a diverse range of sounds and styles and excellent lyricism and it feels like the highlight of the rate to me.

**akanewasright** (9.594): This was always one of my favorite albums of 2021, but doing the AOTY writeup for it just made me fall in love with *everything*. I really can’t give most of these songs lower than a 10 because I know and love them inside and out. There are like two lesser tracks imo, but even they’re at least solid, and everything else is just… wonderful. Billie is one of the best young artists we have in pop right and I’m eager to see what she does next.

**iniekcja\_** (8.938): wowww so this album is actually way better than I remembered??? Maybe it has to do with the headspace I was in back then and the one I'm currently in but I appreciate it way more both musically and lyrically now. The content is relatable but not overly simple, I'm just really surprised wow, also the transitions!!!!!

**skargardin** (8.875): What a great album and Lost Cause!

**jsonphile** (8.781): This album is fantastic. I don’t know why so many people were worried about a “sophomore slump” and it seems some people still didn’t like this?? I don’t get it. Billie proves she’s one of the best new artists with this album and I can’t wait to see what else she’ll do in the future. Even if this is her peak, she’s already left behind some amazing music

**b\_o\_g\_o\_** (8.781): she had Billie Eilish style, moving to Berlin for a little while

**waluigiest** (8.625): Turns out this album is really great when you don’t have someone whispering how much better her debut is in your ear!

**modulum83** (8.606): I wanted the Billie Eilish americana/trip-hop/jazz album. I got something even fucking wilder than what I could have imagined. This is one of the most sonically adventurous and wild albums I've ever heard in pop and it pulls from so many influences it should not work, yet it does. It's also unfathomably bleak and dark and haunting, yet meaningfully cathartic. Great stuff. I'm so excited to see where she goes next.

**jaztinax** (8.588): i was originally going to start this sentence by saying that billie eilish grew on me extremely fast until i remembered that my journey to becoming a fan was a really slow burn. i came around just in time to catch her releasing singles for what would be her debut album, and since that i feel like i haven’t gone a single day without listening to her music. so naturally, i was really excited for this album, but keeping the expectations at a minimum because there was too much unfair discourse about how she was going to flop and all that crap. i was happy to end up having a really pleasant experience diving into this album. is it as groundbreaking as her debut? definitely not. but it is a beautiful evolution that makes sense for her artistic journey. and i love that for her!

**just\_thonking** (8.500): A truly excellent album, a major step up from her debut, and a sign of great things to come.

**jman457** (8.419): Ok tbh I really was never into Billie, but the tidal track came up on a whim and it floored me. I listened to this album and it truly surprised me. She still feels hungry to push musical boundaries

**Own-Photograph-4642** (8.406): Exceeds the hype, good to great moments throughout (especially the oxytocin/golding combination) and the denouement/end credits of happier than ever and male fantasy is a nice touch. Solid album. 9/10

**MrMoodle** (8.269): Man I hope Billie gets to continue seeing huge commercial success. To some extent I think we’re deluding ourselves putting her up against these other albums - Happier Than Ever (the song) did well on streaming, but not as well as most of the singles of the other artists here, and the album tracks haven’t picked up nearly as much steam as they did on her debut. I think we all WANT Billie Eilish to be the hugely dominant popstar of this generation because she brings some artistic legitimacy to mainstream music. The pop scene probably needs a bit of credibility to rebound after the, uhh, interesting time that was early 2010s EDM party music (no disrespect though, Ne-Yo and Pitbull’s Give Me Everything is like, top 10 song for me lol). Her music has the ability to go to more unconventional places than her contemporaries while still retaining a mainstream audience, which might give her a pivotal position in deciding what pop music sounds like going forward. You’d have to be pretty delusional to say this album wasn’t successful, but I fear it might not be successful enough to secure her position as one of the defining artists of the next decade. I hope I’m wrong though.

**wasian-invasion** (8.188): not as cohesive as her debut but I definitely come back to it more. She didn't deserve all the weird backlash and this feels like such a mature album I'm so excited to see which of the many directions on this album she chooses next

**sufjancaesar** (8.156): Don’t know what I think of this album overall, it’s all over the place but somehow comes together if you look at Billie as an artist/person. I love a lot of these tracks, some are harder to digest - that said, Billie challenges what pop typically sounds like and I’m excited for her next steps tbh

**hikkaru** (8.156): i wasn't the biggest on wwafawdwg but hte has really solidified her as a great and defining artist, it's such a solid album all the way through
[/r/popheads/comments/tiquew/2021_ultimate_day_3_dddaytrip_took_it_to_10/i1gi8io/]

=====

ph2021ultimate: **fadedblue09** (7.938): A solid effort from an artist I had little interest before. Billie’s sophomore album expands her horizons, sonically and lyrically, to create an engaging and emotionally resonating effort.

**vayyiqra** (7.625): Being a fan of Billie since her first EP, I feel like I've slept on this album a lot. I only listened to it maybe once or twice after it came out and thought it was pretty and had good moments, but wasn't into the more subdued sound it has. Now after going back to it I see why it's so hyped - it's full of good songs and more mature lyrical themes. Good album and I won't be mad if she wins.

**shhhneak** (7.538): Night and day from her last era that we’re not even going to acknowledge.

**pig-serpent** (7.406): Almost every song on this album gets a lot better in context of the album, and I don't know if that's going to hurt its placement or helps it.  It's easily my favorite of the albums here.

**TiltControls** (7.406): I don't know if I love it exactly, but the highs on here are a lot stronger than WDWWSDF42JSO?

**OliviaGodrigo** (7.375): It’s kinda hard to make joke comments on this album when much of the content is so serious. It’s a great album that really elevated Billie’s artistry

**runaway3212** (7.344): this outsold all of her previous work so much

**slimboyfriend** (7.250): I was such a Wiliam Eyelash hater since she started on the scene and it took my being trapped in a car and having my boyfriend play me the title song to listen to this album and realize it’s REALLY good. I think it’s considerate of her to put the three worst songs (I think you all know the ones)  back-to-back in the middle of the album, but this album could have been GREAT if she just didn’t include them.

**IIIHenryIII** (7.156): Honestly, I don't think it's a bad or mediocre album, it just ain't for me.

**welcome2thejam** (7.125): Good first half, but shines in the second half, where I heavily enjoyed almost all the tracks. Billie's such a unique presence in music, and there's some great showcases of that

**jasannn** (7.069): While I think its a great sophomore effort and evolution of her sound, most of the album comes off as beige as the album cover. Her debut was just more exciting with more songs that I can still play on repeat. However, this album does have her magnum opus in the form of her title track.

**thedoctordances1940** (7.063): Yeah based on my scores it should not be a surprise that i only ever listen to the final 5 tracks, there's genuinely not much i care for before that but i absolutely adore the final stretch

**babadork** (6.938): I feel like my experience of this release was the opposite of a lot of people’s. Except for My Future, I wasn’t disappointed by any of the singles. When the album was released, I did not like it as much as I had expected to. Largely, I think the issue is that I don’t like Billie’s take on jazz. The genre is a great fit for her voice, but I don’t think her style of singing works.

**Verboten\_Prince** (6.938): I can’t lie… this is pretty boring. Definitely way more low-key songs on here than on her first album, and while each of them by themselves isn’t terrible, the sheer amount of them I think is a detriment to the overall quality of the album. But at least the album’s highs are REALLY high!

**bigbigbee** (6.906): I really like Billie, and I love that people love this more than When We All Fall Asleep! For me, though, nothing on this record comes close to being as special or exciting or unique as what WWAFA offered at its highest highs. That being said, it’s clearly an extremely GOOD album, just not as much to my particular tastes.

**frogaranaman** (6.813): this album works way better as a whole than individually

**nooodisaster** (6.781): I like this album more in concept and as a whole than song by song.

**CreepyMannequin** (6.688): There’s some high highs but a lot of tracks are pretty mid.

**frog's friend Daniel (they/them)** (6.531): their text to me - "Billie, cheer up? Idk gwurl"

**qazz23** (6.500): a few standouts but much too long and the middle of the album drags

**oscarbrierley1** (6.406): has some great moments but doesn't really click with me overall

**sillyrabbit289** (6.000): 8

**DevilsOfLoudun** (6.000): This album has good ideas but the execution doesn't work for me.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.406): i’ve never been a really big billie fan, and this album didnt really make me rethink any thoughts i already had on her. her shtick is old by now and i really do think she need to branch out in sound more, and maybe ditch her brother bc i’m pretty sure 90% of the reason her songs all sound so similar is because of finneas’s production style. but hey, at least we got the title track out of it

**THE\_PC\_DEMANDS\_BLOOD** (4.525): not for me

**xxpizzasrlifexx** (4.438): yeah so i really wanted to like this album because i loved WWAFAWDWG but it’s just a snooze-fest back to front with the exception of Therefore I Am… rip i hope most of these songs get voted out on day 1

throwaway-7650: there were other 11-worthy songs but none really had a chance against HTE for me. I really wish I could've 11'd deja vu or NDA but I won't complain about getting my first 11 win with this song. well-deserved!

fun fact: HTE is a great looping song for driving actually

TiltControls: Such a great rate!! Frog, Jules, and Hypno you did amazing! Those banners were fantastic! Wish I could've been around more the first 2 days but from what I saw it was fantastic.

[Leaderboard](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/wiki/index/rate-leaderboard) and [songlist](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A5h-JTTP_9oazhHjf8dXyPMsf3kVJjy1lU1ZjJd0_Vk/edit#gid=1275570508) updates are up! 

##**Songs**

Though maybe a little predictable, congratulations to **Happier Than Ever** for pulling off such a dominant win! It gets a leaderboard spot for **most 11s** sitting just behind Run Away With Me, Blinding Lights, and I Know The End. Overall it places 39th for song averages, wedged right between Jessie Ware's Spotlight and The Weeknd's Blinding Lights. All 3 of these tracks will be back for Winners III so we'll see how that holds up down the line.

Though it didn't pull off any records, **INDUSTRY BABY** managed to also crack the 9.000 score barrier. It places 218th across all songs. It's placed between Bruno Mars' Locked Out of Heaven and Dua Lipa's Levitating (from last years Ultimate actually!). It also ties in score with Lorde's Perfect Places.

Also as an aside - secret bonus rate stuff isn't counted by stats, but if it were Doja's **'But the trash man is the trash man'** would have the 2nd highest score of all time at 10.478! It'd only be beaten by Megan Thee Stallion & Beyonce's **Savage (Remix)** which is still sitting high at 10.792, which makes it the 2nd time that song has beaten Doja's score when it only slightly outscored Say So (Remix) in that secret bonus rate when she got a stunning 0.208 

##**Artists**

First off, some placement updates!

_

* 117th: f(x) (+0.001 point)
* **118th: Lil Nas X** (New)
* 119th: The Killers (-0.008 points)

_


* 133rd: Cyndi Lauper (+0.004 points)
* **134th: Billie Eilish** (previously 133rd)
* 134th: Harry Styles (tied)
* 136th: The Weeknd (-0.001 point)

_

* 186th: A$AP Rocky (+0.001 point)
* **187th: Olivia Rodrigo** (New)
* 188th: Rita Ora (-0.009 points)

_


* 217th: Panic! At The Disco (+0.003 points)
* **218th: Doja Cat** (previously 93rd)
* 219th: Louis Tomlinson (-0.002 points)

-

(also fun fact: Billie's average score actually stayed exactly the same. She only shifted cause LNX outplaced her)

**For leaderboard records**

* Nothing for the main artists, but Ariana gets another rate appearance which is enough to tie her with Nicki and Rihanna for 1st at 19. Now the only artist who's left behind at 18 is Taylor, though I guess you could argue she was here as well

Also there were a couple of odd records that came close to getting broken in the rate, but just missed!

**Longest streak between songs without one going out**

1. 30 songs - The Neighbourhood - I Love You - Afraid (35th) to Sweater Weather (4th)
2. 25 songs - Olivia Rodrigo - Traitor (41st) to drivers license (14th)
3. 21 songs - Dua Lipa - Future Nostalgia - Good in Bed (59th) to Fever (37th)

**Longest streak until 1st song goes out**

1. 20 songs - Dua Lipa - Dua Lipa - Garden (31/51)
2. 19 songs - Frank Ocean - Blonde - Pretty Sweet (41/60)
2. 19 songs - Lil Nas X - MONTERO - ONE OF ME (40/59)





##**Albums**
**Doja's Planet Her** becomes the 8th album in a 4 album rate to miss the top 10. She ties with Halsey - Hopeless Fountain Kingdom and Sly & The Family Stone - There's a Riot Goin' On for 6th worst placement aka the dreaded 11th place (though Doja outlasted more songs than both of them)

**Planet Her** also falls onto the lowest album averages leaderboard in 19th place between Revival and Femme Fatale

**SOUR** takes the record for having the highest 0 spread of songs on an album. The only track not to pick up one (or two in this case) was Jealousy, Jealousy. Previously the record was held by Lorde's Melodrama where only Perfect Places and Sober II (Melodrama) avoided 0s. **Planet Her** also makes it onto this list tied with Dangerous Woman [Rerate] for 9th with 66.7%. Naked, I Don't Do Drugs, Love To Dream, Been Like This and Options were the ones to avoid 0s.

##**Rates**
The 2021 Ultimate rate becomes the 5th most participated rate in the history of the sub! With 176 participants ~~or 175 sdfds~~ it's only out placed by the 2019 and 2020 Ultimate Rates, The K-Pop GG Smackdown, and the 2020 Sub Faves Rate!! Great job again to the hosts for working with such a massive rate!
