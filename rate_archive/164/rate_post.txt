The year was 2015, some blue haired girl was singing about getting high on marijuana, Hamilton had just premiered on Broadway and the anticipation could be felt everywhere from your local hot topic to 221B Baker Street. There was a bit of a resurgence going on for emo, for you see the girls who were too cool to be caught red-handed listening to silly boy bands like One Direction or pop artist like Justin Bieber, were making their own pop culture niches, Fueled ~~by ramen~~ by the return of titans **Panic! At the Disco** and **Fall Out Boy** and newcomers **Twenty One Pilots** and the perfect ecosystem of Tumblr users who found themselves wishing they were old enough for the good old days of 2004-2008 emo, a new trifecta rose out from the ashes of ‘the feels’; and that, is just what we’re going to get into this month

##Panic! At the Disco - Death of a Bachelor

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/6twKQ0EsUJHVlAr6XBylrj?si=PWTDlqsgRD2bfIKVn1JItw) 

> Lifetime of Laughter

> at the expense

> of the death of a Bachelor 

Coming off the success of their 2013 release, *Too Weird to Live too Rare to Die*Panic! Began dropping singles from the upcoming album as early as spring 2015. This was the first album to essentially (but not yet officially) have Brendon Urie as the sole member as panic as Bassist Dallon Weekes became a touring member. DOAB released on January 15, 2016 and would go onto debut at number 1 on the billboard 200 charts and be nominated for best rock album that year. While the album is ultimately rooted in the pop punk sound there's a bit more variety than you’d expect on it from the very jazzy influences of the title track or the more alt sounding tracks towards the end. 

DOAB was the last album from this album to drop almost a year after AB/AP and 6 months after Blurryface but it still managed to fit into this ‘era’ of ‘emo’ perfectly and I'm interested to see how it will do against these other powerhouses.

**Tracklist**

1. Victorious

1. Don't Threaten Me with a Good Time

1. Hallelujah

1. Emperor's New Clothes

1. Death of a Bachelor

1. Crazy=Genius

1. LA Devotee

1. Golden Days

1. The Good, the Bad and the Dirty

1. House of Memories

1. Impossible Year

##Fall Out Boy - American Beauty/American Psycho

[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/022DrG7Wp2PSCwzuD0bSzT?si=r7s9OtvzRAuursIu3T3xsA)

> I think I, I fell in love again, 

> or maybe I just took too much cough Medicine

> I'm the best worst thing that hasn't happened to you yet

Much like Panic! Fall Out Boy was also coming off the success of a 2013 album,  when all of a sudden in the dead of autumn 2014 ‘Centuries’ dropped. It was loud and Epic and it got everyone excited for what would come next. Thankfully for us they provided 2 months later when ‘Immortals’ the tie in track from the upcoming Disney movie ‘Big Hero 6’ would drop. Fob had their pulse right on what people wanted to hear from them and it was proving to be a success. When the album dropped it went number one on the billboard 200 

AB/AP was the first album of this ‘era’ and what a set off it was it was a huge success spawning 5 singles and even an entire remix album featuring complete reworkings of each song on the album collabing with multiple rappers. Fall out boy has always seemed to flounder in these types of rates here on popheads, will this be the one where they take the crown?

*Tracklist*

1. Irresistible

1. American Beauty/American Psycho

1. Centuries

1. The Kids Aren't Alright

1. Uma Thurman

1. Jet Pack Blues

1. Novocaine

1. Fourth of July

1. Favorite Record

1. Immortals

1. Twin Skeleton's (Hotel in NYC)

##Twenty One Pilots- Blurryface

[Well](https://www.aclusocal.org/en/news/better-ally-101)

Im kidding I do actually love this album and while I would’ve loved to write about it I got a little busy and so the lovely u/CrimsonRoset offered to helped me out and so here it is



[spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/3cQO7jp5S9qLBoIVtbkSM1?si=VvIlrxhNSUyBhq2pg-VxWQ) | [apple music](https://music.apple.com/us/album/blurryface/974485462) | [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mWtWynXa5NeLQEJjvrmVZmmO48G4eBBWg)

>I was told when I get older all my fears would shrink  
>  
>but now I’m insecure and I care what people think  
>  
>(My name’s Blurryface and I care what you think)

Watching the trajectory of twenty one pilots throughout the years has been nothing short of fascinating, and I believe this is the central point of any discussion resounding them. Blurryface was the album of 2015, their follow up to the breakthrough into the mainstream with three singles going to the top 10, a #1 album and an extremely dedicated fanbase. Browsing through all the records this thing has scored, you really see the scope of things: [first full-length album to have every track be certified gold](https://themusicnetwork.com/twenty-one-pilots-blurryface-history-gold/), the most streamed rock album of all time. This is not something that can be achieved by just any band.

Not that the members of twenty one pilots thought as such. While bombastic and explosive, while ruling the world with all these accolades- Blurryface is an album about deep-rooted anxiety and insecurity. Taking its name from the personification of the alter ego Tyler Joseph, the main vocalist of the band, [a character he made up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yx44NMDN0ws) as to represent his negative feelings and doubts, the lyricism of the album finds itself in exactly that: the negative. Questions of the worth of not only their artistry but themselves as individuals, of the religion they grew up with, of the meanings of fame and how to tackle love with it, as well as having people who look up to them when they consider themselves far from perfect. [Stressed Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXRviuL6vMY) talks about missing youth and the past, [The Judge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbP-aIe51Ek) tackles not seeing yourself as worthy in the eyes of God and the closer, [Goner](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3J5mE-J1WLk) is an outright plea of help over the fear of losing the battle to your anxieties.

*checks notes* the lore? Roxie isn’t paying me enough for this

This isn’t to say this album is the deepest ever, but this isn’t slam poetry, all these ideas and questions are backed by instruments (that’s what makes it music!). And while the mixture of described influences is… [interesting!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/882251808054063105/1047536153714233455/image.png) I think so much of the hodge podge of ideas works extremely well, and while the lyrical elements mainly come from Tyler, this is my time to talk about Josh Dun, the other part of the duo. He’s the resident drummer and, in many of these songs, absolutely unabashedly steals the show. [Polarize](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MiPBQJq49xk) and We Don’t Believe What’s on TV are good stand outs of showcasing how erratic it things can get in good contrast with the lyrics, but by far my favorite performance is in [Tear in my Heart](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nky4me4NP70) with the first most iconic seconds on the album, in my opinion. Not to say Tyler doesn’t shine through (he does the rest of the instrumentation, and isn’t half bad at it either) but I don’t think these songs would hit anywhere near as hard without the percussion.

As the newcomers to the Emo rate pantheon and… [underwhelming](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/ruhak2/comment/hqzcfor/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [results](https://www.reddit.com/r/popheads/comments/fi6rve/comment/fkfmfrh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) in popheads rates before, will they come out on tøp when put against two veterans? Or will popheads enjoy watching their ride back to the bottom of the artist leaderboard?

##Bonus Rate

Yeah there's no bonus rate. While a lot of these artists have loose material, none of them have enough that fit in the timeline of the rate (mostly fall out boy) so instead of doing a 3 song bonus I opted to include the **Twenty One Pilots** and **Panic! At the Disco** tracks from suicide squad in the main rate instead. These songs are **not** optional and you **can** give them your **11 (lol) or 0**

However, stick around after submitting your ballot, there may be a surprise that comes later.

#The Rules

First time doing a rate? Don’t exactly know how this works? It’s okay Here are the rules

**Listen to each song and assign each a score between 1 and 10.** Decimals are fine so long as it is only 1 decimal place. Ex) 9.2 and 4.9 are good, 3.33 and 7.75 are not.

**You have to rate EVERY SONG in the MAIN RATE.** For the bonus rate feel free to rate as many or as little songs as you want.

Your **scores should NOT be considered confidential**, feel free to share them, campaign for your favorite song to win. Go crazy ahhh

You may **give ONE (1) song a 0 and ONE (1) song an 11**. Please reserve these for your least favorite and most favorite tracks.**You must leave a comment for these!!**

You can **change your scores at any time!** Feel free to PM me  afterwards.

**Don’t Sabotage.** You’re entitled to your own opinion on these albums but if you’re giving one significantly lower scores without any commentary justification then we’re gonna have to talk. Basically don't purposely sabotage the albums. You don't have to like any or all of the albums to do the rate but don't just submit for the purpose of tanking everything and then not bothering to leave any explanation, it's never fun to see

Make sure you use the prepared link that can be found here in order to make sure that your scores are formatted correctly.

Speaking of formatting, **this is the correct way of formatting your comments**

> Crazy = Genius: 7 that's not correct math

This is the **only** way your comments should be formatted, any other way is incorrect and will crash the system
