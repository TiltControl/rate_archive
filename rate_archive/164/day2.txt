#People Who Like the ukelele 

**Awkward\_King** (10): vance joy if he wasnt given enough attention as a kid

**IIIHenryIII** (10): who said the ukulele ain't cool?

**ImADudeDuh** (10): Qanøn

**steelstepladder** (10): YEAH YEAH YEAH best two seconds of the rate

**mysario** (9.5): the answer to the question nobody asked "what if TOP covered a local folk punk band?"

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): Only thing that brings this down is that it has the same chords as Riptide.

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Me when I see 10 different shows about Bigfoot on the History Channel.

**CarlieScion** (9): im pro-ukulele happy songs. Singular minus point for the cringe hair/mind-lyric

**intheaftermath** (9): once again, the impact this had on sad ukulele girls with original characters

**plastichaxan** (8.5): I do believe it it’s fun

**CrimsonROSET** (8): tyler please do not sell your wife’s hair

**isthesweetestcon** (8): probably the best/most interesting song on this album so far

**king bestie** (8): tyler joseph thrived as a little ukulele boy

**MassiveThief** (8): This is cute but the ukelele girls that came out of the woodwork... nightmares.

**nick1372** (8): sweet

**pig-serpent** (8): This song makes me wonder why TOP haven't surprise dropped a folk punk ep yet.

**velvet-gloves** (8): i like the dynamics of it

**welcome2thejam** (8): What the folk?

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): YouTube vlog music but make it go HARD

**BreadlessCrust** (7.2): best on the album along w/ NT

**emoforever1927** (7): this is just a cute little song to me but has an interesting message to go along with it!

**frogaranaman** (7): what’s up w his beef on traditional media outlets

**lordofthpotat0** (7): tøp invented fake news

**nt96** (7): wow this is so 2016, I woke up the next day with a craft beer in my hand and clothes that look like I came from the Civil War or something

#People who dont

**Stryxen** (7): PUT. THE UKULELE. DOWN.

**xxipil0ts** (7): : okay but did any of you know that ppl shipped josh and tyler and then dubbed this as their theme song?

**cremeebrulee** (6.8): put the ukulele DOWN

**impla77** (6.7): where can i buy this hair

**-y-y-y-** (6.5): , a little bit clichéd at this point after a whole album of "fuck the establishment, fuck the media"

**1998tweety** (6.5): shes cute

**followingfreeways** (6.5): the more i listen to this god forsaken album the more i understand why they were popular in high school.

**jackisboredtoday** (6.2): I wanted to like this for so long but I’m sorry its mediocre at best

**akanewasright** (6): I kinda love the uke + drums + sometimes trumpet combo, but JESUS these lyrics are ass

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): There are a lot of interesting sounds, melodies, and lyrics here, but they’re mashed together in such a confusing way… like I think maybe they’re trying to be satirical or something but I can’t quite tell? Confusing.

**modulum83** (6): this is a song that is constantly threatening to become a neutral milk hotel song

**runaway3212** (6): what's with the riptide sound

**TiltControls** (6): cause as they'll tell you numerous other times in this album it's all about the radio baby

**criestotheclicking** (5.9): this is a bit cheesy, but overall, a good time. Why the bass sounds like that, I don’t know.

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.8): i bet these lads' parents have fox news brain and that's why they wrote this painfully band kid "front bottoms" song. my mom has msnbc brain which is a different thing entirely

**RandomHypnotica** (5.6): she doesn’t have legs like beyonce *or* eyes like rihanna

**dreamingpastel** (5.5): Something about this song is so early 2010s Tumblr.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): this could be a eurovision song


**seanderlust** (5): HELLO WHY ARE YOU SELLING MY HAIR DFJKLSAASF

**Uberpigeon** (5): what if the world was made of pudding

**daythreeinmiami** (4): I still can’t forgive Tyler for the lyric ‘we’ll make money selling your hair’ like you can do better then that.

**Verboten\_Prince** (4): Omg what's going on with them did they run out of hooks??

**whatsanillinois** (4): they are trying so hard to write a front bottoms song here it's crazy

**bogo** (3): and sometimes that ukulele music really doesn't hit

**dream\_fighter2018** (3): quirked up, actually a terrible person if you watch the franchise, tumblr famous white boy type beat

**heysoupie** (2.6): again with the riptide uke + cursive accent. I honestly thought this whole album would sound like this gross mashup of like rap rock + stomp n holler.

**moonagenightmares** (2.5): i thought this was gonna be riptide

**throwaway-7650** (2.5): sounds like something lach would like [2]

**apatel27** (2): The ukelele pandemic of the 10s really got everywhere

**Hulnia** (2): we need to ban ukuleles from music [2]

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): i forgot what this sounded like as soon as it ended

**hikk** (1): the vamps core (ukelele, has "tv" in the title)

**whoisValensi** (0): Oh the rolling of my eyes every time I have ever heard this song in my entire life. Just admit you wanted to make "You Get What You Give" x "Honey, We Can't Afford To Look This Cheap" but you don't have the charm of either fucking song. Oh wait it's supposed to be a love song? Guess it can't make up its mind. Also just... I can't with the fucking ukulele man. I fucking can't. This is the kinda song that screams "I am in love with Thomas Sanders vines" as a person as a SONG, if that sentence makes any fucking sentence. You told Tyler you liked his shoelaces and he told you that he stole him from the president. That's what he just did. But it's not even like endearing. Or at least to me it isn't. So here I sit, cursing out the government of TOPlandia for not using my listening time to entertain me properly.

#Everyone Shut Up This is my Favorite Comment in The Rate
**musical\_pyn** (5): A few months after this album came out I went to church camp (stream vbs by lucy dacus) and became friends with a guy there who loved this album and knew a bunch of top songs on ukelele (we love the mid2010s); anyways I'm just realizing that I absolutely had a crush on him because of the ungodly amount of time I (a guy) spent helping him learn this song for his girlfriend back home oops

#Grandy Jurry 

**frogaranaman** (11): at least he knows he’s going to hell ❤️

**IIIHenryIII** (11): I'm a sucker for transitions, what can I do?

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): You know how you know a song is great? When you don’t notice that it’s five minutes long.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): UKELELE RIGHTS!!

**daythreeinmiami** (10): This song is what inspired me to learn to play the ukulele lol. (JOSH DUN)

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): this is actually very good, really. Message Man is the pop reggae on this album that you should be going after

**ImADudeDuh** (10): no because in this song he’s saying that he’s the one on trial and its up to us as the listener to decide if he

**steelstepladder** (10): I'm at the point where I'm feeling bad about how one sided my scores are

**emayzee** (9.3): ever since i realized that the way tyler sings "you're the judge" sounds like "buttigieg" i can never unhear it

**-y-y-y-** (9): , great little uke ballad intermission, very refreshing and fun

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): average defendant testimony in Ace Attorney

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): He’s talking about the raters.

**1998tweety** (8): im hearing something

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): for a second there I thought “Riptide” was gonna start playing… this is good I just wish there was less rapping and the bridge was different

**runaway3212** (8): when it slows down ughhh I die

**starlitsuns** (8): is the courthouse in an elevator because it sounds like purgatory is in an elevator

**velvet-gloves** (8): charming

**isthesweetestcon** (7.5): i like the ukulele and overall vibe of the song

**nt96** (7.5): Only Judy can judge

**Bandito21Dema** (7): I like ukulele

**bogo** (7): sometimes that ukulele music hits idk

**cremeebrulee** (7): oh i’ve heard this one before

**intheaftermath** (7): it's quite good! but it makes me think of Migraine which is MUCH better

**Puppy\_Basket** (7): nice bop

**TiltControls** (7): I'm usually a bigger fan of the TOP ukelele songs, but this is just fine? needs more uke I think

**criestotheclicking** (6.8): so this feels the closest to their previous works, particularly self-titled. Crazy how piano has kind of been phased out of their works when the piano is one of the best parts of self-titled.

#Theater Kids

**akanewasright** (6.5): set me fr- https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/original/000/026/008/Screen_Shot_2018-04-25_at_12.24.22_PM.png

**nick1372** (6.5): https://www.pinterest.com/pin/354869645619629256/

**BreadlessCrust** (6.2): vibey asf

**Uberpigeon** (6): im just impressed he can hit that note that whiney white boy voice is doing wonders this time

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): They did something with this song, I'm just not sure what

**welcome2thejam** (6): Hot Topic Jason Mraz

**seanderlust** (5.5): no sorry house of gold >>>> this unreleased steven universe track

**jackisboredtoday** (5.2): this starts and ends mostly fine (if not at all as good as House of Gold when it comes to their softer ukulele stuff) but that chorus is really weak and then we get tyler’s rapping again, over a beat he just does not sound good o

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.2): riptide-ass ditty alert that goes into goober-core and sounds like a pep talk the whole time. mid!

**ignitethephoenix** (5): some lovely vlog background music for a 2012 lgbtq YouTuber

**pig-serpent** (5): Fun hook to sing along to, but the instrumental bores me.

**throwaway-7650** (5): what in the bikini bottom (not ice spice unfort. stream though!)

**whatsanillinois** (5): 🚨🚨BAND KID ASS SONG ALERT 🚨🚨

**dreamingpastel** (4): This is fine.

**heysoupie** (3.8): not the riptide uke, not the jason mraz vocables, not the cursive singing, not the early 10’s jaunty youtube background music piano in the chorus !! this is a hard pass for me, y’all.

**Awkward\_King** (3.5): is vance joy related to anya taylor joy

**RandomHypnotica** (3.5): who let him access a ukelele

**apatel27** (3): oh no a ukelele 😰

**CarlieScion** (3): sometimes im reminded they’re a christian rap duo and here it really fucking shows lmao

**jay** (3): neptune

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): a skip lbr

**mysario** (3): the song is longer than "Holding On To You" which is the threshold for how long a TOP song can go

**Stryxen** (3): i will never know terror like the first 10 seconds of this song when i think they’re about to cover riptide

**hikk** (2): i hate yooka-laylee

**impla77** (2): not the adam levine impression on the set me freeeeee

**whoisValensi** (2): This is just Kickstarter ad music for an instrumental. This song has never done anything for me and it never will because look... there's a laundry list of shit. But at least I can take like 2.5 seconds to laugh at the fact the ukulele in the back sounds like Kickstarter ad music.

**Hulnia** (1): we need to ban ukuleles from music

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (0): i went into this rate fully expecting to give my 0 to tear in my heart without a second thought but then i heard the ukelele on this and i lost it

This album is kinda insanely ordered because the entire run at the front were really just pre singles. I get this one confused with dont threaten me with a good time all the time to the point where i dont have anything to say because I was gonna make a joke about rock lobster here and then realized thats the wrong song.


---



**dream\_fighter2018** (10): up until 16, I would claim that this song was my favourite song to ever exist. It’s still a fine song, even makes Brendon Urie seem slightly charismatic with the “you know royals never die” line

**hikk** (10): joker amv core

**IIIHenryIII** (10): human flesh feels good, but does it taste good?

**moonagenightmares** (10): the mv is camp idc

**mysario** (10): lowkey probably the best song on the album and no one can convince me otherwise

**pig-serpent** (10): I'm all dressed up and nakey.  I see what's mine and takey.

**plastichaxan** (10): This reminds me of a Fall Out Boy song (good)

**runaway3212** (10): This is such a slay like why lie

**Stryxen** (10): best song ever, even i was gagging

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): my favorite Disney movie! at the Disco

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): You know when people say something makes them "go feral"? That's this song to me

**Awkward\_King** (9): honestly i feel like if you trace back my love of horror as a genre it might be to this video...

**emoforever1927** (9): such an attractive song for me!

**ignitethephoenix** (9): this is the only song I heard from this album previously but it bops

**celladonn** (8.5): I kind of have to be in the right mood for this but when it hits it hits

**seanderlust** (8.5): me when brendon urie interpolates notorious b.i.g: https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EbavkbrXQAAlsVN.jpg

**whoisValensi** (8.5): Everyone who mentions how "hot" Breadbin is in this video gets sent to Horny Jail. That's the rules.

**Bandito21Dema** (8): yay demon Brendon

**lordofthpotat0** (8): I thought this was a Disney movie

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): FINDERS KEEPERS LOSERS WEEPERS!

**Puppy\_Basket** (8): love Kuzco

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): making a song about how you're the villain and coming to rule the world after a VERY notorious break up within the band leaving you as the sole remaining member is so on the nose its not even funny, like cartoon villain level shenanigans

**throwaway-7650** (8): this was a 9 until he started sounding bad

**welcome2thejam** (8): Ever since the rate cycle trailer came out, the image of devil Brendon Urie has burned itself deep into my brain. I had to watch the video over and over just so the ghastly images in my mind can be satiated for just a little while longer. What I'm trying to say is that I might have Stockholm Syndrome'd myself into liking this

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (7.9): villain song >:)

**LilacDaffodils** (7.8): the premier of this mv changed me permanently. Middle school me thought Brendon was some sort of sex gd.

**bigbigbee** (7.5): the youtube thumbnail for this HAUNTED my feed in 2015, he would not go tf away

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (7.5): A moment in YouTube thumbnail history.

**king bestie** (7.5): demon brendon urie was just foreshadowing the creature he’d become but this song still goes

**nick1372** (7.5): I wish Panic! would make more songs that were just nonsense

**velvet-gloves** (7.5): , "the finders keepers losers weepers" bit is grating but Brendon sounds great on the rest

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): Bro how can you be dressed up and naked at the same time I don’t get it.

**CrimsonROSET** (7): i had a comment about what i actually didnt like in this song but then i remembered that this is top1 worst videos in the rate

**intheaftermath** (7): this video scared me when i was like 12

**TiltControls** (7): Much like the folk tale, I have to imagine the same level of delusion is what caused Brendon to think Bohemian Rhapsody was a good idea

**untitledmanuscript** (7): an odd music video follow up choice for this is gospel

**RandomHypnotica** (6.9): this is so QUIRKY and GOOFY lmao haha

**isthesweetestcon** (6.5): this song gets old quickly and i still don’t really feel it compared to older panic but remembering the first time i heard it… it has something, at least

**modulum83** (6.5): tumblr fandom AMV fodder (derogatory)

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (6.3): He's so loud, but this one is catchy.

**1998tweety** (6): idk something here sounds a bit off

**CarlieScion** (6): the video for this is so bad skndnfjskf

**criestotheclicking** (6): I have a soft spot for this song. I like the arrangement but the chorus is just so screamy. Also I have no idea what that sample at the beginning of the song is supposed to say??? Also this is what taught me what a sycophant is so thanks for expanding my vocab Mr Urie

**starlitsuns** (6): time to embarrass myself: this is a distinct part of my Kylo Ren stan phase, it gets docked 3 points for that

**dreamingpastel** (5.5): Why wasn't the choir from 1:45 to 1:55 used more?

**heysoupie** (5.3): the sample makes me uncomfy, as does the weird rap rock

**daythreeinmiami** (5): Again, he sounds like a dollar store Alex Turner in the verses. Outside of the verses it’s eh. It does sound like he listened to a Fall Out Boy album followed by an Arctic Monkeys album and mushed them together for this album though.

**emayzee** (5): this grating ass chorus

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): He was truly WILD for these videos, what kind of money did he think the Deviantart crowd had? Once again, I like the verses and the bridge but the chorus just feels like he’s screaming at me.

**nt96** (5): them incessant high notes omfg I wanna die

**-y-y-y-** (4.5): , the music video was the only really fun part of this song and now it just kinda grates on my ears

**cremeebrulee** (4.5): having a very visceral reaction to the idea of brendon urie naked i'm sorry

**akanewasright** (4): This is just exhausting to me… I can’t fault it too much bc I think that’s the appeal, but it’s wayyyy too much for me

**frogaranaman** (4): this album is so interesting to me, there's like some really hard bangers on here and then there's stuff like this where I'm like "did he have a tracklist requirement or"

**Hulnia** (4): the video is the only thing even remotely interesting about this song

**ImADudeDuh** (4): this was Citizen Kane for tumblr gif makers

**ktajlili** (4): ugh pitch correction

**Uberpigeon** (4): girl what are u even talking about.

**apatel27** (3.5): Theatre Kid energy (derogatory)

**jay** (3): love a glitter fairy sparkling sound effect but that was kinda the only thing abt this song i liked

**bogo** (2.5): emperor's new groove outsold

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (2.5): creed did not walk and take me higher so brandon urie could go to hell and add fucking sound effects to his lame ass music videos.

**impla77** (2): I’m sorry Hans Christen Andersen

**flava** (1): worst chorus in the rate

**steelstepladder** (1): You can't sound cool saying finders keepers, losers weepers especially not in that tone of voice

**whatsanillinois** (1): https://i.imgur.com/EptSl5y.png

**musical\_pyn** (0): war crime

**ScrtSuperhero** (0): - An album of extremes, this is truly pop punk's Lover. Inane lyrics and the most annoying vocal effects throughout the chorus.

another 11 contender, Reminds me of being on the plane leaving new york for the first time and the view of the half melted snow covering the city and how it was the first time I'd ever seen anything like that. I remember it was very cloudy outside and overcast and grey but breaking through the clouds, the sky was this breautiful shade of blue and It was just a really nice moment. I love this song so much and im glad a few of you liked it just as much as me!

#The only valid indiehead ballot

**modulum83** (11): the song that plays on the radio as you’re sitting in the backseat of your parents’ car driving to the beach after your last day of middle school. fall out boy goes full “disco”, french electro, crunchy dance music and sticks the landing. there’s a sense of naive and euphoric celebration but also a strange feeling of endings in the back of your head that you don’t quite understand until years later. “favorite record” is a song about songs, about the impermanence of them, about the glow they inexplicably still retain. radio music *is* memory, dedication, and i can’t think of a better dedication to this era of “emo” than this one. these albums are all just party anthems in the end. this is the ultimate one.

#!wka 

**runaway3212** (10): my favourite record is Liz Phair - Exile In Guyville which is why im voting for the 90s Women Who Rock Rate!

**TiltControls** (9): I'm TiltControls and this is my favourite record in the 3mo rate

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): How fitting that this is my favorite on the album!

**frogaranaman** (7): put me in the section of everyone commenting their favorite album

#Last Fm Users

**CarlieScion** (10): the fade out/in to immortals is Excellent

**nick1372** (10): getting violent flashbacks to listening to this song and thinking about my high school crush

**-y-y-y-** (9.2): , man the back half of this album doesn't miss, what a catchy tune

**cremeebrulee** (9): never paid attention to this one too much but now that i am listening to it, it feels like a continuation of the kids are alright? might need to spin (🥁) this more often

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): yeah this is corny as hell but i really love it i dont know why, it just gives me really nice summer vibes, when i close my eyes i just picture myself laying on the roof of a car on the edge of hill and sunbathing with my best friend next to me laughing and talking about our future like a scene out of a coming of age flick with this song playing in the background


**thisusernameisntlong** (8): cant believe im giving this the same score I gave to Put Your Records On

**throwaway-7650** (8): me when it's opposite day and I'm talking about (former) record-setting rate winners twice

**jackisboredtoday** (7.8): this was probably my least played song on the album (save for the title track) when it was new, but its grown a lot on me since then. It feels like the most “pop” song on the album without even a real hint of pop-rock to it, which is probably a big part of why I felt that way, but it’s cute. Anyway I’m imagining the Danzig album they mention is the Elvis covers one that got a Not Good.
**dreamingpastel** (7.5): Song that sounds like it plays during some cute montage in a teen romcom (affectionate)

**whoisValensi** (7.5): This is my least favorite on the record but even then, it's still good and I wouldn't like, skip over it instantly. Maybe I'm some sorta freak but TBH this is my favorite FOB album, but also I'm a 'M A  N   I    A' defender so don't take what I say too seriously okay.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (7): The verses have so much potential, but the chorus kinda falls flat.
**king bestie** (7): i love the duo of corny metaphors this makes with fourth of july they a power couple fr

**RandomHypnotica** (7): not any of the songs in this rate

**steelstepladder** (7): A fine use of Millenial Whoop

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): I like this song but also if you told me they only wrote this to have an epic transition into Immortals I would believe you

**welcome2thejam** (7): This feels like a song from that 1D/5SOS/Vamps rate, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. Just makes it a wild pick to drop the Danzig reference in lol

**emayzee** (6.8): the "ohh ohh"s on this album are so aggressively early-mid 2010s

# Broken Records

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (6.5): I mean it’s cute. But what is cute next to…butt ass ugly?

**velvet-gloves** (6.5): the best part is the outro transitioning to Immortals

**heysoupie** (6.4): finally, a respite from the energy being at 11. It gives maroon 5 a bit, although in a good way?

**impla77** (6.3): Is her record player broken? Why can’t she spin her favourite records anymore :(

**1998tweety** (6): snooze a bit

**CrimsonROSET** (6): why does the chorus have zero bombast what in the cold shower is this bring that post chorus to the acual chorus please

**IIIHenryIII** (6): Vessel

**criestotheclicking** (5.8): this is somehow giving 80s pop rock. I will bump up the score a little more because it blends well into the next track

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.1): a real post-modern anonymous cut

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I guess they discovered what vocoders are on this album as well as distortion. The use of it sounds like what a 12 year old would do.

**ignitethephoenix** (5): kind of lazy

**ktajlili** (5): I like parts of this, but I just wish it went somewhere. It kind of falls flat.

**nt96** (5): not this

**intheaftermath** (4): there's just nothing exciting here

**jay** (4): their prechoruses are practically whole verses like omfg drop the beat limp wrist

**mysario** (4): this is side two, flip me over, I know this song is Favorite Record, the songs you grow to like never stick at first, so I'm writing you a chorus and here is your 4

**whatsanillinois** (4): hate that vocoder section

**MoonlightByWindow** (2): the most filler song on the album for sure

**bogo** (1): i'm getting real tired of this watered down corporate rock garbage

I remember the first time I heard rock lobster, about a year before we rated in the NWG, the intro started and I yelled panic???? and the person i was checking it out with was so confused. I remember when this single dropped it was the 4th or 5th one and I was kinda wondering when or if the album was gonna come because it had been almost a year since the lead. This is often is the song I think of the most when i think about this album and while its not my favorite, its a hell of a feeling though

#Postitive Comments about the sample 

**moonagenightmares** (10): i cant believe i only just realized this samples rock lobster no wonder i love it sm

**ImADudeDuh** (10): the b-52s you will always be famous

**timothy444** (7.5): I love use of the Rock Lobster sample, the chorus, and that drunk line but everything else is really forgettable.

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): I have gone from hearing this and going "wtf is Rock Lobster doing here" to hearing Rock Lobster and thinking "wtf is DTMWAGT doing here". Wait... I mean, nahhh, I don't listen to Rock Lobster lmao where would you get that idea *sweats*

**nt96** (8): Champagne, Cocaine, Gasoline, Rock fracking Lobster? These are a few of my favorite things???

**starlitsuns** (8): the second time in two months that we will be rating Rock Lobster, also give that your 10 in All Stars 6. this would be a 10 because of how campy this is if I could ethically give Brendon a 10.
#Happy Hour enthusist 

**whoisValensi** (8): So you had me at "Rock Lobster". Also I just wanna say I'm so glad we're at a point now where the fucking chiffon skirt/high heels line and uhhh idk Brendon's "quirk" over that line during concerts is thank fucking god a thing of the past (Or at least I really fucking hope so cause it's 2023 dude...) because now guess what we got actual emo front men showing the fuck up in skirts and dresses and basically what I'm saying is CHEERARD THE THINGS YOU DID FOR SOCIETY TO REDEEM US FROM THE CRATERS THAT BREADBIN THREW US INTO. THE KINKY BOOTS COULD NOT SAVE HIM THEY COULD NOT.

**ignitethephoenix** (7.5): glad someone did decide to sample rock lobster since it came out
#Postive comments

**Awkward\_King** (10): i miss being 13 and watching the "but i make these high heels work" concert compilations on my phone in bed at 11pm with no concept of what the word problematic means

**CrimsonROSET** (10): brendon urie really wants people to think he’s cool enough to do cocaine

**emoforever1927** (10): great song - great lyrics

**IIIHenryIII** (10): emo is when drugs

**pig-serpent** (10): Who wants to play the Panic! drinking game with me?  Whenever he says the name of an ingestable substance, you ingest it!

**RandomHypnotica** (10): champagne cocaine and gasoline is such a wild combination of things like the first 2 are feasible at the same party, but who is out here getting high on gasoline at the same time

**throwaway-7650** (10): me preparing to tank all 3 albums (update: task completed half-successfully, tanked 1.5 albums)

**1998tweety** (9): i must admit this was kind of hot

**Bandito21Dema** (9): I know parts of this one in sign language
**CarlieScion** (9): I hate Brendon urie

**hikk** (9): anticipating the "but i make these high heels work" live performance compilation shitpost
**jay** (9): fierce why lie

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (8.5): It’s a little hard to explain but a lot of songs on this album are obnoxious but like it a pleasant way. Like yeah hurt my ears a little bit, Brendon.

**celladonn** (8.5): The Rock Lobster sample does some heavy lifting here but I also really like the bridge

**king bestie** (8.5): this song came out at a time i thought pack of camels was referring to the animal

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (8.3): catchy as hell

**jackisboredtoday** (8.3): I’m embarrassed because the lyrics should be so bad here, but this bops really hard, one of the best melodies on the whole album

**mysario** (8.1): we were at the beach, everyone had... matching towels!

**dream\_fighter2018** (8): my friends and I used to quote the “I’m not as think as you drunk I am” all the time, and giggle over how clever this lyric was. I miss being an easily-impressed fifteen year old

**lordofthpotat0** (8): none of that sounds like a good time

**MoonlightByWindow** (7.5): in year 9 me and my friend (but especially my friend) were obsessed with this album and one time when school had just ended and we were crossing the (very busy!) road right outside we were bellowing this song for no reason and a car almost hit her and i still remember her shocked face in the middle of singing the lyrics

**nick1372** (7.5): "champagne, cocaine, gasoline, and most things in between" is the most panic! lyric to ever exist

**Puppy\_Basket** (7.5): Rock lobster!


**velvet-gloves** (7.5): more fun to scream along than Victorious

**cremeebrulee** (7.3): y’all were begging to rate b52s for like a year straight, why are u mad we’re doing it again

**akanewasright** (7): there’s a dark reality where the casting director of kinky boots heard this song and cast him immediately

**bigbigbee** (7): that’s 2 champagne mentions in as many songs

**intheaftermath** (7): I've seen P!ATD live twice, once with each parent. My father was not a very big fan of this one.

**ktajlili** (7): Okay, this isn't the deepest song, or even the best song about getting drunk, but I find it charming. The lyrics are pure fun.

**rotating3Dtext** (7): rock lobster

**Stryxen** (7): this song makes me want to vomit (positive? somehow)

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (7): when brendon urie dies he will be banished into hell by ricky wilson's own two hands

**thisusernameisntlong** (7): my favorite interpolation in this album! at the Disco

**Uberpigeon** (7): the instrumentals are so good can i perform a surgical lead singer transplant

**Ghost-Quartet** (6.5): Why is this music video a porn parody of *Hardcore Henry*? Regrettably I do enjoy the dark cabaret vibe but the actual chorus is on the wrong side of grating.

**BreadlessCrust** (6.2): CHAMPAGNE COCAINE GASOLINE

**heysoupie** (6.1): Rock Lobster is such an iconic riff! but this song feels like an ad  for the Las Vegas tourism board or something

**daythreeinmiami** (6): The guitar at the beginning sounds like an Arctic Monkeys reject. This song isn’t too bad. I’d probably like it more if this was 2007.

**modulum83** (6): the drummer went absolutely dummy mode on this actually



#Pitchfork Audition tape

**poemforsmallthings** (6): "I'm not as think as you drunk I am" he's crazzzzzyyy he's quirky

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): Even as a teenager I thought this was dumb edgy cringe. "Champagne, cocaine, gasoline?" Oh no sweetie don't cut yourself on the edge

**welcome2thejam** (6): I sang along with Rock Lobster. I rated Rock Lobster. Rock Lobster was a ten of mine. You are no Rock Lobster.

**criestotheclicking** (5.5): this has a good melody etc. but the arrangement kills me. Why is it so overblown? I will say, it makes good use of the Rock Lobster sample. I’m not a fan of the pseudo-trap “hey!”s and handclaps. Also “I’m not as think as I drunk I am” does irreparable damage to me every time I hear it because of how much the fandom used to worship it.

**isthesweetestcon** (5.5): as a fan of panic! from a fever you can’t sweat out, i’m not a huge fan of the power ballad?? hype style they are going with but. as much as i’m not into the chorus the verses have a sliver of old panic. just a sliver but it’s there. or am i delusional?

**runaway3212** (5): the good time is actually hearing rock lobster instead of this

Roxieloxie: 
**ScrtSuperhero** (5): - entirely due to the B-52s, but still fun!

**-y-y-y-** (4.5): , fun update to the rock lobster riff but the lyrics are vapid and overly ✨quirky✨

**flava** (4): we have uma thurman at home energy

**impla77** (3.5): Where is the good time that is being threatened?

**apatel27** (3): How are you gonna ruin Rock Lobster like this

**steelstepladder** (3): Camilla Cabello voice: Champeen, cocaine, gasoline. Suddenly you're a fiend and you're all I need

**dreamingpastel** (2): The Rock Lobster sample is the only good part.

**frogaranaman** (2): absolutely. Not with that sample. Teen Beach Movie ass sample

**seanderlust** (1.5): de-yassified last friday night

**darj** (1): rock lobster INNOCENT!

**Hulnia** (1): the fact they were allowed to use that sample is homophobic

**TiltControls** (1): I already don't like Rock Lobster and this is Rock Lobster but somehow worse

**whatsanillinois** (1): Lietoc: he seems so unsexy and this lady is an octopus? is this hentai?

**bogo** (0): i hope the ghost of ricky wilson haunts brendon in his sleep for this

**plastichaxan** (0): The sacrilege to Rock Lobster on top of the worst video I’ve ever seen wow

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (0): irrational hate 0 rewarded for a contextual and visual nightmare across the board. the "woo-yeah!" theatre kid drama energy is already shite enough, but then to make it worse the gang decides "let's bastardize rock lobster" in one of the most unearned usages of a sample I've ever had the displeasure of hearing. do NOT take the b-52s, the kings and progenitors of Athens, GA queer party music, and sample it in any capacity if you're going to create something this unhinged that warps past sinister into indulgently hedonistic (lines like "im not as think as you drunk i am" are not emo just wasted); it doesn't create anything novel or unique. it's beyond creepy and such a colossal misfire. fuck off. hate this video dearly as well, which is beyond miserable and vapid. "is it hentai?" is not a question I'm ever trying to ask with this fucker but thanks man for only taking two songs to get here.

teen angst depression anthem.

This did way better than I was expecting it too, Im really shocked, Its one of my favorites that anytime I hear it takes me back to sitting outside durring lunch in 9th grade just absolutely going through it. Its very theater kid coded so I was expecting it to be cut day 1 but Im pleasently suprised.

#Plays the Piano 

**LilacDaffodils** (11): I cannot justify this pick it just is.

**Awkward\_King** (10): god i miss when i could think this was good and not feel guilty about it

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): This one’s a contradiction because of how ridiculous some of the lines are. But the meaning is so down.

**bogo** (10): lovely

**daythreeinmiami** (10): I was a depressed angsty 20-year-old in 2015 and I listened to this song all the time as not only did this song just perfectly captured how I felt at that time, but it would also cheer me up literally because of how happy it sounded. I will always treasure this song for that.

**emayzee** (10): a literal discography highlight that has been paid dust

**IIIHenryIII** (10): Tyler not being subtle is a mood

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): listen I know: this score is a contradiction because of how bad the lyrics are, but the song is so bop

**darj** (9.5): bop!

**king bestie** (9): this has so much ukulele energy for a song that doesn’t feature one

**nick1372** (9): An excellent summation of the album's themes and a real point of emotional catharsis. I wish the rest of the album was less shrouded in irony like this.

**TiltControls** (9): The fantastic build-up on the track hooks me in every time

**Ghost-Quartet** (8.5): This is wonky but I’m kinda into it? Like when it first started I was confused by the song structure but by the end I was fully living.

**ImADudeDuh** (8.5): satan, not today

**modulum83** (8.3): i can actually get into the Musical Theater Mindset for this one! it’s a miracle!

**-y-y-y-** (8): , great song for ass shaking, the bass line wined & dined me

**Bandito21Dema** (8): happy song, sad lyrics

**CrimsonROSET** (8): he heard hey ya once

**runaway3212** (8): yass

**BreadlessCrust** (7.2): i actually love this song

**1998tweety** (7): she bops a bit

**frogaranaman** (7): me when I'm trying to preserve my mental health and skipping this song on shuffle

**Stryxen** (7): i like this a lot im afraid. Too afraid to score it any higher tho

**emoforever1927** (6): Just a really interesting song apart from what you think their music is usually - not lyrically but sound-wise

#Out of my mind

**pig-serpent** (6): I can't help but feel like this song is at least partially responsible for AJR.

**RandomHypnotica** (6): “you are out of my mind” - person who wrote entire song about you

**Verboten\_Prince** (6): I'm so exhausted of hearing this dude sing about his own lyrics

**criestotheclicking** (5.4): song from the perspective of (someone with) anxiety? Idk kind of boring, for all I used to listen to this album, it has never left much of an impact on me.

**heysoupie** (5): v middle of the road

**welcome2thejam** (5): Perfectly adequate, but no seasoning

**akanewasright** (4): This is honestly a nice instrumental, I just wanna slap Tyler at this point

**jay** (4): lord

**lordofthpotat0** (4): the actual contradiction is how bad this song sounds

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (4): idk it’s boring

**impla77** (3): From the Swift school of being unbothered

**whoisValensi** (3): Tyler said here's one for the Theatre Kids and I started to doze off. But also I'm writing this comment at 6:01am and I'm so fucking tired soooooo.

**CarlieScion** (2): GOD I hate the post-ironic thing of pointing out the rhetorical / instrumental devices you’re using in the text itself. FUCK OFF we get it without u having to point it out

**dream\_fighter2018** (2): the piano player slander in here will not be tolerated

**dreamingpastel** (2): Meh.

**throwaway-7650** (2): k guess I'm back to dragging this album through the mud again

**MoonlightByWindow** (1): worst song on the album easily

A killer opening, honestly. This one seems to get overshadowed a lot by me included, I hardly ever go to listen to it unless im listening to it like this.

#Quinton Reviews Alts'

**CrimsonROSET** (9): me when i’m victoria justice

**nt96** (9): Naming your song after fellow rate winners is so camp

**thisusernameisntlong** (9): my favorite Nickelodeon show! at the Disco

**seanderlust** (8.5): someone: what is your favorite nickelodeon live show that aired between 2010 and 2013? me: hmmmm.........i'd have to say big time rush them: okay but what's your second favorite me:

**emayzee** (7.7): i'd rather be listening to tori vega

**1998tweety** (6): the show >>>>

**Ghost-Quartet** (6): It’s called “Victorious” but it’s giving *Descendants*


**Saison\_Marguerite** (6): okay Victoria Justice

**TheQueenofVultures** (6): the cast of Victorious be like

**steelstepladder** (5): I was more of an icarly fan personally

**isthesweetestcon** (4): if the timing was different i would swear he wrote this to be the theme for the nickelodeon show

#Double Bubble Disco Queens

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (10): I doubt it gets that far but this would be a very hilarious runner up.

**CarlieScion** (10): hype

**cremeebrulee** (10): hearing this for the first time and immediately dming king asking why everyone was tanking the shit out of this album

**hikk** (10): starting the most ott album with the most ott song it just makes sense

**IIIHenryIII** (10): sorry, but I think you meant, tonight we AREN'T victorious

**jay** (10): this ate omfg

**musical\_pyn** (10): I love it when panic uses their powers for good instead of evil

**mysario** (10): what an album opener should be

**RandomHypnotica** (10): a surprisingly promising and strong opener

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): A song consisting of Brendon Urie bragging about himself for 3 straight minutes should not work, and yet it works oh so well

**Awkward\_King** (9.5): he ended the show with this when i saw him and that was so true tbh

**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): cheerleader boy gone edgy

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): I implore you all to listen to the RAC remix of this because it is just awful. Then you will all also understand when I say "DVBBL BVBBL DISCO QUEEVN"

**Bandito21Dema** (9): fun to dance to


**pig-serpent** (9): This one took a while to grow on me at the time, but it won me over because it really sounds like you're walking into a room and having champagne arcing over your head.

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (8.9): absolute vibe

**heysoupie** (8.6): the vocals are exhausting in the best way possible

**MassiveThief** (8.5): I liked this song, then hated it, didn't listen to it forever, and here I am loving it again.

**nick1372** (8.5): This would go so hard live. if only brendan urie wasn't just... so gross

**ignitethephoenix** (8): oh he brought out the whole theatre kid here

**king bestie** (8): clubbing has nothing on being 12 and blasting this in my grandmas living room

**MoonlightByWindow** (8): it’s a smasha like why lie

**plastichaxan** (8): Maybe watching the videos was a mistake cause his faces make this sound worse for some reason

**timothy444** (8): The childish chants at the beginning and end of the song almost made me flinch and think I was listening to a Galantis track

**Uberpigeon** (8): i love calling all monsters

**welcome2thejam** (8): Might keep a running mental tally of every song in this rate that could soundtrack an ESPN commercial. Let's start: 1

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9.5): i love the winner of the disney/nick live action rate omg

**intheaftermath** (7.5): I remember getting really bitter in 2016 or so when my local alternative radio station picked this up. Not MY beloved indie darling Panic! at the Disco getting radio play???

**runaway3212** (7.5): idc this intro eats

**frogaranaman** (7): are we really gonna pretend and be the people that say “I want the old Brendon Urie back” as if this wasn’t Brendan Urie already parodying Brenden Urie and getting way too into that parody

**moonagenightmares** (7): the chorus is so underwhelming

**throwaway-7650** (6.5): I thought the beginning of the song was that's my girl by 5H

**whoisValensi** (6.5): You know, it's kinda funny looking back at this song in retrospect. I think this was the moment where I should have known that Brendon's ego was gonna precide everything he did from here on out. And yet... I got too hooked into the fucking hook. Probably one of the more redeeming qualities of this song, especially to me who was like 14? 15? when I first listened to this entire album and then proceeded to have an entire P!ATD era. But now I look back and I'm like "Oh dear god I really liked this one huh."

**BreadlessCrust** (6.2): the beginning is the best part

**rotating3Dtext** (6.2): man that intro is horrible

**xxipil0ts** (6.2): if he rereleases this now, this would have an inevitable tiktokification from the fnaf fandom


**akanewasright** (6): I sorta like most of this but like… the children…

**Puppy\_Basket** (6): Good but not great

#50 Shades of murder

**Stryxen** (6): and this washed up celebrity IS in the room with us right now

**TiltControls** (6): bit early to celebrate the rate win no?

**velvet-gloves** (6): fun to scream along but the verses feel like Brendon trying too hard to recapture the AFYCSO era style of lyricism

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (5.2): The pre-chorus is fun, but this is peak stadium rock and not in a good way.

**daythreeinmiami** (5): I don’t know why I liked this song in 2016. It’s weird cause I was NOT victorious in 2016. Honestly, I peaked in 2010.

**emoforever1927** (5): like this alot but it's the only one for me of panics i feel is overplayed

**followingfreeways** (5): hes just so loud.....

**ImADudeDuh** (5): the “oooooooooaaaaaAAAAAHHHHHHHHH” really sets the mood for the song

**Madiso\_52** (5): would not skip if played during commercials

**modulum83** (4.5): brendon urie you will NEVER be imagine dragons.

**-y-y-y-** (4): , decent party/arena anthem, better live but ultimately kinda shit

**criestotheclicking** (4): my headphones once came unplugged when i was listening to this and my friend was like “this song is terrible” and honestly, I couldn’t disagree. Fun to sing along to in order to test your vocal range I guess but it’s not even a good pumped-up sports song. It’s just a bit too much, but also the mix is kind of empty.

**impla77** (4): I guess the washed-up celebrity line hits harder for Brendan now..

**ScrtSuperhero** (4): - Has good parts (I really like his vocal delivery through most of the song) but is also kind of grating? Also another addition to the overuse of children's choruses in the PATD discography.

**ktajlili** (3): I think I used to like this, but going back there are just a ton of annoying production choices. WTF is with the children chanting?

**apatel27** (2): An assault on the ears in the worst way

**bogo** (2): none of these lyrics make any sense they're just words thrown together. what the fuck is a double bubble disco queen. what do you mean you are 50 words for murder. do you even know what you are saying right now

**dreamingpastel** (2): The sing-song "tonight we are victorious" part is grating.

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (2): already starts punchable and without any traces or vestiges of emo; an incredible sign that whatever the label means is totally meaningless in any capacity for likely anything in this rate. literally cheering against this fecker in the ring during the cage match. godawful singalong chorus with also one of the most viciously cringe music videos. dude you gotta get over girls.

**whatsanillinois** (1): that high pitched AHH is so annoying, the vocal melody in the first verse is dreadful, the "hot chicks" in the music video feels weird, the effects on the vocals absolutely horrendous

okay here's where the album starts to end its killer 7 track run of each track being amazing, this song starts off kinda good but the moment we get past the first chorus im kinda over it, I hate to use this insult but its kinda giving 2015 Brand New Ford Ultima featuring Bluetooth. Its the longest song on the album and you can really feel it.

Another one Im shocked did so well? You could not have told me that it would do better than ab/ap title track I would've never guessed 

---

# Living their best life in the sunshine

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (11): this song ascends me to heaven

**bogo** (10): this is really good too wtf

**CrimsonROSET** (10): can brendon urie even tan

**IIIHenryIII** (10): golden song

**intheaftermath** (10): this song is 4 minutes and 12 seconds long and I know that because I would run my middle school cross country route with a goal of keeping each mile under two Golden Days. It's like an All Too Well unit of measurement but for emo kids.

**jay** (10): WAITTTTT.

**king bestie** (10): i wore my golden days merch t shirt everyday after the concert and i will defend it forever

**nt96** (10): well damn

**runaway3212** (10): this is a bop harry styles wishes he could do this

**throwaway-7650** (10): the verses are so yass & slay, them + LA devotee chorus = ?

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh finally the three good good good good songs on this album back to back to back. I know I complained about the screaming on LA Devotee (and this will probably go out before that so spoilers.) BUT it's kinda idk endearing here???? Idk stream "Golden Age" by CRX.

**isthesweetestcon** (9.5): help i really like this? did i judge this album unfairly? is it on an upward swing? it doesn’t have the feel of the panic i fell in love with in my youth but i am starting to get why people like the newer music nowadays. i can dig it.

**-y-y-y-** (9): , the best song on the album by FAR, a tasteful mix of nostalgia and idealism

**CarlieScion** (9): stop screaming at me!!!!!!!!!!

**celladonn** (9): underrated track imo

**MassiveThief** (9): Maybe I forced myself into liking the chorus because I understand why many would hate how loud and repetitive it is, but I've grown to love it

**Puppy\_Basket** (9): back-to-back bangers

**TiltControls** (9): my first candidate for my 11 ~~before I actually listened to the other two albums~~

**criestotheclicking** (8.9): another really good song. I think Brendon’s voice shines on the pre-chorus because 1.) he is firmly within his range and 2.) the melody is really nice.

**seanderlust** (8.5): stream farrah fawcett hair by capital cities

**xxipil0ts** (8.5): : he put his entire brendussy into this

**modulum83** (8): just take out the horns and give this instrumental to jimmy eat world man. fuck you got me brendon. you got me with this one i don’t even care how bad the lyrics are

**jackisboredtoday** (7.3): I didn’t listen to this one much when the album was new but actually this is good? Idk why I didn’t eat it up back then

**RandomHypnotica** (7.2): this feels like brendon trying to make a later era MCR song and failing

**1998tweety** (7): Golden Hour >>>

**dreamingpastel** (7): The chorus brings down the rest of the song.

**pig-serpent** (7): I forgot this song existed.  It's a good step up from the worst songs on this album, but a better step down from the good ones.

**Verboten\_Prince** (7): GOLDEN DAAAAA—sound of glass shattering—AAAAAAA—car alarms honking—AAAAAAA—dogs barking

#Having a mid day at best

**heysoupie** (6.8): the lyrics/structure of this one give Cursive (the band) and also it feels like its 6 minutes long towards the end

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (6): I really want to like this one more than I do, but the mix is just atrocious.

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (6): i listened to this album at least 50 times as a kid and i literally do not remember this song at all

**welcome2thejam** (6): Another song that feels like it has all the elements of something strong but can't get there

**apatel27** (5): Inoffensive

**Ghost-Quartet** (5): I like this concept for a song but I don’t get why it sounds like this? What about the story he’s telling requires this weird gritty rock sound? I think it would be better if the whole song were a bit more like the bridge that comes around the two and half minute mark.

**Stryxen** (5): his esoteric ass. Who has ever said the word debonair before

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5): a point for every minute because it doesn't have to be this long. genuinely one of the more coherent cuts on the LP? an extra point for that. idk why it takes the album THIS long to almost have an idea, but its almost emo.

**impla77** (4.8): Why does Brendan Urie feel the need to damage his vocal chords on EVERY song

**MoonlightByWindow** (4.5): um. why did 13yo me love this song so much DSFKKFSD

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (4): Okay even as someone who likes Brendon’s obnoxious voice this chorus is a little much.

**frogaranaman** (4): this man does not know his limit as a songwriter here

**nick1372** (4): ok this is where brendan's voice gets annoying

**ScrtSuperhero** (4): - He attempts something big here (I think?) and fails to live up to those Golden Days

**velvet-gloves** (4): because it drags on 4ever

**whatsanillinois** (4): if this man called me sexy i would vomit

**akanewasright** (3): on an album where obnoxious bullshit is so clearly the appeal, being bland is honestly worse

**LilacDaffodils** (3): sexy sexy looking back

**daythreeinmiami** (2): This sounds like Sia’s ‘Alive’ and I hate Sia’s ‘Alive’.

**Awkward\_King** (1): q i love music

**thisusernameisntlong** (1): stop shouting GOLDEN DAAAAAYS! at the Disco

there are alternate universes where I 11 this and you know what I stand by it. This went double diamond on the 2015 roxie charts. The faux reggae accent and elements of this song are kinda,,,,, however this is the *one song* on the album that I'm kinda fine with it on. I cant undo the fact that the chorus of this song makes me feel like im free falling through the air while ignoring all of my problems and stuff thats plauged me. I've absolutely cried to this song before and thats so embaressing to admit but its true! this is my favorite single from this album

---


# Riding on a High 

**cremeebrulee** (10): ugh i forgot how good this song was

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): since TØP was the most mainstream thing I listened to in 2016, my fam would put this on the aux whenever I was in the car so that I wouldn’t whine about them playing boring “mainstream” music like [insert random pop girl/EDM producer collab]

**emayzee** (10): this song sounds like the summer of pokemon go

**frogaranaman** (10): it’s cursed how many people cite this as the first rap song they learned

**ignitethephoenix** (10): I love the chorus

**IIIHenryIII** (10): nothing beats the feeling of rapping their songs accurately

**mysario** (10): y'all remember The Vines "Ride"? ...just me?

**whoisValensi** (10): Oh no it's another relatable song for me oh no! I also have been thinking too much...

**bigbigbee** (9.5): POV, you’re in your friend’s car in 2016

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9.5): Ugh that one part invented screamo.

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): this is so MAGIC!-coded ugh, and I can’t help but bop anyway, smh

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): The singles were honestly really well-chosen here. They all still hold up really well.

**Ghost-Quartet** (9): Cod reggae but you know what? I’m pescatarian.

**pig-serpent** (9): I've always loved the way those big synths in the chorus sound.  They're an amazing blend of powerful and floaty.

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): I don't understand what most of these songs mean but they still bang

**modulum83** (8.7): please someone send help my intense nostalgia for this period of my life is forcing me to overscore this by frankly obscene indefensible margins

**xxipil0ts** (8.3): : rating this song higher than 7 just bc this is probably their best radio-ready pop song.

**CrimsonROSET** (8): 16 year old me thinking this was the deepest shit ever

**rotating3Dtext** (8): I once cried in the middle of the mall on Hollywood and Highland while this played

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (8): ok fine i have a spot soft for this one, mostly because my one cousin really enjoys this and used to play it a lot when i would visit her

**welcome2thejam** (8): This was the major TOP hit I actually enjoyed hearing. Maybe helps that a song called Ride sounds good on a car radio

**Awkward\_King** (7.5): white people doing reggae is like roxie doing an indie rate. it shouldn't happen but sometimes the circumstances are dire enough [**Host Note**: Now]

**dreamingpastel** (7.5): The reggae elements make this song kinda charming.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.5): my mom’s favorite tøp song

**1998tweety** (7): this had potential

**bogo** (7): you know maybe the big singles from this album were good after all

**daythreeinmiami** (7): This song has aged for me a bit but it’s still a good song. I think the Reggieness of the song works in all honestly.

**heysoupie** (7): also kind of a bop but the reggae vibes are…making me think about how weird sublime must have been in the 90s / makes me wonder if 21p is sublime for zoomers

**king bestie** (7): i’ve been thinking too much help me is so relatable i’ve run out of things to say

**MoonlightByWindow** (7): the bridge elevates it slightly

**velvet-gloves** (7): it’s a solid song

**criestotheclicking** (6.4): when this song was getting popular in the UK I had just got a twenty one pilots jumper that I wore at every opportunity and felt very cool while doing so.

#Falling Face First Into the ground

**TiltControls** (6): Another one with a solid hook and verses I don't really care for. This one's a bit better though.

**timothy444** (6): Sorry but radio airplay ruined this for me

**BreadlessCrust** (5.5): same deal w/ stressed out

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.5): oh jesus this was the reggae cut wasn't it?! THIS FUCKING SONG >:? and uhh its a total car commercial music, and its really endearingly shitty to me because it just has no meat on the bone like I think my reggae should, nothing I can latch onto and sink my teeth in. BUT, as Whatsanillinois points out, it does the job and its catchy. idk classic 0/11  with conundrum for lietoc. have to split the middle tragically

**-y-y-y-** (5): the absolute summer song of 2015, I think I made out with a girl from my summer driving class to this song once

**CarlieScion** (5): kinda cute ig?

**celladonn** (5): i always hear "i'm boring so i'm taking my time on my ride"

**intheaftermath** (5): I know they hate Stressed Out but I hate this one.

**Uberpigeon** (5): stop rapping

**ImADudeDuh** (4): when this is the last day 1 boot >>

**jay** (4): oh neptune

**steelstepladder** (4): This song is actually kinda bad

**Stryxen** (4): i climbed out my head and watched myself implode a thought without a body ought to be the shot to take the load off my brain is poison and i’m searching for the antidote but every time i find it my defences scream oh no you don’t. woah!

**whatsanillinois** (4): i think it's cool that they're having fun but this is no ride by lana del rey

**akanewasright** (3): I hate this a bit less than I remembered but the chorus is just so limp

**isthesweetestcon** (3): i don’t know how to feel about this group. like they are going through the motions of emo but lack… something???

**RandomHypnotica** (3): this ride gave me vertigo

**thisusernameisntlong** (3): no good thing about this song could save it from its godawful abysmal bridge/outro

**throwaway-7650** (3): not to be a reycist but if I had to listen to a song called ride by an "alternative" artist who should've kept their moof closed I'd rather put on lana

**Hulnia** (2): the way they stretch out the word ride is absolutely disgusting

**followingfreeways** (1): the singles really are the worst on this album and i know thats ironic coming from a swifitie :/

**nick1372** (1): thank god Tyler has never sounded this bad ever since

**TheQueenofVultures** (1): the magic!ification of twenty one pilots

**hikk** (0): this obnoxious ass chorus and who tf let them do reggae like

**Puppy\_Basket** (0): Maroon 5 faux-reggae

**runaway3212** (0): this absolutely horrible bridge that for some reason you have to hear twice???

Poor Immortals, I knew you were doomed from the moment the rate started. #17 is pretty respectable all things considered even though it still couldnt manage to break a 7 average like the last time we rated it in the bonus of the disney animation rate.

---

#The True Heros of the rate 

**bigbigbee** (11): one month ago on r/falloutboy I confidently stated that I preferred Fourth of July to this and then karma immediately saw a chance to make me Wrong

**jackisboredtoday** (11): it’s my most played song EVER in my iTunes library, this song (specifically the Big Hero 6 version) was my whole personality at one point so I am legally obligated to give it my 11 and be very disappointed in all of you when you do it horrendously dirty

**mysario** (11): I'm satisfied with my care 🥺😭

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): “YOOOOO IT’S THE BIG HERO 6 SONG!!!”

**runaway3212** (10): Big Hero 6 best movie ever

**starlitsuns** (10): this is getting a 10 solely for being on the Big Hero 6 soundtrack. also a Baymax hug is up there with a Chewbacca and Jürgen Klopp hug on the list of hugs I want but will never get

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): something about hot disney moms

**timothy444** (10): Ahhh the Big Hero 6 song that was a cultural reset for Hiro Hamada. I stanned him then and I will still stan him because he needs to be protecc

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): I was obsessed with Big Hero 6 you had no idea… and when I found out my favorite band was gonna do a song for the movie WHEW. It hurts to not make this my 11 but just know it's REEEEALLY close!

**whoisValensi** (10): I think if any member of FOB approached me and said "Hey, we can be immortals!", I'd take them up on the offer tbh.

**intheaftermath** (9.5): baymax my beloved <3

**Hulnia** (9): maroon 5 if they were good

**indie\_fan\_** (9): fist bump bah-lah-lah-lah

**lordofthpotat0** (9): free baymax

**nick1372** (9): Big Hero 6 was such an excellent movie why don't we talk about that more

**TragicKingdom1** (9): the edm elements work so well against the odds

**velvet-gloves** (9): fall out boy are disney girls because of this song and isn’t that so fun

**BreadlessCrust** (8.7): big hero 6 is so good but this is another overplayed one unfortunately

**-y-y-y-** (8.5): , shoutout to Patrick for not knowing the words to this song and still making it an absolute banger

**CarlieScion** (8): big hero 6? More like big hero 8

**CrimsonROSET** (8): remember when people were horny for the older brother in big hero 6 like

**ImADudeDuh** (8): big hero 6 was probably overrated in my mind but idc this slaps

**Puppy\_Basket** (8): Big Hero 8

**1998tweety** (7.5): bop

**king bestie** (7.5): three minutes of physically painful nostalgia

**frogaranaman** (7): this being a Disney sync threw me for a loop and I saw Big Hero 6

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): the worst Disney movie btw but the song isn’t bad… also vote for Cartoon Tunes please

**IIIHenryIII** (7): I have a toxic relationship with this one, the beginning of the chorus is superb but then it gets to that "immortals" part and it loses all of the hype. Also, the verses are very uninspiring, so there's that too.

**pig-serpent** (7): My opinion on this song changes all the time.  It's a cool and unique sound for the record and it's super catchy, but it's also pretty annoying.  My brain picks a different side every few years but I think I'm swinging back around towards liking the song rn.

#Thinking about whoever compared this song to sticker by nct 127 i dont think thats inherently negative but it is cursed enough that im making it the header for this section

**criestotheclicking** (6.9): the fact this was in Big Hero Six makes me like both a lot more. Very difficult to make the word ‘sutures’ work in a song and FOB did not succeed lmfao. Talking about the album as a whole here, I just sit and wonder how we got from songs like 7 Minutes in Heaven and Carpal Tunnel to songs like this. It’s like all the actual emotional punch of the songs got converted into forced epicness.

**impla77** (6.7): someone get this man a dictionary

**ignitethephoenix** (6.5): why does his voice sound so off the the chorus: also this seems like the most generic AI generated Fob song (minus the flute-esque instrument)

**cremeebrulee** (6): doesn't do anything that centuries doesn't already tbh

**dreamingpastel** (6): I like this song, but it's not the best song in this rate by any measure.

**isthesweetestcon** (6): i never saw this movie but i guess this is fob’s mercenary? (only mercenary slapped)

**modulum83** (6): this is an AI generated fall out boy song

**Stryxen** (6): the intro was sooo… but then this song got good so…

**xxipil0ts** (6): : filed under songs that tadashi got heated on

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.8): was real worried we were gonna go orientalist with those wind instruments, and maybe it is? its def not fourth world music, i know that. but the forking production is so middle of the road

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5.5): now how did one of my favorite bands write a song for one my favorite disney movies and it ended up being THIS forgettable

**RandomHypnotica** (5): this is like a cheap linkin park knockoff

**ScrtSuperhero** (5): - why does he say down like that

**steelstepladder** (5): He has that Talk Dirty by Jason Derulo flow here

**heysoupie** (4.9): another soulless FOB by numbers song & unfortunately the drums in this track sound awful & what the heck is that annoying whiny background sound?

**throwaway-7650** (4.5): are we sure this doesn't also sample edge of seventeen too

**bogo** (4): honk shoo honk shoo honk shoo

**moonagenightmares** (4): so sick of this song

**TiltControls** (4): I have the same problem with that as I do with Centuries where something just isn't clicking for me on the vocal side

**apatel27** (3): Still don't get how this correlates to Big Hero 6

**daythreeinmiami** (3): Okay I’ll give them that, the transition from Favourite Record to Immortals was pretty sick. Other than that this is generic and it sounds like the rest of the album. A mush of blugh.

**MoonlightByWindow** (3): another song which i liked far more in 2015

**emoforever1927** (2): love patricks vocals and the lyrics i just cant get past the sound and tuning of this song

**jay** (2): must i explain

**welcome2thejam** (2): Centuries but terrible

**whatsanillinois** (2): Lietoc: we going orientalist

**flava** (1): an incredibly annoying song

**nt96** (1): the slight screech in his already slightly distorted voice is making me feel ill and that Immortals refrain is just so awful, like it feels like he's forcing the notes out rather than letting it glide naturally.

I really want to hate this album and call it cringe, and dont worry I will <3, but man listening to this is giving me flashbacks, and man, i do like this song, i still know every word :( wake up you need to make money , yuh

---

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**Awkward\_King** (10): i dont think any song better captures the 2015 emo kid slouched back black nails long sleeves long hair undiagnosed mental problems energy than this

**cremeebrulee** (10): the candle verse deserves a pulitzer if we're being completely honest

**CrimsonROSET** (10): cultural reset idc!

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): I clapped when this came on the radio at the store for the first time. Imagine, you’re at a fancy mall and this kid starts clapping and freaking out about some random song that’s playing on a corporate radio. I can feel the secondhand embarrassment, and also the firsthand embarrassment.

**frogaranaman** (10): Tied up and struggling in my chair, the bag over my head is yanked off as I get slapped immediately upon seeing a bright light. “Correlation does not equal causation!” the FBI agent yells at me. I don’t care. I know the truth. “Tree house loans increased after the release of ‘Stressed Out’ by twenty one pilots!” I scream, as I spit in their mouth. The agent grabs a bucket of water and throws it at my face.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): I've always found it so weird how big this song got, but then the chorus hit and it all makes sense. Anyone, anywhere, anytime can relate to it

**moonagenightmares** (10): the cartoon haunted castle sounds slayed

**nick1372** (10): I've never been nostalgic for childhood but this is such an excellent portrayal of how much adult life sucks that it makes me really want to be.

**nt96** (10): The Quarter-Life Crisis anthem

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): when you think about it, this was the Heat Waves of 2015, aside from the part that it’s a 10 and not a 0

**timothy444** (10): One of my favourite songs that peaked at #2, especially the bridge part

**Verboten\_Prince** (10): Was definitely annoyed of this song when it first came out but now I appreciate it… look at me I'm a stressed out adult too ;_;

**Saison\_Marguerite** (9.5): I dragged the shit out of this song when it came out, but was that just a knee-jerk reaction to relating too much??

**akanewasright** (9): this being my highest tøp score is kinda cursed and will not be a common opinion but like… idk I’ve never hated this. Like yeah it’s cringy, but it’s insanely memorable and catchy, whether you think that’s a good or bad thing

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): This is so relatable idc. Like I hate waking up because I need to make money!

**-y-y-y-** (8.5): , I tried to rate this song lower because my eardrums are still recovering from how many times I heard it on "alt" radio but it's just a great fucking song

**bigbigbee** (8.5): DOO DE GOO DOH DAYS

**bogo** (8.5): idk what to say it's catchy

**ignitethephoenix** (8.5): used to really like this song, but now it’s just fine to me. But also very relatable still

**mysario** (8.5): jokes on you, I've always been stressed out

**apatel27** (8): doomer cousin of Bills

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (8): This one got killed by overplay a bit, but that rap is still fun as hell.

**Ghost-Quartet** (8): Back when I was in college my friend who was an English major made some of us go to an open mike night at a Barnes and Noble and it was hosted by this guy who said that he was a homeless man who lived out in the parking lot and he kept jokingly asking for a ride except after like the fourth time we realized that he was actually serious. One of the regulars accompanied him on keyboard as he sang this song but they just played the chords so it was just like. this homeless man wailing out these depressing lyrics over sparse instrumentation. We left after that.

**intheaftermath** (8): this song sounded nostalgic when I first heard it. It's weird to have it actually be nostalgic now.

**plastichaxan** (8): Poppy from 7 years ago ate this up I can’t lie and the Wake up you need to make money line still hits <a:noitssad:873268482614128730>

**poemforsmallthings** (8): yeah. it's catchy

**runaway3212** (8): The story of the candle is kinda so stupid but im also obsessed with it

**steelstepladder** (8): This song isn't bad.

**velvet-gloves** (8): some fun wordplay

**heysoupie** (7.9): i’m almost embarrassed that i think this is kind of a bop

**jackisboredtoday** (7.7): the week this first started blowing up was finals week at my high school and i believe that was NOT a coincidence

**emayzee** (7.6): i've heard this song a billion times i genuinely don't know how to rate this

**celladonn** (7.5): overplay has hurt this a bit

**ImADudeDuh** (7.5): I think one of my first comments on r/popheads was about how smart the ladder line was, so this was traumatic

**whoisValensi** (7.5): Oh no I don't like how this has become relatable now that I have a job...

**impla77** (7.2): all the 14 year olds really felt this

**dreamingpastel** (7): I used to HATE this song because my local radio station would play it like a thousand times a day, but I've come around to it. Still not enough to score it any higher than a 7, but I can tolerate it now.

**king bestie** (7): if a song can bounce back from trending on musicly it can do anything

**MassiveThief** (7): Stressed Out and ride both sit that same kinda "radio-fodder, but not horrible" kinda space

**daythreeinmiami** (6.5): I do be very stressed out these days.

**MoonlightByWindow** (6.5): even when i was a big 21p stan this was my least fave song on the album LOL. with that said it’s actually better than i remember

**criestotheclicking** (6.2): my friends would clown me for liking this song and yeah fairs I get how ANTI is better than this album. If you were to draw lines between tøp and AJR i think you would start here. I absolutely understand the sentiment of the song but it’s too earnest to bear, and not intentionally.

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (6.2): I hate that this is their most successful song. It's so boring.

**Bandito21Dema** (6): because overplayed

**CarlieScion** (6): decidedly average and inoffensive

**LilacDaffodils** (6): this song is the only reason I know how to use former and latter

**musical\_pyn** (6): I really love the chorus but…god the talk rap has not aged well at all

**pig-serpent** (6): Absolutely exhausting to listen to every five minutes as a summer camp counselor, but removed from that by a few years I'm reminded of why this song got so big in the first place.  Probably the best hit of living in a constant state of exhaustion until we got Numb Little Bug earlier this year, and I do appreciate that one of their more personal and artistic songs was their big breakthrough hit instead of one that was more pushed by the label.

**seanderlust** (6): my one gripe with this song is that i really like the idea of "blurryface" as the personification of anxiety/depression/self-loathing - i really feel like it's a good representation and i like that metaphor. i wish this song spent more time with that idea than AJR-esque millennial pandering

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (5.1): i do not like this sound or rapping, but i genuinely appreciate their fits and the drummer's insane capacity to just rip. again, puddle of mudd - blurry called and misses u, blurryface.

**BreadlessCrust** (5): im sorry this is so overrated

**flava** (5): The Chainsmokers were the superior hitmaker duo of 2016

**Puppy\_Basket** (5): very overplayed

**Uberpigeon** (5): this song makes me feel embarrassed from when i listened to it unironically

**welcome2thejam** (5): This becoming a surprise mainstream hit felt like we were collectively dropped midway into TOP lore and just expected to know who Blurryface was

**modulum83** (4): this was the heat waves of 2015-2016 and none of you are ready to admit that

**throwaway-7650** (4): we're going on a trip in our favorite rocketship flying through the sky little einsteins

=====

Roxieloxie: **ktajlili** (3.5): Okay, so lyrically, this song is really, really bad. And for a song that seems very centered on the lyrics, this is not a good thing. The only reason why I am not writing this lower is because I think that it sets out to do what it's meant to really well. I can see why you would relate to it as a depressed teenager, whose parents are telling you "ah you can't be creative. You need to make money. You need to go to college, nyah." Yeah, adulthood sucks. But nothing they're complaining about in this song actually feels that serious, which is why this song doesn't work for me. Being an adult sucks for more reasons than going to work everyday and having to make money. Overall, the lyrics come off as really immature to me.

**TiltControls** (3): I actually like parts of this song (aka the chorus), but the weak verses and the anti-drop after the chorus just completely kills the enjoyment for me

**whatsanillinois** (3): this is stereo hearts by gym class heroes featuring adam leaveline but worse

**static\_int\_husp** (2): I started college in 2015 and my freshman roommate was obsessed with tøp, which means this song has been overplayed to death for me and I hate it, sorry

**hikk** (1): i've always hated this so much omfg it's so annoying

**jay** (1): genuinely one of the worst popular songs ive ever heard..

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (1): fuck you

**isthesweetestcon** (0): theme is great but the execution is lacking

**RandomHypnotica** (0): jake novak ghostwrite

This was my first new fob song since getting into them and im not saying i convientnly asked my parents if i could miss that tuesday of school so i could hear this song premiere live on bbc radio 1 at 1pm est, but lets just say I wasnt at school that day and i heard it at 1pm. This is important because while listening to pete talk on the radio about this song, I would be on tumblr and see someone talking about how mad they were that directioners were taking the attention away from fob because 1D released a new song, now I hadnt been into 1D for at least 6 months at this point and I was shocked to see that they were still hanging on and about to release a new album, I listened to the new song and begrudgingly admitted that it was 'alright' and went back to fob, but this dear reader, had planted the seed in my head and it was only a matter of weeks before I would fall back into the 1d standom cycle. Centuries is neat tho

Honestly I didnt go in knowing this would be my 11 but the more prep I did for the rate and the listening parties and just reliving alot of that teen nostalgia, this song just kept being at the forefront of everything. Its the song that started this entire era for me, I cant watch the music video without remembering frantically texting my best friend if we were about to get ybc part 2 its just very comfy and I cant not give it my 11 

---

**1998tweety** (10): i mean come on now

**CarlieScion** (10): still makes me lowkey feral when it comes on

**celladonn** (10): good amv song

**CrimsonROSET** (10): i have the chorus to this song as my alarm

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): hot girls hear “and here’s the frozen fruit” instead of “frozen proof”

**hikk** (10): i used to not like this but it's hitting now idk

**Hulnia** (10): like yeah it’s clearly made for movie trailers/ads but let’s not pretend it’s bad at it. it’s also a fucking hilarious song, especially the chorus.

**IIIHenryIII** (10): today I learned Patrick is actually saying the word "amnesia" in this song

**jackisboredtoday** (10): the only people allowed to complain about overplay for this song are people who watched college football & got all the promos for the first ever CFP playoff. the rest of you have no right to hold overplay against this classic

**moonagenightmares** (10): slay sample

**nt96** (10): I'm no FOB fan by any means necessary, but when this song goes on, I become a metalhead

**runaway3212** (10): big hero 6 is such a good movie

**Saison\_Marguerite** (10): is this supposed to sound like a serial killer’s inner monologue? oh, no one thought that except me? okay then! I was gonna 11 this but I realized I find it just a little self-serious (and creepy apparently)

**seanderlust** (10): yeah this got played to death on ESPN i don't care that suzanne vega sample goes OFF. if you don't go feral after the *bang bang* HEART i can't relate

**whoisValensi** (10): Just want everyone to know that this came on at work the other night and I had to really hold back from screaming the entire first verse lolllll. Probably a good thing I have insanely bad anxiety and was having a migraine that held me back a bit yeah.

**akanewasright** (9.5): they were so goofy for that interpolation, but like… the prechorus is a moment

**cremeebrulee** (9.5): gonna embarass myself for a second and confess that for the longest time i thought "tom's diner" was the tom tom club song fantasy sampled (as you can tell, i hadn't heard either as teen) and i was always confused on what the original song sounded like if it was used in both this and in fantasy fhfhhfhf

**ignitethephoenix** (9.5): they are keeping sporting events fed for centuries

**indie\_fan\_** (9.5): BUDDY YOU'RE AN OLD MAN POOR- wait no, wrong colosseum themed music video

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (9): I’m still unable to hear anything but “heeeeeere’s the frozen fruuuuuit”

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (9): am i annoyed that this is the most popular song on this album when its by far one of the least interesting? yes. but am i going to pretend that im better than this and that i dont genuinely also really love this song despite how overplayed and generic it is? ...no this still fucking hits lol

**Verboten\_Prince** (9): This is literally one of the first songs IN MY LIFE I went and found on my own, without any influence from my parents, and fell in love with. It's not perfect but it's MY song man!!!

**BreadlessCrust** (8.9): only loses points for being overplayed and kinda slow

**MoonlightByWindow** (8.5): i still remember when this dropped and i listened to it with all my other emo friends first thing at school…crazy

**dreamingpastel** (8): HEAVY METAL BROKE MY *bang, bang* HEART!!

**frogaranaman** (8): it’s good but it makes Wentz come off as libertarian

**musical\_pyn** (8): "the opposite of amnesia" is such a terrible line lmao

**plastichaxan** (8): They got me gal

**poemforsmallthings** (8): I'm sorry it's good

**untitledmanuscript** (8): REMEMBER ME FOR CENT-URIES

**velvet-gloves** (8): arguably the most commercial song FOB has ever released. feels like it was engineered with the specific intent of ending up in an ad campaign. but you know what, if that’s what they were going for, they succeeded!

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (7.8): oh YEAH this one! this one bangs slightly

**heysoupie** (7.7): probably the strongest track on the album; was this the inspiration for <THAT> viral tiktok earlier this year? ← upon relisten I have no idea what tiktok I’m referring to?

**king bestie** (7.5): this song was my gateway into emo

**emayzee** (7.2): file this one under: songs i heard before i knew the song they were sampling

**-y-y-y-** (7): , overplayed as hell and still this good? Wtf Pete how can you have this much talent? Is it the drugs?

**apatel27** (7): There's something to be said about creating an anthem track so precise you need to apologise for corporate overplaying it

**EnemaOfTheVirus** (7): nostalgia

**ktajlili** (7): I think this gets the job done

**letsallpoo** (7): the football trauma

**starlitsuns** (7): watching ESPN circa fall 2015 ruined this for me okay thanks

**timothy444** (7): adult contemporary radio bait

**welcome2thejam** (7): Something's gotta play when college football goes to commercial, and Fall Out Boy decided it might as well be them

**xxipil0ts** (6.8): : heavy metal broke my [picture of josh dun] [another picture of josh dun] HEART!

**LilacDaffodils** (6.6): that brain/dreams “rhyme” has been bothering for awhile it does not even flow well it’s so abrupt and it takes me right out of the whole thing. That point six is for bridge.

**modulum83** (6.5): listening to this song is like ramming yourself into a brick wall, and i don’t know whether that’s a compliment or insult. also the brick wall is the compression on this mix. seriously this shit is the loudest thing ever

**ScrtSuperhero** (6.5): - hate to say it but this never fails to get me gassed up

**intheaftermath** (6): i did not make my little pony ship art themed to this song i did not make my little pony ship art themed to this song i did not make

**Madiso\_52** (6): crossover hit for sports fans and the emos

**nick1372** (6): perfectly fine radio fodder I guess but the dah dah dah part has always given me nausea. Also why is it structured like an EDM track?

**thisusernameisntlong** (6): they wanted to perform in LoL Worlds Finals Ceremony so bad. Imagine Dragons wannabe ass song

**impla77** (5.5): I feel like i should’ve known this was fob before

**Awkward\_King** (5): lets give it a few more years...

**criestotheclicking** (5): the Imagine-Dragons-ification of Fall Out Boy. More hype-inducing than Victorious at least.

Roxieloxie: **isthesweetestcon** (5): this rate is bringing out my inner hipster which i don’t love but when did emo become so dad rock?? i thought i was just over my emo days menus nostalgia but maybe there was a reason i moved on. aka emo music turned this corny. i like the concept of the song but it gets old fast and doesn’t even have an ozymandias reference in it smh

**pig-serpent** (5): You know, for as much as this song is trying to be a huge, epic, workout, jock jam remix of Tom's Diner, it's surprisingly limp and yelpy.

**jay** (4): :/

**TiltControls** (4): the sample's fun, but something about the performance seems a little disconnected and lifeless for me

**whatsanillinois** (4): too much radio play

**bogo** (3): this serves no other purpose than to soundtrack sports commercials for eternity

**steelstepladder** (3): This played before every football game in highschool and I really hated it at the time. I've softened on it a little bit but that's still a terrible use of your Suzanne Vega

**Uberpigeon** (2): roxies gonna remember this ballot for centuries

**daythreeinmiami** (1): Every time this song comes on at work, I get excited for a split second because I think it’s ‘Psycho Freak’ by Camilla and Willow. Then I just feel utter disappointment and anger at whoever controls my work radio for choosing this and specifically this era of FOB to put on the rotation.

**Ghost-Quartet** (1): this is gonna give me another concussion

**RandomHypnotica** (1): I can see why some people find this annoying. There are right.

**throwaway-7650** (1): I gave a song with this sample a 1 before and oops! I did it again

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (0): Whenever I feel like hating myself and everyone else one of my favorite things to do is go on Fall Out Boy’s Spotify and Apple Music artist pages to see this beating out Sugar We’re Going Down as their most popular song.

**MassiveThief** (0): i DESPISE this song. it makes me want to rip my hair out. the era of it being on the radio 24/7 was a blight on my life.

**mysario** (0): [thank you](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/325133192778612738/1059984093011517440/Screenshot_20230103_185809.jpg)

**Stryxen** (0): ugly car advert and transformers movie trailer core + annoying hook and vocals + his breath stinks

teen agnst depression anthem pt 2

Another song I fully did not expect to do so well. At multiple times in the rate this song got as high as 6th place??? This song is paired together in my brain with not today, 

---

#Indiehead (derog)

**whatsanillinois** (11): im sorry roxie im gonna go "real emo only consists of" on you and say this is the only actual emo song in the rate

#Catching their breath 

**daythreeinmiami** (11): I hate that this song can make me ugly cry.

**Hulnia** (11): this is basically a billie eillish song

**Ayywhatsgoodfam** (10): I would kill to see this live.

**CrimsonROSET** (10): wane called this the only emo song on the rate and maybe points were made

**dream\_fighter2018** (10): that buildup and climax was an emo kids’ babies first I Know the End

**emayzee** (10): this album was huge around the time 13 reasons why came out i just know there were hannah baker edits made to this

**frogaranaman** (10): I am suddenly in a worse mental state than I was four minutes ago

**IIIHenryIII** (10): leave it to top to close an album masterfully

**ImADudeDuh** (10): one of the only songs that can actually be credited for a jumpscare

**nt96** (10): well damn

**thisusernameisntlong** (10): me giving an instant 10 to this the moment I hear the basicest of piano riffs at the start. help

**-y-y-y-** (9.5): , Tyler captures the emotions of wanting to be understood and feeling alone so well

**BleepBloopMusicFan** (9): Twenty One Pilots disappearing from the top of the charts after this era.

**lordofthpotat0** (9): got to the end of the album and still don't know who blurryface is

**MoonlightByWindow** (9): [alpha growling] I WANT TO BE KNOWN BY YOU

**nick1372** (9): an excellent closer

**runaway3212** (9): good for you honestly

**untitledmanuscript** (9): this is also one hell of a closer

**wrecking\_ball\_z** (8.3): This song is what I'd describe as classic TOP.

**WaneTrueEmotoc** (8.2): wait is this the only emo cut in the rate?! that's sick

**dreamingpastel** (8): Surprised at how much I enjoy this.

**starlitsuns** (8): DON'T LET ME BEEEEEEE *Josh Fun epic drum solo*

**Stryxen** (8): :’(

#Comments that probably mention that skeleton girl 

**xxipil0ts** (7.8): : proto-phoebe bridgers

**seanderlust** (7.5): silver medal for favorite lyrics on the album

**TiltControls** (7.5): Honestly I would've kind of preferred this as a ballot the whole way through

**whoisValensi** (7.5): Sometimes I wonder if this album is meant to be read as a concept album and this the death of Blurryface. I mean that's probably exactly what it is but like idk. That fucking "DON'T LET ME BE" scream as the song climaxes is still fucking superb tho.

**jackisboredtoday** (7.1): I feel like this is gonna get tanked for Tyler’s voice sounding feeble & sickly here but idk I always found it interesting

**1998tweety** (7): i dont like the screaming near the end but i respect it as an artistic choice

**Awkward\_King** (7): this is the only real emo song in the rate which kinda sends

**CarlieScion** (7): any song that uses repetition to signal anxiety is a good song

**followingfreeways** (7): i dont hate this one. maybe im sad

**Ghost-Quartet** (7): This is blatant “I can fix him!” bait but it sounds pretty- wait, I got to the part where he screams, I have to take a point off.

**king bestie** (7): this makes me want to part my hair on the side ngl

**musical\_pyn** (7): the…intensity? of the end just doesn't work for a long period of time like it does on other songs

**timothy444** (7): finally he screams

**criestotheclicking** (6.8): when I was younger I used to be obsessed with the idea of hearing this in concert because of how apeshit everyone goes but I think my ears would fall off. Nice closer. I like closers that acknowledge the artist and where they stand in regards to the album that we just heard. Like how Goner is Tyler reaching out to the listener about how they are the ones (as fellow “few, proud, emotional” etc. people) that will pull him out of the turmoil he's been singing about. Its function is better than the song itself in that way.

**hikk** (6.5): it's a nice enough closer, wouldn't listen to it outside of that context tho

**akanewasright** (6): yeah this is actually an ok album closer

**pig-serpent** (6): This shows a lot of promise at the beginning, but I'm not a huge fan of where it goes too.  That's a hell of a scream though.

**BreadlessCrust** (5.9): i overlistened to this in middle school

**modulum83** (5.7): just listen to the hotelier, god damn dude

**intheaftermath** (5.5): not my favorite closing track from them. The last minute or so is really great but I wish it didn't take three full minutes to get there. I greatly prefer Truce

**bogo** (5): screaming does not make your song more powerful

**jay** (5): giving kpop mini where they tack the ballad onto the

**TakeOnMeByA-ha** (5): if this was just the last minute of the song it would be a 10

**Verboten\_Prince** (5): Edgy fictional character playlist vibes

**impla77** (4.3): Was sending me to sleep so I appreciate the wakeup shouting

**Bandito21Dema** (3): not really a fan of slow songs

**RandomHypnotica** (2): this one’s just criminally boring until the end that is really fucking annoying

**emoforever1927** (1): Just not for me. its just not a 'song' to me. It has a powerful message though and I can appreciate as all TOP's music does for the most part

**throwaway-7650** (0): I NEED YOU GONE. YOU'LL NEVER BE BILLIE EILISH. NEVER
